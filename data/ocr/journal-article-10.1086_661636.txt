      <p>This book joins the distinguished company of studies that contextualize
within the history of ideas Coleridge's spectacular failure in his
lifelong project to unite theology and philosophy. Brice's particular
focus is Coleridge's skepticism about his own faith in the mechanism
of the symbol and the imagination to act as legitimate intermediaries
between the human and the divine, given the ultimate unknowability
of the divine and the constitutive fallibility of human forms of expression.
Coleridge's problems are discussed against the background of two complementary
critiques of natural religion active from the sixteenth through the
eighteenth centuries with which Coleridge would have been familiar: “epistemological
piety” and “theological voluntarism.” Epistemological
piety follows Calvin in asserting that postlapsarian humans are incapable
of reading God's handwriting in nature without the assistance of biblical
faith and divine election. Theological voluntarism, exemplified in
Locke, Boyle, and Newton, posits “an entirely arbitrary and
contingent relationship between God and His creation” (4). Because,
contra Aquinas, God is not bound by any principles known to humans,
including the principle of noncontradiction, we have no means of reasoning
from the effects of his creation, which we can see, back to the divine
causes, which we cannot see. These traditions undercut Coleridge's
efforts to establish the symbol and the imagination as “tautegorical”
principles that link human and divine creative impulses.</p>
      <p>The first half of the book thoroughly traces the Protestant critiques
of natural reason from Calvin to Kant. For Calvin, even in an unfallen
state humans knew God only through his works, and after the fall “objects
in the natural world are just so many dead letters” (17); only
those enlightened by scripture are able to make inferences about the
divine from natural evidence. Thus a gulf is established between faith
and natural reason that supports both the assertion of faith and skepticism
about natural reason. Calvin is also a theological voluntarist in
his absolute elevation of divine morality over human morality and
his insistence on the inaccessibility of the former to the latter.
Robert Boyle, drawing on both Catholic and Protestant sources, maintained
an unbridgeable difference between hypothetical explanations of natural
laws and the unknowable causes of those laws, suggesting that God
could change the laws of physics if he wanted to. Nevertheless, Boyle
engages in natural theology by reading the divine in the natural,
with the caveat that nature's legibility is a function of God's accommodation
to human frailty rather than any human ability to penetrate the essence
of the divine. Although Locke rejects the Calvinist doctrine of individual
inheritance of original sin, his empiricism still partakes in an epistemological
piety in that “our minds have no access to the world behind
our ideas of the world” (50).</p>
      <p>The argument moves back to Coleridge via a chapter on Hume and
Kant. Brice argues plausibly that “Humean philosophical skepticism
was profoundly threatening to Coleridge, in fact, because it reminded
him of sound Christian reasons for denying his own ability to read
the divine handwriting of God in nature” (53). Arguing that
Hume's skepticism is informed by Calvinism, Brice reads the <italic>Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion</italic> as presenting a “fork”
between an unsatisfactory anthropomorphism that brings God down to
the human and an equally unsatisfactory mysticism that leaves faith
without an object by denying any divine resemblance to the human.
A brief excursus into Kant finds that Kant deals with the Humean fork
by choosing agnosticism over anthropomorphism “through a refusal
to countenance any objective analogy between supersensible Ideas and
sensible objects” (87). This is a problematic reading of Kant,
especially in relation to Coleridge, since Kant's explicit response
to Hume in the <italic>Critique of Pure Reason</italic> (1781) was
to rescue the a priori from the clutches of empirical skepticism.
It is true that he rejects explicit analogies between the phenomenal
and the noumenal, but he does not give up on the possibility of a
useful relational verification of the existence of the noumenal. Later
Brice refers to the “Humean and Kantian impasse of agnosticism.…If
the “Spirit” cannot ‘in the proper sense of the
word’ be ‘conceived’ then Coleridge will be incapable
of even indicating its existence” (191). Even Kant gives a fair
amount of authority to the regulative principles that allow us to
admit of divine existence. There is a middle ground, important even
to Kant, and more important to Schelling and Coleridge, between the
anthropomorphic objectification of our representations via divine/human
analogies (anthropomorphism) and the absence of knowledge about what
lies beyond those representations (agnosticism) to which Brice fails
to give justice.</p>
      <p>The second half of the book treats Coleridge's writing from 1795
to 1805 and 1815 to 1825, basically the period of his early poetic
achievements and the period of his mature theology, though Brice does
not tell us much about how Coleridge's skepticism evolves between
these stages of his career. In poetry and notebook entries, Coleridge
evinces an involuntary skepticism toward experience itself as he by
turns enters an analogical relationship between self and world and
then recognizes “the potential disanalogies dividing natural
objects from his own poetic psyche” (99). This combination of
immanence and self-consciousness is a commonplace of Romantic thought
and its critical history, and without a more specific linkage to the
skeptical traditions discussed in previous chapters it is unclear
why this is presented as a new interpretation. More useful is the
insight that Coleridge is not only ambivalent but also explicitly
using in support of revelation a method of reasoning (in this case
Newton's) that was specifically invoked by Newton to deny the possibility
of a rational approach to the divine.</p>
      <p>Extended readings of “Religious Musings,” “Fears
in Solitude,” “France: An Ode,” and “Frost
at Midnight” develop the familiar theme that Coleridge does
not trust his own pronouncements. Faith in the patriotic Elect in “Religious
Musings” leads to Coleridge's conviction that he is not “privy
to the divine plan” (135); in “France: An Ode” political
life is firmly but problematically grounded in home and family; and “Frost
at Midnight” invites the reader to share the poet's consciousness
while reminding us that this is a written artifact. There is little
in these readings that was not explicated more fully by Harold Bloom,
M. H. Abrams, Geoffrey Hartman, and others during the heyday of phenomenological,
psychological, and early deconstructive criticism; this section would
have been better served by more specific ties to the theological traditions
treated in the first section of the book. We return to the book's
argument at the end of this section with a less than satisfactorily
substantiated link between Coleridge's difficulty distinguishing self-projection
from natural sympathy and his fears of misreading the language of
God in nature.</p>
      <p>The final chapter treats the famous passages on imagination and
on imitation versus copy in the <italic>Biographia Literaria</italic> (1817), the distinction between allegory and symbol in <italic>The
Statesman's Manual</italic> (1816), and the discussion of “symbol”
in <italic>Aids to Reflection</italic> (1825). The reading of Coleridge's
theory of imagination is by now predictable: faith in the analogy
between mind and nature is contravened by “an ontological gulf
between reason and sensibility” (154) as Coleridge is caught
between Kant and Schelling. This chapter also turns to the psychological:
Hume becomes a “scapegoat…for all that was unacceptable
in Coleridge's own thought” (172), and Coleridge struggles to
prevent the “imaginative homeostasis” of impression and
expression from “collapsing symbolic apprehension into another
subtle form of madness” (159), a madness linked to Luther's
hallucinations.</p>
      <p>The ultimate conclusion about the symbol/allegory split reached
by Brice is that a “symbol or symbolical expression, it now
seems, is no more or less than a metaphor one has faith in”
(200). This reflects a very useful insight that for Coleridge faith,
not reason, must be the glue that connects the human and divine, given
the pull of skepticism not only in the usual suspects—Hume and
the generally condemned crowd of mechanistic philosophers—but
also in the very theological traditions that he turns to for support.
Thus the main value of this study is to deepen our understanding of
the skepticism that Coleridge must overcome in order to achieve the
desired synthesis that nearly all commentators (including Coleridge
himself at his low points) agree never happened. It would have been
a much more valuable study, however, if the author had (1) connected
the two sections of the book more thoroughly with more specific links
between Coleridge's struggles with skepticism and the specific strands
of theological skepticism treated in the first sections and (2) given
us a more subtle sense of Coleridge's attempts to define various middle
grounds between skepticism and knowledge. Too often impression and
expression, divine and human, and symbol and allegory are treated
as binaries whose deconstruction is too easy.</p>
