<plain_text><page sequence="1">Rebecca Raglon and Marian Scholtmeijer "Animals are not believers in ecology": Mapping Critical Differences between Environmental and Animal Advocacy Literatures The necessity of expanding the sense of the family of being is now well recognized as an essential tenet of both environmental thought and animal rights advocacy. Rather than focusing on the pre-eminence of humans, both environmentalists and animal advocates seek to deepen understanding of the human condition by viewing human beings not only as individuals, or within a social context, but also in terms of their relationship to the nonhuman world. Environmentalism is predicated on the notion that humans are not isolated actors in the world, that there is no "free lunch," and that what we impose on the world we ultimately also impose on ourselves.1 Advocates for nonhuman animals note the similarities between human and other animal species and argue for rights for animals based on that closeness.2 Both of these approaches to the nonhuman world have been developed through a mélange of scientific, philosophical, and literary works, and both strands of thought have helped to formulate eco-critical and animal advocacy approaches to literature. Nevertheless, while environmentalism and animal advocacy share many concerns, they essentially have developed along separate lines.3 It is our contention that some of the differences informing the political and ethical debates between environmentalism and animals rights also emerge in the literary treatments of the two topics.4 The focus of this paper is to begin the examination of the many different assumptions we sense often inform the literature concerned with broad environmental Interdisciplinary Studies in Literature and Environment 14.2 (Summer 2007) Copyright © 2007 by the Association for the Study of Literature and Environment</page><page sequence="2">122 ISLE issues, and those underlying literature that focuses more closely on the plight of nonhuman animals. It is our sense that literature that deals with environmental issues, and that which focuses on nonhuman ani- mals, on occasion give rise to quite different critical concerns. Certainly such differences are not absolute: environmental literature can also deal respectfully and affectionately with individual animals, and animal rights advocates can embrace environmental causes. Nevertheless we feel that there are important differences between the two genres and that these differences offer interesting tensions that in turn may offer a way to re-invigorate and cross fertilize both areas of study. Given the scope of the topic, we have chosen a few texts as rep- resentative of literature that we believe advocates on behalf of the environment and literature that advocates for animals. We have also narrowed our focus in this paper to three aspects that we feel are particularly interesting when looking at writers as diverse as Daniel Quinn and J.M. Coetzee; or Edward Abbey and Henry Williamson. In our examples, we looked at the idea of an ecosystem compared to the focus on an individual animal which is more typically cultivated by the animal advocate writer; we looked at the various authors' appeals to emotion and/or reason; and we looked at the role of the human in each of our examples. We are aware that these choices sketch only a tentative beginning of topic which is quite broad, but one which we feel is deeply compelling even at a preliminary stage. This idea of "advocacy" is also crucial in narrowing our topic. Re- cent developments in ecocriticism have tended to broaden the scope of enquiry to include literature that certainly speaks to a variety of "environmental" issues, without necessarily overtly "advocating" for a species, a place, or an ecosystem.4 Advocacy literature, in our view, is more self-consciously directed and shaped by a coherent set of ideas and desired outcome- protection of wilderness, for example, informs much of Edward Abbey's or Peter Matthiessen's work, while abolishing cruelty tó animals is more specifically a concern of Henry Williamsom or Barbara Gowdy. With these caveats in mind, we believe that several crucial critical issues emerge that do tend to differentiate environmental literature from animal rights literature. The most obvious difference emerges from the fact that environ- mental literature is frequently philosophically oriented toward a "big picture" view, that is, concerned with nature's processes as a whole, or with ecosystems. Since writers cannot really "experience" an eco- system, such a focus frequently relies on scientific knowledge (if the author herself is not a naturalist) to fill in missing parts of the picture. In such works, writers can be found frequently chiding themselves for becoming too emotional about nature's ways and not remembering the</page><page sequence="3">"Animals are not believers in ecology" 123 "processes" they are a part of. Furthermore, because such abstractions often conceal truths which are, frankly, unpalatable to humans, the "big picture" or "ecosystems" approach often implicitly suggests that the human observer of nature is a visitor, and hence, in some ways, an exception to the laws of nature. Intellectually, yes, we accept the fact that we are a part of nature's processes: emotionally, though, we secretly find it hard to believe. For example, if environmental writers tackled the topic of life and death in their work, it is usually other animals or other people's deaths that they contemplate. Edward Abbey, for example, ruminates over the "laws" of nature in a passage from Desert Solitude. After killing a rabbit and cataloguing his responses to the act- ranging from surprise and shock to final elation- he concludes: No longer do I feel so isolated from the sparse and furtive life around me, a stranger from another world. I have entered into this one. We are kindred all of us, killer and victim, predator and prey, me and the sly coyote, the soaring buzzard, the elegant gopher snake, the trembling cottontail, the foul worms that feed on our entrails, all of them, all of us. (39) Abbey further reflects on this "primary" ecological relationship in a chapter entitled "The Dead Man and Grandview Point." Abbey imagines that the sixty-year-old man who was lost in the desert, after a few moments of panic, might have "yielded with good grace" to his inevitable death from thirst, heat, and exposure. As he helps carry the body out of the back country, Abbey and the other park employees can even joke about the man's demise: after all, they didn't know him, and they can even contemplate his death with a certain satisfaction: "Away with the old, and in with the new" (242). It is a clean and beauti- ful system, according to Abbey, though finally he is honest enough to add a caveat to this easy morality: "A part of our nature rebels against this truth and against that other part which would accept it" (242). In "Havasu" he illustrates this rebellion when he finds himself trapped in a canyon, utterly incapable of becoming a willing participant in nature's "clean and beautiful system." Because he is a complex and nuanced writer, we may suspect that throughout the book Abbey is at least in part satirizing a rather hypocritical "ecological" view that can give rise to such easy comfort when it comes to the deaths of others- either human or nonhuman- but veers off in another direction entirely when it becomes a personal matter. What we are calling animal advocacy literature, in contrast, seldom offers appeals to the "processes" of nature and is much more focused on the consequences of human-animal interactions. Animal rights advo-</page><page sequence="4">124 ISLE cates see such "big picture' explanations as a more-or-less hypocritical way to mask the similarities between our own and other species. In the view of these writers, by appealing to ecology, we can conveniently dispense with emotions that might suggest other ways of behaving. Typically, animal rights advocates seek to knock humankind off the pedestal it has raised for itself, to demonstrate that the human sense of superiority is ill-founded. The principles and beliefs that set human beings apart from, and above, other animals are seen as speciesism. In the view of animal rights advocacy, nonhuman animals have equal claim to the rights and entitlements humans assert for themselves be- cause there is nothing special about the human animal. That humans have isolated themselves from the natural world is fully recognized by animal rights advocates. The issue in contention is the consequent belief that we may therefore exploit nature and use other animals as we choose. Animal rights advocates see such exploitation as a failure to acknowledge the similarities between our own and other species, while environmentalist writers are more likely to see exploitation of other species occurring because of a failure to see the "big picture." Another difference that exists between environmental and ani- mals rights literature has to do with the fact that appeals to protect "ecosystems" frequently have a rather limited emotional repertoire. Joyce Carol Oates makes the point that nature itself inspires a "pain- fully limited set of responses in 'nature writers'- REVERENCE, AWE, PIETY, MYSTICAL ONENESS" (236). While her assessment is perhaps over-stated, she does alert us to the idea that "nature" is a category that tends ultimately to compress all diversity into a single entity5. Because nature is perceived as a single entity, it may very well elicit a single, limited response from authors and readers alike. Landscapes can be viewed as living beings, as when Barry Lopez suggests that he can feel the land breathing in Arctic Dreams, but it is still one entity. In contrast, nonhuman animals are more varied and individualized and are capable of interacting not only with humans but with each other. It is even possible to imagine psychological differences among nonhu- man animals, even of the same species. While other natural entities, and ecosystems, may lie passive as human responses vary, nonhuman animals have lives independent of human observers, and so are more immediately able to resist our narratives and cultural impositions. Just as human characters can sometimes surprise their creator, an animal in literature is likely to behave unpredictably. This, however, has lead to difficulties for writers who focus on animals. Unlike the environmental writer who contemplates ecosystems, the writer focusing on nonhuman animals appeals to emotional sensibilities and is thus often charged with sentimentality, even as they take note of dwindling numbers of</page><page sequence="5">"Animals are not believers in ecology" 125 disappearing species.6 Of course, there is every reason to love nature and deplore its destruction by humans, but the environmental writer can always rely on the argument of human self-interest when a charge of sentimentality seems imminent. The literary advocate for animals has no similar recourse and must paradoxically use the very feelings skeptics and opponents discount as misapplied or even artificial. Finally, we come to the question of how humans themselves are portrayed in both environmental and animal-centered literature. Much environmental literature features a first person narrator and focuses on the writer's encounters with the natural world. These narrators can range from the barely visible to the intrusive, from Ann Zwinger's reticence to Edward Abbey's blustering alter-ego. The humans in many cases are primarily observers of the life around them. They are witnesses and visitors. As such, environmental writers remain outside the frame, are conscious of their outsider status, and are at pains to speculate on ways humans might cross the divide that separates them from nature. Writers of animal advocacy stories, on the other hand, tend to cast humans in a much more pessimistic and far less flattering role, as an enemy and persecutor of animals. From the nonhuman animal's perspective, as animal advocates see it, human beings come into the natural world as destroyers, either of animals directly, or of animal habitats. Humans are to be feared. For the environmental writer, some human beings- including the environmental writer himself or herself- can exist in harmony with nature, but the terms of that harmonious relationship are difficult to pin down. While human subjectivity sets the tone of human interactions with nature, the nature of that subjectivity stands in question with respect to the otherness of the environment. Some people understand nature and some do not, but the basis of understanding remains a mystery. As noted above, the first difference between writers who use an environmental approach and those who focus on nonhuman animals is that environmental writing tends to view the "big picture," or in more modern terminology, ecosystems, while animal advocates work at the level of the individual. Those whose interest lies with ecosystems are not interested in individual animals but in how species fit within the greater scheme of things. They will emphasize the health of the species or lack thereof. For example, the environmental writer Daniel Quinn, in his 1990 novel Ishmael, dissects the great sweep of human history and offers a reinterpretation of Genesis as a way of explaining the environmental crisis. Quinn focuses on the cultural rather than the natural environment, but, like many environmental writers, he is interested in examining the "root" causes of environmental crises. Much of his analysis is focused on showing how humans developed</page><page sequence="6">126 ISLE a story that cast them in the role of all-knowing gods. Even the most imaginative environmental writer must appeal, however, at some point to scientific or natural "laws" in his or her account. For Quinn this mo- ment comes when he outlines what he calls the indisputable laws of existence (but which may in fact be metaphysical). According to Quinn, no one species shall make the life of the world its own; the world is not made for any one species; and humans cannot, are not permitted to impose their version of "order" on the world (145-46). These sound like reasonable "laws," but the conclusions to be drawn from such immutable laws are harsh indeed. According to Quinn, humans are not exempt from these peace-keeping laws of the community of life. Humans must accept death in the same stoical way as other forms of life accept, and have accepted, it. It is our struggle to exempt ourselves from the "laws of nature," Quinn suggests, that has created a "Taker" culture and has resulted in the environmental crisis. In practical terms, this position means "Tf there are forty thousand people in an area that can only support thirty thousand, it's no kindness to bring in food from the outside to maintain them at forty thousand'" (138). According to Quinn, "'First World farmers are fueling the Third World population explosion" (139). While Quinn is arguing against humans proclaiming themselves an exception to the laws of nature, it is nevertheless possible to see how an approach based on human "reason" or "understanding" can be unpalatable to human sensibilities and sense of emotional well-being. And again, it is possible to argue that an exception is still being made here: the hungry people who must die so that the laws of nature are not violated are presumably people far away from Quinn's readers- people somewhere in the developing world, perhaps, but certainly not us. Again, while Quinn's assessment seems brutally honest, on another level it is disingenuous because it ignores the emotional side of the equation in favor of offering a didactic and very "reasonable" explana- tion for the environmental crisis. It is simply our failure to apprehend environmental, biological laws that has led us so far astray. That unsentimental, pragmatic "systems approach," such as that expounded by Quinn, is alien to animal advocates is suggested by a feature of Richard Adams's Watership Down. Periodically in Watership Down , Adams speculates on what might be "natural" for rabbits. Those readers with an aversion to anthropomorphism will find all of Adams's rabbits highly unnatural, humanized to such a degree that little vestige of real wild rabbits remains. Accepting Adams's methods of analysis, however, there exist in Watership Down some rabbits Adams finds more unnatural than his rabbit heroes. He invents a warren called Efrafra which, going against nature, is run as a military dictatorship. In Efrafra,</page><page sequence="7">"Animals are not believers in ecology" 127 rabbits are "marked" to indicate their particular class, killed if they try to run away, and allowed to leave the warren for feeding only under guard in shifts and on a rigid schedule. The system is regimented, and the rabbits are suffering terrible anxiety and overcrowding. The rabbit population in Efrafra is controlled by does reabsorbing their fetuses. Most of the rabbits in the lower orders want to leave. These highly organized and unrabbitlike Efraf rans are the principle enemies of the rag-taggle hero rabbits of Watership Down. In Adams's mind, highly regulated systems clearly contradict animal nature. The first enemy of the rabbits in Watership Down , however, is hu- mankind. Human beings trap, poison, and shoot rabbits. Here, too, Adams criticizes systems. The first warren, of which the heroes are the last survivors, has been swept away by human beings destroying the rabbits' home site for construction of human residences. They kill the rabbits in the warren by plugging up escape holes and pumping down poison gas. A small rabbit who escapes describes the carnage: Very soon the runs were crammed with rabbits clawing and clamber- ing over each other. They went up the runs they were accustomed to use and found them blocked. Some managed to turn around, but they couldn't get back because of the rabbits coming up. And then the runs began to be blocked lower down with dead rabbits and the live rabbits tore them to pieces. (160-61) The description is realistically resonant of the horrors of gas chambers. When he asks, innocently, if human beings hate rabbits, another rab- bit answers: "'That wasn't why they destroyed the warren. It was just because we were in their way. They killed us to suit themselves'" (163). From the perspective of advocates for nonhuman animals, systems appear relentlessly destructive. Their lack of emotion is crueler than even personal aggression would be. Maxine Kumin's poem "Woodchucks" also addresses the theme of systems and the death of individuals. Her poem gives a first-person account of a woman's attempt to rid her garden of woodchucks by sending cyanide gas down their burrows. The gassing does not work, and so the speaker describes herself shooting the woodchucks one by one, babies and mothers included. She says that one woodchuck survives- probably in her mind alone- keeping her "cocked and ready day after day after day." She ends her poem with the lines: "If only they'd consented to die unseen / gassed underground the quiet Nazi way." While the act of shooting woodchucks removes the speaker of the poem from the category of animal advocates, the poem "Woodchucks" illustrates how attention to nonhuman animals as individuals reveals</page><page sequence="8">128 ISLE the heartlessness of "systems." This poem must have been hard to write for a person who respects and cares for animals, as Kumin does. It is in this issue of emotion and sentiment that one of the most cru- cial differences between environmental and animal-centered narratives emerges. As J.M. Coetzee points out through his character Elizabeth Costello in The Lives of Animals, the ecological perspective as a system is almost Platonic. In the ecological vision [the character Costello says], the salmon and the river-weeds and the water-insects interact in a great, complex dance with the earth and the weather. The whole is greater than the sum of the parts. In the dance, each organism has a role: it is these multiple roles rather than the particular beings who play them, that participate in the dance. (53-54) The problem is that the "Platonic" vision like the one Coetzee's char- acter describes, would even allow humans to abuse animals, as long as the species or its function survives in the great dance. As Costello reminds us, however, "animals are not believers in ecology" (54). She also notes that humans, "the managers of the ecology [J [. . .] understand the greater dance[;] therefore we can decide how many trout may be fished or how many jaguar may be trapped before the stability of the dance is upset" (54). Against this kind of abstract thought, Costello pits the poetic vision that recognizes animal being. She cites Ted Hughes's "The Jaguar" as a poem that shows us how to "embody animals" (53). A proper reading of the poem relies on feeling and sentiment, some- thing that is typically missing in discussions of ecosystems; in fact, understanding the workings of ecosystems requires the suppression of emotion. More than that, readers of that poem, Costello says, "are for a brief while the jaguar." This is an imaginative feat: it is part of what makes us human and has a long history in cultures around the world. In the modern era, however, humans evade this path of knowledge because the conclusions we would have to draw once fully convinced of the reality of other animals' lives would leave us in the same condition as Coetzee's Elizabeth Costello- unable to live peaceably in the human world, or at least in a world arranged along the lines it is today.7 In contrast to Elizabeth Costello's isolation brought about by what others regard as an emotional eccentricity over her concern for what the world does to animals, including domestic ones, environmental writers will frequently chide themselves for their emotionalism in the face of natural processes. So Robert Finch, writing about an unusual cold spell in The Primal Place , confronts a "poor, ravaged bird brought into a museum where he works. The scaup is exhausted and dying, suffering so terribly that "it looked like some travesty of the life pro-</page><page sequence="9">"Animals are not believers in ecology" 129 cess, though its yellow-black eyes glared steadily and defiantly up at me in its extremity" (224). Clearly shaken and upset by the encounter, Finch next writes about the winter beach "glazed with a rim of death." Here he talks himself and the reader back into an understanding and acceptance of death as a natural process and concludes by noting that "Death is the stranded testament of life in these waters, and with it earth and sea create their endless, unsentimental poetry" (229). Presumably, bending over the dying scaup, Finch was displaying his sentimental, suspect side. Finch on the beach contemplating the "rim of death" is able to be unsentimental because death has become something that is remote from him: something contemplated in the abstract, through reason. It is something that happens to others. Nevertheless, the scene with the dying scaup belies the compla- cency of his vision of the "endless unsentimental poetry" of struggle on the beach. As he kneeled beside the scaup's box, "stroking its bony, exhausted body," he felt a "deep chill begin to spread through my limbs. It seemed to be growing terribly dark and cold around me. I felt the life draining out of me and into this dying bird, and was suddenly frightened to the bone. Forcing myself to my feet, I fled the build- ing [. . .] " (224). While death can be contemplated with a certain degree of equanimity when viewed as a "process," another reaction entirely emerges when it is viewed up close. The arrangement of the encounters in Finch's essay: the dying scaup, sympathy, fleeing, the walk along the beach, eventual acceptance and reconciliation, really gives us little in the way of new insight. These are old literary patterns: perhaps one might say that easy assurances are the real source of "sentimentality" here. One wonders how our understanding of these events might have been altered and shaken if Finch had chosen to place his encounter with the scaup after his walk on the beach, after sensing that death is a vis- ible sign of an "endless unsentimental poetry." Would his assurances have been as easily made? Or would we have been propelled into a dark and fantastic mystery, an unresolved problem of existence itself? What insight had he backed away from as he fled the suffering of the scaup? Is the appeal to the "unsentimental poetry" of nature, in fact, nothing more than a threadbare cliché? Henry Williamson's description of an otter's death by freezing pro- vides a useful contrast to Finch's musings about nature. Williamson wrote Tarka the Otter not long after the First World War when, as Eleanor Graham puts it, "he was out of love with mankind."8 His allegiances are with the otters, and thus his writing falls into the category of animal advocacy. The otters' suffering causes him grief; he experiences no ambivalence, and evinces no efforts to evade the sadness that comes with their pains and terrors. He describes a hard and desperately cold</page><page sequence="10">130 ISLE winter, when the "Icicle Spirit" comes to the land and starving, freez- ing animals and birds are left weak and helpless. In the midst of this cruel season, a dog otter, Marland Jimmy, meets up with the otters Tarka and Greymuzzle: slow and fatigued, after weeks of hunger, came Marland Jimmy, the old dog with his split ear who had played the funnel-game with Tarka's mother in the deep clay pit. He limped along the otterpath, which many pads had pressed into ice; the cysts between his toes [. . .] were raw and frostbitten. (108-09) Marland Jimmy has a last meal on a salmon Tarka has found. Fortified, he plays on an otter slide with Tarka, slipping down "on his ruined feet" (110); and then Tarka goes back to the salmon. In the freezing cold and deepening darkness, "Marland Jimmy played alone at the slide" (110). The next dawn finds an Arctic Owl, Bubu, sitting on something at the bottom of the slide, [. . .] something that swayed and creaked to its weight, but bore it up- right. Staring around with several complete turns of his head, Bubu fixed orange-rimmed eyes on a mask set stiff before and below it. There was no movement; there was no life. The owl stared round again, and flew away, as though nodding to the head of Marland Jimmy gazing film-eyed out of the ice. (Ill) Williamson makes no attempt to rationalize the death of the dog otter. In brief and spare strokes, he gains our sympathy for Marland Jimmy: the fact that he is a named individual, his agedness, his ruined feet, his suffering, his playfulness- and then he lets the otter's death by freezing hit us squarely in the face. Marland Jimmy's death is clearly a part of nature, as is the death of Finch's scaup. Unlike Finch, however, Williamson does not offer philosophical consolation. Indeed, because his focus is the individual otter rather than the processes of nature, he allows us to open ourselves up to the reality of Marland Jimmy's suffering and death. Life for our fellow creatures is often unbearably hard, and the fact that human actions have often made it even harder is something Williamson leaves the careful reader to contemplate. Only through our emotions and imagination, however, can we rec- ognize the being of other animals. This is true not only of poetry and the arts, but also of the sciences. Foremost ethologist Konrad Lorenz felt that animals could not be studied effectively unless the observer felt affection for them. Frans de Waal explains Lorenz's position: The maestro of observation, Konrad Lorenz, didn't believe one could effectively investigate an animal that one didn't love. Because our in-</page><page sequence="11">"Animals are not believers in ecology" 131 tuitive understanding of animals is based on human emotions and a sense of connection with animals, he wrote in Foundations of Ethology (1981) that understanding seems quite separate from the methodology of the natural sciences. To marry intuitive insight with systematic data collection is both the challenge and the joy of the study of animal behaviour. (39) Having something relevant and truthful to say about nonhuman animals, then, relies on the observer's friendly feelings, or even love, for them as individuals. In this respect our relationship with nonhuman animals differs significantly from our relationship with the environ- ment: we cannot know nonhuman animals sufficiently in the absence of emotional and personal connectedness. We would go further to add that it is only through the imagined apprehension of the reality of other individual beings that our relationship to the world can be transformed. The problem is a critical bias that continues to view such emotionalism as "sentimental" and false, making us uneasy with any portrayal of an animal that steps outside of a Platonic understanding. As a contrast to this grim vision, one can turn to biologist E.O. Wilson's "biophilia hypothesis" which, simply, indicates that there exists "an innately emotional affiliation of human beings to other animals"(165). The fact that Wilson goes on to illustrate his hypothesis with the example of human loathing for snakes detracts from the very term "biophilia." Nevertheless, as a concept, biophilia could go some distance towards repairing the rift between the environmentalist's systems approach to nature and the animal advocate's emotional al- legiance with individual nonhuman animals. Repairing that rift is a desirable objective because, after all, both movements wish to effect the changes that would create a better world for both human and nonhuman animals. While the human character in an environmental work frequently appears as a rather inoffensive observer and non participant in the natural world: nature's eyeball, as it were, authors focusing on animals frequently and quite frankly depict human beings as destroyers. Ani- mal advocacy literature, as does environmental literature, realizes that humans have excluded themselves from the natural world. Literature which advocates for animals, however, concludes that humans play a role of enmity rather than advocacy to many of the world's other spe- cies. In the literary field, feelings expressed for nonhuman animals can lead to an aversion to many aspects of human conduct and even to the human species itself- as is seen in Coetzee's example of Elizabeth Coestello. Given the history of our relations with nonhuman animals, one could hardly expect a writer whose allegiance is with animals to have any other conception of the human species. Some very hard scenes</page><page sequence="12">132 ISLE of human brutality indeed appear in the writing of animal advocates- particularly in animal stories. With humankind cast as the enemy, and with human acts appearing incomprehensibly vicious from the animal's perspective, it would be incorrect to say that the dominant mode in animal advocates' writing about animals is merely sentimental. Rather it spills over into much stronger emotions. The last scenes of Allan W. Eckert's The Great Auk are tragic, and leave the reader with feelings of rage. The last scenes, of course, describe the deaths of the very last great auks, a mated pair with one precious egg. Throughout the long story, Eckert has followed the progress of the great auk who is to be the last of his species. This great auk witnesses the unrelenting slaughter of his kind by brutal men with clubs. He barely escapes a hail of shrapnel from ordnances fired for no apparent reason from distant ships, which kills some more of the dwindling numbers of great auks. Incredibly, he has found and mated with a female. And then the men with the clubs come to his island again: As the female darted between two of [the men] and headed for the cliff edge a bloody club streaked down in a vicious arc and crushed her skull. She was dead before her body stopped rolling. The great auk managed to elude the swings of two men and then was hit a glancing blow by the third. He rolled over, scrambled to his feet, and then continued his pitiful wobbling run toward the cliff edge. The men rushed in pursuit- and one of them, intent only upon the great auk's fleeing form, stepped on the single large egg and crushed it into an obscene yellow stain on the gray rock. Only a dozen feet separated the great auk from the edge now, but it was too much. A whistling blow from a club slammed into his neck, shattering bones and stopping him permanently. (125-26) Environmentalists similarly deplore the extinction of species on several grounds: for the sake of biodiversity, for aesthetic or spiritual reasons, or for potential future human interests. Peter Matthiessen, for example, momentarily wearing the conservationist's hat, also revisits the scene of the killing of the last auk, and tries to find reasons beyond pure outrage to protest the extinction of any species: For most of us, its passing is unimportant. The auk, from a practical point of view, was doubtless a dim-witted inhabitant of Godforsaken places, a primitive and freakish thing, ill favored and ungainly. From a second and more enlightened viewpoint, the great auk was the mightiest of its family, a highly evolved fisherman and swimmer, an</page><page sequence="13">"Animals are not believers in ecology" 133 ornament to the monotony of northern seas, and for centuries a crucial food source for the natives of the Atlantic coast. (21) Conservation issues such as these have no place at all in the scene Eckert describes. Unlike Matthiessen, who categorizes in a fairly utili- tarian way, what the loss of the great auk means to humans, Eckert presents us with an image of humans crashing into the great auk's home space and stupidly eliminating the last of the species. Eckert is telling the story from the auk's point of view; the issue is entirely moral, not managerial, and the reader is induced to feel both anguish for the individual auk and, even more tellingly, shame for the human species. The idea that human beings could ever imagine themselves capable of managing the environment receives a set back from scenes like these in animal advocacy literature. Even where extinction seems a distant possibility, animal advocates depict human conduct towards nonhuman animals as bizarrely hostile, and the human species as almost surreal. Sticking strictly to the otter's point of view in Tarka the Otter, Henry Williamson anatomizes otter hunters (14). Terrorized by human hunters and otter hounds, Tarka swims underwater through the legs and poles of the otter hunters, and looks up to see the audience to the hunt as "palsied and distorted shapes on the bank" (231). Humans announce their arrival in the ot- ters' world with the awful cry of "Tally-Ho." At one point, Williamson cannot resist sarcasm over the merriment implicit for the hunters in that cry. Tarka has escaped, and the fury and terror of the hunt has subsided. Peace begins to return to the scene as Tarka glides down a stream towards a bridge: The parapet before and above him was a smooth line across the sky, except for a wagtail's pied body, the tops of three polypody ferns, the head and shoulders of an old grey-bearded man in a blue coat, and a black empty beer-bottle. Tally-Ho! (216) Tarka has managed to live at peace with human beings. He copes with wheelhouses, quarries, logging operations, spilled chemicals, and dis- carded junk. Humans, however, keep bringing horror into his world and- incomprehensibly- finding it fun to do so. Scenes of the deaths of otters in Tarka the Otter have similar emotional effects to the scene of the great auk's death in Eckert's story. Tarka's cub Tarquol dies in a patch of yellow hawkbits, "trodden on and wrenched and broken, while the screaming cheers and whoops of sportsmen mingled with the growling rumble of hounds at worry" (227). Tarka himself dies off-scene, underwater, while the hunters watch the bubbles</page><page sequence="14">134 ISLE of his final breaths rise to the surface. Tarka the Otter is hardly a tale for children, although it is published as such. Readers of animal advocacy literature have to steel themselves for scenes of even more wanton and obscene human behaviour towards nonhuman animals. In her novel The White Bone , which follows the story of an elephant troop, Barbara Gowdy shows an ivory poacher removing with a chain saw the tiny tusk of a young female he has just mowed down with bullets, along with most of her family, and then placing that tusk between his legs and pumping his hips (89). As another poacher approaches a still living elephant, he says, "'I don't believe I've had the pleasure!'" to an elephant named She-Sees, and then shoots She-Sees in the face (89). Another poacher leaps on the back of a panicking young elephant and "kicks her so brutally her forelegs buckle" (87). It is in the depiction of human conduct that animal advocacy scores its most compelling points on behalf of nonhuman animals, and indeed on behalf of the natural world as a whole. Nonhuman animals are also perceiving entities in the natural world. They observe humankind and find us bewildering and terrifying. Had trees and rocks and landscapes the same capacity, they might well assess our conduct similarly. Here, however, lies the problem for animal advocates. Quibblers can argue with some legitimacy that anthropomorphism is rampant in literature focusing on the nonhuman animal's perspective. Though opponents might accept that human beings abuse animals as animal advocates say they do, they might argue that nonhuman animals do not see or experience our mistreatment as cruel. They might argue that the "ugly human" found in animal stories is merely the product of the writer's sentimental attachment to nonhuman animals and has nothing to do with what nonhuman animals themselves perceive. Indeed, a particu- larly sophistical opponent could observe that writers who attribute such a range of experiences to nonhuman animals violate the otherness of animalkind. While the naturalism of works like Eckert's The Great Auk and Williamson's Tarka inherently defeats charges of anthropomorphism, certain elements of Gowdy's The White Bone are especially likely to generate such charges. Gowdy attributes mystical qualities to her animal subjects, and imagines animals within an animal group going into trances and seeing visions of the future. Gowdy lends her animals myths and legends, and shows them speaking to each other in proper English sentences. Granted, these cultural attributes assist the writer in the creation of a story for nonhuman animals, but opponents can argue that writers like Gowdy have gone too far in their efforts to coun- teract the historical denial of intelligence and emotional complexity to nonhuman animals.</page><page sequence="15">"Animals are not believers in ecology" 135 Animal advocates can counter these charges with a number of ob- servations. First of all, human "knowledge" of nonhuman animals has been skewed by a need to defend exploitation of nonhuman animals and indifference to their interests. Human knowledge cannot be com- pletely trusted. Furthermore, human beings have been proven wrong about animals. Animals are clearly not unthinking "machines." This does not mean that one should believe that at some time in the future it will be scientifically proven that nonhuman animals actually share language or have mystical visions. Rather, the point is to challenge human "knowledge" by imagining other possibilities. Readers come away from the humanized animal better prepared to behave sym- pathetically or empathetically with the actual animals we see in the real world. Why? Because stories like The White Bone have prepared us to spot similarities between human and nonhuman animals more readily than we might have done had we remained entrenched in the putatively "objective" view. At the same time, they have moved us to acknowledge and confront the injuries human beings do to individual animals and to all of animal kind. In this sense, animal advocates who center their stories on nonhu- man animals take us out of ourselves as fully as Coetzee's character Elizabeth Costello says Ted Hughes's poem "The Jaguar" does. It might be going too far to say that we "become" Tarka or the last great auk or Gowdy's elephants. We do, however, as we read, engage with them as completely as if they were human characters, and this means that their suffering at human hands elicits from us the same range of emotional response that we can experience when we read about hu- man suffering. Harold Bloom has suggested that Shakespeare invented the human. He writes, "To call Shakespeare a 'creator of language,' as Wittgenstein did, is insufficient, but to call Shakespeare also a 'creator of charac- ters,' and even a 'creator of thought,' is still not enough. Language, character, all are part of Shakespeare's invention of the human, and yet the largest part is the passional." (733). By passional, Bloom means the essential drama acted out between families: parents and children, brothers and sisters, husbands and wives- the dramas that make us, quite literally, human. In an age of environmental crisis, it is urgent that we seek an analo- gous invention, only now we seek the invention a language which will help us extend our sense of family beyond the human. Many contem- porary writers are striving to create the language which can describe the passion of a shared family of living beings. This is an odd task, perhaps, for literary studies, but a crucial one in an era when it is no longer possible to take any living thing for granted.</page><page sequence="16">136 ISLE The differences between the two strands of thought- literature which advocates for the environment and literature which advocates for animals- are important to recognize and acknowledge at a time when many of the insights that once challenged the status quo have now become rhetorical commonplaces: ideas generally so well accepted that they now appear obvious and self-evident. No one would claim that "pollution" is a good thing; few would dispute the idea that humans are a part of nature. According to some students of rhetoric, appeals to such commonplaces as these, however, in fact act to preclude real discussion or understanding of important issues. It might be that we are now poised at the outset of an age when other avenues are needed to convey a radical sense of the relationship underlying concern for all sorts of issues affecting the natural world and humans. We need, in other words, different ways to express our sense of the embodied human condition. For this reason, looking at the differences between environmental literature and literature focused on animals opens up the possibility of revitalizing an "environmental" discourse that is in the process of being captured by other, less benign political and economic interests, while at the same time demonstrating that the insights of scientific thought can be used to enrich our sense of the reality of animal life. A comparison of environmental writing and animal advocacy writ- ing bears out the kinds of differences environmentalists and animal rights activists themselves observe. An eco-systems approach to nature can emotionally exempt human beings from the picture by appeal- ing to the "unsentimental poetry of nature," or to an animal as food source. The literature of animal advocacy, on the other hand, directs our emotional allegiances towards individual animals, but tends not to offer guidance as to how and where to discharge the anger against human cruelty that it creates. It is our sense that neither literature has yet arrived at an inclusive vision for it seems that our habit of viewing the human species as a special and privileged creation is too deeply ingrained in us for any credible literature of this age to offer a radical alternative. Indeed, even after decades of analyzing our relations with nature, we have at best only realized and lamented our own alienation from the natural world. If anything, the differences noted in this article, between environ- mentalists and animal advocates, are even more marked and salient in literature than the differences which emerge between the two move- ments on philosophical, ethical, and political fronts. For both environ- mental and animal advocate writers, the family of nature seems to con- tinue to exclude humanity. On the one hand we see nature through the privileged eyes of an observer: on the other we see ourselves through</page><page sequence="17">"Animals are not believers in ecology" 137 the anguished eyes of animals. But if environmental literature seems at times to express the sense that human beings are not emotionally implicated in what happens to the natural world, and animal advocacy literature views humans as the enemy, we need only be reminded that we, too, are animals for both the remote vision of the ecosystems and the up-close emotive attachment to nonhuman animals to click into place with each other. A "sentimental" regard for nature and natural beings is not "anti-nature." We do not have to affect an unsentimental attitude to apprehend the reality of the natural world. A clue to the reconciliation of environmental writing and literature focusing on nonhuman animals exists in Coleridge's "Ancient Mariner." The sudden transformation whereby the ancient mariner blesses the water snakes "unaware" affirms the value of human emotional con- nectedness to the natural world and the beings living in it. Biodiversity matters because, as the mariner reveals, we love nature the way it is. We have a capacity to love even creatures who intellectually seem repellent to us. The mariner's epiphany changes the entire world. The albatross he had killed drops from his neck. The wind comes up and the ghost ship on which he was becalmed, day after weary day, begins to move again on its homeward journey. Perhaps the future literature of the nonhuman- one which marries environmental insight with the emotional commitment of animal advocacy- will have the same urgency and aspiration as Coleridge's poem and will be able to point to the same kind of life-altering epiphany. NOTES 1. Rachel Carson's 1962 book Silent Spring graphically illustrated each of these ideas. 2. See, for example, Tom Regan, The Case for Animal Rights ; Paolo Cavalieri and Peter Singer, eds., The Great Ape Project: Equality Beyond Humanity ; David Degrazia, Taking Animals Seriously: Mental Life and Moral Status ; and Joan Du- nayer, Animal Equality : Language and Liberation. 3. Underscoring this difference is the existence of distinct groups of actors with distinctly different spheres of interest: crusaders for nonhuman animals and protectors of the environment. Furthermore, there are different levels of support for the two groups. Consulting firms, governmental bodies, regula- tions, impact assessments, large environmental groups such as Greenpeace, as well as legal bodies, academic departments, and eco-critics all devote their energies to correcting environmental ills. Collectively they suggest that environmentalism has made some progress in inching towards mainstream acceptance, with public, institutional, and bureaucratic support for protecting the environment. In contrast, animal rights advocates, though having a longer history, continue to have the status of outsiders in the Euro-Western context</page><page sequence="18">138 ISLE in spite of the fact that individuals have spoken up on behalf of animals for centuries. Vegetarianism, religious belief, the keeping of companion animals- all or any one of these may explain the appearance of individuals from the time of Pythagoras willing to speak out against cruelty to and exploitation of animals. For historical information on appeals for kindness to nonhuman animals, see Keith Thomas, Man and the Natural World : Changing Attitudes in England 1500-1800, Dix Harwood, Love for Animals and How It Developed in Great Britain , Rod Preece Animals and Nature: Cultural Myths, Cultural Realities, and John Passmore, "The Treatment of Animals." Finally, while environmentalism can appeal to human self-interest, the animal rights movement cannot be billed as human-centered because animal rights are not "for" humans; in fact, animal rights might be interpreted as being "against" humans in as much as granting any number or kind of rights to nonhuman animals means that humans will have to give up something: the hope of a cure for human diseases, the steak or hamburger, the use of animal habitats, the "right" to manipulate animal genes to create the "spinach-pigs" or "spider-goats" which are to bring ever more benefits to humanity. Nothing material accrues to us from showing kindness or respect to nonhuman animals, or in the case of bio-enginering, restraining ourselves from violating an animal's integrity. Even the most conservative side of the animal movement, which advocates animal welfare rather than animal rights, suggests that humans should go out of their way, not for our sake, but for the sake of nonhumans. 4. See Beyond Nature Writing: Expanding the Boundaries of Ecocriticism, ed. Karla Armbruster and Kathleen R. Wallace. 5. For more nuanced discussions of this insight see Michel Foucault's, The Order of Things, Neil Evernden's The Social Creation of Nature, and Jacques Der- rida "The Animal That Therefore I Am (More to Follow)." 6. Note, for example, the horror present in the "reportage" sections of Allan W. Eckerťs The Great Auk in which he describes the massacre of thousands of birds. Note, also, the pathos inherent in the ever diminishing numbers of great auks as they are slaughtered by hunters or destroyed by wanton sprays of shrapnel. 7. J. Baird Callicotťs argument against vegetarianism in "Animal Libera- tion: A Triangular Affair" illustrates the essential ethical difference between environmental and animal rights approaches. Callicott is arguing explicitly against conceiving of nonhuman animals as individuals for ethically sound environmental purposes. It is not surprising, then, that he would attempt to undermine one the key platforms of animal rights advocacy. Callicott admits that a vegetarian diet would be more efficient than an animal-based one- an argument animal rights advocates have used to suggest the environmental importance of vegetarianism. Callicott goes on to argue, however, that with that increased efficiency- should the entire human population adopt vegetarian- ism-the human population would increase. Because humans have "far more elaborate" requirements in life than nonhuman species, the net result would be fewer nonhuman species. "A vegetarian human population is therefore probably ecologically catastrophic," he says (57). He does not contemplate the option of human beings curbing their populations; and perhaps- practically speaking- his is right that our anthropocentrism and selfishness would pro-</page><page sequence="19">"Animals are not believers in ecology" 139 duce such a result. Nevertheless, it is curious that the "big picture" approach should, in Callicott's mind, support the status quo and permit human beings to carry on doing what they have always done because that is in the best interests of the environment. The question of diet, of what we put in our mouths, often appears to provoke the most desperate and defensive responses. 8. "How the Book Came to be Written," Introduction to Tarka the Otter.
