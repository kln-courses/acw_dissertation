<plain_text><page sequence="1">MISCELLANEOUS COMMUNICATIONS AN-NAMTA This sect is mentioned with the Raficja, IbdcjUya, and Hashwiya by al-Jahiz. The Kitab al Intisdr, besides naming them with the Rafida, Murji'a, and Mujabbira, gives some details about them. Most of them agreed with the Mu'tazila in revering the Companions, though this was not true of some who lived in Syria. They recognized the legitimacy of Mu'dwiya and the Umayyads, but this did not interfere with the great respect they felt for 'All. Their theology was mixed. They held that God could not do injustice nor send good men (inhabitants of heaven) to hell, and that the question whether He could do what He had said He would not do was an absurdity. They held that God knows with an eternal knowledge. On the other hand, they were like the Rafi&lt;Ja in having anthropomorphic ideas about God, and in being determinists. They differed from the Mu'tazila in their ideas on irjd9 and the Koran. They also criticized the doctrines of Ja'far b. Mubashshir. So it would appear that Zamakhshari was wrong in saying that the N&amp;bita were Hashwiya. They were hardly a sect or school ; their ideas were not eclectic but undigested ; they were searching for a theology and had not found out that they were trying to hold incompatible views.1 This suggests a correction in the Fihrist. In the title of the third section of the fifth discourse (p. 179) are the words : \j?jA i**lj '{jJ^\ "the Mujabbira and the wonder of the Hashwiya ". The author does not usually put criticism in his chapter headings, the singular " wonder " is strange, so it is natural to read Ndbita, a change of dots only. 68. A. S.
