This survey enables Smith to discover what he calls the "signature of the age" (pp. 31 ff.). This was a widespread paranoia, manifested in a paranoid style in politics among the politically sig- nificant classes. The actors in Smith's drama were characters laden with fear, suspicion, obsessive sensitivity, black mistrust, and even melancholia. Oddly enough, they were found out because they lacked the wit to practice what was essential in the politics of faction and conspiracy: secrecy and discretion. This in itself is a disturbing sign, and it inspires curiosity about the exact understanding of the term "paranoia" held by Smith. The word occurs as early as Aeschylus (Theb. 756), where it has the sense of mental derangement of a kind associated with delirium. But the modern usage in clinical and diagnostic work stems from 1883, when E. P. Spitzka defined it in the manner adopted clinically by Karl Ludwig Kahlbaum: a gradually developing, systematized, delusional state, without hallucination, with preservation of intelligence, and with a range of emotional responses and overt behavior consistent with the persecutory or grandiose delusions. In contemporary manuals of psychiatry many forms of paranoia are distinguished, a thing important in itself but of special relevance here. Smith's reductive and generalized term seems to func- tion at times to describe quite different clinical conditions-for example, the involutional paranoia of the Earl of Essex, a form of melancholia and not at all the same as the paranoia querulans exhibited by merely litigious persons or the reformatory paranoia that seems to be at the heart of the matter in the case of traitors who acted out of profound concern over disorder in the cosmos. Even more central is a point made long ago by Richard von Krafft-Ebing when he distinguished original paranoia developed before puberty from acquired paranoia, a condition developing later in life and closely tied to involutional states. I make these points because of their obvious relevance to the thesis I must now describe in some detail. Smith's simple use of the term covers the behavior of such diverse men as the Howard Earl of Surrey and the bungler Botolf, who was wading in very deep waters with a very shallow wit. Smith has the support of G. R. Elton, the late W. K. Jordan, Muriel St. Clare Byrne, and others in reporting the " manifest incompetence" of his clutch of traitors (p. 31). He also quotes much anecdotal evidence-for example, to show that some thought Dr. Parry a "little mad" and that others said the same of Seymour. Moreover, he cites various authors to support the contention that the traitors shared "unbelievable stu- pidity" (p. 32). What matters is the general paranoid "signature," however. History is im- mune to psychoanalysis, Smith reminds us-a claim, by the way, just now given a full examination in volume 13, number 2 of the journal Critical Inquiry, especially in the essay by Dominick LaCapra, "History and Psychoanalysis" (pp. 222-51). By this immunity I think he means we cannot put single subjects on the couch, which makes it difficult to refute any one judgment about political actors rooted in "the tortured chambers" of the single mind. But we may seek the cause of irrational behavior by self-destructive traitors in some external conditions-for example, in an educational system and a climate of opinion that forged links in a chain that fettered minds with "misconceptions, hysteria, fears, and suspicions" of a kind that made them incapable of taking the right action at the right moment (p. 32). This right action would have recognized the social definition of acceptable political behavior, in an age innocent of any</page><page sequence="3">360 Book Reviews grasp of the deeper economic and social causes of discontent (p. 33). Hence, for Smith, the explanation of Tudor treasons must lie in an understanding of the "psychological, social and human links of the chain that entangled and hampered the loyal and the disloyal alike . . . the entire sink and puddle of sixteenth century politics'' (p. 33). Agreeing with Lawrence Stone's claim in The Crisis of the Aristocracy, 1558- 1641 (London, 1967) that among all classes in Tudor England behavior was ferocious, childish, and lacking in self-control, Smith propounds three ques- tions: Why was there so much treason? Why was treason so ineptly done? and Why was inept conspiracy so seriously regarded? His answer is that Tudor England was nearly always ill, that it had its own peculiar forms of pathology expressed in the underlying character structure of its people, and that it exhibited its own special form of neurosis (p. 35). In chapters 2-6, each of them attractively titled and brilliantly written ("The Black Poison of Suspect," "The Agreement of Its Minds," "Tudor Cosmology and Commonality," "The World Is Queasy," and "A Wonder to Behold"), we find the heart of Smith's argument about the entangling chain. As the ties of lordship and kinship declined and as revolutionary tensions arose from the actions of the monarchy itself, bonds of friendship evaporated, and in their place we find the sixteenth-century doctrine of "the enemy"- free, demonic, unfettered by a natural limit or the mechanism of history. The existence of this "enemy" drew support from nearly every facet of the educational system and child rearing and brought to Tudor politics "a quality of paranoia" lacking even in today's cutthroat business world (pp. 56-57). Deceit, skepticism, irony, dialectical opposition, and other qualities were inculcated by advice literature; by the agonistic mode of humanist education just then coming to domination; by social institutions in which obedience, decorum, and self-control were honored more in the breach than in the observance; by a life within families in which children were beaten, terrified, and threatened from all sides; by the rise of a sense of self hedged in by the necessity of dissembling; and by the formal rhetorical mode of education in which dispositio, inventio, and elecutio combined to sponsor a "paranoid style of thinking" in the young men aged thirteen to seventeen who were heirs to power (p. 101). The "education in paranoia" typical of the age made certain that every mature man had his lago, just as the Tudor cosmology and associated ideas encouraged every small boy to see himself as the field on which God and Lucifer waged a struggle for his soul, and thus confirmed the "paranoid sig- nature of the age." This signature revealed itself in the apocalyptic style of thought common in Tudor England, which was animistic, anthropomorphic, and egocentric. People were literally overwhelmed by a system of both edu- cation and socialization in which catastrophe was imminent and in which failure was necessary, but which also encouraged people to find the cause outside of the self, in demonology, and above all in the conspiracy of the enemy. "Paranoia in the sense of willingness to assume the existence of an outside agent endowed either with demonic powers to injure or with rational cunning to lead the innocent and unwary astray was part of the psychological signature of the age" (p. 133). I take this to signify that Tudor narratives of the self exhibited a cataclysmic character. Externally, Smith's argument relies on the revival of the notion that the Tudor political system may have been "totalitarian in aim if not in function" (p. 160).</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews 361 In the seventh through the ninth chapters, all threads are drawn together in a subtle and brilliant portrait of the archtraitor of the age-Elizabeth's favorite, Robert Devereaux, the Earl of Essex. This essay in biography clarifies the aim of the book as a whole, joining to the statement of the problem and the essay in cultural history a close study of a man beset by "paranoid delusions" and doomed to maladjustment in a difficult and treacherous place (p. 276). But based on Smith's account, we have a classic case of original paranoia in evidence in the pubescent Essex. And we also have explicit statements about the involutional and melancholic character of the earl. One is curious to know how the general thesis about the educational system that is made to account for Essex can also hold for those Henricians who came up under a different system-in particular, the peers who had no formal education, much less a university one. That Smith himself recognizes the fragility of his main thesis about Tudor minds-that they were organized in terms of sharp dialectical oppositions, right and wrong, friend and enemy, supporter and opponent-as an explanation of Tudor treason is clear from the discussion at the beginning of chapter 6, "A Wonder to Behold." Based on his argument, medieval society should have been beset by the same paranoid fears, by virtue of the shared cosmology and the revival in it of the classical principles of dialectic and rhetoric he finds at the heart of the Tudor educational system. The rise of the secular state is not in itself enough to explain the difference, he admits. Yet the argument holds, he thinks; and in saying why, he adverts to the thesis associated with the late Richard Hofstadter on the paranoid style in American politics. Historical change and social psychology march together. Minorities who tend to view the world through "paranoid coloured glasses" surge and retreat in the face of real social tensions and real political conflicts. These threaten cherished beliefs and tra- ditional habits of action in the politically valid classes. The resultant tensions can only be resolved by violence, as catastrophe and the fear of it elicit the syndrome of paranoid rhetoric which itself stokes the fires of action. It would take another review of equal length for me to spell out fully what I think critics will have to attend to in trying to adjust their sense of the age to the challenge of Smith's book. But I can at least point to some directions for further research and raise some deep doubts about the structure of the argument and the evidence in support of it. On the historical side, recent research on the early modern English family, for which a convenient summary exists in Ralph A. Houlbrooke's book (The English Family, 1450-1700 [London, 1984]), tells very strongly against the Stone-Smith line of argument. Margo Todd's studies of humanist educational practices and ideas throw an entirely different and more optimistic light on the end results of the process and on the formation of family values in particular. J. G. Bellamy's recent study of changes in law and process in criminal cases including treasons indicates the possibility of a radically different construction of the causes and explanations of sedition and treason, lending support to the work of Elton and his students.' It is also crucial to notice that Smith makes I Margo Todd, "Humanists, Puritans, and the Spiritualized Household," Church His- tory 49 (1980): 18-34; "Erasmus and the Elizabethan Arts Course," Proceedings of the Eighth International Conference on Patristic, Medieval, and Renaissance Studies 8 (1984): 53-60; and, more recently, Christian Humanism and the Puritan Social Order (Cam- bridge, 1987).

One wonders what the deposi- tions, inquisitions, and trials for which evidence survives in K.B. 8, K.B. 9, and K.B. 33, among other classes, would show about the minds of the many ordinary folk who fell afoul of the treason laws without benefit of the more sophisticated education at the heart of the explanation for "the black poison of suspect" given here. This last is perhaps the most important point, for if Smith's reconstruction of Tudor political psychology is largely accurate, then one would expect Tudor treason narratives in general to exhibit the main features of what Ernest Keen has called "cataclysmic narratives." Clearly, the surviving manuscript evidence should be examined with this in mind. In addition, the book under review would have been greatly strengthened in its handling of the main thesis about paranoia had Smith considered Keen's earlier work, Three Faces of Being: Toward an Existential Clinical Psychology (New York, 1970), as well as E. M. Lemert's seminal article "Paranoia and the Dynamics of Exclusion" (Sociom- etry 25 [1962]: 2-20). Keen's great and groundbreaking essay "Paranoia and Cataclysmic Narratives" (in Narrative Psychology: The Storied Nature of Hu- man Conduct, ed. Theodore R. Sarbin [New York, 1986], pp. 174-90) builds on earlier studies of the content and modes of stories told by paranoids as they wrestle with the experience of living on the edge between a past they regard as hopeful and a future they regard as hopeless. Keen's work is of central relevance to Smith's contribution to Tudor cultural history, for Smith's main concern, if I have not misread his thesis, is with lives lived on the edge. Few studies have illuminated such lives more powerfully than Keen's work on the occurrence of dialectical pairing (good-evil, self-other, chaos-order, past-future) in the tales told by paranoids in actual clinical situations. The further clarifi- cation of such issues on the psychological side will be central to our final estimation of this stimulating and gracefully written book. ARTHUR J.
