Subject Areas: behaviour, cognition, evolution 1. Introduction We humans have the distinctive feeling of being able mentally to pre-experience Keywords: future events. We readily and continually make plans for future goals. Many mental time travel, episodic memories, think of this cognitive future orientation as one of our most advanced, and unique, cognitive feats. Future-oriented cognition, in a sense, presents a puzzle for cognitive science: the future does not exist, neither does backward causation [1]. The future cannot influence a current behaviour or thought. Notions such as foresight or future orientation are mere metaphors from the Author for correspondence: spatial domain. Cognition is always based on past causation: the products of Mathias Osvath evolution, ontogeny and individual experiences. At the same time, anticipating e-mail: mathias.osvath@lucs.lu.se and influencin8 future outcomes is at the core of cognition and probably the main reason why cognition evolved. Few would disagree that, for cognition to have evolved, it must have given organisms a readiness that affects their future. Numerous researchers regard the brain as essentially a prediction making simulator of the environment [2]. If one cannot think about the future in any real sense, i.e. being causally affected by it, and if cognition evolved to prepare organisms for forthcoming changes, what is the meaning in contemporary research of terms such as 'foresight' or 'future-oriented cognition'? The past decade has witnessed an upsurge in studies on future-oriented cognition in human and, not the least, non-human ani mals. However—as is usually the case in fledgling research—no all-encompassing definitions of the core phenomena exist, although one finds some agreement over which criteria qualify cognitive processes as 'more' future-oriented than others. One overarching criterion—to which most other criteria relate—is flexibility [3,4]. The behaviours must link to possible upcoming events in a non-stereotypical way, taking into account specific elements or novel combinations of those elements. Such behaviours are more easily understood as what they are not: purely innately released or merely associatively learned responses.

The future of future-oriented cognition in non-humans: theory and the empirical case of the great apes Mathias Osvath and Gema Martin-Ordas Cognitive Science, Lund University, Lund, Sweden One of the most contested areas in the field of animal cognition is non-human future-oriented cognition. We critically examine key underlying assumptions in the debate, which is mainly preoccupied with certain dichotomous positions, the most prevalent being whether or not 'real' future orientation is uniquely human. We argue that future orientation is a theoretical construct threatening to lead research astray. Cognitive operations occur in the present moment and can be influenced only by prior causation and the environment, at the same time that most appear directed towards future outcomes. Regarding the current debate, future orientation becomes a question of where on various continua cog nition becomes 'truly' future-oriented. We question both the assumption that episodic cognition is the most important process in future-oriented cognition and the assumption that future-oriented cognition is uniquely human. We review the studies on future-oriented cognition in the great apes to find little doubt that our closest relatives possess such ability. We conclude by urging that future-oriented cognition not be viewed as expression of some select set of skills. Instead, research into future-oriented cognition should be approached more like research into social and physical cognition. © 2014 The Author(s)</page><page sequence="2">must, in some sense—again metaphorically—be more proac- the temporally dual nature of the episodic system and, more tive than reactive.

The episodic system This is one example of how the question of phenomenal experience draws attention away from the central question (a) Consciousness and mental time travel of how memories and future-oriented cognition work, turning The theoretical roots of much of the contemporary cognitive- it instead into a dichotomous question about human unique foresight research lie in memory research. In 1972, Tulving [7] pro- ness (for similar ideas, see [19]). As a remedy, we wish to posed a distinction between semantic and episodic memory, point out why the study of animal episodic systems should where semantic memory is our database of knowledge about not (currently) be part of the study of animal consciousness, the world. It does not register perceptible properties of inputs, Subjective experience is justly treated with caution in animal but rather the cognitive referents of such inputs. Episodic cognition research for two main reasons. The first is the lack of a memory, on the other hand, receives and stores information on detailed model for what, in computational or neurological temporally structured episodes or events, along with the spatio- terms, constitutes subjective experience. We cannot as yet, in temporal relationships between them, i.e. what happened, any scientifically useful sense, identify the physical principles where and when.

The second is our failure to only store perceptible properties, always in autobiographical refer- identify what subjective experience is for, either ultimately or ence to the already existing content of the episodic memory store. proximately.

No system allowing us mental travel backwards in time, implying firmly grounded theories as yet exist. The possibility arises a sense of past. One notable extension on the original model that subjective experience is a mere, non-functional by-product was that a certain form of consciousness is a necessary correlate of other processes. to episodic memories—what Tulving dubbed autonoetic ('self- These problems obviously also apply to humans.

With regards to the human epi with the semantic system, where knowledge about facts is not sodic system, this raises no concerns; it is valid to assume that subjectively tied but simply involves awareness of familiarity human episodic processes correlate to subjective experiences, of knowing, i.e. noetic consciousness. Difficulties arise when confusing correlation with causation. Tulving early on argued that episodic memory is not only Tulving [5] and Suddendorf &amp; Corballis [4] explicitly view sub oriented towards the past, but it also allows construction of jective experience as functional in episodic recollection and possible future events [9]. Meanwhile, Suddendorf &amp; Corballis foresight even though no empirical evidence exists showing [10] took Tulving's backward-time-travel metaphor further, what subjective experiences do, or whether they are mere epi coining the expression mental time travel both to emphasize phenomena.

Some have chology, introspection and cultural constructs of time than argued that the main evolutionary advantage of the episodic on any clear, objectively identifiable processes of temporality, system is enabling planning for the future [4,5].

Despite this, the semantic and the episodic past impressions, and if memories are part of future-oriented systems have been thought of as distinct, with the semantic cognition, the distinction between memory and foresight system preceding the episodic system in evolution [4,5], We blurs.

On the other hand, patients with simple experimental paradigm based on two rooms: one semantic dementia have been shown to have deficits in their room would contain a reward, the other the means to get future thinking [39]. Taken together, these clearly suggest it. Access to the rooms would be temporally separated: that both the semantic and episodic systems are necessary for having entered the 'reward' room, the chimpanzee could future-oriented cognition in humans. not immediately return to the room with the tools.
