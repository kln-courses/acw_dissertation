FRANKFURTER "Alone among the bizarre innovations of penitence," observed the Bollandist Hippolyte Delehaye in 1923, "that of Symeon the Stylite became an institution."2 Yet it has never been clear how far Symeon's spontaneous ascension of a pillar ca. 420 C.E. was, in fact, an innova- tion. For, three centuries earlier, the Greek author Lucian describes a pillar-climbing "cult" outside the walls of the great temple of Atargatis at Hierapolis, about 100 kilometers away from where Symeon would choose his spot. This paper will approach these two pillar cults in their own contexts in order to re-assess the reasons for and against their historical and religious connection. What I hope to contribute to this old debate is a new methodology, in consonance with new data, so as to articulate the question of "stylite continuity" in somewhat more mature terms than that of "pagan survivals." St. Symeon the Stylite We must rely primarily on two Vitae for the details of Symeon's life and for rationales of his behavior: Theodoret's History of the Monks of Syria (or the Historia Religiosa), composed in 444 C.E., fifteen years before Symeon's death, although posthumously updated by a disciple of Theodoret; and the Syriac Life of Symeon, a considerably longer and more fantastic hagiography, composed ca. 470. Each text plainly has its hagiographical format and apologetic biases, and each author drew upon and balanced a number of literary and charismatic models in his portrayal of Symeon. The Vitae thus require the full critical sensibilities of the religious historian.3 Symeon, born to a rural landed family of Northern Syria in 386, entered the monastic life quite early, and fast became a champion at ex- treme mortification, a peculiar speciality of Syrian asceticism.4 Travel-</page><page sequence="2">STYLITES AND PHALLOBATES ing from monastery to monastery in northern Syria, discomfiting other monks with his bizarre habits of penitence, Symeon began to seek places thoroughly removed from society for his ascetic activities. At one point he lodged in a cistern; another time he chained himself to the center-post of a round, mountain-top mandra, or sheep-fold, like the arm of a com- pass.5 But in Syria at this time ascetic prowess was a means to power, earning the title of Holy Man and fame as a healer, intercessor, magi- cian, and resolver of disputes for an entire region.6 It was because he was engulfed in a veritable sea of pilgrims and sup- pliants from throughout the Near East that Theodoret explains Symeon's retreat upwards, into the sky.' At first Symeon climbed onto a short pillar (hardly, one might say, a means of avoiding people); but in the course of the next forty or so years Symeon's gradually increased perch attained a height of over thirty feet. His fame spread even wider as he stood upon the pillar, a living statue visible for miles around. And thus his death in about 459 not only inspired battles over Symeon's relics,8 but soon thereafter a sizeable basilica was erected around the pillar, the Church of St. Symeon the Stylite. The solitary pillar, now covered under an enormous dome, from which extended four galleries spacious enough for entire desert tribes, became the core of a pilgrimage site of international renown. Certainly the continued magnetism of the pillar alone contributed to the institution of "stylitism" as an ascetic practice that hundreds more would imitate in the ensuing centuries. Lucian's Report of the Phallobates The Greek author Lucian, a native of rural Syria who went on to become the premier satirist of the second century C.E., is credited with having written our most important source on native Syrian religion of the Roman period, a document called De Dea Syria. The bulk of this document concerns the cult of the goddess Atargatis at Hierapolis, one of the main religious centers of Northern Syria lying about 180 kilometers almost due east of Antioch, near the Euphrates. Among the many details and anecdotes included in De Dea Syria we find this des- cription, which I quote in its entirety from the recent Attridge and Oden translation: 9 In the gateway [of the Hierapolis temple] stand the phalli [phalloil which Dionysus set up; they are 1800 feet high [sic]. A man climbs up one of these phalli twice each year and lives on the tip of the phallus for a period of 169</page><page sequence="3">DAVID T. M. FRANKFURTER seven days. This reason is given for the ascent. The populace believes that he communes with the gods on high and asks for blessings on all Syria, and the gods hear the prayers from nearby. Others think that this, too, is done because of Deucalion, as a memorial of that disaster when men went to the mountains and the highest of the trees out of terror at the flood. Now, these explanations seem unbelievable to me. I think that they do this as well for Dionysus. I make the conjecture for these reasons: Whoever erects phalli to Dionysus sets on them wooden men - for what reason I will not say. At any rate, it seems to me that the man climbs up in imitation of this wooden man. The ascent is like this: The man ties a short cord around himself and the phallus; then he goes up on pieces of wood attached to the phallus, large enough for his toes. As he ascends, he throws the cord up on both sides as though he were handling reins. If someone has not seen this but has seen those who climb the date palms either in Arabia or in Egypt or in some other place, then he knows what I mean. When he reaches the end of his climb, he lets down another cord which he has. This is a long one, and with it he hauls up what he wants, wood and clothes and utensils, from which he puts together a dwelling like a nest, settles there and remains for the number of days I mentioned. Many come and deposit gold and silver, others deposit bronze, which they use as coin, into a large jar which sits in front and each person says his name. Someone else stands by and calls up the name. The climber receives it and makes a prayer for each person. As he prays, he shakes a bronze device which sounds loud and sharp when it is moved. He never sleeps. If sleep ever does overtake him, a scorpion climbs up, wakes him, and treats him unpleasantly. This is the penalty imposed on him for sleeping. They tell holy and pious stories about the scorpion. Whether they are accurate, I am unable to say. It seems to me that one thing that contributes greatly to wakefulness is the fear of falling. This is enough said about the Phallus- climbers [phallobates].'? Crucial for the understanding of this strange practice is the recogni- tion of Lucian's own style and motives in presenting it. For example, his use of the word phallos for the pillars appears to be ironic, an outgrowth of the interpretatio Graeca which he brings to local cults and his fascination with Dionysus worship. Lucian himself admits that their sexual connotations are debatable. He is quite explicit in dismissing the local understandings of the practice, introducing instead an association (connected with his interest in the Dionysus cult) with the virility figurines placed on much smaller phalloi inside temples in Greece: Greeks erect phalli to Dionysus on which they have something of this sort: small wooden men with large genitals. These are called puppets [neurospasta]. This, too, is in the sanctuary. In the right part of the temple sits a small man of bronze with a large penis." 170</page><page sequence="4">STYLITES AND PHALLOBATES But Lucian does not even pretend to give an objective aetiology of the practice: "it seems to me," he says, "that the man climbs up [the Hierapolis phallos] in imitation of this wooden man" (De Dea Syria 28, emphasis mine). So in fact the word phallos-so shocking to subsequent scholars-, the suggestion of the pillar's sexual connotations, and even the pillars' association with Hierapolis all derive from Lucian's par- ticular way of describing Hierapolis, and his quintessentially Hellenistic proclivity towards mixing and matching religious practice under Greek rubrics, whether or not indigenous explanations exist.12 On the other hand, if we read De Dea Syria critically we can discern a number of religious practices centered in Hierapolis, with their respective cultures. Religious diversity in a particular area is a fact often difficult to grasp, for history has tended to preserve evidence for, and condition us to focus upon, the more "institutional" cults and religious organizations of Greco-Roman Syria. Finally, it need hardly be pointed out that a monument could not con- ceivably have been both ithyphallic and shaped to hold a human being for a week's time. The only giant phalloi we have to compare to those of Hierapolis are the "monumental" phalloi of Delos, which are quite small and set at angles atop sculptured bases. Therefore it does not seem possible that what Lucian calls phalloi are anything but erect pillars. Symeon and Lucian's Phallobates Could the phallobates, although practicing three centuries earlier, in fact be considered "proto-stylites"? To what degree might Symeon have been following an ancient practice of his regional culture? What parallels could actually be drawn between the two phenomena of pillar- standing just cited? Besides the mere fact of ascending a pillar for a religious purpose, we may note other significant parallels: a) a rudimen- tary asceticism apparently required for the phallobates' effectiveness, b) a corollation between the ritual and social/national stability and fer- tility,13 and c) the role of the pillar climber as intercessor for the people. On the other hand, the differences between Symeon's stylitism and the Hierapolis practice militate against overly naive comparisons; a) the anonymity of the phallobates in Lucian's account contrasts with the charisma of Symeon himself; b) while Symeon, once up, never officially came down, the phallobates rites involved frequent and regular ascents and descents; c) it must be recognized that Symeon's life aloft was one 171</page><page sequence="5">DAVID T. M. FRANKFURTER of pronounced asceticism (a gangrenous leg earned him extra fame); and d) it is structurally and symbolically different to rise up to the gods (in the case of the phallobates) than, like Symeon, to establish oneself "betwixt and between" the divine and human realms. However, those scholars who have refused to recognize any sort of religious or historical connection between these two incidences of pillar ritual have based their objections not so much on these phenomenological differences, but on a putative discontinuity between Christian and "pagan" cultures: Symeon himself, a Christian saint, could not possibly have taken over a heathen practice with sexual overtones. The Phallobates in Patristic Scholarship Insofar as the prospect of parallels between the Atargatfs "sex cult" (as so many have perceived it) and the pious Saint Symeon has seemed distasteful to many-particularly the Jesuit hagiographical scholars of the Bollandist school-it comes as no surprise that the scholarship on Symeon's pre-Christian roots has been negligible. In 1912 J. Toutain presented the parallels under the provocative title "la legende chretienne de Saint Simeon Stylite et ses origines paiennes," labelling stylitism as "a survival of an ancient Syrian pagan practice."'4 Frederick Lent alluded to the phallobates in his 1915 translation of the Syriac Life of Symeon, but dismissed its significance on the basis that "Simeon proba- bly had never heard of it; the practice had died out long before he was born." 15 It was then incumbent upon the great Bollandist father Hip- polyte Delehaye to reject completely the theory of parallels, as being "an interesting example of those methodological aberrations which seek to find, under whatever Christian institution, the vestiges of some pagan practice."16 In the height of his passionate rebuttal to Toutain, Delehaye questioned ... how a young shepherd, brought up in the most profound ignorance, as was Symeon, could have been instructed in the practices of an abhorred religion, when he hardly knew the elements of his own... So just as we do not see some malicious spectator treat Symeon as a plagiarist of pagans, similarly we do not dream of giving him credit for having sanctified a prac- tice invented by idolators.'7 With his strange prejudice against pre-Christian religions, Delehaye had confused the "paganism" of local tradition with a "priestly paganism" which could be "taught." 172</page><page sequence="6">STYLITES AND PHALLOBATES The most complete survey of connections between Lucian's phallobates and Symeon the Stylite came in two articles by the Australian historian, G. R. H. Wright, in 1968 and 1970.'8 Although Wright did not refer to previous debate on the subject, he provided abundant evidence (from both texts and iconography) for a common "fertility" symbolism between Symeon and the Hierapolis cult. His reasoning on this symbolism, however, derived from the "pan-fertility goddess" theories advanced by the British Myth-Ritual school (E. O. James, S. H. Hooke, and others); thus Wright emphasized the sexual implications of pillar-sitting, whether "pagan" or Christian. However, Near Eastern scholarship has shown many of these "archetypal pat- terns" of Oriental religions to be untenable under closer scrutiny and especially in later periods; and a 1975 article by Romuald Fernandez ad- dressed this issue specifically: that many of the "fertility" connotations of Symeon's cult could be found abundantly present in every other saint cult around the Mediterranean.'9 The main difficulty with Wright's articles-and a problem even more manifest in the works of the Bollandists-is a tendency to generalize piety in the Near East by appeal to such grand Hellenized cults as Hierapolis. Wright's analysis actually ranges all the way from classical Mesopotamia through the sixth century C.E.; but it is precisely in these later periods that the historian should not use the central cult cities as a basis for describing religion as a whole. For we have increasing evidence of more localized and regional forms of religious behavior. The diverse character of native religions in Late Antiquity-a fact that might qualify the strident assertions about Christianity's novelty made by many Patristic scholars-has been ignored in even the most re- cent scholarship on Symeon Stylites. Indeed, Han Drijvers' exhaustive 1978 survey of the phallobates-Symeon connection concluded that, far from demonstrating any continuity with native piety, Symeon "mounted his pillar as Christ did the cross, and prayed for the world and humanity like his Lord." 20 Drijvers' theory that an imitatio Christi theme runs throughout the iconography and hagiography of Symeon is inspired by several (although, it should be noted, not the majority of) post-Symeon iconographic representations of stylites with their arms outstretched. As these images, Drijvers assumes, were inspired by the Cross of Christ, so also was Symeon. But whether or not some later sculptors gave such theological reassessment to their local brand of holy man, there is no evidence that Symeon himself was inspired by Jesus' 173</page><page sequence="7">DAVID T. M. FRANKFURTER crucifixion.2' In fact, by associating one of the least comprehensible forms of ascetic display with a most orthodox Christian theology of the Cross, Drijvers' method reflects the biases and suspicions of the Bollan- dist scholars: that is, the Christian Symeon's very motivations would have precluded the use of native ritual. Robert Doran takes the theological interpretation of Symeon on his pillar one step further. Focussing upon his concerted standing, Doran associates Symeon with the Biblical image of the prophet in the heavenly court, and from there to the Platonic-Gnostic idea of the perfected being as "motionless."22 Here the attempt to dissociate Symeon from his surroundings and culture ascribes to him the diverse interests and ideals of the contemporary Academy. And yet the effect is still the same: Symeon is a product of the new theology of a "converted" empire and its books. Other prominent scholars have given the Lucian passage mere foot- notes of dismissal. Festugiere mocked the potential of connections as a "vue sangrenue."23 And even in 1973 Sebastian Brock referred to the local custom with the assertion that "it is most unlikely that Simeon's stylite life had any connection with the practice of the pagan priests at Hierapolis/Mabbug." In view of the history of the scholarship, one might well presume that it has been due to theological discomfort that the origins of stylitism have not been sought seriously outside the spec- trum of a monolithic Christian asceticism. Critical Reading and the Problem of Relationships The historian or religionist must approach strange phenomena with a question, not preconceived answers. In this case the main question must be: given a close prototype in the thriving second century cult of Hierapolis to Symeon's "innovation" of sacred stylitism in the first quarter of the fifth century, but admitting the obvious social, religious, and historical separation, in what way can we possibly understand con- tinuity? For I believe that the only way to approach the issue is by, in- deed, assuming some relationship between two incidences of stylitism in the same area within three centuries. The possibility of "coincidence" is less than compelling. The initial problem in establishing any sort of link between Lucian and Symeon appears immediately in the hagiographies of Theodoret and the Syriac Life. While these contemporaneous writers give great 174</page><page sequence="8">STYLITES AND PHALLOBATES significance to the pillar as an integral part of Symeon's holiness, as I have described, they in no way allude to any previous practice of stylitism: Symeon's act is presented as pure innovation. And since we are dealing with a genre of literature that regularly described the holy man's "purification and sanctification" of native cult sites, if there were any question of cultic imitation in Symeon's pillar, we might ex- pect that Theodoret, at least, would have addressed it. The hagiographies rarely miss an opportunity to discredit pre-Christian practices; the monks who write them had no conception of "destruction through silence." Yet there is not a single suggestion that Symeon was "purifying" a "pagan" practice. Symeon is described as constructing his pillar (we may presume with some help) on a site he, ostensibly, chose for himself. Obviously, then, we would be wrong to look for any sort of cultic or established institutional continuity between what Lu- cian wrote about and what Symeon enacted.24 Rather, if we are to search properly for any sort of continuity between Lucian and Symeon, we must be prepared to generalize pre-Christian stylitism beyond simply the cultic rites of Hierapolis and the worship of the goddess Atargatis. Conveniently, Lucian already gives us reason to distinguish the use of the phalloi from the cult religion of Heliopolis. First of all, while Lucian is extraordinarily explicit about the names of the gods propitiated in every corner of Heliopolis, he describes the phallobates' prayers as "to the gods on high [hypsou toisi theoisin] ... and the gods hear the prayers from nearby"-a remarkably vague description, suggesting either Lu- cian's own ignorance of, or an imposed generalization about, the object of the phallobates' activities (which indeed may not have been quite so "theologically" clear). Furthermore, while Lucian later refers to the regular cultic functionaries of Atargatis as hirees (Ion.), priests (e.g., 36), at no point does he so refer to the phallobates, but only as men, andres (28-29). This would suggest that while some particular social status might have been involved in being a phallobates (among others, being male), it was not so official or distinct from ordinary socio- economic status as to merit-in Lucian's vocabulary-the title hireus. Indeed, Lucian implies no connection between the ritual of the phalloi and the actual Hierapolis temple cult within the walls ("... this is enough said about the Phallus-climbers," 29). Moreover, we can infer the fact of discontinuity between phalloi and temple proper merely from the placement of the pillars: they are outside the temple precincts, by the gate (28). Finally, Lucian's association of the phalloi with the folk, 175</page><page sequence="9">DAVID T. M. FRANKFURTER hoi polloi-their prayers, folklore, and general well-being-in con- tradistinction to the "high pagan" theology of Hierapolis religion, rein- forces the impression that the pillar-cult of Lucian's Hierapolis was a separate, more popular, and perhaps more traditional (older) religious practice than the Hellenized cult of Hierapolis.24a I therefore offer the idea that a more basic "pillar symbolism" occupied the religious con- sciousness of second century Syrians in the neighborhood of Hierapolis. Might this facilitate establishing continuity with Symeon the Stylite? It is the location in particular of Qal'at Simcan, the site of Symeon's pillar and church, which suggests some sort of continuity with the phenomenon Lucian describes, for this mountain stands less than 100 kilometers from Hierapolis. Though in the Byzantinizing sphere of An- tioch, Qalcat Simcan lay in the midst of an ancient culture of mountain peasantry, crossed from earliest times by Arabs and other trading peoples. Christianity made little impact here, and then only through the powerful charisma of Symeon and other holy men. When evangelism succeeded, the new ideologies invariably simmered at a low temperature, and often blew out, as many stories of Syrian holy men, the instruments of revival, bear witness. But even in the case of Symeon, it appears that his devotees were more interested in the powers of the divine Symeon than the theology of the divine Christ. The hagiographers are explicit about Symeon's encounter with pre- Christian cultures, and thus are testimony to the rarity and strangeness of Christianity in this region of northern Syria. Even to Theodoret's later fifth century redactor the hordes and diversity of converts were striking: ...the Iberians, the Armenians, the Persians who arrive there and receive the holy baptism. As for the Ismaelites [Arab tribes] who arrive in bands, two hundred or three hundred at a time, often even by the thousand, they foreswear their ancestral error with great cries, smashing before this great luminary the idols that their fathers worshipped, and, renouncing the orgies of Aphrodite-for they had long ago adopted the cult of this demon-, they participate in the divine mysteries, accepting the laws from this sacred mouth, bidding farewell to the custom of their fathers, and abs- taining from eating donkey and camel.25 When such a large part of both Theodoret and the Syriac life are taken up with exaggerated descriptions of Symeon's conversions, it is quite obvious that Christianity had taken little hold in this area by the early fifth century. Another Symeon described by Theodoret, a hermit 176</page><page sequence="10">STYLITES AND PHALLOBATES who first achieved notoriety from his cave in the desert, encountered the persistence of popular sacred space when he arrived on the top of Mount Amanus (north of Antioch) to set up a new dwelling: "this place, formerly filled with the multiple madnesses of polytheism, he cultivated with many different kinds of miracles, and thus planted the piety which governs there now."26 "Christianity" in Northern Syria It is well known among scholars of Late Antiquity that pre-Christian traditions and native religious cultures around the Mediterranean per- sisted well into the sixth century and later. This was particularly the case in northern rural Syria. Walter Kaegi has found that in Heliopolis/Baalbek (to the south of Qalcat Simcan) "Christians still re- mained a minority even as late as the reign of Tiberius II (572-582)"; 27 and both Kaegi and Frend have convincingly established that rural cultures in Byzantium retained their local traditions much longer, more prominently, and with more resistance than cultures within cosmopolitan spheres: "paganism was strongest where it survived as a community force, that is in remote villages."28 John of Ephesus' ac- count of the Holy Man Symeon the Mountaineer conveys this rural resistance to full "conversion" quite vividly. Symeon, traversing the mountains west of the Euphrates, comes upon numerous villages whose token monuments and memories of Christianity have fallen to the wayside as useless: ... The shepherds would state to him, "We found our fathers living in this way on these mountains; and inasmuch as we were born on them, lo! we also live on them." And again [Symeon] would ask them, "How then, as you live on these mountains, are you able to assemble in God's house, and to hear his word from the holy Scriptures, or to communicate in the mysteries of his body and blood?" But these men, like some wild beasts, upon these words laughed at the blessed man, and they said: "How, blessed sir, does the oblation that a man received profit him? For what is the oblation? 29 Symeon proceeds to take several such communities under his full charismatic authority, and at one point confines all adolescent children in an old chapel, forcibly tonsuring them (John of Ephesus describes how the children of those parents who opposed him, die).30 But what is most striking about John's account from a history-of-religions 177</page><page sequence="11">DAVID T. M. FRANKFURTER perspective is the lack of a delineated struggle between "paganism"/ demons and Christian power; indeed, says Symeon: What pagan is there, or what other worshippers of creation, who for so long a period of time would neglect to pay honour to the object of his wor- ship, and would not always worship that which is reckoned by him as God? These men neither worship God like Christians, nor honour something else like pagans; and they are apostates against the one and against the other.31 We are reminded of Victorian anthropologists who analyzed African tribes, for just so Symeon (i.e., John of Ephesus) was unable to fit the mountain villagers' religion (for we can hardly suppose there was "none") into his own preconceived notion of religion, which was condi- tioned by the great Hellenistic cult sanctuaries (as the anthropologists' notions were determined by Protestantism). Yet we can learn much from the accounts in John of Ephesus; and thus the more recent studies of Liebeschuetz and Drijvers have questioned the overall concept of the "Christianization" of culture in Late Antiquity.32 Drijvers regards it as "impossible to speak of pagan cults and practices in Syria as a well- defined entity, just as it is impossible to refer to Christian Syria as a clear-cut religious denomination;" the persistence of native traditions in Syria demonstrates a "continuity of culture in which no sudden changes or breaks occur, only gradual shifts." 33 An excellent example of this more gradual development of religions in Syria, rather than outright cultural "conversion," is found in the early sixth-century Chronicle of Joshua the Stylite, concerning an urban setting. Joshua contemptuously observes the Edessans' preparations for their annual festival (497 C.E.): There came round again the time of that festival at which the heathen tales were sung; and the citizens (of Edessa) took even more pains about it than usual. For seven days previously they were going up in crowds to the theatre at eventide, clad in linen garments, and wearing turbans. But just a short time later, when the Emperor Anastasius relieves the town of a certain tax, ... the whole city rejoiced, and they all put on white garments, both small and great, and carried lighted tapers and censers full of burning incense, and went forth with psalms and hymns, giving thanks to God and praising the emperor, to the church of S. Sergius and S. Simeon, where they celebrated the eucharist.34 Few examples of the harmony of traditions are quite so vivid as these records of Joshua. 178</page><page sequence="12">STYLITES AND PHALLOBATES Whether or not the ritual of the phallobates was intrinsically con- nected to the cult of Atargatis in the temple of Hierapolis, Macrobius implies that the temple itself was thriving in the fourth century; and even in the sixth century Jacob of Saroug indicates the central impor- tance of Hierapolis (and "The Goddess") for all the region's native cults.35 It thus seems quite clear that northern Syria, particularly rural Syria, never assimilated Christianity in such a way as to justify the no- tion of cultural "conversion" or its accompanying presuppositions.36 We now have two conditions which allow a relationship between Lu- cian's report of the Hierapolis phallobates and St. Symeon the Stylite: a) there is no reason to presume an intrinsic relationship between the pillar "cult" by the Hierapolis temple gates and the temple cult proper, and so we must look elsewhere for pillar symbolism or rituals, and to understand a diffuse, uncentralized religious tradition, not a singular, established "pagan rite;" b) native traditions and religious cultures were normative, rather than obsolete, in the region of Qalcat SimCan. Cor- ollary to both of these observations is the fact that that complex of in- digenous traditions, symbols, lore, and religions usually grouped under the term "paganism" does not constitute an ideology, nor very often a mythological canon.37 The force and meaning of local or "popular" religions are rarely contained in anything as articulate and verbal as "beliefs" or doctrines. Rather, the local religion is a matter of tradition, act, and pragmatics (the "spiritual" experience of religion notwith- standing). Thus we must regard the rural Syria of Late Antiquity as con- taining a religious culture, a complex of traditions, not a singular and monolithic "paganism" of which the proto-stylitism of Hierapolis was one component rite. Through this perspective on religion I am not con- necting a "pagan sex cult" in Hierapolis with Symeon's "purified asceticism" in a simplistic and unilinear path, but rather analyzing two analogous representations of (I suspect) a general tradition of pillar symbolism and ritual in Greco-Roman Syria. Such a general mor- phology of popular devotion as pillars, unconnected to a "formal" cult center and goddess, would escape the eyes of a hagiographer interested more in Christ's victory over the major Greco-Roman gods. Stylitism to the hagiographer would thus appear as a novelty, an intriguing new form of asceticism, issuing "naturally" from the pious tendencies of the saint.38 The precise continuity with epichoric traditions the hagiographer would miss, as irrelevant to the aretalogia of the saint's life. 179</page><page sequence="13">DAVID T. M. FRANKFURTER The Pillar in North Syrian Iconography and Religious Practice What evidence do we have for pillar symbolism apart from Lucian and Symeon? Two iconographic forms native to Late Antique Syria suggest that pillars in both cases may have had more general cultural significance in the area of Hierapolis and Qalcat Simcan: the baetyl and the crescent standard. The Arabic baetyl "cult" consisted of the placement of low, usually conical stones (not pillars per se) in sacred places, such as mountain tops. As the aniconic religious representations of a nomadic and oral culture, their function and significance can only be deduced: temporary altars, shrine-markers for holy ground (or axes mundi), and monuments erected ex voto to particular gods-all seem to characterize the role of the baetyl.39 Toufic Fahd traces the historical evolution of the baetyl tradition from (originally) a series of indistinct man-made lumps whose power evidently lay in their permanent and localized character, through decoration, anthropomorphism, and association with established Near Eastern cults and Hellenistic culture, to (ultimately) the state where each baetyl represented a particular, named divinity. Thus the baetyl "cult" was progressively mythologized and particularized-especially, Fahd notes, in the third century C.E.40 We find possible reflexes of the Arabic baetyl cult (or at least its form) in two major Late Antique Syrian temples: Heliopolis/Baalbek, whose black conical megalith the Roman Emperor Elagabalus took to Rome in 218 C.E.;4' and the Heliopolis temple of Atargatis (outside of which the phallobates climbed), upon whose main altar stood, in Lu- cian's words, ... [a] golden image, not at all like the other statues. It does not have its own particular character, but it bears the qualities of the other gods. It is called "Sign" [semeion] by the Assyrians themselves, and they have not given it any particular name, nor do they speak of its origin or form.42 Like the baetyl, the semeion has also been found in a variety of forms in Northern Syria, ranging from the conical "omphalos" shape of the baetyl to straight pillars (represented on stelae).43 Drijvers has called the semeion in combination with an image of Atargatis or the god Hadad "an autochthonous Syrian religious element."44 By virtue of its in- definite meaning and diverse forms we are justified in associating Lu- cian's semeion with the baetyl. 180</page><page sequence="14">STYLITES AND PHALLOBATES Now the baetyl, it must be admitted, is not a pillar on the order of Symeon's but a small monument. However, since it derives from a root meaning to erect or dress, it has often been translated "pillar." 4 Still, we cannot use the baetyl as certain evidence for a religious tradition of high pillars; but we can extrapolate from the widespread use of baetyls throughout Greco-Roman Syria and Arabia to assume that there was a continuous religious tradition of erecting monoliths as symbols of political stability and connection with sacred power. Within the sphere of Hellenism (e.g., sanctuaries of Heliopolis, Emesa, and Hierapolis) such monoliths took on a more decorative appearance and local reference. Lucian, for example, points out that the semeion at the Heliopolis of Atargatis had a golden dove on its "head."46 The crescent standard-a long pole with upturned lunar "horns" on top, often with a star or sun floating between the two horns-appears on Mesopotamian cylinder seals as early as the second millennium B.C.E. apparently symbolizing a divinity who lacked (or opposed) traditional anthropomorphic representation, and on a stele from Palmyra dating from the first century C.E.47 [see figure 1]. This latter image, while plainly showing the crescent standard as portable religious insignia, Drijvers has associated with the semeion-as being in the same iconographic/monumental tradition with the object Lucian describes on the altar at Heliopolis-in each case as the symbol of a god.48 It is then quite significant for the question of pillar symbolism that a stele from the Atargatis temple at Dura Europos and a relief from the Sumatar cave (both from the first to second centuries C.E.) have transformed the horn-topped pole into a horn-topped pillar, while re- taining the traditional details of the base, the bulb beneath the horns, and a floating object between the horns48" [see figure 2]. The stele, an ex voto offering to the goddess, has also been labelled a semeion; while the Sumatar relief has been more generally seen as anthropomorphic- "a stylized human person wearing horns on his head."49 Yet the vivid resemblance between the two horned pillars suggests a common iconographic basis: a "horned pillar" reflex of the ancient Near Eastern crescent standard symbol. The evidence for the horned pillar iconographic tradition derives from regions considerably beyond Hierapolis and Qalcat Simcan (Mesopotamia, Palmyra, Dura Europos, Sumatar), and therefore does not immediately reflect the indigenous religious symbols of north-west Syria. However, appearances of the tradition over a broad area outside 181</page><page sequence="15">DAVID T. M. FRANKFURTER 1. Fragmentary relief of figure holding semeion; Palmyra, 1st century C.E.

Furthermore, if (as seems clear) the iconography in all cases represents a divine symbol held up on a pillar (or pole), then we must seek examples more generally of sacred objects on pillars, poles, or monoliths in Syria. Here Lucian's semeion provides an instructive example: the semeion holds a dove, a symbol of Atargatis.50 But Jacob of Saroug's description of native Syrian cults in the sixth century C.E. offers a curious combination of a) the sacralization of high places (the common location of baetyls, but characteristic of native religions in general51), and b) the image of the 182</page><page sequence="16">STYLITES AND PHALLOBATES 2.

There was no hill that was not moist with the blood of sacrifices, and no high place that was empty of libations ... And the gods had a lofty seat of renown and images were erected on heroic pillars, ... 52 The combination of these various forms of religious representa- tion-baetyl, semeion, and crescent pillar or horned pillar-persisting as basic to Syrian and Mesopotamian cultures well into the common era 183</page><page sequence="17">DAVID T. M. FRANKFURTER has a double relevance for Symeon the Stylite in the fifth century. First, it means that the pillar was a highly usual and traditionally significant emblem on which to place a holy figure in the cultural world of Late Antique Syria; there was no novelty to the pillar as an iconographic statement, particularly when the pillar was placed on a highly visible hilltop (as was the case with Symeon the Elder, Symeon the Younger, and even Daniel the Stylite, whose perch overlooked the Bosphoros). And second, although the figure on top could change to suit a diversity of divinities, the sacred nature of this figure was understood within a traditional religions matrix. As baetyls (and, presumably, the horned pillar relief of the Sumatar cave) derive from nomadic Arab culture,53 we might suppose that the many nomad tribes who visited and paid homage to the pillar even long after Symeon had died might well have understood the pillar in relation to the baetyl tradition.54 In like fashion, visitors from urban Byzantium might have brought their own associa- tions of imperial pillars and statuary to their understanding of Symeon's sanctity.55 Finally, the evidence for a common pillar iconography in Late An- tique Syria would suggest an important continuity between the phallobates and Symeon: that in each case the stylite participated in a more basic symbolic form for the representation of the Holy. Symeon was neither recalling the phallobates' specific practice nor conceiving on his own of a novel form of Christian ordeal; rather, regional iconographic tradition-which could naturally extend to regional "cultic" tradition-came to expression in (at least) two cases separated by several hundred years. And there is little reason to believe that the intervening centuries would not have had additional instances of stylitism in the area west of the Euphrates.56 Stylitism as Continuity The major methodological problem that arises when one generalizes a symbol is the tendency towards archetypalism: the notion that an im- age or idea is so basic-psychologically or structurally-that it transcends all particular relationship with a culture, time, or place. Pillars and the ritual ascents of pillars easily lend themselves to this kind of generalizing, and often quite rightly.57 But archetypalism can become deterministic, as the generalized meaning and force of a symbol begins to govern and even obscure its more particular meanings and contexts.58 184</page><page sequence="18">STYLITES AND PHALLOBATES Yet a nuanced, historical, and regional approach to the persistence and reflexes of a symbol can illumine ostensibly accidental cor- respondences between events. Two facts reinforce both the concept of a pillar tradition in Syria and Symeon's participation in that tradition: the immediate growth of Stylitism in the area of Qalcat Sim'an, and the growth and form of an indigenous Syrian stylite iconography which em- phasized the pillar itself. Although the hagiography of Daniel the Stylite and the (posthumous) cult of St. Symeon the Younger plainly make reference to Symeon as the source of these proteges' inspiration,59 and several of the Syrian stylites erected their pillars in places where Symeon had spent time, the remarkable multiplication and diffusion of stylites around Syria within two centuries of Symeon's death (at least twenty in the region of QalCat Simcan) suggests some local proclivity to the idea.60 One stylite even found a perch in the region of the Hierapolis temple, although it is impossible to determine whether his pillar might have been one of Lu- cian's phalloi.6' Of even greater significance for the sanctity of the pillar in Late Antique Syria is a case (presumably not unique) of the stylite as monastic office-an inherited or achieved position-reported by John of Ephesus. In his legend of the brothers Abraham and Maro John describes how, by their monastery (which was south of the Tigris), "there was a high stone column to which men used to come in order to stand upon it in that monastery; and after he had broken himself for a space of ten years by great labours [Abraham] himself ascended the column."62 From this scene we might deduce not only "a settled pattern in which monasteries have one stylite at a time, and the monastery's stylite has certain functions,"63 but that there was an imperative that someone in fact be perched on that column at all times. This evident at- tention to pillar over stylite would necessarily result in the relative anonymity of the stylite, and thus (phenomenologically) recall the anonymous phallobates, who similarly performed an ongoing service by "dwelling" atop the phalloi. In time stylitism spread throughout Byzantium; one would of course consider many factors in accounting for the relative charisma of (for ex- ample) a Macedonian stylite, even ecclesiastical or ideological factors. But the extraordinary diffusion of stylites around Qalcat Simcan and northern Syria cannot be accounted for with the assumption that Sy- meon's innovation was simply an attractive idea, inspiring a host of local would-be ascetics. Furthermore, the charisma and publicity en- 185</page><page sequence="19">DAVID T. M. FRANKFURTER joyed by the first stylites are dialectical achievements-requiring the participation of an audience-and thus we must presume some native proclivity towards the holiness and power of a stylite, a proclivity which would be merely corroborated by the existence of a popular pillar cult in second-century Hierapolis. In Syrian pilgrimage art we find striking evidence for a common pillar iconography and even a common ideology of pillar representation and devotion. Most pilgrim tokens (or eulogia) of Syrian stylites emphasized the pillar so much that only the head of the saint was visible on top-as if the pillar itself constituted his entire torso. In more "primitive" eulogia and in reliefs and stelae from the region of Qalcat Simcan, one can observe the pillar assuming more and more of the iconographic focus; simultaneously the stylite himself gradually changes in pilgrimage art from resembling a monumental anthropoid statue set atop a mound, to merely two eyes and a mouth appearing from a pillar or tower. Often there is only a head on top of a long tower. Such development-from a more mimetic approach to an historical saint on a pillar (generally Sy- meon the Younger), to a more generic design suggesting a more "ar- chetypal" anthropoid pillar, within a mere two centuries, would appear to demonstrate the deep traditions and significance bearing upon the image of the pillar. Studies by both Romuald Fernandez and Jean Lassus have furthermore pointed out that the iconography of stylites ex- tended into an ostensibly independent "Christian pillar" iconography: inscribed colonnettes (often with crosses) which decorated lintels, doors, and sides of buildings in Late Antique Syria.64 Those diverse attempts to explain this "iconographic appropriation" of stylite by pillar by positing ideological motivations on the part of the artists tend either to be selective in their use of data, or to assume rather obscure theological impulses in the artists. Thus Drijvers, examining the few cases where the stylite is given a cruciform arrangement (with hands outstretched) atop the pillar, uses this as evidence for an imitatio Christi motif running throughout stylite iconography.65 While such cases are important iconographical "midpoints" between the stylite image and the cross-topped pillar motif in church decoration, they are on the whole much rarer than the simpler stylite-as-pillar form. As noted earlier, Drijvers' tendency to see imitatio Christi ideas behind the very conception of stylitism has little support in the data itself, whether iconographical or hagiographical. Just as Drijvers emphasizes the cross, so Wright views the triangle as 186</page><page sequence="20">STYLITES AND PHALLOBATES the essential symbol in stylite iconography; he then associates the triangle motif (attested on a few Syrian stelae) with symbols of the an- cient Mesopotamian God Marduk.66 But once again, this is a selective use of evidence: triangles occur only on a few stylite stelae, and most often represent the roof over the stylite as an extension of the pillar (sug- gesting an obelisk form overall). I need hardly add that to trace direct links to particular gods over several millenia has serious problems for understanding Syrian stylitism in its own context. Fernandez suggests that the orientation in Syrian stylite iconography away from anthropomorphic representation must derive from a Semitic aversion to realistic human images in art.67 But it would seem more ac- curate to describe this orientation-this "natural" tendency over several hundred years-as indicating a preference for the significance of the pillar, rather than an aversion to the image of the human. The vast majority of stylite images appear on ex votos, eulogia, or church decorations that function as invocation or dedication- "popular" and pragmatic contexts. This helps to explain the stylite images' formal simplicity. The iconography itself must then mediate be- tween more general cultural needs and traditions, and that imagined event of the stylite saint. If the images thus derive from "popular" representational tendencies, then the form the images take must testify to the symbolic proclivities of rural Syria: once again, the pillar appears to be the defining aspect of the concept of the stylite. The insignia that crest the pillar images in the later stages of the iconography have a relative flexibility-for they merely identify the sanctity of the pillar (like those insignia atop semeia), rather than constitute it. In this way the history of popular stylite iconography represents a re-appropriation of the Christian stylite by the more general indigenous symbolism of the holy pillar. And the pillar itself functions as authenticator and con- secrator of new forms of piety and devotion in the area (such as Symeon the ascetic stylite). It is striking that a stylite eulogion published by Rene Mouterde, where the stylite image has the same kind of abstract pillar form, shows on the reverse an odd symbol: a simple pillar or upright stick with a cleft top-what could easily be some developed form of semeion or baetyl.68 The particular concentration of these pillar images and phenomena in Syria, the immediate growth and popularity of stylitism in Northern Syria,69 and the development and diffusion of a "folk-iconography" of stylite saints in Syria, all suggest that a basic interest in the pillar among 187</page><page sequence="21">DAVID T. M. FRANKFURTER the religious cultures of Syria had developed from before Late An- tiquity. Symeon and Christian Asceticism As much as we can "disengage" the phalloi from the Hierapolis cult sanctuary, in order to view them amidst this wider religious and iconographic complex of pillar symbolism, we should also disengage Sy- meon's ascent of a pillar from an exalted and pure "Christian" asceticism. Arthur Voobus has pointed out that ... even the Syrian fondness for extravagant practices and their skill at in- venting means of mortification could not hold back the admission that Sem'on was unique. He had surpassed everything to create a form of ascetic life which made him original and took him out of the class of or- dinary athletes. Only in knowing this does it become understandable that other Syrian monks who were themselves always ready for imaginable forms of austerity, found in the actions of Semcon reasons for criticism and even for blame.70 Indeed, for neither Theodoret nor the author of the Syriac Life was Symeon's pillar a "natural" ascetic idea. Theodoret's apology-"I ask fault-finders [mempsimoirous] to curb their tongue and not to let it be carried away at random, but to consider how often the Master has con- trived such things for the benefit of the more easygoing"7--bears witness to widespread disapproval and suspicion of Symeon's act; and Theodoret follows with a list of Hebrew prophets who obeyed equally bizarre commands from God.72 Theodoret himself believed that Sy- meon climbed up to flee the crowds, while the Syriac Life says merely that "after these things he set up a stone, that he might stand upon it, that had four bases and was two cubits high." 73 That is, neither sought to divulge Symeon's own motives. Thus each hagiographer also added a predictive vision from God to Symeon's early life, to present the pillar as God's own inscrutable and authoritative plan for his servant Symeon. Moreover, Symeon in his divine appearances to others on land and sea was said explicitly to have manifested himself on his column, just as in the iconography of the stylites.74 It is evident that the hagiographical literature on Symeon expressly sought to explain an epichoric style of piety to ecclesiarchs and monks who were alien to rural Syrian religiosity.75 It is not possible to maintain that already before Theodoret concocted the apologetic parallels with Hebrew prophets and exalted allusions to Christ, Symeon was understood in this way. 188</page><page sequence="22">STYLITES AND PHALLOBATES The hagiographical literature itself has traditionally been the major obstruction to any argument for continuity with the phallobates, for it brought up the question of Symeon's self-consciousness. That is, could Symeon have known that he was carrying out a feat which had such a "pagan" prototype? Might he have planned it that way in order to facilitate conversion of the rural masses? Or were his intentions so pure, so unobstructed after years in monasteries, so distant from the men- tality of the second century masses who sent offerings up phalloi, that we can only see in his mind the goal of self-abnegation? Are we to believe Theodoret's suggestion that Symeon climbed up a pillar to get away from people? And if so, how could Symeon have expected solitude when he placed the pillar on a mountain top in full view of the major Syrian trade routes and of a substantial village below? 76 What could a six-foot column (its approximate first height) have done but focus atten- tion on him? In fact, none of these speculative psychologies should carry any weight, for the main reason that the mind and motivations of a fifth century Syrian ascetic lie at a most profound distance from those of the modern Western historian.77 The inaccessibility of Symeon's mind can only be breached by taking into account the general continuity of rural Syrian culture through the sixth century, rather than an apologetically- presumed rupture with the conversion of Constantine. It is all the more absurd that critics of "pagan origins" have presumed the "pan- Christian" authority to dip into the head of any individual espousing Jesus since the first Century and suppose his or her "Christian" self- consciousness. But we have seen that hagiographers of the fifth century themselves shied away from giving romantic interpretations to Sy- meon's choice of the pillar; and they offered their ad hoc rationales for stylitism against no dearth of critics quite suspicious of his motivations. Thus we are left, quite appropriately, with an historical- anthropological approach to such phenomena, whereby we analyze the social and imaginative construction of phenomena, rather than the in- dividualistic motivations which set the phenomena in action. Peter Brown's studies on Holy Men center precisely on the social function and socially-contextual symbolism of theioi anthropoi; 78 and we must use these principles of the saint in society-indeed, the saint as a construc- tion of society-for all future studies in the area of Late Antique ascetics and charismatics. 189</page><page sequence="23">DAVID T. M. FRANKFURTER Consequently, as we begin to understand the social construction of the Stylite, we must be prepared to sense more traditional religious ideas informing the development of the Stylite as symbol, his79 apparent novelty notwithstanding. Lucian's testimony of a pillar "cult" in second century Hierapolis, when one analyzes it critically, merely strengthens the notion that stylitism was a very natural development in Late Antique Syria, a religious phenomenon which was, in its own way, inevitable. Conclusion In summary let me restate the question: how can we understand St. Symeon as continuity in ascending a pillar in the first quarter of the fifth century? And how might we also understand it as a religious novelty? To no one did this act appear "pagan"; on the other hand the magnetic attraction of Symeon on his column throughout Syria for centuries later-and the immediate spread in that region of stylitism as ascetic practice-suggest that Symeon was acting within traditional modes of religious expression.80 Without the critical use of Lucian's report on Hierapolis, we would have little idea of the phenomenology of this tradition; and we would be forced to depend on such on-the-spot "theological"/apologetic interpretations of Symeon's behavior as Theodoret was able to muster. On the other hand, an uncritical use of Lucian's text would lead us to view Symeon as a conscious or un- conscious extension of the great, Hellenized Hierapolis temple cult, a conclusion without a word of support from the period of Symeon. I maintain that it is as important to view such a novel and magnetic cult as Symeon's from a diachronic perspective-that is, as an expression of the traditions of an historical religious culture-as it is to view it from a synchronic perspective-that is, in dialectic with contemporaneous socio-economic (as Peter Brown) and ideological (Festugiere, Delehaye, et alii) trends and realities. To understand an event in Late Antiquity as pure novelty ignores the often dangerous significance of novelty to the Greco-Roman and Late Antique worlds; on the other hand, to understand a phenomenon purely from the perspective of precedents and archetypes tends to impose a rigid determinism on historical development and change. Certainly there was something quite novel in the symbolism of Sy- meon on his pillar: he sat "betwixt and between" earth and heaven, 190</page><page sequence="24">STYLITES AND PHALLOBATES while the anonymous intercessors on the Hierapolis phalloi appear to have been aiming as high as possible, to the sky if they could-the ten- sion of spatial liminality was not the point. This liminality, I suggest, was the "new" in the image of Symeon. But it is apologetic at best to regard this novelty outside of the cultural context which also produced the popular "cult" of the phalloi just a few centuries earlier. The connective strands, haphazard as they may be, I believe are represented in the iconography of baetyl and semeion, reinforced by the form taken by native Syrian stylite iconography. But it is the local popularity and magnetism of this first Christian stylite-a popularity which went beyond that of both the Christian ascetic "over-achievers" and the charismatic organizer saints-which argues for the existence of the deep traditional roots Sy- meon had (wittingly or unwittingly) tapped in climbing up onto a col- umn. Indeed it was only in the century following Symeon's death when Evagrius observed, one night in the unroofed octagon of Qalcat Simcan, "the peasants dancing around the column" in apparently customary fashion; and he further relates their practice of "circumambulating [perinostountes] the pillar repeatedly with their beasts of burden."8' Here too no reasonable historian of religions could deny the profound difference between such a ritual of circumambulation and a ritual of as- cent and hypaithrios intercession (the phallobates). But it would seem equally absurd to ignore the intrinsic relationship between, and com- mon significance of, the loci of worship, the central symbols-in this case, pillars. In religion, we might say, continuity is by necessity change, and the "novel" is always what is most vividly traditional. I therefore suggest a new appraisal of Lucian's De Dea Syria and a new perspective on stylite origins-a subject perhaps more aptly cast as "trajectories in Syrian religions."82 NOTES ' This paper was originally presented in a seminar on pilgrimage shrines with Elizabeth Sears and Patricia Brown of the Department of Art and Archaeology at Princeton Univer- sity.

J. Festugiere, Antioche Paienne et Chretienne (Paris 1959) 310n.1. Festugiere in- stead prefers to follow Theodoret's own romantic understanding of Symeon: that he "aspired to fly towards heaven and separate from this earthly sojourn" (Hist. Rel. 26, 12). But while he can be trusted to a certain degree as a witness to some of Symeon's deeds, Theodoret wields no authority on Symeon's motivations. Hagiography was an art, not a science, in Late Antiquity. 24 My understanding of a "cultic" rite requires some sort of traditionally and archaically set-off space, as in the case of a temple complex. I am therefore making a distinction be- tween the local sacred places of rural Syria, with little or no defining structures and no permanent priesthood, and those large, Hellenized complexes such as Heliopolis/Baalbek and Hierapolis/Mabbu. In these latter sites one might almost speak of a "paganism," as the priestly class often created literary mythographies and even theologies as propaganda in the wider Greco-Roman world. On the Hellenistic development of the Heliopolitan cult, see Philip K. Hitti, History of Syria (London 21957) 310ff. 24a Cf. Drijvers, Cults and Beliefs at Edessa (Leiden 1980) 121: "it is often difficult to decide if the cult of Atargatis at a certain place is actually a branch of the sanctuary of Hierapolis or a local cult adapted to the practice and customs at Mabbug [Hierapolis]. Religious forms are not fixed in this area, but always change and develop, borrowing motifs from each other. The wide range of variants in the cult of the Dea Syria most ap- propriatedly demonstrates such a process of religious assimilation and articulation." 25 Theodoret, Historia Religiosa 26, 13 (Canivet &amp; Leroy-Molinghen, II, 191; Price, 166f.). 26 Theodoret, Hist.

Segal, Pagan Syriac Monuments in the Vilayet of Urfa, Anatolian Studies 3 (1953) 108-109. 37 The legend of Symeon the Mountaineer (see above) describes a people with "no religion" as far as John of Ephesus could imagine. This would mean that they fit neither in a proper category of "paganism"-i.e., with names of gods and a full theogony-nor of Christianity or Judaism. Evidently rural Syrian religion is not to be described in these anachronistic and romantic categories. 38 See Voobus, History of Asceticism II, 217 on the hagiography of stylites (particularly Symeon) as apology against a considerable amount of contemporaneous opposition to the strange practice. 39 A baetyl "sanctuary," with accompanying inscriptions, was discovered at Sumatar (about 100 kms south-east of Edessa). The inscriptions indicate both political and sacred functions in erecting baetyls; e.g.: "(And may he give the stool [or base]) to him whom he rears. (Then) he will get his recompense from [the god] Mar-lah6. But if he withholds the stool and the baetyl will be ruined, may he the god know (it)" (tr. by Drijvers, Cults and Beliefs, 126); cf. Segal, Pagan Syriac Monuments; Drijvers, Old-Syriac (Edessean) In- scriptions (Leiden 1972) 16-18. 40 Toufic Fahd, Le pantheon de l'Arabie central a la veille de l'Hegire (Paris 1968) 24-35. 41 It is presumed that this monolith was similar to that in the Syrian temple of Emesa, where Herodian attests that "there was no actual man-made statue of the god, the sort Greeks and Romans put up; but there was an enormous stone, rounded at the base and coming to a point at the top, conical in shape and black. This stone is worshipped as if it were sent from heaven..." (Herodian 5, 3, 5; tr. C. R. Whittaker, Herodian II, The Loeb Classical Library [Cambridge &amp; London 1970] 18ff.); on Elagabalus' removal of it, see Herodian 5, 5, 6 and discussions in Glen W.

From this fact we might presume that large groups of non- initiates (i.e., not allowed to attend the liturgy) came on pilgrimage to the church, and these would undoubtedly have been (after Theodoret's testimony) cultural groups-tribes. See Georges Tchalenko, Villages Antiques de la Syrie du Nord I (Paris 1953) 237ff.; Jean Lassus, Sanctuaires Chretiennes de Syrie (Paris 1947) 129, 132. On Symeon's special significance to Arabs, see Voobus, History of Asceticism II, 222. 5 Many medieval Byzantine stylites actually chose these imperial columns to stand on, both replacing and continuing the old "pagan" symbolism; see Delehaye, Les saints stylites, cxxxiii, cxlix, Ignace Pefia, Martyrs du Temps de Paix, 33f. 56 Similarly, it is not surprising to find analogous forms of "pillar religion" in other parts of Arabia, as the peoples there travelled widely. Thus in South Arabia there still ex- ists the following ancient practice, reported by Werner Daum, A Pre-Islamic Rite in South Arabia, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society (1987), 5-14: The central ceremony consists in the erection of two wooden poles, one longer and one somewhat shorter ... The preparation of the poles starts in the evening after sunset. The poles are first washed with water, and then henna is applied... The two 195</page><page sequence="29">DAVID T. M. FRANKFURTER poles are decorated with a bundle of cloth... When the two poles are erected, boys climb up them, usually suspended from a rope fixed on top of the pole. They then slither down, go up again, and so on. I did not expect an answer when I asked what the significance of this 'play' might be, but I was told it was meant to ensure abun- dance of children. If the children played zealously, many boys would be born in the following year (7). A phallic/fertility interpretation is both obvious and limited; so also is the local inter- pretation, legends of the saint after which one of the poles is named (the other is simply called "female"). The ceremony seems more aptly associated with a series of Arabic "height" rituals, including the Western Syrian stylites, their historical predecessors, and the "rope tricks" performed in Arabic markets. See Mircea Eliade, Ropes and Puppets, in idem, The Two and the One, tr. by J. M. Cohen (Chicago 1965) 160-188. 57 For a very cogent analysis of the pillar as axis mundi-that is, as vertical mediator of worlds and sustainer of cosmic stability-see Mircea Eliade, The Sacred and the Profane (New York 1959) 32-58; idem, Patterns in Comparative Religion (New York 1958) 99-108, 379-385. 58 For this reason I find it irrelevant to compare these Northern Syrian phenomena with the "giant Jupiter" columns of Caesar's Gaul. For a full discussion see Emile Thevenot, Divinites et Sanctuaires de la Gaule (Paris 1968) 28-40, and Werner Muller, Die Jupitergigantensaulen und ihre Verwandten (Meisenheim am Glan 1975). Naturally, this subject could be extended to Celtic menhirs and Indian linga (cf. also John Irwin, The ancient pillar-cult at Prayaga [Allahabad]: its pre-Asokan origins, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society [1983] 253-280). 59 Daniel: Life of Daniel the Stylite 8, 21, 23-24 (in: Elizabeth Dawes &amp; Norman Baynes, Three Byzantine Saints [Crestwood, NY 1977]). While the Vita of Symeon the Younger strikingly lacks any reference to Symeon the Elder, there is general agreement that the church and cult built around his pillar on Mt. Admirable were based completely on Qal'at Simcan; see for example Paul van den Ven, La Vie ancienne de S. Symeon Stylite le Jeune I (Brussels 1962) 171-178. 60 See Pascal Castellana, Les stylites autour de Qalcat Simcan, Les Stylites Syriens, 87-159. "' John Moschos tells of a "heretical" (i.e., monophysite) stylite living "in a certain part of Hierapolis," (Pratum Spirituale 36 [PG 87, 2883-6]). The fact that he was Monophysite might suggest a more rural and local continuity with Symeon-who was also supposed to have been Monophysite-than with some sort of "Stylite institution" mediated through the ecclesiarchy. h2 Lives of the Eastern Saints, tr. by Brooks, 56f. 63 Susan Ashbrook Harvey, personal communication, 10/5/87. 64 Lassus, Sanctuaires Chrdtiennes de Syrie, 278-9, 286, pl.

Rel. 26, 12 (tr. by Price, 165). 72 Hist. Rel. 26, 12; cf. Canivet &amp; Leroy-Molinghen, Theodoret de Cyr II, 185n.3: "Theodoret's explanations and OT references undoubtedly also constitute an apology for Symeon, destined across the skeptics to the detractors of his asceticism." In an analogous episode of ecclesiastical disapproval of stylitism, Gregory of Tours reports a conflict oc- curring in sixth century rural Gaul between a certain Vulfolaic, a holy man and St. Martin aficionado, and the bishops of the region (History of the Franks 8, 15), Vulfolaic had erected a pillar next to a statue of the village's god (called Diana in Gregory of Tour's reportage), and stood upon it through at least one winter. Accordingly, crowds flocked to him, and he succeeded in exhorting them to tear down the "Diana." But in doing so the townspeople may have exchanged a piety centered upon the statue for a parallel form of practical religion centered on the new "statue" nearby. Accordingly, the bishops, hap- pening by, upbraided Vulfolaic for daring to imitate the great Symeon Stylites, and ultimately had his pillar destroyed. It is probable that these bishops, like the objects of Theodoret's apologia, perceived in Vulfolaic's stylitism an insufficient rupture with epichoric styles of piety. On pillar traditions in classical Gaul see above, n.58. 73 Theodoret, Hist. Rel. 26,12; Syriac Life, tr. by Lent, Life of St. Simeon Stylites, 132f. 74 Symeon's "attachment" to his pillar in iconography (see above) and epiphany con- tinues even outside his own hagiographies. Even Daniel the Stylite (C5) sees "a huge pillar of cloud standing opposite him and the holy and blessed Simeon standing above the head of the column and two men of goodly appearance, clad in white, standing near him in the heights" (Life of Daniel the Stylite 21 [tr. by Dawes &amp; Baynes, Three Byzantine Saints 18). It is improbable that this pillar of cloud is merely a reflex of heavenly heights, since no apocalyptic visions ever expressed vertical distance in this way; furthermore, the rest of the chapter makes a distinction between the cloud-pillar's inaccessible height and heaven itself. Nevertheless, instances of heavenly pillars do occur in Late Antique literature of the Near East. The seventh Sibylline Oracle describes how God "will hang an axis through the middle of the sky, and set up a great terror for men to behold on high, an immense pillar [kiona] with great fire, from which drops will destroy the evil races of men who have done harm" (25-27; tr. John Collins, Old Testament Pseudepigrapha I [Garden City, NY 1983] 410). In Cyril of Scythopolis' Life of St. Sabas (sixth century) it is said that Sabas found the cave "where to this day his venerable body is lying... [when he saw] a fiery col- umn standing on the earth, its top reaching to heaven" (18 [E. Schwartz, Kyrillos von Skythopolis, Texte und Untersuchungen 4/2 (Leipzig 1939) 101]). And a Manichaean tradition of an eschatological "Column of Glory" (Cologne Mani Codex 34, 6) circulated from the third century C.E.; see Gedaliahu Stroumsa, Aspects de l'eschatologie manich6enne, RHR 198 (1981) 176f., 177n.56; and Rabbinic parallels in L. Ginzberg, Legends of the Jews V (Philadelphia, 1968) 91n.49. 5 In an analysis of Theodoret's motivations in portraying the rise of asceticism and the decline of "paganism," Pierre Canivet described an ideology of replacement: "The hour was come, in effect when the temples of the pagans were disused or destroyed to cede place 197</page><page sequence="31">DAVID T. M. FRANKFURTER to the Christian cult; or, conversely, next to the forbidden sanctuary or the silenced oracle were erected martyrs' tombs.... Theodoret had the merit to attempt justification of this transfer or substitution by founding it on a theory to which several intellectuals could subscribe... [that is,] in order that his reader might pass from paganism to a Christianity where, without excluding oneself from one's regional identity, he should find a superior religion" (Histoire d'une entreprise apologetique au V sicle [Paris 1957] 108; emphasis mine). Thus in the case of Symeon Stylites, one of the Christian cults exhibiting most con- tinuity with local tradition, Theodoret had to show both the intrinsic value in this con- tinuity and the purity in its "underlying motivations." 76 Hist. Rel. 26, 12. The situation is nicely put by Brown, Holy Man, 112: "The hermit deliberately placed himself on the mountain tops, as a usurper of the power of the bacalim. From such tops, he could look down on prosperous villages and on the farmers working on the slopes. He belonged to a world that was not so much antithetical to village life as marginal." 77 Cf. Steven Fraade on the analysis of early Jewish asceticism: "scholars frequently argue that the extent to which a particular religious practice (or complex of practices) is considered ascetic is determined by the purpose that motivates that practice. Unfor- tunately, motivations for particular religious practices are frequently difficult to discern. They are most often left unarticulated, and when articulated are either ambiguous, manifold, fluid, or inconsistent within a particular religious system. The criterion of motivation of purpose provides a window through which ... subjective predispositions ... are bound to enter" (Ascetical Aspects of Ancient Judaism, Jewish Spirituality: From the Bible through the Middle Ages, ed. by Arthur Green [New York 1986] 254). 78 Brown, The Making of Late Antiquity (Cambridge 1978) passim; Town, Village, and Holy Man (loc. cit.); and Holy Man (loc. cit.). 79 The evidence for female stylites is sparse, but referred to in Voobus, History of Asceticism II, 273 and in Delehaye, Les femmes stylites, Analecta Bollandiana 27 (1908) 391-392. 80 The general morphology of Syrian asceticism, as described by Voobus, suggests that much of it grew out of traditional modes of behavior and expression. The self-destructive and even masochistic practices of ascetics while in ecstatic trances-Vo6bus even finds some evidence for self-castration (ibid. 257f.) and suicide (ibid. 28-33)-certainly recall the extravagant (and long abhorred by such western observers as Lucian-cf. idem, De Dea Syria 20, 51) mortifications of Atargatis and Cybele priests just a few centuries earlier in the same region. Thus Voobus observes the "Monasticism among the Syrians is not only autochthonous in its origin, but also is, spiritually, a definitely independent phenomenon, framed according to its own spiritual genius.... Mortification, in- dividualism, and the tendency towards mystical experiences marks its profile" (ibid. 315). '8 Ecclesiastical History 1, 14 (J. Bidez &amp; L.
