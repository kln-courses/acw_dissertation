SINCLAIR AND LOIS E. TETRICK Wayne State University, Department of Psychology, 71 West Warren Detroit, Michigan 48202, U.S.A. Summary In general, previous research suggests that the primary determinant of union members' level of union commitment is their satisfaction with the union's ability to secure desired levels of various work-related outcomes (wages, benefits etc.). This research is consistent with a social exchange based view of union commitment. Eisenberger et al. (1986, 1990) obtained support for the idea that social exchange is not entirely economic: perceptions of organizational support predicted several criteria. This study sought to extend organiz- ational support perceptions to the union setting and test the relative contribution of members' perceptions of union support and instrumentality to prediction of union commitment. Hypotheses were tested by surveying 77 employees of a small northeastern state university. Results of correlational and multiple regression analyses indicated that perceptions of union support accounted for more variance in union commitment than did union instrumentality. This result held for the union's instrumentality relative to both traditional bargaining issues and issues important only to faculty members. However, contrary to predictions, exchange ideology did not moderate relations between union instrumentality and union commitment or between union support and union commitment. Introduction After several years of relative disregard in the organizational behavior literature, union members' perceptions of their unions have become of increased interest to organizational researchers following Gordon, Philpot, Burt, Thompson and Spiller's (1980) study of members' commitment to their union. Gordon et al. define union commitment as consisting of loyalty to the union, willingness to work for the union, responsibility to the union, and belief in unionism. Recent studies of organizational behavior and attitudes have suggested that social exchange theory (e.g. Homans, 1974) is a useful framework for understanding company commitment (cf Eisenberger, Huntington, Hutchison and Sowa, 1986; Oglivie, 1986; Eisenberger, Fasolo and Davis-LaMastro, This paper treats the term 'organizational commitment' as a generic term that may refer to either a company or a union. Where appropriate, the terms 'company commitment' and 'union commitment' will be used to denote a specific locus of commitment. An earlier version of this paper was presented at the annual conference of the Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology, San Francisco, California (May, 1993). This paper was based, in part, on a masters thesis completed by the first author under direction of the second author. The authors would like to acknowledge the helpful comments of Lynn Anderson and Sheldon Alexander as well as the comments of three anonymous reviewers whose suggestions were 'instrumental' in improving the quality of this manuscript.

TETRICK 1990; Miles and Tetrick, 1993). Others suggest that this framework can be usefully applied to the study of union commitment (Tetrick, 1993). Further, while much of the literature on union members' attitudes has focused on the economic exchange relationship, Eisenberger et al. (1986, 1990) argue that non-economic aspects of exchange also are important in understanding individ- uals' relationships with organizations. They suggest that individuals' perceptions of organiz- ational support, (the organization's commitment to them as individuals) are an important determinant of organizational commitment. This paper extends this literature by examining union members' perceptions of their union's support and comparing the relative contributions of union support and union instrumentality to predictions of union commitment. Social exchange theory One of the most commonly used frameworks for understanding individuals' work-related atti- tudes and behaviors is social exchange theory (e.g. Blau, 1964; Homans, 1974). Social exchange theory suggests that rational self-interest drives people's social interactions. The theory can be extended to peoples' relationships with organizations. Eisenberger et al. (1986) propose that individuals form an 'anthropomorphic ascription of dispositional traits to the organization' (p. 500). This idea was derived from Levinson's (1965) suggestion that people 'personify' the organization. Therefore, individuals can be described as perceiving themselves to be in social exchange relationships with organizations of which they are members. From an exchange perspective, organizational commitment is based on a cognitive evaluation of the costs and benefits of remaining a member of an organization. As Tyler and Lind (1992) state: 'People enter and leave relationships depending on their judgments concerning the benefits and costs of remaining in the relationship ... people evaluate interactions in which they are involved in terms of rewards and costs, and by extension, people evaluate ... authorities ... in terms of what they gain and lose from the authority's decisions' (p. 120). This is consistent with Becker's (1960) idea of calculative commitment where individuals' commitment to organizations is, in part, a function of accumulated investments (in the form of job tenure, pension funds, seniority etc.). Perceived organizational support Eisenberger et al. (1986) have extended the company commitment literature by noting that the social exchange aspects of company commitment are not exclusively economic in nature. Individ- uals form perceptions of organizational support: beliefs about the extent to which the organization is committed to them as individuals, values their contributions, and is concerned with their needs and well-being. Based on social exchange theory, they propose that an individual's commitment to a company is a function of their perceptions of the company's commitment to them. They developed the Survey of Perceived Organizational Support (SPOS) to measure this construct and presented research findings indicating that perceived organizational support predicted absen- teeism. In a second study, Eisenberger et al (1990) found that perceptions of organizational support predicted organizational commitment, innovation (on behalf of the employee), and diligence. Further research has obtained support for the construct validity of the measure (Shore and Tetrick, 1991) and has indicated that organizational support perceptions are distinct from organizational identification (Miles and Tetrick, 1993) and mediate the relationships of supervisor support, coworker support, and HR practices with affective company commitment (Tetrick, Shore and Miles, 1993). Finally, Kottke and Sharafinski (1988) developed a parallel version of the SPOS to reflect supervisor support. Their results suggested a low relationship between the two</page><page sequence="3">UNION COMMITMENT 671 scales (r = 0.13) providing further evidence that the SPOS taps a unique aspect of workplace support. One area where support perceptions have not been sufficiently studied is union members' relations with their unions. Tetrick (1993) notes that the 'fundamental relation between an individual and the union is based on a different economic exchange relation than that between an individual and an employer' (1993, p. 2). Individuals are paid by an employer for their efforts while union members pay dues to reap the benefits of membership. Thus, the relationship between union commitment and company commitment is fundamentally asymmetrical. Company/union asym- metries in support perceptions are also possible. Organizational support perceptions that have been demonstrated to be important in employees' relationships with their company may not be of equal importance in union members' relations with their union. Traditional industrial relations thinking suggests that union instrumentality is of primary importance in member attachment to the union (Shore, Tetrick, Sinclair and Newton, 1994). Union instrumentality is the union members' perceptions of the union's ability to secure desired outcomes. Newton and Shore (1992) point out that instrumentality is usually examined in studies of union certification voting. The company support literature (e.g. Eisenberger et al., 1986; 1990) suggests that union commitment would be, in part, a function of member perceptions of the union's commitment to them (i.e. support). However, given the exchange asymmetry between unions and companies (Tetrick, 1993) and that union commitment may be primarily a function of union instrumentality, research is needed to clarify the role of union support perceptions in the maintenance of union commitment. In the only known study to use the SPOS to tap union support perceptions, Shore et al. (1994) used a modified version of the SPOS to assess union members' perceptions of their union rather than their company. Confirmatory factor analysis results indicated that union support perceptions were distinct from both union commitment and union instrumentality. The present study extends Shore et al.'s research by examining the relative contribution of perceived union support and union instrumentality to the prediction of union commitment. While union support and union instrumentality are closely related constructs, they can be distinguished. Instrumentality refers to the union's ability to secure a desired outcome (usually, but not necessarily, an economic concern). Support perceptions refer to the members' sense of the union's concern for their well-being. A union could, for example, have great concern for its membership but have little real influence over certain issues that might be important to its membership. Conversely, members could see the union as able to secure benefits such as high wages, good working conditions etc., but have little concern for the well-being of individual members. Therefore, it is hypothesized that union support will account for a significant proportion of union commitment variance, beyond that which is accounted for by union instrumentality. Exchange ideology The contention of Eisenberger et al. (1986) was that individuals form an 'ideology' or belief regarding the extent to which their behavior should be a function of treatment by the organization. They termed this belief one's exchange ideology. Witt (1991la,b; Witt and Wilson, 1990) character- izes exchange ideology as the extent to which an individual's attitudes and behavior are dependent on organizational reinforcement. Exchange ideology is thought to be a 'dispositional orientation' that is global in nature rather than specific to any particular organization (Witt and Wilson, 1990). While social exchange refers to the relationship (in this case) between an individual and an organization, exchange ideology can be thought of as a preexisting general belief system that the individual brings to the exchange relationship. In the case of a union as the relevant organization, a union member with a strong exchange</page><page sequence="4">672 R. R. SINCLAIR AND L. E. TETRICK ideology will become involved with the union to the extent that they perceive benefits (both economic and emotional) from involvement. Instrumentality beliefs would influence union commitment to a lesser extent for individuals with weak exchange ideologies. A member with a weak exchange ideology would be less likely to base his or her commitment to the union on benefits they derive from union membership. The same relations are hypothesized for perceptions of union support. Individuals with strong exchange ideologies would be expected to be less committed to their union if they believed that the union was not concerned with their needs. Members with weak exchange ideologies would not base their union commitment on their perceptions of concern for their well-being. The conceptual analysis above suggests that exchange ideology would moderate the relationship between perceptions of union support and union commitment as well as the relationship between union instrumentality and union commitment. This is supported by previous research indicating that exchange ideology moderated relations between various organizational perceptions and criteria. Eisenberger et al. (1986) found that exchange ideology moderated the relationship between perceived support and absenteeism in a sample of high school teachers. Perceived organizational support was more strongly related to absenteeism for teachers with medium to strong exchange ideologies than for teachers with weak exchange ideologies. Thus, teachers who believed that their behavior should be a function of treatment by the organization were less likely to be absent from work if they believed that the organization was committed to them. Other research also suggests a moderating role for exchange ideology. Witt (199la) found that exchange ideology moderated the relationship between individuals' beliefs about the existence of equal opportunity for advancement in their organization and resultant job satisfaction and perceptions of procedural justice. Witt and Wilson (1990) found that exchange ideology moder- ated the relationship between income sufficiency and both job satisfaction and organizational commitment. Further, Witt (199 ib) also found that exchange ideology moderated the relationship between perceived organizational support and organizational citizenship behavior. Based on these findings, this study tests the hypothesis that exchange ideology moderates the relationship between union support perceptions and union commitment as well as the relationship between union instrumentality perception and union commitment. Method Sample Surveys were sent to 363 faculty and support staff of a small northeastern state university. A letter accompanying the survey indicated that it was to be used for research purposes only. A reminder letter was sent to all university employees approximately two weeks after the surveys were distributed. Eighty-nine usable surveys were returned for an overall response rate of 25 per cent. This rate differed substantially depending on the respondent's occupation. The response rate for service and maintenance workers was so low (&lt; 1 per cent) that individuals from this occupation were not considered in further analyses. Thus, the final number of usable surveys was 77 from three types of occupation. The response rate by occupation was full and part-time faculty (n = 40) 36 per cent; professionals (n = 17) 45 per cent; technical/support including clerical, library and office support staff (n = 20) 55 per cent. For the three groups, the combined response rate was 42 per cent. Information on the representativeness of the sample was not available.</page><page sequence="5">UNION COMMITMENT 673 Measures Perceived union support Perceived support was measured with a modified version (15 items) of the Survey of Perceived Organizational Support (SPOS) developed by Eisenberger et al. (1986). The SPOS was modified by substituting 'my union' for the word 'organization' in each item as appropriate ('My union cares about my general satisfaction at work'). Respondents were asked to respond on a five-point scale (1 = strongly disagree, 5 = strongly agree) indicating the extent to which they agreed with the items. Exchange ideology Exchange ideology was assessed by the five-item scale developed by Eisenberger et al. (1986) with items modified to reflect the fact that a union was the reference rather than a company ('The failure of my union to appreciate an individual's contribution should not affect the extent to which he or she is involved with it'). The items were anchored with a five-point scale (1 = strongly disagree,5 = strongly agree). Union instrumentality Union instrumentality was assessed with 21 items arranged in a format adapted from Chacko (1985). The scale was expanded in an attempt to capture the instrumental issues relevant specifi- cally to faculty and staff in a university setting (issues such as academic freedom, committee membership requirements, and undergraduate advising load were added) in addition to those typically perceived as important for all employees (e.g. wages, job responsibilities). Respondents were asked to rate the extent of influence of the union on a five-point scale (1 = the (union) is not at all influential, 5 = the (union) is influential to a very great extent). Prior to data analysis, 11 raters (who were either staff or faculty members from the author's psychology department) were asked to indicate whether each issue was primarily of concern to faculty or of concern to any university staff member. Based on their ratings, two of the 21 issues were dropped because of low (&lt; 80 per cent) agreement between raters; the remaining 19 items were divided into a scale representing 'academic instrumentality' (e.g. research space, academic freedom) and a scale representing 'traditional instrumentality' (e.g. wages, fringe benefits, job security). Union commitment Union commitment was measured with 26 items from Gordon et al.'s (1980) union commitment scale. This scale has four dimensions including union loyalty: 'a sense of pride in the association with the union and its membership ... a clear awareness of benefits accruing to the individual stemming from membership' (p. 485); responsibility to the union: 'the degree of willingness to fulfil the day to day obligations and duties of a member, in order to protect the interests of the union' (p. 485); willingness to work for the union: 'a member's readiness to do special work on behalf of the union ... indicating the willingness of a member to spend extra energy on behalf of the union "above and below the call of duty"' (p. 485); and belief in unionism: a globalized belief in the general principles of unionism. Respondents used a five-point scale (1 = strongly disagree, 5 = strong agree) to indicate their agreement with items from all four dimensions: loyalty (13 items, e.g. 'I feel little loyalty towards the union'); responsibility (seven items, 'It is the duty of every member to "keep his or her ears open" for information that might be useful to my union'); willingness to work for the union (four items, 'I am willing to put in a great deal of effort beyond that normally expected in order to make my union successful') and belief in unionism (two items, 'As long as I am doing the kind of work I enjoy, it does not matter if I belong to the union'). Tetrick, Thacker and Fields (1989) obtained confirmatory factor analytic evidence of the four-dimensional structure of a 29-item version of the union commitment scale.

Results Before testing the hypotheses, a MANOVA was performed to examine differences among faculty and non-faculty respondents. The results of this analysis indicated that there were no significant multivariate differences between faculty and non-faculty on the four dimensions of union commit- ment, support, traditional instrumentality, academic instrumentality, or exchange ideology. Fur- ther, the assumption of homogeneity of covariance matrices was met justifying combing the faculty and non-faculty for the remaining analyses. However, only faculty members were included for analyses using the academic issues instrumentality measure. Table 1 shows the scale means, standard deviations, reliabilities (coefficient alpha) and intercor- relations for the total sample. Loyalty (a = 0.93), responsibility (a = 0.73), willingness to work for the union (a = 0.89), traditional instrumentality (a = 0.93), academic instrumentality (a = 0.92) and perceived union support (a = 0.94) all achieved acceptable internal consistency. The reliabilities for belief in unionism (a = 0.55) and exchange ideology (a = 0.64) were low but acceptable given low numbers of items comprising the scale (two and five respectively). In order to test the possibility that common method variance accounts for the correlations, a one-factor confirmatory factor analysis was performed. A one-factor solution provided a poor fit to the data, even when exchange ideology (which was not related to an other variable) was excluded from the analysis (x2 = 131, df 14, p &lt; 0.001; GFI = 0.68, AGFI = 0.37). The relative contribution of union support and union instrumentality to each dimension of union commitment was assessed using a t-test of the difference in magnitude between the support and instrumentality correlations with each commitment dimension. These results are summarized in Table 2. Support was more strongly related to each dimension of union commitment than was traditional instrumentality (for loyalty: support = 0. 81, rinstrumentality = 0. 58, t74 = 6.24,p &lt; 0. 01; for responsibility to the union rsupport = 0.73, rinstrumentality = 0.63, t74 = 2.40,p &lt; 0.01; for willingness to work for the union support = 0.68, rinstrumentality = 0.36, t74 = 7.20, p &lt; 0.01; and for belief in unionism rsupport = 0.78, rinstrumentality = 0.63, t74 = 3.88, p &lt; 0.05). A similar pattern of results was obtained for a comparison between union support and academic instrumentality (using faculty members only). Support was more strongly related to each dimension of commitment (p &lt; 0.01 for all tests) than was academic instrumentality. Union member perceptions of the union's commit- Table 2.

The same pattern holds for faculty members' perceptions of their union's influence over 'academic' issues. Union support was more strongly related to each dimension of union commitment than was either academic or traditional issues instrumentality. Hypothesis 1 proposed that union support perceptions would account for additional variance in union commitment beyond that explained by union instrumentality. The second hypothesis was that exchange ideology would moderate the support-commitment and instrumentality-commit- ment relationships. Hierarchical moderated multiple regression was used to test these hypotheses (Cohen and Cohen, 1975; Stone and Hollenbeck, 1984). Following a procedure outlined by Aiken and West (1991) the predictor variables were 'centered' (by subtracting the variable mean from each persons' score) prior to use in the regression equations. This procedure is recommended to reduce potential multicolinearity problems associated with mulitiplicative composites. For each dimension of union commitment, a regression equation was computed using only union instrumentality. Then, a second equation was computed predicting union commitment from both instrumentality and perceived union support. Differences in the proportion of union commit- ment variance accounted for by these two equations provide an index of the unique union commitment variance accounted for by union support perceptions. To evaluate the second hypothesis exchange ideology and the exchange ideology-support and exchange ideology-in- strumentality interaction terms were entered on subsequent steps. Two sets of equations were</page><page sequence="9">UNION COMMITMENT 677 constructed; one set used union support and traditional instrumentality with the entire sample; the second set used only faculty members and compared union support with academic issues in- strumentality. Results of these analyses are presented in Table 3. While the magnitude-difference tests of the zero order correlations support the first hypothesis, a more direct test is provided by hierarchical regression analysis. Table 3 presents the multiple R2 and changes in R2 for each analysis. In each case entry of union support accounted for significant incremental variance in union commitment. These results strongly support hypothesis 1. Members' perceptions of their unions' commitment to them are related to their commitment to the union. Individuals who perceive that the union values their opinion and is concerned with their well-being are more likely to feel both loyal and responsible to the union, have a greater willingness to work on the unions' behalf, and are more likely to hold strong beliefs in the principles of unionism. Academic issues instrumentality was not related to union commitment. Faculty members' attachments to their union do not seem to be related to their perceptions of the unions' influence over issues of concern to faculty members. It should be noted that faculty members reported low levels (mean = 1.78) of union influence over these issues, suggesting that they are not a focus of their union's bargaining efforts. Table 3 also presents the partial correlations for perceived union support and traditional issues union instrumentality relative to each dimension of union commitment. When instrumentality was controlled for, perceived union support was still strongly related to each dimension (loyaltypr = 0.66; responsibilitypr = 0.45; willingness to workpr = 0.62; belief in unionismpr = 0.47). On the other hand, instrumentality was uniquely related to responsibility (pr = 0.34) and belief in unionism (pr = 0.34) but not to loyalty or willingness to work for the union. These results suggest that union commitment is more strongly related to union support perceptions than union instrumentality; this is particularly true for loyalty to the union and willingness to work for the union. Table 3 presents the equation multiple R2 and changes in R2 when exchange ideology and the interaction terms representing the interaction of exchange ideology with support and instru- mentality were entered into the equations predicting union commitment. Since no theoretical rationale dictated order of entry of the interaction terms, both were entered on the same step. This provides a conservative test of the interaction hypothesis. In no case did entry of exchange ideology explain significant incremental variance in union commitment. Hypothesis 2 could not be supported, exchange ideology does not appear to moderate the relations between union support and union commitment or between union instrumentality and union commitment. Discussion Conclusions reached from this study should be tempered by awareness of the limitations of small-sample cross-sectional research. The small sample size affects the power and stability of any data analysis. Further, the somewhat low reliabilities for belief in unionism and exchange ideology may attenuate their relations with other variables. While not typical of union research, the low overall response rate (25 per cent) suggests the possibility that respondents are different from non-respondents in some way that might influence the results. Members with higher levels of perceived support or union commitment may be more motivated to complete attitude surveys about their union. Information on the representativeness of the sample was not available. Notwithstanding these limitations, this study extends our understanding of the role of social exchange theory in union members' attitudes toward their union. The results suggest that perceived organizational support extends to the union setting. Union</page><page sequence="10">678 R. R. SINCLAIR AND L. E. TETRICK members appear to forma general belief about the extent to which their union is committed to them. Members who felt that their union was supportive reported higher levels of loyalty, responsibility, willingness to work for the union, and belief in unionism. It may be the case that traditional instrumentality concerns may play a greater role than perceived support in certification or joining decisions. Support perceptions most likely arise from day to day experiences with the union and its agents (other members, stewards etc.). Consequently, once a union is established - after its members have made the joining decision - perceived support may be the more important factor in establishing and maintaining commitment to the union. More research is needed to explicate these relationships. It is noted that all three of the unions included in this study could be considered 'white-collar' unions. Alderfer and Guzzo (1979) point out that white-collar union members may be less concerned with the more traditional issues that historically have been the focus of trade unionism. Evaluation of the union may be based more on the support of the union for their needs and opinions than is the case for trade unions. The finding that the pattern of results for faculty was similar to non-faculty white-collar union members implies that faculty are similar to white-collar non-faculty. This result supports the notion that studies of faculty members may be generalizable to other white-collar professional occupations. However, since both the faculty and non-faculty came from the same organization it may be the case that the attitudes of non-faculty university employees are likely to be similar to those of faculty at the same university (working for and bargaining with the same administration). The low mean level of academic instrumentality in this sample suggests that members may perceive their union to have little influence or concern with these types of issues. More research is needed comparing faculty with other types of white and blue-collar union members in both university and non-university settings to address the generaliz- ability of these findings. Exchange ideology was not related to any other variable in this study. Further, contrary to predictions, it did not moderate the support-commitment or instrumentality-commitment re- lations. Eisenberger et al.'s (1986) construct was developed with reference to a company rather than a union setting; it may be the case that changing the referent of these items to a union, is not appropriate. As Tetrick (1993) notes, the fundamental exchange relation between a union member and a union is different than that between an employee and a company. Union members must pay dues to maintain their relationship with the union, while a company's employees are paid by the company to maintain the employment relationship. The role of exchange ideology in organiz- ational commitment may be an additional aspect of union-company asymmetry. Individual differences in exchange orientations may not be important in the social environment of a union where collectivity and solidarity are emphasized. Further conceputulization'of exchange ideology is clearly needed to understand its role in organizational commitment. For instance, a third type of organizational exchange relationship would be between an individual and a voluntary organiz- ation (e.g. a charity group). It is not clear what the role of exchange ideology would be in this context. A second aspect of exchange ideology that needs to be clarified is the meaning of the 'strong' and 'weak' ends of the continuum. As conceptualized by Eisenberger et al. (1986) a person who would exert extra effort for (and hold positive attitudes toward) the organization no matter what economic and/or social reinforcements they received would have a weak exchange ideology. The same would be true for the person who would not exert extra effort for (or hold positive attitude toward) the organization under any circumstances. It seems unlikely that these two types of individuals have identical exchange orientations as would be the case in Eisenberger et al.'s (1986) conceptualization. The current findings may have implications for dual commitment research. For instance, research could be directed toward understanding the need for affective support from either the</page><page sequence="11">UNION COMMITMENT 679 union or the organization. One issue to address is whether support from the union increases, decreases, or it not related to attachment to the company. Members may adopt a resource allocation approach; involvement and attachment to company and union may be a function of the support provided by their company and/or union. Alternatively, attachments to the company and union may be independent, each being related to the degree of support provided by that organiz- ation. These relations may be influenced by the perceived instrumentality and/or effectiveness of each organization. Eisenberger et al. (1986) suggest that organizational support may be interpreted as the individ- ual's perception of the organization's commitment to the employee. This study supports a social exchange based model of union commitment in which union commitment may be a function of, not only the member's perception of the union's ability to address member's economic needs (e.g. pay, benefits), but also the members' perception of the union's commitment to the member as evidenced by its concern for members' non-economic needs.
