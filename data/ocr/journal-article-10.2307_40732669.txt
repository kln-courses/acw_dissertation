MASAO As an ancient form of human expression, rock art is the major surviving record of the non-material aspect of prehistoric and protohistoric cultures. This form of expression has been interpreted differently by different researchers and in different places. The traditional theories of motivation, i.e. (i) A magical intent to influence or control the subject whose picture is represented on the rock panel (sympathetic magic) and (ii) The art for art's sake theory, are still held fervently by some people though the con- cept of sympathetic magic has been relaxed to accomodate diverse interpretations such as ritual, belief, medicinal, etc. The theory "art for art's sake," is in direct opposition to that of sympathetic magic. It is based on the premises that human beings have an inherent and instinctive desire to express themselves artistically and to derive pleasure and satisfaction from the act. As such, some of the paintings would therefore be interpreted as attempts by the artist at aesthetic, perhaps in order to decorate his surroundings. (Ucko and Rosenfeld 1967: 117-119, Willcox 1963: 84,Cooke 1969: 150, Vinnicombe 1972: 192,Masao 1979: 268.) While there are supporters of either of the two main theories of rock art interpretation, in general the philosophies encoded and conveyed through prehistoric art are not readily intel- ligible to many of us. In the absence of direct association between the prehistoric painters and extant peoples, the researcher may have to modify his approach. In this regard, it is relevant to take note of Vinnicombe's observations: "Interpretations of art often fail to recognize the multiplicity of factors involved in preliterate communication," visual images integrate a complex multi-dimensional cross-referencing mechanism of encoded information. This may include the origin and perpetuation of life, the transmission and main- tenance of laws and values, social and political organization, the relief of tension, cultural and ter- ritorial markers, economic and spiritual relationships to land, and above all, the maintenance of balance between the forces of nature and human manipulation of these forces". (Vinnicombe 1986: 94). However, recent ethnohistorical investigations are beginning to show that viewing the rock art as a response to aesthetical and subsistence needs is simplistic and misleading. In southern Africa, Lewis Williams (1981) and Vinnicombe (1972) among others, have shown that there is some direct link between the art and the extant people, a situation which has made ethnohistorical interpretation of the subject matter and scenes represented in the rock paintings and engravings meaningful. In Australia, Vinnicombe (1986) has reported that where direct associations persist between rock art and Aboriginal culture, the process of matching archaeological to anthropological data has yet to realize its full potential. She has observed that despite claims of ownership of sites by custodians of the associated clans, the representations are ascribed not to human source but to the supernatural period of creation 1 An earlier version of this paper was presented at the World Archaeological Congress, Southampton, UK, September l-7th 1986.</page><page sequence="2">t/ ' I /S'N-N. i- KENYA ZAMBIA """^---., ^ ""-·-.-.- % 0 400 km f '^-' "^ "^ - ^, . _^ · - · -^ Yy.

This shows that even in cases which would be thought of as being straight forward, there is an element of uncertainty and sacredness shrouding peoples' be- liefs, about rock art. On the other hand, viewing all the paintings and engravings as motivated by sympathetic magic is tantamount to seing the art as "functional" or "utilitarian" and related to the securance of food only (Masao 1979: 265). The limited ethnohistorical studies of some of the people who are or may be associated with the rock paintings and the sites, suggest that there may have been a multiplicity of factors connected with rock art. The people inhabiting central Tanzania belong to what Murdock calls the Rift cluster of Tanganyika Bantu which includes Wanyaturu, Wagogo, Wanyiramba and Warangi (Fig. 1). All these have related traditions in one way or another, but the Wanyiramba and Wanyaturu are more closely related. All possess a fair amount of cattle but the Wanyaturu and Wagogo have the highest number of livestock. Both are known to brand cattle by inscribing designs on the hide with a hot iron (Schneider 1970). The art of painting among the Wanyaturu is reported to be known from historical times (Schneider 1970: 151), and I dare to say, from prehistorical times. In historical times however, there is evidence to suggest, painting was motivated, inter alia, by the desire to express oneself in graphics as argued later on. There are four main categories of the subject matter: animals, anthropomorphic figures, objects, and signs and symbols (Figs. 2-6). Animals I have not worked out the proportional relationship of the animal representations com- pared to those of humans but the former are clearly the more. Animals are depicted in re- presentational naturalistic and semi naturalistic styles, mostly in shades of red ochreous paint, but also ashy or latex white. Less frequent are paintings in black and shades of brown. In rare occasions, there are pictographs of domesticates such as cattle, goats, sheep and dogs. Hunians Humans are as common as animals, but unlike the latter, they are depicted either in high- ly stylized semi naturalistic forms. In the former the head is represented by a simple blob or a small circle. The trunk and limbs are always exaggerated especially in the figures executed in shades of ochreous red. As M.D. Leakey (1983) has correctly observed, nearly all of them are drawn with very elongated bodies. Usually they are depicted in small groups or pairs and in a number of cases they appear to be associated with some kind of activity. In the latter, the final product is a fuzzy outlined silhouette aptly described as degenerate. Almost in- variably, the medium is a shade of latex or white pigment. Objects These are representational depictions found especially in the Iramba sites, but for which precise identification has not been possible. There have been suggestions that they represent</page><page sequence="4">192 F.T. Masao ethnographic objects such as fish weir, bird cages, traps, or even the skeletal woodwork of a hut. On the other hand, there are clear pictures of bows and arrows, but spears are infre- quent. Plants are as a rule rare. Signs/Symbols, Enigmatic forms The most interesting of the signs and symbols are the circle and rays, the concentrics, the spiral, and what for want of a better word are referred to as clan or individual artists' signs e.g. cattle ownership signs. In this same category are the geometries such as lines, squares, ladders, plain circles, etc. Finally there are also a few portrayals of what until now has re- mained emigmatic and unintelligible. Some of these, it has been speculated represented clan spirits, satan or even dragons. One also encounters dots and doodlings. Among the animals, the giraffe is the most common single species represented; an ob- servation which has led me to surmise whether this animal has any special mythological significance among the people, similar perhaps to that of the eland among the San. However, in the absence of a link between the pictographs and the painters, the significance, if any, of the giraffe cannot be established. Attempts to look for an explanation from the legends and mythologies of the Wasandawe, Wagogo, Warangi, Wanyiramba, Wanyatura and Wanyisanzu peoples who inhabit the area of central Tanzania with the highest concentration of rock art have been in vain. Many elders assured me that there is nothing special about the giraffe and that to the hunter is nothing special about the giraffe and that to the hunter it does not have a place different from other animals. However, I was a little sceptical and consequently, I investigated further. The giraffe is obviously a very majestic animal. Standing aloft other animals and towering above the canopy of the acacia trees, it is in a class by itself. To crown it all, the reticulae pattern of the skin makes it very attractive. Could the ancient painters have been touched by these qualities? Ethnohistorical investigation shows that the Wanyaturu who are closely related to the Wanyiramba, Wagogo and Warangi have different aesthetic concepts. For example, they use Luhinda to refer to visible aesthetically pleasing ornamentations. It excludes songs and tactile sensation. It is designs which are geometrical or otherwise patterned having rhythm, symmetry and balance, but no precise symbolic meaning. A painted wall would not bQ Lu- hinda, but one with designs drawn or painted within its edges would be considered as such. (Schneider 1966: 156). By the same token, a picture of an animal such as the giraffe or a painted rock shelter would be considered Luhinda. On the other hand, designs such as the geometries which are also found in rock art sites are less of Luhinda but are called Nsale. This design would also include the scarification of the body and ornamentation of flour gourds. Nsaasia is an aesthetic skill or a quality in an object that has a pleasing or aesthetic effect. It is not natural but associated with human skill, i.e. the ability to use tools. The aesthetic qualities of nsaasia are regularity, smoothness, symmetry, cleanliness and colour. Finally for the Wanyaturu, a voluntary action which makes people happy such as nsaasia is majighana. Nature can produce valuable and pleasant things, but when they are artifacts, they are some- thing special (Schneider 1966: 157-59). Assuming that some of the prehistoric painters in central Tanzania, especially in Singida-Iramba area, were people who have connections, ge- neric or cultural, with present Wanyaturu, it is quite plausible, based on the aesthetic con-</page><page sequence="5">Possible Meaning of the Rock Art of Central Tanzania 1 93 cepts of but not necessarily restricted to the Wanyaturu, to speculate and surmise whether some of the rock paintings, especially the naturalistic and geometries, were not executed to offer aesthetical satisfaction to the painter and the viewers. Unlike other peoples inhabiting the central Tanzania rock art belt, the Sandawe claim historical links with the authorship of the painting in Sandaweland. Of more interest are their legends and myths relating to the practice of painting and use of the sites. The Wasan- dawe like many other African peoples believe that offended spirits may bring disasters, not only to hunters and their families, but also interfere with the game so that the hunt remains unsuccessful. When this happens, they offer propitiatory services after the hunt. It has been further reported that they also perform hunting rituals of a different kind with a view to in- duce magic. This may take the form of the hunter making an effigy of the animal he hopes to kill. Ten Raa claims to have seen Wasandawe hunters making effigies of animals they wanted to kill on a mud plastered wall and on sand (Ten Raa 1971: 43-44). In this case, sympathetic magic as a strong motivation in painting is indisputable. Consequently, some of the scenes depicted on the rock shelters have been interpreted as highlighting one or several aspects of hunting; e.g. animals bleeding, people with arrows, animals in fallen-down pose, etc. Time and again people have remarked that in depicting the human form, there is a strong preference for schematic styles as opposed to the naturalistic ones employed in depicting animals. This has again been cited as being connected with sympathetic magic. The author knows some artists, wood carvers to be specific, who refuse to engage in carving the human body. One of them said "The human body has been created by God and made sacred and as such it is a sacrilegious to try to recreate it". Even today there are several people throughout the world who believe that nail paring, hair trimming, old used clothes, etc. left out carelessly, might cause illness or death to the owner and accordingly, such practices are taboo. For the same reason, it may have been considered dangerous to leave an accurate picture of oneself on the rock panel. Aside from sympathetic magic, ethnohistorical sources also suggest that some rock paint- ings and rock art sites play a role in at least two of the peoples' mythological and cosmo- logical relationship with the underworld. While for instance the Wanyiramba are known to venerate rock art sites by offering sacrifices at the site and throwing cow dung at the panel with paintings in order to appease the spirits, the Wasandawe observe even a stricter relation- ship with rock painting sites. The later are considered the abode of clan spirits and as such should be approached with care and reverence. Not only are the sacrificial sites kept a secret, but no trees may be cut in the area nor any noise made lest the spirits should be disturbed and their displeasure thus incurred. This practice may be referred to as sacrificial rock art which is fundamentally different from the magic act associated with hunting (Ten Raa 1971 : 47). The sacrifices are animals which are slaughtered at the site in order to seek appeasement and cooperation of the spirits in such matters as rainfall, health, good harvest etc. The blood of the animal (domestic) and the stomach contents are sprinkled on the surrounding rocks after which the clan's leader draws a picture of the sacrificial animal on the rock face of the site. This extra effort required in drawing the picture is seen as an intensification of the sacrificing while the painting's greater longevity creates a longer lasting effect (Ten Raa 1971 : 45). This observation tempts one to surmise whether the Wanyiramba who as already pointed out, venerate rock art sites and are also known to sprinkle the stomach contents of cow at the rock panel, did not also paint the rock shelters.</page><page sequence="6">194 FT. Masao In many cases not only were impressive rock shelters chosen as rock painting sites, but either deliberate efforts were made to paint at very difficult to reach sites or at heights for which some scaffolding must have been used. This feature has been cited by many authors (Fosbrook 1952, Masao 1976, 1979) as evidence of how serious or sacred painting must have been. In connection with this, is the fact that many impressive rock shelters even when they do not have rock paintings, are associated with witchcraft. Among such rockshelters are Ki- mai, Mungungusu and Mpembu in the Ihanja region. It is reported that when the powers of such bewitching rocks are utilized, it is possible for the whole of one village to bewitch the whole of another (Schneider 1970: 124). Among the Wanyiramba, such rock shelters were associated with rainmaking ceremonies and to date some of them still have huge wooden drums. No one theory can be invoked to explain the motivations behind all forms of rock art. Most probably, the representational art forms were produced for completely different pur- poses from those producing the geometries and the symbols. It is tempting to speculate whether some were not mnemonic devices or means of encoding, storing, learning and trans- mitting information. The geometric forms and symbols may have been painted for this pur- pose. In this connection, a painting from Kinyasi 1 B15 site comes to mind (Fig. 7). Whatever it depicts, it is quite reasonable to surmise whether this was not an attempt at recording the flat roofed tembe-type dwelling which is the traditional house type typical for central Tan- zania. The latter is also the area in which rock painting are concentrated. Later Stone Age hunters would be capable of erecting the basic woodwork structure of this kind of dwelling. However, the rarity of comparable paintings in other sides and the abundance of rock shelters ideal for the protection against the elements renders this specula- tion inconceivable. On the other hand, it is tempting to interpret the painting as more likely representing a trap constructed of baulks of timber implanted in the ground and roofed over with further timber. Similar traps are constructed today to capture lions, leopards and other predators (Fosbrooke 1980: 395). One of the symbols which has been the subject of much discussion in the literature is the different form of the circle; the circle and rays, the concentric circles and the spirals (Fig. 8). These have a wide geographical distribution in east and central Africa. Ethnographical and historical analogy suggests that the circle and lines is the head of seemingly human representation whereby the concentric circles and the head is a sunlike pattern attached to what gives an impression of a spinal column with attached horizontal ribs. "The probability here is that there was an assimilation of the image of the human head to the sun, and that in some contexts, the image of the human body is implicated in some generally significant cosmological ideas". (Keeny 1976: 150). This view is supported by reference to material concerning symbolism of chieftainship in the extant cultures of south of Lake Victoria. In some of these cultures, the similarity of the chief to the sun, is a quite explicit one but the symbols associated with the chieftainship, are like the symbolism of the rock paintings obscure. The spiral which may be seen as a variant of the concentric circle, appears as an emblem of chieftainship almost all over south of Lake Victoria. The emblem is usually made from the sawn off base of a conus shell and is worn on the forehead of the chief attached by a headband of a lion skin. The symbol is also found among the Wasukuma, Wanyamwezi and Wakimbu chiefs (Kenny 1976: 152). The spiral may elsewhere be a lunar symbol, but the Wakimbu are quite positive it represents the sun. One</page><page sequence="7">Possible Meaning of the Rock Art of Central Tanzania 195 can argue that if the sun were regarded as a manifestation of a personified being as is the case among the Wakimbu, then it can be supposed that the various circular spiral and sunlike paint- ings of the rock painting complex were the icons of such a being, in which case the act of painting was an act of invocation or magical control (Kenny 1976: 150). A further link in this chain1 is presented by the phenomenon of the identification of the deity with the sun which is very widespread in Tanzania. This observation may suggest that cult activities involving personages like chiefs, spiritual being or metaphysical concepts were performed and that symbols were used in relation to common ideas. It is possible that cult leaders, diviners and secret society members partook of similar symbolism; through rock art they may have attempted to control spiritual beings, which were in certain respects, manifest in the chief himself (Kenny 1976: 152). One of several scenes encountered especially in the rock painting sites in Singida is that in which a snake like creature, possibly a python, is depicted (Fig. 9). Although I have not heard of snake men guilds in this part of Tanzania, few kilometers west of the area one en- counters the powerful snake men guilds of the Wanyamwezi, a people with whom both the Wanyiramba and Wanyaturu come into contact. As such it would be quite easy for the ideas of snake men to diffuse eastwards to the Wanyiramba and Wanyaturu country. "The snake-men guild was an establishment in which medicine craft and ancestral worship were closely interwoven - a logical conclusion in as much as the serpent is a traditional symbol of both in the practices and beliefs of many (primitive) peoples" (Carnochan 1935 : 14). Knowledge of herbs and snakes was necessary in order to be able to cure the ill and placate ancestral spirit. The student who passes the moral test, is initiated into the snake guild and after many years of apprenticeship can set up business in a village which has no snake man and soon becomes one of the most powerful persons in the village (Carnochan 1935: 45-46). If knowledge of snakes was so important, it is conceivable that their depiction in rock shelters which might also have been their abode would be expected. Perhaps painting the snake on the rock shelter was a way of assuring oneself of the permanency of the powers to cure and to communicate with ancestral spirits. It has now, I hope become apparent that in trying to understand the motivation behind the rock paintings of central Tanzania, no single explanation seems to promise the answer. Rather should the interpretation be sought from a multiplicity of factors which will be in- volved in the mythologies, beliefs and communications of these early communities. The lack of direct historical connection, except in the case of the Wasandawe, makes the research difficult and at best conjectural, but the author believes that more rigorous ethnohistorical fieldwork may change this rather bleak outlook and establish some connection between the extant people and some part of the rock paintings (the later styles).</page><page sequence="8">Fig. 2.
