<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Uncourted Menina: Brazil's Portuguese Heritage Stuart B. Schwartz There is a famous painting by Maria Margarida entitled "Tres Meninas da Mesma Rua," which is often reproduced in books on Brazil.1 This painting symbolically depicts three beautiful girls representing each of the three major racial components of Brazilian society: Indian, Negro, and white. Anthropologists and other social scientists, perhaps lured by the exotic, have ardently courted the first two young ladies in the sense that much attention has been given to the Indian and Negro elements in Brazilian society. The white girl, however, has been neglected. This is especially true of the Portuguese element of Brazil which is obviously so crucial for an understanding of Brazil's past and present. Monograph after monograph can be found on almost all facets of the Negro and Indian contributions to Brazilian culture but information on the Portu- guese remains scarce. This lack, however, is not wholly the fault of Brazilianists, for research on Portugal itself has been relatively neglected. C. J. Bishko, of the University of Virginia, has noted the problem in a discussion of the Iberian background of Latin America: "More neglected by contemporary scholars than the Indian or Negro sociology, this subject tends to remain at nineteenth-century levels, plagued by fossilized generalizations and racial and nationalistic prejudices, by embryonic research and neglect of modem sociological techniques."2 Perhaps, as Professor Bishko sug- gests, the peninsula background is overlooked or avoided because it is too large or too common to merit the same attention that has been given to the more exotic elements. If this has been the case it must cease. The 1 For example, see Brazil: Portrait of Half a Continent, ed. T.

The Portuguese heritage of Brazil can be examined on two different levels. One is the administrative, official aspect which amounts to the history of Portuguese colonial control of Brazil. The other is the social and cultural heritage transferred not by the government of Portugal, but by the Portuguese people. The two are at many points difficult to separate, but it is the social and cultural tradition which will be discussed here. What were the characteristics of the Portuguese colonizers? What aspects of Brazilian life are the result of Lusitanian influence? These are the primary questions. Almost everyone who writes on Brazil agrees that the common denominator of Brazilian culture is basically Portuguese. There remains to be studied, however, what these elements are, what changes they underwent, and how they were integrated into Brazilian culture.3 Certainly, the starting point of an examination of Brazil's cultural debt to Portugal must be a discussion of the development and character of the Portuguese people. The Portuguese at the time of the conquest of Brazil were not a racially homogenous group and their culture was a result of a variety of contacts and developments. The original Lusitanians had, through contact with Phoenicians, Romans, French and English knights, Moors, Jews, and Negroes, acquired a complex of traditions and values which formed the basis of Portuguese society.4 In a sense the Portuguese were a people of mixed cultural and racial heritage, a fact that would be important in their settlement of Brazil. Aside from the variety of Portugal's cultural elements, there are other complicating factors. Portugal, like the rest of the Iberian Peninsula, is divided into geographical and cultural regions and sub-regions, and gen- eralizations are usually extremely superficial. Then, too, differences of values between classes within the same region are often great. Most important, however, is that the culture of a people is affected by outside influences and by its own evolutionary process and is, therefore, con- stantly changing. The student must attempt to sound the temperamental depths of that which is permanent and lasting, beyond "morphological 3 Emilio Willems, "Portuguese Culture in Brazil," Atas do [I] ColUquio Interna- cional de Estudos Luso-Brasileiros (Nashville: Vanderbilt Univ.

Dan Stanislawski has shown that Minho and northern Portugal, by taking advantage of geographical realities, were able to turn away from the Castilian-dominated central meseta and devote their energies to the sea. Portuguese writers often wax lyrical in their descriptions of the role of the Atlantic in Portugal's development, and a sort of mystical Atlantic determinism has resulted. Even the noted Portuguese anthropologist Jorge Dias can not resist: "A cultura portugu6sa tem caricter essencialmente expansive, determinado em parte por uma situaao geogrifica que Ihe conferiu a missao de estreitar os lagos entre os continentes e os homens."7 Whatever the truth in this Atlantic determinism, however, the location of Portugal on the Atlantic did give it strategic, military, and economic advantages which influenced the course of Portugal's history and social development. The Portuguese have been called a mixture of dreamers and of men of action who do not lack a practical side to their nature.8 They can be extlemely pragmatic and adaptable when faced with a problem that calls for a practical solution. This plasticity and adaptability has been considered by some to be the basic key to the success of Portugal in creating a lasting civilization in Brazil.9 As an active dreamer, the Portu- guese, if given an ideal, is capable of great efforts through deteimined and persistent action involving self-denial, sacrifice, and courage. When, however, the task is mediocre and does not arouse his interest, he lacks initiative. The Portuguese "nio sabe viver sem sonho e sem gl6ria."10 It was the stimulation of his imagination and interest for the glory of conquest and battle, the lure of wealth, and the service of religion which 5A.

The heart is the measure of all things for the Portuguese and he is basically human, amorous, and affectionate.1l The pleasures of the Lusi- tanian tend to be organic rather than intellectual and the Portuguese have a robust humor that can lead them to "Breughel-like frolicking."12 Vio- lence and unnecessary suffering are avoided, as is the case in the Portu- guese-style bullfight, or tourada, in which the bull is not killed. If outraged or dishonored, however, the Portuguese is capable of extreme and sudden violence. As will be shown below, this is especially true when the chastity of the female members of his family is concerned or when his own per- sonal honor is at stake. The Portuguese has a strong belief in miracles and in the stroke of luck, as is evidenced by the popularity of the lottery in Portugal and as has been shown in the past by the cult of Sebastianism.13 This belief in miraculous solutions appears to have been inherited by the Brazilians, who have developed a "Deus 6 brasileiro" attitude toward their problems. This attitude has been reinforced, however, by Brazil's own peculiar history, especially in view of its economic cycles and boom- bust-boom experience. The Portuguese, like his Iberian relatives, is an individualist who places great emphasis on personal relationships. He avoids impersonal, secondary relations and prefers to act within the broad ties of the family, often rein- forcing these relations with the compadrio system. The "autarchy of the individual" and the emphasis on personality are constants of his nature which he will only renounce for a greater good. The result has often been either anarchy or extreme centralization tending toward dictatorship.14 An aspect of Portuguese character which the people of Portugal like to claim as theirs alone is that of saudade. Saudade is an untranslatable word which seems to be a combination of sentimentality, homesickness, and nostalgia. This saudade, this sadness of character, is a current which runs deeply throughout Portuguese literature. At times it can become fatalistic and even morbid. The soul-rending fado heard in Lisbon originated as an expression of the saudade of the Portuguese colonizer in Brazil for his homeland.l5 This longing for Europe, for the metropolis, which charac- terized many Portuguese in Brazil during the colonial period, has been viewed as one of the worst aspects of the Portuguese heritage of Brazil, Dias, "Os elementos ...," p. 58. 12William L.

The penchant of the Portuguese for display and ostentation has been noted by many writers. Though there might be little to eat at home, there was always an air of pomp and gentry. It was commonly a case of "por fora muita farofa, por dentro mulambo sd6.18 It seems, however, that this ostentation was not a matter of personal luxury and comfort but rather of imagination. Jorge Dias has noted that the Portuguese have the hardest beds in Europe, while the streets are filled with automobiles.'9 Poor people who lack the least comfort in their home appear in the street in elegant dress. A similar situation was noted in colonial Brazil and still exists today in rural areas, where women whose dress at home may be ragged appear at mass in finery to which all attention is given. This "Sunday best" is known in Brazil as traje domingueiro or roupa de ver-a- Deus.20 Gilberto Freyre, using Thorstein Veblen's term, has called this ostentation "conspicuous waste," and has noted that in the colonial period women who had so many jewels they could not wear them all at the same time often put them on the slaves who followed their mistresses to church.21 Coupled with the ostentation of the Portuguese has been his attitude toward work. There existed, during the period of conquest, a depreciation of manual labor. Peasants, although they labored hard, shared the fidalgo ideal with the nobility. This attitude was found among the Spaniards as well. The Iberian hoped to get rich quickly, perhaps to own land, but not to labor. Work was for the slave. In fact, in Portugal the verb "to work," trabalhar, was often replaced with mourejar, "to work like a Moor."22 Perhaps this attitude of antipathy to manual labor was due to the fact that work indicates the submission of the individual will to an external 16 Viana Moog, Bandeirantes and Pioneers (New York: George Braziller, 1964), p. 125. 17 Freyre, The Masters ..., p. 187. 18 Freyre, The Masters ..., p. 245. 19 Dias, "Os elementos... ," p. 58. 20 Ramos, p. 123. 2 Gilberto Freyre, "Some Aspects of the Social Development of Portuguese America," Concerning Latin American Culture, ed.

Schwartz 71</page><page sequence="6">force, and the Iberian with his emphasis on the individual could not condone this.25 The result in Brazil was a "bandeirante spirit" in which all energy was devoted to the quick profit. Even in agriculture the emphasis was on the large profit, and at times the Portuguese government had to legislate to force plantation owners to grow food crops. The result of this attitude was the development in Brazil of a "gentleman complex" which depreciated manual labor and emphasized non-functional education as a sign of breeding to be coupled with wealth.24 Even among the Brazilian lower classes the idea of the quick fortune is pervasive, and men in the Amazon often desert farming in hopes of a rapidly amassed fortune in rubber-hunting.25 In the mind of the Portuguese productive activity has had much less value than contemplation and love, and a dignified idleness always seemed more noble than the "insane struggle for the daily bread."26 The most important aspect of Portuguese character, or at least the most often discussed, is his adaptability. The Portuguese lacks the flame and orthodoxy of the Castilian; rather, he is a compromiser without im- mutable prejudices who has been able to adapt to climates, occupations, cultures, and races in an exceptional manner.27 The quality of flexibility and tolerance of other races led in Brazil to miscegenation of an unprece- dented extent. This miscegenation and the adaptation of the Portuguese to his new environment has been the basis on which Gilberto Freyre has advocated a new field of study, "Lusotropicalism," or the study of Portu- guese integration in the tropics.28 Much has been written on the capacity of the Portuguese people to mix with other races. As has been noted earlier, they are themselves a mixed race in which Semitic and Negro elements are important. Some writers, like Freyre, have attributed the race mixing in Brazil to Portugal's contact with the Moors, the concept of the moura encantada as the ideal and epitome of sex and beauty for the Portuguese being transferred to the darker-skinned Indians.29 This ideal, plus the social plasticity of the colonizer in which no firm racial lines were drawn, has often been cited as 23 Buarque de Holanda, p. 12. 2 Moog, p. 157. 2 See Charles Wagley, Amazon Town (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1964), espe- cially Ch. iii. 8 Buarque de Holanda, p. 13. 27 Dias, "Os elementos ...," p. 63. 28This concept has been advocated in many works by Freyre and during the Vargas period became something of a national policy, although Freyre himself was not a Vargas supporter. Brazilian nationalists have objected to this approach. For instance, see Jos6 Hon6rio Rodrigues, Africa e Brastl: Outro horizonte (Rio de Janeiro: Edit6ra Civilizaao Brasileira S. A., 1961). 2 Gilberto Freyre, New World in the Tropics (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1959), p. 55. 72 Luso-Brazilian Review</page><page sequence="7">the prime reason for the success of miscegenation in Brazil.80 It has been pointed out, however, that the scarcity of women may have had much to do with the extent of racial mixing, and in instances of colonization in Brazil in which the colonist was accompanied by his wife, as in Santa Catarina, much less miscegenation took place. Slavery, of course, played a role in the process of race mixture in Brazil. Whatever the cause, miscegenation did take place in Brazil. Slavery was certainly a cause, but slavery, says Freyre, was inevitable. The result of lasting importance was the creation of a psychological and cultural unity of the Brazilian people.l8 An author less convinced of the benefits of race mixture, especially through illegal unions, has noted the charac- teristics of the mestifos or mulatos as, "emotional imbalance, inner discord, insecurity, instability, resentment, marginalism, laziness, melancholy," and a constant search for a father-image.32 Thus far, the characteristics of the Portuguese people and the effect of these on the development of the Brazilian character have been outlined. Perhaps it would be most advantageous at this point to examine in depth one aspect of the social system of Brazil which shows clear dependence on Lusitanian antecedents. The work of Emilio Willems, to whom all students of this topic are indebted, is especially useful. Willems, through examination of both Brazilian and Portuguese family structure, has not only indicated parallels between the two, but has also re-evaluated some of the time-worn generalizations. The family in Brazil has been considered the most important institu- tion in the history of the nation and has played a dominant role in the course of Brazil's history.88 The Bra7ilian colonial family has often been thought of as that patriarchal institution depicted in the works of Gilberto Freyre which describe the sugar region of the Northeast. The colonial family seen as patriarchal, extended, multifunctional, and of "towering dominance" has been questioned to some extent, since in Brazil variation between groups in the social strata is enormous.84 The ecological and economic conditions in Brazil did play a part in the continuance of the extended family, as did the weakness of the colonial government, but Willems, although admitting the possibility of parallel development, sees the basis of the Brazilian family system in Portuguese antecedents.8 30 Freyre, The Masters ..., p. 185. 31 Freyre, O Mundo ...,pp. 46-48. 3 Moog, p. 157. 33Charles Wagley, An Introductin to Brazil (New York: Columbia Univ.

Schwartz 73</page><page sequence="8">And, even if the Brazilian family developed autonomously, its values were reinforced by Portuguese immigrants accustomed to extended family ties and espirito de cla.36 The prescribed roles of men and women in both the Brazilian and the Portuguese family are based on the virility/virginity complexes. The woman is expected to lead a secluded life, never appearing in public unless properly accompanied. Freyre has laid this tradition to Moorish antecedents.37 After marriage the woman is expected to be mother and housekeeper, not a companion to her husband. Virginity is a primary requisite before marriage, and should the bride be found lacking in this respect the groom has proper grounds for annulment of the marriage. Any extra-marital relations on the part of the woman are considered grounds for separation. It is common, however, for a husband to kill both the unfaithful wife and her lover and then claim temporary insanity. This is expected and accepted community behavior.38 In contrast to the female role in the upper-class Brazilian family is the virility complex of the male, which encourages sexual contact at an early age, ridicules male chastity, and considers extra-marital sexual relations permissible. Within the home, however, the male is expected to act as guardian and protector.39 The males of the family are also expected to be avengers of the family's honor, especially that of its female members. This attitude in Brazil has been reinforced by immigration from Portugal, Spain, and southern Italy. Thus far, the above description can be applied to both Brazilian and Portuguese upper-class families. The lower-class Brazilian family places much less emphasis on the virginity/virility complex. Marriage is far less stable, and extended kin- ship groups are not viewed as of great importance. These facts tend to substantiate Willems' thesis that the patriarchal, extended family lessens in importance as one descends the social scale.40 A similar situation might be expected in Portugal, but such is not the case. The Portuguese lower- class rural families are based on property, which acts as an adhesive force, holding the family together and reinforcing traditional attitudes.41 The Brazilian rural families, on the other hand, are usually agregados, colonos, or parceiros and lack, therefore, the centripetal force which land- owning provides. The rural Brazilian family is weak, for it can offer little, and its children tend to leave the paternal home to seek better-paying 36 Willems, "Portuguese Culture ... ," p. 68. 37 Freyre, The Masters .. ., p. 223. 38 A good literary example of this may be found in Jorge Amado, Gabriela: Clove and Cinnamon (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1962). 9 Willems, "The Structure . . ," p. 342. 40 Willems, "The Structure ... ," p. 346. 41 Emilio Willems, "A Familia Portuguesa Contemporanea," Sociologia, XVII, No. 1, 1955, p. 47. 74 Luso-Brazilian Review</page><page sequence="9">jobs.42 It is significant to note that the Brazilian-type rural family is to be found in Alentejo among migratory workers. Here is a case of economic conditions affecting traditional patterns. Another difference between lower-class Brazilian and Portuguese rural families derives from the tendency of the Portuguese to live in villages or small communities, which act as factors of control and stabilization through community pressure. The more dispersed nature of many of Brazil's rural families means a lessening of community pressure and more individuality and plasticity in family structure.43 Willems in his studies has shown that the original Portuguese family structure did not remain unchanged in Brazil but was altered to meet ecological, human, and economic conditions, and due to these new changes new structural organizations developed. The patriarchal family usually attributed in its origins to Portugal must undergo some review, since it has been discovered that in some regions the patriarchal family is not as dominant an institution as had been thought. Paul Descamp in his Le Portugal: la vie sociale actuelle indicates that in some regions of Portugal the place of the woman in the family is not as secondary as had been supposed. In Beira and Minho personal names often show matrilineal tendencies. Names such as Joao de Maria "Mary's John," are often found, especially in common-law marriages.4 In parts of the Algarve, the women are the members of the family who take an active part in community life. In Brazil, similar developments can be noted which seem to be exceptions to the patriarchal generalization. Women in Sao Paulo of land-holding but not of planter-class families often raise their own produce and sell it, keeping the profits themselves. Occa- sionally, these women engage in speculative loans. These economic activities indicate a degree of independence not usually associated with the Brazilian woman.46 In both Portugal and Brazil the role of the patriarchal family must be studied further, for it would seem that important exceptions to it do exist. For the social historian, a most important feature of the Brazilian family structure has been its extended organization through the parentela group which has played an important role in the political and economic life of Brazil. The development of rival parentelas struggling for power is not an autochthonous feature in Brazil, but has roots in the Lusitanian past: "Wherever the economic system was characterized by latifundia the upper class families became extended and strongly patriarchal structures 42 Willems, "A Famlia ... ," p. 47. 4 Willems, "A Famlia ... ," p. 48. Also in this connection see Wagley, Amazon Town, for a discussion of the families of outlying areas. "Willems, "Portuguese Culture ... ," p. 69. '5 Willems, "Portuguese Culture . . ," p. 69. "p.6. Stuart B. Schwartz 75</page><page sequence="10">which controlled local government frequently in rivalry with other kin groups. In some parts of Portugal the political power of these families was broken only in the late nineteenth century."46 In Alentejo local families "disputed" power and the local saying was, "quem nao estd na Cdmara, estd na Miseric6rdia."47 A similar situation existed in Tr{s-os-Montes until quite recently. Basically, however, the struggle for power between the State and the family in Portugal has been won by the former. The parentela as a political organ in Brazil, on the other hand, although con- siderably weakened, has adapted itself to new conditions and continues to play an important role in public and private life.48 The Portuguese social system based on primary rather than impersonal or categorical relationships, and in which a high value is placed on blood relations and compadrio ties, can be seen as a point of origin from which the Brazilian family system developed. As has been shown, there are significant class variations from the patriarchal stereotype, and changes in the family structure have taken place in both Portugal and Brazil. This heritage may be viewed as an intimate and satisfying basis for social relationships, or it may be considered a bane encouraging backroom politics and nepotism. Whatever the evaluation may be, it seems that the present Brazilian family structure is an enduring legacy from the Lusi- tanian past.49 It is in the everyday life of the Brazilian, especially the rural Brazilian, that the Portuguese heritage is to be seen. The language of Brazil is Portuguese and the style of life of the Brazilian reflects the Portuguese heritage in a hundred ways. For example, the mutirao, or mutual work party, although found among Africans and Indians, can be seen in Alentejo, Beira, and Minho. The festivities in Brazil following a mutirao are found only in Portuguese origins. Here is but one more example of the duration of the Lusitanian element in Brazil.50 The aspect of the Portuguese heritage of Brazil which is most apparent in everyday life and is probably easiest to study is that of the popular folk traditions of Brazilian society. Certainly, the administrative actions of the metropolis during the colonial period played an important role in the for- mation of Brazilian society just as the Church did in conjunction with the Jesuit Order. But it is the popular rather than the official traditions to which I am referring. Renato Almeida, the Brazilian folklorist, has stated: "e pelo estudos dos nossos folguedos, romances, contos e hist6rias que Willems, "The Structure ... ," p. 345. 7 Willems, "A Familia .. .

The extent to which the Brazilian accepts the Iberian nature of his culture depends somewhat on his idea of Brazil's history, and views on this question differ. S6rgio Buarque de Holanda in his Raizes do Brasil noted that the Portuguese tradition gave Brazilian culture its form, while the other elements were plastic material to be molded to this form for better or for worse.52 On the other hand, the nationalist Jos6 Hon6rio Rodrigues has spoken of a Portuguese thesis, an antithesis of environment, Indians, and Negroes, and a resulting synthesis of a combination producing something new and dif- ferent.53 The conflict rages, but the Portuguese element is undeniably present. Folk tales and folk songs, as well as louvores populares to the Virgin, can serve as a basis for tracing the transmission of Portuguese popular cultural elements to Brazil, especially since much work has been done on both sides of the Atlantic in collecting these songs and stories." Th6o Brandao in his Trovas Populares de Alagoas noted the adaptation of Portuguese trovas to Brazilian conditions with modifications due to envi- ronment, local expressions, and structural changes. Another folklorist collected these two verses, the latter obviously a derivative of the former: O meu padre Santo Ant6nio E Santo de Portugal; Livra a gente do dem6nio, E remedio contra o mal (Portugal) Santo Ant6nio 6 grande Santo Do Brasil e Portugal Livrai-nos, 6 Santo Ant6nio Das tentao6es e do mal (Cear&amp;)55 51 Jayme Lopes Dias, "A Festa do Divino como elemento da irea cultural comum Luso-Brasileira," Estudos e Ensaios Folcl6ricos em Homenagem a Renato Almeida (Rio de Janeiro: Minist6rio das Relag6es Exteriores, 195?), p. 423. 52 Buarque de Holanda, p. 15. 58 Jos6 Hon6rio Rodrigues, Aspiraf6es Nacionais (Sao Paulo: Edit6ra Fulgor, 1963), p. 41.

Stuart B. Schwartz 77</page><page sequence="12">Also, it seems that the custom of the desafio, the improvisation of verses by two contending balladeers so clearly explained by Euclides da Cunha in Os Sertoes, is a Lusitanian custom. The cantaria ao desafio has been reported among Portuguese (Azoreans) in California.56 From infancy, the Brazilian child is exposed to the Portuguese heritage of his nation. The Brazilian's first games and playthings and even the bogey-men used to frighten him are of Lusitanian origin. The Papao and the Cuca, two such mythical creatures, can be traced directly to Portugal. For instance, compare the first verse found in Portugal with the second collected in Minas Gerais: Vai-te papao, vai-te embora De cima desse telhado, Deixa dormir o menino Um soninho descansado (Portugal) Vai-te cuca, sai daqui Para cima do telhado; Deixa dormir o menino O seu sono sossegado (Minas Gerais)57 Even the lobisomem, or werewolves, do not stem from any Indian forest spirit but are to be found in Portuguese folk traditions. The extent to which the Lusitanian folk tradition is dominant in Brazil varies greatly within the diverse cultural regions of the nation. The influence of other cultural elements dilutes the strength of Portuguese cultural tradition while enriching it at the same time. Aside from the obvious cultural differences of non-Portuguese immigrants, other tradi- tions continue to exist, but usually within the basic Portuguese framework. For example, in Rio Grande do Sul the Hispanic influences of the La Plata area are strong, while in the Amazon the economic and cultural patterns show heavy Indian influence. In other areas, particularly the old sugar- producing regions of Bahia and Pernambuco, the cultural heritage of the Negro is evident. Brazilian culture is not Portuguese culture transplanted, but without this element it would be much different than it is. Certainly, one of the most enduring aspects of Portuguese cultural heritage in Brazil is that of Catholicism: that special brand of Catholicism characteristic of Portugal. The agony-torn Christs of Spain and the soaring Gothic Spanish cathedrals are lacking in Portuguese Catholicism, which 56 Anna H. Gayton, "Luso-Californian culture and its research needs," Atas do [I] Coldquio Internacional de Estudos Luso-Brasileiros (Nashville: Vanderbilt Univ. Press, 1953), p. 84. I have observed this custom also among Portuguese-Americans in Ludlow, Mass. 57 Bettencourt, p. 411. 78 Luso-Brazilian Review</page><page sequence="13">was and is a humanistic form of Christianity with anthropomorphic ten- dencies, often giving special importance to saints associated with love and agricultural fertility.58 It was the body of Catholic thought which had been softened by long contact with the Moors but which had left a place for saints of the Reconquest. This last aspect can be seen in Brazil in the existence of Sebastianism mixed with other elements in the messianic movements of the Northeast. Religion in Portugal and then in Brazil served a social as well as a spiritual function. The parallelism and the cultural borrowing of Brazilian Catholicism from its Portuguese antecedents is extensive. The importance of shrines, pilgrimages, and the ceremony of the blessing, all so important in Brazilian Catholicism, stem from the Catholic traditions of Portugal.59 In both countries the June cycle of the three major saints-St. Anthony, St. John, and St. Peter-is a high point of the religious calendar, even though in Brazil June is a winter not a summer month as it is in Portugal. In Brazil and Portugal St. Anthony is a santo pdndego or santo folido, a patron of revelry, a forgiver of human weakness, and a noted matchmaker to whom ribald songs are often sung.60 Also, saints' images are often treated like human beings and are punished or rewarded as their case may merit. It has been noted that Portuguese seamen who have prayed for a favorable wind and fail to receive it lash the saint's effigy to the mast and flog it. In Brazil a non-compliant saint's image may be put uncomfortably near a fire or even pounded to dust in a mortar.61 This list of particularly Lusitanian features of Brazilian religion, espe- cially in its folk manifestations, could be extended to great lengths. The impact of the Portuguese form of Catholicism on Brazilian religious and social life is undeniable. It must be remembered, however, that contact of Portugal with Brazil was a historical process extending over at least three centuries, and that the element of change is a part of this process. It is interesting to note, therefore, Lusitanian elements of Brazilian religion which since the time of their transplantation have fallen into disuse in Portugal or have changed in function in Brazil. For example, the feast of the Holy Ghost has an importance in Brazil which is "comparable only to 58 Freyre, The Masters ..., p. 258.

I wish to note that Father Manuel Rocha, Director of the Lusitania Institute of Ludlow, Mass., who has had over twenty years of experience in dealing with Portuguese workers from Minho to the Algarve, has never seen these practices. This is probably a case of the disappearance of a custom in its place of origin while it continues elsewhere as a transplant. Stuart B.

The mouriscadas are no longer commonly practiced in Portugal.64 To conclude, this paper has presented merely a few of the facets of Portuguese culture which have formed a part of Brazilian life and in many ways continue to do so. Whether such a thing as a Luso-Brazilian community does exist is a matter for Brazilians to decide, but the Lusi- tanian heritage of Brazil is a fact. The investigation of this inheritance is a suitable field for further study and would be most rewarding for both an understanding of Brazil's past as well as a knowledge of its present. To continue the analogy made at the beginning of this paper, the third menina deserves to be courted, for she comes from a fine old family which has left her a rich inheritance. 62 Willems, "Portuguese Culture . ," p. 75. 63 Wilems, "Portuguese Culture ... ," p. 76. 64 Willems, "Portuguese Culture . .. ," p. 76. 80 Luso-Brazilian Review</page></plain_text>
