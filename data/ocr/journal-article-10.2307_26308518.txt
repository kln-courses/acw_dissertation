<plain_text><page sequence="1">ACTING THE SHE-BEAR FOR ARTEMIS PAULA PERLMAN At Brauron Athenian girls called άρκτοι (bears) celebrated their coming-of-age by "acting the she-bear" for Artemis. At Cyrene new brides and women about to deliver were required to go to the sanc tuary of Artemis Καταγωγίς and there offer sacrifice to the goddess. The sacrificial emoluments — hide, head, and legs — went to the priestess of Artemis who was called by the title Άρκος or bear.1 En route to Methydrion from Megalopolis Pausanias (8.35.8) noted the tumulus and tomb of Kallisto, companion of Artemis, mistress of Zeus, and mother of Arkas. Kallisto's affair with Zeus proved to be costly for her. She was punished; the ancient traditions varying as to the identity of the divine instrument and the nature of the penalty. Several versions of the legend include her transformation into a bear. Discussions of the significance of the bear in the cults and myths of Artemis have focused upon the goddess as Agrotera and Potnia Theron, goddess of the wilderness and mistress of wild animals. Her attachment to the untamed countryside, her passion for the hunt, and her concern for the young of her quarry have been understood to explain the bears of Brauron, the bear priestess of Artemis at Cyrene, and Kallisto the bear. Some scholars go further and suggest that the prevalence of the she-bear in the cults and myths of Artemis indicates For the form άρκος (= δρκτος) see Chantraine 1968.110. Ill</page><page sequence="2">112 Paula Perlman that Artemis was once a bear goddess; the identification again ex plained by her fundamental attachment to wilderness and wild ani mals.2 But this approach fails to elucidate why the she-bear makes her appearance in those rituals and myths of Artemis which concern human childbirth and motherhood. Granted that Artemis was a goddess of the wilderness and of wild animals, why was the she-bear thought to be an appropriate adjunct to Artemis Kourotrophos, the patron goddess of children and childbearing? This question provides the focus for my inquiry. It has long been noted that the habits of animals can help to explain their religious significance. The interpretation of the snake in Bronze Age and later religion provides the best known exemplum of this approach to the study of ιερά ζφα. The subterranean abode of the snake and its Deriodic skin sheddine no doubt contributed to its association with the chthonic deities whose spheres of influence in cluded the regeneration of all life, both plant and animal. What the Greeks knew (or thought they knew) about the natural history of the bear and what most interested them about the bear's life-cycle should be of interest to our inquiry.3 Both Aristotle and Theophrastus4 discussed bears in their biological treatises. The following "life-cycle of the bear" is drawn from Aristotle's Historia Animalium and De Generatione Animalium,5 Bears mate in the month of Elaphebolion and the she-bear de livers some thirty days later at about the time they go into hibernation.6 New-born bears are the smallest young in comparison to the size of Cf. Bodson 1978.142-144, who points out that the ancient evidence does not sug gest a theriomorphic (bear) goddess Artemis. See Bodson 1978.121-144. Arena 1979.5-26 appeals to certain aspects of the natural history of the bear without fully exploring what the Greeks knew about bears or the implications of this knowledge for the cults of Artemis. We know that Theophrastus wrote about the life-cycle of bears from Pliny NH 8. 54.129. The principle passages are Aristotle HA 579a 18-38 and 600a28-b9. Aristotle men tions bears at HA 539b33-540a3 (bears mate by lying down and embracing); 57 lb27 31 (fierceness of the she-bear after cubbing); 594b 15-16 (bears walk upright); 608a 33-35 (bravery of the she-bear); 611b32-612al (tactics when pursued); GA 774b5-16 (why she-bears deliver incomplete [άτελή] offspring). There is evidently a problem with the text of Aristot. HA 579a25, for Elaphebolion is a spring month. Camus 1783 and Wimmer 1866 substituted Posideon (Camus)</page><page sequence="3">Acting The She-Bear For Artemis 113 the mother. They are somewhat larger than a mouse, but smaller than a weasel. At birth, cubs are hairless, blind, and unarticulated (ά διάρθρωτα). The mother bear licks her cubs into shape (quite literally). The she-bear hibernates until it is time to lead out her cubs. This is in the spring, in the third month after the winter solstice. She-bears are unusually fierce both before and after cubbing. In fact, bears, like leopards, are somewhat unusual in that the females of the species are as brave as the males. While it is difficult to catch a pregnant bear, bears with cubs are particularly clever in flight. When chased, she bears push their cubs before them and then turn upon their pursuers. Bears can walk upright like man. If overtaken the she-bear will climb a tree, carrying her cubs on her back or in her mouth. Later authors for the most part agreed with Aristotle's de scription.7 Pliny clarified one detail which Aristotle put somewhat inexactly: the she-bear goes into hibernation and then delivers her cubs.8 Oppian explained why cubs are born before they are fully formed: she-bears are a lecherous race, eager to mate, and so they do violence to the divine midwife, Eileithyia, and deliver their cubs pre maturely in order that they might mate again; for the she-bear abhors and Hekatombaion (Wimmer) for Elaphebolion. Dittmeyer 1907, following Petavius, preferred to emend the text to read του &lt; Ποσειδεώνος καν φωλεύει μέχρι του μηνός τοΰ&gt; Έλαφηβολιώνος. Both passages where Aristotle discusses the hiber nation of the bear (HA 579a28-30 and 600b2-3) agree that the she-bear emerges from her lair with her cubs in the third month after the winter solstice (roughly late March to early April), the equivalent of Attic Elaphebolion or Mounichion. Pliny NH 8.54. 126 and 129, Aelian NA 6.3 and Oppian Cynegeticus 3.170-175 agree that bears go into hibernation at the onset of winter and emerge from hibernation in the spring. Both Pliny and Aelian provide two different hibernation cycles for bears. Pliny NH 8.54.126 suggests that male bears hibernate for forty days while females hibernate for four months. Aelian NA 6.3 states that bears hibernate for a full three months and for a period of forty days, without attempting to reconcile the two. Clearly the hiber nation cycle of forty days found in Pliny and Aelian derives from Aristotle's state ment that the shortest hibernation cycle of the bear is forty days. Aelian, NA 6.3 refers to Aristotle (HA 600b2). In essential agreement are Pliny NH 8.54.126-131; Oppian Cynegeticus 3.139-175; Aelian NA 2.19; 6.3, 9; and Plut. Mor. 494c. Pliny NH 8.54.126.</page><page sequence="4">114 Paula Perlman to have her bed widowed.9 Aristotle's successors extended his com parison of bears to man. Where Aristotle noted that bears walk up right like man and couple by lying down and embracing, Oppian compared the paws of a bear to human hands and feet.10 Finally, Oppian, Pliny, and Aelian concurred in the belief that bears nourish themselves while hibernating by sucking on their forepaws." This last detail, which Aristotle omits, seems to be a very ancient and wide spread bit of bear lore.12 It is without biological foundation, as is the notion expressed by Aristotle and his successors that bear cubs are undeveloped and formless at birth. Several features of this ancient Greek "life-cycle of the bear" are of particular interest to our inquiry: (1) Hibernation is discussed in terms of the she-bear's pregnancy: bears mate one month before they go into hibernation; the she-bear delivers shortly after she has gone into hibernation; and she comes out only when the cubs are ready (in the third month after the winter solstice). (2) She-bears are unusually fierce both before and after delivery. They use clever strategems to protect their cubs.13 (3) Bears look and act like humans. Their paws may be compared to human hands and feet, they walk upright, and they mate lying down. From at least the fourth century B.C. scholarly interest in bears fo cused upon conception, hibernation, birth, and motherhood. Oppian Cynegeticus 3.146-169. Cf. Aristot. GN 774b5-16 (because flssipeds usually produce multiple offspring, the mother is unable to nourish them to perfection in utero and so she expels them before they are fully formed).

See Hallowell 1926.27-31. Hallowell noted that there seems to be a rough correlation between this bit of folklore and the occurrence of bear ceremonialism. He suggested that paw-sucking is an ancient notion which is associated with other customs connected with bears in both the Old World and the New. Aelian NA 6.9 introduces his discussion of how the she-bear protects her cubs when pursued with: σοφά δε άρκτου ήν άρα έκεϊνα.</page><page sequence="5">Acting The She-Bear For Artemis 115 The question remains whether Aristotle's inquiries into the natural history of the bear established this interest in the reproductive cycle of the she-bear, or whether the image of the bear as mother was already traditional by the fourth century B.C. That brown bears (Ursus Syriacus) were available for autoscopy in mainland Greece during the Classical Period seems likely, although our evidence for the presence of bears in Greece belongs to the prehistoric and Roman periods.14 Bear bones have been found at Lerna V (the Middle Helladic Period)15 αnrl Kpor nliqlanftpc qnnarpntlv frnm a Kpor-elrin ntron tuarp fnnn/4 it-i an eleventh century funerary vase from Athens which contained the cremated remains of a teenage boy and a teenage girl.16 A first century B.C. funerary epigram from Thyrrheion in Akarnania tells the sad tale of a twenty-seven year old woman who was mauled to death by a hateful bear (αρκου υπό στυγερός όλέσας βίον).17 Pausanias main tained that Mt. Parnes in Attica and Mt. Taygetos in Arkadia provided bear for hunters and that he himself had witnessed the holocaust sacrifice of a bear to Artemis Laphria at Patrai.18 Thus, Aristotle could perhaps have gathered his information about bears from first hand observation or from reports by local hunters and need not have relied upon an earlier tradition.19 Even so, archaeological evidence suggests that the image of the bear as mother had already been established in the region millennia 14 For a discussion of the brown bear in antiquity see Buchholz 1974-1975.175-185 and Bodson 1978.129-144. Bears appear in art throughout the Classical and Hel lenistic periods.

A Neolithic figurine from Yugoslavia depicts a bear (or bear-masked) mother tenderly embracing a cub.20 Closer to our inquiry, both geographically and chronologically, is the cave, known today as Bear Cave (σπηλιά αρκούδα), which is located on Akrotiri peninsula in northwestern Crete.21 A cult was established in the cave in LM III. Worship seems to have focused upon a large stalagmite whose shape has been variously interpreted as that of a dog or a bear. Faure identified Bear Cave with the cave called Άρκέσιον where the Idaian nymph Kynosoura was said to have suckled the infant λ u., du~:„ 22 τ 1-11— -—'» if »»·■ ι·ν&lt;»·»ί%»νιινν» J *"" HlVVilV» J X AV11V111ÛV1V authors explained how Kynosoura was later catasterized to form the constellation Ursa Minor.23 That a tradition associating the infant Zeus and bear nurses was already known in the sixth century B.C. is suggested by Porphyrius' statement that Pythagoras called she-bears "the hands of Rheia."24 Faure suggested that the Kynosoura legend belonged to the Kydonians of Akrotiri peninsula and that it reflects the presence of a bear kourotrophos goddess and cult in Bear Cave. The exact nature of the cult during the Bronze and Dark Ages is uncertain, but the cult does seem to have belonged to a kourotrophos goddess from the fifth century B.C.25 It may well be, then, that Aristotle's description 1 Gimbutas 1974.268.

They suggest that the material remains (terracotta plaques in the severe style with Artemis Agrotera and Apollo Kitharoidos and a kotyle inscribed ΝΥΝΦΑΝ) indicate that the cult was dedicated to Artemis and the Nymphs. Today, the cave is dedicated to the Virgin (Παναγία Άρκουδιώτισσα) and to the festival of her purification ('Υπαπαντή τής Θεοτόκου) on February 2.</page><page sequence="7">Acting The She-Bear For Artemis 117 of the bear, his choice of subject and his range of interest, reflected an early tradition which emphasized the she-bear as mother. Oppian's explanation of why she-bears delivered their cubs before they were fully formed — that is, ursine venery — may reflect ancient tradition as well, albeit ancient tradition colored by Oppian's tendency to moralize. Aristotle, in his Constitution oflthaka, recounted what must be a local legend of the northwest Greeks concerning Kephalos, the great-grandfather of Odysseus and the eponym of the island of Kephallenia.26 Kephalos was childless and sought the advice of an oracle. He was told to mate with the first female he encountered. Upon his return to Kephallenia he met with a she-bear, and in strict adherence to the oracle he mated with her. The she-bear turned into a human woman and bore a son, Arkeisios. This myth is clearly an inversion of the Kallisto legend — here a bear, transformed into a human, gives birth to a son, Arkeisios, while in the Kallisto myth a human, transformed into a bear, gives birth to a son, Arkas. In both myths the bear symbolizes female sexuality and procreative powers.27 Philademos, the first century B.C. epigrammatist, offers a contrasting image of the bear. In one of his epigrams from the Anthology he compares two women; characterizing one as a thirsty harlot (a διψάς πόρνη) and the other as a shy maiden (a φωλάς παρθενική).28 In both cases he selected a term which properly belongs to the animal kingdom to describe the character of the women: διψάς the poisonous snake whose venomous bite causes its victim to suffer intense thirst; and φωλάς the bear in hibernation.29 We cannot prove that this image of the bear as a shy and retiring maiden was of very great antiquity, 26 Aristot. Frg. 504 (Rose). 27 Cf. the story of Polyphante of Thrace. Like Hippolytus she abhorred the arts of Aphrodite, preferring instead to hunt in the company of Artemis. Aphrodite drove her mad and caused her to fall in love with a bear. The rest of the story follows the pattern of the Kallisto myth (Artemis discovers the pregnancy of Polyphante and drives her away). This story is known only from Antoninus Liberalis (21.1-3) who quotes from book two of the Ornithogony of Boios. 28 Philod. AP 11.34. 29 For φωλάς used of the bear in hibernation see Theok. 1.115; Hymn. Is. 46.</page><page sequence="8">118 Paula Perlman but we shall see that the two images of maiden and mother and the locus of the bear's transformation from one state to the other, namely the cave, provide a powerful analogue for cults of Artemis such as that at Brauron and perhaps at Cyrene as well.30 Brauron, a rural sanctuary on the east coast of Attica, pro vided the setting for perhaps the best-known and certainly the most intriguing of partnerships between Artemis and the she-bear. Papa demetriou undertook the excavation of this sanctuary in 1948.31 Be fore then, literary references to what must have been the major festival for Artemis at Brauron provided some idea of what the celebration entailed and enabled scholars to identify the festival as a rite de passage and coming-of-age ceremony for Athenian girls.32 Chief among these literary testimonia is Aristophanes Lysis trata, line 645. Here the chorus of Athenian women explain their patriotism as quid pro quo: in their youth, Athens had bestowed upon them a number of honors including the opportunity to don the kro koton, a saffron-colored garment, and so dressed to serve as bears at the Brauronia. The bears, or άρκτοι, were Athenian maidens between the ages of ten and fifteen.33 The scholia maintained that to serve as an άρκτος was to "act the she-bear (άρκτεύειν) or "imitate the she-bear" (μιμήσασθαι την άρκτον).34 According to the scholia "acting the she bear" involved a telete, or mystery rite,35 and a goat sacrifice36 in 30 Arena 1979.18-22 quotes both passages and notes the contrasting imagery of the bear as lascivious and as shy and retiring, but he does not discuss the implications of this observation in the terms suggested in this paper. 31 The results of the excavations at Brauron have not been published in final form. One is forced to turn to the annual site reports. The most extensive reports follow, but others appeared from time to time in ALA and AD between 1948 and 1963. J.

The service was to be accomplished in anticipation of the maiden bear's marriage.37 The scholia preserve the foundation legend for the festival: A she-bear comes to Brauron and is tamed. One day, the bear injures a maiden playmate. The maiden's brothers be come incensed and kill the bear. A plague falls upon Athens. The Delphic oracle is consulted and Apollo replies that Athenian maidens henceforth must "act the she-bear." And so they do.38 We may now add one detail drawn trom the archaeological discoveries at Brauron to the picture of the festival which has been developed from the literary sources. In the course of his excavations, Papademetriou recovered fragments belonging to hundreds of crudely made miniature black figure kraters. They date to the late sixth and early fifth centuries B.C. and are decorated with scenes of girls who are either running foot-races or performing stately, rhythmic dances. Kahil has demonstrated that the kraters were most likely used by the άρκτοι during the festival, although their exact use cannot be deter mined, and that the girls who run and dance should be identified as the άρκτοι themselves.39 Thus, we may add foot-races and dances to the activities included under the rubric "acting the she-bear." Since Kahil first published the kraters and drew attention to their significance in 1963, discussions of the festival frequently sug gest that the phrase "acting the she-bear" refers to bear dances which For the ancient testimonia see Perlman 1983.114, n. 6. For a discussion of the aitia for the festival see Sale 1975.265-284. Aelian (NA 4.45) relates a story about a tame bear which is intriguingly similar to the Brauronian aitia. A hunter captured and raised a bear cub, a puppy, and a lion cub. The three were friends and played together. One day, while the dog and the bear were playing to gether, the dog teased the bear who, responding with unusual savageness, killed its former playmate. The lion avenged the death of the dog and killed the bear. Aelian attributed the story to Eudemos. One wonders whether stories about tame bears might not have originated from the practice of raising bear cubs orphaned by hunters.

Fragments from similar miniature kraters have also been found in the vicinity of the sanctuaries of Artemis at Mounichia (Kahil 1965.23-24; 1977.87), Halai Ara phenides (modern Loutsa) (Kahil 1977.88), the Athenian Acropolis (Kahil 1981. 253-263), Artemis Aristoboule at Melite (Kahil 1965.24), at the grotto of Pan and the Nymphs at Eleusis (Kahil 1965.23), and in the Athenian agora (Kahil 1965.23).</page><page sequence="10">120 Paula Perlman were performed by the άρκτοι in honor of Artemis, the bear goddess. The saffron-colored garment mentioned by Aristophanes' chorus represented a bear pelt and was worn by the άρκτοι as a bear costume or disguise. The term which the scholia used to describe the nature of the celebrants' behavior throughout the festival is thus limited to a specific element of ritual behavior: the dance.40 Bodson, who pointed out that the frequent suggestion of bear dancers clad in bear costumes (the krokotori) is without archaeological or literary foundation, suggested that the term "act the she-bear" should be understood in terms of a situational analogy.41 Both the bear and Artemis are at one and the same time savage and nurturing, and just as the bear licks her cubs into shape so Artemis, savage god dess of the wilderness, (tenderly) presides over the development of the young arktoi as they accomplish the transition from parthenos to gyne.42 Several authors have emphasized the antithesis wild vs. tame in their interpretations of the cult and its aitia.

UCLVYV-vii muu uiiu uvuot, luiuv and wild, culture and nature, and as such provided a suitable model for girls who were at the point of transition from maiden/parthenos (wild) and mother/gyne (tame).43 Cole agreed that by imitating the she-bear the maiden arktoi "participate ritually in the wildness of the animal" and that such conduct can be understood as an inversion ritual appropriate to the transformation stage of rites de passage.44 Some scholars go further and suggest that the άρκτοι imitated a specific bear, namely the bear of the foundation legend who was killed by an act of male aggression and whose death required propi 40 For the most recent formulation see Osborne 1985.169. 41 Bodson 1978.142-144. 42 Bevan 1987.19-21 similarly focuses upon the ancient belief that she-bears were good mothers who licked their cubs into shape to explain the connection between Artemis and bears. 43 Osborne 1985.165-167. Osborne regards Aristotle's comments concerning the bear as mother as but one among many human characteristics which Aristotle et al. at tributed to the bear. But Aristotle's interest in the bear as mother and in the con nection between hibernation and parturition are of central importance to his dis cussion. For a structuralist interpretation of the festival similar to that of Osborne's which emphasizes the categories of wild and tame see King 1983.111; 1985.180-186. 44 Cole 1984.241-242.</page><page sequence="11">Acting The She-Bear For Artemis 121 tiation.45 The άρκτοι, who were destined to foresake the virgin god dess of the wilderness, were required to imitate the she-bear who was killed as penance to the goddess for their imminent betrayal of her. To act the she-bear, then, was to propitiate both Artemis, mistress of wild animals, and Artemis the virgin goddess. It was incumbent upon the maidens to mollify the goddess, for their future as mothers depended upon the protection of Artemis Kourotrophos, patron goddess of childbirth. While the scholia and the lexicographers do suggest that to with a narrow interpretation of exactly how the άρκτοι imitated the she-bear. One difficulty has already been noted: the scholia do not limit their application of the term to one or another aspect of the fes tival. Furthermore, xanthos, and not krokotos, is the term used to describe the yellow, red, or brown coats of animals. Krokotos, on the other hand, has hymeneal associations.47 The saffron-colored dress of the άρκτοι more likely reflects their change of status from child to marriageable adult than their identification as bears. While the evidence thus far adduced fails to explain how the άρκτοι imitated or acted the she-bear and why such ritual behavior was appropriate for a girl's coming-of-age festival, our earlier dis cussion of bears may prove to be more instructive. Let us review briefly the observations noted above: 45 See for example Lloyd-Jones 1983.97, "The appearance of the bear, of all creatures, in this connection is of great interest; for no animal figures more prominently in the earliest material used by Meuli to support his theory of the origins of sacrifice as an attempt by hunters to assuage the guilt they felt for the killing of their animal victims"; Burkert 1985.151, "The maiden as vicarious victim for the animal to be killed — presented in mythology as the bride of the bear or buffalo — is a very wide spread motif in hunting cultures;" and Cole 1984.241. Attempts to associate this festival with hunting and sacrificial ritual are, I believe, misguided. It may well be that the status of the bear as the victim of the hunt has obscured the significance of the she-bear as a symbol for procreation and motherhood. King 1983.118 points out that the narrative pattern of the Brauronian aitia (error, disease/famine, equilibrium restored through the advice of Delphi) is a pattern common to many myths of Artemis.

(2) Hibernation, perhaps the most interesting aspect of the bear's life cycle, was discussed in terms of the she bear's pregnancy; the she-bear goes into the cave in the winter alone, when she emerges in the spring she is ac companied by her new-born cubs. (3) Aristotle's discussion of the "live-cycle of the bear" may well have been influenced by an ancient and tradi tional image of the bear as mother. (4) There seems to have been a contrasting image of the bear as maiden. (5) Bears look and act like humans. (6) She-bears make good mothers. It is immediately apparent that the ancient Greeks were at least as interested in the she-bear's reproductive cycle as they were in the bear as a victim of the hunt.48 One need, then, no longer query why the she bear was an appropriate adjunct for Artemis Kourotrophos. Of all the wild animals who were protected by Artemis Agrotera, goddess of the wilderness, the she-bear, perhaps because of her human ap pearance and skill at mothering, had from very ancient times sym bolized human maternity.49 It is this image of the bear as mother and the relationship be tween bear reproduction and the process of hibernation which made the she-bear a particularly appropriate paradigm for a coming-of-age festival such as the one at Brauron. Not only does the process of hiber nation parallel the ritual pattern of withdrawal, transformation, and return which the anthropologist Van Gennep identified as the pat tern for all rites of passage,50 but as the she-bear hibernates she is trans formed from maiden to mother: the she-bear withdraws into her cave 48 The same may not be said of the iconographie tradition, where the bear is most frequently shown as the object of the hunt. See the references cited supra n. 13. 49 Could this observation perhaps explain why άρκτος is feminine?

One would be hard-pressed to find a more articulate model for a girl's coming-of-age ceremony. Thus, we may tentatively propose that the maiden άρκτοι at Brauron "acted the she-bear" by imitating the bear's transformation from maiden to mother.51 Certain features of the sanctuary at Brauron support this suggestion. The earliest architectural remains thus far uncovered at the sanctuary consist of a row of small rooms built within a cave or cave-like rock shelter in the seventh century B.C. Remains of fire pits and deposits of votive material inside the rooms, including many fragments from the ritual black figure kraters, suggest that the rooms were used during the festival of the άρκτοι.52 A small, temple like structure dating to the mid-fifth century B.C. was built to the While it is true that the ancient sources suggest that the Arkteia was celebrated in preparation for marriage and it is a commonplace to suggest that a Greek woman married in order to procreate, it must be admitted that the bear's transformation from maiden to mother does not strictly parallel the transformation which partici pation in the Arkteia seems to have recognized. The age group specified for partici pation in the penteteric festival (ten to fourteen or fifteen years old) seems to have been designed so as to enable the girls to "act the she-bear" at about the time of menarche. See Perlman 1983.113-128. Thus, it is the transition from premenstrual to menstrual which the festival marks. The requirement that girls participate in antici pation of their marriage acknowledges the connection between menarche and the ability to conceive and bear children. As a paradigm, the reproductive cycle of the she-bear ignores this betwixt and between stage of marriageable but unmarried and passes from maiden directly to mother. I am indebted to my colleague, Lesley Ann Jones, for alerting me to this problem. Perhaps the explanation for this apparent in congruity lies in the antiquity of the adoption of this model at a time before the con nection between menarche and childbearing was recognized. It is interesting to note that the Greek medical writers advised that the girl's transition from marriageable to mother should be accomplished as quickly as possible, while the Greek language provided a single term for both marriageable girls and new brides, nymphe. The wife becomes a gyne only upon the birth of her first child. See King 1983.112; Cole 1984.243-244, n. 62; A. E. Hansen, "The Medical Writers' Woman," ms. (forth coming) pp. 21-22; "Women in the Hippocratic Corpus," ms. (forthcoming) p. 10. Thus, the stage ignored by the paradigm of the reproductive cycle of the she-bear is the very stage which Greek thought, medical and linguistic, attempted both to isolate and to minimize.

This complex is often identified as the tomb and heroon of Iphigeneia which Euripides and others located at Brauron.53 This is not the place to discuss at length the relationship between Artemis and Iphigeneia. Most scholars agree that Iphigeneia was worshipped as a kourotrophos goddess at Brauron before the arrival of Artemis and was later assimilated to or displaced by the more popular Olympian.54 For our purposes it is sufficient to suggest that in its earliest phase the sanctuary consisted of a kourotrophos cult located within a cave, and that by the middle of the sixth century B.C. the cult belonged to Artemis and the cave was connected with the festival of the άρκτοι. The temple of Artemis, whose remains are visible today, was built towards the end of the sixth century B.C. It consisted of a shallow porch, a cella divided into three aisles, and a rear room or adyton.5S The temple with its adyton is of great interest to us. B. C. Dietrich has observed that temples to Demeter are frequently called megara and that these temples often have either subterranean rooms or adyta.56 Τ♦ Uop Κααη pimrtorta/I tVia rirno\r μιλ/τ/ιι·λμ uroc ο QomifiP 1 Aon «7ΛγΗ deriving from the Hebrew mecara for cave.57 A connection between megaron and cave is suggested by Hesychius who glosses megaron as subterranean rooms and pits and by the scholia to Lucian which seem to equate χάσματα or yawning chasms, megara and adyta.5* Dietrich has suggested that the adyta found in the temples of Demeter should be regarded as "architectural caves" and that they were the locus for cult activities which had once been performed in caves proper. 53 Eur.

The late John Travlos argued that the adyton at Brauron was indeed used for ritual purposes.59 He pro posed that the adyta in the temples of Artemis at Brauron, at nearby Halai Araphenides (modern Loutsa), and at Aulis could be attributed to the chthonic worship of Iphigeneia at each of these sanctuaries. In a recent study of these same three temples, Hollinshead demonstrated that the existence of cults of Iphigeneia at Halai Araphenides and Aulis can not be substantiated.60 Hollinshead argued that the adyta at these three temples were used for non-ritual, utilitarian purposes. Was the adyton at Brauron devoted to the storage of valuables as Hollinshead suggests? I do not believe so. The ancient lexicographers connected an Athenian dictum, Έμβαρός είμι (I am Embaros), with the festival of the άρκτοι. The saying, which meant "I am a very clever fellow," was explained by a story which closely resembles the foun dation legend for the bear festival at Brauron. A bear appears in the Peiraieus and harms many people. Certain young men kill the bear. A plague falls upon Athens. The oracle at Delphi is consulted and Apollo replies that an Athenian maiden must be sacrificed by her father to Artemis. An Athenian, Embaros, consents and appears to perform the sacrifice. But he hides his daughter in the adyton of the temple of Artemis at Mounychia and instead sacrifices a goat dressed in his daughter's clothing. Athenian maidens thereafter "act the she-bear" in honor of Artemis Mounychia.61 There is some doubt as to whether or not a bear festival was indeed celebrated at the sanctuary of Artemis at Mounychia.62 If such were 59 Travlos 1976.197-205. 60 Hollinshead 1985.419-440. 61 Leutsch/Schneidewin, Paroem.

Osborne argues that the dissimilarities in the two sets of aitia (Mouny chian and Brauronian) and the shared ceramic evidence of the krateriskoi indicate that the cults at Brauron and Mounychia followed each its own course before the sixth</page><page sequence="16">126 Paula Périmait the case, we can imagine that the two bear festivals at Brauron and Mounychia were probably quite similar. What interests us is the maiden's concealment in the temple's adyton and the sacrifice of the goat dressed in the maiden's clothing. This peculiar detail of the legend must reflect cult practice; the maiden άρκτοι hid in the temple's adyton." This act of hiding in the adyton brings to mind the image of the she-bear in hibernation who is said to hide, κεύθει, in her lair.64 If Dietrich is correct in his interpretation of certain adyta as "archi tectural caves," then the analogy between the maiden άρκτος hiding in the adyton and the she-bear hiding in her cave is complete. The sacrifice of the goat dressed in a maiden's clothing may well have symbolized the death of the maiden άρκτος and her rebirth as an adult. I suggest that both the earlier, small, cave-built shrine and the later advton served as the locus of transformation for the maiden άρκτοι. "Acting the she-bear" they entered these hiding places where they, like the hibernating she-bear, were transformed, at least ritually, from maiden to mother. Their change in status was perhaps marked by an exchange of clothing: they yielded their maiden clothing which was "sacrificed to the goddess" and assumed the krokoton, the gar ment appropriate for marriageable women and wives. This sacred drama whose central act of transformation was performed within the recesses of a cave or adyton was perhaps the telete or mystery rite mentioned by the scholia to Aristophanes' Lysistrata.65 century B.C. But the ceramic evidence in favor of a common cult at Brauron and Mounychia predates the earliest attestation of the aitia by almost two centuries. See supra notes 34 and 39. For the sanctuary of Artemis at Mounychia see Garland 1987.162, 221 (with references to earlier bibliography). 63 The adyton is mentioned by Eust. II. 2.732. Suda s.v.

Athenian red figure krater with the tele te of the bear festival. On one side Leto, Apollo, and Artemis the huntress with bow upraised are shown. On the other side are two bear-headed or bear-masked figures. Kahil suggested that the two figures should be identified as a masked priest and priestess of Artemis at Brauron. The bear-masked priest sits upon a rock (beside a cave?), while the priestess stands with upraised arms. We witness a scene from the telete of the bear festival. If I am correct to suggest a sacred drama reflecting the bear's reproductive and hibernation cycle, the appearance together of bear priest and bear priestess is best understood at the beginning of the performance: disguised as bears the priest and priestess celebrated a Hieros Gamos, or sacred marriage, as</page><page sequence="17">Acting The She-Bear For Artemis 127 The she-bear, then, as denizen of the wilderness and as an ancient symbol of motherhood, was the appropriate adjunct for Artemis, at once mistress of wild animals and patron goddess of chil dren and childbearing. The reproductive cycle of the she-bear was adopted as a paradigm for female initiation rites. The temple of Artemis acquired an adyton or cave and it was there that maidens underwent the transformation from child to adult. Postscript: The Cult of Artemis Καταγωνίς at Cyrene Let us turn now and briefly consider the worship of Artemis at Cyrene. Inscriptions from the sanctuary of Apollo at Cyrene indicate that Artemis presided over the lives of the women of Cyrene as a kourotrophos goddess.66 She was called by the title Καταγωγίς.67 Chamoux understood this cult title to mean "the goddess who de scends,"68 perhaps in analogy to the Καταγώγια, "The Festival of the Return," celebrated in honor of Aphrodite (Eryx, Sicily), Kore (Sicily), and Dionysus (Athens, Miletos, Priene) and to the cult title of Dionysus, Καταγώγιος.69 But unlike Aphrodite, Kore, and Dio nysus whose periodic withdrawal (usually descent) and return are amply attested in myth and cult, Artemis is not otherwise known to withdraw and reappear. The title is perhaps better understood in an other sense, that of "Artemis the Clothed." Lexicographers defined the καταγωγίς as an article of female clothing. The term appears in a list of "typically female clothing" (ίδια δε γυναικών) in Pollux, while Hesychius glossed καταγωγίς with ίμάτιον ποίον, some sort of hi mation.10 Such a cult title for Artemis is not at all surprising. She was known as Χιτώνη or the equivalent (Χιτωνέα, Κιθώνη) at Miletos, the first act of the ritual drama which transformed the άρκτοι from maidens to mothers. Contra Simon 1983.87-8S, who associated these scenes with the Kallisto myth (the female figure was Kallisto, the male figure her son, Arkas), the transfor mation of the son, Arkas, into a bear is not attested in the literary or iconographie tradition. For the latter, see Trendall 1977.99-101. 66 On the cult of Artemis at Cyrene see Chamoux 1953.311-320. 67 SEG IX, 13, lines 12-13. 68 Chamoux 1953.319. 69 For the Καταγώγια and Dionysus Καταγώγιος see J. and L.

Sappho 22 (Voight) lines 13-14 demonstrates the antiquity of this use.</page><page sequence="18">128 Paula Perlman Syracuse, and possibly in Attica71 and the dedication of clothing, particularly by women, to Artemis is a well-known feature of her worship. The occasions which prompted such dedications no doubt varied from cult to cult, but childbirth must be numbered among them.72 The priestess of Artemis Καταγωγίς, as noted earlier, was called δρκος or bear.73 Sacred laws, inscribed in the fourth century B.C. but undoubt edly of far greater antiquity, commanded new brides to "pay the pen alty" to Artemis (ζ[αμίαν δει] ές Άρτ[αμιν φέρεν]) before going to their marriage bed.74 This regulation recalls the premarriage propiti ation of the goddess which is attested in the foundation legend for the festival of the άρκτοι at Brauron. As at Brauron, payment of the pen alty probably served to assure the young women of Cyrene of the continued protection of Artemis, patron goddess of children and childbearing. The penalty seems to have taken the form of a ritual: [ν]ύμφαν δέ τό νυμφήιον ές "Αρταμιν κατ[ενθ]εν δει, the new bride must go down to the Nymphaion of Artemis.75 Pregnant women were required to do the same.76 It may well be that lines 74-80 of this same inscription ordered the girls of Cyrene to sacrifice (to Artemis) at the time of their menarche. This section of the text begins (line 74) [—ca. 7—]ιν έπεί κα άρξεται, θύενν κατά τόν νόμον. While the word which identifies the group subject to the provisions of lines 74-80 has been lost, a sequence of ritual prescriptions beginning with those for pu bescent girls (lines 74-80), followed by those pertaining to new brides 71 Miletos: Callim. in Dian. 225-226 (Χιτώνη); Rehm 1924.287-290, no. 202 (Κιθώνη); Syracuse: Athen. 14.629e (Χιτωνέα); Steph. Byz. s.v. Χιτώνη. For Artemis Χιτώνη in Attica see schol. Callim. in Iovem 77, Rehm, I.e., and Kondis 1967.184-185. The Attic deme Χιτώνη, mentioned by the schol. Callim., seems to be otherwise unat tested and its existence is to be doubted. Whitehead 1986 does not include it in his "Index of Demes," pp. 474-477. 72 Schol.

Chamoux iden tified an elaborate bathing complex cut into the cliff south of the sanc tuary of Apollo as the Nymphaion and suggested that the ritual "pen alty" included purificatory baths by the new brides and pregnant women of Cyrene.78 This identification has met with a good deal of resistance on the grounds that the bathing complex is located outside of the sanctuary of Apollo (and Artemis) and no overt signs of ritual use were found there.79 The fifth century B.C. temple of Artemis, located in the sanc tuary of Apollo, consists of a shallow porch, a small cella, and an adyton which is nearly as large as the porch and cella combined.80 In the absence of any sign of ritual activity in the vicinity of the bathing complex, I would suggest that the Nymphaion refers to this temple of Artemis — either to the entire structure or to the adyton alone. The function of Artemis as a kourotrophos goddess at Cyrene, the presence of a bear priestess, and the propitiatory service owed the goddess are all features of the cult of Artemis at Brauron. Perhaps at Cyrene, as at Brauron, the adyton of the temple served as the locus of trans 77 Sokolowski 1962, no. 115, restored [ένεβεύε]ιν; Oliverio 1933, no. 57, preferred [ Άρκτεύε]ιν. Such a sequence of ritual prescriptions would support King's thesis that Artemis is most closely associated with the lives of women when they bleed (menstruation, defloration, lochial blood). See King 1983.109-127. 78 Chamoux 1953.315-319. 79 See Goodchild 1971.135-136. Oliverio 1927.215-243 suggested that the Nymphaion mentioned in SEG IX, 72 should be sought in the water channel which fed the Foun tain of Apollo located at the base of the same cliff and to the west of the bathing complex. This identification was made on the basis of Roman graffiti (first-third centuries A.D.) inscribed on the walls of the channel. The graffiti record that the visitors είσήλθεν/είσηλθάμεν είς τάς νύμφας (SEG IX, 278, 284). The section of the channel where the graffiti were inscribed seems to have been cut during the Roman period. That it was a sanctuary of the Nymphs at that time seems quite likely. Whether or not there were earlier phases is uncertain. See also Wright 1957.301-310, who suggests that the water channel was the "true" (original?) location of the Nymphaion and that the term was later extended to include the bathing complex. 80 Dimensions (approximate): porch: 6.0 χ 4.0 m.; cella: 6.0 χ 5.0 m.; adyton: 6.0 χ 9.0 m.
