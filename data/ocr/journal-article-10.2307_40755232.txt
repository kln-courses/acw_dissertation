<plain_text><page sequence="1">JANET BURSTEIN The Journey beyond Myth in Jude the Obscure in Jude the Obscure one confronts an image, quite familiar to the modern reader, of the single self grown beyond its dimly remembered union with the natural and social world. Jude was not the first of Thomas Hardy's works to represent the self thus, in isolation from its world, nor was Hardy the only Victorian writer concerned with this problem. In his Conclusion to The Ren- aissance (1873; rpt. London, 1910), for example, Walter Pater wrote that if we continue to dwell in thought on this world . . . the whole scope of observation is dwarfed into the narrow chamber of the individual mind. Experience, already reduced to a group of impressions, is ringed round for each one of us by that thick wall of personality through which no real voice iias ever pierced on its way to us, or from us to that which we can only conjecture to be without. Every one of those impressions is the impression of the individual in his isolation, each mind keeping as a solitary prisoner its own dream of a world. (p. 235) The individual's capacity to dream his "own dream of a world" may have been celebrated without much qualification earlier in the century, but some Victorian writers, as Pater's essay suggests, associated the development of con- sciousness and personal vision with the isolation and imprisonment of the self. Isolated individuals figure in all of Hardy's later fiction, and their suffering is often contrasted with the more stable lives of men for whom a coherent community still exists. Thus Hardy's work characteristically juxtaposes two modes of perceiving and experiencing life in the world: a modern way in which self-consciousness yields its dubious rewards, and an older way that might be called "mythic." The juxtaposition is artistically effective, for it clarifies peculiarities of each way, and offers to characters within the world of the novels the illusion of choice. Michael Henchard, for example, falls back upon the folk way when he consults the weather seer; and Tess returns to the way of her ancestors when she murders D'Urberville. This characteristic pattern also exists in Jude the Obscure. But although Hardy's last novel is again "all contrasts,"1 it seems to deny both the possi- 1 Florence Hardy, The Later Years of Thomas Hardy (New York, 1930), p. 42.

The first section of this study will approach that apparent denial by setting Hardy's sense of myth in a limited nineteenth-century context. The second section will deal more closely with the novel itself, and will suggest that in Jude Hardy rejected the notion of a fruitful return2 to a mythic way of knowing the experiential world and explored instead the problems of the human journey beyond myth. The term "mythic" seems appropriate to the world of Hardy's rustics,3 for it explains, to some extent, the attractiveness of that world to characters like Tess and Henchard. As many nineteenth-century readers knew,4 myths origi- nated among men who had not yet differentiated themselves from their natural and social worlds; myths, therefore, were understood to express a fundamental coherence of man and world, and to represent a better integrat- ed perception of the world than the self-conscious modern mind could achieve. Moreover, as myth seemed to be the voice of a community in which shared understandings of the world were articulated, it offered the memory of communal support to characters like Tess and Henchard who had grown apart from the ways of their kind. Insights such as these into the nature and function of myth were not uncommon in the literature of the century. Karl Otfried Müller, whose Intro- duction to a Scientific System of Mythology was published in English transla- tion in 1 844 (tr. John Leitch, London), held that myth spoke of both the inner, subjective world of ideality and the objective world of fact (p. 49). George Grote {History of Greece, I [1846; rpt. New York, 1849]) also believed that myth represented an integrated and coherent perception of the world which proceeded from the "instinctive tendencies of the feeling and imagination to transport, to the world without, the familiar type of free will and conscious personal action" (p. 368). Both historians recognized that the perceptions rep- resented in myths were held in common by communities of men: myth derived, Müller said, from an oral and popular tradition (pp. 43-48) and originated with a certain "necessity and unconsciousness" among men (pp. 51-52); and Grote spoke of the Homeric myths as being adapted "to the universal sympathies and hearty interest of a crowd of hearers" (p. 32). 2 Irving Howe {Thomas Hardy [New York, 1967], p. 21) and John Holloway ("Hardy's Major Fiction," in Hardy: A Collection of Critical Essays, ed. Albert J. Guerard [Englewood Cliffs, N.J., 1963], p. 62) place the question of "return" in a context of social change and the disappearance of a stable rural order of life. 3 Both Dorothy Van Ghent (The English Novel: Form and Function, Harper Torch- books [1953; rpt. New York, 1961]) and Richard C. Carpenter (Thomas Hardy [New York, 1964] ) discuss elements of myth in Hardy's fiction. 4 James Kissane's study ("Victorian Mythology," VS, 6 [1962], 5-28) describes the variety of theories about myth entertained by Victorian readers.</page><page sequence="3">The Journey beyond Myth in Jude the Obscure 501 Historians and other, more strictly literary, students of myth were impressed by its "suggestive way of regarding the universe as a spiritual whole, and man in relation to it as a part thereof."5 Walter Pater noticed that even postmythic Greek sculpture represented a human "connexion with earth and air ... direct and immediate; in precise contrast to our physical theory of our life" {Greek Studies [1895;rpt. London, 1967] , p. 331). This "sympathy between the ways and aspects of outward nature and the moods of men" {Greek Studies, pp. 96-97) seems to have been particularly beguiling to Victo- rian minds, for the nostalgia for an older mode of rapprochement between man and Nature exists in much of the literature of the century. Hardy recognized in this "sympathy" between man and Nature the anthro- pomorphizing tendency of the mythic mind. He saw in William Barnes's "peasant" an "absolute dependence on the moods of the air, earth and sky," which was conducive to a mythic perception of nature: "Sun, rain, wind, snow, dawn, darkness, mist, are to him, now as ever, personal assistants and obstructors, masters and acquaintances, with whom he comes directly into contact, whose varying tempers must be well-considered before he can act with effect."6 Hardy perceived this mythically anthropomorphizing tendency of thought in himself as well: "In spite of myself," he wrote, "I cannot help noticing countenances and tempers in objects of scenery, e.g. trees, hills, houses" (LY 58). However, although Hardy seems to have shared an understanding of myth common in this period, he seems also to have been ambivalent about the value of myth as a way of perceiving one's world. On one hand, he under- stood mythic perception to be both characteristic of an earlier stage of human development and essential to all poetic vision: Mr. E. Clodd this morning gives an excellently neat answer to my question why the superstitions of a remote Asiatic and a Dorset labourer are the same: 'The attitude of man,' he says, 'at corresponding levels of culture, before like phenomena, is pretty much the same, your Dorset peasants representing the persistence of the barbaric idea which confuses persons and things, and founds wide generalizations on the slenderest analogies.' (This 'barbaric idea which confuses persons and things' is, by the way, also common to the highest imaginative genius- that of the poet.)7 Hardy later justified the poetic value of this 'barbaric idea' by alluding to his 5 John Addington Symonds, "Nature Myths and Allegories," in Essays Speculative and Suggestive (1890; rpt.

But on the other hand, he declared it part of his own perceptual attitude "in spite of himself and described it as a "semi-mad- ness, which sees enemies, etc., in inanimate objects" (EL 268). This ambivalence towards myth as a mode of perception distinguishes Hardy's attitude sharply from Pater's, for Pater often stressed the need of the modern mind to return to a mythic mode; he spoke of this need in cultural rather than in individual terms in The Renaissance where he suggested that modern culture would benefit from being "drawn back to its sources" for clari- fication and correction (p. 199). Indeed, Pater often pointed to aspects of Greek thought and art that seemed to offer a wholesome corrective to modern tendencies: he cited the saturation of concrete sensual form with human mean- ing in Greek art as a model of coherence (pp. 205-206), and the inclusiveness of Greek religion as a model of spiritual wholeness (pp. 203-204). Contem- plating the Hellenic ideal "in which man is at unity with himself, with his physical nature, with the outward world," Pater was inclined to "regret" man's need to grow beyond that ideal (p. 222). And in the later studies of Dionysus and Demeter, Pater returned to the study of myth itself, rather than its representation in art, to show the chief virtue of mythic imagination: a "unifying or identifying power" which the modern mind, he believed, had lost (Greek Studies, p. 29). The wistfulness of Pater's work may derive from his endless regret that such imaginative power may indeed have been lost to modern men. In Tess of the D'Urbervilles and The Mayor of Cas terbridge Hardy also appears, at times, to betray authorial regret over the loss of myth as a satisfactory way of knowing. But Jude the Obscure faces that loss and seems to accept it as final. Jude's world, as many readers have noticed, is like our own; and the percep- tual and conceptual peculiarities that fragment Jude's experience and isolate him from other men are heavily underlined by the recognition, implicit in the novel, that the illusory hope of a potentially fruitful return to myth has disappeared. From the beginning, Jude the Obscure confronts one with a fictional world scarred by its enforced separation from the age of myth. In contrast to the mythic world, which was distinguished chiefly by the harmony and coher- ence of its features, Jude's world seems tragically disfigured by a lack of coherence, and by the many losses it has sustained in its passage through time. Among these losses one notes first the disappearance of human meaning from the landscape of the novel, for the natural world so rich in associations for the mythic mind has been quite emptied of meaning for young Jude. Of</page><page sequence="5">The Journey beyond Myth in Jude the Obscure 503 all the relics of "local history" at Marygreen, the well-shaft alone remains "absolutely unchanged."8 It discloses a "shining disc of quivering water at a distance of a hundred feet down. There was a lining of green moss near the top, and nearer still the hart's tongue fern" (p. 1 1). This image offers the life-giving qualities of fresh water as a "counterweight" to the arid sterility of other natural phenomena in Jude? the well is represented as the single rem- nant of a vital past in the natural world of the novel, for most other such remnants have been erased. Jude speaks the human response to such a world: " 'How ugly it is here,' " he murmurs, as he observes the large concave field in which he works. But the narrator supplies an insight deeper than Jude's into the reason for the ugli- ness: fresh harrow lines, he says, lent "a meanly utilitarian air to the expanse, taking away its gradations and depriving it of all history beyond that of the few recent months, though to every clod and stone there really attached associations enough and to spare- echoes of songs from ancient harvest-days, of spoken words, and of sturdy deeds" (p. 13). One notes that the narrator assumes a function here that he performs throughout the novel: his is actually the only voice left to speak the richness of a vanished life and time; only his eyes perceive the dimensions of the past which round out the flat, dull features of the world in Jude and give them density and meaning.1 ° A reader comes to depend upon this narrative voice, for until it speaks the events of the plot seem to lack a dimension; the narrator's voice orients one in time and enriches one's experience of the novel by making the past elo- quent. Conversely, characters within the novel who hear no voices like the narrator's seem curiously adrift in time and lost in a world where phenomena may have many contradictory meanings- or none at all. Thus Hardy empha- sizes the impoverishment of such characters' experiences in a postmythic world by juxtaposing Jude's perception of Troutham's Field, for example, with the narrator's. But the novel does not suggest that memory like the narrator's would offer a way of restoring meaning to Jude's world for those who live within it. The narrator may remember roads and pathways once important and now forgot- ten, but he sees too that such roads are largely obsolete. "There is in Upper Wessex," he says, an old town of nine or ten thousand souls; the town may be called Stoke- Barehills. . . . The great western highway from London passes through it, near 8 Thomas Hardy, Jude the Obscure, Riverside Edition (Boston, 1965), p. 11.

Out of this bifurcation and reunion there used to arise among wheeled travelers, before railway days, endless questions of choice be- tween the respective ways. But the question now is as dead as the scot-and-lot freeholder, the road waggoner, and the mail coachman who disputed it; and probably not a single inhabitant of Stoke-Barehills is now even aware that the two roads which part in his town ever meet again. (p. 228) Memory serves here to draw from the past an image of the divisions and separations that disfigure the world of the novel; and memory links the fact of "bifurcation" with the promise of "reunion." But the "railway" has super- seded this road; memory cannot restore it to usefulness, for the uses of the past have been outgrown.1 * One could see in this description of the single road that divides and meets again a wonderfully apt image of the growth of human consciousness and the corresponding changes in the world perceived by men, for as men grow beyond the myth in which all aspects of self and world are fused, the world itself may seem to change; indeed, as consciousness moves towards the differ- entiation of self from world and of "myself from other selves, the natural and social world may begin to manifest "divisions" actually taking place within the human mind. "Division" is, to be sure, an important fact of Jude's world;12 the narrative begins on a note of division- Phillotson's departure from Marygreen-and proceeds to the "split" that divided Sue's parents from each other and the "changes" that have separated Marygreen from its human past (pp. 11-13). Christminster and Marygreen folk have always maintained the strictest separation (p. 16), Aunt Fawley says; and Jude is soon made aware of a "flaw in the terrestrial scheme" (p. 15) that differentiates men from birds. The first chapter thus announces the theme of division in several areas of human life: the separation of teacher from pupil, of present from past, of parents from children (Jude is an orphan, one remembers) and from each other, of townsmen from countrymen, and of men from other creatures. Such divisions seem to be part of the "given" of Jude's world; they are the human facts of life beyond the point where the road divides, and the mythic coherence of man and world gives way to the differentiation of self and the growth of personal vision. But the promise of "reunion" offered by the image of the divided road seems to have become as obsolete as the road itself, for traditional agents of 1 * Masao Miyoshi suggests that "the two roads that branch off only to meet again no longer go anywhere." {The Divided Self: A Perspective on the Literature of the Victo- rians iNew York. 19691 . d. 306.) 12J.

Language, for example, which may have brought men together in the past, now seems to deepen rather than to heal the divisions between them. Jude and Sue are continually frustrated by the failure of words to bridge the separation that divides them from each other; their conversations are both fascinating and bewildering,13 for the great bur- den of their thought and feeling is rarely articulated. When they arrive at the inn, for example, and Sue questions Jude about his previous meeting there with Arabella, Jude admits he "can't explain" this encounter. Sue cries: "O don't you understand my feeling! Why don't you! Why are you so gross! /jumped out of the window!" "Jumped out of the window?" "I can't explain." "... you don't understand me either. Women never do!" (p. 193) Jude turns to a generalization about women because the feelings of this woman are, like his own, unsayable. Thus he seems to have been defeated here, as elsewhere in the novel, by language. Sue's peculiarly capricious verbal behavior suggests that she too senses the inadequacy of language. At times she is evasive, turning conversation away from important subjects (p. 120). At other times she uses language defen- sively, talking "incessantly" of unimportant things "as if she dreaded his indulgence in reflection" (p. 137). Like Jude, who abjures explanation al- together and determines to "keep silence" in some cases (p. 242), she is also capable of suppressing speech. It seems ironically appropriate that Sue's spoken words to Father Time unleash the catastrophe that ensues, for her verbal behavior seems "capricious" only if one overlooks the poten- tially destructive failure of language in this novel to help individuals under- stand each other. Instead of nurturing human relationships by illuminating personal insights that may be generally valid, language in a postmythic world seems chiefly to reflect the disparity between individual and general or conventional percep- tions. Phillotson acknowledges the discrepancy between his own use of lan- guage and the general usage when he says wryly that he has been asked to resign "on account of my scandalous conduct in giving my tortured wife her liberty-or, as they call it, 'condoning her adultery'" (p. 196). And Jude 1 3 Joseph Warren Beach {The Technique of Thomas Hardy [New York, 1962] , pp. 238-240) suggests "we have [in Jude] almost the greatest treasure of dramatic dialogue which [Hardy] or any other English novelist has bestowed upon us." But A. Alvarez ("Jude the Obscure'*'' in Hardy: A Collection of Critical Essays, p. 119) considers "the dialogue [in Jude] . . . forced and awkward. Even granted the conventional formalities of the time, no character ever properly seems to connect with another in talk."</page><page sequence="8">506 JANET BURSTEIN makes a similar discrimination between "their" use of language and his own: when Sue suggests that she and Jude are, in fact, " 'living together,' " Jude replies, " 'Yes. But not in their sense' " (p. 203). The remote legal jargon of the divorce papers (pp. 202-203) and the archaic wording of the marriage contract suggest both the inappropriateness and the superficiality of conventional language. More significantly, these doc- uments suggest the grim consequences that threaten individuals when lan- guage regulates, but does not faithfully represent, individual experience in the world. Jude speaks his awareness of those consequences when he says, twice, that Sue "'does not realize what marriage means!'" (pp. 135,137). And Phillotson, when he has learned the meaning ofthat word, tells his disapprov- ing friend: " 'I don't think you are in a position to give an opinion. I have been that man, and it makes all the difference in the world' " (p. 183). The warning offered at the beginning and repeated close to the end of the novel- "the letter killeth" (pp. 1, 308)- suggests that words may actually be inimical to human life when they have ceased to articulate the deep truth of individual experience. Like the natural world, then, from which past associations have disap- peared, the world of men in Jude has been impoverished by a loss of meaning in conventional language. And in neither case does recollection of earlier meanings or associations relieve the consequent deprivation of characters in the novel: Christminster's illustrious past cannot be brought into any helpful relationship to Jude, and the Widow Edlin's recollection of what "marriage" meant in her own time is quite irrelevant to Sue and Jude and Phillotson, who cannot find in the Widow's memories the value of that word to their own experience. Thus the novel seems to distinguish between artistic and other uses of the past, much as Hardy distinguished the poet's use of myth from its more questionable effect upon his own way of seeing. The narrator's memory offsets the deficiencies of landscape and language for the reader; but memory fails to restore meaning-either to natural phenomena or to words-for char- acters within the novel itself. The failure of language and memory, moreover, is echoed by other failures in Jude which may be associated with what we have called the obsolescence of old ways, or Hardy's denial of the virtue of return. Jude's indecisive returnings to the Fourways in Christminster, his dogged study of dead lan- guages, Phillotson's study of Roman antiquities (p. 1 79), and Sue's passion for pagan statuary (pp. 75-76) are all failures in that they do not afford any usable insights into existential problems. Jude's work in stone may also be seen as a symbolic return manqué, for its object is "regenerative" (p. 68) not creative. The old ways and words in Jude, like the Gothic buildings he seeks to restore, have not only fallen into disrepair; their efficacy has been de- stroyed by the "deadly animosity of contemporary logic" (p. 69), and they</page><page sequence="9">The Journey beyond Myth in Jude the Obscure 507 simply do not work anymore. Antique houses, as Sue puts it, are " 'very well to visit but not to live in' " (p. 160). Thus all the characters m Jude seem to live at a point beyond the "bifurca- tion" of the road, and although memory of an older, more coherent way persists, people find no living traces of it in their world, nor, sadly, any promise that former human values will be restored. In their rootless uncer- tainty they resemble the "proprietors of wandering vans, shows, shooting galleries and other itinerant concerns" who constitute a peculiar feature, "this a modern one," of the landscape at Shaston: As strange wild birds are seen assembled on some lofty promontory, medita- tively pausing for longer flights, or to return by the course they followed thither, so here, in this cliff-town, stood in stultified silence the yellow and green caravans bearing names not local, as if surprised by a change in the landscape so violent as to hinder their further progress; and here they usually remained all the winter till they turned to seek again their old tracks in the following spring. (p. 158) Like the owners of those caravans, some characters in Jude also wish to return to "old tracks," but those who attempt to return find the way back to be as perilous, now, as the way ahead. Initially, return to an older, more mythic way is complicated by those "change [s] in the landscape" that disfigure the world of the novel and frus- trate "further progress." But an even more formidable barrier to return is presented by changes that have occurred within human consciousness itself. Sue, for example, has acquired a way of knowing and of looking at the world that ensures a detachment quite alien to the mythic mind. Sue avoids a mythic immersion in experience and seeks instead to see her world within the firmly established and painstakingly maintained confines of the separate self; the window motif associated with Sue throughout the novel suggests that she is identified with a way of seeing that functions satisfactorily only within a frame. She talks more comfortably with Jude when there is a window frame between them (pp. 162, 168); and her many notes to Jude, as well as her exchange of notes with Phillotson, may indicate that she is less fearful of the word when it is fixed on a page. Sue's delight in the roses exhibited at the fair might also be seen in light of her dependence on frames: as she avoids con- fronting Jude's feeling or her own (p. 165) because, "seeing it more than he, [she] would not allow herself to feel it," she seems also to avoid confronting the feelings stirred by lovely things in their natural context; the roses at the fair, one remembers, have been cut out of context for exhibition and wait passively to be admired and "named" (p. 234). Frames may allow Sue to control the chaos of impressions experienced by the modern, self-conscious mind, "ringed round," as Pater put it, "by that</page><page sequence="10">508 JANET BURSTEIN thick wall of personality"; but Sue's control is, at best, precarious; her detachment is threatened both by her husband's assertion of his conjugal rights and by the boarding school's assertion of conventional standards. And her way of seeing seems to make it impossible for her to deal with such threats: in both instances she retreats precipitately through windows. These two jumps, and the number of doors she tries to tie or lock shut (pp. 174, 180), suggest that in her case detachment has ripened into alienation. She has become, like Pater's "solitary prisoner," incapable of moving outward from the self to deal with the world beyond. Indeed, she is unable to proceed through doorways (pp. 214-215) or even to open one herself: when she res- cues her pigeons she merely pulls out the peg of the cage door, trusting the birds to open it themselves (p. 243); and in her final interview with Phillotson she hovers helplessly between the closed doors of her bedroom and his. Sue's "progress" is clearly "hindered," then, by her way of seeing and of being in the world, as well as by the nature of the world she experiences. And her return is similarly obstructed. Though she seeks to reenter an older, more mythic coherence of man and world, she remains imprisoned within the frame of the self. The narrator describes her attempted return as an "ex- change" in which reason yields to anthropomorphism: after the children's funeral, he reports, Jude and Sue sit silent, more bodeful of the direct antagonism of things than of their insensate and stolid obstructiveness. Vague and quaint imaginings had haunted Sue in the days when her intellect scintillated like a star, that the world resembled a stanza or melody composed in a dream; it was wonderfully excellent to the half-aroused intelligence, but hopelessly absurd at the full waking; that the First Cause worked automatically like a somnambulist, and not reflectively like a sage; that at the framing of the terrestrial conditions there seemed never to have been contemplated such a development of emotional perceptiveness among the creatures subject to those conditions as that reached by thinking and educated humanity. But affliction makes opposing forces loom anthropo- morphous; and those ideas were now exchanged for a sense of Jude and herself fleeing from a persecutor. (pp. 270-271) Sue exchanges sophisticated and highly individualistic "ideas" here for an old convention that rests upon naive belief, rather than reason: ''We must conform!" she said mournfully. "All the ancient wrath of the Power above us has been vented upon us, His poor creatures, and we must submit. There is no choice. We must. It is no use fighting against God!" (p. 271) But the exchange is quite fruitless. The comforts of embracing an "anthropo- morphous" God who acts upon his creatures and orders their experience are denied to Sue by her awareness, never wholly repressed, that no such God</page><page sequence="11">The Journey beyond Myth in Jude the Obscure 509 exists (p. 271). Moreover, her submission does not alleviate her alienation; on the contrary, she remains convinced that the world is unalterably hostile. She wishes to "satisfy the world which does not see things as they are" (p. 285) because she cannot conceive a genuine reconciliation of "their" world and her own; thus, her submission affirms her weakness but preserves her separate- ness. One notes that the dramatic consequences of Sue's return to anthropo- morphism justify Hardy's ambivalence about myth as a way of knowing and expose the dangers latent in nostalgia for a mythic way. Phillotson's development reveals still another problem inherent in the notion of return. He does not abandon reason for belief; he seeks instead to replace principle with instinct, to "exchange" the rules that govern human relationships in a civilized world for the unconscious and instinctive fellow feeling that may have provided social coherence in a mythic world. Phillotson is " 'only a feeler' " he says, " 'not a reasoner' " (p. 184), and when first he acts by '"instinct, and let[s] principles take care of them- selves' " (p. 182) his feeling for Sue allows him to release her from an untena- ble contract. Like Jude's feeling for the hungry birds, this instinct is obvi- ously benign. But human feeling cannot be relied upon, it seems, to work sympathetically in all situations; Phillotson's treatment of Sue at the novel's end, still motivated by feeling, is no longer kind, but incredibly cruel. The narrator explains: Principles which could be subverted by feeling in one direction were liable to the same catastrophe in another. The instincts which had allowed him to give Sue her liberty now enabled him to regard her as none the worse for her life with Jude. He wished for her still, in his curious way, if he did not love her, and, apart from policy, soon felt that he would be gratified to have her again as his, always provided that she came willingly. (pp. 283-284) Clearly, neither the subversion of principle by instinct nor the exchange of reason for anthropomorphic belief accomplishes a fruitful return. The com- fortably coherent world once conceived by the mythic mind, and dimly remembered by modern men, seems inaccesible now; one cannot reenter it by way of belief in its Gods, nor can one restore it by abjuring principles and reinstating a "magic thread of fellow feeling" (p. 14) as a basis for human relationships. Neither human belief nor human sympathy seems to have sur- vived the passage through time intact; both have been qualified by the devel- opment of self-centeredness and personal vision. These developments in human consciousness are most explicitly dealt with in Jude himself, for Jude's self-absorbtion and the limitations it imposes upon his perception of the world are obvious throughout the novel. Indeed, Jude's subjective manipulation of the objective world seems almost deliberate at times: the narrator says that although Jude "knew well, too well, in the secret</page><page sequence="12">510 JANET BURSTEIN center of his brain, that Arabella was not worth a great deal as a specimen of woman kind. . . . For his own soothing he kept up a factitious belief in her. His idea of her was the thing of most consequence, not Arabella herself, he sometimes said laconically" (p. 48). Jude also fashions other experiential phenomena nearer to his own desire: in Christminster when he passed objects out of harmony with [the city's] general expression he allowed his eyes to slip over them as if he did not see them. A bell began clanging, and he listened till a hundred and one strokes had sounded. He must have made a mistake, he thought: it was meant for a hundred. (p. 64) When the phenomenological world evades the form he projects onto it, Jude adjusts the evidence of his senses to make it accord with his personal vision. The narrator's description of Jude's childhood suggests that this perceptual and conceptual manuvering may be linked to the growth of human conscious- ness in time. As young Jude works in Troutham's Field he experiences a peculiarly mythic, or childlike, sense of harmony with the world: a "magic thread of fellow feeling united his life" with the feeding birds, and he grants them their food though it is not his to grant. His punishment separates him sharply from this way of seeing: whirled round by the angry farmer, he sees "the hill, the rick, the plantation, the path, and the rooks going round and round him in an amazing circular race" (pp. 14-15). Jude weeps afterward, from shame, and feels "more than ever his existence to be an undemanded one" (p. 16). And when he reflects upon the experi- ence, he conceives the shame and pain and disharmony in "Nature's scheme," which prevents hungry birds from feeding and boys from feeling wanted, as inevitable aspects of growing up: Events did not quite rhyme as he had thought. Nature's logic was too horrid for him to care for. That mercy towards one set of creatures was cruelty towards another sickened his sense of harmony. As you got older, and felt yourself to be at the center of your time, and not at a point in its circumference, as you had felt when you were little, you were seized with a sort of shuddering, he perceived. All around you there seemed to be some- thing glaring, garish, rattling, and the noises and glares hit upon the little cell called your life, and shook it, and warped it. If he could only prevent himself growing up! He did not want to be a man. (p. 17) Jude's growth in this episode might serve as a metaphor for the growth of human consciousness beyond the mythic stage, for they have in common the separation of the human being from the natural world with which he once identified himself (in the birds), the loss of community (his life is "unde-</page><page sequence="13">The Journey beyond Myth in Jude the Obscure 511 manded"), and the emergent sense of self as both distinct from and central to its world. One must pause on the last point, however, for it speaks a misapprehen- sion of the episode as one sees it from the narrator's point of view. Jude's perception of himself as central to a whirling, "glaring, garish, rattling" world is understandable in his circumstances, but it is clearly inaccurate. Though he sees himself fixed in the center of an agitated world, he is actually being whirled round within a world vastly more stable, at the moment, than he. And his initial perceptual error is deepened and fixed by further reflection. He associates growth not only with the differentiation of self and world, but also with the notion of self as central to its world; thus he projects a new relationship or "harmony" quite feasible from a subjective point of view, but sadly inappropriate to the objective reality of his situation.1 4 In short, Jude moves beyond the "bifurcation" of the road, and the loss of mythic coherence, into the cell of the self where the reciprocal development of man and world ultimately ceases. For Hardy, however, an end to such mutual development was inconceivable. His personal writings reveal that he was, on the contrary, deeply committed to continued evolutionary growth. Hardy recognized the "woeful fact that the human race is too extremely developed for its corporeal conditions, the nerves being evolved to an activity abnormal in such an environment" (EL 285). Nevertheless, he seems to have believed that despite the "woeful facts" given to perception by the post- mythic world, human consciousness must continue to evolve: "the visible signs of mental and emotional life," he wrote, "must like all other things keep moving, becoming" (PW 56-57). Hardy knew the pain of evolution: "It is the ongoing-i.e. the 'becoming'-of the world," he wrote, "that produces its sadness" (EL 265). But he appears to have believed that that sadness was an inescapable fact of the human condition in his time.1 5 Thus, although the novel presents "sadness" as a fact of contemporary life, Jude's maturing responses may also present an image of the way men might learn both to grow beyond myth and to endure the sadness that accompanies such growth. Symbolically, Jude's way, like Sue's, is identified with doors 14 It might be useful to set Jude's problem here against the Romantic notion of the "central self discussed by P. M. Ball in The Central Self: A Study in Romantic and Victorian Imagination (London, 1968). 13 The commitment to evolutionary growth and to the notion that such growth depended upon a continuing relationship of man and world also appears in the work of Hardy's friend, Edward Clodd, whose view of mythic perception was quoted above. In The Story of Creation: A Plain Account of Evolution (London, 1888), for example, Clodd writes: "The functions of living things are three-fold-nutrition, reproduction, and relation; in other words, to feed, to multiply, to respond to the outer world" (p. 93). Indeed, Clodd affirms "the interrelation of all living things" (pp. 109-110, 145) and argues that life and evolutionary growth depend largely upon the adaptive response that organisms learn to make to their surroundings (pp. 176-177, 188).</page><page sequence="14">512 JANET BURSTEIN and windows-but his perspective is significantly wider, more open than hers. His view from the barn roof at the Brown House in Marygreen is dominated, to be sure, by a single object of desire (p. 18), but by the time he ascends to the many windowed "octagonal chamber" in Christminister he commands a succession of views and is able to place himself quite realistically within the wide world he now perceives (p. 94). Unlike Sue, who appears to withdraw to the security of framed and shut- tered windows, Jude seems to proceed vigorously through the successive doorways presented to him by his experience (pp. 140, 209). He is able to look at the world in Christminster "meditatively, mournfully, yet sturdily" (p. 94) because he has begun to learn to live with the sadness of becoming. His first response to early trauma was, as we have noted, quite negative: having substituted the isolated unit of the self for the outgrown unity of self and world, Jude wished he could "prevent himself growing up. He did not want to become a man." His second disappointment is more easily borne: although the Latin and Greek textbooks shatter a "grand delusion" (p. 27), Jude recovers: "in the course of a month or two after the receipt of the books Jude had grown callous to the shabby trick played him by the dead languages"; indeed, "to acquire languages, departed or living, in spite of such obstacles as he now knew them inherently to possess, was a herculean perfor- mance which gradually led him on to a greater interest in it" (p. 27). Similarly, although he attempts suicide just after his quarrel with Arabella, he later accepts his situation with almost philosophic calm: " 'I am a man,' he said. 'I have a wife. More, I have arrived at the still riper stage of having disagreed with her, disliked her, had a scuffle with her, and parted from her" (p. 60). And his realistic assessment is succeeded by a new resolution: "Surely his plan should be to move onward through good and ill- to avoid morbid sorrow even though he did see uglinesses in the world ... to do good cheer- fully-which he had heard to be the philosophy of one Spinoza, might be his own even now" (p. 61). One notes that although Jude's "progress" is "hindered" it is not, like Sue's, wholly obstructed. Jude does not seem to be immobilized by the cruelties of experience; he grows beyond them. And he remains deeply involved in the stuff of his life even as he acquires the perspective necessary to endure that involvement. Unlike both Sue and Phillotson, he holds to the reality of personal, self-conscious experience while he learns to abandon self- centeredness and to perceive himself in a larger context. Though he outgrows the notion of self as central to its world, he acquires a sense of himself as vital, and related to the world of other men. In some respects the world of men seems, in this novel, to have replaced the personal God once believed to have shaped the universe for man's educa-</page><page sequence="15">The Journey beyond Myth in Jude the Obscure 513 tion and delight.16 Jude alludes to such a replacement in the novel (p. 271), and the substitution accords with Hardy's thinking, as one sees it in his journal. Preoccupied with the disappearance of a personal God, he wrote: I have been looking for God fifty years, and I think that if he existed I should have discovered him. As an external personality, of course- the only true meaning of the word. (EL 293) But three months later, concerned with what was left to men when the "anthropomorphous" Diety accessible to the mythic mind had disappeared, Hardy wrote: Altruism, or the Golden Rule, or whatever 'Love your neighbor as yourself may be called, will ultimately be brought about I think by the pain we see in others reacting on ourselves, as if we and they were a part of one body. Mankind, in fact, may be and possibly will be viewed as members of one corporeal frame. (EL 294) The world of men in Jude is hardly like the "one corporeal frame" envisioned by Hardy in this passage, but the novel does suggest that this may be anew "harmony" to be sought by those who would journey beyond myth. Indeed, despite Jude's often painful singularity, he may approach such a conception of harmony, for he begins to perceive a relationship between himself and other men. He attempts to describe this new perception to Sue: "I have seemed to myself lately ... to belong to that vast band of men shunned by the virtuous- the men called seducers. It amazes me when I think of it! I have not been conscious of it, or of any wrongdoing towards you, whom I love more than myself. Yet I am one of those men! I wonder if any other of them were the same purblind, simple creatures as I? ... Yes, Sue- that's what I am. I seduced you. . . . you were a distinct type- a refined creature intended by Nature to be left intact. But I couldn't leave you alone!" (p. 271) Jude's insight, drawn from deeply personal experience, is extended in this passage to the "vast band of men" called seducers; and the extension both Yelates Jude to others like himself and fills the word "seducer" with new meaning. Thus Jude seems to participate here in solving a fundamental 16 One can find an extensive discussion of this idea in J. Hillis Miller's The Form of Victorian Fiction: Thackeray, Dickens, Trollope, George Eliot, Meredith and Hardy (Notre Dame, Ind., 1968).</page><page sequence="16">514 JANET BURSTEIN problem of the postmythic world; perhaps language, like an ancient wine cup richly engraved with vineleaves-yet empty-must be replenished with the truth of personal experience if it is to satisfy human need and work against individual isolation. Jude recognizes the need as well for a corresponding re-creation of value, based upon personal experience, in the conventions that create and govern social coherence in a postmythic world. In words that evoke the memory of Pater's Marius, Jude describes his "present rule of life" to the crowd at Christminister. Like Marius, who reassured himself that he had done no man harm, Jude says: " 'I doubt if I have anything more for my present life than following inclinations which do me and nobody else any harm, and actually give pleasure to those I love best' " (p. 259). But his next words extend this limited concern with self and loved ones into the world of other men: " 'I perceive,' " Jude says, " 'there is something wrong some- where in our social formulas: what it is can only be discovered by men or women with greater insight than mine,- if, indeed, they ever discover it- at least in our time' " (p. 259). As one critic has noticed, Marius's philosophy was restrictive: "he cannot act, cannot mingle, cannot read his time right or guide it."1 7 Jude suffers some of the same limitations, but he moves beyond Marius insofar as he asserts that the inadequacy of "social formu- las" affects him and that "insight" must relate those formulas to the facts of personal experience. Finally, it seems fitting that although Jude dies with Job's curse on his lips the responsive voice of God is silent, and one hears instead the raucous noises of an ignorant multitude. The scene images both the disappearance of a personal God and the undeniable disharmony in Jude's world-the cruel absence of coherence among men. But this scene also presents an image of the way in which such coherence might be recreated, for the partly opened window allows "their" voices to enter Jude's room, and to furnish there a human context for his last despairing words. Thus the novel offers no panacea for despair in a postmythic world, nor any hope of returning to the more comfortable world of myth. It offers instead the somewhat baffled quest of sensitive and vulnerable individuals for a way of relating themselves again to a world both ignorant of and indifferent to their needs. And it suggests as well that the relationship they seek will rest upon their ability to penetrate the isolation of self-centered personal vision- to open windows rather than withdraw behind them. Jude fumbles toward such a goal throughout the novel, and his openness and growing enlightenment may redeem, to some extent, his many failures. One 17Miyoshi,p. 279.</page><page sequence="17">The Journey beyond Myth in Jude the Obscure 515 is depressed by those failures, one supposes, because Jude's journey is so painful, and so obscure. But Hardy offers no consolation other than Jude's confidence in the "essential soundness" of his way and the suggestion that, like Jude's dream of going to college (p. 258), the reconciliation of man and world is a goal to be sought through many generations by those who journey beyond myth.
