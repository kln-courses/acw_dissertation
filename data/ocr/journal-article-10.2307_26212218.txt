<plain_text><page sequence="1">DEITY AND HUMAN AGENCY IN PLATO'S LAWS Blair Campbell One of the many criticisms levelled against the Laws by students of Plato's moral and political thought is that the system of religious belief and practice prescribed in Book X has the effect of annulling human agency. This charge dates back at least as far as George Grote, who contrasts the 'persecuting spirit and self-satisfied infallibility' of the Laws with the 'inquisitive spirit' of Socrates in Phaedo, Apology, and Gorgias.x According to Grote, Plato has taken the part of Meletus against Socrates in the Laws, aligning himself with the forces of religious obscurantism that have ever sought to thwart western man's claim to an autonomous sphere; Laws is thus compared to Euripides' Baccae and Aristophanes' Clouds, as well as to the Inquisition of medieval Catholicism.2 Similarly, Theodor Gomperz likens Plato's Magnesia to the Jesuit-ruled state of Paraguay.3 Human agency is nullified, according to Gomperz, by Plato's denial of free will; the prevailing attitude in Laws is 'an indifference to every form of personal initiative, a disposition, as we may even say, to enslave men's souls which is absolutely astonishing'.4 And more recently, John Gould has repeated this charge in his Development of Plato's Ethics. According to Gould, who detects a 'curiously Christian ring' to Plato's argument, 'submission is the paramount virtue of the Laws, submission to god in the character of law'.5 1 George Grote, Plato and the Other Companions of Socrates (London, 1875), III, pp. 409-10, 306. 2 Ibid., pp. 306,410-11. 3 Theodor Gomperz, The Greek Thinkers (London, 1968), III, p. 262. 4 Ibid., pp. 258-9,262. 5 Gould further observes: 'In obedience to the law, the average man can live in accordance with divine truth, for law is the visible representation of such truth. It enables him to answer with certainty the question which would otherwise be beyond him: "What line of conduct is agreeable in the sight of god and follows his way?'" John Gould, Development of Plato's Ethics (Cambridge, 1955), pp. 102-4,124-5. This charge is also raised, although in somewhat different form, in Karl Popper's Open Society and Its Enemies (New York, 1963), I, pp. 103,219 (6n), and in A.W. Adkins' Merit and Responsibility (Chicago, 1975), pp. 302-12. However the general tendency among contemporary commentaries on the Laws has been to skirt the issue addressed in this paper: Leo Strauss's The Argument and the Action of Plato's Laws (Chicago, 1975) is more a summary than an interpretation; Glenn R. Morrow's Plato's Cretan City (Princeton, 1960) HISTORY OF POLITICAL THOUGHT. Vol. II. No. 3. Winter. November 1981.</page><page sequence="2">418 Β. CAMPBELL It is undeniable that this theology is offensive to modern liberal sensibilities. The life of Plato's citizen is intertwined with religious affairs in a manner that seems repugnant to us as legatees of a secular political tradition. Yet there is a problem with the accusation that Plato's theology denies human agency. Deriving its force largely from historical analogy (Paraguay, medieval Christendom, etc.), it tends to construe as an intrinsic connection what would appear to be no more than an historical correlation. On the face of it, there is no necessity that belief in gods such as those described in Book X (non-venial beings who are concerned with human affairs) should result in a scheme of life which reduces man to submissive passivity. Logically, it is even possible that such gods may reinforce human prowess by endowing man with an autonomous conscience or a free will, a natural law or a svstem of natural rights. Nor is the historical concomitance on which this accusation rests invariant. While it is true that a number of major assaults on western man's sense of agency have been conducted under religious banners, it is no less true that religious groups and doctrines have provided some of the most potent safeguards against such assault. In the United States, this is evident within the field of constitutional law, where such groups as the Quakers, Jehova's Witnesses, and Seventh Day Adventists have been singularly effective in preserving the rights and liberties that maintain our sphere of autonomy.6 Similarly in the realm of doctrine, it is primarily from religion that we have derived the very conceptions mentioned above — 'conscience', 'free will', 'natural rights' — which have served as hallmarks of autonomy in the west. It would seem, then, that the relationship between religion and human agency is an open one, both in theory and practice. We cannot infer from the discusses Plato's theology only in relation to existing religious practice; and Maurice Vanhoutte's La Philosophie Politique de Platon dans les "Lois" (Louvain, 1954) deals primarily with the formal aspects of Plato's science of politics, especially in relation to Platonic aesthetics. Similarly, the recent literature addressed directly to Plato's theology ignores the charges of Grote et al., although a tendency exists here to confirm these charges in effect. Several contemporary studies of Book X (cited below) have suggested that Plato's true religious beliefs are either unstated or misstated in the Laws, and some have ascribed this to political motives. The few studies that have sought to vindicate human agency in Laws have done so almost exclusively on psychological grounds, ignoring the problems posed by Plato's theology (and thus the charges raised by Grote and his recent proponents). See, for example, R.W. Hall's Plato and the Individual (The Hague, 1963), pp. 187-226, and T.L. Pangle's 'TTie Political Psychology of Religion in Plato's Laws', American Political Science Review, LXX (1976), pp. 1059-76. 6 Even our aversion to religious legislation is attended by more complexities than we care to acknowledge; here we tacitly concede that the correlation with repression is not invariant. For instance, we are prone to characterize as liberal certain modern countries (such as Israel) that promote religious belief by means of law. And even within our own national tradition—which has been, perhaps, most adamant in separating religion and state—we are not entirely consistent on this score: we have enshrined in our most highly venerated legal document the belief in a divine creator, a self-evidently transcendent guarantor of our 'inalienable rights'.</page><page sequence="3">DEITY &amp; HUMAN AGENCY IN PLATO'S LAWS 419 mere existence of a religion (even a state religion) any a priori consequences for the notion of an autonomous human sphere. Insofar as this is true, two methodological corollaries follow for our assessment of Book X of Plato's Laws. First it implies that we must view Plato's theology as logically problematic. Granted that Magnesia, in some sense, is presided over by god or gods, what, precisely, does this mean for humanity — what is the scope of divine power? Do the gods enjoy a monopoly of purposive decision and action (like Yahweh of the Old Testament), or is their purview confined to limited areas? Similarly, we must ask a specific question regarding the quality or nature of divine power before we can draw any conclusions regarding human agency: Is this power personal, arbitrary (again, like that of Yahweh), or is it in some manner limited? Or, to use political concepts for what is essentially a political issue, is this power autocratic or constitutional — does it present an obstacle to, or a framework for, human accomplishment? Not only are these questions logically feasible; it becomes apparent, once they have been raised, that they are historically apposite as well. In seeking to clarify the logical issue, we see that the question of historical analogy is problematic even within the confines of Plato's Magnesia, for Greek historical tradition would seem, prima facie, to warrant the second answer to each of our questions. Greek religion tended to refuse the gods a monopoly on purposive action, just as it was wont to impose a 'constitutional' framework upon divine power.7 This leads to our second methodological corollary: we must set aside our historical prisms in investigating the relationship of deity to man in Magnesia. Since history offers conflicting lessons on this score, the application of historical analogies must beg the question, offering a prejudgment — cast in the form of a disinterested inevitability — of the very issue it purports to address, i.e. whether in fact Plato's theology grants the gods a monopoly on significant decision and action in the cosmos. My purpose in this paper is to suggest that if we divest ourselves of such tendentious analogies in approaching this issue, the implications of Book X for human agency seem considerably less dolorous than has been claimed. Indeed Plato affords humanity much greater independence from 'higher' forces in the Laws than in the Republic. The function of the theology of the Laws seems less to deny the legitimacy of an autonomous human sphere than to provide this with cosmological justification. 7 See F.N. Cornford's discussion of this point in his From Religion to Philosophy (New York. 1957), i-iii.</page><page sequence="4">420 Β. CAMPBELL The scope of divine power: Plato and Protagoras It is true that in his explicit asseverations regarding god's province, Plato seems to confer total scope on divine power. As has been noted, the Laws is Plato's most 'pious' work, the only dialogue that 'opens with the word "god" it is god who is the author of human law.® Indeed god would appear to be 'author' of everything within the cosmos, or at least to provide the standard according to which all accomplishment is measured. On this score Plato is quite explicit: Protagoras had been wrong in exalting man as the cosmic measure; 'in our eyes God will be "the measure of all things" in the highest degree — a degree much higher than is any "man" they talk of.10 Yet in his descriptions of the actual role the gods are to play, both within the state and the cosmos, Plato does not adhere to this claim. On the contrary, having repudiated Protagoras in principle, he seems to confirm, even to surpass, Protagoras in practice. Man appears to be the measure not only of all 'things' but of divinity as well. This is most apparent in his treatment of the state's ritual gods, the conventional deities ('established by law') of Greek state religion discussed in Book VIII and elsewhere. These gods are measured unabashedly by the human standard of political expediency; their worth (and indeed their reality) is conferred by their efficacy in fostering the bonds of community. It will be most advantageous for our citizens to be unified, Plato observes — unified in respect of language and law, sacred rites and 'all matters of religion'.11 Thus religious ritual seems to be viewed as a stabilizing instrument, no different in this respect from other sociological, economic, or political tools. Each division of the state is assigned its own god or daemon or hero,12 just as it is assigned its lands, courts, and magistrates. Similarly, the practice of private religion is forbidden on what would appear to be political grounds. This practice encourages the endless proliferation of altars and shrines, and it fosters religious charlatans who 'propitiate the gods privily by sacrifices and vows ... so that the whole State reaps the consequences of their impiety in some degree'.13 Here Plato's objective is apparently to forestall the ties of 8 Strauss, Argument and Action, p. 2. Pangle makes the same point in his 'Political Psychology of Religion', p. 1059. 9 Plato, Laws, 624a. '"Ibid., 716c. " Ibid., 708c. 12 Ibid., 738de. 13 Ibid., 909d-910d</page><page sequence="5">DEITY &amp; HUMAN AGENCY IN PLATO'S LAWS 421 religious superstition such as had swept Athens, undermining her morale in the fourth century (especially during the last days of the Peloponnesian War).14 While this anthropocentric tendency is less apparent ir. the theology of Book X, it is no less pervasive. The conception of the gods here is far too vague to provide the measure of man, for even the most fundamental issues of theology are evaded. We cannot, for instance, determine whether Plato's view of deity is monotheistic or polytheistic, or whether (or to what extent) god is immanent or transcendent. Plato vacillates on the issue of monotheism throughout Book X. At times he even changes his position in mid-discussion, opening a paragraph with an allusion to 'the gods' and closing it with a reference to 'the Supervisor of the All' (tô tou pantos epimeloumenô).'5 And he is equally unclear concerning god's relationship to the natural world. At times Plato seems to identify deity with the nature gods of traditional Greek religion, in contrast to the 'scientific' trend of philosophy. Thus god is equated with soul16 which, like the gods of Hesiod and Homer, is endowed with qualities of personality. Having established that soul is prior to body, he infers that 'opinion and reflection and thought and art and law will be prior to things hard and soft and heavy and light... '.17 Also soul comprises 'wish, reflection, forethought, counsel, opinion true and false, joy, grief, confidence, fear, hate, love, and all the notions that are akin to these'.18 Accordingly, divinity seems to be immanent in the world of nature, as with traditional religion. Soul, like the gods of Hesiod, has an origin in time; although it is temporally prior to bodies, it is only 'one of the first existences'.19 Indeed soul would seem 14 This is Morrow's interpretation; Plato's Cretan City, pp. 430-4. See also M.I. Finley's account of the effects of such superstition in Athens in his 'Socrates and Athens', Aspects of Antiquity (New York, 1974), pp. 58-72. 15 Plato, Laws, 903e-904a. '6Ibid., 892, passim. 17 Ibid., 892b. 18 Ibid., 896e-897a. It is true, as R. Hackforth has noted, that Plato does not actually endow deity with personality. See Hackforth's 'Plato's Theism', Classical Quarterly, XXX (1936), pp. 7-8. Nonetheless, Plato's gods are vested with a sufficient number of anthropomorphic qualities to set him at odds with the spirit of Greek philosophic speculation on this score. See, for instance, Xenophanes of Colphon's strictures against such anthropomorphism, frags. B. 11-12, B. 14-16, in Hermann Diels and Walther Kranz, Die Fragmente Der Vorsokratiker, I (Berlin, 1956), pp. 132ff. " Plato. Laws, 892a.</page><page sequence="6">422 Β. CAMPBELL to be confined to the world of nature by definition, for its defining property is movement: it is 'the motion able to move itself'.20 But Plato's account departs from traditional religion in an important way. While soul is the agent of change, it appears to be governed by standards or uniform rules ('the law and order of destiny')21 which seem, therefore, ontologically prior. Thus Plato would appear to be proposing a second-order or derivative god, in violation both of religious and philosophic tradition. To assign the attribute of divinity to soul seems arbitrary and misleading, inasmuch as this attribute was ordinarily reserved for' non-derivative existents. Greek religion had also confronted this problem, for the Gods of Homer and Hesiod were also confined within a skein of Destiny. Yet for these Destiny had provided only a limit, a restraining, rather than a directing, force.22 Within the bounds of Destiny, the gods could indeed provide the measure of thines. Obviouslv. Plato does not ont for this solution. for the laws of Destiny seem to direct soul. Nor does he seem to propose an alternative solution. Moreover, Plato adduces ethical standards that also are in some sense prior to the divine soul; it is possible to make moral judgments regarding deity. Soul is good, Plato observes — it 'runs aright and always governs things rightly and happily' — only when it works 'in conjunction with reason'; conversely, it 'produces results which are in all respects the opposite' when it functions 'in converse with unreason'.23 Thus axiologically as well as ontologically, we confront the problem of a derivative god: if the value of psychic activity is assigned in accordance with a higher standard, then the attribute of divinity would appear to belong to this higher standard, rather than to psyche. This problem has led a number of scholars to identify Plato's god with reason, rather than with soul. Thus Hackforth argues that since deity must be possessed of independent, rather than derivative existence, and must be the final cause of all that is 'good, orderly, and rational', Plato's god must 'himself [be] identified with Reason'.24 If Plato is less than explicit on this score, 20 Ibid., 896a. 21 Ibid., 904c. 22 Thus Cornford describes moira as 'always static, a system rather than a force [which] leans toward the negative side'; it 'stands for the limit of what you may do, and for what will happen if you exceed your limit'. From Religion to Philosophy, p. 34. 23 Plato, Laws, 897b. 24 Hackforth, 'Plato's Theism', pp. 5-7. Similarly, Friedrich Solmsen, after noting Plato's vacillation on the issue of the primacy of soul/mind, concludes that god as cosmic orderer is nous·.</page><page sequence="7">DEITY &amp; HUMAN AGENCY IN PLATO'S LA WS 423 proponents of this interpretation suggest we must remember that the theology of the Laws is political (and thus limited) in purpose: 'Plato is not concerned to give us the whole of his metaphysics, or even of his philosophy of religion, in the Laws·, his object is to lay down the necessary minimum of philosophical doctrine required for a sound basis of religion and morality; and from that point of view it is not necessary to go into the difficult question of the relation of νους to the Universe or (what is the same thing) the relation of νους to ψυχή, the principle of movement in the Universe'.25 It is true that Plato's theology is 'political' in aim — at least in the broadest sense. He makes no attempt to disguise this. On the contrary, his account of the gods is punctuated throughout by references to its political import. 'No one who believes', he states at the very outset, 'in the existence of the gods has ever yet . . . uttered a lawless word'.26 Atheism is not merely mistaken; it is execrable, because it teaches that politics is unnatural and that justice reduces itself to force.27 And in concluding his proofs of god's existence he again stresses its human, or political, significance: 'our desire for victory was due to our fear lest haply, if [atheists] gained the mastery in argument, they should suppose that they had gained the right to act as they chose — those men who wickedly hold false notions about the gods'.28 Yet to explain the inadequacies of Plato's theology by reference to its political aim only beclouds the issues, for it is precisely in view of this aim that his account of deity becomes most problematic. In the first place, this explanation ignores the fact that Plato here offers to provide the citizens of Magnesia with a cogent, coherent account of the gods. He has explicitly accepted the burden of producing 'adequate proofs' (têkmeria legontes hikana).29 Consequently, while his theology is political in its application, it must be sufficiently thorough in scope and rigour to withstand the Friedrich Solmsen, Plato's Theology (Ithaca, 1942), pp. 112-16, 154-5. Raphael Demos also subscribes to the noetic interpretation of Plato's god; see his 'Plato's Doctrine of the Psyche as Self-Moving Motion", Journal of the History of Philosophy, VI (1968), pp. 133-45. 25 Hackforth, 'Plato's Theism', p. 6.

But a more serious problem with the noetic conception of god is that such a deity could not meet Plato's requirement of providing man with a cosmic measure of mortal affairs, for nous is ultimately inscrutable. Before offering a description of nous, the Athenian cautions his interlocutors that they must not expect to gain direct understanding of its nature: 'In making our answer let us not bring on night, as it were, at midday, by looking right in the eye of the sun, as though with mortal eyes we could ever behold reason and know it fully; the safer way to behold the object with which our question is concerned is by looking at an image of it'.30 If god is pure reason he is, then, like the Good of the Republic, beyond the world of motion31 and, therefore, of mortal comprehension; he is a god transcendent. Although this notion of an inscrutable, transcendent reality had been adequate to Plato's purpose in the Republic, it cannot suffice as foundation for the civic religion of the Laws. Plato's earlier aim had been to establish an absolute ideal, uncompromised by the limitations and demands of mortal nature. The question of the applicabity of this model to the world of motion was of little importance.32 Consequently, Plato could afford to evade, in the Republic, the seemingly impossible task of reconciling a metaphysics grounded in an inscrutable Good with the requirements of a public scheme of knowledge. Apprehension of the Good is granted only to a philosophic élite, and even among these ultimate insight must remain ineffable, for transcendent truth is not subject to demonstration.33 Obviously, such a conception cannot sustain a theology that requires vindication by 'proofs.' Still less can this transcendent truth provide a measure for human affairs. As the cave analogy indicates, this conception must leave man isolated, separated from ultimate reality by an unbridgeable gulf. It serves not to measure but to deny validity to mortal 'things'. That the Republic was unsatisfactory as an ethical and political treatise — that it required to be supplemented by a 'second best' conception of the 1 ibid., 897de. 31 That the reason underlying the theology of Laws is a form of motion within the world is evident at 897c: 'the whole course and motion of Heaven and of all it contains have a motion like to the motion and revolution and reckonings of reason, and proceed in a kindred manner . .

Lamb (Gorgias), R.G.Bury (Epistles/Laws), Paul Shorey (Republic). 32 Plato dismisses this question with the observation that affairs of action are inherently less susceptible of truth than is his verbal construction in the Republic·, 473ab. 33 Plato, Laws, 506d-507a.</page><page sequence="9">DEITY &amp; HUMAN AGENCY IN PLATO'S LAWS 425 human order—is, therefore, at least partially attributable to its metaphysical tidiness. Because Plato had sought to safeguard transcedental truth against the logical dilemmas inherent in the notion of becoming, he ended up by casting politics adrift from its metaphysical moorings.34 Thus while the theology of Laws is elliptical and inconsistent in comparison with the Republic's metaphysical symmetry, from the mortal perspective this theology is more thorough than the earlier scheme. In its tacit insistence that metaphysics provide human direction, the Laws directly confronts a paradoxical necessity that had escaped Plato in the Republic: if ultimate reality is to provide the measure of things it must, in some important sense, be commensurate with these things. A yardstick is useful only insofar as it shares a common dimension with the objects it is to measure. And if these objects are possessed of intelligence, they must themselves be capable of apprehending this dimension of commonality, of gauging the yardstick in turn, assessing its accuracy in embodying this dimension. Unlike the inhabitant of the cave, the citizen of Magnesia will accept as measure only that of which he himself has taken the measure. This paradox is fundamental to Plato's refutation of the second and third propositions of atheism, that the gods do not concern themselves with human affairs and that they can be bribed. Here it becomes evident that the gods are to be judged by the standards governing human justice, for these refutations are conducted entirely on the basis of human analogy; it is the just man who provides the measure of correct behaviour for divinity. The second proposition is false because it reduces the gods to the fatuous level of a man who sets for himself the goal of accomplishing 'great things' but neglects the small details essential to their accomplishment. We would judge such a man as either ignorant or indolent; on neither reckoning is he praiseworthy. If this is true of a man, 'Shall we then assume . . . that the gods are ignorant and that it is through ignorance that they are neglectful when they ought to be showing care, — or that they know indeed what is useful, yet act as the worst of men are said to do, who, though they know that other things are better to do than what they are doing, yet do them not, owing to their being somewhat defeated by pleasures or pains?'.35 Such gods would be inferior to the lowliest of 34 'For surely, Adeimanthus, the man whose mind is truly fixed on etermal realities has no leisure to turn his eyes downward upon the petty affairs of men, and so engaging in strife with them to be filled with envy and hate, but he fixes his gaze upon the things of the eternal and unchanging order, and seeing that they neither wrong nor are wronged by one another, but all abide in harmony as reason bids, he will endeavour to imitate them, and as far as may be, to fashion himself in their likeness and assimilate himself to them'; Plato, Republic, 500bc.

CAMPBELL mortals with respect to justice — not merely to the humble herdsman, but even to his watchdog who, faithful to his charge, resists the small bits of prey offered as bribes by predatory wolves. If these 'would never betray justice for the sake of gifts impiously offered by unjust men', then we are entitled to expect that those who 'watch over the fairest things' will maintain comparable standards; therefore it cannot be true that the gods are venial.36 Conceivably, of course, these arguments amount to nothing more than a lapse of logic, a capitulation (whether reflexive or calculated) to popular anthropomorphism. Yet this is unlikely, for as Plato's description of the just atheist indicates, the standards of justice exist independently of belief in gods. There are some men 'who, though they utterly disbelieve in the existence of gods, posses by nature a just character, both hate the evil and, because of their dislike of injustice, are incapable of being induced to commit unjust actions, and flee from unjust men and love the just . . . \37 Here man is himself the sole bearer of these standards. If it is true that as cosmic measure God must conform to justice, then Plato's theology would seem to be 'political' in a sense quite different from that suggested by Hackforth et al. It does not offer merely a diluted version of reality, a deity simplified and clouded in benign obscurity for the benefit of the popular mind. Rather it raises a claim upon divinity itself: deity must be found by the standards governing humanity to be worthy of human acknowledgement. While the notion of a transcendent, inscrutable god, a noetic deus absconditus, may be tenable as mysticism, this notion is a theological absurdity, for it posits a theos of which no logos can be rendered.38 Greek theology, insofar as it sought to provide an intelligible account of deity, was necessarily 'political', presupposing as it did that deity is subject to public inquiry. And this presupposition — already apparent in the theological speculation of the early Greek naturalists — itself rests upon the paradoxical demand for a commensurable cosmic measure; god can be 'public', subject to proofs, only to the extent that he shares a common bond with man.39 Thus irrespective of Plato's mystical perceptions regarding the 'true' nature of 36 Ibid.. 906b-907c. 37 Ibid., 908bc. 38 Significantly, it is Plato himself who coined the term 'theology' (θεολογία), in reaction to the 'mindless absurdity' of Homer's portrait of the gods; Republic, 379a ff. See Werner Jaeger's discussion in The Theology of the Early Greek Philosophers (London, 1964), pp. 4,194, n. 13. 39 The notion of τα όντα which had served as the point of departure for early theological speculation, was originally used to denote a man's household goods and property. In appro priating this term for theology the Milesians had taken it for granted that deity must conform to 'the given realities of human experience'. Jaeger, Theology, pp. 18-19.</page><page sequence="11">DEITY &amp; HUMAN AGENCY IN PLATO'S LA WS 427 deity, the exclusive concern of his theology is soul, the quality uniting divinity with humanity. Only in respect of god's 'animate powers'40 does Plato attempt to offer adequate proofs. Abstracted from soul, god must be reduced to the status of a 'chance' force, from Plato's theological perspective, as the atheists claim. In this respect, the question whether Plato's references to nous are veiled allusions to a more comprehensive conception of divinity, offered in other dialogues41, is beside the point. The mere fact that Plato chooses here to confine theology to the world of becoming confers on this world a legitimacy, indeed a cosmic significance, that is unthinkable from the perspective of the Republic, where becoming and action are dismissed as illusory. Whereas the Republic had offered, categorically, a transcendent conception of reality, the Laws poses two alternatives, alike in their rejection of the Republic's axiological otherworldliness. Either the gods are outside the world of nature — in which case they forfeit centre stage to soul, for they are beyond the pale of theology and thus are axiologically and practically otiose, of no significance whatever regarding the issue of human agency — or the gods exist within the world of nature and thus are subject to the same standards of value and reality as is humanity itself. The gods must then 'concern themselves' with human affairs, in this important sense, if they are to be worthy of man's concern. The fact remains, however, that man is directed by omnipresent standards which seem endowed with divinity. To observe that the gods also are governed by these does not fully resolve the issue of human agency, for it still appears that divinity, if not god, is the measure of all things. But whence these standards? On this score, the noetic interpretation is unassailable: the divine standards directing Plato's god are throughout conceived in terms of reason. Insofar as reason would appear to constitute a final principle, it is indeed 'god', as this conception suggests. Still this interpretation does not achieve its purpose. It does not resolve the central paradox of a derivative god, for this paradox is recapitulated within reason itself. If we seek to discover what, 40 Plato, Laws, 906b. 41 This question has been widely discussed in its various aspects.

CAMPBELL precisely, Plato means by nous, we encounter conflicting answers. In the first place, we seem to receive an inconsistent account of the relationship existing between reason and ethical conduct. Reason provides the ethical standards for soul, as we have seen, which man, as psychic subject, fully shares; his soul, like that of god, is good or bad according to its conformity to reason. Yet nous is ultimately inscrutable; man is limited in his capacity for rational apprehension. Nonetheless, Plato does not conclude that man is to any degree impaired in his capacity for making ethical judgments. On the contrary, the eschatology included in Book X indicates that man is to be held fully responsible for his decisions, despite his seeming inability to comprehend their ultimate ground. Thus either reason is and is not available to mortal consciousness or, correlatively, rational understanding is and is not essential for ethical conduct. And reason presents still another paradox concerning its relation to rules. At times Plato suggests that reason is, by definition, law-abiding. As we have seen, reason is a form of motion or 'revolution', which is defined by its conformity to rules; it moves 'regularly and uniformly around the same things, and in relation to the same things, according to one rule and system'.42 It is this rule-abiding quality of reason that confers ethical value upon action: the good soul presiding over the universe directs events in a motion 'like the motion and revolution and reckonings of reason', whereas a bad soul would govern in a 'mad and disorderly way'.43 However, in Book IX Plato states that reason is averse to the constraint inherent in rules. After dismissing the notion of a philosophic autocrat as a practical impossibility, he observes that should such a man arise, he could not be bound by rules or laws, 'for no law or ordinance is mightier than Knowledge, nor is it right for reason to be subject or in thrall to anything, but to be lord of all things if it is really true to its name and free in its inner nature'.44 Here again, the notion of reason would seem to become immured in contradiction: reason is and is not subject to laws or rules. Consequently, the problem would appear to reside in Plato's ambiguous conception of 'reason', rather than in his theology. Admittedly, the notion of an autonomous agent governed by the standards of reason seems inseparably connected with Plato's theology, especially inasmuch as it is given fullest expression in Book X. Yet the seeming irreconcilability, within a theological context, of the conflicts inherent in this conception suggests a different conclusion — that these conflicts might reflect an intrusion of non-theological ! Plato, Laws. 898a. ' Ibid.,891cd. ' Ibid.. 875ac.</page><page sequence="13">DEITY &amp; HUMAN AGENCY IN PLATO'S LA WS 429 preoccupations upon Plato's account of divinity. This conclusion seems especially warranted if we examine the Laws' theological paradoxes in the context of his earlier writings. It becomes apparent that these paradoxes do not, of themselves, entail a logical conflict; nor are they, properly speaking, theological in nature. In the earlier dialogues they manifest themselves as a quandary on Plato's part regarding the relation of intellect to the ethical and political orders; reason is formulated in two alternative perspectives — as a mode of cognition and as a mode of action—which are never fully reconciled. In the dialogues touching upon the intellectual's role in society, Plato seems to imply that rational cognition, at least in its ultimate phases, is necessarily private in nature, because it is insusceptible of rule-direction. Two qualities serve as benchmarks for reason in this sense: a direct perception or intuition of the object of thought and, at the psychological level, a feeling of complete certainty regarding the validity of this perception. The first quality is evident in Plato's frequent resort to myth and mysticism in describing the experience of rational 'vision'. And the psychological standard is stressed in the Socratic dialogues; here cognition would seem to rest almost exclusively upon a sense of psychological certainty.45 Both of these benchmarks are ineffable and thus beyond the pale of technê or rule-directed activity. The point that rational intuition transcends the limits of language and method is underscored even more emphatically in Epistle VII46 than in the Republic, and it is even implicit in Plato's account of Socrates' career in the early dialogues. Of itself, the Socratic elenchos could achieve only negative results; while Socrates was himself deeply committed to positive beliefs, as the Apology attests, he could no more successfully impart these to others than could the philosopher-king of the Republic. Specifiable rules are inadequate as vehicles of consciousness because thought is, by its very nature, illimitable; it cannot be channelled by the procedural determinants of 'methodology'.47 Rules, to be useful, must be fixed, stated explicitly and accepted unequivocally, for they cannot direct if (like the wickets of Alice's croquet game) they are themselves subject to 45 See Gould's analysis of Socratic έπιστήμη in Development, i, as well as Norman Gulley's Philosophy of Socrates (London, 1968), p. 202ff. 46 Here it is insisted, in response to Dionysius' claim to have written a book on Platonic metaphysics, that the subject of first principles cannot be addressed in books: 'For it does not at all admit of verbal expression like other studies, but, as a result of continued application to the subject itself and communion therewith, it is brought to birth in the soul on a sudden, as light that is kindled by a leaping spark, and thereafter it nourishes itself;' 341cd. 47 In addition to the discussions of this point in Republic and Epistle VII, see Phaedrus 274b-278b and Epistle II. 314ac.</page><page sequence="14">430 Β. CAMPBELL endless redirection. Hence for Plato, thought governed by such rules cannot be fully rational because such thought is necessarily confined, bounded by extraneous verbal barriers that confront intellect with a rigid inscrutability: 'the creatures of painting stand like living beings, but if one asks them a question, they preserve a solemn silence. And so it is with written words; you might think they had intelligence, but if you question them, wishing to know about their sayings, they always say only one and the same thing.'48This is not to suggest that intellect is utterly autistic. Discursive thought must have a procedure of sorts, just as it must resort to language. But these serve only as a springboard and a proving ground for intuitive apprehension, and as such they must be endlessly flexible, ever responsive to change. Ideas, once apprehended, 'are refined at length, like gold, with prolonged labor', and this occurs by means of a process of endless repetition lasting 'for many years'.49 Such is the true 'methodology' of reason; ex post facto and determinedly indeterminate,50 it seems the antithesis of rule-directed activity. But while Plato is more emphatic than most western thinkers in stressing that rational cognition must be free in its upper reaches (so emphatic, indeed, that he seems more akin to oriental than to western thinkers in this respect), he also stresses that rational conduct must everywhere be shaped by principle. Action, unlike thought, must be rule-directed. Here the alternative to rule direction is not intellectual spontaneity and independence but rather subjugation by the irrational forces of impulse and emotion. Action then is necessarily determined; man can only choose his determinants: he can elect to become a 'slave' of rational principle and law or, alternatively, to lapse into the reflexive behaviour of a child or a madman, driven by the whimsical dictates of pleasure and pain, fear and anger. Moreover, as a mode of action, reason must ever be subject to the requirement of demonstrability. The rational agent must be prepared to offer public justification for his principles. He must show that his conduct is consistent with the rules that sustain his identity as a civil being. Like the pious citizens of Magnesia who have been challenged by the atheists, he must offer convincing 'proofs', cast in the ordinary language of public life.51 48 Plato, Phaedr., 275d. 49 Plato, Ep. II, 314a. 50 Plato is so determined to prevent verbal ossification of his own ideas as to deny ever having committed them to writing: 'no treatise by Plato exists or will exist, but those which now bear his name belong to a Socrates become fair and young.' Ep. II, 314c. 51 Thus Socrates promises his jurors in Apology that he will conduct his defence 'with the same words with which I have been accustomed to speak both in the market place at the bankers' tables, where many of you have heard me, and elsewhere'. 17c.</page><page sequence="15">DEITY &amp; HUMAN AGENCY IN PLATO'S LA WS 431 This practical conception of reason is introduced in the Laws at the very outset, providing man with his ethical duty and, consequently, theology with its 'political' charge. The great ethical problem of politics is that of self control;52 'if men are capable of ruling themselves they are good, but if incapable, bad'.53 And the measure of self-rule is the individual's capacity for adhering to the principle of rule or law lodged within his soul.54 Here, as elsewhere, Plato is recapitulating a theme that had recurred throughout his ethical discussions in previous dialogues. He had already vindicated rational conduct as man's ethical and political aim in Gorgias·, as in Laws, the human soul is good insofar as it evinces regularity and order, and these states 'are called lawfulness and law, whereby men are similarly made law-abiding and orderly'.55 And in Gorgias also, rational conduct must be susceptible of demonstration: 'If you dispute my views', Socrates observes in contrasting his technë with irrational oratory, Ί am ready to give my reasons'.56 Although these alternative conceptions of reason have not been finally reconciled in the Laws, it seems apparent that the practical conception has gained unchallenged ascendancy. The notion of a purely speculative reason unbounded by rules is merely acknowledged in passing; it does not — indeed cannot, as Plato's discussion of the hypothetical philosophic autocrat 52 Plato, Laws, 626de. 53 Ibid., 644b. 54Ibid., 644e-645c. 55 Ibid., 504bd. 56 Ibid., 465a. This view of reason as a mode of action had provided the rationale for the numerous craft analogies on which Socrates relied throughout the early dialogues. Reason, insofar as it is analogous to the various technai that comprise civilized life, is pre-eminently a form of principled action, governed by rules that are susceptible of demonstration. Thus Gould observes: 'In putting forward the thesis that αρετή is only to be attained by έπιστημη, Socrates was not asserting that αρετή necessarily results from a personal apprehension of the nature of good and evil (still less, of Good and Evil), but that for the achievement of αρετή what is required is a form of moral ability, comparable in some respects to the creative or artistic ability of potters, shoemakers and the like; that the έπιστημη which Socrates envisaged was a form of knowing how, knowing, that is, how to be moral;' Development, p. 7. Moreover, this conception had informed Plato's discussion of the tyrannical man in the Republic (562a-580a), as well as his attack on the Athenian mob and its demagogues in Gorgias. The self-indulgent man is every where for Plato a victim of tyranny because he lives without rule. Even though he exercises absolute power (whether individually, as with the tyrant of the Republic, or collectively, as with the Athenian demos of Gorgias), he is himself a creature of forces beyond his control. His behaviour is reactive, contingent upon factitious appetites that can be endlessly manipulated by orators. According to Socrates, these orators, 'set on gratifying the citizens . . . sacrificing the common weal to their own personal interest', treat the populace as children. (Gorgias 502e) Thus oratory—unlike the true knowledge of which it is an imitation—cannot offer proofs. (465ab).</page><page sequence="16">432 Β. CAMPBELL indicates — suggest an ethical alternative to the life of action, as it had in the previous dialogues. Simply by virtue of grounding the universe in soul as an active principle governed by rules, Plato would appear to have made his choice: the contemplative life cannot provide ethical values for an active being. It is exclusively as a practical mode that he accords ethical significance to reason: everything in this universe is evaluated by the standard of rule abidingness; merely to prove that a good divinity presides over the world is to demonstrate that technê is divine.57 In its normative content this theology would seem merely to have given the stamp of cosmic validity to the ethic of Gorgias. While the conception of virtue as lawfulness is now afforded religious sanction, it is not itself theological; it stands beyond theology, binding god no less than man. God also must evince the qualities of law58 and justice59 in his conduct if he is truly lord of man's world. That this standard has the effect of diminishing the grandeur of divine authority can occasion little surprise, for it had achieved the same result in the political world of Gorgias. The demand that action be directed by demonstrable principles is necessarily corrosive of claims to personal authority (whether political or divine): an authority forced to conform to the canons of 'proof ceases thereby to be an authority, for even should he succeed at such proof, his claim to credence and deference has been transferred from his person or office to the canons governing his argument. Thus had dissolved the authority of Pericles when confronted with this demand in Gorgias: 'if you like to bring forward witnesses against the truth of what I say . . . there is the whole house of Pericles or any other family you may like to select in this place. But I, alone here before you, do not admit it, for you fail to convince me.'60 The stipulation that the gods be subject to proofs is not then 'political'. It is a requirement intrinsic to their role as rational agents, for as such their authority can only reside in the validity of these proofs. Should they reveal themselves inconsistent in word or deed, they, like Pericles, must forfeit their claim to deference. Suppose, for instance, that a god should attempt to defend the proposition that a life of pleasure is superior to the just life. This proposition is inconsistent with the god's most fundamental commitment as a rational agent because it is based on the assumption that the determinants of 57 Plato, Laws. 892b. 58 Ibid. "Ibid., 906bc. 60 Ibid., Allah.</page><page sequence="17">DEITY &amp; HUMAN AGENCY IN PLATO'S LA WS 433 appetite should govern life, rather than those of reason. Thus it must be dismissed as a 'monstrous statement', even in the mouth of a god.61 By the same token, Plato's anthropomorphic refutations of the second and third propositions of atheism are neither so narrowly political nor so naive as they appear. Here, too, he is imposing the standard of consistency upon the gods: it would be inconsistent with the rules of intelligent action to neglect details and to respond to bribery. Thus it would seem that the scope of divine power does not by any means exclude human agency. The standards defining this scope — of which deity is then 'derivative' — are not conferred by a transcendent reason, as has been claimed. They are rather the ethical standards of an enlightened humanity; in Plato's theology, as in his account of ritual religion, man is the measure of all things. This theology is problematic precisely because it has been superimposed upon an essentially anthropomorphic conception of existence. The notions of a derivative, though autonomous, being and of a reason precommited by principle, which seem hopelessly obscure as theology, become quite familiar as ethical conceptions. Here, in their proper setting, they have enjoyed a central role in western speculation, for the ethic of Gorgias has outlasted the theology with which it had been conjoined in the Laws, recurring, in varying forms, in the writings of Aristotle, Rousseau, and Kant. The quality of divine power: man as autonomous puppet Most of the relevant issues concerning the nature of divine power have been addressed in the previous section, for the rules defining the scope of divine governance also define its quality: god's reign over the cosmos is necessarily constitutional rather than autocratic. It would appear that his initial choice to govern in accord with reason has removed the element of wilfulness from god's power. Directed by the 'motion' of reason, this power is impersonal; it assumes the form of a 'natural law'62 and, as such, is not subject to arbitrary alteration. However, there remains one major problem concerning the issue of human agency. Whereas in Gorgias, the rational or rule-directed life had been 61 ibid., 662de. 62 On natural law in Plato's Laws see Solmsen's Plato's Theology, pp. 151-74; Glenn R.

God's initial decision to govern rationally appears to have denied ethical value to human choice. It is true that divine power does not extend directly into human affairs, since god superintends the universe only as a whole.63 But the fact that he has opted for a rule-abiding universe would seem of itself to vest the ethical significance of human conduct in its conformity to divine will, rather than in man's own choices: 'To each of these parts, down to the smallest fraction, rulers of their action and passion are appointed to bring about fulfillment even to the smallest fraction; whereof thy portion also, Ο perverse man, is one, and tends therefore always in its striving towards the All, tiny though it be.'64 Since god's original decision to act rationally was of itself arbitrary (it cannot, exhypothesi, be rational, inasmuch as god becomes rational only by virtue of this decision), it would seem that humanity is subject, after all, to the arbitrary power of god, no matter how benign, and that man is indeed a 'puppet',65 directed by an ethic of obedience rather than of human agency. Nor is this problem conhned to the sphere ot metaphysics. It becomes exacerbated in practical affairs, for here man appears to forfeit his ethical agency to the more immediate and tangible compulsion of the state. In emphasizing that reason is preeminently law-abiding, Plato has raised the possibility, at least, that the state, as agent of law, is to be viewed as the mundane embodiment of divinity. Thus in politics, too, ethics seems defined by the standard of obedience rather than by choice; the citizen appears virtuous to the extent that he obeys the state. Plato himself seems to suggest this conclusion at times. Political law is a repository of the rational or calculative faculty (logismos66). As reason's ordering,67 it embodies correct judgments of good and evil68 and, therefore: 'the virtuous man is he who is the best servant of the laws and the most obedient'.69 Consequently, it would appear that the state, as worldly executor of divine law, has also supplanted human agency, as Plato's critics have charged. It is true that Plato weights the alternative choices available to man: to follow the course of appetite is to suffer, both in Magnesia and in the afterlife. Nonetheless man has retained the capacity (and the duty) of choice. This is apparent, at the most obvious level, in the character of the citizens. Plato 63 Plato, Laws, 903bff. 64 Ibid., 903be. 65 Ibid., 644d. 66 Ibid., 644cd. 67 /b/rf., 713e-714a. 6* Ibid., 728ab. 69 Ibid., 822e-823a.</page><page sequence="19">DEITY &amp; HUMAN AGENCY IN PLATO'S LA WS 435 acknowledges that even in Magnesia there will always exist those who have opted for wickedness. And despite Plato's contempt for such persons, he cannot deny that their life is indeed an expression of choice. Even this wickedness must be based on decision,70 for man cannot escape his duty by passive acquiescence in the urges of appetite. A war continually rages within each of us71, fomented by the 'antagonistic and foolish counsellors, whom we call by the names of pleasure and pain'.72 Since the appetites are at once imperative and mutually antagonistic, human life must remain problematic at the most visceral level. Thus atheists, for example — who have clearly chosen in a manner contrary to the good deity presiding over the universe — will always exist; they 'are always springing up, in greater or less numbers'.73 There can be little doubt that Plato believes their choice to be a calculated one, for he presents atheism as a coherent posture which, he hopes, can be altered by persuasion. Plato's acknowledgment that some will always choose in defiance of god is not merely a grudging concession to mortal frailty. In the first place, man's ethical independence from god is stipulated by the very conception of soul on which Plato's theology rests. Man has a duty to choose his own course by virtue of his psychic endowment; to shirk this duty is quite literally to forfeit his soul. Soul provides man, no less than god, with his identity and his ethical value. Of all man's possessions it is 'most his own',74 the quality that 'makes each of us to be what he is'.75 Although god and man are placed on common ground by virtue of their status as psychic subjects, they are also separated thereby in a manner so fundamental as to demand autonomous spheres for each, since soul is by definition a self-actuating power, 'the motion able to move itself.76 Therefore while man is, as mortal creature, a 'puppet', ever 70 Although Plato reiterates the Socratic dictum, 'every wrongdoer is a wrongdoer involuntarily', (731c) he does not adhere to this view. Ignorance now is only third in importance among several causes of vice; 863c. Further, Plato now suggests that the individual's choices can conflict with his rational judgments. (689a) Thus T.J. Saunders has concluded that Plato has here abandoned the Socratic claim that virtue is knowledge. 'The Socratic Paradoxes in Plato's Laws', Hermes, XCVI (1968), pp. 421-34. 71 Plato, Laws, 626e. 72 Ibid., 644c. 73 Ibid., 888b. In addition to atheists, there exists a class of citizens 'of a stubborn nature', who have 'shunned education', opting for a life of wickedness. (880e). 74 Plato, Laws, 726. "Ibid., 959b. "Ibid., ma.</page><page sequence="20">436 Β. CAMPBELL responsive to the myriad antagonistic 'sinews' of appetite, as psychic subject he is no less free, no less a causal agent, than is god. Like god (and like the virtuous man of Gorgias), he chooses his own determinants. If the citizen of Magnesia is indeed rational this has nothing to do with divine choice; it is because he has chosen, and achieved, a life of self-mastery, the greatest victory of all.77 He has seized control of the golden lead-string of reason within his soul, 'couteracting thereby the pull of the other sinews', making this logismos a law unto himself.78 More important, perhaps, for Plato's pious citizen, human choice is stipulated as an eschatological duty. The world of man remains mortal and, therefore, cannot provide a final haven for his immortal soul. An ultimate accounting of his existence as the fruit of his own agency is required if he is to believe that his choices finally count. He must be convinced that these are not merely illusory or ephemeral, subject to summary nullification by a higher force beyond this life. Accordingly, Plato offers eschatological sanction for human agency, reversing the causal relationship posited in the Republic between mortal and post-mortal existence. In the Republic's myth of Er, mortal life had been presented as the effect of an other-worldly cause. The soul's worldly fate had been chosen and given the stamp of necessity before its present incarnation.79 This amounts to a doctrine of predestination since, at least from the mortal perspective, man's lot has been cast in advance. But in the Laws the soul's eschatological fate is itself determined by man's worldly choices;80 post-mortal existence is here an effect, rather than a cause, and this effect occurs automatically, without benefit of divine ministration.81 Thus 77 Ibid., 626e. 78 Ibid., 644e-645b. 79/b/rf.,617d-621a. 80 The Laws is not unique among Plato's works in suggesting eschatological sanctions for conduct; Phaedo and Gorgias had both advanced this claim. But as Saunders has shown, the eschatology of the Laws is unique in two crucial respects. Whereas in the past Plato had merely adapted popular myths to his own purposes—with only limited success (see his apparent dissatisfaction with such myths in Gorgias 527a)—now his eschatology is given scientific status. Moreover, the earlier eschatology had required a deity—a Minos or Rhadamanthus—to decide the individual's fate in the afterlife. But now 'all that is in question is the state of the soul [which] automatically, mechanically, by itself, determines where the soul is to go'. T.J. Saunders, 'Penology and Eschatology in Plato's Timaeus and Laws', Classical Quarterly, n.s. XXIII (1973). p. 237. 81 Plato, Laws, 903e-905c. Victor Goldschmidt argues that the system of choice described in the myth of Er does not differ essentially from the automatic eschatology of Laws since, according to the Er myth, the souls ordinarily choose in accordance with preferences acquired in the previous existence; La Religion de Platon (Paris, 1949), pp. 84-5. But this argument ignores the fact that these preferences are themselves the result of a previous eschatological choice; in each instance of palingenesis, the soul's mortal fate has been predetermined before birth. In Laws this causal relation has been reversed.</page><page sequence="21">DEITY &amp; HUMAN AGENCY IN PLATO'S LA WS 437 man's freedom from the consequences of divine choice extends even beyond the grave. The superintendent of the universe exercises no greater effect upon the human soul in its eschatological than in its mortal form. Still, the political problem remains. Metaphysical and eschatological freedom do not of themselves preserve a sphere of ethical choice, especially when the state appears to embody—and to enforce—the 'proper' choices for man. Before addressing this problem, however, it is necessary to narrow the issue, since Plato has been criticized here on different fronts. The question of human agency vis-à-vis the state is compounded by Plato's somewhat inordinate preoccupation, as political thinker, with the norm of social stability, for this norm seems to collide with that of reasonableness throughout the Laws. Inasmuch as it entails the possibility of a wicked citizenry, choice is not necessarily conducive to social order, regardless of its importance for the ethic of practical reason. Consequently, ethics often αρρναιο ιν/ givv naj iv puimvai ^ApwuiWltJ III X 1ÛIU 5 LU1I31I UL-llUIl UI Magnesia; many of the educational and legal doctrines seem directed by the aim of minimizing the significance of personal choice. The individual is educated in conformity from infancy, not merely to the law, but to the attitudes and beliefs that heighten his dependency upon society. Correlatively, the state is given the broadest scope, encompassing almost the entirety of life. So thorough is Plato in this respect that he has been accused of denying human agency in practice, quite apart from considerations of principle.82 This aspect of the issue, however, is beyond the scope of the present essay. Here the question is not whether the state supplants human agency in practice, but whether it is ethically entitled to do so — whether the state is granted superior ethical value by Plato's theology. Although the state may deny human choice in fact, we cannot assess the significance of such denial until we have addressed the prior ethical question; unless it can be shown that the state is ethically superior, the 'fact' can only establish that politics is morally wrong and, therefore, that Plato is mistaken within his own premises. Ethically the state appears to have its justification in the soul's need for a constitutional framework. Practical reason, as we have seen, is rule-abiding; rational decision must occur within a framework that is itself beyond rational denial. This is the central ethical function of the Law's theology, to provide reason with its 'primitive terms', without which intelligent understanding cannot proceed. Plato has hereby minimized the threat of solipsism inherent 82 This is the gravamen of Adkins' indictment in Merit and Responsibility ·, see p. 303. Glenn R. Morrow raises a similar point regarding Plato's proclivity for 'thought-control', in 'Plato's Conception of Persuasion', Philosophical Review, LXII (1953), pp. 234-50. I will discuss these criticisms in separate essays.</page><page sequence="22">438 Β. CAMPBELL in Socrates' demand for personal knowledge in the early dialogues without, at the same time, supplanting this demand with a scheme of transcendent truth, as in the Republic. Personal understanding is achieved only within the publicly-shared framework stipulated in Book X.83 But the human soul requires more than a theological framework if it is to be rational. Reason must compete with other forces, for even at his best man remains a creature of sentiment no less than of reason, swayed by tradition and public opinion,84 as well as by habit85—that process of reflexive choice which can be formed only at the countless petty junctures of decision underlying quotidian consciousness. Most important, there lurks an incorrigible hedonist within, as we have seen; mortal reason must rest upon a foundation of passion and appetite that confines choice within its imperative polarities of pleasure and pain. While all these personae can be merged with intellect, they cannot be abolished, for they have their own claim upon the human soul.86 Consequently, it is insufficient for the individual merely to choose the life of reason; this choice must be sanctioned by the non-rational elements themselves, so that his conceptions of pleasure and pain will concur 83 This necessity for a publicly-shared epistemological and ethical framework seems to underly Plato's insistence that the persistent atheist be put to death. Such treatment is incomprehensible on merely political or religious grounds. Politically, it is unnecessary, at least, to condemn 'just' atheists, since these pose no threat to political stability. Similarly, on religious grounds it is both futile and unnecessary to persecute atheists. Atheism is ineradicable, since it is always springing up, as we have seen, among the young. Indeed, it has even been claimed that Plato himself had flirted with atheism in the earlier stages of his intellectual development. See Hiram J. McLendon's 'Plato without God', Journal of Religion, XXXIX (1959), pp. 88-101. By the same token, legal proscription of atheism is unnecessary, because it disappears spontaneously with maturity: Ί, who have met with many of these people, would declare this to you, that not a single man who from his youth has adopted this opinion, that the gods have no existence, has ever yet continued till old age constant in the same view.' (888bc) Atheism, then, would seem to pose a threat only to the epistemological framework supporting the ethic of practical reason. It is logically—indeed metaphysically—impossible for atheism to be accorded the status of principled belief, since in repudiating the theology of the Laws, the atheist has thereby denied the assumptions on which principled belief rests. His situation therefore is as untenable as that of a person who would claim to offer a logical refutation of th£ laws of logic. His belief is a form of madness or folly (908e) and, consequently, is undeserving of the respect due to principled belief. 84 Plato, Laws, 793ad. 85 Ibid., 792e. 86 Although the emotions present more of a problem for rational conduct than in the earlier dialogues, they have also assumed a more positive significance for the good life. Here, as in the contemporary Philebus (where pleasure is described as an indispensable condition for happiness, in the absence of which a life of pure contemplation would be unacceptable; 21e-22b), the emotions have acquired a vital importance. Happiness and pleasure are inextricably bound in a manner such as never before in Plato's thought. See, for instance, 732e-733a.</page><page sequence="23">DEITY &amp; HUMAN AGENCY IN PLATO'S LA WS 439 with his rational judgments.87 Man, then, must have a characterological, as well as a theological, framework: the soul requires its own constitution or proper order.88 Its appetites must be shaped by habit, conditioning, even by force, if man is not to be torn between principle and proclivity.89 Thus the state acquires ethical value as a formative medium. In ethics as in theology, nature requires art. The human physis must be shaped to accord with the soul's defining necessity, and this dictates the complete integration of experience. Rational man requires to be created by education in its broadest sense — not merely the logical arguments of a divinely appointed mentor, as in the Apology, but rather the tutelage that can only be imparted by the nomoi (the habits and folkways, shared reflexes of thought, feeling, and action, as well as the legal enactments) of a rationally constituted state. All sectors of experience must be concerted to foster that condition of right discipline in pleasures and pains which is the goal of education.90 The games of children, their physical activities, their singing and dancing must all become exercises in the formation of character's constitution.91 Even the drinking parties of the young men and the other leisurely pursuits of adulthood acquire educational (and thus political) significance.92 Education, then, cannot be delegated to the pedagogues.93 It must become the business of politics: the state is foremost a classroom.94 Law must give 87 Plato, Laws, 653ac. 88 'In a small way we imitate the procedure of the Divine Artist', as Macguire aptly describes this process, 'by organizing the "parts" of our soul in the interest of the whole; i.e., in such a way that the reason is in full control of "spirit" and "desire". Therby, we broaden and deepen the vulgar meanings of σωφροσύνη, δικαιοσύνη, etc., into functions of the internal organization of the soul;' 'Plato's Theory of Natural Law', p. 175. 89 Such dissonance of judgment and desire is man's 'greatest evil'. (689c) Also see 655d-656b. 90 Plato, Laws, 653bc. 91 Plato discusses these aspects of education throughout Bk. VII; see esp. 790c-791c, 795e-796e, 801e-803e. 92 For Plato's treatment of leisure, see 803ae and 806d-808d. He discusses drinking parties at 641ae and 671a-674c. 93 Despite his emphasis on education, Plato does not hold teachers in high regard. The pedagogue's task should be relegated to foreigners (804d); here Plato apparently reflects a broadly-shared view among contemporary Athenians 'that the task of a schoolmaster is no job for a gentleman'. Morrow, Plato's Cretan City, p. 326. 94 Thus the ministry of education is the most important office in the state (765e); it is to be filled by 'that one of the citizens who is in every way the most excellent'. 766b.</page><page sequence="24">440 Β. CAMPBELL formal sanction to the various techniques for establishing and maintaining the psychic constitution of practical reason. Magnesia must habituate the appetites of its citizens to the command of reason by joining persuasion with the coercive threat inherent in law, thereby imparting understanding by her instruction and, at the same time, compelling the ineducable.95 Similarly, the citizen's need for friendship and the concomitant importance he attaches to public opinion must be concerted by the state with his rational judgment,96 as must his respect for tradition.97 Yet while the state is elevated to a position of cardinal importance, its ethical value appears to remain instrumental. A sine qua non for the rational soul, it does not supplant the individual as moral subject, for while the dictate of law or rule-direction is stipulated by Book X, theology does not give content to political law.98 The discussion of the nomoi is throughout grounded in practical experience rather than in metaphysics. Plato's humility in this respect offers the most striking contrast to his metaphysical hubris in the Republic: political knowledge must now rest on inductive inquiry rather than transcendental 'vision'; the systematic, a priori method has been displaced by an empirical, ad hoc approach.99 The Lawgiver is no longer the metaphysical artist, described in the Republic, who, viewing the pattern of absolute truth, would wipe clean his mortal canvas and establish in 'this world also the laws of the beautiful, the just, and the good ...'.100 Now he resembles the less exalted bricklayer engaged in mere piecemeal construction.101 His task is not to create à nouveau but rather to assemble a composite from existing institutions.102 And this task can offer no claim to cosmic validity. After making the observation (which opens the entire discussion of law) that drinking parties 95 Plato, Laws, 721de-880de. 96 Ibid., 743cd. 97 Ibid., mac. 98 See Morrow's discussion in 'Plato and the Law of Nature', pp. 41-2. 99 Even the details of the education to be received by the Nocturnal Counsel cannot be prescribed α priori.

See also 500de. 101 Plato, Laws, 858b. 102 Thus the Athenian remarks of the public courts; 'there exist in many States quite a number of admirable ordinances of worthy men; and from these the Law-wardens must construct a code which is suitable to the polity we are now framing, partly by comparing and amending them, partly by submitting them to the test of experience, until each such ordinance be deemed satisfactory ...'. 957ab.</page><page sequence="25">DEITY &amp; HUMAN AGENCY IN PLATO'S LAWS 441 can play an important role in character formation, the Athenian is asked by Clinias to show how this statement is true. The Athenian's reply underscores Plato's intention here to base his construction on experiential wisdom — the mere 'opinion' defended in Meno — rather than metaphysics: 'The truth of my statement, which is disputed by many, is for God to assert; but I am quite ready to give, if required, in my own opinion, now that we have, in fact, embarked on a discussion of laws and constitutions.'103 This new orientation is apparent even at the outset of the Laws, for it is epitomized in the character of the participants, as well as in the form of the discussion. In contrast to the dramatis personae of Plato's earlier dialogues, the Athenian Stranger and his interlocutors are cast neither as eminent historical figures nor as personifications of influential doctrines. Their primary identification is rather with their native regions—Crete, Sparta, and Athens — which together embody the best of Greek political experience.104 Nor does the discussion take the eristic or the dialectical form of Plato's earlier works. There is no Socratic search for the contradiction or fallacy—no laying of logical traps—just as there is no search into the nature of the Good. The quest for political knowledge is indeed piecemeal and composite, a careful sifting of the experience embodied in the political institutions of the three regions.105 The priority of 'opinion' over metaphysical insight is also evident in the content of Plato's construction, for his new emphasis upon experiential wisdom is given institutional embodiment in two different ways. Magnesia is to send out its observers to all nations, where they will consult with the wiser element in order to improve Magnesia's laws and institutions; 'without this inspection and inquiry a state will not permanently remain perfect, nor again if the inspection be badly conducted.'106 Furthermore, this wisdom is embodied in the gérontocratie structure of Magnesian society. It is because of their greater experience in human affairs that the elderly are to be considered the 'best element' in the city.107 Indeed, the experience of age appears to carry 103 Plato, Laws, 641d. 104 See Morrow's excellent discussion of this point in Plato's Cretan City, pp. 3-95. 105 'Even where his political imagination is most apparent,' Morrow observes, 'his creations are developments of beliefs and practices already in existence'.

CAMPBELL the only claim to deference in the Laws, since the elderly are given the highest authority in all areas, domestic and educational, as well as political.108 It is true that, at least at one level, Plato has set for himself the task of creating a total and inflexible system of political law. Once the minor details have been settled and the laws 'have been finally approved, and have been sealed as absolutely unchangeable, then the magistrates shall put them into practice all their life long'.109 Here we seem to encounter an attitude of misoneism which collides with Plato's belief that 'all things that share in soul change, since they possess within themselves the cause of change'.110 Change in the law is evil because it erodes the foundation of common belief supporting ethical education and political stability. Since change alters not merely our conduct but our collective judgments of 'moral approval and disapproval'111, it raises doubts regarding the validity of our most fundamental principles (thus the atheists offer as evidence against belief in gods the fact that they are continually altered by legislation112. Yet Plato's views on this subject have been exaggerated by his critics. Although the political thinker would impose a rigid scheme of law upon Magnesia, the ethical theorist within Plato consistently reacts against this aim, qualifying, ever casting subjunctive shadows upon the stark legal imperatives of political stability. In the first place, Magnesia's legal code does in fact make provision for change. Plato is cautious in this respect, but he does stipulate procedures for change: 'if it should ever be thought that a necessity for change has arisen, all the people must be consulted, as well as all the officials, and they must seek advice from all the divine oracles; and if there is a general consent by all, then they may make a change, but under no other conditions at any time; and the objector to change shall always prevail according to law.'113 Viewed in the abstract, the obstacles to change posed here may seem so insurmountable as to confirm the charges regarding Plato's misoneism. But in the context of constitutional practice, Plato appears quite permissive in his 108 The elderly are not only supervisors of education, but educational models as well, for the children must be taught to derive pleasure and pain from 'the same things as the old man'; 659d. Moreover, the old men 'are likened to the reason because of their eminent wisdom in many matters of importance'. 965a. 109 Plato, Laws, 957b.

It is evident throughout the Laws that Plato no longer views citizens as passive clay for the lawgiver, as in the Republic. Now he is confronting an intelligent people whose expectations and traditions must give shape to the legal structure.115 Even the masses (although these still correspond to the appetitive element — that part of the soul which feels pleasure and pain116) are viewed as possessing a quality of native discernment and wisdom absent in Plato's earlier estimates.117 These must accept the laws willingly,118 just as they must consent to legal change. On every occasion in which Plato's legal ideal collides with the fundamental wishes of the populace, it is law that gives way.119 Indeed Plato makes it clear that he does not expect his legal code ever to gain full assent because it will never be accepted in its entirety by the citizens: 'all the arrangements now described will never be likely to meet with such favourable conditions that the whole programme can be carried out according to plan. This requires that the citizens will raise no objection to such a mode of living together . . Λ120 The legal fabric is, then, but an 'ideal', a full rendering of the Athenian's opinion.121 The extent to which this opinion will prevail remains an open question, subject only to 1,4 C. Hignett, A History of the Athenian Constitution to the End of the Fifth Century B. C. (Clarendon, 1975), pp. 299-300. Indeed, Plato's constitution seems no less liberal in this respect than our own. 115 See Vanhoutte's discussion, La Philosophie Politique, pp. 57-89. 116 Plato, Laws, 689b. 1,7 Thus Everyman is capable of distinguishing 'between the better men and the worse' (590bc), just as he is capable of careful deliberation, even as a youth: 'Every young man—not to speak of old men—on hearing or seeing anything unusual or strange, is likely to avoid jumping to a hasty and impulsive solution of his doubts about it, and to stand still. . .' 799cd. 118 Plato, Laws, 684c.

For instances of particular laws that will fail to gain assent, see 780cff, 838b-839d, as well as the law of inheritance, cited above. 1 Ibid., 746bc.</page><page sequence="28">444 Β. CAMPBELL considerations of feasibility ('how far their proposals are expedient and how much the legislation is impracticable'). There is no ethical obligation to accept these laws. The issue of legislation cannot be finally resolved because the state lacks the prima facie ethical validity it had possessed in the Republic. Political obedience is no longer subject to the architectonic manipulations of myth and noble lie.123 Now it is always occasion for moral casuistry—that extended and inconclusive process of detailed discussion we encounter everywhere in Laws — because social stability has become problematic in a manner unthinkable from the earlier perspective. In the Republic the requisites of socio-political order were necessarily binding upon the individual because the state was indisputably prior to its metaphysically defective inhabitants.124 There Plato had reminded potential dissidents that his interest lay not with the citizen (even the philosophic citizen) but with the whole: Callipolis 'creates such men in the state, not that it may allow each to take what course pleases him, but with a view to using them for the binding together of the commonwealth'.125 Now, however, the individual need not defer to the imperatives of stability, as is apparent in the conception of punishment adduced in the Laws. It is the conscientious individual himself who has the last word, for this new theory of punishment makes it evident that conscience has supplanted the Republic's scheme of political utility as final standard. Although punishment aims at the restoration of 'health', as in the earlier dialogues, health acquires new meaning. It is no longer conceived in relation to the individual's social function, as in Protagoras, Republic, and Statesman, but rather in terms of the integrity of his judgments. This integrity must be maintained at all cost, Plato asserts, even though it produces a measure of social disruption. He begins his analysis of punishment by distinguishing two separate features usually confused: 'injustice' and 'injury'.126 Injustice, which is to be the sole object of punishment, is exclusively a characterological state, a failure of reasonableness caused by the 'domination of passion and fear and 122 Ibid. 123 Here I refer to adult citizens. Plato does accept the use of gross hyperbole (although he does not resort to outright mendacity, as in the Republic) regarding the education of children. See 663d-664a, 951a. 124 Raphael Demos offers a cogent argument on this score in his 'Paradoxes in Plato's Doctrine of the Ideal State', Classical Quarterly, N.S., VII (1954), pp. 164-74. 125 Plato, Republic, 520a. 126 Plato, Laws, 862ac.</page><page sequence="29">DEITY &amp; HUMAN AGENCY IN PLATO'S LAWS 445 pleasure and pain and envies and desires in the soul, whether they do any injury or not'.127 Thus the proper function of punishment is to restore the deranged soul to its healthy or reasonable condition. Injury, on the other hand, is based on considerations of political utility, and is to be remedied by reparation, rather than by punishment. That injustice and injury are distinct is demonstrated by their functional independence. Just as the unreasonable soul remains unjust even though no injury results, so can the reasonable man cause injury without injustice.128 The touchstone of justice, and hence of punishment, is that of reasoned conviction, 'the belief in the highest good — in whatsoever way either States or individuals think they can attain to it'.129 The result of this analysis would seem to indicate that the ethical theorist has prevailed over the political thinker within Plato, for he explicitly takes the part of conscience130 over that of stability: 'if this [belief] prevails in their souls and regulates every man, even if some damage be done, we must assert that everything thus done is iust. . .'. Thus it would appear that the individual's ethical identity can no more be submerged within the political than within the divine order. In grounding his metaphysics in soul as a self-activating force, rather than in a transcendent reality, Plato has rendered impossible the tendency, so pronounced in the Republic, to view the state as a higher embodiment of metaphysical values. Man is himself the centre of his ethical universe. Only he can propose the aims that are to direct his life: whatsoever be the way in which a member of our community — be he of the male or female sex, young or old, — may become a good citizen, possessed of the excellence of soul which belongs to man, whether derived from some pursuit or disposition, or from some form of diet, or from desire or opinion or mental study, — to the attainment of this end all his efforts throughout the whole of his life shall be directed; and not a '"Ibid., 863e. 128 Ibid., 861e-862b. 129 Ibid., 863e-864e. 130 This is the commonly accepted view.

CAMPBELL single person shall show himself preferring any object which impedes this aim...132 If the state claims superiority over the individual, it can do so only by virtue of its superior force. It cannot claim to embody a higher order of reality or value, for in the Laws there can be no higher order than that of the soul. Conclusion Again I must emphasize that the purpose of this essay has been to suggest only that Plato's theology in Laws stipulates human agency as the highest ethical norm. I have not addressed the question of whether, in the final analysis, this agency is allowed to prevail among the citizens of Magnesia. It may well be true that in Plato's estimate psychological considerations (wide spread impairment of the rational faculty, for instance) render ethical choice impracticable, or that political exigencies make it undesirable. I have sought only to demonstrate that if this is true, it is in no way entailed by the theology, metaphysics, or ethics of the Laws, as had been the case in the Republic. This seemingly negative conclusion is itself significant, however, for it does carry a positive implication of the utmost importance: Plato appears to be suggesting—probably for the first time in his career (perhaps, indeed, for the first time in western history) — that the ethical and political realms do not require unquestioned submission to a divine agent or a revealed scheme of transcendental truth, that human choice and action can be predicated upon man's own sense of purpose. Although it remains true, in a sense, that ethical values are grounded in the ultimate order of things, as in the Republic, these values are of such a nature as to require independent validity for human interests. Metaphysics itself now entails an anthropocentric conception of the mortal world. If there are compelling reasons to deny man his metaphysical prerogative of acting upon his own choice, these must be defended on other grounds. And here the burden of proof must be considerably more onerous than has been suDDOsed. Blair Campbell UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES ! Ibid., 770cd.</page></plain_text>
