No. 2 DECEMBER 1965 DINGO AND HORNED ANTHROPOMORPH IN AN ABORIGINAL ROCK SHELTER By N. W. G. Macintosh* Preface SANDSTONE outcrop 60 metres long in an approximate north-south axis on the south-eastern slopes of Mount Manning, some 64 miles north of Sydney contains three rock shelters. Six dark red ochre paintings in the Southern Shelter comprise a male and female anthropomorph each with cephalic cornua, a male and female dingo, a male and a female echidna. This ritual group is deduced, from radiocarbon analysis of charcoal associated with matching ochre in the floor deposit, to have been painted in approximately a.D. 1400. In the Northern Shelter, successive series of paintings in light red ochre, char- coal and white, depicting mainly the local fauna and some hand stencils, are similarly deduced to have been painted between A.D. 1750 and A.D. 1830. To the best of the writer's knowledge, these are the first Aboriginal rock paintings to have been dated in Australia. Geographical Description The rock shelters, which this paper describes, are situated on the lower south- eastern slopes of Mount Manning whose summit is 900 ft. above sea level. The nearest village is Kulnura which is 56-5 miles by road north of the G.P.O., Sydney. The rock shelters are 8*5 miles in a direct line across country and on a bearing of 3270 from Kulnura, but to reach them by car-road and then bush-track involves a circuitous route of 17 miles from Kulnura. Their position is 1510 6' 30" east, 33° 8' 30" south and map reference is Sheet 403, Zone 8, 1 13033. They are 320 ft. above sea level, and 80 ft. above the bed of a creek which runs from north to south * Professor of Anatomy, University of Sydney. A</page><page sequence="2">86 DINGO AND HORNED ANTHROPOMORPH IN A ROCK SHELTER and forms one of numerous tributaries of Mangrove Creek. The valley is narrow and its sides precipitous ; the Military Survey Map of the region describes the vegetation as " rain forest ". The Geological Map, 1961, issued by the Bureau of Mineral Resources, Department of Supply, Sydney, indicates Hawkesbury sand- stones, shales, and lateritic capping at elevations of 750 ft. ; a low grade type of iron deposit is locally widespread and commonly percolates down cracks and joints ; the caps demonstrate advanced leeching and pisolitic, limonitic and ferric profiles occur. Twelve or more additional caves can be found in the sandstone outcrops exposed on both sides of the valley within 500 metres of our map reference. Apart from the one set here described, all are sterile of evidence of Aboriginal occupation, although most of them in terms of larger size, level rock floors, smoother and more uniformly vertical walls, easier access and entrance, would appear much superior for shelter or cooking or painting or occupation generally than those which do contain paintings and floor deposit. The latter shelters consist of three irregularly scooped out caves in a single almost vertical outcrop some 60 metres long on the western side of the valley. The long axis of this outcrop is on a bearing of 3400 (see inset plan in Plate I). It presents three caves immediately adjacent to one another ; the northern one is about 17 metres long, the middle one is 6 metres long and sterile, the southern one is 12 metres long ; henceforth, this paper will refer to the " Northern Shelter " and the " Southern Shelter ". Description of the Painted Shelters Their roof overhang has almost the same dimension as the floor ; the platform outside the cave floors is only one to three metres wide, beyond which is a steep drop to the valley bed. The long axes of the Northern and Southern Shelters have bearings of 3450 and 3300 respectively ; the main paintings in the Southern Shelter face along a bearing of 580, but in general terms the paintings and the apertures of the caves face eastwards. Height from rock floor to roof is variable from 1-5 to 3 metres. The walls and roof in the Southern Shelter are irregular ; in the main they are markedly concave, but in places are concavo-convex, while the rock floor or shelf slopes 350 from the horizontal plane (see Plate II). The inner aspect of the lipping of the roof overhang exhibits seolian honey-combing, periodically fre- quented by a variety of small birds. The six most impressive paintings (see Plates II and IV) are on the back wall of this Southern Shelter alcove. As can be seen from Plate II, recording presents difficulty because of the smooth sloping floor-shelf ; the recorder had to be braced in position by an assistant. The largest of these paintings measures 1-4 x 1-4 metres, and can be seen in Plate II, immediately above and behind the hat of the recorder. The Aboriginal artist similarly must have had considerable difficulty in painting these figures ; success in design and draughtmanship is much harder to achieve on a concave and, in places, undulant surface ; additionally he had to deal with the relatively cramped space and with his own lack of stability and purchase on the sloping shelf ; assistants must have been employed to maintain the artist</page><page sequence="3">DINGO AND HORNED ANTHROPOMORPH IN A ROCK SHELTER 87 in position. It must surely be significant that such a difficult and excessively secluded alcove should have been elected for these large and impressive paintings, when other shelters nearby presented so much easier conditions of flat walls and floor, and rock faces of finer grain. In this alcove the grain of the rock face is very coarse. Below the rock shelf and towards the northern extremity of the Southern Shelter is a platform of floor deposit 3 metres wide, and extending northward is an external plain rock surface with a few paintings. The Northern Shelter is more open and roomy, and its floor is covered by a shallow deposit. Some alcoves and shelving occur in its southern limits and paintings have been made on the back walls of these alcoves and on the under surface of the shelves. So that here again areas presenting some difficulty were elected by the artists. The roof of the Northern Shelter was apparently extensively blackened by fire smoke originally. Large patches have now flaked off, the roof is cracked in two places and in storms, water drips through and frets away the rock. The entire outcrop and shelters become very damp in wet weather. Situated well down the steep slope of the western wall of a deep and narrow ravine, concealed by tall timber and masked by dense scrub, these shelters are penetrated by direct sunlight only in the early morning. These conditions together with the rugged and uninhabited terrain constitute an ideal retreat for native fauna.. On each occasion of revisit to the shelters, the floor deposits showed fresh tracks of large and small birds, goanna, lizard, wallaby, wombat and snake. Wallabies were seen and heard several times, goannas were seen occasionally, a black snake once, lizards often ; there are eels in the creek at the bottom of the ravine, and bird life is rich. Putative Recent History Timber getters have operated in these hills for some 60 or 70 years. A timber drag-track follows a contour of Mount Manning some 200 ft. higher than the rock shelters and ends at an old camp and some obsolete snigging apparatus, so the locality is not as virgin as it might seem. The Deane family still live some four miles south-west of Mount Manning ; Mr. Matthew Deane was guiding Messrs. W. J. Enright, Goddard and Greenwell to aboriginal engravings in this and adjacent regions in 1936 (see Mankind 1937). It is almost certain that the late Mr. Frank Bell and the late Mr. Carlyle Grenwell saw these shelters in approximately 1938. Colour photographs in the possession of Mr. Ian Sim, taken by someone con- siderably prior to the present writer's introduction to the shelters, reveal a yellow outline, presumably chalk, added to some of the six main figures in the Southern Shelter. On the day preceding the Author's first introduction to the shelters, practically all the paintings had been roughly outlined with white chalk, and the chalker had added his Surname and abbreviated Given name together with the date (23/9/1961) in three places on the walls. The floor deposit in the Northern Shelter was ultimately determined by the present writer to be remaniement, in at least 80% of its extent. But the deposit at the northern end of the Southern Shelter was quite intact and undisturbed.</page><page sequence="4">88 DINGO AND HORNED ANTHROPOMORPH IN A ROCK SHELTER Apart from chalk, the walls of the shelters have survived almost unscathed; in the middle of the back wall of the Southern Shelter is an indeterminate scratched outline, possibly made with a stone, and does not suggest aboriginal origin. Chalk does not appear to be as damaging in these shelters as it has been elsewhere, for example in the great cave at Mootwingee in Far Western New South Wales where many figures have been ruined by repetitive chalk outlining. But in the present shelters the yellow chalk, (mentioned as seen in the photographs possessed by Mr. Sim), is no longer visible ; and the white chalk applied apparently on 23/9/61 was successfully removed (without disturbance to the six red ochre major paintings in the Southern Shelter), by Milner, Williams, Miss Scot Skirving and the writer in the course of five visits to the Shelters over a period of five weeks. In Plate II, the white chalk outline can be seen round four of the painted figures on the wall behind the two recorders ; in Plates III and IV, it can be seen that the chalk has been almost totally eradicated. Light slapping with dry cloth, light brushing with dry clothes brushes and dry tooth brushes patiently repeated over a long period achieved almost total success ; subsequently the technique used by Henri Lhote to record the Tassili Sahara paintings, that is to damp down and freshen up the entire groups with rubber sponges and water, was successfully employed, and the last of the chalk extirpated. Incidentally this permitted the most successful photo- graphic results out of many scores of attempts. The damp sponges freshened up and intensified the colour of the red figures and provided the extra and necessary contrast with the cave walls to permit the results shown in Plates III and IV. The Aboriginal charcoal drawings which had been outlined in chalk could not be treated in any way, because unlike the red ochre which is very permanent and stained into the rock to a depth of some 3 mms., the charcoal brushes off fairly easily. Another cave is located on a tributary of Wyong Creek. It is 9-3 miles in a direct line south-east from the Mount Manning site and is 1-25 miles from Kulnura on a bearing of 8o°. Its Map Reference is Sheet 403, Zone 8, 249942 ; it is 750 ft. above sea level and 30 ft. above the creek bed. Some forty names or comments or dates and much outlining in chalk and pencil obscure the Aboriginal paintings ; the earliest date which could be deciphered among these defacements was 1907. Its floor deposit has been totally disturbed by campers and it is impossible to differentiate Aboriginal from European fireplaces. By comparison, the Mount Manning shelters are relatively undefiled. Nevertheless this putative history is sufficient to indicate that caution is necessary in adjudicating the authenticity of data obtained from these shelters. Description of the Paintings Metrical survey, 19/10/1961 and 1/11/1961, produced the first recording of the paintings. Photographic survey, 1/2/1962, produced the second recording. Neither compensated for distortions due to rock face curvature and oblique angles of ex- posure. The complete series of items (except for two Nos. 21, 22, on the roof of the Northern Shelter) were therefore recorded by polythene tracings, which are reproduced to scale in Plate I.</page><page sequence="5">DINGO AND HORNED ANTHROPOMORPH IN AN ABC 6 SCALE Ol »1 Si 3I 4] 5J 15 16 17 # 29#;a,3o 24 26 ~' 26» Btn REO • - *%/.^^&gt; +'£* 32 ir--*- 3 Btn REO • - v&gt;^. ^ ;r ,. +'£* WHITE • 35A • ■^:^^^v^i;4i,^^ii); ,;.;v •%;j;»;/^-:.-"vrV---' ■■■"■•.',:: y,«'1:« • ,-.:iAv- 35b Plate I Reproductions to standard scale from polythene tracings of the entire series.

Photograph by Gordon Williams.</page><page sequence="10">DINGO AND HORNED ANTHROPOMORPH IN A ROCK SHELTER 89 Items 1-6 are completely infilled silhouettes; the colour is burgundy red or Munsell 5R4/8. The rock surface is coarse and ridged ; a lot of ochre must have gone into the painting of these large items ; apparently the outlines were sketched first, then the filling was scrubbed in by bold diagonal sweeps ; some vertical, horizontal and circular strokes were employed also. These directional trends of brush work were either traced or rubbed on the polythene and have reproduced adequately in Plate I. Comparison can be made with the photographs in Plates III and IV. The artist made three mistakes in his preliminary outlines ; he appears to have tried to erase a wrongly positioned tail on the dingo in item 5 ; but he made no attempt to correct the false outline of the left kneecap and right foot of item 6. The artist was un- concerned with detail ; the right hand has six fingers, the left four, the right foot has seven toes and the left six in item 6 ; item 2 has four fingers on the right hand, five on the left, five toes on the left foot and an indefinite fringe of strokes on the right foot to represent toes. Each motif is naturalistic but also very successfully impressionistic. Item 2 is obviously female because of the well denned vulva ; item 6 is obviously male. The wide roomy torso and diminutive legs on item 2 are in marked contrast with the more elongated trunk and the powerful legs of item 6. Items 2 and 6 convey their impressions of female and male respectively, quite apart from the genital criteria. Neither of the dingoes, items 1 and 5, have overt sex identification, but there can be no doubt that No. 1 represents a female and No. 5 a male. Not quite so obvious, but by implication because of the revelation of other items, Nos. 3 and 4 must be female and male echidna respectively. The problem is to put a label on items 2 and 6. Item 6, apart from his excessively truncated arms and the two horns on his head, is fairly similar to the outline rock engraving of Baiarne at Mount Kuringgai. Item 2 has two white double eyes ; item 6 also has eyes, but less pro- minently white painted. These eyes were suspect for a time. They had been chalked over. After removal of the chalk, one's suspicions remained until it was observed that white pipe clay vertical lines were faintly present on the face, neck, torso, and arms of item 2. These pipe-clay stripes are of identical substance to the pipe clay eyes (chips examined microscopically) : Like the red ochre, the white is bound to the rock texture ; it is therefore accepted as genuine. There is no sugges- tion of nose or mouth. This plus the vertical stripes on Item 2 is reminiscent of the Wandjina portrayals. The horns are certainly not elongated ears, which are sometimes featured in Aboriginal art and they are not stylised representations of hair or headdress; they are reminiscent of the Lightning Brothers of Delamere, but there is certainly no close similarity in the cornuate projections ; it is the idea which is reminiscent, not the portrayal. The horned rainbow serpent similarly has analogy. When I showed Plates III and IV to the late Mr. W. E. (Bill) Harney, he immediately associated these cornuate figures with the Nindjeri, the men of the storms, the gecko men associated with rain and lightning and fertility. The problem can be left there for the moment ; there is sufficient collateral analogy and more than sufficient impressionism to accept items 2 and 6 as anthropomorphs of ritual significance.</page><page sequence="11">90 DINGO AND HORNED ANTHROPOMORPH IN A ROCK SHELTER Items 7-9 present a problem ; they are inefficient, incomplete poor quality copies of the splendid ritual group 1 to 6 ; items 7 and 8 suggest incomplete dingoes drawn in charcoal and red outline and item 9 is not only a clumsy copy of either 2 or 6, but is also largely linear in its brush work and the ochre, being Munsell 8R3/4, matches neither that of the ritual group nor that of the red paintings in the Northern Shelter which are 2YR5/7. (It is mentioned at this point, that a number of indeterminate marks and faded daubs which were originally included in the re- cording, have been removed from the final recording. It does not help final inter- pretation, and it does confuse main issues, if minutiae which may or may not be aboriginal are recorded and referred to. Items 7-9 are the only exceptions to this decision ; one can speculate on whether they are profane copies of a forgotten tradition, and so on, but this does not help understanding of the broader issues.) Items 10, 11 and 12 represent a wallaby or kangaroo, a snake and an eel. They are charcoal drawings rather than paintings and the technique of their exe- cution is similar in every other charcoal drawing in the gallery. These three items are outside the Southern Shelter and on the outer face of a vertical wall connecting the shelters. Further along the same surface, a recession beneath a shelf occurs and on the under surface are two quite graceful figures, items 13 and 14, of wallabies or kangaroos ; the charcoal strokes are simple and apparently careless, and details of the fore and hind limbs are largely ignored. The naturalistic effect is nevertheless achieved and to a more effective degree than is exhibited by the static convention- alised pose of the wallaby in item 10. Items 15-19 are human hands stencilled in white ; three are rights, one is left, and one shows only the finger tips because the original rock has crumbled away. Item 20 is a further stencil in white of a left hand on the smoke blackened roof. Items 21-22 are fusiform elongated plain outlines in red on the roof of the Northern Shelter ; they probably represent shields. Items 23 to 26B comprise eight snakes all in light red ochre, Munsell 2YR5/7. Five of these are in simple outline, but three have elaborate heads, and of these, one has thirty four vertical infilling stripes on its body. Item 27 is an interesting motif which is repeated in item 36 and in item 41. It is a triangular infilled red motif, with an oblique base, a concave and a convex side which meet at a curved pointed apex. This is unique in the present writer's experience ; could it represent a spear point or a Bondi point ? Items 29 to 33 comprise a red eel with well defined gills or cephalic fins (31) ; a red line leads from the mouth of the eel to a very small man infilled in red ochre (34) and he has a single cornu on the vertex of his head ; is this cornuate figure an attenuated heritage from an earlier more heroic tradition ? An intriguing thought. Superimposed on the red eel and line is a replica in charcoal (32) ; the only difference is that the line ends in a diffuse tangle beyond the little cornuate man. Super- imposed on the charcoal eel is a white eel which is twice as long and has no gills or fins defined (28). Superimposed on the head end of the white eel is a white</page><page sequence="12">DINGO AND HORNED ANTHROPOMORPH IN A ROCK SHELTER 91 stencilled right hand. Items 29 and 30 (the latter an inexact duplication upon itself) are undoubtedly birds of some kind, possibly emu. Beneath the shelf roof of an alcove some 86 cms. in height is a complex series (35 A) consisting of a graceful sigmoid shaped eel with elongated fins drawn in charcoal ; coiled once round the body of the eel is a charcoal line which runs over (is super- imposed upon) a red infilled eel which tapers at the head and more so at its tail, but is swollen in the middle of the body ; immediately above this is a slender white snake and some charcoal lines. Item 35B appears to be out of character with the rest of the gallery ; this complex occurs in the back wall of the cave, immediately above its junction with the floor and is situated in an elongated niche which is only 45 cms. in height. It is an awkward place to apply paintings and still more awkward to trace with polythene. It consists of multiple charcoal stripes, mostly vertical, but some are diagonal and fork or branch. Superimposed on these, are curvilinear white lines which sometimes can be traced as forming a net-like arrangement, and in one or two places vaguely suggest the outline of a wallaby and an emu. Perhaps they do represent nets for trapping fauna, perhaps they are mazes, or perhaps they are stylised or symbolised semantics and if so they are the only such representatives in these galleries. Item 37 is an eel in charcoal and 38 is a superimposed replica in white ; similarly item 40 is a superimposed white replica of item 39, a charcoal kangaroo, in an almost erect static posture. Items 42-45 are situated on a section of the wall which is apparently more porous and also presents some cracking ; it is usually damp and sometimes frankly wet. The colours have run considerably and obscured some of the definition. The group consists of a wallaby in white outline superimposed on another in white outline but almost obliterated, superimposed upon a red infilled eel of which the definition of the head is obscure ; this in turn is superimposed upon an enormous red out- lined eel with two transverse red bands across its body. A boomerang drawn in white outline overlays the red outline of the eel. Summarising the paintings, it appears that items 10 to 45 represent a con- vention which is narrowly circumscribed in medium, style, technique and quality. The subjects represented are the local fauna. The slavish duplication, exact or inexact, in the same colour, or in successive different colours, further suggests that the tradition was trammelled. As originals or as duplications, there are represented 10 snakes, 10 eels, 7 wallabies or kangaroos, 7 stencilled hands, 3 emus ?, 3 fish lines, 2 shields, 1 boome- rang, 1 cornuate man, and of course the curvilinear maze. This is a limited range of subjects ; the accent is obviously on food and the obtaining of it, whether by fishing or hunting or trapping. It is very much a secular gallery, and one with a restricted menu ; the present local fauna includes a wider larder of goanna, wombat, possum, koala, bandicoot,</page><page sequence="13">92 DINGO AND HORNED ANTHROPOMORPH IN A ROCK SHELTER etc., etc., in addition to the snakes, eels, wallabies shown in the paintings. The colour superimpositions are absolutely uniform ; there are no exceptions ; the sequence is white over white over white over black over red infilled over red out- lined. It is appropriate at this stage to make a comparison with the paintings in the Wyong Creek rock shelter, 9*3 miles directly to the south-east. In this latter shelter, the medium, style, technique and quality is similar, in fact almost identical with items 10-45 in the Mount Manning Northern Shelter, but the range of subjects depicted is rather different. There are 47 stencilled hands, 2 stencilled arms, 1 stencilled foot, 3 stencilled hafted axes, 7 stencilled boomerangs of three types, a stencilled shield, 1 stencilled triangular object, 8 wallabies or kangaroos, 1 wombat, 3 goannas, 3 lizards, 2 snakes, 2 eels, 1 platypus, 2 echidna, and 2 examples of the red dart-like motif (as in items 36, 27, 41 of the Mount Manning Shelter). There are also 4 axe sharpening grooves. The superimpositions are again white over white over black multiple super- impositions on black over red infill over red outline. But yellow is added to the colour range ; yellow is apparently co-existent with white, being sometimes on and sometimes under white. Essentially the difference between the Mount Manning Mangrove Creek site and this Wyong Creek site is the predominance of stencils in the latter and a wider range of representation of local fauna. There can scarcely be any doubt that the art schools expressed in these two sites are contemporary. There is no hint or suggestion in this Wyong Creek shelter of the ritual tradition exhibited in the Southern Shelter at Mount Manning, and which, as will be shown subsequently, belongs to a period some four hundred years earlier. Southern Shelter At its northern extremity a platform some three metres wide presented a surface of yellow sand. On 6/10/1961 one square metre was excavated to rock bottom. The depth was only 30 cms., but it was obviously and indeed strikingly stratified and completely undisturbed. The deposit was removed in 3-0 cm. layers and sieved. Between 4-0 and 6-75 cms. a light red powdery stratum occurred. Between 24-0 and 27-0 cms. depth was a dark red stratum. 103 grams of charcoal were collected in a glass jar labelled Ai from 27-0 to 28-0 cms. depth where a closed fire hearth was located. The following was the stratification observed (see Plates I and V) : 0 Surface of deposit ; yellow sand. 1 Greyish yellow soil. 3*7 Charcoal; Geochron radiocarbon: A.D. 1806, A.D. 1830. 4*0 Light red ochre; Munsell 2 YR 5/7; match Northern Shelter paintings. 6 «75 Charcoal.</page><page sequence="14">DINGO AND HORNED ANTHROPOMORPH IN AN ABORIGINAL ROCK SHELTER. PLATE V Plate V Excavation of 30-0 cms. depth of undisturbed floor deposit. Note patchy distribution of superficial layer of light red ochre at levels of 4 • o to 6 • 75 cms. below the surface ; and of deeper layer of dark red ochre at 24*0 to 27*0 cms. From this layer a red ochre nodule measuring 4 x 3*5*3 cms. was recovered ; three of its eight sides are " rub-polished." Radio-carbon age of charcoal immediately above the upper layer of ochre is 1806 a.D., 1830 a.d. ; and of charcoal immediately below the lower ochre layer is 1369 a.d. (Geochron, U.S.A.) It is deduced that occupancy of the rock shelters began in about 1350 a.d. ; the ritual group of paintings in the southern shelter date about 1400 a.d. and the paintings in the northern shelter about 1 750-1 800 a.d.</page><page sequence="15">DINGO AND HORNED ANTHROPOMORPH IN A ROCK SHELTER 93 7*0 Yellow sand. 8'0 Grey soil. 11 -o Charcoal. 12-0 Yellow grey soil. 15*0 Charcoal. 15-5 Grey soil. 17 'O Charcoal. 17*5 Grey soil. 23 'O Charcoal. 24*0 Dark red ochre; Muriseli 5 R 4/8; match Southern Shelter paintings. 27-0 Charcoal - closed hearth; Geochron radiocarbon: A.D. 1369. 28*0 Charcoal and dark soil. 30*0 Rock bottom. Subsequently (25/10/1961 and 26/1/1962) another two excavations, each of one square metre, adjacent to the southern edge of the first excavation, were re- moved in approximately 1 cm. layers with very small trowels and sieved. Strati- fication was similar in every way, the two ochre layers, as in the previous excavation, being patchy, rather than a continuous entity. 112 grams of charcoal were collected in glass jar A2 from the 27*0 to 28*0 cm. depth. 57 and 30 grams of charcoal were collected in two glass jars Bi and B2 from a 3-7 to 4*0 cm. stratum immediately above the light red ochre. Jar Bi charcoal was from the inner section of the exca- vation, Jar B2 charcoal from the outer section. The charcoal from the inner portion was damp, and charcoal from the outer region, less protected by the roof overhang, was wet ; sand and flecks of red ochre adhered to some of the charcoal of both Bi and B2. Although sieved meticulously with fine mesh, no implements, nor waste flakes, bone nor shell were found. The Ochre Layers in the Deposit In the Northern Shelter, one limited area of the light red type was located, (15/6/63) ; its colour matches the superficial light red stratum in the Southern Shelter. In the cave east of Kulnura two small similar patches (disturbed) of light red ochre were found in the floor deposit (13/4/1963), which also matched the super- ficial light red stratum of the Mount Manning Southern Shelter. The dark red deeper stratum is Munsell 5 R4/8 ; the superficial stratum is 2 YR 5/7. These readings match those of the paintings in the Southern and Northern Shelters respectively. The readings on the paintings vary a little depending on climatic conditions, i.e. if a dry clear day, or if raining or overcast, etc. ; similarly the ochre varies a little depending on whether it is wet or dry. A proper grain size analysis has not been made, nor a chemical determination. However in the meantime I thank Dr. T. G. Vallance of the Department of Geology</page><page sequence="16">94 DINGO AND HORNED ANTHROPOMORPH IN A ROCK SHELTER and Geophysics, University of Sydney, for a brief visual examination and comment on the material (12/7/63), to the effect that it was characteristically local to the region, and could reasonably be supposed the source of pigment employed by the Aborigines. I also thank Edmund D. Gill, Assistant Director, National Museum of Victoria, who made a brief microscopic examination of the material (17/6/64) and commented that it consisted of silica sand and silt and a little clay ; grain size is bimodal, i.e. sand size and silt size ; the sand fraction in turn is of two types - sharp edged grains and well rounded grains, and all grains have a thin coat (some incomplete) of red clay ; the red colour is doubtless due to iron oxide. Material from the deeper stratum differs from that of the superficial stratum only in demon- strating coarser sand and more iron oxide. In the deeper stratum a solitary red ochre nodule measuring 4-0 x 3*5 X 3#o cms. was recovered ; it is roughly eight-sided and three of the sides are " rub- polished ". This nodule also has not been submitted to analysis ; but it is Munsell 5 R 4/8 ; it was applied (by the present writer) for rubbing directly onto an area of 10 sq. cms. on the largest painting in the Southern Shelter. The colour matched precisely; this application brushed off again relatively easily. Some haematitic sandstone masses lying in the shelters were brought back to the University, fragmented and ground up. The resulting product resembled what was obtained from the strata in the excavation. It is speculating to some extent to suggest that the Aborigines broke up and produced a ground red powder in a similar way, and then mixed this powder with some juice or sap which formed a durable and penetrating adhesive for their paintings. By chipping, some minute flakes were removed from the larger paintings in the Southern Shelter; it can be noted first, that under the microscope, their colour is similar to that from the deeper deposit of ochre, when the two materials are compared side by side ; secondly these minute flakes had to be chipped to a depth of at least 1 mm. and in some places 3 mms. before unstained rock was exposed. Northern Shelter This shelter has a level floor, is roomier and has plenty of head space. It is understandable that campers would use this rather than the Southern Shelter. It would not need many campers to disturb the shallow deposit. In any case, no stratification could be found anywhere. The entire deposit had been churned about and dug into, probably many times. Near the margin of the back wall, at the junction of the northern two thirds and the southern one third an undisturbed patch of light red ochre was found, measuring 0*5 x 0*4 metres and 1-5 cms. thick. A trench was dug and sieved transversely across the middle of the deposit. In the middle of the trench a pothole in the rock floor gave a maximum depth from the surface of the deposit of 75 cms. Two Bondi points (quartz) were recovered from the bottom of the pothole. 25 lbs. of deposit from the bottom of the trench was collected in a calico sack and subsequently processed in the Department of</page><page sequence="17">DINGO AND HORNED ANTHROPOMORPH IN A ROCK SHELTER 95 Anatomy, by extracting 238 grams of charcoal fragments with forceps ; this was placed in glass Jar labelled C. Leaves, twigs, root fibres, fragments of fresh water snail shells, fragments of long bones of small animals and birds, some 20 very small waste flakes were separated out from the 25 lbs. of deposit. An area 1x2 metres, southward from the trench, was then dug and sieved ; the product was more or less similar and again no stratification was observed. Ultimately over a period of several visits the entire deposit of the Northern Shelter was sieved. It was con- cluded it would be quite pointless to seek a radiocarbon analysis from Sample C because of the ransacked character of the deposit and also because of the gross intrusion of leaves, twigs, rootlets, etc. which probably represented various grades of contamination to the charcoal. The Total Product of the Northern Shelter Deposit Implements Bondi point, milky quartz, i-8 x 0-7 x 0-5 cms. A Bondi point, milky quartz, tip broken off, present size i-8 X i-o x o-6 cms. A bi-faced implement, lentiformi in cross section, tapering to a blunt nosed end ; it has an almost straight base, and is trimmed by retouch flaking round its entire margin ; chert ; 3 x 1 -5 X o -9 cms. Some gum is present on the blunt nosed end indicating the implement has been hafted, which means the base must have been used as an adze-edge ; (the hafting gum was first noticed by Alan Thorne, Department of Anatomy, University of Sydney). One face is completely flaked, the reverse face possesses a keel and flaking occurs longitudinally on half this face. Two microlithic cores, one milky quartz, one quartzite, each 2-5 x 2-0 cms. One chert flake 5x3 cms. with platform and bulb. One large flake from a fine grained diorite river pebble. Ten quartz river pebbles and four broken ones. Indeterminate, medium size waste flakes (20 of milky quartz, 6 of finegrained quartzite), and 40 minute flakes of chert and quartzite. Fauna Three portions of separate wallaby jaws, 9 pieces of wallaby long bones, an immature wallaby scapula, carapace and claws of freshwater crayfish, upper and lower crab chelae, six freshwater snail shells, 50 very small or minute fragments of vertebrae, jaws, long bones, flat bones ; (4 were avian, the rest could not be identi- fied). Practically all the recognisable bone fragments are from immature animals ; noted first by Alan Thorne). This extremely meagre assemblage indicates that the Northern Shelter was not a workshop nor a feeding place save in the most desultory fashion. On the other hand, the heavily smoke blackened roof and the very high proportion of charcoal in the deposit (even allowing that some part of this is of European pro- duction) indicates Aboriginal gatherings and perhaps sleeping round fire hearths. The Middle Shelter is quite sterile.</page><page sequence="18">96 DINGO AND HORNED ANTHROPOMORPH IN A ROCK SHELTER The Southern Shelter apparently was exclusively identified with ochre and some fire, and the shelter with its impressive ritualistic paintings must have had only limited intrusion. Radiocarbon Age Determination On 19/7/1963, 41 grams of charcoal from the 3*7 to 4*0 cm. stratum immediately above the light red ochre layer, and 50 grams of charcoal from the 27-0 to 28*0 cm. stratum (closed hearth) immediately below the dark red layer were submitted as Samples No. 12 and No. 13, respectively, to Geochron Labs. Inc., Cambridge 39, Mass., U.S.A. Geochron gave these Sample Nos. GX-0069 and GX-0070, respectively. Results were delivered 8/11/1963 : Age GX-0069: 144 ± 125 (a.D. 1806) 120 ± 155 (a.D. 1830) GX-0070: 581 ± 120 (a.d. 1369) Dr. H. W. Kreuger added the comment : " The dates appear to agree with the limited stratigraphie information in your description ". My statement suggested that as the deep and the superficial charcoal samples had been carefully collected and from archaeologically undisturbed context and were free from contamination, the analyses should be valid ; and I expected an hiatus between the samples, not only because of their relative levels but also because the dark red paintings of the Southern Shelter appeared to belong to an older and different art style, from the more recent looking Northern Gallery which equated with that of the cave east of Kulnura. On 23/6/1964, Dr. Kreuger sent me a further letter, saying : " The charcoal dates (GX-0069 and GX-0070) have a slightly higher statistical error than some dates, but I do not think this should alter any interpretation. The errors reported for C-14 dates are 67% probability limits based upon the counts only. They do not take into account initial variations or inherent errors . . . With larger samples, the error might be slightly less, but for really increasing the precision, a number of dates on separate samples of definite correlation would probably be best. I doubt if any amount of work would get you closer than ± 40 years ". I thank Miss Anne Bermingham, Institute of Applied Science of Victoria, for discussing these results with me and for pointing out, that as the dates themselves are 450 years apart, adjusting each of them by one sigma towards each other would still give a difference in the order of 200 years ; so that even allowing for unavoidable effects of de Vries, initial variation, and inherent errors, an hiatus is still reasonably indicated. While ample charcoal is available for repeat check analyses, this hardly seems necessary in view of the comments by Dr. Kreuger and by Miss Bermingham.</page><page sequence="19">DINGO AND HORNED ANTHROPOMORPH IN A ROCK SHELTER 97 Summary, Discussion and Tentative Conclusions A Rock Shelter Complex on the south-eastern slopes of Mount Manning, some 60 miles north of Sydney, consists of a Southern Shelter and a Northern Shelter, each containing Aboriginal paintings. These paintings are divisible into two art traditions ; the earlier is represented by a ritual group of six large dark red ochre paintings in the Southern Shelter ; the more recent by a sequence of light red ochre, charcoal and white paintings in the Northern Shelter. Total excavation of the floor deposit in the Northern Shelter revealed one patch of light red ochre, a meagre stone assemblage of 2 Bondi points, one bifaced adze blade with gum adherent, two microlithic cores, 68 waste flakes and 73 fragments of bone, teeth, shell. This indicates that the North Shelter was not a workshop, nor a feeding place ; but the fire blackened roof and heavily charcoalised floor deposit indicate that occupancy was frequent. Other caves in the vicinity are more suitable for shelter from the elements, yet are sterile. The only explanation for the occupancy of the Northern Shelter would therefore seem to be related to the paintings. Excavation of the undisturbed platform deposit at the northern extremity of the Southern Shelter revealed only ochre and charcoal. The actual Southern Shelter itself contains the impressive ritualistic paintings, items 1-6, and their crude imitations in items 7-9. Otherwise there is no evidence whatever of any intrusion. The paintings of the Northern Shelter complex, items 10-45, show a colour sequence of earliest red outline, followed by red infilled, then charcoal, and latest white. The red paintings have the same chroma, hue and value as the superficial ochre layer (in the excavation) which is immediately below a charcoal layer radio- carbon, dated as a.D. 1806 and a.D. 1830. Hence the Northern Shelter paintings apparently range in age from approximately A.D. 1750 to a.D. 1830. These paint- ings appear to be secular, profane rather than sacred, confined to depicting the local fauna and the hunting of it for food. Medium, style and technique seem to have been convention bound and this art-school is represented also in a cave 9-3 miles to the south-east. The ritual group, items 1-6, in the Southern Shelter are quite different in style, technique and medium and clearly belong to a different art tradition and embody a different philosophy from the Northern Series. Their chroma, hue and value matches the deep stratum of ochre in the excavation, which provided also an ochre nodule ; three of its surfaces are flattened by grinding and it gives the same Munsell reading as the ochre deposit and the paintings. Charcoal from a closed fire hearth immediately beneath it was radiocarbon dated at A.D. 1369, so that the paintings apparently were made at approximately a.D. 1400. There is an hiatus of some 350 years between the Southern Shelter and Northern Shelter series. Five strata of charcoal occur in the floor deposit during this interval of time. It seems unlikely that the ritual group was subject to re-touching. Altered or blurred margins might be anticipated if such had been the case, and additional strata of pigment would have been expected in the excavation.</page><page sequence="20">98 DINGO AND HORNED ANTHROPOMORPH IN A ROCK SHELTER If we ignore the imitations exhibited by items 7-9, then the Southern Shelter is exclusively the province of the ritual group. Not so much as the presence of a single hand stencil intrudes upon them. It would seem that an earlier aura of sanctity was respected throughout the subsequent painting periods. They probably con- tinued to be regarded as sacrosanct, even though their tradition and interpretation may have become archaic in terms of the more mundane expressions of the later series of paintings. If sensitively regarded, these six figures purvey an atmosphere of power and awe even to a European. This first impressed itself on the writer on an occasion (5/11/1961) when a violent thunderstorm raged for almost two hours over the ravine. The opposite side of the ravine faded out, obscured by the deluge of rain ; the thunder reverberated and was amplified in the narrow valley and in the rock shelter ; the streaks of lightning continuously lanced through the semi-gloom. The paintings themselves always look brighter when the air and the sandstone are moisture laden. It was impossible in the atmosphere of that occasion to escape the conviction that the two anthropomorphs were rain and thunder deities and that the horns on their heads symbolised the lightning. There is a high rainfall and thunderstorms are frequent in this area. (There is something of a traditional belief in Kulnura that lightning is attracted by ironstone formations thought to be in the region ; geologi- cally this is apparently not so, but it is a fact that three houses have been struck by lightning, one of these a second time after being rebuilt.) Mention has been made in the text of the present paper of analogies in some respects with the Wand j ina figures of north-western Australia, with the Lightning Brothers of Delamere, with the horned rainbow serpent described by the late Father Worms, and with the late Mr. W. E. (Bill) Harney's descriptions of the Nindjeri, the men of the storms, the gecko and frog men associated with rain and lightning and fertility. The present writer had the privilege of recording Bill Harney for two hours on tape, when he called at the Department of Anatomy not long before his death. This recording was almost exclusively devoted to mythology surrounding the dingo. This will be the subject of some subsequent paper together with comparative re- cordings of the dingo in paintings and engravings from sites surveyed by the writer across the continent. For the present purposes, it is sufficient to say briefly that Harney was convinced the dingo was intimately related to ritual and fertility and was rarely associated with mundane matters. Only the scantiest remnants of the mythology of Coastal New South Wales have been preserved. In one such fragment, the late R. H. Matthews referred to the importance of the Echidna in fertility rituals. For the present moment, it would appear to be sound hypothesis that this group of male and female anthropomorphs, male and female dingo and almost certainly male and female echidna is indicative of a fertility cult, with all the attendant phenomena of thunder, rain, lightning and the creative dieties thereof.</page><page sequence="21">DINGO AND HORNED ANTHROPOMORPH IN A ROCK SHELTER 99 Geographical comparisons of analogous depictions, exploration of historical and traditional derivations, and application of function and philosophy are necessary if such groups as these are to become more than enigmatic relics. The representa- tion of cephalic cornua is an extreme rarity in the repertoire of Australian Aboriginal art. Sumerian art expresses man's inseparable dependence on nature and the natural phenomena, of storm and lightning at the turn of the seasons ; these are linked with re-marriage of the God with the Great Mother to ensure nature's fertility. Naramsin, the grandson of Sargon, the Akkadian, is probably the earliest figure recorded as wearing the horned crown of divinity (depicted in the Stele of Victory of Naramsin)1. Accompanying this concept, came the composite figures of man and animal i.e., the bull-man. These concepts had their origin no earlier than some 2000 years b.c. Later, Alexander the Great, to emphasise his divine descent, had coins stamped with his profile surmounted by bicornuates to symbolise the lightning bolts of Zeus. No horned fauna existed in Australia to provide imitative models, and so the concept of cephalic cornua must represent a derived extra-continental tradition, a tradition of part man, part deity equated with the natural elements to ensure fertility and the renewal of life. And this concept is a very recent one, no more than some 4,000 years ago in the Sumerian and Akkadian regions and still later in other parts of the world. It need not be a matter of very great surprise therefore to find the exhibition of cornuate anthropomorphs in Australian art as recently as a.D. 1400. More recordings and more comparative study in analogies will be necessary before the enigmata of Australian petroglyphs can be resolved, and their affinities and derivations traced out. It is appropriate to note also that on present evidence, the dingo himself is possibly a relatively late arrival in the Australian continent. His earliest archae- ological occurrence, so far attested is represented by a complete skeleton from D. J. Mulvaney's excavation at Fromm's Landing which was reconstructed and described by Macintosh.2 The traditional notion expressed for example by Professor Wood Jones in 1934 that the first Australian came by boat with his wife and his wife's dog, probably needs complete revision as far as the dog is concerned. It is beginning to seem more likely that the dingo arrived later than the advent of the first migrants into the continent, and that the dingo's arrival was contemporary with the introduction of innovations such as circumcision and subincision. These rites had only reached the far north-west corner of New South Wales at the time of European advent. 1 I thank Mrs. J. M. Bermingham, Department of Archaeology, University of Sydney, for directing my attention to the " Stele of Victory of Naramsin ". 2 Mulvaney, D.

As it is, these cornuate anthropomorphs appear to be unique recordings up to the present time. Perhaps other examples will yet be located in some still unexplored parts of this rugged terrain.

Lt., and member of Royal Aero Club, New South Wales and Victoria. Sun. 24/9/1961. Mr. Ian Sim conducted Miss A. M. Scot Skirving (1) and the author (1) to the site. The paintings were found to have been outlined with white chalk, apparently on the previous day. Fri. 6/10/61. Messrs. David Milner (2), Gordon Williams (1) and the writer tested the floor deposits, located two strata of ochre at the northern end of the Southern Shelter ; charcoal sample Ai was collected. The shelters were measured and photographed. A first attempt was made to brush off the white chalk. Thurs. 1 2/1 0/61. Milner, Williams and the writer experimented with various lenses, flashlight, films of different speeds ; also shots at various angles and distances, to overcome distortion due to curvatures of the rock surfaces. Photograph shown in Plate II was obtained. Thurs. 19/10/61. Williams and the writer made soundings in the Northern Shelter deposit, located light red ochre at one small area. More of the chalk was removed by brushing. Metrical survey of the painted figures was commenced. Thurs. 26/10/61. Messrs. Williams, Don Aitchison (1), Brian Johnston (1) and the writer excavated one square metre to a depth of 30 cms. in the outer margin of deposit at the northern end of the Southern Shelter. Charcoal Samples B2 and A2 were collected. Excavation of one square metre in the Northern Shelter deposit revealed no evidence of stratification. Wed. 1/11/61. Williams and the writer removed more chalk by brushing. Metrical survey of the painted figures was completed. Previous metrical survey of the dimensions of the shelters, and compass bearings were checked. Polythene tracings of a few painted figures were com- menced. Sun. 5/11/61. Miss Scot Skirving and the writer removed the last of the surface chalk by brushing and experimented with Henri Lhote technique of washing the paintings ; during two hours of thunderstorm, conditions in the shelters and the ravine, and impressions of thunder, lightning and deluge were recorded. Tues. 14/11/61. Williams and the writer completed the Henri Lhote washing technique; practically all chalk had by then been extirpated. The photographs shown in Plates III and IV were obtained. The diagrams of the previous metrical surveys of the painted galleries were checked for scale accuracy. Previously missed items were added. Nov. to Dec. 1961. Milner made three visits - one with Sim, two with Mrs. Jean Milner and Mr. Graham Mackenzie (2). Sim made some transparent paper tracings of curvilinear charcoal and white markings below a ledge recess in the Northern Shelter. Milner and Mackenzie excavated a small section in the Northern Shelter, recovering two flakes and small bone frag- ments ; they experimented with colour photography using a variety of film.</page><page sequence="23">DINGO AND HORNED ANTHROPOMORPH IN A ROCK SHELTER ioi Fri. 26/1/62. Dr. R. R. Munro (1), Williams and the writer excavated and sieved a trench and a pothole (see inset Plate I) in the Northern Shelter. Sample C was collected. One square metre was excavated to a depth of 30 cms. in the inner portion of deposit at the northern end of the Southern Shelter. Charcoal Sample Bi was collected. Many photographs in colour and black and white were taken of the stratification (see Plate V). Thurs. 1/2/62. Williams and the writer photographed the entire gallery in overlapping frames. Over the subsequent two months, these frames were pieced together to form a con- tinuous whole, which was then re-photographed and reduced to a standard scale. This was then superimposed on the metrically surveyed diagrams. Coincidence of the two series was reasonably close, but not perfect. It was therefore concluded it would be necessary to trace the entire gallery using polythene to get an accurate recording. 9/6/62. Williams and the writer used Bostick adhesive to fix polythene tracing sheets in continuous contact with the curved walls. All the painted figures were then retraced in a complete series. These polythene tracings were photographed in grids in the Photographic Laboratory of the Department of Anatomy under standard conditions, reduced at standard scale and assembled to constitute Plate I, which is therefore an exact reproduction of the paintings. On two visits in October 1962, Miss Scot Skirving and the writer, checked the Plate I survey against the paintings in the shelters. 12/4/63. Mr. and Mrs. Arthur Crossley (3) and their two young sons, Mr. C. R. J. Travis (4), and the writer, examined another series of paintings in a rock shelter 1.25 miles east of Kulnura. Floor deposit was sounded and ochre detected ; free hand sketches were made of the paintings. 10/6/63. Travis and friend, M^s Scot Skirving and the writer made a complete re-check of the shelters. Travis and his friend counted steps up and down the two sides of the ravine and the mean was used to check the height above creek bed as compared with the contours on the Military Map Survey. 15/6/63. Williams and the writer excavated and sieved 5 different sections of the Northern Shelter ; practically the total deposit in the Northern Shelter had now been sieved ; stratification did not occur in any of these. The ochre patch previously discovered (19/10/61) near the back wall was photographed in colour. 12/7/63. Dr. T. G. Vallance, Department of Geology and Geophysics called at the Depart- ment of Anatomy on another matter and made a brief inspection of the ochres from the excavation. 19/7/63. Charcoal samples sent to Geochron Labs. Inc., U.S.A. 8/1 1/63. Results from Geochron. a.d. 1369 and a.d. 1806 to 1830. 17/6/64. Edmund D. Gill, Assistant Director, National Museum of Victoria, made a brief examination of the ochres by microscope. 27/9/64. a.m. Mr. Tom King (5) and the writer made a re-check of all data and of the recordings of the measurements, compass bearings, paintings, ground plan and map locations. Mr. King, in a subsequent flight over the area, believed it would be possible to identify the site from the air, in spite of the narrowness of the ravine and the rain forest cover ; it had been intended to make a low run flight at a later date to take an aerial photograph of the western wall of the ravine and perhaps of the site and to further establish the exact map references This has had to be postponed for the time being, and is probably unnecessary, as we believe we have obtained accuracy in survey and triangulation, etc., on the ground. 27/9/64. p.m. Colonel Keith M. Travis (4), Mr. G. O. Travis (4), King and the writer also re-checked the map location, compass bearings, recording of paintings, etc., of the rock shelter east of Kulnura. On the majority of the writer's visits to the shelters, the home at Kulnura of Colonel Keith M. Travis and his wife and two sons, Christopher and Geoffrey, was a most appreciated base of operations, quite apart from their warm and charming hospitality. As the shelters are so completely isolated and off the beaten track, it was a reassurance to be able to call early in the morning and itemise one's intended operations for the day, and then report back in at night. The collaboration of all whose names have been stated in this paper is acknowledged with the writer's thanks. The tremendous amount of photographic work in the Laboratory and the labour on the sites, contributed by Gordon Williams and David Milner, calls for special acknowledgement. Finally I thank Mrs. W. A. King for the typing of the manuscript. N. W. G. Macintosh.</page></plain_text>
