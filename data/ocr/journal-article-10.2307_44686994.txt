Bevan, Stephen Grant, Kevin Kotlarski, Cynthia Lewis, Denise Teagle and Nadine Levick Johns Hopkins Univ. Copyright © 2000 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc. ABSTRACT The introduction of occupant position sensors into automobiles raises questions about the response of these sensors to current crash test dummies. To adequately test the performance of these sensors in a crash environment, it is crucial that crash test dummies resemble humans. Each sensor technology perceives the crash test dummy as being different from a human. These differences range considerably. The differences for four sensor technologies, capacitive, electric field, ultrasonic and pressure pattern, are described. The differences between humans and crash test dummies are discussed, along with possible modifications to the crash test dummies that improve the biofidelity of the crash test dummy. Results will be presented from testing on a mid- sized male and small female. INTRODUCTION The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's (NHTSA's) recent Supplemental Notice of Proposed Rule Making (SNPRM) has proposed regulations allowing automobile manufacturers to install sensors to measure the occupants' size and location in the front seats of the vehicle. These measurements would be part of a decision-making algorithm that would select the airbag deployment that minimized the potential for occupant injury. The airbag deployment could be suppressed or deployed in a low-risk or fully powered mode. While the details of the proposed rules allow a variety of solutions, the main focus of the new rules is to reduce the number of airbag-induced injuries to small females in the driver's position and injuries to infants and children in the front passenger's seat. At present, current regulatory testing of automobile safety systems principally uses the 50th percentile male Hybrid III (50-MH3) crash test dummy. This dummy is larger and heavier than the small women, infants, and children who constitute the majority of those injured by airbags. The installation of sensors in automobiles creates a testing problem with crash test dummies (i.e., Anthropomorphic Test Devices, or ATDs). For some types of sensors, measurements made on humans cannot be replicated with ATDs. The differences perceived by the sensors between the human and ATD varies, depending upon the sensor technology used and its implementation. Previous work in this field1 performed on the öO^-MHS showed that the difference between it and a human was small for ultrasonic sensors, with greater differences for capacitive and passive infrared sensors. Because of these difficulties, NHTSA, in their SNPRM, permits manufacturers to use humans instead of the ATD surrogates. However, the use of humans, particularly children, poses many problems. Adults and children of the correct weight and height are not always available when needed. Test subjects are difficult to place in reproducible postures. Short attention spans of children can preclude extended test periods of static postures. In addition, humans cannot be used in crashes where there is a potential for injury. For these reasons, ATDs that appear human-like to occupant sensors are desirable. There are two types of sensors that detect the occupant by measuring changes in the electromagnetic field. A capacitive sensor measures the voltage induced on a receiver and detects the presence of an occupant by changes in the field. Although the electric field sensor has a different electronic implementation, it too uses the change in the electromagnetic field surrounding the sensor to detect occupants. These detectors respond strongly to the conductivity of the human body. Except for a thin layer of skin, a human's flesh is reasonably conductive2 (Figure 1). An electric field sensor can be used to classify an occupant and estimate the size.3 Electric and capacitive sensors can estimate the distance between the occupant and the sensor.4, 5- For both sensor types, the conductivity of the human body strongly affects an electromagnetic field, just as metal or any conductive material affects the electric field. Because of this conductivity effect, electromagnetic field sensors easily detect the metal frame of the 50th-MH3. Since the metal lies under the skin of the dummy, the 50th-MH3 appeared to be farther away from the sensor than a human in a similar position1. 1594</page><page sequence="2">The previous work1 with ultrasonic sensors showed that the 50th-MH3 produced a weaker maximum signal than a human, even when similarly dressed. The differences could be attributed to (ą) the difference in the acoustic impedance between the human and 50,h-MH3 or (b) the differences in the shape between the human and the 50th-MH3. These results are not necessarily significant in the vehicle because this test method measured the maximum static response and does not reflect normal posture and movement variations. When normally positioned in a vehicle, the measurements showed there are no significant differences in the ultrasonic reflection of a human and 50th-MH3. Signal intensity variation due to distance and posture in the seat were far greater than the differences between the human and 50th-MH3. Because of the variety of sensors, the test methods and results are organized by sensor type and test method. TESTING AND RESULTS CAPACITIVE AND ELECTRIC FIELD TESTING - The majority of experimental testing was performed in the laboratory. Laboratory testing was performed using a front vehicle seat mounted on rails in front of a sensor (see Figure 2). This testing in the laboratory used a similar experimental procedure as that discussed in the earlier publication.1 This slide allowed the human or crash test dummy to remain relatively motionless while being moved toward and away from the sensor. This allowed the sensed range to vary from several centimeters to a meter. For most of the testing presented here, the sensor was mounted level with the sternum of the subject. Although this test method does not reproduce typical forward bending motion of an occupant in a vehicle, the measurements were far more repeatable than the motion in a vehicle. For the capacitive measurements, two sensors were used (Figure 3), a bread loaf sensor and a circular sensor. The bread loaf sensor has an electric field shaped like a bread loaf. This sensor field shape is created by two parallel wires, 305 mm long, located about 15 mm apart, mounted over a 105 x 355 mm ground plane.5 The electronics for the bread loaf sensor were provided by Advanced Safety Concepts, of Albuquerque, NM. For the circular sensor, concentric transmitter/ receiver rings form a hemispherical field shape. The electronics for the circular sensor included a signal generator, a preamplifier, and a lock-in amplifier. The lock-in amplifier generated a signal proportional to the relative voltage of the transmitted and received signal. For the electric field sensor, the manufacturer, NEC Automotive Electronics, supplied the electronics that were used. The distance between the subject and the sensor was measured using a laser range finder. Measurements from the range finder and sensor were made simultaneously and stored by a computerized data acquisition system. An initial offset measurement was made to correlate the distance from the sensor to a point on the chest of the subject. This compensated for the variations in seated posture, shape, and size of the subject. After the offset was measured, the subject, seated in a front vehicle seat, was positioned about 1 inch from the sensor. The seat with the subject was slid back on the rails to about a meter. During this movement, simultaneous measurements were recorded of the subject's distance from the sensor and corresponding sensor response. During this test several factors could be altered: sensor type, sensor location, subject, and ATD could be interchanged and the ATD could be covered with conductive materials. The state of ground of the subject and ATD also could be changed as well as the occupant posture. Figure 4 shows the importance of occupant leg position with the sliding rail system. The effect of the knees passing under the sensor is clearly visible in the data, particularly when the knees are raised with the calves against the seat. In the remainder of the data reported, the thighs were kept in a normal position against the seat cushion. The majority of the sensor response is seen in the closest 30 cm. For this reason, while data were collected out to almost a meter, only the beginning portion of the curve was studied. Figure 4 also shows the difference in the capacitive sensor's response to a 50th- MH3 and a similarly sized human. For the same response, the 50th-MH3 is closer to the sensor than the human. Repeated Seating. Multiple Subjects - Testing of the capacitive and electric field sensors was repeated using two groups of human subjects, small females and mid- size males, to look at the variation in sensor response to different individuals of similar size. The purpose of this testing was to characterize the range of sensor response to different individuals and compare this range to the sensor response to ATDs of similar sizes. The testing was performed using human subjects having a size similar to that of the 5th percentile Hybrid III (5th-FH3) or the 50th-MH3. The height and weight of the individuals measured is plotted in Figure 5. Five subjects of each size were tested. The testing was performed using the circular capacitive sensor and the NEC electric field sensor. For each subject, at least 15 slide tests were made for each sensor. The tests were made in series of three, after which the subject slightly shifted in the seat. This repeated testing was intended to determine a typical range of response for normally seated individuals having a similar size to the ATDs of interest. For the 50th percentile male, the capacitive sensor results show that the sensor's response to the painted dummy resembled that of a human male of similar size (Figure 6). For the electric field sensor, the results showed that both the painted and unpainted dummy are slightly closer to the sensor than similarly sized human male subjects for the same sensor response (Figure 7). Testing is under way to explain the reasons for these results. 1595</page><page sequence="3">For the 5th-FH3 and similarly-sized females, the capacitive and electric field sensor results show that both the painted and unpainted ö^-FHS were slightly closer to the sensor than a similarly sized human females for the same sensor response (Figures 8 and 9). There are two potential explanations for this difference. As previously mentioned this testing involved measuring an offset from the sternum of the subject. In testing of small females, it was apparent that the shape of the subject's torso was dissimilar to that of the 5,h-FH3. Although the anatomical norm of female torsos has great variation, the 5th-FH3 was not similar to any of the human subjects tested. The poor anthropometric similarity between the 5th-FH3s and the human subjects could account for the approximate 3- cm difference in response at close distances. Testing is planned to better determine what changes in anthropometry will resolve the differences in sensor behavior. Second, the majority of the subjects used for this testing were larger than the 5,h-FH3. For the same sensor response, larger subjects appear farther away from the sensor. Effect of Conductive Paint on Sensor Response - The circular capacitive sensor, mounted level with the sternum of the subject, was used to measure the effect of conductive coverings on the sensor response. Several coverings were tested, including aluminum foil, metallized conductive cloth, and carbon-filled conductive paint. All of the conductive coverings improved the resemblance of the 50,h-MH3 to a human. Figures 10 and 11 show that the two layers of conductive paint improved the resemblance of the 50łh-MH3 to a similarly sized human male subject. The conductive paint, Elimstat LX conductive coating (100-ohm formulation), from the Walter Legge Company, was selected for its tenacious adhesion to the vinyl used in construction of the ATD skin and its low resistivity. This paint was used throughout the testing to improve the resemblance of ATDs to humans. Capacitive Sensor Locations - Testing was performed using the bread loaf capacitive sensor mounted in several positions relative to the subject. For this test, the slide was used with a 50łh-MH3 and a similarly sized human. Figures 12 and 13 show the data and sensor position relative to the 50th-MH3 for two of the tests. The first test is to represent a windshield implementation of the capacitive sensor where the sensor is mounted at head level tilted forward toward the head. The second is a top- mounted instrument panel implementation where the sensor is mounted at chest level, tilted away from the subject. Simultaneously, the measured distance and sensor response were recorded as the subject was slid away from the sensor. The data were fitted and the error, the difference in position between the human and normal or painted 50th-MH3, was calculated. Figures 12 and 13 show that the measured distance of the painted 50th-MH3 usually appeared more similar to a human than the normal, unmodified 50th-MH3. The exception to this was the windshield implementation at distances greater than 22 cm, where the sensor response to the normal 50,h-MH3 appeared closer to a human than the response to the painted 50th-MH3. The reason for this difference in sensor response may be due to the differences in anthropometry between the human and the 50th-MH3 and errors in the curve fitting at larger distances. With the relatively horizontal slopes at larger distances, small errors in curve fits can result in large errors in distance predictions. Although the scatter of the human data in Figure 6 cannot be directly applied to Figures 12 and 13, Figure 6 does suggest that a difference in position of less than 1 cm between the dummy and human is within the range of human variation. In-Vehicle Testing - To better understand in-vehicle performance and to compare it to the laboratory testing, several sets of in-vehicle tests were performed using the 5th-FH3, 50th-MH3, and similarly sized humans. The test method was to position the human in front of the bread loaf sensor at a variety of locations and measure the response of the sensor at those locations (Figure 14). In the testing, the subject was seated with his or her knees near or against the instrument panel. As the subject leaned forward, measurements were made using the capacitive sensor mounted on the face of the instrument panel over a range of distances. The subject's distance from the sensor was established by placing a spacer between the subject and the instrument panel and leaning forward to form the proper gap. After the proper gap was formed, the spacer was removed and the subject sat motionless while the capacitive measurement was made. This testing was repeated for an unpainted ATD and an ATD that had been painted with a conductive paint. Generally there were small differences between the human, unpainted ATD, and painted ATD. Figure 15 is an example of the results gathered. In general, the human, unpainted, and painted ATDs produced similar response curves with slight differences. More testing is necessary to determine if the improvements seen in labotatory testing translate into improvements in vehicle measurements. Testing with a number of humans of similar size as the ATDs is needed to estimate the subject-to-subject variance in testing. One of the problems getting reproducible vehicle test results is the inability to reproduce the same posture in the human, 5th-FH3, and 50th-MH3. Since the capacitive sensor is most sensitive to the area closest to the sensor, the region of the body measured varied from the chest at longer distances to the forehead at close distances. In leaning forward, the human bends far differently from the Hybrid III. A human can bend from the hip joint, sacrum, lumbar, thoracic cavity, and cervical spine. The head position can easily move relative to the torso by tilting the head up and down as well as extension and retraction of the chin. While it was easy for a person to assume a fixed position, the large number of bending modes made it 1596</page><page sequence="4">difficult for the subject to repeatedly adopt the same posture. In addition, the human did not bend in the same fashion as a Hybrid III ATD. The 5th-FH3 and 50th-MH3 were difficult to position, requiring considerable force to bend the ATD forward and a rope to hold the ATD in a leaning forward posture. For the 5th-FH3 and 50th-MH3, it appeared that most of the bending occurred in the hip joint. The head moved very little relative to the torso, in contrast to the human, where most of the fine distance adjustment occurred in the neck. The non-symmetrical fields of the sensor compounded the effects of this variation. Some of the sensors tested had highly non-symmetrical fields. Subtle variations in x, y, z, and rotational position of the torso and head varied the sensor response. These variations in sensor response could be large, particularly at short distances. ULTRASONIC OCCUPANT SENSING - Measurements were made to determine if the reflected ultrasonic signal from the ATDs was different in amplitude from similarly sized humans. The procedure was similar to that used in earlier work,1 where a Murata ultrasonic transducer was mounted on a frame in front of the subject, level with the sternum. The ultrasonic transducer was pointed at the center of the sternum of the human and ATD. The subject was seated in a front vehicle seat, sitting upright. The test dummy and human were carefully positioned to maximize the intensity of the returning ultrasonic signal. While this careful positioning and measurement of the chest does not reflect a vehicle application, the information gathered characterized surfaces of somewhat similar size and shape. This measurement of the maximum reflection intensity was made for 10 human subjects: 5 mid-sized males and 5 small females. For each of the five measurements, the subject attempted to maximize the signal by shifting his or her position in the seat. These measurements were collected at distances of 40 cm and 80 cm. Figure 16 summarizes the average and the range of measurements collected. Both the mid-sized male and small female ATDs reflected about the same as their similarly sized human counterparts. The difference in response was within the range of human responses. The ultrasonic response of the small females and mid-sized males was surprisingly similar. Since the typical reflected ultrasonic signal amplitude of randomly seated individuals in vehicles will be less than the values measured in Figure 16, it is expected that the ATD and humans will be indistinguishable in vehicles equipped with ultrasonic sensors. PRESSURE PATTERN - The pressure measurements beneath subjects seated in a vehicle seat show variations between the ATDs and humans. Figure 17 shows preliminary results of patterns recorded under humans and ATDs seated in front vehicle seats. The pressure measurements were collected using an X-sensor pressure distribution system. Initial observations identified differences in the seated pressure patterns. Under the Hybrid III ATDs, there was no pressure pattern formed by deflection of the soft tissue of the hips and thighs. The thigh pattern of THOR is closer to that of a human but the joints are very visible. The low-pressure pattern area between the ATDs' hips and thighs is different in shape from that found on a human. The Hybrid III ATDs do not conform to the seat as well as humans do. The lack of conforming flexibility is particularly evident in the 5th-FH3 by the high-pressure region under the thighs at the seat edge. In contrast, the human ischial tuberosities form a strong pattern, but the soft tissue combined with flexible waist and hip joints forms the remainder of the human pattern. For the human male, the thighs tend to spread and form a "V," unlike the male ATDs. Efforts are under way to better characterize the differences found and develop modifications that make ATDs appear more human-like. CONCLUSIONS Testing on four types of proposed occupant sensing systems with mid-sized males, small females, and similarly sized ATDs was performed. These sensors included capacitive, electric field, ultrasonic, and pressure pattern sensing systems. The results of testing with capacitive and electric field systems showed that painting the ATDs with conductive paint improves their resemblance to humans. The degree of improvement varies with the ATD and the sensor technology. For the painted 50,h-MH3, the ATD resembled a similar sized human male to capacitive sensors. For the electric field sensor, the 50,h-MH3 was closer to the sensor than similarly sized human males for the same sensor output. For the same sensor output, the 5th-FH3 was closer to the sensor than similarly sized human females at close distances. This difference disappeared at greater distances. The angle and height of the sensor also varied the degree of resemblance of the 50th-MH3 to similarly sized human. The reasons for these differences are currently being investigated. Testing with ultrasonic sensors showed the ATDs and similarly sized humans to be indistinguishable. Preliminary pressure pattern testing show differences between ATDs and similarly sized humans. These differences are being more closely investigated, and modifications are being developed to reduce the differences.
