LEWIS-W1LLIAMS VOL.4 JUNE 1983</page><page sequence="2">The cover illustration is Pat Vinnicombe's copy of a southern Drakensberg rock painting. It was published in black and white in her book People ofthe Eland (Natal University Press, 1976); this full colour version shows many details to better advantage. Vinnicombe describes the painting thus: A recumbent eland is tied with double thongs around rear legs, front legs and neck. Two spotted human figures with hooves in lieu of feet, and with long snout-like faces marked with lines, stand at the eland's head. From the nose of one of these figures, there is a small tusk-like protrusion. An antelope-headed figure behind the eland stands with clawed arms upheld, while a similar creature with a very fragmentary head appears to dive downwards. It follows a double spotted line which leads to the eland's neck where there are three short red strokes. Another spotted line, merging to a single line in places, extends from the eland's front legs towards a curious animal with short clawed legs and a snouth-like face similar to the heads of the anthropomorphic figures. Above the rump of the eland is an antbear with long tongue extended. The faces of the antbear and the eland are marked with fine red lines, and feathery white lines extend upwards from three ofthe figures. Some features of this painting also occur in many other paintings and are discussed in this volume by various writers.
