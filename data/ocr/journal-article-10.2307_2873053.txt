<plain_text><page sequence="1">MILTON AND TENNYSON'S "GUINEVERE" BY STEVEN C. DILLON Readers have even from the earliest associated Tennyson with two classical poets: Theocritus and Virgil. Charles Tennyson re- lates that these two writers were in fact his grandfather's "fa- vorites."' The distinction between these affinities must be consid- ered in large part one between formal and metaphysical aspects of Tennyson's poetry: his highly-wrought idylls and epyllia cast him in some sense in the role of a Victorian Alexandrian, yet his all- pervading mood of melancholy and of deep-felt loss associate him in telling ways with Virgil.2 When T. S. Eliot calls Tennyson "the master of metrics and melancholia," however, he is articulating a realization that form and mood need not or may not be separable;3 the endless pathos of Dido's tale winds strands from Hellenistic epic (Apollonius Rhodius' Argonautica) and an epyllion by Ca- tullus (64) inextricably together with both Odyssean markers (Nausicaa, Calypso) and Greek tragedy (Euripides' Medea). Virgil can be Hellenistic and still be Virgil: in Tennyson's "To Virgil," as Herbert F Tucker, Jr., points out, the Roman poet is celebrated for his language and his forms as well as for his noble sadness. By insisting on a connection between form and metaphysical despair, Tucker is all the more convincing when he says once again, "Ten- nyson is the most Vergilian of English Poets."4 We need to understand the Idylls of the King as formally related to moments of idyll in epic such as the fourth books of the Aeneid and Paradise Lost.5 What there is in Tennyson's Idylls of the Theo- critean or its adaptations is always surrounded by an expanse of epic gravitas and moral seriousness. The Idylls of the King are to be distinguished from the English Idyls, not just in the spelling, which Tennyson employed to differentiate them from "ordinary pastorals," but also in the genitive of the King.6 The King's pres- ence surrounds the ten tales grouped under the heading "The Round Table" in the framing tales of Arthur's advent and depar- ture. Arthur's ghostly history and ideals are always in the back- ground to hold flush against the progressing idylls. As we move from the golden etiological "Coming of Arthur" toward the beauti- 129</page><page sequence="2">fully nightmarish "Passing of Arthur," the intervening idylls be- come more and more tragic, as Arthur's paradise (for it is his) is lost. Paradise Lost is of course the clearest example in English epic of an "ideal" idyll (book 4) becoming a tragic idyll (book 9)-and Tennyson wishes to exploit this connection. Spenser's waylaying idylls (the Bower of Bliss, Calidore's sojourn with Pastorella) block and reevaluate heroic progress, but they are not tragedies. To take a continental example, the Gerusalemme Liberata is replete with classical tragedy (Solimano, Clorinda), but Tasso's tragic idyll is an instructive reprise, as he suffuses Canto 16 with Virgil by having Rinaldo and Armida quote Aeneas and Dido at great length.7 Virgil depicts the progress towards a new home after the falls of Troy and Carthage, and before the final battles Aeneas is allowed to pause for the peaceful idyll of Aeneid 8.8 This order of idyll (tragic idyll in Aeneid 4, ideal idyll in Aeneid 8) is the reverse of that in Milton and Tennyson. Virgil and Milton provide the best examples in epic of the contrast between ideal idyll and tragic idyll; as Tasso looked to Virgil, it is to Milton that Tennyson most overtly alludes in "Guinevere," the penultimate idyll of the Idylls of the King. The presence of Milton in Tennyson is underestimated when compared with the critical evocations of Theocritus, Virgil and, of course, Keats. There is early on (1888) a suggestive comparison of Tennyson and Milton in the manner of Plutarchan lives, and re- cently Tucker has commented on the influence of Milton in Ten- nyson's juvenilia.9 But beyond lists of allusions, which are incom- plete in any case, there remain many larger points of contact be- tween Milton and Tennyson;10 for the moment, what is Milton doing so pervasively in Tennyson's "Guinevere"? "Guinevere" appeared in the 1859 Idylls of the King as the last idyll of four after "Enid" (later split into "The Marriage of Geraint" and "Geraint and Enid"), "Vivien," and "Elaine" (later retitled "Merlin and Vivien," and "Lancelot and Elaine"). " The four idylls break up neatly into groups, the second half darker than the first, as death first appears in "Elaine." We may also pair the first with the fourth and the second with the third: the central idylls are more purely tragedies (Merlin's fall and Elaine's tragedy, Dido- like though straight from Malory), while the framing idylls involve manifestations of authority that are related to tragedy (Geraint tests Enid and Arthur chastises Guinevere). The framing becomes 130 Milton and Tennyson's "Guinevere"</page><page sequence="3">less clear in the final organization (1888) because Tennyson intro- duces "Merlin and Vivien" with "Balin and Balan"-and death enters that much sooner. "Guinevere" still ends the completed "Round Table," however, and does so by providing a link from the now all too human world of Lancelot and Guinevere to the mysterious epic grandeur of "The Passing of Arthur." Arthur does not often appear in the Idylls, though he is ever present in the aura of the heroic that surrounds each idyll; even in his absence he is the shadowy em- bodiment of the civilization that human willfulness and folly are drawing to a close. But in "Guinevere" he appears in full view, bringing to bear all his well-known and problematic relatedness to divine order. And as in Milton, it is only with great difficulty that divinity is accommodated. I Tennyson opens "Guinevere" with an immediate flurry of allu- sions to Paradise Lost that very finely and tellingly compare Modred to Satan. 12 Guinevere has fled to a "holy house at Almes- bury": her cause of flight Sir Modred; he that like a subtle beast Lay couchant with his eyes upon the throne, Ready to spring, waiting a chance. (9-12) That the "subtle beast" is immediately Miltonic rather than Bib- lical is attested to by further surrounding echoes.13 "Couchant," for instance, suggests Satan circling about Adam and Eve as a lion and then as a tiger: as a Tiger, who by chance hath spi'd In some Purlieu two gentle Fawns at play, Straight couches close, then rising changes oft His couchant watch, as one who chose his ground Whence rushing he might surest seize them both Gript in each paw: when Adam first of men To first of women Eve thus moving speech, Turn'd him all ear to hear new utterance flow. (PL 4. 403-410)14 Modred is like Satan spying on love's idyll, but in Tennyson the garden is already falling, and falling, idyll after idyll. As I will be arguing, the echoes of Milton insist on a difference between Milton and Tennyson, namely in the continually languorous mode Steven C. Dillon 131</page><page sequence="4">of Tennysonian tragedy. Modred seeks to "Make disruption in the Table Round" (17), just as Satan wants to "interrupt" God's joy (2.371), but Eden falls "on a sudden" (9. 900), whereas Camelot is always already breaking apart. Modred next climbs to the "top of the garden-wall" (25), recalling the more vigorously Odyssean Satan who (entering Paradise) "At one slight bound high over- leap'd all bound" (4. 181). Modred listens "all ear and eye," which is a complicating echo, since it is Adam who is "all eare" (4. 410). This allusion works in concert with Modred's climbing (as opposed to leaping) the garden wall to suggest that the Satanic has not been wholly prescribed to Modred. And what Modred sees in the garden are the heroines of the other 1859 Idylls: "[He] saw the Queen who sat betwixt her best / Enid, and lissome Vivien, of her court / The wiliest and the worst" (27-29). Each of the dramatic stages of Paradise Lost are therefore present in the "Guinevere" idyll: Modred, couchant, espies Enid and Vivien and Guinevere in a falling garden, a garden neither entirely innocent nor quite lost. Elaine is present too, recalled in the appearance of Lancelot, who plucks Modred "by the heel" and casts him "as a worm" upon the way. The confrontation is reminiscent of the discovery of Satan by Ithuriel and Gabriel (Modred and Satan are found "couched": 31; 4.876), but Lancelot must treat Modred as a peer, since he is also a member of the Round Table. Strikingly, the scene is re- peated when Guinevere and Lancelot later part before the spying eyes of Vivien and Modred. Once more Milton's angels are in- voked, and again with a kind of despairing irony. "Traitor, come out, ye are trapt at last," aroused Lancelot, who rushing outward lionlike Leapt on him, and hurled him headlong, and he fell Stunned, and his creatures took and bare him off, And all was still: then she, "The end is come, And I am shamed for ever." (103-110) At this extreme moment of guilt and division Lancelot suddenly and astonishingly becomes Christ: "[Satan] the Almighty Power / Hurl'd headlong flaming from th'Ethereal Sky" (1.44-45). This version of heavenly wreck is weakened-"the end" is only the end of love, and the creatures rescue Modred-but the passage is fi- 132 Milton and Tennyson's "Guinevere"</page><page sequence="5">nally more convincing, in its exhausted passion and in its spare intimations of Milton, than any of the Christlike figures later be- queathed to Arthur. The oppositions that seem clear or in any event clearer in Milton, happy garden versus tragic garden, Christ or angel versus Satan, are no longer at all clear in Tennyson. In a moment I will study Arthur's godlike judgment upon Eve; for now I may observe that Lancelot is certainly in no position to judge-he is of the same court as Modred and all of them are falling together. The above allusions compare Modred to Satan, but also suggest that he is not quite isomorphic or equivalent with him. He is spying, after all, on the adulterous lovers Lancelot and Guinevere, and at the garden wall-a wall which Modred only climbs onto-we find both him and Lancelot. Lancelot is ultimately also a Satan figure, and as much and even more responsible than Modred for laying waste to Camelot. Tennyson is capable of deploying the satanic with a subtle and knowing touch. His is not the sublime Prometheanism of Shelley nor the titanic melancholy of Keats's Hyperion poems. Instead Tennyson's satanic or antithetical mode is aligned with his recur- rent, deep-pulsing doubt, and is present generally in the suicidal aspects of "The Two Voices" and "Tithonus." From The Devil and the Lady to "Demeter and Persephone" Tennyson is more and more seriously interested in the qualifying rumblings of the un- derworld; the palace in "The Palace of Art," of all places, is related to Pandemonium. Both "Ulysses" and "The Lotos-Eaters," far from being poems which stand in contrast to one another, deploy satanic motifs in significant ways. The Lotos-Eaters delude them- selves with a rhetoric taken from Spenser's Despair, as James Kin- caid has shown, and Ulysses is of course the rhetorician from Dante's Inferno, who borrows from Satan to conclude, "To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield" ([70]; "And courage never to submit or yield" [1.1081). The satanic touch in Tennyson is always careful: "Ulysses" is indeed about the "&lt;need to go onward,"' as Tennyson claimed, but after Arthur Hallam's death the journey forward can only be one taken up in doubts, hence the clear sug- gestions of a satanic heroic. 15 Even Tennyson's "Milton" (1863) is not without its curious ef- fects in the satanic mode. Here Tennyson antithetically chooses Eden over the more sublimely idiomatic Milton: Steven C. Dillon 133</page><page sequence="6">O mighty-mouthed inventor of harmonies, o skilled to sing of Time or Eternity, God-gifted organ-voice of England, Milton, a name to resound for ages; Whose Titan angels, Gabriel, Abdiel, Starred from Jehovah's gorgeous armories, Tower, as the deep-domed empyrean Rings to the roar of an angel onset! Me rather all that bowery loneliness, The brooks of Eden mazily murmuring, And bloom profuse and cedar arches Charm, as a wanderer out in ocean, Where some refulgent sunset of India Streams o'er a rich ambrosial ocean isle, And crimson-hued the stately palm-woods Whisper in odorous heights of even. (1-16) G. K. Hunter takes the first part of the poem to be in the High Victorian "bow-wow" sublime. 16 The formulation is not so much to bark up the wrong tree as it is to bark up Auden's tree, without considering the willful and heady ways Tennyson is employing Miltonic language and circumstance. Tennyson is willfully antithetical insofar as he chooses Eden over a loud-mouthed heaven, and also insofar as the choice is actually between versions of the satanic, between the effulgence of the sa- tanic heroic sublime and the muted, wandering luxury of an ori- ental lotos-paradise. To begin with, why are the angels "titan"? This certainly recalls Shelley's Prometheus and Keats's council in Hyperion. "Gorgeous" is the epithet for Satan's orient pomp at the opening of book 2 ("the gorgeous East" [2.3]), and it also de- scribes his throne amidst the war in heaven (6.103). The nearest analogue to Tennyson's "gorgeous armories" is in Samson Ago- nistes, where Samson, with only a staff, challenges Harapha to "put on all thy gorgeous arms" (1119). The "titan angels" are looking sublimely satanic enough, then, when they proceed to "tower" as well, which echoes a memorable minatory gesture: "He above the rest / . . . Stood like a Tow'r" (1.589-91). Tennyson, I would argue, is handling the Miltonic idiom very knowingly. It is perfectly clear that "gorgeousness" and "towering" will to some extent make the "Titan angels" pagan. "Empyrean / rings," on the other hand, is purest heaven, as it sums the halle- luiahs to creation: "So sung they, and the Empyrean rung" (7.633). But creation is no longer the context, and Tennyson goes on: 134 Milton and Tennyson's "Guinevere"</page><page sequence="7">heaven rings to the "roar of an angel onset." In Milton "onset" is associated with a hellish attack; Beelzebub advises a border strike, "a sudden onset" (2.364), and the "rushing sound / Of onset" ends for the angels each "milder thought" of heavenly tranquillity (6.97-98). Finally, "roaring" is positively devilish: the "Throat of War" and the gunpowder machines roar (11.713; 6.586). The heav- enly throne also "roars"-but only to the satanic mind: Mammon conjures a "Majesty of darkness" about God's throne, "from whence deep thunders roar" (2.266-67). Against this oriental war in heaven Tennyson chooses another kind of orientalism, and in the simile he turns Eden into a lotos- land.17 "Me rather" shifts gears in a Keatsian direction, towards the poetry of earth, as in "Bright Star," or as in the turn from the infernal council of Hyperion 2 to the pastoral of Hyperion 3: Thus in alternate uproar and sad peace, Amazed were those Titans utterly. O leave them, Muse! 0 leave them to their woes; For thou art weak to sing such tumults dire: A solitary sorrow best befits Thy lips, and antheming a lonely grief. 18 But even more than Keats, who comes to hate those Miltonic in- versions, the latinate "me rather" strongly suggests also Horace's idiomatic "but as for me.""19 Ode 1.7 moves in characteristically similar ways to Tennyson's "Milton." Laudabunt alii claram Rhoden aut Mytilenen aut Ephesum bimarisve Corinthi moenia vel Baccho Thebas vel Apolline Delphos insignes aut Thessala Tempe. sunt quibus unum opus est intactae Palladis urbem carmine perpetuo celebrare et undique decerptam fronti praeponere olivam. plurimus in lunonis honorem aptum dicet equis Argos ditisque Mycenas. me nec tam patiens Lacedaemon nec tam Larisae percussit campus opimae, quam domus Albuneae resonantis et praeceps Anio ac Tiburni lucus et uda mobilibus pomaria rivis.

Dillon 135</page><page sequence="8">nowned for Bacchus, Delphi for Apollo, or Thessalian Tempe. Some there are whose only task it is to hymn in unbroken song the town of virgin Pallas and to place upon their brows a wreath of olive gathered from every quarter. Many a one in Juno's honour shall sing of horse-breeding Argos and of rich Mycenae. As for me, not hardy Lacedaemon, or the plain of bounteous Larisa has so struck my fancy as Albunea's echoing grotto and the tumbling Anio, Tiburnus' grove and the orchards watered by the coursing rills.] 20 The Horatian signature calls to mind moralistic imperatives, the civic duty that surrounds Horace even in his epicurian roles (he is still exemplary on his Sabine farm). Tennyson's idyll is also in an august moral context, but his delight has not so much to do with instruction as with guilt. While Keats's solitary or Horace choose their idyll very easily (part of Horace's almost Emersonian lesson is that he can distinguish that idyll from its surroundings with full will), Tennyson's choice is much more vexed. For Tennyson's choice is not only a choice against Milton in a poem to or about Milton-on the order of Pope's "To Augustus" rather than Horace's-it is also a choice between prospects more equal than they seem, as the poem exchanges one orientalism for another (Horace's opposition of "me" to "alii" is much more clear). In the context of the heroic, Tennyson cannot choose an idyllic retreat as simply as Keats or Horace can. The choice is radical, subtly sa- tanic, and Tennyson can resolve himself of Milton's heaven only by recasting the angels as Milton's devils. The ironies of this choice are typically Tennysonian, especially in the way that he reworks both Milton and Horace; such reworking proves interestingly troubling in "Milton," and tragically complex in the Idylls of the King. When Tennyson puts both Modred and Lancelot at the garden wall in "Guinevere" he is deploying Miltonic contexts with de- vious power: Modred is a vulgar, obvious, though rather puny Satan, while Lancelot is formally and delicately satanic-he who tempts Eve/Guinevere from Adam/Arthur. As a chivalric lover Lancelot is more than a "subtle beast," but we must also attend to Tennyson's careful castings around of satanic shade. Lancelot is like Tennyson in the alcaic "Milton"-making a beautiful, wrong choice. Hallam rather disarmingly tells us that Tennyson "loved his own great imaginative knight, Lancelot of the Idylls"; partly, one would hazard, in that he is a perfect emblem of the formal workings of the Idylls of the King (Tennyson knew that Arthur's 136 Milton and Tennyson's "Guinevere"'</page><page sequence="9">dialectic is much less convincing).21 Lancelot is always posed be- tween a properly satanic set of contraries, the terms of which in Blake provide a reservoir of antithetical energy, and which in Ten- nyson more quietly modulate a languorous tragedy. In addition to the Idylls of the King, Lancelot appears in "The Lady of Shalott" (1832) and "Sir Launcelot and Queen Guinevere" (1842)- each time in the midst of a telling strain of opposites. The Lady of Shalott, for example, envisions Lancelot as Spenser's Ar- thur, an astonishing juxtaposition.22 All in the blue unclouded weather Thick-jewelled shone the saddle-leather, The helmet and the helmet feather Burned like one burning flame together, As he rode down to Camelot. As often through the purple night, Below the starry clusters bright, Some bearded meteor, trailing light, Moves over still Shalott. (91-99) Spenser's Arthur is frightful, "That suddeine horrour to faint hartes did show" (Faerie Queene 1.7.31), but Tennyson's Lancelot is positively ominous. Tennyson exacts allusions with great sugges- tive force: not only does he compare Lancelot to Arthur-do we even possess critical terms for such an irony?-he also places "A red-cross knight" (78) on Lancelot's shield, which of course sug- gests Spenser's Redcrosse. Yet the allusive comparisons are at di- vision, since Arthur in Faerie Queene 1.7 is coming to rescue Red- crosse from Duessa's deceptions. And Lancelot is patently neither Arthur nor the Knight of Holiness; his "questing" is in this poem one of uninterrupted bemusement: "Tirra lirra," by the river Sang Sir Lancelot. (107-108) Lancelot is a gorgeous mythical knight, gorgeously distracted. The poem concludes with Lancelot still turning between a heroic di- vinity and a stupefied voyeurism, as the corpse of the Lady of Sha- lott floats past the palace: Who is this? and what is here? And in the lighted palace near Died the sound of royal cheer; Steven C. Dillon 137</page><page sequence="10">And they crossed themselves for fear, All the knights at Camelot: But Lancelot mused a little space; He said, "She has a lovely face; God in his mercy lend her grace, The Lady of Shalott." (163-171) While the other knights fearfully bless themselves, Lancelot blesses the Lady, yet his reaction is still primarily an aesthetic one: "She has a lovely face." Before the remaining knights Lancelot usurps an Arthurian or even a divine prerogative in this conclusive blessing. Yet he still dwells firmly on the earth: he survives the fairy ideality of the Lady, just as later he will survive the broken idealism of King Arthur. "Sir Launcelot and Queen Guinevere" begins, thematically, thus: Like souls that balance joy and pain, With tears and smiles from heaven again The maiden Spring upon the plain Came in a sun-lit fall of rain. (1-4) The poem goes on to describe a richly sensuous medieval forest through which the lovely Guinevere rides. The fragment con- cludes: As fast she fled through sun and shade, The happy winds upon her played, Blowing the ringlet from the braid: She looked so lovely, as she swayed The rein with dainty finger-tips, A man had given all other bliss, And all his worldly worth for this, To waste his whole heart in one kiss Upon her perfect lips. (37-45) The closing simile makes Lancelot an Everyman, who would for one idyllic moment give up everything, all "worldly worth." And anyone would, but for Lancelot to give up the world is to make the world once more a wasteland. There is, then, a consequence to this suicidal waste, and also, softly, an echo. Beelzebub foresees an attack on Eden which will "waste his whole Creation" (2.365). Tennyson's echoes in the Idylls are similarly subtle: Lancelot is 138 Milton and Tennyson's "Guinevere"</page><page sequence="11">not Modred and Guinevere is not the serpentine Vivien, yet both are responsible for Arthur's lost paradise. The Miltonic allusions in "Guinevere" are also uniquely concentrated-nowhere else does Tennyson tilt so insistently towards any text save Malory's. Owen Meredith, in his very lovely poem "The Parting of Launcelot and Guenevere," has his Queen invoke the Miltonic almost too easily. I falter where I stood secure: The tower I built is fall'n, is fall'n, the staff I lean'd upon hath broken in my hand. And I, disrobed, dethroned, discrowned, and all undone, Survive my kingdom, widow'd of all rule, And men shall mock me for a foolish Queen.23 "To falter" is one way to invoke Adam's tragedy ("hee the falt'ring measure felt" [9.846]), and indeed Tennyson molds it to a similar purpose, as we shall see; but Tennyson will never mouth the Mil- tonic diction so simply as does Meredith here ("disrobed, dethroned, discrowned"). Milton rolls through and informs "Guin- evere" in much more powerfully careful and complicated ways. "Guinevere" opens with an immediate bringing together of in- nocence and guilt, of the garrulous novice and Queen Guinevere in an abbey, just as the Queen is momentarily poised between Enid and Vivien, and Lancelot meets spying Modred at the garden wall: Queen Guinevere had fled the court, and sat There in the holy house at Almesbury Weeping, none with her save a little maid, A novice: one low light betwixt them burned Blurred by the creeping mist, for all abroad, Beneath a moon unseen albeit at full, The white mist, like a face-cloth to the face, Clung to the dead earth, and the land was still. (1-8) Pastoral earth responds to and echoes humankind, and Tennyson's weird anthropomorphic simile ("like a face-cloth to the face") cor- responds to Earth's reactions in the tragic idylls of Virgil and Milton ("prima et Tellus et pronuba Juno / dant signum," Aeneid 4.166-67; "Earth trembl'd from her entrails, as again / In pangs, and Nature gave a second groan" [PL 9.1000-01]). The blurred low light partakes of the ignis fatuus: the "creeping mist" recalls a satanic obscurity, although in Paradise Lost the mist is black (Satan Steven C. Dillon 139</page><page sequence="12">is like a "black mist low creeping" [9.180]). Tennyson begins "Guinevere" very strangely and programmatically: a novice faces Guinevere in an abbey surrounded and infiltrated by portentous mist. Both Tennyson and Milton frame a scene of parting in terms of hovering mist, but in each case there is a critical question at stake as to whether the previous, more dubious aspects of the imagery have been revised away or merely repeated.24 Milton recalls the mist with which Satan entered in the closing simile of the gliding Cherubim: On the ground Gliding meteorous, as Ev'ning Mist Ris'n from a River o'er the marish glides, And gathers ground fast at the Laborer's heel Homeward returning. (12.628-32) As Adam is now this postlapsarian laborer, it is probably not amiss to listen for satanic echoes. Now fallen-although, euphemisti- cally, "falling" has become "Igliding" (in either case lapsus) -man will return not to an epic home like Ithaca but to death, to dust ("Dust I am and shall to dust return" [10.770]). More important, the mist floating at the laborer's heel is, by virtue of the internal echoes, emblematic of man's return against Satan. Man will bruise Satan's head, as Satan bruises man's heel (10.498-99). Arthur departs from Guinevere enfolded in a misty vision that in its point by point detail corresponds to the opening lines of the idyll. In a passage much more extreme in its resonance than Milton's evening departure, Guinevere looks out her window, hoping to catch a glimpse of Arthur's face: And near him the sad nuns with each a light Stood, and he gave them charge about the Queen, To guard and foster her for evermore. And while he spake to these his helm was lowered, To which for crest the golden dragon clung Of Britain; so she did not see the face, Which then was an angel's, but she saw, Wet with mists and smitten by the lights, The Dragon of the great Pendragonship Blaze, making all the night a steam of fire. And even then he turned; and more and more The moony vapour rolling round the King, Who seemed the phantom of a Giant in it, 140 Milton and Tennyson's "Guinevere"</page><page sequence="13">Enwound him fold by fold, and made him gray And grayer, till himself became as mist Before her, moving ghostlike to his doom. (586-601) Where before "&lt;one low light" burned between the novice and the Queen, now "the Dragon" burns while the nuns and Guinevere look on. As in Spenser and also Tennyson's "Hesperides," this dragon is a divine, countersatanic power, and whereas earlier a cloth covered the face of the dead world, Arthur's face is here unseen but "as an angel's." Tennyson, like Milton is revising away a purely satanic mist-there is a meteoric angel where previously there was death-yet again like Milton, Tennyson will not wholly revise the image away. And the King's threshold departure is much more hyperbolic than Adam's, since he is also a wonderful and troubling angel. In Milton the angels are the angels; and the laboring man appears only by similitude, but Arthur is both the angel and that passing man. Dubiously grand, he is in addition a "phantom . . . Giant," not entirely unrelated to those titan angels of "Milton," and reminiscent also of "Tithonus," who roams the "far-folded mists," a "gray shadow, once a man" ("Tithonus," 10-11). As the dreamlike "The Passing of Arthur" will be, the de- piction is both nightmarish and beautiful: Arthur is an angel "moving ghostlike to his doom."' The most spectacular and also discomfiting sequence of this idyll has Arthur in his dual capacity as angel and passing man pro- nounce his doom on Guinevere. The explicit manifestation of Ar- thur, who throughout the Idylls of the King has remained more a misty context than a presence, moves Kincaid to remark that "these days the idyll is likely to seem an unaccountable lapse on Tennyson's part. "25 Kincaid's following discussion is very good, and notably appreciative, but I would prefer to follow John D. Rosen- berg, who speaks of Tennyson's aesthetic "risk": "In the frame poems Tennyson risks obscuring Arthur's humanity by enveloping him in the aura of divinity. In 'Guinevere' he takes the opposite risk of obscuring Arthur's divinity by stressing his troubled hu- manity. "26 Incarnations and anthropomorphic gods are necessarily risky, and it is not coincidental that it is again in terms of risk that Joan Webber characterizes a Miltonic poetics, and so accounts for God's appearance in book 3,27 In "Guinevere" Tennyson breaks off from his more idiomatic, Virgilian poetics of shrouded ambiva- lence or fated choicelessness and unveils a didactic moralism. In Steven C. Dillon 141</page><page sequence="14">these terms, it should not be surprising that Arthur's appearance evokes grudging critical reactions akin to those of readers of Para- dise Lost 3, 11, and 12. "Guinevere" continues to evoke Milton in varied and complex ways, as Arthur's speech to the fallen Queen is clearly related to the judgment of Christ upon Adam and Eve in Paradise Lost 10, and recalls also that Godlike monotony (PL 3), and Michael's vi- sions in book 11.28 The surrounding aura is assuredly Miltonic, though as we have seen, Tennyson builds up his contexts from a number of places in Milton; Paradise Regained is also relevant, since Christ and Arthur both suffer from the paradoxes of incarna- tion (we are to believe that Christ is hungry; we are to believe that Arthur is in love). As Arthur approaches Guinevere, Tennyson forcefully cues the Miltonic declamations of Michael and Christ through his use of the latinate "denouncing": She made her face a darkness from the King: And in the darkness heard his armed feet Pause by her; then came silence, then a voice, Monotonous and hollow like a Ghost's Denouncing judgment, but though changed, the King's. (414-418) God, for instance, charges Michael: Haste thee, and from the Paradise of God Without remorse drive out the sinful Pair, From hallow'd ground th' unholy, and denounce To them and to thir Progeny from thence Perpetual banishment. (11.104-108) And Christ's judgment is concluded thus: So judg'd he Man, both Judge and Savior sent, And th' instant stroke of Death denounc't that day Remov'd far off; then pitying how they stood Before him naked to the air, that now Must suffer change, disdain'd not to begin Thenceforth the form of servant to assume. (10.209-214) The Idylls of the King is about losing paradise, over and over, and at last, when there is nothing left to lose, Arthur descends as if from heaven, wafting Miltonic. Throughout the Idylls Tennyson's 142 Milton and Tennyson's "Guinevere"</page><page sequence="15">poetics is precisely that of Christ-though in a very different sense-as he consistently defers the sudden change of tragedy (quantum mutatus: "But 0 how fall'n! how chang'd / From him . . ." [1.84-85]). Yet the sense must be different, indeed, al- most demonic, insofar as it involves a lingering over crisis after crisis, to culminate in the gorgeous euphemism of Arthur's "passing." Tennyson effects this poetics of continuity in part, as we have seen, by endlessly graded and subtle juxtapositions of ver- sions of innocence and experience. After her final meetings with Lancelot and the ironic catechism of the novice, Guinevere now silently confronts Arthur's problematic divinity. On Arthur's ar- rival the nuns hear a whisper, "Then on a sudden a cry, 'The King'" (408, my emphasis), where the diction echoes that of Eve's fall (9.900). And once more, against her prostrate fallenness, Tennyson proffers the consolation of continuity ("then a voice . . . tho' changed, the King's"). The most important device that Tennyson uses in "Guinevere" to contrast states of innocence and experience is that of a remem- bering or flashback. Both the novice and Guinevere recollect past times; Arthur revises Michael by showing Guinevere the history of Camelot's fall instead of a prophetic history ("Know I am sent / To show thee what shall come in future days" [11.356-57]). Bear with me for the last time while I show, Even for thy sake, the sin which thou hast sinned. (451-52) Arthur proceeds quite formally to list in the manner of command- ments the Table's vows ("To break the heathen and uphold the Christ / To ride abroad redressing human wrongs" [467-68]) and to narrate the even progress of sin's contamination ("Then came thy shameful sin with Lancelot; / Then came the sin of Tristram and Isolt, / Then others" [484-86]). The cadence of the lists moves from biblical commandments to a parody of epic catelogue (the latter as in Milton's Hell: "With these in troop / Came Astoreth Thammuz came next behind" [1.437-38, 446], where the progress of devils embodies a future history of sin). And Arthur further mingles memory and desire by imagining his now very human survival in a fallen paradise: How sad it were for Arthur, should he live, To sit once more within his lonely hall, Steven C. Dillon 143</page><page sequence="16">And miss the wonted number of my knights, And miss to hear high talk of noble deeds As in the golden days before thy sin. (493-497) As Christ, proleptic of his incarnation, assumes the "form of servant" as well as that of judge in book 10 of Paradise Lost, Ar- thur shifts roles between judging angel and reflecting, broken- hearted man. But of course Arthur's representation is far more extreme than Christ's, and thus much more risky. Yet while the rapid transitions from apocalyptic pronouncement to domestic melancholy can be offputting, this awkwardness is not without dra- matic power and thematic point. As Arthur stoops to raise the fallen Guinevere-she will soon recognize that he is "the highest and most human too" (644)-he adopts both prophetic and lyric modes of speech. And all is past, the sin is sinned, and I, Lo! I forgive thee, as Eternal God Forgives: do thou for thine own soul the rest, But how to take last leave of all I loved? O golden hair, with which I used to play Not knowing! (540-45) The transformations of role are thematic, insofar as Arthur is Christ incarnate, God-in-man, speaking to an earthbound Guine- vere in terms of a lyrical love ("Let no man dream but that I love thee still" [557]), but they are also forcefully obtrusive: Arthur cannot be Tennyson's High Victorian mouthpiece, for his idealism is too systematically cancelled out by his lyrical loneliness, just as his misty exit was far more dubious and extreme than Adam's.29 On the threshold of life and death, towering between "Guinevere" and "The Passing of Arthur," the representation of the King is unique, riskily Miltonic and necessarily unconvincing, though not unmoving for being so. It is once more instead Lancelot's quietly satanic dialectic that must be the true emblem of a Tennysonian poetics, since it partakes, repeatedly, both of the world and of a higher duty. At the end of the central idyll, "Lancelot and Elaine," Tennyson invents for Lancelot a beautiful monologue in which he cries out torn between the callings of the Queen's heart and his deep-felt duty towards God. And though he will die a holy man, by "Guinevere" Lancelot's love-loyalty is only to the Queen; after 144 Milton and Tennyson's "Guinevere"</page><page sequence="17">much delay he departs according to her wish. In contrast, then, to the rather noisy key-changes inherent in the presentation of Ar- thur, Tennyson parts Lancelot and Guinevere in relative silence, without perceptible qualification, and he carefully marks their final moment with a glance towards Virgil. And then they rode to the divided way, There kissed, and parted weeping: for he past, Love-loyal to the least wish of the Queen, Back to his land; but she to Almesbury Fled all night long by glimmering waste and weald, And heard the Spirits of the waste and weald Moan as she fled, or thought she heard them moan: And in herself she moaned "Too late, too late." (123- 130)30 In a similar web of relations, Arthur's vision of "golden days" before the sin stands against versions of origination communicated by the novice and Guinevere. The novice has only hindsight, as we shall see, and Guinevere is self-deluded, whereas Arthur's his- tory is true-he is no longer "not knowing." But this is also to admit that his idealism was previously blind, and he now faces the last battles with a dignified despair. These numerous juxtaposi- tions of innocence and experience cannot be characterized in any usual way as ironies, much less as deconstructions, which is why I keep suggesting that a somewhat satanic poetics of continuity best describes the way "Guinevere" works and also the idyll by idyll movement of the poem and its meanings. As continuity softly defers death it also darkens life: this is precisely the modulating and rhythmical affect of Tennyson's tragic idylls. Milton too is scattered evenly throughout "Guinevere," with a varying presence; Miltonic language is reserved not only for Ar- thur's imitatio Christi, but also turns up in telling ways in the ret- rospects of the novice and the Queen. The novice begins, "the land was full of signs / And wonders ere the coming of the Queen" (230-31), and she describes a whirling fairy-landscape "of spirits mad with joy": The flickering fairy-circle wheeled and broke Flying, and linked again, and wheeled and broke Flying, for all the land was full of life. (255-57) The depiction is drawn, as Paden tells us, from Tennyson's in- Steven C. Dillon 145</page><page sequence="18">terests in fairy literature such as T. C. Croker's Fairy Legends, though there may also be, more canonically, recollections of the peasant dances in The Prelude (1850, 6.370 if.) and of Shelley's "The Two Spirits. "31 The Queen "bitterly" interrupts this fairy idyll, "Were they so glad?" (270), and asks if none of them were able to read the signs and wonders. One could, it is answered, a prophetic bard, and the novice concludes her history with his broken song. And could he [Arthur] find A woman in her womanhood as great As he was in his manhood, then, he sang, The twain together well might change the world. But even in the middle of his song He faltered, and his hand fell from the harp, And pale he turned, and reeled, and would have fallen, But that they stayed him up; nor would he tell His vision; but what doubt that he foresaw This evil work of Lancelot and the Queen? (296-305) The structure of the novice's remembrance is characteristic: it moves, gradually, from fairy tale to prophecy, and from idyllic hope to tragedy. And Tennyson at the end draws on Milton once more, from the context that informed my earlier extract from Owen Meredith, where Adam waits with a garland of flowers for his "Harvest Queen": Great joy he promis'd to his thoughts, and new Solace in her return, so long delay'd; Yet oft his heart, divine of something ill, Misgave him; hee the falt'ring measure felt. (9.843-847) The novice is certainly not Guinevere's "self," as some critics would have it; instead she is, with Arthur, another version of inno- cence.32 Indeed, reenforced by the Miltonic echo, the accusatory power of the novice is in its own way as trenchant as the King's. Two kinds of dramatic irony are in play: Adam makes a wreath for the lately deflowered Eve, and the novice fails to realize that her un- named auditor is in fact the treacherous Queen about whom she speaks. Dramatic irony is so called because we the audience know more than the unsuspecting innocents before us, but there are as usual degrees to innocence and knowing. Adam feels momentarily 146 Milton and Tennyson's "Guinevere"</page><page sequence="19">the fall, just as Arthur eventually knows, but at an uncertain point in time ("When first I learnt thee hidden here" [536]). Now, with considerable thematic force, the innocent novice unsuspectingly tells of a bard who has silently known all along of tragedy's immi- nence. Guinevere recalls paradise as well, though her golden vision necessarily comes after the novice's fairy idyll and is ambivalently related to Arthur's "golden days" before the sin; I quote the entire passage both for its thematic importance and its delusive beauty. "Surely I repent," the Queen murmurs, after frightening away the novice, and she vows never to think on Lancelot again: And even in saying this, Her memory from old habit of the mind Went slipping back upon the golden days In which she saw him first, when Lancelot came, Reputed the best knight and goodliest man, Ambassador, to lead her to his lord Arthur, and led her forth, and far ahead Of his and her retinue moving, then, Rapt in sweet talk or lively, all on love And sport and tilts and pleasure, (for the time Was maytime, and as yet no sin was dreamed,) Rode under groves that looked a paradise Of blossom, over sheets of hyacinth That seemed the heavens upbreaking through the earth, And on from hill to hill, and every day Beheld at noon in some delicious dale The silk pavilions of King Arthur raised For brief repast or afternoon repose By couriers gone before; and on again, Till yet once more ere set of sun they saw The Dragon of the great Pendragonship, That crowned the state pavilion of the King, Blaze by the rushing brook or silent well. (375-397) This recollection of the Queen is, in parvo, an idyll of the King, an idyll in the context of the King. It is at the same time, characteris- tically, in its movement and its echoes, a type of tragic idyll. Guin- evere's narrative, lovely but deluded (her "golden days" cannot be Arthur's), moves a maytime idyll into the evening grandeur of the King's serene blaze. This is the progress of the Idylls of the King, as maytime hope-quickly seen to be deluded and blissfully blind -breaks upon the distant purview of the King. Tragic idyll results Steven C. Dillon 147</page><page sequence="20">from the forgetting, or better, the self-conscious ignoring of con- text; one pretends to live in a Theocritean pastoral when after all the world is so obviously Virgilian. And now in "Guinevere," as the idylls have run their tragic course, Tennyson continually in- vokes Milton as the final and most powerful context of tragic idyll: there was a paradise and this paradise has been lost. Again, however, Tennyson deflects a moment of crisis, so that in contrast to Milton's clear origins and sudden falls, Arthurian origin and catastrophe are cloudy, uncertain. Guinevere's "golden days" are not Arthur's in part because her paradise is too interwoven with verbal ambivalences and tragic prolepses. What is the status of Guinevere's innocence here? Before her remembrance she con- templates "sins that made the past so pleasant to us" (373), and afterwards she grows "half-guilty in her thoughts again" (405). Nevertheless, in the center of her recollected idyll we hear the narrator's Miltonic intervention, "as yet no sin was dream'd" (com- pare, for instance, Adam "Led on, yet sinless, with desire to know" [7.61]). The passive voice obscures a possible dreamer: as- suredly Arthur is "not knowing"; yet perhaps their talk on love is also sinless, truly golden? The landscape is "delicious," a carefully chosen Miltonism: Tennyson uses the word only a few times else- where, while Milton repeatedly calls Eden "delicious" ("this deli- cious place" [4.729]). The word however entails a potentially tragic etymology, since it is related to delicere, "to entice away. Kincaid observes that this landscape looks a paradise, and seems a heaven-the words refuse to shift into being or actuality.33 From an originary idyllic moment the mode of the narrative turns to ominous repetition. The golden days are drawn out, as if they could become a "golden year": the sequence "every day," "on again," and "yet once more" ends with a quiet but appropriately elegiac glance towards "Lycidas." The stronger echo of Milton, "For brief repast or afternoon repose," puts us into the certain midst of tragic idyll. Faced with parting, Adam iterates a request for Even's return: Oft he to her his charge of quick return Repeated, shee to him as oft engag'd To be return'd by Noon amid the Bow'r, And all things in best order to invite Noontide repast, or Afternoon's repose. (9.397-403) 148 Milton and Tennyson's "Guinevere"</page><page sequence="21">Whereupon the narrator cannot refrain from commenting on the delusions of the innocent: O much deceiv'd, much failing, hapless Eve, Of thy presum'd return! event perverse! Thou never from that hour in Paradise Found'st either sweet repast, or sound repose. (9.404-407) Guinevere's reverie contains the seed of Tennyson's method and poetics, just as in its idyllic beginnings it contains the beginning of the end. We are given a variety of natural perspectives, so that what Guinevere remembers is and is not paradise. These are "golden days" when "as yet no sin was dream'd"; however, they only look a paradise, and will later be contrasted with Arthur's more knowing history. The ambivalence is Virgilian, not Miltonic. Milton is continually clear about where our postlapsarian world stands, and so prefaces the ideal idyll of Paradise Lost 4 with an apocalyptic regret, "O for that warning voice." Tennyson leaves it for us to determine whether Guinevere or indeed Arthur should have been warned. Arthur's speech is Miltonic in its clarity of judgment and in its effective finality. But it is enwrapped in a typi- cally Tennysonian series of emblematic confrontations, as it follows the parting of Lancelot and Guinevere and the dramatic ironies of the novice but does not transume them. If the Idylls must always be taken in the context of the King, so too must the King be taken with complementary idyllic modes. His morality is not Tennyson's; Tennyson's view is inherent in the overall structure of "Guine- vere," and its relation to the other idylls. A Miltonic metaphysics demands choice, a constant testing, and a failed choice makes for a tragic fall, however fortunate.34 But a Virgilian or Tennysonian po- etics moves beyond the category of choice, as there are neither clear alternatives nor consequences. No matter what we choose or do there is the depth of fated doom: "From the great deep to the great deep he goes." At the edges of Guinevere's private idyll is a fiery King, who is as quietly mysterious as he is divine. Till yet once more ere set of sun they saw The Dragon of the great Pendragonship, That crowned the state pavilion of the King, Blaze by the rushing brook or silent well. (394-397) Steven C. Dillon 149</page><page sequence="22">So she did not see the face, Which then was as an angel's, but she saw Wet with the mists and smitten by the lights, The Dragon of the great Pendragonship Blaze, making all the night a steam of fire. (591-595) Tragically, up to the time when she officially chooses Arthur, Guinevere is Eve. After a proleptic dream akin to Eve's in Para- dise Lost 5 (85 if.), she is striken with troubles that "did not pass but grew": Till even the clear face of the guileless King, And trustful courtesies of household life, Became her bane. (84-86) And Arthur similarly associates Guinevere with that satanic inver- sion ("all good to me becomes / Bane" [9.122-23]) when his chas- tisement reaches its misogynistic climax: [She] saps The fealty of our friends, and stirs the pulse With devil's leaps, and poisons half the young. Worst of the worst were that man he that reigns! Better the King's waste hearth and aching heart Than thou reseated in thy place of light, The mockery of my people, and their bane. (518-523) Yet Guinevere is not only the devilish Eve, but also the Eve of renewal, Christlike as she relinquishes Lancelot from any blame: Would God that thou couldst hide me from myself! Mine is the shame, for I was wife, and thou Unwedded: yet rise now, and let us fly, For I will draw me into sanctuary, And bide my doom. (117-121) Whither shall I betake me, where subsist? . . . both have sin'd, but thou Against God only, I against God and thee, And to the place of judgment will return, There with my cries importune Heaven, that all The sentence from thy head remov'd may light 150 Milton and Tennyson's "Guinevere"</page><page sequence="23">On me, sole cause to thee of all this woe, Mee mee only just object of his ire. (10.922, 930-36) After the fall Adam and Eve wax properly humble and giving, as here, but since their "right reason" has been lost, they also ex- pound a good deal of nonsense. Moments after this Eve hopes to deceive death by suicide. Tennyson bereaves Guinevere of these fitful delusions by investing her final vision with a clarity that even Milton does not and cannot wish to match. At last Guinevere sees Arthur's truth: I thought I could not breathe in that fine air That pure severity of perfect light- I yearned for warmth and color which I found In Lancelot-now I see what thou art, Thou art the highest and most human too, Not Lancelot, not another. (640-45) As it turns out, Guinevere's error was a kind of reverse aspiration, or a false humility. Eve's error, on the other hand, was precisely to love the highest, to try to ascend into the purer air, which she happily forgets on hearing the sentence of exile: How shall I part, and whither wander down Into a lower World, to this obscure And wilde, how shall we breathe in other Air Less pure, accustomed to immortal Fruits? (11.282-85) In "Guinevere" Tennyson continues to invoke Milton both for the depth of his moral clarity and for the inherent finality of his poetics. Though we are not unsympathetic, Eve is clearly babbling in her lament for Eden; there is a before and an after in Milton, and in such a state of mind Eve deserves to leave paradise. "Guin- evere" ends on the extreme notes of ultimatum, on the threshold of death, as the Queen repents and quietly looks forward to a "purer life" (648). It may be that Tennyson invokes Milton to have Milton speak for him. "Guinevere" is not an aesthetic lapse: its strangeness results from an astonishing instance of poetic ventrilo- quism, wherein, and not without risk, the King's Miltonic contexts confront the idyllic remnants of Camelot. A Tennysonian perspec- tive, like Lancelot, is in between, between the clear Miltonic and Steven C. Dillon 151</page><page sequence="24">the easily idyllic, and constantly guilty or despairing for being both or neither. Tennyson is a moral poet-nothing like Byron, as the Victorians were generally pleased to observe-but he is a moral poet more like Virgil than Milton. The didactic morality of "Guin- evere" is Miltonic, though on Tennyson's terms, but the Idylls of the King taken as a whole are as dialectically moral as their form is shifting. As in "Milton," Milton is invoked only to be misrepre- sented or made smoothly satanic. The status of Tennyson's valo- rized heroic is constantly interwoven with an irony which is nei- ther New Critical nor Derridean but, in darker and more meaningful ways, Virgilian. The Victorian moralists who admired "Guinevere" could not understand it in sequence with the "re- volting" "Merlin and Vivien. "35 But the resonance of Tennyson's poetic strategy suggests that beauty and ugliness, life and decay, are continually revolving into one another, ambivalently, and be- fore we can choose one; tragic idyll in Tennyson stops, but then, unlike in Milton, it starts up again.36 The issue of Tennyson's mo- rality is far too broad for the present discussion; but it is to my mind most suggestive when Tennyson-and in real life, entirely unpossessed by some daimonic muse of poesy-tells one of his many Boswells about another satanic Christian poet: Tennyson read Baudelaire's Fleurs du Mal, and thought him "a kind of moralist," though his subjects, he allowed are shocking. I could not agree (and had, I think, studied Baudelaire more closely); he seems to me to take pleasure in seeing evil comn- mitted, and also in seeing evil-doers punished-a devil rather than a moralist.37 The Idylls of the King are, in sum, tragic idylls, whose most important formal and metaphysical progenitors occur in Virgil and Milton. I have attempted to show to what extent "Guinevere" is Miltonic, as the last of the idylls of the "Round Table," and as the shadowy context of the King becomes more and more clear. But we must also keep in mind Tennyson's peculiar form of dialectical irony, perceptible as either a quiet satanism (these days we might say gnosticism) or as a Virgilian poetics of loss, neither of which allow choice without ambivalence, or transcendence without recol- lection. "I know my words are wild," says the speaker of "Locksley Hall" (173, Tennyson's italics), as his mind spins between the "knots of Paradise" ("I will take some savage woman, she shall rear my dusky race") and the Halls of English Idyl ("But I count the 152 Milton and Tennyson's "Guinevere"</page><page sequence="25">gray barbarian lower than the Christian child"). Neither Blake nor Baudelaire, Tennyson is yet in the Idylls of the King formally and metaphysically of the party of Lancelot, and he knows it.

Lancelot never construes Guinevere as a fetish with this or this sort of epithet. 30 The formula "saw, or thought he saw" and its variations are by this time idiomatic in blank verse. Milton starts the habit in Paradise Lost 1.783-84: "some belated Peasant sees, / Or dreams he sees." However much the phrase has become cliche, in "Guinevere," as in Milton, and as in the last lines of the Idylls ("The Passing of Ar- thur," 464-65), we are yet to hear its Virgilian origins, where as if beneath a new moon Aeneas sees an obscure Dido, "aut videt aur videsse putat" (Aeneid 6.454). 31 Paden, 156 if. 32 See Hair, 214, who follows Reed, 72. 33 Kincaid, 208. 3 On the concept of Miltonic choice in general see Leslie Brisman, Milton's Poetry of Choice and its Romantic Heirs (Ithaca and London: Cornell Univ. Press, 1973). 35 A reviewer in Fraser's Magazine (60 [September 1859]: 301-14) passes quickly over the "revolting" subject of "Vivien," and says of Arthur and Guinevere, "Nothing can be finer than this scene between the two" (311). J. M. Ludlow, like John R. Reed, takes "Guinevere" to be the "Idyll of the King." In answer to those who would charge that the "revolting" surrounds Tennyson's Christian doctrine Ludlow writes, "Well, the subject is revolting; we admit it. Yet surely not so much so as many which are recorded in Holy Writ, which we durst not even wish to excise from it" ("Moral Aspects of Mr. Tennyson's 'Idylls of the King,' " Macmillan's Magazine 1 [November 1859]: 67). 36 The Virgilian equivalent is Aeneid 12, which in many ways repeats Dido's tragedy. A good general analysis is by Michael C. J. Putnam, "Book XII: Tragic Vic- tory," in his The Poetry of the Aeneid: Four Studies in Imaginative Unity and Design (Cambridge: Harvard Univ. Press, 1966), 151-201. 37 William Allingham: A Diary, ed. H. Allingham and D. Radford (London: Mac- millan, 1907), 331. For a distantly related but very interesting study, see Pierre Em- manuel, Baudelaire: The Paradox of Redemptive Satanism, trans. Robert T. Cargo (Tuscaloosa: Univ. of Alabama Press, 1970).
