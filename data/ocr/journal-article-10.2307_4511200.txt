<plain_text><page sequence="1">214] Recent Literature Bird-Banding productivity, and management of sage grouse in Idaho," by P. D. Dalke and others in therefore timely. The population studied was highly mobile, moving 13-27 miles to brood range from strutting grounds, and 30-50 miles to winter range, for an annual round trip of 50-100 miles. Counts of strutting cocks, and brood censuses in early July, are useful. Sex, age, and reproductive criteria are discussed. These latter points are also considered in the other two papers. The final two papers are reviews "Disease and infection in the Tetraonidae," by C. M. Herman. cautions against the tenacious assumption that a single "grouse disease" is a cause of grouse mortality, and calls for new tools and techniques to attack problems in wildlife diseases. Gardiner Bump's "History and analysis of tetraonid introductions into North America," recounts unsuccessful attempts to stock capercaille, black, hazel, and willow grouse. He also makes a case for the possibility of successfully introducing the first two species, though without con- sidering possible effects on native species. The symposium is closed by an ex- cellent evaluation of the constituent papers by Frederick and Frances Hamer- strom, who served as its assistant editors. Those wishing informative summaries of the contents should turn here first. In such a heterogeneous array of contributions it is not possible to point out minor errors or points of disagreement in individual papers and I shall make in- stead only a few general comments. The photographs do not indicate sex of the birds illustrated, and in some cases this is not evident by inspection.. Usage of common names is somewhat confusing; in some papers both racial names (ex. dusky, sooty grouse) and species name (blue grouse) are used. Finally, a more representative survey of work currently in progress might have been possible had a longer time (say, several years) been allotted to assembling the contributions. This is said in full appreciation of the difficulties faced by editors of such a sym- posium, but a better volume could have resulted from the elimination of certain minor papers and the inclusion of more reviews and major papers. It is to be hoped that The Wildlife Society will continue to publish symposia, and in the future more frequently than once every ten years.-Robert S. Hoffmann. 53. Argen the Gull. Franklin Russel. 1965. Alfred A. Knopf, Inc. New York, 239 pp. 9 photographs by the author, 1 map (the coast of Atlantis or per- haps Shangri-la). Price $4.95 Mr. Russell is a fine professional writer but he reminds me of the so-called Very Important Persons who came to Japan during the American occupation for a visit of five days or perhaps five weeks. When they returned to the United States, they felt qualified to write a book about Japanese life and thought. It is possible after a brief visit to describe superficially Japanese geisha girls, a shrine, and Fujiyama, but not even after five years of daily associa- tion with Japanese in their homes would a student of far eastern mores feel com- petent to write of Japanese life and thought. Franklin Russell dares to put thoughts and emotions into a Herring Gull's brain and heart that a lifelong student of animal behavior would hesitate to presume existed. He has even endowed Argen the Gull with the ability to dream. Mr. Russell makes a very exciting story of the evolution of gulls and the life of a Herring Gull from egg to senility. In his first chapter he introduces a theory new to science when he suggests that perhaps feathers developed to keep primitive birds warm and were later found useful for flight. The book contains some factual Herring Gull behavior, probably adopted from Tinbergen's The Herring Gull's World. Certainly much of the story of Argen's first mating came from the section entitled "The Formation of New Pairs" in that fine work. But Russell takes no notice of Tinbergen's theory that can- nibalism among gulls occurs only in overcrowded colonies. If one can overlook scientific inaccuracy, anthropomorphism, and the author's over-active imagination, Argen the Gull may be labeled "Leisure Time Reading." The pictures are more "Art Photography" than bird illustrations. The jacket design is pleasing.-Elizabeth S. Austin. 54. Rare and Exotic Birds. Robert Cushman Murphy. 1964. The Odessy Press, New York. 45 pp., 75 color photographs by Arthur Singer. Price $0.95. This beautiful little book is a delightful combination of the lesser known abilities of two very gifted men. Robert Cushman Murphy, outstanding as a scientist, demonstrates his fund of bird folklore and his gift for story telling. Arthur Singer,</page></plain_text>
