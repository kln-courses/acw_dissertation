<plain_text><page sequence="1">Of Graves, of Worms, and Epitaphs No matter where. Of comfort no man speak! Let's talk of graves, of worms, and epitaphs. - King Richard II I. One Boone, Halloween cul-de-sacking thirty years down ago, Cumberland I went trick-or-treatin' Gap Court. Other as Daniel love- Boone, cul-de-sacking down Cumberland Gap Court. Other love- struck boys in the mid-1960s suburbs of Los Angeles were equally spell- bound by Fess Parkers improbable television series about the mythic frontiersman, but I bet I had the only grandmother who giggled when her grandson proudly covered his pointy ears with a piece of roadkill from Woolworth s department store. "Pumpkin," she debunked in a gentle chide, pronouncing each word in a steady saunter, "Daniel Boone would not have been caught dead in a coonskin cap." ■ ■ ■ In this, the season of my fortieth year, finding myself sliding into middle age, and missing my maternal grandmothers presence more than I ever thought possible, I traipsed through the cemeteries of Missouri s Femme Osage tracking down the little-known history of Daniel Boone's rolling gravestone. "Cemeteries," I would learn, comes from the Greek word for "sleeping chambers," because they were considered temporary resting places during the wait for Judgment Day. I would eventually discover some irony in this etymology, but there I'm way ahead of the journey I no more knew my traipsing would lead me to the grave of tiny Angelina Hardin, or the ashes of Grayce Hardy Burtt, than I knew, thirty years before, Daniel Boone wouldn't have been caught dead in a coonskin cap. I started, as is my custom - and my bane - from a book's remove. A legion of previous sextons have exhumed the Boone legend. Rousseauian noble 142</page><page sequence="2">Dale Rigby 143 savage? Land speculator? Jeffersonian yeoman farmer? Wife deserter? The Great Voluptuary in William Carlos Williams's famous attack on American Puritanism? What new epitaph could I carve for the bones of Daniel Boone? During my travels, though, I gradually unearthed the suspicion that these necropsies elided some salient details. As befits a legend, I remember Fess Parker dwarfing even ex-footballer Rosy Grier in the television series (he didn't really), but I would learn that Daniel Boone's frame, at his death, was only between 5'8" and 5'10" (nobody knows for sure). Instead of riding like Shane into the sunset, Boone died febrile and enmeshed in legal squabbles, terrifying neighbors near the end of his days with his habit of "taking many a nice nap" inside his coffin of hand-picked black walnut. No doubt I'm too much the grandson of a debunking, literal-minded grandmother, but William Carlos Williams's claim, that Boone "has since remained buried in a miscol- ored legend and left for rotten," is open to some small disputation. His bones, contrary to Williams's figuration and Boone's own wishes, most decidedly did not remain buried. Their disinterment is indisputable (if open to interpreta- tion). Even Boone's belated footstone got rousted from its sleeping chamber, though not before falling over and cracking into bits and pieces, an igno- minious image befitting a fractious history of exhumations and restorations. II. Some papers that were considered exemplary a quarter-century ago - papers in which students compare their grandmothers toi 954 Fords ... or describe an event that changed their lives - are not part of the curriculum. - from a 1998 English Department's teaching philosophy I can't imagine my grandmother holding the reins of a 1954 Ford. Sure, she worked in the airplane factories of World War II, but her model was of nineteenth-century frontier vintage. Raised on a large Montana sheep ranch, she could braid a functional lasso out of horsehair, but she never did learn to drive an automobile. How could the chrome of a 1954 Ford com- pete with the gleam of her spurs against the Big Sky? Besides, like Daniel Boone, my grandmother, given her druthers, would naysay all essayistic exhumations. I can hear her now, cantankerous and no- nonsense. "Don't go dressing me up in any of your coonskin tales," she'd snort. But if there is one thing I learned after a season tracking down Daniel Boone's rolling gravestone, it's that the dead don't necessarily get their druthers. ■ ■ ■</page><page sequence="3">144 Fourth Genre When Daniel Boone died in eastern Missouri in 1820, at age eighty-six, his bones were placed, bareheaded, in a cedar box, in a tiny, crowded, unkempt family graveyard, and left for the worms, as then customary on the American frontier, in an unmarked grave. Fifteen years passed before a family relative arranged for two rough granite headstones to mark both Boone's grave and that of his wife, Rebecca, who had died in 1813. These headstones were still standing when a delegation from Kentucky, against Boone's expressed wishes, dug up his bones and carted them in a steamboat to Frankfort for perpetual care. When I would eventually track Daniel's footstone to tiny Central Methodist College in Missouri, I discovered that his name was spelled with- out the E - it read BOON. Poets from William Carlos Williams to William Stafford have made of Boone a man too big for his grave; while the honor- able states of Missouri and Kentucky have litigated for a grave too small for the man. I looked a little harder into the afterlife of Daniel Boone and decided that there should have rightly been room for D O G G L E on that footstone. Though I can hear my grandmother chiding me already. "Pumpkin, you are clever, but facts are facts, and 'boondoggle' is no older a phrase than the doctor's slap on your little posterior." She's right, too. It's there in the O.E.D. bequeathed to me by a grandmother who scouted the dictionary each night for her own muckraking pleasure. Grayce Hardy Burtt would also try to control her corporeal posterity. She felt that her death was too private for a grave. When she died of cancer in northwestern Ohio in 1993, after a long struggle that taxed every iota of her dignity, her eighty-six-year-old cremains were tossed, per her want, into a shallow lake the funeral home calls an ash garden. ■ ■ ■ My mother, a painter of abstract canvases, feels in images, and so, though she cried her way through the arrangements, she has never felt the slightest need to go commune with her mothers ashes. "They told me they spread them over a beautiful pond," she said in the voice of an only child on the loss of an only parent. But then she laughed. "Your grandmother would have had a royal fit-you know how she detested water." Her words were a water color of love and filial confusion drawn from a time in her childhood I know little about, chilly nights in the 1940s spent huddled with her ostra- cized mother on a damp tarp under western skies while the dogs barked and the sheep bleated. "Dale," she confessed, "it was about time your grand- mother learned to swim."</page><page sequence="4">Dale Rigby 145 Five years later, no doubt against her wishes, I decided to be my grand- mother's marker. My brother and I drove for what seemed miles through the pleasant, pancake-flat grounds of the Toledo Memorial Park until we came to Acacias Lake. It was a peaceful enough spot, free of the algae you find in lakes where the living commune. There were ducks everywhere enjoying the rain. Worms were underfoot. My brother and I shared a laugh that bounced off the sober headstones. Gramma Grayce frequently told our mother, "I-don't-want-to-be-with-the- worms." I think she hated worms like a rancher does wolves. Raised west of the hundredth meridian, that divide between twenty inches of annual rainfall and the great American desert, worms were symbols of the frontiers precarious hubris for my grandmother. Where were they when you needed them? In 1875, her grandfather, L.D. Burtt, who'd already lost a yçung man's fortune in the gold rush, had driven a herd of 17,000 sheep from Mexico to Montana, affording him a commemorative mention in Great Pioneers of Montana. This old hagiography fails to mention L.D. Burtt s propensity for gambling this fortune back and forth across the saloons of the Big Sky. My grandmother loved remembering the time her Grandpa Burtt saddled her onto his palomino for safekeeping while he snuck around back to get a nip. He returned to find his three-year-old granddaughter smartly leading that palomino halfway to the next watering hole. Which is where her story stopped. My grandmother never did get around to talking much about how L.D. Burtt's son, her own father, called his granddaughter a bastard child. She went from owning her own horses to tending somebody else's sheep. But that's a strongbox my grandmother locked long before I knew her. My brother recalls that the day before she died she called him over to her bed and whispered, "Barry, help me die." My younger brother, my family's custodian, squeezed Gramma Grayce s hand and cried. I am the family chronicler, always, it seems, at a book's remove. My grandmother bequeathed her books to me, careful to place her 1971 first-edition copy of Wallace Stegner s Angle of Repose on top of the lot. Literally, the angle of repose is geological argot for that angle at which loose rock can defy grav- ity's pull. But my grandmother wasn't above seeing its emotional calculus. In all that epic novel's western sprawl of 522 pages, she marked precisely two passages. A leather bookmark directed me to page 200, where the sixty-five- year-old protagonist, who is researching a book about the topographies of his grandparents' frontier marriage, explains how he endures the fate of being painfully wheelchair-bound:</page><page sequence="5">146 Fourth Genre Occasionally I have these moments, not often. There is nothing to do but sit still until they pass. Tantrums and passions I don't need, endurance is what I need. I have found that it is even possible to take a certain pleasure out of a submission to necessity. That have I borne, this can I bear also. "Well, what do you want to tell her?" asked my brother, as though that were the most natural question in the world. I shuffled and squished a worm to bide some time. Barry was a baby that Halloween I dressed up as Daniel Boone. After laughing at my coonskin cap, Gramma Grayce took my hand and led me into her bedroom, which was full of the owls - figurine owls, toy owls, stuffed owls - we grandchildren had already, and would later still, spring for each and every Christmas. There, at the foot of her bed, she eased me, for the first time, onto her saddle. The saddle. L.D. Burtt's old turtle of a saddle. That saddle took my grandmother through the Depression. She rode for the FBI, leaning into the cruel chinook winds of Montana's vast steppes (did they call her agent Burtt?). That saddle was her pillow on many a moonless, nocturnal stakeout, listening, I imagine, to the owls, waiting to nab a rustler or a claim jumper (or a bootlegger?). That saddle was all she claimed-and not a stitch more-when she deserted, after a decade of unhappiness, her first and only husband, a hardscrabbled Butte butcher much her senior. My grandmother hid her past behind a western badge, a woman pledged to secrecy. The little she ever divulged to me about either the FBI or her painful, arranged marriage was slipped into a story about that saddle. One thing wasn't a secret, though, to either of us that Halloween: sitting on that saddle made me feel like Daniel Boone in a way that wearing that coonskin cap from Woolworth s did not. I didn't answer my brother s question that day by the lake with the ducks and the worms. The funeral folks would say that I lacked a proper "mem- ory picture." They had even offered my mother the option of keeping her mother's ashes in "perpetual care." III. From this land that was his I heft this rock. Here on this grave I put it down. - William Stafford, For the Grave of Daniel Boone</page><page sequence="6">Dale Rigby 147 The clouds hung low and pregnant over eastern Missouri in the late fall of 1998. A steady warm autumnal rain fell and drained over the banks of the Femme Osage. I sloshed through, and then a mile east of, Marthasville, Missouri (pop. 674), inching across two one-lane bridges before turning into Daniel Boone Monument Road, an incongruously fine piece of pave- ment that dipped for another mile like a well-manicured fairway. Then I saw the corrugated white sign, its letters black and listing, worse for the rust, stuck into a small hillside: Daniel Boone Monument. There was a spit of a turnout big enough for maybe four cars, its ruts thatched into mud grass by wet autumn leaves. The monument was erected in 1915 by Boone heirs and the Missouri Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution, hoping to open some legislative purse strings. This group must have donated the handrail, too. It was broken. My first impression after climbing a set of steep, cracked, concrete steps was that any legislative largess had stopped at the blacktop. Cows milled twenty feet to my right, restrained by a split rail fence circling the graveyard. The worms, as though called to the surface to herald my visit, looked everywhere ripe and fat off the hog. I raised my umbrella and sat down on a warped wooden bench that wouldn't fetch a quarter at a garage sale, my back to the monument, and looked through the mist to the east at a huge combine parked just off the sheen of Daniel Boone Monument Road, no doubt working the adjacent farm of one Walter Stemme. Stemme owns the graveyard, too, and I was told by one source that "that farmer did something to make sure that graveyard never goes back to the state ofMissourah."Back in 1988, the state of Missouri, thinking that "a reg- istered historic site would be a real 'boon' to the area," allocated $35,000 for that purpose. Stemme said he was willing to donate the old graveyard. But trouble arose over the price of an acre needed for a parking lot, when Stemme demanded ten times its appraised value. Like a lot of farmers in the area, Stemme felt strong-armed when Missouri, without recompense, ran a statewide recreational project called the Katy Trail through his land. He could play hardball, too. I swiveled back to the Daniel Boone Monument. The sunwashed rock, eight feet high and four feet thick, is canopied by two smallish pine trees and fronted by a small flower patch enclosed in wilted wrought iron. The 1915 inscription is a Spartan accountant's ledger of the born-this-day-died- that-day-variety. Only its last line spoke to me, a clipped fragment reveal- ing an account partially in arrears: REMOVED TO FRANKFORT KY. 1845.</page><page sequence="7">148 Fourth Genre By 1845, Americans realized there were bucks in them bones. It was an age of sanctimonious commemoration. Hon. John Crittenden rode to Missouri that summer aboard the steamer Daniel Boone determined to exhume some famous bones, bankrolled by a $10,000 legislative allocation. Word of the Kentuckian s plans got out and soon thirty to forty Bryans (Rebecca s kin) and Boones were assembled at their family graveyard to hear out the Hon. John Crittenden. The graveyard was now owned by a Marthasville merchant named Harvey Griswold, who, reported a contemporary source, had walked as a young man, "all the way from St. Louis carrying his wardrobe and all the property he possessed tied up in a cotton handkerchief." Griswold rose from clerk to owner of the store and had recently petitioned the Missouri legis- lature to allocate $500.00 in order to build a memorial to Daniel Boone on the farm he'd just paid an exorbitant price for. The historical record becomes sketchy here, but Hon. John Crittenden somehow convinced this frontier equivalent of a zoning commission that it was in their best interests to let him crate Daniel Boone s bones back to Kentucky for perpetual care. Kentucky didn't bother to take the gravestones. Frankfort had more grandiose plans. Maybe the crowd was greased. Griswold surely wasn't, though. Kentucky never did honor Hon. John Crittenden's pledge to compensate Griswold for the loss of his potential tourist revenue. Harvey Griswold reportedly returned from time to time to scavenge his graveyard for bits and pieces of bones Kentucky might have left behind, so he never backfilled the graves. The stones eventually fell over and cracked. ■ ■ ■ It was a half-hour drive east from Walter Stemme's farm to the Daniel Boone Home. I knew the gravestones were loaned to the Daniel Boone Home by Central Methodist College, in Fayette, Missouri, for a spell in the early 1970s, though, like with so much of their legacy, I would never dis- cover why the loan wasn't permanent. How they got to Fayette in the first place is equally hazy. Sometime between 1879 and 1885 - nobody knows exactly when - either "one of Boone's grandchildren" (maybe William S. Bryan), or else "a good Methodist friend," - nobody really knows - donated the stones to the college. John Mack Faragher, the preeminent Boone biographer, wrote recently that the Daniel Boone Home "is visited by thousands each year, but over- hyped and undersupported." A tour bus was huffing out of the parking lot as I pulled in at 4:30, so the first point is conceded. I can't vouch for the hype</page><page sequence="8">Dale Rigby 149 or the financing, because, as it turned out, I never made it past the humble gift shop. The shop is sparsely shelved with the gimcracks and wampum you'd browse while stopping for an ice-cream cone in a Stuckey s Restaurant, the only watering hole on the long, hot drive between, say, Winnemucca and Last Chance, Nevada, circa 1965. There was, not surprisingly, no John Mack Faragher in stock. For a memento, I bought a slim brown volume of ama- teur history, A True , Brief History of Daniel Boone , to the cash register. "No," said an elderly woman, "we can't do credit cards, but if you want, the book author will sign it for you," and she pointed down the counter to an equally elderly fellow lost in some reading. Which is how I got to talk to Rolla and Gertrude Andrae, the octogenarian proprietors of the Daniel Boone Home since 1964, and Dean Andrae, their gregarious son. While Rolla was slowly signing my book, I asked the Andraes, "When did you folks get the Boone gravestones?" Bits and pieces of lore and litiga- tion swirled around the room in truths half-remembered and proprietary dreams half-realized. "That must have been, ten, twelve years ago," Gertrude underestimated by half. "Was when Dean was gone to California, wasn't it, Rolla?" I turned to Rolla and discovered that we had been joined by a ruddy man, looking to be maybe in his mid-forties, in blue jeans and Reebok hightops and car- rying his umbrella like a golf club. The Andraes carry their age very well. Their son, Dean, I would soon learn, is in his sixties. "How the hell did they get to Fayette? If I hadn't been in California they darn well wouldn't have tried it. Must have been twenty-five years ago they stole them," said Dean. "You are right Dean, but Mrs. Oliver was scared," said Rolla. "They called it a 'permanent loan.'" "Dean, Mrs. Oliver was crying," said Gertrude. "The president of the college called me right on the phone saying they were going to sue." Dean pooh-poohed that and then hit his stride. I stepped back and took notes. "They had no authority. William S. Bryan took those stones to Central Methodist in the 1880s to store'm, not to donate them to some darn church - none of the Boones or Bryans were ever Methodist. And there is no such thing as a 'permanent loan.' Those stones belong here where people can see'm." "I had to put a wooden cross on the back of the stones just so they would stand up-and some cement to fix the cracks," remembered Rolla.</page><page sequence="9">150 Fourth Genre Dean snorted. "That college never did take care of them - that's why we goťm in the first place - and Lillian Hayes Oliver was fifth generation right down the line. Those stones belong to the Boone heirs." "Dean, Mrs. Oliver was old and crying," repeated Gertrude. "I tell you, I gave'm a good going over when they came down from that church college," said Rolla. "They wanted me to help'm load up, but I gave'm a going over, a good going over." Dean walked me back to my car. "So you are a Boone relative." I thought that was funny. "Nah, nothing like that," I said, remembering that Rolla had asked me the same question. Gertrude had explained that over two hundred grandchildren laid a claim on Daniel Boone. "I just figured that was why you wanted to know about those stones," Dean admitted. ■ ■ ■ T. Berry Smith Hall is a buff-colored building with a tall spire, sitting since 1879 on the north end of the Central Methodist College campus. I signed in with the Natural History Museums curator, Tom Yancey, a tall, slender, unassuming artist and retired music professor, who was eager to show me the collection's amazing menagerie of taxidermy. A black vulture. A salmon- crested cockatoo. A passenger pigeon. A whip scorpion. A king penguin. A whooping crane. A nine-banded armadillo. Tom, only two years into his third career, beamed, talking about his plans for an upcoming show of nine- teenth-century original Booneslick art, including some George Caleb Binghams. I knew that the gravestones had been on display in the Educational Building at the 1904 Worlds Fair in St. Louis. There then followed years- nobody knows how many - fifty? maybe sixty? - when the museum was short on space and the "stones gathered dust in some out-of-the-way closet." By 1969, N.A. Brunda, then-president of the local historical society, had to haul a cast of a dinosaur footprint from atop the stones so he could right them for a local newspaper picture. My guess is that Brunda, embar- rassed by the anonymity the stones had acquired, negotiated their tempo- rary - and obviously contested - loan to the Daniel Boone Home. We came to a display case full of stuffed owls - long-eared owls, great horned owls, screech owls, burrowing owls, barn owls. Tom pointed to his pièce de résistance, a Great White Snowy Owl with a four-foot wingspan perched like a heraldic crest atop the museum's highest case. That is when I made my mistake. "I'm here, actually, to look at Daniel Boone's gravestone."</page><page sequence="10">Dale Rigby 151 Tom didn't take his eyes from the giant Snowy Owl. I could feel the music go out of the room. The curator had heard this before. He looked at me like I was one of those sad pilgrims who tithe the Church of the Latter Day Saints to trace their broodline. "Of course. . . you are another relative." The curator turned away to get back to work. "They are in that corner there over in the next room." IV. They are the abstracts and brief chronicles of the time: After your death you were better have a bad epitaph than ill repute while you live. - Hamlet I own what friends invariably see as a curious gap in the emotional résumé of a forty-year-old man - I haven't been to a funeral. Never. Ever. " How do you find closure ?" I am asked, fairly enough, about this quirk in my biography. I've demurred that I don't see closure in tiptoeing around an open casket, but this never flies. " But the funeral is for the living ," they claim, hinting that I've been defying more than the actuarial tables. Maybe I should ask them this: doesn't closure have to find its own form? Isn't that what I try to suggest to my students when they've drafted a com- monplace "grandmother essay?" Give us your grandmother when she was alive, I suggest, and then we will care that she is no longer so. Give us her morning instead of your mourning. Better a hag than a hagiography, I'd like to say. This advice can sound callous if not offered delicately enough, but the stakes are too high - both for our grandmothers and for our pedagogy: what hasn't been properly opened can't be properly closed, can it? ■ ■ ■ I made a phone call to a local historian named Mary Anne McVicker, who'd written her dissertation on gravestones in the Boonslick area of Missouri. "Those folks at the Daniel Boone Home sure did give them a good going over," said McVicker. "They weren't professionals," she said matter- of-factly, "and they cleaned the stones with something like Ajax that stripped away a layer of rock." I think McVicker, unlike Dean Andrae or Tom Yancey, thought I was a fellow historian, not some tenth-generation Boone heir, and she got excited by my esoteric interest. "You need to go to the Jewel Cemetery in Columbia," she said, "to see what those stones really looked like. Go see Angelina Hardin."</page><page sequence="11">152 Fourth Genre It was eerie to realize that I'd driven obliviously past the Jewel Cemetery scores of times. Thousands of cars do the same every day. The cemetery is surrounded by a four-foot stone wall, dating from 1840, forty-five yards square, in deceptively clear view one hundred yards from the rush of a four- lane thoroughfare, bordered to the south by a modern apartment complex, and to the west and north by a trailer court. A marker explains that Jewel Cemetery is a state historic site. Missouri law mandates that the graves of all former governors not in "perpetual care cemeteries" must be maintained, and Charles Henry Hardin, the state's twenty-second governor (1875-77), is buried here. Fifteen yards past the corpse gate, I found Angelina Hardin's cold, weathered headstone. Three feet high, the stone is recognizably human in shape. A round head the size of a pie pan sits atop a disproportionately small neck, and the slope of gentle shoulders taper into a flat body without definition. Green moss grew from the rock like aged liver spots. The anthropomorphic style is of African ori- gin. Angelina's stone, like those of Daniel and Rebecca Boone, was likely carved by family slaves. There are over forty unmarked graves - slave graves - clustered in weaving rows toward the back of Jewel Cemetery, near where an American flag hung proudly from its trailer park front porch. ■ ■ ■ After finally seeing the Boone gravestones, I felt like I'd sold myself a bill of goods. I saw "in the corner there over in the next room" what curator Tom Yancey seemed to be seeing: a couple of cracked old rocks in a cheap, out- of-the-way display case perfectly consonant with the anonymity deserved by a couple of cracked old rocks. I thought of boondoggled Harvey Griswold buying the farm only because it was where Daniel B O O N had bought the farm, too. ■ ■ ■ "The earliest in situ gravestone in the Booneslick area," the historian McVicker taught me, but she failed to mention the chills I would get lay- ing my hands on the gravestone while bending down to read the inscrip- tion: Here lie the remains of Angelina Hardin. She was born August 5, 1822. And died February 10, 1823. ■ ■ ■ The other passage my grandmother underlined in Angle of Repose comes on page 222. Stegner was going for pathos, but he didn't know my</page><page sequence="12">Dale Rigby 153 grandmother, the mother of a bastard child. Pathos, like her FBI badge, belonged in a strongbox. That I have home, this can I bear also. At the last glimpse of love between protagonists destined to live forty years without another trace of married tenderness, Stegner describes the husband holding a pair of reins between Denver and Deadwood: "He took them in his left hand and put his right hand around her and they rode like lovers." My grand- mother s annotation sounds sharp enough to have let the air out of the nearby Leadville mine. "The person driving sits on the right side of the vehicle." I, more prone to the coonskin tale, want to naysay this exhumation. How much easier to stoke from her ashes the epitaph of an Annie Oakley, a Rosie the Riveter, a sublime shepherdess, or even a husband deserter. But, like Daniel Boone, she wouldn't want to be caught dead in any of those coonskin caps. I-don't-want-to-be-with-the-worms. And, lest her grandson had- n't learned his lesson one Halloween thirty years before, she bequeathed to me some closure of our own fashioning: Here lie the reins of Gray ce Hardy Burtt. She was born Nov. 16, 1906. And died Nov. 9, 1993. ■ ■ ■ When my mother called me in Iowa six years ago to say that my grand- mother "wouldn't be getting out of bed again," she told me a tale from the hospital that my grandmother would own. "Do you know where you are?" the young nurse asked politely, fussing over the pillow of the old, dying woman. My grandmother's chest was shrunken and her legs were swollen to four times their normal size. But she knew when a pat-down was a put-down. Gramma Grayce, back in L.D. Burtt s saddle for one last ride, reared herself up-it was all in the eyebrows- like Scrooge on ten-foot stilts. The nurse hushed. She spoke in an august yet twinkling clip. "I may be an old fogy, but I'm not an old foggy." The old woman's eyes were now bright as an owl's. She was going to have some fun on her last stand. "I'm in the Flower Hospital. This is the third time I've been here, and I never wanted to come in the first place, thank you." The nurse recovered her composure, but she didn't understand that the power balance in that hospital room had shifted. "Well, Mrs. Burtt, do you know what holiday is coming up?" Here my mother broke the narrative spell, probably reliving for a moment what it was like to grow up the sole child of a single mother who wasn't exactly the kind of mother a daughter trusted at a PTA meeting. "What could Halloween possibly mean to your grandmother, Dale?" I could</page><page sequence="13">154 Fourth Genre have told my mother about Daniel Boone and what Halloween still means to me, but I waited instead for her to finish the story. My mothers fears were unfounded. "Yes," winked my indomitable grandmother, taking the nurse gently to task, "it is almost Election Day. And that used to be a holiday, too, young lady." Indeed it was, Mrs. Burtt. Indeed it was. From that Halloween, when I trick-or-treated as Daniel Boone sans a coonskin cap, you've taught me the value of appreciating what was before indulging in what we'd like to be. Touching the headstone of Angelina Hardin, I saw Daniel Boone's head- stone without the exhumations and the restorations. Here was the past treated with integrity by the present. You can have your Daniel Boones. I am an heir of Grayce Hardy Burtt. 'm'</page></plain_text>
