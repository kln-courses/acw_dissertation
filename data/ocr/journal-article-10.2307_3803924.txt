<plain_text><page sequence="1">Secular morality, village law, and Buddhism in Tibetan societies Fernanda Pirie University of Oxford Contrary to assumptions frequently made about Buddhist societies and to models promoted by Tibetan elites, not all Tibetans understand their religion in an ethical way. This article demonstrates that, for a community of villagers in Ladakh, Buddhism is not a source of moral guidance nor is it regarded by them as providing authority for the exercise of political or judicial power. Comparing the findings of ethnographers elsewhere in the Tibetan region, it is apparent that many Tibetans regard the cosmos and its inhabitants as having little relevance for the moral order of their community or its political organization. It is suggested that such understandings have a profound effect on local understandings of the ambit and significance of Buddhism and on the course of its assimilation in the region. Many anthropological studies of Tibetan1 communities place the practices and prin? ciples of Buddhism at the heart of their analyses of social forms. This is entirely con- sistent with the idea which is promoted by Tibetan elites and accepted by most of the laity that religious principles are of universal and encompassing significance. Such principles include moral schemes, most notably the cthree poisons' of anger, jealousy, and ignorance said to underlie all immoral behaviour. In this article I describe a Ladakhi community in which the people are strong adherents of Tibetan Buddhism and have unequivocally accepted the idea of karma but who do not regard their reli? gion as a source of moral guidance. Moral judgements, including the condemnation of anger and antagonism, are frequently heard in the village and underlie its political and judicial organization. These are not, however, regarded as being based upon the dictates of Buddhism. The villagers do not understand Buddhism in an ethical way. During the course of its development in Tibet, Buddhism has assimilated a multi- tude of local deities and rituals (Kapstein 2000; Snellgrove &amp; Richardson 1968; Stein 1972 [1962]; Tucci 1980), and the Ladakhi villagers regard the spirits of their locality as being responsible for their fortunes - even more directly than are the deities of the Buddhist pantheon. Nevertheless, their condemnation of violence is not based on any idea that conflict disturbs the cosmos and its inhabitants. They regard anger as neither contravening the moral principles of Buddhism nor offending the inhabitants of the spirit world. Such findings cast doubt on the uncritical assumptions, apparent in many 7 Roy. Anthrop. Inst. (N.S.) \i, 173-190 ? Royal Anthropological Institute 2006</page><page sequence="2">1 74 Fernanda Pirie writings on the Tibetan region, that religious principles are relevant to the analysis of social forms. Nor can cosmological concerns unquestioningly be assumed to provide a foundation for social practices. My suggestion, in this article, is that these two issues are related. Buddhism in Tibet Buddhism was initially introduced into Tibet through the political patronage of the emperors Songsten Gampo and Trisong Detsen in the seventh and eighth centuries. It was imported from India as an already developed set of religious ideas and texts (Kapstein 2000; Lopez 1997:10). Buddhism introduced a new theory of morality, based on the notion of virtues and vices (Macdonald 1971: 369, 387). This supplanted earlier Tibetan myths, which suggested an anthropomorphic connection between the cosmos and the order ofthe world through the mediation ofthe kings. It did not entirely elim- inate such ideas, however (Macdonald 1971: 295, 354). The collapse of the early Tibetan empire in the ninth century was followed by a period of political fragmentation, during which religious establishments and practi? tioners engaged in a succession of political rivalries and struggles. These culminated in the dominance of the Gelukpa sect and supremacy of the Dalai Lamas' regime over central Tibet in the sixteenth to seventeenth centuries (Kapstein 2000). The doctrine of harmony between politics and religion (chos srid zung ybrel) was of fundamental importance to the legitimacy of this regime.2 Dreyfus suggests that this principle provided 'a social framework that makes sense of some of the most particular characteristics of Tibetan culture', such as the political dominance of reli? gious groups (1995: 118). Legal documents refer to the respective religious and civil duties of monks and peasants (chos dang srid kyi khrims) (Schuh 1984a: 227), and the legal codes used in Lhasa until the mid-twentieth century, the zhal lee bcu drug/bcu gsum, claimed to be based upon the 'sixteen pure human rules' (mi chos gtsang ma bcu drug) (the mi chos) (Schuh 1984b; Sorensen 1994: 35). These moral rules were attrib? uted to Songsten Gampo, although they were almost certainly developed later by Tibetan leaders seeking religious legitimation for their rule (Kapstein 2000: 56-8; Uray 1972: 59). The moral rules of Buddhism were, thus, intrinsic to the political and legal legiti? macy of the central Tibetan polity. The mi chos, along with the 'three poisons' (dug gsum) and the ten prohibitions (mi dge ba bcu), also contain practical injunctions for the daily lives of the religion's adherents, promising karmic consequences for obser? vance and breach. The idea that misfortune could be related to cosmological distur- bance remained strong, however. According to one sixteenth-century text a Buddhist prophesy indicated that conflict, misery, disease, and famine would arise when merit was exhausted, and that this conflict would, in turn, disturb the elemental spirits, causing further destruction (Akester 2001). In a complex and well-known analysis, Ortner (1978; 1989) describes the way in which Buddhist divinities and rituals provide models for the social problems of Sherpa society. Inspired by Geertz's (1973) description of religion as a cultural system, she argues that through its rituals 'the Buddhist modes of seeing, feeling, interpreting, cat- egorizing, and so forth, ... are constantly and systematically fed into lay experience' (1978:162).3 In a similar way, French, in her anthropological study of law in Tibet, pre? sents the cosmology of Buddhism, in particular the religious morality said to under- lie its ancient legal codes, as being the foundation of the Tibetan legal system and the /.

She claims that this moral view represents 'the layman's perspective: the daily operation of the law ... as understood by individual Tibetans' (1995:15). Both authors have been critiqued for over-interpreting their material in line with Buddhist doctrine (Huber 1998; Ramble 1980), and other writers have been criticized for unduly emphasizing orthodox ideals over ritual practice (Lopez 1997). The impres- sion still remains in much of the literature, however, that Buddhism 'is dominant both from religious and socio-political points of view' in Tibetan societies (Dreyfus 1995: 119) and that the religious realm, albeit an eclectic and heterogeneous one, is funda? mental to the shape of the ctotal social whole'. Samuel uses this phrase in his wide- ranging work on Tibetan Buddhism, talking of the 'cultural patterns' supplied by the religion (1993: 362). He suggests that: For Tibetans, the vocabulary and modes of thinking deriving from Indian Buddhism came to pervade many areas of experience that we do not necessarily think of as 'religious', while the concerns of Tibetan folk religion, such as the maintenance of good luck and good fortune, continue to underlie virtually all facets of life (1993: 4). Samuel is, here, distinguishing orthodox Buddhism, that ofthe texts, from folk or local ritual practices. Describing the latter, Stein asserts that the 'religious beliefs' ofthe 'folk religion' are integral to codes of social behaviour (1972 [1962]: 192), while Mills, drawing on fieldwork in Ladakh, talks of peasant consciousness being 'explicitly articulated in terms of highly elaborate hierarchies of local and household deities' (2003: 344). This article demonstrates that in a Ladakhi village the ideologies of Buddhism have not been assimilated into the local moral universe. The villagers do not invoke Buddhist moral injunctions in their condemnation of individual anger and aggres? sion. It is not just that the religion has taken a local form, however, 'involuting' into the regularities of local society (Spiro 1982 [1970]: 178), and losing the force of its moral ideas in the process. This would not be an unfair characterization of religious assimi? lation in Ladakh (Mills 2003: 319-24); my argument goes further. The Ladakhi villagers I describe understand their moral universe in a fundamentally non-cosmological way. They regard conflict as a threat to the survival of their community but they do not associate such disorder with either Buddhist principles or disturbance to the cosmos. Neither the deities and practices of Buddhism nor the pantheon of local spirits are implicated in their sphere of moral concerns or in the structures and prac? tices that they have developed to control conflict and maintain order within their community. Ladakh As a mountainous part of the high Tibetan plateau, Ladakh has always supported a sparse population (now around 230,000) grouped into relatively small villages sepa- rated by acres of pasture and waste-land. Before the construction of motor roads in the twentieth century, Photoksar, the village in which I carried out fieldwork, was a week's journey from the capital, Leh.4 After the collapse of the early Tibetan empire members of a powerful Tibetan family established a political base and, ultimately, a kingdom in Ladakh. This remained largely independent until the 1840s, despite incursions from both Kashmir and Tibet. The kings established a small endogamous upper class whose members acted as their 7 Roy. Anthrop. Inst. (N.S.) 12,173-190 ? Royal Anthropological Institute 2006</page><page sequence="4">176 Fernanda Pirie political administration. These aristocrats were given responsibility for collecting taxes from the villages and mobilizing the population for war, but their main duties were to support the administration of the king's household, lands, and armies. Their legal and administrative control over the villages remained light, especially those in the remoter areas. In 1843 the Ladakhi kingdom submitted to the power of Dogras, then rulers of Kashmir, and in 1846 the region was incorporated into the British Empire. There was some administrative development during this period but the main experience of the Photoksar villagers was of an increase in taxation. The Land Settlements (Muhammad 1908) indicate that throughout Ladakh villages affairs were run by locally appointed headmen. The administration of post-independence India has seen the substantial abolition of taxes and the introduction of roads, schools, healthcare, and a market economy. Many villages remain remote from modern developments and the attentions of government officials, however, and agriculture, irrigation, social, and ritual life con? tinue to be organized locally. Buddhism in village Ladakh Over the centuries the kings established themselves as protectors of Buddhism and as ritual guarantors of security and prosperity (Ribbach 1986: chap. 7; Schwieger 1997: 427). They also founded and patronized Buddhist monasteries, but, particularly after the Ladakhi-Tibetan war of the 1680s, Tibetan monasteries and monks exercised con? siderable influence over their Ladakhi counterparts. The Gelukpa school was originally powerful in the region, but from the sixteenth century the Drukpa Kargyud school flourished under royal patronage.5 Each village is affiliated to one or more of the major monasteries, and these send caretaker monks to the dependent village temples. Both Lamayuru, which belongs to the Drigunpa Kargyud sect, and Hemis, the principal Drukpa monastery in Ladakh, maintain a temple in Photoksar. The monks they send perform monthly household purifications, rites associated with life-cycle events, and rites connected with the agri? cultural season and local festivals. The higher monks, the lamas (bla ma), visit the vil? lages occasionally, sometimes giving teachings in the form of a recitation of Buddhist texts, and their injunctions to the people are accorded the utmost respect. For example, a sustained campaign directed by the highest monks of the region in the late twenti? eth century finally persuaded the villagers to replace their biannual animal sacrifices with theologically approved purification rituals. Buddhism lays down stringent criteria for the lives of monastic practitioners, and older lay people often undertake periods of abstinence. The privileged might even be able to undertake a meditative retreat for a number of weeks or go on pilgrimage to the monastic centres of India. However, the religion is not seen as making many requirements of daily life for the laity. There are several annual prayer readings in Pho? toksar to which most of the literate men contribute, but apart from the constant spin- ning of prayer wheels by members of the older generations, daily practice primarily consists of prostrations and short mantras in the mornings and evenings and mainte? nance of offering bowls in the shrine rooms. While unquestioningly accepting the importance of the monastic centres, the village people generally regard the majority of Buddhist practice as being the preserve of specialists. The intellectual content of the religion is regarded by even literate villagers as being obscure, esoteric, and hardly com- prehensible. To be efficacious the texts simply need to be read, ideally by monks, not necessarily understood. The villagers send their sons to the monasteries and support /. Roy. Anthrop. Inst.

The Buddhist deities have been incorporated into the villagers' cosmological world, but in superior and distant positions compared to the spirits ofthe locality, which have a much more immediate influence on daily life. The quotidian world incorporates a pantheon of local spirits, lha (lha), many of whom are not recognized by orthodox Buddhist practitioners. Prominent among these is the village deity, theyul lha (yul lha), who has a physical presence in his shrine overlooking the village, from where he offers protection to the villagers and their livestock but also poses dangers to babies, new mothers, and married women. Protection is also provided by the household gods and a host of minor spirits associated with springs, fields, and the household hearth. These are generally benign but need to be treated with respect.6 Outside the boundaries of the village, and often encroaching upon it, is a chaotic world of nameless, dangerous numina, ranging from hungry ghosts to the spirits that cause sickness, accidents, and death. The power of the protectors, who have been co-opted onto the side of the vil? lagers, constantly has to be invoked against these evil influences. Propitiation of the lha is performed daily. There is a constant offering of food and there are periodic veneration ceremonies, biannual rites at the shrines of the village and household gods, purifications at the springs, and major exorcist ceremonies at the new year festival. Serious illnesses require the intervention of the yul lha, who is summoned to possess the village spirit medium. Powerful and, therefore, dangerous exorcisms of the evil spirits are performed by the onpos (dpon po). These are ritual practitioners, the most skilled of whom are capable of performing 'strong' rites other? wise only undertaken by monks of the 'unreformed' Nyingma sect. In most villagers' eyes there is no real divide between Buddhism and other forms of ritual practice. Their cosmological concerns are dominated by the practical need to ensure physical fortune, fertility, and the biological continuity ofthe community. Local monks perform many exorcist rituals, and the onpos consider these practices to be part of their religious activities. The villagers regard the Buddhist deities as supreme cos? mological beings with the greatest power to deal effectively with their troublesome evil spirits. Their attitude to ritual activities is largely pragmatic: if the local monks will not perform the necessary rites to secure their protection, then the villagers call in the skilled onpos, who will. As Gellner (2001) points out, it is modernist religious leaders who insist most strongly on the division between 'proper' and 'improper' practices and between deities who should be venerated and those regarded as mere 'helpers'. This distinction was also insisted upon by my monk informants in Ladakh, who emphasize and promote the performance of 'proper' Buddhist rituals. It does, therefore, make sense to talk of two forms or poles of religious practice, 'Buddhist' and 'non-Buddhist'. These have developed in tandem, however, and form a single religious or cosmologi? cal sphere for the villagers. The Ladakhi village Village politics To be a member of a Ladakhi village means to belong to one of its households insofar as these are the basic property-owning and tax-paying units of the community. Agri? culture, water rights, and village obligations are allocated to the household, and village meetings have to be attended by at least one man from each. Despite differences in 7 Roy. Anthrop. Inst. (N.S.) 12,173-190 ? Royal Anthropological Institute 2006</page><page sequence="6">1 78 Fernanda Pirie wealth, they are all treated equally in these matters. Most of the forty Photoksar house? holds still depend almost exclusively on their crops and livestock for subsistence. There are no members of either the small aristocratic class nor the lower classes of black- smiths and musicians in Photoksar, as is the case in many villages. Social relations between the villagers are represented in the dral go (gral mgo), the hierarchical lines into which people organize themselves to sit or dance on every social occasion. Out? siders and monks take the top seats but among the villagers only the onpo, the astrologer, and the amchi (Am ci), the practitioner of Tibetan medicine, are accorded any superior status. Beneath them the rest of the villagers take their places in the men's or the women's line solely according to age. The nominal leader of the village is the headman. He controls the village funds, rep? resents the village vis-d-vis outsiders, organizes meetings, and ensures that everyone is aware of the astrologer's directions concerning the timing of agricultural processes. His post is, however, regarded as a burden rather than a privilege and it rotates annu- ally between the households, as does that of his principal assistant, regardless of the competence of the men in the house available to take it on. In practice, the power of the headman is also limited by the fact that all important and innovative decisions are taken at the village meeting, a forum attended by all the adult men. It is these men, the yulpa (yul pa), who constitute the ultimate political authority of the village, exercising considerable control over the community and its members. They take decisions about village taxes, the water rotation, and the creation of new rules. Their meetings are relatively informal and are attended by all men who wish to come. A ballot may be taken, with one vote counted from each household, but this is rarely necessary because in practice consensus is almost always reached. Conflicting opinions may initially be expressed but people let an agreement emerge. Certain men attend more meetings than others, some are more vocal, and some are listened to more respectfully, but afterwards the influence of such individuals is never acknowledged. When they discuss and recount the events of the meeting around the stove they always report what 'we' agreed, and written records invariably stress the fact of agreement between the yulpa. The procedure of the meeting and the rhetoric of agreement expressly deny lingering differences of opinion. Neither the onpo nor the amchi, who both enjoy social status in the village, have any particular influence over village politics. The dral go, in which their positions are socially recognized, is not used in village meetings, thus symbolically denying any sig? nificance to their status amongst the yulpa.7 The local monks do not take any part in these meetings and do not attempt to exercise any influence on such affairs even if they are, themselves, from village families. Their religious status actually disqualifies them from membership of this body. There is never any appeal to the monasteries or higher lamas to make or legitimate political or judicial appointments or decisions. The process of Buddhist assimilation in Tibet is generally presented as one involving the subjugation of local deities and their transformation into protectors of Buddhism (Lopez 1997: 6). Mills (2003: 344-5) argues that the Buddhist system of authority is consequently grounded locally in the ideas of subjugation and the incarceration of powerful chthonic forces. Such ideas might found the religious status of the ritual practitioners but in Photoksar their authority has not been allowed to extend into the political, judicial, and moral spheres. The headman is honoured, along with his assistant, the onpo, and the amchi, during dances held at the new year and spring festivals. There is much invocation of local /. Roy. Anthrop. Inst.

The spirits are not, however, implicated in the dances which honour these men. Elsewhere in the Tibetan region village headmen and other officers are appointed by using dice or other methods of chance, which, in some cases, is explained as allowing the spirits to express their preferences (Goldstein 1989: 178). In eastern Tibet local deities support structures of power and are appealed to in the event of battles, feuds, trading journeys, and business ventures (Sagant 1990). However, in other areas, includ? ing Ladakh, the spirits are in no way implicated in the systems of rotation or chance used to select leaders (Pirie 2005a; Ramble 1993). Elaborate processes used by villagers in Mustang to select their headmen, along with their village constitution and written laws, have been described by Ramble as a form of'civil religion' (in press: chaps 9-10). The equivalent processes in Photoksar are far less elaborate but they can also be regarded as civil rituals to which the activities of the cosmos are marginal. Political and judicial control within the village is simply exer- cised by 'us', the yulpa. Their authority is based on a rhetoric of unity and inclusive- ness within a group of equal individuals. It is not supported by any religious or cosmological ideas, either notions of divine sanction or notions of ritual efficacy.8 Management of conflict The apparent irrelevance of the cosmological realm to the organization of village pol? itics is matched by indifference towards conflict on the part of the lha. These numina are ever-present in village life, directly implicated in physical fortunes and fertility; the villagers are constantly appeasing them with food offerings and taking care to avoid polluting their shrines. However, it seems not to matter to any of the numina, evil or benign, whether the villagers live harmonious or disordered lives. This is most evident in the villagers' attitudes towards conflict and practices of conflict resolution. Clashes of interests frequently occur within the village, and if a disagreement develops into a quarrel it quickly becomes the talk of the village. Overt antagonism is regarded as a problem for the whole community. Family and neighbours initially tend to intervene, then a mediator may be summoned, and, if all else fails, the headman or yulpa may be called upon. There is a strong emphasis on reconciliation and in all cases good relations must be restored by agreement. Overt antagonism is regarded as undesirable, even dangerous, for the whole community, and underlying the villagers' attitudes and discourse is a strong sense ofthe importance of village unity. There is, however, never any suggestion that conflict angers the lha or disturbs the cosmos. When I tried to ask about the spirits in the context of conflict or processes of dispute resolution people would simply look at me as if I had failed to understand a basic point. 'No, this does not concern the lha\ was the normal response.9 One dispute arose between Rigzin, whose household was under the annual obliga- tion to protect the barley fields from the livestock, and another woman, who com- plained that her crops had been eaten by the passing sheep and goats. An audible quarrel ensued which drew the attention of other women out in the fields. It was gen? erally agreed that Rigzin had been at fault in escalating the quarrel and the headman went to secure an apology from her. This she refused and instead began berating him. Such insubordination was regarded as serious and her case was raised at the next village meeting. The yulpa agreed that Rigzin ought to apologize for the quarrel, but again she refused, so they decided on the ultimate threat of a social boycott. This drastic measure would effectively have excluded her household from all village activities, 7 Roy. Anthrop. Inst. (N.S.) 12,173-190 ? Royal Anthropological Institute 2006</page><page sequence="8">180 Fernanda Pirie making survival for her family practically impossible. Faced with this threat, Rigzin backed down, apologized, and went through a ceremony during which she presented a white scarf to the headman and offered yal, beer from a brass jug. This is a mark of respect used on all social occasions.10 The resolution of all conflict culminates in a form of explicit reconciliation, more or less elaborate depending on the severity of the case. Yal and white scarves are also used to honour the spirits, whose shrines are permanently bedecked with frayed and greying cloths. The lha are not, themselves, involved or invoked in any way during processes of dispute resolution, however. The reconciliation of conflict requires the restoration of harmony through the enactment of respect towards other villagers, not through rituals directed towards the spirits. Some anthropologists have suggested that there is a sense of cosmological order underlying the social and political structures of Ladakhi communities. Dollfus main? tains that the existence of the community is 'often defined by reference to either the village divinity or the gonpa [monastery]' and she links this to the 'strong sense of sol? idarity' within the village (1989:125). Likewise, Srinivas says that 'the symbolic unity of the village, ... the internal field of power and well-being, is affirmed in the presence of the god of the village' (1998: 90). While the principal yul lha is significant for all the Photoksar villagers, however, there is a second yul lha who protects a small cluster of houses out of sight of the shrine of the main lha. The unity marked by these spirits is, thus, a physical one. It does not extend to the entire social and political community. Village unity is, rather, defined by membership of one of the village households. Numerous sub-groups of households unite to conduct agricultural and ritual events, forming a web of cross-cutting ties which link the outlying households with those in the main cluster. The yul lha are, in fact, the principal symbolic marker of the separa? tion between the two physically distinct parts of the village. Several writers describe the ordering of the spirit world into three realms, within which humans are hierarchically placed in relation with the numina (Kaplanian 1981: 207; Mills 2003: 153-6; Phylactou 1989: 55; Riaboff 1997). This, they say, is reflected in the vertical hierarchy of the household. According to Dollfus (1989: 102), the spatial ordering of the world, in which east is superior to west and above to lower, is reflected in a sense of cosmological, hierarchical order running through Ladakhi life and expressed in seating plans, in language (the use of honorifics), in food, and in serving dishes. Whilst a certain hierarchy can be detected in such social structures it is not, however, the same as the harmony in inter-personal relations that the villagers take so seriously. Such harmony is threatened by acts of antagonism rather than disruption to social hierarchies. The cosmological realm, to the contrary, is overwhelmingly chaotic. It is a disor- dered universe teeming with a multitude of malevolent influences in constant battle with the stronger protectors but turning up unexpectedly to prey on the weak and unwary despite their best ritual endeavours. This world does not provide either a neat model of order towards which everyday life can be oriented or a template for the ideals of harmony and solidarity that apply to inter-personal relations. Whilst the local lha are overwhelmingly responsible for fertility and the biological continuity of the com? munity, it is a series of human relationships that defines the community as the place of social interaction. The order threatened by disputes is a human order of social rela? tions based on a host of complex relations between households and individuals which should ideally produce a peaceful, co-operative community. This order is, for the /. Roy Anthrop. Inst. (N.S.) 12,173-190 ? Royal Anthropological Institute 2006</page><page sequence="9">Fernanda Pirie 181 villagers, vital to the successful survival of their community but it is wholly uncon- nected to the activities of the lha. There is, therefore, a realm of inter-personal relations with which the lha are not concerned and a distinct sphere of activities which have cosmological consequences and affect physical fortunes. For the villagers the separation between the two is con? ceptualized simply as what does or does not concern the lha. The secular moral realm The villagers' social relations are underpinned by a clearly articulated set of moral con? cerns which support their control of conflict. Although the yulpa only comprise the men, women regularly express their views on village affairs around the stove and often dominate conversations in which inappropriate conduct is condemned. The women I spoke to were entirely in agreement with the yulpas attitudes towards Rigzin, for example. Both men and women voice a deep moral disapproval of arguing, quarrelling, fighting, and all forms of disruptive behaviour. Stirring up trouble and exhibiting anger are frowned upon. Disapproval is also expressed of those who fail to co-operate with others and those who are selfish or lazy. The villagers were initially reluctant to voice open criticism in front of me but after some months I began to detect the slight gesture, the frown, and the significance of the word tsokpo (btsog po) ('bad' or 'dirty'), which were employed to indicate moral disapproval. One morning during the busy agricul? tural period, the mother of the house I stayed in remained at home to host the local monk who was to perform a purification ritual. When he failed to arrive, the father called him Ihende (glen pa), a strong word meaning 'lazy'. Another time, out in the fields with the mother and daughter, I mentioned one of the most outspoken women in the village. She had always been kind and welcoming to me but the women shook their heads. 'No, she is tsokpo7, they told me firmly, 'she gets into too many quarrels'. Such moral judgements are all orientated towards the harmony of the community. There is never any reference to the Buddhist scheme of morality during such discus? sions, although the more literate villagers know the basic religious precepts. Moreover, the monks themselves offer very little moral direction to the villagers. They told me that even the higher lamas, when they visit the villages and give teachings, concentrate on the evils of killing, drinking alcohol, and smoking as well as on the necessity of reciting mantras and prayers, going on pilgrimage, and supporting the monasteries. These are activities that people understand as having karmic consequences, affecting the fate ofthe soul in the after-life.11 Drinking alcohol is much criticized, and wives regularly berate their drunken hus? bands in Photoksar. The rules of hospitality demand, however, that beer is brewed, offered, and drunk frequently and in very large quantities. The inconsistency between theory and practice was eventually acknowledged to me by one man. 'The problem with drinking', he told me, 'is that it makes some people feel tall and then they start arguing and fighting'. This - the disruption to social relations caused by the conse- quent quarrels - is the object of the effective moral disapproval of alcohol. The vil? lagers' attitude to adultery is similar. One man explained it as a common, although disapproved of, practice. But problems only arise when a child is born to an unmar? ried woman, he conceded. A common feature of these moral attitudes is an orienta? tion towards the community. Mere drunkenness and adultery can be ignored but fighting and unmarried mothers are a problem. To be proud or lazy or to stir up trouble tends to create tensions within the community and to disrupt social relations. It is 7 Roy. Anthrop. Inst. (N.S.) 12,173-190 ? Royal Anthropological Institute 2006</page><page sequence="10">182 Fernanda Pirie perceived consequences for the social order of the village, not any religious or cosmo? logical considerations, that are at the heart of local moral judgements. Morality and religion The moral universe of these villagers has a different basis from that found in certain Theravada societies, in which moral concerns are linked firmly to Buddhist principles (Spiro 1982 [1970]: 129,448). The cosmological world of Photoksar accords, rather, with Obeyesekere's model of a 'pre-literate' religion, one which is characterized by the absence of a notion of sin and 'an amoral religious ideology' (1968:12-14). Social action is judged according to a secular, rather than a religious, morality, and salvation beliefs correspondingly do not incorporate a conception of sin as violation of religious ethics. Whether or not Obeyesekere is right about the lack of a religious ethic in such cases, he points to an important separation between the secular morality that underpins the norms of social life and the ideas connected with ritual activity and the cosmos. Ftirer- Haimendorf's survey of non-Hindu peoples in South Asia supports this model: '[N]ot all religions provide supernatural support for moral prescriptions - we have seen that many tribal populations do not perceive any link between the cult of their gods and the observance ofthe moral code recognized by their society' (1967: 216). According to Obeyesekere it is primarily world religions that have 'ethicized' religious life, offering accounts of the supernatural which reinforce the demands of what comes to be con- strued as a religious morality (1968:12). The moral scheme of Tibetan Buddhism is explicitly linked to the religion's escha- tological theory. Under the law of karma an individual's moral activities in this life substantially determine his or her reincarnation in the next. What is significant about Photoksar, therefore, is that people maintain a secular morality despite their long con? version to Buddhism. They have accepted the law of karma and the idea that certain quotidian activities affect the fate of their souls in the afterlife. A different set of activ? ities are condemned as morally 'bad', however, in that they adversely affect the social order of the community. The reasons for this, I would suggest, lie in the distinctly phys? ical influence that villagers attribute to the inhabitants of the cosmological world and the indifference of the numina to the moral order of the community. The Buddhist deities have largely been assimilated by the villagers into their amoral cosmological world, while the principles of karma form a separate set of personal concerns. This contrasts with the Sherpa society described by Ortner (1978), in which Bud? dhist principles are presented as being deeply implicated, via local rituals, in all forms of social life. Fiirer-Haimendorf also describes Sherpa moral concepts as having been 'shaped by' the philosophy of Buddhism (1967: 181), but he draws an important dis? tinction between two forms of Sherpa morality. On the one hand, he says, certain reli? gious acts and sins directly affect a person's karma while, on the other, a different set of actions is considered to offend the interests of the community. The latter attract social sanctions rather than karmic consequences (1974: 550-1). Similar distinctions have been noted among Tibetan communities in Nepal (Levine 1981). Aziz is quite spe? cific about the duality of the moral schemes among Tibetan immigrants in Nepal. In the secular system, she says, 'goals are focussed on specific social ends related to values of co-operation and trust, whereas the Buddhist karmic system of morality operates in a supernatural sphere where justice is taken out of the hands of humans' (1981:12). This is a crucial distinction and underlies a significant separation between two ethical systems, the karmic and the secular, within the worlds of these different Tibetan groups. /. Roy. Anthrop.

As Mills says, 'Buddhist teachings are neces? sary because they precisely go against the daily tendencies and practices of their listeners, who will, more often than not, nod, smile, prostrate, leave and forget until the next time' (2003:165). These efforts lead to more or less successful syntheses and heterogeneous understandings, including the contradictory attitudes towards alcohol found in Photoksar. Spiritual pollution, drib (grib), to take another example, is widely regarded as arising after birth and death, negatively affecting relations between humans and spirits. In Photoksar the concept implies vulnerability to spirit attack: babies, mothers, and the family of a deceased have to avoid proximity to, and even sight of, shrines of power? ful protector deities lest they be struck by illness. The village concept is a pragmatic, cosmological one. Even the village amchi, who had received his medical training in a monastery and was familiar with many Buddhist precepts, shook his head over the explanations of my Tibetan dictionary which link drib with blood, oaths, chastity, and fighting (Das 1998 [1902]: 244). In Leh, both the monks and other educated informants were dismissive ofthe villagers' understandings, however. One monk told me that these were 'old forms' of drib which were not so relevant any more. What is important is the purification rituals, 'which make everything clear with the gods'. Monks from Lingshed monastery, not far from Photoksar, elaborated a complex theory of drib based on the idea of dislocation from a world in which divinities, the Buddha, and humans are in harmony (Mills 2003: chap. 8). Tibetans in Nepal also suggested to Christian Schicklgruber (1989) that drib can be caused by anger, which is a connection that conflates cosmological with moral ideas. The notion of drib is simultaneously, then, a cosmological concept with pragmatic significance for the Photoksar villagers and a complex concept with moral and religious significance for Tibetan elites. The concept of the disciplined, educated mind that is only achieved after long train? ing is also central to Buddhist theory. One Ladakhi monk told me that the Photoksar villagers do not receive enough teaching about Buddhist morality, as a result of which they have 'strong' minds and cannot control their anger. In Photoksar, on the other hand, people explained that the important distinction is between a large (also referred to as a 'soft') and a small ('strong') mind. People are patient and fearless or liable to anger and temerity accordingly. The implication is that the nature of one's mind and consequent emotional tendencies are given at birth. Anger and patience are also the subject of moral evaluation, so the local concept is itself somewhat paradoxical. When I raised this subject with the amchi, he, whilst agreeing with the local description, also told me that education, by which he meant knowledge of Buddhist texts, leads to a good mind and characterizes those who control their anger. He did not acknowledge the apparent contradiction between the Buddhist idea of knowledge as the foundation of proper conduct and the local idea of the biologically determined mind. Numerous practical and moral concerns of the laity are also the subject of ritual texts within the Buddhist canon. 'Idle speech' (ngag chal) is, for example, one of the 7 Roy. Anthrop. Inst.

There are also texts which concern gossip and jealousy, mi kha (Kapstein 1997: 527-37).13 Lopez presents several texts that address quotidian concerns of the laity with the object of correcting the image of Buddhism as 'a disembodied philosophy' (1997: 36). The extent to which the content of such texts penetrated lay consciousness is not clear, however; it may be that they existed primarily for recitation. Certain ideas - the pollution associated with birth and death, the evaluation of the mind and the dangers of gossip - are, therefore, connected by members of the elite with the principles of Buddhism and represent a combination of moral, judicial, and cosmological ideas. The same concepts retain an almost wholly pragmatic significance for the Photoksar villagers, however. The extent to which Buddhist principles are accepted and attributed with explanatory force is heavily dependent on context and constantly subject to negotiation. In his analysis of religious assimilation in Mustang, Ramble (in press: chap. 7) describes the incompatibility between aspects of the cults of territorial deities and the soteriological Buddhist creed. The villagers he describes do not, however, 'struggle with the problem of irreconcilable systems, but deal with the component fragments of these systems according to whether they are beneficial, harmful, salient or irrelevant'. As he says elsewhere, they do not treat Buddhism as an entire system, but rather use it as raw material, 'divisible stuff' which is employed in the construction or elabora- tion of the local tradition (1990: 194). It is similar, I would suggest, in Photoksar. The villagers associate the rites and deities of the Buddhist pantheon with their cosmological world, whose numina are primarily concerned with physical fortunes. The moral condemnation of drinking and adultery which is preached by the monks and the religious ideas ofthe mind understood by the amchi represent different systems of thought. These co-exist with and contradict but have not undermined local understandings. Elite understandings In the urban centres the continuing transformation of religious practice has been given a new impetus by the establishment of modern communications, which mean that monks and wealthy individuals can easily travel to Dharamsala and other centres of Buddhist learning to hear the teachings of senior lamas. The Dalai Lama, in particu? lar, deplores 'non-Buddhist' spirit veneration and promotes a morally based form of Buddhism. At the same time organizations like the Maha Bodhi Society distribute short, readable texts within Ladakh concerning Buddhist principles. Some young development workers were reading these when they visited Photoksar. They dispar- aged the villagers, to me, as 'ignorant', attributing their lack of co-operation with a new project to drinking alcohol, which, they said, was a sign of 'bad minds'. At the same time, however, even the most educated Ladakhis retain a reverence for their religious texts which places them beyond the realm of practical relevance. Young people would typically express reluctance to explain religious principles to me, referring instead to the monks or elders who 'knew' them better.14 Even for these groups the Buddhism of the texts remains esoteric. Even in Leh, however, methods of conflict resolution are structured around prag? matic, rather than religious, ideals of harmony. Despite the development of legal systems under the Dogras and after Indian independence, informal practices remain important. Leh itself is organized as a series of villages with local headmen while water /. Roy. Anthrop. Inst. (N.S.) 12,173-190 ? Royal Anthropological Institute 2006</page><page sequence="13">Fernanda Pirie 185 officials supervise the distribution of this scarce resource and are responsible for the resolution of the frequent disputes that arise in the summer. Time and again infor? mants described the ways in which such disputes were resolved, often with the help of family and friends, in terms very similar to those used in Photoksar. They stressed the interests of the wider community and the undesirability of conflict without making any reference to religious or cosmological concepts. An alternative to the official courts has also been established by the Ladakhi Bud? dhist Association (LBA), a local political organization that rose to power in the 1980s and 1990s at the time of agitation for regional autonomy (van Beek &amp; Bertelsen 1997). Its mediation service, the Shakhs Khang (gshags khang, literally 'house of settlement'), hears cases from both Leh and the villages that the headmen and other local media- tors have been unable to resolve themselves. Marital problems and inheritance and land disputes are heard by three senior members of the association, who adopt prag? matic attitudes and informal procedures. The most serious case I witnessed involved a fight between a group of boys and a bus-driver. The problem had been escalated by a relative ofthe driver, who had sent complaints not just to the village but to the police, the LBA, the bus-drivers' union, and a number of politicians. The LBA members were very keen that these complaints should be withdrawn. They repeatedly used the phrase 'yul chig (yul gcig, literally 'one country/land/village') and stressed the undesirability of conflict within the region. Their language was very similar to that used by the yulpa in Photoksar to condemn antagonism within the village. It was the driver's relative, one of the LBA members told me later, who had been most at fault in escalating the dispute. The LBA uses its connections with senior Buddhist lamas, as well as its status as defender and promoter of the religion, to legitimize its political activities (Bertelsen 1997; Mills 2003: 320). Nevertheless the rhetoric of its senior members during the res? olution of disputes is not laced with references to Buddhism. Even for the most highly educated Ladakhis the idea of harmony within the community and the moral con? demnation of conflict are not associated with Buddhist ethics. In the numerous conversations that I conducted about disputes during my field? work only once were the related moral attitudes attributed to religion. This was by a woman politician who had received a legal education in Delhi. She gave me the usual explanation about Ladakhis wanting peace and avoiding disputes and went on to attribute this to the principle of compassion at the root of Buddhist society. 'You cannot have peace without compassion', she explained. But then she paused. 'Of course my brother is a high lamd, she said, 'so my attitude may have been influenced by the Buddhist view'. In other words, she was explicitly doubting the justness of giving a reli? gious explanation to local moral attitudes towards conflict. Conclusion: ideology, practice, and religious assimilation The explanations offered by Buddhist practitioners and elites for the social organiza? tion of Tibetan societies, such as the cosmology ofthe legal realm elaborated by French (1995), represent a radically different set of understandings from those according to which the Photoksar villagers organize their political and judicial activities. This is not to deny the relevance of such models. French's analysis plausibly represents the descrip? tions of her (educated) informants and their claims to the universality of their under? standings. Religious models are powerful and elites continue to try to expand their ambit and acceptance among lay populations.15 Nevertheless the elite in Ladakh show 7 Roy Anthrop. Inst. (N.S.) 12,173-190 ? Royal Anthropological Institute 2006</page><page sequence="14">186 Fernanda Pirie a reluctance to attribute their concerns with conflict to the principles of Buddhism. My suggestion is that this reflects deep-seated ideas about the nature of the relations between humans and the realm of the spirits. The cosmos and its inhabitants are described in numerous studies of Tibetan soci? eties as having physical and environmental significance. Samuel talks of the protection given by the local deities against malevolent spirits and the role they play in the cau- sation of illness and misfortune (1993: 191, 199). Huber and Pedersen point out that maintaining the correct relationship between local populations and the non-human inhabitants of the same locality 'ensures a stable environment which yields its bounty' (1997: 585). In Photoksar it is, similarly, the physical fortunes of the villagers, their health, fertility, and environment, that are directly affected by the cosmological world, not the smooth running of social and political relations. The authority of the yulpa and the harmony they seek to restore by resolving conflict are part of a human, non- cosmological order of no interest to the numina. This distinction between two spheres of order is fundamental to the way in which Buddhism has been accepted and understood by these villagers. It is not that Tibetan Buddhism is simply an elite religion without practical significance for the lay popula? tion. It provides explanations for misfortune and the fate ofthe soul in the after-life and its deities offer crucial assistance in the constant fight against spirit attack. These deities have, however, been assimilated into the villagers' world of cosmological concerns, which are primarily associated with the problems of sickness, fertility, and environ? mental stability. The Ladakhi villagers do not explicitly oppose or reject the teachings of their religious leaders. However, as Ramble found in Mustang (1990:194), they are unconsciously selective about the aspects ofthe religion they regard as significant, seeing no reason to draw upon its texts or practitioners in order to legitimate the authority of their leaders, to resolve internal conflict, or to justify their moral judgements. This division of realms runs counter to the Durkheimian model of an original, undeveloped society in which religion is the eminent form and epitome of collective life and in which the rules of morality and law are indistinguishable from ritual pre? scriptions (Durkheim 1915: 418-19). Mauss, likewise, describes ' "total" social phenom? ena', in which 'all kinds of institutions are given expression at the same time - religious, juridical, and moral' (1990 [1950]: 3), while Douglas describes 'primitive cultures' in which there is a 'lack of differentiation' between persons, their physical environment, and the cosmos, and in which 'physical forces are thought of as interwoven with the lives of persons' (1966: 88). This model still has some currency within social theories of modernization and differentiation (Alexander 1992; Eder 1992; Parry 1998:159). It is also reflected in Samuel's use of the phrase 'total social whole' (1993: 36) to describe the significance of Buddhism in Tibet. Photoksar is a small-scale society in which the cosmos is clearly interwoven with the lives of persons and is deeply implicated in their physical and environmental fortunes. Yet such cosmological concerns are not perceived to have any direct implication for the political and judicial organization of the community. In contrast to Durkheim, anthropologists such as Geertz (1973) have tended to treat religion as an analytically separate domain, as a cultural system (Asad 1993). This is the approach adopted by Ortner (1978; 1989) in her analyses of Tibetan communities. However, this resulted, it has been suggested, in an over-interpretation of the symbolic power of religion. The distinction between religious and secular forms of morality that has been noted in other parts of Tibet, along with the evidence from Photoksar, /. Roy Anthrop. Inst. (N.S.) 12,173-190 ? Royal Anthropological Institute 2006</page><page sequence="15">Fernanda Pirie 187 suggests that the significance such Tibetans attribute to their religion is powerfully shaped by local cosmological understandings. These implicitly limit the practical and explanatory significance of their whole religious world. In Ladakh it is the educated elite who accept the explanatory significance of Bud? dhism and its moral schemes while thoughtful monks attempt to synthesize local moral and ritual concerns with religious principles. These phenomena are part of an ongoing process of religious assimilation, associated with modernity and the pro- motion of 'proper' Buddhism, rather than representing the survival of an original, undifferentiated social whole. Both urban elites and villagers continue to maintain a separation between their moral and social orders and the realm of their cosmological concerns. This is an inexplicit and unobtrusive distinction but it has, and continues to have, a profound effect on the way in which Buddhism is assimilated and understood in the region.

My thanks go to Marcus Banks, Clare Harris, David Parkin, and Charles Ramble for their invaluable advice on this material, and to David Gellner and Martin Mills for their helpful comments on earlier drafts. 11 use this term to refer to the people of a large area encompassing parts of China, India, Nepal, Bhutan, and Pakistan, normally known as 'ethnographic Tibet' (Huber &amp; Pedersen 1997: 592; Richardson 1962:1). 2 Tibetan terms are written according to the Wylie (1959) system. I transcribe local Ladakhi words accord? ing to pronunciation but add the Wylie transcription in brackets. 3 This view is substantially repeated in her later work (Ortner 1999:102-5). 4 The journey, even now, takes two days, one on foot. Twenty months of fieldwork were conducted between 1999 and 2005, concentrated on Photoksar but also encompassing Leh and surrounding villages. 5 In fact, a substantial proportion ofthe Ladakhi population, mostly in the Kargil region, is Muslim, having been converted over the course of several centuries through contact with Kashmir. Most of the villages in the eastern part where I conducted fieldwork are, however, Buddhist. 6 Extensive analysis of these spirits and their activities has been undertaken by Dollfus (2003), Kaplanian (1981: chap. X; 1987), and Riaboff (1997). 7 Elsewhere (Pirie 2002) I have discussed the nature of village politics as a web of conflicting tendencies towards status and its denial and towards hierarchy and equality. Some writers have emphasized the impor? tance of hierarchy and status in Ladakh (e.g. Aggarwal 2004:154-5; Kaplanian 1981:171-90), but the dral go, which these authors primarily cite in support of their contentions, affirms substantial equality among the people of Photoksar. 8 In central Tibet a distinction was made between chos khrims (religious law, right, or customs) and rgyal khrims (the law, right, or customs of the ruler), reflecting a structural distinction between the authority of the monastic and civil arms of the government (Das 1998 [1902]: 172; Jaschke 1881: 50). In Ladakh and Zangskar the distinction is not so clear, however (Riaboff 1997: 342). In Photoksar the term yuli trims (yul gyi khrims) is used to refer to ritual practices but equally to customs of dress and hospitality which have little ritual or cosmological significance. 9 Kaplanian (1987) suggests that a certain class of lha, the gyapo, punishes theft with madness, but this was never mentioned in Photoksar. Dollfus (2003:15) suggests that the Ihu (glu) cause damage as a result of the breach of the yuli trims, village customs, but this is a reference to activities that specifically offend the Ihu, such as polluting their shrines. Hemis Shukpachan, where she undertook fieldwork, is renowned for its sen? sitive Ihu. 10 Similar attitudes to and methods of dispute resolution are found widely throughout Ladakh, including in Leh (Pirie 2006). 11A lama who gave teachings in Photoksar in 2005, in fact, laid considerable emphasis on the merits of helpfulness, selflessness, and the Buddhist moral virtues. My lay informants never recalled similar advice being given by other lamas, however. 12 Even in Amdo, where religious leaders are regarded as the ultimate source of judicial authority, Bud? dhist morality is not commonly invoked during the mediation of disputes (Pirie 2005b: 92). 7 Roy. Anthrop. Inst. (N.S.) \i, 173-190 ?

The Photok? sar villagers told me it arises from gossip, with similar effects to a mild spirit attack which can be cured by a short prayer reading. Mi kha, thus, has cosmological connotations. The gossip need not be malicious, however; it could even include speculating about how the anthropologist is faring back home. The amchi, moreover, made a firm distinction between mi kha and the enmity that arises when two people quarrel. This he referred to as khon. The distinction is subtle but, in my view, significant. Mi kha can be caused acciden- tally but khon is a sign of bad personal relations and has no cosmological connotations. 14Ortner describes similar reactions from the Sherpas (1989: 7). 13 The issues for anthropologists which arise from such dynamics have been discussed in relation to Brah? manical models of caste found in South Asian societies (Berreman 1971; Burghart 1990; Searle-Chatterjee 8c Sharma 1994). Burghart suggests that the divine authority of textual knowledge has been responsible, in many cases, for a conflation of Indology with anthropology (1990: 269-71). REFERENCES Aggarwal, R. 2004.

Resume Contrairement aux idees recues sur les societes bouddhistes et aux modeles avances par les elites tibe- taines, tous le Tibetains n'ont pas une approche ethique de leur religion. Le present article montre que dans une communaute villageoise du Ladakh, le bouddhisme n'est pas un guide spirituel ni la source de l'autorite appuyant l'exercice du pouvoir politique ou judiciaire. En comparant les observations faites par des ethnographes en d'autres endroits de la region tibetaine, il apparait que de nombreux Tibetains considerent que le cosmos et ses habitants n'ont qu'un faible role dans l'ordre moral ou l'organisation politique de leur communaute. L'auteur suggere que cette conception a un effet profond sur les com- prehensions locales de l'enjeu et de la signification du bouddhisme et sur la maniere dont celui-ci est assimile dans la region.
