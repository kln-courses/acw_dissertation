Mukunda The many roles of mathematics in the continual evolution of the physicist's picture of nature are recalled. Examples and situations from classical and modern physics, mathematical formulation versus physical interpretation, and mathematics as the language of nature are considered. Some years ago, at an earlier annual meeting of the 'Philosophy is written in this very great book which Indian Academy of Sciences, I had presented an invited always lies open before our eyes .. . but one cannot lecture on the theme 'The Mathematical Style of Modern understand it unless one first learns to understand the Physics'1.

As Michael Atiyah said recently9: '... electromagnetic forces appear here not as states 'The differential operator introduced by Dirac in his of some substance, but rather as independently existing study of the quantum theory of the electron has turned things that are similar to ponderable matter and share out to be of fundamental importance both for physics with it the feature of inertia.' and for mathematics.'

But it shown that the Maxwell field on its own "must be also had negative energy solutions which seemed quantized" '. And indeed that is what happened when unphysical and made the interpretation very difficult, in 1927, Paul Dirac showed how to apply the principles For a while Dirac suggested that somehow these solutions of the then new quantum mechanics to the Maxwell could be reinterpreted as protons, partly he says as a field. Here we have electric and magnetic fields which lack of courage and reluctance to increase the number are not numbers any more but operators, new life of elementary particles from three to four.

Soon from 1865 to 1927. One is reminded here of Hertz's after, positrons were experimentally found, and this statement about Maxwell's equations: became another success of the Dirac equation.

Let me introduce well interpreted and linked to experiment. But as to my examples with this remark of Dirac13: quantum mechanics as a whole, the wave function itself 'The research worker is only human and, if he has and its objective status, there have been diverging views great hopes, he also has great fears.' and even now after more than seventy years the debates In the case of Lorentz, he had done all the difficult continue.

But pretty soon, after intense 'I think he must have been held back by fears, some discussions with Bohr and Heisenberg in 1927, he had kind of inhibition. He was really afraid to venture into to give this up; and as Heisenberg says": entirely new ground, to question ideas which had been 'After this time Schrödinger at least understood that accepted from time immemorial.

Faced with this problem, the philosopher However when Dirac saw Heisenberg's paper and the Immanuel Kant proposed that there are two components noncommutativity, he had no fears at all-he realized to knowledge, what we may call internal and external; this was the key new idea and took off from there and and only when they come together and act in synchrony built up the whole structure of quantum mechanics!. do we achieve understanding and make progress.

Such a beautiful pic of evolutionary theory) came along and solved Dirac's ture-we can only understand the world in terms of the equation exactly and it agreed perfectly (at that time!) a priori notions built into us, there is no other way. with experiment. But this leads to the question - how does the a priori So we see that in these situations two kinds of component of knowledge get built up, where does it difficulties can appear - the inhibiting effect of prevailing come from, and how is it that it is able to handle ways of thinking and prejudices; and fear that a beautiful, sensory experience so well? new idea may fail upon detailed examination. In both A convincing answer to this question has been offered Newton's and Maxwell's cases described earlier, it was only in this century. It is due to Konrad Lorenz, has the former difficulty. As Heisenberg once said14: been beautifully elaborated by Max Delbrück, and is 'I think the greatest effort in the developments of based on the theory of evolution13.

This is picture of nature. It would be instructive to find parallels the environment in which they have to survive.

On the other hand, each individual member of my topic. This has to do with epistemology or the of the species is born, so to say, with these capabilities theory of knowledge. Probably all working physicists 'ready made'. And the actual acquisition of knowledge (and, for that matter, other scientists too) believe in an is completed, to a great degree, in early infancy by externally existing objective world which has properties using these inborn capacities. What seems a priori, given we can investigate, and which obeys laws we keep in advance of experience, to the individual member of unravelling.

Surely our senses play a key role; and all phenomena roughly at our own scales of length, time, the sophisticated instruments invented and used based mass and motion. But when we move away from this on earlier understanding of science are ultimately range of phenomena - the world of middle dimen refinements and extensions of our senses. But is that sions - and explore the microscopic scale at one end or the sole source of knowledge? The extreme empiricist the macroscopic scale at the other-no wonder at all view of David Hume in the middle of the 18th century that all so often our intuitions fail us, and we have to assumed so, and ended up in- an impasse.

NO 5, 10 MARCH 1999</page><page sequence="6">GENERAL ARTICLES I have hinted earlier that the very fact that phenomena obey definite laws indicates that there is 'a mathematical quality in nature', which however we cannot reach through the ordinary senses. Within mathematics itself there are those who are realists, and those who believe mathematics is entirely a human creation16. The realists deeply believe that there is an objective external 'con tinent of mathematics' independent of us, which we keep exploring as time goes on. Is our capacity for mathematical thinking linked to this mathematical quality inherent in nature? Has it been acquired by us as an a priori category of thought because then we can recog nize this aspect of nature and so at least in a rudimentary sense it is useful for biological survival? Even before Lorenz and Delbrück, the great mathematician David Hilbert did express such ideas relating mathematics to the a priori. In a famous 1930 lecture he says17: 'I even believe that mathematical knowledge depends ultimately on some kind of such intuitive insights.... Thus the most general basic thought of Kant's theory of knowledge retains its importance.... But the line between that which we possess a priori and that for which experience is necessary must be drawn differently by us than by Kant.... Kant's a priori theory contains anthropomorphic dross from which it must be freed. After we remove that, only that a priori will remain which also is the foundation of pure mathematical knowledge.' So where does all this leave us? Hilbert's ideas were expressed well before the ideas of Lorenz and Delbrück explaining the origins of the a priori. But if we believe both, and put them together, we seem to reach some definite points of view. Mathematical structure is surely an essential component of nature, though it lies beyond space, time and the reach of the senses. Echoing Heisenberg18: 'If nature leads us to mathematical forms of great simplicity and beauty that no one has« previously encountered, we cannot help thinking that they are 'true', that they reveal a genuine feature of nature.' And we have acquired over evolutionary time an a priori capacity and sensitivity to it, a sixth sense, though the subsequent enlargement of mathematical ideas makes it a world of its own. A very great deal of the physicist's picture of nature can only be expressed in mathematical language. Mathematics and physics keep coming close to each other and to touch one another, then draw apart, only to meet each other again. 1. Mukunda, N., Curr. Sei., 1987, 56, 156. 2.
