McLellan, Austin, Texas The problem of genre regarding Ibsen's 1867 Peer Gynt seems to reflect a search for a form that might help to explain some of its difficult (i.e., symbolic) passages. Early critics found the dramatic poem powerful but disjointed and confusing. "Written at different times and in different moods," Gosse wrote in 1907, "there is an incoherence in its construction which its most whole-hearted admirers cannot explain away." Further, he adds, In the fourth act, the introduction of which is abrupt and grotesque, we pass to a totally different and, I think, a lower order of imagination. The fifth act, an amalgam of what is worst and best in the poem, often seems divided from it in tone, style and direction, and is more like a symbolic or mythical gloss upon the first three acts than a contribution to the growth of the general story.1 Brandes' 1867 impressions of the play seem to anticipate this view by Gosse and even some later critics, and to restrict the less intelligible sections to the last acts of the play. Naar man undtager Stykkets fjerde Akt, der staar udcnfor Sammenhaengen med det Tidligere og Senere, uvittig i sin Satire, raa i sin Ironi og vanskeligt forstaaelig i sine sidste Partier, er der naesten overalt en Rigdom af Poesi og en Tankedybde, som maaske ikke i noget af Ibsens tidligere Vasrker.2 Julius Olson attributed the first three acts to "the poet's free-flowing fancy"; the much more labored finale, to the "halting process of ra tiocination"; and all, to the "spontaneous upsurgings from the depths of the sub-conscious" that produce "an entire absence of any definite frame-work representing either past or present."3 Daniel Haakonsen has more recently recognized the same division between the composition of the third and fourth acts, but suggested that it occurred deliberately at the juncture of the play's two, under i Edmund Gosse, Henrik Ibsen (New York, 1908), pp. 105-106. 2 Georg Brandes, Henrik Ibsen (Copenhagen, 1898), p. 51. 3 Julius E.

The other, though un named, seems to typify the folklorish Peer Gynt of Asbj0rnsen's Norske huldre-eventyr and portrays the egocentric, fanciful, daydream ing side of Ibsen's Peer Gynt in his efforts to impress or give false im pressions to himself and others. The confrontation of the green-clad troll woman and the innocently Christian Solveig at the end of Act 3 represents, accordingly, the confrontation between Peer's two life controlling myths. Thus, Vladimir Propp's folklore morphology can to some degree be applied to Peer Gynt's plot organization, and in this context Peer becomes a happy-go-lucky folklore figure, winning his way with less than folklorish functional predictability about the often un named but characteristically depicted Scandinavian north and its folk lore personages.5 Much looser than any folklore counterpart, Lars L?nnroth's broad three-point fornaldarsaga system6?that is, a travel pattern focusing on a hero's departure; a series of tests, court visits, and Viking adventures; and a homecoming?also seems to provide a schema for Peer's varied and sometimes abrupt adventures. In this context, Peer becomes a Viking saga hero of sorts, who leaves his homeland with aspirations of fame and fortune, is presented at a (troll) court where he is honored and tested with riddles by the king, is continuaiiy tested in episodes with the Boyg, Memnon, the Sphinx, and others, and finally returns safely. Margaret Schlauch and, most recently, Jon Leirfall trace the Icelandic strains in Peer Gynt to Bue Andridsson from Kjalnesinga saga.7 Together with the Eddic allusions, they show an appropriateness for suggesting a "lygisaga" framework. It derives from the Norwegian school of translated European romances and from the native thir teenth-century fornaldars?gur and provides literary motifs recognizable too in Peer Gynt?the early placed stigma on the hero that makes him scorned, exposed, or exiled; a monster-slaying incident; the omission of kinship vengeance or retribution that pervades most of the other saga forms; the begetting of a child with a woman from the other 4 Daniel Haakonsen, "Genre-Problemet i Peer Gynt," Vinduet 8 (1954), 199-211. 5 Vladimir Propp, Morphology of the Folktale, trans.

Description, variation of ad venture, fanciful combinations of supernatural and real?all were in tensified in this saga form, as Stefan Einarsson notes, because "Ice landers could never hope to visit the marvelous foreign lands except in imagination."8 Too, the Old Norse-Icelandic romance as an imagi native form corresponds nicely to Peer's own special affinity for fancy and lies and might allow for the freedom to create for Peer a series of seemingly unrelated episodes. Folklore and saga parallels, then, pro vide their corresponding forms and are attempts to explain Peer Gynt by a genre allowing for the "vild og forml0s" (Samlede Verker 17, p. 42)? construction that Ibsen admitted his play possessed. Less satisfactory, however, has been the search for a more nearly contemporary model that would allow Peer Gynt to incorporate the whole of Norway's past and present?rather, its mythical, saga, folk lorish, and modern types, depending upon the structural plane through which Peer is seen to move.10 Of the comprehensive or mul tiple nature of his central character, Ibsen wrote in 1867 that the play's "Hovedfigur er en af den norske Almuens halv mythiske og eventyrlige Personer fra nyere Tid" (16, p. 177). Philip Gove has addressed in detail this problem that structuralist critics face in defining the imaginary voyage with the episodic variance like the kind Peer em barks upon: "how to classify a form long recognized as a separate genre, a form that cannot be classified as either romantic or realistic, a form unclassifiable according to many of the usual terms denoting structure or aim,"11 a form that in definition seems to change from language to language and from age to age. As the first to study the voyage imaginaire as a separate fictional form with its own measure of development, Ralph E. Tieje established its general working defini tion as a narrative, commonly autobiographic, with an instructive or entertaining aim woven into a supposed journey through some imagi nary or fanciful land.12 What began as a classical wonderbook of ro mantically descriptive marvels had become, by the time of Jonathan Swift and Ludvig Holberg, a carefully drawn medium, not just for 8 Stefan Einarsson, A History of Icelandic Literature (New York, 1957), p. 16g. 9 Francis Bull, Halvdan Koht, and Didrik Arup Seip, eds., Hundre?rsutgave Henrik Ibsens Samlede Verker 17 (Oslo, 1946), 42.

Character portrayal, however, was still limited to men en bloc showing national qualities, the focus being primarily directed at the nature of society rather than any of its individuals. How, then, does Ibsen's voyage imaginaire in Peer Gynt fit into this tradition? Consider Holberg's 1741 Nicolai Klimii Iter Subterraneum, which was translated in the following year into Danish. Its protagonist, Niels Klim, bears the stamp of Holberg himself, and the autobiographical account of Niels's adventures in the underground country of Potu (that is, Utoppa]) and the surrounding lands is remarkably similar to Hol berg's sojourn in England and continental Europe. Bred in Bergen and educated in theology and philosophy at the University of Copenhagen, both Niels and Holberg set off to investigate the world. Holberg's own experiences subsequently find expression in Niels's descriptions and impressions of the societies he visits. There is much in Hol berg's satirical method and material that derives from Swift's Gulliver's Travels; but curiously enough the possible impact of Niels Klim on Ibsen's Peer Gynt has been disregarded although Holberg was men tioned by Ibsen and Ibsen-critics as an influential precursor.13 Ibsen knew Holberg's novel by 1851. In March of that year, a few months before the writing of his political satire Norma, Ibsen wrote an article entitled "Professor Welhaven om Paludan-M?llers Mythologiske Digte," which illustrates Ibsen's philosophy of form and his move ment away from elegiac or romantic drama. Ibsen rebukes Welhaven's attacks on any use of a mythological or fanciful foundation for poetic narrative, cites the "Poemata, Holberg saa traeffende har parodieret" (15, p. 44), and submits what might be assessed as his own conception of satire in an intellectually aimed voyage imaginaire which could and often did combine the mythical and the realistic: man drager nu ikke laengere som Columbus over Verdenshavet for hiin sides at opdage noget nyt Land, men vel for at granske Beskaffenheden at det, hvis Tilvaerelse er given. Saaledes ogsaa i Mythedigtningen; den Idee, som den mythiske Taenkning, Folkebevidstheden i dens Oprinde lighed, engang har nedlagt paa Bunden af sin Produktion, maa ingen lunde omformes, og kan det i Realiteten hellerikke, da den er det Sande, det Objektive selv; men at drage den frem af sit Havdyb, at anskue 13 Henri Logeman ("Sproglige ber0ringspunkter mellem Holberg og Ibsen," Edda [1925], p. 136) even goes so far as to say, "Hvad vi hittil har set av ber0ringspunk terne mellem Ibsen og Holbergs ikke-dramatiske skrifter var jo ikke av nogen vegt: Skabilken, hvis det betyr noget findes ogsaa i Diderich Menschenschreck, et par andre mulige, eller skal vi si: ikke umulige parallelsteder fra Nils Klim og Holbergs Prosa jeg har noteret er saa ubetydelige at jeg ikke engang gider naevne dem utf0rlig, kun m.h.t. Peder Paars er det muligens grund til at se saken anderledes."</page><page sequence="5">49o McLellan den fra Spekulationens Stade, er ingenlunde nogen Kraenkelse af Mythe digtningens Hellighed eller nogen Forstyrrelse af dens Grundvaesen,? men tvertimod et n0dvendigt Led i dens konsekvente Udvikling. Folke bevidsthedens Produceren i mythisk Form er forbi, og med den ogsaa den umiddelbare Digtning i dennes oprindelige Forstand; vor Digten er reflekteret, (eller om man vil, umiddelbar som h0iere Eenhed af Reflexion og den oprindelige Umiddelbarhed,) og som saadan maa derfor ogsaa vor poetiske Behandling af Mythen fremtraede. Men denne Frem traeden kan kun charakterisere sig ved at 10fte det symboliske Sl0r, hvori Ideen er tilhyllet. Denne frigjorte, af Dunkelheden fremtraedende Idee er det Produkt, hvorefter det spekulative Digtevasrk skal d0mmes. Er Re sultatet (den for Dagen stillede Idee) kun "en eller anden triviel Sandhed," saa har Digteren faeldet sin egen Ford0mmelsesdom, hans Straeben er da forfeilet; thi Ideen kan i og for sig selv ikke vaere triviel, ?han har villet "omfavne Juno, og har grebet en Sky." (15, p. 46) When Holberg's Niels returns home after a novel full of fanciful adventures, his story is likewise greeted with skepticism and a belief that he has, like the imitating poet Ibsen spoke of, "grebet Skyggen for Juno" (p. 359).14 What rescues Holberg's and Ibsen's works from claims of trite imitation or artificiality, then, is in each case deliberately and instructively satirical layering. Indeed, the textual parallels be tween Holberg's novel and Ibsen's poetic drama are pronounced. And the structural framework between Niels's marvelous underground ad ventures, which begin and end at the same geographic location of a mountain cave, and Peer's overland adventures, which for all intents and purposes begin and end at the mountain hut of his mother, is essentially the same. Peer's path follows in Niels's footsteps and leads him into a world recognizable in Holberg?most notably, in Ibsen's troll mountain scene of Act 2 and the madhouse and shipwreck scenes of Acts 4 and 5 in the play's so-called less intelligible half. But, where Holberg's focus is directed outward from Niels to the society he ob serves, Ibsen's concern turns more inward from society to its effect on Peer's individual (though in many respects representative Norwegian) personality. The direction of the voyage imaginaire, thus, seems changed to a search for a utopia of one, a search for self-realization. RONDANE AND MaRTINIA The Rondane mountain scene commences as Peer and his new com panion, the daughter of a troll king, ride through the Dovre gates into an underground mountain hall. The trolls possess a highly superficial perspective on life and Peer must adjust himself to it if he is to fit in. 14 Ludvig Holberg, Niels Klims Underjordiske Reise, trans. Jens Baggesen (Copen hagen, 1905), p. 359. Here the text is altered from "legemet" to "Juno" as it appears in the Latin original. Other references are indicated parenthetically.</page><page sequence="6">Peer Gynt: Search for Contemporary Model 491 Here, the troll daughter tells him, "Svart tykkes hvidt, og styggt tykkes vent" (6, p. 97). Her father even begins by discussing the importance of physical appearance as it relates to the scarcity of the no longer fashionable three-headed trolls and the prevalence instead of the pre viously inferior one-headed creatures like his daughter and Peer: Vi er gaaet tillagters i de senere Aar; vi ved ikke mer om det ramler eller staar, og Folkehjaelp skal en ikke fra sig skyde. Desuden er Gutten fast uden Lyde, og staerkbygget med, saavidt jeg ser. Sandt nok, han har kun et eneste Hode; men Datter min har jo heller ikke fier. Tre Hoders Trolde gaar rent af Mode; selv Tvehoder faar en knappt 0je paa, og de Hoder er endda kun saa som saa. (6, p. 99) At first Peer acknowledges that he must change in order to abide by the new but bestial standards, and cites the drunkard peasant Jeppe from another of Holberg's works, feppe paa Berget: "Det star jo skrevet: Du skal tvinge din Natur."15 Peer is questioned by the troll king in what seems to be an initiation test of suitability, and agrees to give up his human ways and to take up the dress and manner of the trolls. He is outfitted with a yellow bowed tail with which to wave and is asked if he can learn to spit. The trolls do concede to his main taining the Christian faith since outward show is all that matters to them and Peer's lax Christian virtues seem not to offer much of a threat. In the subterranean Martinia, by comparison, Niels encounters a society of troll-like monkeys ("underjordiske Trolde" they are later called). While he is allowed the free exercise of his own religion, Niels is careful not to mention it publicly to the inhabitants in whose opin ion everything, including religion, is important only for external ap pearances and not for substance or meaning. Like Peer, Niels is sup plied with a fictitious tail and colored bows to make him look more like his monkey hosts and to wave as a sign of respect to others. There after, as an observer, Niels watches an initiation ceremony for a pro motion of one of the local inhabitants, in which the candidate is sprayed with sputum symbolic of his obligation to forsake his old vices and to assume a new set of manners. Like Peer's trolls, the Mar tinians perceive things prima facie and are able to "forandre sort til hvidt" (p. 217) if it suits them. Other provinces like Martinia possess a similar high estimation of appearances. In Askarac, for example, Niels learns that its multiheaded citizens have fallen into disrepute, 15 Henri Logeman (A Commentary on Henrik Ibsen's Peer Gynt [The Hague, 1917], p. 107) draws attention to this line from Holberg.</page><page sequence="7">492 McLellan like the multiheaded Dovre trolls, and have been replaced by those with only one head. Det blev derfor besternt eengang for alie ved en Lov, at i Evighed aldrig noget Syvhoved herefter maate ansaettes til et vigtigt Embede; og at Staten fra den Tid af aliene skulde bestyres af enfoldige Folk, det er at sige, af dem, som kun havde et eeneste Hoved. Paa denne Maade ere disse tilforn saa vigtige Personer, der fordum bleve anseete som Halv guder, nu naesten i samme Forfatning, som de hovedl0se i Cabac. Thi ligesom de ingen Ting kunne forrette, fordi de slet ingen Hoveder have, saaledes forrette disse alting bagvendt, fordi de have for mange. (p. 169) Unlike Peer, however, Niels recognizes his place and his society as distinctly different from the inhabitants and societies he observes and describes. The particular society becomes more important for what it looks like than for what it can show about Niels's personal devel opment. Crucial to Peer's development and acceptance in the troll community is his response to the troll king's riddle: "hvad er Forskjellen mellem Troll og Mand?" (6, p. 99). The interrelationship between this riddle and its variants of the other mysterious riddlers Peer meets in his travels is formed by the descriptive associations of the figures and, of course, the nature of the riddle itself. The Sphinx, Peer surmises as he gazes at it in Act 4, is half lion and half woman and resembles the polyphyletic Boyg of Act 2; the statue of Memnon of Act 4 is like the Dovre troll king of Act 2, in its mannerisms. The Strange Passenger of Act 5 is thin like "Den Magre" Peer encounters later in the same act, and the transformation of the first aboard ship into a dog is paralleled by Peer's description of the second as a hoofed dog. The troll king's question simply establishes a contrast which Peer sees in the half-human and half-animal figures but which Peer cannot see in him self, a contrast which Peer must distinguish if he is ever to control his problematic, dual nature. What distinguishes man from troll is a mat ter of attitude and what is in control?Peer's dark, bestial side or his human side. In order to make the distinction between them, Peer must first learn to see a difference at all?in other words, to resolve the riddle which is periodically asked him in the play as a check on his progress. It is essentially the very question which he asks and which is then asked him by the Boyg and later by the Sphinx: "hvem er du?" (6, pp. 108, 173). The riddle opposition is oftentimes constructed in the descriptions used by the riddlers themselves: the Boyg who is dead and yet lives, the Thin One who teaches that negative can be made positive, or the troll king's daughter who reckons that black can look white. Memnon's riddle is the most complex:</page><page sequence="8">Peer Gynt: Search for Contemporary Model 493 Af Halvgudens Aske stiger foryngende Fugle syngende. Zeus, den alvidende, skabte dem stridende. Visdomsugle, Hvor sover mine Fugle? Du maa d0 eller raade Sangens Gaade. (6, p. 172) Even here, Memnon's relation to the Dovre troll king, as seen by Peer, would suggest that their riddles too are somehow related. Huns Eitrem finds the basic ingredients to the story in the mythical legend of Memnon and his mother's plea to Jupiter-Zeus to honor her dead son by changing him into birds from his ashes, which, rising each year, would utter wild screams and fight among themselves.16 Yet, as for the riddle itself, he finds its "laughable" and "futile" solution a satirical comment on the current academic research of Ibsen's day. The Dovre king's riddle actually seems to stem from a moral fable by Holberg, called "Tornebuskens Forvandlinger."17 The story follows the life of a hawthorne bush which is constantly dissatisfied with its present circumstances and low position and is always wishing itself to be something else. Heaven hears the bush's first complaints and changes it, as requested, to an ash tree. Other complaints follow, and it is tranformed, in succession, into an ox, a human being, and an angel. When it contemplates the angel's imperfect being and desires godly qualities, heaven is angered and the angel becomes a lowly hawthorne again. One episode, however, concerns the hawthorne, now an ox, and its wish to be a man. It asks, "Hvilken Forskiel er dog ikke imellem Dyr og Mennesker?" The question is close to the Dovre king's: "Hvad er Forskjellen mellem Troll og Mand?" Ibsen's inversion of the line in this case, by making it positive?is in keeping with his method (and Peer's) of misquoting for individual purposes that the particular situ ation requires.18 The- hawthorne associates, its dissatisfaction with a recognition of a difference between an animal and a man; Peer, of course, is perfectly satisfied to be led along and sees "ingen Forskjell" 16 Hans Eitrem, "Mystifikationer i Peer Gynt," Samtiden (1906), pp. 592-95. 17 Carl S. Petersen, ed., Ludvig Holbergs Samlede Skrifter 17 (Copenhagen, 1942), 165-66: Number 230 from Moralske Fabler (1751). 18 Ansten Anstensen (The Proverb in Ibsen [New York, 1936], p. 129) detects the cause of an extensive use of proverbs by Peer, saying "In the first place, the lo quacious Peer is very inconsistent and inaccurate in the matter of indicating his sources. In order to lend greater dignity and authority to the quotation which he has chosen in order to justify his conduct, he frequently ascribes it to the Bible, when in reality it is nothing but a trite proverbial saying. In the second place, he misquotes flagrantly. He does this intentionally, in order to produce an authorita tive argument in support of his behavior in cases where none caa readily be found."</page><page sequence="9">494 McLellan (6, p. 100). The hawthorne's direction is likewise antithetical to Peer's. The hawthorne progresses up the social ladder; Peer, down it. And while both display an element of greed, there is something even more ironic about Peer's obliviousness to his desire for what is actually a lower bestial status. What Ibsen's Peer and Holberg's Niels have in common is this: both pay the price for an inability to control their ambitious dreams or realize them in full. Addressing the troll king, Peer asks for the king's "Datter og Riger i Medgift" (6, p. 99). Peer's request is especially greedy when one considers that Ibsen's original draft of the play has Peer ask only for the more common and generally acceptable one-half of the kingdom. Once the conditions of Peer's institution into troll society are met and the bargain struck, the celebrations with music and dancing begin. As his eyesight remains unaffected by the troll's mead, Peer quite unavoidably sees his bride and her sister with human eyes and insults them as Noget ustyggelig styggt. Med Kloven slaar en Bjeldeko et tarmestraengt Spil. I Stutthoser tripper en Purke dertill. (6, p. 102) When the troll king demands that Peer's eyes be operated upon, an argument ensues, during which time Peer is accused of having seduced the king's daughter and is attacked by the trolls. Peer relates this ex perience later in Act 4 to his African companions, though he inflates his story to make himself look better. The trolls have become an aris tocratic family; his rape of the troll princess, a marriage of advisable expediency; and his reasons for breaking off the relationship, only a noble gesture. Og da nu Svigerfader kom forblommet frem med Fordring om jeg skulde skifte Navn og Stilling og I0se Adelskabsbevilling, samt mangt og meget h0jst usmageligt, for ej at sige uantageligt,? saa trak jeg mig med Anstand ud, gav Afslag paa hans Ultimatum? og Afkald paa min unge Brud. (6, p. 133) Certainly, Peer's fantasies and lying pretense show an opportunistic self-interest. But they also reveal Peer's fear of losing face and offer him a means of self-protection against having to commit himself. They stem from the troll king's motto, revealed to Peer in Rondane?"vaer dig selv?nok"?instead of mankind's motto?"vaer dig selv" (6, p. 100).</page><page sequence="10">Peer Gynt: Search for Contemporary Model 495 The elements of Peer's affair with the trolls seem to comprise three escapades of Niels. In Martinia, a female monkey of an aristocratic family falls in love with Niels, who is now called Kadicoran; but, when she is rejected by him, she invents a story about certain sexual improprieties, and he loses his "Adelsbrev" and is exiled thereafter: Saasnart hun havde forsikkret sig det, underki0bte hun nogle Personer, som skulde bevidne med Eed, at jeg i Hans Excellences Fravaerelse havde fors^gt paa, at tage hende med Void. Denne Fabel blev indklaedt og forestillet med saa megen Kunst og Sandsynlighed, at Pr?sidenten aldeles ikke tvivlte paa Sagens Sandhed . . . Mit Adelsbrev blev mig strax frataget, og revet i Stykker af B0ddelen. (pp. 234-35) Later, at a banquet reception in Mezendoria, another society of animals and trees, Niels is seated with the cow-wife of a sea captain and is favored again, this time by the amorous advances of the sow-wife of a gold-finder, an occupation filled by pigs. And once again, Niels's distaste for her species and her passion for him leave him no choice but to leave quickly for fear of reprisal. A third proposal comes to Niels from the lion king of Mezendoria. Attacked by Niels in his posi tion as Emperor of Quama, the lion king futilely offers "sin Datter, den smukkeste af alle L0vinderne, til aegte, og Halvdelen af sit Rige til Medgift" (p. 327). Niels refuses because, as he says, such a marriage is both "usikkert" and "utilladeligt." It is clear that, while Niels at least does not fail to keep a distance from the animal species as Peer does, he is no less ambitious, no less guilty of failing to adhere to the wise doctrine prescribed to him by the Potuan king and identical to the human proverb mentioned and opposed by the Dovre king?"kiend dig selv" (p. 123). For example, Niels is not satisfied to be a subordi nated messenger in Potu, despite the appointment for his relative swiftness of foot, which compares favorably to Peer's and which sets him apart from the slow-moving Potuan tree. His total commitment to action leads him to propose radical societal reforms, which either inte grate him into the upper ranks of a society or isolate him completely in condemnation and ridicule. Subsequent to Peer's episode with the trolls is a related struggle with an invisible figure called the Boyg, the basis for which has been found in Asbj0rnsen's folktale about Peer Gynt but which also owes a debt to Holberg. The Boyg, like Peer's compromising attitude, prevents Peer's totally forward movement and forces him to "gaa udenom" (6, p. 108). In Holberg's comedy De Usynlige, it is said about a Per Gante (Peer Gynt?) that he must "have vaeret en meget fornemme Mand; thi man siger om dem som laverer saaledes uden N0dvendighed til</page><page sequence="11">496 McLellan Maalet, at det gaaer Per Gantes Gienvei."19 When Peer tries to go forward, his progress is thwarted?"Atter og fram, det er lige langt;? / ud og ind, det er lige trangt!" (6, p. 109). When Holberg's Niels criti cizes the hesitation and thought of the Potuans, he learns too that iblant de ski0nne Sindsprog ved Hoffet i Potu, som meget maerkeligt, at de lignede disse Folk, der alt for hurtigen give sig af med, og afgi0re hvad det skal vaere, ved 0rkesl0se Spadseergiaengere, der snart gaae frem og snart tilbage paa den samme Vei, uden at komme videre. (p. 63) Shortly thereafter, Peer is beset by birds as he hears their wings flap ping and is attacked by their teeth and claws. Peer defends himself with a branch, which he calls his sword. Niels is likewise beset by a griffin who attacks him with its wings and gnaws at his legs with its teeth. Niels defends himself with his university degree, which he calls his spear. In Peer's troll world and Niels's animal world, there is an outward struggle with beasts; in Peer's, it parallels an inward struggle with himself. Morocco and Cairo and Potu and Quama Struggles with beasts mark both Niels' and Peer's travels in the south. In Morocco, Peer climbs a tree to escape what he thinks is a lion, only to find that he is threatened by monkeys. Despite his outward show of courage, he is unable to face a bull, as he claims. Wishing a false tail as disguise and imitating a monkey as a means of defending himself, Peer is attacked by them nonetheless and must fend them off with a branch. The scene is reminiscent of his experience in troll mountain, where he has acquired a false tail with which to blend with the trolls. Here too, Peer recalls an assortment of maxims told him in part by the troll king and derived from Holberg once again: Jeppe's resolu tion to change himself?and the Potuan king's advice to be oneself. This cycle of repetition helps to hold Peer's fundamental problem at all times before him?the struggle with his own bestial self. In Potu, Niels also climbs a tree to escape a bull, only to find that the tree is the wife of a tree magistrate who thinks Niels is just another monkey. After he is given permission to visit the Potuan court, Niels is molested and teased by real monkeys, who are obviously attracted by the affinity of his shape, and he finds that he must constantly fend them off with his lance. To avoid appearing different from the Potuans and upsetting the balance of equality, Niels is disguised with artificial branches, a 19 The word "gantes (to trifle)" is used a few lines earlier by the troll king to describe himself to Peer, who is trying to get around their agreement: "da er jeg ikke till at gantes med."</page><page sequence="12">Peer Gynt: Search for Contemporary Model 497 procedure duplicated later when Niels must wear a false tail for the same reason. While both Peer and Niels are victims of their own peculiarity of temperament, obsessed by a notion of their own self-importance, they are still critical of the native folly of others. In Cairo, Peer finds him self in an asylum, surrounded by lunatics who hail him as a prophet, and name him "Kejser" of the Self. Later he even imagines that his title included a reign over all animals. Peer thinks he himself is going mad from the absurd concerns of these provincials because the particu lar problems he is asked to solve are all so trivial in nature. Huhu, a student of philology, confronts Peer with the problem of preserving, unchanged, the ancient language of the country and of purging the original monkey language, consisting of grunts and such, from its foreign influences. While Ibsen's model for Huhu seems to have been his friend and Landsmaal advocate A. O. Vinje, it was no secret that Ibsen opposed the radical Norwegian language movement which sought to reinstate the folk language as the official national language. Ibsen saw this as only one more illustration of the kind of artificial national ity his countrymen displayed. In reply to Huhu, Peer suggests that he emigrate to Morocco where "en Flok Orangutanger / lever uden Tolk og S?nger" (6, p. 181), where there would no longer be a need for his language reform or the source of his distress. Other homely trivialities of country life and national artificiality appear next in the character of Hussein whose concern for domestic accounts and writing have so filled his life that he believes himself to be the very epitome of book keeping. Henri Logeman found that a Norwegian fanaticism for only those things homemade or characteristically Norwegian?dress, language, or otherwise?was satirized and referred to the troll world's external val ues and its hatred of all things foreign,20 but, the context for these self-indulgent attitudes seems to come from Holberg. Niels's observa tions of the Potuan nation reveal that dissenters and reformers are confined in the public bedlam. Here Niels is presented to a Jocthan Hu, a student of philology, here "Poesien dyrkes ikke med megen Varme" (p. 119), and here monkeys retain their original, unintelligent, and speechless status. In Quama, Niels is received, like Peer, as an all knowing prophet, is called "Solens Gesandt," and plays the role to his simple human subjects who believe they must make sacrifices to ap pease him and who plead with him for advice on all sorts of absurd matters. Niels is eventually crowned "Keiser" of Quama, which under his whimsical and ambitious guidance leads to a short rule over the 20 Logeman, A Commentary, pp. 103-106.</page><page sequence="13">498 McLellan animal kingdoms as well. Peer's subject Hussein, however, does not come from Holberg's novel but from the comedy Den Stundeslo'se about a frenzied businessman who is hopelessly overwhelmed and driven crazy by the trivial details of keeping his home's accounts in order. His four assistant clerks are the very embodiments of Hussein and a concern for externals, a frustration, and an incapability of com pleting even the most trivial matters. The North Sea and the Subterranean Seas One of the most perplexing figures Peer encounters is the so-called Strange Passenger of the final act.21 What the Strange Passenger (and subsequently the encompassing scene) represented, Ibsen wrote, was a "Caprice" (16, p. 198)?that is, simply an imaginative thought. The rather brief remark has implications both for Peer and his creator. For Peer, the caprice is comparable to the troll king, Boyg, Sphinx, Memnon, or any of the remaining anthropomorphic figures that he does not fully understand and that are physical reminders of the rid dles they pose about his divided nature. Their dark, foreboding, bestial natures spring from the fact that they derive from Peer's fanciful, ly ing, and lower egocentric side. Despite Peer's contention that "Sligt kan mer engang haendes" (6, p. 63), the figures belong to someone else's stories, someone else's life. The scene appears to be an amalgam of several precursors, including Holberg again. The character of the ghostly Strange Passenger occurs in Johan Welhaven's poem "Fligt ningen" of the year 1848: Og nu f0rst maerkes en Fremmed ombord, en Passager, som Giggen har hentet. Han sidder saa taus, og fast uden Spor af Liv er hans Aasyn, hvor Sorgen staaer prentet.22 21 The various guesses as to the identity of the Strange Passenger are interesting, though not wholly convincing. J. Collin (Henrik Ibsen [Heidelberg, 1910], p. 332) views him as the personified apparition of death; P. J. Eikeland (Ibsen Studies [Northfield, 1934], p. 38), more generally as the degenerative Peer's "awakening con science, his fear of seeing himself as he is or he has been." This latter representation seems in accordance with what the Danish critic Clemens Petersen originally called the symbol of terror and anxiety, a claim Ibsen emphatically rejected in a letter to Bj0rnson one month after the play's publication. Leif Tjersland (" 'Den Fremmede Passager' i 'Peer Gynt,' " Ibsen Aarbok [1953], p. 79) suggests that, when the Strange Passenger presents himself to Peer as a "Moralist," it "fortalte Peer hvem han var: stykkets forfatter, en gammel kjenning, som nylig hadde begatt det trakige diktet 'Brand'. Eller?om man vil?Brand selv." Similarly, Martin Svendsen's consideration of a dramatis persona-author relationship in the play prompts him to comment that "dikteren er i virkeligheten alltid sine diktede figurers medpassager." 22 J. S. Welhaven, Samlede Digterverker 3 (Oslo, 1943), 35-36. The possibility of Welhaven's influence on the Dovre mountain scene is noted by H. Eitrem, "Ibsens</page><page sequence="14">Peer Gynt: Search for Contemporary Model 499 A storm arises and among the crew a tale circulates concerning a strange passenger whose presence on board has meant certain doom for the ship. A crew member is swept overboard. Der I0d en R0st i hans angstfulde Raab af al den Kval, som i Havdybet blunder; han sv0mmede laenge med svindende Haab, og kunde ei frelses, og matte gaa under. Shortly thereafter, the passenger himself goes overboard but is con trastingly calm. Ibsen's dramatic situation is only slightly different. When the Strange Passenger asks Peer if he possesses the "Angst" necessary to be really saved, Peer misinterprets the meaning of the Strange Passenger's word as something externally caused and repre sented, like the "angstfulde Raab" of Welhaven's boatswain, rather than as a quality internally felt and respected, like the quiet acceptance of death by Welhaven's strange passenger. It is not a bestial side of dread or self-preserving fear to which Ibsen's Strange Passenger seems to refer, but rather a human side or self-sacrificing reverence. It is, Peer decides, only a moralist's point of view, one that demands a total commitment to something or someone. And consistently, Peer has shown himself committed only to noncommital action. More than any thing else, it is Peer's fear of losing himself, not his drive of being himself, that inevitably makes him hesitant of giving himself whole heartedly to anything or anyone. This does not imply, as some critics have contended, that the Strange Passenger is Peer's second self, his better half. The passenger, after all, only asks Peer a question in the fashion of the troll king and others who wish to check exactly where Peer stands. Like the trolls, the Strange Passenger stands in the dark, shuns the light, is interested in Peer's outward form (in this case, in preserving Peer's body for scientific research), and can transform him self into a beast. By comparison, Holberg's Niels is placed in basically the same "angstfull" situation as Peer. Shipwrecked in the subterranean seas around Quama instead of the North Sea around Norway, Niels is con fronted with the figure of death and is given to an apparently in humane attitude toward all but himself. Vi saa alle den visse D0d for os: den eene raabte paa Kone og B0rn, den anden paa Slaegt af Venner, og hele Skibet gienl0d af fortvivlede Skrig . . .

Mens vi forn^iede os i dette Haab, st0dte Skibet paa et blindt Skiaer saa staerk, at det skiltes ad, og gik i hundrede Stykker. I denne Angest fik jeg fat paa en Planke, og, uden at bekymre mig om de andre, taenkte kun paa at redde mig selv, saa at jeg endnu i dette 0ieblikk ikke veed, hvorledes det gik dem. (pp. 264-66) Though he hears the screams of others, Niels, unlike Peer, is willing to face certain death head-on. With a chance, however, Niels shows the same physical, self-preservational dread and lack of concern for others; and like Peer, who struggles first with the ship's cook and then with the Strange Passenger over possession of a single ship's plank on which to float to safety, Niels clings to the one plank without a thought for his fellow passengers. There is no reason, then, to believe that the entire scene is not, like the other passages cited above, a caprice as Ibsen claimed, externally inspired by the events surrounding its writing and given expression by the literati of his day. One should remember that, exiling himself from his Norwegian public because of its failure to aid its Scandi navian brothers in the Dano-Prussian struggles of 1864, disheartened by what he viewed as a general lack of understanding of and lack of identification with the high ideas of Norway's past, and convinced that social reform could only follow individual self-realization, Ibsen wrote in 1866 that poetry must strike another path from the one which called forth worthwhile memories from Norway's historical past. And yet, Ibsen has in Peer Gynt so filled the lines with precursor material that it resembles everything about them, just as Peer, by not recogniz ing the past of others, delegates it for himself. The writer and character who play the fool with a hidden intellect, who disguise quotational intrusion as original text, and who assume a self-appointed position of precursor, constitute what Northrop Frye calls ironic comedy. The concept of being ironic in dramatic comedy seems to involve a hero (perhaps anti-hero is better here) who pretends to deprecate himself as a means of protecting himself from society or of making himself in vulnerable against its attacks.23 In Peer's case, deprecation becomes an internal matter for characters within the drama and readers outside it who must learn to know him, and it assumes an externally reversed form as lying pretense, inflation, or the technique of appearing to be more than he is. The same may be said for Ibsen as the writer whose text relies so heavily on others. The association between Peer and the socially ridiculed and ridicul ing rascal of Frye's ironic comedy?sometimes absurd, inferior, and 23 Northrup Frye, Anatomy of Criticism (Princeton, 1973), pp. 40-41, 46-47.</page><page sequence="16">Peer Gynt: Search for Contemporary Model 501 na?ve, and other times acutely profound, superior, and world-wise? puts him (and the writer of ironic comedy) in a peculiar position be tween realistic and mythical personages of the two surrounding comic modes. While Ibsen has utilized Holberg's Niels Klim as his model for the voyage, he has taken episodic bits and pieces from a variety of literary sources. Peer, in fact, may be seen to summarize both his and Ibsen's imitative method with the following lines: Jeg er, som jeg Dem f0r har sagt. en blot og bar Autodidakt. Methodisk har jeg intet laert; men jeg har taenkt og spekuleret, og laest mig till en Del af hvert. Jeg har begyndt i aeldre Alder; da ved De jo, lidt tungt det falder at pl0je Side opp og ned og tage ligt og uligt med. Historien har jeg taget stykkevis; thi mere fik jeg aldrig Tid till. Og da man jo i tunge Tider et noget visst maa saette Lid till, saa tog jeg Religionen rykkevis. Paa den Maner det bedre glider. Man skal ej laese for at sluge, men for at se, hvad man kan bruge. (6, p. 134) Even this philosophy finds a place in Holberg's Potuan nation where Saa ofte vi stride med nogen, sagde de, tage vi af det daglige Livs R?stkammer aliene de Vaaben, som vi kunne bruge, og give ikkun Agt paa de Exempler, som tiene til at bestyrke vore Saetninger, og udelade dem, som gi0re os Skade. (p. 82) But Niels's voyage of observation acquires an added dimension when Ibsen makes Peer's voyage turn inward so that its physical images and strifes personify his psychic problems and struggle for self-realization.</page></plain_text>
