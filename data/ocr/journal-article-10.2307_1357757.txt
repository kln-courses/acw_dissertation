Pero no es esa clase de revoluciones la que provocan los genios." (Sibato 1972: 270) A unique clay figurine, now broken, was found in the excavations at Tel Beer Sheba in the Negev, one of a large corpus of about 350 Iron Age figurines from this site. It was found in a courtyard of a Level II building, dated to the late eighth century B.C. Though the locus is not completely secure, the Iron Age date is clear according to typology (the ware, whitewash, and general form are all typical of Iron Age II Judah). The figurine combines a horse's body with an anthropomorphic head, which is similar to heads of Judaean pillar figurines (but smaller). Two unique features, not found in Judaean fig- urines, were added: triangular ears and male genitals. Following discussion of various ancient "monsters," we identify this figurine as a centaur, which finds the closest par- allels in Cypriote hermaphrodite centaur figurines. There is other evidence for connec- tions between Judah and Cyprus during this period. We assume that the figurine is a result of such a connection, perhaps indirectly through a Philistine city. Centaurs are unknown sofarfrom Iron Age Judah, and this figurine remains a rare exception; hence, it cannot inform us much about Judaean religious beliefs. INTRODUCTION he site of Tel Beer Sheba is located in the Beer Sheba Valley, identified as the biblical Negev of Judah, a few kilometers east of modern Beer Sheba. The site was extensively ex- cavated on behalf of the Institute of Archaeology of Tel Aviv University in 1969-1975 under the direc- tion of the late Y. Aharoni, and in 1976 under Ze'ev Herzog. The excavation revealed 13 strata, ranging from Iron I to the Early Arab period. The main sig- nificance of the site is the extensive unearthing of remains of a small city in Stratum II, which is re- lated to the administration of the Kingdom of Judah in the eighth century B.C. A network of streets di- vides the well-planned city into domestic and ad- ministrative quarters. The city was strongly fortified and permitted entry through an impressive gate. In addition to domestic quarters, it included a series of pillared storehouses (Aharoni 1973; Herzog 1993; 1997a; 1997b: 244-47; for earlier Iron Age strata see Herzog 1984). Aharoni identified this city as biblical Beer Sheba, although alternative possibili- ties were considered (Na'aman 1987: 4). The city served as an important center in the valley of Beer Sheba under Assyrian rule (Singer-Avitz 1999). Fieldwork at Tel Beer Sheba was resumed after the Israel National Parks Authority took over respon- sibility of the site. Several stages of preservation, re- construction, and excavation have been carried out, 27</page><page sequence="2">28 KLETTER AND HERZOG BASOR 331 resulting in a fully developed archaeological na- tional park available for the general public. One of the main achievements of this project was the full exposure of the city's water system. This stage was conducted in 1994-1995, directed by Zelev Herzog with field supervisor Ido Ginaton. The monumental system is comprised of a stairwell, underground res- ervoir, and feeding channels (Herzog 2002). In order to establish the chronological and architectural con- text of the water system, a wide area around the stair- well was exposed, and during this undertaking the figurine discussed in this paper was found. It is one of more than 350 figurines from Iron Age strata at Tel Beer Sheba, which will be published with a full catalog by R. Kletter. It was decided to publish one figurine (Reg. No. 21057/1) before the rest of the material, in view of its unique nature.1 CONTEXTUAL DATA The figurine was found at a height of 3.53 m in Square R9, Locus 3622, of Stratum II, dated to the late eighth century B.C. This locus is a courtyard or a room in a building facing the peripheral street L.524, near the southwestern corner of the stairwell of the water system (fig. 1). The area east of this locus was badly eroded into the depression of the destroyed stair shaft. Consequently, the architectural nature of the building in which the figurine was found is not securely defined. The remains that are assigned clearly to Stratum II in Locus 3622 are not impressive. They consist of a loosely laid stone pavement (at level 3.73) at the corners of walls R81 and R82. An oven was uncovered to the east of the pavement. On top of this pavement and next to the oven were found several objects: a Kurkar grinding stone, a stone hammer, and an eighth century B.C. jug and juglet. The figurine was found in the de- struction layer of Stratum II, about 20 cm above the pavement, together with pottery sherds of two Iron Age bowls and a clay loom-weight. The nature of the finds may indicate an open space for food prep- aration. Because of the absence of any indication of partition walls in the area, Locus 3622 is tentatively defined as a courtyard. In the same basket with the figurine, however, were parts of two late Hellenistic (Herodian) cook- ing pots. This evidence indicates that Locus 3622 suffered from later intrusion and is stratigraphically not fully secure. Nonetheless, the evidence from the locus suggests that the figurine does belong to the Iron Age assemblage of Stratum II, as is implied also by its typology (below). DESCRIPTION AND TECHNIQUE OF PRODUCTION The figurine under discussion (figs. 2-4) repre- sents a quadruped animal with an anthropomorphic head. It is not preserved in its entirety. The four legs and the tail are broken, and the surface is slightly worn. It is 64 mm in height and 72 mm in length. The body of the figurine is zoomorphic and solid; it is quite small and round. A solid, thick tail protrudes upward and to the back, but most of it is broken. Male genitals are applied between the hind-legs. Part of the male organ is missing, but evidence for its original existence is found in an area of a dif- ferent color on the animal's belly. The change of color is due to the fact that the area was not ex- posed to air during firing, since it was covered by the applied part (Ciasca 1964). Also, this area lacks the typical whitewash, which covers the exposed surfaces of the figurine. The figurine's neck is very thick and long. However, instead of a zoomorphic head with rounded muzzle, of the type found in Judaean zoomorphic figurines, there is an anthropo- morphic head. It is rounded on top and slightly dam- aged. The face is round, with full cheeks and a smiling mouth. The height of the head is 2 cm (top to chin), and that of the face (measured from chin to beginning of hairdo) is 1.3 cm (the measurements are taken to enable comparison with other figurines, below). The hairdo is composed of one row of ver- tical curls. Large, triangular ears are represented in a crude way on the sides of the face. Although small and worn, it seems that the Beer Sheba face was also produced in a mold. The face has a sort of clay "ledge" or background that surrounds it, in- dicating that the potter used a lump of clay larger than the size of the mold. There are no signs of the head being made separately and attached to the body. However, potters were often excellent in con- cealing attachments of separate parts. Probably the head was first pressed in the mold and then attached to the body of the horse. The figurine was elaborately decorated above the regular whitewash, but most of the decoration is now worn. There are bands of red and gray paint on the head, above the hairdo; red paint on the hairdo, 1The full publication of the figurines will appear in Beer Sheba III, which is under preparation by a team headed by Z. Herzog.

The animal's back is painted as well, with di- agonal gray lines bounded by red lines. Traces of red paint appear on the animal's chest. The gray color could also denote a degradation of an original color, such as black or brown, but this is not certain.

Yet, the Tel Beer Sheba figurine is part of the local Judaean coroplastic art, although the type was not identified in Judah until now. The local origin is evident because of the typical red-brown clay, the finish (whitewash and simple painted pattern), the solid body, and the schematic rendering, all of which are typical of Judah (for a definition of Judaean coro- plastic art, see Kletter 1996: 28-30; we hope to send a sample of figurines from the site for petrographic analysis in the future). The head of the Tel Beer Sheba figurine shows many points of resemblance with the hundreds of molded heads of Judaean pillar figurines (for which see Kletter 1996; 2001). It shares with them the short, curly hairdo, the lack of incised or applied decor- ation, and significant features of the face, such as rounded chin, almond-shaped eyes, and full cheeks. On the other hand, there are two basic differences from the molded heads of Judaean pillar figurines. First, heads of Judaean pillar figurines are much larger (on average, 2.6 cm for the length of the face [Kletter 1995: 98-99, 203]-that is, twice the size of the Tel Beer Sheba figurine). Second, the depiction of ears on the Tel Beer Sheba head differs from the complete lack of ears on the Judaean pillar figurines. We have found only one comparison from Judah to our figurine-a molded head from Jerusalem (Gil- bert-Peretz 1996: G4471, fig. 11:15, pl. 2:15-16). It is of the same size and has similar features, includ- ing the clay "background" around it. Gilbert-Peretz classified the Jerusalem head as a separate subtype of pillar figurine (her type A2f), but noted no comparisons. Since the body is missing, the identifi- cation of the Jerusalem head as a centaur is tenta- tive and dependent upon the figurine from Tel Beer Sheba. The body of the Tel Beer Sheba figurine most probably portrays a horse. Figurines of horses/horses and riders are common in the ancient Near East. They are especially abundant in Iron Age Cyprus, where they are often portrayed with details such as shields and trappings (Crouwel and Tatton-Brown 1988; Karageorghis 1995: 63-95; 1996: 28). Holland (1975: 321, type D; 1977) noted the special impor- tance of the horse in the coroplastic art of Iron Age II Palestine. Horses appear on Judaean seals as well (Barkay 1992). Hundreds of horse figurines were found in Iron Age II Judah. These are solid and sche- matic, usually lacking applications or incisions, deco- rated by whitewash and red/yellow paint. More than 280 horse-and-rider figurines are documented from Judah, including 28 from Tel Beer Sheba itself (Klet- ter 1995: 193-213; 1999b: 38-40). The meaning of horse-and-rider figurines is not certain, and two explanations are popular: divine beings and mortal figures (e.g., warriors). In the past, horse figurines with "discs" of clay between the ears were related to sun worship, following 2 Kgs 23:11 (Kenyon 1974: 141-42; MacKay 1973). Yet, this theory is doubtful (Holloway 1992: 501-9). In Egypt, the sun disc</page><page sequence="6">32 KLETTER AND HERZOG BASOR 331 between the horns is a common attribute not of horses, but of Hathor and her cow (Pinch 1993: 62, 93, 161-63). Regarding Judah, Wenning (1991 a) sep- arated two types of horse-and-rider figurines: figu- rines of standing riders with pillar bases that depict, in his view, divine beings; versus figurines of sitting riders with small legs and crescent-shaped bodies which are explained as mortal riders. This theory is difficult. Pillar bases are common for many Judaean figurines, such as birds, and do not indicate divine status. Also, both variations of horse and rider appear in the same levels and contexts, and there is no reason to interpret one as divine, the other as mortal. It is bet- ter to interpret both as typological variations of one figure (Keel and Uehlinger 1998: 341-47; Kletter 1999b: 38-40). Stem (2001: 207-8) suggested that all the Judaean rider figurines represented divinities (see also Uehlinger 1997). The Judaean riders are al- ways male, at least as far as can be judged from the fragmented and worn figurines. This is based on the fact that the riders lack female breasts and are some- times depicted with beards, or holding weapons or shields. A few of the Judaean figurines are composed of double riders on the same horse (this group will be discussed by Kletter in the future). Therefore, we think that the Judaean horse-and-rider figurines de- pict mortal beings or demons, not divinities. The body of the Tel Beer Sheba horse has one exceptional fea- ture: the addition of genitals between the hind legs. This is significant, since we found no comparison for such an addition in Judah. Returning to the Tel Beer Sheba figurine, if the head is female (based on its similarity to the female Judaean pillar figurines), and the body is male (based on the genitals), then what we have is a hermaphro- dite figurine. Hermaphrodite figurines are very rare but not unknown from Iron Age II Levant. A plaque figurine from Tel 'Ira in the Judaean Negev shows a standing female holding a tambourine, with a male organ (Beck 1999: fig. 7.5; for the other clay figurines from this site, see Kletter 1999a). Two hermaphrodite figurines of tambourine players are known from Transjordan, though each is unique and not similar to the Tel 'Ira figurine. It is not clear if these figurines represent hermaphrodite divinities, and data about such divinities in the Levant is scarce (Beck 1999: 392, figs. 7.7.9, 11). THE NATURE OF THE FIGURINE How should we interpret the Tel Beer Sheba fig- urine? Mischwesen creatures that combine human and animal features are well known from the an- cient Near East. Perhaps most famous is the Egyp- tian sphinx, which reached many cultures (e.g., Cyprus; Karageorghis 1996: 9-11). Sphinxes appear in Iron Age ivories and seals in Palestine (Keel and Uehlinger 1998: 234-35; 252-54; Beck 1995: 154) and are often related with the biblical Cherubim of the tabernacle, sort of throne-bearers (Schroer 1987: 121-30; Keel and Uehlinger 1998: 168). In pottery, winged sphinxes appear on Iron Age cultic stands from TaWanach and Megiddo, and one sphinx was found at Qitmit in the Negev, a site commonly inter- preted as an Edomite shrine (Beck 1995: 152-54; for the Edomite nature of Qitmit and En-Hazevah, see also Beck 1996; Cohen and Yisrael 1995). Stand- ing or crouching winged sphinxes appear on Hebrew seals, with either animal (falcon) or human heads (Avigad 1997: nos. 37, 44, 143, 182, 190, 193, 325, 369). A few seals can be related to the Kingdom of Israel (Avigad 1997: nos. 85, 116, 160, 370?), but some were bought in Jerusalem and may have orig- inated in Judah (Avigad 1997: nos. 182, 190, 325). On bullae and jar handles figurative representations are much more rare, but the sphinx does appear on one jar handle from Samaria (Avigad 1997: 167-263, no. 711). However, all these sphinxes cannot be com- pared with the Tel Beer Sheba figurine. They have lion bodies and wings, none is hermaphrodite, and features such as falcon head or crouching position are not compatible with the Tel Beer Sheba figurine. In Mesopotamia, the combination of man and bull is more common-the lamassu (adadlammu). One Palestinian seal of an unknown provenance probably shows this creature (Avigad 1997: no. 173; for the identification, see Sass 1993: 226, 236, figs. 124, 143). However, this seal is exceptional for Pal- estinian seals, and it probably originated in a Syrian/ Assyrian workshop, the Hebrew inscription being a later addition. Hence, the figure on this seal does not necessarily indicate local beliefs in Israel and Judah. Another Mesopotamian creature was the "lion centaur" or "lion-man" (Urmahlullu) (Green 1995: 1848-49). Wiggerman (1992: 181, 188 fig. 8) sug- gested that it was rare and also late to appear in Mesopotamia, and that its origin was perhaps in Greek centaurs. In any case, this creature is also dif- ferent from the Tel Beer Sheba figurine: it is not a hermaphrodite and the animal is a lion, not a horse. While Near Eastern cultures were fascinated by creatures that combine lion/bull and man, the Ae- gean sphere was preoccupied with the combination of man and horse---creatures such as centaurs and</page><page sequence="7">2003 AN IRON AGE HERMAPHRODITE CENTAUR 33 satyrs (Osborne 1994: 55). Centaurs are well known from Greek myths as wild and often dangerous crea- tures of nature, desiring wine and women, roaming woods and mountains of northern Greece in hordes, though two are singled out as wise and civilized exceptions: Chiron and Pholus (Hornblower and Spawforth 1996: 308-9; de Ronchaud 1887: 1010- 12; Ley and Walde 1999: 413-15). Centaurs appear in many types of representations, from large sculp- tures to painted vases and bronze and clay figurines, and are a Greek invention, not an import from the Near East (Schiffler 1976: 162). The earliest clear representation of a centaur is found in a tenth cen- tury B.C. figurine from Lefkandi (Schiffler 1976: 11- 12, 77-80; Desborough, Nicholls, and Popham 1970: 21-30).2 Greek centaurs in the tenth to seventh cen- turies B.C. are male, and they have a full human body, attached to the hind part of a horse. The cen- taur with four animal legs is a later development. Wooden branches or sticks are their most clear at- tribute, and they serve the centaurs as weapons. More rarely, centaurs hold hunted wild animals in their arms, yet centaurs with helmets or wings or holding lions are a very rare exception from areas outside Greece proper (Schiffler 1976: 163-65; cf. Karageorghis 1991: 26). The figure of the centaur begins to change during the seventh century B.C. It becomes wilder in Attica (e.g., shown naked, with wild hair), or has more animal-like features in other areas of Greece. While many Greek "monsters" went out of fashion, the centaur became even more popular and was transformed during the fifth cen- tury B.C. It was made to represent forces opposing Greek culture, yet was individualized and "human- ized." For example, we suddenly find dressed or bald centaurs (Osborne 1994: 53-84; von Blancken- hagen 1987: 86-87; Schiffler 1976: 167-69). The famous painter Zeuxis made a revolutionary picture of a family of centaurs. This picture was lost, but from written descriptions of it we know that it was very influential, and as a result representations of families of centaurs appeared, with centauresses and baby centaurs (von Blanckenhagen 1994: 87-88). Furthermore, centaurs became related to Dionysus, and happy, bacchic centaurs appeared, holding wine- drinking and musical paraphernalia (von Blancken- hagen 1987: 88-90; Schiffler 1976: 169). The closest parallel to the Tel Beer Sheba figu- rines is found in Cypriote centaur figurines (fig. 5). Centaurs appear quite early in Cyprus. At Ayia Irini, two centaur figurines are dated to Period 2, roughly the tenth-ninth centuries B.C. They both seem to be hermaphroditic and are probably a local Cypriote "invention" (Karageorghis 1991: 25-26; 1993: 69, pl. 30:6-7). Centaurs are much more common in the following archaic period of Cyprus. Most of them are male and have beards. Most are found in tem- ples, but some are known from other contexts such as burials and houses. Some are very large (up to about 60 cm in height); others are small (around 10 cm high). The small ones are often hand-made and solid, while larger ones are hollow, wheel-made, often with hand-made heads attached to the horses' bodies. They often hold animals, birds, or weapons in their human arms, and some are depicted with snakes, or with short tunics. Many Cypriote centaurs are hermaphroditic, especially a large group from Ayia Irini, dated roughly to the seventh-sixth cen- turies B.C. (Monloup 1984: 107, no. 438; Karageor- ghis 1991: 25-27; 1996: cat. nos. 3-10). Most of these hermaphroditic centaurs have male (human) organs applied at the front, below small female breasts. The head is male, as far as can be judged (e.g., shown by long beards; Karageorghis 1996: 1- 9, pls. 1-6). However, at least one of the Ayia Irini centaurs has male animal genitals placed between its rear legs, exactly like the Tel Beer Sheba figurine (Karageorghis 1996: 6, cat. no. 12, pl. 4:3). It is possible that Cypriote "centaurs" can be traced back to two bicephalic figurines from the "Ingot Temple" of Enkomi, dated roughly to the 11th century B.C. These have human heads and hol- low animal bodies, but the bodies are schematic and can also represent bovines. Karageorghis calls them "centaurs" but does not mean that they are equiva- lent to Greek centaurs, because Greek centaurs have hands and horse bodies (Karageorghis 1993: 50-52). It is rather difficult to draw a sharp line between centaurs and other horse and man combinations. Desborough, Nicholls, and Popham (1970: 28) see the Lefkandi and Ayia Irini figurines (including those from Period 2) as true centaurs and believe that the different attributes in comparison with Greek cen- taurs do not merit an independent typological defi- nition. Yet, they name the two earlier creatures from Enkomi "sphinxes," not centaurs. Schiffler (1976: 87-89, cf. 161) is more strict. In her view, all the figurines from Ayia Irini belong to a different genre and are not centaurs. Unlike Greek centaurs, they 2Ippolitoni Strika (1977) traced the origin of the centaur back to the Neolithic culture of Catal H6yiik in Anatolia. This remains in doubt, in view of the lack of a direct line of development and the considerable time gap involved.</page><page sequence="8">34 KLETTER AND HERZOG BASOR 331 I i?-?r' .:; ?~r, -?? ?r L-\: ;t I'i ~?(~?. -rr. ~?`'C;i ~-~?s. 1'= I 8` t4 I.. s?as ;I ~ ,? :?; ??~? ~yji?'?

A Cypriote centaur from the area of Salamis (after Karageorghis 1996: 3, fig. 1). have horns, snakes, helmets, shields, and bisexual features. On the other hand, they lack typical cen- taurs' attributes, such as a wooden branch for a weapon. Hence (Schiffler 1976: 88), "Man sollte dies vielmehr, um Missverstaindnisse auszuschalten, vermeiden und die neutrale Bezeichnung Pferde- oder Rossmensch fiir sie verwenden." However, the representation of centaurs saw a radical transfor- mation during the sixth and fifth centuries B.c. in Greece itself, as mentioned above. Yet, Schiffler rightly also calls the later representations centaurs. The same logic must apply to the Cypriote material. Following Karageorghis (1991: 27), Cypriote cen- taurs imply variants of Greek centaurs. It is impos- sible to deny the thematic relationship or to separate arbitrarily between "true" Greek centaurs and such Cypriote representations. We should call these Cyp- riote figurines centaurs, for we lack any better name. Of course, the Cypriotes could have adopted the idea but used it in different contexts and meaning from those ascribed to centaurs in the Greek myths. Following this reasoning we define also the Tel Beer Sheba figurine as a centaur, without implying that its function and meaning are exactly identical to those of Greek centaurs. Furthermore, the Tel Beer Sheba centaur is related to Cypriote, rather than Greek, centaurs. The figurine is also not identical with Cypriote centaurs, the main difference being the lack of hands. The identification is strengthened by the deliber- ate addition of two features to the Beer Sheba figu- rine: genitals and ears. These features are not found on Judaean figurines; thus their addition sets this fig- urine apart. The addition of genitals on the body of the horse was already discussed above. The addition of ears on the human face, after molding, calls for explanation. Why are ears needed? If these are hu- man ears, their addition is superfluous, for the head</page><page sequence="9">2003 AN IRON AGE HERMAPHRODITE CENTAUR 35 is human in any case and one could assume that the ears are just hidden by the hairdo. The addition of human ears would not alter our perception of the face. It seems that the ears were specially added in order to differentiate this face from similar faces of Judaean pillar figurines. Most probably, they denote not human but horse's ears, and this is why they are large and triangular-too large in relation to the delicate face. Such ears are typical of Greek cen- taurs, and especially centauresses, although they ap- pear only since the sixth century B.C. Later, such ears are canonical and the few exceptions are prob- ably late copies of classical Greek representations (Schiffler 1976: 166, 169-70). Animal ears were also shown, according to the descriptions, on the centau- ress in Zeuxis' picture (Schiffler 1976: 87, n. 281), and they appear on Cypriote centaurs as well. CONCLUSIONS The Tel Beer Sheba figurine was locally made, and it represented a centaur, related to the Cypriote conception of centaurs during the Iron Age II. The figurine is not the only evidence for connections between the Negev of Judah and Cyprus. A group of people called Kittim/Kittiyyim are mentioned in the Arad Ostraca and in the Old Testament (Isa 23:1, Ezek 27:6; Jer 2:10). These people were often con- nected with the Aegean region or with Kition in Cyprus, and identified as foreign mercenaries (Aha- roni 1981: 12-13, 114; Garfinkel 1988: 28-29; Wen- ning 1991b: 214-15; Niemeier 2001: 18). Rainey (1987: 25) interpreted the Kittim as traders from Ki- tion of Phoenician ethnic origin (cf. Herzog et al. 1984: 31; Heltzer 1988: 167-70). Lemaire (1977: 159-60) discussed the idea that the Kittim are trad- ers and not mercenaries. Na'aman (1991: 45 n. 56; 48 n. 60) accepted the view that these were merce- naries, but suggested that they were in the service of Egypt, not Judah. Dion (1992) supported the view that Kittim in the Bible encompass not only people from Kition, but from Cyprus and possibly from Greece as well (for the Kittim, see also Segert 2000; for Greek mercenaries in the Levant, see Niemeier 2001). Whether Phoenician, Cypriote, or Greek, if we maintain that the Kittim are connected with the city of Kition, it shows a link between Cyprus and Judah-from the same period as the Tel Beer Sheba figurine. As is well known, orientalizing features from the Levant reached Greek art via Cyprus dur- ing the archaic period (Markoe 1996, with refer- ences). Garfinkel (1988: 27-30) identified a person called Qrsy in Arad Ostracon no. 18 with Mls Hkrsym in Cypriote inscriptions and understood it as an ethnic title of a mercenary in Arad, "thus a double link is formed between Arad and Cyprus through the Kittites and Kerosites" (Garfinkel 1988: 30 n. 26). In the excavations of Tel Beer Sheba itself a fragment of an impressed vessel was found, and pet- rographic analysis by Y. Goren indicates that it orig- inated in Cyprus (the vessel will be published by L. Singer-Avitz and R. Zadok in the final report of the site; for other foreign items at Tel Beer Sheba, see Singer-Avitz 1999). Finally, one must ask, why does a centaur appear in Iron Age Judah? Until now, neither the Old Tes- tament sources nor archaeological remains give evi- dence about the presence of this creature there and then. The centaur was basically a Greek/Cypriote figure. Even if, remotely in its origin, it had some- thing to do with Near Eastern composite creatures such as the sphinx and the lamassu, it is not similar to them and has a distinct nature of its own. In Judah, this figure occupies a very rare and exceptional po- sition, lacking mention in written sources or com- mon repetition in art. Hence, it indicates a sporadic contact between Cyprus and Judah, weaker than the ties between the coastal plain and Cyprus. The exact circumstances allude us, but the most probable sce- nario for explaining the Tel Beer Sheba centaur is through indirect cultural contact. The local potter who added the genitals and ears when producing this figurine knew something about Cypriote centaurs. He could receive his inspiration from a Cypriote mer- cenary in Judah, or from a Cypriote figurine that reached Beer Sheba by trade, or from a Judaean who saw a similar figurine in a coastal town in Philistia. In any case, the centaur never gained popularity in the context of Judaean religious beliefs.
