<plain_text><page sequence="1">BEYOND THE FRONTIER A Reconsideration of Cultural Interchange Between China and the Early Nomads ESTHER JACOBSON In a recent article, "The Steppe Connection," Emma Bunker calls for a reconsideration of the interrelationship between China and the steppe nomads during the period of the Eastern Zhou.1 She is concerned with both the artistic tradition often referred to as "animal style" and the extent to which it influenced or was influenced by the art of Zhou China. Among those elements frequently said to have derived from the steppe nomads may be included a taste for rich inlay applied to weapons and objects of personal adornment, specific object types such as the belt hook and the bronze standard;2 certain pictorial formulations that may have catalyzed figural ornamentation of bronze vessels in the late Zhou, and specific motifs such as realistic animals, animal combat, recumbent deer, and appliqu^like profile animals. Bunker's position is that some of these elements, such as the animal combat, may have come out of the nomadic tradition but that Chinese interest in these elements did not last. Naturalism, sometimes said to have been derived from the nomads, was actually not characteristic of their artistic expression, nor were the large bronze standard tops, which steppe people would find too cumbersome for a nomadic lifestyle. In conclusion, Bunker argues that China was not the borrower; rather, her nomadic neighbors borrowed "much of their artistic vocabulary from the urban civiliza tions with which they came in contact, frequently altering it to suit their own taste."3 In assessing the nature of the "steppe connection" with reference to artistic traditions, Bunker concludes that the steppe people were considerably more dependent upon China and western Asia than the reverse. Bunker's article appropriately encourages reconsidering the question of artistic interchange between early China and the nomad world of eastern Eurasia. The issue of interchange has been addressed earlier on several occasions, most notably by Bernhard Karlgren and Charles 0. Weber." Weber's is the most carefully detailed and useful discussion, set as it is within the context of</page><page sequence="2">202 Beyond the Frontier a study of late Zhou pictorial vessels. Considering all the motifs related to steppe art and pertinent to a study of Zhou vessels, including those referred to by Karlgren, Weber comes to the following conclusions: certain elements probably did come into Zhou art from the nomadic world, but they could not be called "basic, formative elements in the pictorial-vessel" tradition. Where the Chinese borrowed, they decisively changed motif and style to make it their own. Borrowing was for the purpose of adaptation and enrich ment of native traditions.5 I would argue that Weber's conclusions remain essentially correct. A number of circumstances, however, encourage reconsidering the question of artistic interchange. Most importantly, archae ological finds of the last twenty years have significantly extended resources available for a study of Chinese-nomadic relations. Newly discovered sites and objects offer increased opportunity for chronological certainty, where earlier scholars depended almost solely on unprovenanced materials. This is true of material coming out of major sites within present-day China6 as well as extensive material excavated in Mongolia and South Siberia.7 With that more certain archaeological record has emerged a greater understanding of the complex early nomadic world. What Late Zhou China knew was only the southeastern edge of a vast cultural continuum that stretched as far north as the Trans baikal and the Minusinsk Valley and as far west as the South Russian steppe. Referred to by different appellations according to region and historical perspective—for example, Scythians, Sauromatians, Massagetae, Saka, Yuezhi, Xiongnu—these people shared in common a number of culturally indicative characteristics. Moreover, that part of the Eurasian nomadic world, the Xiongnu, which most forcefully engaged Chinese consciousness, was the last expression of a cultural tradition that had emerged centuries before in the early first millennium B.C.E. Xiongnu finds from the Ordos now indicate an artistic tradition and cultural context far more complex than we had previously understood. This is even truer of the stock-dependent cultures of northern Mongolia and South Siberia, from which the Xiongnu seem to have emerged. Within China's borderlands and farther to the north and west, the archaeological record is now so rich that old questions come forward more insistently and with far greater historical complexity. These questions regard the ethnogenesis of ancient and modern Inner Asian peoples, the origins of stock dependency and the relationship of nomadism to the emergence of statehood, the relationship of visual symbols to mythic traditions, and the formation of the great Inner Asian epic tradition.</page><page sequence="3">Esther Jacobson 203 These several issues encourage us to reexamine traditional understandings of Chinese-nomadic relations and cultural inter change. As we rely on more certain data, and as that data becomes more complex in its implications, we may find that terms acceptable in the past are no longer either particularly useful or even appropriate. The first purpose of this paper, therefore, is to reexamine specific instances of presumed artistic interchange between Zhou China and the steppe nomads in order to clarify the relationship between those two worlds. To do so, I will discuss a number of techniques, object types, motifs, and stylistic character istics that have not been considered by Weber, or only cursorily considered, and that Bunker and others have referred to as either indicative of nomadic influence or as unlikely to have derived from a nomadic source. The second purpose of this paper is to reconsider our traditional terms of discourse and the concepts underlying those terms. STONE AND METAL INLAY It is curious that although inlay of turquoise and malachite was frequently used to embellish Shang and Early Zhou ceremonial weapons, it was not used in the preparation of ceremonial vessels.8 To lend dramatic effect to the surface of the latter, a black organic material may have been pressed into the spaces between raised lines and bands. This technique, together with the broken texture of the originally warm red-gold bronze, attests to an established taste for strong coloristic effects. Only in the case of weapons were textures and bronze color further embellished by inlay. Typically, small rough-cut pieces of stone would be laid into a broad trough of the raised decor. The inlay thus took the form of a strong band of bluish green; occasionally it even occurred as an overall texture.9 Animal-headed daggers with rounded cells for inlay have been recovered from sites associated with a Late Shang or Early Western Zhou date. Typically, the animals represented are rams, goats, or possibly horses. Typologically and stylistically, these daggers indicate an intrusion from the north. Two daggers, one horse-headed and one ram-headed, were recovered from Xiaotun.10 An elegant knife with ram-headed pommel and the remains of turquoise inlay in the cellular nostrils and eyes has been dated to the Shang period. The treatment of the ram's head is similar to that found on a dagger said to be of Karasuk date, found in the Minusinsk region and close in spirit to another Minusinsk knife terminating in the head of an elk.11 A ram-headed knife housed in the Stockholm Museum of Far Eastern Antiquities retains in the cells of the eyes and those terminating the horns the remains of inlaid malachite. The shape of</page><page sequence="4">204 Beyond the Frontier this animal head is almost identical to that on a dagger recovered from Chaodaogou, Qinglong Xian, Hebei. This dagger is dated by Wu En to the Late Shang-Early Zhou and associated by him with examples known from Mongolia and the Baikal region.12 Frequently referred to as Karasuk in type, these animal-headed knives are clearly associated with a non-Chinese bronze-making center contemporaneous with Late Shang-Early Zhou. Although Karasuk has been most closely associated with a South Siberian location, its source and center remain the subject of heated debate.13 Distinc tively characteristic of this Karasuk type is a particular manner of shaping nostrils, eyes, and sometimes horn tips, as rounded cells for the setting of inlaid stones. This technique has generally been associated with bronze weapons only. However, a fine pair of gold pins from Mongolia, the ends of which terminate in ram heads similar to those of the Stockholm and Chaodaogou knives,1" indicate that a tradition of inlaying gold also existed. These pins point to early steppe techniques and taste for inlaying precious metals with colored stones. Both materials would be fully exploited for inlay in the succeeding period. Both bronze weapons and gold pins represent a form of embel lishment markedly different from that of Shang workmanship, indicating on both sides original and established styles of inlay. However, the fact that the Shang-Early Zhou craftsmen so embellished only bronze weapons, not vessels, raises the possibility that the idea if not the style of inlaying metal with stones was stimulated in some degree by a more northern tradition of weapon ornamentation. If this were the case, the Shang-Early Zhou inlaid ceremonial weapons would represent an early instance of a specifically Chinese artistic playfulness in which a foreign formulation offered the point of departure for a sophisticated artistic digression. Inlay disappeared from Chinese bronze casting during the Western Zhou and did not significantly reappear until the sixth century or even later.15 At that time Chinese bronze craftsmen enthusiastically embraced the use of inlay of gold, silver, and copper, as well as that of semiprecious stones.16 The manner in which the metals were inlaid has no parallel in known contem poraneous objects from the nomadic tradition. Nonetheless, as Bunker has indicated,17 the particular style of representing pictorial motifs with inlaid metal may well deliberately reflect the nomadic tradition of ornamenting objects of wood and felt with appliquS of felt, leather, and cut gold leaf (Fig. I).18 The frozen burials at Tuekta and Pazyryk in the Gorno-Altai testify to a mature tradition of appliquS as early as the sixth or the fifth century.19 The whimsical marking of joints and muscles on so many profile animals on inlaid bronzes (Fig. 2) appears certain to have derived from a</page><page sequence="5">Esther Jacobson 205 Fig. 1. Felt appliques from shabracks. Pazyryk burials. Gorno-Altai.</page><page sequence="6">206 Beyond the Frontier widespread nomadic tradition of marking zoomorphic motifs with interior scrolling.20 Within the nomadic context, this stylistic characteristic appeared on objects of diverse material: gold, bronze, felt, and wood. Although some have argued that such interior scrolling was necessarily derived from Near Eastern conventions, the question remains debatable.21 Whatever one's conclusions regarding that question, clearly the interior marking of musculature consti tuted an established convention in the art of the Inner Asian nomads by the late eighth to the early seventh century;22 moreover, the Chinese would have come into contact with their objects, rather than with either seals or monumental sculpture of the Achaemenids.23 If the appliquelike forms on Zhou vessels were inspired by nomadic decorative traditions, it is also likely that the Chinese return to the use of precious metals was stimulated by a new awareness of decorative possibilities demonstrated in nomadic gold work. Through the burials at Tuekta and Pazyryk the nomadic use of gold, even to ornament leather, fur, and wood, is best known. But among the many other burials where it is apparent may be cited Arzhan, in Tuva (eighth to seventh century); Chiliktin, in Eastern Kazakhstan (sixth century); Issyk, in Southeast Kazakhstan (fifth century); and such well-known burials in Pontic Scythia as Kelermes, Kostromskaya, and Ulski, all dating to the sixth century.2" The broken finds at Alagou in Xinjiang indicate that the elaborate decorative possibilities of gold appliqufe found at Issyk were probably recreated in nomadic burials within the Chinese border lands.25 The Zhou return to the use of inlaid stones emerged in the period when a nomadic presence was increasingly felt within the Central Plain. It is therefore likely that the inlaid plaques of the nomads provided an exotic model of decorative possibilities. The finds from the Warring States Xiongnu site at Aluchaideng, in the Ordos, indicate the presence of traditional nomadic inlay techniques close to the Central Plain and the increased possibility of Chinese familiarity with those techniques (Fig. 3).26 Although it is precisely the gold and semiprecious stones that have almost completely disappeared from the burials of the early nomads, there is ample evidence that the tradition of inlaying stones into gold or bronze had continued from the Karasuk down into that period, that is, mid-first millennium B.C.E. At the plundered royal burial of Arzhan were found scraps of gold and pieces of turquoise.27 From barrow number 5 at Chiliktin were recovered four plaques of recumbent reindeer done in gold, with ears (and origi nally eyes?) inlaid with turquoise.28 Although unprovenanced, the stone-inlaid gold objects from the Siberian Treasure of Peter the Great clearly establish the nomadic mastery of inlaid ornamentation throughout the latter half of the first millennium B.C.E.29</page><page sequence="7">Esther Jacobson 207 Fig. 2. Inlaid dou. Shanghai Museum. Fig. 3. One of a pair of gold inlaid plaques. Aluchaideng, Inner Mongolia.</page><page sequence="8">208 Beyond the Frontier This tradition is confirmed by the Xiongnu finds at Aluchaideng, mentioned above. The appearance at that site of richly inlaid gold objects based on zoomorphic representation, considered in connection with materials from Arzhan, Chiliktin, and elsewhere, testifies to the essential unity and continuity of early nomadic culture from South Siberia down into the Ordos and from as early as the seventh century down into the period of the Xiongnu confederacy. Nomadic taste was obviously different from that of the Chinese craftsmen: the nomads preferred strong contrasts between warm colored gold and large dark stones. They used such contrasts to emphasize ears, eyes, nostrils, hoofs, and joints, or simply as a coloristic surface pattern.30 Chinese taste in the Zhou period more often dictated the embedding of stones in abstract designs charac terized by linear emphasis.31 OBJECT TYPES The Clothing Hook The clothing or belt hook is frequently cited as one object reflecting a Zhou delight in nomadic ornamental traditions. Existing literature on the Chinese clothing hook is extensive.32 The Chinese hook is typically shaped in a broad arc with an animal-headed hooked end. The other end is backed by a post and cap by which the hook would be attached to one end of a strap or to a heavy article of clothing. Zhou hooks varied greatly in size, from small practical objects to others probably too large to be anything but ceremo nial-33 Although it seems reasonable to suspect that the clothing hook would come from the nomadic tradition, the archaeological record does not make that clear, except possibly as a concept in connection with clothing suitable for horseback riding. In the pre Xiongnu period, the steppe inhabitants of northern Mongolia and South Siberia used bronze objects fitted with a strong hook at one end and a hole at the other for attaching a strap (Fig. 4).3" It is unclear, however, whether these hooks were intended to attach the ends of a belt or to hang objects from belts or saddles. On the anthropomorphic deer stones that date to the mid-first millennium 8.C.E. and are associated with nomadic cemeteries in northern Mongolia and Tuva, belts are clearly indicated, but not belt hooks (Fig. 5). However, objects such as daggers, whetstones, and hammers are shown hanging from the belts, as if attached by hooks (Fig. 6).35 Elsewhere one finds evidence of a clothing hook with a large round opening for attaching a strap or belt.36 Only within the Ordos do the nomads appear to have adopted the traditional Chinese garment hook.3 7</page><page sequence="9">Esther Jacobson 209 Fig. 4. Bronze hooks. Sagli-Bazhi II, Tuva. fN R rf £ tr / Fig. 5. Deer Stone. Mongolia.</page><page sequence="10">210 Beyond the Frontier It is sometimes assumed that the rho-shaped gold plaques found in the Siberian Treasure of Peter the Great served as paired belt plaques and thus as the more common form of belt clasp within the nomad world. Rudenko has pointed out that most of these plaques are too large and heavy to have been carried on a belt or even on fabric. But many are fitted on the back with small loops, indicating that they were attached to some heavy backing, such as leather.38 Rather than having a functional purpose, paired plaques were probably used in some purely ornamental or ceremonial capacity, either worn on a heavy garment or used as part of a horse regalia.39 As an ornamental indication of rank and ritual, they would suggest a parallel to and possibly precedent for the ornamental Chinese clothing hook. Until rather recently, the exact use of the rectangular plaques associated with the Xiongnu was also unclear. In grave number 100 at the Ivolga fortified settlement in the Transbaikal, the buried woman was fitted with two belts. The under-belt was equipped with a small bronze buckle while the upper-belt centered on a plaque with the representation of a battle between two tigers and a dragon."0 Other finds have confirmed that similar rectangular plaques, as well as more buckle-shaped forms, were attached to belts;1,1 how they would be used to attach the belt ends remains uncertain. This is true even in the case of plaques equipped with small protruding hooks."2 Like the elaborate gold plaques from the Saka burial at Issyk,"3 they were probably used to ornament the belt itself, the ends of which were then attached through some unknown means. Neither the large ornamental plaques known through the Siberian Treasure nor more modest types, such as those found in Saglin period cemeteries in Tuva"" or in Xiongnu sites, have any counter parts in the culture of Zhou China. Only in the hooklike forms or in the occasional bucklelike object from Tuvan cemeteries (Fig. 7)"5 is there any suggestion of the Chinese garment hook. Indeed, the exact shape of the Chinese object and the manner of its elaborate inlay have no counterparts among surviving material from the nomads' gold inlaid plaques."6 The actual lack of shared types indicates that if the Chinese derived any aspect of the garment hook from the nomadic world, it was only its idea; clothing had to be bound at the waist to avoid entanglement, and the means to such binding offered opportunity for personal adornment. The Bronze Standard The famous bronze standards from tomb number 6, Pingshan Xian, Hebei, associated with the burial of a Zhongshan king from the</page><page sequence="11">Esther Jacobson 211 fourth century 8.C.E., have frequently been related to Central Asian steppe origins and nomadic traditions."7 This association has been disputed by Bunker, who points to the impracticality of carrying such large and heavy objects where portability of goods was essential."8 In fact, the use of bronze-headed standards is well attested in nomadic archaeology all across Eurasia. These standards would always be considerably smaller than those from Pingshan, and their crowns would almost invariably take the form of zoomorphic motifs such as standing sheep, goats, birds, or griffinated heads. Possibly the earliest dated standards are those with standing rams from Arzhan (Fig. 8)."9 Bronze standard tops are associated through chance finds with the Tagar culture of the Minusinsk Valley (Fig. 9a) and through excavated material with Tagar burials of the more northern Chulym-Yenisey forest-steppe.50 Similar objects have been recovered from Xigoupan and Yulangtai, Inner Mongolia, and from Shenmu, Shaanxi.51 Another form of standard head, looking like an openwork basket mounted with wild rams, is closely associated with the Tagar culture and may have been used to carry some kind of burning material (Fig. 9b).52 Impressive standards tops were also found in the sixth century Ulski burials in the Kuban river valley to the east of the Black Sea.53 Two of these standards were ornamented with large beaked heads, huge eyes and bells (as well as other elements). They are large enough (26 cm high) to have weighed more than the Tagar standards with single animals. How these standards were used, either by the Black Sea Scythians or their Siberian cousins, is not clear. Vadetskaia has argued persuasively that they were used to mark the four corners of the burial bier (Fig. 10), an opinion concurred in by a number of other Soviet scholars.5" The material from nomadic burials would suggest that the rare appearances of bronze standards in Chinese burials, of which the Zhongshan examples are the best known, do derive from a nomadic ritual form; but such intrusions had no lasting impact on the Chinese. Motifs Bunker refers to a number of motifs that may have entered Chinese bronze decor from steppe traditions. These include the bird with a hare in its claws, the recumbent deer, and the animal combat. She cites others, such as the coiled animal and felines "with heart shaped ears and crescent-shaped claws," which the nomads may actually have borrowed from the Chinese.55 Almost all of these, and several others, have been discussed in detail in Weber's study of Chinese pictorial bronze vessels and need not be considered here.56 His insistence on the Chinese habit of modifying anything borrowed from another tradition cannot be disputed. This habit of change is</page><page sequence="12">212 Beyond the Frontier Fig. 6. Images on a deer stone. Mongolia. Fig. 7. Bronze buckle. Dagan Teli I, Tuva. Fig. 8. Bronze standard heads in the shape of rams. Arzhan, Tuva.</page><page sequence="13">Esther Jacobson 213 particularly apparent in the case of the deer with folded legs and head held high (Fig. 11). Although this motif was most common within the Eurasian nomadic tradition, when it appears on a Chinese vessel, its original formulation is virtually unrecognizable. On an inlaid hu from the Fujii collection, Yurinkan, Kyoto,57 the recumbent deer on the neck register are rendered with the same curvilinear playfulness that characterizes the birdlike and catlike motifs on the vessel, as well as that of the abstract decor. By subordinating the subject to a display of style and by embedding the result in an overall decorative scheme, the Chinese artist departed radically from the handling accorded the deer motif in the nomadic tradition. In the latter case, the animal—alone, or in its reconstructed context (Fig. 12)—appears to refer to a mythic order that overrides decorative considerations.58 One motif mentioned by Bunker but only briefly considered by Weber is that of animal combat.59 This motif is still generally assumed to have entered the Chinese artistic vocabulary from the steppe cultures.60 Indeed, true "animal combat"—that is, animals actually locked in physical attack, rather than merely confronting each othei—may be said to be one of the most characteristic motifs of the steppe tradition. The scenes of predation marked in felt on shabracks from Pazyryk are good examples (see Fig. 1), as are the many images of combat on plaques associated with the Siberian Treasure or those from Inner Mongolian sites of the Warring States period.61 In every instance, the images keenly suggest the physical impact of one animal on another or an event of mythic proportions (Fig. 13). By contrast, the representation of a true animal combat in early Chinese art is highly unusual. The tiny modeled images of leopards attacking boar or of bears (?) in locked combat, found in the small bands of the Shanghai Liyu hu, are rare exceptions. Not until the early Han does one find images of animals in combat, as on an inlaid tube from Ding Xian, Hebei.62 One motif repeated at least twice on the Ding Xian tube, that of the tiger and boar or wolf combat, appears to be a direct quote from nomadic sources (Fig. 14). Again, however, the surrounding context, if not the treatment of the combat itself, assumes the appearance of a playful quote, in contrast to the sober intensity of nomadic versions of the same mot i f. Within the context of Zhou vessels, "combat" far more frequently takes the form of animals confronting each other in a whimsically formal challenge. This is apparent in the case of the Shanghai dou (see Fig. 2), as well as in many other examples of this type of pictorial vessel.63 On occasion, one animal will appear to be biting into the rump of another, as on the lid of an inlaid hu from Jiakezhuang, Tangshan, Hebei (Fig. 15).6*• The amusement</page><page sequence="14">Fig. 9.

Jiakezhuang, Hebei. conveyed by such scenes has no parallel within the nomadic tradi tion, just as the nomads' mythic confrontation of animals in gold, wood, and felt has no counterpart within the Chinese repertory. However, the Chinese combination of what I would call "pseudocombat" representations with an appliquSlike treatment of the images, and with the interior scrolling and marking of the animals' bodies (Fig. 16), strongly suggests that the motif of the combat did come from the nomadic world; but as sudden as was its reception, so also</page><page sequence="18">218 Beyond the Frontier its manner of representation immediately demonstrated a specifically Chinese decorative sensibility, in which one finds no interest in or even awareness of the iconic significance of the original animal combat theme. I will return to this issue below. Stylistic Characteristics: Naturalism The designation of priority in the naturalistic rendition of animals65 is troubled by the simple fact that most artistic traditions either begin from or come to such a stylistic treatment, whether that treatment is catalyzed by a foreign impulse or not. Moreover, naturalism is always relative because any artistic tradition seeks stylization as a means of more sharply rendering external forms and substance. If by "naturalism" we refer to a preference for representing real rather than fantastic creatures and to a manner of rendering an image with self-conscious reference to its natural form and without unusual idealization or exagger ation, then it must be admitted that sixth-century China did see the introduction66 of a new naturalism in treating animal images. These images frequently took the form of modeled bullocks, sheep, felines, or birds, recumbent or sitting on a vessel's lid.67 On the large Liyu hu in the Shanghai Museum68 a sharp contrast can be found between a traditional stylization and a new naturalism. Separating the dragonated bands are rows of modeled bear (?), boar, and tigers attacking men and leopards attacking boar. On the lower part of the vessel, modeled geese walk in file (Fig. 17). Others have pointed to the obvious and whimsical borrowing, here, of nomadic elements.69 The naturalistic treatment of the small animals can readily be compared with Siberian formulations of a contemporaneous date, such as the carved bone horse heads and bronze rams from Arzhan (see Fig. 8), as well as with the superb suggestion of musculature in the coiled feline from that burial (Fig. 18) and in its unprovenanced counterpart in the Siberian Treasure.70 In neither case, Chinese or Siberian, is naturalism unqualified. That of the nomadic tradition almost invariably emphasizes the muscularity of the animal as well as its mass to the point that stylization overwhelms the immediate impression of naturalism. In a somewhat parallel manner, the naturalistic animals appearing on Chinese bronzes, such as those on the Shanghai hu, are covered by stylized textures having little to do with the texture of the actual animal or bird's body. The stylized naturalism that results is radically different from that of the nomadic formulations. In each tradition, nomadic and Chinese, the craftsmen applied their attention to known animals: those of the field and marsh, in the case of China, and those of the steppe, forest, and mountains, in the case of the nomads. Furthermore, the nomads' animal imagery is almost always suggestive of an as-yet</page><page sequence="19">Esther Jacobson 219 Fig. 16. Motifs from an inlaid hu. King Kwei collection. Hong Kong. Fig. 17. Modeled geese on a Liyu hu. Shanghai Museum.</page><page sequence="20">220 Beyond the Frontier Fig. 18. Bronze plaque in the form of a coiled feline. Arzhan, Tuva. unclear but powerful mythic tradition, but that of the Chinese seems dictated by a sophisticated humor. Naturalism as a self-conscious style appears in Chinese art only in the sixth to the fifth century. By contrast, naturalism was an established Inner Asian tradition from a much earlier period down into the age of the early nomads. Rock carvings and paintings from the Neolithic and the Bronze ages (second and first millennia B.C.E.), found throughout South Siberia and Mongolia, attest to a striking concern for representing the observed animal. The images of elk from the Angara, the Tom, and the upper Lena rivers, for example, vividly recreate the animal's powerful body and stride, its large soft nose and heavy rack (Fig. 19). In representations of reindeer and maral from the Chulut River, dating to the early first millennium B.C.E., one finds a similarly acute sense of the real</page><page sequence="21">Esther Jacobson 221 (a) (b) Fig. 19. (a) Elk from Stone V, Tom River; (b) bull elk or reindeer from Tal'ma, upper Lena River. Fig. 20. Images of reindeer from petroglyphs along the Chulut River, northern Mongolia.</page><page sequence="22">222 Beyond the Frontier animal and a determined ability to recreate its alertness, power, and grace (Fig. 20).71 The deer stones of South Siberia and northern Mongolia indicate the continuity of imagery from the earlier petroglyphic tradition into the age of the early nomads. They also document the increasing stylization that emerged in certain parts of that nomadic world.72 This same petroglyphic tradition makes clear that naturalism continued to exist side-by-side with stylization, a combination that is also documented in bronze, gold, and wooden objects found in early nomadic burials.73 Given this long nomadic tradition of naturalistic rendition of wild animals and the fact that naturalism appears in Chinese art suddenly and combined with a very specific set of elements (e.g., rope patterns, animal combat themes, inlay), it seems probable that the Chinese adoption of naturalism was catalyzed by the same sophisticated taste that allowed Zhou artists to readopt and immediately adapt the use of stone inlay. To say that the nomads influenced Chinese naturalism is to infer a conscious exertion of priority where it did not exist. It probably brings us closer to the mark to say that the Chinese saw certain decorative possibilities, liked what they saw, and proceeded to borrow and change as quickly as they could. The expression of sophisticated humor and high decorative refinement characteristic of late Zhou bronzes is certainly due in large part to a willingness to borrow and immediately modify to suit native taste. REPRESENTATIONAL FORMULATIONS Pictorial Scenes The suggestion that the pictorial scenes in Zhou bronze decor may have been indirectly inspired by steppe art has been made on several occasions.7" In the sudden appearance of lively scenes of hunts and in the melee of wild and fantastic animals on Chinese vessels of the fifth to the fourth century, the sense of something exotic is found: a suggestion of an ebullient, if temporary, delight in things wild and unusual. The excitation of the animals and the profiles of strange men on foot confronting these animals are undeniably a reference, however imaginary, to a life free from the formal ritual embedded in the very existence of the bronze vessel. The only element represented in these scenes that may belong to the nomad world is the reference itself to something non-Chinese. The important element in these scenes is not the borrowing of imagistic elements from another tradition (i.e., that of the nomads); it is rather that one finds here the first determined, developed expression of a particular sophistication: the self</page><page sequence="23">Esther Jacobson 223 conscious reference to the other, to a decidedly different ("barbaric") lifestyle. This sophistication may mask at least two conflicting considerations. On the one hand, one senses that degree of patronizing distancing that allows the subordination of what might be essential in the life of one people to be turned into the stuff of playfulness in the tastes of another. On the other hand, there is the slightest suggestion that in turning attention to a foreign, wild, unconstrained existence in which strange men faced ferocious beasts in an unknown land, the Chinese artist and patron let slip a wistful regret for a life so seemingly untrammeled by ritual and order. This—the objectification of the other and the exploitation of its imagined forms for the pleasure of a Chinese sensibility—indicates one of only two significant pictorial "borrowings" from the non-Chinese world. Narrative Structure However, a development visible in bronze art of the sixth to the fifth century parallels a transformation in the art of the nomads and may have been catalyzed by the nomadic model. I would refer to this development as the emergence of narrative structure: the organization of visual images so that they tell a rudimentary tale through indicating action and response or cause and effect. Such narrative structure is faintly visible on the cover of the Jiakezhuang hu (see Fig. 15), where the bite of one animal is reflected in the surprised (?) open mouth of the other. Although this may seem like a development of minimal importance, in the history of the visual arts and in the development of narrative as genre it is not. In any tradition, the appearance of elements organized for the purpose of recounting action, however limited, marks the transformation of the visual imagination from a focus on iconic absolutes or merely decorative abstraction to purposes bound to human existence and social patterns.75 It is significant that narrative structure emerges on Zhou bronze decor at the same time that naturalism, scenes of predation, and references to wild animals and places appear. There are faint glimmers of its possible development in a Liyu pan of the sixth or the early fifth century from the Wannieck collection, Mus6e Guimet.76 On the exterior, the vessel is ornamented with a typical Liyu dragonated band. Along the upper surface of the lip are stamped incised and barely legible stags chasing from left to right. Within the broad interior of the basin are rows of alternating fish and turtles, while around the upper surface of the inner bowl waddling ducks imply the edge of a pond. Here there is no true interaction: each animal has its own existence, seemingly unaware of any other, and each animal type has its own spatial niche. But, in contrast to</page><page sequence="24">224 Beyond the Frontier the ornamentation of earlier pan dating back to the late Shang or early Zhou, one senses in the Wannieck vessel a deliberate attempt to create a coherent reference to an extended and thoroughly natural space: the fish and turtles indicating the water, the ducks the shore, and the deer the surrounding field and forest.77 In contrast to its exterior dragonated bands, the interior of the pan implies a natural world through naturalistic animals. This development of environment by implication was essential to the development of narrative structure. The decorative elements on the Wannieck vessel describe a transition from stylization to naturalism, from a system of hieratic images (exterior) to a concern with telling a rudimentary tale (interior). The process may also be glimpsed in the Shanghai Museum's fifth-century Liyu hu, mentioned earlier.78 There the conflict between two conceptual and imagistic traditions (formal, decorative, and hieratic versus naturalistic and realistic) is displayed on the outer surface of the vessel in alternating bands. In the dragonated bands, creatures twist and turn on themselves, or one claws the headless tail of another. There is no attempt to indicate any psychological interaction: no conscious action and response. By contrast, the geese in the lower register weave their long necks and heads, humorously suggesting the puzzled interaction of inquisitive fowl (see Fig. 17). In the band of modeled animals, a tiger savages a man. In the outstretched arm of the little human, as in the stretched limbs of the animal savaged by an adjacent leopard, there is evoked, however simply, physical and psychological action and response. The juxtaposition of animals on the interior of the Wannieck pan and the naturalistic animals on the hu imply an environment of narrativity: that is, one in which objects or events are recorded in such a manner that they "tell themselves" without recourse to a narrator.79 By the specificity of their naturalistic forms, the animals imply a familiar context (marsh, forest, field) in which occur familiar events. This statement of environment by implication and this rudimentary indication of narrative structure continues to be developed in the bronzes of the immediately succeeding period: those ornamented with the representations of ritual hunting and libation scenes and those of the "hunting" variety.80 Whether these changes occurred first in bronze decor or whether the bronze decor merely reflects a now lost painting tradition is beside the point.81 These images and scenes are important because they display an interest in grouping elements in psychological and physical interaction; and they indicate a recognition of the possibilities that then emerge for developing an extended and describable naturalistic space. It is essential to recognize that these two developments occur in the context of Chinese art only with the</page><page sequence="25">Esther Jacobson 225 appearance of naturalistic representation. This combination of developments, I would argue, indicates a stimulus from the nomadic world. Unfortunately for understanding the nomadic artistic tradition, we are too accustomed to considering it in terms of individual pieces: plaques separated from each other, wooden figurines and bronze standards isolated in pictorial drama on the pages of glossy catalogues. But that is not the way the images were originally seen. The harnesses, shabracks, masks, and fabrics preserved in the frozen barrows of Pazyryk demonstrate the extent to which each image was embedded within a larger narrative structure interweaving themes of mythic predation and transformation. Within these constructs, the physical impact of one animal on another occasionally conveys a momentary and intense psychological interaction (see Fig. 1). In the case of the reconstructed bridles from Pazyryk, the juxtaposition of images indicates a more archaic representation of mythic preda tion.82 On one bridle from barrow 5, for example (see Fig. 12), elaborate wolf-heads lead to cheekpieces that refer to great beaked birds; behind them, the snarling heads of felines face five twisted stags. The realistic scenes on the Pazyryk shabracks and objects from other finds83 instruct us on how to read this bridle. It unquestionably represents, in stylized form, the mythic predation of feline on stag and of wolf on bird. The intact burial at Issyk confirms the development of narrative structure and narrative environment in nomadic art by the fifth century B.C.E. The reconstruction of the Issyk headdress8" (Fig. 21) indicates the deliberate elaboration of a mountainous setting, with the hood itself taking the form of the principal mountain. Birds perch on trees, felines and goats leap through or over mountains, and a goat (rendered in solid gold) perches at the very top. Seen individually, the motifs are simply decorative renditions of animals in gold. Reset within a complete context, they are subordinated to a complex landscape setting in which the action and response of the felines and goats is definitely suggested .e5 The original headdress thus created rudimentary narrative within a visually explicit environment just as did the fully-dressed horses of Pazyryk. Issyk is dated by its excavator to the fifth century, thus contemporaneous with several Pazyryk burials. Although this date may be somewhat early,86 these burials, like many from Pontic Scythia, teach us how to reconstruct the bits and pieces from earlier sites. They indicate that by the fifth or the fourth century B.C.E., the nomads were already using some anthropomorphic imagery87 and that this imagery could bind figures in mutual action. By that time, also, animals were effectively joined to recreate mythic battles.88</page><page sequence="26">226 Beyond the Frontier Fig. 21.

After: Akishev, Kurgan Issyk, Figs. 62 and 63.</page><page sequence="27">Esther Jacobson 227 Objects such as the Pazyryk bridles, seen in conjunction with the more specific scenes of action and response, were invariably part of a larger image complex: carried on a horse, or on a large shield,89 and implicitly describing action and the environment of action.90 When the Chinese saw nomadic imagery, they saw it in that larger material context. Capes, headdresses, saddles, bridles, and an array of weaponry carried individual images that together elaborated narrative structures. Everything we know of nomadic art indicates that those motifs, separately and together, referred back to mythic traditions and cosmogonic formulations. To the Chinese eye, animals joined in complex combat merely represented a decorative opportunity but one with fascinating possibilities: naturalism, to make it more vivid; and narrative, more decisively to involve the viewer. At any other period in early Chinese history, such opportunities deriving from another tradition might have gone unnoticed. But China in the late Zhou was characterized by openness and fluidity—in its political institutions and philosophy, its social order, and its artistic taste. In describing the resulting transference of techniques, motifs, and tastes from the nomadic culture to that of China, terms such as "influence" or "borrowing" seem inadequate if not distorting. "Appropriation" perhaps better describes the manner in which Chinese craftsmen seized on nomadic elements as artistic possibilities; and it better suggests the concomitant lack of concern for replicating the substance of the nomadic imagistic complexes. Form rather than substance, surface image rather than mythic content—these interested the makers of inlaid vessels. Later, in the Qin and early Han, Chinese craftsmen would once again appropriate narrative possibilities from the nomadic world: those gave form to a new interest in the representation of landscape.91 That process lies outside the chronological scope of this discussion. It does, however, clarify the nature of China's relationship to the nomadic artistic tradition even at an earlier period. If nothing else, the nomadic world to China's north and northwest offered a constant alternative: in economy, in social order, in world view, in taste. It was, moreover, the only major continuous cultural alternative throughout early Chinese history. At the same time, it represented an integrated, consistent other. Since the beginning of the Zhou dynasty, a nomadic presence had been sporadically noted in state annals and felt in events accompanying the rise and fall of the northern and northwestern regions claimed by the various kingdoms.92 Perhaps only with Qin's vigorous offensives against the Xiongnu and with the Qin extension of the Great Wall did the nomadic presence begin to assume the character of a unified mass. Maodun's (209-174 8.C.E.) subsequent consolidation of the Xiongnu, following the beginning of Han acquisitive expansion</page><page sequence="28">228 Beyond the Frontier into the northern and northwestern steppe, unquestionably crystal lized a specifically Chinese consciousness of the nomadic world as a powerful, even self-confident opponent. But considered in terms of the emergence of Eurasian steppe nomadism, the Xiongnu mark the end of the culture frequently called Scytho-Siberian.93 It is true that the Xiongnu (along with the Kushans) represent the emergence of statehood among the Eurasian nomads, but cultural if not political unity was much older, linking subcultures across the Eurasian steppe from as early as the eighth to the seventh century. That culture was identifiable by a common stock-dependency, commonly held symbols (certainly indicating a common mythic tradition), weapon types, and burial rituals.9" In turn, the roots of Scytho-Siberian culture lay deep in Inner Asia's Neolithic and Bronze ages and involved the complex emergence of stock-dependency out of forest-dependent cultures.95 This discussion thus ends by corroborating Weber's conclusions and a number of Bunker's. Nothing here nor in the artistic history of the Inner Asian early nomads supports, however, Bunker's final assertion that the "steppe tribes created little, but borrowed much of their artistic vocabulary from the urban civilizations they came in contact with."96 With the sole exception of the animal combat, which may owe some of its development to Near Eastern conventions, no material can be used to corroborate Bunker's conclusion. In considering the range of the nomadic cultural tradition, from its emergence in South Siberia/Mongolia in the early first millennium B.C.E., one finds a marked degree of symbolic and stylistic continuity, even allowing for regional variations, as well as a consistent difference from the Chinese tradition. If one cannot speak of a continuous unified political entity with reference to the early nomads, one still faces a cultural depth that allowed remarkable continuity over time and space. For this reason, if for no other, the pejorative term "barbarian" misses the point. It seeks to control through a culturally biased designation a tradition of which China knew only the edge. By substituting for that term more accurate appellations (e.g., early nomads, steppe nomads, Xiongnu), it is possible to confront the reality of both nomadic culture and its political power vis-ct-vis Zhou and Han China. One may also argue that the general term, "animal style," has outlived its usefulness. It was coined by Rostovtzeff at a time when our knowledge of the nomadic tradition overwhelmingly depended on chance finds and excavations of often dubious scientific reliability from South Russia, as well as on chance finds said to have come from the Ordos.97 Since then, the situation has changed radically. We have learned to depend on scientifically-excavated finds and to understand the combination in nomadic art of unifying stylistic elements and regional differentiation. The material from</page><page sequence="29">Esther Jacobson 229 Pazyryk and petroglyphs from many sites in South Siberia and northern Mongolia clearly indicate a tradition of human represen tation, even if most of it has been lost. A number of studies further indicate that underlying the artistic variety generalized by the term "animal style" was an emerging tradition of oral epic literature, in which heroic human figures were beginning to take center stage.98 The inadequacy of "animal style" is also underscored by the simple fact that the iconographic tradition of Chinese art from the Neolithic down into the fifth century was almost completely centered on the zoomorphic image. No serious purpose is served, it would seem, in allowing the art of Shang and early Zhou a variety of terms that honor stylistic and regional distinctions while denying that very clarity to the art of the early nomads.

The gold plaques from Aluchaideng representing wolves with griffin-headed antlers must be related to plaques from the Siberian Treasure of Peter the Great not only by virtue of the particular use of inlay in gold but also by reference to the motif itself. The "snouted wolf" with bird-headed crest can be found in several plaques from the Siberian Treasure as well as on the tattooed man from Pazyryk and on the embroidered hanging from the Xiongnu burial at Noin-ula. See M. I. Artamonov, Sokrovishcha Sakov (Moscow: Iskusstvo, 1973), pis. 178, 194, 203; and Rudenko, Frozen Tombs, fig. 129 (where it is called a "horned monster").

The Aluchaideng plaques are important precisely because they corroborate the authenticity of plaques with similar motifs in the Siberian Treasure and because they reaffirm a broad artistic and possibly mythic unity within the world of the early nomads. The materials from Aluchaideng and their association with the larger nomadic tradition are the subject of a paper under preparation. 27. Griaznov, Arzhan. Griaznov's early dating for this barrow raises a number of problems that need to be carefully addressed.

Weber considers only the motif of the "predator attacking a herbivore." He specifically mentions two images of birds attacking or seizing hares and one representation of a canine grasping the muzzle of a deer. Weber concludes that the three images "were inspired by examples from the steppes which had fallen into the hands of the Chinese" (Chinese Pictorial Bronze Vessels, p. 229 and fig. 79/z,aa,bb). 60. See, also, The Great Bronze Age, p. 310. Bunker refers to the possibility that the combat motif actually derived from West Asia ("The Steppe Connection," p. 73). This issue is far too complex to address here; it suffices to say that although there is a pictorial relationship between nomadic formulations and those of the ancient Near East, there is ample evidence that such combat was represented by the juxtaposition of individual animals well prior to the intrusion of Achaemenid influence. This issue is tangentially addressed in Jacobson, "The Stag with Bird-headed Antler Tines," and will be considered in another article under preparation. 61.

Other examples of naturalistic animals in combination with stylized bronze decor include the recumbent bullocks on the lid of a four-legged Liyu ding, in the Louvre, and the small ducks on the lid of a round Liyu ding, also in the Louvre, both reproduced in Ludwig Bachhofer, A Short History of Chinese Art (London: B. T. Batsford, 1947), pis. 28, 49. 70. Griaznov, Arzhan, figs. 15, 25, 26; and Rudenko, Sibirskaia kollektsiia, pi. VI/#1. Also dating to the seventh to the sixth century are the damaged plaques of coiled felines from the Maiemir steppe, Gorno-Altai (Rudenko, Kul'tura naseleniia, fig. 3). 71. Petroglyphs of Siberia and Mongolia have been published in recent decades in a number of volumes by A. P. Okladnikov and colleagues. For references to some of these publications, too numerous to list here, see Jacobson, "Siberian Roots of the Scythian Stag Image," Journal of Asian History 17 (1983):68-120. 72. See Volkov, Olennye kamni; and V. D. Kubarev, Drevnie izvaianiia Altaia (Novosibirsk: Nauka, 1979). The dating of deer stones and their imagery is greatly debated, with some scholars believing that the evolution of the image went from stylized to naturalistic and others preferring to see the opposite course of development. Regarding this and the deer stones as transition from the earlier and contemporary petroglyphic tradition in South Siberia and Mongolia, see Jacobson, "Order and Selection in the Art of Pre historic Mongolia," forthcoming in Proceedings of the International Congress of Mongolists (Ulan-Bator, 1987). 73. This is particularly well demonstrated in the variety of imagistic renderings found within the Pazyryk barrows; e.g., two fine wooden carvings of reindeer were recovered from barrow 2. Bodies and attached leather antlers are rendered with great naturalism except for the exaggerated size of the antlers. In the same barrow was also found a man covered with tattoos, among which the masked deer (?) with bird-headed antlers are the most impressive. See Rudenko, Frozen Tombs, figs. 130, 131; pi. 137/G.H. 74. Great Bronze Age, p. 309. For a discussion of this point of view</page><page sequence="38">238 Beyond the Frontier and relevant sources, see Weber, Chinese Pictorial Bronze Vessels, pp. 199ff. 75. I have discussed this change and indicated its significance in an earlier article, Jacobson, "The Structure of Narrative in Early Chinese Pictorial Vessels," Representations 8 (Fall 1984)-.61-63. 76. Reproduced in Weber, Chinese Pictorial Bronze Vessels, fig. 9. 77. Contrast this interior with, e.g., that of a Shang vessel with incised decor from the Freer Gallery of Art ( The Freer Chinese Bronzes, I, pp. 34-39). There the interior of the vessel is dominated by a great coiled dragonated form. Around the outer edge of the dragon is a procession of alternating birds, felines, and fish. If one reads that procession as a series of three animals— fish, bird, feline—then there is created an amusing reference to the cycle of natural life, within a watery environment (represented by the dragon within the bowl). But the presentation of the animals demands the viewer's participation in their reorganization: fish in water, birds in air, felines on the land. 78. The Great Bronze Age, pp. 267-268. 79. See Jacobson, "The Structure of Narrative"; and see, also, Hayden White, "The Value of Narrativity," Critical Inquiry 7.1 (Autumn 1980):5-27.

On the reconstruction of the Pazyryk horse trappings, see Rudenko, Frozen Tombs and M. P. Griaznov, Pervyi pazyrykskii kurgan (Leningrad: Ermitage Museum, 1950). On the relationship of these image constructs to the emergence of a landscape reference, see Jacobson, "Mountains and Nomads." 83. See, for example, the large gold plaques of intertwined animals: tiger, wolf, and hoofed animal; yak, feline (?), and eagle; mythical wolf and tiger; and feline attacking a masked, antlered animal on whose body is superimposed an eagle with ram's head in its beak (fig. 13). All reproduced in Rudenko, Sibirskaia kollektsiia and in Artamonov, Sokrovishcha Sakov, pis. 175, 176, 178, 193. Regarding</page><page sequence="39">Esther Jacobson 239 more firmly datable counterparts to these plaques, see Jacobson, "The Stag with Bird-headed Antler Tines" and "Mountains and Nomads." 84. See K. A. Akishev, Kurgan Issyk (Moscow: Iskusstvo, 1978); and for a somewhat different reconstruction of the Issyk headdress, see A. K. Akishev, Iskusstvo i mifologiia Sakov (Alma-Ata: Nauka, 1984), pi. 1. 85. On the relationship of this headdress and other nomadic finds to the articulation of a naturalistic setting, see Jacobson, "Mountains and Nomads." 86. The dating of both these complexes must be carefully recon sidered in light of the many elements that refer to Achaemenid origins while indicating a developed regional variation. 87. Rudenko, Frozen Tombs, pis. 147, 154. 88. The repetition of certain motifs, e.g., the battle between wolf and feline or between eagle and feline, in early nomadic finds from sites in eastern Eurasia suggests that they refer to commonly shared myths rather than representing either totemic or shamanic battles. For discussion of such images with reference to totemic or Zoroastrian symbols, see V. F. Shtein, "Tseny zhertnoprinoshenii obozhestvlennym khishchnikam na sibirskikh plastinakh," in Bronzovii i zheleznii vek Sibirii (Novosibirsk, 1974); E. E. Kuz'mina, "Skifskoe iskusstvo kak otrazhenie mirovozreniia odnoi iz grup indoirantsev," in Skifo-sibirskii zverinii stil' iskusstva narodov Evrazii (Moscow, 1976); and Kuz'mina, "Ctsena terzaniia v iskusstve Sakov," in Etnografiia i arkheologiia Srednei Azii (Moscow, 1979). 89. The large gold panther from Kelermes was found in association with iron material suggesting that it had been mounted on either a breastplate or a shield. The large gold deer from Kostromskaya is said to have been intended as a shield plaque. See From the Lands of the Scythians, nos. 18, 28. 90. The use of animal imagery to generate an environment of narrativity is demonstrated by the gold and turquoise bird-cap from Aluchaideng (Tian and Guo, E-er-duo-si, pis. I, XLVIII). The golden bird has the form of an eagle with spread wings and powerful talons. Its turquoise inlaid head is on a movable hinge, thus allowing the bird to simulate the movements of a real animal. It stands on and over a four-part gold cap-shaped base. On each part of the base, the entwined figures of wolves and wild rams recreate the scene of predation, while the standing figure of the bird recreates the bird of prey hovering over a fresh kill. The combination of animals here echoes that found elsewhere in nomadic art: in the Pazyryk bridle,</page><page sequence="40">240 Beyond the Frontier mentioned above; in the fifth headdress from Pazyryk 1 (Griaznov, Pervyi pazyrykskii kurgan, fig. 10); and in plaques from the Siberian Treasure representing an eagle challenging a tiger and wolf for their kill (Artamonov, Sokrovishcha Sakov, pi. 175). 91.

Although not used in Western scholarship, the term "Scytho Siberian" has long been used in Soviet scholarly studies. It is useful for indicating the general unity of Eurasian steppe culture in the last half of the first millennium 8.C.E., while allowing for the existence of regional groups (e.g., Scythians, Sakas, etc.). 94. For a general overview of the art of that culture, see Jettmar, Art of the Steppes. 95. The emergence of steppe nomadism remains a disputed issue, one to which much literature has been devoted.
