<plain_text><page sequence="1">IV.-THE PERSONALITY OF THE EPICUREAN GODS. Before describing the extent to which the Epicureans attributed personality to the gods, it is important to bear in mind the place which Epicureanism gave to religion in life and the influence that the Epicurean school allowed to religion as a great impelling, uplifting influence for mankind. The ardor of Lucretius, Velleius and Philodemus is so intense that there is no gainsaying the testimony of these Epicureans. We are not to interpret their fervid testimony as an expression merely of the individual experiences of these three exponents, but as representing the explicit purpose of the founder of the school whose intent rested as a solemn obligation upon the conscience of his disciples. We learn from Diogenes Laertius 1 that Epi- curus' piety toward the gods was too deep for words; among the inalienable possessions of the virtuous man Epicurus 2 counted as of prime importance "holy opinions about the gods". The letter to Menoeceus closes as follows: Tavra ovv Kat ITO VTo0Lo voyyev- jLcATca rpos 'eaavTOV ',l/cpas Kat VVKT ... . .at ovSeTroTE oviO' virap ovr' ovap StaTapaXO6acr, ~~ciS E S 6 EC ev avOp-Tot.3 Lucretius had unbounded enthusiasm for his mas- ter and his master's definitive opinions about the gods and the proper worship of them. Velleius, too, was stirred by a pro- found admiration and reverence for Epicurus and had the mystic's rapture for the mighty power of Infinity that inspired 1Diog. Laert.

Philodemus came under the same spell of this dogmatic evangel and shared the conviction that worship of Epicurean gods of "surpassing power and goodness" was instinctive.' The same imperial power was exercised over the mind of Diogenes of Qenoanda' as late as two hundred years after Christ. The very first of the " Fundamental Maxims " of Epicurus is concerned with the question of divinity and we find: Ta MuaKapLov Kal J4Aaprov OVT,E aVTO 7rpay'LuaTa (XEL OuTeE a"kx rapCxEL, wOTre OVi7e OpyaL oTer xa'ptr avvexeTa ev aa0cvve y'ap 7raiv TO TOLOVTOV.3 The note that is appended to this, the first of the K'pLaL A0'6a&amp;, howsoever obscure in other respects, clearly comments on divine nature as beyond the reach of our senses, as recognizable in its essence through reason alone and as perfected in human form. It was inevitable that Epicurus should also associate with divinity supreme wisdom, beauty and justice.'

There was a remarkable freedom within these limitations,' allowing many a rapprochement between the Epicurean philoso- phy of religion and the orthodox beliefs that were the subject of reconstruction. The differences between the two systems have often been dwelt upon and the bitter hostilities between the two are well known; the points of contact, however, are more likely to escape observation. It will be my aim to prove that the Epicurean school carried over from the old religion definite concepts of individuality and personality that distin- guished one god from another,-whereby the gods were much more clearly visualized to the Epicurean vision than has been commonly conceded.2 The worshipful Epicurean who comprehended the essentials of Epicurean theology and who, following the dictates' of the founder of the school, engaged in established worship, found himself worshipping gods characterized and differentiated by a wealth of personal associations to which he could subscribe. The worshipful Epicurean was peculiarly subject to reactions from participation in cults that did honor to different divinities.

The Epicurean School waged war, not against the gods of Greece and Rome, but against the false popular and false philosophic notions about the gods.2 Con- scientious worship was no slight intellectual effort. There was much in the cults that to Epicurean intellectual piety seemed unworthy and untrue; all that was in violation of Epicurean denial of the old theory of divine Providence or all that was out of harmony with Epicurean ideal ethics of the Godhead was offensive to Epicurean reason, in worship. Epithets of yeve9XLos, &amp;auoo',opog and 4vrTakX/,os were, literally interpreted, false epithets as applied to Zeus, Demeter and Poseidon. Plu- tarch3 accused the Epicureans of plucking these appellations from the gods. Very true! but rebellion against false epithets, I mean to show, was part of a religious movement that aimed at establishment of pure and true concepts of Zeus, Demeter, Poseidon, and all the other gods of Greek religion. Philo- demus' concern was that the wise man should entertain pure and sinless opinions of God, should comprehend God's great and august nature, and especially at the festivals proceed to this knowledge.' The Lucretian exhortation was to the same effect, counselling the Epicurean worshipper to banish from his mind whatever was " degrading to the gods and inconsistent with their peace ".5 The Epicurean philosophy of religion and the Epicurean theoretic theology did not conflict with all of the ancient pagan premises, but could carry over whatever attributes met with the approbation of Epicurean sense, reason 1Philodemus, De Deor.

Epicurean worship permitted an acceptance of and emotional surrender to all truth and to all the symbolism to which the Epicurean could give intellectual assent. Let us take, as partially illustrative, Velleius' extended exposi- tion and criticism2 of the views of philosophers.3 Throughout runs a fundamental note, the Epicurean belief that the material- istic gods possess a form and organism such as we recognize in human creation to be superior to all others. The body of the gods is most beautiful, subject to neither bodily nor mental affections, free from the ravages of disease, age and oblivion, and not requiring sleep. The divine body is immortal,4 knowing no beginning and no end. Divinity experiences sensation and possesses reason, such as is in harmony with its body and possible only through the medium of the body. His happiness is that of the prudent and powerful God for whom quiet is a corollary of beatitude. This representation of the gods, quite in accord with the fundamentals of Epicurus himself, is obvi- ously a reconstruction of older beliefs with especial emphasis upon the cherished theory of anthropomorphism. Besides, Velleius resented as fatal to religion all tendencies towards spirituality, towards allegorizing, towards a differentiation between a natural god and popular gods.' He thought so much The logic of this situation was accentuated for every Epicurean at all serious in his religious inquiry by his emotional appreciation of the externals of noble ceremony. In the De Rerum Natura there is not much evidence to indicate the poet's emotional inclination to the ritua- listic and ceremonial side of the organized religion of the Roman people. The invocation and the account of the Magna Mater cult give us our only real clues. Other religious material is now and again em- ployed in the interests of poetry without provoking enthusiasm; temples, altars, groves, sacrifices, shrines and images of gods are all mentioned but appear as a poor symbolism to express divine immortality. Yet against this negative evidence we have the majestic description of the Cybele cult-bene et eximie . . disposta-and we read in it 'the pro- found influence of ceremonial upon the esthetic nature of Lucretius; cf. Philodemus, p. 128, vv. 5-12. 2 Cic. N. D. I IO, 25 ... 15, 4I.

Epicureans' participation in estab- lished religious ceremonials, sacrifices, worship, festivals and prayers of the national religion, their continued use of the old terminology of names and epithets, must have resulted in a preservation to a large extent of distinct personalities of a Zeus, a Hera, an Apollo, an Ares, a Dionysos, a Demeter, an Athena, an Aphrodite, a Rhea, a Hestia, a Hermes, or in Rome of Jupiter, Juno, Minerva, Vulcan, Ceres, Neptune, Bacchus, Magna Mater or of Venus.' It is difficult to see how Epicurean participation in organized Graeco-Roman religion could have resulted otherwise than in a maintenance of distinctions between the gods and goddesses of their worship. Velleius says that Zeno in his interpretation of Hesiod's Theogony entirely destroyed the established notions of the gods;2 for he excluded Jupiter, Juno and Vesta and those esteemed divine from the number of the gods. Again, in criticism of Chrysippus,' Velleius is indignant at the Stoic interpretation of Jupiter, Neptune, Ceres and other gods. Vel- leius wished to retain the concepts of Jupiter, Juno, Vesta, Neptune and Ceres instead of entirely destroying them as he conceived that the Stoics had done by their theories of origins.' Velleius' dogmatism is a protest in favor of older beliefs which the Epicureans did not attack as iconoclasts but as reconstruc- tionists, rescuing what was acceptable to Epicurean reason. The reply of the Academician and pontifex, Cotta,-unspar- ing ridicule and criticism of Velleius' exposition that it is- throws further light upon the question of the personality of the Epicurean gods. Cotta was opposed to limiting our conception of God to the human form and argued for greater freedom. He says: "Non pudet igitur physicum, id est speculatorem venato- 1I mention the names of these gods because they all come under dis- cussion in Epicurean texts. 'Cic. N. D. I 14, 36. 'Cic. N. D.

Cotta, on the other hand, undertook to rise above such local and temporal con- ditions. "Isto enim modo dicere licebit Jovem semper barbatum, Apollinem semper imberbem, caesios oculos Minervae, caeruleos esse Neptuni. Et quidem laudamus Athenis Vulcanum eum, quem fecit Alcamenes, in quo stante atque vestito leviter apparet claudicatio non deformis. Claudum igitur habebimus deum, quoniam de Vulcano sic accepimus." 2 Cotta contended that the Epicureans were too much attached to the old and he ridiculed the thought of the gods in human form as an arbitrary assumption of age and convention. " Quid, si etiam, Vellei, falsum illud omnino est, nullam aliam nobis de deo cogitantibus speciem nisi hominis occurrere? tamenne ista tam absurda defendes? Nobis fortasse sic occur- rit, ut dicis; a parvis enim Jovem, Junonem, Minervam, Nep- tunum, Vulcanum, Apollinem reliquosque deos ea facie novi- mus, qua pictores fictoresque voluerunt, neque solum facie, sed etiam ornatu, aetate, vestitu; . . . .

Tam hercle quam tibi illam vestram Sospitam, quam tu numquam ne in somnis quidem vides nisi cum pelle caprina, cum hasta, cum scutulo, cum calceolis repandis." Cotta's ridicule of Velleius and the Epicurean system carried him to extremes, no doubt, but the underlying significance of his stinging rebuke is clear. "Habebam, inquis, in animo insitam informationem quan- dam dei. Et barbati quidem Jovis, galeatae Minervae; num igitur esse tales putas ? "4 These passages from Cotta's review show plainly enough what was in Cotta's mind, viz., that he thought the Epicureans' conceptions of the separate gods were all too much influenced by earlier premises, that their theoretic, speculative theology 1Cic.

But this result was not only a possibility or even a probability, but indeed a psychological inevitability under all the circumstances,-determined by the original free- dom allowed under Epicurus' principalia, by Epicureans' con- tinued participation 2 in established forms of worship and by the profound Epicurean belief in the anthropomorphic nature of the gods,3 which facilitated this distinction 4 between divini- ties and the retention of those ideal characteristics of the individual gods not in conflict with the Epicurean definition of divinity. Epicureanism went beyond the old polytheism,' and that innumerable company of new gods remained nebulous and 1 See Picavet, p. I09, and Masson, p. 289, on the influence of sculp- ture upon Epicurean thought; also, Cic. N. D. I 30, 85 Novi ego Epi- cureos omnia sigilla venerantes. 2 Cf.

'The "physical constitution" of the Epicurean gods did not prevent an ascription to them of distinctive and differentiating noble personal qualities. Lachelier, Les Dieux D'Epicure, Rev. de Phil. I (I877), pp. 264-266; Scott, The Physical Constitution of the Epicurean Gods, Jour. of Phil. XII (1883), pp. 212-248; Guissani, Lucretius (I896), vol.

These arguments represent an effort to reproduce the doctrines of Epicurus about the "physical constitution" of the gods. The whole argument was part of esoteric Epicurean wisdom, "a recondite and technical doctrine", accepted as confirmation of the belief in the im- mortality of the gods. But as R. D. Hicks, Stoic and Epicurean (1910), p. 296 has said: "the identity of these cascade-like gods would, after all, differ from human identity in degree only and not in kind". 'Philodemus, p. 84, vv. 26-30; cf. also all arguments resting on the Itowpouia theory (e. g. Cic. N. D. I 19, 50). 324</page><page sequence="9">PERSONALITY OF THE EPICUREAN GODS. vague, comparable in a sense to the numina of old Roman religion and the umbrae of Roman eschatology. But a com- plete denial of the personalities of the old gods, crystallized to the Graeco-Roman imagination by a long period of time and process of thought, was not part of Epicurus' plan or an element in Epicurean speculation. The Venus-Aphrodite of the Lucretian invocation has not lost her personality. She possesses all the attributes of divinity as Epicureanism con- ceived divinity, but in inspiring grace and exalted beauty she is the goddess of the old Graeco-Roman world.2 In the aspira- tion of the Roman poet there exists a blending, in perfect harmony, of theological definitions with older, warmer attri- butes of divinity acceptable to Epicurean experience. Venus is addressed as queen of the skies, the earth and the seas, whose power animates all living things throughout the whole natural universe of which she is the chief ruler. But to the old idea of the goddess of regeneration a loftier significance is given.' The sensitiveness of Lucretius was peculiarly aware' of the insidious and compelling influence of nature's marvellous and majestic power over minds less courageous,-a power which in the thunder, in the lightning, in storms at sea, in appalling Si una omnium facies est (Cic. N. D. I 29, 80) is the hypothesis of hostile criticism which, levelling away all distinctions between Epicurean deities, contemplated an indistinguishable uniformity among these gods. Ridicule (Cic. N. D. I 27, 76; I 44, 123; II 23, 59; De. Div. II 17, 40) of these divinities was inevitable as well as bitter criticism (Cic. N. D. I 41, 115-II6; I 43, I21-44, 124) not only of worship of gods who did not appear to care for mankind, but also of the Epicurean employment (Plut. adv. Col. c. II, 1112 C; Non Posse Suav. Vivi sec. Ep. c. 21, II02 B; Origen. contra Cels. VII 66, in Usener, p. 259) for purposes of wor- ship, of the old machinery of cults, rituals and festivals. Despite cari- cature of the gods themselves, despite condemnation of Epicurean worship and prayer, in spite of charges of sham, hypocrisy and cow- ardice, the fact remains that for the sincere Epicurean the gods re- mained a reality and an entity of greatest inspirational value. The question of personality of the Epicurean gods must take some account of the explicit expressions and clear implications of Epicureanism itself. 2 See, for another view, Masson, p. 261. 3For interpretation of this Lucretian invocation as an Epicurean prayer, see Cl. Phil. II (1907), pp. 187-192, and T. A. P. A. xxxix (1909), p. 88.

Lucretius knew well that the natural human instinct of the Italian and his predisposition toward an animistic interpreta- tion of nature might readily influence the imagination of even one trained in Epicureanism to accept, again, the imperium of Roman gods as harsh task-masters of his destiny. But such a step was far removed from the natural and permissible Epi- curean retention of ideal associations of peace, beauty and love and predication of such qualities with the individualized Epi- curean goddess of the remote inter-mundia. Venus in a finer spiritual sense remains the delight of gods and of men and the blessed mother of the Aeneadae. In contrast to the tendency toward Universalism involved in Stoicism, the Epicureans by the terms of their philosophy of religion and by their religious experience were conservators of what seemed best in the older polytheism of Greece and Rome. Epicurus predicated immortality of the gods, and this imaginative flight of the idealist2 was his supreme effort to maintain the true gods of Hellas above all change and cor- ruption.
