<plain_text><page sequence="1">On the Cult of the Serpent by V. GULYAEV Institute of Archaeology, Academy of Sciences of the U.S.S.R., Dm. Ulianov 19, Moscow 117036, U.S.S.R. 1 VI 76 Mundkur's article (CA 17:429-41) contains much ethnological and ethnohistorical information on the snake cult both in the Americas and in the Old World. Despite its considerable informative value, however, the article lacks a central idea; it is too heterogeneous and eclectic. Moreover, the author never comes to any definite conclusions as to the origin of the snake cult in the New World. It remains uncertain whether Mundkur believes this cult to have been brought from outside, from the Old World, or to have originated independently in America. His hypothesis that the main features of the snake cult were brought through the subarctic regions by the Palaeo- lithic mammoth-hunters does not seem to me well enough substantiated. It is well known that a wide variety of forms of the snake cult emerged absolutely independently among various peoples at various historical stages, but it is in the tropics and subtropics, where certain especially venomous and dangerous kinds of snakes are abundant, that the cult exists in its most elaborate forms. Contrary to the author's opinion on the origin of the jaguar cult among the Indian tribes of Mexico and Central and South America, I believe that it came into being not only because the jaguar is the most dangerous and formidable beast of the jungle, but, above all, because of the direct association of the image of this beast with agriculture. Among the ancient Maya, the jaguar was the farmers' patron, protecting the fields of maize by driving other animals away. This is one of the most important reasons for the idolization of the jaguar in their mythology. by S. YA. SEROV Institute of Ethnography', Academy of Sciences of the U.S.S.R., Dm. Ulianov 19, Moscow 717036, U.S.S.R. 1 VI 76 Of all zoomorphic cults, the cult of the serpent, judging from some of its surviving archaic traits, is one of the oldest. It is 742 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="2">not in our power to reconstruct the phases of evolution of the cult, and this does not seem necessarv from the point of view of the author's analysis. Mundkur treats ophiolatry in the Old World in terms of countries. zones, and regions. It seems more reasonable, how- ever, to analyse the serpent cult in ethnic (tribe, ethnos, people) or cultural terms-which the author does when speak- ing of America. One cannot but agree with his criticism of "wide-scale" diffusionism. The very inseparability of a cult of a certain form from a specific culture might have served as a substan- tiated argument against the diffusionist theory, had the author made this point. It is regrettable, however, that Mundkur adduces no reasons that similar rituals might be considered to be of independent genesis. The existence of snakes in all geographical zones except the polar, their amphibian nature, and their way of life, fitting in especially well with the chthonic archetypes of man-these quite suffice, in my view, to account for the importance of serpent worship. Even the unilineal interpretation of Mundkur, who accepts without reservation Statius's "Primus in orbe Deos fecit timor," is built upon a more determinable base (the universal character of human fear) than speculative establishment of the routes of a cult's migration. Still more fruitful would be a demonstration of the polysemantic nature of the image of the serpent. I would advise that the psychological method be combined with the analysis, not only of the ritual, but of the social role of the cult in individual ethnic cultures. At different stages of social development, the serpent cult was not only replaced by the worship of other animal species, but also underwent changes in its characteristic features. Thus, the association of the serpent cult with even numbers, mentioned by the author, typifies the most archaic pattern. The Nahua associated twofoldness with the cosmic aspect of serpent worship (as, for instance, the peoples of Hindustan associate it with fertility); the serpent was also believed to be the spiritual double of man. Plant cults involved the number 7. From the methodological standpoint, it is necessary to identify levels of abstraction. In the tropics, where snakes are especially dangerous, the common reaction of awe, fear, and avoidance is associated with a certain kind of serpent. On a higher level of abstraction, it is not a definite kind of serpent that is worshipped, but the serpent as an image (paradoxically, a simple ritual may correspond, formally, to this level of abstraction among the peoples of geographical zones where the reptiles are not dangerous). The connection of the serpent with numerology and symbolism of colours and cardinal points thus becomes clearer; the associated anthropomorphic deity stands out more distinctly, too (e.g., the lokapala Virupaksa in the Buddhist pantheon or the adhipatis and their assistants the raksataras in the Atharva-Veda hymns). An example from the domain of ophiolatry may reveal a possible typological similarity, even on the plot level, between cultures which certainly never influenced one another. Accord- ing to Herodotus (4:8-10), the Pontic Greeks believed that the Scythian kings descended from the serpent-fighter Herakles (great-grandson of the serpent-fighter Perseus) and the serpent- legged maiden Echidna, who dwelt in a cave. Within the Hellenistic circle, such a legend could be compared with the myth in which Persephone bears a son, Dionysus Zagreus, by Zeus, who sneaked into her cave disguised as a serpent. The similarity of these two stories falls outside the scope of dif- fusionism, for they both belong to the same culture. On the other hand, the similarity between these stories and the Chibcha myth retold by Mundkur about culture heroes merging With: serpent deities has nothing to do with diffusionism either, for we can hardly speak of any contacts between the Chibcha and the Hellenes throughout history. The Quechua culture (and possibly Huanca) had a different version of the same myth. According to Poma de Ayala, the sorceress Mama Waco (an Earth Mother prototype), who lived in the cave Tamputoco, gave birth to the first Supreme Inca Manco Capac by the serpent-like deity Amaru. Later Manco Capac married Mama Waco, his own mother (or, according to another version, his sister); they founded a dynasty (like Herakles) and taught the aborigines the beginnings of culture (like Bachue and her son). All these versions have so many features in common that we would be justified in believing them to belong to the same tvpe of myth. These features are (1) the chthonic nature of one or both partners; (2) the serpent element as an essential; (3) the fact that the characters are creators of the world (in the form of culture heroes, divinities, or both-the question of the delimitation between culture hero and divinity is still to be resolved); and (4) the intergenerational incest (except for the story of Herakles, where the incest is covert, perhaps being replaced by the presence of serpentine as well as human nature in both Herakles and Echidna). The almost complete identity of plot observed in regions which have never been in contact supports the possibility of a nondiffusionistic explanation of the appearance of cultural forms. Now for the last point: The author rightly singles out the question of polymorphism as an attempt to express in material form the idea of either the merging or the unity of deities (totems). Here one should distinguish between two related processes which I would suggest calling "chimaerism," the merging of a number of equal deities, and "proteism," the transition from one image of a deity to another, including anthropomorphic ones, while retaining the principal charac- teristic (function). Reply by BALAJI MUNDKUR Biological Sciences Group, University of Connecticut, Storrs, Conn. 06268, U.S.A. 12 vii 76 Gulyaev's assertion that I have come to no definite conclusion as to the origins of serpent cults in the Americas is rather odd, since none of the other commentators on my article expressed any difficulty in understanding my position. In arguing against South Asian origins, I believe I quite clearly stated my view that serpent cults seem to have been imported via Beringia by the earliest waves of immigrants to the New World. Indeed, I fortified this with several examples drawn from the archaeology and ethnology of northern Asia, particularly Siberia. Gulyaev has overlooked three places in my article where I have been explicit on this point: the penultimate paragraph in the section "Blood Groups and the Migration of Cults," the first para- graph in the section "Northeastern Asian Survivals," and the last sentence of my summary. It is conceivable that a wide variety of forms of the serpent cult differentiated "absolutely independently," as Gulyaev puts it. among various peoples at various historical stages. I cannot quarrel with this self-evident statement, because serpent cults have existed worldwide among completely unrelated peoples from time immemorial. The thrust of my article, however, was that fundamental ophidian attitudes were imported into the Americas in the very earliest epochs of human migrations from northeastern Asia. I have said enough about the jaguar cult, both in my article and my earlier reply, to make further elaboration unnecessary. However, Gulyaev's rather romantic views of the jaguar as "the farmers' patron, protecting the fields of maize by driving other animals away" and as "the most dangerous and formida- ble beast of the jungle" are zoologically absurd. Caras (1975: 24-26), among many other naturalists, succinctly underlines the jaguar's very retiring habits, the unjustified, exaggerated reputation bestowed upon it as a marauder and killer, and the extreme rarity of its interference M ith the lives of jungle- Vol. 17 N No. 4 * December 1976</page><page sequence="3">dwelling communities. Caras (p. 25) states that "many people who have spent their lifetimes within the range of this powerful predator have never seen one." This can hardly be said of venomous reptiles, as the mortality statistics of Mexico and Central and South America amply prove (Swaroop and Grab 1954). Serov raises some interesting points, but they are irrelevant to the main theme and immediate goals of my article. I find his mention of psychological criteria, considered at various levels of abstraction, very agreeable, particularly in dealing with the ophiolatrous attitudes of peoples in geographical regions where the threat posed bv venomous reptiles is rare or nonexistent. The psychology of fear, serpent phobia, various expressions of serpent veneration, the innate qualities of serpents which incite these attitudes, and the general question of animals which are "bons a penser" fall in a special category. I have discussed these aspects at length in an article expected to be published elsewhere. References Cited CARAS, ROGER A. 1975. Dangerous to man. New York: Holt, Rine- hart and Winston.
