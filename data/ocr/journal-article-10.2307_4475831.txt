<plain_text><page sequence="1">DEMAS AND AUDE: THE NATURE OF DIVINE TRANSFORMATION IN HOMER To shape the course of events, to manipulate the human actors in the Epic, or to give them advice, Homeric gods (with the exception of Zeus) generally assume the mask of a mortal character. The identity of the divinity hidden under the persona is known to the poet and revealed to the audience. In his masked appearance on the stage of action, the god is introduced by 0oLXC;, taoc&amp;.voq, or some such expression. But more complete and explicit is the formula, which occurs five times in the Odyssey and provides its closing line, describing Athena in her role as Mentor: Me&amp;rTop&amp; e too,evj 7,Uev ai,Uoc; a Divine disguise proper seems to consist of two elements: demas and, more surprisingly, aude. Occuring in the accusative of reference, demas and aude' indicate in what respect gods transform themselves into mortal guise. Hence this formula reveals wherein gods differ from men: both in demas and aude'. Both words have been studied separately, but the significance of the collo- cation and its relevance to the Homeric gods has not received attention. An examination of these two terms clarifies their meanings and thereby reveals something of the nature of divine transformation in the Homeric poems. Etymologically connected with 84to), to build or construct, demas in the Iliad and Odyssey is largely restricted to human build or bodily frame2. SNELL has observed that, in the vocabulary of the Epic, demas comes closest to desig- nating the human body as a whole, being equivalent to a 5p?o in later Greek3. Frequently, demas appears doubled with one of its near synonyms, d8os I Od. 2, 268; 2, 401; 22, 206; 24, 503; 24, 548. This formula never occurs in the Iliad; the nearest approximation there is 8SLacx xaot &amp;M0LPc p9wvb: 13, 45; I7, 555; 22, 227. See the discussion of audi and phond below. 2 Exceptions: the so-called adverbial use of demas, only in the Iliad in the formula 8itoc nrup6q: II, 596; 13, 673; I7, 366; i8, i. Demas is used of non-humans only in Od. I7, 307 (Argos) and 10, 240 (Odysseus' men turned into pigs). 3 B. SNELL, Die Entdeckung des Geistes, Hamburg 1946, i9. Cf. [Plutarch] De vita et poesi Homeri 2, I24, who equates the living body with demas, the corpse with soma; see also Eustathius 666, 24. For sodma, compare P.

All three terms describe the appearance of a man and are often con- trasted with cpprvg, voi3g, pyx, or other words for character or state of mind - again emphasizing their strict limitation to external and visible human form 6. So far, no obvious distinctions present themselves between these three terms, yet, strikingly, in the context of divine disguise, demas alone occurs- never eidos or phue". The peculiar relation of demas to divine metamorphosis compels us to distinguish its meaning from eidos and phue more precisely. TREU tries to elucidate the differences by translating demas as Bau, phuAe as das Gewachsensein, and eidos as der visuelle Anblick. KRAFFT offers Wuchs for phue' and Aussehen for eidos 7. Clearly, eidos, while generally restricted to men, does not mean human body but merely visible appearance. Far more specific, demas underlines the distinctly human form of the disguised divinities. Also, as TREU points out, eidos is subjective, requiring the presence of an onlooker, while demas may be called objective 8. Possibly, too, Homer does not use eidos because it might suggest that divine transformations are mere illusions. The absence of Phue, 'physique', from passages describing the gods' dis- guises is readily understandable because of its inescapable implication of organic growth or development, which would be inappropriate to the context of a momentarily assumed disguise. So too, phue does not occur in those de- scriptions of men suddenly transformed by the gods, while demas and eidos often do 9. Demas, in contrast to phue, is static and tectonic. The choice, then, of demas over eidos and phue must point to the objective reality of the gods' disguises and to a fundamental difference between divinities who appear as mortals and mortals themselves: the absence of natural growth. The second member of the formula describing divine metamorphosis, aude, is clearly related to ocaAkw one of the commonest Epic words for speaking, or saying. Given the many Greek words for 'voice', the exact nuance of aude tends to be rather elusive. While modem philologists have devoted much attention to the Epic vocabulary relating to visual impressions, they seem to have somewhat neglected words involving the production of sounds, although, 4 Demas with phue: IL.

PORZIG lists some of these words (6roc, yp,oyy-, oca , 06Xao, 0,pT) but does not attempt to distinguish their meanings. BARTONEK'S study of pcwv' and ocu'n proceeds from the assumption that no significant semantic difference between them exists in Homer and that they may be considered synonyms. KRAFFT tries to differ- entiate phone = Wahl der Worte and aude = Klang der Worte, but his own examples vitiate his definitions. The brief discussion by FOURNIER of Homeric words for voice which are related to verbs of saying succinctly conveys the character of each term 1O. The whole question has finally been given the at- tention it deserves by H. J. KRAPP, Die akustischen Phanomene in der Ilias (Diss. Mtinchen I964). KRAPP defines phone as 'voice in general' (p. 23) while aude' w&gt;scheint ilber die Bedeutung 'Stimme' hinaus vor allem die menschliche Stimme und Sprache zu charakterisieren&lt;&lt; (p. 24). KRAPP'S conclusions are anticipated by much of what the Scholia and Eustathius have to say on the subject. Their source in turn seems to have been Chrysippus' differentiation of phone, dialektos, and aude, which is manifestly an interpretation of Homeric usage. Galen reports the distinction in these terms "': ... .UUOnV ai OUtS 7nV TO 7Y,4 OXOYq `ALOV OLCT,rOV OL ... oc 0P x oc~ c t6 x?x. xv to JIOV-qV ae Q LxVA~p@OVLO Y(AvqV, xat 'nV &amp;OCXSY4L?5 76Cpoq g tIv vu 7 pov'vo, xcxto ' i'v wLy'. The ancients called aude not everything properly perceived through hearing nor that alone, which is emitted through the mouth - which includes weeping, whistling, wailing, and bleating - but they designated aude only the human voice with which we converse with one another. Aude does not merely denote the vocal production of sounds, but the production of intelligible human speech. How, then, can this word be applied to beings other than human as often occurs in the Epic? Chrysippus continues with two illustrative examples from Homer: 10 W.

So, too, the poet, when he depicts Achilles conversing with his horses, he says that one of the horses spoke, adopting human speech. For he says: )dthe white-armed goddess Hera made him cx8-rev-rx - not because he had no voice before, or because he did not possess the voice common to horses, but because that is not called aude'. So, also, he called a goddess au8&amp;?6a0c when she adopted human speech, because they also say that she is anthropomor- phic - which is not the case with all the gods. When Hera makes Xanthos ocu'&amp;8vto, she does not give him the ability to whinny and neigh; this he has always possessed. Rather, she grants him the power of human speech'2. A moment later, the Erinyes put an end to this ability: WG apoa TV7aMV'0qO 'EpLvU?e eX'aeov ocU8-v (Il. I9, 4I8). Similarly, a divinity may be called aU84eaaoc when using human speech. Several further illustrations of the character of aude can be discovered in the Odyssey. When Odysseus awakens on Scheria, he notices the sounds of Nausicaa and her maids playing ball and wonders: do these sounds come from nymphs or men of mortal speech, vC4p4n7rWV . . . o U16vmv (6, I25).

The Scholia at Od. 5, 334 reveal that the Homeric editor, Aristotle, was sufficiently troubled by this collocation that he felt obliged to emend it away with cawa'X 6. Aristophanes, on the other hand, seems to have been on the right track in connecting the anthropomorphism of Circe and Calypso with their peculiar epithet: o ,urv 'ApLato?C&amp;VJ 'r&amp;5 &amp;vbp oeC8erv c av8jnaa0oC Y1atv otovl ycdvnv tL)'cpU LM4. (Scholia HPQ ad 5, 334)17 While the major divinities adopt both ))voice and appearancea, demas and aude, when taking part in human affairs, these goddesses of lower rank retain their true forms without recourse to bodily disguises18. Their speech, however, is specially modulated in some way; they use the peculiar voice of men, which the poet indicates by aude. The character of this modulation may be suggested by the six words from the language of the gods Homer mentions in the course of the poems19. At the very least, the existence of divine words shows that Homer was both aware and interested in the distinction between divine and human speech. Our study of aude has proceeded from Chrysippus' definition; we may now conclude that in all cases in Homer where atde is used absolutely and without is Cf.

Yet certain apparent exceptions exist, but these, on closer examination, prove the rule and strengthen the case for this interpretation of aude20. Three times singers and a herald are called 6oZq (&amp;?r) vYXtyxtOq ou'&amp;syV (I1. I9, 250; Od. I, 37I; 9, 4). This does not suggest that they possess divine speech, but rather that their voices are of super-human excellence or power 2. In the Odyssey, after receiving advice from Mentor, Telemachus realizes that he has been conversing with a god. The phrase, ?0oU5 '?XdUZV O$&amp;8TV (2, 297) is precisely accurate and suited to the situation; it means not divine voice but Athe human voice of the god&lt;(. The same expression occurs under similar circumstances when Apollo rouses the wounded Hector in I1. I5, 27022. In two remaining passages, both from the Odyssey, the qualification of aude by 4o5 or 4eoZo gives a special sense. Penelope appeals to the eidolon of Iphthime to reveal the fate of Odysseus: ?1 X? 8 t?0, iamt, Deozo re ex? e ?X cUaJ8 (Od. 4, 83I) In Book I4 Eumaius puts forth two possible explanations for the Suitors' outrageous conduct: e a, 'TOL ta?aL, Q0U a rLV eX?OtOV OM' XeUVOt XuypOV O??pOV (Od. I4, 89-go) Here no specific divinities are involved or implied; furthermore, both expressions contain a certain vagueness: rLv' . . . oaiJ&amp;8v, and the genitive of aude with `xXueq which, according to CHANTRAINE, designates )&gt;la voix . . qui n'est perc,ue que partiellement23&lt; . Ozo05 OC&amp;a in both cases refers to some sort of second-hand knowledge whose source is divine and might be rendered 20 J. H. H. SCHMIDT, Synonymik der griechischen Sprache, Leipzig I876, I 43-47, attacks the ancient view of aude in some detail, although his own account is somewhat incoherent. His definition, )&gt;die menschliche Sprache von ihrer wohltonenden Seite aus betrachtet (, seems quite unobjectionable until one realizes that it is in fact two definitions. Thus, SCHMIDT regards aude as equivalent to cpcov' PpoTr and agrees that aude in II. I9, 418 means human speech, but he also detects a comparison there with *dem klanglosen Wiehern((. But in the case of Circe, Calypso, and Ino, denying any reference to human speech, SCHMIDT translates OCaacG as 'gesangreich'. Finally, most unconvincingly, at Od. 6, I25, he remarks that the voice of civilized (?) men would appear to Odysseus as #der lieblichste Wohlklang(( after his near drowning. 21 Cf. Od. 4, I6o. Once aude is used in a figurative sense to describe the sound of Odys- seus' bowstring (Od. 2I, 41I). 22 W. KULLMANN, Das Wirken der Gotter in der Ilias, Berlin 1956, 101-102, includes Apollo's intervention in his list of undisguised epiphanies. But KRAPP, 138, more cor- rectly includes this incident among the examples of the recognition of a divine voice in a disguised divinity. Granted that there is no explicit mention of Apollo's disguise; still it is implied by Hector's question: rEq 8' adu &amp;aL 9cpptat1 k&amp;V (I5, 247). 23 Grammaire Homerique, Paris I963, II 54.</page><page sequence="7">Demas and Aude: The Nature of Divine Transformation in Homer 135 by oracle or perhaps rumor of divine origin. Only here in the Homeric poems by a kind of extension or analogy does aude mean something other than human speech and require the qualifying 8 c o v-. The most telling proof, finally, is the fact that ocvApcnrou avy never occurs, while in the expressions PpoT'Oq auR8saaa and d6v,9p6nrcov ocvoU8vrwv a contrast between men and gods is always apparent. If this interpretation of aude' reveals a distinction which is genuinely Homeric, one might conjecture the existence of an Epic word which properly denotes 'divine voice'. SEVERYNS' candidate24, 0-OC (found only in the oblique cases), has a certain attraction since more than half its ocurrences have clear reference to divinities. But a more careful scrutiny suggests that opa refers to vocal quality or timbre, especially a clear or shrill tone. Thus the Muses have opa as do Circe and Calypso when they sing, Odysseus as he delivers a speech, or Hecuba when she cries out at the sight of Hector slain 25. The gods, too, appear to possess opa, and on several occasions, it seems possible that this vocal quality permits a mortal to recognize a divine presence 26. There are in fact two Homeric words for divine voice: 6caoc and 69xpl. In later Greek, omph e comes to mean oracle and approaches that sense in its two appearances in the Odyssey (3, 2I5 = i6, 96) 27. But its basic meaning becomes manifest from its use in the Iliad. In Book two as Agamemnon awakens from the Dread Dream sent by Zeus, the divine voice still lingers about him: Dt U ,t&amp;v (4texu'Z' 9,u7p (I1. 2, 41). Later, as Hera catches sight of Aeneas charging Achilles with Apollo's help, she wants to reassure Achilles of the gods' continued support through some audible sign: tvoc e18n 6 .lpLV cpLXeouaLV &amp;pLTOL / &amp;alvkrcov (20, I22-I23).

Often translated as 'rumor' or even 'divine rumor', 6'aam has a more limited application than omphe' as I1. 2, 93-94 reveals where ossa appears personified as the messenger of Zeus, who rouses the Greek armies to come to the agora: erT acp Ca&amp;V "Oaao 8W,et / 'rpU'Voua' t6cVOL, A5 &amp;?yyeXo. Elsewhere, too, ossa is described as a messenger (Od. 24, 4I3) and as emanating from Zeus (Od. I, 282; 2, 2I6). The special connection of ossa with Zeus reminds us that 24 A.

FOURNIER, 232, suggests )svoix delicate, charmante, douce, dmouvante( as a definition of opa. 26 For examples of the recognition of the divine voice in disguised divinities, see II. 2, I82; IO, 5I2; 20, 380; Od. 24, 535. On the special quality of divine voices, see KRAPP, 136ff. Cf. I1. II, 10; 5, 439; i6, 706; I5, 321; i8, 2I7ff.; Od. 24, 47ff.; 24, 530. 27 Cf.

Hence his need of messengers, Iris and Hermes, or upon occasion, the divine mes- senger-voice, ossa. The Shield of Achilles shows the gods to be both larger and more beautiful than men. Hence the assumption of a human form requires a diminution of their stature. But a complete metamorphosis also demands a concomitant change in voice or manner of speaking. The Homeric gods, then, differ from men not only in immortality and stature. A less obvious but equally important difference is the fact that the gods speak differently than men, and thus to appear as men and to speak like them, the gods must change both in demas and audi.
