<plain_text><page sequence="1">LEARNED AND GENERAL MUSICAL TASTE IN EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY FRANCE* THE HISTORY OF CONNOISSEURS IS THE HISTORY OF HOW SOCIETIES have valued learning in letters and the arts. The connoisseur, holding unusual knowledge in some area of culture, might have been a writer, a scholar, a patron, an amateur, or simply someone respected for artistic judgement. Members of the upper social orders have long had a sense, a disposition as ingrained as their table manners, about what connois- seurs or people in general understood about the arts, and how import- ant learning might seem. Let us call "general" taste the assumption that certain books, paintings, or works of music did not require special knowledge to be understood; "learned" is accordingly the opposite. Historians need not flinch at talking about the general public since, even though its size and composition may be only roughly determin- able, societies have made abundantly clear what was regarded either as esoteric or accessible. On the one hand the plays of Shakespeare were considered part of general taste in their time, as were the symphonies of Haydn and the operas of Handel. On the other hand works based on ancient models (for example, the poems of Milton) or actually intended for study (such as the fugues of J. S. Bach) were thought to be ap- proachable only through a learned taste. Although some writings of great antiquity were very widely known, age tended to demand learn- ing. One effect of this, of course, was that the passage of time often changed the status of a work from "general" to "learned". Power was present in both manners of taste. Knowledge is power; popularity is power. The balance struck between them, a complex, often contradictory, social and intellectual system, has been one of the most fundamental aspects of any culture. These assumptions, by governing what has gone on in the life of the arts, have contributed much to the sensibility of each society, helping define the idiosyncratic ways by which people have shaped their tastes and gone about their cultural business. Learning has thus had its own social distinctions, separate from those of social classes. Perspectives of a mass society have obscured this question. Because the term "popular culture" has often been used am- biguously - both to mean lower-class culture and popularity in vari- * This paper was written with the support of the National Endowment for the Humanities, during a Fellowship in Residence at the University of Virginia, and completed with aid from my university.

Few eighteenth-century gentlemen or gentlewomen were learned in all the arts; in trusting themselves in areas of relative ignorance, they subscribed to the broad- est cultural proclivities of their peers. Undeniably wealth and social position were necessary to get the cultural exposure essential to general taste, or the knowledge needed for learned taste, and patronage re- quired particularly great economic resources. But the distinction be- tween the two kinds of taste, as between connoisseurs and the public, has been quite independent of bourgeois, aristocratic, or any other class identities.1 It meant something very different to be a connoisseur of music rather than of letters or painting in eighteenth-century France. Musi- cal aficionados did not have as powerful a learned or "high" tradition as did their colleagues in the other arts. The reasons why this was so sprang from assumptions that were taken for granted, rarely ex- pressed, and probably often not understood. The problem was Euro- pean in scope, of course, and we will therefore examine it first from that perspective before looking at its character in France.2 We will look 1 Methodological models for this study include Robert Darnton, "The High En- lightenment and the Low-Life of Literature in Pre-Revolutionary France", Past and Present, no. 51 (May 197 I), pp. 81- I 5; Robert Darnton, "Reading, Writing and Pub- lishing in Eighteenth-Century France: A Case Study in the Sociology of Literature", in Felix Gilbert and Stephen R.

In 1770 John Hawkins, England's first claim to a music his- torian, complained that: Nothing in music is estimable that is not new. No music tolerable, which has been heard before. In answer to which it may be said, that this kind of reasoning is never applied to other intellectual gratifications; for no man was ever yet so weak as to object to the works of Virgil or Raphael, that the one wrote seventeen hundred, or that the other painted 250 years ago.3 A Parisian magazine correspondent made the same point three years later, asking: "Why is music more subject than the other arts to the power of mode, and why are the prejudices regarding music and paint- ing so different that people always prefer the oldest painting but the newest music?".4 Why indeed, we must ask, in our era of rigidly his- toricist music-making? The answer to their queries, put in its simplest terms, was that by tradition music had been seen as the most vulgar of the arts - in both the temporal and the moral sense of the word. Music could not be learned because ultimately it had no history. It had no history because, save for a few small fragments, no body of musical scores had come down from ancient Greece or Rome, and scholars did not uncover new ones in the eighteenth century as they did ancient paintings. Since the Renaissance, theorists had tried to reconstruct the music of the an- cients, but that remained a matter of academic guesswork, leaving un- resolved even so basic a question as whether or not the music had more than one line.5 Lacking a corpus of classical works, musical life had no historical chain of works done in imitatio; lacking a Virgil, music could have no Petrarch, and no composers revered down through the ages as were Dante and Michelangelo. It was not conventional to honour the music of the past, but to spurn it.6 Music therefore remained marginal to higher learning.

Though music had been part of the medieval quadrivium, it was there studied only as a narrow scientific subject, mathematical theories of acoustics, and not music itself. Such study lost ground during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries; the ratio studiorum of the Uni- versity of Paris relegated music to a few minor chapters, and the evolu- tion of scientific theory made ideas about the harmonies of the spheres increasingly out of date.7 Discussion of these matters passed instead into the field of aesthetics, where they provided a handy substitute for ancient music, a way of relating music to the classical tradition. Es- sayists on music with any pretensions to learning devoted themselves to ancient or medieval theories; their history of music concerned the philosophical and scientific traditions but rarely any discussion of com- posers, styles, or music itself.8 Of course, classical nomenclature pervaded musical life. Most opera librettos derived from the general knowledge of Greek or Roman his- tory or mythology; many halls, societies or occasions had ancient titles; and aspects of musical composition were sometimes seen in terms of Ciceronian rhetoric.9 One could do little else in that neo-classical age. But the core of the classical tradition, indeed its greatest strength, lay in textual analysis and critical commentary, in the scrutiny of present practice with great works from antiquity; without that, classical allu- sion could be little more than learned name-dropping. Music, lacking a textual corpus from antiquity, only had a second-hand classical tradi- tion. For that reason music could enter higher learning only upon the sufferance of other fields; it was the least of the liberal arts. Musical taste accordingly remained fixed upon the present. The musical world for which G. F. Handel and Jean-Philippe Rameau wrote was a culture of the "now", where stylistic traditions persisted, implicit and unexamined, in the changing present. During the seven- teenth and eighteenth centuries the great majority of works performed in concert halls and opera-houses, though somewhat less in cathedrals, were by living composers. When music by an eighteenth-century com- poser survived his or her death - as did operas by Jean-Baptiste Lully 7 Marie Naudin, Evolution parallele de la poesie et de la musique en France (Paris, 1968), pp. 126-48. 8 The leading "history" written at that time - Bonnet's Histoire de la musique et de ses effets -gives only the most cursory and unsympathetic treatment to music before the time of Jean-Baptiste Lully: Bonnet, op. cit., i, pp. 3, 208-1 2, 224-35. 9 Some musicologists see powerful influence from the rhetorical tradition upon mu- sical composition. See Gregory G. Butler, "Fugue and Rhetoric", Jl. Music Theory, xxi (1977), pp. 49-1 I; Warren Kirkendale, "Ciceronians versus Aristotelians on the Ricercar as Exordium, from Bembo to Bach", Jl. Amer. Musicological Soc., xxxii (1979), pp. 1-44. But other musicologists argue that classical influence was limited to esoteric or academic forms, that it did not figure significantly in the compositional pro- cess, or that it was weak in music of the eighteenth century.</page><page sequence="5">and other Frenchmen to an exceptional extent - it was extensively re- written and acted as a fixture of an institution rather than as a model elevated above criticism and studied in the schools.10 Music did not hold power in higher learning, moreover, because it wielded extraordinary power in everyday life. Music loomed large in the rites and pleasures of the court, the tavern and the home; people danced, drank and courted to it, and in the late seventeenth century operas and concerts simply put these functions on a grander scale. Music seemed too earthy to be a learned art. As Hawkins remarked, his history of music was intended "to reprobate the vulgar notion that its [music's] ultimate end is merely to excite mirth".11 Even if plays also had a bawdy tradition, they offered much less spectacle - especially less dance - than opera and did not play as large a role in the home as instrumental music. Because music was a general social pleasure for the upper orders, authority over its tastes was ruled by the precept of privilege which was essential to the ancien regime.12 The beau monde was beholden to none in its musical tastes; no authority stood higher. That did not simply mean that lesser professionals such as musicians or journalists could not tell people what to listen to; more importantly it meant that connoisseurs in these rarified social milieux could not presume upon their learning and dictate tastes. If such conceit was possible in the more learned arts and letters, where learned authority was specified and institutionalized, in the world of concerts and the opera it ran up against the assumption that entertainment did not acknowledge a higher intellectual authority. Music was too essential to the daily lives of the upper classes for that to happen. An anthropomorphic idea of the public - the idea of a unitary, self-governing audience - grew 10 The daily repertoire of the Paris opera has been largely reconstructed in the "Journal des entrees journalieres a l'Academie Royale de Musique" in the Biblio- theque de l'Opera; the programmes of the Concert Spirituel are reconstituted in Con- stant Pierre, Histoire du Concert Spirituel (Paris, I975). During the middle third of the eighteenth century over half of the daily performances at the opera in some seasons were of works by dead composers, but this antique repertoire was swept away after Louis XVI ascended the throne in 1774.

Still, music had its own kind of learning. Since the middle ages sacred music had amounted to an esoteric tradition: written in stricter and more conservative styles than secular music, it acted in a peda- gogical as well as a liturgical role. During the seventeenth century the pure sacred-music style of Giovanni Palestrina was codified as the reference point for academic polyphonic writing and was called the stile antico, even though the old music itself was rarely sung. Here alone did music possess a learned and historical tradition.13 As such the tradition of polyphonic music remained apart from general taste, for during the eighteenth century it did not follow closely in the evolution of music styles and was generally thought accessible - some even said attractive - only to those with advanced musical training. The in- creasingly secular, indeed operatic, style of much religious music iso- lated this tradition even further. While fugal writing continued as the hallmark of the learned composer (that of J. S. Bach being regarded as the most skilful of its kind) it did not have many amateur practitioners and related little if at all to classical study of musical theory and aesthetics. As an English gentleman said sadly of sacred polyphony in 1757: "It requires a very peculiar genius to make any considerable pro- gress in all the branches of that most elevated and exalted science".14 What, then, was the connoisseur to do? Amateurs in the art world had no such limits upon their authority; they could command all the learning in their field and extended the tools of historical attribution begun by Giorgio Vasari in the sixteenth century. Men of letters faced no distinction between amateur and professional and held sway over European culture as the main guardians of the classical tradition. But connoisseurs in music could claim only a contemporary authority, which was by definition intellectually weak, and had to make do with a trumped-up classical tradition. Bound to the present, they had to re- spect the judgement of general taste. Nevertheless connoisseurs did exercise a learned authority of their own, since musical life was too powerful in everyday life for its aficio- nados not to wield some influence. As the amateurs with the greatest exposure to musical events, they interacted with the public in the changing of its tastes; as the earliest kinds of agents, impresarios and music critics, they stood as respected, though never incontrovertible, judges of music and performance. People did seem to listen to what they said. We could sum up the mentality of the age regarding musical 13 Warren Kirkendale, Fuge und Fugato in der Kammermusik des Rokoko unter der Klassiker (Tutzing, 1966); Immogene Horsely, Fugue: History and Practice (New York, 1966); Christoph Wolff, Der stile antico in der Musik Johann Sebastien Bachs (Wiesbaden, 1968). 14 Gentleman's Mag., xxvii (1757), p. 544. 63</page><page sequence="7">learning in a maxim: one did not have to know anything special to understand music, but it was nice if one did. All of which was to change after the end of the eighteenth century. With the rise of a "classical" repertoire from the i8 ios on, chiefly the music of Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven, came an epochal change in the history of musical life, a fundamental transformation in the as- sumptions of taste which has as yet been little studied. Hawkins was a prophet. By the middle of the nineteenth century the symphonic repertoire was seen as the most serious of artistic forms, poets looked to music for aesthetic models, and connoisseurs had emerged as lay priests of the new musical deities.1 In studying connoisseurs we are studying the prehistory of this change. We will first examine how the word connaisseur was used and what that meant as regards values for musical taste. How much did the public respect such a person? We will then look into the ways by which connoisseurs related to the customs and traditions in musical life. Did they stand apart from general taste as a "high" tradition? Finally we will discuss differences between the major types of connoisseurs - the aesthetician, the general writer and the patron. What kinds of knowledge and authority did they claim, and how did each one relate to general taste? The word connaisseur had a special meaning in the musical life of eighteenth-century France. Today we speak of the connoisseur in the singular as a complimentary title for individuals who are known to excel in a particular field; the word carries an unquestioned authority and has consistently positive implications. In eighteenth-century musi- cal commentary, however, it was almost always used in the plural, de- signating those knowledgeable about music as a group. Though in many contexts it attributed authority to them, in others it carried pe- jorative connotations and left the validity of their authority in doubt. The word acted as a verbal weapon, either positively or negatively, as a source of authority or as a slur; through it a great deal of game-playing went on in the press and, one presumes, in the parlours of Paris. For general usage, of course, the dictionary of the Academie Francaise de- fined the word as "someone who is knowledgeable about something" and included examples about individuals ("He is a good connoisseur of horses").16 But while the singular may have been heard in conversa- tion, the word's frequently negative overtones in musical matters must have limited such usage. Whether positive or negative, perception of the connoisseur was dif- ferent from that of both the scholar and the musician. As the fields 15 William Weber, "Mass Culture and the Reshaping of European Musical Taste, 1770-1870", Internat. Rev.

Nor could a con- noisseur be confused with a professional musician: many players at the court had limited verbal literacy, and even well-known composers had only a smattering of classical education.17 As one amateur put it: "when we learn to sing or play an instrument, our masters fail to teach us general principles, but rather charge us with petty observa- tions, with confused or obscure rules".'8 Nevertheless in musical life the word savant (learned man) was used in a special sense: as a noun to mean a musician with advanced technical training or as an adjective to say that a piece was either carefully written or dull. Such use of the word occurred in a comment made early in the century that "our skilled masters have found the secret of how knowledgeably (savam- ment) to unite the natural taste of the French with the brilliant and learned (savant) style of the Italians in cantatas".19 Thus connoisseurs stood between the public and the musical profession, providing the one with assistance in understanding the knowledge of the other. Never- theless the taste of connoisseurs was also sometimes considered savant, since some had technical musical training. We can see the positive side of their authority best in references to les connaisseurs in the Mercure de France, the monthly journal which was in effect Paris's main newspaper and had the most regular and exten- sive musical commentary of any periodical. Strictly speaking, one can- not call this writing music criticism, since in many cases the anony- mous column on spectacles, a report on recent events at theatres and concerts, did not openly evaluate the music or the performance. In- stead writers often spoke of the impressions supposedly expressed by lepublic and by les connaisseurs. In a report on an Italian aria in 175 one hears that "this aria was greatly appreciated by connoisseurs, and seemed to make a very agreeable impression upon the public".20 In the same season a change in the acts to be represented from an opera-ballet (Rameau's Les Indes galantes) drew the comment that the hall's direc- tors had "suppressed an act from Le turc genereux which the public, and especially the connoisseurs, would have regretted very much, if they had not substituted the act from Les sauvages, whose reputation is so justly established".21 Writers often suggested the special musical 17 Benoit, Versailles et les musiciens du roi, p. 80. One work by a practising musician who did have a full classical education was the Abbe Sebastien de Brossard's Dictionnaire de la musique (Paris, 1701). 18 J. L.

A report on the performance of a well- known soprano mentioned that "the public was charmed, but the con- noisseurs were surprised how much of herself she put into the piece, which was charming in itself".22 On other occasions the judgements of the connoisseurs, but not of the public, were cited. A report of a new production of Lully's Proserpine in 1727 began critical discussion with the words: "here is what the connoisseurs think of the prologue".23 Allusion to les connaisseurs thus gave writers in the public press a feigned impersonality, a mask through which they could deliver opin- ion without being entirely responsible for it. The writer of the report on Proserpine reminded readers that: "Such are the various opinions we have heard about the opera; we are not so bold as to add any of our own. Our reports are only intended to inform the public of its own sentiments; our own views would not alone have much weight".24 Yet the word did not simply function as a literary mask, for it appeared in a wide variety of contexts where it implied authority. In I784, for ex- ample, a directive by the Academie Royale de Musique for considering new operas ordered trial performances "for the judgement of the ad- ministration and the connoisseurs".25 With the words savant, connaisseur and public, eighteenth-century Frenchmen defined a hierarchy of musical knowledge. The three groups were in a sense the orders of musical life, the social estates of people with different levels of expertise. It was in the nature of things that the orders had authority in inverse proportion to their musical training. In 1752 the writer in the Mercure de France reported that an instrumental work by Jean-Joseph Mondonville "was approved by the connoisseurs and charmed all ears, the skilled as much as the ignorant (tant les habiles que les ignorants)".26 Frenchmen accepted musical ignorance and knowledge alike; for members of the privileged classes, ignorance did not rule out musical bliss. Indeed the authority of musical knowledge was often questioned. The negative implications carried by the word connaisseur expose with particular clarity how the public had such primacy in musical taste.

An anonymous essay on the opera published in 1776 laid down the principle that: no judge other than the public should decide the merit of a piece designed to amuse and captivate it. This truth is indeed crucial, since failure has so often come to works thought excellent by pretended connoisseurs, men of taste, or theatre direc- tors, and brought down failure and humiliation upon these same authors, pretended men of letters, and connoisseurs.28 We shall see more such comments as we proceed. A writer early in the century has provided us with a particularly comprehensive discussion of les connaisseurs. Jean Laurent Lecerf de la Vieville ( 674-7 1 o) was a learned seigneur of Rouen. A member of the parlement of Normandy, he wrote treatises on Catullus and Alex- ander the Great and also the Comparaison de la musique italienne et de la musiquefrancaise ( 704-6), the principal work in support of the French style which opened the long controversy.29 In the sixth dia- logue of this work la comtesse is elaborating to le chevalier and Mile. le M. the origins of le bon gozut: The thing of greatest beauty is that which is admired equally by the public (le peuple) and by the learned or the connoisseurs. Accordingly I esteem first that which is admired by members of the public, and regard least of all that which is admired by the connoisseurs. But Mademoiselle likes precise definitions. The learned are masters of music, musicians by estate, trained by the rules. The public is the multi- tude, the greater number, who have not been raised to special knowledge and are guided in their judgements only by natural sentiment. Connoisseurs are those who are not entirely of the public nor of the learned, half the one, half the other, . . . owing as much to the rules as to natural sentiment.30 Lecerf was quick to make clear what he meant by le peuple: not the "shop-boys, porters, waitresses and cooks, who listen to songs by the Pont-Neuf and never go to the opera", but rather "honnetes gens, people of quality, a distinguished multitude, who frequent the thea- tres, but who do not carry there any knowledge of the rules".31 In his comments we see how privilege blurred the hierarchy of learn- ing within musical life. Master musicians and connoisseurs had an au- thority born of their special knowledge, but they served only to inform 27 Ibid., Apr. 1728, p. 809.

In philosophical terms, that principle rested upon the idea of le sentiment naturel - the starting-point of aesthetics in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries- and amounted to a univer- salistic conception of taste within the upper orders. Knowledge served to clarify, to elaborate, taste born of la nature; it did not bring inde- pendent, far less higher, understanding. How far this sensibility stands from our own! In the eyes of Lecerf general taste did not mean a lowest common denominator, as twentieth-century minds would be quick to phrase it, but rather the considered judgement of the privileged public aided by the learned in its midst. The controversy over Italian music illustrates how connoisseurs re- lated to the public, and indeed to each other. As the popularity of Italian music swept across Europe between the I66os and 1740s, the French court enforced a virtual blockade against operas written out- side the country and discouraged the- influx of Italian composers and performers. Because Frenchmen heard so little Italian music it was re- garded by many as la musique savante and thus as foreign to general taste. Abbe Francois Raguenet, who began the literary dispute in 1704 with a defence of Italian music, admitted that "the Italian recitative is a piece of composition hardly ever to be comprehended by strangers" and wondered at "how much art and knowledge is necessary for the composing, playing, and singing of it".32 The few people who heard much of it tended to be connoisseurs who flaunted their knowledge as a kind of radical chic, and the supporters of the French style accused them of holding an esoteric and unnatural taste. As one essayist com- mented early in the century, proponents of the Italian style were "a little sect of half-knowledgeable, though fairly prestigious, people of property who display their categorical opinions and proscribe French music dogmatically, as dull and tasteless, or entirely insipid".33 Lecerf likewise criticized the elaborate ornamentation of the Italian vocal style as comprehensible only to connoisseurs.34 By the middle of the eighteenth century enough Italian instru- mental and vocal music had appeared in the Concert Spirituel and private concerts that the Italian style gradually entered general taste.35 But conservative writers, themselves connoisseurs, still invoked the old accusations against it. In the famous querelle des bouffons, the dispute over Pergolesi's La serva padrona in 1752, the powerful litterateur 32 Francois Raguenet, A Comparison between the French and Italian Operas (London, 1709; repr.

The idea that they must serve the general public, though stated by Lecerf and others in aesthetic terms, had a firm social basis in the customs and traditions of musical life. As Henri Lagrave has shown in his study of Parisian theatre audiences between 1715 and 1750, the public at the four halls was small, regular in atten- dance, and shared a common body of artistic experience.38 That was particularly true at the opera-house, the Academie Royale de Musique, where on average only six new productions were mounted annually, performed three or four times a week, eleven months a year.39 The Concert Spirituel, held in the Tuileries on holy days when the theatres were shut, repeated much of the same repertoire, plus instrumental music which people heard in salons and sacred motets in churches. A sense of general taste with little differentiation by institutions or aes- thetic level thus grew from this unity of repertoire and composing styles. Monopolistic practices of the ancien regime limited the prolifer- ation or specialization of musical institutions, for authorities per- mitted few concerts to rival the Concert Spirituel. Only in the nine- teenth century did opera and concert halls expand and become dif- ferentiated by musical genres and levels of taste. That musical events had a loose social etiquette, by today's stan- dards at least, came in part from the general nature of their audience and their taste. At the opera people sometimes sang along with the music; at other times they had a hard time hearing it over the hulla- baloo of the petit-maitres, the well-born teenagers (often from court) whose main activity in the pit was trying to attract attention by waving their lorgnettes and shouting insults.40 It was, after all, their privilege. 36 Elie Freron, Lettres sur la musiquefranfaise (Geneva, I754), pp. 7-8. 37 [M.-F.-P. de Mairobert], Les prophities du grand prophete Monet (Paris, 1753), in Querelle des bouffons, ed.

If an occasional purist said that people went to concerts or the opera "only to be seen", connoisseurs did not seriously dissent from the social customs of their time.41 They certainly did not object to the sexual side of musical life. For many gentilshommes, learned or no, the opera functioned as an ele- gant house of prostitution - un bureau de plaisir, one writer called it with the young women in the musical and dance corps, lesfilles de l'opera.42 The Concert Spirituel stood on no higher an ethical plane; many men went there, one amateur reported, to meet singers "as re- nowned for their beauty as for their libertine inclinations", with whom "small, intimate dinners would succeed the spirituality of the concert".43 The best-known connoisseur of the mid-eighteenth cen- tury, Rameau's patron Alexandre-Jean-Joseph Le Riche de La Poup- liniere, was especially known for his exploits, and published stories which the Memoires secrets of Bachaumont called "a rhapsody worthy to serve the colporteur".44 Yet we should not think of eighteenth-century musical experience as inherently unserious or disorderly. Let us consider a spectrum of social relationships (not, of course, social classes) possible among members of a public, ranging from strictly individual to impersonal in a mass con- text.45 Our own musical life tends towards the extremes, since concert- hall etiquette and the record-player have defined listening more as an individual than a social experience, and concert management and the production of records are mass processes. That of eighteenth-century France lay somewhere in between. It had almost no mass social struc- ture; publishing was still small in scale and depended upon personal relationships for distribution. All musical events, from the opera hall to the court to the private salon, were based on an intricate web of per- sonal ties, for most people in the public dealt in some manner with per- formers and with each other. These exchanges controlled behaviour 41 See, for example, Anon., Lettres d'un amateur, pp. 56-7. 42 [Francois Mayeur de Saint Paul], Le vol plus haut ou l'espion des principaux thdetres de la capitale (Paris, 1 784), p. 42. Comments on these matters are endless. See F.-A.

If we look at the other end of the spectrum, the society had little sense of music as a strictly individual experience. That was to come in the nineteenth century, as Romantic beliefs and the tightening of social etiquette in public halls separated listeners from one another. Before that happened, the judgement of music or its performance was seen rather as a social process. Etiquette allowed talk, moving about, even card-playing and occasional fisticuffs, and while that may mean anarchy to us, to people of the time it comprised a controlled social interplay which was integral to musical experience. Lecerf suggested this sensibility in the words of la comtesse: To acquire good taste, we accustom ourselves to judging everything by listening to our natural sentiment and by confirming it with big and little rules ... At the opera we study with care the movements of spectators and let ourselves identify the judge- ments of the public and our own by the judgement of time.46 The connoisseur necessarily had an ambiguous authority in a social context of this kind. A claim to special knowledge could threaten the principle of natural sentiment; if pressed too hard it could threaten the principle of privilege and upset the intricate process of social exchange through which good taste was thought to emerge. For that reason Lecerf had a profound suspicion both of le savant and le connaisseur: their role was to inform the public, not dictate its preferences. "The person who knows how to praise in a reasonable and proportioned manner", he said, "will be a perfect connoisseur".47 Similar conceptions of connoisseur and public had a long vintage in the theatre. In a study of seventeenth-century French rhetoric Hugh M. Davidson has shown how writers saw the theatre world as com- posed of les doctes and a wider body of les mondains or les honnetes gens.48 The duty of the rhetorician was to bring the learned together with the larger public by putting elevated ideas in an accessible form. Davidson has depicted how the public wielded power over taste in French theatre, in much the same manner as we have seen in musical life. One can indeed find many of the same dynamics as well in Eliza- bethan and Restoration theatre: the primacy of the public was the sine qua non of cultural life in the early modern period. Yet these similarities had important limits. Since music had no true classical heritage, its hierarchy of knowledge was weakly defined, and its learned men had no institutional authority, no academy. If the Aca- demie Francaise devoted itself to codifying the French language and 46 Lecerf, Comparaison de la musique italienne, ii, p. 309.

It in no way resem- bled the academies in science, literature and the plastic arts, and not until 1791 did it acquire an educational arm. By the same token, musicians might sometimes entertain members of the Academie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres, but the society had no musical division, either professional or amateur.49 Musical life also had a much more weakly defined aesthetic hier- archy among artistic forms than the other fields. By the end of the seventeenth century there had emerged in literature and the fine arts, far more than in music, carefully defined schemes as to the aesthetic importance of different forms. The rankings seen among the epic, the sonnet and the epigram in poetry, or between the portrait, history and landscape paintings, had almost no parallel in instrumental music, many of whose forms varied enormously in practice.50 The distinction between tragedie lyrique and opera comique had something of a paral- lel with tragic and comic drama, but as James R. Anthony has argued, the librettos of tragedies lyriques were galant rather than heroic or tragic, and the divertissements of dance and spectacle were the focus of attention for much of the public.51 Institutional parallels aside, Lully was not thought a musical Racine. Moreover many connoisseurs took the imported opera buffa very seriously indeed from the start of the century, and after 1750 the local opera comique as well. The theatres which presented these works drew upon much the same public as the Acad6mie Royale de Musique; much of their repertoire was a ritual- ized satire of the spectacles pompeux in the other hall.52 One could even argue that the mass of the people stood outside the general taste of the upper orders less because the music seemed esoteric than because they did not share in the social graces of the elegant style galant. Even so, many opera airs were commonly sung along with popular songs at the Pont-Neuf, the main Parisian locale for itinerant ballad singers; Lecerf regarded that as one of the best proofs of good 49 [P.

How could a musician rival the lofty pro- gramme of the Academie Francaise? What could a librettist say to a professional opera-hater like Boileau? No French librettist tried to have his works read as poetry independent of the music, as Italian writers such as Apostolo Zeno did, publishing expanded texts with sec- tions not intended to be performed.5 If gens de lettres looked down on music, the opera most of all, that came in part from jealousy towards the importance of music in the lives of the upper classes. Voltaire, for example, grumbled that: the opera is a public rendezvous where we assemble on certain days without know- ing why. It is a place where everyone goes, although we speak ill of the composer and though he be boring. By contrast, a major effort is required to draw the multitude to the Comedie, and I almost always find that the greatest success of a fine tragedy does not approach that of a mediocre opera.56 French musical life also had a less learned academic tradition than elsewhere. During the reign of Louis XIV the stile antico all but disap- peared from the music of the court chapels; works based on the Baro- que basso continuo, called motets but related to the cantata, drama- tized Royal Gallicanism by their grandeur and modernity, so different from the antique counterpoint in the Vatican's Sistine Chapel. While music written to the old technique persisted at Notre Dame and other cathedrals, it did not foster as strong a tradition of fugal writing in an academic vein as was found among learned composers in other coun- tries.57 In London the Madrigal Society and the Academy of Ancient 53 Lecerf, op. cit., ii, pp. 300-I.

Even though these music-and-dining clubs were small, private and unrepresentative of any trends in learn- ed or general taste, they acted as an independent base for connoisseurs of the kind not found in France.58 Furthermore French connoisseurs do not seem to have been active collectors of old music manuscripts as their English counterparts were.59 French connoisseurs nevertheless exercised a greater authority in public life than their colleagues elsewhere, for the independence- perhaps the isolation- of the nation's musical life bred a special so- phistication of taste which flourished in the luxuriant intellectual climate of eighteenth-century Paris. As the only country outside Italy with strong indigenous opera genres, France had a tradition of critical comment- a connoisseurship of opinion - rivalled by none.60 That may have been possible in part because music was not viewed with as much moral suspicion in France as in England or Protestant Germany. Connoisseurs could take strong public leadership because they did not have to fear ethical attacks upon their interests.61 French connoisseurs, then, did not form part of a "high" musical tradition. As intermediaries between musicians and the general public, they were respected for their knowledge and their leadership in musi- cal life, but they did not stand apart from the public in their tastes. The customs of musical life had weak hierarchies, whether among musical forms or the social purposes of music, and limited the differentiation of participants and the authority of the knowledgeable amateur and the musician. Did musical life suffer thereby? Even if these values may seem alien to the elevated principles of modern classical-music life, we must remember that they gave musical affairs a contemporaneity, an earthiness and a lack of intellectual pretension, qualities which can compare attractively with the dogmatic historicism of musical life today. 58 On the Academy of Ancient Music, see J.

What kinds of knowledge and authority did they claim? There were three main types of connoisseurs in France during this time: the writer of learned aesthetics, the writer of general musical commentary, and the amateur and patron. Not many people had more than one kind of interest. While each of the three types had considerable range of social background, at least with- in the prosperous classes, the groups did differ somewhat in the propor- tions of people on various levels: patrons usually stood the highest, and general writers the lowest. Each type underwent significant change during the century. In the evolution of the three groups during this period we can see social tendencies which foreshadow the break- down of the unitary public after the turn of the nineteenth century. The roles which connoisseurs built up in Paris at this time made them principal agents of social forces - commercialism, professionalism and artistic idealism -which were later to splinter musical life into separate domains and reshape the whole texture of musical taste. The musical patron is a subject as yet little explored, and we can make only a few limited points here. The background of patrons emerges from a tabulation by Anne Chastel of all those persons to whom music was dedicated and who were mentioned in periodicals be- tween 774 and 1789 - a period far richer in printed commentary on music than pre-I77o.62 By no means would all of these people have been known as connoisseurs, but since they did more than simply take music lessons, most of the major connoisseurs of this type must have been among them. Among the 5 60 names, 6 per cent were women and 38 per cent men, with I per cent unidentifiable. Since women played so central a role in domestic music-making, many of them must have been regarded as connoisseurs. Aristocrats loomed large among patrons: 44 per cent of the persons had stated titles (including baron, chevalier, and royalty), 3I per cent had the prefix de in their names, and 25 per cent had neither.63 The large number of persons with major titles 207 were prince, marquis, duc, comte, vicomte, or the female equiva- lents suggests the severe economic requirements behind the pa- tron's role. But for that very reason there must have been other ama- teurs of lesser status who, though not able to afford the high cost of publication, remunerated musicians for works done in manuscript. The patron exerted, first and foremost, the economic authority of a mecene (protector), but that role grew out of musical activity and in- deed a presumed musical authority. Most patrons sang or played an in- 62 A. Chastel, "Etude sur la vie musicale a Paris a travers la presse pendant le regne de Louis XVI", Recherches sur la musique franaaise classique au XVIIIe siecle, xvii (1977), PP. 11 8-49. 63 Titles were only slightly more numerous among the persons who rented boxes (full or partial) at the Opera than among the patrons. In April 1768, for example, the 104 renters included 52 per cent persons with titles, 32 per cent persons with de in their names, and 15 per cent with neither. See "Loges louees a l'ann&amp;e": A.N., AJ13 14. 75</page><page sequence="19">strument, taught by their musical clients; works were often written with pedagogical purposes for specific people. A number of patrons themselves composed, even published, musical pieces, though they generally did that under the close supervision of a musician, and none developed composing careers.64 Patrons' renown came less from skill as performers or composers than from the wider activities they pursued in musical life, many of which were later to pass into professional hands. Concerts in homes, or simply performances at a salon, had particular importance in Paris be- cause the state monopoly of the Concert Spirituel - bestowed by the opera - limited the number of other public concerts. Patrons func- tioned as agents for their musicians' careers, currying favour for them in high places within the state musical system. A few became directors of the opera, investing their capital as entrepreneurs.65 Those whose musicians composed served as a distribution network, obtaining pay- ment for subscriptions for music either published or in manuscript.66 In 1757 an amateur, supposedly a major in the cavalry, the largely aristocratic mousquetaires noirs, described that system: Every house has its favourite musician; it is he who sets the tone of musical life, forcing his students to do his bidding and filling their music-stands with his pieces. The master of the house occupies himself in vaunting the musician's works and in pressing copies upon those complacent enough to buy them.67 He suggested how learned amateurs like himself wielded influence in public concerts and might see their musical interests as purer than those of the general public: concerts are attended by a large number of idle people and only a small number of connoisseurs; women are the ornaments of the occasion and a source of emulation for the performers. Only a few among the public are able to judge talent, or even to talk about it, since the largest number simply come to amuse themselves, to chat, and to show themselves about.68 64 The amateurs recognized the most widely as composers were the chevalier de Brassac, who had two opera-ballets performed in the I730s; the chevalier d'Herbain, who presented several intermezzi in Italy in the I750s; the baron de Rumling, who published an opera and several quartets in the 1780s; and the baron de Bagge, author of a variety of pieces. 65 See "Precis sur l'administration de l'Academie Royale de Musique", i Mar.

Though their social standing was relatively high and not re- cently gained, they did not have major titles, and their assertiveness as patrons often gave them reputations as cultural arrivistes. La Poup- liniere, who exerted a powerful influence on the evolution of eight- eenth-century music as the supporter of Rameau, Johann Stamitz and Francois-Joseph Gossec, was a farmer-general of some importance, part of a Limousin family which had had a minor aristocratic title and connections with the royal house since the sixteenth century.71 One of his leading successors was the baron de Bagge, the son of a seigneur at the court of Saxe-Gotha-Meiningen who settled in Paris about 1750, published a number of string quartets, and hosted one of the best- known musical salons in the city.72 An opera comique called La melo- manie, written in 1781 with the baron supposedly in mind, flatters him for liking "little-known music (la musique rare)" and for his learning ("Monsieur, vous etes savant!") but shows him so "possessed by the demon music" that he all but marries his daughter to an unknown Italian musician.73 Thus did the suspicion of music as magical and demonic live on. Ironically enough, the score to the operetta was dedi- cated not to Bagge himself but to the daughter of the prince de Conde, an amateur who stood among the most prestigious musical patrons. By the 1770s we can see the first strong signs that commercialism was reshaping the roles of patrons. By tradition the relations between patron and musician had been personal, usually exclusive, and absolu- tely clear in respect of the authority of the patron. By the early nine- teenth century patronage was developing into a cash nexus without exclusive status or residence. The change came within the larger trans- formation of servants' roles at the end of the century, the decline in 69 Ibid., p. 17. 70 [Mayeur de Saint Paul], Le vol plus haut ou l'espion des principaux thedtres de la capitale, p. 26. 71 Georges Cucuel, La Poupliniere et la musique de chambre au XVlllesiecle (Paris, 191 3), pp. 3-6.

The tabulation of patrons in the two decades before the revolution shows that musicians were moving freely from one pat- ron's household to another, either in residence or simply support.75 Diderot's Le neveu de Rameau, though a highly idiosyncratic work, displays the new independence of musicians in its erstwhile character: "I am always in a hurry", he confides to the author, "and if I am kept waiting a moment I shout as though I am being robbed".76 Patrons contributed just as much to the change, since as musical entrepreneurs they wished to reduce the cost of domestic support and invest in the careers of numerous musicians. At the same time, how- ever, they did not need musicians as permanent clients as much as be- fore because of the growth of the publishing industry. As Anik Devries has shown, during the mid-eighteenth century publishers shifted their output from individual works to editions, to weekly or monthly tab- loids of sheet music sold by subscription which provided a regular staple of music for domestic music-making.77 Once aided by the inven- tion of lithography, the industry was to turn the framework of musical taste topsy-turvy. Two types of connoisseurs came from the ranks of gens de lettres: aestheticians and general writers. The musical aestheticians display a consistent social profile in their background; though none had major aristocratic titles, virtually all came from the traditional elites active in intellectual life. The one woman among them, Anne Lefebvre Dacier, was a scholar in her own right. Many of the aestheticians were in orders at some point in their careers, most notably Charles Batteux, Jean-Baptiste Dubos, Francois Cartaud de La Villate, Noel Antoine Pluche and Francois de Chateauneuf. Others came from families ac- tive in parlements - Lecerf de la Vieville, Louis Bollioud de Mermet, Jacques Bonnet, Louis Cahusac and Pierre-Francois Desfontaines. A few had careers in the military or diplomatic corps - Francois-Jean 74 Judith Tick, "Musician and Mecene: Some Observations on Patronage in Late Eighteenth-Century France", Internat. Rev.

None seems to have had anything resembling a business career.78 Their background therefore roughly approximates that of members of provincial acad- emies, though with a somewhat greater clerical representation.79 Nor did publicists form part of this patrician group. Jean d'Alembert and Jean-Jacques Rousseau came close, but most of their writings on music had either a practical or a polemical slant which tended to separate them from erudite speculations on le bon gozit.80 Only a few of the aes- theticians seem to have had extensive musical training or to have played the mecene in musical life. The principal exception was Michel- Paul de Chabanon, a man of leisure who passed through a Jesuit edu- cation, technical study of music, performance on the violin, and his- torical and aesthetic writing.81 We can presume that the aestheticians had a readership at least roughly similar in social status and education. These people would count among the readers of the Journal des savants and the Journal de Trevoux, both of which published frequent articles on music theory and aesthetics, assuming extensive classical education. It was them, not musicians, to whom Rameau addressed his theoretical works.82 The most important role performed by the aestheticians was to be- stow the blessings of the classical tradition upon musical activity. In so doing they tried to provide an intellectual legitimacy to what was an essentially worldly form of entertainment. Even if their speculations about Greek music contributed little to the music of their time, it re- lated musical life to the mainstream of French learning. They did, of course, conceive of music in terms now often thought external to the 78 Toussaint Remond de la Mard, however, is reputed to have been the son of an ecuyer or a fermier-general. See "T.

Extraordinarily enough, Rousseau's intermede, Le devin du village, was the only work performed at the Opera before 1774 which was not swept out of the repertoire in the change-over of the I770S. 81 M.-P. de Chabanon, Tableau de quelques considerations de ma vie (Paris, 1795). He does not, however, appear to have been a major patron. 82 In the introduction to his Traite de musique theorique et pratique (Paris, 1737), pp. 5-6, Rameau flattered his readers by saying that for them music was not just "an art of amusement for which taste is concerned only with producing and judging pro- ductions", which is actually just what most connoisseurs were interested in. One re- viewer called the statement "a tasteless and false encomium" and asked "what will all these grand speculations do for a dancer?": see [Guyot-Desfontaines (ed.)], Observa- tions sur les ecrits litteraires, x, pp. 73, 84. 79</page><page sequence="23">art, terms derived from the doctrine that art must imitate nature; their frame of reference was essentially that of literature, not music in and of itself. As Walter Rex has pointed out, the philosophes asked that music, as the servant of the text, make an imitation of nature twice removed - an imitation of an imitation.83 But they could do little else in a period when music did not have its own aesthetics; since music was strictly a contemporary art, its commentators had to draw upon the principles of the other arts. The aestheticians also helped to give French musical life a sense of its own history, a contribution which, though limited in its scope, pointed ahead to the historicism of the nineteenth century. Their vaunted authority in French culture may help to explain why the Academie Royale de Musique continued to perform many operas by Lully and his successors after their deaths. The music of Lully was a political phenomenon in the eighteenth century in many of the same ways as Robert Isherwood has shown it to have been in the seven- teenth.84 Most of the aestheticians acted as apologists for the artistic order installed by Louis le Grand; they eulogized Lully along with though not equal to- Corneille and Racine, and thereby gave music a prominent place in the French cultural pantheon. While in his own time Lully was known as an arriviste, by 1746 an aesthetician such as Bollioud de Mermet spoke only of the composer's greatness, and this opinion continued to hold sway despite growing public boredom with the tragedies lyriques. The authority of the connoisseur as judge of taste was central to his historical sensibility: Now the time when Lully lived, that great Lully, and several others, was the time when music, in the opinion of connoisseurs, approached the closest to good taste, to that true being which never ages ... It is the duty of skilled connoisseurs to raise their voices against tasteless customs: it is for the academies to protect the efforts of partisans of good taste.85 His notion of the connoisseur as the protector of great music from the past was one of the most important precedents for the nineteenth cen- tury's educated amateurs - the devotees of Beethoven - who were to give musical life its own classical tradition. In other respects the aestheticians were far out of step with general taste. For one thing they had little interest in instrumental music, pro- bably the most rapidly developing area of eighteenth-century musical 83 Walter Rex, "A Propos of the Figure of Music in the Frontispiece of the Encyclo- pedie: Theories of Musical Imitation in d'Alembert, Rousseau and Diderot" (forth- coming in Proceedings of the Twelfth Congress of the International Musicological Society, Berkeley I977).

Since few of the aestheticians were active as patrons, they had little taste for the sonata and resented its growing popularity. Bernard Fontenelle was credited with a bon mot about the early keyboard son- ata, "Sonate, que me veux-tu?", which Walter Rex has graciously translated as "Sonata, what is your problem?".86 In 1772 a writer in the Spectateur francais took issue with him: "Sonate, que me veux-tu?", wrote Fontenelle. The minuets, the trios, the andantes of Schobert respond to him: "I want to possess myself of your feelings and intoxicate myself with your pleasures; I want to experience your sensibility and accompany your soul in its delicious movements".87 For another thing, to most people the opera had little to do with the connoisseurs' ideas: to them it was un spectacle, a powerful experience of fantasy-like sets, luxuriant sounds, competitive singers and dancers, and an intense social experience. The reverence for the libretto in aesthetic thinking drew a lot of jokes, the most famous of which was that Rameau supposedly said he could set the Gazette de France to music just as well as Hippolyte etAricie.88 Comments on what people saw in the opera give us a better sense of general taste than writings on le bon gozut. In I699 one writer said bluntly that the "natural inhabi- tants" of the opera were "a little bizarre" and that "reasoning is rare among these people".89 He described the occasion: The opera, as I have said, is an enchanted journey; it is the place of metamorphoses; ... there in the twinkling of an eye men pose as demigods, and goddesses become human; there the traveller does not have the pain of crossing the country, for the country passes before one's eyes; there without stepping out one passes from one end of the world to the other, from the fires of hell to the Elysian fields. Do you grow bored in the desert? A moment later puts you in the land of the gods; another and you are in the land of the fairies.90 When in 1768 directors of the opera asked for suggestions for a motto to place over the door of their new hall, one M. Le Clerc de Montmeroy sent in some lines which were rejected because (helpfully for us) they were thought more of a description than an inscription: The arts in this palace produce their marvels, To enchant hearts, eyes and ears. In this brilliant palace of the arts and fairies, Heroes, gods, demons, all these diverse beings, Set to the chords of modern Orpheans, All are the moving painting of this vast universe.91 86 Rex, op. cit. 87 Quoted in Journal de musique par une societe des amateurs, i (I773), no. 6, pp. 70-I.

Writers of musical commentary, the second type of connoisseur, were also gens de lettres, but they knew more about music and stood much closer to the general public than the aestheticians. Their publi- cations covered a wide spectrum of idioms: librettos, reports on spec- tacles, handbooks on music and the theatre, tracts on recent musical events, and a plethora of chansons, as well as their larger output of plays, novels and the like. Though some of them touched upon aesthetic questions, their main concern was far more pragmatic and oriented towards the public than that of litteratears who debated what Greek music was like. If they wrote for journals it was more often for the Mercure de France than the Journal de Trevoux. They performed a variety of roles in musical life since many wrote for the lyric and dramatic theatres. We owe to Robert Darnton recognition of the significance of such writers.92 In musical life their social and professional status ranged widely from that of gentleman writer to workaday publicist. At the top end of the scale stood Jacques-Bernard Durey de Noinville, who retired from the parlement at Metz to devote himself to literature, producing a handbook-like history of the Paris opera, and the man about town Montadour Neufville de Brunaubois, who left a military career to write racy novels, light verse, and a eulogy to a soprano.93 More com- monly, however, these gens de lettres were "Grub Street" writers such as Darnton has shown existed on the periphery of the literary world. Joseph de La Porte, for example, originally a Jesuit and an editor of several literary journals, sustained himself by publishing Spectacles de Paris, annual guidebooks by which concert- and theatre-goers found out about the season's events in the city. Also typical of Darnton's failed philosophes was Pierre Remond de Sainte-Albine (1 699-1778), a playwright who had a quite unexalted job as royal censor and edited the Gazette de France for twenty-five years. He wrote most of the re- ports on music and theatre in the Mercure de France while he edited the journal between 1749 and 175i, and probably in other years as well. That the son of two domestics in an aristocratic household went so far in musical commentary shows considerable social fluidity among this kind of connoisseur.94 92 Darnton, "The High Enlightenment and the Low-Life of Literature in Pre-Revo- lutionary France". 93 J.-B.

The querelle des bouffons was in large part their own quarrel. While some of the pamphleteers do not seem to have had literary careers, gens de lettres set up the dispute and used it to fight battles with each other, thereby earning a certain resentment from the rest of the public.95 We hear as much from Francois-Antoine Chevrier, a writer of gossipy novels and essays who liked to make attacks on his colleagues. Though violently opposed to the Italian style, he advised his readers to take the whole dispute with a grain of salt. "What results from these quarrels", he declared, "is a confusion which troubles our pleasures, and which does harm to both parties, the [French] partisans as much as the ultramontane".96 All in all, he concluded, "there are more complacent people than connois- seurs in Paris".97 Nonetheless the gens de lettres on the Italian side, Rousseau es- pecially, assumed a posture as connoisseurs far more independent of the public than had been the case in musical affairs before. The Grub Street-like writers prominent in the dispute acted much as Darnton has shown they did later in the century, pressing the regime at its weak points and raising sharp new public issues. Abbe Francois Raguenet had acquired a taste for Italian music only as a side interest while studying architecture in Rome; he is said to have retracted many of his arguments for the foreign style when he faced virulent opposition upon returning home.98 Rousseau, however, used the affair of 1752-4 in the manner of an intellectual entrepreneur. Having broken into Parisian literary life by peddling a new method of musical notation, he made his name in Paris during the querelle because he was the most extreme polemicist of them all -"notre grand connaisseur", as Freron put it.99 Rousseau approached that and later disputes as a professional publicist, not as a gentleman scholar, and broke with the idea that the connoisseur should inform, not manipulate, the public. In so doing he began a powerful tradition of intellectual activism in musical life whose later chapters included the Gluck-Piccinni dispute of the I 770s, controversy over Italian opera during the I830s, and the Wagnerian movement from I850 onwards. 95 For a collection of pamphlets and identification of authors, see Querelle des bouf- fons, ed.

In his article on "Gouit" in the Supple- ment to the Encyclopedie he argued that there exists a "general taste upon which all those well prepared (bien organises) will agree". He defined such a public in an elitist manner as only "ears sufficiently trained, of people sufficiently instructed".'00 In conceiving of an especially knowledgeable and tasteful public he foreshadowed the de- votees of Beethoven and Wagner, who told members of the public what they ought to listen to and asked for a stricter etiquette in public halls. Viewing the differences between connoisseurs we might ask how they compare with the art patrons in Italy during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries that Francis Haskell has studied.'10 A few simi- larities are clear. Both acted as early kinds of agents or critics, capaci- ties which would later fall into professional hands, and exercised similar roles as intermediaries between scholars and the larger public. In what the Venetian Francesco Algarotti did for Tiepolo, and La Poupliniere did for Rameau despite tendencies of conformism among their lesser colleagues we can see the enlightened taste possible under the old order of patronage. But the art patron, by possessing a gallery, could control public taste in a way that the musical connoisseur could not. Choosing a painting was more of a private matter than choosing a concerto -far less an opera. In musical life patronage affected the accustomed pleasures of the upper classes far more directly than in art; as a public pursuit in an age of privilege, musical taste had to come from the audience as a whole. The art patron, moreover, was often both a patron and a writer and drew authority from the classical tradition of critical emulation. Music and letters did not cohabit that easily; in this field aesthetic, practical and patron's interests went their separate ways, and history provided few common assumptions. It is instructive that while Al- garotti conceived of his gallery as a museum of ancients and mod- erns and did ground-breaking work on Florentine primitives, in his Essai sur l'opera he said nothing different from any other musical essayist; he spoke the language of contemporary taste.102 Musical connoisseurs acted, then, only as the first among the power- ful many. The authority they held and the ways in which they related to the wider music public tell us a lot about the state of mind which governed musical taste. Musical learning was respected but not de- manded; people assumed that one could listen on a wide variety of 100 [Jean-Jacques Rousseau], "Gout", in Supplement d l'encyclopedie, iii, p. 234.

Since musical institutions were places of general resort, judgement of taste was a privilege of all per- sons in the upper orders. Lacking a true classical tradition, musical life had no intelligentsia, no learned elite dominating public taste. If litera- ture had a "republic of letters", music had only connaisseurs, often thought pretendus. Within that context, however, many connoisseurs led a serious and artistically discerning musical life. Even if composers could not acquire immortality, stepping into the pantheon of ancient artists, we should not dismiss the world for which they wrote as desir- ous only of background music. The social upheavals which challenged the precept of privilege across Europe at the end of the eighteenth century removed one of the most important bases in the social structure of musical taste. As the public ceased to be a united, unchallengeable authority, learned and general musical taste went their separate ways. By I850 two sets of alien musical values vied with one another: reverence for the now "classical" music of Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven, and thirst for light, contemporary tunes called "salon" or even "popular" music. Once the authority of the classical tradition had been questioned by Romantic movements, music acquired a learned tradition equal in sta- ture to that of the other arts, based in conservatoires and the field of musicology. The more serious connoisseurs came into their own as spokesmen for this new tradition, helping to found symphony orches- tras, giving concerts a stricter etiquette and learned programme notes, and becoming music critics with powerful intellectual authority. In place of the polymorphous structure of tastes and values there ap- peared a set of hierarchies ranking listeners, musical forms, and the purposes of musical experience. Musical life now looked upwards- the length of these imposing hierarchies -and backwards - to its new-found classical past. California State University, Long Beach 85 William Weber</page></plain_text>
