In the investigation here recorded three objects have been kept in view: (1) To determine physiologically the relative sensitiveness of ants and hornets to different odors, so that it may be expressed numerically for comparison under different conditions; (2) to locate</page><page sequence="2">1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 295 the olfactory organs; and (3) to determine morphologically the relative sensitiveness of different species of Hymenoptera to odors. The study of the behavior of normal ants and hornets under experi- mental conditions is used as a basis for correctly interpreting the observations on these insects made abnormal for the purpose of obtaining data which concern the first two objects in view. Many entomologists have had something to say about the seat of the organs of small in insects, but most of the views are purelv speculative. A few have done extensive and thorough experimental work to determine the location of this sense. However, since they have failed to study sufficiently the behavior of the insects investi- gated, the responses observed have misled them in determining the seat of the olfactory organs. It is now generally believed that the antennae bear the organs of smell, but as all the antennal organs are covered with a hard membrane the objection has been raised that such organs cannot receive olfactory stimuli. Hicks (1857) dis- covered some peculiar organs on the bases of the wings and on the legs of insects and suggested that they have an olfactory function. The writer (1914) made a comprehensive study of these organs in the honey bee. He experimentally proved that they have an olfac- tory function and for this reason called them olfactory pores. The present paper embodies the results of a comparative study on Hymenoptera in much the same manner as pursued on the honey bee. To obtain material for the study of the disposition of the organs described by Hicks, adult specimens were used. The legs and wings were pulled off at their articulations, and the thoraces and abdomens were slit open. These parts were put into a cold saturated solution of caustic potash, where they remained one to three days, depending on the size of the material. When removed from this solution the material was washed thoroughly in water and then was decolorized with chlorine gas in the following manner: A small quantity of potassium chlorate was put into a small wide-mouthed bottle. All the parts belonging to a specimen were loosely wrapped in a small piece of cheesecloth which was suspended in the neck of the bottle. Then a pipetteful of hydrochloric acid was dropped upon the potassium chlorate in the bottom of the bottle. At once chlorine gas was liberated which soon bleached the dark colored specimen. To obtain material for the study of the internal anatomy of the organs herein discussed, pupal insects were mostly used. The appendages and bodies of the pupae were cut into small pieces, which were immediately dropped into Carnoy's4fluid (equal parts of abso-</page><page sequence="3">296 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Apr., lute alcohol, chloroform, and glacial acetic acid, with corrosive sublimate to excess). For embedding, the double method of cel- loidin and paraffin was employed. Serial sections cut six and ten microns thick were stained with Ehrich's hamatoxylin and oesin. For further details in regard to technique the reader is referred to the writer's work on the honey bee. The writer is indebted to the following persons: to Messrs. J. C. Crawford, H. L. Viereck and S. A. Rohwer of the U. S. National Museum and the Bureau of Entomology for all the dried specimens used; to Mr. Rohwer the writer is particularly grateful for the systematic arrangement and names of most of the specimens included in the table, pages 330 to 334; to Mr. Theo. Pergande for identifying the ants used; to Miss Mabel Colcord for assistance in obtaining references; and to Emma Pabst McIndoo, the writer's wife, for translating some of the foreign works. A. THE OLFACTORY SENSE OF ANTS AND HORNETS. In order to keep ants in the laboratory, several modified Fielde ant nests were constructed. Colonies of various species were con- fined in these nests. The behavior of the ants in the nests was carefully studied and this behavior was used as a standard for judging the behavior of all the ants used singly in the various experi- ments. Many females of Camponotus' were found in rotten stumps and logs in the woods. Some of them had no eggs, some had only a few eggs, while others had several eggs, a few larvae, and a few pupae. Each female with her own brood, if brood was found in her nest, was put into a honey-bee queen cage. This cage is 3' inches long, 21 inches wide and 3 inch deep. To study the behavior of one colony of Formica obscuriventris Forel in surroundings more natural than those afforded by using Fielde nests, a large glass cage with four compartments was constructed. The nest portion of the cage was 10 inches long, 10 inches wide and 16 inches tall. The entrance of the nest was 10 inches long, 10 inches wide and 8 inches tall. This compartment was raised 8 inches above the table so that one end of it connected with the upper half of one side of the nest. The run-way was 8 inches long, 4 inches wide and 1 inch deep. This was also supported 8 inches above the table. One end of it connected with the distal end of the nest entrance and the other end connected with the fourth compartment, the manger. 1 Here as elsewhere in this paper unless otherwise indicated is meant the large brownish variety of Caniponotus pennsylvanicus Say.</page><page sequence="4">1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 297 The manger, or feeding compartment, was 10 inches long, 8 inches wide and 8 inches tall. It and the nest were not elevated above the top of the table. The tops and bottoms of all four compart- ments were glass, except the bottom of the run-way, which was perforated tin. To make the bottoms of the nest and manger water- tight an additional bottom made of plaster of Paris was added to each of these compartments. The joints of the cage were so securely covered with adhesive cloth and the tops fitted so snugly that vapor collected on the tops and was transformed into large drops of water. A large colony of Formica was found in a rotten log. A half-bushel of the rotten wood and perhaps a quart of the ants with brood of all stages were placed into the nest of the cage. A large flat piece of cotton wet with water was constantly kept in each Fielde nest. A small piece of cotton was kept in each queen cage, and a small amount of water was occasionally poured upon the wood in the nest and twice a week water was put into the manger. Honey, sugar syrup, queen-cage candy, live insects, and larv2e of various insects served as food. I. EXPERIMENTS ON NORMAL ANTS AND HORNETS. To determine the relative sensitiveness of females, males, and workers to various odors, under conditions which permitted of their close observation, triangular experimental cases were used. These were made of three narrow wooden strips, two of which were 5 and the third 4 inches long, each strip being half an inch thick. Wire screen served as a bottom and glass as a top for the case. The apices and bases of these cases rested on two supports above a rigid table and the table legs rested on a concrete floor, near a window. Cheesecloth was spread across both supports, thus making a double bottom for the cases. No screen was used to prevent the ants from seeing the observer because they never showed any responses to the movements made by the observer. The following sources of odor were used for determining the reactions of the ants in the observation cases: Chemically pure essential oils of peppermint, thyme, and wintergreen; food-honey and comb, parts of plant leaves, and bits of the stem of pennyroyal (Hedoma pulegioides ?); ant secretion-formic acid. All these substances except the last were kept in stoppered vials of the same shape and size. The leaves and bits of the stem of the pennyroyal were dried, but they still gave off a strong odor when the vial was uncorked. The formic acid was obtained by squeezing the abdomen</page><page sequence="5">298 PROCEEDINGS OE THE ACADEMY OF [Apr.. of a large worker of Formica or of Camponotus. This caused the ant to discharge all of the formic acid stored up and some of it lodged on the tip end of the abdomen. The liquid on the abdomen gave off a penetrating odor which lasted four or five minutes. An ant or hornet was carefully removed from its nest or cage and was placed into one of the experimental cases. When first put into the case the insect usually wandered about for several minutes, but finally became quiet. The insect was tested with each of the above odors only when it became perfectly quiet, without even the antennae being moved in the least. The stopper of a vial was quickly removed and the vial was gently and slowly placed under the experimental case directly beneath and within one-half inch of the individual being tested. Occasionally the vial was placed a few inches in front of the specimen, to test its ability of smelling for a short distance. When using the odor from the formic acid, the ant whose, abdomen carried some of this acid was held by a pair of forceps under the experimental case in the same position in which a vial was held. When all of these precautions were taken, a normal ant or hornet responds to anyone of these odors without failure. As a control, an empty and odorless vial was now and then placed under the insects in the same manner. If by chance an ant or hornet moved while the control test was being made, its behavior was quite different from that observed when odors were used. Only the first responses have been recorded and in all cases where there was the least doubt as to whether the insect moved for any reason other than the olfactory stimulus, such movements were never recorded. The reaction time was counted in seconds. With an ordinary watch the minimum time which can be definitely recorded is two seconds, although most of the individuals responded to some of the odors much more promptly. Owing to this source of error, the average recorded time is probably double what it should be in the cases when the response was prompt. An intermission of 10 minutes elapsed between any two tests in the same experimental case. A few individuals were tested twice with the same odor, but most of them were tested only once. In the following paragraphs are given the responses of the three castes of ants and of workar hornets to the odors of the six different substances and the average reaction times in seconds. In recording the responses the term "vibrated" is used to describe the rapid movement of the antenna up and down or from side to side. When this movement is slow they are described simply as having "moved. " Quite often an ant or hornet lies flat on its thorax and abdomen,</page><page sequence="6">1914.] NATT-URAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 299 so the word "arose" is to be interpreted as meaning that the insect gets up and stands on its feet. In the averages of reaction times the probable error is presumably high. It has not been calculated since slight differences in reaction time are not considered as signifi- cant in the discussion of results. All anthropomorphic terms are put in quotation marks. 1.

These females were very restless and much time was spent while waiting for them to become quiet. These females and 23 more normal ones, making 48 in all, were put into a small wooden box half full of rotten wood. An equal number of sister females with their funiculi cut off were also put into the box at the same time. They were given food and water. The normal ants lived from 1 to 23 days with an average of 14 days and 10 hours. The mutilated females lived from 4 to 22 hours, with only 19 hours as an average. 2. Winged males of Formica.

Reaction time 2-6 seconds, average 3.40 seconds. The average reaction time of all six odors for the 25 large workers tested is 3.22 seconds. These ants were kept in a Fielde nest with many more workers and males. Between May 24 and July 5, 19 workers of various sizes had died. These 19 lived from 47 to 72 days, with 26 days and 8 hours as an average. 5. Minor Workers of Camponotus. To ascertain if the smallest workers of a colony of ants respond as quickly to odor stimuli as do the largest workers of the same colony, 25 small workers were tested. These were sisters to the large workers just described and were taken from the same colony. The responses of the small workers to the six odors were similar to those of the large workers. In two instances when the ant was tested with honey and comb, it tried to get at the source of the odor. In one instance when the ant was tested with formic acid, it turned around quickly and turned up the abdomen as if going to discharge its own formic acid. The reaction times for the 25 small workers are: oil of peppermint, 2-3 seconds, average 2.12 seconds; oil of thyme, 2-3 seconds, average 2.08 seconds; oil of wintergreen, 2-4 seconds, average 2.60 seconds; honey and comb, 2-10 seconds, average 4.84 seconds; leaves and stems of pennyroyal, 2-5 seconds, average 3.16 seconds; formic acid, 2-8 seconds, average 3.72 seconds. The average reaction time of all six odors for the 25 small workers tested is 3.09 seconds. Only 2 soldiers were tested. They were sisters to the workers just described. Their reaction times are similar to those of the other workers. 6. Females of Vespula maculata. A large hornets' (Vespula maculata) nest, containing many adult hornets and all stages of young, was suspended inside a large wire- screen cage. Twenty-five of the adult worker hornets were removed from the cage, and they were then placed singly into the experimental</page><page sequence="12">1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 305 cases. A piece of queen-cage candy and a piece of cotton wet with water were also placed into each case. The hornets were not "at home" at all in these cases. They were extremely restless, wandered about inside the case for some time, and with their powerful mandi- bles tore the large piece of candy into many bits, but ate very little of it. All of those that failed to become quiet after such a confine- ment for a few hours were discarded and others were used. When tested with the three essential oils, they responded promptly. Most of the responses-were similar to those of normal ants, but one charac- teristic response not observed, when experimenting with ants, was that the hornets seemed to notice the odor; this means that the hornet turned its head toward the floor of the case as if watching from whence the odor was coming, and sometimes it grabbed a wire in the bottom just above the top of the vial. If the hornets saw the vial during these tests they were compelled to see through both the wire-screen bottom and the cheesecloth bottom. It was also neces- sary to place a cheesecloth screen between them and the observer to prevent them from noticing the observer's Movements. They were confined singly in these cases until they died. They lived from 16 hours to 17 days and 21 hours, with an average of 9 days and 7 hours. The reaction times are: oil of peppermint, 2-3 seconds, average 2.12 seconds; oil of thyme, 2-4 seconds, average 2.56 seconds; oil of wintergreen, 2-4 seconds, average 2.60 seconds. These give a general average of 2.43 seconds. II. EXPERIMENTS ON ANTS AND HORNETS WITH MUTILATED ANTENNYD. Since it is now generally believed that the olfactory organs of insects are located in the antennae, and to determine whether the olfactory organs of ants and hornets are located in these appendages, the antennas were mutilated, the behavior of the mutilated insects was then studied, and later thesc insects were tested with odors as usual. 1. Funiculi of ants cut off. The funiculi of 12 workers of Formica were cut off with a small pair of sharp scissors and these mutilated ants with 12 unmutilated normal sisters were placed into a Fielde nest. When a funiculus was cut off, a small drop of yellowish blood exuded from the wound. The mutilated ants when put into the nest cleaned off the exuded blood. They were slightly hostile to each other and to their unmu- tilated sisters. When a bee and a fly were put into the nest, the</page><page sequence="13">306 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Apr., mutilated ants did not offer to catch the strange insects, but the unmutilated sisters lost no time in catching them. Only one of the 12 mutilated ants ate food, the other 11 stood quietly by the food as if ready to attack an enemy. All of the 12 unmutilated ants greedily ate the food. Fifty workers of Formica were removed one at a time from the large glass cage. The funiculi of each were cut off and then the insect was returned to the cage. A small drop of yellowish blood exuded from every wound. Each mutilated ant was quite irritable and invariably attacked one or more sisters, and as a result several ants were killed. The funiculi of 2 soldiers, 10 large workers, and 7 small workers of Cawnponotus_ were cut off. These mutilated sister ants were then put into a Fielde nest. For three hours thereafter they were quite irritable and fought each other, then they became very inactive and when tested with oil of peppermint, they responded slowly by moving away. The next day they were still quite inactive and "paid no attention" to anything, except when they came in contact with each other, they still fought one another. When-tested with odors they failed to respond. At no time did they eat or drink. The funiculi of 30 winged virgin females of Formica were cut off When each antenna was severed a small pencil brush wet with 95 per cent. alcohol was applied to the wound for several seconds. This seemed to check the flow of blood, but did not stop it entirely. A half-hour after the funiculi had been cut off these ants were placed singly into the experimental cases. They wandered about inside the cases considerably, and when they stopped wandering they stroked the stubs of the antenne incessantly and as a rule were very inactive. When tested with the three essential oils-peppermint, thyme, and wintergreen-their responses were less pronounced than were those of unmutilated ants. As a whole, their responses were uncertain, but were of the same nature as those of unmuti-lated ants. Sometimes, instead of giving the usual response, they moved or vibrated one or more legs. Sometimes an ant grabbed a wire in the bottom of the case and held on to it tenaciously and did not react at all to odors. Five of them failed to respond to odors and scarcely moved when touched with a pencil. These ants were dis- carded from the experiments. The other 25 were tested with the three essential oils. Their reaction times are: oil of peppermint, 2-10 seconds, average 3.08 seconds; oil of thyme, 2-15 seconds, average 4.48 seconds; oil of wintergreen, 2-20 seconds, average</page><page sequence="14">1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 307 5.60 seconds. These give a general average of 4.38 seconds, while the same average for unmutilated sister females is 2.12 seconds. Confined in a Fielde nest, these mutilated ants lived from 4 to 22 hours, with only 19 hours as an average. Since these ants were abnormal, it is reasonable to attribute the difference of 2.26 seconds in reaction time to the inactiveness of the insects, and it is certain that the inactiveness was brought about by the operation. 2. Funiculi of ants covered with glue. Thirty winged virgin females of Formica from the large glass cage were fastened to a pine board with pins. One pair of pins was placed x-wise over the petiole and another pair was stuck into the board in the same manner between the head and the thorax. With a small pencil brush the entire surfaces of both funiculi were covered with a thin coat of liquid glue. After an interval of 15 minutes the glue had become perfectly dry, the ant was unpinned and was put into an experimental case. When unpinned from the board the ants ran rapidly, but for a few moments thereafter when placed into the cases they moved about more or less "crazily" and then became so quiet that it was not necessary to wait on them to come to rest. Five failed to respond to odors and when touched lightly with a pencil they scarcely moved, but when touched harder they jumped up quickly and ran about " crazily." These five were discarded from the experiments with odors. All the ants with glued antennae were quite abnormal, because they did not move when mechanically irritated unless really compelled to move. When tested with the three essential oils some responded promptly while others hesitated to respond. As a whole their responses were about as pronounced as, and were similar to, those of unmutilated sister females. Often instead of responding in the usual manner they moved or vibrated one or more legs. Their reaction times are: oil of peppermint, 2-15 seconds, average 6.08 seconds; oil of thyme, 3-15 seconds, average 6.40 seconds; oil of wintergreen, 2-10 seconds, average 4.88 seconds. These give a general average of 5.78 seconds. Since the behavior of these mutilated ants was abnormal and since they lived from 1 to 12 days, with only an average of 6 days, the injury caused by the glue must certainly have brought about the slow reaction time. 3. Flagella of hornets cut off. The flagella of 25 Vespula maculata were cut off with a pair of sharp scissors. A small drop of blood exuded from each wound. When 21</page><page sequence="15">308 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Apr., these mutilated hornets were placed into the experimental cases, they were at first extremely restless, then they became "sullen" and inactive. Some of these mutilated hornets responded promptly when tested with the three essential oils; some responded slowly, and a few failed to respond at all. All of those which failed to respond to odors scarcely moved when touched with a pencil. These were discarded and the flagella of others were cut off. In behavior, hornets with the flagella cut off are abnormal, and these lived from 3 hours to 3 days and 20 hours with 1 day and 13 hours as an average. The reaction times are: oil of peppermint, 2-5 seconds, average 2.84 seconds; oil of thyme, 2-5 seconds, average 2.92 seconds; oil of wintergreen 2-5 seconds, average 3.52 seconds. These give a general average of 3.09 seconds which is 0.66 second greater than the same average for normal hornets. We can certainly attribute this small difference in reaction time to the inactiveness of the mutilated insects. III. SUMMARY. The common response of all the normal ants tested to each of the six odors used is as follows: (1) if lying flat on the thorax and abdomen, they arose either slowly or quickly; (2) if standing on their feet, they moved away either slowly or quickly. The more common response is-tlfey vibrated the antennae hand moved away either slowly or quickly. The most common response is-they vibrated the antennae more or less vigorously. Many of the ants turned around over the odors. While testing with honey and formic acid, many of the ants tried to get through the bottoms of the cases to the sources of the odors. In one instance while testing with formic acid, the ant turned up its abdomen in the same position in which the abdomen is held when the ant attacks an enemy. The average reaction times of all six odors for all the normal ants tested in any one set of experiments are as follows: females of Formica 2.15 seconds, males of Formica 2.63 seconds, males of Camponotus 2.74 seconds, major workers of Camponotus 3.22 seconds, and minor workers of Camponotus 3.09 seconds. The average reaction time of the three essential oils for all the normal hornets tested is 2.43 seconds. From these figures, it is evident that the olfactory sense in the ants and hornets tested is quite acute. Judging from the reaction times of the females and males of Formica, the olfactory sense in both sexes is equally developed. The slightly slower reaction time of the</page><page sequence="16">1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 309 males may be due, however, to the fact that these males were young and because they were not very active. The olfactory sense of the males of Formica and of Camponotus seems to be about equally devel- oped in both. The olfactory sense in the males of Camponotus seems to be more highly developed than it is in the workers of the same genus. There seems to be practically no difference in the ability of the large and small workers of Camponotus to receive odor stimuli. Ants with the funiculi either cut off or covered with glue are not normal and they do not live long. They soon become inactive and some of them can hardly be mechanically irritated. Those which almost fail to respond to mechanical stimuli never respond to odor stimuli. These were discarded from the experiments in which odors were used and all the others were tested with odors. The average reaction times of the mutilated ants are about double those of unmutilated sisters. The slowness in responding to odors is probably due to the inactiveness of the mutilated insects. If the slow reaction times indicate that some of the olfactory organs were prevented from receiving odor stimuli, then the olfactory organs that brought about the responses must be looked for elsewhere than on the antennie. Hornets with the antennae cut off are not normal and never live long. The reaction time of hornets thus mutilated is only 0.66 second more than that of unmutilated hornets. Most of the olfac- tory organs, if not all, of hornets must be looked for elsewhere than on the antennae. IV. MORPHOLOGY OF THE OLFACTORY PORES. Since the organs in the antennae of ants and hornets fail to receive most, if not all, of the odor stimuli used in the preceding experiments, and because the writer proved experimentally that the pores first described by Hicks (1857) do receive odor stimuli in the honey bee, these pores in ants and hornets will now be discussed. 1. Disposition. In making a study of the disposition of the olfactory pores of ants and hornets the following were used: five specimens each of winged females, winged males, and major workers of Formica; five specimens each of dealated females, winged males, major and minor workers of Camponotus; and one specimen of Vespula maculata. All the wings and legs of all 36 specimens were examined carefully for pores. Since the winged female of Formica is typical, its olfactory pores</page><page sequence="17">310 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Apr., will be described in detail and then the variations found in the other above-enumerated individuals will be stated. (a) Winged Female of Formica.-The wings have dorsal and ventral surfaces, and the legs may be divided for description into four sur- faces. The inner surface faces the ant's body and the outer surface is directed from the body. The anterior surface faces the head, wlhile the posterior surface is directed backward. There are always three groups of pores on the front wing, two on the hind wing, three on the trochanter, and one on the femur of each leg. There are also two groups of isolated pores on each trochanter and on each tibia. The groups are located as follows: Nos. 1 to 5 inclusive lie on the bases of the wings, Nos. 1 and 2 (text fig. 1) being on the 2.

X 15.</page><page sequence="18">1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 311 ventral surface of the front wing and No. 3 (text fig. 2) on the dorsal surface of the same wing; No. 4 (text fig. 2) lies on the dorsal sur- face of the hind wing, and No. 5 (text fig. 1) lies on the ventral sur- face of the same wing; Nos. 6 to 8 inclusive, always lie on the trochanter at the distal end, Nos. 6 and 7 (text fig. 1) being on the anterior surface, while No. 8 (text fig. 2) lies on the inner surface. No. 9 (text fig. 2) always lies at the proximal end of the femur on the posterior surface. Groups a and b of the isolated pores lie on the trochanter, while groups c and d lie on the tibia. The groups of isolated pores are not always constant in position, but are usually located as follows: Gioup a (text fig. 1) lies on the outer surface near the distal end of the trochanter and group b (text fig. 2) is found near the proximal end of the same segment on the inner surface. Groups c and d (text figs. 1 and 2) combined form a horseshoe-shaped row of pores with the toe of the horseshoe lying on the posterior surface at the proximal end of the segment, and the sides of the horseshoe pass around the tibia in opposite directions and end with the two heels lying on the anterior surface. In the female of Formica, as well as in most ants, all the groups are quite constant in number on all the legs and wings and the positions of those on the legs vary only slightly by them rotating around the segments. Those on the wings never vary in position. In fact, the number of groups and their respective positions are almost identical to those of the worker honey bee. For all five females of Formica examined, the groups of pores on the wings and third pair of legs vary in regard to the number of pores as follows: No. 1, 11 to 18, average 13; No. 2, 70 to 86, average 78; No. 3, 60 to 74, average 69; No. 4, 9 to 13, average 12; No. 5, 35 to 39, average 37; No. 6, 4 to 8, average 5; No. 7, 17 to 19, average 18; No. 8, 6 to 9, average 8; No. 9, 9 to 11, average 9; group a, 3 to 6, average 5; group b, 3 to 5, average 4; group c, 1 to 6, average 3; group d, 4 to 5, average 5. The numbers of pores in the groups on the first and second pairs of legs vary slightly more than those on the third pair of legs. On the first pair of legs there is a total average number of 112 pores; on the second pair 116 pores; and on the third pair 114 pores, making a total of 342 pores as an average for all six legs of a female of Formica. The front pair of wings has 320 pores, while the hind pair has only 98 pores, making 418 pores for all four wings. It is thus evident that an average female of Formica has only 760 pores, while by referring to the table page 333 it is seen that a worker honey bee has 2,204 pores.</page><page sequence="19">312 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Apr., (b) Other Ants and Hornets Examined.-The groups of pores in the other specimens of Formica and Camponotus examined are tolerably constant in number and position. They are so similar to those of the females of Formica, that only the total number of pores will be given. Counting the pores for all five individuals in each set, the total average number of pores is as follows: males of Formica-legs 356, legs and wings 892; major workers of Formica-legs 332; dealated females of Camponotus-legs 317; males of Camponotus- legs 322, legs and wings 1,090; major workers of Camponotus-legs 331; minor workers of Camponotus-legs 314. In regard to the total number of pores on the legs, it is thus seen that there is practi- cally no difference between the number on the legs of workers and queens and only a few more on the legs of males, but the wings of males have many more than do the wings of females. (For more details see table, page 331.) The groups of pores in the worker hornet (Vespula maculata) are also quite constant in number and position and resemble those of the worker honey bee more than those of an ant. The group on the femur is always double, consisting of two rows of pores widely divided, and for this reason each row is regarded as a separate group. Groups Nos. 7 and 9 on the leg of an ant also each consist of two rows of pores, but since the two rows lie side by side they may be regarded as only one group. Group No. 6 of an ant is a straight row, while the pores of the same group of a hornet are bunched. The other groups of the hornet are quite similar to those of the honey bee. The total number of pores for the hornet examined is 1,957. (See table, page 333, for details.) The pores of an ant vary more in size than do those of the hornet or honey bee. Group No. 8 (Plate XI, fig. 3)2 on the trochanters well illustrates this. Here the largest pore is at least five times the size of the smallest one. Those on the tibiae (fig. 4) also vary much. Those on the wings (fig. 5) vary only slightly in size. In proportion to the sizes of an ant and of a worker honey bee, the pores of the ant are much larger. The pores of a hornet are proportionately as large as those of the honey bee. 2. Structure. (a) External Structure.-When examined under a low-power lens, the olfactory pores may be easily mistaken for hair sockets from 2AIl figures, except text figures 1, 2, and 3, are numbered consecutively on Plates XI and XII.</page><page sequence="20">1914.1 NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 313 which the hairs have been removed. When more carefully observed under a high-power lens, a striking difference in external form is seen. The pores appear as small bright spots when a strong trans- mitted light is used. Each bright spot has a dark boundary or pore wall (fig. 3, PorW). Near the centre of this boundary is a trans- parent spot, the pore aperture, which may be round, oblong, or slit-like. On the wings the pore apertures are always round or oblong (fig. 5, PorAp) and never slit-like as on the legs (fig. 3, PorAp). At the lowest focusing level any pore aperture, however, is perfectly round. The boundary (fig. 3, PorB) of the pore is usually bordered by a band of darker chitin. (b) Internal Structure.-All the olfactory pores studied are inverted flask-shaped structures in which the bottoms of the flasks are chitin- ous layers (fig. 6, ChL). These layers of chitin contain the pore apertures and they form external coverings for the pores. In a typical pore as found in the tibia of Formica, the neck (NkFl) of the flask is wide and the mouth (Mo) is flaring. About two-thirds of the space at the bottom of the flask is occupied by a chitinous cone (Con). The cone generally stains less deeply than the surrounding chitin (Ch), but is not separated from it. The apex of the cone is hollow and extends to the neck of the flask. The sense cell (SC) lies beneath the mouth of the flask. It is bipolar, long, and slender, and comparatively large. The sense fiber (SF) of this cell is en- larged at the apex of the cone. Its peripheral end runs into the hollow of the cone, pierces the bottom of the cone, and enters the lowest portion of the pore aperture. The nerve fiber (fig. 13, NF) of the sense cell joins a nerve cord. The nucleus (SCNuc) with its nucleoli (SCNucl) is always conspicuous. Now since the anatomy of a pore is understood, the external appearance of a pore may be explained. The dark border of chitin (fig. 3, PorB) around the boundary of the pore is due to the thick chitin (fig. 13, aa) at the mouth of the flask. The boundary (fig. 3, PorW) is the same as the greatest width of the flask. The bright area inside the boundary is caused by the light having to pass through only the chitinous cone (fig. 13, Con) and the chitinous layer (fig. 13, ChL). The aperture appears transparent because the sense fiber (fig. 13, SF) and all the other tissues have been removed by the caustic potash treatment. Sections through the tibise of pupal muddobbers throw some light on the origin of the anatomy of a pore. Quite often very large cells (Plate XII, fig. 38, SC) may be seen among the small hypodermal cells</page><page sequence="21">314 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Apr., (HypS). This indicates that the sense cells are modified hypodermal cells. It appears that the cone (Con) is formed after the surrounding chitin is almost completed. In figure 38 the hypodermis (Hyp) has shrunk a short distance from the chitin (Ch) drawing the hypodermal strand (HypSt) an equal distance from the base of the cone (Con). This strand probably served as a passage-way for conveying a hypodermal secretion which formed the cone. With Ehrlich's hiimatoxylin and oesin the outer margin (a) of the cone stains a faint purple. The inner margin (b) is pink, hav ng the same color as that of the lowest strata (c) of the surrounding chitin. The chitin at d is light yellow; at e, dark yellow, and at f, it is semi- transparent. At these last three places it failed to stain. Judging from what can be gleaned from all the sections studied, including those of the h6ney bee, the origin of these organs is probably about as follows. In the early pupal stage, the hypodermis is thick, no chitin is yet formed, and all the hypodermal cells have about the same size. In the 16-day-old worker pupse of the honey bee neither pores nor sense cells are found, but many large hypodermal cells occur where the sense cells later appear. At this age the chitin and hairs are being rapidly formed. A day later pores and sense cells are found. The sense cells and flasks including the pore apertures are then simultaneously formed, while the cone and sense fiber are later formations. Both poles of the sense cell are formed as growing processes. The peripheral pole unites with the pore aperture and the inner one joins the nerve branch while the cone is being formed by the hypodermal strand. The flasks vary much in diameter and length. The length always depends on the thickness of the chitin. Figures 6 and 7 represent the largest and smallest pores in the tibiae of the pupal females of Formica. Figures 8 to 11 represent the flasks as found in the wings of the same insect. Figure 8 is from group No. 2, and figure 9 is from group No. 3 on the front wing. Figure 10 is from group No. 4, and figure 11 is from group No. 5 on the hind wing. Figure 12 from group No. 2 on the front wing shows the slight variations in size of the flasks and also the bunch of sense cells (SC). Here none of the pore apertures were discernible. Figures 13 and 14 show how the pores, sense cells (SC), and hypodermis (Hyp) actually appear in sections through the trochanters of the same insect. Figure 13 is from group No. 7 and figure 14 is from group No. 8. Quite often the sense cells (fig. 14, SC) lie among the hypodermal cells (HypS), and hypodermal strands (HypSt) may be seen running toward and</page><page sequence="22">1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 315 into the cones, again indicating that the sense cells are modified hypodermal cells and that the hypodermis forms the cones about the time when the other chitin is completed. Hair-mother cells (HrMS) forming the hairs are also common. Figure 15 is a pore from group No. 6 and figure 16 is an isolated pore from group b on the trochanter. Sections through the trochanters of adult dealated females of C. pennsylvanicus and through the front wings of adult females and males of C. mela were made. The pores (figs. 17 to 22) found in these sections are like those already described for the females of Formica. To ascertain if the nerves running to the wings and the sense cells in the stubs of the wings of old dealated female ants are present, the thorax of a dealated female of Camponotus was cut transversely into sections 25 microns thick. This female had been kept in captivity eight months and had reared a small family. On account of the broken conditions of the sections, nerves cannot be traced into the stubs of the wings, but the thoracic ganglia give off branches, and some of these run toward the bases of the wings. Pores and sense cells are easily found in the stubs of the wings;. The sense cells appear to be normal in all respects. Figure 23, SC, represents a few of them taken from one wing. It thus seems that the nerves and sense cells do not degenerate, as do most of the muscles in the thorax of a dealated female ant, but the organs in the bases of the wings appear to function throughout the life of the ant. Text fig. 3 is a diagram representing a transverse-longitudinal view of a small portion of the femur (F) and about two-thirds of the trochanter (Tr) from the third leg of a female of Formica. Groups Nos. 7, 8, 9, and b are shown as marked by these characters. The anatomy of the leg and the innervation of these groups are also shown. At this articulation the nerve (N) runs near the centre of the leg and nerve branches (NB) are given off which run to the groups of sense cells (SC). The sense cells are so located that the muscles (M) are not near them, and a trachea runs near each group of sense cells. Plate XI, fig. 25, and Plate XII, fig. 26, are semidiagrams repre- senting the innervation of the groups of pores (marked 2, 3, 4, and 5) as found in the wings of Formica. Each wing arises from a mche (Nic) in the thorax. The hard chitin of the wing is represented by solid black, the soft articular chitin of the wing by dots, and the hard chitin of the thorax by broken lines. Sections through the wings and legs of pupae of the hornet (Vespula maculata) and the muddobber (Sceliphron cementarius) were also made. The pores of the hornet (figs. 27 to 32) are the largest ones</page><page sequence="23">316 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Apr., studied, and this insect is also the largest one examined. The pore apertures are actually visible in only four of the potres drawn (figs. 29 and 31). The pores of the muddobber (figs. 33 to 41) are the second largest ones studied. Four pores (fig. 41) were found on the thorax at the base of the niche of the front wing. All the pores of the ant, hornet, and muddobber described in the preceding pages may be compared with a typical pore (fig. 42) from the tibia of a worker honey bee. All drawings of these pores are enlarged the same number of times. V. PHYSIOLOGY OF THE OLFACTORY PORES. To ascertain whether the pores, which have been studied, are actually the organs in ants and hornets that receive odor stimuli, the wings and legs of many individuals were mutilated. The behavior of these mutilated insects was carefully studied and they were tested r~~~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ T Fig. 3.-Diagram of a transverse-longitudinal view of a small portion of femur (F) and about two-thirds of trochanter (Tr) from hind leg of female of Formica, showing the internal anatomy of the leg and innervation of groups of pores, Nos. 7, 8 and 9.</page><page sequence="24">1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 317 with the various odors in the same manner as described on pages 297 to 305. 1. Dedlated females of Formica. May 31, four dealated females and several workers were removed from a small colony of Formica. They were placed into a Fielde nest. Later the four females were put singly intc experimental cases and were tested with the six odors. Their reaction times are: oil of peppermint 2-3 seconds, average 2.50 seconds; oil of thyme 2-3 seconds, average 2.25 seconds; oil of wintergreen 2-3 seconds, average 2.75 seconds; honey and comb 2-5 seconds, average 3.25 seconds; leaves and stems of pennyroyal 2-4 seconds, average 3.00 seconds; formic acid 3-4 seconds, average 3.50 seconds. These give a general average of 2.89 seconds, while the same average for winged females of the same species is 2.45 seconds. The wing niches of the four dealated females were examined. In seven of the eight niches, pores were seen. One of these females lived 38 days. The other three and all the workers died November 25th. They had been neglected and had not been given water for more than a week. 2. Wings of females of Formica pulled off. All 4 wings of each of 25 virgin females of Formica were pulled off. This is accomplished by pinning the ant to the board as described on page 307. Seize a wing with the thumb and index-finger and pull gently with the wing standing at right angles to the thorax. A half- hour after the wings had been pulled off, these wingless females were tested with the six odors. In behavior they appeared normal in every respect except they responded to odors slightly more slowly. Confined in a Fielde nest alone, they lived from 4 to 16 days with 10 days as an average, whereas their winged sisters lived 14 days and 10 hours as an average. Their reaction times are: oil of pepper- mint 2-4 seconds, average 2.20 seconds; oil of thyme 2-3 seconds, average 2.44 seconds; oil of wintergreen 2-4 seconds, average 2.32 seconds; honey and comb 3-6 seconds, average 3.84 seconds; leaves and stems of pennyroyal 2-5 seconds, average 3.16 seconds; formic acid 2-5 seconds, average 3.16 seconds. These give a general average of 2.85 seconds, while the same average for sister females with wings is 2.45. All the wings of these 25 females were examined micro- scopically after they had been pulled off. Of the front wings 14 carried pores and 36 were devoid of pores. Of the hind wings 24 carried pores and 26 were devoid of pores. Thus when tested with</page><page sequence="25">318 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Apr., odors these ants carried pores on only 62 per cent. of the bases of their wings. Might not the difference of 0.40 second in reaction time between the reaction time of these wingless ants and that of the winged sisters be due to the fact that the pores on 38 per cent. of the wings were prevented from functioning? To ascertain if a greater percentage of wings including the pores could be pulled off artificially, the wings of 37 more winged females were pulled off. This time greater care in pulling off the wings was 'taken. These wings were also examined microscopically. Counting all the wings from both lots of ants, 62 ants in all, 50 per cent. of the wings pulled off bore pores. Of the front wings pulled off 52 bore pores and 72 were devoid of pores. Of the hind wings pulled off 72 bore pores and 52 were devoid of pores. To ascertain the percentage of wings including the pores actually lost by the natural method, many detached wings from the virgin females were removed from the large glass cage. These wings were certainly shed in the same manner in which the wings of female ants are shed in nature. The worker ants had carried great numbers of these detached wings out of the nest and had laid them on the refuse pile. Of the 786 detached wings of females examined micro- scopically only 18 per cent. of them bore pores. Of the front wings 120 bore pores and 365 did not bear pores. Of the hind wings 21 bore pores and 280 did not carry pores. Thus one-third of the front wings bore pores, while only one-thirteenth of the hind wings bore them. As stated on page 311, the average number of pores for both front wings of one of these females is 320, and the average number of pores for both hind wings of the same female is 98. With these females it is, therefore, evident that when the wings are shed only 21 per cent. of the pores as an average are lost, while 79 per cent. are not prevented from functioning, because the wings devoid of pores always break off at a weak place (text fig. 1 and Plate XI, fig. 25, xx, yy) in the chitin just distal to the groups of pores. The wound made by the wing breaking off at this place cannot affect the sense cells in the least because a thick layer of chitin separates these cells from the outside air. One of the virgin females which had recently shed her wings was examined. All four of the bases of the wings of this female were left intact. 3. Wings of males of Formica pulled off. The wings of 7 males of Formica were pulled off and the mutilated males were tested with odors as usual. They appeared normal in</page><page sequence="26">1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 319 every respect except they responded more slowly to odors than they did before the wings were pulled off. Confined in a Fielde nest with several sister workers, they lived from 3 to 9 days, with an average of 5 days. Their reaction times are: oil of peppermint 2-5 seconds, average 3.14 seconds; oil of thyme 2-5 seconds, average 3.00 seconds; oil of wintergreen 2-4 seconds, average 2.86 seconds; honey and comb 3-10 seconds, average 4.86 seconds; leaves and stems of pennyroyal, 2-5 seconds, average 3.71 seconds; formic acid 3-5 seconds, average 3.43 seconds. These give a general average of 3.50 seconds, whereas the same average for the same ants before the wings were pulled off is 2.63 seconds. The detached wings of these 7 males and those from other brother ants were examined microscopically. Of the 56 detached wings examined, 87- per cent. bore pores. Of the front wings 29 bore pores and one had no pores. Of the hind wings 20 bore pores and 6 had no pores. On page 331 it is stated that the average number of pores for both front wings of one of these males is 402, and for both hind wings of the same male the average number of pores is 134. From these figures it is plain that 92 per cent. of the pores as an average were lost when the wings were pulled off. The difference of 0.87 second in reaction time be- tween the reaction time of the same males before the. wings were pulled off and the reaction time after the wings were pulled off may possibly be attributed to the loss of the 92 per cent. of the pores on the wings. 4. Bases of wings glued and legs of females of Formica covered with vaseltine. With a small pencil brush the bases of all 4 wings of each of 25 winged females of Formica were covered with liquid glue. When the glue was dry another small pencil brush was employed in covering the surface of each leg with a vaseline-beeswax mixture. Since yellow commercial vaseline spreads too much when used alone, a mixture was mad&amp; by using three parts of vaseline and one part of beeswax. All parts of- the leg except the tarsus were covered with this mixture. As soon as this double operation was completed, the ant was put into an experimental case. When unpinned from the board the ant was as active as usual and when placed inside the experimental case it was slightly more restless than ordinarily. Confined singly they cannot remove the glue from the wings, but they begin at once to clean off the vaseline-beeswax mixture. They pulled the front legs</page><page sequence="27">320 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Apr., between the mandibles and 'licked them with the mouth parts. Then they rubbed the front legs on the other two pairs and again put the front legs to the mouth parts. Sometimes they also stand still and stroke the antennas with the front legs. As a result of all these cleaning processes, they smear the vaseline-beeswax mixture over the greater part of the body and some of it covers the spiracles. Except for the slight restlessness caused by the double operation and for the slowness in responding to odors, they appeared normal in all other respects. They lived from 1 to 5 days, with 3 days as an average. Their deaths were probably due to the vaseline- beeswax mixture being spread over the spiracles. Their responses to odors were similar to those of intact ants, but more often than with unmutilated ants they vibrated one or more legs. The reaction times are: oil of peppermint 3-12 seconds, average 5.16 seconds; oil of thyme 3-10 seconds, average 4.48 seconds; oil of wintergreen 3-10 seconds, average 4.56 seconds; honey and comb 4-25 seconds, average 6.32 seconds; leaves and stems of pennyroyal 3-10 seconds, average 4.92 seconds; formic acid 3-15 seconds, average 5.80 seconds. These give a general average of 5.21 seconds, which is slightly more than twice the same average for unmutilated sister females. May not this slow reaction time be attributed to the fact that many of the pores were prevented from functioning? 5. Dedlated females of Camponotus. During May and June, 1913, 26 dealated females of Camponotus were caught in the woods, either with colonies or just beginning to found colonies. When brought to the laboratory they were put into Fielde nests and queen cages as already described on page 296. Twenty-five of these females were placed singly into the experimental cases. Each one soon became quiet. and then it was tested with the six odors. Their responses were similar to those already described for unmutilated workers of the same species. The reaction times are: oil of peppermint 2-3 seconds, average 2.24 seconds; oil of thyme 2-4 seconds, average 2.28 seconds; oil of wintergreen 2-3 seconds, average 2.44 seconds; honey and comb 3-20 seconds, average 6.00 seconds; leaves and stems of pennyroyal 2-4 seconds, average 3.00 seconds; formic acid 2-12 seconds, average 3.52 seconds. These give a general average of 3.25 seconds. The longevity of these females cannot be given. Only 4 of those confined in queen cages have died up to the time of this writing, May 20, 1914. These 4 lived from 3 to 56 days. Not a single one kept in the Fielde nests has yet died.</page><page sequence="28">1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 321 6. Glue in wing niches and legs of dedlated females of Camponotus covered with vaseline. During October the 22 remaining live dealated females of Cam- ponotus were tested with the six odors after the niches from which their wings arise had been filled with liquid glue and the legs had been covered with the vaseline-beeswax mixture. When put into the experimental cases they were as quiet as before they were thus mutilated and seemingly removed but little of the vaseline. They appeared normal in all respects except that they responded to odors more slowly than they did before the glue and vaseline were used. The reaction times are: oil of peppermint 3-15 seconds, average 5.64 seconds; oil of thyme 3-15 seconds, average 6.32 seconds; oil of wintergreen 3-10 seconds, average 5.14 seconds; honey and comb 3-60 seconds, average 19.00 seconds; five times they failed to respond to the honey odor when the vial was held under them for 60 seconds; leaves and stems of pennyroyal 4-15 seconds, average 6.32 seconds; formic acid 3-10 seconds, average 5.23 seconds. These give a general average of 7.94 seconds, which is more than twice the reac- tion time obtained by using the same ants before glue was put into the wing niches and vaseline was put on the legs. At the present writing (May 20, 1914) the longevity of these mutilated females cannot be given, for as yet only 5 of them have died. These 5 lived from 7 to 44 days. After being tested, each female was returned to her own nest or cage. Those put back into Fielde nests were at first accepted hostilely by their offspring. This hostility was probably due to the presence of the glue and vaseline. All of those that had workers were sooner or later cleaned, and thus they became normal again. Four of the five that died had no workers and the vaseline spread over the greater portion of the ant's body. Cannot the slow reaction time obtained by using the mutilated females be attributed to the fact that many of the pores were prevented from receiving odor stimuli on account of these pores being covered with glue and vaseline? 7. Wings of males of Camponotus pulled off. The wings of 25 males of Camponotus were pulled off. Usually a small drop of blood exuded from the wound when a wing was pulled off. They were quite restful and were easily tested. They appeared normal in all respects except that they responded to odors more slowly than did their brothers with intact wings. The reaction times are: oil of peppermint 2-5 seconds, average 2.72 seconds; oil</page><page sequence="29">322 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Apr., of thyme 2-4 seconds, average 2.88 seconds; oil of wintergreen 2-5 seconds, average 3.12 seconds; honey and comb 3-10 seconds, average 4.56 seconds; leaves and stems of pennyroyal 2-6 seconds, average 3.64 seconds; formic acid 3-7 seconds, average 4.00 seconds. These give a general average of 3.49 seconds, which is one and a fourth times the reaction time of unmutilated males. These mutilated males lived from 1 to 24 days, with 7 days and 2 hours as an average. The detached wings of these males were examined microscopically. Of the front wings pulled off 45 bore pores and 5 were devoid of pores. Of the hind wings pulled off 4 had pores and 9 were devoid of pores. As stated, the average number of pores for the front wings of the males of this species is 595 and for the hind wings the average number of pores is 173. It is, therefore, evident that 88 per cent. of the pores belonging to the wings were prevented from functioning. May not this fact be used to explain the slow reaction time of these wingless males? 8. Wings of Vespula maculata pulled off. The wings of 21 workers of Vespula maculata were pulled off. Only occasionally did a small drop of blood exude from the wounds. When placed into the experimental cases, they were as restless as were their sister winged hornets and they appeared normal in all respects except that they responded more slowly to odors than did the ones with wings. They lived in these cases from 2 days to 6 days and 12 hours, with 4 days, and 8 hours as an average. The reaction times are: oil of peppermint 3-20 seconds, average 6.57 seconds; oil of thyme 3-15 seconds, average 6.19 seconds; oil of wintergreen 3-15 seconds, average 6.29 seconds. These give a general average of 6.35 seconds, which is almost three times the same average for sister hornets with the wings intact. The detached wings of these mutilated hornets were examined microscopically. Of the front wings pulled off 29 bore pores and 13 were devoid of pores. Of the hind wings pulled off 41 bore pores and 1 was devoid of pores. As stated, the average number of pores for the front wings of these hornets is 1,036 and the average number of pores for the hind wings is 448. It is, therefore, evident that 78 per cent. of the pores belonging to the wings were pre- vented from functioning. May not this fact again be used to explain the slow reaction time of these wingless hornets?</page><page sequence="30">1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 323 9. Summary. From the preceding pages it is seen that probably not more than 21 per cent. of the pores on the wings of female ants are lost at the time the wings are shed and that the remaining 79 per cent. of the pores are not prevented from functioning because the wings break off at a weak place (text fig. 1 and Plate XI, fig. 25, xx, yy) in the chitin just distal to the groups of pores. The wound caused by the wings breaking off cannot affect the sense cells connected with the pores, because a heavy layer of chitin separates them from the external air. Sections through the thorax of an old dealated female ant show that most of the muscles in the thorax have degenerated, but the nerves running to the wings are still present and the pores in the stubs of the wings are still connected with sense cells. This indicates that the sense organs in the stubs of the wings function throughout the life of the ant. All of the results obtained in the experiments on normal and mutilated insects are summarized in the following table. To make the table complete for Hymenoptera and for comparison, the data from the writer's former paper concerning the worker honey bee are appended. The "three odors" used are those from oil of pepper- mint, oil of thyme, and oil of wintergreen. The "six odors" used are those from oil of peppermint, oil of thyme, oil of wintergreen, honey and comb, leaves and stems of pennyroyal, and formic acid. It will be noted that when the antennae of any of the insects listed in the table are mutilated, the insects are abnormal in behavior; but when the pores on the legs and wings are covered, the insects are normal in behavior. The reaction times obtained by using insects with mutilated antennee are slower than those obtained when unmutilated individuals are used, but it is quite possible that the slower reaction times are caused by the abnormal behavior of the insects and are not due to the theory that some of the olfactory organs are prevented from functioning. Wheil the wings are pulled off artificially, about three-fourths of the pores on these appendages are lost and the reaction times are slightly slower. When the pores on the legs and wings are covered, the reaction times are more than doubled, while in the honey bee the reaction time is increased twelve times. It was impossible to prevent the ants from removing most of the vaseline from the legs. 22</page><page sequence="31">324 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Apr., Table .--Olfactory Experiments on Ants, Hornets, and Bees.

DISPOSITION OF THE OLFACTORY PORES OF OTHER HYMENOPTERA. In making a comparative study of the olfactory pores of Hymenop- tera, 29 species representing 22 families have been used (those of ants and hornets already described included). Since the pores of only one specimen for each species were counted, the total number of pores recorded certainly cannot be a fair average. Besides this error, there is also a probable error of not less than 10 per cent. on an ,average for all the specimens. In the smaller individuals, particu- larly ants, the probable error is perhaps not more than 2 or 3 per eent., but in the larger specimens, especially the hairy ones, this werror is perhaps more than 10 per cent. The pores on only the wings and legs have been included in the total numbers. On all the stings examined, pores have been found. The mouth parts of a few of the specimens were hurriedly examined; all of them bear pores. A few .antennae were also hurriedly examined. None of the pores first described by Hicks were found on these appendages, but this can be definitely decided only after a critical study of the antennae has been completed. No pores were found on the petiole or other parts of -the ant not already named. I. DISTRIBUTION. Since all the variations relative to distribution are slight, only -the most important ones will be mentioned. In all the species having two segments in the trochanter, the groups of pores ordi- narily found on the femur occur on the second segment of the tro- chanter. Sometimes groups Nos. 1 and 2 on the front wing are united. At other times group No. 2 is almost divided into two separate groups. The groups of pores are usually located in areas devoid of hairs, but occasionally the groups are closely bordered by -hairs. Sometimes a group is surrounded by clear chitin caused by the group lying in an area of thin chitin. In short, the distri- bution of pores of those species placed below the ants in the scheme of classification is similar to the distribution of the pores in ants; the distribution of those species placed above the ants in the scheme of classification is more like to the distribution of pores in the honey bee. II. NUMBER. In regard to the number of groups and the total number of pores found in the different species, the variations are great. Cimbex,</page><page sequence="33">326 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Apr., regarded as the lowest hymenopteron,- has the least number of groups of all the species examined, but it stands fourth in regard to the number of isolated pores. Its total number of pores is larger than those of many of the higher forms. Among ants the variations are also great. For the legs of ants the number of pores varies from 211 to 356 and for the winged ants the total number varies from 463 to 1,090. The smallest specimen among the ants and the second smallest one of all the Hymenoptera examined is a female with 463 pores as the lowest number. The drone honey bee with 2,608 pores has the highest number. The smallest specimen examined is a wasp with 688 pores. (For further details see table, p. 332.) III. RELATIVE SENSITIVENESS OF SPECIES EXAMINED TO ODORS. It was impossible to obtain a sufficient number of live insects of each species examined so that their relative sensitiveness to odors could be experimentally determined. If such had been possible, the reaction times obtained would probably not represent the true relative sensitiveness better than the method described below, because the reaction times depend not only upon the ability to receive odors, but also upon the agility and sluggishness of the insects used. Using only the grand total number of pores of each species examined (see table, pp. 330 to 334) as a basis, it is also impos- sible to ascertain the relative sensitiveness because the numbers are too variable. Moreover, it may be generally said that the smaller the species the fewer and proportionately larger are the pores. The method adopted for determining the relative sensitiveness to odors is: (1) determine the relative sizes of the prepared insects; (2) divide the total area of cytoplasm exposed to the air in all the pores of a given insect by the total area of cytoplasm exposed to the air in all the pores of Microgaster, used as a standard; (3) divide the quotient obtained in (2) by the relative size of the given insect: The number resulting by this division is called the relative sensi- tiveness of the given insect. Since it seems reasonable that as a general rule the sizes of two hymenopterous insects are proportional to the respective diameters of their femurs at the extreme proximal ends, the femur of the hind leg of each prepared specimen was measured with the aid of a camera lucida. These measurements may be called the relative sizes of the insects and the diameter of the extreme proximal end of the femur belonging to Microgaster may be called 1.00, as a standard by which to calculate the diameters of the other femurs. It was thus ascer-</page><page sequence="34">19,14.1 NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 327 tained that the relative sizes of a few of the specimens were less than 1.00, while most of them were greater than 1.00. A study of the anatomy of the pores shows that the diameters of the peripheral sense fibers are proportional to the diameters of the flasks. Of course, the greater the diameters of the peripheral sense fibers, the more cytoplasm is exposed to the external air. The diameters of the ends of the sense fibers cannot be measured, but the diameters of the flasks can be accurately measured. To facilitate matters, the largest pore on the femur of the leg measured and the largest one on the front wing of each individual insect were drawn with the aid of a camera lucida. Figures 43 to 79 represent these pores. The larger pore in each case is from the femur and the smaller one is from the front wing. For our purpose each pore may be regarded as a circle having for its diameter the shorter diameter of the pore as shown in the' drawings. To obtain the relative sensi- tiveness of all the pores on the legs of a given insect, the diameter of the largest pore on the femur, the total number of pores on the legs and the relative size of the given insect were used. To obtain the relative sensitiveness of all the pores on the legs and wings combined, the diameters of bqth pores, the grand total number of pores, and the relative size of the given insect were used. By this system of calculating it was determined that Cimbex with its 1,216 pores smells 0.87 times as well as Microgaster which has only 622 pores, and only 0.85 times as well as the smallest ant with 463 pores. In speaking of the relative sensitiveness obtained by this system of calculating, a large probable error must always be allowed and the figures only approximately represent the truth. Allowing for the probable error, all the winged individuals, except three, placed between Cimbex a-nd Ceropales in the table seem to have the olfactory sense about equally developed. The three exceptions are the ichneumon-fly (Megarhyssa), the female ant of Aphaenogaster, and the male ant of Camponotus, all three of which seem to smell slightly better than the others. The males of Campo- notus probably smell slightly better than the females of the same genus and considerably better than the winged forms of Formica. The small workers of Camponotus seem to smell slightly better than their large sisters and considerably better than the large workers of Formica and of C. mela. According to the reaction times obtained in determining the relative sensitiveness to odors of ants, the males of Camponotus receive odor stimuli considerably better than the workers and females of the same genus, but about as well as do the</page><page sequence="35">328 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Apr., winged forms of Formica. The quicker reaction time of Formica is probably due to the fact that Formica is more agile than Camponotus. Based on reaction times, the small workers of Camponotus smell slightly better than their large sisters. Judging from the total number of pores, the winged forms of any species of ants smell considerably better than the workers of the same species. Among the wasps the relative sensitiveness is tolerably well graduated from the lowest to the highest species as listed in the table. Instead of the two social wasps, Polistes and Vespula, having the highest relative sensitiveness, they seem to take second place, while the first place is held by the guest wasp, Pseudomasaris, and the solitary wasp, Monobia. Among the bees the relative sensitiveness is also tolerably well graduated from Andrena, the lowest examined, to Apis, the highest. This system of calculating shows that the worker honey bee smells considerably better than the queen and equally as well as the drone. Reaction times show that drones smell slightly better than workers and considerably better than queens. It is thus seen that the honey bee has the most highly developed olfactory sense of the Hymenop- tera, while that of ants is considerably inferior. Based upon reaction times, the relative sensitiveness to odors of insects depends not only upon their ability to receive odor stimuli, but also upon their agility and sluggishness in responding when the olfactory organs are stimulated. To illustrate this point, the workers of Camponotus are more agile than the workers of Apis, and for this reason probably alone they respond more quickly to odors. Judging from only their reactioni times, the former smell better than the latter, but in all probability the reverse is the truth. The ability to receive odor stimuli depends upon the development of the entire nervous system, including the olfactory apparatus, and upon the physiological state of the insect being tested. At the mating time the winged females of ants certainly smell as well and probably much better than the workers of the same species. As long as the recextly fertilized females perform all duties necessary in bringing their first brood to maturity, they certainly retain almost the same degree of acuteness in smelling as before; but when they become a mere egg- laying machine and perform none of the nest duties, their ability to receive odor stimuli is probably less acute. It is thus seen that the physiological state is an important factor when the relative sensi- tiveness is considered, and we have little means of knowing just what physiological condition a given insect is in when it is being</page><page sequence="36">1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHlLADELPHIA. 329 tested. To decide definitely about the relative sensitiveness to odors of insects, it is, therefore, necessary to consider (1) the degree of agility or sluggishness in responding when stimulated; (2) the degree of development of the entire nervous system, including the olfactory apparatus; and (3) the physiological state or condition in which the insects are in when being tested.

Lehmann (1799) tries to analogize the spiracles of insects with the noses of vertebrates. Comparetti (1800) places the seat of smell in different parts for different families as follows: The club of the antennae in lamellicorn beetles, the proboscis in Lepidoptera and certain frontal cells in Orthoptera. Ramdohr (1811) mistakes the salivary glands in the head for the olfactory apparatus. Rosenthal (1811) regards a folded skin beneath the antennae as the seat of the olfactory organs. Huber (1814) considers the mouth cavity of the honey bee as the seat of olfaction. Treviranus (1816) thinks that the cesophagus is the seat of the olfactory apparatus. Kirby and Spence (1826) regard the rhinarium or, nostril-piece as the seat of the organs of smell. Burmeister (1836) considers that insects smell with what he calls the "internal superior surface." Paasch (1873) claims that a plate between the eyes and beneath the antennse is the seat of the olfactory organs. Wolff (1875) calls the hairlike organs on the epipharynx of the honey bee the olfactory apparatus. Joseph (1877) claims to have found an olfactory region near the spiracles which communicates with the tracheae. After having cut off the antennae of two male moths, Dugds (1838) says that the insects were unable to find a female that they had previously been able to locate while their antennse were intact.</page><page sequence="42">1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 335 Blow-flies with the antennae cut off fail to find putrid meat as before. Lefebvre (1838) experimented with bees and wasps with mutilated antennoe. He thinks that the olfactory organs are located at the extremities of the antennae. Perris (1850) says: (1) In amputating the extremity of the antennae the olfactory sense is not destroyed, but it is weakened, and by cutting them off at the base the sense of smell is totally or par- tially destroyed; (2) covering the antennae with a layer of india rubber renders these organs insensible; (3) sometimes a little sensi- bility is shown when the palpi are amputated. Cornalia (1856) experimented with mutilated male moths. He thinks that the seat of olfaction lies in both the antennae and palpi. Garnier (1860) denies that the antennae of Necrophagus are the seat of the olfactory organs, because these beetles returned imme- diately to the body of a mole from which they had been removed. Balbiani (1866) says that male butterflies with the antennae cut off fail to respond, as do unmutilated males, to females in any manner. Grimm (1869) after many experiments concludes that the antennae of beetles do not function as olfactory organs. Forel (1874, 1885) says that ants when deprived of their antennme cannot guide themselves and are not able to distinguish companions from enemies or to discover food placed at their sides. When deprived of the anterior part of the head and of the entire abdomen they preserve all their faculties. The same author (1878) found that a wasp with the anterior part of the head cut off responded to a needle dipped in honey, while a wasp with both antennae cut off failed to respond. Forel (1908) says that carrion-feeding beetles with the antenne cut off cannot find putrid meat as before the antennae are mutilated. Hauser (1880) studied the behavior of various insects before and after the removal of the antennae. When the antennae were cut off, many individuals soon became sick and died, although some of them lived thereafter for many days. In insects with their antennae dipped into melted paraffin, the behavior was similar to that of those with the antennae amputated. After performing many experiments with Philonthus ceneus, he concludes that these insects lose the olfactory sense by the removal of the antennae. Experiments with species of several other genera gave the same results, but those with beetles of the genera Carabus, Melolontha, and Silpha were less satisfactory. These never completely failed to respond to strong- smelling substances. Experiments with Hemiptera gave a still less</page><page sequence="43">336 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Apr., favorable result. After the loss of the antenna, these insects reacted almost as well as they did with their antennae intact. Porter (1883) thinks that the antennae of butterflies and some other insects have nothing to do with olfaction. Some insects are affected little, if at all, by the extirpation of the antennse, while others become very sick after the loss of these appendages. Graber (1885) contends that ants (Formica rufa) and flies (Lucilia cesar) and beetles (Silpha thoracica) without their antennae still possess the sense of smell. He is inclined to the view that insects do not have any special olfactory organ, and that when the odorifer- ous emanations are intense they may be perceived by the surfaces of the body which are covered with thin chitin and which are provided with terminal excitable nerves. Plateau (1886) says that in Blatta the antennw are the olfactory organs. Graber (1887) repeated Plateau's experiments by using many cockroaches, and declares that in these insects the antennie actually function as olfactory organs, but this is not true for all insects. Fielde (1901, 1903, 1907) claims that the eleventh or distal segment of the antennae of ants perceives the nest odor; the tenth segment, the colony odor; the ninth segment, the individual track; the eighth and seventh, the inert young; and the sixth and fifth, the odor of enemies. Miss Fielde clipped the antennae with sharp scissors, and 15 days after the operation about 40 per cent. of the ants recovered from the effect of the shock. "Before their recovery the ants were listless and abnormally irritable; and they attacked with self- destructive violence any moving thing that touched them. " She also found that queen ants deprived of their antennae did not behave normally. Barrows (1907) says that gum on the antenne of Drosophila ampelophila does not keep out odors, nor could the antennae be burnt off without considerable injury to the flies. He etherized some flies and cut off the terminal segment bearing sense cones with fine scissors, and he declares that the ether did not affect the results of the experiments with odors. He says: "It therefore seems certain that the sense of smell is absent, or at least greatly reduced in flies that have lost the terminal joints of the antenna. " Kellogg (1907) informs us that male silkworm moths with extir- pated antenn2a are unable to find the females unless by accident. From the foregoing it is seen that about one-fourth of all the writers who have experimented on insects with mutilated antennae</page><page sequence="44">1914.] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA. 337 assert that these appendages do not carry the olfactory organs. Most of the observers have failed to state whether or not the insects used were normal. The inactivity of most of their insects indicates abnormality. With Miss Fielde's ants, only 40 per cent. recovered from the effect of the shock, and in all probability all of these were more or less abnormal. The writer has found that when the antennae of ants, wasps, and bees are mutilated in the slightest degree the insects are always more or less abnormal in behavior. Hicks (1857, 1859, 1860) first discovered the organs called the olfactory pores in this paper on the halteres and on the bases of the wings of all Diptera examined; on the bases of all four wings of the four-winged tribes; on the trochanter and femur of all insects, and occasionally on the tibia. He examined many species representing various insect orders and found these pores even on the lower insects, such as the earwig. In such wingless insects as the worker and soldier ants, he infers that these pores are much more abundant on the legs than they are on these appendages in the winged insects. Hicks suggested an olfactory function for all of these pores, whether on the legs or wings, but he performed no experiments of any kind. His drawings represent only the superficial appearance of the pores. Janet (1904, 1907) found porelike sense organs in large numbers in all the ants that he examined. They occur on the mouth parts, legs, and he saw a few on the thorax at the base of the wing of a queen ant. His drawings of the superficial aspects of all these pores are very similar to those seen by the writer, but he has failed to under- stand the internal anatomy. He calls the chitinous cone an umbel, which is always separated from the surrounding chitin by a chamber. The chamber communicates with the exterior by means of a pore. The sense fiber, or his manubrium, runs into the umbel, -and he thinks that it spreads out over the inner surface of the umbel and does not open into the chamber. Thus the umbel forms a thin layer of chitin which separates the end of the sense fiber from the external air. In conclusion, it seems that the organs called the olfactory pores in this paper are the true olfactory apparatus in Hymenoptera and that the antennae play no part in receiving odor stimuli.</page><page sequence="45">338 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Apr., LITERATURE CITED.
