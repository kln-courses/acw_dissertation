<plain_text><page sequence="1">GERMAN SOCIAL THEORY AND THE HIDDEN FACE OF TECHNOLOGY In modern German social theory, the fascist interpretation of technology is an opaque and little-known subject. So much so, that the use of the term fascist to describe it is perhaps controversial. Nonetheless the attribute 'fascist' will be used, provisionally at least, to describe the writings of those German nationalist intellectuals who wrote on the topic—in particular Spengler (i), Schmitt (2), Heidegger (3) and Jünger. Of these, Jünger is the least well-known outside of Germany but for own purposes the most important. In 1932 he published his major philosophical work Der Arbeiter (4) which was to have a long, standing influence on the debate on technology within German social theory which has persisted through to the present day. The impact of Jünger's work is seen at its strongest, perhaps, in the famous book by Herbert Marcuse, a longstanding political opponent of fascism, written in the mid-sixties One-Dimensional Man. The work of Jünger clearly illustrates in its historical context a littleknown fact. During Hitler's rise to power and the death-throes of the Weimar Republic, a number of fascist intellectuals in Germany were attracted not by orthodox Nazi doctrines of racism, but by an image of nihilism which centred around the fascinations of modern technology. The strength of such nihilism, despite the historical transience of the fascination with technology, is remarkable. It persisted long after the Nazi regime put paid to any mistaken notions of the Third Reich becoming the birthplace of a new demonic technology and it is this persistence which has to be explained #. It might be fitting to start with the figure of Ernst Jünger, who unlike many fellow intellectuals, had been first and foremost a man of action. Jünger was a war-hero, wounded countless times in combat during the First World War while barely in his twenties, and eventually awarded the * Ernst Jünger, In Stahlengewitten [1922], in Werke I (Stuttgart 1962); Id.

His war memoirs, especially Storm of Steel (5), were best selling literature in Germany of the twenties and thirties. In them he presented a gospel of sacrifice and death built upon the formidable rock of personal experience in an elite storm battalion which underwent the most gruelling ordeal in a stalemate which was based upon firepower. For young middle-class German nationalists Jünger was something of a cult figure. But he did more than praise violence and brutality. He noted, with a degree of almost inhuman aloofness, the helplessness of soldiers before the mechanised fire-power and the intensive artillery barrages of a type of warfare never before experienced. This abiding impression of the destructive potential of modern military inventions is crucial to his formulation of a model of modern technology. Because of his personal experience he came to consider it as totally des tructive, a dynamic, volatile and at times uncontrollable force which raged like an inferno across the face of modern civilisation. His perverse and ecstatic pessimism made him reject the notion of technology as an integral part of historial progress. For this reason he repudiated the mechanistic and materialistic interpretations of technology characteristic of nineteenth century thought and rejected without reservations the varied optimistic formulae of Saint-Simon, Spencer and Marx. All these interpretations would have been regarded by Jünger as variants of the Western idea of progress which he despised. Like many fascist thinkers, he saw both marxism and liberalism as compatible variants of this same idea of progress which had originated in the French enlightenment. His attack was com plemented by a little known essay on technology by Carl Schmitt, the legal and political theorist, who became a Nazi in 1933, and who in the early thirties was a close friend and associate of Jünger. Schmitt attacked the previous generation of German writers who had lived through the Wilhel mian era and the First World War and became increasingly disillusioned with the rationalisation of modern life (6). Prominent among them were Max Weber, Ernst Tröltsch and Walter Rathenau. They were linked by a common concern that rationalisation involved, in Weber's words, "the radical disenchantment of the world", and would create a soulless mechanical form of existence from which all spiritual and irrational forms of culture would be excluded. According to Schmitt however, this was true not of technological rationalisation as a whole but merely of that carried out in the liberal societies of the West under the ideological banner of progress. There was an important link between technology and spirit which made the pathos of anguished distinctions between the organic world of man and nature and the mechanical world of technology totally redundant. The spirit of technology which has led to the mass adulation of an antireligious this-worldy activism is spirit, perhaps a more evil and satanic spirit, but not to be dismissed as mechanistic and not to be attributed to technology. It is perhaps (5) JÜNGER, In Stahlengewittern, op. cit. (6) Schmitt, op. cit. p. 80. 3i3</page><page sequence="3">JOHN ORR somewhat terrifying, but not itself technical or machine-like. It is the belief in an activistic metaphysic, the belief in the limitless power and domination of men over nature, even over the human physis, in the unlimited recession of natural boundaries, in unlimited possibilities for transforming the naturally constituted existences of men. One can call this fantastic or demonic, but not simply dead spiritless, mechan ised soullessness (7). This definitive statement by Schmitt sets the tone for Jünger's larger opus Der Arbeiter published two years later, only a few months before Hitler's assumption of power (8). The sub-title of Jünger's book was Herrschaft und Gestalt and 'Herrschaft' refers to the same domination by technology of man and nature as suggested by Schmitt in the passage above (9). Moreover it accepts the basic premises of Schmitt's repudiation of Weber, namely that rationalisation does not mean the end of ideology or the end of metaphysics. Jünger accepted the most extreme process of rationalisation outlined by Weber as inevitable. He saw the central significant feature of modern technology as being "the permanence of means" (Konstanz der Mittel). Unlike Weber, however, he did not locate this rationalisation largely within the workings of Western capitalism. His anti-liberalist position made him reject Western bourgeois society as decadent and he saw the nineteenth century, from a very Prussian standpoint, as an age of 'pseudo-domination' (Scheinherrschaft) (10). The result is that his critique of bourgeois society is almost vapid. He rejects the notion of social class and class antagonism on the flimsiest of pretexts and substitutes the idea of bourgeois society as a society of masses. Hence he was one of the chief forerunners of the idea of "mass society" and his account of its decadence is inundated with "molecular imagery". The bourgeois citizen is an atomised individual, effete, narcotic, with an indulgence for whimsical forms of social discussion and social protest. The only real opposition to this whimsical extravagance came, in Jünger's eyes, from the criminal elements of the Lumpenproletariat whose amoral brutality provided an example for behaviour in a new "worker's state" based upon technology (11). In fact Jünger's "new man" is not very different from the Nazi stormtroopers of the period. Half combat veteran, half criminal, his attitudes are based on a doctrine of "heroic realism" which (7) Ibid. p. 93. (8) In October of 1932. (9) As a disciple of Nietzsche, Jünger envisaged the 'impact' (Prägung) of tech nology on the world in terms of the "will-to power" and the "eternal recurrence" of all cosmic energy. Instead of the term "will-to-power" however, he used the Weberian term 'legitimation' to emphasise the importance of Herrschaft as a mode of ensuring the obedience of commands. At his most extreme, he suggests that "domi nation and obedience (Dienst) are one and the same thing". Jünger, Der Arbeiter, op. cit. p. 13. (10) Nietzsche's most important condemnations of bourgeois society are to be found in The Genealogy of Morals, The Will-to-Power and The Antichrist. For a national-bolshevik assessment of Nietzsche as the most profound critic of "bourgeois decadence", see the study by one of Jünger's close associates, the Leipzig philosophy teacher Hugo Fischer, Nietzsche Apostata (Leipzig 1931), pp. 15 sq., 108 sqq. (11) Jünger, Der Arbeiter y p. 21 sq. 3H</page><page sequence="4">THE HIDDEN FACE OF TECHNOLOGY involved "fighting for fighting's sake" whatever the hopelessness of the situation or whatever the pain or personal sacrifice (12). Jünger's account of technology in his new "worker's state" is less empty than his dismissal of bourgeois society for several reasons. The first is that it involves the synchronisation of two historical events—the Great War and the process of forced industrialisation in the Soviet Union. The second is that it hinges on a philosophically complex notion of technology. To take the latter first, Jünger claimed that Germany could only defeat the West in any future war by what he called a "total mobilisation" of all its productive resources (13). But he claimed that this process could only be inspired initially by ideological means. Some alternative was necessary in Germany to the ideological instrument of the West—the idea of progress. At first he accepted the term "heroic realism" as the attitudinal characteristic necessary for total mobilisation, but later he went further than this. For Jünger, men have to be made "technology-conscious", in the same way as, in nineteenth-century socialism, propaganda was oriented to making workers "class-conscious". He claims therefore that technology must be mobilised through what he calls the "Gestalt of the worker". Now Gestalt means literally 'figure' or 'shape'. But Jünger's use of it is much closer to the Gestalt school of psychology in Berlin at that time than to any ordinary usage. He regards it as a holistic device for creating a new way of perceiving the real world. But it is also a tactical device to prevent any alternative form of perception. "By Gestalt we refer to the highest mean ingful reality. Its appearances are meaningful as symbols, representations and impressions of this reality. The Gestalt is the whole which embraces more than the sum of its parts. This 'more' we call totality [...]. From the moment in which one begins to experience things in terms of a Gestalt, everything becomes Gestalt" (14). On the basis of this remarkable definition, it seems appropriate to call the theorists we are considering as the Gestalt school of technology. For Jünger Gestalt had no moral or psychological connotations. It lays, rather cynically perhaps, in the realm of a tactical epistemology. It was a means of forcing men into an acceptance of certain forms of knowledge without regard for their validity. Nonetheless it was the original statement of a Gestalt technology which is to be found among others in the work of Martin Heidegger, Herbert Marcuse and Jürger Habermas. But what was Jünger's purpose in using a holistic model of perception in this way ? There were several. It enabled him in the first instance to attack evolutionism, histo ricism and all forms of historical causality. But more important it enabled (i2) The term "heroic realism" was first coined by a young disciple of Jünger, Werner Best, a lawyer who went on to become one of the leaders in the Gestapo and until 1939 was effectively Reinhold Heydrich's right-hand man.

Of the nature of work, Jünger writes the following: "Work is the tempo of the hand, of the head, of the heart, of life by day and night, of science, art, belief, worship and war. Work is the vibration of atoms and energy set in motion by the stars and the solar system" (15). This cosmological vision of work, which is meant by Jünger to give the worker a universalistic status, clearly does not stop short at an empirical definition of work as rationally calculated productive activity or the like. Rather it conceives of work as energos, to use the Greek term, as the manifestation of energy in the universe which involve man himself. Human work as energy is the contribution to the continuous interplay of forms of cosmic energy. The concept 'work' conflates human activity and natural energy. The conflation is sealed at the point where they intersect, i.e. through technology, which is the application of man made techniques to the use and harnessing of natural energy. While Jünger was obviously influenced here by the currents of vitalism floating around in German biology, and almost possibly by Henri Bergson's notion of an élan vital underlying all living forces, he is even more indebted to the controversies within modern atomic physics over the ultimate constituents of the universe. In fact he incorporates into his definition of work the view that energy rather than matter is at the basis of the universe, and shows contempt for the excessively materialistic conceptions of work in nineteenth-century thinking. The direction of this thinking is anti-humanist and metaphysical. He seeks through the conception of work as energy to depreciate the uniqueness of human life. The merger of human and natural energies is to the detriment rather than the ennoblement of mankind. Technology retains an over whelming imagery of destructiveness. Its domination of man and nature involves pillage, rapine, pollution, sacrifice and death. Jünger dismisses the sacredness of individual life and claims that the death of individuals is no loss to the collectivity of workers. The worker is a collective 'type' and hence diminution through death has a purely numerical significance (16). Jünger also attempts to reify all purely instrumental aspects of productivity and organisation into symbolic attributes of work. The concept used to designate pure instrumentality in organisation or production, that of 'efficiency' (Leistung) he calls "an objective and factual symbol of the worker's Gestalt" (17). Likewise, machine-technology is purely symbolic. It provides the worker with "the ritual forms of an alien cult". As a mass-produced type, the worker is no better than a cipher, performing mathematically calculable actions. But his relation to his Gestalt, according to Jünger, is that "of mathematics to metaphysics". Thus there is no rational kernel to technological rationality. The latter merely refers to (15) Der Arbeiter. (16) Ibid. pp. 120 sq. (i7) Ibid. p. 147. 3i6</page><page sequence="6">THE HIDDEN FACE OF TECHNOLOGY the gratuitous, arbitrary and recurrent utilisation of indeterminate quanta of natural and human energy. The language of technique is part of what he calls the "revolutionary legitimation" of work. "Technology is the domination of a language which is valid in the domains of work. This language is no less meaningful, no less profound, than that other sort which belongs not only to grammar but also to metaphysics. Here the machine just as much as man himself plays a secondary role. It is only the organ through which this language will be spoken" (18). The comparison between technology and language is a very appropriate one. For modern linguists have ascribed to the nature of language identical features as those seen by Jünger in modern technology. In the same way that Jünger saw technical and scientific rationality as operating with indeterminate quanta of energy, many modern linguists claim that determinate linguistic structures are derived from the arbitrary nature of signs. The Gestalt is totally mythic. Its mythic significance is made clear in the following passage where Jünger claims that the Gestalt lies beyond any attempt to explain human nature by concepts which refer to human qualities: "A Gestalt cannot in the usual sense of the word be described [...]. Insofar as it is to be sought beyond the will and beyond history [Entwicklung] it is also to be sought beyond values. It possesses no quality" (19). This, in effect, generates a rather amazing paradox. Technology means the domination of a language whose symbolism is derived from the rationalistic attributes of work. But that domination is maintained by a totality deprived of any signifying quality whatsoever, namely the Gestalt. This being the case, language in its ordinary sense is redundant. Bereft of will and bereft of values, the worker relies in his work-performance on his purely "existential being". What characterises this existential being ? The fact that his performance or achievement is "an achievement without any conceptual attributes, so that in a very cogent sense, the worker is a supporter of a revolution sans phrase" (20). At its crudest possible level this could be seen as an exhortation to the effect that action speaks louder than words. But Jünger is claiming more than this. For him, men are only truly machines when they are dominated by a language belonging to metaphysics, to the exclusion of any other forms of language which, since all men are now performing machines, become totally redund ant. Tactically speaking, the worker's mythic Gestalt is supposed to overcome the alleged contradictions of bourgeois society—the contra dictions between law and power, between good and evil, between sex and love, between state and society and between the organic and the mechanical world. In Jünger's eyes it presides over the transition from a decadent liberal society to a new worker's state based upon technology. (18) Ibid. p. 150. (19) Jünger, op. cit. p. 80. (20) Ibid. p. 79. 3*7</page><page sequence="7">JOHN ORR II To dispel the impression that Jiinger's vision of a modern inferno was purely imaginative and fictional like that of H.G. Wells, or to use his own example, Breughel and Bosch transposed to the industrial landscape, it is necessary to turn to another historical event of great importance which im pressed him almost as much as his combat-experience. This was the process of forced industrialisation in Russia through the five-year plans. Schmitt had claimed in his essay on technology that "we live under the eyes of Russia" (21). The type of work which Jünger claimed to admire was the forced labour of the Siberian prison camps. Just as he found it difficult to conceal his enthusiasm for violence and destruction, he found it difficult to conceal his elation at the greyest and grimmest aspects of Russian life under Stalin. In fact his attraction to Russia spelt the end of his rather wary and unofficial support for the newly emerging Nazi party at the end of the twenties. The more popular the Nazis became, the more Prussian and aloof Jünger became. He detested the mass demagogery, the mass enthusiasm and the electioneering so crucial to the Nazi strategy for the seizure of power. In contrast the Soviet Union seemed more suitably ruthless and ascetic, and the Communist party much more than the Nazis seemed willing to make their subjects the sacrifical victims of technology. This led Jünger to conveniently ignore what he called "the tedious dialogue between party secretaries" and look upon bolshevism not from a Marxist viewpoint or indeed from the viewpoint of the Party at all, but from the viewpoint of coercive centralised planning where technology rather than the class-struggle was the opium of the people. Ernst Niekisch, the leader of the small political sect of National-Bolsheviks in Germany and a close friend of Jünger's, gave a rapturous account of a visit to Russia in 1933 in a language straight out of The Worker. Russia was "a worker's state" characterised by asceticism and poverty, and the Russian worker was a "new type" who found "in the rhythm of the machine the basis for fusing the mechanised world of industry with the living organism of the state" (22). Just as Jünger had called for the obliteration of the distinction between town and country through state planning, Niekisch saw in the liquidation of the Kulaks a situation in which "the city controlled the land just as technology controlled nature". In addition he extolled "production figures, performance-schedules [...] work-gangs and the Kol kholz, the ikons and the holy scriptures" of the Soviet State. Jünger himself saw the ideological stress on work in Soviet Russia as intrinsic to the creation of the sacrificial victims of industrialisation. The political purge was a form of selection which aided the creation of a worker aristocracy, a ruling race based upon the glories of achievement. The (zi) Schmitt , op. cit. p. 79.

At the level of planning it appears totally determinate and necessary, but since work was universal, almost cosmological, the definition of what constituted it could remain conveniently arbitrary. Official statements on the need for continued vigilance and elimination of parasitic subversion were suffi ciently general for party officials and commissars, as well as the secret police, to make their own interpretations. Equally, as Jünger appreciated, the interpreters and liquidators were not those most immune to the weapons they used, but were themselves the most vulnerable. Thus the very official, a state planning commissar who wrote this very Jüngerian foreword to the official publication of the second five-year plan, was soon afterwards himself liquidated. He claimed: "Owing to the defeat of the parasitic classes, the Soviet Union has become a country where everybody works, where the possibility of parasitic existence has been completely and finally eradicated" (23). He presumably forgot to add "including mine". Another example would be the Party leader who did so much to encourage national bolshevism in Germany, Karl Radek. Radek, who admired Jünger's writings, was one of the most militant supporters of forced industrialisation and its social darwinian consequences. In particular he attacked the pro fessions and the Russian natural scientists for their failure to live up to the demands of the new socialism. But Radek, alas, soon became one of the new socialism's important victims in the first phases of Stalin's rule. Those who live by the purge, perish by the purge (24). The adulation of the national-bolsheviks for the Soviet Union was encouraged by the German Communist party but in some ways it was rather embarrassing. The national-bolsheviks admired those very features of Stalinism which the Soviet regime was so desperately trying to conceal from its distinguished supporters in the West and the visiting intellectuals such as the Webbs and G.B. Shaw, who were full of nothing but myopic praise. Although Jünger was not interested in any sort of 'socialism', he did share a common illusion with other fellow-admirers in the West— namely that the Soviet Union was displaying the most advanced use of technology and industrialisation yet to be seen in the world. The fact was of course that it was undergoing in a very different manner a process of industrialisation already accomplished by most countries in Western Europe. The idea that Germany should follow Russia's example in this respect conveniently ignored the fact that Germany was a much more advanced industrial nation with vastly superior industrial techniques. The idea touted around by the national-bolshevik s of a Russo-German condomi nium was based on the erroneous assumption that the Soviet Union was the pace-setter in modern technology whose example Germany could follow.

Jünger withdrew from politics and Niekisch was arrested and imprisoned in a concentration camp, although by this time he had been converted to orthodox Marxism anyway. But despite the collapse of national-bolshevism after 1933, there were those within the Nazi party who were influenced by Jüng er. It was all too easy, given Jünger's position, to quote a leading socialist critic, as "the indisputable intellectual leader of young German nation alism" to associate him with Nazism, despite his disenchantment with it. In fact the lack of any clear-cut Nazi ideology encouraged many to search for Nazi doctrine among the varied intellectual polemics at the time, both within and outside the movement. Once such person was Hermann Rausch ning, a Nazi party leader in Danzig, and later to become one of Nazism's bitterest opponents. Rauschning discovered Hitler's political attitudes to national-bolshevism not through Nazi publicity but through his direct personal conversations with the Führer. In the course of these conver sations Hitler dismissed those who wanted "a supranational worker's state with production plans and production districts" as "a literary clique which had lost all its sound instincts" (25). This did not prevent him giving his assent in 1932 for a plan by Göbbels to recruit Jünger and Niekisch to the party (26), but it was clear that this was for tactical reasons of prestige rather than ideological ones. Despite several meetings with Jünger, Göbbels was unsuccessful. The liaison ended bitterly when Jünger walked out on one of Göbbel's pretentious attempts at intellectual oratory. He was confirmed in his opinion that the Nazis were a bunch of plebian upstarts. But Jünger's work did produce one or two celebrated cases of mistaken identity among those who saw him as a Nazi writer. The most amazing concerned the famous philosopher Martin Heidegger, whose major work Being and Time had been published in 1927. Until 1933 Heidegger had completely steered clear of politics, but suddenly, to the astonishment of many of his academic contemporaries, joined the party and as Rector of Freiberg found himself an unwilling accomplice of the Nazi Gleichschaltung of the German universities. What had caused Heidegger's sudden enthus iasm for Nazism? Karl Löwith has suggested quite convincingly that Heidegger's decision in favour of political engagement was consistent with the philosophy of Being and Time (27). It was a resolution at a decisive moment in the free movement of man (25) Hermann Rausching, Hitler Speaks (London 1939), p. 136. (26) See Niekisch, op. cit. p. 238 sqq. (27) "In 1933, when a decisive moment was present in Germany, Heidegger became decisively engaged in a world-historical situation. He took over the leadership of Freiberg University and equated the Dasein of Being and Time with the 'German* Dasein. This political 'engagement* in the factual events of the time, which is of late continually referred to as "the atomic age", was not a deviation from Being and Time as the naive suppose. It was a conse quence of Heidegger's concept of human Dasein as a temporal and historical existence that only recognises temporal truths relative to its own Dasein and its potential being". Karl Löwith, Nature, History and Existen tialism (Evanston 1966), p. 76. 32°</page><page sequence="10">THE HIDDEN FACE OF TECHNOLOGY towards death. But it tells us nothing about why Heidegger chose Nazism as opposed to any other political creed, and similar existential justifications were later made by French philosophers including Jean-Paul Sartre for partisan resistance against Nazism. Were there any other motives ? In a study of Heidegger's political writings J.-M. Palmier has claimed that the publication of The Worker was the major intellectual factor in Heidegger's about-face (28). While it is excessive to claim, as Palmier has done, that this is the key to Heidegger's conversion to Nazism, nonetheless the theme of work is central to Heidegger's writings, and distinctly new. During his brief period as Rectorat Freiberg his speeches and articles for the University student newspaper show his obsession with a universalistic concept of work which is distinctly Jüngerian in nature. Now Jiinger's earlier emphasis on combat as a way of life was very similar to the utterances of the more orthodox and servile Nazi spokesmen in the universities such as Baumler, a friend of Jünger and Krieck. They spoke of creating a "new intellectual soldierdom" and "a spiritual S.A." in the groves of academe (29). But it was Heidegger alone who advocated 'work' as the means to ending the liberal idea of academic freedom and destroying the "intellectual autonomy" of the "refined academic". For Heidegger, intellectual work was authentic only insofar as it was "inseparable from all other forms of human work and accordingly assailed by the harshness of the dangers of human existence" (30). Work meant proximity to danger which the universities in their academic isolation lacked. For this reason he encouraged his students to participate in the then voluntary labour camps being set up by the Nazis, and to prove themselves by organising "their whole existence in a simpler, harsher and more ascetic manner than any of their comrades". Finally Heidegger envisaged a single "living-class" in Germany which he called "the work-class" (Arbeitsstand), which would be rooted in the state and the traditions of the German people and moulded by the Nazi party (31). For he took very seriously the literal claim of the Nazis to be a "German workers' party", viewing it in the light of Jünger's more bolshevik conception of work. But it was not to be so for long. Heidegger's attraction to Nazism lasted for no more than a year and he was repelled by its anti-semitic policies and general racist orientation. He retired from active politics and became regarded as officially suspect. While he was never dismissed from his teaching post, his attempt in 1939 to conduct a series of lectures on The Worker was stopped at an official level, and he no longer made any attempt to use material that was controversial. But neither, on the other hand, did he try to oppose Nazism after his disenchantment with it. Although Heidegger had mistakenly identified Jünger with Nazism (28) Jean-Michel Palmier, Les écrits politiques de Heidegger (Paris 1968).

Hermann Rauschning has provided ample evidence of the serious reception accorded to Jünger's work among party leaders in East Prussia. And in his major attack on Nazism in the thirties The Revolution of Nihilism (32), a book read widely in Western intellectual circles, Rauschning claims that national-bolshevism was at the heart of "a second revolution" within Nazism itself. How did he envisage this second revolution ? Underestimating the importance of the racial basis of Nazi doctrine and sentiment, which he saw as an Aus trian importation, Rauschning saw "the second phase of the revolution" after the seizure of power as the most distinctive aspect of the "revolution of nihilism". He imagined that through total mobilisation, Germany would be transformed into a totalitarian worker's state, and he saw Jünger's vision of the "new worker" as becoming an increasingly attractive idea among the new generation in Germany. Rauschning wrote: "Ernst Juenger's great vision of the Gestalt of the worker is winning growing support among Nazi youth as well as the youth who no longer support the national-socialists, in the army and the young intelligentsia, in the professions responsible for the brainwork of technology, even in the S.S. right inside the narrowest circle of party fanatics [...]" (33). Among his own circle of acquaintances, Rauschning had met several young army officers and technocrats to whom Jünger's vision of the global dominion of technology provided an immense attraction. In his own region, Nazi politics was dominated by Gauleiter Erich Koch, who saw East Prussia as the spearhead of a new advance into Russian which would result in the creation of a new technological world empire. Koch had set up an institute at the University of Königsberg with party approval, which, under the guidance of a young professor of economics, was to devote itself to the planning of technology in such an empire, to draw the blueprints of what Jünger had called "the planned landscapes" of the future (34). It was only several years later that Hitler's true intentions in invading the East—the destruction of bolshevism, the liquidation of Jewry, and the subjugation of the Slavs was fully realised. Koch, who was in charge of the Ukraine which he ran as a slave state, was involved in a rather different kind of slaughter than he had previously envisaged. Nonetheless, it had become clear that Jünger was an influential writer, and there was, for that reason, some basis for the erroneous identification of his own work with Nazism, especially in the thirties before the truly racialist character of national-socialism had fully revealed itself. The error hinged on the assumption that any successful fascist movement had to possess somewhere a fully developed ideology of its own. With Nazism this was not the case.

This became true also of the view of Nazism sustained by many of its more academic left-wing opponents. In particular the Frankfurt School of Sociology which had fled to exile in Paris. As M. Jay has shown in his recent study (35), the contribution of the Frankfurt School, first in Germany and later in Paris and New York, to the develop ment of Western social thought had been both rich and diverse. Their immediate interpretation of fascism however was excessively idealist. Like G. Lukads in his notorious post-war treatise The Destruction of Reason (36), they tended to attribute to Nazism the destruction of a whole intellectual heritage in European culture, but also to see it as the fruition and culmination of philosophical irrationalism in German thought and more generally in European intellectual life. In the Frankfurt school the attack was con ducted by its two chief theoreticians, Max Horkheimer and Herbert Marcuse. The form of attack upon fascism was two-pronged. Firstly it was seen as a political response to the 'crises' of 'monopoly-capitalism'. But Horkheimer and Marcuse were not economists and their notion of monopoly capitalism tended to be crude reductionist, and bereft of any historical context. Although such a view may have received some support from the writings of Franz Neumann, it lacked economic substance (37). The other prong of the attack came from the greater accessibility of fascist intellectuals and their predecessors to theoretical argument, than any of the fascist political regimes themselves. Having crudely postulated fascism as a 'function' of monopoly capitalism, it was possible to get down to the serious business of discussing its emergence out of the malaise of European philosophy. Marcuse claimed in an essay written for the Zeitschrift für Sozialforschung soon after the Nazi seizure of power, that the new fascist "world-view is a great reservoir for all the currents that have been deluging 'liberalist' politi cal and social theory since World War I" (38). In a way this was a bit of ideological tit-for-tat. Schmitt and Jünger had regarded most Marxists as lackeys of liberalism. Marcuse retorted by saying the same of the fascists. Yet the truth of the matter was that both Marxist and fascist intellectuals were avowed enemies of liberalism and bourgeois society. The ideological clash between them was over the question of their relative immunity from bourgeois-liberal seduction. Although Marcuse argues that fascist ideol ogy is an attempt to steer capitalism through its worst crises, his argument never gets off the ground simply because of the spareness of the evidence and the mundane comparative factors which tend to make mince meat of such an extravagent generalisation. In the first place fascism was (35) Martin Jay, The Dialectical Imagi nation (London 1973). (36) Georg Lukaés, Die Zerstörung der Vernunft (Berlin 1955). (37) Neumann's classic work Behemoth was never fully accepted by the leading spokesmen of the Frankfurt School as a real expression of the Institute's views. On the difference between the Horkheimer circle and the Neumann circle over the role of the economy in the interpretation of Nazism, see Jay, op. cit. pp. 158-167.

I, p. 3. 323</page><page sequence="13">JOHN ORR distinctly unsuccessful as a political movement in capitalist industrial nations such as Britain and the U.S. which also experienced economic crisis, and in the second place it was successful in traditional rural European societies which were in no economic position to experience the crises of advanced capitalism anyway. The significant feature of his essay therefore lies in his interpretation of fascist ideology, which lies heavily if not exclusively on the German experience. For what, according to Marcuse, was "the world-view" of fascism ? He writes "the establishment of the total-authori tarian state [meaning the Third Reich] was accompanied by the annuncia tion of a new political world-view; heroic-völkisch realism became the governing theory [...] " (39). The statement collapses two vital distinctions in German right-wing polemics. The first is the traditional conservative notion of an "authori tarian state" favoured by many neo-conservatives, and the idea of a "total state" outlined by Carl Schmitt in his essay The Concept of the Political. In actual fact, both terms were rejected by the Nazi regime and although the idea of a total state was first received favourably by many fascist intel lectuals it was rejected as too statist by official spokesmen for the regime who preferred to speak in terms of a racial "people's community". Schmitt in his Nazi period was in fact forced to abandon his own concept. The second is heroic-völkisch realism. It joins together the idea of the Volk as the racially pure Germanic people, with the attitudinal complex of heroic realism outlined by Jünger in his work on total mobilisation and technology. Horkheimer also claimed that heroic realism was the core of fascist doctrine. But to say it was "the governing theory" is distinctly false. The term was never used after 1933 by official Nazi spokesman and most ordinary party members would never even have heard of it. The point was that in the eyes of the Frankfurt School it was the closest theoreti cal approximation to Nazism. And an approximation of this sort became necessary because in official Nazi literature at the time there was nothing with the same scholastic resonance which could be seized upon at all. None theless the conception of the governing theory of fascism as that of heroic realism lead in an all too familiar direction—the direction of technology. Marcuse had quite clearly seen the links between Schmitt, Heidegger and Jünger in their common usage of existentialist vocabulary and he delivered a very biting attack upon the doctrine of existentialism as the immediate forerunner of heroic realism. But it was in Gestalt technology that Marcuse found the most developed formula for fascism and later for the totalitarianism which he claims exists in all advanced industrial societies. Horkheimer set the tone for this promethean struggle with Gestalt technology by noting its connections with philosophical irrationalism. According to Horkheimer the vitalistic doctrines of life promoted by Nietzsche and Bergson had paved the way for Spengler and Jünger's clear identification of irrationalism and technology. In the work of the latter writers, he claimed, "reason and (39) Marcuse op. cit. 324</page><page sequence="14">THE HIDDEN FACE OF TECHNOLOGY technology unite above all under the concept of sacrifice. The ethos of work which incorporates this positive relation to rational powers is itself irrational" (40). Moreover, he cites with approval Jünger's contention that "technology is of cultic origin which has unique symbols at its disposal and behind whose operation a power-struggle between Gestalts is con cealed" (41). Yet the emphasis on technology leads to a rather misleading interpretation of developments in the Third Reich similar to the false assumptions made by Rauschning. For Hitler's policy for re-armament in Germany was a policy of guns and butter. He hoped to keep the morale of the German population high by maintaining living standards even after the outbreak of war in 1939 (42). The result was that Germany was not totally mobilised for World War until 1943 when the war was already lost for her. The Allied Powers on the other hand, having made hardly any preparations for major war prior to 1939, were nonetheless able to effect total mobilisation in a very short period of time and generally demanded greater hardships of their civilian populations. In fact Jünger's hunch that the Nazis were unlikely to create the conditions for total mobilisation proved to be correct, and Hitler's idea of a short-term Blitzkrieg was a distinct military contrast to Jünger's ideas of preparation for indefinite war, which was also favoured by many of Hitler's Prussian Army Generals. Yet Marcuse's early critique of the Third Reich is, in part, an attempt to explain fascism in terms of Jünger's blueprint for total mobilisation. As early as 1937, he argued that Germany had already undergone the process of total mobilisation and that this was the chief distinguishing characteristic of fascism in practice (43). Jünger's demand for total mobilisation as a means for the final abolition of art and human individualism Marcuse saw as being incorporated into the actual policies of the Third Reich. Yet as history was to show, although total mobilisation in times of war invariably demands curtailment of human liberties, it was possible for the Nazi regime to liquidate contemporary art and destroy individual freedoms prior to total mobilisation, and it was equally possible for the Western democracies to change over to total mobili sation without abolishing art or fundamentally damaging civil liberties. Another important factor should not be overlooked. The theoretical model of fascism which Marcuse had adapted from fascist doctrine and Gestalt technology was partly based on Jünger's admiration for the uses of tech nology not in Nazi Germany but in the oviet Union. Embedded in Mar cuse's idea of fascism, therefore, is a rather precious and esoteric interpre (40) Max Horkheimer, Zum Rationa lismusstreit in der Gegenwärtigen Philoso phie, Zeitschrift für Sozialforschung, III (1934), PP- 42 sq.

This becomes clearly absurd when Marcuse resorts to his other explanation of fascism as the politics of monopoly capitalism. For the substantial economic notions to flesh out monopoly capitalism are derived via Jünger from forced industrialisation in the Soviet Union. It is only one step away from regarding the monopoly capitalist par excellence as Joseph Stalin. Ill In the early thirties Marcuse had built up, with the aid of a fascist doctrine he despised, the basic components for his own vision of Gestalt technology, One-Dimensional Man. It was this book, along with Eros and Civilisation, which brought Marcuse out of semi-obscurity to become a figurehead on the New Left, and a codeword for radical protest. It was founded quite basically on the earlier primitive identifications of fascism, monopoly capitalism, totalitarianism and technology made before the second world war. In the post-war world dominated by the cold war between the super powers, fascism and totalitarianism are not j'ust German phenomena accord ing to Marcuse, but assume global proportions. Yet in this assumption there is a fundamental historical contradiction. The world was dominated by the two super-powers Russia and the United States who had triumphed together over the corpse of fascism. The global domination of the super powers through nuclear weapons was based upon the collapse of the Axis powers and hence of the predominant fascist political regimes in Europe and Asia. How could the victors themselves be designated as fascist, or at least containing the basic elements of fascism ? To read Marcuse is to have a feeling that the victorious powers in the Second World War were themselves contaminated by those they vanquished. But where historically is the source of contamination which Marcuse nowhere mentions ? It is the mobilisation for total war that was necessary to defeat fascism. It produced among other things the excessive civilian bombings of Leipzig and Dresden and the invention of the atomic bomb which was used so decisively at Hiro shima and Nagasaki. But even if one accepts the contamination argument it still implies logically that the end result is the lesser evil. For while it is possible to argue that with the Second World War both America and Russia became Imperial powers betraying their democratic and/or communist ideals respectively, it is true to say that without their total involvement Hitler would not have been defeated and that he would have turned Europe into a Nazi empire. These historically were the main choices. Logically therefore, Marcuse's vision of advanced industrial society as just about the worst of all possible worlds is incompatible with the acknowledgement that it became bad by defeating something worse than itself. A particular illustration of the dilemma involved in the fight against fascism, and one which Marcuse as a German émigré living in America and working for the O.S.S. (Organisation of Security Services) must have been 326</page><page sequence="16">THE HIDDEN FACE OF TECHNOLOGY well aware of, was the processing of the first atomic bomb. R. Jungk in his rather frightening book (44) shows that the decision by the major European émigré scientists working in America to make available to the American government the information that it would be possible to manufacture an atomic device was based upon the fear that the Nazi regime in Germany might already be in the process of developing such a bomb. This fear was proved unfounded, for despite the existance of brilliant physicists such as Werner Heisenberg and Carl von Weiszäcker in Germany, the Nazis did remarkably little to encourage official research into physics. It had deprived itself of some of Germany's best physicists, including Einstein, by forcing them to flee as unwanted Jews. Those who stayed behind and refused to acknowledge the supremacy of purely 'German' physics were referred by the official newpaper of the S.S. as "white jews" (45). The provincial Nazi attitude to science is comparable to the lack of foresight over total mobili sation. None of the Nazi leadership had any clue that atomic physics could possible provide destructive weapons of the first magnitude. But the exiles from fascism were not to know this. They knew that in 1938 chain reactions in uranium had been discovered by Otto Hahn, and although both Hahn and Heisenberg proclaimed in private they would do nothing to help manufacture bombs for Hitler, men such as Enrico Fermi, Leo Szilard and Edward Teller became worried at the status of German research which they radically overestimated (46). This fear which they communi cated to Einstein, and in which he shared, resulted in the inauguration of military atomic research in the United States whose eventual outcome was, against the wish of most of the scientists themselves, the use of atomic bombs as offensive weapons against Japan. The decision to inform the U.S. government and press for immediate research into atomic weapons was truly tragic as Einstein admitted because the Nazi atom bomb was completely chimerical. It seemed to Einstein, the pacifist, that evil had been created to destroy a greater evil which in fact did not even exist. After 1945 when many scientists and physicists naively believed that production of atomic weapons would be suspended, they found themselves helpless during the beginnings of the cold war to prevent the growing institutionali sation of a process they had helped to inaugurate in an attempt to defend democracy against fascism. The tragic predicament of nuclear science is firmly embedded in the scholastic gloom of One-Dimensional Man. Despite this, however, it is never explicitly mentioned. Yet the horror of technology which Marcuse seeks to convey, what Jünger had called "its abstract cruelty", has been stimulated more vividly than anything else in the last two decades by the weapons of nuclear war. If there is one experience in our own lifetime that the dreams of reason have turned into monsters, it is this. This helps (44) Robert Jungk, Heller als tausend Sonnen (Berne 1958).

(46) Ibid. pp. 82 sqq. 327</page><page sequence="17">JOHN ORR to explain the widespread popularity of Marcuse's book. But it also demonstrates its strange ambivalence. Nothing shows more clearly that Marcuse shared the fear of fascism possessed by Einstein and the German natural scientists than the dedication of his book to W. Benjamin who committed suicide in France in 1940 fearing that he had failed to escape from the Gestapo (47). Ben jamin, the talented literary critic of the Frankfurt group, was a victim of Nazi persecution. But his suicide no less than the actions of the scientists under Einstein was motivated by the fear of absolute evil. Yet this same motive, the fear of fascism, which was responsible for the development of the first atomic weapons, can only be interpreted, using Marcuse's argu ment, as a first step on the road to totalitarian ruin. In the absence of a historical explanation as to why the West developed into a 'totalitarian' society after 1945, one is reduced to speculation and psychological impu tation. Was Marcuse's accusation of fascism and totalitarianism against those who fought fascism a strange exorcism of his personal fears of fascism ? Did he then rationalise it as a political argument ? These questions seem almost unanswerable. What remains undeniable is that fascist doctrine was an intellectual influence on him, and his attempt to see in the West the same type of society as he saw in the Third Reich must be judged in the light of this evidence. Certainly the defeat of fascism ushered in a new era of military global domination for the two super-powers Russia and the United States. As early as 1932 Jünger had made a half-prophecy of this development. He wrote: "Technology as the means through which the Gestalt of the worker mobilised the world is world-revolutionary. Those who use this Gestalt establish themselves as world-revolutionary. The secret develop ment of scientific and military resources is directed towards the domination of continents from pole to pole. The altercation between different ways of life takes on the character of a world war" (48). But clairvoyant though this statement was, the Cold War failed to meet its most important condition. Atomic weapons had a deterrent effect upon conven tional warfare and drastically limited the possibility of a world war. Yet military defence against the eventuality of nuclear war was organised globally. It is this consideration which induced Marcuse to reproduce in 1964, in a language which is only slightly altered, Jünger's embryonic vision of the global domination of technology: "By virtue of the way in which it tends to organise its technological base, contemporary society tends to be totalitarian [...] technological rationality reveals its political character as it becomes the great vehicle of better domination, creating a truly totalitarian universe in which society and nature, mind and body are kept in a state of permanent mobilisation for the defence of this universe" (49).

(48) Jünger, op. cit. p. 217. (49) One-Dimensional Man, op. cit. p. 18. 328</page><page sequence="18">THE HIDDEN FACE OF TECHNOLOGY Marcuse is remarkable. If one substitutes the term 'totalitarian' for 'world-revolutionary' in Jiinger's paragraph—and indeed in his work, these two terms are practically interchangeable—the prognosis of the two writers is almost identical. Yet the fact is that, despite dealing with Jünger in his pre-war essays, Marcuse in One-Dimensional Man never even mentions him. Yet there is a key connection with Jünger which Marcuse provides indirectly. This is to be found in a passing but very crucial reference to Martin Heidegger. Heidegger, in two significant post-war essays, elaborated a fairly sophisti cated and at times obtuse philosophical treatment of Gestalt technology. As a professional philosopher his approach was more abstract and apolitical than that of Jünger. But his tribute written to Jünger in 1956, On the question of Being (50), made it clear that beneath the incessant and untrans latable neologisms of the Swabian philosopher, there lay the inspiration of The Worker. Heidegger's essay of 1952, "The Question of Technology", is almost a philosophical abstract of Gestalt theory (51). It made explicit the presupposition which was later to run through One-Dimensional Man, the presupposition that "the essence of technology is not itself technological". What did Heidegger mean by this ? He claimed that technology was a mode of being, which could not be properly conceived from a purely tech nical standpoint. According to Heidegger, technology operates as an Instru mentarium, but its instrumentality is not intrinsic to its nature. What lies behind this is the fact that it is a mode of unleashing natural energies. "Technology is a mode of unleashing (Entbergen). Only insofar as man, for his part, is initially provoked into provoking natural energy, can this arranged unleashing occur" (52). As a concrete example, he speaks of a hydro-electric plant built on the Rhine. The harnessing of energy by the plant entails that "the river is built into the plant" rather than vice versa. Thus the river is not merely a natural phenomenon but "a purveyor of hydrostatic pressure" (53). All natural and man-made objects contribute in a technological age to the unleashing of energy, a situation which makes the contemporary world invariably fraught with a danger which confronts men unmercifully. And this, according to Heidegger, is not in itself technological. Heidegger's idea is incorporated by Marcuse into his own argument that "the apprehension of nature as [hypothetical] instrumentality precedes the development of all particular technical organisation", and he quotes Heidegger to this effect (54). But what he deduces from it is far in advance of Heidegger's philosophical approach. Because the technological pro cedure is universal in Heidegger's terms, it is therefore political because it "circumscribes an entire culture [...] a world". Technology is therefore a form of political domination, and the "technological a priori is a political (50) Heidegger, Zur Seinsfrage (Frank furt-am-Main 1956).

(54) Marcuse, op. cit. pp. 154 sqq. 329</page><page sequence="19">JOHN ORR a priori". Now, remarkably enough, we have here the core of Marcuse's contretemps with Max Weber. This is not because Weber is seen as a typical ideologist of bourgeois-capitalist society, a remarkably unoriginal statement first made in any systematic way by the Nazi acolyte Christophe Steding. It is because Marcuse's approach to technology is itself Weberian in the political-sociological sense. For Marcuse is concerned with tech nology not as an instrument of power, but as an instrument of domination along lines which tacitly acknowledge Weber's distinction between Macht and Herrschaft. The remarkable thing indeed about Marcuse's position is his contention that technology is not an instrument of political or econo mic power. He does not argue, for example, that technology is the means by which the military-industrial complex extends its power over American society. He does not argue that scientific research establishments, univer sities and technical institutions are used by political elites for pursuing global policies. In fact his arguments are similar neither to those of C. Wright Mills or Noah Chomsky. He hardly touches upon the problems or policies of "a power elite" at all. Why? Because he is interested purely and solely in domination in the classic Weberian sense. And domination in this sense is concerned not initially with the powerful who make commands, but with, in Weber's words, "the probability that a com mand with a given specific content will be obeyed by a given group of per sons" (55). His objection to Weber lies in the fact that Weber ignored the possibility of technology as a form of domination of similar status with the three ideal types, charismatic, traditional and legal, for which Weber is famous. This objection emerges in Marcuse's famous attack on Weber at the Heidelberg Congress of 1964. But his criticism is actually based upon the suggestion of a fourth ideal type of domination. The very concept of technical reason is perhaps itself ideological. Not only the application of technology but technology itself is domination [of nature and men] methodical scientific calculated and calculating control. Specific purposes and interests of domination are not foisted upon technology subsequently and from the outside. They enter the construction of the technical apparatus. Technology [...] is interested in what society and its ruling interests intend to do with men and things. Such a purpose of domination is substantive and belongs to the very form of technical reason (56). Had we not already seen Carl Schmitt's critique of the German fear of technology, this statement might seem astonishing. For it projects tech nology itself as domination not as a means to it or as instrument of it. It also attributes to technology as a concept teleogical powers which smack of the grossest anthropomorphism. Instead of saying "society and its ruling interests intend to use technology as an instrument of domination over men" Marcuse claims that technology in effect uses society and its (55) Max Weber, Economy and Society (New York 1968), vol. I. (56) Industrialism and Capitalism in the Work of Max Weber, in Negations, op. cit. pp. 223-224. 33°</page><page sequence="20">THE HIDDEN FACE OF TECHNOLOGY ruling interests as instruments of its own domination. All politics are subservient to the unleashing of energy (the Jüngerian notion of technology) and the unleashing of energy controls politics. Marcuse's criticism of Weber is not then the credible one that Weber has failed to conceive of a type of domination which could be called 'totalitarian', but that he has failed to conceive of domination as 'technology'. But the argument about domination by technology is itself indebted to Weber. For Mar cuse's long discussion about the false value of consumer society, the repres sion of Eros created by the seemingly unlimited possibilities of pleasure, the phony language-therapy of linguistic philosophy and the attempted social integration of the working class through advanced processes of automation constitute the basis of legitimacy for technological domination. They are, in Weberian terms, the grounds for obedience, but obedience not to political or economic elites but to technology itself. For this reason Marcuse's attack on Weber is ineffective because it is partly Weberian and on the other hand it is also predominantly unoriginal because it merely repeats the attacks on Weberian thinking made by Schmitt and Jünger over thirty years previously. And those attacks were themselves part of the fascist critique of modern society, part of which Marcuse, to the unwitting delight of the New Left thirty years later, has managed to smuggle in by the back door. Yet between Marcuse and his fascist opponents of the Weimar Republic there is an important difference—apart from one man's fantasy being another man's horror. Schmitt and Jünger stressed the political compo nents of technological domination and the necessity for establishing revolu tionary political elites who could use technology in the most ruthless possible ways. Jünger saw his worker's Gestalt as a manufactured meta physics through which domination could be achieved by "a worker-aristoc racy" and "a ruling race". The Gestalt is merely a tactical device to achieve 'legitimation'. Jünger's view of it was totally nihilistic. Revealing quite openly his own cynical disenchantment with men's aptitude for living up to their own ideals he claimed that all revolutionary beliefs are betrayed by the process of life itself. For this reason the modern nihilist could short-circuit the betrayals of life by betraying his own ideals in advance in his own mind. This was the meaning of the following assertion he made: "The best answer to the betrayal of the spirit by life is the betrayal of the spirit by the spirit ; and it is one of the cruellest pleasures of our time to participate in the work of destruction" (57). Albert Camus has in fact called this "the actual formula of nihilism". What Marcuse does is to swallow the nihilist's bait. In his account of technology he reifies this voluntary act of nihilism, of the devaluation of values, into a totally deter minate reason. Such an idea of totalitarian technology is based essentially on a betrayal of mind by itself which Marcuse transforms into his personal nightmare and proclaims as necessary as predestination. It is the Calvinism of the atom bomb. (57) Jünger, op. cit. p. 37. 331</page><page sequence="21">JOHN ORR One detects a disenchantment here of similar proportions to Weber's idea of the rationalisation of the world. Marcuse's attack is less on modern scientists for enabling super-powers to manufacture weapons of global destruction than on the philosophers of modern science for offering up a world without any form of absolute truth, or any form of rationality other than a purely instrumental one. His objection to modern mathematical physics lies less in its anti-materialist rejection of ' matter ' as the stable substance of the universe than in its refutation of the Newtonian design of nature as essentially purposeful in some ultimate and cosmic sense. The whole problem of technology poses questions not only about reason in history but reason in nature. Hegel, despite the direction of many of his disciples, firmly believed that reason in history was but a minute fragment of reason in nature which was universal and all-embracing. In a secular world, the historicist element in Hegel's thought has perpetuated itself through Marxism, but the conception of nature has fallen, bereft of theological support, into disuse. The theories of relativity and indetermi nacy, the uncertainty relations of quantum theory have made the credibility of a grand cosmic design more remote than ever (58). The modern philo (58) In the nineteen twenties and early thirties the study of atomic physics was developed more crucially in Germany than anywhere else. In fact there are some links between Heideggerian philosophy and the most famous German physicists and philo sophers of science, Werner Heisenberg and Carl von Weizsäcker. Both regarded Being and Time as a philosophical treatise which accorded closely with their own natural philosophical standpoint—Heisen berg with his repudiation of causality and Weizsäcker with his rejection of the Cartesian dualism of res cogitons and res externa. In addition both philosophers were nationalists who stayed in Germany during the Third Reich to further atomic research despite a personal aversion to the Nazis. Predic tably enough it is Heisenberg's and Weiz säckers writings on the philosophy of science to which Marcuse pays most atten tion. But despite this, there is no evidence to suggest that the vast majority of atomic scientists who accepted in principle what Ar thur Koestler called "the vanishing act of modern physics" were in any way Heidegge rian. Jeans and Eddington were members of a totally different philosophical tradition ; Bertrand Russell, who recognised at a very early stage the philosophical difficulties created by mathematical physics, was a sceptical empiricist and Einstein, a fugitive from Nazism, was a pacifist and a humanist. In fact the evidence points the other way. Heidegger tried to claim support for his own philosophical position from the philo sophy of science. In 1934 he wrote: "The present leaders of atomic physics, Nils Bohr and Heisenberg, think in a thoroughly philosophical way and only therefore create new ways of posing questions and above all hold out in the questionable". One thinks of Jünger and Heidegger as attempting to apply modernistic models of natural science to their anti-humanistic view of man in a technological era, and like many nineteenth century writers such as Comte and Spencer, being attracted by the power of analogy. But their interpretation of the findings of modern science is itself controversial and open to question, as is their attempt to apply it to human nature. There is no good reason to assume that natural philo sophy does provide a basis for the philo sophy of man, though any account of the history of modern thought would tend to demonstrate their inseparability. For fur ther discussion, see Arthur Koistler, The Sleepwalkers (London 1959), pp. 528 sqq; Sir James Jeans, The Mysterious Universe (London 1937), pp. 122 sq.; Werner Hei senberg, The Physicist's Conception of Nature (London 1958), pp. 32 sqq., and Physics and Philosophy (London 1959); Carl von Weizsäcker, Beziehungen der theoretischen Physik zum Denken Hei deggers, in Martin Heideggers Einfluß auf die Wissenschaften, pp. 172 sqq. 332</page><page sequence="22">THE HIDDEN FACE OF TECHNOLOGY sophy of science is impeccably anti-Hegelian and is a good reason why many modern intellectuals prefer to concentrate separately on philosophies of man rather than deal with the insuperable problems of philosophies of nature. In regarding the modern philosophy of science as an integral part of the ideology of advanced industrial society, Marcuse is condemning it for failing to offer any source of absolute truth or absolute reason which will guide man in his new technology-based relationships with nature. But this strange criticism, where Marcuse's claim that scientific truth is dead has little of the resonance of Nietzsche's earlier assertion of the death of God, is not a criticism of ideology, but of its absence. The only sense that comes out of it is that some teleogical conception of nature is the only thing standing between man and wholesale destruction. For it alone offers the bope of pacifying man's destructive relationship with nature through reason. The desolate feature of modern science is that it holds out no promise whatsoever of such a Reason, hence Marcuse's extreme pessimism, and in its absence men cannot be trusted not to be totally destructive. In Marcuse's terms, the malaise of modern science lies in its, to his mind, ideological assertion that science yields no reason in nature and hence, no total ideology which can pacify technology. His only hope therefore seems to lie in an idea of secular reason manufactured by philosophers where no evidence of it seems to exist, preferably by philosophers who are Hegelian in the cosmic sense. The prospects of the pacification of nature seem remote, yet they comple ment the pacification of man through reason, a psychoanalytical device which emerges in the writings of Freud, to whom Marcuse is constantly indebted. In fact the other major influence on One-Dimensional Man, the more obvious one we have not yet considered, is of course Civilisation and its Discontents. For Marcuse the aggression instinct is integral to totalitarian technology; the libidinal instinct is implacably opposed to it. While Marcuse laments the absence of a philosophy of science which could contribute to a psychotherapy of nature, he is more optimistic about the psychotherapy of man. He puts his faith on rational self-knowledge acquired through psychoanalysis to cure those with vivid and morbid imaginings who fail to recognise "the scientific rational character of imagina tion". Like other neo-Freudians, he stands by the rationalistic faith in the therapy of self-knowledge and the modernist creed that human irra tionalismis fundamentally pathological. For after all who among modern commentators would dare to suggest, like Hume, that the disorders of the mind are a natural condition of mankind and that man is permanently obsessed "by the demons of his fancy, who haunt him with superstitious terrors and blast every enjoyment of his life" ? In a world where they continually see reason subverted by unreason, the Frankfurt school have, on the contrary, pledged themselves to subvert irrationalism through reason. But the pathos of this particular instance, where the modern left-Hegelians have achieved their greatest popularity, is that such (un) enterprise is initially coloured by the enemy it seeks to scourge. Despite 333</page><page sequence="23">JOHN ORR the Freudian faith in sex and psychoanalysis, despite the overt humanist defiance of technology at its most inhuman, Marcuse's Utopian blueprint for the overthrow of the totalitarianism he claims to find and despite in the modern industrial world, itself originates in a totalitarian metaphysics which remains "the daemon of his fancy". We have previously mentioned the absence of historical evidence for the period of transition to an alleged totalitarianism since 1945. At an abstract level Marcuse's vision of a transformation from a "two-dimensional culture" to "a one-dimensional society" is meant to be a vindication of this claim. Yet it suggests most the skeletons of the Weimar Republic rattling simultaneously in his cupboard. His concept of "two-dimensional culture", of a constant tension between art and society, recalls Jünger's vision of a decadent culture-fixated bourgeois society torn about by the contradictions between its precious bohemianism and its ruthless capitalism (59). His vision of one-dimensional society corresponds very closely to Jünger's vision of a monolithic worker's state based on technology, intended to crush the last remnants of bourgeois society into the dust. But apocalyptic ally it suggests 1933 rather than 1945 and the examples of art in two dimensional culture are nearly all of classic European literature which have never at any time thrived on the soil of modern America either before 1945 or after it. Marcuse's exhortation to the Great Refusal as he calls it, moti vated by the claim to be living under totalitarianism, has paradoxically inspired a politics of protest which could only possibly operate under the conditions of a democracy. Such protest among sections of the New Left had been accorded a mixed reception, some commentators seeing in it a revival of authentic humanism, others a revival of freelance fanaticism and intolerance. But the interesting point here is that at the end of Mar cuse's book, and despite a common belief to the contrary, no theoretical mandate for humanism is to be found. The "chance for alternatives" as he puts it is not merely shadowed by the trauma of the Weimar Republic. It, in fact, presents no chance for alternatives at all. How is this so ? At first sight it seems as if Marcuse wishes to put into effect a positive de-mystification of technology, and extract its malignant metaphysical core. But this is not the case. Despite his superficial Saint-Simonian optimism, Marcuse does not reject the metaphysics of technology. Instead he calls for "an alliance between science and meta physics". Although this alliance is presented as an Hegelian Aufhebung of "one-dimensional society", his very language suggests the erection of the very state of affairs he hopes to liquidate. Previously he had condemned the instrumentalist attitudes prevalent in modern science and technology. Now he himself demands the "scientific transformation of the world" through "the completion of technological rationality" (60). While one may in fact conjecture that technological rationality could never reach (59) Marcusb, One-Dimensional Man, op. cit. p. 229. (6o) Ibid. pp. 231-232. 334</page><page sequence="24">THE HIDDEN FACE OF TECHNOLOGY anything called completion, this is not the most surprising point. The most surprising point is that "the completion of technological rationality" is identified as a form of "metaphysical transcendence". Marcuse continues [...] This [transcendence] does not mean the revival of values, spiritual or otherwise, which are to supplement the scientific transformation of man and nature. On the contrary the historical achievement of science and technology has rendered possible the translation of values into technical tasks. Consequently what is at stake is the redefinition of values in technical terms [...] From the quantification of secondary qualities, science would proceed to the quantification of values (61). This "materialisation of values" Marcuse regards as the major task of a centrally planned universal technological rationality. The "transformation of values into needs and final causes into technical possibilities" is seen as "an act of liberation" which inaugurates the "pacified existence" of man. The planned mastery of nature and man is itself a negation of human choice which ends in bondage. When Marcuse adopted Bachelard's psycho analysis of matter as a psychotherapeutic device to make the imagination continually happy, one hears echoes of the happy consciousness of consum erdom he has inveighed [against. In his attempt to pit it, moreover, as a restrictive device against the feverish and destructive elements of the human imagination, there emerges out of the rhapsody of liberation the corrosions of despair. Technological rationality becomes the key to a centrally planned assault on the shortcomings of human nature, the core of a form of pacification which is itself totalitarian in its object and execution. Not only does it demand the impossible reduction of human values to tech nical tasks but it subsumes under its universal momentum science, eros and finally art itself, which is said to have its own technological rationality. Thus Marcuse's Utopia ends up a barely disguised tribute to one-dimen sional man. The continuity in the intellectual history of the idea of technology is quite remarkable. In the twentieth century Gestalt technology can be seen in the wider context of the Sturm und Drang of German Idealism. For it follows fairly faithfully the Promethean conquest by the mind of its objects in the external world for which we are indebted to Hegel. Jünger's in genuity here, and indeed his cynicism, arose from declaring eligible as booty of the mind's conquests the process of technological rationalisation which from a Weberian point of view entailed the radical disenchantment of the world. In Heidegger's later writings this attractive idea gains its full philosophical status. Mind conquers its adversary regardless of history or morality and with full knowledge of the ensuing catastrophe of destruction. For Heidegger it was a minor triumph of existentialism over Hegelianism in German Idealism. For Jünger it was the cheap and gleeful triumph of nihilism within the mind itself. From these nightmares Marcuse is &lt;6i) Ibid. 335</page><page sequence="25">JOHN ORR unable to free himself, finally and unconsciously he capitulates to them.
