Hankins III NASA Langley Research Center ABSTRACT Advancing technology and existing needs are converging toward a new spacecraft system - a free-flying telemanipulator system which can perform satellite servicing, minor repairs, inspection, and retrieval. Langley is supporting the technology required and performing systems analysis for such a vehicle. Man is a major part of the system - performing both high level direc- tion and lower level control functions, but sharing these functions with some onboard auton- omy. This paper discusses the technical chal- lenges and the role of man in such a system, and results from recent simulation studies. LANGLEY IS SUPPORTING the technology required and performing systems analysis for a system capable of performing remote space operations such as satellite inspection, retrieval, servicing, and maintenance. Although not a NASA flight program, a Remote Orbital Servicing System (ROSS) appears feasible and inevitable. ROSS will require integration of technologies including manipula- tors, sensors, communication, distributed com- puter systems, guidance, controls, displays, human factors, and artificial intelligence. This paper describes the concept for ROSS, the tech- nology drivers, and the role of man in such a system. ROSS CONCEPT ROSS has been identified as a focal point for NASA research in automation and robotics (l)*. ROSS basically consists of a manipulator system with sensors, tools and computer, all attached to a multipurpose propulsion and guid- ance system called the Teleoperator Maneuvering System (TMS), which is under study by Marshall Space Flight Center (2). Figure 1 illustrates a *Numbers in parentheses designate references at end of paper ROSS concept. The figure shows an anthropomor- phic manipulator configuration with stereo TV and multiple mono TV cameras, under control from a remote location. The anthropomorphic config- uration results from the goal of being able to service several satellites to the same extent as man in extravehicular activity (EVA) (3). Figure 1.- Remote Orbital Servicing System (ROSS) Concept ROSS would supplement the Shuttle capabil- ities by using its propulsion and navigation to reach satellites beyond the Shuttle's range and in situations which would be hazardous to an astronaut, such as high radiation. By refueling from the Shuttle or a space station, ROSS would remain in orbit and operate over extended periods and between Shuttle missions. Table 1 lists some possible ROSS tasks. Satellite servicing would include fuel and cryogenic resupply, and replac- ing or servicing some satellite systems. For difficult or unforeseen problems ROSS would retrieve the satellite and return it to a space station or to Earth via Shuttle for servicing or repair. Retrieval and debris removal will become more important as available synchronous orbit 4.50 0096-736X/84/9204-0050$02.50 Copyright 1984 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">slots fill and as satellites fail and decay to lower orbits.

ROSS is unique because of the technologies that are needed to make it effective and efficient. Two constraints that significantly affect the system design and the way the man interfaces and controls the remote system are communications time delays and avail- able bandwidth. Time delays, which could result from long signal paths or data encoding and decoding, necessitate an onboard control which would react quickly to failures or collisions. This impacts the man's remote control options. TASK SENSORS ACTUATORS COMPUTER COMPUTER DISPLAYS CONTROLS MAN Figure 2.- Block Diagram of ROSS Signal Flow Figure 3 shows one of the end effectors being used in the Intelligent Systems Research Laboratory (ISRL) at Langley. This end effector has strain gauges at the wrist which supply orthogonal torque and force measurements, a set of strain gauges in the fingers which supply two torque and force measurements, six light emitting diodes supplying proximity information, and rate and position sensors for finger motion. A pres- sure sensitive polymer matrix is being investiga- ted for tactile sensing. In addition, position, rate and motor current at each joint of the manipulator carrying the end effector are meas- ured. The ROSS concept shown in figure 1 would have this data from two manipulators plus five TV cameras (including one on each end effector). Trying to provide all of this data would far exceed the available communications bandwidth. The challenge is to supply all the information the man needs while minimizing the downlink requirements.

Technology in controls, sensors, com- puter vision, and artificial intelligence is moving rapidly, and will influence how man inter- faces with the remote system. ROSS must be designed so that man can perform both high level direction and low level control, analogous to a sophisticated aircraft system. Some of the considerations and research in developing the interface and defining man's role for ROSS are discussed below. 4.51</page><page sequence="3">4-52 J. E. PENNINGTON AND W. W.

PROTECTIVE CONSTRAINTS CONTROL LAWS COMPENSATION e è POSITION, RATE, INDIVIDUAL SERVO » DIRECT » ACCELERATION JOINT MOTIONS LOOPS FEEDBACK Figure k.- Control of Automated Systems SUPERVISORY CONTROL-In the supervisory con- trol mode the operator of ROSS should be able to input high level goals to a strategic (non-real- time) planner which determines the actions neces- sary to achieve the goals, and plans alternative actions in case of anomalies, then passes the plan or series of actions to a tactical (real- time) planner which executes the plan. The stra- tegic planner then monitors the execution of the plan, comparing the state of task with an inte- gral world model. At this level ROSS functions much like a robot with manned supervision. The input to the man must include a means to monitor the plans before and during execution, and to monitor the task to verify that it proceeds as planned. One way to do this is to present two visual scenes - one generated by the computer based on the strategic planner's world model, showing the expected situation, and another showing the actual situât on. In case of an anomaly the man must be able to interrupt the strategic control and assume a lower level of control such as directed control or teleoperator control (discussed below). A strategic planner called DAISIE (Distributed Artificially Intelligence System for Interacting with the Environment) is being developed in ISRL. DAISIE (k) has successfully demonstrated planning and control of a manipula- tor in a pick-and-move task and in a collision avoidance planning task. DIRECTED CONTROL-Us ing directed control (fig. 4) the man makes more specific commands and can perform strategic planning either in parallel with or instead of the automated strategic planner. The tactical planner would know task primitives (grasp, turn, move, etc.) and would be responsible for path planning including maintain- ing a reference to its location with the "world", generating optimum (in terms of energy of time) trajectories, and avoiding obstacles. Directed control would include aspects of Sheridan's Supervisory Control (5)* which allows both primi- tive commands via computer input and trajectory commands via hand controller. Directed control also includes features of Task Oriented Supervisory Control (6) where a high order task oriented language would be used, with the man having the capability to define new elements of the task language. Directed control is the merger of advanced control methods with Artificial Intelligence planning and natural language concepts. It is a challenging area for research. Directed or shared computer /manual control will require a multifunction interactive dis- play. The man will be able to define high order commands, such as telling the tactical planner to remove a panel or instrument, based on chains of primitive commands. Also, command sequences will be displayed for the man to examine and modify as required. The display will enable selection of the degree of manual and automatic control desired. The selection mechanism could include touch sensitive display panels, voice input, hand controllers, or keyboard. In addition to provid- ing task selection and control, the multifunction displays will present system status data (power, rates, force/torque, proximity, touch) in a form which is easily assimilated. A recent simulation (discussed later) investigated a multifunction TV and proximity display for a manipulator control task with time delays. The area of information requirements and integrated displays for ROSS is just beginning to be addressed. TELEOPERATOR CONTROL-At the teleoperator control level the man uses a hand controller to command the ROSS manipulator and end effectors. The type of controller, the variables commanded, the transformations into commands to drive the actuators, and the integration of the outer com- mand loop with the inner internal control loop for ROSS are important considerations. Six degree of freedom replica (mast er /slave) and non- replica controllers, with and without force feed- back, have been used for manipulator control; as have three axis hand controllers and keyboards. The nuclear industry uses replica controllers with force feedback for hot cell work, and the Shuttle uses three axis controllers without force feedback to control the Remote Manipulator System. Force feedback has been shown to be valuable for precise tasks such as grasping and insertion, but it can be destabilizing when the task involves time delays. With teleoperator control the operator can control position, rate, or force and torque in a number of coordinate sytems including an end effector (tool) system, inertial system, or a coordinate system in the task (task referenced control). Position control may require controller indexing (the ability to</page><page sequence="4">RIMOTE ORBITAL SERVICING SYSTEM 4.53 center the hand controller while holding the manipulator position) in order to use a larger manipulator operating volume. Task referenced force /torque control enables manned control of compliance for insertion tasks; or the man could use position or rate control to position the end effector, with a passive compliance device (j) controlling insertion. Defining the most desir- able controller ( s ) and contol modes for ROSS requires additional research. Little or no results are available for control of multiple cooperative manipulators. The simulation reported in (8) was conducted in ISRL and compared a rate command mode refer- enced to the end effector (resolved rate control) with an individual joint control mode in manned control of an alignment task, using dual three- axis controllers, with time delays up to 2 sec- onds. A multimode display was used in which the operator could select one of three different TV views, or a fourth view in which a proximity dis- play was superimposed on the TV scene. Results showed that subjects had no problems with the hand controllers or with selecting the desired visual scene. The proximity display caused a large improvement in alignment accuracy using resolved rate control, but with joint-by- joint control the subjects could not align to the accuracy displayed. Figure 5 shows the time to complete the task as a function of time delay and control mode. The task time varies directly with delay because with delays above .25 second sub- jects changed from continuous control to a move-and-wait strategy. Somewhat surprising was the indication that task time was a constant ratio for the two control modes. This will be tested in later studies. 1400 1- o Resolved rate control □ Joint-by-joint control □ 1200 - Leas* squares curve fit 1/3 joint-by- joint time jS 1000 - » 80°- / QJ / E / 600 - 400 - ^ 200 - oL I 1 I I i I 0 .4 .8 1.2 1.6 2.0 Transport delay, sec Figure 5.- Simulation Results DIRECT CONTROL-In the direct or joint-by- joint control mode the operator would command individual manipulator joint motion. This would be used as a backup mode because it requires more time and is less precise than teleoperator modes. Although it is feasible to control individual servos directly, it would still be desirable to command joint rates through a control system because manipulators are highly nonlinear, coupled systems. Inertia varies with joint (link) position and the load carried. To avoid flexibility effects, manipulators are often driven slower than maximum velocities and are made heavy and rigid. This is undesirable in an efficient space system • Work is underway to develop adaptive control systems which improve manipulator response under changing loads. SUMMARY In summary, ROSS represents neither a tele- operator nor a robot. Because of its sophistica- tion and unique constraints, it serves as a focus for a number of research areas. Man, although remotely located, would supervise and maintain control as in many sophisticated aircraft, or spacecraft ground stations. ROSS is a intriguing concept, but its versatility and effectiveness depend heavily on efficient integration of man within the system. REFERENCES 1.
