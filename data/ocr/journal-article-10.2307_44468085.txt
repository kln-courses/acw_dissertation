Primarily the re- sult of operation-related mistakes made by the machine operator, the loss of stability can lead to turnover of the vehicle and, in unfavor- - able cases on the edge of a slope, to multiple rollover. This paper is conceived in the form of a laboratory investigation and represents the continuation of the field rollover tests conduc- ted in 1979 at the Institute of Automotive En- gineering at the Technical University of Berlin. The laboratory investigations are intended to discover a way to effective protection of the machine operator in the event of lateral turn- over, as well as to enable presentation of pro- posals for test regulations for the vehicle re- straint system and for the resistant strength of the seat. OBJECTIVES OF THE INVESTIGATIONS THE NUMBER OF ACCIDENTS WITH EARTH-MOV- ING MACHINES in West Germany increased from approximately 4,800 in 1960 to approx. 6,900 in 1977. During the same period of time, the num- ber of such items of equipment in use also in- creased: from approx. 31,000 to approx. 80,000 [1] . Insufficient stability against overturn- ing during operations is the cause of accidents in 81 of cases. Accidents are typically initia- ted here by moving too close to the edges of slopes and pits, moving with lifted and filled shovel, or moving on gradients in a direction perpendicular to the line of slope [2]. To avoid or mitigate injuries to the operators of *Numbers in brackets designate references at end of paper. rollover-protected equipment, the following must be ensured: firstly, that the equipment opera- tor cannot be thrown out of the vehicle and, sec- ondly, that he cannot be subjected to collision against hard or sharp objects inside the opera- tors cab. An investigation in the USA of 53 fatal ac- cidents [3] which occurred between 1972 and 1974 in metal mining, quarry, and earth-moving opera- tions led to the conclusion that drastic reduc- tion of deaths could be immediately achieved if the front-end loaders involved could be equipped with ROPS cabs (rollover protective structures) and seat belts. Another analysis was performed on accident data collected by various institutions on over 1,400 accidents involving the turnover of earth- moving machines in the period between 1970 and 1979 [4], This survey revealed that 14.7% of turnovers of such equipment resulted in death to the operator in cases where the machines were not equipped with ROPS features. This is 3.3 times the rate for equipment protected by ROPS. Among the 16 operators who were killed in ROPS-pro tec- ted cabs, 14 were not restrained by a seat belt. The operators either attempted to jump out of their vehicles , or were thrown out; they were then crushed by the machine or rolled over by it. In a predominant number of cases, the operators cab was only slightly damaged. In 14 other ca- ses, the seat belt saved the earth-moving equip- ment operator from severe injuries. Another interesting discovery was made: at least one complete rotation of 360° was made by a significant number of earth-moving machines which turned over (26.5%). The area of equipment use played the most important role here. Crawler -mounted vehicles are, for example, more likely to be employed than are wheel-mounted front -end loaders in the more difficultly accessible areas (i.e., those in which turnover accidents are more probable) . Some crawler-mounted vehicles turned more than five times around their longitudinal 1.1038 0096-736X/85/ 9301-1038$02 • 50 Copyright 1985 Society of Automotive Engineere, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">axes. The limit here seems to be three turns in the case of wheel-mounted front-end loaders. Tne majority of turnovers, however (over 50%) , re- sulted in turns of up to one-half a rotation (up to 180°). Proceeding from the fact that the present ISO draft standard no. 6683-1981 (E) , "Earth-Mov- ing Machinery: Seat Belts and Seat Belt Anchor- ages," does not contain confirmed assumptions with regard to seat-belt forces and their effec- tive directions, we have made the attempt to in- vestigate the actual relationships involved and to arrive at presentation of a proposal orien- ted along accident realities. For purposes of revision of the above-sta- ted standard, planning is for both experimental laboratory investigations as well as for practi- cal long-term tests involving construction-site employment. The objectives of these laboratory investi- gations will be as follows: • preparation of performance specifications for the restraint system for earth-moving ma- chines, and submission of a new ISO draft to feature the following: n a simple test regulation n equivalent static and dynamic test condi- tions for the earth-moving equipment re- straint systems • effectiveness investigations of restraint systems presently used on earth-moving equip- ment • improvement and further development of these restraint systems, with consideration taken of acceptance by the operators and of ensur- ing that operator fatigue will not be a prob- lem. UPDATED DEMANDS ON A RESTRAINT SYSTEM FOR EARTH-MOVING MACHINES A thorough study of references on restraint systems for earth-moving machines has revealed that the safety of the equipment operator has been neglected in Germany, although an accident- prevention regulation has in fact been in force since 1 January 1980 (VGB 40, dated 1 April 1976 for excavators, loaders, graders, scrapers, and other special earth-moving equipment) . This accident-prevention regulation stipu- lates the following in Section 7, Paragraph 2: "Earth-moving machines with rollover-protection features must be equipped with seats with safety belts which will restrain persons to these seats in the event of a turnover." Since, according to Section 7, Paragraph 1 of this regulation, earth-moving machines must be equipped with operators seats which are mounted in such a manner that they can be adjus- ted, and which are designed, spring- cushioned, and damped in such a manner that damage to the operator's health due to shocks and vibrations is effectively prevented, then the following lo- gical conclusion must be drawn: a safety-belt system employed in accordance with these regu- lations can be anchored only to the seat itself. According to the present state of the art, there are no fundamental problems involved with production of vibration- and shock- ab s orbing seats with high resistant strength. Rüter and Hontschik [5] have recommended an integrated, retractor belt-seat system for the shock- absorbing seats most commonly employed in heavy trucks and buses. At the same time, how- ever, these authors do mention the not-yet sat- isfactorily solved problems involved with the transfer of belt forces with shock- absorbing seats. Fig. 1 shows the belt-seat combinations which could be feasibly employed for earth-mov- ing machines; in this context, only the retrac- tor belt has been considered for installation. The shock-absorbing seat features the fol- lowing disadvantages with respect to the sta- tionary-mounted seat, as far as installation of seat belts is concerned: • the pronounced and oppositely directed cu- shioning movements, which result in a great- er shift forward of the restrained opera- tor (Type A) • the reduced resistant strength of the shock- absorbing seat, which makes necessary the additional installation of an adapter (Types B, C, and D) , which in turn reduces the effectiveness of the shock-absorbing function of the seat. Since an earth-moving machine will normal- ly fall over to its side in a turnover accident, the three-point seatbelt is not necessarily the best solution for the protection of the operator. In case of a lateral introduction of force, the shoulder belt can slide off and therefore not be able to restrain the upper body; it can even re- sult in injury to the neck area. A significant weakness of the three-point belt, in comparison to the two-point lap belt, is wearing comfort. The two-point lap belt does not restrict the frequent and extensive upper- body movements required by such operators. Al- though an automatic belt retractor can theoreti- cally even be left off here, practical experi- ence dictates that it be recommended [6], As a result, an especially acute conflict has developed in the attainment of objectives for a suitable concept for such restraint sys- tems. On the one hand, the operator's upper bo- dy should be restrained to the seat (and there- fore inside the cab) during turnover of the ma- chine; on the other, a maximum degree of move- ment must be ensured for the upper body of the operator during his work. The existing regulations for safety belts and for the resistant strength of the seats in road vehicles are not suitable for application to earth-moving machines (these include the ECE regulations nos. 14, "Anchorage of Safety Belts in Passenger Cars"; 16, "Safety Belts for Adults in Motor Vehicles"; and 17, "Resistant Strength of Seats and their Anchorages"; as well as Euro- 1.1039</page><page sequence="3">1.1040 H. APPEL, ET AL. pean Community Guidelines 76/115, 77/541, and 74 /408) . TEST CONDITIONS The heretofore-valid stipulations for the load-supporting capacity of seat-belt anchorage points in cross-country vehicles vary consider- ably, as shown below: • For agricultural tractors, the anchorage points must not move more than 100 mm in any direction from their original positions, upon being subjected to a load of 4,500 N toward the front and 45° upward [ISO 3776-1976 (E) : "Agricultural Tractors: Anchorages for Seat Belts"] . • The following limits must be observed for earth-moving machines: H In August of 1977, a load-supporting capa- city of 6,000 N toward the front and 45° +_ 2° upward was recommended (IS0-TC 127-SC 2-N 161). n Today, the ISO calls for a capacity of 15,000 N at an angle of 60° +_ 15° toward the front and above for a period of 10 seconds [ISO 6683-1981 (E) , dated 15 July 1981]. According to experience which has been gained to date, it is considered unlikely that an earth-moving machine will turn over in its longitudinal direction, whether toward the front or toward the rear. Turnover toward the side is much more likely, with the result that the main direction of loading on the anchorage will be toward the side and above. The most recently conducted rollover tests [ 1 ] have yielded the following machine accelera- tion values in g' Acceleration for Earth-Moving Machines in Roll- over Tests Crawler-mounted vehicles: Phase 1 Phase 2 Acceleration (ill g) ac 0.25 1.50 S, X, max. ac 1.00 4.25 S, y, max. ac 2.75 7.25 S, z, max. Wheel-mounted front-end loaders : Phase 1 Phase 2 aS, X, max. 0.25 0.50 ac 3.00 2.25 S, y, max. ac 2.50 3.50 S, z, max. Here, "Phase 1" means rollover of the machine by 180°, from its undercarriage onto its roof. "Phase 2" means from the roof back onto the un- dercarriage, also by 180°. The loads to which the vehicle is subjected depend on the machine-specific data and on the surrounding conditions (such as soil consistency and the degree of slope) . The above-tabulated acceleration values apply for soft soil. It can be expected, even in the case of firm soil, that the maximum resulting acceleration components in the y (lateral) and z (vertical) directions will not exceed 6.6 g in Phase 1 and 20 g in Phase 2 of the rollover action. These values have been determined from the results of calculations and experimental investigations [1]. The effective direction of the resulting ac- celerations lies in the range of 60° +_ 15° to the horizontal, as proposed by ISO 6683-1981 (E); this direction is to the side , however, and not to the front. In Phase 1, the direction of force is toward the side and above (a tension compo- nent on the seat) , and in Phase 2 , the direction is toward the side and downward (a compression component on the seat) . The determining value for the seat anchorage is the maximum- resulting load of 6.6 g in Phase 1; in Phase 2, it is the lateral maximum y component alone, which amounts to 14.2 gģ From the test-sled results, capabil- ities which account for lateral decelerations of up to 10 g can be considered as sufficient (Fig. 2). A second evaluating factor for loads placed on earth-moving machines is the velocity, or change in velocity, upon collision with the ground. If firm soil is assumed, the machine will theoretically tip to the side only after the gravitational attraction through the center of gravity falls outside the wheel track. As a result, the following tipping limits will apply for earth-moving machines in the various sizes given (see Fig. 3) . No. of machine: 1 2 3 4 5 56.9° 57.2° 51.9° 55.2° 57.8° 6 7 8 58.0° 57.1° 51.8° In all the above cases, the lateral turnover an- gle of the machines is greater than 50°, with the result that there is no danger of rollover to the side in cases of normal equipment use (say, on slopes of 30°) . If such danger does in fact arise, this means that certain conditions will have additionally contributed: such as the lift- ing of a fully loaded shovel (displacement of the machine center of gravity upward) or the yield- ing of supporting soil (increase of the slope un- der the machine) . Calculations have been made to determine the maximum achieved velocity at the end of Phase 1 , with firm soil. In the most fa- vorable case, the velocity of the center of grav- ity of the earth-moving machine was approx. 10 km/h just before the collision onto the earth. In the most unfavorable case, this speed was ap- prox. 31 km/h. On the basis of consideration of</page><page sequence="4">EARTH-MOVING MACHINES 1.1041 these data, test-sled velocities of approx. 17 km/h were selected for investigation. This ve- locity lies in the middle range for a 360-degree rollover on firm soil. The following seat/ restraint system varia- tions were tested in a laboratory with the use of 22 fixed and 11 actual seats, and with a pneu- matic catapult enabling conduct of dynamic tests: Seats : 0 actual 0 fixed 0 equipped with special arm rests 0 equipped with pelvic support Restraint 0 upper-body (shoulder) support systems. ^ 4-point axilla/ lap belt 0 2-point lap belt 0 harness seat belt. The anthropomorphic dummies were after Alderson, HYBRID II type, 50% dumny, weighing 75 kg, as well as after Sierra, VIP type, 95% dummy, 89kg. ANALYSIS AND EVALUATION OF THE MEASURED RESULTS The following evaluation criteria were used in the analysis and assessment of the results from 26 tests: a. In accordance with ISO-TC 127-SC-2N, dated August 1977, the recommendation was accep- ted for a test load of 6,000 N for both an- chorage points, with a direction of force of 45° +_ 2° toward the front and above. b. In accordance with ISO 6683-1981 (E) , the load of 15,000 N was applied in the direc- tion of 60° + 15° toward the front and above, for a period of 10 seconds. c . The framework for occupant protection was provided by biomechanical limit values for lateral collisions, as available from most recent research (see Fig. 4) [7]. The following limit values were applied from the above: • The resulting head acceleration must be limi- ted to 80 g for a period of 3 ms. • The lateral inclination of the cervical spine may not exceed 60 . . . 70° . • The resulting acceleration of the thorax must not exceed the value of 30 g over 3 ms. • The resulting hip acceleration must remain under 40 g over a period of 3 ms. • No forces exceeding 7 kN may be exerted onto the shoulders. • The loading on the iliac crest must remain below 5 kN. • The upper load limit for the femur (thigh) is 2 ... 3 kN. Working from the basis of the biomechanical tolerance limits for the human body, one can de- rive protective criteria which, of course, must be strictly enough designed so as to ensure that the human-body values given in Fig. 4 are not ex- ceeded in the case of rollover of earth-moving equipment (an occurrence which, to be sure, in- volves loads on the occupant significantly less than those encountered in road-vehicle colli- sions) . A 95% dumny, a two-point lap belt, and a seat without arm rests were employed in an ini- tial series of nine tests with fixed seats. As was to be expected, maximum values were recorded for the resulting lap-belt force (7,400 N) and the inclination of the upper body (80 ... 90°). Further tests conducted with actual seats (which better represent reality encountered) have shown that the resulting accelerations in no oase reach the limits imposed by the protective cri- teria: for the head, only one-fourth of the maximum limits was achieved, and for the thorax and the hip, the figure was only one-third. These values were so low, however, because the occupantes body did not collide with parts of the machine cab; otherwise, greater forces, es- pecially on the head, would have been observed. On the average, the lower belt forces on the right occupant side were 2.3 times less than those on the left side. This resulted from the fact that the impact was introduced from the right (as seen from the standard dummy1 s point of view) . With the exception of one test, the belt forces. on the upper belt part of a 4-point axilla/lap belt show significantly less differ- ence between left and right sides. In the case of greater forces here, the upper belt part will be pressed downward, and a transfer of forces will accordingly no longer take place. This fact demonstrates the poor efficiency of the up- per belt part of the 4-point axilla/lap belt and provides the reason for the pronounced lateral displacement of the upper body. The resulting upper belt loads remain only at one-third of the ISO limit value. The maxi- mum resulting lap-belt force of 6,000 N was achieved in two tests: with a 50% dummy, a 95% dummy, a two-point lap belt, and a seat without arm rests. The following can in addition be used as ef- fective criteria for safety evaluation: the in- clination of the upper body, the portion of the pelvis area remaining on the surface of the seat, and the angle of inclination of the seat itself. In our tests, the inclination of the upper body varies between 60 and 95°, the seat-contact sur- face between 20 and 90°, and the seat inclina- tion angle between 18 and 40°. More favorable values for the seat-contact results of 70 to 90° were achieved by installation of a pelvis sup- port and improved arm rests. The influence of the 4-point axilla/lap belt has, on the other hand, rather unfavorable effects on the seat in- clination (33 to 38°) here. The lap-belt forces resulted at exactly the same levels as for the 2-point lap belt. Upon employment of the harness belt, reduc-</page><page sequence="5">1.1042 H. APPEL, ET AL. ti on is achieved in both the upper belt forces and the lap-belt forces. For the dummy, seat contact of 70% was reached with the special seat, and 50% resulted for the normal seat. With this "racing belt," the mean lap-belt force of 2,170 N definitely lay below those for the 2-point lap belt and the 4-point axilla/lap belt: one sure sign for a uniform distribution of forces along the upper/ lower range. The ratio of the resulting lower belt force to the upper force is approx. 1.6 for the racing belt; for other belt types, this figure is ap- prox. 3.2. On the basis of this ratio, it is clear that it is primarily the lap-belt part of the 4-point axilla/lap belt which holds the stan- dard dummy down to its seat (Table 1), and that, as a result, additional vertical loading of the seat of 5.6 g times the hip mass (approx. 16.2 kg [9]) = 900 N on an average, is caused. Under the influence of this vertical load, the fixed seat inclines less than the actual seat (14° on an average, compared to 30°, respectively). In contrast, however, the standard dummy slides away considerably more from the seating surface of the fixed seat (seat contact area of only 481, compared to 57% for the actual seat). This obviously positive upper-body inclina- tion angle of only 60° achieved in one test was the result of very accurate conformity of the belt geometry and very little slack in the belt itself. Such a tightly fitted belt would, how- ever, severely restrict the operator's freedom of movement. For the remaining tests, the slack in the belt was determined according to European Com- munity Guideline 77/541: by insertion of a 25- mm- thick board between the seat back and the standard dummy. Since the upper part of the harness belt continuously slipped down, the shoulder-belt part was secured to the body by adhesive tape. As a result of this taping, both the upper belt force and the lap-belt force were each reduced by approx. 1,000 N. The arm rest can stop the lateral movement of the lower body and can help to absorb its ki- netic energy (see Fig. 5) . With employment of the arm rests, the resulting lap-belt forces were in every case less than without the arm rests. The arm rests installed on the seats tested here were in most cases considerably bent; this demonstrates proof of "soft" energy absorption. This fact was also demonstrated by the low re- sulting hip accelerations of the standard dum- my (see Fig. 6) . Figs. 7 and 8 clearly show the influence of the body mass on the resulting pelvis- and axil- la-belt forces. The greater the operator's body mass, the greater will be the belt forces. Con- trary to this, however, the hip accelerations for the 95% dummy are less than for the 50% dum- my (Fig. 9). The fact than an increased mass of a dummy will result in greater belt forces, but also in reduced acceleration, is not in fact a contradiction: two different "bodies" are in- volved here, and the action can be compared to a collision between two bodies. The body with the larger mass experiences the smaller change in momentum, as well as the smaller deceleration. If the mass of a body is increased, then its own deceleration will become less; that of the col- liding body will in turn be correspondingly greater. The 2-point lap belt will be subjected to greater loads than the lap-belt part of the 4- point axilla / lap belt, for which the axilla belt absorbs part of the forces applied (Fig. 10) . With regard to hip acceleration, an advan- tage of the 4-point belt over the 2-point belt cannot be determined as part of a basic tenden- cy, especially if the tests with the 95% dummy are disregarded (Fig. 11). At the same time, nevertheless, it can be assumed that a slight restraining effect of the upper body is indeed involved with the 4-point belt, since the later- al upper-body positional angle with the 4-point belt will change by 45° in tests with a fixed seat, and this angle of inclination with a 2- point belt will lie on the order of 80°. An individual comparison of the tests "with- out arm rest and 4-point belt" and "without arm rest and 2-point lap belt" once again emphasizes the influence exerted by the belt system: the resulting head, thorax, and hip accelerations are approximately equal for both belt types; with the 2-point lap belt, however, the lap-belt force is 25% greater, and the upper-body angle of in- clination is 62% larger. A decisive influence on the loading forces, on the body inclination, as well as on the de- gree of seat-contact remaining, is exerted by the pelvis support and arm rest elements: with a seat equipped with these features, a 2-point belt suffices. This special seat provided the very best results; as with all other tests, how- ever, the outer limits of the cab were still struck by the dummy's head. Owing to this head contact, a seat system with additional lateral shoulder support was de- veloped in order to reduce the pitch of the up- per body. Testing with this seat, a 2-point lap belt, and a restrained 50% dummy resulted in fig- ures which represent only a fraction of the cur- rently valid load limits for passenger cars: one-fourth for the resulting head and hip accel- eration values, one- third for the resulting tho- rax acceleration, and one-half for the resulting left lap-belt force. Owing to the upper-body support provided, no inclination toward the side (in relation to the seat) took place. The kine- tic energy of the dummy was partially absorbed by deformation of the lower seat frame, whereby the mounting of the seat rail was not bent. Owing to the absence of actual cab limits in the test here, there was overall no body col- lision with unyielding parts of the operator's cab, with the result that the average accelera- tions measured for head, thorax, and hip were only slightly greater than the sled acceleration values observed (see Table 1) . On the other</page><page sequence="6">EARTH-MOVING MACHINES 1.1043 hand, the lateral body displacement is corre- spondingly greater. On the basis of experience gained in pre- vious testing, two additional seats were de- signed and tested; they featured the following: reinforced arm rests, extended shoulder and pel- vis support, reinforcement in the seat shock- absorbing system, widened base surface, and an automatic lap belt. For both seats, permanent deformations were observed only after the sec- ond crash; the seat rails withstood the loads involved. The resulting belt forces fell be- tween 3,300 and 5,000 N and the resulting hip accelerations, between 9 and 18 g. Upper-body inclination amounted to between 20 and 45° . These tests also revealed that a widening of the seat base and reinforcement of the seat shock- absorbing system enabled definite reduction of upper-body inclination. The vertical movement of these shock-absorbing seats used was achieved by the use of an adjustable spring/damper sys- tem, or air bellows acted upon by differing pressure. PROPOSALS FOR ISO DRAFT STANDARD 668 3- 1981 (E) DYNAMIC ROLLOVER TESTING - In the event of lateral rollover, the main loads acting on the operator will be in the lateral direction. Fig. 4 shows a comparison listing of human tolerance limits and passenger-car-occupant protection criteria for a lateral collision [7], In the event that the occupants head strikes interior parts of the vehicle, a pro- tective criterion is required in the form of HIC &lt; 1000, or of a maximum head acceleration value of 80 g over 3 ms. The protective criterion for the lateral force in the shoulder is fixed at 6 kN, which is somewhat lower than the corresponding tolerance limit of 7 kN. The force induced onto the tho- rax may not exceed 1 kN per rib zone. The maxi- mum permissible lateral acceleration for the thorax is 30 g for 3 ms. The tolerance limit is 40 g here [ 1 0 and 11]. In the case of the loads on hip and pelvis, the attempt is made toward the lower tolerance limit with the protective criterion of 5 kN. The acceleration must be less than 40 g for 3 ms . No protective criteria are provided for the cervical spine and for the lateral loads on the thigh. The above-stated "specifications" apply with equivalent definition to both of the fol- lowing : • the degree of the ground slope and the depth, both of which significantly determine the progress of the rollover • the consistency of the soil, which determines the "hardness" of the fall. Since the tipping limits lie between ap- prox. 50 and 60°, according to the size and type of the earth-moving machine involved, the angle of slope must be at least 40°. Fig. 12 shows the test configuration. Here, the vehicle is to be raised at one side, as it rests on the slope, until it reaches its tipping limit; it must then be allowed to fall down the slope. The length of the slope must be long enough to allow the earth- moving machine to make one full revolution (360°) about its own longitudinal axis. The mean soil consistency of clay is approx. 8,000 N/mm [1], a figure which is, however, exceeded by the ground in mine and quarry work. Since harder ground will result in greater loads placed on the operators, the ground provided for test pur- poses here must be firmer: we propose a mean consistency of approx. 13,000 N/mm. A 360-degree rollover covers at least 75% of the serious turnover accidents which occur in European countries (see [4]). As an alternative here, Phase 2 can be simulated alone. In this case, the vehicle would stand on its roof at the top of the slope and would be allowed to make half a revolution (180°) as it falls down the in- cline; at the end, it would land on its undercar- riage. In this latter case, the slope would therefore have to be only half as long. The loads in the second rollover phase are greater than those in the first (from the undercarriage onto the roof) , both for the machine as well as for the operator. This alternative test procedure, however, would neglect the initial kinetic energy present at the beginning of the second phase: for this alternative, the kinetic energy would be practi- cally zero. In the event of a 360-degree roll- over, in contrast, the kinetic energy would be zero only for a very favorable constellation of the influencing parameters (slope inclination, consistency of the soil, and vehicle parameters); with all probability, then, it will be greater than zero. As the vehicle rollover progresses, the kinetic energy will be dissipated only par- tially by deformation of the ground and of the vehicle structures. The energy remaining will be increased as the time of the fall progresses, with the result that it will be greater at the end of the first phase than at the very begin- ning (zero) , and that the succeeding collision with the ground in the second phase will be in- creased (i.e., harder) by a degree corresponding to this amount of residual kinetic energy. In addition, definition must be made of the specifications of an earth-moving machine for test purposes. DYNAMIC LABORATORY TESTING- The above-proposed testing specifications with actual accident conditions require relatively great ex- penditure and involve a number of difficulties, especially with regard to costs connected with the following: • the testing site (slope inclination, slope depth, and soil firmness) • the measurements of the loads involved • maintenance of constant test conditions. The effort should therefore be made to transfer the testing of the restraint systems to the lab- oratory. The dynamic restraint-system test can take place in a manner similar to that described</page><page sequence="7">1.1044 H. APPEL, ET AL. in the Guideline 77/541 issued by the European Community, with the exception of the following deviations : • A lateral impact will be simulated. • A standard cab will form the limits of free- dom of movement of the standard dummy. • The biomechanic tolerance limits must be ob- served. • Immediately before the impact, the velocity of the test vehicle should be approx. 20 km/ h, with the deceleration approx. 10 g. • If the restraint system is asymmetric, then it must be subjected to dynamic testing on both sides. The standard cab will not be necessary if it can be guaranteed that the lateral bodily displace- ment of the standard dummy will not result in excessive loading. Bodily contact with the cab can be considered not to take place (or to take place to only an insignificant degree) if the physical displacement of the dummy relative to its cab does not exceed 200 mm (IS0/DIS 3411- 1982: "Earth-Moving Machinery: Human Physical Dimensions of Operators and Minimum Operator's Space Envelope") . Slight exceeding of the limit value here will be permissible only if it can be ensured that the residual energy will not result in serious injuries to the operator, i.e., that it will remain below 40 Nm in the case of a large-surface impact [ 1 1 ] . Since the dynamic test can take only the horizontal component of loading into considera- tion, special separate testing of the restraint system must be conducted for the vertical direc- tion (Fig. 13). The anchorages of the seat occupied by a standard dummy held in by the restraint system must withstand an acceleration of 5 g in the ver- tical direction. An equivalent testing proce- dure would be the application of a longitudinal force acting in the above-stated direction and corresponding to five times the overall weight of the restraint system, the seat, and the stan- dard dummy. The stated magnitude of 5 g has been taken from computed and tested simulations [ 1 ] and represents a reasonable compromise with re- gard to the effectiveness of the restraint sys- tem. The second application of loads to the re- straint system and to the seat in a vertical di- rection must take place immediately after the dynamic test, before any repair or maintenance is performed. In this manner, the actual course of the rollover can be realistically simulated. In Phase 2, the seat is subjected to great- er compressive loading (approx. 15 g) in the vertical direction. In this case, the operator will be pressed onto the seat, with the result that here no special test will be required. Another alternative would be a comprehen- sive test of the seat/ restraint system by angu- lar positioning of the system by 25° + 5° to the horizontal (see Fig. 14). The sled velocity and acceleration should be 20 km/h and 11.2 g9 re- spectively. STATIC LABORATORY TESTING- Test ex- pense can be further reduced by static testing of the restraint system. The protective crite- ria for the operator as mentioned at the begin- ning here would then have to be neglected. As for the dynamic laboratory test, the re- straint system and the seat will be tested here for their lateral resistance strength. A resul- tant force must be applied to the restraint sys- tem and to the seat, the horizontal component of which corresponds to 10 times the total weight of the restraint system, seat, and standard dum- my taken together, and the vertical component (acting upward) of which corresponds to 5 times this weight. During this testing, the anchor- ages of the system must not become loose. The direction of this test load should be to the side and upward in the range 25° + 5° (the 25° is the result from the relationship: 10 g along the horizontal and 5 g along the ver- tical) . See Fig. 15. In addition to testing of the resistant strength of the restraint system and the seat, it must also be ensured that the operator is not displaced too far to the side, i.e., that the restraint system also actually holds him to his seat and within his cab. To determine this, two separate resultant forces will be applied to the sitting standard dumny: one at the level of the center of gravity of the thorax, and one at the height of the pelvic center of gravity. In each case, the horizontal component of these forces must correspond to 10 times the respective weight of that part of the body, and the vertically (upward) acting force must be 5 times this amount. According to Hertzberg [8], the upper body of a 50% man has a mass of approx. 34.7 kg, with the pelvis and thighs approx. 16.2 kg. The fol- lowing two forces must therefore be applied si- multaneously in a lateral direction upward, be- tween 25° +5°, at the level of the center of gravity of the upper body and the pelvis, respec- tively (seat index point here: DIN/ISO 5353- 1980): 34.7 X 9.81 X &gt;/102 + 52 = 3,800 N and 16.2 X 9.81 X V102 + 52 = 1,750 N. As a simplified alternative, the resultant force of 3,800 + 1,750 = 5,550 N can be consid- ered to act in the same direction, at the level of the center of the upper body. In the case of asymmetrical restraint- sys- tem configurations, both tests must be performed for the right and for the left sides. The anchorages of the restraint system and of the seat must withstand the above -specified loads for at least 5 seconds: the lateral 360- degree rollover of an earth-moving machine can progress over a period of up to 5 seconds (see [1]).</page><page sequence="8">EARTH-MOVING MACHINES 1.1045 CONDUCT OF A STATIC LABORATORY TEST In order to certify the realistic nature of the static testing possibilities involved here, tests were conducted on a special seat with pel- vis support and upper-body lateral support. A lap belt was mounted to the seat, in which a SOI dummy was secured. In order to test the lateral displacement of the standard dummy, the seat with dummy and lap belt were subjected in a first and second test to a force of F. . = 5,550 N toward the tension right and toward the left, at an angle of 25° at the center of gravity of the upper body. The direction of force changed slightly during testing, owing to the angled position of the seat. By application of the test load, loading was relieved from the spring/damper sys- tem; the seat could therefore be subjected to the force only in its upward position. In both tests, the seat suffered slight, permanent de- formations; its mounting and adjusting systems remained fully functional, however. The dummy did not slide out of its lap belt. For purposes of testing the lateral resis- tant strength of the restraint/seat system, the magnitude ° of the tensile force F, . can be ° tension calculated from the following: The mass of the seat: M = 30 kg S G 3. U The mass of the dummy: ^durnmy = 75 kg The acceleration a : a - '/102 + 5 2 * q res . * = 11.18 g F. . = (M + M ) X a = 1 1 , 500 N tension seat dummy res. In a third test, the tensile force F, tension = 11,500 N was introduced to the lap belt at the level of the center of gravity of the seat (seat res i s tant- strength test) . In order to determine the position of the point of application of this force, the standard dummy was employed as an aid. For purposes of product testing and acceptance, a tension device as stipulated in the European Community Guideline 76/115 is recommended. Load testing was performed on the same test stand as for the first two tests. Upon applica- tion of the force, the seat was raised from its spring support system, it was turned toward the direction of tensile force applied, and it reached its load limit at F, . = 9,500 N. tension The seat rails were deformed but were not torn out of place. All other parts, such as the scissor- jointed supports and the seat frame, were either sheared off or severely twisted. The damping pot of the seat cushioning system was punctured and leaked. The seat had a permanent- ly deforming inclination of 50°, and the upper part of the seat was partly torn loose from its lower part. In their lateral direction, the scissor- jointed seat supports demonstrate very little stability, with the result that only a reinforced or double version of the shear sup- ports would represent an improvement. The seat was cold-straightened in a long series of many tedious repair steps, and was put back into service. A subsequently performed additional dynamic test was then run, which the seat withstood with less permanent deformation. This experience once again reinforces the les- son learned on the difference between static and dynamic testing: that the duration of applica- tion of a load plays a significant role in the load-supporting characteristics of the material. For this reason, free selection can be made among all three test possibilities, which conse- quently can be treated as being effectively equivalent . SUMMARY Work done on occupant protection in the field of earth-moving machinery is still in its incipient stages, although a relatively large step was taken with the introduction of the roll- over protective structures (ROPS cabs) . Further protection, however, can be achieved only if it can be ensured that the operator cannot be thrown out of his "protective cell" in case of an acci- dent, and if he can be prevented from recklessly jumping out. During the performance of his du- ties, the machine operator must be restrained to his "workplace," whereby the restraint system should hinder him in his freedom of movement as little as feasibly possible. Rollover tests [ 1 ] have revealed the inher- ent weaknesses of restraint systems currently in use: they were taken over from the field of road vehicles and were primarily conceived and de- signed for the frontal crash. These systems alone, consisting as they do of strip belt mate- rial, offer entirely insufficient protection in the case of lateral introduction of forces, since they are incapable of checking the operator's up- per-body movements. The result is lateral upper- body displacement and rotation which extends far beyond the limits of the operator's cab, as was clearly determined in experimental simulation testing at the Institute of Automotive Engineer- ing at the Technical University of Berlin. This extensive displacement and rotation of the upper body inevitably leads in case of actual accident to collision with inflexible parts of the cabin and possibly with objects outside. The operator is accordingly seriously injured. Testing was also performed of restraint sys- tems with greater upper-body control effective- ness, to include the 4-point axilla/lap belt and the harness belt. The 4-point axilla/ lap belt offers better wearing comfort than the harness belt, but the former does not fulfill the re- quired safety regulations and objectives. The tightly worn harness belt, on the other hand, does in fact afford genuine lateral protection. Its employment for the earth-moving -machine field, however, is restricted by its complicated use and by its unacceptable restriction of the operator's freedom of movement.</page><page sequence="9">1.1046 H. APPEL, ET AL. The best solution found by us is a combina- tion of the lap belt and lateral upper-body (shoulder) supports. Here, automatic retrac- tion must be provided for the lap belt, and it must be possible to adjust the shoulder supports for various upper-body widths. As a result, a relatively high acceptance rate can be expected from earth-moving-machine operators for this user-oriented restraint system. Presently used restraint systems for earth- moving machines demonstrate other weaknesses as well. The following is a summary of fulfilled and not-yet- fulfilled requirements to be placed on the restraint system: • The pelvis is held down to the seat by means of a lap belt, in combination with a pelvis support (e.g., at the seating surface or in the form of sufficiently dimensioned arm rests). As a result, the operator is not able to jump out or be thrown out. • We have been successful in restraining the upper body to the seat and in preventing fur- ther displacement and rotation of the upper body in relation to the seat, by means of providing an upper-body (shoulder) support. A harness belt would of course also provide this safety: owing to its complicated opera- tion and restriction of freedom, however, it is less well suited. • Restraint of the upper body to the seat and fixing relative to the cab will automatically lead to protection of the head against impact. • Care must be taken to ensure, however, that the cervical spine, which must be considered here as the weakest part of the body, is not bent more than 60 . . . 70° . The upper-body support will therefore possibly have to be ad- ditionally employed here, to prevent a whip- lash effect to the cervical spine, for af- fording energy absorption (the cervical spine is particularly sensitive when stressed in the lateral direction) . • The belt loads involved lie on the safe side of the acceptable. The mechanical loads placed on the belt and its anchorages can be considered to be low. By the system devel- oped here, wearing comfort and avoidance of fatigue are satisfactorily taken into consi- deration. • The shock-absorbing seat, however, must be improved with regard to its resistant strength. At present, it represents the weakest link in the overall restraint system: indeed, it is precisely its yielding which actually contributes most to the extreme up- per-body displacements relative to the ma- chine cab. On the basis of results from field and lab- oratory tests conducted at the Institute of Auto- motive Engineering at the Technical University of Berlin, and from the investigations of third parties, definition has been made here of pro- tective criteria for operator safety in earth- moving machines. In this context, a balanced relationship was attempted between the benefits to be achieved through implementation of the pro- tective requirements, and the costs accruing thereby. The protective criteria were formula- ted so as to be lower than the biomechanical li- mit values involved. This is because the load values induced by an accident with earth-moving machines are greatly less than those observed in the collision of road vehicles: the travel speed (and hence collision velocity) of such street ve- hicles is, of course, many times greater than that of the construction equipment concerned here. If the restraint system for earth-moving machines can only to a reasonably sensible de- gree be correctly and effectively designed, then it can be expected that these protective crite- ria as formulated here can in fact be fulfilled. On the basis of these biomechanical protec- tive criteria for lateral loads, dynamic and static test criteria and conditions have been de- rived for the restraint systems of earth-moving machines. These results could indeed be used to bring the current ISO standard 6683-1982 (E) much closer to the actual conditions encountered at present.
