A fortune can presently be amassed, I am assured, if one can harness one's word processor to the task of instructing others how it is they can dress "as if' they were powerful, converse "as if' they were knowledgeable, listen "as if' attentive, address the public "as if' in possession of supreme control, and generally, in some over-arching manner, exist "as if' they were excellent. The key to this fortune is to dwell neither too long nor too analytically upon the "as if' aspects of this new competency, but rather to convince one's readers that the connection between dressing and power, like that between exercise and calorie burning, is a causal one. Ours, even more than Bishop Berkeley's, is an empirical age. The tree which falls in the forest does so, as all undergraduates know, only if perceived. When one lives in a world in which to be is to be perceived, it is clear that those who desire to be competent must be seen as such. Oliver Wendell Holmes comprehends the nature of both our age and its roots in the empirical tradition when he noted that "justice must not only be done but be seen to be done." In an age in which justice and its monitors must take heed of the practicalities of public relations, one is left with the insight that how others see one is vital. Even the principle of justice succumbs to impression management. To succeed, one must perform one's role with an eye not only to the task at hand but to one's audience. Work, indeed life and the self, must be managed. In the pre-empirical world, the world of faith and magic, things were known to happen even though others did not see, feel, or hear them.

All in the know knew, so one believed, that God was far too complex an embodiment of the "allness" to be so manifestly perceptible. Indeed, the mystic and the magician, the alchemist and the charismatic elder, all archetypes of the pre-empirical world, held their power over men and women because they claimed, like kings in their divine right, connections to unseen forces. It was these non-material, non-perceptible, yet very real forces which governed this cosmos. To the empirical mind, at least when sober, the pre-empirical cosmos, while a romantic pastiche, is far too susceptible to fraud, violations of logic, and promises of expiation to provide a sufficiently secure world for urban, indeed urbane, Homo sapiens. The empirical mind allocates, or so it insists, power to others commensurate with their proven abilities to produce. The emphasis is not upon the king's claim to divine right, the mystic's to the portents of the future, but upon the proven ability to act as if one were a king or, as it were, relying upon them with the degree of confidence they would have had if one were a genuine prophet. The empirical mind, you see, insists upon proof. It is this insistence which permits the empirical mind to believe that it can detect fraudulent claimants to the mantle of power, violations in logic and natural laws, and illusory promises to expiate transgressions. Initially, the empirical notion of proof was simple and immediate. In the early emergence of urban man, the division of labor, whether by kings, shoemakers, or tax collectors, was relatively simple. In this setting, competence was as competence will always be to the empirical mind- the proven ability to succeed at one's task. In the context of a relatively simple division of labor, if one was a mason and one made stone walls well, having them tested by the fury of storm and the baking of hot suns, then one was, and was therein perceived to be, competent. It seemed that in this direct link there was a natural law. The competent succeeded in nature's test of man and his work. Herbert Spencer's social Darwinism was thought to be a fact of the new realism, the new materialism, the new scientific spirit of empiricism. What was natural in this natural law of competence was that poseurs, frauds, and false claimants to the mantle of competence would be, and in time had to be, detected. The blustering, quick-talking mason stood naked before the natural law of competence when his wall proved child's play to the hard winds of the storm. As the division of labor became more complex, so too did the simple link between competence and its reward. What stoked the flame of the consciousness of revolutionary writers at the early stages of the factory movement was their perception of the erosion of the natural law of competence. In Marx, for instance, in his railing against both capitalism and Hegelian idealism, we find, as was typical of the critical spirit of this time, a lament for the devastation of the natural law of competence. It was, Marx argued, labor which added the value to man-made products, not the owners</page><page sequence="3">Impression Management and the New Competence 249 of factories, the judges who defended the property-holders, or the merchants who sold, and for a time owned, the goods produced by the laborer. The crime of the capitalist was not a product of individual avarice, but a change in the rules. Marx saw these as economically determined. The new rules suggested that competence no longer was seen in the actual production of products, but in the organization of its production and, more importantly, in its consumption. In the culture dominated by the economic centrality of the factory, new elements interposed themselves between and twixt the direct relationship between humans and their perception of one another's competence. In the factory, the division of labor established the sort of logic which argued that more and more of man's labor, concentrated on smaller and smaller bits of work creating the economies of scale and its ensuing efficiency which would increase the productive capacities of firms. Adam Smith's illustration of the manufacture of pins speaks the language of this new logic well. One man, Smith argued, well versed in the skills of pin making, might on a good day manufacture twenty or so pins. This fellow would fashion each pin individually, focusing now on the pin head, then on the pin stem, then on the pin point, then the tempering and hardening of the whole. When each of these pin parts was allocated to a specific laborer, one could, when employing five or six men, increase the number of pins manufactured from say twenty to each of the men to well over five or ten times this number. The trick to increased capacity rested in eliminating the trial and error equivocation, some would say learning, wherein one worker had to develop and master several distinct skills. When each became competent in a smaller and smaller bit of work, the whole of society would, Smith argued in appealing with his metaphysics of an "invisable hand" to a great composer unseen in the economy, become far better off- indeed, wealthier. The critics, like Marx, of this new factory-centered cosmology pointed out how man, in becoming more and more integrated into the machinery of production, kowtowing as it were to the new God of efficient production without ever really coming to terms with it, forfeited that which must, by the natural law of competence, be at the center of his relation to others and to nature -namely his identity as being him or herself as a totally integrated self at work. The critics drew a deep sigh and called the newly emerging man alienated man. Alienated man, in looking for his self in the fruits of his labor, in the shoes he had made, the walls he had laid, could find only a very small and not too easily decipherable image. The self, as moderns might phrase it, was fractured. The individual along the assembly line, the railroad track layer and the canal builder all, in some senses, knew that what they created existed. They could, as it were, stroll along the tracks or pick up a piece of machinery which they may have contributed to in the manufacturing process, but when push came to shove and a man had to make it clear to himself, just who he was, what</page><page sequence="4">250 Et cetera • Fall 1986 he was about and what was right and what wrong, this man was lost. Being lost in the midst of the newly bustling cities did not mean that one went hungry or was cold. It meant that one had entered upon a trajectory in which even in the thralls of one's material success, one must brave the dangers of having left one's identity, one's notion of self, in the hands of others, frequently strangers, who, if one was to continue to succeed, one must impress. Indeed, while non-alienated man located the self in his relation to nature, that is to the test of whether a wall did or did not withstand the storm, alienated man located his self in relation to the market. The individuals in the factory system who achieved the highest material rewards, indeed the greatest social acclaim, those whom others sought to emulate, were not those who did the actual laying on of hands in the work process. The pride of craftsmanship has been dented by the factory system logic which perceived in the increasingly mechanized division of labor an opportunity to move away from the art of the craftsman and move toward the science of production. In the science of production the key to efficiency is not, as it were, the satisfaction the craftsman achieves in working his materials as an artist might his clay, but rather in the notion of standardization and mass batch production. Those who worked upon the raw materials were not to build into them any overly clear traces which might, as it were, distinguish lathe operator 16 from lathe operator 42 when both were employed upon the manufacture of the same article. This effort to eliminate the idiosyncrasies of identity from being scratched into the products of the factory system were no conspiratorial effort to do damage to the human soul. The motive for the standardization of the production of the factory system rested in efforts to re- suture the game so that selfhood and identity could be defined in the context of the market. Those who succeeded in the market- the owners of factories, the designers of other men's work and the procurers of venture capital -all possessed the means of expressing their competence in a manner quite distinct from the downwardly mobile craftsmen. These new winners, as it were, embodied the game as it was played in the factory system. They were competent, not at wrestling nature, red in tooth and claw, that is storms and famine, to the ground, but rather they were masters of the game of getting others to enter into relations from which they stood to profit. These folks were masters of motivating other humans to do work which, in the best of all worlds, profited all concerned. Where those who tell the tale of alienation drive home their most interesting point is in locating the state of alienation, not merely in the assumptions of the downwardly mobile craftsman or the dispossessed farmer, but also in the life plans of the factory owners, managers and financiers, indeed in the then- new wealthy, the winners of the factory era. Their point, a good one, is not that losers lose selves and have identity problems, but in the transition to the factory system, the game and its rules had shifted sufficiently so that the word</page><page sequence="5">Impression Management and the New Competence 251 revolution in the over-worked phrase "industrial revolution" was, at least from a psycho-social vantage, quite meaningful. What rested at the center of the new game was the belief, indeed a substantially reliable one, that competence and its reward ensued from the ability to get others to enter into one's plans. The factory unfolded in a techno- structural sense as a consequence of the factory owner's ability to get others to do his and his lieutenant's bidding for twelve or so hours a day. In return for this, these others, through the marketplace, achieve, or at least believed they could achieve, a degree of security heretofore possessed only by the very few. The key to success and therein too of competence lay in one's ability to convince others, directly or indirectly, to become part of a greater pattern, an organization which, in mustering the work of others, would provide the opportunity for each, in time and if sagacious, to become like the factory owner- a controller of one's destiny. To be competent in the emerging factory system entailed convincing or impressing upon others the manner in which one's success could be detected by one's possessions, one's capital. The factory system invested the notion of competence in the ability of some, not all, to organize and therein possess things. This was the age Thorstein Veblen lampooned as the "age of conspicuous consumption" and Samuel Clement called the "gilded era." In this age the idea of competence passed from the craftsman to the owner and organizer of things; it was no longer a mark of one's competence to be highly capable at building a wall, mending a shoe, or putting up a windbreak. Those who made the strong claim to competence were those who owned the means and tools of the craftsmen, those who could hire and fire the mason and the shoemaker. Indeed, competence shifted in this robust period of manufacturing from the ability to make things to the ability to make things happen. The creativity of the thing in itself was not celebrated as the acid test of mastery, but the manner in which the thing, once made, could be consumed in the act of ownership. It is, I believe, not accidental that the economists of this period believed that the key to the healthy economy was not necessarily in stimulating supply, but demand. It was the act of consumption that stirred the machine which made social players believe in their competence and sufficiently so as to continue consuming. The act of consumption, the final proof of ownership, invested one with the status which impressed upon others that in the future you were a safe bet. You became an individual who could be trusted in two weeks or a month to reimburse others who worked for and under you. This was the age of the mansion and estate. Social space which extended the competent self as a clear manifestation of the impressive ability to muster- indeed master- the productive capacities of others. The most difficult character to comprehend in this age was the wealthy miser- the man or woman who lived a penurious existence while sleeping beneath floor boards hiding what could have and should have been, if the miser had all her marbles, a mansion and a life of</page><page sequence="6">252 Et cetera • FALL 1986 luxury and ease. To believe so fiercely in the abstraction called security, not to put it into practice by enjoying the fruits of one's wealth, not to invest in winning the approval of others and impressing the world with one's importance was, and to a large degree still remains, a mystery. In hushed tones, the miser, like a religious relic of time passed, had lodged the notion of competence in an inward-looking game, not in the game of impressing others, of enjoying one's impressions. The impression management of the factory system alienated the successful by making them prone to an exceedingly scripted existence. To be competent required, as empiricism itself mandates, that one must prove it. To establish one's competence increasingly required that one succeed in the hustle and bustle of the marketplace so as to give form and substance to one's competence. The factory and ownership of it, or the ownership of a retail outlet or other force which made clear one's ability, was held out as prime evidence. This evidence could and should, it was argued, never be an expression of the idiosyncrasies of selfhood for the market was driven by competition. The firm was in a sense an expression of one's social system, not of one's self. The self became severed from its rootedness in the quest for competence and became, in lieu, something to be satisfied, something to be owned and controlled. The self in the alienative spirit of the factory system became like Freud's notion of the ego, a concept central to the age of conspicuous consumption, a force which to be useful, even healthy, must be civilized and controlled. The ego is to be made useful. The craftsman who sees the self in his wall and feels good when it withstands the tempest is far too primitive a soul for the age. This is an anthropomorphic self, one who, like the child, may and can erect a wall to withstand a storm, not for the much more real reason, namely that a wall is useful and needed. The ability of the craftsman to turn artist on one stings the sensibilities of the factory age. The truly mature self, the competent factory system self, is a project, an assemblage of roles sutured so as not only to meet the demands of others but contribute to these demands. The concept of the competent self as the useful project capable of reflecting back to others the importance of one's project is, I believe, a step, mind you only a step, towards the new competence. Today, and I write in 1986, we have, as I shall discuss in the next section, become fully conscious of the realm of impression management as a form of capital. We have and are in the process of emerging from the factory system, and in this movement, in the emergence of the service or information society, have become competent insofar as we can control the manner in which information about the self is received. We are who we see on the mind's television. The competent among us manage the translation well. The less competent remain mired in the search for an atemporal, authentic and, to some degree, invulnerable or securely anchored notion of selfhood. The factory system is not gone but has been superseded by the strong fact that in countries like Canada, the United States, France, West Germany and</page><page sequence="7">Impression Management and the New Competence 253 others of this highly advanced status, fewer and fewer citizens work in factories. The smoke stack and the assembly line worker are going the way of agriculture and the agrarian. This is not intended to imply that these two have become less important, for it is clear that men and women still eat, some even quite well, and men and women still wear factory-produced shoes and cut their bread with factory-produced knives. What is intended here, in the analogy between farming and factory work, is that in each it now takes fewer and fewer Homo sapiens to generate more of what passes for food and the stuff of manufacturing. Both sectors of the economy, at least in the so-called advanced nations, have embraced the machine and the reality of economies of scale to generate agri-business in farming and the multi-national corporation in manufacturing. The social reaction to these phenomena has been mixed. On the one hand, the doctrine of "small is beautiful" is waved like a banner of clear thinking and good intentions. Indeed, the folk singer lampoons the big conglomerates and agri-business and romanticizes the small farmer, the little factory worker and others fighting, as forces of good always do, but losing heroic battles against the forces of evil -the bully boys. On the other hand, the urban-trained achiever seeks, with all the energy he or she can muster, to become part of the future, part of the corporate team that can propel a lad or gal into an illustrious career. If, in the advanced or so-called advanced nations, fewer and fewer people are working on the farm and fewer and fewer people in the factory, where exactly are more and more people working? This may, for some, have the ring of a mystery novel about it. It should. Living in the changing world, we move in and about these changes as if they were as reliable and as steady as our dining room table. This is as it should be. We must, if we are to put together plans and dreams, be in love and watch what we intend to on television tonight, rely strongly on that which remains relatively constant and treat change only insofar as it disturbs our routine. The movement of people from the farm to the factory, at times called the industrial revolution, was, on looking back, a very grand, very momentous dislocation. However, I reckon, and here as elsewhere in this paper I rest content with the mild playfulness of conjecture, that many of those who lived through and in that long stretch of time called the industrial revolution did so unaware that they were aboard the planet at a time and in a place which in the future would be seen as a turning point, a critical juncture, a peaceful yet entirely tumultuous time. These people too put together plans and dreams, were at times in love, at other times out of it, and, while not aware of what was to be their television programme of preference for that evening, were probably aware that the evening routine, like ours, was a rhyme and rhythm conducive to sleep and the search for deep, even splendid, dreams. While fewer and fewer people today are engaged in the production of foodstuffs and even fewer in manufacturing, more and more, at least in the aforementioned advanced countries, are engaged in generating nothing that</page><page sequence="8">254 Et cetera • FALL 1986 is tangible at all, indeed, in generating services. To some, and they go by the odd professional appellation of futurologists, we in Canada, the United States, France, West Germany, Japan, and others are stumbling as did our great great great grandparents throught a revolution akin to the industrial revolution. These theorists, like Daniel Bell, Alvin Tofïler, Paul Haimos and others, conjecture that ours is a service revolution. In the movement of work and workers, in some, certainly not all, countries, from manufacturing to services we have the creation, as Daniel Bell argues, of an entirely new game -one in which man no longer sutures his notion of competence in his struggle with things, but now and in the near future in his ability to impress upon people his or her worth. We must, I feel, be cautious with tales of the future, especially those tales which tell us that we are living in important times. The ego of tale tellers is such that it takes a very odd one indeed to begin his story with the startling possibility that he and his audience are alive in the unimportant time, in an unimportant place, and hearing what must, if one marries time and place, be a relatively unimportant tale. This said, let us look at what it is that the futurologists tell us about the apparently unfolding nature of the service revolution. Our ear must, I believe, first become attuned to the blatant optimism, the wishful thinking, of this position, but in developing our analysis I shall, in distinguishing the text of the tale from its sub-text, point to how an understanding of the service revolution may aid us in comprehending the new competence. Those who have etched in the contours of the service society have been univocal in celebrating the new societal form as an improvement upon its predecessor -the industrial society. The idea of progress, despite rumblings of its death, is alive and well in the reckonings of the futurists. The reasonableness of the belief that the future, or at least that part of it being born now, as an improvement over the past, is substantiated by very many reasonable insights. Indeed, the centrality of science and the scientist, especially in the guise of the professional or expert, is seen as a focus for the imagining of the future. The expert, like the scientist, learns by his or her errors. Just as science, via the hypothesis, is a self-correcting procedure, so too the expert housed in professional associations learns by his or her errors. The cybernetic future places in the machine the ability to think and correct itself. While in some sense the machine which works or acts as a muscle girds industrial theorizing, the thinking machine, the artificially intelligent mechanism or learning organization girds, if somewhat hopefully, the image of the service society. In the service society, the antagonism between man and machine, a Luddite- like fear which gripped the imagination of the early industrial works, is borne in the contemporary ambivalence towards the robot, artificial intelligence and memory banks. The futurologists assure us this fear, like the older one of the assembly line and the automobile, yes the car, will be overcome. The new</page><page sequence="9">Impression Management and the New Competence 255 machines, the thinking, automated, cybernated and generally "high" in lieu of "low" technology machines are, as Marshall McLuhan put it, capable of producing the "global village". Fears of new social configuration growing are natural, but in essence, rather than projecting ourselves into some faceless heightening of bureaucratic malaise, a distillation of the worst of the city state expanding, we are moving in an undulating "third wave" fashion to a place and time where from the kitchen nook in our houseboat in Vancouver harbour we can reach out and access, if so disposed, the French translation of the complete works of St. Augustine or the conversations of participants to a conference on plasma physics occurring in a Mexico City hotel. This imaging of the new ease of access, a sort of mental teleporting, is viewed as only the edge of the service society. At the everyday level, quality of life will improve. Work will no longer be an affair of sweat, grunt and salt tablets, but the application of knowledge to generate services. The image of the service society worker is that of the information worker, a middle class, white collar worker who has been trained to work in and with the new and avowedly high technologies so as to generate the intangibles which fuel the economy. These intangibles can, of course, be brought to earth. They reside, albeit somewhat metaphysically, in such notions as the insurance man's selling of security, the government's of intelligence, the teacher's of knowledge, the doctor's of health, the counsellor's of sound advice, and on and on. In this newly emerging service society, one enveloping us as we age, we now buy, sell and even in some sense produce well-being, knowledge, security, intelligence, health, sound advice and a welter of other intangibles. While one can, if so disposed, attack the service society theorists for a somewhat overly positive view, for their skillful elimination of negative news, their treatment of advanced economies as in some sense isolated from their third world neighbours, and for their treatment of services not as the work of the waiter and the department store clerk but the lawyer, doctor and computer programmer, this criticism would in itself do little but point to how much of our portrayal of the future is coated in either the rosy high gloss tints of wishful optimism or the austere shades of the unending toil and tyranny. Our aim is not to label the futuristic glass as one half-empty or half-full, to laud either the techno-philes or their cousins the techno-phobes, but to look at the manner in which the increasing generation of services, those of the waiter, the computer specialist, the psychoanalyst and the insurance salesman, are couched in a notion of competence which celebrates impression management. This paper began in the apparent and well-watched success of a new, and one must note growing, industry- the writing of books and shaping of demonstrations on how to impress others with one's excellence. This, I now argue, is no accident, no psychoanalytic twist of the times, no reaction to Halley's comet, but I believe the result of the changing nature of our marketplace. To work now in countries like Canada means that at the end</page><page sequence="10">256 Et cetera • Fall 1986 of the day most of you will produce nothing that can, like the mason's wall, be tested by storms. We are increasingly a nation who produces security, intelligence, health, advice and knowledge, no longer simple hewers of wood and drawers of water. While we do produce cars and space arms, most of those housed in organizations which do so have only a very indirect relationship with the car and the arm. We are personal counsellors, marketing folk, cafeteria help, security guards, gardeners, managers and the like. To assure the world and even ourselves that we are competent, we have sutured our identities to a new game. The new competence game is one which intellectuals have understood as being inherent in market structures long before the advent of the industrial or service revolution. In ancient Athens, just as in modern Winnipeg or Toronto, those who bring the market material goods, like plates and cutlery, can and will be judged by their potential customers quite differently than those who bring intangibles like security or knowledge. In the former, the existence of the product, say the plate, as an object distinct from its producer can be assessed by the customer. The customer can, if so disposed and granted the seller's permission, bite the plate, try it out, bring it home to her husband to see if he too sees its merit. This "caveat emptor" or buyer be wary logic is in use because the consumer, in her assessment of the plate, is quite capable of, as the scientists suggest, using her senses to assess its utility. On the other hand, the vendor of intangibles, men like Socrates who brought knowledge to the marketplace of Athens or those like the man from London Life Insurance who sold me security from his office above Granville Market in Vancouver, must develop in the absence of a concrete product a relationship of trust with their potential clients. The distance from "caveat emptor" to "credat emptor" encapsulates the tension which gives rise to the new competence. To produce services one must, in some manner, be perceived by the potential buyer of said intangibles as being quite capable of delivering. One cannot, like the plate purchasers, bite on the insurance policy. The plate maker who looks like he is a bit of a tippler, a bit of a rogue and a roustabout, may, as the plate indicates, not only be a master of his genre but a man who, as Thoreau noted, "marches to his own drummer". This would not, I conjecture, put most of us off his plates. On the other hand, the case of the insurance man is a bit more complex. To judge the nature of the avowed security secreted in our insurance policy or in the scalpel of the physician or the value of the professor's erudition, we may, in viewing the evidence of a rogue, feel that perhaps the easy offering of trust, given the whiskey smell, the general air of dissipation, the absence of furniture without cigarette burns and the like, might be put off until we locate another. The generator of services like those of the waiter or physician is assessed by his manner, indeed by the way he or she impresses us. The shift from the testing of objects to the testing of people and their</page><page sequence="11">Impression Management and the New Competence 257 performances is the aspect of the transition from goods and services which impacts most markedly on how and when we assess one another's competence. To make sure one succeeds in the society of the new competence, it is vital that one possess the credentials which remove one from overly close scrutiny. Credentials, like medical degrees, doctorates, engineering degrees, or others like being a representative for IBM, the United Nations or Canada, permit the individual to achieve a degree of legitimacy which loosens the testing mechanism in many impression management sequences. The credential is organized proof either in the form of a license or in the form of sponsorship by a large organization not only that one is who one purports to be but that one is competent in generating the intangible which one is offering. Thus doctors are certified by their peers to possess the competence to conduct their specific selling of intangibles. Insurance salesmen are certified by their association and the companies employing their services. Indeed, we are assured in mellifluous tones that this or that insurance company has been "established in 1817". It is left to our imagination to dwell in the unstated, namely any company selling such intangibles as security and peace of mind which has persisted for one hundred and fifty years must be delivering on its promises. While we are moving rapidly indeed towards a greater and greater degree of credentialism, the movement itself must be seen as part of the way in which it is vital that those who sell intangibles be seen as possessors of scarce talents, indeed as professionals. Whether one sells real estate, does journalism, or tends to flowers, there is, it is clear, a vast movement to have oneself seen as part of a professional association. In this way, one's membership eases the very testy notion of whether or not one, from the point of view of a potential purchaser of one's service, ought to be trusted. When success is increasingly a matter of one's ability to gain the trust of others in a way which cannot, as in the instance of the plate maker, be easily embodied in the object of exchange, the marketplace turns symbolic. Speaking imaginatively here, the service society is an abstract one. We purchase new commodities like security, intelligence and knowledge and in this market we seek to assure one another of the meaningfulness of these exchanges. In life insurance, sales talk turns to how much an eye, when lost, is worth; in governmental monitoring of secrets, how much the information pertaining to the techniques for nuclear submarine mobility is worth, and on and on. This talk, vital talk for our economy, is tied to the impression management skills of the speaker. The embodiment of security is lodged in the ability of the insurance man to erect a symboligy of security- the long list of scientifically accurate numbers, the tables, the proper suit, the voice tone, the awareness of the importance of children and those left behind to deal with the tumults of an often insecure world. The new competence of impression management is no passing flash of hucksterism but, I contend, a deeply ingrained change in the way the social</page><page sequence="12">258 Et cetera • Fall 1986 game is structured upon its economic axis. The game is now a game increasingly of marketing the self as competent, not, as was prevalent in the industrial past, the self as embodied in the product as competent. The indirectness of the more abstracted market, the service market, makes each one of us far more vulnerable. To cope with this vulnerability, we have and will, I believe, become increasingly gifted at teaching one another to put ourselves into the role we play with an increasing awareness of whether others are or are not buying it. There is no end to authenticity, but rather see the search for it as a path entered into years ago which will, as in all paths entered into in the past, reveal to us how in some way, a way Shakespeare certainly experienced, all the world is a stage and we, in some senses, are actors who strut and fret our hour upon the stage. To the modern, the strut must be highlighted and brought to the lighted marketplace, the fret subdued and kept in the privacy of one's study. Subdued by the recurring reassurance of the authors of the "new competence" texts that we too can appear to the world "as if excellent," we too can "pass" in the new game being played. To the modern, the metaphor of the stage as an instance of life is more than a comment on leisure time activities or on the virtues of solid perforamce, but an issue central to success and failure. When the script becomes vague and the stage manager, which is the self, has been struck with uncertainties, there still is, of course, a living to be made and an audience to establish one's competence before. It is in this moment that a shorthand script may make itself not only enticing but a best seller.</page></plain_text>
