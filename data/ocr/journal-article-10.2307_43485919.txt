<plain_text><page sequence="1">Epidemie Iconographies: Toward a Disease Aesthetics of the Destructive Sublime Ingrid Gessner ABSTRACT This article addresses a number of evocative nineteenth-century pictorial representations of yellow fever epidemics, including illustrations from Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper and Harper's Weekly between the 1860s and the 1880s as well as photographs taken during and after America's so-called 'splendid little war' in Cuba in 1898. These pictures of diseased and dead bod- ies, which frequently sensationalized and sentimentalized the epidemics for American readers, constitute complex sites of tension: viewing them generates disgust that might also be accompa- nied with a morbid delight. These representations of the yellow fever experience embody striking contradictions between the aestheticization of the abject and the moral implications emerging from voyeuristic engagements with disease, death, and suffering that call for close examination. These contradictions provide a point of entry for critical engagement with the politics of aesthetic expression and ensuing ideological conflicts during the period. In order to understand more fully the processes of medical and imperialist power formation in the United States, the article reads these pictures as political instruments that destabilize notions of ethics and aesthetics and conjure up what Miles Orvell, in another context, has described as the 'destructive sublime.' Introduction: Picturing Yellow Fever As early as January 1857, the Cosmopolitan Art Journal commented on the increasing number of visual representations in magazines and newspapers. With regard to the recently founded enterprises of Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper and Harper's Weekly , it stated that the "'illustration' mania is upon our people" (qtd. in Mott 192). Nicholas Mirzoeff has aptly commented that the "hyper-stim- ulus of modern visual culture from the nineteenth century to the present day has been dedicated to trying to saturate the visual field, a process that continually fails as we learn to see and connect ever faster. In other words, visual culture does not depend on pictures themselves but the modern tendency to picture or visual- ize experience" (5). In order to understand better what have become almost inevitable visualization practices, we need to take a look at the nature of the visualized experience. It is noth- ing new or modern that these experiences often pertain to extremes, i.e., the most basic human needs and anxieties, which are triggered by fears of disease, death, and war. In medieval and Renaissance art, for example, the iconographie 'Dance of Death' or 'Danse Macabre' was tied to the plague years in Europe (e.g., Hans Holbein's piece from 1538). In the case of epidemics, the perceived risk of trans- mission and the spread of panic very often accompany their appearance. Diseases, as Rüdiger Kunow has argued, are furthermore transgressive phenomena (24) as</page><page sequence="2">560 Ingrid Gessner they are capable of traveling from host to host across national borders (sometimes with the help of a non-human carrier), which also feeds into a culture of fear. The concept of contagion in its figurative and literal usage may serve to link the history of epidemics and panic.1 As Martin Pernick points out, "[References to contagious fear were not necessarily or wholly metaphorical" since anxiety was seen as a direct cause of disease. In this line of argument, "[p]anic could literally be seen as both an epidemic of fear and as the agent by which [. . .] epidemics spread" (861). The "mul- tifaceted relationships between culture and transmissible disease" are also evident in nineteenth-century pictorial representations of yellow fever epidemics (Wald, Tomes, and Lynch 618). Illustrations from the early and late nineteenth century, pic- tures from Harper's Weekly and Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper in the 1870s and 1880s, and photographs taken during and after America's so-called 'splendid little war' in Cuba in 1898 and 1899 all lend themselves to recognize the processes producing the disease experience as well as the affective responses to it. While early-nineteenth-century lithographs established a visual rhetoric of yellow fever, the pictures in the post-bellum illustrated newspapers Harper's Weekly and Frank Leslie's enabled readers to gaze at what the disease does from afar. Keeping the (pictorial) distance, late-nineteenth-century military photog- raphy redirected the focus even more to merely witnessing other people's pain. Both corpora, the newspaper illustrations and the army photographs- with their specific medial delimitations- represent aestheticized versions of the yellow fever experience since the disease itself could not be represented. The pictures of diseased and dead bodies, which frequently sensationalized epidemics for American readers and viewers, constitute complex sites of tension: viewing them generates disgust that might also be accompanied with a morbid delight. Miles Orvell, in another context, calls this feeling of fearful awe the "de- structive sublime" ("After 9/11"). The visualization of the yellow fever experience furthermore serves as a form of control and normativization. The contradiction between revulsion and pleasure provides a point of entry for critical engagement with the politics of aesthetic expression and the process of identity formation in delimitation to disease and embracement of health. If we are to understand more fully the processes of medical and imperialist power formation in the United States, we need to explore these pictures that rely on emotion and affect- rang- ing from sympathy and compassion to fear and revulsion- to control disease.2 In 1 Although contagious has been replaced in medical dictionaries by communicable (in the sense of 'capable of being transmitted'), the concept of contagion remains important with re- spect to speculations about the cause of diseases. Contagion is entangled with politics and ethics: the assumption "that another person is the source of disease makes the links between conta- gion and personal blame [...] especially close and visible. When 'other people' have been seen as the source, contagion has been used to blame outsiders and outcasts, especially immigrants and minorities. However, when the emphasis has been placed on 'close contact,' contagion has also blamed intimate intracommunal communications, especially sexual and family contacts" (Pernick 862). Pernick also cautions researchers not to reduce contagionist medicine to politics or morality alone, but also to see it in its relations and the dependencies of its specific time and place. 2 In the proposal for their "Affect and Photography Panel" (ASA 2012), the organizers point to the affective turn in photography, an understanding of emotion and feeling as one of the key sites through which power relations- including imperial rule- are produced. "Whether</page><page sequence="3">Epidemie Iconographies 561 order to define power relations, the images destabilize notions of ethics or moral obligation and aesthetic expression such as an understanding of what can and should be represented. Do the depictions stimulate complicity or resistance? In other words, do they involve the reader or provoke confrontation and abhorrence, both as a means of control? Establishing an Etiology and Iconography of Pictured Disease A rhetoric of yellow fever representation was established with illustrations from the early nineteenth century onwards. Yellow fever has an even longer his- tory in the United States; it has been called 'West-India' or 'American yellow fever' and was categorized as one of "our epidemics" in the late eighteenth cen- tury by the editors of the Medical Repository (Rush 156; Caldwell 16; cf. Arner 458). The disease was, however, not indigenous to America, and- given today's knowledge- can be called an 'imperial' disease since vector and virus originated in Africa and entered the New World through the slave trade. A watercolor print created by Abraham James and published by William Holland in London on Oc- tober 1, 1800 (fig. 1), critically exemplifies the early nineteenth-century under- standing of the disease in poster size (approx. 12" by 19"). It was published at the same time as Charles Brockden Brown's gothic novel Arthur Mervyn , which is probably the best-known literary example of yellow fever representation. Fig. 1: Abraham James, "The Torrid Zone, Or, Blessings of Jamaica." London: William Holland, 1 Oct. 1800. Wellcome Library, London. For corresponding color plate, see the supplement. The print is a comment on the mixed "blessings of Jamaica" or, in other words, imperialist practices. "The torrid zone," or the tropics, is defined in the zodiac as situated between crab and lion in the Northern hemisphere, or the emphasizing specific affects (melancholy, for example [or sympathy, one might add, with regard to yellow fever depictions]), the circulation of emotions between bodies, or the significance of feelings in public life, the scholarship on affect offers new approaches to thinking through the relationship between bodies, images, and publics."</page><page sequence="4">562 Ingrid Gessner tropic of Cancer. The signs of the zodiac with the sun in the middle also signify the summer months between June and August when yellow fever was most ag- gressive. It is a parodie and caricaturesque cosmological diagram that represents the dichotomy of life of colonialists in Jamaica, suspended between languorous, carefree living- including napping, dancing, and smoking- that borders on de- bauchery, and the horrors of disease lurking underneath. The bottom sphere is circumscribed by a scythe that the skull-faced beast of yellow fever is holding with its right hand. The conspicuously yellow-colored demon, which has "yel- low fever" written on its abdomen, is an allegorical depiction that follows a long line of representations of disease in the form of serpents, skulls, monsters, and thieves.3 In its left hand it holds an empty hour-glass, clearly signifying death in the form of the Grim Reaper. The flames emanating from the skull represent the high body temperature of the fever or hell raging below. The ghoulish fig- ure on the left is being attacked by a scorpion that has inserted its tail into his neck, about which the lettering indicates a "sore throat." On the right the bony hand of the mustached ghoul, suffering from West-Indian dry gripes- as again the lettering tells us- clutches his side with sharp talons. The upper sphere is circumscribed by an angel's wings; however, with its aged complexion it more closely resembles a Father Time figure, holding a bottle of opium (to alleviate pain or sedate the colonialists). The colonialists, between blissful oblivion of the fever that rages below and an active repression of the underlying potential for racial upheaval, swoon beneath his fierce, white-eyed visage. The print ironizes this form of controlling the beast of disease, suggesting that it cannot be held down for long. Like its literary companion Arthur Mervyn , the illustration criti- cizes colonial practices gone astray.4 Between 1793 and 1905 yellow fever- superseding even cholera- was respon- sible for the most severe epidemic outbreaks of disease in the United States. The probably best documented yellow fever epidemic struck the then-capital of the United States, Philadelphia, in 1793. Between four and five thousand residents, or 8-9 percent of the city's population, died. By the 1840s yellow fever had retreated from northern port cities to southern ones. The 1853 yellow fever epidemic in New Orleans claimed the lives of eight to nine thousand people, or 9 percent of the population. By the mid-nineteenth century, an understanding of yellow fever's transportability had gained the upper hand. Although the disease's etiology (its causation) could not yet be fully explained, the earliest cases of yellow fever in east coast cities during the 1850s "could all be traced to ships arriving from yel- low fever-infested Caribbean ports" (Humphreys 24). Several outbreaks of yellow fever during the 1870s reached cities further inland that were connected through 3 The microbiological revolution of the nineteenth century inspired new visual metaphors for disease such as anthropomorphic germs and grotesque bacteria (see "Visual Culture"). 4 Arthur Mervyn criticizes both the merchants who prosper from slavery and a society that allows this. The threat of black revolution spreading to the United States as a direct result of slavery's aberrations is also broadly associated with a "fever." Charles Brockden Brown's aboli- tionist stance is even more emphatically expressed in his non-fiction writings, e.g., An Address to the Government (1803) (cf. Christophersen 108).</page><page sequence="5">Epidemie Iconographies 563 a growing system of rail transportation.5 The outbreaks culminated in the devas- tating 1878 epidemic during which about twenty thousand people, or 10 percent of the population, died in the lower Mississippi Valley. Yellow fever's horrifying symptoms- including jaundice, bleeding from nose and mouth, stool stained dark with blood, and copious black vomit- together with a fatality rate of 15 to 50 per- cent and higher, created panic and fear incomparable to other diseases.6 With mortality rates claiming 8-10 percent of the population during major epi- demics, a certain congruence of perceived and actual threat can be asserted. The last major outbreak of yellow fever in the United States occurred in New Orleans in 1905. Today we know that yellow fever is an acute viral disease transmitted to humans by the bite of the female Aedes aegypti mosquito; it is noncontagious and cannot be spread through human contact. Although the connection between mos- quitoes and yellow fever was not proven before 1900, a comic and highly ironic illus- tration in Harper's Weekly from 1873 anthropomorphizes the mosquitoes as a mili- tary nuisance; they are planning their attack, leaning over the globe, and practicing their fiddles for their "summer campaign" (fig. 2). One might even argue that the sun emerges as an anthropomorphized trope- looking at the emerging catastrophe- in a repertoire of illustrations of pest and disease. The tragic irony of this illustration becomes apparent only in retrospect. The year 1873 saw one of the worst yellow fever epidemics, yet the mosquito as its culprit was not yet known.

Beyond medical and literary discourses of origin and treatment, depictions of yellow fever are a popular product of nineteenth-century culture in which the visual gained more and more prominence. The fascination with disease and its 5 On the role of the railroad, see Humphreys (28, 61). Margaret Humphreys also observes that a "new anxiety about regional disparities" between North and South could be detected in the writings of southern physicians (46). 6 Very high mortality rates, however, may indicate that milder cases were not recognized as yellow fever. Survivors of yellow fever gain lifetime immunity (Patterson 855).</page><page sequence="6">564 Ingrid Gessner visualization was not a new phenomenon in the nineteenth century and seems to have been ingrained in American culture from colonial times on, in a society always wavering between a general longing and perfectibility of health (and em- phasis on the purity of the body/nation) and a culture of fear (or anxiety about losing health). This 'culture of fear'- to borrow Barry Glassner's contemporary term- has been fed through various real and perceived threats. In 1863, for in- stance, smallpox-infected blankets were given to Native Americans in- what must be termed- bio-medical warfare.7 Invisible adversaries continued to stir anxieties in the nineteenth century, for example through 'undetected' immigrant carriers of disease such as the infamous Typhoid Mary, to the post-9/11 anthrax scare. Throughout the nineteenth century, when waves of mass immigration fostered an ethnic and cultural diversification of society, America anxiously sought to define itself against threats to the national body. Yellow fever, in turn, was known as 'strangers' disease' in the nineteenth-cen- tury United States because 'unacclimated' newcomers to the region seemed much more vulnerable to infection than longtime residents (Patterson 861). This, in turn, led to the stigmatization of those groups. Notions of health crises were figuratively linked to the period's experience of a highly complex layering of several social and political conditions such as slavery, immigration, urbanization, and expansion. Disease topics were naturally taken up by the leading illustrated newspapers of the second half of the nineteenth century, Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper and Harper's Weekly . When Leslie's and Harper's first appeared in 1855 and 1857 respectively, illustrations had already been appearing in magazines for nearly a hundred years (Mott 36-38, 208-10, 519-24). Yet the illustrations in the two pic- torials-first with woodcuts and later with half-tones from daguerreotypes and photography- set new standards in illustrated publishing in the United States.8 Harper's , whose weekly was also referred to as their "illustrated Bible," soon dominated the market because it produced the best pictures (Mott 192).9 To em- 7 Laurence Hauptman, Francis Flavin, and Constance Cappel even speak of a Native Amer- ican genocide in their studies (Hauptman 4; Flavin 1; Cappel; cf. also Banerjee 180-81). Stories of disease-infected blankets deliberately given to Native Americans have their roots in poison- garment tales of classical antiquity, most notably the Nessus shirt, the poisoned garment that killed Heracles. The plan of Lord Jeffrey Amherst to infect Indians with smallpox-infected blankets, taken from the corpses of British soldiers at Fort Pitt in 1863, is documented in a letter to Colonel Henry Bouquet. However, whether there was a direct command issued by Amherst is part of an ongoing controversy. Historians only agree that a smallpox epidemic did rage that summer (cf. Mayor 54-55, 57-58). 8 Many American magazines, in fact, were modeled closely after British periodicals. Harper's Weekly drew on the Illustrated London News , and Henry Carter (alias Frank Leslie) copied their characteristics for his own endeavors (Mott 130). His newspaper was first published on Decem- ber 15, 1855, as a small sixteen-page weekly illustrated with large striking woodcuts selling at ten cents an issue or four dollars for an annual subscription. The visuals usually followed the portrayed events by two weeks. Such a quick preparation and publication of pictures was a novelty made pos- sible by a woodcut technique introduced by Leslie. The illustrations were mostly of the sensational kind, including murders, prizefights, and disasters (such as the war in Nicaragua; cf. Mott 454, 130). 9 Harper's (1857-1916) was stronger editorially and more dignified than Leslie's Weekly . Mott ranks Harper's as of "distinctly higher quality than Leslie's " (44) and speaks of Leslie's "freshness and freedom," while Harper's is "better edited and better printed" (45).</page><page sequence="7">Epidemie Iconographies 565 Fig. 3: "Our Exposure to the Swill Milk Trade."

Subtitled A Journal of Civilization, Harper's Weekly was marketed as a "family newspaper" and "a first-class newspaper" (qtd. in Mott 470- 71) for an educated audience that resembled an emerging middle class. Gib Prettyman con- cludes that Harper's "subject matter blended aesthetics and news. Its purpose combined politics, education, and entertainment" (26). Leslie's content, on the other hand, was highly miscellaneous; it published serial fiction, travel sketches, and also crusades against local abuses. An example for the political influence of disease-related pictorial representations, and one of the most memorable episodes in the ear- ly history of Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspa- per , was the campaign against the "swill milk" abuse (see Moore). In May 1858 the paper at- tacked the shocking conditions in the dairies that supplied most of New York City with milk. Cows were fed on distillery waste, which stimulated milk production almost up until the poisoned cow's death. The cows developed sores and their tails rotted off. It was exactly those images of "diseased, stump-tailed, dying cows" (Mott 456) that Leslie's artists created that proved to be more effective than the sharp editorial comments (fig. 3). It took almost three years until the sale of milk from distillery-waste-fed cows was forbidden. About fifteen years later, Frank Leslie's again applied the by now successful sensationalist formula with regard to threat- ening health issues. The paper's yellow fever illustrations and reports informed its readers about the epidemic, prompted public donations, and helped secure the paper's circulation in economically dire times. Yellow Fever under the Touristic or Distant Gaze: An Aesthetics of the Destructive Sublime for Yellow Fever It is by [sympathy] that we enter into the concerns of others; that we are moved as they are moved, and are never suffered to be indifferent spectators of almost anything which men can do or suffer. For sympathy must be considered as a sort of substitution, by which we are put into the place of another man, and affected in many respects as he is affected. (Edmund Burke 44) In the 1870s and 1880s, Frank Leslie's and Harper's Weekly thus turned their journalistic gaze to yellow fever victims and their circumstances. In contrast to the medical gaze, which separates the patient's body from the patient's person</page><page sequence="8">566 Ingrid Gessner and which was theorized by Foucault in a French cultural context, yellow fever illustrations rely more on a 'touristic' gaze in the sense of providing insight into the culture of disease from a safe distance. The pictures represent a virtual tour of diseased America and enable viewers to participate in the journeys undertaken by illustrators and reporters to document the epidemic. What was the effect of the (removed) viewer's gaze? The experience often pictured in yellow fever illustrations is not only the suffer- ing of the sick body but also the moment of death or dying. In this way the illustra- tions depict the experience of disease, sometimes at the sublime moment of death or shortly after it. They evoke a fearful awe and may also be read under Edmund Burke's contemporaneously revived and adapted paradigm of an 'aesthetics of the sublime,' a theory that had defined artistic impact with regard to its effect on the viewer, calculating that through the viewer's dissociation from the perceived pain there is enjoyment to be found in suffering. In other words, Burke carefully distin- guished the sublime from the beautiful and instead associated it with the feeling of terror (Gasché 25). With reference to Burke, Oliver Jehle explains: This aesthetic affect that arises when contemplating a tragic image leads to the para- doxical phenomenon that the enjoyment received by the viewer of the tragic object in- creases in proportion to the vehemence of the existential threat with which he is visually confronted. [...] [T]he viewer experience^] pleasure because he believes himself to be secure and able to withdraw from the aesthetic horror and return unscathed. (91) In regard to fictional representations, this rational operation- to compare one's own condition to that of the recipient- has been described as a delight in distance ( Distanzlust ). While these nineteenth-century illustrations fictionalize the experience, the degree of their fictionalization {Fiktionsgrad)- or their relative representation of reality- also determines their moral and political implications. The reason for the creation of the yellow fever illustrations is not in the first degree aesthetic but aimed at sensation as well as the economic success of the paper. Matthew Rubery explains that "the sensational elements of the press were a crucial means by which audiences engaged with the world through sentimental narratives designed to elic- it an emotional response" (504). Newspaper reporters and illustrators from Frank Leslie's and Harper's Weekly were explicitly sent to New Orleans and Memphis during the epidemics to illustrate moving scenes from the yellow fever devasta- tion. They created pictures that 'tell a story' and as such strive to represent a ver- sion of the suffering experienced in the southern United States (the major location of yellow fever epidemics): and the readers reacted to it.10 In 1878 a double-page spread series of dramatic yellow fever illustrations in Frank Leslie's represented graphic depictions of suffering ("Yellow Fever Visita- tion" 56-57). In some of these chaotic scenes, readers beheld sick and dying people 10 See, for example, fig. 33 in Orvell's American Photography , a cover illustration from Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper showing the horrible treatment of prisoners at Anderson- ville. The original photographs were translated as engravings. Orvell comments that "the artist inevitably removed the stark texture of reality from the images, leaving them less shocking than the actual photos" (65).</page><page sequence="9">Epidemie Iconographies 567 on park benches and in the shrubs beside railroad tracks like wounded animals, with physicians refusing to go near or people fleeing the scene (figs. 4-5). 11 Frank Leslie's "Two Tramps Dying in Jackson Square, New Orleans" is a highly theat- ricalized representation of the yellow fever scene. The inclusion of a man flee- ing from the dying acts as an implied spectator to the staged scene. Signifiers of disease that are graphically depicted within the accompanying text- "the hor- rible black vomit"- are absent in the lithograph. The picture bears witness not primarily to the ravages of yellow fever but to its sentimental response and its re-representation for bourgeois consumption. As the implied spectator flees the scene in disgust- not to get help, but to preserve himself- removal is depicted as a strategy to evade the disease. Interestingly, the subordination of the image of disease to sentimental norms is not conducted by the 'sayable'- the accompany- ing text is quite specific about the disease- but by the 'seeable,' which sanitizes the graphic newspaper text for media consumption.12 However, these sentimental pictures, with people dying in the squares or in "out-of-the-way places" ("Yellow Fever Visitation" 59), also destabilize ethical notions of how the sick should be treated. By examining other people's cruel and gruesome experiences, readers and viewers become more conscious of their selves. Newspaper texts and illustra- tions confronted readers with the documentary intensity of direct observation and at the same time presented a wide variety of yellow fever experiences of different classes, genders, and ages (cf. Prettyman 29). They provide visual evidence of the epidemics and produce coherent narratives for public consumption. In this sense the pictures serve as a means to bear witness, symbolized on some of the illus- trations by the presence of the reporter. He is, for example, carefully approach- ing (with his head drawn) the dying woman beside the railroad tracks, and he is entering a sick room on Jefferson Street. In doing so he takes over a role similar to the examining physician (who refuses to go near the woman dying beside the tracks), yet the reporter's examination of the scenes- because of its intended pub- lication-takes on a wider public dimension. The pictures, often surpassed in pictorial detail by the accompanying texts, are revolting and, as such, satisfy voyeurism; yet they are mainly effective in arousing public (communal) feeling. This is similar to nineteenth-century sentimental fic- tion whose cultural work, as Jane Tompkins has asserted, is "an act of persuasion aimed at defining social reality" (141) by "presenting an affective alternative that not only gave political actions their emotional significance, but beyond that, inti- mately linked individual bodies to the national body" (4). This is also a testament to just how visualized sentimental literature had become. In their composition, Frank Leslie's pictures build on the habits of the viewers, employing the familiar forms of emotional style and sentimental formulas with suffering children and women and domestic settings in complete disarray representing a loss of order. 11 The accompanying news report further explains: "Of course, there are some cases of in- humanity in the more rural districts, where the scare is greatest. A correspondent recently, in journeying by rail, saw at Grand Junction, Tenn., a lady from Memphis alone in the weeds by the side of the track, dying of yellow fever, and three doctors within fifty yards, who refused to go near" ("Yellow Fever Visitation" 59). 12 I am grateful to Christopher Łukasik for his astute comments regarding the illustration.</page><page sequence="10">568 Ingrid Gessner Fig. 4: "Two Tramps Dying in Jackson Square."

Pictures of childhood were popular for their ability to arouse feelings of affection and protection of a state perceived as separate and innocent. Deathbed scenes equally drew from the sentimental storehouse and allowed for the exploration of pathos. Since strong or exaggerated physical gestures- pathos formulas in aes- thetic representations- are recognized by most viewers, they enable an easy iden- tification of the expressed emotion (cf. Schulz 52). On one tableau a woman twists in agony, her husband and at least two of her six children are dead and spread across the bed and floor, while one child seems to be praying and a boy looks to the doorway where help in the form of a reporter is entering (fig. 6). The absence of any other assistance and the boy's imploring look intensifies the presence of the reporter, who represents the only opportunity they have to avoid their deaths going unnoticed and unseen. The visual narra- tive is even surpassed by the graphic description of the reporter, who professes to become "sick to think of [the sight]." The copious black vomit, which takes on a stigmatic function that marks the diseased individual, is mentioned only in the copy text:13 "[T]he black vomit spattered all over the bed and the room. The mother was dying, and the horrible black vomit- it looks like coffee grounds- was running out of her mouth into the face and breast of one of the children that lay on the floor by the bed. Ugh!" ("Yellow Fever Visitation" 59). Avoiding any kind of medical jargon, the analogy visually describes the yellow fever experience to those who have never seen the disease. Yet the symptoms remain absent from the visual representation. 13 "[SJtigma exists when elements of labeling, stereotyping, separation, status loss, and dis- crimination occur in a power situation that allows them" write Link and Phelan (363) referring to sociologist Erving Goffman's work (Goffman).</page><page sequence="11">Epidemie Iconographies 569 îFig. 6: "A Sad Scene in a Jefferson Street Dwelling, Memphis."

A more stately (and aesthetically more pleasing) deathbed scene is portrayed in another lithograph (fig. 7). A seemingly well-off but nevertheless sick woman lies in bed, bemoaned by her husband and children, and attended to by a physi- cian and a black servant. From the accompanying text we learn that the woman, identified as Mrs. Zonane, was not told by her doctor about her yellow fever plight until shortly before her death. Her five children were discouraged from kissing her good-bye but did so nevertheless. The text describes their lips as "stained with that horrible stream of death" ("Yellow Fever Visitation" 59), yet none of them caught the fever- following the conventional narrative of redemption. The death- bed scene, widely used as a cultural trope at the time and employed here in Frank Leslie's , presents a "version of the ethic of sacrifice [...] that the highest human calling is to give one's life for another" (Tompkins 128).14 In New Orleans, Sisters of Charity took care of those sick and dying of yellow fever (fig. 8). One picture shows them in attendance of the most innocent victims, the children at St. Vincent's Infant Asylum, many of whose parents had already died from the fever. The large hall-like room full of little cots represents the ex- tent of the calamity, and the accompanying report gives the number of the sick: seventy out of 200 children. Their pinched bodies and grotesque black-rimmed eyes are marked by the disease. The picture focuses on the nursing care of the nuns: feeding, fanning, rocking, and hand-holding are represented, and a physi- cian talks to a child in the background. There's solace in the illustration, yet also desperation in light of the many suffering children. 14 Tompkins elaborates: "The power of the dead or the dying to redeem the unregenerate is a major theme of nineteenth-century popular fiction and religious literature. Mothers and children are thought to be uniquely capable of this work" (128).</page><page sequence="12">570 Ingrid Gessner Fig. 8: "Children in St. Vincent's Infant Asylum."

For corresponding color plate, see the supplement. One year later, a front-page illustration from Frank Leslie's on September 20, 1879, confronted its readers with a shadowy, bare room in which a sick man writhes in pain while an equally worn-out woman, with a barefoot child clinging to her apron, opens the door to admit a Sister of Charity (fig. 9). This lithograph from a sketch by D. B. Moise is a typical threshold situation employing the familiar forms of emotional style and formulas used in Christian art, such as the nun's bless- ing hand reminiscent of a guardian angel figure. The package in her other hand speaks of sustenance and relief. Moise's illustration is structured along the binary opposition between inside and outside, darkness and light; the sick are contrasted to the healthy savior. Interestingly, the figure of hope is a female nurse and not a male physician as in some of Leslie's critical depictions of representatives of the profession, e. g., doctors who refuse to go near the infected, as in the picture of the woman dying beside the railroad tracks (fig. 5). The candle on the table is blown out and illustrates the fading life of the sick man; the shadows equally portend death. The visual impact- the 'story' the front-page illustration tells- is enhanced in the accompanying article which, first of all, establishes it as "a scene from real life" ("Memphis Under Quarantine Rule" 43). The reader learns that the family had to sell their possessions for the provision of food and medicine, since the un- fortunate sick man could no longer work. An illustrated book seems to be one of the items left from happier times, yet it lies discarded on the floor, indicating that trust in the written word has been abandoned. The report describes: The terrible shadow of a terrible death is in that apartment. The wife now fears for her child, her famine-stricken child, who, already in the nausea of sickness, has ceased to clamor for food.

In the doorway stands the messenger of consolation, the gentle messenger who will pour oil upon the bleeding wounds, and who will repeat the great grand lesson of the Good Samaritan. ("Memphis Under Quarantine Rule" 43) The description- like the illustration- also provides an example of sentimental and religious pathos. It comes hardly as a surprise that an outpouring of sympathy, concern, and aid was stimulated by these illustrations as documented in figure 10, with packages for yellow fever victims piling up.15 Evidence of a Northern popular consciousness and particularly female willingness to donate is also given on the front page of an issue that contains a variety of reactions to the yellow fever crisis (fig. 11). It shows women and children, including a black woman throwing money into a contribution box. Men are sketched only in the background. The compas- sionate sentiment is mirrored in the captions and the accompanying news reports.

While the somewhat religiously inflated but realistic-sensationalist depictions presuppose the empathy of the readers to control the disease, two prints from the late 1880s use a different strategy and represent disease in a metaphorical way. Matthew Somerville Morgan's drawing illustrates the 1888 yellow fever epidemic 15 Two popular novellas of the 1870s by Wesley Bradshaw, Angel Agnes and Mattie Stephen- son , have the respective heroines read about yellow fever victims in the news to stimulate their rushing to the rescue).</page><page sequence="14">572 Ingrid Gessner Fig. 11: "New York City- The Great Metropolis Heeding the Cry of Distress from the Fever- Stricken South."

The yellow fever demon, with "Yellow Jack" written across his chest, fol- lows the visual language of allegorical representations of disease. Given the skull- like features of the beast, one is also reminded of the British print of "The torrid zone, or, blessings of Jamaica" (fig. 3). The full lips allude to those known from blackface minstrelsy and as such point toward the constructed blackness of the disease (black vomit; presumed black immunity; African/Caribbean source of the disease). Furthermore, the animalistic legs and talons turn Yellow Jack into a hy- brid non-human figure symbolizing evil. The demon clutches Florida's throat and 16 The Jacksonville area experienced a devastating epidemic in the summer of 1888. Patter- son estimates the deaths in the hundreds (858). The epidemic came from Cuba and had raged in Key West in 1887; the following year it moved up the west coast to Tampa and across to Jackson- ville. Frank Leslie's frequently published reports on the epidemic between August and October of 1888 ("Yellow Fever in Florida"; "The Yellow-Fever Ravages"; "The Plague-Stricken South"; "Memphis Under Quarantine Rule"; "Under the Shadow of the Plague"; "Ancient and Modern Plagues").</page><page sequence="15">Epidemie Iconographies 573 Fig. 12: Matthew Somerville Morgan, "Per- sonification of Yellow Fever Dragging Down Florida." Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper c. 1888. Gray Library Tallahassee, FL. her crotch with sharp talons. The sexu- alization and metaphoric curtailment of the reproductive organs add to the sen- sational character of the picture.17 The triangular, pieta-style arrange- ment of the group relies on a dichoto- mous arrangement of good against evil. The shadowy demon is contrasted with the bright whiteness of the good 'mother' Columbia, the female personification of the American nation wearing the Phry- gian cap of freedom. As the once-beau- tiful Florida is sliding from her lap, Co- lumbia seems to be beckoning for help from outside the frame. It is not clear whether her foot is caught in the thorny underbrush, where a broken "Trade" box lies on the ground and is about to be overgrown by thorns. 'Trade' further- more represents the assumed reason for how yellow fever reached Florida and also shows that trade suffered as a result of the epidemic as well. Vile vapors en- sue from the demon's mouth; they omi- nously try to reach and grab those fleeing the epidemic (in the right background). The odors emanating from the yellow fever beast are deadly, which points toward a belief in atmospheric transmission and contagiousness of the disease. Hope lies solely in the nation, or in a national effort personified by Columbia, who hovers on top of and above the vapors. An equally nationalistic agenda underlies the wood engraving "At the Gates," which was published in Harper's Weekly in 1885 (fig. 13). The picture is another example of a metaphorical representation of disease that employs a simple good versus evil dichotomy. In this case, the shrouded specters representing cholera, yellow fever, and smallpox recoil in fear in the shadow of the gate. Their capes and hoods, as well as their crouching posture, marks them as secretive, sick, and foreign. A bright and radiant angel faces the evil group. With a star above her head, she represents the United States, holding a sword and a shield emblazoned 17 Regarding the sexual connotation, it seems interesting to note the relatively low inhibi- tion threshold ( Peinlichkeitsschwelle/Schamschwelle ) of the picture (see Elias). In the case of yellow fever images, the borderline between what could be depicted and what might have been unseemly is somewhat hard to pinpoint, with the exception of a general avoidance of naked- ness or explicit sexuality at least in the realistically portrayed victims in newspaper illustrations. Patients, even if in pain, are mostly tucked underneath sheets. However, the graphic depictions of the painful yellow fever experience seem to point toward a comparatively low threshold re- garding appalling illustrations. Sensationalist detail, such as distorted suffering figures, satisfies voyeuristic enjoyment and also stirs the capacity for empathy.</page><page sequence="16">574 Ingrid Gessner Fig. 13: "At the Gates." Harper's Weekly 5 Sept. 1885. Images from the History of Medi- cine (NLM). with the word "cleanliness," and fear- lessly blocking the gate as cholera, yel- low fever, and smallpox attempt to make their way through the quarantine barrier at the Port of New York. "At the Gates" suggests a liminal sit- uation with quasi-religious undertones: the gates might symbolize those of heav- en and hell, of life and death, of sick and healthy. The shadow cast by the angel connects the figure with the personified diseases, thus seemingly dissolving the binarism. The threshold situation also points to the demographic contexts of the United States, which had become an immigrant nation at the time of the illus- tration's publication and as such had to deal with a growing xenophobia. In this sense, the subtitle "Our safety depends upon official vigilance," a clear call for more control, might also allude to the Public Health System or Ellis Island inspectors. One of the main reasons for the development of public health institutions in the nineteenth century, most promi- nently the U.S. Public Health Service, was actually due to continued yellow fever epidemics (Humphreys, Yellow Fever 47). Although the technique and quasi-religious connotation is different, the means of controlling the disease that is suggested in the two latter lithographs is reminiscent of earlier medieval understandings of disease and death, i.e., the Grim Reaper. The (figurative) disease is controlled by stopping it "at the gates." Another means to control disease is also promoted in the "At the Gates" engrav- ing, namely hygiene or cleanliness. By mid-century, southern physicians began to doubt the 'local origin' theory of yellow fever when the earliest cases in east coast cities "could all be traced to ships arriving from yellow fever-infested Caribbean ports" (Humphreys 24). The paradigm of yellow fever's transportability subse- quently became more and more accepted, especially in the last two decades of the nineteenth century when research on other diseases helped formulate a "germ theory of yellow fever" (Humphreys 25). Since the role of 'filth' in the evolution of the disease remained to be proven, sanitarians often failed to convince legislators that sanitation could help eradicate the disease; sanitary reform remained second to quarantine management (Humphreys 54, 57). In this respect, it is interesting that the illustration promotes both measures: quarantine as well as the more un- popular calls for better sanitation.</page><page sequence="17">Epidemie Iconographies 575 Capturing Yellow Fever on Camera Compared to illustrations, photographs are often automatically grouped into a category of higher verisimilitude. Few photographic examples depict the human dimension of the yellow fever experience. Even in the late nineteenth century, when a larger corpus of photographs is available, yellow fever photography re- mains scarce. In the pictures that include people, the hospital setting seems to be the location of choice. Stemming from a period when research on other diseases helped formulate theories of the origin of yellow fever, and taken shortly before and after the vector in transmission could be proven, photographs provide inter- esting evidence of a transitional period in medical practices and in understanding epidemic disease. Similar to the sentimental newspaper illustrations, they primar- ily convey a rather sanitized and non-infectious version of yellow fever that allows viewers to regard- from a safe distance- other people's pain. Susan Sontag has reflected on the "innumerable opportunities a modern life supplies for regarding- at a distance , through the medium of photography- other people's pain" (11; emphasis mine). In Regarding the Pain of Others, she describes the enduring ethical dimension of photographs and pleads for the atrocious imag- es to haunt us: "Even if they are only tokens, and cannot possibly encompass most of the reality to which they refer, they still perform a vital function" (102). Sontag insists that "[s]omething becomes real by being photographed." It becomes real "to those who are elsewhere, following it as 'news'" (19). 18 Marita Sturken and Lisa Cartwright have expressed it similarly: "The meaning of a photograph is thus derived from the belief that it has a referent in the real." The "cultural meaning" of photographs, they write, "is derived in large part from their indexical meaning as a trace of the real" (140). In other words, the experience and narratives of the individual viewer determine the photograph's cultural meaning. Yellow fever pictures were taken by U.S. Army photographers to record treat- ment and prevention efforts in Cuba and Panama. A photograph taken during the Spanish-American War shows a yellow fever patient sleeping on an army cot in a makeshift tent hospital in Siboney, Cuba (fig. 14). With his pinched face and emaciated arms, a deathbed connotation is plausible. Yet elements typical in por- trayals of the disease are absent. Light shines through the tent from outside be- hind the patient's head; his face is turned away from the viewer in a somewhat unnatural position that draws attention to his dominant nose and open mouth. The head's position forms a triangle. This may allude to what is known as the 18 Sontag rejects iconoclastic perceptions of images as mere spectacles and discards assump- tions that what can be seen by means of photographic imagery only appears to be real. Judith Butler has further qualified Sontag's view in some of her recent writing (see "Photography," Krieg und Affekt , and Frames of War). Especially in the chapter titled "Survivability, Vulner- ability, Affect" Butler points toward the increasingly interpretive character of photographs- including those with a documentary character- with regard to choice of subject, camera angle, focus, and lighting. She also claims that photos do not automatically include facts or truths, even if an inherent moral claim seems to suggest otherwise, and she argues against Sontag that specific modes of representations and culturally determined practices of reception define what becomes fact (cf. also Meyer 365-66).</page><page sequence="18">576 Ingrid Gessner 'triangle of death' ( Totendreieck ), a triangle-shaped area underneath the nose and around the mouth which is, when turning white, said to indicate a soon approach- ing death. The drink on the table to his side is covered (against mosquitoes), while his body is not. The militaristic context of the photograph, taken during a war in which more people died of diseases than under enemy fire (see Cirillo), speaks for a scientific-didactic approach to controlling yellow fever, namely by documenting the cases. Fig. 14: "Yellow Fever Patient in Hospital at Siboney, Cuba, July 1898." Images from the History of Medicine (NLM). For corresponding plate, see the supplement. It is worth considering whether the distance generated by the sanitized depic- tion of the disease and the sentimentalization of the sight as a deathbed scene informs the presumably more 'real' photographs of the disease. In other words, this gaze generates precisely the distance that photography- by virtue of its me- dium-reproduces. The distance of the photograph is temporal, the knowledge that the image has already passed and the figure in the bed is undoubtedly dead by the time the picture was published. The evidentiary impact of the 'real' here is mitigated by its distance. Compared to figure 14, the photograph from a yellow fever hospital in Havana, Cuba, (taken one year later, in 1899) is striking for its de-individuation of the patients, who are arranged in a seemingly endless row of cots (fig. 15). The fact that only a few patients are reclining and the majority are sitting on their beds</page><page sequence="19">Epidemie Iconographies 577 points toward the convalescent status of most hospital inhabitants. It may also point toward the medico-military curtailment of the disease that was hoped to be accomplished by establishing the U.S. Army Yellow Fever Commission and by dispatching Major Walter Reed and his team to Cuba in May 1900 to conduct experiments to prove that yellow fever was transmitted through the female Aedes aegypti mosquito. Fig. 15: "Patients in Yellow Fever Hospital, Havana, Cuba c. 1899." Library of Congress. The row of recovering patients appears in stark contrast to a photograph that shows an individual patient locked away in a mosquito-proof cage (fig. 16). Al- though no date for the photograph is given, it can be dated to the early 1900s, sometime after Reed's discovery of the yellow fever vector that initiated measure- ments such as use of mosquito netting and systematic elimination of mosquito breeding grounds.19 This photograph was taken at Gorgas Hospital, Ancon, in the Panama Canal Zone. The ominous black cage that contains the patient is con- trasted with the smoky white light on the left side of the picture. It both speaks for 19 According to Stephen Greenberg from the History of Medicine Division (National Li- brary of Medicine) it could not have been taken before 1904, since that is the year the United States took over the French hospital in Ancon. The hospital was extensively rebuilt in 1915, creating an 'old' hospital and 'new' hospital. The name was changed to Gorgas Hospital in 1928, however, so I think we should conclude that the picture was taken after 1928 (Greenberg).</page><page sequence="20">578 Ingrid Gessner a stigmatization of the diseased patient and illustrates the fear of infection. The netted cage prevents transmission as mosquitoes are barred from feeding on the infected patient. Considering the effort it took to build the cages also places ad- ditional emphasis on the individual sufferer. He is not part of a homogenous mass of patients as in figure 15, but he is kept in an individual cage. Yet the practice does not comfort or cure the victim. While the patient's face rests in the shadows and is hardly discernible, the crossed arms behind the head point toward a rather relaxed state of someone who is clearly not lying upon his deathbed. Yellow fever has finally been conquered, although it still remains a threat that needs to be physically contained. Fig. 16.

Conclusion: The Visual Functionalization of Yellow Fever In order to make sense of visual practices and patterns of pictures that do not easily lend themselves as material for creating a unifying myth, looking at yellow fever illustrations from the perspective of affect studies proves valuable. On a gen- eral level the nineteenth-century newspapers turn yellow fever victims into objects of attention, making the yellow fever experience understandable and accessible to</page><page sequence="21">Epidemie Iconographies 579 wide audiences. Offering means to control the epidemic in the sense of curtailing it were primarily relegated to metaphorical depictions, some of which harbor under- lying educational intentions, such as promoting quarantine and "cleanliness." The allegorical yellow fever demons or specters of other diseases are horrifying and repulsive, and they play with contagious fears as well as xenophobic tendencies to control disease. The images of actual sufferers, on the other hand, have the capaci- ty to arouse sympathy for the victims. Oscillating between pity and disgust, sympa- thy and antipathy, viewers experience their own vulnerability by means of medially transmitted pain. Illustrations and accompanying text enable readers to empathize with the victims and generate a spectatorial self-consciousness about caring for the diseased and encouraging acts of benevolence. Despite possible tendencies for self- protection, or because of varying degrees of a capacity for empathy, readers at least familiarize themselves with the experience of yellow fever through- what I have termed- the touristic or distant gaze. The military photographs of yellow fever victims also convey- at a distance- other people's pain. The pictures do not show heavily distorted victims or the characteristic black vomit, but sleeping or reclining patients. The invisible origin of the scenes- the disease- remains unseen, perhaps unrepresentable. It is replaced by what can be shown in an illustration and in the late nineteenth century by the perceived indexical nature of the photographic me- dium, which also hides as much as it shows. The representations from the yellow fever epidemics of the nineteenth century furthermore embody striking contradictions between the aestheticization of what could be put in the category of the abject- the suffering but still beautiful mother and the deeply vulnerable sick man- and the moral implications emerging from voyeuristic engagements with disease, death, and suffering that continue to call for close examination. As witnesses to abjection and calamity, they demand a po- litical rather than an aesthetic response. W. J.T. Mitchell has equally insisted on the political task of visual culture, i.e., "to perform critique without the comfort of iconoclasm" (170), and Jacques Rancière has pointed toward understanding "the image as discourse encoding a history" (11). Just because these epidemic pic- tures are attractive in an odd way (and had mass appeal), we should not disregard them as merely sensational, commercial, or sentimental, but read them in political terms and continue to engage with them and the emotional and cultural processes they stimulate.
