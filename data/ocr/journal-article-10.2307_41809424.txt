From Rossetti's Hawthorn pots to Whistler's Peacock Room, 'blue and white' features in both the home decoration manuals and the satire of the day. It was that which Oscar Wilde famously could not live up to, it was the subject of many a George Du Maurier cartoon and it was the 'early Oriental' which Reginald Bunthorne sang of in Gilbert and Sullivan's Patience . Aside from this obsession with Chinese porcelain and the humour it inspired, the contemporary ceramic industry in Britain was booming. The 'chinamania' that had initially encompassed the fanatical pursuit of antiques and bric-a-brac, was extended to modern production. Design was entering a golden age, with decorative art objects essential to the creation of the newly desirable artistic interior. In the haze of blue and white collecting, the influence of 'arts for arts sake' Aestheticism on British ceramic design of the period can be difficult to define. Certainly, Aestheticism coincided with, and was arguably the occasion for, a general explosion in the very idea of the decorative arts and their affect on the consumer. As Oscar Wilde suggested in The Critic as Artist : 'The art that is frankly decorative is the art to live with. It is, of all visible arts, the one art that creates in us both mood and temperament.'1 FIG.10 'The Bicyclist', earthenware with coloured glazes, designed by George Tin worth, Doûlton &amp; Co, circa 1885 . Private collection © Hundey Hedworth. This article will argue that aside from the motifism that typified many mass-produced ceramics of the period (design medleys of fans, sunflowers etc.), modern Aesthetic ceramics were about a new mood in the decorative arts: the expression of personality and the demonstration of individuality in home decoration amidst an atmosphere of creativity that freed producers as well as consumers to be artistic. Ceramics of the period are not only experimental and confident but are also, above all, humorous. They demonstrate a playfulness and self-awareness, fuelled by the increasingly artistic climate that although, in many ways, was defined by its association with satire, was also primarily inspired by other cultures and historic periods. What evolved was a stylistic eclecticism that acknowledged that wit could be an important aspect of design, rather than merely a response to it. Any examination of the use of humour in ceramic design would not be complete without an overview of the satirical landscape of the 1870s and 1880s. The relationship (and it was a relationship) between aestheticism and satire has been well documented. Lionel Lambourne points out that 'the remarkable thing about the satirical comment 59</page><page sequence="3">THE DECORATIVE ARTS SOCIETY JOURNAL 2010 upon the Aesthetic Movement is that it is remembered more vividly than the subject satirized'.2 Railing against affectation and elite fashion, the George Du Maurier cartoons for Punch are perhaps the filter through which we have come to view the subject - a dichotomy of, on the one hand, frail aesthetes pining over their Kangxi and, on the other, a robust industry of mockery and fun which engaged many of the Aesthetic practitioners themselves. With Oscar Wilde, the most conspicuous advocate, treading a path of self-parody, proponents of Aestheticism could not easily adopt a position of 'us and them', subject and satirist. Indeed, the department store Liberty &amp; Co, which throughout the period remained a serious destination for any artistic consume^, was openly involved in the costume production for the aesthete-lampooning, opera Patience , and Richard D'Oyley Carte, who staged the light opera, also organised Oscar Wildes FIGS1 and 2 View, front and bac', 'Aesthetic teapot', glazed parian, Royal Worcester, designed by 'Budge', modelled by James Hadley, 1882. Courtesy of Fine Art Museums of San Francisco. lecture tour of America during which Wilde defined himself in relation to adverse commentary and took an amused challenge in establishing a dialogue with the satirical. One of the most iconic comments on the Aesthetic Movement was produced in glazed parian rather than in song or print. Royal Worcester's 'Aesthetic teapot' of 1882, with the base inscribed Tearful consequences through the laws of Natural Selection and the Evolution of living up to one's teapot', satirised both Wilde's words and Darwin's theory of evolution (Figs 1 and 2).3 The costumes depicted on the teapot are reminiscent of those used in the production of Patience at the Savoy Theatre in 1881 - for which it was possibly commissioned. The use of a teapot as a form is itself significant. As Anne Anderson suggests, the teapot, belonging to the domestic sphere, 'was made to appeal to women, and became a barometer of fashion but its comedic potential was also quickly spotted, the novelty teapot assuming many bizarre and often anthropomorphized forms - teapots can be funny.'4 Here the humour relies on the blurring of gender boundaries as the male and female figures merge 6o</page><page sequence="4">THE DECORATIVE ARTS SOCIETY JOURNAL 2010 FIG.3 (above) Teapot, earthenware with majolica glaze, Mintoti, circa 1874 . Private Collection © Huntley Hedworth. into one on an object that was itself the epitome of socialised feminine behaviour. Although the 'Aesthetic teapot' was probably a limited edition in-joke, such teatime humour went mainstream with, as Anderson goes on to point out, Minton's majolica teapots of monkeys clutching nuts and Chinamen with snakes (Fig. 3). The 'Aesthetic teapot', shape no. 870, was modelled by James Hadley but signed by 'Budge'. Very little is known about 'Budge', an interesting, albeit limited, designer who was able to veer from the bitingly satirical to the gently playful. The only clue to his identity is a design for a plate in the archives of the Worcester Porcelain Museum, which came to light during the move of the Royal Worcester design department library to the newly built museum archive store during* 2000-2002 (Fig. 4). The design is signed 'Budge' on the front and, on FIGA (below) Design for plate, 'Touslesgouts' by 'Budge', Royal Worcester, circa 1882. © WWRD 6i</page><page sequence="5">THE DECORATIVE ARTS SOCIETY JOURNAL 2010 62</page><page sequence="6">THE DECORATIVE ARTS SOCIETY JOURNAL 2010 the reverse, inscribed with the name 'Henry Crewe/75 Upper Berkeley Street/ Portman Square/ London W', from which can be traced a listing of 'Author &amp; Artist - Decorative' in the 1891 Census.5 The design, which was never put into production, is a veritable grammar of ornament, with Celtic knots and renaissance arabesques vying for space with strutting peacocks and Egyptian sphinxes. Titled 'Pourtouslesgouts' (for all tastes) it is a tongue-in-cheek approach to the design eclecticism permeating the decorative arts. Along with the teapot it suggests the influence of Aesthetic associated humour on contemporary design, but also demonstrates the freedom of the designer to produce innovative work of a witty character. In terms of the influence of Japan on Aestheticism, Budgç again has something to offer. In the Minton archive resides a series of twelve drawings for tiles which were similarly never put into production but are indicative of a general mood in ceramic design (Fig. 5). Budge was possibly hoping to cash in on his success with Royal Worcester since the tiles are a playful look at the relationship between East and West as embodied by a Japanese lady in a kimono and a Western woman in Aesthetic dress. The series takes the viewer through a narrative that sees the two women separately appreciating lilies, meeting, quarrelling and finally reconciling in a domestic setting, partaking in an 'Aesthetic tea'. The tone of the tiles is humorous but not waspish and hints at a prevailing amused affection for the movement rather than outright hostility. Intended for display in the home, and themselves Aesthetic in style, the tiles represent the shift of Aestheticism into the realm of self-consciousness and the packaging of the movement for the consumer, who would have laughed at Du Maurier's cartoons whilst desiring to emulate the fashionable Aesthetic style in their own home. The fact that the tile narrative unites Eastern and Western Aestheticism in a domestic interior locates the Movement firmly in that realm, as has been explored in many recent studies6. Certainly, concepts of the 'home', and its inseparability from the Movement, are key to unlocking the increasing use of humour in contemporary Aesthetic ceramic design. The promotion of the 'artistic home', championed by the likes of Mrs Ha weis, often positioned itself as a reaction against the amorality of Aestheticism whilst defining itself in relation to it. In many respects this 'second wave', aware of the flaws of the movement but desirous to preserve the new found artistic freedoms borne of it, is the site at which consumer desire for contemporary ceramics can most comfortably be placed - amidst the vogue for expressing individuality through decoration. As Deborah Cohen summarises of Mrs Ha weis' intentions, 'Houses should reflect moods; they should FIG.5 ( opposite ) Designs for tiles by 'Budge', Minton , circa 1882 . © WWRD FIG.6 (right) Monkey with vase, earthenware with majolica glaze, Burmantoftš, circa 1885.

Pottery, with its unsophisticated beauty, became a symbol of the biblical, magical potter, connected to the earth through his/her manipulation of the most basic raw material, an idea that was itself soon to be turned on its head by comic renderings such as Burmantofts' monkey potter (Fig. 6). Nonetheless, giants of industry, such as Doulton and Minton, were quick to open art pottery departments to cater for the demand for original, individually decorated wares. B^sed mainly in London, these departments not only established creative centres away from the conservatism of Staffordshire, but also blurred the boundaries between mass industry and the small artisan ventures that had sprung up throughout Britain, in response to an Arts and Crafts return of the artist/maker to the centre of production. Doulton, beloved of the home decoration advice manuals, immediately recognised the fetishisation of the human touch as a useful marketing tool and Doulton Lambeth wares were extensively marked and inscribed. Henry Doulton regularly boasted of the creative freedom allowed his employees, resulting in no two pots being identical, and the stoneware revival, again championed by the firm, saw a return to an appreciation of rougher clays. This aesthetic in turn lent itself to the kind of sculptural humour best seen in the work of George Tin worth for Doulton but also in the leering creations of Burmantofts, the Martin Brothers, and, later in the century, Blanche Vulliamy, who was seen as an exemplar of the spirited 'new women' designers.8 Such work catered for the growing vogue for the grotesque that saw the humorous ceramic into the twentieth century. Of course, the malleability of clay meant that ceramic was the perfect medium for manipulating the contorted expressions and impish grins of this increasingly popular aesthetic (Fig. 7). From the satirical, to the playful, to the grotesque, the late nineteenth century witnessed a démocratisation of humour in ceramic design that was fuelled, in part, by an art pottery movement that was at once earthy and artistic. With high-end makers such as Minton and Royal Worcester incorporating humour into their work, amusing ceramics were elevated from the parlour to the show-room. No longer the preserve of the cottage ornament or functional object, a sense of freedom and fun was infiltrating ceramics at all levels, bolstered by the public fascination with the ceramic medium and the potential of ceramics to be all things to all people. As passionately argued by 4 An Artist' in a Pottery &amp; Glass Trades' Review article: Pottery. . .is a paradox. It is undistinguished and altogether lovely; it is vulgar and by association ugly; it is wonderfully sacred and apart, and unconsciously near and familiar.9 64</page><page sequence="8">THE DECORATIVE ARTS SOCIETY JOURNAL 2010 FIG.8 (above) Vases, earthenware , slip decorated , designed by E W Godwin and William Watt, maker unknown, circa 1877 © Victoria and Albert Museum, London. Pottery, from the more autobiographical ceramics of Tinworth to the new vogue for amateur china painting so successfully launched by Howell &amp; James, had an availability that allowed individuals to express themselves, whether through production, purchase or display. High profile designers working across different ipedia also found ceramics an accommodating vehicle for new ideas and the expression of sentiments perhaps unsuitable for the more expensive, inaccessible decorative arts. This is nowhere better demonstrated than in the work of E W Godwin whose only surviving three dimensional ceramics are a pair of vases, one of which depicts a Godwin-designed side table, and beside it, in mock-Greek phonetics, the word 'Kawphyrite' (copyright), a reference to the widespread plagiarism of Godwins furniture (Figs 8 and 9).10 The vases, with theif yellow glaze and dark sgraffito lines, are distinctly Aesthetic in style and FIG. 9 (below) The oft-copied table, turned and joined mahogany, designed by E W Godwin, 1867-68 © Victoria and Albert Museum, London. 65</page><page sequence="9">THE DECORATIVE ARTS SOCIETY JOURNAL 2010 witty in design. They show a designer confident enough to make a joke and demonstrate the appeal of the ceramic medium: personal, accessible, adaptable. To use a pair of earthenware vases to make a protest against design imitation can also be seen as a comment on the link between ceramics and the decoration of the home: the individualism of art pottery versus the mass production of aesthetic-style wares. Aestheticism had itself become an industry and good design teamed with a self-awareness appears to have been the most original response. # # # By the last quarter of the nineteenth century ceramics had become a key part of contemporary interior decoration. As William John Loftie suggests in ^4 Plea for Art in the House , 'Every reader may not agree with me if I say that pictures ornament a house more than anything else, but that next to pictures I am inclined to place books. Most people would perhaps give precedence to China'. 11 What is perhaps most interesting in Lofties statement is the blurring of the boundaries between the fine and decorative arts in the pursuit of the ornamental. Paintings are regarded in the context of house adornment, books are valued for the artistic merits of their bindings, ceramics take on a decorative function that transcends any practical usage and all are mentioned in the same breath: the decorative end justifies the means. It is against a backdrop that, by the 1870s, allowed paintings, books and ceramics to take on an arguably interchangeable decorative role that humour in ceramic design becomes most prominent. As we have seen in Budge's designs, tiles, as a medium, offered a scope for pictorial narrative that in turn lent itself to humour. Tiles were practical and aesthetic, and could reach parts of the home that paintings could not, giving them a practical freedom in terms of subject matter. As a writer for the Pottery &amp; Glass Trades' Review surmises: To what uses cannot tiles be put? Cornices and chair mouldings, door-frames and windows are set with them; hearths oudined or made wholly from them, doors inlaid and staircases decorated with tiles let into the ends of the stairs or laid as the steps themselves; summer houses are gay with them, and summer vestibules, for the tile is always fresh and cool-looking in its bright designs, while nothing is warmer or more admirable for winter rooms than the dark earth-coloured ones.12 Aesthetic ceramic humour was perhaps first channelled through the blue and white scenes on seventeenth-century Dutch tiles, employed extensively in period interiors. Tiles were indeed a less serious, more accessible, and infinitely more practical form of pictorial decoration than fine art. It therefore seems inevitable that they should be the site of a light-hearted everyday humour even more colloquial than that offered by the widely popular genre paintings. Through increasingly sophisticated methods of transfer-printing on ceramics, modern British tile production not only blurred the boundaries between prints and tiles but between paintings and tiles. This was further compounded by multimedia designers such as Walter Crane, who produced work for both ceramics and illustrated books, and by the widespread unauthorised use on ceramics of popular images by artists such as Kate Greenaway. The location of tiles in the home was usually only very generally suggested by manufacturers and so the erosion of space distinction between the nursery and other rooms, between adult and child taste, further encouraged a creative freedom that in turn revolutionised the function and purpose of ceramics. Subjects that may appear juvenile were suddenly deemed suitable for art appreciators of any age. As Clarence Cook states: A good substitute for original decoration, and under the circumstances, a legitimate one, is to be found in the picture-books of Walter Crane. . .These books are the most beautiful children's books that were ever made; and, indeed they are altogether too good to be confined to the delighting of children. . .Those who know the Walter Crane books buy them for themselves.13 66</page><page sequence="10">THE DECORATIVE ARTS SOCIETY JOURNAL 2010 FIG. 11 Ye Seconde Childhoode', tile, Mintoti &amp; Co , circa 1870 © Victoria and Albert Museum, London. The majority of Cranes 'children's' books incorporated interior settings loosely inspired by the past and other cultures. Imagination was more important than historic or stylistic accuracy but the illustrations were graphic enough to be useful guides to domestic decoration. Indeed, in Reminiscences Crane admitted that 'I had my fun out of them, as in designing I was in the habit of putting in all sorts of subsidiary detail. . . and often made them a vehicle for my ideas in furniture and decoration'.14 Certainly, Cranes talk of 'fun' further suggests a design atmosphere of experimentation and playfulness that extended to all aspects of the decorative arts. In many ways, designers could please themselves, helped by the marriage of technical advancement with increasing creative freedom. Aside from transfer-printing, the ceramic industry had long been developing glazes and decorating techniques suitable for lively subjects. The bright new majolica and faience colours had all the boldness and enjoyment of the gloriously- hued children's books, and ceramic artists were similarly liberated to revel in joyful fantasy worlds. Such is the work of W S Coleman for Minton, whose charger-adorning children inhabit a veritable palace of art where there is little else to do but engage in sensory appreciation: decorating pots, languidly watching goldfish, peeping from behind fans. Certainly, Coleman's work situates 67</page><page sequence="11">THE DECORATIVE ARTS SOCIETY JOURNAL 2010 F IG. 12 (above) Tiles , Aesop's Fables, probably designed by Clement Heaton, Minton, Hollins &amp; Co, circa 1875 © Victoria and Albert Museum, London.

It is this element of childlike freedom and joy in the visual that created an industry amenable to humorous design in even the most elite productions. This can be seen most elementally in the popularity of certain subjects. In the general merging of adult and child interests, the humorous animal kingdom was increasingly subject to plunder and anthropomorphism became a key part of contemporary ceramic design running the full gamut of comic expression. Sentimental humour is essential for sculptural pieces, such as Tinworth s cycling frogs (Fig. 10, p58) and drunk mice, as well as for works that lend themselves to the pictorial, such as Mintons 'ye olde' pelican tiles (Fig. 11). In contrast, there is the cruelty of the animal kingdom. Subjects from Aesops fables, of which there was a proliferation, depict a world of harsh comeuppance, as in Clement Heaton s designs for Minton (Fig. 12). 15 Similarly, William de Morgan s fantastical creatures often hint at a more savage existence, biting and goading each other into decorative shapes and suggesting the scope of humour that could be conveyed through ceramic design (Fig. 13). These affectionate renderings and fantastic forms are a long way from the straightforward satire often associated with Aestheticism. Many designers of the period exhibited great subtlety, with wit and absurdity an essential reflection of their own personalities as channelled through their work. One of the best descriptions of De Morgans work was written after his death, by his business partner Halsey Ricardo, who describes his 'exuberant, whimsical and humorous' fancy: This humour, so kindly, so sympathetic, laughs out in his designs: the way he treats his birds, beast and fishes, to obey his spacing and place themselves in almost impossible situations, without protest and with the suspicion of a grin.16 Ceramics such as De Morgan's created an appetite for the 'serious comic' in the decorative arts, and this mix of accomplished design and inherent wit is arguably a key component of contemporary Aesthetic decorative arts and, most notably, the accessible, adaptable ceramic. The notion was coined by Henry Treffry Dunn in reference to Dutch tiles, 'mostly of Biblical subjects done in the serious comic style', which surrounded a grate at D G Rossetti's residence in Cheyne Walk.17 Although Rossetti's tiles were seventeenth- century rather than contemporary examples, Dunn nonetheless touches upon a mood which arguably 68</page><page sequence="12">THE DECORATIVE ARTS SOCIETY JOURNAL 2010 69</page><page sequence="13">THE DECORATIVE ARTS SOCIETY JOURNAL 2010 fired much decorative output and typified many of the ceramics of the period. It also hints at Rossetti's own infamous humour which is perhaps more indicative of the Aesthetic impulse than the satirised impressions of pale languid women that he unwittingly helped to create. Certainly, Rossetti, with his overblown veneration of his pet wombat, was as aware of the comic potential of the absurd creature as any ceramic artist. Echoing Dunns 'serious comic' is a comment by the Minton artists F A and G W Rhead on the work of Christopher Dresser and the reaction of the Staffordshire potters to the new humorous strain in ceramic design: Dr Dresser produced a number of designs of a semi- humorous character, which, however, can scarcely be said fairly to represent his powers, which were very considerable. The only example which remains in our memory is a small circular bottle with a flat surface, upon which was represented a rencontre of two cats on a garden wall, with a moon behind. It was impossible not to feel that this was a little vulgar and commonplace in character. Mr E G Reuter, in a spirit of derision, and with the idea of showing the authorities that they were roaming all over the place for the purpose of finding what they already possessed to hand, produced a frieze of monkeys forming an interlacing pattern, the two hands of each monkey grasping respectively the tail and the tippet of the hood of the monkey in front. It was quite mediaeval in character, extremely refined, and an excellent piece of ornament. Eiden, who, whatever his limitations, was certainly not wanting in perception, grasped at once the absurdity of the situation.18 F IG. 14 Design for vase, by Christopher Dresser, Minton, circa 1870. © WWRD 70</page><page sequence="14">THE DECORATIVE ARTS SOCIETY JOURNAL 2010 F IG. 15 Cup and saucer, glazed parian with relief - moulded decoration , Royal Worcester, circa 1873. Courtesy of Haslam and Whiteway. These comments indicate the popularity of amusing animal designs and the feeling in Staffordshire that they could also have produced humorous and decorative work if only they had been asked. Dressers flasks, in a toy book illustration style and with a comic narrative, are typical of the ne'y playful mood (Fig. 14). Rhead's comments on the Vulgar and commonplace' hit on a key element of ceramics of the Aesthetic period, already touched upon: the appreciation of beauty in the everyday and the somewhat defiant use of subjects that had hitherto not been considered suitable for use in British design. In many ways, the inspiration for the growing menageries of animals on British ceramics came from the Japanese, who often imbued their work with a subtle and timeless wit. Royal Worcester who, as wef have seen, were not averse to a bit of fun, also seized upon the more gentle humour of Japanese design as beloved of their director R W Binns: Japanese skill in manipulating clay appears boundless in unique intricacy and novelty of design, intelligible to every degree of culture. It never grows stale, nor seems monotonous or conventional, being a spirited rendering of the realism and naturalism of daily life, free intercourse with nature and the imaginings of an impressionable race.19 This appreciation of Japanese design is perhaps best witnessed in Royal Worcester's wonderful frog and tree dragon designs, in which the intrepid amphibians, complete with spears, march into the path of a deadly predator (Fig. 15). To contemporary ceramicists, the Japanese style appeared fresh and unfettered by the historic western ornament that had hitherto been the mainstay of British design. 'Daily life' and all that that entailed, combined with a Tree intercourse with nature', gave way to some of the most exciting ceramics of the period, such as Christopher 7i</page><page sequence="15">THE DECORATIVE ARTS SOCIETY JOURNAL 2010 FIG. 16 (left) Vase, earthenware with painted decoration, designed by Christopher Dresser, Minton, 1887.

Dressers striking vase for Minton which depicts a tug of war between a fish and a prawn, sufficiently commonplace in subject, but also inspired by the Japanese exploitation of the blank space - in this case giving the inherent humour of the design room to breathe (Fig. 16). Used extensively in Japanese design, the motif of the stork is also often cited as a key element of aesthetic style and became a conspicuous component of contemporary ceramics, namely via Christopher Dressers designs for Minton. However, other bird species of more comic and grotesque proportions: crows, pelicans, cranes (see Walter Cranes own playful signature) also dominate ceramic design of the period. Add to this the Martin Brothers' taxonomy-defying 'wally birds' (Fig. 17) and De Morgan's dodos strutting defiantly across tiles, and one begins to see an epidemic of fun, surrounding a shared joy in new subject matter. With Aesop's fables, the 'Crow and Pitcher' story, in which the crow drops pebbles into a deep pitcher to raise the water to drinking level and the 'Fox and Stork' fable, in which the stork gets the upper hand after being made to look ridiculous with its long beak incapable of eating food from a plate, are the point at which the bird and ceramic world are united, allowing designers to depict beautifully rendered pitchers and plates in wry ornithological compositions. Certainly, many of the major makers and manufacturers appear to have had their version of the amused bird, wise but comic in appearance, with prominent beaks offering artistic as well 72</page><page sequence="16">THE DECORATIVE ARTS SOCIETY JOURNAL 2010 FIG.18 (above) Design for a dish, William De Morgan, circa 1888-98 © Victoria and Albert Museum, London.

There are also often great similarities between the work of different artist/designers, suggesting not pirating so much as a healthy and witty design dialogue. One of De Morgans designs, for example, appears to show a log brimming with Wally birds, each winking and smirking with as much spirit as anything produced by the Martin Brothers (Fig. 18). History too provides occasions for humour. The medieval past, so earnestly revived by the Arts and Crafts Movement becomes, in the hands of the Aesthetic period designers and potters, the riotous licentiousness of the Mayday scene, as Rhead suggested with Reuters 'medieval' monkeys. Calendar tiles frequently depict cavorting knaves, as in W B Simpson s Months of the Year tile series, and William Burges' zodiac tile design for Eaton Hall which shows, in all its Aesthetic yellow glory, an amusing array of costumed revellers (Figs 19 and 20). Such work suggests an exploitation of the historic idea of misrule and the subversion of orderly social systems. In many ways this is a useful means of 73</page><page sequence="17">THE DECORATIVE ARTS SOCIETY JOURNAL 2010 understanding design of the period and its gentle rebellion against traditional subject matter in the name of pure enjoyment. # # # In Oscar Wildes The Artist as Critic , Ernest s cry of 'I want to be amused' appears to have been answered by contemporary designers, many of whom, working across media, were able to exploit the new styles fluidity. It is impossible to provide an exhaustive look at the use of humour in British ceramic design, not least because, from satire to subtlety, it appears in many different guises. Nonetheless the Aesthetic period witnessed a freeing up of decorative arts design and anything from a good lampooning to gentle humour became a uniting factor in many contemporary ceramics, including high-end production. Designers revelled in the freedom for subject exploration, exploiting the newfound appreciation of the commonplace: gallant frogs, party-loving mice, strutting storks and feisty prawns. If Wilde is seen as the person who galvanised the Aesthetic Movement, then his blend of comic- seriousness epitomised it and became a means of speaking about the decorative arts. In many ways, contemporary Aesthetic ceramics were about the blurring of boundaries: between mass production and artisan ventures, between adults and children, . and between the commonplace and decorative ornament. Designers were rewriting the rules to produce works that were energetic and individual, leaving us with the suspicion of a grin.
