<plain_text><page sequence="1">IV.-FREEWILL AND MORAL RESPONSIBILITY BY P. NOWELL-SMITH THE traditional problem of freewill has been so adequately covered in recent philosophical literature that some excuse must be offered for re-opening it, and I do so because, although I believe that the traditional problem has been solved, 1 believe also that the solution leaves open certain further problems that are both interesting and important. It is to these problems that I propose to devote most of this paper; but, even at the risk of flogging dead horses, 1 feel bound to say something about the traditional problem itself. (i) The problem arises out of a primcafacie incompatibility between the freedom of human action and the universality of causal law. It was raised in an acute form when universal determinism was believed to be a necessary presupposition of science; but it was not then new, because the incompatibility, if it exist at all, exists equally between human freedom and the foreknowledge of God. As it appears to the 'plain man' the problem may be formulated as follows: " Very often I seem to myself to be acting freely, and this freedom, if it exists, implies that I could have acted otherwise than 1 did. If this freedom is illusory, I shall need a very convincing argument to prove that it is so, since it appears to be something of which I am immediately aware. Moreover, if there is no freedom, there is no moral responsibility; for it would not be right to praise or blame a man for something that he could not help doing. But, if a man could have acted otherwise than he did, his action must have been uncaused, and universal determinism is therefore untrue." Broadly, there are two methods of resolving this, as any other, antinomy. We can'either assume that the incompatibility is a genuine one at a certain level of thought and try to resolve it at a higher plane in which either or'both the terms 'freedom' and ' necessity ' lose their ordinary meaning or we can try to show by an analysis of these terms that no such incompatibility exists. If the latter method is successful, it will show that what is essential 45</page><page sequence="2">46 P. NOWELL SMITH: in our concept of freedom does not conflict with what is essential in our concept of causal necessity and that the incompatibility arises only because, at some stage in our development of one or both of these concepts, we have been tempted into making a false step. This method seems to me the better, (provided always that it is successful), on the ground that it does not resort to any metaphysical conception imported ad hoc to solve this problem, which might be objectionable on other grounds. In the first two sections of this paper 1 shall give a brief outline of the analysis of the problem that I believe to be correct; and for this analysis I claim no originality. The method of presentation will, however, throw into relief the partial nature of the solution and help to indicate the further problems to be discussed in the last three sections. Freedom, so far from being ineompatible with causality, implies it.' When I am conscious of being free, l am not directly conscious that my actions are uncaused, because absence of causa- tion is not something of which one could be directly aware. That the plain man and the Libertarian philosopher are right in claiming to know directly the difference between voluntary and involuntary actions, at least in some cases, I have no doubt; but we can never have this direct knowledge that something is uncaused, since this is a general proposition and, like other general propositions, could only be established by reflection on empirical evidence. For- tunately it is not necessary here either to attempt an analysis of causality or to answer the question whether or not it is a necessary presupposition of science. It is now widely recognised that the considerations which lead scientists to suppose that strict deter- minism is not true are irrelevant to the problem of freewill, since these considerations lend no support to the view that the pheno- mena with which we are concerned are not predictable; and it is to predictability, not to any special theory of the grounds of predictability, that the Libertarian objects. He claims that if our actions are predictable we are 'pawns in the hands of fate ' and cannot choose what we shall do. If, it is argued, someone can know what I shall do, then I have no choice but to do it. The fallacy of this argument has often been exposed and the clearest proof that it is mistaken or at least muddled lies in show- ingr that I could not be free to choose what I do wnless determinism is correct. There are, indeed, grounds for supposing that strict determinism in psychology is not correct; but this, if true, 1 Cf. R. E. Hobart, " Freewill as involving Determinism ", MIND, 1934, p. 1.</page><page sequence="3">FREEWILL AND MORAL RESPONSIBILITY 47 constitutes not an increase but a limitation of our freedom of action. For the simplest actions could not be performed in an indeterministic universe. If I decide, say, to eat a piece of fish, I cannot do so if the fish is liable to turn into a stone or to dis- integrate in mid-air or to behav-e in any other utterly unpredict- able manner. It is precisely because physical objects have determinate causal characteristics that we are able to do what we decide to do. To this it is no answer to say that perhaps the behaviour of physical objects is determined while that of volitions is not. For we sometimes cause people to make decisions as well as to act on them. If someone shouts : " Look out ! There is a bull ", I shall probably run away. My action is caused by my decision to run; but my decision is itself caused by my fear, and that too is caused by what I have heard. Or, again, someone may try to influence my vote by offering me a bribe. If I accept the bribe and vote accordingly, the action is caused by the bribe, my avarice and my sense of obligation to the donor; yet this would certainly be held to be a blameworthy action, and therefore a voluntary one. A genuinely uncaused action could hardly be said to be an action of the agent at all; for in referring the action to an agent we are referring it to a cause. In calling a man ' honest ' or ' brave ' we imply that he can be relied on to act honestly or bravely, and this means that we predict such actions from him. This does not mean that we can predict human actions with the same degree of assurance as that with which we predict eclipses. Psychology and the social sciences have not yet succeeded in establishing laws as reliable as those that we have established in some of the natural sciences, and maybe they never will. But any element of unreliability in our predictions of human actions decreases rather than increases the reliability of our moral judgements about them and of our consequent attributions of praise and blame. An expert chess- player has less difficulty in defeating a moderate player than in defeating a novice, because the moves of the moderate player are more predictable; but they could hardly be said to be less voluntary. In calling an action ' voluntary ' we do not, therefore, mean that it is unpredictable; we mean that no-one compelled the agent to act as he. did. To say that, on the determinist view, we are ' mere pawns in the hands of fate' is to confuse causality with compulsion, to confuse natural laws (descriptions) with social laws (prescriptions) and to think of fate as a malignant deity that continually thwarts our aims. What the protagonist of freedom requires, in short, is not uncaused actions, but actions that are the effects of a peculiar kind of causes. I shall be as</page><page sequence="4">48 P. NOWELL SMITH: brief as possible in saying what these causes are, since this has often been said before. But it is one thing to state the criteria by which we decide whether or not an action is voluntary and another to say why this distinction is important for ethics. The problem which the analysts have not, in my view, sufficiently considered is that of analysing the peculiar relation of 'merit ' or 'fittingness' that is held to exist between voluntary actions and moral responsibility. (ii) If someone overpowers me and compels me to fire a gun which causes a death, I should not be held guilty of murder. It would be said that my action was not voluntary; for I couLld n6t, had 1 so wished, have acted otherwise. On the other hand, if 1 kill someone because I hope to benefit under his will, my action is still caused, namely by my greed; but my action would be held to be voluntary and I should be blamed for it. The criterion here is that, while in the first case the cause is external to me, in the second it is my decision. A similar criterion would be used to distinlguish a kleptomaniac from a thief. A kleptomaniac is held to be one who steals without having decided to do so, perhaps even in spite of a decision not to do so. He is not held morally responsible for his action because his action is not held to be voluntary. But in this case it is not true, as it was in the last, that his action is called involuntary because it is caused by some outside force. The cause of kleptomania is obscure; but it is not external compulsion. And, if the cause is not external, how can we say that the kleptomaniac is 'compelled' ? As used by psychologists, the term 'compulsion' is evidently a metaphor, similar to that by which we speak of a man's doing something when 'he is not himself '. Evidently our moral judgements imply not merely a distinction between voluntary and compelled actions but a further distinction among actions that are not compelled. A third example will make it clear that some such distinction must be made. Suppose that a schoolmaster has two pupils, A and B, who fail to do a simple sum correctly. A has often done sums of similar difficulty before and done them correctly, while B has always failed. The schoolmaster will, perhaps, threaten A with punishment, but he will give B extra private tuition. On the traditional view his action might be explained as follows: "A has done these sums correctly before; therefore he could have done them correctly on this occasion. His failure is due to carelessness or laziness. On the other hand, B is stupid.</page><page sequence="5">FREEWILL AND MORAL RESPONSIBILITY 49 He has never done these sums correctly; so 1 suppose that he cannot do them. A's failure is due to a moral delinquency, B's to an intellectual defect. A therefore deserves punishment, but B does not." This is, 1 think, a fair summary of what the 'plain man' thinks about a typical case, and the points to which I wish to draw attention are these:- (a) Neither failure is said to be 'uncaused'. (b) The causes assigned are divided into two classes, moral and intellectual. (Cases of physical deficiency, e.g. not being strong or tall enough would go alongf with the intellectual class, the point being that such deficiencies are non-moral.) (c) Praise and blame are thought appropriate to moral but not to non-moral defects. (d) The criterion for deciding whether a defect is moral is 'Could the agent have acted otherwise ? ' I do not wish to suggest that the reasoning attributed tothe plain man in this case is in any way incorrect, only that, particularly in regard to points (c) and (d) it needs explaining. It is evident that one of the necessary conditions of moral action is that the agent ' could have acted otherwise ' and it is to this fact that the Libertarian is drawing attention. His case may be stated as follows: " It is a well-known maxim that 'I ought ' implies ' I can '. If I cannot do a certain action, then that action cannot be my duty. On the other hand, 'I ought' as clearly implies 'I need not ' ; for if I cannot possibly refrain from a certain action, there can be no merit or demerit in doing it. Therefore, in every case of moral choice it is possible for the agent to do the action and also possible for him not to do it; were it not so, there would be no choice; for choice is between possibilities. But this implies that the action is uncaused, because a caused action cannot but occur." The fallacy in this argument lies in supposing that, when we say 'A could have acted otherwise ', we mean that A, being what he was and being placed in the circumstances in which he was placed, could- have done something other than what he did. But in fact we never do mean this; and if we believe that voluntary action is un- caused action that is only because we believe erroneously that uncaused action is a necessarv condition of moral responsibility. The Libertarian believes that an action cannot be a moral one if the agent could not have acted otherwise, and he takes no account of possible differences in the causes that might have prevented him from acting otherwise. The Determinist, on the other hand, holds that the objective possibility of alternative actions is an illusion and that, if A in fact did X, then he could not have done 4</page><page sequence="6">50 P. NOWELL SMITH: any action incompatible with X. But he holds also that differ- ences in the various causes that might have led to X may be of great importance and that it is in fact from the consideration of such differences that we discover the criterion by which we judge an action to be voluntary, and so moral. We all blame Nero for murdering Agrippina, and the Libertarian holds that this implies that Nero could have abstained from his action. But this last phrase is ambiguous. Even if we admit that it would have been impossible for anyone to predict Nero's action with the degree of assurance with which we predict eclipses, yet an acute observer at Nero's court might have laid longish odds that Nero, being what he was and being placed in the cir- cumstances in which he was placed, would sooner or later murder his mother. To say that Nero might have acted otherwise is to say that he could have decided to act otherwise and that he would have so decided if he had been of a different character. If Nero had been Seneca, for example, he would have preferred suicide to matricide. But what could 'If Nero had been Seneca .' possibly mean ? Unfulfilled conditionals in which both terms are names of individuals constitute, admittedly, a thorny philosophical problem; but it is clear, I think, that if 'If Nero had been Seneca '. . . . ' means anything at all, it is a quasi- general proposition which can be analysed either as ' If Nero had had the character of Seneca ' or ' If Seneca had been emperor ' or in some similar fashion. None of these analyses are incom- patible with the Determinist's contention that, as things stood, Nero could not have abstained. But, adds the Determinist, the cause of his inability to abstain was not external compulsion nor some inexplicable and uncharacteristic quirk. His action was predictable because it was characteristic, and it is for the same reason that he is held to blame. But the Libertarian's case is not yet fully answered. He might reply: " But, on this analysis, I still cannot blame Nero which in fact I do, and feel that I do justly. If the murder was caused by his character, he may not have been to blame. For his character may have been caused by hereditary and environ- mental factors over which he had no control. Can we justly blame a man if his vicious actions are due to hereditary epilepsy or to the influence of a corrupt and vicious court ? " To this the answer is that we can and do. So long as we persist in supposing that, to be moral, an action must be uncaused, we can only push the moral responsibility back in time; and this, so far from solving the problem, merely shows the impossibility of any solu- tion on these lines.</page><page sequence="7">FREEWILL AND MORAL RESPONSIBILITY 51 This is made abundantly clear by Aristotle's discussion of the subject, which I shall paraphrase somewhat freely in order to show that it must raise a difficulty which Aristotle does not squarely face. Aristotle says that, if a man plead that he could not help doing, X because be was ' the sort of man to do X ' then he should be blamed for being this sort of man. His, character was caused by his earlier actions, Y and Z, that made him the sort of person who would, in the given situation, inevitably do X. But suppose the criminal pleads that at the time of doing Y and Z he did not know that these were vicious actions and did not know that doing vicious actions causes a. vicious character ? Then, says Aristotle, all we can say in such a case is that not to know that actions create character is the mark of a singularly senseless person. But this is clearly in- adequate. For the criminal might proceed: " Very well then, I was a singularly senseless person; I neither knew that Y and Z were vicious actions nor that, if I did them, I would become the sort of person to do X. And, anyhow, at the time of doing Y and Z, I was the sort of person to do Y and Z. These actions were just as much caused as was X. You say that blaming me for doing X is really blaming me for ha-ving done Y and Z. Now apply the same argument to Y and Z and see where it leads you. Furthermore my ignorance at the time of doing Y and Z which, according to you, is the real source of the trouble, was not my fault either. My father did not have me properly educated. Blame him, if you must blame somebody; but he will offer the same reply as I have done, and so ad infinitum." This argument carries no conviction; but it admits of no reply, and it is here that the temptation to invoke a metaphysical deus ex machina, becomes inviting. If we proceed on the assumption that, to be moral, an action must be uncaused, either we shall find a genu-- inely uncaused action at the beginning of the chain or we shall not. If we do not, then, according to the Libertarian, there can be no moral praise and blame at all (and it was to account for these that Libertarianism was invented); and, if we do, then we must suppose that, while almost all our actions are caused, and therefore amoral, there was in the distant past some one action that was not caused and for which we can justly be praised or blamed. This bizarre theory has in fact been held; but the objections to it are clear. We praise and blame people for what. they do now, not for what they might have done as babies, and any theory of moral responsibility must account for this. Secondly- the same man is subjected to judgements both of praise and of blame; therefore the subject of these judgements cannot be one</page><page sequence="8">52 P. NOWELL SMITH: solitary act, and, thirdly, even if we were able to discover this one hypothetical infantile act, would it in fact be a fit subject for either praise or blame ? If it were genuinely uncaused, it couild hardly be either, since it would Dot be an action of the agent. (iii) So far we have discovered nothing more startling than the fact that moral actions are the effects of a peculiar kind of causes, namely the voluntary actions of the agent. To sum up this part of the argument, I cannot do better than quote the words of Prof. Ayer: " To say that I could have acted otherwise is to say, first, that I should have acted otherwise, if I had so choosen; secondly, that my action was voluntary in the sense in which the actions say of the kleptomaniac are not; and, tlhirdly, that nobody compelled me to choose as I did: and these three condi- tions may very well be fulfilled. When they are fulfilled, I may be said to have acted freely. But this is not to say that it was a matter of chance that I acted as 1 did, or, in other words, that my action could not be explained. And that my actions should be capable of being explained is allithat is required by the postu- late of determinism." 1 With this I agree; but it leaves un- solved what is perhaps the most important part of the problem. Granted that we sometimes act 'freely' in the sense defined by Ayer, in what sense is it rational or just or moral to praise or blame voluntary actions but not involuntary ones ? It is surely not enough to say: 'Actions of such-and-such a kind are given the name 'voluntary' and 'are praised and blamed; others are not.' We need to explain the relation of 'fittingness' that is held to obtain between voluntary actions and moral judgement. Suppose that A and B each kill some one. We apply Ayer's tests and decide that A's was a voluntary action and B's not. We hang A, and B is immured in an asylum or regains his liberty. What needs to be explained is (a) Why do we do this ? and (b) Is it morally justifiable ? Before attempting to answer these questions 1 shall first say something of two alternative solutions, the positivist and the intuitionist. The positivist' solution might be on these lines: " Both the questions at the end of the last paragraph are pseudo- questions. We cannot explain.why we do things, unless ' explain- ing ' merely means ' discovering efficient causes '. I can discover the efficient causes of human actions, as of other phenomena, by 1 " Freedom and Necessity ", Polemic, No. 5, p. 43.</page><page sequence="9">FREEWILL AND MORAL RESPONSIBILITY 53 observation; but I cannot discover final causes, because there are no such things and no good has ever come of looking for them. Look at the sterility of the natural sciences before the seventeenth century philosophers substituted explanation in terms of efficient causes for explanation in terms of final ones. Secondly, to ask whether it is moral or rational to act as we do is silly. If you like 1 will include such action in my definition of 'acting morally or rationally '. What is moral in a given society is what is in accordance with its customs; and to ask whether a custom is moral is to ask whether it is customary, which is ridiculous." 1 shall not spend much time in discussing this solution, because the fallacy is, 1 believe, obvious, and the theory can be refuted without appeal to any dubious intuitions of Natural Law. It is true that in natural science the search for final causes is futile; but this is because such a search rests on the erroneous attribu- tion of human purposes to nature. But in discussing human conduct anthropomorphic ideas are not out of place; it is their transfer to natural phenomena that is illegitimate. Though the right answer to the question " What causes an eclipse of the sun? " cannot be in the form " The sun wants to do so-and-so ", this sort of answer may very well be appropriate when the phenomenon in question is a human action. Not even the positivist denies the existence and causal efficacy of human purposes. The intuitionist solution cannot so easily be dismissed; in fact it is never possible formally to refute someone who claims to be directly aware of something. All that we can do is to show that, in a given case, intuitionism leads to some unplausible con- clusion that the intuitionist himself would be reluctant to admit. It is not my intention to show that intuitionism is in general false; indeed, the theory that our knowledge of values is grounded in intuition may very well be true. But moral judgements, as I hope to show in the next section, are not pure value judgements; they are value judgements combined with causal judgements. Whatever else we may be asserting when we call an action right or wrong we are asserting that it was caused in a certain way, and it is difficult to see how such a causal proposition can be intuited. Ftfrthermore, in default of widespread agreement about intuitions of this relation of fittingness, we are driven to believe that such intuitions, if they occur, are subjective. And there is no such agreement, even among experts. If, as Kant held, the infliction of punishment on a criminal is necessarily a moral act, how is it that Westermarck can say: " The infliction of pain is not an act that the moral consciousness regards with</page><page sequence="10">54 P. NOWELL SMITH: indifference even in the case of a criminal ".1 Again, Ewing, after showing that the retribuLtive theory of punishment cannot be defended except by an appeal to intuition, goes on to say: " Now it seems to me that, instead of being intuitively certain that punishment should be inflicted as an end-in-itself without any consideration of consequences, the intuitive evidence is all the other way." 2 Rashdall, again, holds that the problem must be decided " for each of us by an appeal to his own moral con- sciousness " 3 and sides, rather tentatively, with the anti-Kantians. This disagreement of experts sheds -no light on the truth of the retributive theory of punishment, but it does tend to show that the intuition of fittingness on which that theory relies either does not in fact occur or is at best unreliable and at worst subjective. The intuitionist who claims to be directly aware of the relation of fittingness is, in short, telling us something about his own mind. This may be interesting and important, but it is incon- sistent with the proposition that most intuitionists would like to maintain, that such intuitions are objecti-vely true or false. The intuitionist theory cannot be ruled out, but it is a safe rule not to resort to intuitions until driven to do so, because so many alleged intuitions have, in the past, been shown to be not merely not intuited but even false. (iv) The theory that I wish to suggest is that in every so-called moral judgement there are two distinct elements, a value judge- ment and a moral judgement proper. About, value judgements no special theory is implied. In particular, I do not intend to prejudice any of the following issues:- (a) whether value judgements are or are not properly called 'judgements' at all, (b) whether there is or is not only one type of value (for instance, pleasure), and (c) whether or not value judgements are subjective. It will, however, follow that, whatever values there may be, there is no such thing as moral value, as such, but that when we attri- bute moral value to a thing we are saying in a misleading way that the thing has some value or other and is connected with a moral cause. Whatever our reasons may be, we do in fact regard some states, objects and events as ' good ' or 'valuable' and others as I Ethical Relativity, p. 77. 2 The Morality of Punishment, p. 18. 3 The Theory of Good and Evil, pp. 284 ff.</page><page sequence="11">FREEWILL AND MORAL RESPONSIBILITY 55 'bad ' or ' disvaluable '; the former we try to promote, the latter to prevent. Whatever may be the case with value judge- ments, the strictly moral element in a moral judgement is con- cerned with an empirical fact and is, therefore, objective. The difference between these two types of judgement can be made clear by an example. Suppose that, for whatever reason, I regard A's life as valuable. (I may hold that all human life is valuable as such, or that A is a good man and that the lives of good men are valuable, or merely that the existence of A is propitious to some scheme in which I am interested.) A may be murdered in cold blood by B or may be run over by C in cir- cumstances over which the latter had no control. In each of these cases I should make the same value judgement, that A's death was ' bad '. But, while in the first case I should make the further moral judgement that B's action was criminal, in the second I should make no additional moral judgement at all. The theory can be divided into four parts: (a) Value judgements apply only to events (including their consequences), but not to their causes. (b) Events that are ' good ' or ' bad ' constitute moral actions only when they are caused by someone's voluntary decision. (c) ' Good ' and ' bad ' events that are also moral actions are fit subjects for praise and blame, while other good and bad events are not. (d) This ' fittingness ' is a causal relation, discoverable neither by a special 'moral sense ' nor by intuition nor by a priori reasoning, but by reflection on experience. Of these propositions (a) and (b) are recommendations to employ a certain terminology in ethical matters; (c) is a pro- position which will, I think, be generally admitted, provided the suggested terminology is accepted. But it is (c) that requires explanation, and the explanation is contained in (d). If it is true that praise and blame are means employed to bring about good events and prevent bad ones, they are appropriate not to all good and bad events, but only to those that they can in fact bring about or prevent. Since a moral action is one that can be fittingly praised or blamed, it follows that a moral action is one that can be brought about or prevented by these means. Moral actions are a sub'class of good and bad events, and the traditional criterion for deciding whether or not an event belongs to this sub- class was, as we saw, " Was the action voluntary, i.e. caused by a decision of the agent ? " But the application of this criterion involves two difficulties. It is sometimes difficult to decide to what cause an action was due. Is this a case of laziness or a case</page><page sequence="12">56 P. NOWELL SMITH: of stupidity ? Was the prisoner in the dock mad or was he avaricious ? This is an empirical difficulty and raises no question of principle. But the other difficulty that arises in applying the criterion of voluntariness is to find a rule for deciding what classes of actions are voluntary. If the criterion I have suggested is correct, then we should find that the class of actions generally agreed to be voluntary coincides roughly with the class of actions that are caused by characteristics that can be strengthened or inhibited by praise and blame. A;nd this is what we do in fact find; moral characteristics, as opposed to intcllectual and physical ones, are just those that we believe to be alterable in this way. Now the problem of deciding whether or not a char- acteristic is alterable mav be difficult; but the difficulty is an empirical one only, and we know at least how to set about solving it. This theory implies a utilitarian theory of punishment. Rewards ann_ punishments (for the sake of brevity I shall in future refer only to punishment) are distributed not because certain actions directly ' merit ' them, but because some useful purpose is believed to be served by inflicting them. It should be noted that the theory that punishment is, pirposive does not imply that its purposes must always have been those that the Utilitarians had in mind. Furthermore, the fact that some systems of punish- ment do not in fact produce the intended results, an argument that is often urged against the utilitarian theory, does not tend to show that no result was intended. The performance of Sellenger's Round doubtless does nothing to keep the sun on its course; but that does not prove that it is not intended to do so by the performers. Failure to produce results argues not lack of purpose but lack of skill in the practitioner. It may be objected that this theory fails to account for the retributive element in punishment and, before elaborating it on the positive side, I shall first suggest a possible explanation both of the fact that the retributive theory is believed and of the fact that its supporters claim to intuit its truth. To do this it is necessary to distinguish between the reasons for which the theory first came to be held and the reasons for which it is held now. An adequate account of the first point would require to be based on a wider knowledge of anthropology than I possess, and I do not claim that the account here suggested is tru6, even in its broad outlines. Nevertheless it is, I think, plausible to suppose that retributive punishment originally had some purpose, even if it was quite different from the one suggested here. The primitive nmorality that demands an eye for an eye is by no means incompatible with the theory that punishment is not</page><page sequence="13">FREEWILL AND MORAL RESPONSIBILITY 57 mere retribution, but is designed to bring about some end; and, such practices as the punishment of idiots, animals and even inanimate objects do not prove that their practitioners were intuitionists who claimed to be directly aware that certain actions 'ought to be punished', the morality of the punishment being in no way dependent on any supposed advantage to those who inflict it. Such practices are always found in conjunction with a special theological theory as to the nature of the universe. It is held that the Gods require certain sorts of conduct on the part of human. beings and that they will visit breaches of- the rules with their wrath in the form of plagues, famines and other undesirable events. It is to prevent these that punishment is inflicted; and this explains why it is that what we call the morality of the action, which includes the condition that it be voluntary, is not held to affect the morality of punishment, a point which orthodox retributionists have some difficulty in explaining. Tf the volition of the agent is held to be irrelevant to the operation of God's wrath, it will also be irrelevant to the morality of punish- ment, since the object of punishment is not to requite a volun- tarily committed wrong but to ward off God's anger. (Edipus has committed parricide and incest. He must be punished, not because be did so, still less because he intended to do so, but because the tribe that harbours him will suffer if he is not. Punishment is expiation. When a society holds theological beliefs other than our own we shall not be surprised to find that its moral ideas differ also. Retributive punishment does not have the object that punish- ment has with us, and it does not (we believe) achieve the results aimed at. But neither of these facts tends to show that it did not originally have some purpose, and it is a curious fact that the retributive practice tends to become mollified (in the form of purely ritual expiation) and finally abandoned, precisely when the crude theology on which it is based ceases to be believed. Now if retributive practices are due entirely to instinct or to an intuition of fittingness it is hard to see why this should be so. It is apparently a pure coincidence that the intuitive light grows dim precisely when a certain theological theorv is abandoned. But if the purposive theory is true it is easy to see why the retri- butive element should tend to give way before the reformatory and deterrent elements when people abandon the belief that punishment will obviate the failure of crops but conceive (or retain) the belief that it will benefit society by inhibiting certain forms of action. When we abandon the belief that God will visit his wrath on a tribe that harbours an unwitting parricide, we no</page><page sequence="14">58 P. NOWELL SMITH: longer have any motive for punishing him. Consequently we call him innocent. A man is not punishable because he is guilty; he is guilty because he is punishable, that is to say, because some useful result is supposed to accrue from punishing him. If this is true, we can also explain why it is that modern retributionists, who do not hold the crude theological beliefs with which I have suggested that the practice was originally linked, fall back on an intuition of fittingness. Here, as elsewhere, intuition is invoked to account for a belief that we are quite certain that we hold but for which we have forgotten the original grounds and cannot discover new ones. It often happens that a belief is retained after the theory on which it is based and which alone makes it plausible has been abandoned, and this is par- ticularly liable to happen in ethics for the following reason. Metaphysical and scientific -views are changed by the speculation of a few intellectuals, who are regarded by the many as harmless. But morals, as Hume said, excite our passions and produce and prevent action. The moral reformer, therefore, unlike the speculator, is treated as a danger to society; and for this reason morality tends to be more conservative than other branches of thought. Hence there sometimes arises a lack of logical relation between the metaphysical and scientific ideas of a society and its moral code, the latter being partly a survival from older modes of thought. When this process of survival occurs in a society not our own we call it a superstition or a taboo; when it occurs in our own we call it a Moral Law. Now the retributive theory has a logical justification if a certain theological view is accepted. That view having been abandoned, the justification no longer exists and we are forced to fall back on a direct intuition that punishment is fitting. (v) The analysis suggested at the beginning of the last section can now be applied to the examples used earlier in the paper. We saw that, apart from the empirical difficulty of deciding to what class an action belongs, there are two difficulties of principle. One is the problem of determining what classes of actions are voluntary; the other the problem of showing' a connexion between being voluntary and being liable to praise or blame. It has, I think, usually been the practice to try to solve the first of these problems first; but this leaves us, as we saw, in the insuper- able difficulty of libertarianism and also renders the second problem insoluble. If the theory 1. have suggested is correct, the second problem should come first and is simply the empirical</page><page sequence="15">FREEWILL AND MORAL RESPONSIBILITY 59 problem of deciding what characteristics are alterable; and the solution to this problem then provides the criterion for deciding what actions are voluntary. The preliminary analysis of the case of the schoolmaster left unexplained the meaning of the vital sentence, 'A could have acted otherwise, while B could not; and also the question 'Why is laziness punishable and stupidity not ? ' It is not enough to say that A's failure was voluntary because he is known to have acted rightly before. Perhaps he was not lazy then but is now. And how do we know that his laziness now is not just as much beyond his control as was his industriousness then and as is B's stupidity now ? An analysis made on these lines cannot fail to land us in the difficulty in which Aristotle left us. A will plead that his laziness was caused and therefore involuntary. On the other hand, if, instead of assuming that A ought to be punished because he is morally guilty, we suppose that he ought to be punished for some other reason, the rationale of the schoolmaster's action becomes clear. He knows from experience that, if he adds the fear of punishment to the motives actuating A, then A will tend to get these sums right in future, which is, for him, the end to be achieved. On the other hand, if B is stupid, neither threats nor promises will cause him to do better. When we say that A could have done the sum correctly, had he so chosen, we do not inply that he could, on that occasion, have so chosen. But we do imply that A is such that, under certain circumstances, he will choose to act correctly; and those circumstances can be brought about. Rewards and punishments are means of varying the causal ante- cedents of actions so that those we desire will occur and those we wish to prevent will not occur. Cleverness and industriousness are both valuable characteristics ; the latter is called a 'moral' one and the former not, because we know from experience that the former cannot be induced by means of praise and blame, while the latter can. It is surely no accident that the character- istics that we believe to be alterable in this way are precisely those that we call moral; and this also explains why, to be moral, an act must be voluntary. To say that a man could have acted otherwise is to say that he might have been the sort of person who would have acted otherwise, and to attribute his acting as he did to his moral character, as opposed to some amoral defect, is to say that his action was due to one of the characteristics that can be altered by means of rewards and punishments. It is not necessary to under-take an elaborate analysis of the other examples used. If a man kills someone because he is physically compelled to do so, he will not be prevented from doing</page><page sequence="16">60 P. NOWELL SMITH: so again in similar circumstances by the knowledge that the action will be severely punished. But if his action is due to his own decision, this knowledge may cause him to decide otherwise in future. In the same way the basis for the distinction between the kleptomaniac and the thief is that the latter is held to have decided to steal. Here the cause in both cases lies within the agent and the distinction of internal and external causation did not help us. The fact that one commits a voluntary action and the other does not is important, but by itself it does not account for the differential treatment of the two men. Why are men who steal as a result of a decision said to be worthy of punish- ment, while those who steal from some other cause are not ? The reason is that we believe that the fear of punishment will affect the future behaviour of the thief but not that of the klepto- maniac. If a man steals because he has decided to do so, we can prevent his doing so again by causing him to decide otherwise. If he expects to be punished, then in addition to the motive that tends to make him steal there will be a powerful motive tending to make him refrain. Now the fear of punishment has no such influence on the kleptomaniac; on the other hand, psychoanalysis, by removing the subconscious cause of his tendency to steal, may achieve the desired result. Nor is this merely an interesting but unimportant distinction between kleptomaniacs and thieves it is the very basis for the distinction. In each case we make the same value judgement, that the abstraction of one's neighbours, goods is undesirable. If we consider the actions of the thief and the kleptomaniac simply as events, without regard to their causes, they are identical and provide no possible basis for differential treatment. Therefore the different moral judgements that we in fact make and the different treatments that'we accord cannot be based on the value judgement alone. The moral judgements are concerned with the causes of the actions. But to say that avarice is a reprehensible cause and kleptomania not explains nothing. For we cannot, without appeal to dubious intuitions, assert that of 'two similar undesirable events one is morally reprehensible and the other not. Nor is it enough to say with the positivists that the fact that we make these distinc- tions is simply a brute fact about our society and requires no explanation. Some basis must be found for the distinction, and I suggest that it is to be found in the fact that, while potential thieves will be deterred by the prospect of six months' hard labour, potential kleptomaniacs will not. Generalising from these instances, we can see that the relation that is held to exist between voluntary wrong-doing and punish-</page><page sequence="17">FREEWILL AND MORAL RESPONSIBILITY 61 ability is neither an inexplicable sociological fact nor a mysterious relation of ' merit ' that some of us are able to intuit; it is a relation of cause and effect. If this is so, then, whatever views we may hold about the subjectivity of value judgements, moral judgements, being judgements of cause and effect, are all objective. Many moral philosophers have held subjectivist doctrines about other forms of value, such as pleasure or sesthetic taste, but have been unwilling to allow that moral judgements are subjective, and this in spite of the fact that the arguments leading to sub- jectivism in asthetics appear to apply equally to morals. I think that their hesitation has been correct and has not always been due to the irrational considerations, such as the fear that subjectivity in ethics might undermine society, that have some- times been attributed to them. If the proposed separation of the value element from the moral element in moral judgement be accepted, their unwillingness to accept a purely subjective theory of ethics will have been justified.</page></plain_text>
