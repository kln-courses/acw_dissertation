<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Role of Salt Marshes in Sustaining Long Island Fisheries Jake Kritzer1* and Andrew Hughes2** Environmental Defense Fund, Boston, MA Environmental Defense Fund, New York, NY Introduction Commercial and recreational fishing are important to the economy and culture of Long Island, and coastal fisheries depend upon salt marshes. Marshes provide habitat for prey fish such as killifishes, mummichogs, minnows, and silversides that provide food for striped bass, bluefish, weakfish, and other popular sport fish. Atlantic croaker, another popular sport fish, uses marshes directly as nursery habitat. American eel and oyster toadfish both support small-scale commercial fisheries on Long Island, and their populations are enhanced by marshes. Eels and toadfish also play an important role in regulating crab populations on shellfish beds. Crabs present a critical juvenile- mortality bottleneck for oysters and hard clams, which once supported fisheries on Long Island that were among the largest in the nation. Such ecosystem connections mean that abundant and healthy marshes can enhance shellfish restoration. Blue crabs are another commercially important species dependent on marshes as nurseries. Marshes, in turn, depend upon blue crabs because they prey upon periwinkles and other predators of marsh plants. Although too many crabs on shellfish beds can be detrimental, too few crabs in marshes can lead to marsh loss. Given the array of species and ecosystem services connected to marshes, protection and restoration of salt marshes are essential to maintaining productive fisheries on Long Island. Fisheries and Habitat on Long Island Saltwater fishing is a fundamental component of the economy and culture of Long Island. In 2006, more than 250,000 saltwater anglers fishing in New York spent more than $300 million on gear, bait, fuel, ice, hotel rooms, and other costs necessary for a successful fishing trip (USFWS 2008). In 2007, *jkritzer@edf.org **ahughes@edf.org commercial fishermen landed fish and shellfish in New York valued at nearly $59 million (NOAA 2008). The economic value of commercial fishing is even greater when factoring in the additional revenue generated after harvest through the supply chain to the eventual consumer in a restaurant or fish shop. Beyond its economic value, sport fishing provides an invaluable recreational opportunity for Long Is- landers, allowing time with friends and family and a connection to the natural world. Commercial fishing has even deeper roots, having played a central role in shaping the character and culture of many Long Is- land communities. Peter Mathiessen (1988) captured the rich history, tenuous present, and uncertain future of Long Island's fishing heritage in Men 's Lives. The tenuousness conveyed in Mathiessen's book stems from the tragic decline of many fisheries across our nation and the lost traditions and changing coast- al character that follow. Often, the depletion and, in severe cases, collapse of fisheries are attributed to overcapitalization, inadequate science and monitor- ing, misaligned economic and environmental incen- tives, and mismanagement. These are all key drivers of fisheries decline. But other critical factors are the loss and degradation of important marine and coastal habitats. Indeed, habitat provides the stage on which the dynamics of fish stocks play out. Sound fisher- ies science and harvest regulations will get us only so far, if the habitat stage can hold only very few scaly actors. The need to stem the tide of habitat loss is widely recognized as a key conservation priority by many people given the numerous important ecological services that habitats provide. Salt marshes are cer- tainly no exceptions. As discussed in other articles in this volume, marshes provide nesting and forag- ing grounds for birds, buffer coastal areas against storm surge, trap and secure sediments, and pro- cess nutrients, thereby helping to maintain dis- solved oxygen levels. Marshes also play a key role in sustaining our fisheries. Unfortunately, habitat 34 Tidal Marshes of Long Island, Torrey Botanical Society</page><page sequence="2">Figure 1.

Therefore, the economic and cultural values of fisheries too infrequently provide motiva- tion for habitat protection and restoration, and fish- eries recovery too infrequently includes aggressive habitat management as part of the strategy. Here, we look at some of the ways salt marshes on Long Island contribute directly to the fisheries that form such an integral part of our economy, culture, and history. A Cornucopia of Prey One of the first things you might notice when ex- ploring a Long Island salt marsh is the preponderance of small fishes. Whether they swim in the creeks that wind their way through the marshlands or infiltrate the expanses of marsh grasses on the flooding tide, several species of small fish take advantage of the structural complexity and rich food supply found in marsh habitats. Among the most numerous fish spe- cies in marshes are the various striped killifishes and mummichogs of the genus Fundulus, the sheepshead minnow ( Cypr inodori variegates), and the Atlantic silverside ( Menidia menidia). Research has shown that these species enjoy both higher growth rates and survivorship in marshes (Halpin 2000). Across the globe, small fishes support some very big fisheries. One of the world's largest fisheries targets the tiny Peruvian anchovy. Closer to home, one of the larg- est fisheries in the Northwest Atlantic targets the di- minutive Atlantic herring. However, while killifishes, sheepshead minnow, and silversides are certainly caught by Long Island anglers with cast nets look- ing for bait, they do not form the basis of commercial fisheries remotely close to the scale of those founded upon Peruvian anchovy or Atlantic herring. But the importance of these fishes for fisheries ex- tends well beyond their value as target species. An- glers seek killifishes, minnows, and silversides as bait because they know their quarry also hunt these fishes. Striped bass (Figure 1), weakfish, bluefish, and oth- er coastal sport fishes thrive on the Atlantic coast in large part due to the productive assemblage of prey fishes available to them. Atlantic menhaden (a.k.a. "pogies" or "bunker"), river herring (alewife and blueback herring), sand lance, bay anchovy, and other small coastal species (certainly including the marsh- dependent killifishes, minnows, and silversides) pro- vide a rich food source for these sport fishes. A key feature of this complex coastal food web is its diver- sity. Most of the larger predators pursued by anglers feed on a range of these prey species rather than being completely reliant on any one. This is an important strategy not only to maintain a varied diet, but also to guard against unpredictable fluctuations in the abundance of any single type of prey. Evolving the ability to effectively hunt multiple species can be an invaluable insurance policy. Still, certain prey species can be disproportionately important to certain predators at particular life stages or particular times in their annual migrations. For example, it is not uncommon to catch a bluefish ( Pomatomus saltatrix) whose belly is stuffed with nothing but silversides, as described by John Hersey (1987) in Blues and quantified by several research teams working throughout the Northeast (Friedland et al. 1988; Juanes and Conover 1994, 1995; Juanes et al. 2001). It is also important to remember that the diet of coastal fish predators is not dependent solely on prey fish. In the Hudson River, overwintering young-of-the-year striped bass ( Morone saxatilis ) feed predominantly not on fish, but rather on a suite of small invertebrates (Hurst and Conover 2001). Inclusive among these are the marsh-dwelling grass shrimps of the genus Palaemonetes (Peterson and Turner 1994). The trophic importance of salt marshes extends be- yond their edges and the prey fishes occupying them and out into nearby estuarine waters. Weinstein et al. (2000 , 2005) found that organic matter originating from marshes helps promote phytoplankton abundance in open waters, and these phytoplankton support popula- tions of both the bay anchovy {Anchoa mitchilli ) and its predator, the weakfish ( Cynoscion regalis ). Although neither species is highly marsh-dependent in terms of habitat use, the productivity of marshes forms the basis of the food webs in which they are interwoven. The Role of Salt Marshes in Sustaining Long Island Fisheries 35</page><page sequence="3">Predators in Marshes Salt marshes are home to not only fish species preyed upon by larger predators, but some of those larger predators that are fisheries targets also rely upon marshes directly. Juvenile Atlantic croaker (Micropogonias und.ula.tus ) use marshes as nurseries for many of the same reason that killifish, minnows, and silversides do; it is a structurally complex habitat that offers refuge combined with a rich food supply (Shenker and Dean 1979; Baltz et al. 1993). Encouraging research results show that habitat use by, and growth of, Atlantic croaker are similar between natural and restored marshes, suggesting that restoration is a worthwhile endeavor yielding ecologically valuable outcomes (Miller and Able 2002). Positive responses to marsh restoration have been found in mummichog populations as well (Teo and Able 2003). Atlantic croaker might not have the same prestige as marquee species like striped bass or bluefish (Figure 2) on Long Island, but anglers in the know recognize its value as a sport fish. And that value is dependent upon salt marshes as nursery habitats. Furthermore, Long Island is at the edge of the species' range, which makes the region important from a research and conservation perspective as an indicator of shifts (expansion or contraction) in the distribution of croaker. White perch ( Morone americana ), a close but less celebrated cousin of the striped bass, also lives in close proximity to marshes. Its tissues show strong chemical signatures indicating carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur atoms of marsh origin, underscoring the importance of marshes in sustaining their populations (Weinstein et al. 2000, 2005). Another marsh-dwelling species that often has an undeservedly low profile in the public eye is the American eel ( Anguilla rostrata). The American eel has one of the most complex and fascinating life histories in all of nature, leaving coastal waterways from Brazil to Newfoundland anywhere between age 7 and age 50 to make a one-time spawning migration to the Sargasso Sea, near the middle of the North Atlantic Ocean. Eels die after spawning, but the tiny transparent larvae they produce ride the Gulf Stream and other currents for up to a year back toward the mainland of North, Central, or South America where they switch from a diet of plankton to arthropods, amphibians, and fish in salt water, estuaries, rivers, lakes, and ponds until they mature, migrate to spawn, and continue the cycle. In his modern classic Cod, Mark Kurlansky (1998) dubbed the Atlantic cod "the fish that changed the world." But Richard Schweid (2002) pointed out in Consider the Eel that Native Americans and early colonists relied just as much (or perhaps even more) on the American eel as a staple source of protein. Harvest of eels grew from a subsistence enterprise to recreational bait fishing and a valuable commercial fishery in New York. National Marine Fisheries Service data show that landings in the state regularly surpassed 100 metric tons through the mid-1960s, but have since dropped to less than 5 metric tons since the mid-1990s. This prompted the US Fish and Wildlife Service to consider listing the American eel under the Endangered Species Act. Although the Service ultimately decided against listing, its status review identified a range of threats that have contributed to the decline of eel populations (USFWS 2007). The decrease in eel numbers is problematic not only for eel fisheries, but also because eels fill other important ecosystem functions . For example , in the Connecticut River, eels are among the major prey items found in the guts of juvenile striped bass (Schultz et al. 2005). Salt marshes are habitats utilized by this undervalued species (Ford and Mercer 1986). However, eels are notable for their highly plastic life history, during which they utilize a wide range of habitats, including purely marine areas, marshes, eel grass beds, shellfish beds , large mainstem rivers , small creeks , lakes , ponds , and just about any aqueous habitat they can access. Therefore, salt marshes are probably not essential to the persistence of the American eel, although brackish habitats such as marshes within estuaries promote greater growth of eels than nearby freshwater habitats (Morrison and Secor 2003). But a key to the species' success is its diverse habitat use and spreading of risk among multiple habitat types. The loss of any one of those habitats reduces that diversity and concentrates risk in those that remain. Therefore, preservation of salt marshes is important to ensuring the flexible and resilient life history of eels. In fact, beyond their importance to the American eel, healthy marsh systems have been shown to be an important aspects of interconnected habitat mosaics in coastal ecosystems more broadly. Different habi- tats can provide ecological services for one another (e.g., oyster reefs can help stabilize adjacent marshes). They can collectively reinforce other services (e.g., marshes and eelgrass beds are alternative nurseries for many species), and many species use different habitat types during different seasons and at different life stages (Able et al 2007; Rountree and Able 2007). 36 Tidal Marshes of Long Island, Torrey Botanical Society</page><page sequence="4">Figure 2. A bluefish found swimming in offshore waters. 1 Oh Oh a o Not only is connectivity among marshes and adjacent coastal habitat important for the collective function of coastal ecosystems, but connectivity among marsh areas themselves is also important. Unfortunately, the widespread invasive reed Phragmites australis fragments marshes and cuts off once contiguous stands of native marsh grasses (Weinstein and Balletto 1999). An example of a species that benefits from proximal marsh habitat is the humble oyster toadfish ( Opsanus tau). Toadfish occupy a range of structurally complex habitats such as oyster reefs and eel grass beds. They are less common in marshes themselves, but Raposa and Oviatt (2000) reported higher densities of toadfish in eelgrass beds in Great South Bay that are adjacent to marshes than in those adjacent to beaches due to the ecological enhancement provided by the joint marsh-eelgrass mosaic. Like the American eel, oyster toadfish support what today is a small-scale commercial fishery on Long Island. In fact, Long Island's fishery for oyster toadfish is the only one targeting the species on the Atlantic coast. It emerged almost by accident when fishermen harvesting conch discovered that toadfish readily entered conch pots, and more importantly discovered that there was a market for toadfish in the live fish trade in New York City's Chinatown. Many fish species are not suitable for the live fish trade because the stress of handling, transport, and holding in inadequate aquarium systems prevent them from surviving in good condition until sale. But toadfish are notable for their durability, enabling them to survive rigors other fishes could not. One of the most common uses for oyster toadfish is in neurological experiments because they are tough enough to withstand the poking, prodding, and even vivisection involved in this research. But the importance of oyster toadfish for fisheries lies less in their value as a target species and more in their role of structuring shellfish populations. When the supply of oysters in New York Harbor - dubbed The Big Oyster by Mark Kurlansky (2006) for its once rich supply of the tasty bivalves - began to decline in the early nineteenth century, a thriving oyster industry arose in nearby Great South Bay on Long Island. But it did not take long for this population to also begin to decline. The Great South Bay hard clam fishery developed later and held on longer than the oyster fishery. As recently as the mid-1970s, 700,000 bushels of hard clams were harvested from Great South Bay representing 50% of the national harvest (The Nature Conservancy 2005). However, by 2003 - the harvest had dropped to less than 10,000 bu. Long Island's shellfish fisheries are but shadows of what they once were. Fortunately, significant efforts led by The Nature Conservancy are underway in partnership with fellow environmental groups; research institutions; fisher- men; and federal, state, and local governments to re- store shellfish populations and fisheries around Long Island. Many partners in these efforts feel that one of the biggest impediments to successful restoration is overabundance of certain crab species that prey upon juvenile clams, scallops, and oysters and create a demographic bottleneck that the shellfish currently have difficulty passing. However, crabs are common prey of oyster toadfish, and numerous studies report decreases in crab-induced mortality of hard clams when toadfish are present (reviewed by Kritzer 2005). Grabowski (2004) has also demonstrated similar ef- fects of toadfish in lowering mortality of juvenile oysters. The linkages among marshes and toadfish habitats that lead to enhanced toadfish populations (Raposa and Oviatt 2000) suggest that preserving and restoring marshes will support efforts to restore shell- fish populations and fisheries by reestablishing preda- tory controls on crab populations. Notably, crabs also comprise a major component of the diet of American eels in estuaries and marshes (Wenner and Musick 1975), so eels might also be able to benefit shellfish restoration by keeping crab populations on shellfish beds in check. The Role of Salt Marshes in Sustaining Long Island Fisheries 37</page><page sequence="5">Figure 3. Blue crabs ( Callinectes sapidus). 8. O 2 G a Interdependence of Marshes and Marsh-Dwell- ers: The Case of Blue Crabs Another species dependent upon marshes that supports fisheries and provides important ecosystem services is the blue crab ( Callinectes sapidus, Figure 3). Although the iconic fishery in the Chesapeake Bay, immortalized in William Warner's (1976) clas- sic book Beautifiil Swimmers, is more famous, the blue crab fishery on Long Island is significant in its own right. From the early 1990s through 2001 , com- mercial landings in New York regularly exceeded 1 million lbs and $1 million in value (NOAA 2008, Figure 4). Maintaining the blue crab population de- pends upon maintaining extensive and healthy marsh systems. Older blue crabs can be found on both open, soft sediment in shellfish habitats and in vegetated habitats like marshes and eelgrass beds. However, early juveniles are found only in vegetated habitats that provide adequate refuge, with emigration to more open areas taking place only after a critical size threshold is reached (Pile et al. 1996). Blue crabs provide important ecosystem functions alongside their importance as a fishery target. But what is unique about blue crabs is that those functions are essential for maintaining the marsh system itself. Although too many blue crabs on shellfish beds can have detrimental effects on survival and recovery of clams and oysters, too few blue crabs in a marsh can lead to the degradation and eventual loss of the marsh itself. This is because blue crabs not only prey upon bivalve mollusks, but also upon gastropods, includ- ing the periwinkle ( Littoraria irrorata). Periwinkles graze upon marsh plants, and Silliman and Bertness (2002) showed that overgrazing can convert a pro- ductive habitat into a barren mudflat in a matter of months. However, these researchers also showed that blue crabs can prevent this trophic cascade by regu- lating periwinkle populations, provided that the crabs are not overharvested. This system is analogous to the more well-known relationship among sea otters, urchins, and giant kelp on the Pacific coast, wherein eradication of otters can lead to an explosion of ur- chins, overgrazing on kelp, and loss of the kelp forest and the habitat value it provides. Silliman and Bertness (2002) also reported that diamondback terrapins ( Malaclemys terrapin ) simi- larly regulate periwinkles and prevent overgrazing of marsh plants. The diamondback terrapin (Figure 5) is a unique component of the coastal fauna on Long Island, i.e., the only terrapin that resides in brackish habitats. Diamondback terrapins were once hunted widely for turtle soup, but population declines, harvest re- strictions, and changing consumer preferences have reduced directed take of the species. However, ter- rapins are still threatened by both loss and degrada- tion of marsh habitats and bycatch mortality in trap fisheries for crabs. Terrapins are attracted to the same baits as crabs and swim into crab traps to feed. Once in the trap, they cannot escape and eventually drown. Therefore, crab fishing can have a dual impact on marsh health by removing both blue crabs and ter- rapins. Fortunately, simple modifications to crab traps can prevent entry by diamondback terrapins, helping to preserve a unique component of coastal biodiver- sity and to maintain healthy marshes. Summary Fishing as an industry, a recreational opportunity, and a way of life on Long Island is inextricably linked to abundant and healthy salt marshes. In addition to all of the services provided by marshes that help cre- ate productive coastal ecosystems, marshes directly benefit fisheries by providing food and shelter for fishes and invertebrates that are either fisheries targets themselves, provide prey for fisheries targets, struc- ture ecosystems on which fisheries targets depend, or serve several of these roles. Sound management of watershed impacts, coastal development, and use of coastal waters will be essential in ensuring the future of marsh habitats and fisheries on Long Island. Many marshes have been lost or overrun by invasive spe- cies, often the result of anthropomorphic tampering, such as with ditches and impoundments. In order to reclaim these habitats, we should refrain from drain- ing marshes; instead, we need to remove obstructions and avoid replacing them with further excavations that fragment them. In return, we can preserve and ensure a fishing future. 38 Tidal Marshes of Long Island, Torrey Botanical Society</page><page sequence="6">Figure 4. Commercial landings of blue crabs in New York State from 1950 to 2007. Harvest increased steadily to a peak of more than 1000 MT in 1996, but have steadily declined since. If declining harvest reflects declining abundance, this may be due, in part, to loss of marsh nursery habitat, but also might exacerbate marsh loss given the role of the blue crabs in regulating populations of consumers of marsh plants. Data from NOAA (2008) Figure 5. A live diamonback terrapin (Malaclemys terrapin ) amidst others that have drowned inside a crab trap. Salt marshes are critical habitats, not just for the blue crabs, but for diamondback terrapins, as well. They both rely on the salt marsh and help maintain healthy marshes by regulating populations of periwinkles and other consumers of marsh plants.
