<plain_text><page sequence="1">Economic Anthropology: A Study in Com- parative Economics. By MELVILLE J. HER- SKOVITS. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., 1952. xiii, 551, xxiii pp. $5.75. Economic Anthropology is really a second edition of The Economic Life of Primitive Peoples published in 1940. It has been ex- panded with materials from the extensive new literature on the economics of primitive people, and by some reworking of the theoretical chapters. Though it is a second edition, it deserves a full review, since it is the sole work by an American anthropologist dealing with primitive economics. An unusual feature of Economic Anthro- pology is the inclusion of the review of the earlier work by the economic theorist, Frank H. Knight, together with Herskovits' rejoinder. Knight attacks Herskovits for his empiricism and makes a plea for the deductive approach in social science and the use of model analysis. His objections are as much directed at "in- stitutional economists" and sociologists as at Herskovits. They also cover an attack on a sort of social welfare point of view as dis- tinct from "hard-headed" classical economic theory. The rejoinder is a denial of the validity of "economic man" and an insistence that economic analysis must use the real world of primitive life for its analysis; it is a sharp cry for empiricism. I mention this at some length, for in the failure really to lock horns lies a clue to the essential weakness that I feel mars Herskovits' work. For, though we agree that economics builds theoretical systems on a case of one (or at</page><page sequence="2">618 AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW least on a highly selected set of cases), and that the concept of "economic man" is an anthropomorphic reification of outmoded psy- chological notions, yet we are not given an adequate theoretical substitute. Herskovits' re- jection of classical or neo-classical economic theory is not the problem; rather it is his rejection of all theory. Theory, that is, in the formulation of workable hypotheses of systematic interrelationships and their testing in the data at hand. The remainder of this review will be a critique first of Herskovits' anthropological position and second, of his understanding of economics as an aspect of human social behavior. Herskovits belongs squarely in the Boas tradition: elevate the factual and evidential; minimize theory and preconceived hypotheses. All ultimately is culture, and culture is free to develop as it will, unfettered by any laws- environmental, sociological or evolutionary. Now this anarchistic point of view may well be correct, but the ironic fact is that the only way to demonstrate its validity is to assume the opposite; Herskovits' method precludes the possibility that he will ever prove himself to be correct. The position is so anti-evolutionary that it does not even consider proper the word pre- literate, much less primitive; it denies that modern primitives give us direct clues to earlier forms of society, and it avoids any classification of societies. This leads to another irony. For Herskovits, by avoiding all de- velopmental implications lumps together all non-literate societies and counterpoises them to industrial ones. As a result, the reader feels a unity in primitive societies despite Herskovits' explicit denials. His method is to cite cases at random so that, for instance, in the course of the first six pages of the chapter on "Business Enterprise, Credit, and the De- termination of Value" he cites consecutively: Melanesia, Bush Negroes of British Guiana, pre-Spanish Mexico, Plains Indians, Pueblos (Taos), Melanesia (a second group), Yurok Indians of California, Hidatsa Indians, North- west Coast Indians, Navaho. Now it would seem to be the first order of business to invoke some taxonomy of economic systems among primitive people, but there is none. The most feasible and usual taxonomy is on a production basis established in the earliest evolutionary writing; perhaps this ac- counts for the avoidance. Nor is there any classification of types of distribution, of con- sumption, or of any other major economic feature. Yet surely in economic life it is reasonable to presume some order-some lack of uniqueness of each cultural solution-con- sidering how closely economic life is tied to biological demand, natural environment, and technology. On the economic side, Herskovits treats aspects of the economy separately rather than as a system of interrelationships. We can see this in the general organization of the work. Each chapter treats with an economic topic. After an introduction, there are chapters on production (getting a living, patterns of labor, incentives and reward, division of labor), on exchange and distribution (gifts, trade, busi- ness enterprise, consumption and capital forma- tion), property (ownership, land tenure and goods) and on economic surplus (population size and social leisure, government, the super- natural, and display). Each topic is illustrated with data from many tribes (as already noted) to show how differently matters are handled in different cultures. The result is that each subject item is seen as a discrete thing-a sort of annotated dictionary of economic con- cepts as they apply to primitive-i.e., non- literate-societies. But no science is merely a set of concepts; rather, it assumes that there are dynamic and predictable interrelationships between separate phenomena. Such relationships cannot be sought if we examine, say money in chapter XI and land tenure in chapter XV and labor in chapter V. If Herskovits does not believe that such regularities exist in economics, he should either avoid the systematic treatment of it, or should set out systematically and forth- rightly to demonstrate his position. But because he does not examine systems he cannot do this. Now Herskovits is correct when he says that present economic theory applies only to industrial civilization. What is needed is a broader frame of reference in economic theory; broader generalizations regarding man's eco- nomic behavior which will fit the cases found in the literature of anthropology, and in which industrial economic systems find their place as one special case (or several). This, however, he cannot do, because he does not admit of taxonomies of economic forms, regularities in social systems, or the possibility of laws of societal behavior; nor does he see economics as a system of interrelated phenomena. Or, rather, he reduces economics to anthropology, makes everything culture, sui generis. This review has been directed to the implicit theory regarding economic and social behavior; it is admittedly written from certain intel- lectual predilections. It would be highly unfair not to give Herskovits the much credit he is due for bringing together so much data on</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 619 primitive economic life, for orderly presenta- tion and clear exposition, for a valued textbook for courses in primitive economics, and for a reference work.
