T.R.S. ALLAN* INTRODUCTION THE vigour and intensity with which the merits (and correct interpretation) of the ultra vires doctrine have recently been debated attests to the importance that public lawyers now attribute to constitutional theory. It is widely recognised that the propriety of judicial decisions in particular cases depends on the basis and legitimacy of judicial review as a whole-that administrative law is only a department of constitutional law, and that the judicial role therefore raises controversial and sensitive questions of legal authority and constitutional interpretation. Even if the "simple proposition that a public authority may not act outside its powers (ultra vires)" would be widely accepted as "the central principle of administrative law", there would today be much less agreement on the proposition that, in the absence of a written constitution, "the judge must in every case be able to demonstrate that he is carrying out the will of Parliament as expressed in the statute conferring the power".' And even when it is a statutory discretion under review, many public lawyers would question the necessity to fit into "this bed of Procrustes" such various grounds of legal challenge as "unreasonableness, irrelevant considerations, improper motives, breach of natural justice and ... error of law". The startlingly frank admission that the courts "can make the doctrine mean almost anything they wish by finding implied limitations in Acts of Parliament",2 allowing them to "stretch" the notion of ultra vires in order to extend their own * Reader in Legal and Constitutional Theory, University of Cambridge; Fellow of Pembroke College.

It is not surprising that many have thought that the question of the legitimacy of judicial review of administrative action demanded rather more anxious attention. Paradoxically, however, the longer the debate over ultra vires has continued, the smaller has been the increase in light and understanding generated. The respective positions of the opponents and defenders of the ultra vires doctrine have apparently moved closer together, so that the "modified" version of ultra vires-the idea that judicial review is founded on a "general presumption" of legislative intent, authorising the application of common law principles-can be plausibly offered to sceptics as a reasonable compromise: a degree of artificiality should be accepted with good grace in view of the doctrine's basic consistency with constitutional orthodoxy.3 Yet the continuing absence of consensus rather undermines the idea that disagreement has been resolved in favour of a "synthesis" incorporating the best of both worlds, neatly reconciling judicial creativity with the supremacy of Parliament. If the increase in light is not proportionate to the prolongation of the debate, it must be because there is something fundamentally wrong with the debate. I shall argue that, as it is presently conducted, the ultra vires debate makes very little sense. The two schools of thought are each focussed on rather different concerns, reflecting contrasting objectives. In the result, although there is force in the objection that "legislative intent" is largely empty as an explanation of the general nature and scope of judicial review, there is equal force in the reply that, in the application of the various common law grounds of review, legislative intent (suitably interpreted) is or ought to be normally of fundamental importance. Moreover, the objection that legislative intent is plainly irrelevant to the justification of review of non-statutory administrative decisions, especially where the relevant powers are not even strictly governmental, can also be met by pointing to significant differences in the respective forms of judicial control. A "pluralist" or "functionalist" perspective, rejecting the integrated "rule of law" approach of the main protagonists on both sides of the ultra vires debate, could be expected to emphasise that the justification of judicial review must depend on its precise context of operation, rather than on more abstract common law principles of legality.4 3See Christopher Forsyth, "Heat and Light: A Plea for Reconciliation", in Forsyth (ed.), Judicial Revieiw and the Constitution (2000), pp. 408-409. 4 The connections between the ultra vires debate, as currently conducted, and the various schools or styles of public law thought more generally will be examined below. For a helpful account of the main styles of thought, see Martin Loughlin, Public Law and Political Theory 88 [2002]</page><page sequence="3">C.L.J. Constitutional Foundations of Judicial Review In view of the crucial role of the principle of parliamentary sovereignty in the justification of the ultra vires doctrine, it has received remarkably little attention in the course of argument. It has been granted a largely unquestioned status as a matter of existing legal arrangements.5 As Paul Craig has rightly pointed out, however, these related ideas, as interpreted by Sir William Wade, share a similar, questionable formalism.6 Arguments of political principle play no part in the justification of either doctrine: parliamentary sovereignty is defended as simply a political or constitutional "fact"-or, at least, as a political issue beyond strictly legal concern-and the ultra vires doctrine is presented as its necessary counterpart, with the implication that any question of legitimacy beyond that of statutory authorisation (however contrived) is both unnecessary and-legally-beside the point. It is only on the assumption that unqualified parliamentary sovereignty is a matter of acknowledged fact, however desirable or undesirable as an independent question of political morality, that Christopher Forsyth can condemn any notion that there might, after all, be modest limits, imposed by the common law, as inviting an unconstitutional seizure of power by the judges.7 But there is plainly something odd about the attempt to derive a highly elastic and admittedly artificial doctrine of administrative law from a wholly inelastic and supposedly indisputable principle of constitutional law. Although the impetus for the controversy over ultra vires was the accurate perception that its formalist justification was insecure, I shall argue nonetheless that the vice of formalism is not one for which the doctrine's defenders can be held solely to blame. The ultra vires debate is most instructive, in fact, for what it reveals about the general condition of our constitutional theory: it provides a compelling illustration of the formalism that everywhere afflicts our efforts to attain theoretical coherence in public law. If, at the end of the day, those who locate the foundations of judicial review (1992). See also Carol Harlow and Richard Rawlings, Law and Administration, 2nd edn. (1997), chs. 2 &amp; 3. 5 The nature of parliamentary sovereignty is, however, examined by Mark Elliott in the context of his defence of ultra vires: see Elliott, "The Demise of Parliamentary Sovereignty? The Implications for Justifying Judicial Review" (1999) 115 L.Q.R. 119, and The Constitutional Foundations of Judicial Review (2001), ch. 3. Although Elliott is willing to contemplate the existence of (modest) limits to the scope of parliamentary sovereignty, he fails to see their implications for administrative power: see Allan, "The Rule of Law as the Foundation of Judicial Review", in Forsyth (ed.), Judicial Review and the Constitution, pp. 413-414. 6 Paul Craig, "Public Law, Political Theory and Legal Theory" [2000] P.L. 211, at pp. 236-237. See H.W.R. Wade, "The Basis of Legal Sovereignty" [1955] C.L.J. 172. The weaknesses of Wade's theory of sovereignty as a basis for the ultra vires doctrine are perceptively explored by Nicholas Bamforth, "Ultra Vires and Institutional Interdependence", in Forsyth (ed.), Judicial Review and the Constitution. 7 See e.g., Forsyth, "Heat and Light", above, p. 394. 89</page><page sequence="4">The Cambridge Law Journal in the common law secure a hard-won victory over the defenders of ultra vires-vires determined on the basis of legislative intent-it will only be because they have confronted those arguments of political principle whose neglect Craig bemoans, and, having done so, dethroned the principle of unqualified parliamentary sovereignty in consequence. Craig helpfully broadens the focus of debate by study of the history of the courts' supervision of public authorities; and he rightly alludes to Coke's firm belief in the power of the common law to prevent administrative error and abuse.8 He fails, however, to follow the implications of Coke's assertive judicial style, when questions of statutory interpretation arise, through to their logical conclusion.9 Despite their protestations to the contrary, the common law theorists cannot reasonably object to ultra vires, in its very modest "modified" version, while continuing to accept absolute parliamentary supremacy. In that sense, Christopher Forsyth was right to maintain that "weak" critics of ultra vires-those who do not explicitly challenge the sovereignty of Parliament-are "whether they intend it or not ... transmuted into 'strong' critics".'Â° In so far as the common law basis for judicial review is offered as a viable and genuine alternative to legislative intent, broadly understood, it entails at least a limited qualification of legislative power: the opposite conviction, I shall argue, is a symptom of the formalist style of thought that the common lawyers rightly want to resist. Sir John Laws recognises that the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty is a creature of the common law, which represents the "historical consensus of community" in favour of "fundamental civic aspirations" to justice, freedom, and order." But he averts his gaze from the necessary implications of his view that "the common law is logically prior to statute". Craig comes closest to confronting, and confounding, the prevailing formalism when he questions the capacity of the legislature to prohibit the recognition of proportionality (for example) as an independent ground of review: "even accepting traditional notions of sovereignty can one realistically imagine such a statute being drafted and enacted?"12 Although debate has taken the form of an argument between rival camps, each side devoting great intellectual energy and ingenuity to the vindication of its own position, the present 8 Paul Craig, "Ultra Vires and the Foundations of Judicial Review" [1998] C.L.J. 63, at pp. 81- 85, 88. 9 See Allan, Constitutional Justice: A Liberal Theory of the Rule of Law (2001), pp. 204-207. 10 Christopher Forsyth, "Of Fig Leaves and Fairy Tales: The Ultra Vires Doctrine, the Sovereignty of Parliament and Judicial Review" [19961 C.L.J. 122, at p. 134. l Sir John Laws, "Illegality: The Problem of Jurisdiction", in M.

Constitutional Foundations of Judicial Review outcome is almost certainly inconclusive. Neither party enjoys a monopoly of truth; and the sheer difficulty in identifying any practical consequences that necessarily follow from adherence to either model of judicial review-as opposed to the various speculative consequences suggested by the protagonists-should cause us to question the sense of the debate as it is currently conducted. If indeed it turns out that the argument is mainly semantic-the two sides choosing different labels for a process whose principal elements are not disputed-we should conclude that something has gone seriously wrong with our understanding, or at least our representation, of the fundamentals of English public law. The debate is certainly good evidence of a profound unease, on all sides, about the coherence of our basic notions of legality and constitutional legitimacy; but the terms of the debate tend to obscure the primary issues of substance critical to a deeper understanding. Underlying the ultra vires debate is a far more important controversy about the legitimate nature and scope of judicial review, but it is mostly hidden from view by a largely formal or conceptual dispute whose value and point are not clear. In their reluctance to question the nature and extent of parliamentary sovereignty as an existing principle, open to varying interpretations on normative grounds, the chief protagonists occupy a stance somewhat analogous to one of the most prominent critics of judicial review. For J.A.G. Griffith, Sir Stephen Sedley's notion of bi-polar sovereignty13-shared between the courts and Parliament-amounts to an illegitimate usurpation of the power of the executive to govern in accordance with its own conception of the public interest.14 In response to Sedley's explanation that, despite the huge range of functions exclusive to the executive, "neither politically nor legally does it have the last word", Griffith objects that not only may "Government" overturn judicial decisions by legislation, but legislation conferring powers on the executive is itself made by Government through use of its parliamentary majority. In his view, no single institution can exercise unchallengeable power, and the executive enjoys sovereignty within its own sphere; furthermore, its "combination of executive and legislative powers makes Her Majesty's Government the dominant institution to which the other two institutions react".'5 Sedley and Griffith reach different conclusions here because they start from different premises and have contrasting objectives. While 13 Sir Stephen Sedley, "Human Rights: a Twenty-First Century Agenda" [1995] P.L. 386, at p. 389, and "The Common Law and the Constitution", in Lord Nolan of Brasted and Sir Stephen Sedley, The Making and Remaking of the British Constitution (1997), p. 26. 14 J.A.G.

Accordingly, Sedley's emphasis on the principle of separation of powers, which ensures the subjection of executive power to both parliamentary and judicial control, is met by Griffith's denial that the respective institutions perform readily distinguishable functions: government departments and administrative tribunals undertake adjudicative functions, and courts legislate by developing the rules of the common law. This is a familiar British controversy whose persistence reflects the absence of a genuine joinder of issue. The "normativist" defence of the rule of law and separation of powers, based on arguments drawn from political theory, is rejected by a "functionalist" counterclaim, summarising the conclusions drawn by descriptive political science: the "political" constitution is thereby pitted against the "legal" constitution, as if the truth of the one excluded the validity of the other. There is little value in a debate over the true location of "sovereignty" when the term is being used in different senses by those involved. The fact that the executive government has the exclusive function of "putting into effect ... the statutory powers it has inherited as well as the statutory powers it has itself obtained from Parliament"16 is, of course, entirely consistent with the theory of legal sovereignty that Sir Stephen Sedley advances. It does not follow that concerns about the legitimacy of judicial review are in any sense misplaced; and Griffith makes a powerful case for judicial restraint, stressing the inter-penetration of law and politics in cases involving government policy.17 But the relevant issues must be addressed directly: it is not helpful to disguise questions of legal and political principle in the garb of descriptive, "factual" commentary. The ultra vires debate is marked by a similar confusion; and the confusion is shared by almost all protagonists. Instead of confronting the interpretative assumptions of the ultra vires defenders, questioning their understanding of the location of sovereignty as a matter of legal theory, the common lawyers attempt to deny only the conclusions carefully drawn by their opponents on the basis of those assumptions. And when close attention is paid to the mainly logical arguments on which the proponents of ultra vires rely, they prove fairly resilient to the critics' attack. Once we grasp the very modest character of the ultra vires doctrine, as a purely conceptual rationalisation, we can perceive the inability of familiar objections-whether descriptive, 16 Ibid., p. 49. 17 See also Griffith, The Politics of the Judiciary, 5th edn.

It can be assailed only by challenging its essential postulate-the unfettered sovereignty of Parliament. THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONTEXT OF JUDICIAL REVIEW A number of these themes occur in the recent work of Jeffrey Jowell, who has rightly sought to place the ultra vires debate within a broader constitutional canvass. In an approach that bears some resemblance to the principal concerns of the functionalists, he has emphasised the questions of constitutional and institutional competence that should inform any serious effort to justify the judicial role.18 It is not the province of the courts, when judging the administration, Jowell argues, to "make their own evaluation of the public good"; and there are inherent limitations to the process of adjudication that render some matters non-justiciable. Questions of procedure rather than substance are those in which the courts are most fully qualified to pronounce: "Procedure is a quintessentially justiciable issue, summoning arguments of principle addressed to discernable criteria and imposing no undue strain upon the adjudicative process."19 His preference for a modified version of the common law justification for judicial review recognises the central role of constitutional principle: "Vires becomes power in context; it respects identifiable legislative intent, but draws the very practical inference that our legislature is legislating in and for a society governed by a framework of democracy, of which the legislature is a vital but not the only part, and in which the supremacy of Parliament and the rule of law are crucial but not the only guiding tenets."20 Athough a welcome attempt to integrate conceptual and normative reasoning, Jowell's approach nonetheless fails to escape the formalism characteristic of orthodox thought; and his quick dismissal of the ultra vires theory of judicial review fails to carry conviction. His perfectly reasonable concession that judicial review of a statutory discretion, if legitimate, "must always begin with an assessment of vires-of the powers intended by a legislative scheme" seriously weakens his objection to the ultra vires doctrine, as explained by its adherents, who do not for a moment deny his claim that those powers "must not be construed in a vacuum".21 It is surely common ground that the courts should "engage directly 18 Jeffrey Jowell, "Of Vires and Vacuums: The Constitutional Context of Judicial Review" [1999] P.L. 448. '9 Ibid., p. 452. 20 Ibid., p. 458. 21 Ibid., p. 460. 93</page><page sequence="8">The Cambridge Law Journal with constitutional principle"; and it is only a caricature of the ultra vires doctrine that supposes that the court must "summon the medium in the statute to thump out a message on the table" on behalf of the relevant principle.22 Moreover, Jowell's admission that "it is the prerogative of Parliament" to undermine democracy by overriding constitutional principle, however fundamental, threatens to reduce his defence of the common law, as the true basis of judicial review, to radical incoherence.23 If it is true, as Jowell argues,24 that "we have moved significantly towards a model of democracy that is based upon limited government, rather than majority rule alone"-a "fundamental shift" that is not dependent on, but only accelerated by operation of, the Human Rights Act-there must be practical consequences for a largely formal theory of absolute parliamentary sovereignty. The familiar refrain, in which almost all public lawyers still happily join, that Parliament can exclude any and every right "by express language or necessary implication", is really a fudge, designed to obscure some awkward questions of constitutional authority. Once we accept that the courts now properly enforce "a higher order of rights inherent in our constitutional democracy", and recognise that such rights "emanate not from any implied parliamentary intent but from the framework of modern democracy within which Parliament legislates", we have repudiated unqualified majority rule.25 One cannot have it both ways. If, as Jowell accepts, following the lead of Sir John Laws, fundamental rights are "not a consequence of the democratic process but logically prior to it", they cannot, without logical contradiction, be abrogated by simple parliamentary majority. Laws insists that ultimate sovereignty "rests, in every civilised constitution, not with those who wield governmental power, but in the conditions under which they are permitted to do so".26 Parliament's "sovereignty" cannot itself be a creature of statute, but rests on judicial interpretation of the unwritten constitution: "a higher-order law confers it, and must of necessity limit it".27 Like Laws, Jowell rightly acknowledges the role of substantive principles of freedom and justice in judicial review, reflecting the common law's necessary engagement with political ideals. He is also right to suggest that the true grounds of 22 Ibid., p. 458. 23 Ibid., pp. 458-459. 24 Jowell, "Beyond the Rule of Law: Towards Constitutional Judicial Review" [2000] P.L. 671, at pp. 671-672. 25 Ibid., p. 675. 26 Sir John Laws, "Law and Democracy" [1995] P.L. 72, at p. 92. 27 Ibid., p. 87. 94 [2002]</page><page sequence="9">C.L.J. Constitutional Foundations of Judicial Review judicial intervention in particular cases are often hidden beneath a familiar but hollow rhetoric, which obscures much more than it reveals: beyond the confines of procedure, strictly understood, the courts "do all they can to cover their tracks by laying false clues and donning elaborate camouflage".28 But there are limits to his own willingness to strip the grounds of review bare of conventional, but misleading, metaphor and opaque distinctions. Jowell recognises that many of the common law principles of administrative legality find their true basis in the rule of law, which encompasses the requirements of natural justice and, in some contexts, informs the application of standards of irrationality or unreasonableness. However, his preference for an interpretation of the rule of law that limits its protection to a purely formal equality-equality before the law, whatever its content happens to be-obliges him to make awkward distinctions between concepts of irrationality and proportionality, and these distinctions ultimately prove untenable.29 The elusive nature of the distinctions between categories of legitimate expectation, and their respective forms of judicial protection, provides a clear example of the problem. Once it is accepted, in principle, that there are circumstances in which the court may intervene to prevent a public authority from acting inconsistently with a person's expectation, beyond an expectation that is merely procedural in character, one cannot conceal the truth that, "Juger l'administration, c'est aussi administrer".30 If, as Martin Loughlin has suggested, the substitution of a flexible doctrine of procedural fairness for the mainly formal rules of natural justice is responsible for a crisis of legitimacy,31 the crisis has been compounded. Laws L.J. may well proclaim that fairness and reasonableness, in the present context, are "objective concepts", seeking to refute the suspicion that public law is only "palm tree justice" (while frankly admitting that "each is a spectrum, not a single point, and they shade into one another").32 But the "objective" structure of legal doctrine that confined judicial review primarily to the realm of procedure has, to a high degree, been displaced by judicial discretion to interfere in matters of substance. When the Wednesbury principle is acknowledged to constitute "a sliding scale of review, more or less intrusive 28 Jowell, "Of Vires and Vacuums", above, p. 454. 29 See Allan, Law, Liberty, and Justice (1993), ch. 8, and Constitutional Justice, ch. 5. 30 J.D.B.

Even the distinction between procedure and substance is more problematic, moreover, than Jowell seems to recognise. It has been an important theme of those hostile to judicial review that the imposition on administrative agencies of judicial conceptions of fair procedure-in the name of constitutional principle-can impede the efficient conduct of business on behalf of the public interest.34 Constitutional review, if that is how the courts' jurisdiction should now be described, must rest on firmer grounds than our administrative law has yet provided; but the common law has powerful resources on which to draw, including a largely implicit conception of the rule of law. Whether or not, as Jowell expressly denies, the rule of law can "accommodate a number of principles which are enshrined in the written constitutions of other democracies, such as freedom of expression, the right to life, dignity, or even the notion of substantive ... equality",35 depends on its detailed articulation, and the underpinning theory of limited government that renders it a unified and coherent doctrine. It is only in the context of such a theory that we can determine the true merits of the common law alternative to ultra vires-a doctrine that, in so frankly admitting the independent role of the judiciary, "presents a provocative challenge to traditional British constitutional doctrine by seemingly conferring an open-ended law- making power on unelected judges, leading perhaps to the review even of primary legislation".36 It is not, however, necessary to accept the unrestricted supremacy of the legislature in order to deny the courts an "open- ended law-making" power. In that respect, Griffith's insistence on the interdependence of the main institutions contains an important insight.37 Moreover, the "legal" and "political" constitutions must be brought into harmony, as complementary rather than contradictory viewpoints. But such a harmony can be achieved only by a persuasive interpretation of the constitution, sensitive to both the political realities of practical governance and the demands of a contemporary political morality. If it is true, as a prominent 33 Ibid. 34 See generally Harlow and Rawlings, Law and Administration, 2nd edn., ch. 15. 35 Jowell, "Beyond the Rule of Law", above, p. 673. 36 Jowell, "Of Vires and Vacuums", above, p. 449. 37 The interdependence of courts and Parliament, as regards ultimate constitutional authority, is a principal theme of Bamforth's essay, "Ultra Vires and Institutional Interdepence", in Forsyth (ed.), Judicial Review and the Constitution.</page><page sequence="11">C.L.J. Constitutional Foundations of Judicial Review 97 defender of ultra vires has claimed in its defence, that the "unwritten constitution consists very largely of things that appear to be one thing but are in fact another",38 what we need for better understanding is a theory that, while true to the political facts, offers a moral justification for the legal conclusions we choose to draw from them. The Futility of the Conceptual Debate Over Ultra Vires The two sides in the debate over ultra vires may best be understood, perhaps, as having rather different (but perfectly compatible) objectives. The "common law" theorists propose to lay bare the nature and origins of the legal standards applied by the courts in judicial review. We shall understand these matters more clearly, they believe, when we dispense with fictional and misleading references to legislative intent: these serve only to disguise what is truly a common law enterprise in which the judges fashion and apply what they deem to be appropriate standards of legality to govern the conduct of statutory agencies. The rival "ultra vires" school offers instead a response to an objection that the common lawyers' emphasis on judicial creativity might seem to court: the judges are in danger of flouting Parliament's sovereign will by curtailing the discretion of public agencies, impeding their ability (at least in some circumstances) to achieve their statutory goals. These theorists offer the answer that Parliament may reasonably be supposed to agree that all public authorities should meet generally applicable standards of rationality and fairness, at least in the absence of very clear evidence to the contrary. Viewed in this way, it should be obvious that these respective positions are complementary rather than opposed. For the common law theorists, the various grounds of review are "judicial creations", owing "neither their existence nor their acceptance to the will of the legislature".39 The nature and degree of judicial scrutiny of administrative action that these grounds permit or enjoin are inherently variable: they reflect the judges' current perceptions of what political morality requires rather than developing insight into legislative intention. The ultra vires doctrine, by attributing the justification for judicial review to legislative intent, obscures this reality and offers only a formal basis for any specific mode of review, whose legitimacy must be established by recourse to the reasons that explain its adoption. It is generally accepted that private law imposes legitimate constraints on both Christopher Forsyth, "Of Fig Leaves and Fairy Tales", above, at p. 136. ' Sir John Laws, "Law and Democracy" [1995] P.L. 72, at p. 79.</page><page sequence="12">The Cambridge Law Journal private persons and public bodies, according to principles developed at common law; and we should take a similar approach to public law: the scope of review "can only be legitimated in the same way as other common law powers, by asking whether there is a reasoned justification which is acceptable in normative terms for the controls which are being imposed".40 The defenders of ultra vires, for their part, acknowledge the truth that the heads of review derive their general character from the common law, but deny that their legitimacy, in specific application, can be established without reference to the statutory source of the relevant power. The sovereignty of Parliament, it is generally accepted, entails the consequence that judicial review should be consistent with the legislative purposes that underlie and inform any specific assertion of statutory power, duly faithful to those purposes. What an "all-powerful Parliament does not prohibit, it must authorise", whether expressly or impliedly,41 at least in the sense that any limits imposed on a statutory power by the courts must either conform to-i.e. be consistent with-or contradict the legislative will. If Parliament grants a minister a power, he acts either within the scope of the power or outside it, at least in the sense that his actions are either legally valid, obtaining requisite legislative authorisation, or invalid: "There is no grey area between authorisation and prohibition or between empowerment and the denial of power."42 (This interpretation, implicit in the defence of ultra vires as a conceptual rationalisation, is roughly equivalent to the doctrine's opponents' adherence to common law principles whenever Parliament has not clearly overridden them.)43 Mark Elliott's "modified" ultra vires doctrine deserves our respect as an attempt to state a generally acceptable position, reflecting the principal strengths and weaknesses on both sides of the argument; and he is surely right to argue that "any attempt to choose between legislative intention and judicial endeavour as the real basis of the supervisory jurisdiction is ultimately futile".44 Even if the ultra vires doctrine, as traditionally explained, has seemed to place more weight on a fiction of parliamentary approval than it could comfortably bear, it is now readily conceded that the relevant intention is only abstract and "indirect". The rules governing the exercise of administrative power, where conferred by statute, must 40 Paul Craig, "Ultra Vires and the Foundations of Judicial Review", above, at p. 90. 41 Christopher Forsyth, "Of Fig Leaves and Fairly Tales: The Ultra Vires Doctrine, the Sovereignty of Parliament and Judicial Review" [1996] C.L.J. 122, at p. 133. 42 Ibid. 43 See e.g., Paul Craig, "Competing Models of Judicial Review" [1999] P.L. 428, at p. 439. 44 Mark Elliott, "The Ultra Vires Doctrine in a Constitutional Setting: Still the Central Principle of Administrative Law" [1999] C.L.J. 129, at p. 131. 98 [2002]</page><page sequence="13">C.L.J. Constitutional Foundations of Judicial Review be "viewed as having been made pursuant to a constitutional warrant granted by Parliament".45 Constitutional orthodoxy is thereby affirmed, without denial of the courts' creative role in developing the principles of administrative law, by invoking the reasonable assumption that Parliament intends to legislate in accordance with the rule of law. The various grounds of review of executive power express different, but closely related, dimensions of the rule of law. So Parliament must be "taken to withhold from decision-makers the power to act unfairly and unreasonably, while recognising that the detailed requirements of fairness and rationality can most appropriately be determined incrementally by the courts ..."46 In that abstract but perfectly intelligible sense, Parliament may be said to grant the judges a discretion-or "imprimatur"47-to determine the precise limits of, or conditions on, an agency's power. At the heart of continued opposition to the ultra vires doctrine, even in its newly elaborated and most reasonable guise, is clearly an antipathy to the formalism for which it now seems-perhaps more than ever before-such a provocative emblem. The greater its capacity to meet its critics' objections, by frank admission of its "indirect" or constructive character, the weaker its claim to possess any genuine content independent of ordinary common law reasoning in particular cases. "Legislative intent" turns out to be largely empty, as a justification for judicial interference with executive power, since it simply directs us to back to the application of the common law grounds of review. The specific content of the relevant "legislative intent" will in practice be "determined by the courts in accord with whatsoever they choose to include within it pursuant to the rule of law ideal".48 Any and every limit on executive discretion will always, by circular reasoning, be inherent in the grant of power.49 Now, the antipathy to formalism that motivates the common lawyers' dislike of ultra vires is fully understandable, and the associated demand for more direct attention to be paid to questions of normative justification must be applauded. But we should also note that if the main objection to ultra vires is now only its insistence on the "formal bow to general legislative intent", beyond which the modified doctrine is "very similar to that propounded by 45 Ibid., p. 143. 46 Ibid. 47 Forsyth, "Of Fig Leave and Fairy Tales", p. 135. 48 Craig, "Competing Models of Judicial Review", above, at p. 431. 49 See further Paul Craig and Nicholas Bamforth, "Constitutional Analysis, Constitutional Principle and Judicial Review" [2001] P.L. 763, at pp. 771-772. 99</page><page sequence="14">The Cambridge Law Journal the common law model",50 continued opposition to that doctrine starts to look as formalistic as the position it condemns. And there are, in any case, more substantial grounds for thinking that the vices of formalism are fairly evenly shared. Could the ultra vires defenders not bring their own similar charges against the common law school? Is not their reliance on such open-ended categories as "procedural impropriety", "illegality", and "irrationality", in stressing the basis of the court's jurisdiction in the common law, not quite as futile and self-serving as the ultra vires defenders' invocation of legislative intent? Does anyone really imagine that such labels do more than announce the conclusions of legal analysis-an analysis that must focus on all the pertinent details of the particular case, including the statute that confers the administrative power? If it is true, as is claimed, that enabling legislation will often afford "scant guidance" about which considerations are properly relevant to the exercise of discretion and which are not,51 it is equally true that no sensible conclusions could be drawn without close attention to the statutory scheme. As Elliott observes, it is the enabling statute that inevitably defines the "jurisdiction" of the public agency, in the narrow sense of its proper sphere of action.52 (And this is so even if it is also true that it may be controversial whether any particular statutory requirement should be treated as a jurisdictional condition.) And he is right to insist that the other grounds of review-those that determine the agency's jurisdiction in its broader sense-cannot be applied without regard to legislative intention, even if such intention must be collected from a sense of the overall statutory scheme or purpose. Legislative intention-at least in the broad sense that the courts must be faithful to the statutory scheme as a whole-is plainly relevant to the application of the various grounds of review, even if it is thought irrelevant to their abstract formulation and intellectual defence. We should draw the following conclusions. Neither the ultra vires nor the common law school is yet entitled to claim a convincing victory; but Elliott certainly deserves our gratitude for his attempt to formulate a mid-way position, rejecting the more extreme stances that the rival schools are sometimes thought to represent. In so far as he is successful in delineating "a foundation for administrative law which combines the best features of the two models" of review, Elliott is surely on the right track: at some level, 50 Craig, "Competing Models of Judicial Review", at p. 431. 51 Craig, "Ultra Vires and the Foundations of Review", at p. 67. 52 Elliott, "Legislative Intention Versus Judicial Creativity?

Constitutional Foundations of Judicial Review however abstract, the preservation of the standards of legality demanded by the rule of law should "properly be presented as a co-operative endeavour", engaging both courts and Parliament.53 If, then, we remain dissatisfied with his conclusions, it is because the debate has to a large degree been misconceived. Instead of escaping the formalism that the common lawyers set out to eradicate, we have only entrenched it by casting the discussion in essentially sterile and overly conceptual terms. The common law theorists have, it might be said ungenerously, substituted one brand of formalism for another. Conducted in highly abstract and formal terms, the ultra vires debate is essentially a substitute for a different argument, concerning the nature, scope and legitimacy of judicial review. A largely semantic tussle has threatened to conceal what is really at stake by deflecting our attention towards ever greater refinements of a purely formal doctrine, susceptible of varying interpretations or understandings. The common lawyers have been right to object to the incapacity of a formal doctrine of ultra vires to provide the necessary justification for judicial review; but they have surely exaggerated its evils. Once its formal nature has been duly exposed, and generally conceded, it is merely a convenient conclusionary label, powerless to fool anyone that the judges are only the helpless mouthpieces of an indomitable and all-encompassing parliamentary will. Its particular merit, it may fairly be claimed, is its ability to exhibit the logical connection between a judgment of illegality (or any other breach of the various grounds of review) and the conclusion that an administrative decision is void. The possibility of collateral challenge depends on the invalidity of the decision impugned; and the ultra vires doctrine, however formal its nature, neatly captures the crucial idea that the decision-maker has exceeded the limits of his jurisdiction-a jurisdiction conferred (and so defined, at least in part) by the enabling statute.54 THE RULE OF LAW AND PARLIAMENTARY SOVEREIGNTY Further reflection shows us that the circumlocutions and ingenuities characteristic of the ultra vires debate, in its sophisticated present form, betray our defective understanding of constitutional fundamentals. The participants on both sides-ultra vires defenders and their common law adversaries-are united in affirming their adherence to parliamentary sovereignty (at least for purposes of the 53 Ibid., p. 369. 54 Ibid., pp. 364-368.

The legitimacy of the Anisminic case,55 notwithstanding its brusque treatment of the statutory ouster clause, is one of the fixed points that mark the boundaries of the debate, rather than a point of contention between the two sides. What is missing here is an appropriately nuanced account of the nature and limits of legislative power. For while we adhere to an entirely formal or literal conception of sovereignty, apparently permitting a legislative majority to attain any object it chooses by employing suitably explicit language, our constitutional theory can never reflect our knowledge of the legal and political landscape it is supposed to explain. Parliamentary supremacy should be accepted in the sense that the legislature alone enjoys the sovereign power to alter the law by enactment of general rules; but we should also recognise, as equally fundamental, that Parliament's power to determine the outcome of particular cases is confined by the judges' duty to make sense of the law as a whole. Each person's rights and duties are those that relevant statutes confer or impose, when fairly construed in the light of general principles of justice deriving their constitutional status (at least primarily) from the common law. Recognition of the bi-polar sovereignty truly characteristic of British government is a necessary consequence of the fundamental idea that Parliament is sovereign "only in respect of what it expresses by the words used in the legislation it has passed".56 Since all such words require interpretation, their meaning is as much dependent on the values represented by the ideal of the rule of law, when these are duly explained and defended, as on the more immediate public purposes that may shape the statutory context.57 Sir John Laws's reasons for repudiating the ultra vires doctrine are instructive here. Accepting (contrary to the logic of his own arguments)58 that the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty "remains the plainest constitutional fundamental at the present time", and denying Christopher Forsyth's claim that opposition to the ultra vires principle entails an attack on sovereignty, Laws wishes nevertheless to safeguard "fundamental constitutional rights".59 These rights, increasingly protected by "the developed doctrines of modern public law", cannot logically "be a function of ' Anisminic Ltd. v.

He fears, however, that by representing judicial decisions as the execution of Parliament's will we may "obscure and undermine" the courts' duty to defend constitutional rights.60 There may even be reference to Hansard in order to show that the intention in promoting a Bill, on its face benign, was to facilitate executive action in breach of these rights. Laws's reasoning goes astray because it mistakenly equates the settled doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty with unfettered power to violate constitutional rights. But that doctrine (as Laws himself accepts) is itself only a creature of the common law, albeit a potent one, and therefore part of a wider constitutional fabric now understood to include and safeguard fundamental rights. If it is true that Parliament may only override such rights by "express, focussed provision",61 that is because it is rightly presumed to intend their protection unless there are powerful reasons against it. And the stronger the right, as a matter of general principle, and the weaker the reasons suggested for infringing or restricting it, the more clearly expressed and focussed the relevant provision must be; in some cases there will be no language appropriate to authorise executive action whose legality could be affirmed only at the cost of constitutional breakdown. It is a mistake to suppose that language has a meaning independent of context; and the present context includes the constitutional rights and general principles that make up the enduring background of assumption and understanding that renders any legislation intelligible. Any reference to Hansard, designed to displace a construction sensitive to constitutional principle by a reading more fully attuned to the intentions of a bill's promoter, would therefore be of questionable propriety. Resort to ministerial explanations, though sanctioned in principle by Pepper v. Hart,62 should not be allowed to usurp the courts' independent constitutional role.63 The intention of Parliament is not to be confused with a governmental intention, or even with the unexpressed preferences of a majority of legislators. It is, in accordance with established constitutional principle, a more abstract intention, judicially constructed by tempering the general purposes of the Act with the legal safeguards that the rule of law embodies.64 We cannot, then, discard the role of parliamentary Ibid., pp. 4.18-4.19.

Sir John Laws objects that "ultra vires must logically reduce the constitutional norms of public law to the same condition of moral neutrality as in principle applies to legislation, because by virtue of it the decisions of the courts are only a function of Parliament's absolute power".65 This means, he thinks, that "the goodness of the common law is as short or as long as the legislature's wisdom". But there is no such principle of "moral neutrality"; nor does Parliament have "absolute power". As one institution among others that together comprise the governmental machinery of a firmly established liberal democracy, Parliament holds its legislative power in trust to secure the general good. To contemplate its exercise of "absolute" power for other ends, inimical to a broadly defensible common good, is not political realism but rather formalist abstraction. In the real world, in which laws must be understood and applied in the context of existing tradition and reasonable assumption, statute and common law must co-exist in constitutional harmony, secured by means of interpretation whose moral validity can be widely acknowledged. It follows that Elliott is right to conclude that it is "the simple-and wholly plausible-assumption that Parliament intends to legislate consistently with the rule of law which bridges the apparent gulf between legislative silence and the developed body of administrative law which today regulates the use of executive discretion".66 But the "legislative silence" is only a notional one, for the relevant assumption is not merely plausible but fundamental and ineradicable (short of revolution or constitutional breakdown). And he is right to resist the view that Parliament should be considered to be "neutral" about the scope of administrative power or its manner of exercise. The preservation of the rule of law, as a basic protection against arbitrary power, is always an essential first premise; and the danger of serious conflict between parliamentary intent and common law principle therefore dissolves in the process of judicial construction, faithful to the general constitutional scheme. The courts' standard treatment of ouster clauses, exemplified in Anisminic, may be quite properly understood, therefore, as the consequence of a mode of interpretation dictated by the rule of law. But since there are constitutional limits to Parliament's capacity to insulate the executive from judicial 65 Laws, "Illegality", p. 4.19. 66 Elliott, "The Ultra Vires Doctrine in a Constitutional Setting", at p. 143. 104 [2002]</page><page sequence="19">Constitutional Foundations of Judicial Review review-limits intrinsic to the polity as a constitutional democracy that embodies the rule of law-it is a mode of interpretation impervious to serious legislative contradiction.67 It is Laws's mistaken supposition that Parliament can "abrogate the rule of law", by "an express measure to that effect", that underlies the sharp distinction he makes between legislative intent and constitutional principle.68 But in addition to the obvious problem that, in practice, an ouster clause may prove ineffective to exclude judicial review, even though it is clearly an "express measure" to that general effect, the necessity for some underlying presumption of legislative intent seems inescapable if parliamentary sovereignty is at the same time to be affirmed. As Elliott explains the point, unless the effect of an ouster clause is "neutralised by such a presumption, the courts' failure to give effect to it amounts to outright disobedience to Parliament".69 If Parliament cannot be presupposed to intend the preservation of judicial review, at least in ordinary circumstances, there is no basis on which to resist the "plain and natural meaning"70 of the ouster clause without frank disobedience to the parliamentary command. Laws and Elliott are both, however, ultimately guilty of the same formalist error. The perplexities they seek to overcome arise from the unacceptable premise that Parliament's sovereignty extends to "abrogation" of the rule of law, as if persons deriving their powers from a constitution (whether "written" or "unwritten") could lawfully use them to destroy or undermine it. Laws is, then, fully entitled to attribute judicial treatment of ouster clauses to "constitutional principle", independent of any actual (rather than merely presumptive) legislative will. For the truth is that, in some circumstances, the relevant presumptions of intent are frankly irrebuttable, reflecting a judgment about the necessary implications of the rule of law.7' The division of opinion here between the ultra vires and common law schools is for all practical purposes illusory; and their different ways of expressing similar conclusions reflect their mutual attachment to a formal principle of parliamentary sovereignty that conceals the true complexity of the relations between courts and Parliament. When all parties are ready to acknowledge openly what everyone knows is the legal and political reality-that "parliamentary intent" is essentially a fiction, facilitating a balance of power between the executive, as chief promoter of legislation, and the courts, as its interpreters-the ultra 67 See Allan, Constitutional Justice, pp. 210-213. 68 Laws, "Illegality", pp. 4.23-4.26. 69 Elliott, "Legislative Intention Versus Judicial Creativity", p. 361. 70 Ibid., p. 363. 71 Cf.

We should not suppose that there is any single, uniform answer to the question of whether Parliament can exclude judicial review- any more than we should imagine that there is truly a "plain and natural meaning" of a statutory provision, capable (with or without the use of presumptions) of securing that result. The court's decision, in any particular case, will depend on the nature and scale of the error or injustice disclosed, on the one hand, and the cogency (in the circumstances arising) of the reasons that can be discerned for restricting access to the courts, on the other-just as the true meaning of the statutory words is a function of purpose and context, not simply the result of consulting a dictionary. The notion of the "literal" meaning of a statutory provision is as much a fiction as the "absolute" power of Parliament: both conceptions stem from inadequate grasp of the social and political context which constitutional theory must address if it is to have any real explanatory power. Should we really accept (as even Elliott's "attenuated sovereignty principle" requires) that Parliament retains the "capacity to create arbitrary discretionary power to which no requirements of fairness and rationality attach"?72 Although Elliott is right to emphasise the central constitutional role of the courts' interpretative power, in respect of statute, he fails to recognise the fundamental status of the political morality that such a power invokes. Yet its fundamental nature, as a source of constitutional law, is actually assumed by much of his argument. So he objects that, in so far as the common law model of review treats Parliament as being "agnostic" as regards an agency's compliance with the ordinary precepts of administrative legality, it attributes "absurd" intentions to the legislature. Parliament cannot, without absurdity, intend a delegated rule-making power to be used to create vague regulations, so imprecise as to be incapable of obedience.73 It is equally absurd to suppose that Parliament would confer discretionary power free from restrictions on its "outrageous" use in "defiance of logic or of accepted moral standards".74 On the common law view, Elliott complains, "Parliament's will would not be frustrated or contradicted by the official who sits as judge in his own cause or by the minister who makes a decision which is so flagrantly discriminatory or contrary to common sense that it must, on any view, be regarded as 72 Elliott, "The Demise of Parliamentary Sovereignty?", above, at p. 132. 73 Elliott, "Legislative Intention Versus Judicial Creativity", pp. 355-356. 74 Council of Civil Service Unions v.

Constitutional Foundations of Judicial Review irrational".75 In so far as the limits on official discretion must conform to the legislative will, correctly interpreted, they preclude the attribution to Parliament of inconsistent (or non-existent) intentions.76 Now these conclusions assume what can indeed be taken for granted in a liberal democracy, in which power is understood to be exercisable only in good faith in pursuit of some defensible conception of the public good. In less benign regimes, however, governments may find vague regulations an extremely useful source of power, leaving maximum official discretion to decide each case, or administer punishment for disobedience, according to political convenience.77 It is, of course, our attachment to values of personal liberty and autonomy that fuels our abhorrence of unconstrained discretion: the principle of legal certainty need have no special status in an illiberal or iniquitous regime. Similarly, what is unacceptable discrimination or otherwise "contrary to common sense" depends on the assumptions that inform our general theoretical enterprise. But then what is "absurd" in the context of statutory interpretation cannot at the same time be legally unobjectionable when we try to determine the limits of legislative power. Parliament's power to legislate is circumscribed, for all practical purposes, by the extent of its ability to encapsulate its intentions (or those of a Bill's promoters) within a statutory text, intelligible to official and citizen alike in the light of shared assumptions about the proper uses of statutory power. These assumptions may, in some circumstances, impose only weak and highly elastic constraints; but their exclusion from a central place in our constitutional theory is bound to deny it coherence. The tendency to identify parliamentary intention with a governmental objective-or even a speculative assessment of what a majority of legislators would have preferred if a problem of interpretation had actually been foreseen-has been the cause of widespread misunderstanding. It lies at the root of much agonising over the plausibility of treating Parliament as "neutral" or "agnostic" as regards the various grounds of judicial review. Laws has accused Forsyth of mistakenly assuming that authorisation and prohibition exhaust the possibilities; but there may be common law constraints on the exercise of statutory power about which Parliament has expressed no opinion.78 Andrew Halpin offers 75 Elliott, The Constitutional Foundations of Judicial Review, p. 141. 76 Ibid., pp. 141-144. (As regards non-existent intentions, see discussion below.) 77 The South African experience provides a pertinent example: see Forsyth, "Of Fig Leaves and Fairy Tales", above, pp. 129-131, and David Dyzenhaus, "Reuniting the Brain: The Democratic Basis of Judicial Review" (1998) 9 P.L.R. 98, at p. 101. 78 Laws, "Illegality", pp. 4.17-4.18. 107</page><page sequence="22">The Cambridge Law Journal various suggestions to illustrate the point: Parliament may never have debated the matter in issue, for example; or the legislative timetable may have "precluded relevant parliamentary intention being formed" before enactment of the Bill in question.79 When, however, it is understood that parliamentary intention is really a metaphor-calling our attention in anthropomorphic terms to the claims of the statutory text to respectful treatment, consistent with our loyalty to democratic values-we can see that argument over the formal logic of the ultra vires theory is entirely beside the point. Contrary to Halpin's assertion, that model does not assume an understanding of sovereignty "capable of excluding the logical possibility" of parliamentary agnosticism or neutrality; nor does it suppose that "Parliament has worked out and adopted a set of standards of reasonableness" generally applicable to the exercise of discretionary power80-and for exactly the same reasons. The "legislative intention" that the ultra vires theory invokes is a purely figurative one, expressing merely the compatibility or consistency of judicially-imposed limits with the duty of loyal obedience to the statutory scheme. Such a very modest theory certainly courts an accusation of emptiness; but vacuity should not be confused with logical error or conceptual confusion.81 Nor is Elliott fairly accused of "romanticism" when he urges us to attribute a similar attachment to fundamental values to both courts and Parliament. The basis of Elliott's appeal, properly understood, is not some actual legislative will, discoverable by some suitable investigative procedure, but ultimately the shared values and assumptions (however abstract or inchoate) that enable the different institutions to function as branches or departments of the same, integrated system of government. A satisfactory account of judicial review holds that the courts, legislature, and executive are not "best viewed as engaged in a struggle with each other for sovereign power", but rather "as engaged in a collaborative enterprise whose common aim is to live up to and develop the fundamental values of legal order".82 79 Andrew Halpin, "The Theoretical Controversy Concerning Judicial Review" (2001) 64 M.L.R. 500, at p. 504.

Constitutional Foundations of Judicial Review COMMON LAW PRINCIPLES AND LEGAL PLURALISM Halpin's scepticism is not confined to the merits of the ultra vires doctrine; he raises some important doubts about the principal claims of both the doctrine's defenders and its critics. In his view, the rule of law has become both "a prop in a fairy story", on the ultra vires side, and at the same time a "fig leaf" by which the common lawyers disguise the origin of the principles of judicial review as "bare judicial contructs".83 He thinks that the debate presupposes the existence of "substantive legal authority" for the principles of judicial review, but that the absence of such authority, as a matter of legal reality, denies the sense of seeking its true location: "What neither side is prepared to countenance is the prospect that the law enacted by Parliament, or found in the principles of the common law, does not provide an answer to the question: what conditions should attach to the exercise of a power that Parliament has created?"84 However, neither ultra vires defenders nor their opponents seek to conceal the judicial creativity responsible for the legal controls applied to the exercise of administrative power. There appears to be general agreement (among the main protagonists) that such creativity should be celebrated as a sign of the health and vitality of the common law. Moreover, the various grounds of review, or categories of abuse of power, are now clearly established elements of the common law, at least in their abstract form as components of the general principle of legality. It is true that standards of reasonableness or unreasonableness leave a great deal of discretion to courts, whose exercise-especially in public law-may invoke a range of more specific values; it is also true that some of these values will be contestable, whether as regards their general relevance or their detailed application. But none of this denies their status as legal standards, except in the wholly trivial sense that they entail resort to moral judgment. There is, nevertheless, a deeper sense in which Halpin's general scepticism is surely justified. For if the settled grounds of review are really only conclusionary labels for judgments made on the facts of each case-judgments invoking controversial moral and political values-then the much-celebrated development of our sophisticated body of administrative law would seem to be, after all, largely chimerical. Moreover, Halpin's reluctance to attribute similar values and assumptions to both courts and Parliament does reflect a permissible scepticism about the legitimacy of judicial review-a 83 Halpin, op. cit., p. 508. 84 Ibid., p. 510. 109</page><page sequence="24">110 The Cambridge Law Journal [2002] scepticism whose absence from the ultra vires debate, as it is usually conducted, underlines its highly formal character, divorced from the more significant disputes about the nature and scope of public law. The larger the common ground that can be found between the main protagonists, at the level of conceptual analysis, the more obscure the debate's connection with such disputes becomes. It is only by systematic elaboration of the rule of law, revealing the specific connections between general doctrine and particular judicial decisions, that we can hope to meet Halpin's challenge.85 There is an important sense in which Laws and Elliott, notwithstanding their apparent disagreement, actually share a highly controversial view of the nature and function of judicial review. Neither writer expresses any doubts about the legitimacy of judicial review, and the interpretative powers it requires, or about its value as a means of controlling the exercise of administrative discretion: they differ only in their choice of formal location for the necessary constitutional authority. However, the "normativist" style of public law thought, which emphasises the central role of the superior courts in preserving the rule of law, confronts an opposite school of thought that denies both the propriety and value of judicial review, at least as it is presently conducted.86 Halpin's scepticism echoes J.A.G. Griffith's suspicion of the rule of law as a "fantasy invented by Liberals of the old school in the late nineteenth century and patented by the Tories to throw a protective sanctity around certain legal and political institutions and principles which they wish to preserve at any cost".87 Law, having no necessary moral content, was merely an instrument for the attainment of whatever ends emerged from the political struggle; and political decisions should so far as possible be taken by politicians rather than judges. In a vigorous defence of a "pluralist" conception of law, which allows a variety of legal regimes to operate more or less independently within the overarching structure of the state, H.W. Arthurs has also objected to the imposition of common law values on statutory schemes whose purposes may not be readily apparent, or particularly attractive, to judges trained in a contrasting legal or For pertinent discussion, see Paul Craig, "Formal and Substantive Conceptions of the Rule of Law: an Analytical Framework" [1997] P.L. 467; David Dyzenhaus, "Form and Substance in the Rule of Law: A Democratic Justification for Judicial Review?", in Forsyth (ed.), Judicial Review and the Constitution; Allan, Constitutional Justice, esp. chs. 1-3.

Like other prominent writers sceptical of the benefits of judicial review, in its current highly intrusive form, Arthurs defends a much more limited conception of the judicial role: "checking the presumptive validity of administrative decision-making, especially where the special skills of the administrative tribunal or the special significance of context are of minimal importance; and dealing with allegations that the tribunal has acted with bias, bad faith, total irrationality, or in an area lying quite beyond its competence".89 The argument, typically offered in defence of judicial review, that the courts' supervision helps to ensure the consistent application of general principles and standard modes of administrative operation, meets the objection that "this integrative treatment of the system may be precisely contrary to the wishes of those who have constructed it": the legislature may have "wanted a special administrative regime; that is why the task at hand was not given to, or was taken away from, the courts".90 In most cases, Arthurs contends, the special context of administrative decision- making provides strong reasons for judicial deference towards both its procedures and substantive outcomes; and the interdependence of questions of law and issues of policy dictates that the tribunal should be accorded a wide discretion in matters of statutory interpretation. In so far as the various protagonists in the ultra vires debate agree in finding the source of judicial standards of administrative legality in the rule of law, with or without the accompaniment of an underpinning general legislative intent, they are equally vulnerable to Arthurs' challenge to the supremacy of rule of law values. Arthurs objected particularly to Dicey's emphasis on the "ordinary" courts and the "ordinary law", which enabled his interpretation of the rule of law to justify the judicial revision of expressions of the parliamentary will: the judicial function of "interpretation-cum-revision" was the process by which law was made "ordinary", and the rule of law "made to prevail over nonconforming legislation".91 Where the "ordinary" rules of interpretation can be invoked to "prevail over, to revise and to domesticate special legal regimes established by statute", the H.W.

He fears that Parliament's will, in so far as it can be ascertained in any particular context, may prove hostile to the constitutional rights whose foundation is the judicial development of the common law. His defence of the common law basis of judicial review is therefore diametrically opposed to the "pluralist" viewpoint, defended by Arthurs, which regards the values of the common law as a threat to the efficient implementation of administrative schemes, faithful to the wishes of the legislature. Laws's antipathy to the use of Hansard, where that might weaken the judges' ability to enforce common law rights, may be thought to confirm Arthurs' suspicion that "rules against the use of extrinsic aids to interpretation are part of the general impulse to make laws 'ordinary'".93 Arthurs even suggests that courts may be "anxious not to know what the statute really was intended to accomplish so that they can choose from amongst the possible interpretations the one that most closely coincides with 'the spirit of the common law' ..."94 It should be clear, then, that if the ultra vires debate were to have any significant bearing on the question of the legitimacy of judicial review, despite the purely formal nature of the doctrine that constitutes its focus, it must be reinterpreted as a debate about the real nature and purposes of the judicial function. The central role of legislative intent might be defended on grounds that are the mirror image of the emphasis accorded by the opponents of ultra vires to the role of the common law. The objection to locating the foundations of judicial review in the common law could be explained in terms of the danger that judges will be encouraged to displace the statutory purposes, properly ascertained, in favour of their own rather different perceptions of the public interest or the general good. By equating application of the various grounds of review with respect for legislative intention, the ultra vires doctrine serves to underline the abstract and indeterminate nature of the relevant common law rules and principles-rules and principles whose application ought to be highly sensitive to the specific statutory context in which they are invoked or applied. It is rather obvious which side of the debate writers like Arthurs would take, if they thought it worth intervening at all. In a 92 Ibid., p. 20. 93 Ibid., p. 19. 94 Ibid., p. 18.

Constitutional Foundations of Judicial Review 113 pluralist or functionalist theory of public law, statutory discretions are not normally to be governed by overriding common law principles, and statutory interpretation is not, in ordinary circumstances, to be a monopoly of the superior courts: "statutes lead a life of their own, rather than a parasitic and contingent existence within the body of the common law", and "they are to be enforced by judges in the spirit in which they were enacted, rather than in 4the general spirit of common law'".95 Moreover, the inability of the ultra vires doctrine to account for the judicial role in supervising the work of non-statutory bodies, though considered a defect by common law theorists, would not be so regarded by anyone rejecting an integrated "rule of law" approach in favour of legal pluralism. There could hardly be any objection to embracing a variety of bases for judicial review on the part of a writer who celebrates the huge diversity of types and instances of administrative decision-making. The foundations of judicial review should surely be conceived according to the political, legal and social context of the relevant administrative procedure, just as the relevant legal principles should themselves reflect that context. It is important to concede at once, however, that the suggested link between attitudes to the ultra vires debate and the various traditions of public law thought is not a logical or necessarily conceptual one; and complete abstention from the debate, on the ground of its purely formal and conceptual nature, remains a perfectly tenable position for the adherent of any of these traditions. It is possible for a common law theorist to acknowledge the value of legal pluralism and the dangers of excessive judicial interference with administrative decision-making;96 and it is clearly possible for a proponent of the ultra vires doctrine, as Elliott's and Forsyth's work exemplifies, to favour a broadly "normativist" stance in which the court's duty to uphold rule of law values occupies a central place. But it is, of course, precisely these possibilities that demonstrate the failure of the ultra vires debate to establish any convincing connection with the genuine questions of constitutional legitimacy. The consensus that EHiott and Forsyth seek, in their effort to settle the argument over ultra vires, is likely to be achieved, if at all, only by ignoring what is actually a radical disagreement at the heart of public law thought in its substantive, as opposed to purely formal, character. It is also right to acknowledge that the extension of judicial review to the work of certain public but non-statutory bodies, as : Ibid. p. 22.

(1999): see esp. chs. 1 &amp; 13.</page><page sequence="28">114 The Cambridge Law Journal [2002] well as to governmental decision-making under the royal prerogative, certainly weakens the claim of the ultra vires doctrine to be the "central principle" of administrative law. As the focus of attention moves from the formal source of a power to its general nature and susceptibility to legal challenge (or "justiciability"), as the relevant criteria to determine the applicability of judicial review, there is increasing force in the view that "abuse of power" has become the unifying theme or constitutional principle. Moreover, the grounds of attack on ultra vires have not here been merely conceptual, but are motivated by pressing concerns about justice for individuals. It is Sir Stephen Sedley's keen awareness of the citizen's vulnerability to the arbitrary conduct of non-state corporations and other bodies, performing what may well be rightly classified as public functions, that informs his insistence that, "What public law is about, at heart, is the restraint of abuses of power".97 And Dawn Oliver's powerful early contribution to the debate was chiefly concerned with the conditions under which powers that derive from contract or the control of property might be subject to review: what she lamented was, not merely conceptual confusion, but the absence of "a framework of theory about the nature of power, whether public or private, upon which to build the supervisory jurisdictions of the courts".98 In the absence of such a framework of theory, however, the replacement of ultra vires by a rival conception of "abuse of power", applicable to statutory and non-statutory contexts alike, is bound to antagonise those who doubt either the qualifications or the impartiality of the judicial beneficiaries of the extended supervisory powers. Predictably, Griffith is hostile to the idea of such an extended review jurisdiction, based on such a nebulous concept as "abuse of power": the result would be to entrust "the solution of too many problems to the unfettered discretion of the senior judiciary, appointed not elected, and irremovable".99 It is certainly the case that the common law tradition provides very infertile soil for the establishment of any rigid distinction between the public and private spheres, as regards the substance of legal regulation; the requirements of fairness and rationality that inform our administrative law may well be thought equally at home, when suitably interpreted, in the private law sphere.100 Since, however, The Rt.

Constitutional Foundations of Judicial Review 115 judicial intervention must be carefully attuned to the relevant circumstances, and justified accordingly, the concept of abuse of power is far too general and abstract to provide a real foundation for judicial review, capable of meeting challenges to its constitutional credentials. Moreover, the embarrassment that the extension of judicial review causes the ultra vires principle, in its claims to be the central principle of administrative law, is substantially reduced if, disregarding considerations of conceptual neatness, we focus instead on the details of judicial control. The extension of review to the promulgation by central government of non-statutory guidance, in Gillick, was accompanied by reservations whose effect, it may be argued, altered its essential character in that sphere.101 In Lord Bridge's view, it was only against a "specific statutory background" that the question whether an authority had acted unreasonably, in the Wednesbury sense, could "properly be asked and answered".102 No such question could be formulated in the circumstances of the case; and even the jurisdiction to correct an error of law was to be exercised with the "utmost restraint" so as to "avoid either expressing ex cathedra opinions in areas of social and ethical controversy ... or proffering answers to hypothetical questions of law which do not strictly arise for decision".103 In so far as judicial intervention in this context accordingly takes a different form from its operation in the statutory field, there is good reason to distinguish its constitutional basis from the standard case of review.104 A similar argument could clearly be made in relation to the prerogative, at least in so far as the courts are willing to review the exercise of a first-order prerogative power (i.e. not delegated under an Order in Council). Although, in G.C.H.Q.,105 Lord Diplock declined to rule out "irrationality" as a possible ground of judicial review, he nevertheless found it "difficult to envisage in any of the various fields in which the prerogative remains the only source of the relevant decision-making power a decision of a kind that would be open to attack through the judicial process on this ground".106 In the most celebrated expansion of judicial review, to a species of self-regulation lacking formal governmental powers, moreover, the Court of Appeal envisaged a highly unusual jurisdiction closely Gillick v.

While, therefore, it is certainly a form of review resistant to any rationalisation based on legislative intent, it can readily be treated as sui generis. FORMAL DOCTRINAL ANALYSIS AND THE POLITICAL SUBSTANCE OF THE RULE OF LAW Arthurs's antipathy to the exercise by courts of powers of interpretation, invoking general common law values, ought to be shared by any serious advocate of absolute parliamentary sovereignty: as I have argued, it is judicial superintendence of the application of statutes that serves, in practice, to limit the scope of legislative power. Whatever the relationship between Parliament and courts, however, as it affects judicial review of executive agencies, parliamentary sovereignty will always be a question of degree. Arthurs is doubtful whether the appropriate division of authority between courts and tribunals can be safely drawn by leaving the courts in control of values fundamental to the legal order as a whole: the notions of fairness and reasonableness that such values invoke are too elastic to compel any concessions to the administrative context, if a judge is unsympathetic to a tribunal's decision. He prefers a "functionalist" approach that would focus on the respective competences of court and tribunal in relation to the specific questions of law or procedure arising. He recognises, however, that there is no alternative to a balance of powers, reflecting the tension between constitutional principle and particular statutory aim: "In the end, it must be conceded, it is the judges' sensitivity and self-restraint which will determine where the line is drawn between general rules and specific contexts."'09 That line 107 R. v. Panel on Take-overs and Mergers, ex p. Datafin p.l.c. [1987] 1 All E.R. 564. 108 Ibid., p. 578. 109 Arthurs, "Rethinking Administrative Law", above, p. 33. 116 [2002]</page><page sequence="31">C.L.J. Constitutional Foundations of Judicial Review 117 cannot be drawn by legislation, whatever the theoretical dominance of the legislative power. Although, therefore, Arthurs's stance may fit more comfortably with adherence to, rather than rejection of, the ultra vires doctrine, it does nothing to strengthen the commitment to unqualified parliamentary sovereignty that all the protagonists supposedly endorse. The formalism that marks both the ultra vires principle and the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty from which it derives is symptomatic of a deeper deficiency in our public law discourse. The niceties of doctrinal debate often seem only tenuously related to the social and political effects of legal interventions in the administrative process; and the closer judicial review comes to resemble the "constitutional review" welcomed by Jeffrey Jowell, the more problematic the connection between formal legal analysis and the substance of judicial decisions becomes.110 The irony indeed is that the greater the protection that public law affords the citizen from abuses of power, in all their various manifestations, the more its elaborate legal structure is exposed as a largely formal facade. Many of the specific doctrines that lent English public law the sense of being a distinctive legal discipline, akin to the principal fields of private law, have largely disintegrated under the pressure of scrutiny, as both courts and commentators have questioned their rationales in the light of more abstract ideals of justice or fairness. The tension between formal legality and open-ended notions of procedural fairness, as explained by Loughlin, has become a paradigm for the whole terrain of judicial review.111 The rules concerning estoppel and legitimate expectations are a good example. When the doctrine of legitimate expectation was merely a supplement to the rules of natural justice, affording only a form of procedural protection, it was possible to maintain the principle that a public authority could never be inhibited from changing existing policies, according to the needs of the public interest. But it is now conceded that a person may acquire a substantive expectation, so that he may sometimes be deprived of an anticipated benefit only if there is an overriding public interest of sufficient weight; and a judicial balancing of interests has, in effect, been substituted for a rule excluding the possibility of estoppel. An allocation of cases to different categories, in order to explain the legal consequences of various sorts of expectation, was Doctrinal indeterminacy is an important theme in Hutchinson's radical critique of judicial review: see Allan C. Hutchinson, "The Rise and Ruse of Administrative Law and Scholarship" (1985) 48 M.L.R. 293. ' See Loughlin, "Procedural Fairness", above. For the elastic and indeterminate nature of jurisdictional control, as regards "error of law", see Craig, Administrative Law, 4th edn., ch. 15.</page><page sequence="32">The Cambridge Law Journal all too plainly a desperate attempt to rationalise conflicting precedents."2 It was not explained why the court would evaluate the reasons for overriding a person's expectation in some cases but not in others. Although in some cases a public body would be required merely to have regard to an expectation before making a decision that defeated it-a decision subject only to Wednesbury review-in other cases the court could determine whether frustration of an expectation was "so unfair as to amount to an abuse of power", a question on which the court's judgment could override the authority's view. It is hard to see, however, how the reasonableness of a decision to override an expectation, falling within the former category, could be determined without the sort of balancing of interests appropriate to cases in the latter class. What is reasonable, or not unreasonable, necessarily depends on all the circumstances.13 Subsequent recognition that the appropriate degree of judicial control should depend on the context-including the number of persons involved and the possible impact of a decision on wide- ranging issues of general policy-has led inevitably to the conclusion that the suggested categories of expectation are "not hermetically sealed".'14 The facts of the case will "steer the court to a more or less intrusive quality of review", allowing the judges to negotiate a suitable path between the rights of the applicant and the demands of public policy, as perceived by the executive. A similar balancing of interests, akin to the adoption of a proportionality test, has also displaced a more deferential approach in cases involving human or constitutional rights. What was portrayed with some plausibility as an essentially formal test of bare "rationality", invalidating administrative decisions that defied "common sense", has been revealed (or reinterpreted) as highly sensitive to context, allowing judicial intervention to track the scale of the threat perceived to important constitutional values. Accordingly, it is established as a common law principle that the "more substantial the interference with human rights, the more the court will require by way of justification before it is satisfied that the decision is reasonable" in the relevant sense.ll5 Substance has overtaken form, as the latter has been adapted to meet the 112 See R. v.

Constitutional Foundations of Judicial Review demands of political principle and to reflect the significance of political context.116 Nor should we attribute the disparity between decisions of the English courts and those of the European Court of Human Rights to any necessary lack of flexibility in the Wednesbury standard of review. The conclusions of the Divisional Court and Court of Appeal in Smith, for example, revealed a degree of deference to executive judgment that the subsequent European Court decision rejected."7 But there is no good reason to think that the English judges were in some way precluded from deciding the case in accordance with its merits, their freedom diminished by the constraints of rigid legal formulae. Their decision, however expressed, reflected their judgments of the legitimate weight to be accorded to governmental assessments of the needs of military efficiency and national security. The English courts struck the balance between the applicants' rights and the wider public interest at a different point from that favoured by the European Court."8 It is only by offering detailed argument on the merits of particular claims, forgoing resort to rigid doctrinal classifications or conclusionary labels, that we can offer genuine justification or criticism of judicial decisions. Although the rule of law provides the ultimate foundation for judicial review, it cannot be equated with any purely formal scheme of control. It is fundamentally an ideal of constitutional justice, invoking specific conceptions of personal autonomy and legal equality, whose full meaning and systematic enforcement public law exists to discover and secure.19 Of course, Halpin is right to observe that the content of the rule of law may be contested, drawing as it inevitably does on specific interpretations of justice and individual rights. He argues, for example, that Sir John Laws's "four building blocks of principle"- arguments from logic, consequences, precedent, and ideals-merely reveal "that principle serves a role subservient to whichever body of doctrine, ideological or otherwise, is selected".'20 Laws, however, has frankly acknowledged that the meaning of the rule of law must ultimately be found in certain ideals of freedom and justice, denying that any conception of law can be truly value-free.l21 16 The discretionary nature of judicial review in New Zealand, highly sensitive to context, is a major theme in Philip Joseph's essay, "The Demise of Utra Vires-Judicial Review in the New Zealand Courts" [2001] P.L. 354 (esp. pp. 371-375). 17 See Smith and Grady v.

These rights are founded on constitutional values that inform both common law and the judicial interpretation of statute, facilitating the consistent application of an integrated body of law, expressing a coherent conception of justice. In this context, too, however, there are fundamental questions of legitimacy concerning the nature and scope of judicial review; and these are very poorly understood or answered in the formal terms of orthodox constitutional theory. The scheme of the Human Rights Act is widely praised for its ingenuity in enhancing the judicial protection of rights without undermining parliamentary sovereignty. Although statutes must be interpreted in accordance with the Convention rights, in so far as it is "possible" to do so, Parliament retains the last word: a judicial declaration of incompatibility, expressing the court's inability to construe a provision so as to avoid the infringement of a person's human rights, does not affect the statute's validity. For all practical purposes, however, what is crucial is the scope of the judges' freedom to interpret or "adapt" the statutory language: the greater their commitment to the practical defence of these rights, the more infrequent their resort to declarations of incompatibility is likely to be (and hence the fewer the opportunities for Parliament to assert its right to resist attempts to amend offending legislation). What is "possible" as a reading of the statutory text is not purely a matter of language, unaffected by considerations of political morality: it will depend, in practice, on the extent of the courts' reluctance to attribute to Parliament (or government) an intention to infringe the Convention rights. Similar questions of legitimacy arise, therefore, as in the case of the judicial enforcement of common law rights. The notion that they are answered merely by observing that the judges' task has been conferred by statute, enacted by a representative legislature, confuses form with substance. Whether or not, in any particular case, the judicial enforcement of rights has been sanctioned by Parliament depends on the correct interpretation of the Act-a matter of constitutional judgment rather than speculation as to legislators' expectations-and the consistency of the courts' practice with that interpretation. It follows that, though the doctrine of ultra vires provides a convenient rationalisation of judicial activity in defence of Convention rights, it contributes little to our grasp of the major questions of legitimacy. Elliott has explained that, in the sphere of 120 [2002]</page><page sequence="35">C.L.J. Constitutional Foundations of Judicial Review administrative law, these rights must be viewed as "interpretative constructs", consistently with his approach to the ordinary common law grounds of review.122 Accordingly, such rights do not curtail decision-making powers conferred by Parliament but, on the contrary, should be understood merely to assist in defining the scope of such powers, correctly interpreted: they "shape the internal contours of enabling provisions, thereby ensuring that the courts, in effecting judicial review on rights-based grounds, enforce the limits of discretionary powers which enabling legislation ... sets, rather than cutting down the scope of such powers ...".123 This analysis shows why the Human Rights Act does not repeal earlier legislation that infringes human rights, and also why such rights are not themselves destroyed by subsequent enactments that confer widely- framed discretionary powers on the executive. There is a striking analogy with the common law grounds of review, which must operate subject to inconsistent legislation: the Human Rights Act cannot curtail the powers expressly granted by later statutes. These conclusions are "logical functions of the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty, according to which the contemporary will of Parliament is the ultimate source of law in the constitution, prevailing over the common law and earlier legislation alike".'24 Elliott's analysis of the conceptual basis of the Human Rights Act neatly captures the peculiar status of the Convention rights- generally applicable, subject to inconsistent legislative provision, but not fully incorporated into domestic law. It has the additional merit of ensuring that the reasoning in Anisminic would be available to insulate the judicial protection of rights from the operation of a statutory ouster clause. It also preserves the possibility of collateral challenge to administrative action that violates a Convention right, for such action (unless authorised or made necessary by incompatible legislation) would be plainly void-beyond the powers conferred on the public agency.125 Moreover, vindication of the ultra vires doctrine, based on legislative intent, in this context undoubtedly strengthens its appeal in the general sphere of judicial review of the activities of statutory agencies: there is an appealing symmetry here that Elliott is fully entitled to emphasise. But it follows that similar objections also apply: a purely formal reconciliation of conflicting considerations or principles, however elegantly presented, cannot offer any answer to the deeper questions of legitimacy that disturb our constitutional thinking. 122 Elliott, "Fundamental Rights as Interpretative Constructs: The Constitutional Logic of the Human Rights Act 1998", in Forsyth (ed.), Judicial Review and the Constitution. 123 Ibid., pp. 277-278. 124 Ibid., p. 277. 125 Ibid., pp. 281-287. 121</page><page sequence="36">The Cambridge Law Journal David Feldman observes that the values that must now be regarded as informing the grounds of jurisdictional error of law may include "dignity, autonomy, pluralist democracy, tolerance, open-mindedness, equality, and respect for the rule of law, which have variously been regarded by the European Court and Commission of Human Rights as underpinning all or some of the Convention rights".126 Since, however, such very general values are clearly susceptible of conflicting interpretations, it is only in the most abstract sense that we can agree that the resulting style of judicial review "will be justifiable, in line with classical ultra vires doctrine, by reference to the will of Parliament".'27 It is certainly true that Parliament has approved the text of the applicable rights "in the knowledge that the full meaning of the rights would become clear only from judicial decisions", subsequently given. But if in this context there is "no need to trouble ourselves about whether or not the doctrine of ultra vires is a fiction or a fig-leaf", as Feldman suggests, it is only because such a purely formal doctrine is incapable of providing any genuine foundation for specific judicial decisions. While the doctrine of ultra vires is plainly applicable, as an explanation of the formal source of the judicial role, its specific justificatory power is diminished by its generality and scope: the wider the discretion conferred, the weaker the authority derived by doubtful decisions from the mere fact of the delegation of power. As Feldman observes, however, the 1998 Act has introduced general deontological standards of immense practical significance for the content of public law: "the vires of all public authorities will now be systematically structured for most purposes by reference to criteria which will require courts and tribunals to make sensitive moral, social and political judgments about the substantive goodness of the outcome of official decisions, actions and rules".'28 In these circumstances, the important questions of legitimacy relate, not to the source of the judicial power, but to its manner of exercise-precisely the position at common law in relation to the development and application of common law rights and general principles. Griffith's objections to the extension of judicial review were not confined to the imposition of common law standards of legality: he opposed incorporation of the European Convention on the ground that it would leave yet more political judgments to 126 David Feldman, "Convention Rights and Substantive Ultra Vires", in Forsyth (ed.), Judicial Review and the Constitution, p. 262. 127 Ibid., p. 263. 128 Ibid., p. 258. 122 [2002]</page><page sequence="37">C.L.J. Constitutional Foundations of Judicial Review lawyers, as they sought to interpret "woolly principles and even woollier exceptions".129 As Feldman rightly remarks, the Human Rights Act must be placed in its wider constitutional context. Where, for example, a "public authority has interfered with a right, and tries to justify the interference, the weight to be attached to proposed justifications will depend on the type of instrument, act or decision which is impugned and the type of body which is challenged".130 The permitted justifications for infringements of rights may also be interpreted differently in the several constituent parts of the United Kingdom, reflecting the nature of their various legislative and executive organs. If there is truly "a danger that applying the doctrine of ultra vires without regard to constitutional context will produce results which derail good, as well as bad, government", as Feldman warns, it can scarcely be maintained in any realistic sense that "Parliament's words, in the form of generalised right-based criteria, applicable to all public authorities, for assessing the limitations of their powers, will provide all the legitimacy which is needed".131 CONCLUSION Recent debate about the foundations of judicial review has obscured the most important questions about the nature and legitimacy of the judges' constitutional role. It has substituted an ultimately pointless conceptual dispute for argument about the identification, meaning and proper application of relevant legal principles. When we try to place the conceptual debate within a wider theoretical context, noting more deeply rooted division between conflicting attitudes to the nature and limits of judicial review, its futility is all too plainly apparent. In seeking tidy doctrinal solutions to questions of constitutional legitimacy and political substance-whether in terms of legislative intent or common law wisdom-debate over the merits of the ultra vires doctrine has ended, inevitably, in stalemate. Since the meaning, or correct interpretation, of such basic doctrines of parliamentary sovereignty and the rule of law has been largely ignored, in favour of purely conceptual argument and rationalisation, the debate has become ever more abstruse and, accordingly, less intelligible as a contribution to constitutional theory. 129 Griffith, "The Political Constitution" (1979) 42 M.L.R. 1, at p. 14. 130 Feldman, op. cit., p. 267. 131 Ibid., pp. 266-268. 123</page><page sequence="38">The Cambridge Law Journal Sir John Laws is right to seek a new theory of judicial review founded on a substantive conception of the rule of law;'32 but his consequent demand for the abandonment of ultra vires makes sense only if accompanied by frank recognition of existing constraints on legislative power. A common law theory of judicial review, applicable to statutory power, must offer, primarily, an account of the proper interpretation of statutes-a mode of interpretation informed by constitutional precepts and principles that transcend, and therefore qualify, more transient or contentious legislative purposes. Common law theorists who adhere to notions of unqualified parliamentary sovereignty, whenever their opponents try to paint them as revolutionaries, are thereby trapped in a fruitless conceptual war-dance from which they cannot hope to emerge as victors in any genuine constitutional battle. Conceptual analysis offers no refuge from constitutional argument; and the latter necessarily engages legal and political theory. In that respect, the ultra vires debate stands as a striking symbol of a wider malaise in our public law: we argue over verbal formulae and doctrinal categories to shield us from issues of substance that might prove more complex or controversial.'33 In the face of sceptical challenges to the utility or legitimacy of judicial review, however, a purely analytical approach is largely useless: it inevitably begs too many of the questions that critics of the rule of law, whether as political ideal or legal doctrine, want to raise. David Dyzenhaus has shrewdly questioned the value (in the present context) of some of the distinctions or dichotomies on which the defence of ultra vires seemed to rest-between law and politics, for example, or between form and substance, statute and common law, court and legislature. And he has rightly argued that neither an exclusive focus on statutory authorisation nor an exclusive focus on the common law would take us very far in finding "a basis in substantive legal values", necessary for an appropriate conception-even a primarily procedural conception- of the rule of law.134 For the conceptual distinctions and dichotomies that permeate both doctrinal argument and judicial rhetoric are sometimes false trails, whether invoked by adherents or opponents of ultra vires. Legal doctrine and constitutional theory 132 Laws, "Illegality", above, at pp. 4.30-4.35. See also Laws, "The Constitution: Morals and Rights" [1996] P.L. 622. 133 The complexities of the dubious distinction between "illegality" and "irrationality", which mirror those of the ultra vires debate over legislative intention, provide a good example: see Laws, "Wednesbury", in Forsyth and Hare (eds.), The Golden Metwand and the Crooked Cord, pp. 193-194. 134 Dyzenhaus, "Reuniting the Brain", above, at pp. 106-108.

Constitutional Foundations of Judicial Review should reflect the interdependence of the main institutions of government, even if they must also supply the normative foundation for judicial review that a merely descriptive account, emphasising political struggle, necessarily lacks. Dyzenhaus's rebuke to the ultra vires theorists is therefore as apt when directed at their opponents. Common law principle and legislative purpose have to be combined, so that the work of courts, Parliament, and public officials can be conceived, at the most abstract level, as "instantiating in different ways a common order of fundamental values".135 Avowels of loyalty to unqualified parliamentary sovereignty are as fully open to the charge of empty formalism as the doctrine of ultra vires, serving only to conceal the legal and political substance of judicial review. Both doctrines may provide a convenient conceptual tool to exhibit the "constitutional logic" of administrative law,136 if only in cases concerned with the exercise of statutory power. But neither offers enlightenment as an account of the legitimacy of judicial intervention in any particular instance; and each doctrine is actually misleading if intended to signify unqualified judicial subservience to any and every legislative purpose, however doubtful its constitutional propriety. If the ultra vires doctrine is empty because the relevant legislative intent is supplied by judicial construction, reflecting common law principle, so is the doctrine of absolute sovereignty, whose application is equally dependent on legal analysis, sensitive to claims of constitutional right and reasonable expectation. The repudiation of ultra vires-if it is to have any serious claim on our attention- involves not only the sacrifice of the conceptual clarity it arguably confers, at least within a limited compass of administrative action, but an admission of the fundamental status of the rule of law. It is in the detailed elaboration of that abstract ideal, and its connection to our constitutional practice, that legal theory can best contribute to our knowledge of administrative law. 35 Ibid., p. 107. 136 Elliott, "Legislative Intention Versus Judicial Creativity?", above, p. 366. 125</page></plain_text>
