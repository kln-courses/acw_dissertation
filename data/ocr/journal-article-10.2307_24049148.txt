In Muscarella forthcoming, I introduce an artifact (missed by me in 20031 that must play a funda mental role in dating the DL to the years around (after?) 700 b.c. These are bronze socketed ar rows recovered in the clay overlying the DL— therefore patently dating to the very incipience of the MP period's construction (there may be one such arrow recovered from the DL itself). I record that not a single example of the many thousands recovered all over the Near East can be archaeologically dated before the 7th century b.c. (theoretically at the earliest, the late 8th century b.c.). From their sealed deposition it fol lows that no New Chronologist archaeologist can claim the arrows were intrusive from a later time: they are a classic lietfossil artifact: and their presence demonstrates the reality of the old chronology, and concomitantly the full worth lessness of the New Chronology (whether 830 or 770 b.c.). (Unless, of course, Voigt's reconstruc tion of the MP as having been constructed quite soon after the DL is incorrect, that as R. Young posited years ago, there was a 100-year abandon ment of the site after the DL.) I submit that it is historically feasible and ar chaeologically viable to go a step further: albeit many cultures and polities employed these arrow heads over a very long time, given their jux taposition at Gordion (the capital of Phrygia, named by Strabo as having been attacked by the Cimmerians), and coupled with a terminal destruction there, allows archaeologist to sug gest the possibility that they could have been shot by Cimmerians—who destroyed Gordion. Further, I argue that Berndt-Erzöz's superbly re searched and articulated article in Historia 2008 (see n. 1) claiming that the Cimmerian invasion at Gordion did/could not have occurred during the reign of Midas I, dated by her ca. 723-ca. 677 b.c., but at the time of Midas III, ca. 645-640 b.c. [passim, pp. 15, 16, 21, 23-29), cannot be sus tained. On purely archaeological grounds, the arrows could have been shot anytime in the 7th century b.c. (or later). One of her arguments, how ever, is that 677 b.c. is too early for the Cimme rians to have been in the Gordion area, a position I suggest is argued too forcibly (on negative evi dence) and not defensible, by her or others. She presents another argument on this issue as sig nificant, that Midas I was an ally of the Cim merians (ibid., pp. 16, 23, 24, 28), and therefore the latter would not harm their allies. For this claim there is absolutely no evidence (on this see Muscarella 2003, 247-48 and n. 95), no such alliance has been demonstrated (the alleged "evi dence" is a restoration in a broken text). Based on this modern textual construction DeVries in 1998 (p. 7) also rejected the Cimmerians as the DL culprits, and, looking elsewhere, found them: it was Sargon II's Assyrian army, in the year 710 b.c. And given Berndt-Erzöz's and DeVries' acceptance of the New Chronology, the Cim merian destruction they both proclaim obviously occurred in the MP period, wherein the excava tors found no traces of a destruction. The only destruction at Gordion is that of the DL. Berndt-Erzöz' proposed 723 b.c. date as the incipient year for Midas I is at least ten years after the (presently reported) dendrochronologi cal date of the MM construction—a major royal burial (and the largest at Gordion). Who then was buried in MM: for in her chronology the body could not have been Midas I? Was he pre ceded by a King Gordios, who a decade before his son's reign buried his father, a previous Midas (Midas O)? I am not being pedantic here, merely revealing the soft spots in her chronology pro posals. I suggest that another possibility should be considered, that the incipient date for Midas' reign be raised to ca. 740 b.c. +4/-7 b.c. (or ca. 733 b.c. +/-), assuming the dendrochronological dating of MM holds up.
