Pp. viii + 199. Paper $6. In this dissertation, written at Harvard under the direction of John Strugnell, Tobin develops and models a methodology for identifying exegetical traditions in Philo's work and relating them to the history of philosophy. T.'s study is a welcome addition to the writing of a number of scholars over the past decade who have concerned themselves with the question of sources in Philo (as exemplified, for instance, in the work of the Philo Project at Claremont). Philo's exposition of the creation of man (especially in De opificio mundi , Legům allegoriae /, and Quaestiones in Genesím I) is particularly rich in the variety of interpretations it presents and thus offers a promising body of material in which a search for sources may be carried out. T. seeks to distinguish various exegetical traditions by noting points of conflict. He then relates these traditions genetically by discerning patterns of dependence and development. Finally, he seeks to determine which interpretations are Philo's personal contribution by separating them from identifiably inherited traditions. For this he uses two criteria of exclusion: those interpretations that Philo identifies as not his own plus any interpretations that T. is able to show are logically prior to these; and those interpretations which "clash with a position that spans the Philonic corpus and is therefore Philo's own position" (p. 8). In accord with this procedure, T. first identifies certain interpretations concerned to combat anthropomorphism (particularly in regard to Gen 1:26-27; 2:7). He then divides the remaining majority of interpretations between those traditions that see a single creation and those that expound a double one: Gen 1:27 as the creation of the heavenly man, Gen 2:27 as that of the earthly. He relates all these types of interpreta- tion to developments in Middle Platonism of the 1st century b.c. (Antiochus of Ascalon, Eudorus of Alexandria, and Arius Didymus, as well as the author of the Timaeus Locrus), and to a much lesser extent to Platonically influenced Stoicism. What then is Philo's own contribution? T. identifies two shifts in interpretation as Philo's: his introduction of the allegory of the soul, by which the earthly man of the double creation becomes the earthly mind that strives toward the heavenly. This theme, of course, is basic to Philo's overall understanding of the Pentateuch (Burton L. Mack, using a quite different methodology, has likewise recognized it as the latest stratum in Philo's exegesis ["Weisheit und Allegorie bei Philo von Alexandrien," SP 5 (1978) 80-82]). The second shift is Philo's recognition of different levels of interpre- tation, literal and allegorical, which makes it possible for him to integrate into his master allegory the wide variety of interpretation which he draws from his traditions.</page><page sequence="2">176 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY | 47, 1985 The significance of T.'s contribution can be better appreciated when compared with the recent work of two other scholars. On the one hand, T.'s study may be seen as complementary to those of Mack, who, working across the Philonic corpus, has developed a detailed form-critical methodology for the analysis of sources and has applied it to a specific treatise (De congressu eruditionis) as a unit of Philo's oeuvre ("Exegetical Traditions in Alexandrian Judaism," SP 3 [1974-75] 71-1 12, and above). T., by contrast, has focused on a theme rather than a treatise and has not used form criticism; he has, however, sought to go further than Mack by attempting to establish the historical affinities of the exegetical traditions he identifies. On the other hand, D. T. Runia, Philo of Alexandria and the Timaeus of Plato (2 vols.; Amsterdam: VU Boekhandel, 1983) stands in sharp opposition to T. On the basis of an exhaustive study of Philo's use of the Timaeus , Runia considers that he integrated and transformed traditional materials to such a degree that they can no longer be identified in terms of specific Alexandrian sources. While recognizing a "solidly established body of Platonist doctrine" as available to Philo, he considers a tie between Philo and Eudorus and his circle to be at best "an educated guess" (p. 41 1). On these premises, a study such as T.'s would be fruitless. This sharp division of opinion reminds us how much a scholar's own inclination to conservatism or daring may lie behind the evaluation of such fragile evidence as we deal with in a search for Philo's sources. In this reviewer's opinion T.'s work is a step forward. He is to be commended for a methodology that identifies exegetical tradi- tions. He also has made a probable case for their origins in the philosophical move- ments of the first century b.c., though at this point certainty can justly be tempered by the (too conservative) caveats of Runia. T.'s study opens the way for further work to benefit from both his approach and that of Mack. Earle Hilgert, McCormick Theological Seminar Chicago, IL 60637</page></plain_text>
