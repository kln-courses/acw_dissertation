<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE MEKILTA AND ITS TEXT Louis FINKELSTEIN The appearance of a new edition of a tannaitic work is certainly an event of foremost importance in the world of Jewish learning.* Every student who has had to struggle with the confused texts provided by our printers knows how tentative and indefinite all theories concerning the beginnings of rabbinic Judaism must be, as long as they are based on records which future research may show to have originated with no better authority than a late copyist. It is safe to say that in no other major field of scholarship are students compelled to use such wretched texts as those on which the Talmudic student must still rely. Aside from Marx's edition of Seder Olam Rabbah, Malter's edition of Ta'anit, Higger's edition of the extra-canonical trac- tates, Lichtenstein's edition of Megillat Ta'anit, and Theodor's great edition of Bereshit Rabbah, there is not one Talmudic work which has been properly prepared for the research worker. We are still awaiting critical editions not only of the great Rabbinic works, the Mishna, the Tosefta, and the Talmud, but even of the smaller Tannaitic Midrashim. It is therefore with much joy that the student finds before him two editions of the Mekilta, in both of which practically all the available Mss. and editions, were utilized. The first edition, that of Horovitz (completed after his death by Rabin) appeared in *This paper was read at the meeting of the Fellows of the American Academy for Jewish Research, held on March 12, 1934. I am grateful for the assistance which I received from Professor Alexander Marx in the preparation of this study, in which I have generally followed the methodology of Jewish text- editing which he has developed. I am also grateful to all who took part in the discussion following the paper.

On the other hand its text is, as we shall soon see, definitely superior to Horovitz's, and it has also utilized the Genizah fragments and one or two other fragmentary sources which were not available for Horovitz. It is to be hoped that the complete apparatus, containing full details of the variants, collected by Lauterbach with such care and diligence will soon be made available to Jewish scholars, so that they may profit by it in their use of this interesting Talmudic work. But already, Lauterbach has placed the learned world in his debt by providing this beautiful edition of this work, with a fine, lucid translation, and an excellent introduction which illumine many difficult points. He has frequently been able to resolve knotty texts, which had defied centuries of patient exegesis. It is the excellence of both Horovitz's and Lauterbach's editions which makes it incumbent on the critic to point out the difficulties under which they labored, and the manner in which future editors may escape some of the pitfalls into which they were ensnared. I. A careful study of these editions, as well as the problems which I met in preparing an edition of the Sifre on Deuteronomy, have convinced me of the need of establishing a consensus with regard to the methodology of editing rabbinic works. The basis of such a methodology must, of course, necessarily be an under- standing of the purposes to be achieved by the editor. These seem to me to be twofold: 1. To present to the student all the available information about the text, including the variant readings from manu- scripts, editions, and citations, so far as they are available. 2. To guide the student in his approach to the text. For after all, the editor will have spent more time on the work than any student can give it, and he knows it better than any other person. The student is therefore entitled to have not only the benefit of the editor's observations, but also of his theories and conjectures. The editor may prefer to escape this responsibility which leaves him open to criticism</page><page sequence="4">6 FINKELSTEIN [4] of all whose opinions differ from his, but it is as essential a part of his work as the collation of the variants. This is particularly true with regard to rabbinic works where the judgment with regard to the correct text frequently involves abstruse discussion of legalistic arguments. The editor, having worked the matter out in his own mind, should try to save the student the trouble of having to do it all over again.4 4 The following are texts of the Mekilta considered in this article. I have used Horovitz's sigla to indicate them because of their convenience, and to make this article uniform with that on the Sifre (Proceedings, 1931-2, lff.) where I necessarily adopted Horovitz's sigla. For the texts which Horovitz did not use, I have adopted Lauterbach's sigla. Ms. Oxford 151 (n. 2) ............................................... E d.

Unfortunately the photographs arrived too late to be fully examined before this volume was sent to press. I have only been able to indicate the readings of the text to those passages which occur in it, and to reach some tentative conclusions about its origin and its relation to the other texts. The Ms. is written in square characters, and this makes it difficult to determine the exact century and country of its origin. But from the cursory examination I have been able to give it, I believe that it is of Spanish origin, probably about the thirteenth or fourteenth centuries. But its readings</page><page sequence="5">[5] THE MEKILTA AND ITS TEXT 7 (1A) Thus, e. g. on page 271 line 13 of Horovitz's edition we read the following baraita: nr1 iW wh ich is cited, does nt b ear n the question at all. n :'KN I I3TD 3In3n' l :D3 iD IN MUN .a-IMD lIn3D 3y33 IVDI lty'R Obviously, as Horovitz and others have nn oticed,n nthe text should -any nzy N2, ?

The verse l3pn unn noiK -T3y which is cited, does not bear on the question at all. Obviously, as Horovitz and others have noticed, the text should read moni i-3ny, as in the parallel passage on page 272, line 4: ,tWv nhW nw P]^ in % i9D, rz3 z' D i n D 1 i i 3 y '"n. Even more significantly, the phrase n;iym nR K 1q ' l-typl ipTi A :r i n o 'i3'i i13ny i 5y' ,nn;y 'iny ~b i, n mvlpi is meaningless, as it stands. Yet all the texts agree, substantially, in accepting this form of the baraita. The only one which has a different reading is Midrash Hakamim (CO), which gives us an obvious emendation, reading as it does: m n n li 1n 1D 1 n D i 1 - = 13 l3 '3 t3y=3D 9K3 -n-in n3 i mn3n 03Y33 19ni n: n rn N I y 13 - 1pn n3~-m rnrin. But this emended text is too far from that pre- served in the others to be the original. It seems to me obvious that the original text of the baraita was as follows: JR ;1DK rlnOptv ;1DR nm i73y K nim r lnt - W3 ; trpn I n D I I 113 y p^n U3m noi ;3^ wz Imp JI' 8:y 13^ 1myto 1nty ty Kr -3y InopW? -73y llb nDb&lt;R muptV 'D"YNV riny-p3 ;DK mw n ;1DK r1mR T K m K C my 19mW The point of the baraita is that the Hebrew slave cannot be sold as a minor, and the Hebrew slave girl cannot be sold in her maturity. Since the Scriptures speak of the male and female slaves together, it must speak of the type which can be held in generally agree with those of the Oxford, Munich, and Casanata Mss., (which I take to be an Italian group), as can be seen from examples 4F, 4G, 4H, 4I, 4J, 4U, 5B, 51, 5J, 5K, 6F, 6I, 6J, 6K, below. This, however, is not decisive regarding the country of writing, since we find an example of this group of texts in Spain in citations of Pugio Fidei (see examples 4R-4W).</page><page sequence="6">8 FINKELSTEIN [6] bondage both before and after puberty, namely the heathen slaves. A consideration of this emended text makes it certain that it should have been introduced into the Mekilta, instead of retain- ing the corrupt readings of the copyists. Usually, however, the change required is less radical, involving nothing more than the correction or the replacement of a single letter. One of such cryptic passages in our texts of the Mekilta is that on page 26, line 19 of ed. Horovitz (corresponding to I. 61, line 11, of ed. Lauterbach). It reads as follows: (1B) I1 311' n lfr 1R'r 1H t IDm nnl ,l1'Tnn =1 al, y .'m,, nymw 1 D D K 2 1 X I a'Vn2^1Y l nnn or 7y ' ,D'"2' 1 Tflf 011' -y 7"n flrtn .IZ3nn lwn o ny3K inn o 8 i wy L Lauterbach accepts the text n,y' 'lloD t, xn and vainly tries to give it some meaning. Horovitz recognizes in a note (though he does not improve his main text) that the correct reading of the number is not Dnvy' as most texts have, but nmrw1 o,nvy as Midrash Hakamim has it. He then makes the excellent sug- gestion that b'mtn and 'pDD are variant readings which have been united into the basic text of the Mekilta. This gives him one clear version: T.ri Dmn'y or w'n1, which means, "Since the Scriptures say, 'Until the twenty-first day,' I might suppose that this excludes the twenty-first day itself" on the principle of :a -Ty p i1 iy. But he is less successful in explaining the variant jllD. This word, however, is easily explained if we recall that it occurs elsewhere as an error for oDDI (see Sifre Deut. 286, ed. Friedmann 125a, line 15 ;5 and Mishna Makkot 3.10, where the ordinary texts read :m, =n6 'lDn l=: while the Munich Ms. has correctly Dm,31n DmOn 1lnw). The word DDiD means "arith- metically next below," "running up to." The obscure phrase in the Mekilta therefore read originally: D,nyl -irnn or n1y , nlM1 ,n,y D D i D. This was explained first by the addition of s See Proceedings of the American Academy for Jewish Research, 1931-2, p. 15. For the correct reading of Mishna Makkot, see Diqduqe Soferim, ad loc., and the notes of R. Isaiah Berlin on the margin of the Wilna ed. of the Talmud. He cites in support of the reading =1D, Rashi, R. Moses of Coucy, and R. Nissim. It is strange, however, that both the Mishna text in the Jerushalmi, and ed. Loewe, read lpvo.</page><page sequence="7">[7] THE MEKILTA AND ITS TEXT 9 the explanatory variant m'KI before Mn1I; and finally nDOD became riD. But more frequently, it is not necessary to resort to conjecture to establish the correct text. It can be obtained by comparing the various readings with one another. Horovitz does this only rarely, generally preferring the reading of the printed editions to all others. Lauterbach accepts the reading of the Mss. when they agree; when they disagree, he takes the reading which agrees with the printed editions. But in following this rule he commits two grave errors: 1. He says (Introduction p. xxxvi) that "where the variant readings do not affect the real sense of the passage, the editor deemed it advisable to retain in most instances the reading of the editions in preference to that of the Mss." But this method takes no account of the student's right to a precise text even when "the real sense of the passage" is unaffected. The editor presumes too much when he takes it for granted that what seems to him a slight error is really inconsequential. After all, if the student tries to compare a baraita in the Mekilta with a parallel passage elsewhere he is entitled to have not only an approximate text before him, but one as nearly accurate as possible. This is all the more important in an edition like Lauterbach's which supplies only select variants, and omits those which appear to the editor of slight importance. 2. Further, Lauterbach does not take into sufficient con- sideration the readings of the Midrash Hakamim.6 He holds that since the work is a compilation, its authority is secondary. This is indeed partially true. Yet it must be remembered that the Midrash Hakamim generally transcribes the text accurately, and with precision. I have been able to prove this for the Sifre on Deuteronomy, because a fortunate discovery by Prof. Weill brought to light a Ms. of the Sifre whose readings belong to the same class as those of the Midrash Hakamim. Both for the Sifre and the Mekilta the readings of the text have a special value, however, because it belongs to a different group of texts 6 For a description of this text, see Proceedings ibid. p. 16.</page><page sequence="8">10 FINKELSTEIN [8] than any other available. To neglect its testimony to the correct reading of the Mekilta is to throw away a most useful instrument. Both Horovitz and Lauterbach use other sources even less willingly. Thus on page 229, line 14 of the Horovitz ed. cor- responding to Vol II, page 253 of Lauterbach, we read: (1C) , 1' .X=nD'm' 1" 5Y l'I,' 1nIp '7D D-ann= WTp, .'1 W - p j, .n: w n n n a n n n V I n,n 'nn n5,, nWrnp r1, nmv"p N,s The copyists to whom we owe this reading apparently did not realize that ,wrnp here does not mean holiness, which might inhere in the Sabbath Day more probably than in the Sabbath Eve, but the Kiddush, which is more natural at the Sabbath Eve. In fact the preceding baraita prescribes it for the Sabbath Eve and it is upon that statement that our baraita depends. Hence the baraita should read: pl: m' rwnp ,'h7', n p S ,t 1'S p. This text is actually found not only in the Sefer Vehizhir, but also in a citation of the baraita in Menorat Ha-Maor (chap. 155), and in Midrash Tannaim to Deuteronomy (p. 21). A similar text is found in Midrash Hakamim. Yet both Lauterbach and Horovitz preserve the erroneous reading.7 On page 144, line 19 (Lauterbach, II, page 56, line 100) we read the following baraita: (1D) ,n i3bn&amp; ,.n 1 e 3 3 1 n 1 inrl 033n Dy MVyi m^ny IMw nlMM=a D'03 4':W MnM i InRwn Nhw nih nrvyw n, o on . The text of the editio princeps which Horovitz adopts is sufficiently confused, but Lauterbach fol- lowing his usual rule to adopt the reading of the Mss. when they agree, in substance, gives the following impossible text: nm33= DMD3 "TliW nmR n4rin mIW rin lw3t4 ,mn I t 9 D 13 m I b&lt; .n1mvr oy 4nivy tiw in noi9m NmMn3 rmn D"4il Dy nlyw -niy "3KW 7 Cf. Pesahim 106a, where the Talmud similarly emends its text of the baraita which agreed with that of the ordinary Mekilta texts. When this paper was read at the meeting of the Academy, Professor Louis Ginzberg suggested that in view of the agreement of the Talmudic text of the baraita with that of ed. pr. the reading be retained, essentially, and the textual dif- ficulties met by the transposition of the phrases. He would therefore read: ]ND nzwnI nR oncs1 in l"n 01 r Wlnp r1'? Ni1)np Kib '9 1'S .. .D:In ,'irvj inD=::n l"n by l,'np i-Iu . But the support of the Midrash Ha-Gadol for Deuteronomy, the Sefer Vehizhir, and the Menorat Ha-Maor for my emenda- tion, seems to me decisive in the matter. It is to be noted however, that the reading of ed. pr. is supported by LD 1 D R.</page><page sequence="9">[9] THE MEKILTA AND ITS TEXT 11 It is clear that the text of the Mss. is older than that of the editions. But it is itself composite of two parallel readings. The correct reading is to be found in Midrash Hakamim, the text of which is as follows: my mnrvy nny ; : n I 5 D: 3 - K nlnn my vnwy Nhw nltlDM 0n1^;n. On page 139, line 18 of ed. Horovitz, corresponding to Vol. II, page 55, line 22, of ed. Lauterbach, we read: y,ni nxpD iniw r,D twr1 'n nrn 1n-'T t 4 rn 1nDK I-nD Dyi u nn rw. The strange word innirm has the following variants: 0D mrnn nM nrnnmn 1 '? t.3 ,nnn, Tn. The correct reading, however, as indicated by Hoffmann, is that found in the Mekilta of R. Simeon: winm Un. The same expression is found in Midrash Tannaim 1, 1 (page 2, line 24) and in corrupted form in the corresponding passage of the Sifre (? 1).8 But Horovitz as usual retains the text of ed. pr., and Lauterbach, in spite of Hoffmann's note, adopts the reading of Ms. [. No less serious than the failure of the editors to depart from the older text when it is patently erroneous, is their effort to guess at the correct text without authority in the Mss. or other sources. Thus ed. Lauterbach, Vol. II, page 78, line 24, reads: (1F) -n7I mo nt z t rnznrn I -iTnn nr ,1Ti6 ipDn ,jnroi lrz 1 D D ~D'DW ',n 1W ;"p D','n C ' n T",D1 no O HD: *0'n1Y jnzv1 1lzz 19 bInt n: lnl:= n3 -iiml It is possible that this interpretation is based on the reading Il?n for 1nDD; though this is by no means certain, as the interpreta- tion would derive naturally from a literal translation of the verse. If Jerusalem or Palestine is described as "a place for God to dwell in," then it must be that the throne below corresponds to the Heavenly throne above. At any rate the author of the Pesiqta Zutreta added at the beginning of the baraita the words: iWnn IinDD in,ir. These are not found in any other text; yet Lauterbach inserts at the beginning of the baraita, the words ]n.w6 linD and punctuates them, as though there was some Ms. authority for so doing. To make matters worse, he indicates in the variants only that the words are missing in the editions, 8 It is also found in Midrash Tannaim 32.25 (P. 197) and in Jer. Sukka 5.6 (55c).</page><page sequence="10">12 FINKELSTEIN [10] when actually they are found in no source. He says, referring to the Pesiqta 'n?p nmr ,' yi when the truth is that he emended the text not only through punctuating the words, but by inserting them. A curious combination of both types of error occurs in con- nection with the following baraita, found in ed. Horovitz, page 151, line 16 (Lauterbach, II, page 82, line 79). Ed. Horovitz reads: (1G) Dninm ' r (n IT n rmw ) a nri n I 1 ' B v n K ' W n a 1 n t r pmi n I a y n w I rl IDI n r :r n I rrnm)s mwi n r IAnm mnr fnDl nKip] rnri ip 9 ,nztyflw by yh' D n 1 n K 7Th rDi (t3 'n 1w) The verse ni: y3: 1Ino ln-i1 which has no connection here is obviously a copyist's error for nn'mn) Kin 1'Dr 3n n,' mnin n n Va ni:n). As I have shown elsewhere, the verses were frequently indicated in old sources merely by the initial letters of their words.9 Apparently the only word of this verse spelt out com- pletely in the parent text was ]p,' and this led the copyists to decipher it as the well known verse rn:3 yw 1n' ln:pi. Midrash Hakamim noticing the incongruity of the verse in the text before him, but unable to guess at the correct text, omitted it altogether. In the n= mrnc the proper correction is made, but Horovitz adheres to the original text, though he admittedly cannot make sense of it. Lauterbach accepts the emendation, but unnecessarily changes the words nrrn me n, n mrn win tfm to nrTnn ,nnmi:2 wn ti Nm in accordance with the Munich Ms. of the Mekilta and the Casanata Ms., and rejecting the more natural reading found in all the other sources, r t3 D T.

The fact had been remarked already by Professor Marx in his Introduction to Seder Olam Rabbah, p.

That would have indicated to them the relation of the Mss. to the editions, and of the Midrash Hakamim, the Sefer Vehizhir, and the Yemenite sources to one another. In the following pages, I attempt to make this clas- sification, and we shall see how many passages are illuminated through it. II. The Printed Editions. The Venice edition of 1545 is clearly independent of that published in Constantinople, thirty years earlier. There are a number of readings to be found in this edition which could not be scribal errors, and must go back to an independent source. But the source used by the Venice edition belongs to the same group as those which were utilized for the Constantinople edition. This can be demonstrated by a comparison of the two editions, which are so similar that their readings are most frequently simply marked - by both Lauterbach and Horovitz, without attempting any distinction between them. The following are examples of a few errors which are found in both editions, and in no other source, showing beyond question that they have the same manuscript paternityI?: 10 The similarity of the editions extends to the divisions into chapters, and the remarks at the end of the various divisions, which are practically always identical. Only at the end of Jethro, Constantinople reads: ywl' n~ns non i'm= nnn mnm -K: iW n' nK C:: C-K n i-i, -pn nSnn i-nn while Venice has simply: inn, nwin nmDn. I even suggest, with some hesitation, that the chapters were numbered in the parent text of the two editions, since both keep the same enumeration, although the heading of Chapter 2, in Mekilta Bo, is omitted in the Constantinople edition. The printer could hardly have num- bered the following chapter 3, unless he had found it so indicated in his source. This is further confirmed by the numbering of the chapters in- Masseket Shira, Beshallah.

This surmise is strengthened by the fol- lowing parallels between readings of the editions of the Mekilta and those found in citations of French authorities.

More significant variants common to Yalkut and Edds. are cited, in other connections, under 4 I; 40; 10 B. It is note- worthy, however, that there was current in France a text more akin to that of 3-t, and that this was used by Rashi (cf. below 4 D; 101 OB). This explains the relation between the reading of Mahzor Vitry and the MSS. in the example here given.

IV. The Manuscripts. A further examination of the witnesses to the text of the Mekilcta disclos-es the interesting fact that the two manuscripts which have been preserved almost in their entirety, namely Oxford and Munich, are closely akin to each ctther. This must be obvious to any student who looks over the variants in the Horovitz edition and notices how frequently the sigla Z N are found together in his list of variants. The following examples of errors found in both of these texts, and in none other, will show t-heir intimate relationship to each other: (4A) Page 4, line 8.

Among them is of course the Mekilita for the Song of Moses. I have fortunately been able to obtain a photograph of the Ms. and have collated its readings with those foundf in the variants of the Horovitz edition, and find that this Ms. belongs to the same group as those of the two complete Mekiltai Mss. This is demonstrated by the following readings, most of them erroneous, occurring in all three texts, and in none other: (4G) Page 115, line 11 (Lauterbach I, p. 254, line 156) j~ 1 ~ ~ [ f1fl1173Jli flTfl17 nll'rl l'HiO (4H) Page 130, line 6 (Lauterbach II, p. 32, line 31) rmp i prZn "&gt; : ir t IHID 7N I1 1 0 DM] ~hi ~'IR flX-n nIH (41) Page 131, line 17 (Lauterbach II, p. 35, line 84) [LDD.~ -io cm p 1 D3 all mw [16] 18</page><page sequence="17">THE MEKILTA AND ITS TEXT (4J) Page 132, line 6 (Lauterbach II, p. 36, line 95) n m?\mz1 Inin3 11In i-no on ' D ~ [Dm lm :in:3] IIl -'.in nH 1ynD'i 1' ln o : In [ 'n1 "rn'n n ln' ,in ) D'D3 Da"rn n&amp; lnCC ]n p '1 ntp nmy orn"n nr 1n1 1p (4K) Page 134, line 14 (Lauterbach II, p. 42, line 72) pj 1 C j D :'1K rYln D I :r yyin N"- (4L) Page 134, line 21 (Lauterbach II, p. 43, line 8) p 1 D L D "l'vWD in '11 D Z ']^tm3 6nm 'ngm (4M) Page 137, line 4 (Lauterbach II, p. 49, line 82) jp 1 t 8 D 7W 0n3 n'nn 't "K YD1 D v w nn wyw z y? rv (4N) Page 138, line 17 (Lauterbach II, p. 53, line 140) fD D m:{ i [Z pn n D lprn nr] nN] pn nN 1rmnyl j m om m 1 1 mnin; nl n i Vrl 3: o:Qm I rn nmn ipDy p '1 D33 Pvn WUr l^i n Cln;n Iip (40) Page 140, line 2 (Lauterbach II, p. 55, line 29) P n1 iDn 5 t1;1 iinm wn pmn. v ^ D1 1.

For I have already shown in the discussion of the texts of the Sifre on Deuteronomy, that the Casanata Ms. is representative of a group of Italian MSS. ,I3and it is thus clear that the two complete Mekilta Mss. are both of Italian lineage. It is interesting to note that texts belonging to this family were used by the author of the Pugio Fidei in Spain (about 1260). This will become clear from the consideration of the following special readings found only in N or in D: (4R) Page 18, line 5 (Lauterbach I, p. 4, line 2) f g ' V -yl PPV I- ?I1pip~ [Pugio, p. 864] X I 11 ~Tplyw p p In uI plz' 84 'Y Wfil ,1btnu1~l~~'1, lf~ 37 '37 ,11vNHfl?lT Nl"1zzl '3,' O' 13 ?11 kj 1 r Y1n 71-~7 ,IXM35 -1-11V (4S) Page 37, line 5, (Lauterbach I, p. 84, line 34) [Pugio, p. 864] 77'1T0 1-7 0-i ' R '-1 (4T) Page 89, line 8 (Lauterbach I, p. 201, line 192) .11I nl 3 "11111 MN13 [Pugio, p. 935] I'MID V 13 Ibid. p. 12.

It is for this reason that Lauterbach's text, which is based on the Mss., is so often better than that of Horovitz which follows the printed edition. V. The Common Ancestry of the Italian and the French Texts. An examination of the texts of the Mss. and that of the Yalkut and the printed editions, shows that they all derive ultimately from a single parent text, and include a number of errors which they have inherited from that ancient prototype. This becomes evident when we compare the readings common to these texts with those of the Midrash Hakamim, which in the case of the Mekilta, as in that of the Sifre, represents a different scribal tradition from the other texts. The following citations will show how true this is: (5A) Page 52, line 8 (Lauterbach I, p. 115, line 111) V'Vmj D aVry 11n:=i n K l I LA I I : 2 p D nil "K D"D mnlnn3 ml , p 1 : I L : onDon nlnl n MIsM m OmDuDm n [ re,DY l]lW '"l 1it [19] 21</page><page sequence="20">22 FINKELSTEIN [20] (5B) Page 127, line 7 (Lauterbach II, p. 25, line 44) ; flftpm rO inrw i iW l'nl ' i nII8 - 1 'D 1 N 6 1Y.n miNm -m D in w mnwl [N ln)m] inili lo1NDl '1"I t6 a rrm; ,n-c1 m IV n ID l n l r tsn l rn t) r D -CD1 'Dl",I ,1p n1 nu'pil 1n:Wl h,iv 1' n 'r m,; 1 'Dlv rllnn;n ,t rDi y 9 - I D nlO ty n pnw a "7Z nzn i' vmnn I,:rn H, :,p,ny;m , p 1 C D b L' 'np~n ,":: l"m n-t,n Dip'3i p , p '1 : p wDi nniu ibDWn T t D mnLt [ ,'7WDm (5C) Page 139, line 17 (Lauterbach II, p. 55, line 21) [ ' tyW] 134 N1U 'N ^ 13nD 18:3W "r :an n q1D ~OD li:np=W . 3 i. i' [Ri 'n1 qr'o1n, i,"7 .~ 'iD '5: ann 1D: '^Nts KiN 5iK:W lnw l [1 t ' ] [Z ni 1qrrl ti iD nnrn i, 1 C3 .

D R and of Yalkut-Ed. Pr. texts. VI. The Older Italian Texts. Closely akin to IF (the source of p 1 L D [ ), yet in some respects superior to it, were the Italian texts of the Mekilta utilized by R. Hillel, the author of the famous commentary on the Sifra and the Sifre, who lived in Crete, and R. Menahem ben Solomon, the author of the Sekel Tob, who probably lived in Italy. Both of these writers flourished in the middle of the twelfth century, i. e., about 150 years before the writing of Ms. N. The texts they used were doubtless much older. This accounts for the definite superiority of their readings, in spite of the fact that the impress of the Italian type of Ms. is already evident in their citations. I will endeavor to make this clear in the following citations: (6A) Page 78, line 9 (Lauterbach I, p. 176, line 91) n "rl lnln trl nr nlWt- nm lR nrIo lln n-'-n] nlmn [3 p'] 'rm ~ 11 Innn w :p] qm'nt :Nm nm noD ~n N -lip ID' p'T p 1 D 9DI' -IP] 1DI' v rap nrnn [N mDiK DtW p 1 D 3 N [-Wt 'lDl' {W l2p</page><page sequence="22">24 FINKELSTEIN [22] (6B) Page 78, line 16 (Lauterbach I, p. 177, line 103) [" 'ZV] lTp "' ,H l1' W" ' ] 1 O 3 p a loDl -lmp rrn an^ D'l IW D " a 9 p 3 [11 1 D 1 9'P p3] p ' 1 31 9'IP p 3 j 11D9 p ] 39l lDl9 p1 [D"6] 1 p: 1 D ' -lnp ,"n ' P-'nD l 1 DP'VD 1I' lr iImp Mn8D ^i ' 0 1 ' 9 p 3 (6C) Page 126, line 5 (Lauterbach II, p. 23, line 7) Inly 1'"3'n ,,TJD] p 1 D1 In ,f ' , D, i nnl I Ir l ' tin [6 ahyn] 1py 'R i:1 n^i D D n 1 [tvy ,nt I [Vny] [ "W] D "1 D (6D) Page 150, line 15 (Lauterbach II, p. 80, line 51) [used] b R.l DHlle a uD 'of the SnDe T 1w [w] p 1 Pae D 56 7ie 67I1y(eb 'a n I p. n 1 y , ln i I-IDe 1 (6E) Page 151, line 14 (Lauterbach II, p. 82, line 75) [,ffmn] ri w i y 5nNMp3 -n ' y wVa [rt31 'L] 1n^ inrw '69 m9s [p1 'L] ln In n np: n lnn bty 1?3 j1nN In1w 'ml7 RiN [ ?"'] p 1 D lo Iny ,11'rh n9DInM Inln nr oN C1na - iNrm , z1 i: LODn n] [Inv= y )) Sn nH n~mm wrm (6F) Page 304, line 8 -u mNri 1nm -i n m,n lmwnl ,,n 9 Ktl I ; !I 1 n; r11MI n^Tt T3iy)v nV 3^ln lDlowmnTl n1 n 5I'm 1 nI 'D= DKfl; ,I'0r '1 m- ' o wnlr :b ^n 'I] w 3 1 Z N [172 'y ,)pD]jtlB1 pizt p 1 n7n4 &lt;Inw iDIt nor mr'n iDw^m n -lnivil hImln On the other hand, the following examples show that the text used by R.

The Spanish Texts. In discussing the text of the Sifre, I indicated the grounds for my belief that the Midrash Hakamim, while written in Italy, utilized a Spanish text of that work.I3a But I felt that the I3a The parent text (Ed.) of ed. Ven. and ed. Const., was apparently deeply influenced by the Spanish readings of the Mekilta. It would seem as though the Ms. which lay at the basis of these texts was "corrected" on the basis of a Spanish Ms., and that thus many typical Spanish readings found their way into p 1. This is illustrated by examples 7Q; 12B; 6J. The agreement</page><page sequence="24">26 FINKELSTEIN [24] evidence was insufficient to reach a definite conclusion on the subject. The examination of the following parallels between the readings of the Midrash Hakamim and the works of the Spanish authors, Nahmanides, R. Nissim, and Alnaqua, for the Mekilta now confirm the original conjecture. Further confirmation is offered by the equally convincing parallels between Midrash Hakamim and Yalkut Ha-Makiri, whose author is likewise known to have used Spanish texts.I3b of these texts with Sefer Vehizhir in 10G, probably indicates that the Spanish texts, which are not represented for that passage, had the same reading as Vehizhir, and that through them it came to Ed. The examples could be multiplied. Cf. e. g. ed. Horovitz, p. 33, line 3 (Lauterbach I, p. 88) where [r'K] C D R read: [D mnlin] mnln nn i lx nl R while pl D read: ]' nlmnn n l ' x, n r.l . On p. 286, line 10, the words 1p'-s nI 1'w n'1 are omitted in O "l D R by homoioteleuton, but are found in D and Makiri, and apparently have been added in Ed. from a kindred source. On p. 312, line 13, we have the following variants: 3 Iy'lD T?Y ;D N Iy'D RI. 1W BIy p 1 D ly8,nt ny ['TnDD] y ' a n W 'y again showing a close relation between D and p 1. On the other hand, Ed. sometimes shows kinship to Makiri, even against D. Thus on p. 312, line 12, Ed. and Makiri read: ,ow P lo n n l n while all the other texts (L3 D K D) read: 'wDtv [D pl iy] lnn. More significantly on p. 25, line 7 (Lauterbach I, p. 57, line 89) the word irn, found in 3o D, and changed into ir''mn in R is omitted in D; and apparently following it was dropped in the parent text of Ed., since p 1 also omit it. Again on p. 26, line 6 (Lauterbach I, p. 59, line 117) the whole passage, nm,n IyU' ... . . - found in L D R is omitted in D by homoioteleuton. But apparently the scribe of the parent text of Ed. did not realize this, and thought it was a parallel baraita to the preceding and so omitted it, on the basis of some Spanish text. In my work on the Sife, Deuteronomy, I noticed a similar kinship between readings of 7 and ed. pr. I3b The text of the Mekilta cited by Alnaqua deserves closer consideration than I have been able to give it here. Its obvious relationship to that of D is indicated by the examples given here. But there is also a closer relation between its readings of the Mekilta and that of the Oriental texts, and in some instances it shows definitely the influence of the Mekilta of R. Simeon ben Johai. Thus in his citation from the Mekilta (Jethro, Bahodesh chap. 7, ed. Lauterbach II, p. 252, line 63), Alnaqua (Vol. III, p. 573) cites the first phrase 1iinnn nlnli rmsin nlir and then, as the editor points out, continues with a passage taken from Mekilta of R. Simeon ben Johai, Ki Tisa, 31.16 (p. 161) without at all indicating that this is an insertion from another work: 4KR nn 13J'KW 'r t OK no . . .

Horovitz, p. 114, line 13, Lauterbach I, p. 252) of a passage which occurs also in Mekilta of R. Simeon ben Johai 14.31 (p. 55). While the first part of the citation faithfully follows the readings of the Mekilta, the last lines referring to a text which became confused in our Mekilta, follow the Mekilta of R. Simeon ben Johai. These citations seem to me to indicate definitely that the text of the Mekilta used by Alnaqua, had in some manner been changed under the influence of the Mekilta of R. Simeon ben Johai. Since we know that the Spanish Jews had copies of the Mekilta of R. Simeon ben Johai, for it is cited by Nachmanides, this need not surprise us. It is perhaps necessary further to remark, in discussing Alnaqua's citations from the Mekilta that the passage on p. 20 of Vol. III, line 16, which the editor ascribes to the Sifre going so far, as to insert the words -'DD= ',Da1 in the text, are taken not from the Sifre, but from the parallel passage in the Mekilta, like the citation on line 5 of the same page. A careful examination of the readings will show this.</page><page sequence="26">FINKELSTEIN ' l n =3 K 5 ~ , vy' KN Kiy l', 1lt [3 "'D3 iDn ownmn] (7F) Page 33, line 2 (Lauterbach I, p. 74, line 87) n nimn-u 6I n l1 D n Nipn 5i 'anm ,'l-n mnlD ,mp31N] n rmn nK 5KK n x D n n K ,pn ri [411 'y ,"n ,~iy1y p 1 : b npni n nm :nlv I i [ K 3 :t N"1] l 3 ilpn 'i [D"oi ',D ,lml,D 'n rlm] (7G) Page 126, line 11 (Lauterbach II, p. 23, line 14) n nmlx t-pn nmi ['a O"nD bYrw '"'3D] nDl)lH nnnll CTp; Tnl o3 K [K 'D1n] 1nIm1 n n w n 1 D nminx t-rpn nll p 1 'l .'wm In 1D [r1 n-imml] mi nnmx W-rpn nm' (7H) Page 128, line 7 (Lauterbach II, p. 28, line 74) [1'Di] D 'ln rn'o3 'nlmN t3yl [In':t-] p 1 LD K) I'" n'-;o [,':w ,) n 31 ] a n a ,m: 'y (71) Page 159, line 3 (Lauterbach II, p. 98, line 8) [P":v ,3l"1"m] n IDily na nR"pn i =p a 1 on [Dtoran -Dn Kn ":mi] p 1 lo Ily n n-"pn i3tm 1 i' o (7J) Page 162, line 13 [l":Do] D Svnn =nS 3In P 1 [D 7D K% fin[ 1Jrn l]n (7K) Page 257, line 9 p1D- z 1NK T D [ I [D MI n3mrD' p -DD'] m1r31n' M9 [l"mn] -0 ' n 3 [D n 3t n:n1,] nn;,D' aS (7L) Page 286, line 3 ['1 :TD n'pw yT0' ] n 11^ nlW93 ]D9 W'K 'l1K1 p 1 W'Knv W9 tv' )3 vm n Dl 191n ml 9 nra o W', n 11 (7M) Page 312, line 13 InD ;rry^t 8n D?)] ) DmmW a) IDtn " fn K y T Nl K [(146 'y) 'f p 1 t3 D b k ,wl ,D'n "':v [- ln'5] ln'5 (7N) Page 92, line 12 (Lauterbach I, p. 207, line 42) tHnem [nimp4 ;nl i nn ] minrnm St nnp5 inrvpm n-imn 'i nn,1p' -p 'n yw [n -f i n,' I n t t ,'n rlp3S3] nfn-1 nNt1 [21 'Y n"n ,annl nVnl3 ,1lp311 ] 28 [26]</page><page sequence="27">[27] THE MEKILTA AND ITS TEXT 29 ' i D br 3 [L3 n 3 3 3] In li K 1 p irin p3i ipnllm 'ni inwp3i 131nn3 i"n vn tmn1 nD3&gt; 'npvri3p ti ntin iDI1b 'ii n ' n 'l IR ' 11b fTl" n i n rlrin lt t3 N mrnirv n17 11 ' I 11 D Ini I I' 13 i rnp nrip" rlnnp-m ' ( 7 nnL p 9 nen 16131 ') I mvi5n tn t i [p n 'l I i3 n3 [ti m1 n tp3 irlnn- p InHtl '1H 1 1 MI MI ; 1 Ila Mt il- ii Rpb 1 t I np p p 1 D iT m, n: nn n 1p:: ( n w pa 27 ln 7 ( L nu e1i npi intp p4i i3lnnm 1 ,,,in3 n D n :3inR I 1?i R i nnl nD3N [ r3t] nt33M Zi I33n 11I-1l N" 3ITD 1 n D n Itr In tp3 i (70) Page 115, line 7 (Lauterbach I, p. 254, line 150) I I zl 1 til T yl nlm m lnnin3D DN3^ 'n3 i3m^n3w I'Dm 3 nlm. ,^lnuIP] n n1 ~ r] 13 5:W nln ~iorl Un3n3 i ,r:r rr]n m ['":a1 153 'Y ,'J"n ,Npn 5 nl3]D ,p3' ' n~ 1i [ 8 llD nS ~]n lym irnlm3N Irnnt m,;l :D n3 : 33 N i jz I17] lzP -Ip= 1I1D3 tim3n mbly1 1313r D ^ nl: m^lnl ln3^ 7TDn -p31 ';nI1 1 3K [ip3m3pt 'n 133n] Dily: [DU 0^nl3] Ilrnli3 l: DKtW n30K [p i 3OW] C3r3 LIK 61yT m 3n 3 [p r a3B] P^ [N nlmi] n[ l llzWU;ti nr Lp 1 I rnl Imm m nlDK n3 D n !p:: (7P) Page 158, line 2 (Lauterbach II, p. 96, line 163) ,lrUmn] ilm l m Ki W n iDw nDD rmnDi mW nr nyn r3m 3 v WiUl [p"3^ ,n9nD] ] ?^D i W 3 'y n nn3 n3nou nnn3 n1lDH: [,"tyr g nilD ninln [;1p3]iK i3 nH] nK [p3tm1 /?] nK ap 1b3IK lby [3t:W ,151 'y Tn ,nlp33 ] [3 mnDK&lt;] 13Dc&lt;3 Ini n w 1v3 I I U W W :Dz D -ryn 1rrym Irn a "p 1i'b rz y [t3 H D] 1 'y yn imn m;nml nlnm;m n 1i t 3 tN mlz: ;m;n11ri I ni3n n 11 n 3I -1 ^n li3 N W 13 v I D I3n t Dt nrtsyn Il3ym itrwm p i1 n min 3 mir p z On) 1 by J y 1 1 3z nm3 nm (7Q) Page 227, line 7 (Lauterbach II, p. 247, line 137) [21 'y no] nlt ^ Dw93 p'DlD</page><page sequence="28">30 FINKELSTEIN [28] VIII. The Kinship of the Spanish and Italian Texts. While the Midrash Hakamim text, with its Spanish ante- cedents, belongs to a different group from the Italian texts which we have discussed, it is easy to show that both lines derive from a common source. We have seen that this is true with regard to the extant texts of the Sifre'4 and it is significant that it is also true of the Mekilta.

The Mekilta Text in the Pesiqta Zutreta. The Pesiqta Zutreta is generally supposed to have been com- posed in the Balkan peninsula toward the end of the eleventh century. This is about half a century before the writing of the Sekel Tob, and the text of the Pesiqta Zutreta gives corresponding evidence of superiority. In several instances, it alone has pre- served a reading of the Mekilta superior to that found in any of the Mss. (9A) Thus in ed. Horovitz, p. 209, line 4 (corresponding to ed. Lauterbach II, p. 205, line 64) we read in the Mss. and editions of the Mekilta: nDw ny 1 'Y3: T 'i oD ',n) , 1';1n 013D 717 '31. There are a number of unimportant differences between the various texts, but substantially this is the reading of p 1 tL3 D R n for the passage. It is clear that the reply to the hypothetical question has accidentally been dropped by the copyists, but it is [29] 31</page><page sequence="30">FINKELSTEIN supplied by comparison with the text of the Mekilta of R. Simeon ben Johai, Vehizhir, Pesiqta Zutreta, and Sekel Tob, all of which end the passage with the phrase mp 'ln ' "n This reading is accepted by both Horovitz and Lauterbach. (9B) On p. 254, line 2, the extant texts read: nwn m1 iDni 'n1 1 K N &amp;y II y rI1 - m y I vw rnw wn o Hl D41pyn 1'rlpW p 1 L3. But the verse cited proves nothing about the matter, and is clearly an erroneous substitute for wr =w'1 mily 'y (I Samuel 1,22) which does prove the point. Pesiqta Zutreta, alone, of all the texts has preserved this correct reading. But there can be no doubt that the text of Pesiqta Zutreta is derived from the parent source. This is shown by the following erroneous readings which it shares with the other members of this family. (9C) On page 189, line 10 (Lauterbach II, p. 164, line 36) we find the following explanation of the name z''p: [rD] p 1 D3 L ln 1L? 1n pl [ 1 M'pVk] D'bD ptKp ''p n -mirn nb n;mpr ''p It is clear that this text of It"D p 1 D3 D is a com- bination of two separate variants, one rmnn n7 T3ptw preserved in D, the other a'row mpw not found by itself. The fact that Pesiqta Zutreta has this reading shows that it was already found in the parent text of these various sources, and was retained by them. We may perhaps assume that the variant had not yet become an integral part of the text Eu, but was written between the lines or on the margin, so that the parent text of D did not retain it. (9D) On page 192, line 9 (Lauterbach II, p. 171, line 129) we read the following baraita: Ir:y wDIW1 IV tIR^ I= n Inm 19 now [p I Nryv Unrifc] nym p 'D] 1inb [p 1 t nt; ^nnr1] Tnfl n nyn3 yDV'1 '121 [/ l~nmnl] ~limniD [/ 'il] no,n5yl ;mmi n nt iltn [ 1 n D K P 1 D K D 'n^ Y l'oi [D 1n3r1] ln":nn The word nni like its variant lIni of the texts D b is undoubtedly awkward, but a comparison with the parallel text of the Mekilta of R. Simeon ben Johai shows that it 32 [30]</page><page sequence="31">THE MEKILTA AND ITS TEXT is a remnant of nioi 'yTnloi nty?i 'n and that the correct reading of the baraita is this: n' irn mI y'nlin nltyib '1 lnl by V l"D ii lrn3;m imns no 'lr inmyl nm. Yet Pesiqta Zutreta has the following: ' nn'Y qpZl ;n~1 iirln Do showing that its text of the Mekilta was related to Eu. (9E) On page 192, line 19 (Lauterbach II, p. 172, line 146) we have the following expression of Jethro: nr~x Vop3 mi 1 l'm lrn m n in n D n i. This is a satisfactory reading, except that it occurs in no other text. The most common variant is: [l'on] D D T Dl ln 1Jim Inn -nnD i. But this is grammatically impossible. The following text is found in Pesiqta Zutreta and Sekel Tob: i'in nanDn ir ml l= lin D 1 p D. It is clear from a comparison of these readings that Mekilta of R. Simeon ben Johai has pre- served the original reading ml: in 13w (nt;r) mnin nnmr i. In Eu or in some early text descendant from it, the word nznmD was accidentally corrupted into nantn Lt. This made the phrase l;nn nn-in % grammatically difficult, and an early scribe endeavored to correct it, by inserting the word mnpD before imin. But apparent- ly he wrote the word mpop above the line or on the margin, so that while it was retained in some texts, (mnnmlr np'D ,1t: I ,n) it dropped out of the parent text of p 1 D3 D R. The copyist who wrote the arche- type of jl , tried to ease the difficulty before him by emending mnn hnn-3n % into Imm r mnl h TnDi. (9F) On page 199, line 16 (Lauterbach II, p. 185, line 99) we read of Moses's farewell to his father-in-law: lni' :Vy iw v n i m m. This text is found in the Venice Edition, and also in D and the Mekilta of R. Simeon ben Johai. But it is not found in the other texts, the variants for -l1333 being )3 nmi'D O3 XN ml33 , [O" ,t"s] ilnm1 all of which are impossible. It is clear that some error crept into Eu or a descendant text, and that mn333 was changed to lnl:13, and thence the other changes were made. But since rln=: is found also in Pesiqta Zutreta, it is clear that that text is derived from Eu. [31] 33</page><page sequence="32">FINKELSTEIN As I remarked in the discussion of the Sifre texts, the text of t"D shows a remarkable kinship to that of D. At the time I thought that incompatible with the even more pronounced kinship D showed for the Spanish texts. But it seems to me likely at the present writing that text used by the author of the Pesiqta Zutreta was akin to that which went to Spain, and which thus became ancestor not only to the citations in Nahmanides, R. Nissim, and Alnaqua, but also to D. The fol- lowing variant readings will show the close relation between D and r"9 for the Mekilta: (9G) Page 191, line 5 (Lauterbach II, p. 168, line 90) [^"'zV] ;rr3 nr31 1lnl m rr =w ,rh^ 1 ni n;11 ;1 w "Wn ~ n (9H) Page 193, line 2 (Lauterbach II, p. 172, line 151) [D I'm1] lnCa 1'3 n ': , r : "3 n Wy n n R , a 1 '' :,r n '3W 1T n ;SY [[D 1'pr] In V 1'n nwiIly nn K1I ['"'t'y] D D R [D lnt'] 1T' 0 1'mn 1'n nvy Ri DR1 lnVN I': VnY 1rI DO1i 'AM VntY InWm K L'8V m N a X I ":pl bnbip^ i nvy :) " nIryn ao D rrn zw i:Mn nvy N 9 a 4 I (91) Page 266, line 5 3 D li? nlnDr nn I^ 2 N Ini ntr p 1 tO n D X 1;I 0 u Inn -In I in ^ lVin -.t (9J) On page 257, line 9, we read in the Mekilta: ,' z' o y L r p I 1 D '1i R i:tn= lhW ninT 1tr 'irn.

Ishmael, tradition supplants the Written Word of Scripture. This is definitely stated in Midrash Tannaim 34 [32]</page><page sequence="33">THE MEKILTA AND ITS TEXT to Deut. 24.1 (p. 154). Apparently, however, the writer of ? had it also in his text of the Mekilta, for he adds before the word rmmnn, the following: ,n3n7 n,wwn nnm itl binp n nm [nspiy] nrply nrnnvt. These words are in fact necessary in the context, for without them the phrase 'i,1 Dn nrmnm, becomes a mere repetition of mni i::. As Horovitz noticed, they were apparently also found in the Mekilta text used by the author of Pesiqta Zutreta, which reads as follows: nn-iD minn Nipn [nnply] nyilp nzrn -r mmz zD 1 y n i13. X. The Text of the Sefer Vehizhir. The Sefer Vehizhir is an anonymous work composed about the tenth century and wrongly ascribed to Hefez ben Yazliah. Only the part relating to Exodus, Leviticus, and the beginning of Numbers has been preserved. In this part the work contains numerous citations from the tannaitic commentaries on these books. The text of the Mekilta cited by the Sefer Vehizhir is different from that of any of the sources we have thus far discussed. In a number of instances the reading which it has preserved is definitely superior and more authentic than that recorded in any other text. (10A) A good example is offered by the passage in ed. Horovitz, page 226 (corresponding to ed. Lauterbach II, p. 246, line 125) which reads in our texts: 3,: by nimn ply npI) yvl p7 y3 ^In 1p ym r2z N 1i'n1D vIn Ir nr 1 miDI D I 'l w p1o.

The original form Dz ',r-n im ,nn Dv bvy ri'n,y n Hwn was changed by a writer who wished to make it clearer, and substituted on,w for cnty.

Hence the parent text of 3D [ changed the reading by adding the word mmnvy making the phrase Dnlwym n Dfnw D Kn qDZ %V. The parent text of p 1 3 changed D Lwv to :nt Lw, which appears for the first time in the readings of 13 and D 1. The expression n;tr 5w was still awkward however, and 3 con- sequently substitutes :ntr wn while the source of p 1 emends to nnt ~m lnll 1a' OaK. (10C) On page 261, line 7 Vehizhir alone supplies the verse D' tD3 i: ' 'n r'ni to which the baraita 1 ~n 'Km ynlW yDt3ni nilv is appended. Horovitz, in this instance, accepts the superior reading of Vehizhir. Yet there can be no doubt that the Mekilta text of Vehizhir was derived from the same parent text as the other witnesses which we have been considering. This will become obvious from a consideration of the following sets of variants, in which errors common to Vehizhir and all the other sources will be presented.

The parallel passage in Tosefta Yoma 5.6, does not contain the words spaced, and that doubtless is correct. But the words niDwl nlmun o'y-N n-Imp%l, added by a careless scribe, are found in all the extant texts of the Mekilta including Vehizhir.

But actually the word n r was merely a corruption of n 1 and was originally joined to the following nmr'. The corruption arose from the fact that r,n1 was spelt with a Yod after the Heh to indicate the preceding segol, as was common in Palestinian Mss.'6 The word was therefore written mnwm. This misled the later copyists, because it is unusual to insert such vowel indicators in biblical citations. He therefore read n'i1rm n1'rt as ,r', nt Irm. The original form of the baraita was thus simply: anK ,n-mm ;rltn ,nmy' RH nW. The point of the statement is that the subjects of the two verbs are not the same, the duty of 'ny rests on the master, that of redemption on the father. The fact that the corruption is found in t as well as in the other Mekilta texts shows that all of them have a common lineage.

According to the second baraita, which corresponds to Sifre, Deuteronomy 121 (Friedmann 99a), the slave's ear is not bored if the master have no family. The corrupt text arose out of an attempt to combine the two baraitot, one of which had doubtless been added on the margin and added later to the text.

Maimonides in his Sefer Ha-Mizvot ascribes approximately fifty passages to the Mekilta. More than thirty of them can be traced to our Mekilta; ten to the Mekilta of R. Simeon; and ten to the Sifre Zutta on Numbers. What then was the relation of these books to each other in the codices used by Maimonides? The natural suggestion which occurs to one is that all three treatises were found in his Mss. as a single unit, just as in our Mss. and editions, the Sifre on Numbers is combined with the Sifre on Deuteronomy though they derive from different schools. It seems almost incredible that if Maimonides had known the books which he cites under the name of Mekilta as three separate works, he would not have added some distinguishing attribute in making his citations, so as to guide the reader properly. Furthermore in Neg. Com. 60, Maimonides actually cites a</page><page sequence="41">THE MEKILTA AND ITS TEXT passage from our Mekilta, and then another from the Mekilta of R. Simeon which he introduced with the words, tni,Dnl 1 D D indicating that both passages come from the same work. On the other hand, it is also true that in two passages, Pos. Cor. 20, and Neg. Com. 15, Maimonides does distinguish the Mekilta of R. Simeon'9 by calling it, forsooth, Dtyvro 'nTn tn1,=. He uses the same name for the Sifre Zutta, in his Introduction, Root 11. This would seem to indicate that he had codices containing only the Mekilta of R. Simeon and the Sifre Zutta, and that these, strangely, both went under the name of Mekilta of R. Ishmael. It is noteworthy that his son, R. Abraham, also cites the Sifre Zutta as Mekilta of R. Ishmael (Ma'ase Nissim, Paris 1867, p. 60 bottom). To complicate the matter further, Maimonides remarks in his Introduction to the Yad: qlD y mnr nI t-;'9 ny ' '-Il Nnr, linan N,py '1 pl 1 n , ? nf bnp:n wm rmnnnl, a statement which would indicate that he had a work called Mekilta of R. Ishmael which covered all the last four books of the Bible. Even granting that he might have made the statement though he no longer possessed a Mekilta on Leviticus, he must certainly have found in his Mekilta of R. Ishmael codices, also the Mekilta on Deuteronomy, which actually goes back to the School of R. Ishmael. But to spoil this theory, Maimonides regularly cites the Mekilta as well as the Sifre to Deuteronomy under the name Sifre,20 indicating that in his codices, the two were combined. Finally, while in the Sefer Ha-Mizvot Maimonides clearly gives preference to the readings of our Mekilta, where its text is parallel to that of the Mekilta of R. Simeon ben Johai (see for example, Root 4, ed. Heller 8d), in his Moreh, he prefers the reading of the Mekilta of R. Simeon ben Johai (see Moreh, part II, chap. 32, end, ed. Munk, Vol. II, p. 74b). I9 This is especially noteworthy in Pos. Com. 20, where he cites the ordinary Mekilta without any attribute, and the Mekilta of R. Simeon, as Mekilta of R. Ishmael. 20 So, e. g. Neg. Cor. 95, 140. [41] 43</page><page sequence="42">FINKELSTEIN It is obvious from all this that at present no definite conclusions can be reached as to the form in which Maimonides possessed the tannaitic Midrashim. On the other hand, it is certain from the finds which have been made in the Genizah2I that there were extant in Egypt separate codices of the Mekilta of R. Simeon and of the Sifre Zutta. It is only these texts that made their way, apparently from Egypt into Yemen. For the Yemenite texts of the Midrashim contained, so far as we can judge, only the Mekilta of R. Simeon on Exodus and the Sifre Zutta on Numbers, while for Deuter- onomy they had a combined Sifre consisting of the Midrashim of both Schools. A study of the citations of the Mekilta found in the Sefer Ha-Mizvot shows it to have been a definitely Oriental text. Its nearest relatives are the texts used by the Sefer Vehizhir and the Pesita Zuqtreta, as we might have expected a priori. In fact one of the passages cited by Maimonides, and depended upon by him for a decision in the Yad, becomes clear only by com- parison with the parallel passage in the Vehizhir, which in turn it illumines. Maimonides says, (Positive Commandment No. 155), lwbl lnU7t DIrbn 1DV l l n;IIM l VD7 -W 3 nrwVr D1 nR -1O t NnS: 1nN'KC: 1m;vWpl lnD1V l -TW7 3p 13NJ1 "181 17y The passage indicated by the spaced letters occurs neither in our text of the Mekilta nor in the Mekilta of R. Simeon, or for that matter anywhere else in the extant tannaitic literature. Yet Maimonides relies upon it for the following decision which he renders in the Yad, D nn'-m nnwu Dr n, wrp nnnln lp nry nim r:)ti 1 CYl vrpi nrmw n-rx rnzlt nDnD lWnph nnwr Di, nm -lDr ID nW 21 Doctor Benjamin Lewin discovered seven leaves of the Mekilta of R.

Simeon were published by Doctor Schechter (Jewish Quarterly Review, 1904, p. 443-5) and were utilized by Hoffmann in his edition (see Introduction, p. IX). Of the Sifre Zutta, one fragment was published by Doctor Schechter in Jewish Quarterly Review, 1894, p. 657; and another by Prof. I. N. Epstein, in Tarbiz I, 1, p. 46ff. 44 [42]</page><page sequence="43">THE MEKILTA AND ITS TEXT n3w 'n) rnlmn 3 n rnKm 1l WIPm p l3z= 1 I i n I ' I 3 I InD3DM (.'K D"3 The commentaries to the passage struggle in vain to find the source for this decision.

The editor has put the spaced words in parentheses apparently because they make no sense, giving us a protasis without the necessary apodosis, but having in mind the citation in Maimonides, we can complete the sentence, I believe, and it must have read somewhat as follows: inw',n] rnDo,nn i , 1' Inw'n1 lw-3np InDo'n inWn1p [lwnpi nr;rvn Dl nK ltr 'i"n p'lD. Maimonides, of course, had the full text of which he cites only the end. In the parent of our Mekilta texts, the apodosis had been omitted (perhaps through homoioteleuton), and only the few, meaningless words still preserved in Vehizhir had remained. The other texts did not transcribe them. The fact that the Vehizhir alone of all the texts has retained a remnant of this ancient reading would indicate the close relation between its text of the Mekilta and that used by Maimonides. Unfortunately, however, the few citations in Maimonides and the fragmentary nature of the Vehizhir permit no definite conclusions on the subject. On the other hand, there is indication that the text of Maimonides is descended from the same ancestry as the other Mekilta texts now extant,22 in the citation he makes in Neg. Com. 317, from Mekilta, Mishpatim, chap. 19, p. 317, line 14ff. The Mekilta there reads: R .-nIRi Nn yh N win " D ,Iyn N 9 ^ pn Hi oani ,on3:i n3yn"i n:n ln nn "p pt' In Q 1 '1=i r ' 3v l'm y 3mnl Trm ';lNIN RI' enn3 1 nrinm l'"I .nlNn RN 1y= QoiWDl 1"pm1 NI xt'3 OWIVV 22 This is confirmed by what we found in the analysis of the Sifre on Deuteronomy where the text of Maimonides is almost identical with that of the Midrash Ha-Gadol, and both derive from an ancestral text which they share with the European texts.

Elijah Gaon of Wilna remarked, it is obvious that the passage at the end (indicated by the spaced words above) has been misplaced, for it would naturally come before the words IlnN lID. R. Elijah's suggestion, that the text be emended by putting the passage there, is accepted by Horovitz. What seems to me probable is that the passage beginning with 1nDi lODn and ending with jly mr lily is an interpolation. This view is strengthened by the following considerations: 1. The passage beginning with rnN lI1t0 is certainly corrupt, for among the four separate penalties it enumerates are those for cursing one's father, the prince, and the judge. But as the commentators have pointed out there is no special provision against cursing one's father; that law is implied in those against cursing others (see p. 268, line llff.). But since there is no special prohibition mentioned in the matter, there can be no special penalty for it. (Cf. notes of Horovitz, ad loc.). 2. The statement of R. Judah ben Bathyra as it stands is meaningless, as Horovitz has noted. For the verse in Scripture does not at all indicate that 'wn 1," n'tv , y =,n wn, H. On the contrary, a careful distinction is made between 1"i and W'V. Such errors and confusion, as was found in the Sifre, are most common in interpolations, which, being written in small letters, on the margin, were frequently copied with difficulty and inaccurately. But either on the assumption of R. Elijah Gaon, that the passage mlpwn ~ ... Y pin t? mn,I had been misplaced, or on my suggestion, that the words '~li rnN ]rNc are an interpolation, it is clear from the fact that Maimonides quotes the whole passage in conformity with our reading, that his texts were descended from the same lineage from which ours are derived.</page><page sequence="45">[45] THE MEKILTA AND ITS TEXT 47 XII. The Yemenite Text of the Mekilta. As has been stated, the only Mekilta cited in the Midrash Ha-Gadol on Exodus is the Mekilta of R. Simeon. On the other hand the sources from which the author of the Midrash Ha-Gadol drew were clearly well-acquainted with our Mekilta and cited it. It is thus that we find in the Midrash Ila-Gadol for Deuteronomy long passages which are obviously derived from our Mekilta to the parallel passages in Exodus. It is interesting to note that the text cited shows a close kinship to that of Vehizhir, and is apparently derived from the same parent text, since both contain the same, peculiar copyist's errors. The following passages show this:23 (12A) Page 227, line 5: It is c lear tht i n asa , the parent text of Vehizhir an Midra [ ta-dol bot] D omitt a whole line containing th This close relati [on between the ] text of Vehizhir and the 'Yemeni ] te sources is confirmd by a cmparison if t he Vehizhi [n-D] t nrmiu Wy rmw [n"o (12B) Page 227, line 9: [1]"D] p 1 : D [1n MDri ,1 D 9KD] ai D D D npli J? nD SUON -n i n- D ?np1? 1? rnD [n-v] tWKI NTy1 a i n 1 D D np11 J9 nD It is clear that in passage 12A, the parent text of Vehizhit and Midrash Ha-Gadol both omitted a whole line containing the spaced words; and in 12B, that the unusual word irmcN8 was misread rnin I=D which Midrash Ha-Gadol expands to gDz wl -iyl n;rn. This definitely marks the two texts as closely associated. This close relation between the text of Vehizhir and the Yemenite sources is confirmed by a comparison of the Vehizhir 23 For the text of Midrash Ha-Gadol to these passages, see Midrash Tannaim, ed.

It is possible to compare the texts satisfactorily only for that part of the Sifra which is edited by Friedmann, and of this only one chapter is cited in the Vehizhir.

The discussion which we have thus far pursued has demon- strated that all our available texts and citations of the Mekilta derive ultimately from a common source. The close kinship between Vehizhir and the European texts on the one hand, and 24 I have utilized Friedmann's readings for the citations from the Sifra, adopting the following sigla: K for Ms. Vatican I; : for Ms. Vatican II; ) for Ms. Breslau; n for Tanhuma; and a'nn for the Midrash Ha-Gadol (ed. Rabinowitz). The other sigla are the same as for the rest of the paper.</page><page sequence="47">THE MEKILTA AND ITS TEXT the Yemenite-Maimonidean texts on the other, leaves little room for doubt in the matter. We may therefore construct the following table of lineage among the texts of the MIekilta:24a PARENT TEXT OF THE MEKILTA E P (The extant texts are indicated by the Hebrew sigla used in the rest of the paper; the hypothetical texts by Roman letters; full lines indicate descent, broken lines partial influence). XIV. The Mechanics of the Editions. No less important than the preparatory work of classifying the texts and of choosing the correct readings, is that of provid- ing the proper mechanical devices for the student. I have myself sinned in this regard in the first part of my edition of the Sifre, where I was not careful to retain the same order of the sigla throughout. The result will inevitably be trouble for the student, but I could not make the corrections in proof, and had to let the error stand for the part that was already in press, when I discovered how grave the difficulty was. 24a I want to thank Mr. Joseph B. Abrahams, Secretary of the Jewish The- ological Seminary of America for his kindness in drawing the diagram. [47] 49</page><page sequence="48">FINKELSTEIN It should be a rule that when a passage is omitted from one text, that omission should be marked in a single note; it is improper to indicate it by halves, as is done, e. g. in ed. Horovitz, p. 273, line 1. The whole passage is omitted in the Sefer Vehizhir, and only part in the Yalkut. The editor divides this variant into two, and remarks to line 1 'nr [nwt, - N"i; and then to line 2:'n 't r [tLot - 1,Wr. This gives a false impression of some connection between t and 3 which does not exist. It would be justifiable only if it were known that t and L3 belong to the same group, which they do not. Thus again on page 270, line 13, the words 4m ylwi of most texts are replaced by ln ql in the Midrash Hakamim. This should be indicated by the following sign: ln Nl [,' ymiw, instead the editor divides the variant into two parts and says: ypmW D 1D 1i -'n D [4:N. On page 227, line 13, the editor remarks: D r a R 'n ,D o. l wa. This leaves the actual reading of D in doubt. Such errors are not infrequent. More frequently the student is misled-and perhaps the editor himself was misled-by the habit of mentioning only the authorities for the variant reading, instead of the authorities both for the accepted reading, and for that rejected. Thus on page 261, line 15, we read in Ed. Horovitz: (14A) lS77 MD nD I nln 91.lm 1 ) ni -n-4 1 n In nlD 1I ID= .p3nm 1l] IN p3no This is altogether in accordance with the well-known halaka that the punishment for adultery is p3n. On looking into the variant we note the innocent remark "=D3 - ,,on 7 N which indicates that one Ms. (that of Oxford)25 and the printed edi- tions read ,"Do instead of pron. The editor takes no note of this variant in his commentary and we should pass it over as readily as he does, if we neglected to observe that the reading p3n= which he accepts is based only on the Yalkut and the Vehizhir. For all his other texts, the Munich Ms., the Midrash Ilakamim and the Pesiqta, omit the passage entirely. Now the Yalkut and the Sefer Vehizhir, are both compilations whose 25 In I the passage has been omitted, through homoioteleuton. 50 [48]</page><page sequence="49">THE MEKILTA AND ITS TEXT authors might naturally be suspected of changing the text of the Mekilta to suit that of the recognized Mishnaic law. Their evidence in this instance is therefore doubtful. It is further- more a possible conjecture that the texts which omitted the passage did so because they could not reconcile their reading of it with the Mishnaic law. It is therefore most likely that the correct reading of the passage is: l D m 1t ql3 l ' ' D m lnm nr and that, as Friedmann remarks, the law recorded in the Mekilta differed from that given in the Talmud. As frequently, the School of R. Ishmael was more severe in its punishments than that of R. Akiba, and prescribed 9,,D instead of prn, for adultery. The editor would himself probably have escaped his error had he listed the variants thus: 1 K ?"D= t D p3nm. The note would have shown him at once that the reading 4',Dm had far better authority than pn3. On page 274, line 18, the Mekilta lays down the rule mnir ,rym: nt. This is repeated on page 276, line 6. Horovitz retains this text in both places, but remarks in his commentary, both times, that the word rnym? should be emended to ntVw. He has no authority for this suggestion, save the parallel passages in the Talmud. Yet it is obvious that we have here a factional deviation from the standard halaka of the Talmud. (14B) A similar emendation is made on page 247, line 15, where however, the editor undertook to change the text itself. The passage is omitted in Midrash Hakamim. According to ed. pr., which Horovitz follows the baraita reads: Inwip riinn y 3 ny -.I n -p n 'I i"n nrrt ali -7my 1wKip' ^Iv This rule seems humanitarian enough, but unfortunately lacks the virtue of lucidity. How was the Torah compelled to call the slave iny? And if it was how does that prove that the master may not call him by that name? But the Mss. and the Sefer Vehizhir have an entirely different reading. According to them the baraita says: ay T3m nr3p 3n : trrn litm olwv -73y i3Hipn [N iK t KiK vb t il] iK lf t 1 '=D KN n mp [t min:n] nmnn mnn n- [ir ] y It is clear that the correct text is that preserved in :) and that the Mekilta intends to sanction, not to forbid, calling the [49] 51</page><page sequence="50">52 FINKELSTEIN [50] Hebrew slave nny. The Sefer Vehizhir made an effort to soften the statement, and a similar effort was made by the copyist of N. But the apodosis which neither of them dared change stands as final proof against them and in favor of the text of 1 D. The rules for editing tannaitic texts, which I should thus put down on the basis of the experience I have had in the Sifre, and of what I have noticed from the Mekilta, are these: 1. The classification of the texts must precede any attempt at the selection of readings. 2. The editor must not give preference to the text which happens to be printed, simply because it is a customary text. 3. When all the known texts are derived from a single source, the editor must frequently allow himself considerable discre- tion with regard to emendation of the text, when the error appears in all the manuscripts and editions before him. 4. To avoid all confusion for the student, the editor should give in the variants the word or words with regard to which the texts disagree. It is not enough to let the student guess to which word the variant refers.26 5. The variants should be so arranged that the student will be able to see which are peculiar to a single text, and which belong to a whole family of texts. 6. Above the list of variants, on each page, the editor should indicate the texts he utilized in the editing of that page; and if some of them cover only part of it, which part of it they cover. This will enable the student to reconstruct the reading of all the texts without taking the trouble to search back through the variants to discover whether the particular passage he is studying occurs in all the Mss. As an alter- native, it may prove easier to list after each variant which has the support of more than one text, all the texts which support the reading chosen for the main text. 26 At the meeting of the Academy, at which this paper was read, some of the hearers believed that this need not be a fixed rule; they thought that the word with regard to which the texts disagree need be given in the variants only when there is possibility of doubt.</page><page sequence="51">t51] THE MEKILTA AND ITS TEXT 53 7. Where an emendation has been undertaken, that should be indicated both in notes and in variants. 8. Passages which the editor considers interpolations, but which have for centuries been cited as part of the book, should be retained but published in smaller type to differentiate them from the main text. This is more easily done in a midrashic text, which consists of fragmentary discussions, than in a continuous work, in which it would be necessary to delete the additions and print them separately on the margin or below the line.27 9. When biblical passages occur in the texts in a shortened form, while the rabbinic discussion implies the full citation, the editor may supply the missing part, but he should indicate in his variants that he has done so. 10. Where there is reason to believe that the text of the Scripture cited in the tannaitic work was different from that current in the usual biblical texts, the reading of the tannaitic work should naturally be retained in the main text. The deviation should be noted in the notes, and preferably also in the variants. Where, however, it is not clear that the original midrash contained a different reading from that current in modern biblical texts, the editor may accept the reading of the Ms. or printed edition which most closely approaches the ordinary biblical reading, and indicate the deviations in the variants. It will generally be found that the deviations from the usual biblical texts occur in the additions of late copyists, who completed the verses from memory or, more frequently, had to decipher the abbreviations of the verses which the older copyists used. 11. Since no text is uniform in its orthography, the editor may establish his own orthography,28 based preferably on what he considers the probable form used in the parent text, and 27 Some of the hearers objected to this rule, holding rather that interpolations should be taken out of the text, and published by themselves, either among the variants, or as separate notes. 28 The questions of orthography are of particular importance in making corrections of the texts. Thus on p. 6, line 13 (Lauterbach I, p. 15, line 3) we read:</page><page sequence="52">FINKELSTEIN adhere to it uniformly. It would be well if in the introduc- tion he indicated the various systems of orthography used by the various texts, and illustrated by copious examples, to help the future student of Hebrew orthography and grammar. 12. The editor has the right to determine which abbreviations he shall retain, and which he shall undertake to decipher. He must, however, be uniform in this, and indicate the rules by which he guides himself. 13. The editor should avoid inserting notes into the variants where they are likely to confuse the student, who sometimes cannot be sure whether the words are the editor's own or are transcribed from the Ms. The editor's remarks should, wherever possible, be put in parentheses or otherwise indi- cated as his own. 14. A study of the Mss. frequently shows that the division current in the printed texts is of late origin, and has little or no basis in authentic tradition.29 It is the editor's duty in such cases to substitute what he regards as the original division for that which is current in the printed text, but to supply also indications to the usual divisions by paren- thetical marks, and also by notes on the top of the page. This will help the student who finds references to the work, under the old division, to place the citation. As the sections into which rabbinic works are divided are usually very long, it is well to subdivide them further as far as possible. In books which refer to the Scriptures, like the tannaitic midrashim under discussion, the reference to the Bible should be supplied before each passage, and at the head of each page. .y a m v 3 I n K DRpD1n IN1 ?;WD ,rwpn3w ':-D Nw9tD In nr Ioit tNcpy 'I This statement does indeed sound too anthropomorphic for R. Akiba to whom it is attributed, and Horovitz with his genius for interpretation emends the spaced words to read yltKn 1i ~ . But the fact is that no emendation is necessary, for the word nm is omitted in practically all the sources, and for 15z Ms. Munich (:) reads i51i, which is an obvious error for 15'0. Now i'3, is the old Palestinian spelling of 15'7. Thus on p. 111, line 11, the Oxford Ms. (1) writes 15:, where the other texts have 19iX. So that the actual text of D, and not a mere emendation, provides us the excellent reading: irinnm yax3 1i'bro lpDPun. 29 This is flagrantly true of the Sifra (See Frankel, M.G.W.J. III 1854 p. 389); but it applies in a lesser degree also to the Sifre and the Mekilta. 54 [52]</page></plain_text>
