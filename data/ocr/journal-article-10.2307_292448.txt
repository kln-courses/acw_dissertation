(Publications de l'Institut d'Art et d'Archeologie de l'Universite de Paris, II.) Ancient writers were interested in the Tiber only as a casually prominent feature of the Roman landscape. They took the river and all its works much for granted. Modern students have by and large accepted their point of view. Their attention has turned Tiberward only as the river has been required to explain some point in the history, topography, or religion of the city. Yet alone of the great cities of the ancient Mediterranean Rome in its maturity was truly a river town. The Tiber was its differentia, its dominant physical and spiritual feature. It was the vital artery of supply and communications, the indispensable interior waterway, source of nourishment and purification, cause of delight and disaster. Rome in its youth, as it grew to overshadow its rivals in Latium, in Italy, and in the Mediterranean basin, grew in partnership with its river. In the two volumes under review J. Le Gall has courageously attempted to study the nature and history of this intimate relation- ship between Rome and its river from the standpoint of the river. " These principale" and "The.se supplementaire" examine two aspects of the central problem: the Tiber considered as a material factor in the history of Rome and envisaged as an immaterial force in the minds and emotions of the Roman people. The first is a study in historical geography, the second in the history of religion. Le Gall has had the advice and encouragement of his master, Jerome Carcopino, and the advantage of two sojourns in Rome. He has re-examined with a critical eye and, where possible, at first hand the chief primary sources of information on his subject-the passing references of ancient authors, the material remains of bridges, quays, and embankments, the objects dredged from the Tiber bed, the epigraphical and archaeological record of officials, collegia and individuals directly concerned with the river and its traffic-and has drawn into his net many others of less obvious cogency. These sources are scant at best and rarely unambiguous. Most of them are well rubbed and not likely to generate new light by further friction. Le Gall has not spared his efforts to tap others. He has put to use for the first time the " Verbali di consegna" of the Museo delle Terme, sole and barren record of the thousands of objects found in the construction of the Tiber embankments during the last quarter of the last century. He has made a searching re- vision of the inscriptions of the Curatores Riparum et Alvei Tiberis, which brings their roster up to date and gives us a lucid account of the history and functions of that institution. He has essayed to bring the terminology and the representation of river craft together in a reasonable and consistent manner, assigning likenesses to the lintres, scaphae, lenunculi, and naves caudicarii of the written record 329</page><page sequence="2">AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHILOLOGY. and names to the nondescript vessels of the pictured. He has called upon the modern disciplines of hydrography and urban geography to provide terms of comparison and classification for the ancient river and the ancient town. On this basis he sketches in a bold design. The Tiber figures as the least Mediterranean of Mediterranean streams, rolling an unfail- ingly abundant and navigable flood from the Nar to the sea, Rome as bridgehead citadel at an important crossroads, lowest bridgehead on the river, head of navigation, point of break-of-bulk. Their analogues are the great Atlantic rivers of northern Europe with their bridgehead and head-of-navigation cities-Bordeaux, London, Antwerp, Hamburg. Like them, as its needs expanded and its shipping grew more diversified, Rome spawned its river-mouth port, its lighter and barge services, its naval arsenals, its docks and ferries. The whole intricate mechanism of cooperation between river and metropolis in its maritime, regional, and local aspects came to be adjusted to Rome's imperial position and requirements. It could not survive the loss of empire. Causes independent of the Tiber left it unchanged, abandoned by the complex growth it had fostered. Meanwhile the men whose lives were so long and so closely bound up with the river revered its inexpressible power. This deep-rooted reverence resisted anthropomorphism and dramatization. Father Tiber remained a faceless, mythless numen, potent to heal and to purge by the direct action of his waters, receiving offerings directly into himself. His iconography is late and perfunctory. His cult was always one of primitive dynamism. In the detail of this design Le Gall's work with the scattered finds from the engineering operations of the last century and the boundary stones of the Curatores sometimes brings its reward. It serves to dispel the mirage of Lanciani's Augustan canalization of the Roman reaches of the Tiber and to demonstrate the gradual and partial process of the embanking during the late Republic and Empire. It shows, with interesting results for the history of the Pomerium, how Rome's waterway, like the highways radiating from its gates, was for considerable stretches lined with cemeteries. Analysis of the ex-votos collected from the bed of the river seems to prove the connection of at least some of them with the cult of the Tiber and possibly to localize some of its centers. More often the design accommodates the old perplexities unre- solved. Their ventilation fails either to produce persuasive new solutions or to lend new conviction to old. This is due in some measure to the knottiness of the problems themselves, insoluble in the absence of fresh evidence or fresh insight, in greater measure to defect of knowledge or imagination. The author's working bibliography, far from exhaustive in itself, is essentially that of 1938/1939, when he was beginning his studies in Rome. It is very summarily adjourned up only to 1950. He appears not to be conversant with much of the recent work which touches his subject. Thus, e. g., his terms of classification in urban geography seem to be those of Aurosseau. The basic French work of P. Lavedan, published in 1936, goes unacknowledged. He is unable to avail himself of Cozzo's Luogo primitivo di Roma (1935) 330</page><page sequence="3">for his investigations of the conditions of primitive river traffic. His efforts to classify and date construction are often embarrassed by his failure to use Marion Blake rather than Tenney Frank. His observations about the later phases of Ostia are made in ignorance of Becatti's fundamental work. This weakness is particularly glar- ing in his extremely schematic treatment of the prehistory of the Tiber, the site of Rome and the Sublician bridge. Little of the abundant recent writing on this subject is utilized. Even the pro- vocative syntheses of Altheim and Pareti receive no consideration, while the crucial study of Louise Adams Holland (T. A. P. A., LXXX [1949]) is passed over in silence. On the other hand, we find, for example, the old and capital enigma of the location of the Navalia approached with reassuring empiricism. Their function is trenchantly defined. An attempt is made to estimate their minimum extent on the analogy of the Athe- nian ship-sheds. A promising beginning, yet Le Gall concludes lamely by situating the Navalia, solely on an extremely dubious interpretation of the vague literary evidence, precisely where they cannot possibly have been, between Ponte Sisto and the Tiber Island, having chosen to disregard both the long southwestern side of the Campus Martius and the jetty of Tor di Nona, whose claims have been recently and cogently reasserted by Cressedi (Rend. Pont., XXV-XXVI [1949-1951]). We are similarly deceived, after a good deal of pointed comment on the actual process of towing, in the treatment of the venerable puzzle of the Tiber tow-paths. The author's deployment is merely a feint. In the same way, the asso- ciation with the cult of the Tiber of all the votive objects found in its bed gains only grudging assent, largely because the weighing of the other obvious possibilities has been scamped. These are perhaps the blemishes incidental to the all-embracing "these." " Nous avions pris un grand bateau," remarked Stendhal, "parce que le cours du Tibre dans Rome passe pour etre d'une navigation dangereuse." If Le Gall's boat occasionally goes aground, his navigation has explored new channels, improved some old ones, and opened some unsuspected perspectives. FRANK E. BROWN. YALE UNIVERSITY.
