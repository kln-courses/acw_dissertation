<plain_text><page sequence="1">S.B. Deo, ed., Excavations at Bhokardan (Bho gavardhana) 1973 (Nagpur, Nagpur University - Aurangabad, Marathwada University, 1974; XV (unnumbered), 235 pp., LXIII pis., 46 pp. numbered as figs.). This is a new book in the series started by the Nagpur University which I have already had the opportunity to deal with in an earlier number of this Journal {EW, XXIV, 1974, pp. 424-26). The director of the excavation reported and the editor of the volume itself is Prof. S.B. Deo, to whose strenuous activity most of the achieve? ments of the Nagpur University archaeological programme in the past years are due. The readiness in producing reports of their excavations is certainly one of the most praise? worthy aspects of the way of working of Prof. Deo and his staff. This time, too, the report appeared when one year from the excavation's end had hardly elapsed, but I am afraid that this 279</page><page sequence="2">time the usual readiness turned into what I cannot refrain from terming hastiness. This is probably due to the fact that the book under review consists of twelve chapters (and two appendixes), almost all of them written each by a different author (or couple of authors), while the chapters containing a synthesis and the conclusions (S.B. Deo, chap. Ill: ? Chronology ?; chap. XII: ?Resume?) appear to have been written on the basis of rough copies of the remaining chapters, which were later deeply modi? fied when sent to the press. But let me first introduce the site and the excavations. ? Bhokardan, ancient Bhogavardhana, ... is the headquarters of a taluq in the Aurangabad Dis? trict of Marathwada region of Maharashtra State ? (p. 1; O.P. Verma, chap. I: ?Bhokardan: His? torical Review?, pp. 1-5), between Ajant? and Aurang?b?d, on the ancient trade route that linked UjjayinI to Pratisth?na (Paith?n) and Tagara (Ter) towards the south, to N?sik and the towns of the Bombay region towards the west. That the inhabitants of Bhogavardhana were Buddhists (or, rather, that Buddhists were among them) in the time of the Sunga dynasty and later is documented by the Br?hml inscriptions from Bh?rhut and S?nci that record the names of pious donors from this town (p. 4), and that ?Bhoga vardan was later also an important centre of Brahmanical worship is corroborated by the dis? covery of a large rock-cut cave at Bhokardan in 1935 ? (p. 4); but little indeed was known of all the other aspects of life there, at least until the Rastrak?ta period. And it was for this reason that excavations were undertaken on four mounds in the vicinity of the modern town of Bho? kardan. A description of the mounds and the nature of stratification soils is given by Dr A.P. Jam khedkar in chap. II (?The Site, Strata and Structures?, pp. 6-16), which is fairly accurate, though I would suggest ? as I already did in the above-mentioned earlier review ? that local terms are explained at least the first time they appear in an excavation report, in order to make things understandable also to readers who are not altogether familiar with the everyday reality of India. For instance, chull? (Hindi: a particular type of fireplace), murum (Marathi: a sort of fissile gravel), kanker (Hindi: a coarse kind of limestone) may sound obscure to those whose field of research is not India proper, though they have very good reasons to read this report because Bhokardan has proved to be important for the study of ancient trade with the West, and for many other aspects also which take the researcher well beyond the local historico-geographical sphere of the Deccan. ?The chronology of Bhokardan could be broadly arrived at on the basis of the following data: (a) Coins, seals and bullae, (b) Pottery, (c) Datable bead types, (d) Stone objects like rotary querns, (e) Polichrome glass bangles and glazed pottery? (p. 17; S.B. Deo, ?Chronology?, pp. 17-18), and the following periodization is set forth: Period la (layers (6) and @): early or pre S?tav?hana (c. 3rd-2nd century B.C.); Period lb (layers @ and (3)): S?tav?hana-Ksa trapa (c. 1st century B.C. to 2nd-3rd A.D. Period II (layers @ and 0): post-S?tav?hana to early mediaeval (c. 3rd century A.D. onwards). Let me first say that this succession appears to be more or less reasonable, notwithstanding some inaccuracies which induce one to be careful in examining the whole archaeological picture as it is presented by the authors. Prof. Deo writes (p. 17): ? Though the Black and-Red pottery of the early historic period was more abundant in lower layers, the Red Polished Ware, the amphora and the Megaron [sic, for "Megarian"] ware were solely restricted to layers 3 and 4. These were completely absent in layers 5 and 6 ...?. On the contrary, from chap. V (T.V. Pathy, ?Pottery?, pp. 82-117) we learn that: (a) (imitations of) Megarian bowls are re? presented by two fragments of Red Polished Ware (RPW), one from layer (3) (though apparently from (4), according to the headings: p. 89, type 35A), but the other from layer @ (p. 109, type 130); (b) the RPW is represented by 11 sherds from layer 0 (pp. 88-89) and 31 sherds from (3) (pp. 100-101), i.e. 42 sherds from Period lb, but also by 52 sherds from layer @ (pp. 109-10) and 35 from 0 (pp. 114-15), i.e. 87 sherds from Period II; (c) one single sherd of an amphora was found from @ (p. 101), none from @, one from 0 (p. 115; according to the heading, but provenance indicated as (?) presumably due to a misprint). Concerning the RPW one could perhaps suppose that 87 sherds are less than 42 if percent values are considered; but this does not seem to apply to the present circumstance, since Pathy writes at p. 109 that the presence of 52 sherds of RPW in layer @ ? as against 31 sherds in the previous horizon [i.e., layer @]... suggests that this ware was more in use in the upper strata of this single culture site?. As a matter of fact, the RPW, which has been discovered from many sites in India (e.g., Barod?, Timbarv?, Vadnagar, Mahesvar, etc.), is usually associated with finds datable in the early 280</page><page sequence="3">centuries of our era. This is indeed the most obscure side of Bhokardan's chronology. Should we then take Pathy's words in the particular sense that the chronological distribution of this ware at Bhokardan finds no parallel in other West Indian sites as described in excavation reports? If this is the excavators' opinion, why has not Deo taken the opportunity of suggesting that the dating of the RPW in West India might be revised in the light of the new evidence from Bhokardan? Similar inconsistencies are also to be pointed out concerning the distribution of the terracotta bullae which are found only in Period lb according to Deo (p. 18) and, according to A.M. Shastri (p. 75; chap. IV: ?Coins, Bullae and Seals?, pp. 19-81), ? have been found in the latest layers which have also yielded late S?tav?hana and Ksa trapa coins ?, This means, we are led to believe, that the majority of the bullae were found from layer (3), which has yielded four out of the five stratified Ksatrapa coins recovered at Bhokardan; on the contrary, the descriptive notes of chap. IV show that out of the six bullae found, two are from layer (2), one from 0, two are unstratified, and only one actually comes from layer (3) (pp. 75-76). But I do not wish to linger upon these in? consistencies any more. Let us rather quickly survey the classes of objects that are dealt with in the various chapters. A very interesting find is that of two frag? mentary pottery coin moulds, one of them, un? identifiable, from layer (5), the other, for casting Ksatrapa coins, from 0 (pp. 73-74). ?It is interesting to note that the coins ? which could be obtained from the former mould ?were not all of the same shape and type?. Moulds for casting coins have been in use both in the West and in India in different periods and only in a few cases is it sure that they were employed by official ateliers; it is anyhow far from being well grounded to say that the finding of the mould from layer (5) ? clearly indicates that during the earliest period of its history Bhokardan had a mint ? since it is possible that (a) such moulds were used by false-moneyers, or (b) if they were employed by more or less official authorities, their use may have been made necessary by the very circumstance that no mint (i.e., no place where coins were struck) was available at Bhokardan. The same is true for the other mould which, ? whether fake or genuine [?!] ?, cannot indicate ?that Ksatrapa coins were locally minted at Bhokardan? (p. 74). The terracotta bullae ? were all prepared from moulds, perhaps locally?, according to Dr Shas? tri, and ? are imitated from the aurei or denarii of the Roman emperor Tiberius (died 37 A.D.) with a somewhat indigenous version of the royal bust on the obverse and of Livia as Pax on the reverse ? (pp. 74-75). It is more difficult to share the opinion of Prof. Deo (p. 211) that the bullae from Bhokardan are imitated from Roman bullae imported by trading caravans along with Roman pottery and wine. It is also surprising that Prof. Deo speaks {ibid.) of ? scores of terracotta imi? tations of Roman bullae ?, while they appear to be six only. I have nothing to add concerning the chapter on pottery. I would only point out that it is merely descriptive, without any attempt at a precise framing of Bhokardan in the general picture of pottery production in ancient India. Quantities are sometimes indicated in absolute numbers, sometimes in terms of approximate evaluation (e.g., ? maximum in bulk ?, ? next comes ?, ? much less in quantity ?, etc.). The absence of a tabu? lation is badly felt. The great quantity of beads found both in the trenches and from surface exploration leads S.B. Deo (chap. VI: ?Beads?, pp. 118-42) to the very reasonable conclusion that ?Bhokardan ... had a flourishing bead making industry during the late S?tav?hana-Ksatrapa period?. The ma? terials employed are chiefly glass, shell and faience, but also carnelian, crystal, agate, chalcedony, jas? per, ivory, opal, etc. Prof. Deo seems to be at his best here: the chapter is rich in tabulated information, bibliographical references and very clear though much simplified drawings; it will remain a very useful source of information and meaningful references. Among the terracotta objects (G.B. Deglur kar, chap. VII: ? Terracotta and Kaolin Objects ?, pp. 143-72) we must at least point out the presence of a fragment of an anthropomorphic pot similar in shape to the famous "kinnari-pol? from Begr?m, that Dr Deglurkar seems to know only from B. Rowland, The Art of Afghanistan, while the type has been studied by R.C. Agrawala (Human Figurines on Pottery Handles from India and Allied Problems, Baroda, 1970; ?Yakshi or Kinnari Pot from Begram?, in A. Guha, ed., Central Asia. Movement of Peoples and Ideas from Times Prehistoric to Modern, New York, 1971, pp. 130-38; both with earlier bibliography; ? also Deo, p. 214, ignores Agrawala's contributions). A careful catalogue of iron, copper and lead objects is given by A.P. Jamkhedkar in chap. VIII (?Metal Objects?, pp. 173-85), including useful references in notes at the end. As Prof. Deo himself suggests (p. 215), if one looks ?to the abundance of ivory objects, both finished and unfinished, and the recovery of ivory pieces, it may be logical to propose that 281</page><page sequence="4">Bhokardan? was ?a centre of ivory-carving?. From the point of view of art history, the hypo? thesis (that will almost certainly find confirmation in further excavations at Bhokardan) is of enor? mous importance, because the fragment of ?a beautiful ivory statuette of a female, which formed possibly the handle of a mirror ? (p. 188), found from layer (3), closely resembles both in subject and style the ivory figurine from Pompeii (G.B. Deglurkar, O.P. Verma, chap. IX: ? Ivory, Bone and Shell Objects ?, pp. 186-96). I am not able to state whether the Bho? kardan ivory is of such high workmanship as ? to outbeat the other ivories so far known from Pompeii and Ter ?, as Deglurkar writes (pp. 189 90) and Deo confirms (p. 215), since I know the Bhokardan ivory only from the photographs and drawings published here, but if we compare photo? graph with photograph (I try my best to forget the impression of beauty I received when I first saw the Pompeii figurine), we are almost led to believe that the Bhokardan and the Pompeii ivories are not only of the same quality standard (the one from Pompeii is better preserved) but also were produced by the same atelier! If the Bhokardan ivory may tell us a lot from the point of view of the region in which such objects were produced (if we accept the hypothesis that not only was Bhokardan a centre of ivory carving but the handle itself was made at Bho? kardan ? which is reasonable though not certain), I cannot share the opinion of Deglurkar and Deo that our statuette gives us better information concerning chronology than the Pompeii specimen. Indeed, Period lb, to which the Bhokardan ivory belongs, covers a span of time from c. 1st century B.C. to 3rd century A.D., while in the case of the Pompeii statuette we have a much more precise terminus ante quern in the year 79 A.D. (it is difficult to imagine a more precise terminus than this provided by the famous eruption of Mt Vesuvius!); as far as a terminus post quern is concerned, all the Bhokardan ivory does is confirm a dating already obtained through com? parisons with other sculptures and still rather approximate, anyhow. Nor can I share the opinion of Dr Deglurkar, when he states that ?this ivory would help to decide not only the date of the Ter statuette but also its indigenous character? (p. 190), because the differences in style between the two ivories are neither few nor slight; and I don't see how Prof. Deo can think that the Bhokardan ivory is slightly earlier than the Pompeii and Ter statuettes (p. 215), as though these latter could be considered together from the point of view of style. But what is more surprising is that the authors of this report ignore most of the bibliography (both old and recent) on Indian ivory carving (J.L. Davidson's contributions being especially noteworthy among the most recent ones; ? but on the Ter ivory one would legitimately expect that not only Moti Chandra's article in the Bom? bay Museum Bulletin be quoted, but also be taken into consideration Moti Chandra's article in Lalit Kala no. 8 and the important comments by M.N. Deshpande and D. Barrett in Lalit Kala no. 10) and ? what is worse ? seem to believe that early Indian ivory statuettes are represented only by the Pompeii, Ter and Bhokardan specimens, while ? as it is well known ? the main bulk of such ivories is constituted by the Begr?m find. Dr O.P. Verma describes the bangles and other objects of glass (chap. X: ? Glass Objects ?, pp. 197-201); G.B. Deglurkar and A.P. Jam khedkar the sculptures, querns and other objects of stone (chap. XI: ? Stone Objects ?, pp. 202 9), among which two plaques depicting L?j?gauri (the "shameless goddess") could be particularly significant for a reconstruction of the later religious environment at Bhogavardhana (5th-6th century A.D.). The ? Resume ? by Deo is followed by Appen? dix A, by M.D. Kajale, ?Plant Economy at Bhokardan?, pp. 217-24, and Appendix B, by Dr V.V. Rao, ?Bone Remains from Bhokardan Excavations?, pp. 225-33. The importance of such reports in the publication of archaeological excavations can hardly be overemphasized. Let us take note here of the fact ?that people of Bhokardan cultivated [or made use of] four cereals and seven legumes ?, the most important being a legume, ?Pigeon Pea, Cajanus cajan Milsp. It is the first archaeological report of the species from India? (p. 222). In Dr Rao's report on bone remains I would point out the tendency to far-fetched conclusions: e.g. ? Elephant evidence as a rarity in the collec? tion suggests that it was primarily used as a royal transport? (p. 233); ?Attit?de of cow veneration among inhabitants was a possibility? {ibid.); etc. An important conclusion is that ? food consumption of meat, pork, "murga" [chick? en], veal [Bos indicus Linn.] or venison is drawn as an inference due to signs of charring and cut marks on remains of such species? (ibid.). It is unfortunate that many sentences in Dr Rao's report cannot be fully understood, either because of an insufficient mastering of the English language by the author or due to the presence of a great deal of misprints in this part of the book. A book that, notwithstanding some defects, marks a valuable addition to the knowledge of the ancient history of Western India. Maurizio Taddei 282</page></plain_text>
