<plain_text><page sequence="1">LITERARY CRITICISM AND LATIN POETRY Judith Perkins T X HOSE WHO BELIEVE LATIN literature should stay in the public domain will greet Quality and Pleasure in Latin Poetry with relief.1 This collection of essays by eight distinguished Latinists is a work of literary criticism?an event whose rarity in Latin scholarship might surprise our colleagues in other litera tures. They have understood better than we have what Eliot meant when he said that "the important moment for the appearance of criticism seems to be the time when poetry ceases to be the expression of the whole people." Eliot felt that the traditional ties binding Euro pean mankind into a cultural unity had been cut by the technological and sociological crises of the nineteenth century. Without this common culture and taste, he be lieved a considerable portion of twentieth-century man kind had lost the ability to apprehend and appreciate literature without some sort of critical intervention. The tradition which came apart was essentially the classical, specifically the tradition of Latin literature, the basis of European literature. And the suggestion that twentieth-century man might also need a certain amount of critical mediation to continue to react and respond to what is of value in Latin literature would seem an obvi ous corollary to Eliot's remark. In fact, empirical evi dence in this case vindicates Eliot's contention. For as professional Latinists have adamantly refused to perform a critical function, Latin literature has steadily lost its audience. It is an easy prediction now that, if Latinists continue to undervalue criticism as they have, a litera Tony Woodman and David West, eds., Quality and Pleasure in Latin Poetry (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1974), viii + 166 pp. $11.95.</page><page sequence="2">Judith Perkins 115 ture which was a common heritage at the beginning of the century will be the domain of a few scholarly ex perts at the end. In this book the work of six Latin authors (Lucretius, Catullus, Propertius, Tibullus, Virgil, Horace) is ex amined according to the tenets of New Critical formal ism. Lest the various authors object to this classification it is perhaps enough to say that implicit in all the essays is a belief in the poetic work as a coherent structure which can become better understood and valued through the analysis of the various explicit and implicit patterns and relationships forming it. The methodology of new criticism is now no longer new (being at least forty years old) nor is it as definitive as its proponents once thought. Yet its critical procedures are a welcome replacement for the non-critical or very primitive critical approach of many classicists. Indeed, most of the essays are excellent examples of the value of this kind of approach. E. J. Kenney examines the opening of De Rerum Na tura (1.62-101), the achievement of Epicurus and the sacrifice of Iphigeneia. These lines have traditionally affected readers, and Mr. Kenney traces in a sentence by sentence analysis the various formal relationships which contribute to their effect. For an example of his method, and an idea of its scope: In v. 72 the sortie, so to say, takes off; force and speed are imparted by the rhythm, with diaeresis after both first and second feet and consequent coin cidence of verse ictus and word-accent, reinforced by repeated T-sounds and alliteration of consonantal u: ?rgo muida ms animi per-mcit. . . . The uis animi of Epicurus, thus launched on its course (enjambment of w. 72-3 extra / processif), escapes "the flaming ramparts of the world," the fiery envelope that ac cording to Epicurean cosmology surrounds the world (5.457-70); it transcends, that is to say, the physical limits of our own mundus and wanders unchecked through the entire universe. The sequence of verbs peruicit . . . processif . . . peragrauit, with their al literative prefixes, leads up to the climactic oxymoron of immensum peragrauit, which connotes the magni tude of Epicurus' achievement?he has in fact per</page><page sequence="3">116 LITERARY CRITICISM AND LATIN POETRY formed the impossible; and the emphatic (not tautol ogous; so, rightly, Giussani [1921] and Bailey [1947]) mente animoque repeats and reinforces the idea of uiuida uis animi from which the sentence began, (p. 23) And Kenney looks beyond the sentence to more inclusive patterns. He points, for example, to the effect of the ring composition in the first section (62-79) with its inverted imagery?man is depicted first as groveling below religio which towers above him, but at the end of the verse para graph their positions are reversed (uicissim) and man is erect and religio down (pedibus subiecta . . . obteritur p. 24). This essay seems to me the best sort of formal criticism. The relations and patterns the critic notices are irre futably there, once they are pointed out. Yet although the analysis is true, it is not obvious. The effect of the lines is difficult to trace, arising as it does from a combi nation of many intricate formal relationships, including meter, vocabulary, grammar, and imagery. The critic through his success in tracing the formal patterns simul taneously reveals the conceptual patterns imbedded in them and enlarges our response to the poetry. David West's gracefully written essay is equally suc cessful. He considers the tale of the country and city mouse from Horace's Satires (2.6.77-117) and shows how, rather than the simple fable it has been taken for, it is, in fact, a humorous microcosm of the moral dialectic between city and country, satisfaction and dissatisfac tion, the subject of the Satire proper. West describes the tale as an anthropomorphic joke woven from strands of dietetic, philosophic, and literary wit. And in a close analysis of vocabulary, he does what is perhaps one of the hardest of tasks, he explains the joke. He shows how each small detail of the scene ( even including the items enumerated in the menu) contributes to building the anthropomorphic characterization of the mice. Once this is established, West suggests Horace's use of pseudo philosophic dialogue and mock-heroic convention stresses not only the philosophic and literary pretensions of the mice but also of the men they reflect.</page><page sequence="4">Judith Perkins 117 West, like Kenney, illuminates the text he considers by his close reading.2 These essays, along with R. O. A. M. Lyne's on the ending of Georgics 1 and Tony Woodman's on Ode 3.30 of Horace, are the best in the collection. Francis Cairns, Gordon Williams, and Guy Lee each contribute useful papers, though they are perhaps better suited to the student than the scholar. Having welcomed and praised this book I must now turn to an aspect of it which troubles me. I sense the trouble arises more from the place ( or absence ) of criti cism in Latin studies, than from any real omission on the part of the authors. In this collection, obviously criti cal in nature and design, there appears nevertheless a cer tain naivete concerning the real state of contemporary critical theory. It can be seen, for example, in the mis understanding running through the book about the use of historical evidence in criticism, voiced most strongly in John Bramble's apologia for his comparison of Apol lonius' and Theocritus' Hylas episodes to that of Proper tius: Latter-day adherents of the New Criticism of the thirties, with their fond belief that a blank mind fac ing an anonymous text will register impressions of value, will no doubt disapprove of the invocation of extrinsic criteria. All I can say is that I am happy to have my response prejudiced by historical considera tions, believing as I do that mortal texts cannot be analysed according to immortal principles, (pp. 82-3) This gibe has simply no target. While it may be true that the earliest adherents of New Criticism claimed too much independence for the text, later theoretical works soon remedied this. In the seminal statement for the use of historical and biographical evidence in criticism, "The Intentional Fallacy" (1946), W. K. Wimsatt did warn against its misuse?but nowhere is a "blank mind" called for. In fact, Wimsatt explicitly includes works of litera ture, such as Bramble wishes to use ( as well as "all" that contributes to a culture) as valid evidence for the read ing of a text. Wimsatt and other formalists simply pro</page><page sequence="5">118 LITERARY CRITICISM AND LATIN POETRY posed that a poem, after cultural and literary evidence has been assimilated, should provide through its own co herence an adequate reading. External evidence is barred, that is, private idiosyncratic evidence, for the meaning of a poem. Gordon Williams offers this sort of evidence when he suggests the "meaning" of Eclogue 4 rests in the identifi cation of the child as either the putative son of Antony and Octavia or of Octavian and Scribonia (pp. 44-5). The ontological critics' prohibition seems valid here: the identity of the child might interest the curious, but it is not an important critical question, and his identity would add little to our reading of the poem. It might, in fact, diminish it. The child's characterization is function ally sufficient. And the meaning of the poem must surely lie in the total experience the poem has provided readers for generations, an experience Mr. Williams' commen tary on the whole helps to define. John Bramble completely invalidates his reading of Propertius 1.20 through his misuse of external evidence. He wishes to propose a novel interpretation of lines 33-42: hie erat Arganthi Pege sub uertice montis grata domus Nymphis umida Thyniasin, quam supra nullae pendebant debita curae roscida desertis poma sub arboribus, et circum irriguo surgebant lilia prato candida purpureis mixta papaueribus. quae modo decerpens tenero pueriliter ungui proposito florem praetulit officio, et modo formosis incumbens nescius undis errorem bland?s tard?t imaginibus. Bramble suggests that Propertius portrays Hylas not as an innocent, as has been believed, but rather as a youth partially responsible for his own seduction. He bases his reading on the latent associations of certain terms in the section. Now it is a basic assumption of formalist criticism that a certain tension can and often does result when words enter into the formal order of poetry. And this tension, produced by the pressure of poetic struc</page><page sequence="6">Judith Perkins 119 ture, meter, and devices, at times permits a reader's recognition of the multilayered significance of certain terms. In fact much of poetry's power is seen in this po etic ambiguity. But the ambiguity is not arbitrary. As Josephine Miles pointed out decades ago ("More Seman tics of Poetry," Kenyon Review, 1940), this capacity for polysemy does not make poetic language any less de pendent on context than ordinary language. Only in poetry it is the poetic structure acting as context (at times a more intensely significant one than that of ordinary lan guage) which will determine and restrict a term's asso ciations. I do not believe that the poetic structure of Propertius 1.20 supports Bramble's reading, nor does he even look to it for support. Look for a moment at Bramble's argument. He sum marizes his analysis of lines 33-42 thus: Propertius has carefully represented Hylas as more in terested in the flowers than in his 'duty,' and de lineated his narcissistic fascination with his own ap pearance, introducing erotic colour to remind the reader of the dangers besetting Gallus' affair, (p. 90) Bramble placed "duty" in single quotation marks to un derline his belief that the word officio (40) carries latent associations of eroticism. He points out that the word has been used to denote a "sexual favour" ( Ovid, Amores 1.10.45-6; 3.7.23-4, p. 90), and sees its use here as a suggestion that "Hylas neglects his obligation to his lover" (p. 90). Bramble traces this neglect to the boy's narcissism, first alluded to, in his view, by the word flor em (40): "Given the frequency of fios iuuentutis and similar expressions in Latin, it is tempting to infer that Hylas is portrayed as so involved with his own pretty face that he disappoints the hopes of his master" (p. 90). Moreover, Bramble suggests this narcissism is repre sented as a "sexual deviation" (p. 91) by the use of the word error em (42), which carries "an insinuation that the youth is perverse in his self-admiration. For error can be used of the mental derangement induced by love: witness, for example, Virgil, Eclogue 8.41 . . . , Ovid,</page><page sequence="7">120 LITERARY CRITICISM AND LATIN POETRY Amores 1.2.35 . . . , 1.10.9 . . . and Metamorphoses 10.342 ..." (p. 91). Finally Bramble concludes with the suggestion that Propertius prepared for this erotic reading by the ominous nature of lines 34-35, where "cura can denote the lover's object of concern?the be loved (Amores 1.3.15-16, Horace Odes 2.8.8) . . . Pro pertius' fruit 'owes nothing to any object of concern.' On an amatory interpretation of curae the implication is that the fruit is free from all 'attachments' " (p. 92). This last sentence shows the weakness of Bramble's method. Why does the word curae warrant an "amatory interpretation"? What poetic highlighting of the term would cause us to remember that the word sometimes appears in amatory contexts? None that I can see. The term here appears in a traditional agricultural context, and there is no support from the surrounding structure or imagery to suggest that it carries or includes a denota tion different from the one it usually does in such con texts. Similarly officio has in the poem a specific referent: raram sepositi quaerere fontis aquam (24), as does florem: Mia .../... mixta papaueribus (37-8), and nothing in the text implies their plurisignificance.3 Hylas neglects his duty to his master, not his obligation to his lover. He is seduced from his task by the beauty of na ture, not his own. Errorem refers to the boy's aimless delay (as Bramble notes) rather than his sexual devia tion. Mr. Bramble looks outside the poem for the author ity for his reading, basing it on extrinsic usages of the words. But simply because a word can denote something or is used by Ovid or Virgil in a certain way does not mean that it will always and everywhere call this usage to mind. The "Intentional Fallacy" and "More Semantics of Poetry" have been invoked here not to enforce some sort of critical orthodoxy, but simply because I believe that Williams, Bramble, and Lee (where he uses Tibullus 1.1 as simple biography) would have done a better criti cal job if they had heeded these discussions. It is there fore distressing to discover in the epilogue's opening</page><page sequence="8">Judith Perkins 121 paragraph an implicit disdain for works of critical theory and methodology: The contributors to this book are practising Latinists. Most of them, as far as the editors are aware, have no specialist knowledge of the recent history of literary criticism. The twentieth century has seen an explosion of theories, methods and controversies in this field. It may be useful in this epilogue to review these essays, written as they are in all innocence, to see how Latin scholarship has been affected by these developments, (p. 129) If these were essays in Latin philology or philosophy or history, it is doubtful if the authors' "innocence" of "specialist knowledge" would be considered anything but culpable. Yet the place of criticism among Latinists is such that an ignorance of formal method is a reference for good character. This really will not do. If Latinists are going to write criticism, if criticism is to become a legitimate division of Latin scholarship, then it must be approached with the same preparation and rigor as the other divisions. Classicists must begin to profit from their modern language colleagues' theoretical and methodo logical struggles to confront the literary work?which now of course extend far beyond the boundaries of (the once) New Criticism. And while formalism has and will continue to make a genuine contribution to our knowledge of literary forms, as the best of these essays have demonstrated, there are new trends in contemporary criticism. Not that it is impor tant in all cases to be among the avant-garde or f addishly up to date. But criticism's worth is in its mediating agency. It defines for a particular generation the value of the literary experience. Works of literature endure whereas works of criticism, most often, do not. This fact, usually uttered as a reproach, in truth defines criticism's function. Different generations value works of literature for differ ent reasons. We perceive what we need to perceive as Ihab Hassan has pointed out. Contemporary criticism will undoubtedly not abandon</page><page sequence="9">122 LITERARY CRITICISM AND LATIN POETRY its perception of literary form, unified and organic, val ued for its coherence and harmony. But our generation is not quite content with this. There is a sense that for malism overobjectified the work of art, insisted too strongly on its formal properties to the detriment of its human ones. Responses to this problem have come from every side. Certain continental critics are now examin ing literature not as an object but as a mode of conscious ness, with which the critic identifies, and liberates through his criticism, while others attempt to recover the historical sense implicit in a work, a sense they define as a function of its period or civilization. Structuralists consider the work as an example of significant language, of signs used in a special way, revealing innate human patterns. These and other current trends are certainly not definitive, but they testify to the diversity and vigor with which our colleagues are attempting to fix for their con temporaries value in literature. Can we who have been entrusted with Latin literature do less, and still lament that our authors are losing their readers? NOTES 1 Included are essays by Francis Cairns, E. J. Kenney, Gordon Williams, R. O. A. M. Lyne, David West, John Bramble, Guy Lee, and Tony Woodman. 2 I don't quite see the point of West's short consideration of Robert Henryson's rendition of the fable, except, perhaps, as a vehicle for sexist comments: "We are reading a comedy of man ners, of feminine manners. Gone are the urbanity, the philosophy, the literary play, the wit of male conversation," etc. (p. 80). 3 Compare Virgil's use of the flower image at the death of Euryalus (9.435-36). In this context the use of flos does call up associations of youth, beauty, and freshness.</page></plain_text>
