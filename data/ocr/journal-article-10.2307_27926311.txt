NUMBER 4 ? 1993 Beth Shean in the Iron Age: Preliminary Report and Conclusions of the 1990-1991 Excavations* Amihai Mazar The Hebrew University of Jerusalem INTRODUCTION Since the end of the University of Pennsylvania's excavations at Tel Beth Shean in 1933, the Iron Age occupation layers and tombs at this site have been an important issue in the study of the period. The finds in Strata VI-V ? including the temples, public structures, unique cult objects and Egyptian monuments and inscriptions, as well as the rich finds in the Northern Cemetery, which contained fragments of over 50 anthropoid clay coffins ? are some of the richest archaeological assemblages of the period. A correct understanding of the archaeological history of Beth Shean during the Iron Age is essential for the understanding of the cultural processes of the period. Many problems in the interpretation of these excavations, however, remain open, due to the difficulty of excavating a site with many building phases of mudbrick walls disturbed by later pits and building activity, as well as the poor quality of the earlier field work.1 The major problems related to our subject are the following: * What was the nature of the city's culture during the time of the Twentieth Dynasty, and what was Beth Shean's fate after the decline of Egyptian rule in Canaan? * What occupation layer(s) are contemporary with the anthropoid coffin burials, and what is the ethnic identity of those buried in these coffins? * The Hebrew version of this article appeared in El 24 (1993), pp. 130-147. 1 A.

Yigael Yadin and Shulamit Geva attempted to shed light on some of these problems in a short season of excavations in 1983 on the summit of the tell, near its south-eastern corner. These excavations, which were published remarkably swiftly, concentrated on the Iron Age I strata.2 They provided a guideline for our excavations in Area S, which to a large extent are the direct continuation of the 1983 excavations. However, we propose a different interpretation of some of the conclusions reached by Yadin and Geva (see below, pp. 227-228). THE RENEWED EXCAVATIONS During three seasons of excavations at Beth Shean carried out in 1990-1991, we examined the Iron Age I strata in an area designated 'Area S\ The results of these seasons shed new light on the previous excavations. This article includes a preliminary report on these seasons and a discussion of their implications regarding the previous excavations.3 2 Y. Yadin and Shulamit Geva: Investigations at Beth Shean, The Early Iron Age Strata (Qedem 23), Jerusalem, 1986. 3 The excavations at Tel Beth Shean are directed by the author, on behalf of the Institute of Archaeology of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. They were carried out in the framework of the Beth Shean Archaeological Expedition, which is sponsored by the Israel Antiquities Authority and the Beth Shean Tourist Development Authority. The directors of the united expedition are Prof. Yoram Tzafrir, Prof. Gideon Foerster and Gabi Mazor. Part of the research is sponsored by the Philip and Muriel Berman Center of Biblical Archaeology at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. The excavations in Area S, which provide the basis for the present article, were conducted in the winter of 1990 (staff: R. Belamy, G. Gilmour and E. Asaf); the autumn of 1990 (staff: Nava Panitz-Cohen, R. Belamy) and the autumn of 1991 (staff: Nava Panitz-Cohen and Y. Rand, assisted by A. Cohen and D. Weinblatt). The plans were prepared by B. Arubas and R. Saban. Photographs were taken by G. Laron and the author. Pottery restoration: O. Mazar; pottery drawing: A. Boaz and J. Yaroshevits. In the last two seasons, groups of students of the School of Overseas Students of the Hebrew University participated under the guidance of Ann Killebrew. Groups of students of the American Institute of Holy Land Studies also took part in each of these seasons. For a preliminary report on the excavation of Area R, see A. Mazar: The Excavations at Tel Beth-Shean in 1989-1990, EI2\ (1990), pp. 197-211 (Hebrew); the English version appeared in Biblical Archaeology Today, Jerusalem 1993, pp. 606-619.

The area is bordered on the south and west by cliffs created by the previous excavations, and on the east by a steep slope separating the summit from a lower eastern terrace. The excavation of this area commenced in the winter of 1990 as a 5 25 m. trench (Squares Y-Z-A-B-C 7). In the following two seasons the area was extended, and incorporated Yadin's and Geva's excavation area. By the end of the 1991 season Area S included 525 m.2, 100 m.2 of which had been excavated by Yadin and Fig. 1.

Left: Area S; bottom right: Building 1500. Geva. The University of Pennsylvania's excavations removed in this area the entire remains of Stratum IV and almost all the remains of Stratum V, except for a few stone foundations. Only in the south-eastern corner of the area was part of a large building of Stratum V better preserved. Our excavation reached the floors of Stratum Lower VI (our Stratum S-3) in almost the entire area. Thanks to a strategy of excavating a large area, we managed to uncover sufficient structural remains and floor levels to make possible a reconstruction of the settlement history of this area during the twelfth-tenth centuries B.C.E. In order to prevent confusion with the previous excavations, we decided to retain a separate numbering system for each of the excavation areas. Table 1 represents the various strata and phases identified in our excavation and their tentative correlations with the previous excavations. The correlations should, however, be taken cautiously because of the problems involved in the attribution of various structures found by the University of Pennsylvania to their Strata Upper VI and Lower V. Difficulties in correlation to Yadin's and Geva's stratigraphy are due to our different interpretation of their Strata 1-3 (see below, pp. 227-228). Stratum S-3 (- Lower VI) (Figs. 3, 4) The well-preserved structural remains of Stratum S-3 in Area S include portions of at least four large buildings located along two streets intersecting at right angles.4 4 The streets and three of the buildings were identified by Yadin and Geva (their Stratum 4), but only limited parts were excavated.</page><page sequence="5">BETH SHEAN IN THE IRON AGE Table 1.

In several cases we observed two constructional phases, which are represented by floor raisings, the construction of new installations and, in one case, an addition of new rooms. The original construction phase was designated S-3B, while the secondary one was termed S-3A. At the end of the later phase the houses were destroyed by a heavy fire, in some parts of the area intense enough to burn the outer part of the brick walls, making them hard and red. Layers of burnt bricks and black ash covered the beaten earth floors. In some of the rooms, however, no evidence of fire was found, although thick deposits of fallen bricks filled them. This is probably due to differences in construction technique and /or function of the various rooms: those which contained much timber and combustible materials ? like olive oil stored in jars ? were heavily burnt.</page><page sequence="7">BETH SHEAN IN THE IRON AGE 207 The Western Building (78733) (Fig. 5). Only part of a large, elongated, rectangular hall (inner dimensions: 2.1 8.1 m.) was preserved of this building. The 1.2 m. thick walls are evidence that this was a massive building, probably two storeys high. In the northern half of the room, poor foundations of a Stratum S-2 installation or dwelling penetrated into the destruction debris of S-3. In the southern part of the hall, however, the undisturbed destruction debris is over 1 m. thick, containing many burnt timber beams, fragments of at least two large kraters, and an interesting group of prestigious items, evidence of the inhabitants9 high status. The objects included a scarab, several 'bottle-shaped' cornelian and glass beads and many pieces of thin gold leaves. An outstanding object from this room is the gold plating (Fig. 6) of a wooden object shaped like a ram's head (few, tiny pieces of wood survived). Even though the object was distorted in the destruction, the ram's face and curved horns are easily discernable; the empty holes for the eyes were presumably inlaid with semi-precious stones. The object is probably an Egyptian craft work, recalling Egyptian gold-plated ivory and wooden objects. We may assume that only high-ranking officials or merchants could afford such objects. The area to the west of our building was excavated by the University of Pennsyl vania, and in their plan it appears as a large empty space. We suppose that this area was Fig. 5. Room 78733 (Stratum S-3), view to the south.</page><page sequence="8">208 AMIHAI MAZAR disturbed by the continuation of the huge Byzantine pit, the eastern end of which was found by us (see the reconstruction of the pit in Fig. 4). We suggest that the large building 1096, 1094, etc., which was attributed by James to Stratum Upper VI, belongs in fact to Stratum Lower VI (as there are no remains attributed to Lower VI below it) and is part of our bui' Jing, as can be judged from the orientation and thickness of the walls.5 It is likely chat this large building was part of an Egyptian administration building or a residency during the time of the Twentieth Dynasty. Fig. 6. The gold plating of a wooden object shaped like a ram's head, from Stratum S-3. Another architectural space (88704) was uncovered south of this room. It measures 4 4.5 m; its beaten earth and lime floor was covered by a thick layer of fallen bricks with no evidence of fire. A human skeleton was uncovered in this layer. In the southern part of this space, a cylindrical container, made of unfired clay, was preserved to its rim.6 Since the eastern wall of this space is not in line with the eastern wall of the previous building, this space is apparently part of another building, to which perhaps Room 1207 of the University of Pennsylvania's excavations belongs. If so, our room is part of a large building located east of the Stratum VI temple. Street 78740. The street east of these two structures was exposed along 18 m.; its width varies from 1.9 to 2.35 m. In a number of sections cut in this street we 5 See James (above, n. 1), p. 21, and plan, Fig. 77. In Locus 1096 a fragment of an inscribed Egyptian door jamb and a fragmentary T-shaped door-sill were found; James raised the possibility that the building should be attributed to Lower VI. 6 See Yadin and Geva (above, n. 2), p. 50, for a similar installation.</page><page sequence="9">BETH SHEAN IN THE IRON AGE 209 found horizontal deposits of grey earth mixed with ash, containing many animal bones and pottery sherds. The 1 m. thick deposits indicate a substantial duration for this stratum ? probably several decades ? during which refuse and ash accumulated in the street. This street is a northern continuation of Street 1203 of the University of Pennsylvania excavations.7 This is a main street, separating the insula in which the temple is located from another insula to the east. Building 88700 (Fig. 7). Part of a large building (88700) was exposed east of the street. Most of its main room or courtyard was excavated by Yadin and Geva;8 we completed the excavation of this space and found its southern wall (78739), which is 1 m. wide and was preserved to a maximal height of 1.6 m. The wall was found strongly Fig. 7. The southern part of Space 88700 and Wall 78739 (Square A 8, Stratum S-3), view to the south-east. 7 James (above, . 1), Fig. 77, Squares R 7-8.

The inner width of this room or courtyard is 4.2-4.5 m. (its walls are not parallel); its length is at least 8 m. (its original length is unknown because the eastern wall has not yet been revealed). The floor in the western part of the space is made of flat stones, covered by a layer of lime and beaten earth. Several installations made of one line of bricks were constructed on the floors: two such installations were found by Yadin and Geva in the south-western and north-eastern corners of the space (Walls 27 and 34 in their excavation), and we completed the excavation of a third one in the south eastern corner (Locus 88706). North of this installation, Yadin and Geva found an oven-like circular clay storage installation containing much grain, similar to the installation found by us in Space 88704. The brick installations probably served as bins and storage spaces. Along the southern wall, between the installations, there were several grinding stones, one exceptionally large. A grinding stone was also found in the northern part of the space by Yadin and Geva. The entire area was heavily burnt: a thick layer of black ash covered the floor and the fallen brick debris was over 1 m. thick. Many clay vessels were found in the destruction debris, mainly storage jars, large kraters and cooking pots. It appears that the area was utilized as a large kitchen: food was stored, grain ground to wheat and dough perhaps prepared in the large kraters. The actual baking probably took place in the room adjacent to the west. The question whether this was a roofed hall or an open courtyard is unresolved: its large dimensions imply that it was unroofed, yet the large amount of fallen bricks and burnt wood found here hint at its being a roofed hall. An opening found by Yadin and Geva (Locus 2522) connected this space with a narrow lane to the north. An additional opening was located by us in the north-western corner of the space (in Yadin's and Geva's Wall 22), leading to Room 88854 on the west. There were two rooms west of this space: a larger and a narrower one. In the larger (Room 88854), two phases of construction were observed. On the floor of the earlier phase (S-3B), a group of luxury objects was located: it includes a scarab, two gold earrings, a silver signet-ring and two lumps of scrap silver, found wrapped in linen cloth. The pieces include parts of broken bracelets, crescent-shaped objects and toggle pins ? all made of solid silver. It may be surmised that the wrapped scrap silver was utilized as a means of payment. The circumstances under which these finds were left on the floor, prior to the construction of a later floor in this room, remain mysterious, as no evidence for a violent end of this phase was found. In Phase S-3 A the floor of the room was raised and an oven constructed in its north-western corner. A small storage installation made of one line of bricks was constructed in the central part of the room. A fragment of an Egyptian relief, carved on soft chalk stone, was found in the debris of this phase. A fragment of an Egyptian lintel painted with red and black stripes was found in the street west of this room. These finds hint to the use of Egyptian architectural decorations</page><page sequence="11">BETH SHEAN IN THE IRON AGE 211 in the buildings of Stratum S-3 in this area. This is in line with the evidence that a group of important Egyptian monuments was found nearby by the University of Pennsylvania expedition (see below, pp. 215-216). Neither of the two phases in this room was destroyed by fire. It appears that the end of the upper phase (S-3A) is contemporary with the violent end by fire of Area 88700 to the east. If this correlation is correct, then Phase S-3A represents only local alterations during the duration of Stratum S-3 (= Lower VI). In a small room (88853) south of Room 88854, a well-preserved baking oven was found; next to it there is a heap of gray ash, probably the result of continuous cleaning of the oven. There is a small raised stone platform west of the oven. Several rooms and courtyards were found south of these two areas along a length of 11 m., between Street 78740 in the west and Square 7 in the east, where our building is disturbed by a large building of the tenth century B.C.E. (Stratum S-l; Fig. 8). Here, too, two constructional phases were observed. In the earlier phase (S-3B) there was a large courtyard paved with lime and beaten earth. In Locus 88714 the courtyard floor was found covered by a thick layer of fallen bricks. An entrance led from the courtyard into Room 88853 to the north. The continuation of the courtyard was found 6 m. to the east on the same level (Locus 88705). In this stage a room (78726) was added next to Wall 78739. This room had Fig. 8. Looking east in the southern part of Area S.

Both these rooms are very small (inner dimensions of Room 78726: 2 2.6 m.; of Room 78725: 1.45 2.4 m.). Narrow openings (less than 0.5 m. wide) connect the northern room with the area to its east (88705) and with the room to its south. The two rooms were not destroyed by fire and did not contain any special finds. Their size and narrow entrances suggest that they functioned as small storerooms. The construction of the later room reduced the size of the courtyard (Locus 78741) to 4 7 m. Fig. 9. Mudbrick floor in Room 78726 (view to the east). East of the rooms, in Square 7, part of a large open area was exposed. Its inner length is 5.2 m.; its original floor (in Phase S-3B) is probably part of the large courtyard described above, while in Phase S-3A a new floor was constructed on a higher level. A burnt destruction layer found on this floor contained several pottery vessels, among them two cult vessels: a fenestrated stand and a chalice with a bird figurine attached to its rim (Fig. 10). A cultic corner may thus have existed here.10 9 J.N. Tub?: Preliminary Report on the Fourth Season of Excavations at Tell es-Sa'idiyeh in the Jordan Valley, Levant 22 (1990), p. 28, Fig. 12. 10 The stratigraphie attribution of this floor is not clear, however; it may belong to Stratum S-2.</page><page sequence="13">BETH SHEAN IN THE IRON AGE 213 South of this area some evidence was found for the existence of an additional row of rooms; the latter, however, were cut away by the previous excavations. Since all the areas and rooms described above are connected by openings, it can be assumed that they all belong to one composite building, which included courtyards, cooking areas, storerooms, repositories and living rooms. Its outer dimensions are at least 12 m. on an east-west line and 15 m. on a north-south line; since its limits on the east and south are unknown, however, it may have been larger. It may be suggested that a southern wing of this building was excavated by the University of Pennsylvania: Locus 1206 of these excavations could have been a continuation of our Courtyard 88714; Rooms 1201, 1205, 1208 and 1209 of the previous excavations (in their Squares R-S 8) could also be part of the same building (bordered by Street 1199 in the south; see Fig. 4). In this case, our building could be interpreted as a large residency with at least six rooms and/or open spaces, bordered by streets on at least three sides. Street 88810b. This is an east-west street north of Building 88700. The street, whose average width is 1.5 m., was exposed by Yadin and Geva and later by us along 19 m. (in Squares Y-B 9). In Squares 9-10 the junction between this street and the north-south Street 78740 was found. They intersect at a right angle, providing evidence of orthogonal town planning in this part of the city. The continuation of</page><page sequence="14">214 AMIHAI MAZAR the street to the west was probably excavated by the University of Pennsylvania expedition (Loci 1283, 1540, and the street which passes along the length of Building 1500 on its south). The northern buildings. Parts of two attached buildings were exposed north of Street 88810. Of the eastern one (88841 in Square 10) Yadin and Geva uncovered part of a courtyard (2533) with a stone floor, covered by a burnt destruction layer.11 We uncovered additional parts of the pavement and found the lime coating above the stones. The diagonal Wall 33 of the Yadin and Geva excavations encloses a triangular area in the corner of the courtyard; like the installations in Courtyard 2530, it was constructed when the building was already in use. A square bin, constructed of brick walls standing to a height of four courses, was found in the extension of the area to the north. The outer walls of this building and the western one (88881) are close together; a space of 0.5-0.7 m. between them was filled with irregular mudbrick construction.12 We continued the excavation of Yadin's and Geva's Room 2543, uncovering its northern wall (88836); this made it possible to determine the room's width: 3.2 m. Its length is still unknown, since its western part is covered by walls and floors of Strata S-l and S-2. In the north-eastern corner of this room we found that the double-cell bin (2588 and 2547) of the previous excavations replaced an earlier bin: this is an indication of the time-span of Stratum S-3 and of the various architectural changes that took place in the course of its duration. Two additional installations were found by Yadin and Geva in the southern part of the area: a raised plastered platform with a plastered parapet (2541), probably used as a dough trough, and a bin (2549). This room, which was also destroyed by a heavy fire, appears to be similar to the kitchen-like area (88700) of the adjacent building to the south. Another area, partly exposed to the north of Wall 88836, was also heavily burnt. A small bin containing grain was found here. Two pits cut from the Iron Age II levels disturbed this area. The four partly excavated buildings described above and the intersecting streets separating them may easily be incorporated into the city plan of Stratum Lower VI, published by the University of Pennsylvania. These buildings are probably part of the residential quarter of the Egyptian administration at Beth Shean during the Twentieth Dynasty, as can be ascertained from the nature of their rich contents. The pottery includes many vessels of Egyptian forms, probably locally produced. Most common are the flat-sided bowls with outturned red painted rims, as well as various forms of handleless bottles known as 'beer bottles'. The gold and silver jewellery, the scrap silver, the gold leaves and the gold ram head, as well as 11 Yadin and Geva (above, n. 2), pp. 40-44. 12 In Yadin's and Geva's plan the two walls appear as one: W 19 (see ibid., p. 40, Fig. 13).</page><page sequence="15">BETH SHEAN IN THE IRON AGE 215 the scarabs, cornelian and glass beads and pendants (Fig. 11) are all evidence of the wealth and high rank of the inhabitants. Few bullae with seal impressions on clay lumps and a very fragmentary Egyptian ostracon are evidence of administrative or trade activity in which the residents were involved. Two of the seal impressions were made with a rounded conical seal bearing an intricate geometric motif. A seal impression of the same class was found at Tell es-Sa'idiyeh in a similar, contemporary building.13 The fragments of an Egyptian relief and painted lintel found by us in Building 88700 hint at the use of Egyptian architectural decoration and reliefs in parts of our buildings. A concentration of five fragments of Egyptian reliefs and inscriptions, the most important group of such monuments in Stratum VI, was found in the same general area by the University of Pennsylvania. This group includes the lintel with the dedication of Ramesses Weser Hepesh, on which cartouches of Ramesses III were found, as well as two fragments of inscribed lintels, a fragment of a relief 13 Tubb (above, . 9) p. 28, Fig. 11. Several of the pottery vessels published from this building appear to date from the tenth century B.C.E. Such are ibid., p. 30, Fig. 14:6; and idem, Tell es-Sa'idiyeh; Preliminary Report on the First Three Seasons of Renewed Excavations, Levant 20 (1988), p. 42, Fig. 19:1, 4, 6, 7, 13, 16-18; p. 43, Fig. 20:2-3. See Jane Cahill et al.: Tell el-Hammeh in the Tenth Century B.C.E., Qadmoniot 22 (1989), p. 38 (Hebrew), who claim that the entire building should be dated to the tenth century B.C.E. and that it was destroyed by Shishak. The similarity, however, between other items from this building (seal impression and brick floor) and the finds from Stratum Lower VI at Beth Shean is striking; thus, it may tentatively be suggested that the published pottery does not belong to the original building. We hope that future publications will resolve this problem.</page><page sequence="16">216 AMIHAI MAZAR showing a man sitting in front of an altar and another curved fragment.14 The monuments were found 'below Locus 1522'; the latter is located in Square S 7 of the previous excavations' grid and was attributed to Stratum V. It can be tentatively located in the area of our Square 10, or above Wall 19 of Yadin and Geva (although its exact location is uncertain). The American expedition removed almost all the remains of Stratum V in our area, but did not reach Stratum VI. It is thus possible that the monuments were found slightly above the top of the Lower VI walls, most probably in the level of Upper VI (our Stratum S-2). We conclude that these monuments must have originally been in use in the buildings of Stratum Lower VI (our Stratum S-3) in our area or in the immediate vicinity. This is another indication of the importance of these buildings and of their having been in the centre of the Egyptian governmental quarter at Beth Shean. The Stratum S-3 pottery assemblage did not contain any imported sherds of Cypriote or Mycenaean HIB ware. On the other hand, we found the upper half of a Myc. UIC stirrup jar, as well as a few small sherds of Myc. UIC ware. A complete stirrup jar and a few more fragments of similar ware were found in the earlier excavations in the Stratum VI debris.15 The Myc. UIC pottery from Beth Shean is found in small quantity, but the high quality of the fabric probably indicates that it was imported either from Greece or from Cyprus. Small quantities of similar imported ware were also found at Tell Keisan and coastal sites in Lebanon and Syria.16 This import of small amounts of Myc. UIC ware in the northern part of the country should be sharply distinguished from the phenomenon of local production of similar ware in large quantities in Ashdod, Ekron and perhaps Ashkelon, which can be related to the settlement of the Philistines. In addition to the Egyptian and Mycenaean UIC pottery, Stratum S-3 contains a variety of pottery forms made in the local Canaanite tradition, though many of these can be distinguished from LB IIB (thirteenth century B.C.E.) forms. Thus, the ceramic profile of Beth Shean Lower VI is well suited to the time of the Twentieth Dynasty, a period which should be defined as 'Iron Age I A'.17 14 James (above, . 1), Figs. 92-93; 94-95, Nos. 1-2; W.A.

Singer suggested that Megiddo VIIA was the main Egyptian stronghold in northern Palestine at the time of the Twentieth Dynasty. See I. Singer: The Political Status of Megiddo VIIA, El 20 (1989), pp. 51-57 (Hebrew). However, Megiddo lacks two major features which distinguish Beth Shean in this period: the abundance of local pottery made in Egyptian style and technique, and Egyptian inscribed monuments and architectural decoration. Thus, in spite of the Egyptian inscriptions on small objects at Megiddo, the city probably continued to survive as a Canaanite city state during the Twentieth Dynasty.</page><page sequence="17">BETH SHEAN IN THE IRON AGE 217 The violent destruction by fire of Stratum S-3 (= Lower VI) can presumably be related to the collapse of the Egyptian rule in Canaan. The destruction could have been caused by several factors: a revolt of the local Canaanite population suppressed by the Egyptians, or by a group led by one of the 'Sea Peoples' who settled in the region at a time of ethnic changes and decline of Egyptian power, following the reign of Ramesses III. The raid of the Transjordanian Midianites on the Valleys of Harod and Jezreel and the Israelite response documented in the Gideon narrative (Judg. 7) probably could not have taken place when the Egyptians were still in power in the region. This raid was perhaps one of the consequences of the decline of the Egyptian power. It is even possible that Beth Shean was burnt during this or a similar raid and the subsequent military clashes with local Israelite tribes.18 Stratum S-2 (= Upper VI) (Fig. 12) The destruction of Stratum S-3 (= Lower VI) created a layer of fallen mudbricks more than 1 m. thick. It may be conjectured that parts of the massive brick walls of this level still protruded above the ruins, since the people of Stratum S-2 reconstructed and re-used some of these walls. The new stratum was poorly preserved, and its remains are found just below the present surface which was created by the University of Pennsylvania excavations. In the area excavated by Yadin and Geva almost no remains of this stratum were preserved except a few earth layers, small segments of floors and one or two ovens. This explains why they failed to determine correctly the nature of this stratum. The best preservation of Stratum S-2 structures was in the northern and south western parts of our area (in Squares Y-Z-A 7, 8 and Z-A-B 10-11). Street 78740 of Stratum S-3 in Squares Y-Z 7-10 was now repaved on a higher level with beaten earth, in which many small stones and pottery sherds were embedded, as if treaded on for a long time (Loci 78707 and 88810a). In Square Y 7, a square installation was found, with narrow brick walls and a pavement of basalt stones, some of which were broken grinding stones, probably taken from earlier occupation debris. A well-preserved oven was found nearby. A complete room or courtyard surrounded by walls on all four sides was detected in Square 7. Two of these walls (the western one, 78729, and the northern one, 78716) were constructed above or slightly to the side of ruined walls of Stratum S-3. The southern wall (68723) is a thin one (Fig. 13), constructed in Stratum S-2 and abutting a wall of Stratum S-3A, which probably continued to be in use in Stratum S-2 as the eastern wall of our area. This area was paved with a white lime floor, which was occasionally raised and relaid. The floor is about 1.30 m. above the floor of 18 A. Maiamat, in .

On the uppermost floor layer (Locus 68710) a concentration of three broken storage jars and other pottery vessels was found. It appears that the brick walls which created Room 78726 in Stratum S-3 continued to be in use in Stratum S-2. Here (in Square A 7, Locus 68709) another white lime floor yielded a number of pottery vessels (Fig. 14), including a red-slipped strainer jug (Fig. 14:6). In Square 8 a brick wall (78831) was found above the fallen brick debris of Stratum S-3 and adjoining the western face of Wall 22 of Yadin's and Geva's excavation, which is attributed to Stratum S-3 in our excavation. In Square 10, Wall 88873 of Stratum S-2 was attached to remains of an earlier wall of Stratum S-3, thickening the latter. The two walls probably continued to be in use together. This is a clear example of how the people of Stratum S-2 re-used walls of the earlier stratum. Nearby, an oven of Stratum S-2 (88864) was constructed above the destruction layer of Stratum S-3. In Squares Z-A 10 and A 11, a stone pavement (88828), 4.5 4.5 m. in size, covered destruction debris and part of Wall 88836 of Stratum S-3 (Fig. 15). A foundation of a Stratum S-l wall (88808) was found above this pavement. This data is sufficient to prove that Stratum S-2 is an independent phase in the history of Beth Shean, characterized by the rebuilding of the destroyed city of Stratum S-3 (= Lower VI), while preserving the general layout of the latter. This stratigraphie picture appears to f?t the nature of Stratum Upper VI, as defined by the University of Pennsylvania excavations.19 This stratum contains structures later than Stratum Lower VI (our S-3), but retains the layout of that city and utilizes some of its structures and walls in secondary use. The pottery assemblages of Stratum S-2 are typical of the eleventh century B.C.E. in the Valleys of Jezreel and Beth Shean. In addition to the pottery shown in Fig. 14, examples may be found in the pottery plates of Strata 1-3 in Yadin's and Geva's excavations. The best parallels are from Stratum VIA at Megiddo.20 Painted vessels, such as the strainer jug (Fig. 14:6), are characteristic. The storage jars with tall, ridged necks (Fig. 14:8-9) are also typical, although they already appear in Stratum S-3. Egyptian forms, which were very common in Stratum S-3, disappear in S-2. No decorated Philistine pottery of the bichrome style was found, with the exception of one bowl sherd decorated with red spirals. Three fragmentary figurines from the stratum under discussion (Fig. 16), found on the floor of the street, have flat bodies recalling figurines found in Tomb 241 of 19 James (above, . 1), pp. 19-22 and Fig. 77. 20 The correlation between Strata Lower VI at Beth Shean and VIIA at Megiddo and between Upper VI at Beth Shean and VIA at Megiddo has already been pointed out in Dothan (above, n. 15), pp. 81-82.</page><page sequence="20">220 AMIHAI MAZAR ^i^^^^^^ ^^^^^^ Fig. 14.

In my opinion, the Double Temple complex related by the excavators to Stratum Lower V can be attributed to Stratum Upper VI, as indicated by the objects from the Southern Temple and from the lower floor of the Northern Temple. These assemblages include cult objects and pottery vessels decorated in rich painted decoration which 21 Oren (above, . 1 ), p. 241, Fig. 50:12,14-15.

In contrast to the temples, the well-planned block of buildings attributed to Stratum V in the northern part of the Stratum V plan (Squares Q-R 7) included pottery of the Iron Age II. This block is probably later than the Double Temple complex, though both appear on the same plan of Stratum V. 24 James (above, n. 1), pp. 4-38.</page><page sequence="23">BETH SHEAN IN THE IRON AGE 223 S-2 is chronologically and culturally closer to Stratum S-3 (Lower VI), from which these monuments most probably originated. It is thus suggested that following the violent destruction of Stratum Lower VI, which represents the last phase of Egyptian domination at Beth Shean, and perhaps after an undefined gap in occupation, the city was rebuilt in Stratum Upper VI (our Stratum S-2) on a similar layout. Some of the streets of the later city retained the layout of earlier streets; in some cases walls of the earlier city continued to be used, while in other cases they were rebuilt or new walls were established along ruined walls of Stratum Lower VI. If our supposition concerning the temples is correct, then the temples of this new city differed markedly from those of the earlier city: they were of a new plan and orientation. The nature of the material culture in this new city is mainly Canaanite, though a few elements may be attributed to 'Sea Peoples'. This picture is quite different from the one presented by Yadin and Geva,25 in which Stratum 3 is presented as an independent level of pits and ovens representing a semi nomadic population. Geva even attempted to reach cultural-historical conclusions, based on a comparison of the finds at Beth Shean to finds at other northern sites.26 However, two pits and a skimpy wall can be integrated in the plan of our Stratum S-2.27 This is also true of the earth layers attributed to Strata 1-2, which contain pottery typical of our Stratum S-2. Thus, both the presentation of the evidence and its interpretation as suggested by Geva have no sound basis. A thin layer of ash and burnt debris found on the floors in Squares Z-A 7 and the broken pottery vessels found on the floors are evidence of the violent end of Stratum S-2. This destruction may be identified as one in a series of destructions dated to the end of the eleventh or beginning of the tenth century B.C.E. at several sites in the coastal plain and northern valleys, such as Tell Qasile Stratum X, Megiddo Stratum VIA, Yoqneam and Tel Hadar on the eastern coast of the Sea of Galilee. It is possible that all these were caused by the conquests of David in regions not included in the Israelite territories during the period of the Judges.28 25 Yadin and Geva (above, n. 2), pp. 8-39. 26 Shulamit Geva: The Transition from Canaanite to Israelite Hegemony in Palestine ?

The building is cut away on the south by the previous excavations. Its northern continuation probably disappeared as I y I ? . I, a I I CI Fig. 18.

The walls have basalt stone foundations and a mudbrick superstructure. Some of the foundation stones are up to 0.8 m. long (in Walls 88728 and 88730). Wooden beams were laid between the stone foundations and the mudbrick superstructure, as evidenced by carbonized wood remains. 29 Square 9, where the continuation of the building was expected to be found, was excavated by Yadin and Geva, who did not discover any relevant remains.</page><page sequence="25">BETH SHEAN IN THE IRON AGE 225 Two units may be defined in the preserved part of the building: a western unit, including two rooms (88708 and 88707), and an eastern unit, in which only one room (88750) has been excavated so far (Fig. 19). The wide wall separating the two units is in fact composed of two walls attached to one another (68727 and 68717), as can be observed from the plan of the foundations (in Square C 8) and from the differences in the nature of the brick superstructure of the two walls (in Square C 7). The combined width of the two walls is 2.15 m. Other walls of the building (like 88729 and 88730) are 1.6-1.7 m. wide. An interesting component of the building is the wide foundation (88728), which is 3.5 5.6 m. in size. It may have been a foundation for a tower or a flight of steps leading to a second floor. The building was destroyed by a very heavy fire, which caused partial firing of the bricks. Room 88708 (in Squares B-C 7) had already been excavated by the University of Pennsylvania. It is a square room (inner dimensions: 3.3 3.25 m.); its floor was not preserved (it was perhaps excavated by our predecessors). The brick walls of this room stand three courses above the stone foundation. The bricks were burnt in the destruction of the building to the hardness of pottery; some of the bricks melted and turned into a solid hard mass of fired clay which covers the area close to the Fig. 19.

Room 88707 is a small chamber (inner dimensions: 1.7 3.0 m.), surrounded by thick walls. Its floor was not preserved, and its function is unknown. Room 88750 is a large square room (inner dimensions: 3.8 4.0 m.) in which a plaster floor was preserved, covered by a destruction layer. A number of burnt parallel wooden beams were found on the floor. In the destruction layer, composed of burnt fallen bricks, there were many fragments of storage jars with wide 'swollen' body, low neck and outturned rim with a deep groove below it. Similar jars are well known in tenth century B.C.E. destruction layers at Tell el-Hammeh and Tel 'Amai, both close to Beth Shean.30 Also found here were a red-slipped and very well-burnished bowl, typical of the tenth century B.C.E., and calcite loom weights of a type common at contemporary Tel 'Amai. The room probably served as a storeroom, since storage jars are almost the only components in it. The building is strategically located on the south-eastern corner of the mound, overlooking its surroundings. It is probably part of a citadel or palace erected during the tenth century B.C.E. Additional walls of Stratum S-l were found in the north-western corner of the excavation area; they include the corner of a solid building (its walls are 1.2 m. wide), but here only the stone foundations made of large basalt boulders and a few segments of floor surfaces were preserved.31 The city of Stratum S-l differs from its predecessor in plan and building technique. The date of its foundation is related to the question whether there was an occupational gap at Beth Shean following the destruction of Stratum S-2. It is possible that the city was founded in the course of the reign of David, or, more plausibly, the reign of Solomon, during which Beth Shean is mentioned as an important city in the fifth district (1 Kings 4:12). The heavy conflagration which destroyed Stratum S-l recalls the destruction by fire of the nearby tenth century B.C.E. towns at Tel 'Amai and Tell el-Hammeh. Evidence for violent destruction was found at Megiddo Stratum IVA-VB as well.32 It is probable that these destructions occurred during the raid of Shishak, who passed through the Beth Shean Valley and Megiddo on his way from the Jordan Valley to the coastal plain.33 30 James (above, . 1), Fig. 47:15 (a rim of a similar jar from the upper floor of the Northern Temple of Stratum V, dated to the tenth century B.C.E.); S.

A large number of restorable pottery vessels were found on the floors of these buildings. The three later occupation phases defined by them (named Strata 1-3) raise, however, serious problems of interpretation. A poorly-built wall, an oven and a few pits were attributed to Stratum 3, yet no floors were identified. This phase was thought to have followed the end of the Egyptian presence at Beth Shean. Geva suggested that the pits are an indication of a semi-nomadic population.34 The excavators attributed several foundations of stone walls found close to the topsoil to Strata 1-2, yet no floors or occupation debris related to these walls were preserved. Yadin's and Geva's excavation was an important attempt to resolve the problems related to the Iron Age strata at Beth Shean, but the excavation area was too small and the state of preservation of the remains of Strata 1-3 too poor to permit substantial conclusions. The attempt to divide the remains later than their Stratum 4 into three different strata and to present historical conclusions based on this division is, in my view, not convincing. Even Garfinkel's proposal to unite Strata 2 and 3 into one stratum is insufficient.35 Both the excavation report and our renewed excavations show that the pottery attributed to Strata 1-3 originates from earth layers and pits belonging to one occupation level, which, unfortunately, was poorly preserved in the area excavated by Yadin and Geva. This level can be identified with our Stratum S-2 (or Stratum Upper VI of the University of Pennsylvania) and may be dated to the eleventh century B.C.E. On the other hand, the stone foundations attributed to Strata 1-2 in Yadin's and Geva's excavation belong to our Stratum S-l, which can be dated to the tenth century B.C.E. These foundations were probably constructed into the earth deposits of our Stratum S-2; thus, the pottery attributed by Yadin and Geva to their Stratum 1 is probably unrelated to these walls' foundations.36 Since no typological differences exist between the pottery 34 Yadin and Geva (above, n. 2), pp. 28-39; Geva (above, n. 26). 35 Garfinkel (above, n. 27). 36 The pottery of Yadin's and Geva's Stratum 1 comes from three loci, all stratigraphically questionable. Locus 2503: a floor (?), which in fact is an earth layer 0.7 m. lower than the lowest level of the nearby wall foundation. The layer is above the top of walls of our Strata S-2 and S-3 in our Squares 9-10. Locus 2505A: an earth layer to the east and near the former locus (our Square 10). Stratigraphically, it is between topsoil and the destruction layer of Yadin's and Geva's Stratum 4 (our Stratum S-3). Locus 2501, where few sherds were found, is not marked on the plans and probably was a topsoil layer. The pottery attributed to Stratum 2 comes from two loci. Locus 2505B: the lower part of layer 2505A in our Square 10; it cannot be distinguished stratigraphically or typologically from Locus 2505A, which was attributed to Stratum 1. Locus 2514A: this locus is not mentioned in the text or plans.</page><page sequence="28">228 AMIHAI MAZAR of these three 'strata', it can be suggested that all the pottery from 'Strata' 1-3 (except for a few stray sherds) belong to one occupation level (our Stratum S-2), while the stone foundations (Walls 17, 21 and 35) belong to Stratum S-l of tenth century B.C.E.37 CONCLUSIONS The stratigraphie sequence of the twelfth-tenth centuries B.C.E. occupation strata at Beth Shean, as revealed in our excavations, provides a better understanding of the occupational history at this important site during that period. Stratum Lower VI (our S-3) signifies a well-planned city, with a temple, public buildings and residencies, in which architectural decorations in Egyptian style, and Egyptian monuments and inscriptions were utilized. Two building phases may be defined in this stratum. The ceramic repertoire is based on local Canaanite traditions, accompanied by many vessels made locally in Egyptian style. A small quantity of Mycenaean UIC pottery was found in this stratum, while no Cypriote imports were discovered. This stratum represents the last phase of the Egyptian governmental centre at Beth Shean, during the Twentieth Dynasty. The violent destruction by fire of Stratum Lower VI was probably caused by an attack on the city, related to the collapse of Egyptian domination of Canaan. The Midianite invasion and Gideon's response are one possibility for the identification of the attackers, although a local Canaanite revolt against the Egyptian governmental centre should also be considered. The city was rebuilt somewhat later, in Stratum Upper VI (our S-2). The new city retained the previous layout, and some of the earlier walls continued to be in use or were rebuilt. This shows that only a short time passed between the destruction of Stratum Lower VI and the construction of Upper VI, perhaps c. 1100 B.C.E. It is suggested that the Double Temple complex (the Northern and Southern Temples) which was attributed to Stratum V, was, in fact, part of the city of Stratum Upper VI. The material culture of this stratum is basically Canaanite, though some elements may be attributed to 'Sea Peoples'. This city is chronologically and culturally confluent with the mention of Beth Shean in the battle of Gilboa narrative, according to which the Philistines hung the bodies of Saul and his sons on the walls of Beth Shean and put Saul's weapons in the temple of Ashtarot (1 Sam. 31:1-12). The finds from Stratum 3 come from two pits (2525 and 2529), which cut into Stratum 4 (our S-3) debris and Wall 19, but are not sealed by any stratigraphie element, and thus may be contemporary with the earth layers attributed to Strata 1-2 in the same square. See the section drawing in Yadin and Geva (above, n. 2), p. 44, Fig. 17. 37 Our criticism, based on the expansion of the excavated area and further excavation, would not have been possible without the prompt publication by Shulamit Geva (above, n. 26), following the untimely death of Prof. Y. Yadin. This publication laid an important foundation for further critical research of this area.</page><page sequence="29">BETH SHEAN IN THE IRON AGE 229 There are hardly any Philistine finds at Beth Shean (except for a few tiny sherds), and it definitely cannot be identified as a Philistine city. It was, however, probably populated by local Canaanites and perhaps by groups of 'Sea Peoples' ? possibly descendants of mercenaries serving in the Egyptian government of the preceding phase. The latter could have been allied with the Philistines during the time of Saul; this may be the background of the biblical narrative.38 The violent destruction of Stratum Upper VI by fire may be attributed to the overtaking of the northern valleys by King David, who perhaps destroyed other cities in northern Philistia, in the Valley of Jezreel and in the Land of Geshur. After a gap of an unknown length, Beth Shean was rebuilt on a new layout (Stratum Lower V; our S-l). The public building ? palace or fortress ? discovered by us belongs to this city, as well as the well-planned complex of structures excavated by the University of Pennsylvania in the northern section of their excavation area. These structures show that during the tenth century B.C.E., probably during the reign of Solomon, an Israelite administrative centre existed at Beth Shean. The destruction of this city was caused by a violent fire, perhaps evidence of the conquest of the city during the invasion of Shishak. Thus we can define three successive stages in the history of Beth Shean during the twelfth-tenth centuries B.C.E., each with its own cultural characteristics: an Egyptian government centre; an independent, mainly Canaanite, city; and, finally, an Israelite city and administrative centre. Each city was violently destroyed during identifiable historical events. 38 Oren (above, . 1), pp. 149-150, suggested that the Sea Peoples at Beth Shean were the dnn mentioned in the Egyptian documents. See O. Negbi: Were there Sea Peoples in the Central Jordan Valley at the Transition from the Bronze Age to the Iron Age? Tel Aviv 18 (1991), pp. 205-243. I basically agree with Negbi's answer to the question raised in the title of her paper, namely that the role of Sea Peoples in the early twelfth century B.C.E. in the Jordan Valley was minimal or non-existent.</page></plain_text>
