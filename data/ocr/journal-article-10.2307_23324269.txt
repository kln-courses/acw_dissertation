<plain_text><page sequence="1">METAPHORS FOR THE FIVE SENSES IN OLD ENGLISH PROSE BY ROSA MARIA FERA This article explores the metaphors related to the five senses in Old English prose, through the study of literary, linguistic and iconographic evidence. This synoptic approach will take into consideration the senses collectively, either when considered as sense-organs or as sense-faculties, highlighting the different ways in which they are ranked and exploring the cultural influences behind them. Across the various shapes taken on by the senses, this article will point out the Anglo-Saxon striking polarization of external and internal senses, and how this mirrors another import ant dichotomy related to one specific sense within Old English texts, that of the eyes of the body as opposed to those of the mind. Moreover, this study will show how the relationship between external and internal senses leads Anglo-Saxon scho lars to a bivalent perspective of the bodily senses, considered positively as tools of enrichment and bearers of health, and at the same time negatively, as means of sinning. I. Inner and Outer Senses The concepts of inner and outer senses have been largely employed in exegetical and theological literature. When the term 'internal sense' first appears in Latin philosophical texts, it is used as synonymous with a single post-sensationary fac ulty of the soul, a concept first elaborated by Aristotle. Although the Greek philosopher does not draw a neat distinction between inner and outer senses,2 he formulates the concept of 'common sense' as a faculty functioning after per ception operates through the five senses,3 and identifies intellectual faculties such as fantasy, thought and memory. When identifying a single common sense receiving the information from the external senses, early medieval philosophy essentially draws on Aristotle: St 1 H. A. Wolfson, 'The Internal Senses in Latin, Arabic, and Hebrew Philosophic Texts', Harvard Theol Rev, 28 (1935), 69-133: 69. 2 H. Anzulewicz, 'Konzeptionen und Perspektiven der Sinneswahrnehmung', in A. Paravicini Bagliani (ed.), I cinque sensi, Micrologus, 10 (2002), 199-238: 203. 3 The ou&lt;rdr|ais Koivr|, 'common sense', should be distinguished from the Koivr| öuvc/.jiK, 'common sensation', a perceiving principle preceding the senses, which can be identified with perception itself; see C.

I will show how the passages examined further enhance the polarization of inner and outer senses compared to the patristic sources in which they are encountered, and explore the reasons behind it. Through the various shapes taken on metaphorically by the physical senses, we will come across this polarization in both Old English literary texts and Anglo-Saxon iconographic representations. 5 See, for instance, Augustine, Confessionum libri tredecim, ed.

The Sense-Organs: Gateways, Shillings and Talents The inferiority of the bodily senses to the inner self is explicitly stated in ¿Elfric's Lives of Saints, where he provides us with an epistemological discussion of the sense-organs. While classifying the outer senses, yElfric points out their relation ship with the soul: Seo sawul is J)aes lichoman hlaefdige, and heo gewissaä jja fif andgitu Jdses lichaman swa swa of cynesaetle. t&gt;a andgitu sint gehatene |dus: Uisus, \&gt;xt is gesihä; auditus, hlyst; Gustus, swax</page><page sequence="4">712 ROSA MARIA FERA Fig. 2.

These senses are thus named: Visus, that is, sight; Auditus, hearing; Gustus, taste with the mouth; Odoratus, smelling with the nose; Tactus, touching or feeling with all the limbs, but most usually with the hands. The soul directs these five senses according to its will, and it behoves that, as a mistress, it should carefully consider what it will command each limb to do, or what it permits to each limb as regards its natural desire, that nothing unseemly should befall by means of any limb's service. 10 yElfric, Lives of Saints, ed. and tr.

This should be borne in mind when looking at the various metaphors JElfric employs to represent the bodily senses, and in particular the sense-organs. One of the most effective metaphors is that of gateways, which is quite frequent among the Fathers of the Church. In his Confessions, for instance, Saint Augustine describes the sensations in absentia, through the lens of memory, as passing through an aditus: There [in the memory], neatly by kind, are kept all the things which have entered, each by its own route of entry, just as light and all colours and bodily shapes enter by the eyes; all kinds of sounds by the ears; all odours by the entrance of the nostrils; all tastes through the entrance of the mouth. The power of sensation in the entire body distinguishes what is hard or soft, hot or cold, smooth or rough, heavy or light, whether external or internal to the body [...]. Each of them enters into it [the memory] by its own hole, and is put on deposit here.12 Further on in book X, Augustine defines more specifically the sense-organs as actual doors: How they will have got into me, let them tell if they can: for my own part, I have run over the doors of my flesh, but cannot find by which they got in. For, my eyes say, if those images were coloured: 'we announced them'; the ears say: 'if they gave any sound, they were indicated by us'; the nostrils say: 'if they had any smell, they passed through us'; the sense of taste also says: 'if there is no flavour, do not ask me at all'; touch says: 'if there were no body, I did not handle it, and if I never handled it, I did not indicate it'. Whence and how did these things get into my memory? I do not know [.. .].13 Augustine imagines the sense-organs as gateways through which information passes, before being deposited in the memory. Since, according to his De Trinitate, memory, together with will and understanding, is one of the three powers of the soul, these excerpts exemplify the dynamics of sensations and the relationship of the bodily senses to the inner self. Moreover, adding dramatic character to the passage, Augustine employs a prosopopaeic device, whereby he personifies the senses by making them speak in the first person. It will be clear further on that the anthropomorphic representation of the senses is a tempting one not only for the Fathers of the Church, but also for Anglo-Saxon scholars.

This Latin evidence, and Bede's work in particular,20 con stitutes a literary tradition with which jElfric of Eynsham, writing in the tenth century, was familiar, as shown by a passage in CH.I.33: Pact portgeat getacnaö sum lichamlic andgit. J&gt;e men Jjurh syngiaö. Se man J&gt;e tosaewä ungejawasmysse betwux cristenum mannum. o5cSe se 5e sprecä unrihtwisnysse on hean nysse. |)urh his mujses geat he hi 3 dead geferod.

The man who spreads disagreement among Christian men, or who speaks unrighteousness in high places through the gate of his mouth, he is borne dead. He who beholds a woman with libidinous eye and foul lust, through his eyes' gate, manifests his soul's death. He, who with delight listens to idle discourse or contumelious words, makes his ear a gate of death to himself. So it is also to be understood of the other senses. 15 Jeremiah IX.21. 16 Gregory the Great, Moralia in Job, ed. M. Adriaen, CCSL 143 (Turnhout, 1979-81), XXI, 2, 1065, 11. 11-13. This passage also occurs, albeit slightly modified, in the Middle English treatise The Fyve Wyttes, which displays the same fear expressed by Augustine, concerning the seduction undergone by the five senses and especially by sight.

Moreover, it is important to point out how in Old English the window itself can be called eag-pyrl, an 'eye-hole'. A particularly interesting occurrence is to be found in CH.I.38: 'Ure ehjnrlu sind ure eagan jjurh äa besceawa5 ure sawul',23 'Our windows are our eyes, through which we look at our soul', where the eyes become windows on the inner self rather than on the outside world. The type of relationship envisaged between internal and external senses encourages the conceptualization of the senses as gateways. This image, whether an actual gate, a door or a window, allows the establishment of a neat, yet osmotic boundary between the two. The need to draw a boundary between in ternal and external senses emerges on linguistic grounds, and is reflected in the use of the words employed to indicate them both. For instance, ¿Elfric's homily drawing on Gregory the Great,24 after the Parable of the Five Talents, reads:25 t&gt;a fif pund getacnia3 ]aa fif andgitu ures lichaman [...] í&gt;as fif pund underfehä aslc Jjaera äa fif lichamlican andgitu ansunde haefä [...] Witodlice, on Sam twam pundum is getacnod aegöer ge Jjaet yttre andgit ge Jjst inre.

By the one talent one sense is signified. The good servant, who received the five talents, gained for his lord another five in addition; for some laymen are so constituted, that, with stimulation from the realm above, they give good example to other faithful [...] Who does so, brings to God ten talents from the five outer senses that he received [...]. As with Latin sensus, the noun andgyt displays a semantic polyvalence, since it can refer to both the inner and the outer senses. Differently from the use of sensus, however, yElfric feels the need to qualify da fif andgitu with the addition of ures lichaman in order to clarify he is talking about the physical senses. Likewise, the need to qualify the noun andgyt justifies attributions such as the adjectives ytera, 'outer' and innera 'inner' and, in other cases, as an alternative, yElfric uses the 22 The Dictionary of Old English Corpus, http://quod.lib.umich.edu/o/oec/, s.v. eag-pyrl and its spelling varieties eg-pyrl or eh-pyrl. 23 /F.lfric, Catholic Homilies, I, 38 (512, 1. 142).

More specifically, Godden finds ambiguous what the one talent signifies: 'whereas in Gregory the intellectum represented by the single talent evidently refers to the understanding of spiritual things also received by the second servant, the an andgit of yElfric could refer to either the external or internal understanding'.29 However, in spite of the actual semantic ambiguity, particularly enhanced by this context, the meaning of the one talent is explicitly stated by /Elfric further on in the homily: E&gt;urh 3a twa pund wees getacnod aegSer ge Ipxt yttre andgit. ge Jiaet inre. and se 3e 5a fif pund haefde waes wiäutan geglenged mid 5am fif andgitum. [5set is Gesihä. and hlyst. swaecc. and stenc. and hrepung. and waes 3a gyt asmtig fram 3am incundan andgite. 3a het se hlaford for 3i syllan Jsast an pund. \&gt;xt J&gt;ast andgit getacnode ]_iam holdum 3eowan Jse him gestrynde mid 3am fif yttrum andgitum o3re fif pund.,ü By the two pounds both the outer senses and the inner were betokened; and he who had the five pounds was provided on the outside with the five senses, that is, sight and hearing, taste and smell and touch, but was yet void of the inward sense. The Lord therefore commanded the one pound which betokened that sense, to be given to the faithful servant who with the five outer senses had gained him another five pounds. Apart from clarifying that the one talent represents the 'inward sense', the latter passage further confirms the need to avoid the semantic ambiguity by drawing a distinction between internal and external senses, a need which is not peculiar to /Elfric: it runs across the Old English prose corpus, and is to be encountered consistently in the Alfredian texts as well. " Precisely because of the liminal role of the sense-organs, a double-take on them seems to emerge clear: a negative perspective, which is evident in the case of greed entering through the window of the bodily senses, is confirmed by .Elfric's explicit warning against their sinful use, as in the following passage, where he presents each sense (alternatively point ing them out by its organ or as a faculty) from the perspective of what it should do rightly in order to avoid sin: Se faer3 and fanda3 Rissen fif andgita. se 5e Jjurh fyrwitnysse. and unstilnysse hi aspent on unnyt; Hefigtyme leahter. is ungefoh fyrwitnys; Ac we sceolon awendan urne lec. fram yfelre gesih3e; Urne hlyst fram yfelre spraece; Urne swscc. fram unalyfedum äigenum; Ure 27 Bosworth and Toller, An Anglo-Saxon Dictionary, s. vv. ytera, innera, incund.

Immoderate curiosity is a grave sin; for we should turn our look from evil sight, our hearing from evil speech, our taste from illicit aliments, our noses from hurtful smells, our hands and whole body from foul and sinful contacts, if we are desirous of coming to the delicacies of the eternal meal. However, the positive conception of the five senses emerging from ¿Elfric's pas sage on the five talents, where they allow enrichment and growth if kept sound, finds confirmation in the following excerpt from CH.I.9, where they are repre sented as instruments of redemption, taking on yet another shape: God bebead, on ]pxre ealdan se, his folce J)st hi sceoldon him ofrian selc frumcenned hysecild, o35e alysan hit ut mid fif scyllingum f...] Ure yfelan gejjohtas, oäöe weorc we sceolon alysan mid fif scyllingum, Jsaet is, we scylon ure yfelnysse behreowsian mid urum fif andgitum, \&gt;xt synt: gesyhä, and hlyst, and swaec, and stenc and hrepung.33 God commanded, according to the old law, that his people should offer him every first newborn child or redeem him with five shillings [...] Our evil thoughts or deed we shall redeem with five shillings, that is, we shall redeem our evilness with five senses, that are sight, and hearing, and taste, and smell, and touch. The shillings, similarly to the talents, can be employed positively or negatively, thus providing a neutral and versatile image which can acquire alternative conno tations. Whether employing the metaphor of gateways, shillings or talents, these passages exemplify the double function of the bodily senses, considered both tools of sin and at the same time of redemption from sin, and, more importantly, draw an outline of the dynamic relationship between internal and external senses, show ing that their mutual definition is at the heart of the Anglo-Saxon conceptualiza tion of the bodily senses. III. Sense-Faculties and Animals: from Pliny to /Elfric If the sense-organs are represented by various types of gateways, talents and shillings, the sense-faculties are often associated with a different and wide set of metaphors in Old English prose. Either intended as a whole group or individually, these faculties are sometimes associated with the animal world. Individually, we come across identifications of the different senses with the lynx, the eagle, the panther and the whale, and finally, representing them all, the oxen. The sense-faculties have been associated with animals since Pliny's Historia 32 yElfric, Catholic Homilies, II, 23 (215, II. 55-62). The emphasis on the Augustinian concept of curiositas is noteworthy; see, for instance, Augustine, Confessiones, X, 35 (ed. CCSL 27, pp. 184—85,11. 21-5). The accretion of knowledge through immoderate curiosity, not anchored to a devotional context, is in /["'.line's view to be condemned as a serious sin. 33 /Elfric, Catholic Homilies, I, 9 (251, 11. 49-50 and 67-9).</page><page sequence="10">718 ROSA MARIA FERA Naturalis,34 where he propounded a theory whereby taste and touch are sharpest in man, while the remaining three reach their highest levels in the eagle (vision), the vulture (smell), and the mole (hearing): Among the senses, that of touch in man ranks before all the other species, and taste next; but in the remaining senses he is surpassed by many other creatures. Eagles have clearer sight, vultures a keener sense of smell, moles acuter hearing -although they are buried in earth, so dense and deaf an element of nature [.. .].35 Medieval authors expanded Pliny's list of animals, so that each of the five senses would correspond to an animal.36 The reason behind this addition, according to Janson, lies in the fact that the Plinian distinction must have seemed dubious to the medieval mind: 'From the Christian standpoint man's superiority must not be measured by carnal qualities, such as the senses, it is the rational soul which distinguishes him from the animals'.37 In any case, the medieval addition of the spider and the ape completed the symbolic cycle, to be found in its entirety, although with different selections of animals, in later thirteenth-century works such as the Liber de Natura Rerum by Thomas de Cantimpré and Richard de Fournival's Bestiaire d'Amour.3S The association between sight and the lynx made by these later works must have drawn on a tradition known to the Anglo-Saxons. Pliny also represented an important source for bestiaries, collections of short de scriptions of animals accompanied by moralizing explanations, a genre that was very popular in the Middle Ages, but the textual traditions behind different groups of bestiaries are quite complex.39 Within the Old English corpus, we do 34 For evidence of knowledge of Pliny the Elder in Anglo-Saxon England, see L.

During the discussion of how all temporal goods are mixed with evil, we read: [...] äeah nu hwa seo swa fseger swa swa Alcibiadis se sjjeling waes; gif hwa bi&lt;3 swa scearpsene Ipset he maege hine J^urhsion (swa swa Aristotelis se uäwita sasde {jst [an] deor wasre jpxt mihte sic wuht jiurhseon ge treowa ge furäum stanas: jsast deor we hataö lox), gif jjonne hwa wsere swa scearpsiene Jsast he mihte ["»one cniht Jjurhseon J)e we xr ymbe spraecon, {jonne ne J)uhte he him no innon swa faeger swa he utan fjuhte.*'" [...] though now anyone should be as fair as Alcibiades the nobleman was, if anyone is so sharp-sighted, that he would be able to see through him (as Aristotle the philosopher said that an animal was, which could see through everything, both trees and even rocks; we call that animal lynx), if then anyone were so sharp-sighted that he could see through that young man that we spoke about before, then would he not seem inwardly as fair as he seemed outwardly. However, the Latin source reads differently: Quodsi, ut Aristoteles ait, Lyncei oculis homines uterentur, ut eorum visus obstantia penetraret, nonne introspectis uisceribus illud Alcibiadis superficie pulcherrimum corpus turpissimum uideretur?41 And if, as Aristotle says, men had Lynceus' eyes so that their sight could penetrate obs tacles, would they not judge that body of Alcibiades seeming outwardly most beautiful, to be most ugly by discovering his entrails? In the Latin source, Boethius quotes Aristotle's reference to the Argonaut Lynceus,42 whose sight was proverbial,43 whereas in the Old English version 40 See The Old English Boethius. An Edition of the Old English Versions of Boethius's De Consolatione Philosophiae, ed. M. Godden and S. Irvine, 2 vols (Oxford, 2009), i, 309, 11. 46-53. This passage is quoted from the B-text (the prosaic redaction preserved by Oxford, Bodleian Library, Bodley 180 (2079), rather than from the C-text (the prosimetrical version preserved in London, British Library, Cotton Otho A. vi). With regards to this passage, the phrase ge treowa ge furdum stanas is absent in the C-text; Godden and Irvine argue that it may be an addition by a reader confused as to what the object of purhsion was.

Ross (ed.), Aristotelis Fragmenta Selecta (Oxford, 1955), 40. The Greek philoso pher does not mention the lynx when discussing the senses in De Anima or in the De Sensu. See Aristotle, De Sensu et Sensihilibus, ed. W. D. Ross (Oxford, 1955). 43 Lynceus' extraordinary sight had been renowned at least since Pindar; see Pindari Carmina cum fragmentis, ed. B. Snell and H. Maehler, Bibliotheca scriptorum Graecorum et Romanorum Teubneriana (Leipzig, 1987), Nemean Odes X, 61-3; among the Fathers of the Church, we find mention of Lynceus' sight in Jerome, Contra Iohannem, ed. J. L. Feiertag, CCSL 79A (Turnhout, 1999), XXXV, 68-9, 11. 33-4: 'Lynceus, ut fabulae ferunt, uidebat trans parietem'; 'Lynceus, as stories report, saw through the walls'.</page><page sequence="12">720 ROSA MARIA FERA the translator associates sight with the lynx, not with Lynceus.44 What led the Anglo-Saxon translator to such innovation? It should not be considered a mistake or an 'intentional misattribution',45 like the well-known substitution of Boethius' reference to the Roman military hero Fabricius with the legendary Germanic smith Weland; in that case, the translator must have taken Fabricius as a reference to faber and thus introduced a smith. Godden and Irvine state that most gloss ators saw a reference to the lynx, not Lynceus, and argue in favour of the possi bility that the translator may have been following already existing interpretations: the glosses in two manuscripts from the tenth or eleventh century, Cambridge University Library, Kk.3.21 and Geneva, Bibliotheca Bodmeriana, Cod. 175 (and in one manuscript from the tenth or eleventh century, Paris, Bibliothéque Nationale de France, lat. 6401) record a tradition that the lynx could see through stone walls.47 However, the dynamics behind the replacement of lynx for Lynceus might be even simpler: modern editions agree that Lyncei refers to the Argonaut, but in the majority of the manuscripts preserving the Latin Boethius the text reads lynceis or lineéis, from the adjective lynceus, 'lynx-like'. It is therefore possible that the translator had a version of the text which preserved the latter reading. On the other hand, the association between sharp sight and the eagle, as estab lished by Pliny, occurs in two other literary traditions received by the Anglo Saxons: in the Old English Herbarium, the remedy suggested against dimness of the eyes reads: Wi3 eagena dymnesse ys ssd ¡Dst se earn, ¡xinne he up íleon wille to J)y Jjast he Jjy &lt;beorhtor&gt; geseon msge, jjast he wylle mid Jsam seawe his eagan hreppan &amp; wit tan. &amp; he J)urh J&gt;set onfehä J)a masstan beorhtnesse.50 Against the dimness of the eyes, it is said that the eagle, when it will fly up to the point that it may see more brightly, so that with that moisture it wets and treats its eyes, and through that it achieves the greatest sight. 44 Not very convincingly, Pastoreau suggests a play on words between linx and lux as the origin of the association; see Pastoureau, 'Le bestiaire des cinq sens', 133-45: 138. 45 M.

B. Taylor, 'Chaucer's eye of the lynx and the Limits of Vision', Chaucer Rev, 28 (1993), 67-77.

Dicitur, cum aquila altum vult volare ut prospiciat rerum naturam, lactucae silvaticae folium evellere et de suco sibi tangere oculos et accipere maximam claritatem. For the dimness of the eyes. It is said that when the eagle wants to fly high in order to see nature, it pulls out a leaf of wild lettuce and touches its eyes with its juice and achieves the greatest clarity. We also find clear sight paired with the eagle in the tradition stemming from the biblical association of the four evangelists with four animals, whereby John is asso ciated with the eagle.51 In later Old English prose, in particular in /Elfric's homilies, on a few occasions we find the additional detail of the eagle's sharp sight: &lt;Be&gt;&lt;himxgodxgeswutelode&gt; on Jjasre gastlican gesihSe, aerest [uirh Ezechiel &amp; eft on Apocalypsi, on earnes gelicnysse mid [jam o&lt;3rum godspellerum, Jsaet he mihte sceawian mid scearpum eagum on earnes gelicnysse be Jjses Hadendes godcundnysse, swa swa se earn sceawaä Jjaere sunnan leoman &lt;unateorigendumxeagum&gt; ofer eallum nytenum.52 By him, on that spiritual vision, first through Ezechiel and again in the Apocalypse, because of the similarity of the eagle with the other evangelists, God made known that he might see with sharp eyes, like the eagle, by the divinity of the Saviour, just as the eagle looks at the sunlight with unfailing eyes, superior to all creatures. Among the possible sources, Bede's exegesis of John's Gospel,53 and one of Haymo's homilies, have been suggested,54 but these passages may ultimately stem from Gregory's Moralia in Job, where the eagle's sight is also said to be superior to all other animals'.55 51 The Prophet Ezekiel had a vision of four beasts representing the evangelists: a lion (Mark), a calf (Luke), an eagle (John) and one in the appearance of a man (Matthew); see Ezekiel X.14.

However, Hoek points out specific associations: sound occurs only in the Panther, while touch only in the Whale.62 The absence of tactile perception in the former poem underlines the unearthly nature of the animal, which not only beorhtra ond scynra mundrum lixed, 'shines wonderfully more brightly and more splendidly' but is also endowed with stefn, a 'voice' rather than a roar.63 The visual and aural 56 As regards origins and transmission of the Physiologus and Bestiary traditions, see G. Orlandi, 'La tradizione del Physiologus ed i prodromi del bestiario latino', in L 'uomo di fronte al mondo anímale nell'Alto Medioevo, Settimane di Studio del Centro Italiano di Studi sull'Alto Medioevo, 31 (Spoleto, 198S), 1057-106. 57 Perhaps, the insertion of Isidore's material represented the bridge towards a re-structuring of the text on the grounds of the cosmological and naturalistic interests typical of the twelfth century; Orlandi, 'La tradizione', 1104-5. 58 They are the Y version (Bern, Lat. 611, 8th-9th century), A version (Brussels, Bib. Roy. 10074, 10th century), C version (Bern, Burgerbibliothek, lat. 318, 9th century) and B version (Bern, Lat. 233, 8th-9th century)'.

Dobbie (eds), The Exeter Book, The Anglo-Saxon Poetic Records 3 (New York, 1936), 169-74. In her work, Vinge states that the Physiologus was translated in vernacular languages from the eleventh century onwards, but the Old English Physiologus is supposed to have been composed between the mid-ninth and mid-tenth centuries; see L. Vinge, The Five Senses: Studies in a Literary Tradition (Lund, 1975), 47. 61 Since a leaf is missing in the manuscript and the last poem contains only sixteen lines, the identity of the bird is uncertain and it is impossible to tell whether a specific sense is prominent within the narration. On the other hand, the most recent edition of the Physiologus takes only the first two lines of the fragment traditionally interpreted as the third part of the tryptich, as treating the partridge; the rest is considered a homiletic fragment.

Both the Augustinian and the Gregorian traditions provide the Old English homiletic production with another animal to conceptualize the bodily senses as a whole: the ox.66 Drawing on the Parable of the Banquet,67 both Augustine and Gregory represent the five senses as five teams of oxen.68 Besides the metaphor of the oxen, it is worth pointing out that ¿Elfric's CH.II.23 employs the several pairs related to the sense of touch, which are to be encountered not only in the previous passage from Augustine's Confessiones, but also in the sermo dealing with the Parable.69 ¿Elfric's text reads: Ic bohte fif getymu oxena.

This encounter is very similar to that with the whale Jasconius in the tale of the voyage of Saint Brendan; see Selmer, Navigatio Sancti Brendani, 20-1. On the relationship between the two traditions, see D. Faraci, 'Navigatio Sancti Brendani and its relationship with Physiologus\ Romanobarbarica, 11 (1990—1), 149-73. 65 Major examples of this genre are the Aberdeen Bestiary (Aberdeen University Library MS 24), written and illuminated in England around 1200 or the contemporary Cambridge Bestiary (Cambridge University Library Ii. 4.26). See http://www.abdn.ac.uk/bestiary/ bestiary.hti. II Bestiario di Cambridge, ed. F. Zambón (Milan, 1974). 66 Another, albeit later, zoomorphic iconographic representation of the five senses displays the five senses as horses. It is to be found in the illustration of Alain de Lille's twelfth-century Anticlaudianus preserved in a late thirteenth-century manuscript (Biblioteca Capitolare of Verona, MS CCLI). For the text, see Alain de Lille, Anticlaudianus, PL 210, ed. J. P. Migne, 521C; the source of this allegory is to be found in Plato, Phaedrus, ed. R. Waterfield (Oxford, 2002), 246a, 470; see L. Konecny, 'I Cinque Sensi da Aristotele a Constantin Brancusi', in S. Ferino-Pagden (ed.), Immagini delsentire: I cinque sensi nell'arte (Cremona and Milano, 1996), 23—48. Similarities have been established between the Fuller Brooch's iconography and the drawings accompanying the Anticlaudianus; see F. Mütherich, 'An Illustration of the Five Senses in Mediaeval Art', Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes, 18 (1955), 140-1. 67 Luke XIV.16-24; R.

CCSL 141, 335-6,11.98-114). 69 These pairs are likely to derive from a passage in Aristotle's De Anima, 422b, 128, 11. 26-8. 70 /LIfric, Catholic Homilies, II, 23 (214-5, 11. 43-53).</page><page sequence="16">724 ROSA MARIA FERA I bought five teams of oxen. And I want to go to try them. The five teams betoken the five senses of our body, which are sight, hearing, taste, smell, touch. He who is healthy has these senses. Through our eyes we see and distinguish all things; through the ears we hear, in the mouth we have taste, and distinguish whether what we eat is sweet or bitter; through the nose we smell what is clean, what foul; in the hands and in all the body we have touch, that we may feel what is hard, what soft, what smooth, what unsmooth, and so everything. Although the treatment of the five senses derives from Augustine's sermon,71 Godden points out that the basic exegesis in this passage probably derives from Gregory the Great.72 The fact that /Elfric does not follow Augustine's ranking of the senses, instead listing taste earlier than smell confirms the Gregorian influence. The medieval way of ranking the senses seems to draw on more than one trad ition:73 one of these traditions is thought to originate from Aristotle,74 and to have been inherited by Cicero. In De Natura Deorum, drawing on a Platonic allegory,75 Cicero presents Balbus, representative of the Stoic philosophy, speaking of how fittingly Providence has created men: Next, the senses, posted in the citadel of the head as the reporters and messengers of the outer world, both in structure and position are marvellously adapted to their necessary services. The eyes as the watchmen have the highest station, to give them the widest outlook for the performance of their function. The ears also, having the duty of perceiving sound, the nature of which is to rise, are rightly placed in the upper part of the body. The nostrils likewise are rightly placed high inasmuch as all smells travel upwards [...]. Taste [...] is situated in that part of the face where nature has made an aperture for the passage of food and drink. The sense of touch is evenly diffused over all the body, to enable us to perceive all sorts of contacts and even the smallest impacts of both cold and heat.lb This hierarchy of the senses seems to have been embraced by some early Christian authors such as Lactantius, who considers the five senses proof of Creation's perfection; both Cicero and Lactantius follow a ranking which, after sight, lists in order hearing, smell, taste and touch.'7 On the other hand, according to Dronke, a second way of ranking the senses would go back to early medieval 71 The previously quoted passage from the Confessiones, slightly simpler than the discussion in Augustine's sermon, also seems to be very close to /Elfric's wording. 72 See /Elfric, Catholic Homilies, Commentary (ed. Godden, 551). 73 P. Dronke, 'Les cinq sens chez Bernard Silvestre et Alain de Lille' in I cinque sensi, 1-15: 4. 74 Interestingly, Aristotle claims that there is an odd number of senses, and an odd number has a middle; the sense of smell comes midway between the tactile senses (touch and taste) and those that operate through a medium (sight and hearing). See Aristotle, De Sensu V, 445 a 4 ff. 75 Plato, Timaeus and Kritias, ed. A. E. Taylor (London, 1929), 70 A. 76 Cicero, De Natura Deorum, ed. and trans. H. Rackham, 2nd edn.

A search performed through the CETEDOC database shows that Augustine follows the Ciceronian tradition in the majority of cases.</page><page sequence="17">METAPHORS FOR THE FIVE SENSES IN OLD ENGLISH PROSE 725 authors like Gregory the Great78 and Rabanus Maurus.79 Indeed /Elfric draws con sistendy on the Gregorian way of ranking the senses, a consistency confirmed by all the excerpts quoted so far.80 Finally, the motif of the soundness of the body brought about by the five senses, which emerges from the /Elfrician excerpt independently from the source, occurs frequently in the homiletic corpus; as I will indicate below, this might be significant in the interpretation of the Anglo-Saxon Fuller Brooch, which provides us with the first iconographic representation of the senses. IV. The Five Senses and Human Shapes Surprisingly, there seems to be a complete lack of iconographic representations of the five senses in both classical and late antique art, and even during the first centuries of the Middle Ages they are extremely rare. The earliest specimen preserved is the widely known Anglo-Saxon Fuller Brooch, probably dating from the late ninth century,83 and now preserved at the British Museum (Fig. 2).84 The interpretations of the function of the brooch range from Nordenfalk's suggestion, taking the brooch as a love gift,85 or as a talisman,86 to the proposal elaborated by Pratt, who relates the brooch's iconography to wisdom and to the concept of the modes eagan, the 'eyes of the mind', respectively.87 Interestingly, the figure 78 Gregory the Great, Homiliae in Evangelio, IX, 1 (ed. CCSL 141, 59,11. 17-18); Homiliae in Hezechihelem prophetam, ed. M. Adriaen, CCSL 142 (Turnhout, 1971), II.v.9, 282, 11. 234-5. 79 In fact, the latter author does not rank taste before smell consistently. See, for instance, Rabanus Maurus, Commentaria in Genesim, ed. J. P. Migne, PL 107,1, 6, 474D; J. P. Migne (ed.) De Universo, PL 111, VI, 1, 143C, and Commentaria in Libros IV Regum, ed. J. P. Migne, PL 111, III, 6, 147B, where olfactus precedes gustus. 80 G. Schleusener-Eichholz, Das Auge im Mittelalter, Münstersche Mittelalter-Schriften, 35 (München, 1985), 201. No distinction between such different traditions is delineated by Schleusener in her exhaustive monograph on the eye in the Middle Ages; she simply takes the order of succession visus, audi tus, odoratus, gustus, tactus as the most common. Besides Augustine, we find the order odoratus/ olfactus-gustus in Isidore, Etymologiarum siue Originum libri XX, ed. W. M. Lindsay (Oxford, 1911), XI.i.18 and in De Dijferentiis Rerum, ed. J. P.

In any case, the iconography employs human figures to highlight each of the senses, rather than employing metaphorical shapes. The uniqueness of the brooch's iconography has been questioned by Gannon, who attributes a complex significance to the coins belonging to the so-called Series K, probably minted in Kent in the eighth century (Fig. 3).91 Five types among them would represent the five senses in relation to Salvation. " According to Gannon, the series of coins addresses the question of supremacy amongst the senses in a very sophisticated way; the iconography of a sixth type of coin, pre served in a unique specimen, would represent a sixth sense, 'speech'. However, series K would be distinguished from another series, Series L, only on the grounds of the feature of the knots in the hair of the human figure on the coins. Otherwise, the coins are very similar in style and design and more elements would be needed in order to distinguish groups, periods or mints within series K and L; there is no 88 Questioning the interpretations of the figure on the jewel as representing Christ, the pope or the king himself, Bakka interprets it as a servant, which, being identified as sight, may be intended as a 'servant of the mind'; E.

This fascinating theory had already been expounded in her previous work: The Iconography of Early Anglo-Saxon Coinage: Sixth to Eighth Centuries (Oxford, 2003), 187-9. 93 Gannon parallels this to Pratt's interpretation of the representation of sight on the Fuller Brooch and states that the many levels of resonance and allusion in the iconography suggest that 'just as in the case of the Fuller Brooch, the coins offer not a mere listing of the senses, but a highly sophisticated and multivalent commentary'; see Gannon, 'The Five Senses', 100-1.</page><page sequence="19">METAPHORS FOR THE FIVE SENSES IN OLD ENGLISH PROSE 727 Fig. 3. a) Sight; b) Hearing; c) Smell; d) Taste; e) Touch.

Therefore, more evi dence would be needed to prove that a specific person at a specific time was undertaking this programme of iconography; they could just be variations under taken over a long period of time. Whether or not Gannon's interpretation ought to be accepted is still debatable; if it were to be accepted, the iconographic 94 See D. M.

Moreover, the role of the senses within the salvation process would entirely fit the approach to the senses emerging from the vernacular literature. In addition to the interpretation of the central figure, what is slightly contro versial about the Fuller Brooch is also the dislocation of the senses; Dronke, following Bruce-Mitford,95 claims that, after sight, the order of the other senses seems to show gustus preceding olfactus, rather than following the ordinary sequence inherited from Cicero. However, the assumption that gustus precedes olfactus on the brooch is questionable, because except for the priority given to sight, the other four senses seem to be equally attributed a space on the brooch, with no specific order. Looking at the way the five senses are listed in Old English literary texts, the Alfredian texts do not seem to follow any particular ranking, but as we have seen, the order followed within the /Klfrician corpus and in glossed prayers differs from Cicero's traditional one.96 This shows that the tradition listing taste before smell, inherited from Gregory the Great, was more influential on late Anglo-Saxon prose.97 In terms of literary evidence for anthropomorphic representations of the senses, Pratt points out a parallel between the Fuller Brooch and a Latin riddle composed by the Mercian scholar Tatwine, where the senses are personified by five brothers tending a temple: Nos quiñi uario fratres sub nomine templum Concessum nobis colimus constanter ab ortu. Nam thuris segetem fero, fercula et ille saporis, Hie totum presens affert tangi, ille uidendum, Ast laetam quintus famam tristemque ministrat.98 Constantly, we five brothers with different names have tended a temple since it was en trusted to us. One of us provides fragrance, another presents tasty dishes, another every thing tangible, still another, the visible, and the fifth brings home good and bad news. Moreover, in his commentary on John's gospel, Alcuin interprets the five hus bands in John IV. 10 firstly as the books of the Pentateuch, and alternatively as the five senses;99 in vernacular, /Elfric points out the correspondence between the number of senses and the wise and foolish virgins: Deos andwerde gelaöung |ie underfehä yfele and gode. Is wiömeten 9am tyn maedenum. Basra wseron fif stunte. And fif snotere; On fif andgitum / swa swa we eow oft saedon. 95 Bruce-Mitford, 'Late Saxon Disc-Brooches', 187. 96 The Alfredian texts vary every time the five senses are mentioned. 97 When describing the perfection of number five in his Enchiridion, Byrhtferth also lists the senses in the Gregorian way.

With five senses, as we have often said to you, every man lives that has his health; that is, sight and hearing, taste and smell and touch. These five senses, if they are doubled, will then complete a tenfold number. The reiterated emphasis on good health brought about by the soundness of the five senses is even highlighted by yElfric himself, who states it is a point he made several times: such emphasis shows a concern not only for the effects of the use of the senses on the inner self, but also for an aspect of human physiology. We have already come across the Ciceronian anthropomorphic meta phor whereby the senses are represented as messengers of the citadel of the head and the eyes as watchmen, an image which is employed by the Fathers of the Church: in the Exaemeron, Ambrose also displays the 'besieged city' as the headquarters of the bodily senses, and likewise compares the eyes to watchmen. Specula enim semper ex alto est, ut aduenientium cateruarum hostilium explorari possit aduentus, ne inprouiso occupent otiantem uel urbis populum uel imperatoris exercitum. For the watch-tower is always at a high point, so that one can discover the arrival of approaching enemy troops, so they do not attack suddenly the people of the town or the army of the emperor unprepared. In Old English prose the image of the besieged city does not occur in this respect, but a metaphor based on the physical location of the eyes is to be found in the Old English version of Gregory's Regula Pastoralis, where, because of their position, the eyes exert a leading role. The source reads: 'Oculi quippe sunt, qui in ipsa honoris summi facie positi, providendi itineris officium susceperunt: quibus hi nimirum qui subsequenter inhaerent dorsa nominantur'; 'For the 'eyes' are those who, set in the forefront of the highest dignity, have undertaken the duty of showing the way, while those who follow on and are attached to them are termed 'the back'.102 The Old English version of the text reads: Soälice &lt;3a eagan äaet beoä äa lareowas, &amp; se hrygc äset sint äa hieremenn; foräan 5a eagan bioä on 3am lichoman foreweardum &amp; ufeweardum, &amp; se hrycg faerä asfter aelcre wuhte; Sua gaä äa lareowas beforan 3asm folce, &amp; äaet folc asfter.103 100 ¿Elfric, Catholic Homilies, II, 39 (328, 11. 32-9). 101 See Ambrose, Exameron, ed.

In an original way, the eyes are imagined as teachers precisely because of their location in the body, and the translator innovatively personifies them;104 the at tribution of such a leading role to sight matches its superiority among the other senses, which we have encountered in both the literature and the iconography. The examination of the literary passages dealing with the senses within the broader Anglo-Saxon cultural context, particularly in relation to the iconographic representations, has shown that sight is consistently given priority over the other senses. The reason for such superiority lies in the relationship between sight, with its powerful cognitive potential, and the acquisition of knowledge. Indeed, the interaction between visual perception and the acquisition of intellectual knowledge can be defined as specular: the faculty of sight derives its superiority from the affinity with intellectual knowledge; conversely, intellectual knowledge defines itself in terms of visual perception.105 This specular structure lies at the heart of the literary opposition of eyes of the body and of the mind, which expresses through a powerful dual image the dichotomy of physical and intellectual sight. The importance of the eyes of the mind and of the body within the present study resides in the fact that such ancillary conceptualization fully coincides with the analogous, broader one of outer and inner senses that I have outlined. The reference to intellectual as well as physical perception within the polysemous nouns employed to indicate the senses is evident not only on linguistic grounds, but also as a result of a philosophical and literary tradition deriving from patristic sources, which has been received and enhanced in Old English prose. The par ticular use of accompanying adjectives in the texts examined confirms the Anglo Saxon scholars' wish for the establishment of an effective opposition between the intellectual and physical counterparts. The emphasis placed by Anglo-Saxon authors on the dualism of inner and outer senses may also be attributed to the fact that this theme allowed them to discuss cognitive issues such as the mutual relationship between the inner self and the outside world. Moreover, another type of dualism is to be seen in the twofold conception of the senses, particularly in ¿Elfric: a negative one, confirmed by the warnings against their sinful use and the admissions of their inferiority compared to the spiritual senses, and a positive one, which encourages their use as 104 In Anglo-Latin literature, we do find discussions of the sort; see, for instance, Bede, Libri quattuor in principium Genesis, ed.

Spinosa defines this structure as chiastic, but specular seems to be more appropriate.</page><page sequence="23">METAPHORS FOR THE FIVE SENSES IN OLD ENGLISH PROSE 731 instruments of personal inner growth. They can be instruments of temptation or sin, as when represented as oxen, or alternatively, shillings with which to redeem sin, talents to multiply, or even teachers for the people. The representation of the sense-organs as gateways clearly exemplifies their bivalent nature because of their liminal position. Whether conceptualized as objects, animals or human beings, the number of forms taken on by the five senses proves the great attraction and, at the same time, the mistrust felt towards them.
