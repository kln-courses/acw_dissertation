<plain_text><page sequence="1">Bir-kot-ghwandai, Swat, Pakistan. 1998-1999 Excavation Report by Pierfrancesco Callieri, Luca Colliva, Roberto Micheli, Abdul Nasir &amp; Luca Maria Olivieri To the memory of Professor Maurizio Taddei After investigations in the flat area at the foot of the Bir-kot hill (Barikot, Swat, Pakistan) had been suspended in 1992 to tackle the problem of site protection through permanent acquisition by the Department of Archaeology, Government of Pakistan, 1998 saw excavations at Barikot by the IsIAO Italian Archaeological Mission resumed on the top of the hill, which had been thoroughly surveyed in 1992 and 1993 (Olivieri, forthcoming). The first campaign, which started in the August 1998 and was to have continued during the Autumn, was abruptly brought to an end by the sudden turmoil in Swat occurring with acute worsening of the international political scenario centred on Afghanistan. Excavations were then resumed in the following 1999 campaign, and lasted from August 7th to September 5th, and then from October 30th to November 18th. Works of the 1998 and August-September 1999 campaign were directed by Mr Luca Maria Olivieri, with the assistance of Mr Roberto Micheli, draughtsman, and the fruitful collaboration of Mr Abdul Nasir, the representative of the Department of Archaeology and Museums, Government of Pakistan. The 1998 excavation regarded both the terraces on the top of the hill. On the Western Terrace, a trench measuring * The report which we publish here has been conceived by the late Professor Maurizio Taddei, formerly Leader of the Italian Archaeological Mission, whose interest in the post-Gandharan art of the Indo-Iranian frontier had been stimulated by the unique characteristics of the fragments of stucco decoration of the monumental building brought to light by Luca Maria Olivieri and Roberto Micheli during the 1998 campaign. His support to our idea of concentrating the efforts of the Barikot field team on this unique monument was full, and fully rewarded by the photographs and drawings which he saw in Rome at the end of the 1999 campaign, last December. A few days before his untimely demise he had suggested us to write a preliminary report on East and West, with the aim of introducing our discovery to the art-historians and archaeologists working in this field. While preparing for the next campaing, which we hope to carry on at Barikot in September-October 2000, we wish to keep the promise and offer this paper, along with the excavation itself, to the memory of our teacher. [1] 191</page><page sequence="2">10.00 x 10.00 m was cut in the central part of the terrace (Trench BKG 7), whereas a second trench measuring 12.00 x 4.00 m aimed at ascertaining the stratigraphic situation at the NW corner of the terrace (Trench BKG 8). On the Eastern Terrace a trench was dug at the NE corner of a monumental building which had been partially exposed by clandestine excavators (Trench BKG 6.1). Apart from emptying some of the pits dug by treasure hunters along the W and N sides of the monumental building, the 1999 campaign was concentrated on the Western Terrace, with the aim of understanding the nature and function of the wall brought to light during the previous campaign. Here a long trench (24.00 x 4.00 m) was cut, running from the bottom of the rock spur at the foot of the hill as far as the NW limit of the terrace (Trench BKG 9). The excavations of October-November 1999 were directed by Dr Pierfrancesco Callieri, with the assistance of Mr Luca Colliva, archaeologist, Mr Francesco Martore, draughtsman, and Miss Maria Cristina Passed, conservator; also on this occasion the team enjoyed the fruitful collaboration of Mr Abdul Nasir, representative of the Department of Archaeology and Museums, Government of Pakistan. Work concentrated on the area of Trench BKG 6, where two areas along the monumental building were selected for excavation: the W half of the S side, in which a trench measuring 12.50 (E-W) x 7.50 m (N-S) was excavated (Trench BKG 6.2), and the central section of the E side, where the excavated area measures 9.50 (N-S) x 6.00 m (E-W) (Trench BKG 6.3). (P.C.) The Hilltop The upper part of the Barikot hill, immediately below the top, is characterized by two artificial terraces to the W and E, contained by a huge supporting structure (Olivieri 1996a: 96). This entirely surrounds the hilltop except for the southern limestone cliff. The massive nature of the work is particularly evident in the W-N-E quadrants of the hilltop, where it rises sheer over the course of the river Swat. In the median segment of the N stretch, the substruction retreats considerably in an upstream direction where a deep gully opens: in this way, two terraces are formed that are practically joined together by a narrow passage. The two escarped corners of the substruction are particularly massive, to the NW (with diaper masonry using blocks and slabs, with obvious repairs using slabs, wall S.U. (*) 143, Fig. 8) and to the NE (wall S.U. 130). The latter (Fig. 1) has an imposing appearance: an external foundation base is visible directly supported by the rock outcrop, consisting of a vertical lower body and an upper escarped one (h. 4.00 m). Above this base, with i1) S.U. = Stratigraphic Unit. 192 [2]</page><page sequence="3">an offset of c. 0.8 m, the high supporting wall rises, also escarped, but much closer to the vertical (h. 12.00 m). The masonry technique used for the facing of the wall is the diaper type, with carefully laid blocks and small slabs. Occasionally a variety of travertine is used, known as kanjur or kankar, not found in Swat but usually quarried in the northwest Punjab; here it is used in the form of squared blocks (c. 0.35 x0.20x0.10 m). In addition to these well-conserved monumental sections, a few rows of rough diaper work in the circuit walls, which grow thinner in places and have gaps, have been conserved and fill the spaces, between one rock and another, forming straight sections alternating with semi-cylindrical bastions. Similar structures have been found also on the W side of the gully. The thorough reconnaissance work carried out on the hill in 1992 and 1993 suggested the hypothesis that the more important sections of the substruction work (i.e. that of construction of the two artificial terraces) were earlier and related to the building of embankments to bear public buildings, while the sections lying in the W-SW-S-SE quadrants, as well as on the W side of the gully, belonged to a later phase associated with the phase of defensive specialization of the hill area, and taking in the preceding substruction walls. The hypothetical existence of public buildings on the hilltop was immediately taken into consideration by the discoverer of the ruins on the Barikot hill, Sir A. Stein. He postulated (Stein 1930: 21), on the basis of the shape of the two mounds visible in the centre of each of the two terraces, that they were st?pa remains (also because of the numerous finds of schist fragments of Gandhara school decoration). Also of the same idea was G. Tucci, who gave an extensive description of the Barikot hilltop in his Report on the 1956 Swat reconnaissance (Tucci 1958). He went as far as to hypothesize that the hill was a sort of acropolis or basileion for the city of Bazira which, in agreement with Stein, he identified on the flat land S of the hill (ibid.: 298).

Trench BKG 7 This trench (10.00 x 10.00 m; N-S alignment) (2) was dug close to the second mound on the large flat area of the W terrace (Fig. 2). The W terrace is bounded to the N by an ancient substruction wall, S.U. 143, associated with the same building work as the E terrace substruction wall (S.U. 130). The earliest levels attained reveal a stratigraphy datable to the protohistoric era (BKG 7 la, b): the rocky bed of the hill displayed a few natural pits (Fig. 3), inside which deposit layers were found, the bottom ones (BKG 7 la) containing ceramic fragments that may provisionally be attributed to Period IV of the Ghalegay sequence (corresponding to the Chalcolithic). The upper layers, on the contrary (BKG 7 lb), conserve potsherds and other material attributable to Period VII of the pre-protohistoric sequence of Swat (c. 8th-4th century B.C.), in particular, a set of bone potter's tools (Fig. 4, Inv. nos. BKG 1843, 1844, 1883-1886; cf. Stacul 1993: 89, fig. 27j-n). Dated to the following Period BKG 7 II is the construction of a large wall (S.U. 78) made of slabs and above all pebbles, with a thickness of c. 2.50 m (E-W alignment), conserved up to an elevation of only a few courses because subsequently robbed (Fig. 3). The stratigraphy of the wall construction and its life is extremely scarce as it was substantially damaged by later intervention: the wall was built directly on the surface ground, with no foundation trench; at a later stage it was flanked by a small room of which too small a portion has been discovered to be able to understand what it was. In any case, the pottery contemporary with the wall's construction and (2) For lack of time the area of investigation for Periods BKG 7 I-III had to be restricted: a 5 x 5 m trial trench was therefore used in the SW quadrant of BKG 7. 194 [4]</page><page sequence="5">life is extremely significant: its fabric is depurated and well fired, displays refined shapes with handles and incised floral decoration (BKG 1900); in this phase, two artefacts were found which are fairly frequently in early historic phases, namely pyramid-shaped terracotta weights (Fig. 5, Inv. nos. BKG 1845 and BKG 1908; cf. the materials found in the so-called Greek levels at Shaikhan Dheri: Dani 1965-66: 116, pi. XLIIb). The following Period III was characterized by an intense building activity, accompanied by the presence in the stratification of large lenses and substantial accumulations of stone chips, traces of chiselling that suggest a building site activity. The aim of this activity was probably to dismantle wall S.U. 78 in order to re-utilize the stone material (Fig. 14). Several sterile stratigraphic units above this apparently indicate a phase of abandonment of the area. In Periods IV and V, the area was completely unsheltered, with numerous holes dug in the ground's surface; on the latter are very thin accumulation layers consisting of ash and compacted powder lenses (Fig. 13). The pottery horizon displays impressed decoration and large black and white painted bands decoration, while there are no zoomorphic spouts, vitreous paste bracelets or glazed ceramic fragments: these elements lead to a dating to the Shahi, and in any case pre-Islamic, period. The subsequent period of occupation (Period VI) is subdivided into four phases (from the earliest: Via, b, c, d). Phase Via displays a large open area with a single room delimited by walls S.U. 15 and S.U. 18. On the outside there is a very highly compacted floor with traces of a fireplace partially covered with a verandah, as suggested by the presence of a pillar base (which will continue to be used in the later Phase VIb). Phase VIb is characterized by L-shaped rooms, with a verandah lying along wall S.U. 6 (Fig. 11). Over most of the trench Phase Vic is cut by a large dump pit of Phase VId (S.U. 9): we have here an open area, possibly a courtyard, onto which several rooms Fig. 3 - Trench BKG 7: at bottom, natural pits with protohistoric material; above, in centre, Period II wall S.U. 78.

In Phase Vic, wall S.U. 25 did not exist and the verandah was L-shaped: as suggested by the position of the wooden post holes, it covered the space in front of the two walls S.U. 15 and S.U. 16. In the verandah-enclosed space circular grindstones were found in situ; S of the structure a small compacted earth road ran in from the E to the uncovered courtyard, in which a rough stone enclosure (S.U. 31), perhaps for animals, was found (Fig. 10). In Phase VId the area displayed an external room delimited by walls S.U. 18, S.U. 15, S.U. 6 and S.U. 20; walls S.U. 20 and S.U. 6 in particular delimit a room that was not excavated as most of it lies outside the trench limits. Walls S.U. 15 and S.U. 18 form an L-shaped structure open towards the courtyard. The small wall S.U. 25 was situated on the short side of the L-shaped structure, and probably formed the side of a short verandah lying along the wall S.U. 15 (the short side of the 'L') and of which a wooden post hole was found (Fig. 9). From the point of view of materials analysis, there is a comparative homogeneity with those found in Period II of Trench BKG 6, and the pottery horizon seems to be the same (as attested also by an entire [7] 197</page><page sequence="8">Fig. 7 - Trench BKG 8: Period I painted sherd, Inv. no. BKG 1903. (Scale 1:2; drawing R. Micheli). kuza shape, Inv. no. BKG 1757); there are numerous fragments of glazed ceramics and vitreous paste bracelets (Inv. nos. BKG 1806-1817, 1819-1827) as well as painted black band spouts. In its materials and settlement typology, the later occupation period (Period VII) may be compared with Period III in BKG 6: small rough walls with dump areas (mainly consisting of food remains, bones bearing traces of butchering and late-Islamic potsherds; in particular, two fragments of glass tea-glasses Inv. nos. BKG 1744 and BKG 1745, and the zoomorphic spouts Inv. nos. BKG 1781-1785) and traces of fireplaces. In all probability these represented areas of seasonal settlement of individual pastoral families. The presence of utensils and items associated with domestic life, such as fragments of vitreous paste bracelets, numerous beads, as well as the finding of a spindle-whorl (Inv. no. BKG 1750) and a whetstone (Inv. no. BKG 1751) make this a plausible hypothesis. (L.M.O. &amp; R.M.) Trench BKG 8 In order to investigate the stratigraphic relations between the internal zone of the W terrace (Trench BKG 7) and the external one, it was decided to perform a sondage straddling the substruction wall S.U. 143 running NNW-SSE (12.00 x 4.00 m; Fig. 6). 198 [8]</page><page sequence="9">Fig. 8 - Trench BKG 8: at bottom, Period II wall S.U. 39; above, Period III wall S.U. 143. (Photo L.M. Olivieri). Fig. 9 - Trench BKG 8: Period IV graves. (Photo L.M. Olivieri). Wall S.U. 143 was built directly on the rock or the ground, without any foundation trench. The finding of elements typical of the early-historic periods, such as pyramidal clay weights (from here Inv. no. BKG 1904), together with later materials associated with the construction phases of S.U. 143, seems to indicate that also this structure probably had an early-historic phase (Period III), which was disturbed and completely robbed in operations involved in the construction of the contemporary large substruction wall (structural phase identified in BKG 7 II and BKG 9 III). Two protohistoric periods are instead well conserved: Period I (which apparently corresponds to Period la of BKG 7) yielded an interesting Chalcolithic painted pottery fragment (Fig. 7), while Period II (which apparently corresponds to Period lb in BKG 7) it is attested by a small wall (Fig. 8) and several pottery finds. S.U. 24 represents the cut-off between a more recent phase and the earlier phases: in this thick layer (which attests a phase of abandonment of the area outside [9]</page><page sequence="10">the walls: Period IV), referring to the ground level outside the substruction wall S.U. 143, and which corresponds to the lower limit of a large bulge in S.U. 143, two graves were found (plus traces of a third) containing buried bodies, with a NNW-SSE alignment (Fig. 9); the graves are shallow and covered by what must have been a small elongated tumulus: the bones of the skeleton, in particular the skulls, seem to have been crushed. The bodies were laid supine, slightly inclined on the right flank, with ankles crossed and wrists crossed over the pelvic region. These burials represent the Period V of the sequence (probably corresponding to Period II in BKG 6 and Period VI in BKG 7). Belonging to later phases are a series of accumulation layers, containing traces of minor collapses (Period VI) covered by the stones of more recent collapses of wall S.U. 143 (Period VII) and, on the surface, by a thick layer of earth and ashes. The phase represented by Periods V, VI and VII is characterized by finds and potsherds of an evident Islamic horizon. Corresponding to the periods of this phase are also several structures identified inside the terrace associated with the structure buried under the adjacent mound. (L.M.O. &amp; R.M.) Trench BKG 9 In 1999 it was decided to again explore the W terrace area for the following purposes: i) to gain a more thorough knowledge of the stratigraphy related to the protohistoric phases unearthed in BKG 7 (Period la, b) and BKG 8 (Periods I and II); ii) investigate the structure S.U. 78 in BKG 7 and endeavour to elucidate its function and chronology (Period II); iii) to understand the relation between the terrace stratigraphy and the rocky slope on the secondary peak; iv) to explore the mound arising out of the terrace. For these reasons, it was decided to dig a long trench (BKG 9; 24.00 x 4.00 m; NW-SE alignment, Figs. 10-12) that, starting from the rocky outcrops of the W counter hill, extended as far as the centre of the mound, passing beside the bulk of BKG 7 in such a way as to certainly take in wall S.U. 78, which had been unearthed here the previous years. The earliest occupation level, separated from the following one by a phase of abandonment, is attested by Period I, unearthed in the N sector, evidenced by a large, partially excavated well, with vertical walls and flat bottom, dug out of the clay in the natural soil of the hillside. A post hole was discovered beside the well. On the strength of the finds (including two bone points, Inv. nos. BKG 2013 and BKG 2015, cf. Stacul 1993: 82, fig. 27d-i; 1995: 119, fig. 9i) this period may definitely be related to Period la in BKG 7 and Period I in BKG 8 (Chalcolithic). Period II, subdivided into two main construction phases, is characterized by traces of a simple dwelling, found in the N sector, consisting of narrow walls and roofed parts supported by posts (the holes of which have been discovered). The 200 [10]</page><page sequence="11">Fig. 10 - Trench BKG 9: general view from N; in the foreground, Period VI structures; at centre, NW corner of Period III wall S.U. 78. (Photo L.M. Olivieri). Fig. 11 - Trench BKG 9: general view from S; in the foreground, outcropping rock of the mountain; in the background, Period VII wall S.U. 2. (Photo L.M. Olivieri). cultural horizon is the same as Period lb in BKG 7 and Period II in BKG 8 (Iron Age). Period II is separated from Period III by a sterile phase. Period III is characterized by the presence of wall S.U. 78 (Fig. 10), previously excavated in trench BKG 7. Also in this case very little of the wall is left owing to the robbing work probably attested by the Period IV stratigraphy: a few rows of stones and pebbles. The wall was constructed (BKG 9 Ilia) using the outcropping rock on the spur: the rock was also recessed to allow the stones to be seated better; when not resting on the rock, the underlying portion was supported by the accumulation layers cut by the erosion and displaying a northward sloping profile. The portion of wall excavated corresponds to part of the inner face of the section aligned E-W (the same wall as that excavated in BKG 7) and part of another section aligned N-S, which form an angle; the inner structure of the wall abounds in pebbles, while on its facing side the slabs seem to prevail. Outside the wall (to the N) the ancient ground level, [11] 201</page><page sequence="12">9VBm ^^^^^^^ Fig. 12 - Trench BKG 9: plan and N-S cross-section. (Drawing R. Micheli).</page><page sequence="13">sloping northward, has been unearthed. Inside the corner, on the other hand, the situation is completely different (Phase Illb). Large boulders and rocks mark the ancient profile on the NW crest, which runs down from the W secondary peak towards the river. In Phase IIIc, probably for the purpose of facilitating access to the NW corner of the wall, the area underwent a number of modifications: a carefully executed cobblestone paving was laid down in the inner corner of the wall, while some slabs were laid edgewise to reinforce the wall; low walls in the guise of steps were used to facilitate passage among the close-set rocks and to gain access to the cobbled area, thus forming a kind of path. From the point of view of the cultural horizon, the context is without doubt the same as in Period II in BKG 7 (this is confirmed, for example, by the finding of a pyramidal weight Inv. no. BKG 2006, to which must be added the other, Inv. no. BKG 1987, found in the filling of the holes dug to extract clay in BKG 9, Period IV). Period IV, like Period III in BKG 7, is characterized by the remains of an intense building activity, as attested by thick layers of stone chips and large holes dug in order to extract clay from the aceramic natural layer outcropping to the S amid the erratically arranged boulders of the ridge. The following Period V appears as the occupation of the external area that, among the rocky outcrops, is delimited on the downhill side by two low walls (S.U. 22 and 23) outside which a ground level has been unearthed that is characterized by numerous stones laid flat, as though to form a rough paving. The most important find consists of a series of terracotta animal figurines (Inv. nos. BKG 1969, BKG 1970 and BKG 1971), two fragments of a leg with anthropomorphic decoration referring to two different terracotta tripods (Inv. nos. BKG 1979 and BKG 1959; the latter are to be compared with a similar one found in an uncertain stratigraphic context of Period VI, Inv. no. BKG 1951); one further element, which is useful at least as a terminus post quern, is a schist Gandharan figurative relief of a seated Buddha flanked by donors (Inv. no. BKG 1977), having counterparts in the numerous fragments of Gandharan sculptures found during the survey of the hill and in the fragment Inv. no. BKG 1936 found in the filling of the well in trench BKG 6. Period VI is represented by two phases. Phase Via is characterized by the outcropping of rocky bed of the hill: in the spaces between the rocks there are still traces of sporadic settlements in the form of heaps of ash, fireplaces, a pit filled with ash and charcoal. Phase VIb is represented by an open area with no structures that is marked by the flow of run-off water, on which were found boulders having become detached from the W secundary peak of the hill during an earthquake; this phase displays traces of occupation indicating a small-size settlement characterized by fireplaces (in one case with a firescreen made of stone slabs laid vertically). The cultural horizon may theoretically be defined as of the Shahi period: we find potsherds decorated with black painted bands, but also with black and white painted bands or golden-colour; handles appear. Of special interest are a spout with zoomorphic protome (makara, Inv. no. BKG 1856), a fragment of the body of a black painted [13] 203</page><page sequence="14">band vase with a bat protome (Inv. no. BKG 1950), a fragment of decorated clay brick partially fired (Inv. no. BKG 1858; cf. similar find Inv. no. BKG 1717 in BKG 6, Period I) and a copper coin of Vakkadeva (Inv. no. BKG 1960; cf. Abdur Rahman 1979: IV, 11-12). The material also includes several highly corroded protohistoric potsherds without doubt resulting from the erosion and exposure of layers situated uphill of Trench BKG 9; these fragments were actually found in the S sector of the trench, near the rocky ridge. The superficial stratigraphy (Periods VII and VIII) suggests that the building buried under the mound collapsed and now displays a series of sporadic occupation layers with the same characteristics as those found in the preceding trenches (in particular, see Period VII). In Period VII a large massive rectangular podium (S.U. 2, Fig. 11) was built with facing in diaper masonry, unearthed under the mound (10.00 x 8.00 m, NW-SE alignment). The podium was constructed directly on the ground surface, without any foundation trench. The cultural horizon associated with the stratigraphy related to this building (it consists of external flat areas, with no structures, which slope upwards towards the S in the direction of the W secondary peak of the hill) dates to the Islamic period and is comparable with Period II in BKG 6, with Period VI in BKG 7 and with Periods IV and V in BKG 8. (L.M.O.) Trench BKG 6 The Sacred Building After two brief campaigns many questions still remain unsolved, but it is possible to trace out an architectural description of the imposing architectural complex occupying the whole of the Eastern Terrace on the top of the hill, which we have named 'Sacred Building* (see infra) (Fig. 13). The Eastern Terrace and the Sacred Building are closely connected in that the first was created in order to create enough space for the latter, as evidenced by two elements in particular. First of all, the main axis of the Sacred Building (E-W) is exactly parallel to the N side of the Terrace, so that the Terrace was built keeping in mind the orientation of the Sacred Building. Secondly, the Sacred Building lies directly on top of the Terrace filling to the E and directly on the rock bed of the mountain to the W, no evidence of any previous anthropic layer having been detected: the complex seems therefore to represent the first occupation of this part of the top of the hill (Period I). The simplest deduction from these elements is that the Terrace was built in order to enlarge the top of the hill artificially and make construction of the Sacred Building possible. At the same time, the fact that the rectangular space of the Terrace is not parallel to the rock spurs of the mountain suggests that the E-W 204 [14]</page><page sequence="15">Fig. 13 - Trench BKG 6: the Sacred Building, view from SW. (Photo P. Callieri, Neg. IsIAO CS 18138/23a). orientation of the complex was determined by ritual exigences, such as the opening of the main entrance to the E ? one of the many aspects which led us to interpret the monument as a Sacred Building (see infra). The Sacred Building is the focus of the Eastern Terrace, which was created with the imposing revetment wall. Rectangular in plan, the Sacred Building itself measures 14.80 (N-S) x 23.10 m (E-W). The upper surface of its area, where treasure-hunters have played havoc, could not be cleaned due to lack of time; however, at the moment no evident superstructure seems to emerge from the soil, and the explored portion of the monument is likely to represent its solid basement (Fig. 14). This is built with an inner core of block and thick slabs of schist, laid on regular levels with earth, and a facing wall characterized by masonry alternating courses of schist slabs and courses of schist blocks separated by rows of superimposed schist slabs. The basement rests on a foundation projecting 0.10 m from it, which served to levell off the surface on which the monument was built: in fact, the SW corner of the monument was built on a rock bank, at a higher level, whereas on the N and E sides the building rested at a lower level, as already mentioned, on the top of the high artificial terrace supported by the imposing revetment wall still preserved at the NE corner of the Terrace. The highest recorded height of this foundation is along the S wall of the stairway on the E side, where it reaches 0.73 m. The entire facing wall of the basement is plastered, and characterized by a high moulded base composed by a plinth (h. 0.15-0.25 m), a high torus (h. 0.41 m), a [15] 205</page><page sequence="16">Fig. 14 - Trench BKG 6: the Sacred Building, S side, W stretch. (Photo P. Callieri, Neg. IsIAO CS 18138/21a). thin fillet (h. 0.05 m) and a thick fillet (h. 0.12 m); only on the S stretch of the W side ? where the monument meets the rock of the mountain and where therefore the passage was impossible ? does the plinth extend plain (h. 0.58 m) up to the thick fillet, without torus and thin fillet. Above the moulded base, the wall of the basement is divided by pilasters resting on the upper face of the thick fillet of the moulded base and projecting 0.25 m from the wall. The pilasters are at a regular distance of c. 2.30 m from each other (from axis to axis), squared blocks of travertine (kanjur) being used in their masonry. Each pilaster has a base composed by plinth, torus and straight cavetto, progressively recessing (w. of plinth 0.73 m, w. of cavetto 0.68 m). On the straight cavetto rests the shafts (w. 0.55 m) which are decorated according to two different, alternating patterns. One pattern (Fig. 15) shows plain sides and a band in the middle with foliate motifs: a central band of leaves departing from a central stem, limited by two rows of beads, and two lateral foliate bands; the other pattern (Fig. 16) has a projecting cornice of four fillets all around, plain at the base while decorated on the two right and left sides with an incised rib pattern, and a central band with the same decoration as the side cornices. The decorated layer of plaster seems to be laid onto one or more preparation layers, as clearly shown on the W side: here the outermost of the two preparation 206 [16]</page><page sequence="17">Fig. 15 - Trench BKG 6: the Sacred Building, W side, pilaster with stucco decoration. (Photo P. Callieri, Neg. IsIAO CS 18135/21a). Fig. 16 - Trench BKG 6: the Sacred Building, W side, pilaster with stucco decoration. (Photo P. Callieri, Neg. IsIAO CS 18134/17). layers is characterized by deep cuts made with a broad knife for a better adherence of the final layer. On the E side of the monument, instead, the two successive layers of plaster correspond to the levels of two successive floors, and seem therefore to represent two different phases. The Sacred Building was approached from the E by a monumental stairway, the plan of which has only partially been exposed (Fig. 17). The stairway is not perfectly symmetrical. At the corner with the basement wall it has two almost square projections, measuring 1.20 x 1.20 m to the N and 1.20 x 1.10 m to the S, which flank the central body. The latter is solid, limited at the sides by two slightly diverging walls, with a central core contained within two parallel side walls. The structure of the stairway has been exposed for a length of 4.00 m from the projections, but no step has been discovered, nor the beginning of the stairway itself, which must therefore exceed 4.00 m in length. The stairway must in fact have started quite near to the E revetment wall of the Terrace, which reaches a height of about 10 metres here. The fact that the space between the Terrace wall and the stairway is so narrow as compared to the monumentality of the complex, and the fact that the facing of Terrace wall in this stretch is missing, whereas to the N it is still quite preserved, leads us to believe that the approach to the top of the Terrace could have been by [17] 207</page><page sequence="18">Fig. 17 - Trench BKG 6: at bottom, the Sacred Building E stairway, S side; above, Period Ilia structures. (Photo P. Callieri, Neg. IsIAO CS 18140/17a). a stairway running parallel to the E revetment wall of the Terrace and at a 90? angle with the Sacred Building. This second stairway would have disintegrated with the collapse of the wall. In the exposed parts of the monument, which represent its solid basement, there are no signs of restoration or additions. The different layers noticed in its plastering could represent stages of the preparation for the final layer, in a single phase, or the successive phases of the monument's life: for a final judgement it is however wiser to wait for further excavations. Many fragments of the extremely rich plaster decoration of the monument were recovered in the collapse layers, as well as in the filling of the pits dug by the treasure hunters literally looting the area. The quality of the plaster is extremely good, refined and compact, with a high content of lime distinguishing it in appearance and hardness from the Gandharan stuccoes. The fragments show mainly floral (Fig. 18) and geometric (Fig. 19) patterns, but also faces of fantastic animals combining features of lions and boars (Figs. 20, 25). Their style is far from the naturalism of Gandharan art, and points to a late date. A late date is also confirmed by the only fragment of a human image recovered, namely the head of a crowned figure (Inv. no. BKG 2023) which had been defaced, and which was found on top of the layer of the first 208 [18]</page><page sequence="19">Fig. 18 - Trench BKG 6: fragment of stucco decoration from S.U. 223.

The figure wears the three-pronged crown characterizing many of the Kashmiri and Swati bronzes of the early Medieval period, both Buddhist and Hindu, as well as many of the coeval Buddhist rock carvings of Swat (Filigenzi 1995; Filigenzi &amp; Olivieri, forthcoming) and stone sculptures of Kashmir (Malla 1990: 80; Paul 1986: passim). However, the fact that he has elongated ear lobes but no earrings distinguishes him from crowned Buddhas or Bodhisattvas, suggesting he may well be a princely figure, if not a Hindu deity. As regards the function of the building, several elements in it clearly point to a religious function, the first being the fact that the building consists of an imposing solid basement which some superstructure probably stood on. This is typical of religious structures, such as st?pas, caityas, temples, while it does not fit with a residential or military function. Secondly, as we mentioned before, the orientation of the whole complex on the Eastern Terrace, with a long axis diverging from that of the natural rock spur of the mountain, thus necessitating the construction of a huge and massive artificial terrace, longer than if oriented to the SE. The only explanation for this seems to be compulsory orientation of the main entrance to the E. Finally, even though the fragments of stucco decorations are notdecisive evidence of a religious function, they are far more intelligible in a religious than in a secular building. Even if the head of the crowned figure represents a princely figure and not a Buddha, a Bodhisattva or a Hindu deity, the comparative evidence for a votive function rather than a secular one appears overwhelming. As to the religious identity of the Sacred Building, we are far from a clear understanding. Its rectangular plan distinguishes it from the st?pas of the area, where the basement has a square plan and the stairway projects from it. In order to belong to a st?pa, the rectangular basement should support the dome plus the stairway: this is not to be ruled out, since the elevation is not known, but it seems less likely given the existence of a stairway projecting from the rectangular basement. It seems therefore more likely that the monument is a temple or a caitya. In the late date to which the building seems to belong (see infra) Buddhism and Hinduism were closely intermingled: at Parih?sapura, in Kashmir, king Lalit?ditya built Buddhist monuments as well as Hindu temples (Kak 1930: 149), and the Kashmiri chronicle of the Kalhana's R?jatarangini shows that members of the royal family were at the same time devotee of Buddhism and Hinduism (Stein 1900: 92 and book IV, 188-206). Moreover, the dating of the complex is highly relevant to its religious origin since, while the report of the Chinese pilgrim Huei Ch'ao shows that in the 8th century the ruling class of Gandhara still practised Buddhism, and the Kashmiri evidence of the 7th-8th century shows the coexistence of Buddhism and Hinduism, the 9th and 10th century A.D., with the Hindu Shahis, marked a complete return to Hinduism (Abdur-Rahman 1979: 33): if the Sacred Building belongs to the period of the Hindu Shahis, then it is likely to have been a Hindu temple. In this regard, it is worth noting that a Hindu Shahi presence at Barikot is evidenced by the only S?rada inscription mentioning the Hindu 210 [20]</page><page sequence="21">Fig. 21,a-c - Trench BKG 6: stucco head of a crowned figure, Inv. no.

A.D. 962-1001), also quoting a foundation in the city of Vajirasth?na, which was found on a hill to the north of Barikot: contrary to the interpretations of others (Sahni 1938: 298-301; Pandey 1973: 167; Khan et al. 2000: 28), already Stein (1930: 11 ff.), Tucci (1958: 295-99, 327, n. 28) and then Rahman (1979: 275, 341) have accepted the identification of the ancient Vajirasth?na with Barikot, the Bazira-Beira of the classical authors. The comparative evidence for the Shahi architecture centred in the temples of Kafir Kot, Bilot and Malot, which are much better preserved in their superstructure, does not however extend to similarities in the shape and decoration of the basement (Pandey 1973: 230-31, with bibliography; Rahman 1979: 281-84; Meister 1996; Khan et al. 2000: 148-50). The unfortunately limited pottery finds pertaining to the life of the monument point to a dating in the Shahi period, which accords with the late stylistic traits of the stuccoes. However, complete study of the shapes and the comparison with the material from the stratigraphic sequence of the settlement in Trench BKG 2 are needed in order to be able to specify if the monument belongs to the period of the Turki Shahis (7th-8th century A.D.) or of the Hindu Shahis (9th-10th century A.D.). In this respect, future understanding of the duration and phases of its life will prove fundamental. (P.C. &amp; A.N.) Trench BKG 6.1 In order to explore the mound situated on the E terrace with reference to the imposing substruction wall (S.U. 130), it was decided to dig a small trench with a NNE-SSW alignment, 15.00 m long and 5.00 m wide across the mound, starting from the NE corner of the substruction wall (Fig. 22), which unearthed the NE corner of the Sacred Building. The earliest period is the one referring to the phase of construction of the Sacred Building (Period I). The foundation of the NE corner of its basement rests on the top level of the massive embankment consisting of bedded stones that, contained by substruction wall S.U. 130, formed the structure of the E terrace of the hill (Fig. 23). Above this, was the floor of the Sacred Building, in earth and slabs (Fig. 24): the E side of the foundation displays two offsets, and the N side only one. The mouth of an approximately 7 m deep well opened in the floor: the well cut through the embankment and was presumably used to collect water, as the lower deposit layers consist of depurated clay with only very few dump materials. Although much smaller in diameter, it may be compared with the well found in the post-Gandharan architectonic complex of Suray Tangai, in Upper Swat (Stein 1930: 52-54; Tucci 1958: 320-22; Olivieri 1996: 96). In this area the paved floor seems to have been used throughout the whole period of the monument's use. [23] 213</page><page sequence="24">Fig. 23 - Trench BKG 6.1: top level of the high artificial terrace, view from S. (Photo L.M. Olivieri). Fig. 24 - Trench BKG 6.1: the floor level of the Sacred Building, view from N. (Photo L.M. Olivieri). A phase of abandonment (Period IIa) was followed by a phase in which the area was re-used, with the Sacred Building already partially destroyed (Period lib). During this period, the podium of the building with its offset was visible. The whole area N of the monument, lying between its N face, the N boundary of the terrace and a small enclosure wall partially aligned with the axis of the N face of the Sacred Building (S.U. 43), was an open area in which a few shallow pits were dug (some protected by a border of pebbles) to which access from the N was ensured by small path paved with flat laid slabs; near the pits there was a fireplace. The filling of the pits contained dump material, in particular, ovine and bovine bone remains (some bearing traces of butchering). One find typical of this phase are the fragments of glazed pottery rims and coloured vitreous paste bracelets. The most important element of this period is well S.U. 35, the more recent filling layers in which have supplied most of the dating material referring to this occupation phase: abundantly encrusted and corroded Islamic pottery (including unslipped red ware truncated cone-shaped small cups and kuza type jugs, such as Inv. no. BKG 1755), a number of fragments of glazed ware rims (Inv. nos. BKG 1722-1727), several stucco decoration fragments 214 [24]</page><page sequence="25">Fig. 25 - Trench BKG 6.1: fragments of the stucco decoration. (Photo L.M. Olivieri). Fig. 26 - Trench BKG 6.1: green glazed ceramic lamp, Inv. no. BKG 1714. (Photo L.M. Olivieri). from the Sacred Building (Fig. 25), but above all and interesting a green glazed ceramic lamp with a leaf-shaped handle (Fig. 26, Inv. no. BKG 1714) of a tipe (type 2) found also at Balkh during the Timurid period (Gardin 1957: 66-68, pi. XXIII, 5). The later occupation phase of this sector of the hill (Period III) contains simple structures made up of walls (S.U. 6, S.U. 22, S.U. 4) which, merely abutting without being bonded, delimit two adjacent rooms and an open area situated at a lower level. In this open area a large dump pit was discovered, the filling layers from which were found to contain animal bones, potsherds, and abundant remains of the stucco decoration of the Sacred Building. On the surface of the last filling layer a circular grindstone was found in situ (Inv. no. BKG 1742). Some distance from the edge of the pit, near wall S.U. 4, a small fireplace was found, while a small canal with a [25]</page><page sequence="26">embrasure made of stone slabs opened up in wall S.U. 6. On the S side of the trial trench a raised area was found, separated by a low stone wall (S.U. 17) from the open area (note the re-utilization of older kanjur blocks). This raised area skirts the corner of the basement of the Sacred Building, which is covered by a thick smooth layer of plaster. The surface layers covered these structures, as well as the remaining part of the Sacred Building, thus giving the surface the appearance of a mound. (L.M.O.) Trench BKG 6.2 Excavation of this trench at the SW corner of the area surrounding the Sacred Building, where L.M. Olivieri had previously emptied some large pits dug by treasure hunters (3), has yielded data on the stratigraphy pertaining to the life of the monument and to the episodes connected with its destruction and reuse of the area (Fig. 27). The SW corner of the Sacred Building {locus BKG 654) rises directly on top of the rock bank of the mountain (S.U. 305), which slopes towards E and N (Fig. 28), whereas further E {locus BKG 655) the foundation stands on a layer of yellow clay (S.U. 293) which seems to fill a depression of the rock bank. No trace of anthropic presence has been detected, but the area exposed is somewhat limited. Data on the pre-monument situation of the Terrace will therefore hopefully be collected mainly in the W and N areas. Belonging to the same time as construction of the monument, which represents the first structural period (Period I) of the sequence, we have in locus BKG 655 a layer of brown and loose clay, with a few potsherds and small schist chips (S.U. 284), and further N a layer of similar clay but without stone fragments (S.U. 292). In locus BKG 654, we find a layer similar to S.U. 284 but more compact (S.U. 290) and a band of clay lighter in colour along the base of the Sacred Building (S.U. 291), probably due to the presence of depurated clay in the wall construction; in the SW corner, the presence of schist slabs and fragments is more marked (S.U. 300). The life of the Sacred Building, concentrated in one phase, is characterized by the succession of layers of soil accumulation, influenced by the inclination of the underlying rock bank, and by a deposit thicker along the building's foundation and gradually thinning to S and W. Therefore in locus BKG 654 we have only one stratigraphic unit (S.U. 295), whereas in locus BKG 655 the stratigraphy sees a sequence of shallow superimposed clay layers (S.U. 289, 285, 286 and 287, 277). The deepest of these stratigraphic units (S.U. 289) bear traces of the plaster work on the face of the building. (3) A long pit was also located and emptied along the W side of the Sacred Building. 216 [26]</page><page sequence="27">Fig. 27 - Trench BKG 6.2: general plan, scale 1:100. (Drawing F. Martore). [27] 217</page><page sequence="28">Fig. 28 - Trench BKG 6.2: locus BKG 654: on the left, the Sacred Building SW corner; in the foreground S.U. 305, 294, Period II wall S.U. 272; on the right, Period IVb wall S.U. 229; in the background, Period IVa wall S.U. 266. (Photo P. Callieri, Neg. IsIAO CS 18138/24a). The life of the Sacred Building was brought to an end by deliberate destruction (Period II), as witnessed by the defacement of the face of the stucco head intentionally perpetrated with an axe leaving its mark on the stucco. The stucco head was found in locus BKG 655, lying upside down on the upper interface of S.U. 274, a layer of clay with fragments of plaster, potsherds and charcoals. Other fragments of stucco decoration were found in locus BKG 654, in a layer along the S face of the building's basement (S.U. 283); here, a succession of shallow layers (S.U. 288, 282, 282, 280) gradually fills the slope of the rock bank. The presence of stucco fragments marks the moment of this abrupt destruction, which seems to have been limited to the decoration, and perhaps the superstructure. Associated with this destruction are faint traces of a secondary occupation of the area. In fact, on the floor level represented by the upper interface of S.U. 274 in locus BKG 655 and S.U. 294 in locus BKG 654, a shallow terracing wall, S.U. 272, was built at the SW corner of the excavated area (Fig. 28), with a shallow foundation trench on its S face only: it has only been possible to bring this to light in locus BKG 654, where it has a rounded profile (S.U. 299), filled with earth and small stones (S.U. 298). The wall joins the S side of the Sacred Building at its SW corner and then runs SE at an angle of 40?; it bears traces 218 [28]</page><page sequence="29">of fire, probably to be seen in relation to the charcoal fragments found in the area. In locus BKG 655, adjacent to the S face of the Sacred Building, a small rectangular basin, S.U. 278, with side walls built of schists and mud, and with plaster on the bottom, was found filled with mud (S.U. 279, 270, 269). The area was gradually covered with layers of loose brown clay, including small fragments of stone and pottery (S.U. 276 in locus BKG 654 and S.U. 273 in locus BKG 655). The main collapse of the structure (Period III) took place above this level, and is represented by a thick layer with blocks of travertine and schist slabs, along with fragments of plaster which gave the soil a white colour and a very compact consistency, corresponding to S.U. 259 in locus BKG 655 and to S.U. 257 in locus BKG 654. The fact that S.U. 257, which is nearer to the rock of the mountains, also contains large fragments of the same granatiferous schist as the mountain suggests the collapse may have come about with an earthquake. To the same period may be attributed S.U. 267 in locus BKG 655 and S.U. 263, 275 and 262 in locus BKG 654: fragments of glazed ware recovered in S.U. 275 confirm a date in the Islamic period, still to be specified. On the upper interface of S.U. 262 and 267 was built a series of walls, all in stone masonry (Period IV). The stratigraphic and structural relationships between them reveal three different but closely interlinked structural phases, although our understanding of the architectural plan is hampered by the pits dug by treasure-hunters, which damaged the structures to a large extent. In the first phase (Period IVa) a shallow wall, S.U. 266 (Fig. 28), leans against the S face of the building's basement, at the distance of 2.40 m from its SW corner, with a NE-SW orientation. It is built with schist slabs but also with fragments of kanjur. its relative thinness {c. 0.65 m) together with the irregular appearance of its W face suggest it was built in order to delimit an enclosed area on the E from the open ground on the W. Further E, a second wall thicker and of more regular masonry of schist slabs, S.U. 261, has a N-S orientation, and is parallel to a third and similar wall, S.U. 245, exposed on its W face at the E limit of the excavated area. The floor level in locus BKG 654 is represented by the upper interface of layer S.U. 253, whereas in locus BKG 655 the floor level is represented by the upper interface of S.U. 267. In the second phase (Period IVb), corresponding to the floor level of S.U. 252, a long wall, S.U. 229-225 (Fig. 28), runs parallel to the S side of the Sacred Building and at a distance of c. 3.15-3.25 m from it, covering the preserved top of wall S.U. 261, which therefore had been replaced. Whereas at first it was thought to be a terracing wall, the fact that it also has a regular facing on the S face shows that it was in fact a wall of a building. In the third phase (Period IVc) wall 229-225 is connected to wall S.U. 266 through a rebuilding of the latter, S.U. 235, which completely closes the area to the E of it. On S.U. 252 a soil accumulation which does not show the peculiarities of a floor is represented by S.U. 242, 238, 246 and 241. In the E area, corresponding now to locus BKG 652, from floor S.U. 255-202 pit S.U. 303 was excavated, found [29] 219</page><page sequence="30">Fig. 29 - Trench BKG 6.2: locus BKG 654: collapse of architectural elements in S.U. 233. (Photo P. Callieri, Neg. IsIAO CS 18133/21). filled with loose earth of S.U. 304. A shallow wall in poor masonry, S.U. 251, was exposed for a short stretch with an E-W orientation, perpendicular to wall S.U. 245 and parallel to a second, poorly preserved wall, also perpendicular to wall S.U. 245, S.U. 249. As stated above, the havoc played by treasure-hunters hampers architectural understanding of these poor structural traces. These structures collapsed along with a new big collapse of the Sacred Building, which came to fill the area to the S of it, between its basement and wall 229-225, along with the upper negative interfaces of some of the earlier structures; only wall 229-225 still stands acting as a substruction wall creating a terrace in the area to the S of it; among the layers which fill the area S of wall 229 we recorded S.U. 301 of loose earth. Locus BKG 654 sees the layers S.U. 237 and 233 (Fig. 29), both of them characterized by a relevant amount of blocks and slabs, whereas in locus BKG 652 these characteristics are shared by S.U. 243, 297 and 240. The first structure built after the collapse is the wall S.U. 206, constructed in a good diaper masonry characterized by the presence of travertine blocks and of a row of schist blocks separated by rows of superimposed small schist slabs. It has a E-W orientation slightly diverging from the S face of the Sacred Building, and turns southwards with a 90? angle, but was exposed to a limited extent, so that it [30]</page><page sequence="31">is impossible to ascertain the architectural nature of the structure (a podium?). This new phase (Period Va) has two successive floors which are well evidenced only along wall S.U. 206, respectively S.U. 242 and S.U. 239. In a second phase of the same period (Period Vb) a room [locus BKG 653) was built at the SW corner of the trench, on the terrace supported by wall 229 to the N. The room is limited to the E by a wall in good schist slabs masonry (S.U. 210), with an alignment perpendicular to wall 206, to the S by a similar wall leaning against the rock of the mountain (S.U. 208) and meeting at an 80? with wall S.U. 210, while to the W the room extends beyond the excavated area. The room has an original beaten earth floor (S.U. 232) and a raised floor (S.U. 217): on the latter, a fireplace made up of slabs on edge (S.U. 216) was found along with ashes and charcoals, and several pottery vessels in quite a good state of preservation. The fireplace is set against the E end of a shallow party wall (S.U. 215), parallel to wall S.U. 208. At the same time, a stairway (S.U. 212) is built along the W face of S.U. 206, connecting the raised floor level along S.U. 206 (S.U. 221) with an upper area, out of the excavated trench. The area is then finally filled by earth layers (S.U. 220 and 211), and by an earth layer covering the negative interfaces of the structures (S.U. 204). The pottery finds, some fragments of glazed ware as well as of glass vessels point to a date in the Early Islamic period for both Periods IV and V. (P.C.) Trench BKG 6.3 Excavation of this trench at the middle of the E side of the Sacred Building, adjoining the Trench BKG 6.1 excavated in 1998 by L.M. Olivieri, has cast light on the location of the access to the Sacred Building (Fig. 30). In the S part of the trench {locus BKG 660) the lowermost exposed layer is characterized by yellow clay and large horizontal schist slabs (S.U. 478), evidencing the artificial levelling of the area on which the structures of the Sacred Building are built. This layer could not be excavated, nor the presence of indicators of anthropic activity recorded. Construction of the monument, representing the first structural period (Period I) in the sequence, included at the same time the E side of the basement, the monumental stairway and the square projections of the latter at the join with the basement wall (S.U. 453, 459). The stairway is built with masonry side walls (S.U. 451, 455, 459 and 460) enclosing a core of earth, composed in loci BKG 661 and BKG 662, at the centre of the trench, by layers of yellowish clay, slightly sloping eastwards (S.U. 448, 463, 470), and in locus BKG 659, to the N, by hard clay with stone fragments (S.U. 485) (Figs. 29-30). [31] 221</page><page sequence="32">The life of the Sacred Building is concentrated in one phase in this area, too. In the S area {locus BKG 660) we recorded two clayey layers characterized by the presence of fragments of stones and small slabs (S.U. 477 and 471), whereas in the N area (locus BKG 659) the stratigraphy is characterized by a succession of three layers of darker clay with small rock fragments and, in a few places, horizontal schist slabs (S.U. 479, 480, 428). The destruction of the Sacred Building in this area is connected with the damage recorded on the structure of the stairway (Period IIa). In locus BKG 660 the filling (S.U. 475) of a pit (S.U. 474) has yielded fragments of Islamic age pottery, as well as a fragment of turquoise coloured glass, giving a chronological reference which could possibly account for the iconoclasm evident in the destruction of the monument in Trench BKG 6.2. The pit is sealed with a clayey layer (S.U. 467) including fragments of charcoal and stucco, covered with a series of layers of light clayey earth containing many fragments of slabs and small slabs and gravel (S.U. 468, 464, 449). In locus BKG 659 light loose clayey earth with some big blocks or fragments of stone (S.U. 466, 427) represent the collapse stratigraphy of this period. The core of the stairway was destroyed, and covered in locus BKG 662 with two layers of dark grey earth, of moderate hardness, and schist slabs set on edge (S.U. 436) or horizontal (S.U. 447). On the other hand, in locus BKG 661, again in the core of the stairway, a collapse layer of loose dark earth sloping eastwards, with large blocks and slabs (S.U. 465), is followed by a layer of hard yellowish-brown soil (S.U. 446) on which some structures rest. As in fact we saw in Trench BKG 6.2, the newcomers also left scant structural traces of their presence (Period lib), only two walls remaining in locus BKG 661, built in a simple masonry of large blocks and slabs, connected at right angles (S.U. 439, 482), and a fireplace (S.U. 444): the corresponding floor level (S.U. 445) is a layer of light brown earth with charcoal fragments, scorched earth and much gravel. Excavation of a large pit by treasure hunters has damaged this room, which probably extended northwards. In locus BKG 662 this phase does not show structural evidence, but only a layer of loose light clayey earth with fragments of rock and a few bones (S.U. 486), covered with a layer including horizontal slabs (S.U. 484), a layer of similar but quite compact earth (S.U. 476) to the E of wall S.U. 482, and a layer of dark clayey earth with gravel (S.U. 440). The destruction of these structure is represented in locus BKG 661 by a layer of dark depurated earth with large stone blocks (S.U. 443), covered with a layer of the same dark earth (S.U. 432), sloping eastwards and also covering the upper negative interface of wall S.U. 439. To the'S, in locus BKG 662, a layer of yellow and compact clayey earth (S.U. 431) leans against and partially covers S.U. 432; to the NE, is an accumulation layer of light and compact clay, with gravel and large blocks (S.U. 429). These stratigraphic units mark the end of the period, whereas the fact that wall S.U. 439 is covered brings the area of loci 661 and 662 together in one locus BKG 658. The following period (Period Ilia) is characterized in locus BKG 658 by the construction of a large rectangular room (4.80 x 3.30 m: walls S.U. 407, 409, 415, 222 [32]</page><page sequence="33">I Fig. 30 - Trench BKG 6.3: general plan, scale 1:100.

The excavation of large, deep pits by treasure hunters in loci BKG 659 and 660 confuses the structural picture of the two areas: in the SW corner of the former, a wall (S.U. 413), at right angles with the W wall of BKG 658, suggests the existence of a second room, whereas in locus BKG 660 remains of a wall (S.U. 462) are set against the upper negative interface of the S square projection of the stairway [33] 223</page><page sequence="34">Fig. 31 - Trench BKG 6.3, view from W: in the foreground, on the right the core of the stairway with the side wall, and on the left the N square projection; in the centre, Period Ilia room BKG 658 built on top of the collapsed stairway core. (Photo P. Callieri, Neg. IsIAO CS 18140/21a). (S.U. 452) and two loose light clayey earth layers (S.U. 469, 483) seem associated to this wall, without the possibility of their full understanding. What characterizes the structures of this period is their masonry, made up of the same schist slabs and blocks as the Sacred Building, although with a less refined technique. They use the remains of the Sacred Building as foundations, in some cases simply by rebuilding the former wall but with some earth in the joints between them and the former structures, which makes their later dating certain. The floor level of this room BKG 658 is made up by more than one layer: in the NE corner, above S.U. 429, we find dark loose clayey earth with small rock fragments (S.U. 425) and light brown clayey earth with horizontal slabs (S.U. 426) and with many potsherds (S.U. 430). The following structural phase (Period Illb) is represented by the new utilization of the earlier room with a few modifications, at the moment difficult to correlate with Period III or IV in Trench BKG 6.2. The inner space of the room BKG 658 is reduced by the construction of a new wall (S.U. 411) against the earlier S wall (S.U. 415) (Fig. 32), built in a small foundation trench (S.U. 435) which has vertical sides and is completely filled by the wall, and touching the interface of the earlier 224 [34]</page><page sequence="35">Fig. 32 - Trench BKG 6.3, view from E: in the foreground, from right to left: the core of the stairway S.U. 448-463, Period Illb wall S.U. 411, Period Ilia wall S.U. 415 on top of Period I wall of the stairway; in the background, on the left the S stretch of the E side of the Sacred Building and the square projection (Photo P. Callieri, Neg. IsIAO CS 18140/15a). layer S.U. 484. At the same time, some small architectural elements are built in the room, such as a rectangular fireplace (S.U. 421) in the NW corner of the room, a small basin (S.U. 422) made up of small blocks in the middle of the room, and a winding drain channel (S.U. 423) of horizontal slabs in the N part of the room. The floor is represented by the interface of S.U. 424, of light brown depurated clayey earth, occupying the entire room, with several almost intact pottery vessels lying on it. The ceramic fabric as well as the shapes belong to the Early Islamic period. A layer of clay with ashes and fragments of stone (S.U. 418), filling a depression in the N part of the room, and a layer of light depurated but compact clayey earth (S.U. 402) subsequently cover the floor of the room. All the area is then covered by layers of collapse (S.U. 401, 405, 416), pertaining both to the Sacred Building and the later structures (Period IV), marking the end of the occupation of the area, which was in conclusion damaged by the pits dug by the treasure hunters (S.U. 419, 403, with their filling S.U. 420, 404).
