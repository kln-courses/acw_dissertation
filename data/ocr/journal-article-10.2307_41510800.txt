Ecotourísm and Heritage Conservation. In: Micallef, A. (ed.), MCRR3-2010 Conference Proceedings, Journal of Coastal Research, Special Issue, No. 61, pp. 234-241. Grosseto, Tuscany, Italy, ISSN 0749-0208. This case study presents ecotourísm as a tool for conservation of a small island in southern Brazil. Campeche Island emerged as a tourist destination due to its scenic quality, clear, calm waters and its proximity to the coast. The landscape factors are enhanced by important archeological sites found along the island's rocky shore. The recent increase in tourism on the island began to have negative consequences, requiring protective measures. This was one of the reasons for the recording of Campeche Island as a National Archeological and Landscape Heritage site in July, 2000, by the National Historical and Artistic Heritage Institute (IPHAN) of the Brazilian government. After this recording, closing the island to visitors to assure the preservation of its archeological sites was considered. However, this would contradict with IPHAN' s strategy to have public contact with heritage sites become a tool for conservation. Therefore, IPHAN has developed a process of qualified visitation that has been characterized until now as Mass Tourism, in keeping with concepts of Ecotourísm. A Visitation Project has been gradually implemented by IPHAN with the communities involved to provide services responsible for: a) restoring the trail network and establishing a secure infrastructure; b) assessing visiting capacity; c) creating monitor training courses; d) defining and implementing usage regulations; e) defining trails and f) creating monitoring systems. This paper will detail the methods adopted for organizing visits to the track and underwater trails, presenting quantitative and qualitative data to show that the visitation procedures allow receiving 40 thousand visitors in the most intensive tourist season without harming the natural and cultural patrimony, while involving the public in raising awareness about the importance of conservation measures. ADDITIONAL INDEX WORDS: Campeche Island, visitation, cultural heritage. INTRODUCTION Humans have always tracked the surface of the Earth looking for areas to occupy that meet their needs. These needs, which were initially restricted to survival, have diversified, until scenic quality gradually became criteria. Areas of notable scenic beauty have been occupied with installations no longer destined for housing or survival activities, but for tourist activities. This is how much of the occupation óf the marine coast began, often generating interference to the point of disfiguring the geographic qualities that were ihe very reason for the choice of location and implantation of facilities. Like many other notable scenic locations, Campeche Island was "discovered" and since the 1950s came to be used for recreation and leisure. DOI: 10.21 12/SI61 -001.1 received XX; accepted XX ©Coastal Education &amp; Research Foundation 201 1 In the 1980s, the tourist activities quickly intensified, and at the end of the 1990s, there was strong demand from summer tourist activities related to sun and sea. This has led to intense and unorganized use of the island and strong negative impacts on the archeological and environmental heritage. In the year 2000, Campeche Island received legal protection from IPHAN, and was recorded as a National Archeological and Scenic Heritage site. This established a change of direction and activities conducted on the island gradually began to be adapted to procedures in keeping with the principles of Ecotourísm. CHARACTERISATION Campeche Island is 1 .4 km from Campeche Beach, located on the southeast coast of Santa Catarina Island, in the municipality of Florianópolis, Santa Catarina State, between coordinates 27°41'22" S and 27°42'18" S and 48°27'33" W and 48°28'08" W (Figure 1). It has 534.490,64 m2 (Chamas, Journal of Coastal Research, Special Issue No. 61, 201 1 234</page><page sequence="2">Ecotourism and Heritage Conservation 2008) and an irregular terrain composed of a hill and two foothills with respective altitudes of 48, 82 and 78 meters (IPUF, 1979). Figurei . Location of Campeche Island. Until the mid 20th century, Campeche Island was used and occupied informally by fishermen. These fishermen spent months on the island in fishermen huts on the beach. In addition to fishing, they practiced subsistence agriculture on the center western portion of the island (CHAMAS, 2008). In the early 1950s, the island began to be used by the members of the Clube de Caça Pesca e Tiro Couto de Magalhães [Coute de Magalhães Hunting, Fishing and Shooting Club] which formalized its occupation with the responsible government agency. Little by little this occupation came to impede the activities of the fishermen, who lost the rights to use the land area of the island, and were restricted to fishing activities in the marine surroundings (CHAMAS, 2008). Over the years, other groups linked to the tourist activity came to dispute its income generating opportunities. The consolidation of this activity took place without any planning and both the use as well as the promotion of physical interferences occurred without analysis of their impacts on the natural environment or on the archeological heritage. In 1998, various complaints reached IPHAN indicating improper use of the island. This situation, combined with the exceptional scenic beauty and archeological importance of Campeche Island, led to the approval of the recording of Campeche Island as a national heritage site in July 2000. The recording does not change the property and use rights, therefore the occupations can remain and the activities continue to occur. Nevertheless, rules were defined to restrict or even impede activities incompatible with the fragility of the island environment . and of the archeological sites. As a complement, actions to raise awareness and professional training were conducted among the groups involved. The streams are ephemeral and two of the three principal ones are intermittent and flow to the beach (MAZZER, 2001). The vegetation is secondary Atlantic Rain Forest (COURA NETO and KLEIN, 1991) with woods, restinga [marine forest and brush and on sandy soil] and pioneer vegetation of rocky shore. The geological formation is composed of Granito Ilha [Island Granite] and diabase dykes (CARUSO JÚNIOR, 1993). Campeche Island is completely circled by rocky shore (Figure 2), with the exception of a single, sandy 400-meter long beach. Figure2. Rocky shore of Campeche Island. OCCUPATION AND USES It has pre-historic archeological sites distributed along the rocky shore: including petroglyphs (Figure 3) and grinding slabs (Figure 4). The grinding slabs have anthropomorphic and geometric designs (lines, triangles, circles). There is a historic archeological site at the beach constituted by remnants of whaling facilities from the late 1 8th century. Figure3. Petroglyphs at the rocky shore. ORGANISATION AND PROTECTION It was recognized that the existing activities and occupations were focused on tourism. With this in mind, yet considering the need for protection of the archeological and natural Journal of Coastal Research, Special Issue No. 61, 201 1 235</page><page sequence="3">Costa Chamas and Schmidt heritage of Campeche Island with involvement of the community, actions were realized and norms prepared to organize and qualify these activities. Figure4. Grinding slab at the beach. Since the heritage recording, a public-private management system has been established with seminars and preparatory meetings for the establishment of agreements concerning use of Campeche Island. Various civil groups linked to Campeche Island participated in this management, while the government was represented by IPHAN, as the managing agency, the state Environmental Policy, as the inspection agency and the Federal Public Ministry, to monitor application of the law. Concerning physical facilities for visitation, the use of the trail network opened by the former users of the island to access the various fishing points and archeological sites on the rocky shore was identified. These trails were open for occasional use, but their location stimulates erosion from rainfall. Thus, because of intense public use, various paths were in states of decay and had to be closed. Over the years, new tracks suitable to the topography of the land were opened and the closed tracks were planted with autochthones vegetation to recuperate the surrounding landscape. Some locations have extremely steep terrain, making it necessary to provide support structures such as steps, handrails and decks. In addition to protecting the fragile land areas, these structures offer security and comfort to visitors. The durability of the new trail network is guaranteed by the implementation of a system of drainage channels that must be maintained periodically to guarantee the quality of the trails. The trails, the beach and the archeological sites compose the areas open to intensive visits, and as a protective measure, a preliminary analysis of their physical support capacity was necessary. The study to determine the support capacity (MAZZER, 2007) was based on: 1- available physical area for visitors, 2- the existence of restrictive factors (for example an insufficient quantity of bathrooms, days with closed trails), 3 - characteristics of visiting (for example average time of stay of visitors to the island). The study results led to establishment of a limit of 770 visitors, which was defined as the maximum number of people who could get off the boats each day under Portaria n° 691, of Nov. 23, 2009 (BRASIL, 2009). This Administrative Rule ( Portaria n° 691) is an IPHAN regulation and presents guidelines and criteria for protection, conservation and use of Campeche Island. It defines both the land use zoning as well as detailed restrictions and prohibitions. Procedures were defined for visiting and use of the island such as visiting hours, trail monitoring, collection and destination of solid waste, etc. The zoning presented in the Portaria considers the forms of use that were in practice as well as the vulnerabilities identified and the tourist potential. The combination of these factors, respecting the existing occupation, resulted in a map that was incorporated to the Portaria (Figure 5). The definition of the zones, whose characterizations and detailing of the permitted uses and restrictions are the guidelines for the monitoring activities. The monitoring seeks protection and in parallel, establishes two lines of action: 1 - monitoring that always takes places in conjunction with work of raising awareness, although in serious cases penalties are needed and 2 - the production of data to evaluate management of the process and for the production of scientific studies. The areas indicated in the zoning as those for intensive use have trails open to visitors that will be detailed below. Figure5. Zoning on the Western side of Campeche Island. Journal of Coastal Research, Special Issue No. 61, 201 1 236</page><page sequence="4">Ecotourism and Heritage Conservation To use the trails, a process of raising public awareness and education of a trained staff was established. Eight years ago, months before the most intensive summer tourist season, the community involved with Campeche Island was invited to participate in the training of monitors for Campeche Island. An annual course was offered free of charge and with no restrictions for age or education, to disseminate information about protection for the cultural and natural heritage. The 76-hour course includes theoretical and practical classes (Figures 6). The theoretical classes are offered at the beginning of the course. The practical classes, held on Campeche Island, consolidate the content and present opportunities for transmission of knowledge to tourists during walks on the trails. The course is divided into the following modules: 1 - Archeology, History and Legends; 2 - Ecology and the Environment - which has seven classes about biotic and abiotic factors of the marine and terrestrial environments; 3 - Tourism - offers information about ecotourism and cultural tourism; 4 - Environmental Education - concerns issues such as conscious behavior and possibilities for interaction in natural areas, as well as interpretation of natural and cultural environments; 5- Communication and Professionalism - concerns issues of professional behavior and human and labor relations, in a process that is interactive with the students' orality and form of expression; 7 - Preventive Education - details preventive healthcare and First Aid techniques; 6 - Conservation - presents policies, legislation and systems of protection for Brazil's cultural and natural heritage, the public and private institutions responsible for and involved with protection of the Island, the conservation of the archeological heritage and the biodiversity of Campeche Island, as well as studies already conducted and the facilities and organization for visiting. There is also an optional module for those who intend to participate in the underwater trails composed of five subjects. To participate in this module there are requirements concerning age, physical conditioning and water skills as a first measure to guarantee the safety of the underwater trails at Campeche Island. Figureó. Practical classes at the rocky shore Evaluations are conducted during the course of the students' attendance and understanding of the content of the various disciplines and at the end there is a practical test that consists in leading the instructors on the Island's trails. The students with the best performance are selected to compose the team that will participate in the visits, beginning each December, when the summer begins in the southern hemisphere and is consequently the most intensive tourist season. After the conclusion of the course, the students selected become monitors on the visitation staff. In December, they conduct a two-week apprenticeship conducting visitation activities with the more experienced monitors who have worked in previous years. The Visitation Team An hierarchy was created in the visitation team to better organize the work. Thus, there are coordinators, who are university-level technicians, monitors, who were selected from the course and have various levels of education and assistants, who are more experienced monitors who stood out in previous years, because of their responsibility and dedication to their work. During the summer, two coordinators remain on the island, one of whom is responsible for the track trails and the other for the underwater trails. The first also assumes the function of general coordinator, and is responsible for verifying compliance with norms, for making contact with the various groups involved, for mediating conflicts and for organizing and distributing information internally. The accumulation of tasks under the responsibility of the coordinators led to the creation of the position of assistant, who undertakes bureaucratic activities such as organization of the work schedules, daily lunch hours, sales of tickets to the trail, the schedule and division of daily tasks, as well as others that are needed. Each monitor assumes a variety of functions in a rotating system, thus providing relief from more demanding activities. There are reception and information functions conducted at pre-defined locations: 1 - at the information post close to the point where boats leave for the Island; 2 - another on the beach on Campeche Island where people get off the boats; 3- at the information posts where tickets are sold for the land and underwater trails along the beach on Campeche Island (Figure 7). The other functions are: 4 - at the trail heads to prevent the entrance of visitors not accompanied by monitors; 5 - on the beach, to count the number of visitors arriving for monitoring purposes; 6 - on the trails, leading the visitors. The Routes The network of land and underwater trails allows various options. The land routes have different degrees of difficulty and time of duration. The trail walks normally take about 1 hour with an average length of 800 meters. They are conducted in Journal of Coastal Research, Special Issue No. 61, 201 1 237</page><page sequence="5">Costa Chamas and Schmidt groups with a maximum of 16 people, with two monitors, one at the beginning and the other at the end. The track trails (Figure 8) lead to the archeological sites and locations of special scenic beauty. The sites visited are the Pedra Preta do Sul , Letreiro and Pedra Fincada , all located on the east side of the island. Figure7. Information post near the beach. Figure8. Track trail at the rocky shore. In the marine sector there are two trail areas, to the North and South, which are open to visits if there are good navigating conditions, a minimum underwater visibility of 2 meters and no strong currents or any other risk factor. The locations, although they are close to the beach, are reached by boat for reasons of visitor safety and comfort and to reduce impact caused by the activity on the marine environment. For underwater trails, the contact with the visitor begins at the information post, where they receive equipment and are assisted with its placement. They then go to the water's edge where, after receiving initial instructions and indicate that they are ready, they are led to the boat. The groups are composed of up to 12 visitors, with a monitor for every 4 visitors. Each day the most favorable location is chosen, the trail to the north or south, and the boat stays to monitor the group the entire time. Thus, there is only one group realizing the activity at a time. Monitoring The system for monitoring the administration was prepared and refined over these 12 years of public-private management. It was initially based on information collected in meetings and seminars or even from evaluations by members of the visitation staff. As the process was organized, a method was created for preparing reports that gradually became more informative, presenting numeric data referring to visitation. The statements of the staff and the reports indicate various problems and conflicts generated by improper behavior by visitors. It was perceived that the situations were often caused by a lack of information and that acts of prevention would decrease the tensions established, principally on days of intense visitation. This was the main reason for the creation of the information post close to where visitors board boats that go to the island. At this location, a monitor, with the assistance of photos and a three dimensional model of the island, inform visitors of the options for the trip, the costs, the necessary equipment and principally, restrictions established because of the heritage site recording. Another source of conflict detected was caused by the fact that some boat operators gave incomplete or incorrect information to tourists, such as not indicating that on a given day the trails may be closed. In this case, the problem was reduced with the purchase of a cellular phone that became the only contact with the visitation management. Thus, the centralization of information avoided that incorrect information be given by third parties. A routine was established in which each morning the management would inform all of the tourist agents about the visiting conditions for the day. Tourism companies were identified as a source of conflict. To present information to this group and raise their awareness, IPHAN conducted seminars in November of the past three years. These seminars sought to present the specificities and fragilities of Campeche Island, as well as all of the regulations that are needed for its protection. Although these events are conducted in a public place and are free of charge, they have still not been efficient means to inform many of the tourist companies that are known to be the largest source of the problems. One of the specificities presented about Campeche Island is the definition of only three points from where boats leave for the island and that only registered boats can transport tourists, each handling a pre-defined quota. The monitoring of the solid waste generated by the visits to the island was organized in the following manner: 1 - when visitors arrived at the island they were greeted by monitors and receive a brief explanation and a plastic bag with the Journal of Coastal Research, Special Issue No. 61, 201 1 238</page><page sequence="6">Ecotourism and Heritage Conservation words "we are on an island, please take back with you all the waste that you produce"; 2 - the garbage cans in the visiting area were removed because many visitors left the bags they received there; 3 - at the end of the day, after visiting hours, the monitors would collect the remaining garbage from the beach. In December 2009, a change was made in procedures because many of the garbage bags given to visitors were found blowing in the wind, thus creating more waste. The issuing of garbage bags was suspended. The trails are monitored for two factors, their general physical condition and daily status. The maintenance of their physical condition takes place in the period before the high season and removes vegetation that covers the trail, while keeping them narrow (a maximum of 1 -meter wide) as a protective measure. All of the drainage channels and support structures (steps) are checked, and if necessary, they are repaired or replaced. The daily condition of the trail is a consequence of the weather. Many times an intense rain can make it necessary to close some portions for up to three days, while they dry. This measure considers not only visitor safety, but also the conservation of the trail. One of the conflicts mentioned above, arises on warm, sunny days when the trails are closed because it had rained on previous days. On these days, the staff often suffers considerable pressure, which is not always pleasant, from visitors and boat operators who want the trails to be opened. These conflicts were considerably reduced after the morning contacts were established with the boat operators. The daily visits to the trails follow the norms that define: 1 - the maximum number of people per group; 2- the time between the departure of one group and another to avoid meeting on the trail, 3 - the routes to be taken to avoid intense impact. The trail visits are the most important moment in the relationships with tourists because it is the best opportunity to pass on information about the various aspects of the Island, its vulnerability and the need for respectful interaction. In the act of passing on knowledge and values, the monitors become educators, and through raising public awareness, create new adherents to conservation actions on Campeche Island. Numeric Indicators Compliance with the defined supportability is verified through monitoring of the number of arriving visitors. To do so, a count is made of the people arriving at the beach, and at the points where they initially board the boats, to see that the pre-defined transport quota is respected. This work, because of its importance, is conducted with special care because the results are entered in reports that are sent to government agencies. In case of noncompliance with the rules, these are the proofs needed to issue penalties, which may include fines. Table 1 shows the total monthly arrivals at Campeche Island each summer since 2005. After April, visits to the island decline and are not made regularly. This season, until December, is known as the low season and is not considered in the analysis.

Since then, monitors have been chosen more carefully for this function and they have received more training about data collection and filling in the forms. The graph below (Figure 9) reveals the intense flow of visitors in the months of January, followed by February and March, with the later reduced by the beginning of the school year. December is not typical: although the average number of visitors is similar to March, it is highly concentrated in the last week of the month. (Figure 10). Figure 9. Monthly visits. Journal of Coastal Research, Special Issue No. 61, 201 1 239</page><page sequence="7">Costa Chamas and Schmidt The data referring to the trails are also registered on daily charts whose information will compose the monthly report. In this case, there was also an improvement in the data collected since 2006/07, which is shown in Table 2, below. FigurelO. Daily visits in December 2009. The difference in the use of land and underwater trails can be best seen in the graph (Figure 11). The data allows establishing a comparative analysis between the number of visitors and use of land and underwater trails (Figure 12).

The increased number of visitors and the impacts are visible in the summer months. To evaluate the characteristics and extent of the problems, monitoring was organized so that, Journal of Coastal Research, Special Issue No. 61, 201 1 240</page><page sequence="8">Ecotourism and Heritage Conservation through data collection, information could be used to make decisions based on the information obtained. One decision, the determination of the maximum number of daily visits, was the result of a support-capacity study (MAZZER, 2007) to adjust the movement of tourists to the characteristics of Campeche Island. This measure reduced the impact and improved visits because conditions for attending visitors improved. The Portaria [Administrative Rule] (BRASIL, 2009), was an important element for protecting Campeche Island. Nevertheless, the situation would be completely different if an effort had not been made since the beginning of the process to bring together the various groups each year and establish agreements. In reality, the Administrative Rule is a synthesis of all the agreements made, and for this reason, was more easily applied. The inclusion of all the groups in the process facilitates the monitoring and inspection. An example is the reorganization of the data collection at the boat arrivals after the summer of 2005/2006. The perception that mistakes were made in data collection arose through communications from boat operators concerned with compliance by their competitors. Another element that improved accuracy of the information produced was the need to establish responsibility for their contents because their final destination was public agencies, and the report was used to apply penalties. The data about the arrivals is important for establishing the size of the staff needed. For example, in the last week of December (Figure 10), in January, and during Carnival week, and certain other days, the monitoring staff is increased. During the off season (April - November), when visiting is not regular, there is a reduced staff (two people) who only go to the Island when there are visitors at the departure pier. It is important to note that the graphs indicate only trends, and that there are external factors that lead to unforeseen situations such as the similar number of visitors in January 2008 and February 2009, respectively 13,642 and 13,335 (Table 1). The factors identified include the weather (long rainy periods) and economic instability (the economic crises in Argentina which strongly affects tourism in southern Brazil). The visible difference between use of the land and underwater trails (Figure 1 1 ) is principally due to the greater offer of land routes, and the fact that the aquatic activities require certain skills and physical conditioning. After April, the underwater trails are suspended due to the drop in water temperature, and only track trails are available. The data in Figure 12 indicate a great contrast between the arrivals and the use of trails, considered here as a total of the land and underwater trails. The first explanation is the limits on the use of trails explained above, which represents a bottleneck in the organization of visits. It should also be considered that most tourists opt to only visit the beach. As indicated, all monitoring conducted results directly in evaluations and adaptations. Thus, in this process of successive approximations, the management method is gradually established, with the participation of the various groups involved. CONCLUSION The protection of Campeche Island takes place through a process conducted by the federal government with the participation of civil society. In the history of this process three elements are highlighted because of their importance: public awareness, the establishment of regulations and monitoring. The public awareness takes place through the exchange of information which leads to inclusion and participation. Sensing that they are participants, individuals or groups better accept the restrictions, and may come to support the monitoring and inspections. Because this operates initially on educational factors, this completes a cycle that is renewed as long as no element fails to exist and the government remains the conductor of the processes.
