BYZANTINE AESTHETICS AND BASIL OF CAESAREA* La vraie beauté est celle qui dépasse toute intelligence et puissance humaine et que l'Esprit seul est capable de contempler 1 Introduction When entering a Byzantine church any visitor is amazed by the over- whelming wealth of imagery. What the initiated visitor knows is that to the orthodox believer these images are not decoration in a modern and art his- torian sense, but the logoi of God and the visible proof of the effectuation of God's incarnation. The image/icon is holy because it communicates knowledge of the orthodox tradition and serves the believer who seeks enlightenment. The holy image2 has a didactic as well as a mimetic purpose to the believer, who should contemplate as well as imitate the lives of Christ, the Theotokos, and the saints3. The substratum of religious life in Byzantium was faith in an axiomatic continuum of the Eastern orthodox tradition and a one-God concept built upon an orthodox twofold identification of the image of God, the God-Man Jesus Christ. Visualizations of the holy drama interacted not only with the The present article is a rewritten and enlarged version of my paper Beauty in the Eyes of God.

French, tr. by T. Špidlík, La sophi- ologie de S. Basile ( OCA , 162), Rome, 1961, p. 232. 2 My notion of "holy image" relates to 'image' (sIkcdv) as an historical material reality, in a patristic sense material likeness reflecting spiritual realities. It also relates to God's two- fold identification as human and supra mundane that God is present both in humanity and divinity. It concerns the image of God in humankind; of what is made in divine imagery, and in what it consists. 3 On corporeality in Byzantine aesthetics and Basil's idea of imitation of the "good works" of the saints, see A.

What the orthodox believer experienced was an image of God's kingdom. Point of Departure The article is part of my research project titled: The Image of God in Byzantine Cappadocia : an Investigation of Its Relation to Divine and Human in Fourth-Century Cappadocian Thinking 4. The project explores the distinction between God is (not what God is) and God acts in Byzantine aesthetics; how transcendence, the inexplicable uncircumscription of God interacts inseparably with God's presence in the visible world (immanence). Vital for my methodology is that we must first recognize dogmatic praxis and subsequently ask the question why. The purpose of the article is twofold. First, I will explore how Basil of Caesarea preaches on the notion of beauty and good. For sources, I primarily turn to his homilies On the Hexaemeron , but also to his treatise On the Holy Spirit 5, and to a minor extent to some other of his works. Second, based on Basil's reflections on and models of explaining beauty and good, I will map out how Byzantine aesthetics identify not only God's comprehensible imma- nence (humanity and presence in the world), but also the beauty of its insep- arable communion with God's incomprehensible transcendence (divinity). I will explore the causal connection between the orthodox idea of beauty and 4 The image material is primarily from Haçli kilise (beginning of the 10th c.), Tokali kilise, the Old church and the New church (mid 10th c.), the three "églises à colonnes" Çankli kilise, Elmali kilise, and Karanlik kilise (mid 1 Ith c.), and to a minor extent El Nazar kilise (mid 10th c.)« All the churches are located in Göreme, Cappadocia, in the Anatolian mountainous region of what is now central Turkey. The dating of El Nazar derives from an electronic reference by C. Jolivet-Lévy, Archéologie religieuse du monde byzantin et arts chrétiens d'Orient , in Annuaire de l'Ecole pratique des hautes études ( EPHE ), Section des sciences religieuses , 115 (2008), mis en ligne le 21 octobre 2008 (URL: http://asr.revues.org/ index266.html). G. DE Jerphanion, the first researcher to systematically map out the rock-cut churches/chapels of Byzantine Cappadocia coined the notion "églises à colonnes" ( Une nou- velle province de l'art byzantin. Les églises rupestres de Cappadoce , vol. 1 : 1-2, Texte, Paris, 1925-1932, p. 377). Depictions of Basil of Caesarea remain in the churches of Tokali, Çankli, Elmali, and Karanlik. 5 For these texts, we have used the following editions and translations: Basile de Cesaree.

How patristicism, the theology or mode of thought of the church fathers that founded the basis of Byzantine culture, also consti- tutes the conceptual basis for the specificity of Byzantine aesthetics. My study will explore Byzantine aesthetics based on Basil's thinking as theory and method. My study does not provide a direct link between written logos and painted logos. It is not a direct Quellenanalyse , nor a systematic study of Basil's homilies On the Hexaemeron , or his treatise On the Holy Spirit , neither is it a comparative study of the two. Either of these perspectives is a task for a book, not an article. I also want to call attention to the fact that statements concerning images in the texts of Basil of Caesarea have a dif- ferent aspect to them than they do in Byzantine image theology and the polemical writings in favor of holy images by later Iconodules, such as John Damascene. The chronological as well as the historical background against which the texts in question were written differ. As Andrew Louth has correctly emphasized, when referring to images, trained rhetors such as the Cappadocian fathers Basil of Caesarea and Gregory of Nyssa spoke of mental images in a rhetorical culture: they are about the way in which the skilled rhetor in such a culture can conjure up visual images in the minds of his audience ... They fit into John's [Dama- scene] argument in a rather oblique way, for what John is concerned to dem- onstrate is the necessity of actual visual images of Christ, the Mother of God and the saints - icons painted, woven, carved or inscribed. That is not the point made by the Cappadocian fathers at all; they are using images - evoked rather than "actual" (though are evoked images any less "actual" than actual images?) to lead the minds of their audience to experience the events described, as if they had been there in person6. We know that Basil of Caesarea is one of the three hierarchs of the Orthodox Church, and as such commemorated at each Orthodox liturgy7. Thus, Basil's status as one of the dogmatic pillars of the Orthodox Church and his vital role for Byzantine theology are undisputed. In addition, I argue that Basil was of crucial importance for Byzantine image theology and Byzantine aesthetics, because of his choice of rhetoric and theological language. For example, when speaking of God and the divine in his homi- lies On the Hexaemeron , Basil returns repeatedly to the faculty of vision. By way of a subtle religious language, Basil refers to the divine reality in terms of different pictorial metaphors. Later image theologians such as 6 A. Louth, The Cappadocians and the Areopagite in the Iconoclasmi in J. B0RTNES and T. Hägg (eds.), Gregory ofNazianzus. Images and Reflections , Copenhagen, 2006, p. 277 . 7 The other two are the Cappadocian father Gregory Nazianzen and John Chrysostom.</page><page sequence="4">168 ANNE KARAHAN John Damascene and Theodore of Stoudios transferred both directly and indirectly Basil's mode of thought, interpretations, and metaphors into a physical world of holy images. Basil's way of speaking about the invisible God in terms of metaphors is still today utterly suitable for deepening our understanding of Byzantine aesthetics. From the outset, I will map out some reasons for choosing the thought of Basil of Caesarea as a model for exploring Byzantine aesthetics. In the following paragraph, I will discuss Byzantine corporeality and balanced kinetics, partly based on Basil's idea that a carnal man's mind is not trained in contemplation, but remains buried in the mud of fleshy lusts. I will examine how the familiar world around us relates to corruption and in what sense it deviates from the idea of what should be imitated. I will also consider how Basil discusses Christ's divinity in terms of the Lord being ripe in beauty and how divine knowledge, in an orthodox sense, relates to spiritual beauty. Moreover, I will focus on the causality between Byzantine aesthetics and the Christian tradition 'of right belief' (ôpOóSoÇoç). I will explore why and how Byzantine aesthetics identifies the right (ôpGoSó^coç) manner of teaching about God (Geo^oyía). I will discuss Basil's criticism of the futile transitoriness of corporeal beauty and his emphasis on contemplation of the type of beauty that leads from the transi- tory to the eternal. What is beautiful in an orthodox sense, and how does the orthodox idea of beauty relate to Byzantine corporeality, form, shape, perspective, and light effects? The two last paragraphs are devoted to my hypothesis that patterned borders, circles, brilliance and light, gems, gold, silver, and pearls constitute apophatic meta-images of God's divinity. They identify in congruence with orthodox belief the incomprehensibility and uncircumscription of God. In my concluding remarks, I will analyze how coexistence and interaction of portraits, narration, corporeality, light, brilliance, and patterned borders answer to God's twofold identification. How and why interaction of human and divine is a prerequisite for salva- tion of humankind. How the specificity of Byzantine aesthetics relates to Cappadocian apophatic theology. Why Basil of Caesarea? My choice of Basil for exploring why and how the specificity of Byzan- tine aesthetics answers to patristicism might seem bizarre, since Basil dis- cusses at length the human inability of accurate perception. In his sixth homily On the Hexaemeron , he enlightens his addressees on the precarious reliability of sight by referring to God's creation of the sun and the moon:</page><page sequence="5">BEAUTY IN THE EYES OF GOD 1 69 'And God made the two great lights8' ... The size of objects seen at great distances is naturally reduced, since the power of sight is not able to cover the space between . . . since our visual impression is small, by imposing its own quality on the visible objects, it causes that which is seen to be considered small. Therefore, if the visual impression is false, its judgment is untrust- worthy (MiKpà oův f| oij/iç fļļicov yvyvojiévri, [iiKpà ¿Tcolrjas vo|xlÇsa0ai xà ópcò^eva, xò oíksiov rcáÔoç xoïç ópaxoíç èTiicpépouaa. "Qaxs yeúôex ai f| ovj/iç, ôbuaxov xò Kpixf|piov) ... our visual impression, being spent in the air, becomes faint and is not sufficient for the accurate perception (xfļv ducpipfļ KaxaXrļVļ/iv) of the objects viewed9. That is, our vision is not enough for perceiving the greatness of God, not even the greatness of the things created by God. Basil emphasizes that human sight does not preserve the shapes. From a hilltop the yokes of oxen and plowers look like ants, and from a mountain, the islands and the trading vessels do not look bigger than a dove. Our sight says that the great moun- tains are round and smooth. The light is thus infinitely greater than it appears (Méyaç oòv ó (pcocrriļp . . . Kai à7reip07cX,aaícov xoC (paivoļievou)10. At heart of Basil's discussion is of course the idea of the limitations of human perception (ôiávoia) and human nature. Humans cannot take in and understand the total implication of God. In comparison to God's is and the Creation human perception is small, that is human nature is circumscribed, whereas God is uncircumscribed. I argue that Basil's syllogism verifies why the third dimension is inap- propriate in a Byzantine orthodox context. Basil's mode of thought facili- tates and deepens our understanding of the different kinds of inverted per- spectives and flattened corporeality that characterizes Byzantine aesthetics. Narration of the holy drama in the three dimensions of length, breadth, and depth would set the event solely within physical law and human perception, and disregard divine law. Belief in the two natures of God demands deline- ations that respect both the human laws of circumscription and the divine laws of infinite measure. To draw a holy image has nothing to do with the science of sight, optics, because, orthodox faith in "accurate perception" does not relate to how human eyes erroneously perceive the visible world. It does not concern the art of delineating persons and solid objects upon a plane surface so that the drawing produces the same impression of apparent relative positions and magnitudes, or of distance, as do the persons and/or the actual objects when viewed from a particular point. The predominant theory of perspective that characterizes much art of the Italian Renaissance, 8 Gen. 1.16. 9 Basil of Caesarea, Hexaemeron , 6.9. 1U Ibidem.</page><page sequence="6">170 ANNE KARAHAN for example, would have failed to produce the desired effect. Only suitable are such shapes, forms, and perspectives that can help bridge the gap between God and humankind, such features that emphasize the twofold identification of God. A second important reason for choosing Basil is the massive impact of his proclamation of the "equal force in true religion" of the unwritten (aypcupoq) and the written (syypacpoq) tradition. The teachings of the Church, Basil underscored, whether publicly proclaimed (Kf|pi)y|ia) or reserved to members of the household of faith (ôóy|iaxa) is an uninter- rupted transmission of spiritual authority through a succession of bishops from the apostles downward. "Dogma (ôóyjia) is one thing", Basil empha- sized, "kerygma (Kf|poy|ia) another; the first is observed in silence, while the latter is proclaimed to the world"11. During the era of iconomachy12, image defenders turned Basil's mode of thought into a rock-solid argument for authorization of holy images on apostolic grounds13. John Damascene wrote: just as throughout the universe the gospel has been proclaimed without being written, so throughout the universe there has been handed down, without being 11 Basil of Caesarea, De Spiritu sancto , 27.66 (we only slightly changed the translation of Anderson, pp. 98-100): "Concerning the teachings of the Church, whether publicly pro- claimed or reserved to members of the household of faith, we have received some from the written sources (Téõv èv xfļ 'EiacAjļaia rcecputaiynévcov Ôoy|iàx(ûv Kai KT|pi)yji&lt;XTC0v, ta |xèv ¿k TÍjç èyypácpou 5i8aaKa^íaç), while others have been given to us secretly (1 Cor. 2.7), through apostolic tradition (èie tÍ1ç tcöv àrcoCTTÓtaôv rcapaSóaeooę). Both sources have equal force in true religion. No one would deny either source - no one, at any rate, who is even slightly familiar with the ordinances of the Church. If we attacked unwritten traditions (za äypacpa tõ&gt;v èôcov), claiming them to be of little importance, we would fatally mutilate the Gospel, no matter what our intentions - or rather, we would reduce the Gospel teachings to bare words". 12 Iconomachy (eÍKOVOjiaxéG), 'war against images') is the notion used by the Byzan- tines for what later scholars has named Iconoclasm.

All of these were established practices in Church life, although we find none of them documented in the writings of the New Testament; their authority as traditions is unwritten in form but apostolic in origin16. Based on Basil's line of argument, John Damascene, but also other Iconodules argued that there was no need for consolidation in the Scriptures for utilizing images of Christ and the saints. Images belong to the unwritten tradition. A third reason is Basil's statement in his homily On the Holy Forty Mar- tyrs , where he refers to the 'painter' (Çcoypcupoç) of painted images that is 'paintings on tablets' (ypacpf|, nivaQ. Basil emphasizes that what the word (^óyoç) communicates by sound, the art of painting (ypcupiKiļ) communi- cates silently by imitation (8ià |ii|if|ae(ûç)17. Later at the Seventh Ecumen- ical Council of Nicaea in 787 use of holy icons was authorized by stating that through the two media of text and image, "which accompany each other ... we acquire the knowledge of the same realities"18. In this context, it is crucial to remember that the Greek noun ypacpf) denotes an inscription as well as a drawing, and the verb ypácpco implies the act of painting as well as describing. Not only is word and image interrelated, but also the action of painting and what is depicted and unfolded in this act. This semantic fourfold communion is essential for the outcome of Byzantine theological aesthetics. The Byzantine world of religious images is founded upon a semantic catenation of word and image, the act of the artist, and what he/ she unfolds. A fourth and vital reason is Basil's choice of theological language. For example, in his Epistula II addressed to Gregory Nazianzen, Basil empha- sizes that in the study of the divinely inspired Scriptures, the lives of saintly 14 John Damascene, Contra imaginum calumniatores, 11.16; Eng. tr. by J.

He compares the painter, who persistently observes his model, to the believer, who should as indefatigably imitate the actions of the saints: just as painters in working from models constantly gaze at their exemplar and thus strive to transfer the expression of the original to their own artistry, so too he who is anxious to make himself perfect in all the kinds of virtue must gaze upon the lives of the saints as upon statues, so to speak, that move and act, and must make their excellence his own by imitation20. In his rhetorical metaphors on human perception, Basil repeatedly con- textualizes his narration within the world of arts. In first homily On the Hexaemeron , when explaining how God in the beginning made Heaven and Earth, the world is compared to a work of art (ó KÓajaoç T8%vikóv) "set before all for contemplation, so that through it the wisdom of Him who cre- ated it should be known"21. The creative arts (7toir|TiK(£&gt;v TZ%vcbv): even though the action ceases, the work remains, as that of architecture, car- pentry, metal work, weaving, and of as many such arts as, even if the crafts- man is not present, ably manifest in themselves the artistic processes of thoughts, and make possible for you to admire the architect from his work, as well as the metal worker and the weaver. That it might be shown, then, that the world is a work of art22. Basil distinguishes between creative, practical, and theoretical arts. Prac- tical arts such as dancing and flute playing have no permanent value; they have no meaning, because they stop when the motion stops, whereas the aim of theoretical arts is the action of mind. Creative arts, however, have a permanent value, because we can admire the creator from his work. What Basil's metaphor subtly highlights is the contrast between permanence (con- templation) versus impermanence (motion) that is good versus bad. In the context of Byzantine aesthetics, Basil's discussion sheds light on not only why lifelike corporeal kinetics fails to represent the value of permanence, but also why to fit a "model" for contemplation Byzantine aesthetics had to 19 Basil of Caesarea, Epistula , II, in R.

Basil recognizes the Scriptures itself as a temple, into which the reader as worshipper penetrates (cf. Hexaemeron , 2.1). Cf. P. Rousseau, Basil of Caesarea {The Transformation of the Classical Heritage , 20), Berkeley- Los Angeles - Oxford, 1994, p. 329. 20 Basil of Caesarea, Epistula , II (Deferrari, I, pp. 16-17). 21 Basil of Caesarea, Hexaemeron , 1.7. 22 Basil of Caesarea, Hexaemeron , 1.7.</page><page sequence="9">BEAUTY IN THE EYES OF GOD 173 adjust the visible to a "realism" suitable for contemplation of the eternal divine. I will come back to this later in the article. My fifth reason relates to the impact of Basil's thinking on the doctrinal writings on the cult of images at the Council of Nicaea in 787. Ten out of seventy-seven quotations originated from Basil. Of especial importance to the Iconodules was a passage in his anti- Arian treatise On the Holy Spirit , 18.45. Discussing the Trinitarian issue, Basil utilized the image of the emperor as an analogy for God not being "one, two, or three", or "first, second, and third", God says, "I am the first and I am the last"23, and Basil concluded: We have never to this present day heard of a second God . . . The Son is in the Father and the Father in the Son; what the Father is, the Son is likewise and vice- versa - such is the unity. As unique Persons, they are one and one; as sharing a common nature, both are one. How does one and one not equal two Gods? Because we speak of the emperor, and the emperor's image - but not two emperors. The power is not divided, nor the glory separated ... the honor given the image passes to the prototype. The image of the emperor is an image by imitation, but the Son is a natural image; in works of art the likeness is dependent on its original form, and since the divine nature is not composed of parts, union of the persons is accomplished by partaking of the whole. The Holy Spirit ... is united to the Father and the Son as unit dwells with unit24. During the iconoclastic controversy25, Basil's statement came to be used as an orthodox raison d'etre for authorizing images of Christ, the Theo- tokos, and the saints. John Damascene, the most committed of image defenders, together with other Iconodules turned the belief in the image of God (sIkcdv too Geou) into one of the most important of orthodox argu- ments for authorizing holy images. Yet this was not at all that Basil had had in mind. When speaking of Christ as the image of God (síkòv tod GeoC), neither Basil nor the other two Cappadocian fathers referred to material images. Despite that, later fathers used their modes of thought on Christol- ogy and soteriology, but also Trinitarian theology in the most resourceful and creative of ways to authorize use of holy images on orthodox grounds. Orthodox image theology was verified through patristicism. In his Three treatises against those who attack and speak against holy images , John Damascene presented an entire cosmology that linked Creator 23 Is. 44.6. 24 Basil of Caesarea, De Spiritu sancto , 18.45. 25 L. Brubaker argued, at a lecture held at the Annual Meeting of the Swedish Byzantine Society, at The Swedish Collegium for Advanced Study , at Uppsala, Sweden, May 8, 2010, that there is only written proof of active imperial iconoclasm between 750-775 and 833-842, i.e. only during a period of 34 years.</page><page sequence="10">174 ANNE KARAHAN and Creation through a comprehensive schema of images26. A holy image of Christ proved that God had taken flesh, according to John and his fellow orthodox advocates. Resurrection and salvation depended on Christ's suf- fering in the flesh, the twofold identification of the God-Man. Thus, repu- diation of holy images nullified not only the Incarnation, but also the salva- tion of humankind. It was not a question of worshipping matter. Since, as John Damascene emphasizes in his Second Treatise, §19, if destroyed the image can even be thrown into the fire. My sixth reason related to my fifth, also concerns Basil's mode of thought on Christology and Trinitarian theology. To explain the ó|iooóaioç ('of the same substance') concept Basil had introduced the identification of one ooaia (substance) and three U7ioaxáasiç (Persons)27. He argued that ļiia oôaía xpeîç Ď7ioaxáasi&lt;; was the only acceptable formula for the Trin- ity28. To Basil, oôaía denoted the existence, or essence, or substantial entity of God, while Ô7ióaxaaiç signified the existence in a particular mode, the manner of being of each Persona29. Basil explained the term oļaoooaiov as relational - the divine oôaía is the Father's ooaia, shared with the Son by begetting him and with the Spirit through procession30. Basil declared that faith confesses distinction in ôrcóaxaaiç and community in oôaía; ímóaxaaiç relates to the individuality of each, whereas oôaía relates to the principle of community31. Basil identified the idea of co- inherence (rcepi^copriaię) of the ímóaxaaiç one within the other and accentuated the properties of the three ôrcoaxáaeiç Fatherhood, Sonship, and Sanctification32. Philip Rousseau has emphasized that "it was the qual- ity of 'being related' that claimed priority, and problems connected with the mode of generation were of less significance - indeed, they were, in the 26 The most recent English translation is A.

In the third part, On the Orthodox Faith , of his exposition of the Christian Ortho- dox tradition, The Fountainhead of Knowledge , John Damascene much later argued that interpénétration, co-inherence (7uepi%G)pr|Giç) signifies not only the relation of the three divine persons (ÒTiocrráaeiç) of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, but also the two natures of divine and human in the God-Man34. On the Christological issue, Basil underlined in Homily 24, Against the Sabellians, the Avians, and the Anomoians : "the Son (Christ) is from the Father by generation (y£VVT1T&lt;Sę) and expresses in Himself the Father by nature (cpuaiKcbç); as an image He is absolutely without difference, as gen- erated He preserves the same essence as the Father". Based on the relation between emperor and emperor's image, Basil again brought up that the image of the emperor does not cause an existence of two emperors. He also pointed out that, the imperial image is of wood, wax, and colors, a result of the art of the painter. It is "a corruptible image, in imitation of something corruptible"35. By this statement, Basil acknowledged that the image of the invisible God, Jesus Christ is neither a second God nor an imitation of something corruptible. Exempted from deterioration, the natural image of God identifies the divine. The Trinity identifies a community in substance. Yet, God's triune is and the image of God is a monotheistic concept. In an orthodox sense, it is not possible to disunite God's humanity from God's divinity other than in a theoretical dogmatic sense: Jesus Christ is as much human as divine. God incarnated is, however, never only human, neither only divine. Therefore, I argue, any identification of God, written, spoken, or painted, that disre- gards God's interaction of human and divine is nothing short of heresy. 33 Basil of Caesarea, Contra Eunomium , 2.20-22, ed.

To those well acquainted with patristi- cism my hypothesis might seem ridiculous and highly ignorant, since all fathers with fervor denounce any materialization of the divine36. 1 find sup- port for my hypothesis in Basil's discussion on how the triune God created humankind in On the origin of humanity , Discourse , 1 : On that which is according to the image : You have learned that there are two persons (rcpoacorca), the one who speaks and the one to whom the speech is addressed. Why did he not say, "Make," but, "Let us make a human being"? That you may know the sovereignty, that in acknowledging the Father you may not reject the Son; that you may leam that the Father created through the Son, and the Son created by the Father's will; that you may glorify the Father in the Son, and the Son in the Holy Spirit. Thus you have been made a common work, that you may be a worshiper of both together, not dividing the worship but uniting the Godhead37. Basil continues: It says, "God made the human being," that you may unite (évcocrnç) the God- head and unite (êvôXTflç) not the hypostases but the power (xf| ôuvájiei), that you may have one glory (|xíav ôó^av) not divided in the worship (rcpocncovTļ- aiv), not divined into polytheism. It does not say, "The gods made the human being," but, "God made ('Ercolrļaev ó 0eóç)." The hypostasis of the Father is proper to him, and that of the Son is proper to him, and that of the Holy Spirit is proper to him. Then why are there not three gods? Because the God- head is one ("Oti 'iia 08ÓTi1ç). For that Godhead which I see in the Father, the same also is in the Son; and that which is in the Holy Spirit, the same also is in the Son. Since there is one form in each of them, the causation from the Father is also the same in the Son (Aióxi ļiopcpfļ è v ¿Kaxepcp ļiia, Kai ap^fļ àrcò riaxpòç èv Yiœ f| aoriļ). Because of this, our worship and praise (rcpoaia)vr|cnę Kai bo^oXoyiá) are also one. The prelude to our creation is true theology (Geo^oyla àÀ,r|0ivfj) ... God is without form and simple ('Aa%ri|i&lt;maToç ó 0eóç, ànX ouç). Do not imagine a shape (ļaop(pfļv) in regard to him ... Do not enclose God in bodily concepts, nor circumscribe him according to your own mind. He is incomprehensible in greatness38. 36 On patristic authorities, significance of dogma, and Byzantine aesthetics in the Late Byzantine image program of the Chora church, Istanbul, see A.

The Trinity is without shape and structure. Moreover, the creation of humankind is a work of God. Humankind is created from true divinity (Geo^oyia) that is from God's incomprehensible, uncircumscribed, and invisible is. In addition, on the Christological issue Basil objects in his treatise On the Holy Spirit in a polemical attack on "the heresy of Sabellius": I am referring to those who use intervals of time (8iacn;f|ļiaai) to separate the Son from the Father, saying there was a time when the Son was not, or the Spirit from the Son calling the Spirit a created being39. Based on Basil's modes of thought, paradoxical as it may seem, to indi- cate the God-Man in a holy image demands identification of the divinity (0eoX,oyia) of the God-Man, in some way or another. Lack of divine con- notation would identify Christ as solely human, and not as God-Man. It would rescind salvation of humankind. Since the gift of Divine grace through the Passion dogmatically depends on the twofold orthodox reality of interaction of divine and human. To deepen our understanding of Byzantine aesthetics and its communion of divine and human, it is pivotal to recognize its context of faith. Of vast importance is Basil's emphasis that the holy drama is a historical event with identifications beyond the interval of time (5iácrcr|na), together with his seminal trinitarian definitions: the triune Godhead is one, divine nature is simple and not composed of parts, union of the three persons is a partaking of the whole. To sum up, my first reason for choosing Basil is his emphasis on the shortcomings of human perception of the created. His opinion on the inac- curacy of human perception concurs with the lack of third dimensional per- spectives in holy images. Of great importance also is his emphasis on the equal apostolic force of the written and unwritten traditions, which over time relates to the undisputable role of holy images in orthodox religious life. Moreover, Basil compares and links imitation of the spoken word (^óyoç) with imitation of the lives of the saints (referred to as painted images, in a mental sense of course). His idea is imperative for a deeper comprehension of why and how Byzantine corporeality and perspectives do not pertain to human optics. Orthodox theology focuses on spiritual imita- tion not physical ditto. Basil's statement verifies that word and image are associated. Operating within the context of a rhetorical culture, Basil does 39 Basil of Caesarea, De Spiritu sancto , 25.59 (Aéyco ôf| xoúxouç oï xpoviKOÏç Siacrrfļ- 'iaai toÎ) (lèv Ilaxpòç xòv Yióv, xoC ôè Ylou xò IlveCļaa xò ãyiov ôiaipoõai).</page><page sequence="14">178 ANNE KARAHAN not refer to material and tangible holy images. Yet, Basil employs visual and narrative metaphors and theological language that discuss God, crea- tion, and cosmology in terms of image, art, and sculpture. God is the Arti- san and Architect. The rich rhetorical imagery of Basil is his signum. In addition, it emphasizes the cardinal role of the created and ordered world to render knowledge. The believer who contemplates the created universe in a right manner will come closer to God. The way Basil speaks on doctrinal matters is pertinent in the context of holy images. Of great impact for the specificity of Byzantine aesthetics are his definitions on God as twofold (Christology) and God as triune (Trinitarian theology). The image of God and the Trinity is one. God identifies a common divine nature not com- posed of parts, the union of three persons is accomplished by partaking of the whole. The Son is generated from the Father, thus he is not circum- scribed within intervals of time and space. In the following five paragraphs, I will explore Byzantine aesthetics based on Basil's conceptions and beliefs and the Eastern orthodox tradition. Imitation of What? Balanced Kinetics and Corporeality The issue of imitation in an orthodox context concerns the eternal divine. The orthodox believer should focus on and imitate actions that lead to like- ness with God, actions that do not finish when they end. Suitable for imita- tion are persons, subjects, and objects that lead to communication with God and a future life in God. Beauty of the body, in an orthodox sense, equals corporeal identifications that help the believer on her/his journey towards eternal deification. The beauty of the human body lies in its potential use for reaching God. Beauty in a holy image is that which gives impetus to contemplation and imitation of God's divine nature. Beauty equals aesthetics that can develop the image of God within the believer. Focus is not on impermanence, but permanence. The Theotokos and all other saints are particularly close to God. Having lived their lives in divine likeness, saints are deemed worthy and suitable for imitation. They have imitated the life of Christ and have a message, moral and spiritual. Saintly men lie before us like living images of God's government, for our imitation of their good works, as we heard Basil emphasize earlier40. Saints focus beyond the earthly. Thus, they are included in the holy drama as persons with corporeal features and semantics relating to the eternal divine. A saint constitutes a link between Heaven and Earth. 40 Basil of Caesarea, Epistula , II (see our notes 19-20).</page><page sequence="15">BEAUTY IN THE EYES OF GOD 179 A saint's life is like a sacred book. By appreciating and paying close atten- tion to the Scriptures, the saints identify divine knowledge41. Basil recognizes humankind as made in the image of the Creator42. Whereas Basil's brother and the youngest of the three Cappadocian fathers Gregory of Nyssa frequently affirm the idea that the image of God is pre- sent in humankind43. Gregory also emphasizes, "Christianity is the imita- tion {mimesis) of God's nature"44. Gregory Nazianzen, the third Cappado- cian, emphasizes that humankind possesses a portion of God, and this particle of divinity constitutes the potential of eternal life in each human being45. Gregory Nazianzen speaks of God's grace and points out that a "divine particle" was offered to humankind with the breath of life46, whereas Gregory of Nyssa declares, "if man's heart has been purified from every creature and all unruly affections, he will see the Image of the Divine Nature in his own beauty"47. Saints identify individuals who have purified themselves. They are holy because they communicate with their own "divine particle". Saints have succeeded in imitating Christ, the image of God. Thus, they are closer to God than the rest of the believers. Saints are in likeness with God. For that reason, saints constitute models for imitation. A saint's likeness with God makes her/him beautiful. Saints are certainly not beautiful because of their gorgeous athletic bodies. The bodies of saints identify association with the divine and dissociation from corruption. Flattened corporeality and kinetic ethereal effects associate holy persons with the incomprehensible divine. Sometimes their bodies are hovering in space, or their portraits are set against golden backgrounds to imply divine connotation. (Figure 1) I argue that the ideological underpinning to the characteristic equanimity and self-control of holy persons in Byzantine aesthetics is in the belief that God identifies balance; God created the cosmos and in Greek, the word kó&lt;7|ioç denotes both universe and order. Balanced versus unbalanced and lopsided kinetics dichotomize the spiritual beauty of holy persons from the lack of spiritual beauty of individuals who have isolated themselves from God, individuals who lack divine knowledge, who are not cured, but mor- ally impure and ignorant of the divine.

In the motif of his Treason at Çankli kilise, at Göreme, Cappado- cia, the different parts of his body identify disequilibrium, both in size and kinetic energy. The size of Judas' head is only a third of the head of Christ. The depiction indicates how Judas is out of spiritual balance, his contem- plative capacity is darkened and his likeness with God abortive. (Figure 2) In perfected serene balance stands the God-Man upright beside him. The human image of God personifies the supreme model for imitation. Those who imitate Christ, but also the Theotokos and the saints will obtain moral control and spiritual perfection. To have God actively present in your soul, to imitate and act as Christ and the saints imparts harmony48. Stephen M. Hildebrand has well remarked that for Basil, salvation (acoTTļpia) is knowledge that "includes and presupposes moral righteous- ness". Moral impurity attributes to ignorance. To cure ignorance demands restoration of moral purity49. Moral progress, from Basil's point of view, is the only positive change (nsxaßoXi|)50. All other changes relate to some- thing dire, undesirable, and ominous. The actions of Satan of course iden- tify the worst of changes. Holy images distinguish this by depicting Christ in balanced kinetics and worthy appearances, whereas Satan, Hades, and the devils are out of corporeal balance, sometimes with absurd physiogno- mies, or chained and devoid of power. Significant examples are in the motifs of the Anastasis, the Temptations of Christ, and the Last Judgment51. (Figure 3) What we are witnessing is the belief that nothing and no one can threaten the power and equilibrium of God. The loadstar of unthreatened divine order and power in Byzantine aesthetics distinctly differs from the visual methods and attitudes in the earlier non-Christian, pagan era of Hellenism. The Greeks had simply started from different assumptions. Evil powers constituted an actual threat. A great example is the sculpture of Laokoon , the priest of the Apollo temple at Troy and his two sons being attacked and killed by two large sea snakes. They fight vigorously and des- perately for their lives, but in the end, they die. (Figure 4) To depict Christ, a saint, or a church father in such a realistic physical fight would have been impossible in Byzantium. The mere idea that either Satan or Hades would have such a potent capacity to threaten God, or the saints, is absurd from an 48 Cf. Basil of Caesarea, De Spiritu sancto , 16.38: The Spirit's power and authority help God's angels to accomplish "the indescribable harmony of the heavenly realm". 49 S. M.

Karahan orthodox viewpoint. The Byzantine Satan or Hades constitutes no real threat to God and the saints. His struggle against Christ in the motifs of the Anastasis and the Temptations is futile, a mission impossible52. It is inter- esting to notice the great dichotomy between the powerless Satan in the East and the powerful Satan in the West. Satan and the devils constitute a real threat in the Latin West53. I argue that the remote role of Satan and the devils in Byzantine holy images also is due to the mimetic role of images in the East. The lives of Satan and the devils constitute no model for imita- tion. Their didactic role is minor. In an orthodox sense, evil identifies igno- rance and lack of divine knowledge54. For theological clarification, I refer 52 Cf. the motif of the Anastasis (mural paintings) at Karanlik kilise and Çankli kilise (Middle Byzantine), Göreme, Cappadocia, and the motif of the Temptations (mosaic) at the Chora church (Late Byzantine), Istanbul. 53 Cf. Satan in the motif of the Last Judgment in Capella degli Scrovegni/the Arena chapel, by Giotto, Padua, Italy, or in Cappella dei Re Magi, in Cattedrale di San Petronio, Bologna, Italy. Both are mural paintings. 54 For discussion, see A.

When exploring latent versus patent kinetics as well as perspectives in Byzantine aesthetics, we should keep in mind that in an orthodox sense only the right kind of change and motion can serve for imitation. In a reli- gious sense, theo logia concerns the divine nature of God/God's is, while oikonomia relates to the incarnation and God's activity in the world. Holy images operate within the context of "belonging to the world of sense" (KoajiiKÓç), that which is "set in order" (koctjuscd) by God, that which is created to serve motion towards God. The great difference is of course that God is believed to have created the cosmos out of nothing (è£ oďk övtcöv)56, whereas the creator of holy images creates out of created matter. Yet, the result of the process of God's Creation as well as the creators of holy images is images that help the believer contemplate, comprehend, and imi- tate God. The created is imperative for human beings who want to reach God through contemplation. However, in his text On the Holy Spirit Basil emphasizes: a carnal man's mind is not trained in contemplation, but remains buried in the mud of fleshy lusts, powerless to look up and see the spiritual light of the truth57. I argue that Basil's statement verifies why Byzantine aesthetics refrains from athletic and/or erotic corporeal beauty. Such athletic, carnal, and vig- orous beauty of graceful and alluring hair, lifelike eyes, and satin-smooth skin, or extreme realism as we find in the aesthetics of Greek and Roman Antiquity would have drawn the beholders' attention to the beauty of the corruptible. In an orthodox context, too fascinating lifelike connotations are dogmatically wrong, since they prevent the believer from indulging in spir- itual contemplation and imitation of that beyond the corruptible. For further support of my hypothesis, I refer to the poem On the Soul5S where Gregory Nazianzen defines the soul as "étant celeste, a supporté d'etre mêlé au ter- restre" (ļiiiļiv àvéxA/ri / Oopaviiļ %0ovioio), et par conséquent s'avère être "une lumière cachée par une caverne" (cpáoç a7if|À,uyyi Ka^DcpGév), et 55 Basil of Caesarea, Quod Deus non est auctor malorum , PG 31, 345 A; Eng. tr. by Rousseau, p. 332.

What we understand from Gregory's statement is that it is in spite of the flesh that the soul is divine and immortal. Such modes of thought that Basil and Gregory present are decisive, if we want to comprehend dogmatic prerequisites for Byzantine aesthetics and corporeality. When contemplating a holy image the orthodox believer should focus on the spiritual light. To identify Christ, the Theotokos, and the saints in refined and sophisticated athletic and carnal beauty would fail to produce the desired effect, since it would give impetus to imitation of carnal life, the flesh that hides the spiritual light from the soul. A gorgeous athletic youth with perfected muscular strength and vigor, such as the Clas- sical Greek youths named "the Diskobolos" and the "Riace Warriors" might instead of causing spiritual inspiration cause the beholder to go for physical sports. Moreover, such aesthetics would induce the beholder not only to remember death, but also to imitate death, a memento mori that would obstruct the believer's actions towards God and eternal life. Holy images indicate proportionate configuration and display figures and shapes, colors and brilliance in such a manner that they offer the believer impetus to go beyond the depicted exposed to destruction. A holy image brings about a sense of serenity, this in line with Basil's emphasis that the very beginning of the soul's purgation is tranquility (i) crocia)60. As already discussed, according to Basil's second letter, the lives of the saints must be gazed upon as statues, so to speak, that move and act. The believer must make their excellence her/his own by imitation. The tranquility and har- mony of holy persons nurtured by closeness to God is a model for imita- tion, whereas the chaotic imbalance of Satan and the devils, destitute of the true Light because of their uproar against God, is an anti-model. Corporeal balance is a sign of spiritual knowledge, whereas corporeal unbalance indi- cates the dangers of absence of divine knowledge. Who is the model and who is the anti-model is blatant, even to those of exceedingly restricted acquaintance with the holy drama. Different kinds of inverted perspectives add to the idea of a sublime and serene divine reality, the transfigured world populated by those who are in spiritual harmony with God. To answer the question imitation of what, we have to understand that the goal of the orthodox believer concerns divine likeness and eternal life. The loadstar is imitation of that which leads to the everlasting incorruptible 59 PG 37, 446-447; French tr. by A. Richard, Cosmologie et théologie chez Grégorie de Nazianze {Collection des Etudes Augustiniennes, Série Antiquité , 169), Paris, 2003, pp. 238-239. 60 Basil of Caesarea, Epistula , II (Deferrari, I, pp. 12-13).</page><page sequence="23">BEAUTY IN THE EYES OF GOD 1 87 reality of God. Imitation of the corruptible does not lead to God. The life- like and three-dimensional relate to created physical law and things exposed to deterioration. Thus, I argue that too close lifelike aesthetics vis-à-vis the familiar world around us is not suitable on religious grounds. Perfected carnation, corporeality, and muscles, as well as lifelike postures identify too patently the corruptible reality within interval of time and space (ôiá- CTTTļļia). The first act of God in Genesis is speech: "And God said, 'Let there be light'". Therefore, in the homilies On the Hexaemeron Basil links God's 'voice' (cpcovfļ) with God's 'word' (Xóyoç), and hence with the Word, his Son and "Co-worker" in the creative act. Basil asks, "Who spoke and who made?" He answers the question with a rhetorical question - "Do you not notice in these words the double Person (to Si7iÀ,oôv tcdv 7cpoaco7ccov)". And Basil continues, "Everywhere in history the teachings of theology are mystically interspersed (IIavTa%oC xfj iaxopía xò 5óy|ia tî1Ç 0eoÀ,oyíaç |iDOTiK(ôç &lt;7i)ļi7tap8&lt;T7iapTai)"61. 1 side with Rousseau, who concludes that to Basil "the nature, the (póaiç, of all that came into being was contained ultimately in the divine word". In the Creation God gave power to the earth62. When God in Genesis says: "Let us make man in our image", Basil interpreted this as the Father turned towards the Son to presage the bestowal of a special honor. The creative act of God moved to a new level, where 'nature' ((púaiç) is enfolded by the concept of 'image' (bíkcòv)63. The honor of being made in God's image (kcit' eÌKÓva), controls human potential and development, and defines in particular the scope of human freedom. Basil emphasizes: "(human) nature has within itself, in unwritten form, the spo- ken word of God, 'Have dominion' (as in Gen. 1.28)". Command over the passions is the most obvious example of that rational power: it is in the mastery of passion that human nature expresses itself most fully, collabo- rating with the creative power of God64. Likeness to God (Ó|íoícúcfiç) is in a similar way acquired by choice; but here Basil introduces another distinc- tion: humans have the power (ôóva|iiç) to acquire likeness, as part of their created nature, but they depend also on èvépyeia, their readiness to carry that power into effect. However, as Rousseau has well remarked, Basil already at an early point in On the Holy Spirit underscored that "there is no 61 Basil of Caesarea, Hexaemeron , 3.2 and 6.2. 62 Cf. Rousseau, Basil , pp. 339-342.

The power (ôóva^iç) to achieve likeness is thus a power exercised within the context of redemption, for it is a power of renewal (Sovajiiv . . . ávaicai- vcòaecD ç), bringing to our souls the great blessing of salvation (|¿eyáÁ/r|V ... Tīļv acoTTļpiav)66. When Basil speaks of "renewal", it is of course within the context of moral progress. Because, as Rousseau has accurately stated, the knowledge Basil values the most, is the enlightenment inspired by the Spirit's presence. The fundamental èvépyeia at work in human lives is that of the Spirit, enabling each person to "gain insight in the divine mysteries"67. Basil says that humankind is made in the image (eIkcov) of God, but can only become "like" God, achieve likeness (ôjioiœaiç) with God by enter- ing the community of the Church and adopting its moral program68. The notion of 8ÌKC0V defines a human being, but the concept of ójioícocnç defines Christianity as a social body. Imitation of Christ, the model of the Gospel, and his way of life will lead to redemption69. Heaven and Earth meet in Christ, but saints are the enlightened funda- ment of the Church community. Through moral and spiritual progress, they have achieved likeness with God, which turn them into models for our imi- tation of their good works. In holy images as a sign of divine likeness, not only the holy drama, but also saints are recognized through conceptual interaction of that which refers to the earthly and that which refers to the heavenly. To create a painting of the holy drama is to narrate the history of Christ mystically interspersed with the teachings of theology. In a patristic sense, the Greek word laxopia refers to knowledge, as well as narrative, fact of history, picture, and representation. To give impetus for the right kind of imitation, holy images indicate interaction between the figurative and concrete, and the more subtle teachings of theology. Flattened corpore- ality and inverted perspectives, use of colors, forms, and meta-images such as different kinds of light effects enhance the effect of a transfigured narra- tion intended for imitation. Not only God's twofold identification, but also Basil's identification of God, the double Person in the act of creation, together with his emphasis that the teachings of theology are mystically interspersed throughout history verify the need of interaction of human and divine in Byzantine aesthetics. Salvation depends on the interaction of 65 Basil of Caesarea, De Spiritu sancto , 1.2. 66 Basil of Caesarea, De Spiritu sancto , 12.28. 67 Basil of Caesarea, Homily , 353.1, On Psalm , 45, PG 29, 416B-C: "gćkjt£ ...

Belief in the Word tak- ing flesh concerns God's work of salvation, redemption and eternal life. The idea appears with Athanasius and Irenaeus of Lyon and is quoted by fathers of every age70. Yet, in the light of Basil, the creation act of the trinitarian God is already a matter of a twofold reality (voice/Father and word/Word/Son) in a triune one-God concept. Divine Knowledge - The Right Belief Moral integrity, deification (Gécoaiç), and salvation relate to spiritual knowledge of the supreme beauty of God. I find patristic support for my statement in Homily 17, On Psalm 44, where Basil identifies Christ as "ripe in beauty"71, by referring to David, who "calls the Lord ripe in beauty" when fixing his gaze on His divinity. With support of Isaiah, Basil under- scores that David does not celebrate the beauty of the flesh. "He (Christ) has no form nor comeliness; and we saw him, but he had no form nor beauty. But his form was ignoble, and inferior to that of the children of men" (oďk scttiv sîSoç a ďtco oòôè ôóí^a* Kai eïSojaev aôxóv, Kai ouk ef%sv eîSoç oôôè K&lt;xM,oę* 'AXXà xò eîôoç auxoß cmļuov, Kai èK^eîrcov 7iapà xoòç uíoòç tö)v àvOpcÒTicov)72. Basil concludes that it is evident that "the prophet (Isaiah), looking upon His brilliancy (X,a|i7cpóxr|Ti) and being filled with the splendor (|iap|iapi)yœv) there, his soul smitten with this beauty, was moved to a divine love of the spiritual beauty, and when this appeared in the human soul all things hitherto loved seemed shameful and abominable. Therefore, even Paul, when he saw His ripe beauty 'counted all things as dung that he might gain Christ73'"74. From Basil's discussion, we can infer that only the Lord is ripe in beauty, because Christ is the Word 70 See for example, Athanasius of Alexandria, De incarnatione , 54, ed. R. W.

Christ's existence identifies the supreme spiritual beauty, spo- ken of by Basil in terms of brilliance and splendor, because no darkness is in God75. In orthodox religious life, beauty concurs with each believer's cultivation of her/his potential of spiritual beauty. Eternal life and ascent to God relate to communication with God, to open up to the splendor of the soul through the right kind of knowledge. Beauty is that which leads to deification (Gécocnç), communication with God's is, becoming God. Based on Basil's choice of scriptural sources, his emphasis on the spir- itual beauty of Christ opposed to his disregard for the beauty of His flesh, I argue that in a patristic Byzantine aesthetical sense "ripe in beauty" has little or nothing to do with the corporeal beauty of the perfected created exposed to corruption. Beauty in a patristic sense concurs with features capable of spawning impetus to spiritual beauty and spiritual light, and not impetus to fascination of perfected genteel beauty, such as the carnal cor- poreality of Classical Greek Antiquity or the realism of Classical Roman portraiture. Either of these would have been ideologically incorrect and intolerable. To move the believer to divine love of spiritual beauty, Byzantine aes- thetics identifies a variety of flattened, compressed, and protracted corpo- real designs in communion with different kinds of light phenomena and brilliance, set in such perspectives that the heavenly is distinguished from the earthly without reducing the importance of the intelligible. The beauty, power, and supremacy of Christ or a saint's body are not physical, but spir- itual. The young athlete worked with the strength and vigor of his body, while the saint has opened up her/his mind to harmonize with God's actions, to regain what was lost at the fall. The specificity of Byzantine corporeality and narration, perspective, form, color combinations, and light effects serve the mind of the orthodox believer for spiritual contemplation beyond the visible. Focus on perfection in a worldly and mundane sense, would have concentrated upon the impermanence and transitoriness of everything cre- ated, and thus misguided the believer. I find support for my conclusion in the letter by Basil to his friend Gregory Nazianzen: The very beginning of the soul's purgation is tranquility (í|C7i)%ía), in which the tongue is not given to discussing the affairs of men, nor the eyes to con- templating rosy cheeks or comely bodies, nor the ears to lowering the tone of the soul by listening to songs whose sole object is to amuse, or to words spo- ken by wits and buffoons - a practice which above all things tends to relax the tone of the soul. For when the mind is not dissipated upon extraneous things, nor diffused over the world about us through the senses, it withdraws within itself, and of its own accord ascends to the contemplation of God. Then when 75 1 Jn. 1.5.</page><page sequence="27">BEAUTY IN THE EYES OF GOD 191 it is illuminated without and within by that glory, it becomes forgetful even of its own nature; no longer able to drag the soul down to thought of sustenance or to concern for the body's covering, but enjoying leisure from earthly cares, it transfers all its interest to the acquisition of the eternal goods76. Basil's letter is explicit when referring to the beauty of mundane carnal corporeality; neither rosy cheeks nor comely bodies will be of help for those who want to purify and reach the eternal goods. To illuminate the mind, humans need to forget human nature. Songs or words that can serve the eternal goods will help the believer to ascend to contemplation of God. What is good and beautiful relates to that which leads from the corruptible mundane to the eternal divine, that is upwards, from death to salvation, from the deteriorating body to the eternally resurrected body. Extraneous things and the world around us must not distract our attention or disrupt our spiritual tranquility. The cover of the body must not prevent the believer from reaching salvation. In light of such religious ideas, I argue, holy images identify insubstan- tial corporeality and ethereal tectonic bodies. What the believer beholds is a historical event interacting with the divine that is an event both within and beyond the temporal, between two events (8iaaxrļļLia), both within and beyond time and space. On the nature of heavens, Basil writes in his first homily On the Hexae- meron : Let us glorify the Master Craftsman for all that has been done wisely and skill- fully; and from the beauty of the visible things let us form an idea of Him who is more than beautiful (ĎrcépKaXov); and from the greatness of these percep- tible and circumscribed bodies let us conceive of Him who is infinite and immense and who surpasses all understanding in the plenitude of His power. For, even if we are ignorant of things made, yet, at least, that which in general comes under our observation is so wonderful that even the most acute mind is shown to be at loss as regards the least of the things in the world, either in the ability to explain it worthily (icax' àÇiav è7teÇsÀ,0eîv) or to render due praise to the Creator77. If Basil's thought is transferred into the context of Byzantine aesthetics, it is possible to conclude that beauty in this milieu concurs with aesthetics that serves the divine purpose. The image is beautiful if it renders due 76 Basil of Caesarea, Epistula , II (Deferrari, I, pp. 12-15). Cf. the same letter, when talk- ing on clothing for men, Basil states "let neither brilliancy of colour be sought, nor delicacy and softness of material; for seeking after bright colours in clothing is on a parity with wom- en's practice of beautifying themselves by tinting their cheeks and dyeing their hair with artificial luster" (Deferrari, I, pp. 20-21). 77 Basil of Caesarea, Hexaemeron , 1.11.</page><page sequence="28">1 92 ANNE KARAHAN praise to God and worthily explains the holy drama78. "Worthily" in an orthodox sense relates to divine knowledge explained in the right (Ôp0o5ó- manner with the right teaching about God (08oX,oyia). What makes the image orthodox and thus imperative is the right kind of visible beauty, the right kind of revelation of the holy drama. A painting or mosaic is holy because it follows the orthodox tradition. Compare the earlier quote from Basil and his discussion on Paul, who when seeing God's ripe beauty counted all the things that he had seen and experienced before as dung79. Neither Paul nor Basil advocates that the created is ugly, trivial, or negligi- ble. What Basil identifies as beauty (KáXkoq), however, is that which explains worthily and renders due praise to the Creator, whose beauty sur- passes all understanding. What is beautiful is that which lets us form an idea of the divine, which is more than beautiful. At the heart of Byzantine aesthetics lies this apophatic, paradoxical patristic model of explaining beauty80. Beauty is identified in divine knowledge, the Knowledge that leads to God. Charles Barber has pronounced that Greek theologians in the course of almost 180 years of debate have raised the status of the icon from a work of art to that of theology. He has highlighted the question of "the truthfulness of visual representation" and drawn the conclusion that "truth, rather than beauty, was the issue that would define the legitimacy or the illegitimacy of the Christian image, determining whether it should be thought of as an icon or an idol"81. I argue that by such a statement, Barber has not taken into consideration that in the Eastern Orthodox Church neither truth nor beauty is autonomous. Truth and beauty are in active communion, since faith stipu- lates that God is Beauty and God is Truth and vice versa. To hold the right belief, to be orthodox (ôpGoSo^éco) equates with the beauty of the divine wisdom, that which is identified within God's eternal, uncircumscribable, and incomprehensible is. From an orthodox viewpoint, beauty in an icon is that which is true to God, 'of right belief (ôpGóSo^oç). In Byzantine aes- thetics, beauty and true are thus as inseparable as human and divine. 78 On wisdom in words alone (XoyocKxpia), see Máximos the Confessor, Ambigua ad Ioannem , PG 91, 11 24 A. A recent publication on Máximos' doctrine of creation and the logoi of God instituting an ordered cosmos with humankind as the centre of the created world is T. T. Tollefsen, The Christocentric Cosmology of St Maximus the Confessor {Oxford Early Christian Studies ), Oxford, 2008. 79 Phil. 3.8. 80 The term a7iocpaxiKÓç means 'negative'. Apophatic theology applies to theological knowledge of God obtained by way of negation. The Divine is ineffable and human beings cannot define God. God is supra mundane, beyond words, categorization, and comprehen- sion, beyond time and space. Consequently, all descriptions of God are false. All that human beings can know about God is that God is. 81 C. BARBER, Figure and Likeness.

Basil views the economy of salvation from the Old Testament to the New, in terms of God gradually leading his people from darkness to light83. Yet, his chief purpose was to present a complete cosmology. His speculations and allusions to older theories on the origin, structure, and function of the visi- ble world are well explored in modern editions84. Of a greater importance, however, as rightly pointed out by Rousseau, is Basil's account of human- ity's place in that world, and of humanity's destiny. Basil's central theme in that account, most obviously indebted to both Plato and Origen "was that the genuine beauty and fascinating intricacy of creation found its meaning and fulfillment in a return to a world that was invisible and eternal"85. Each individual human being, Basil stated, is born with a potential for a cycle of return. In one of his Homilies on Psalms , he stresses God's providential inspiration ("the bread that comes down from heaven") that creates an "inner voice (voiļiov crcoļia toC evSov avGpcorcoi)), which pours forth unending praise in return"86. In light of Basil, we understand that genuine beauty relates to the incomprehensible Godhead, God's supra mundane is. In the context of Byzantine aesthetics, beauty refers to such aesthetic aspects and features that will help the believer communicate with and return to God. The beauty of a created material image lies in its potential to pro- duce and help the believer to divine knowledge and mental images of God's existence87. Beauty lies in an aesthetic approach that serves the right kind of communication between the believer and God. Features that might divert the believer's attention from God and the holy drama identify non-beauty. Beauty in created holy images is that which serves salvation and rebirth, that which paves the way for the journey from darkness (lack of knowl- edge) to light (divine knowledge). Beauty is that which nurtures spiritual advance towards God and return to human existence before the fall, when humankind was not autonomous. Beauty in an aesthetic sense lies in the right way of achieving visibility interacting with incomprehensibility, that is, in the right kind of communion between human and divine. A holy image, I argue, constitutes a conceptual apparatus that receives meaning 82 Rousseau, Basil , p. 321. 83 Hildebrand, Trinitarian Theology , pp. 174-175. 84 For references to the older theories, see the edition of the Homilies in Hexaemeron by S.

Holy persons in contact with their inner voices identify those who have developed their cycles of return. Their sense of divine knowledge provoked by examination of the external world has affected their realm of individual deification. Holy persons are beautiful because they identify knowledge of the right belief. Devices such as corporeal flatness, golden halos as well as gold penetrating their bodies and costumes, lack of spatial identification and corporeal credibility, just to mention a few artifices, associate them with the divine. Depicted beyond physical law and three-dimensional perspective, holy persons identify the beauty of spiritual splendor, readiness (evepyeia) and power (ôóva^iç) to acquire the beauty of divine knowledge through the right belief. The Purpose of the Created Visible Regarding the observable world, Basil emphasizes, "The Lord has placed within the smallest living creature the visible traces of his own great wisdom"88. The world is: a training place for rational souls ('|/i)%õ&gt;v Xoyiiccov) for attaining the knowl- edge of God, because through the visible and perceptible (Ôià tœv ôpcojxévcûv Kai aÌCT0T1T0v) objects it provides guidance to the mind for the contemplation of the invisible as the Apostle says: ' Since the creation of the world his invis- ible attributes are clearly seen . . . being understood through the things that are made89 (cm xà àóporua aòioo à nò KTÍaecoç KÓajiou to îç rcoif|ļiaai vooó- ļieva K(x0o paiai)'90. Basil's statement substantiates that it is not a question of worshipping matter. Knowledge of God can be attained through (8i&lt;x) the visible and perceptible. Within the created visible lies possible impetus for attaining divine knowledge and thus salvation. When John Damascene much later formulates his image theology, Basil's statement constitutes a leading theme - it is not a question of worshipping matter, since if destroyed, the image can even be thrown into the fire91. Holy images of Christ, the Theotokos, 88 Basil of Caesarea, Hexaemeron , 7. 5. 89 Rom. 1. 20. 90 Basil of Caesarea, Hexaemeron , 1.6. Basil's terminology is not precise regarding crápč, (flesh) and aœjaa (body), or regarding voõç (mind) and vļ/u^iļ (soul). In her great book on the cosmology and theology of Gregory Nazianzen, Richard underlines that neither did Gregory Nazianzen develop an established system for categorizing these phenomena. Richard, Cosmologie , p. 268. 91 Cf. John Damascene, Contra imaginum calumniatores , 11.19.</page><page sequence="31">BEAUTY IN THE EYES OF GOD 1 95 and the saints serve for contemplation of God. However, the objects upon which images of God and the saints are painted are not God. Basil, of course, did not refer to holy images in the religious life of the Church. Yet, his standpoint is clear. Perception with the senses (aiaGrixœç) through the mind will help the believer, who wants to attain knowledge of God. Inherent in visible and perceptible objects are God's invisible attrib- utes, such as power, uncircumscription, light, and indivisibility. To contem- plate the created material beyond its circumscribed materiality will lead the believer towards knowledge that God is. However, it can never lead to knowledge of what God is. Since neither human vision nor comprehension can fathom the entirety of God. In fact, any identification of God within human comprehension would suggest that God is circumscribed within the created exposed to corruption. Towards the end of his third homily On the Hexaemeron , Basil repeats his standpoint from his first homily by requesting his community to review the sermon: in order that from visible objects you may comprehend the invisible Being, and from the greatness and beauty of creatures (èie jisyéGouç Kai KaM,ovÍ1ç tcöv KTiaļiaicov) you may conceive the proper idea (rcpércoixrav ôóÇav) con- cerning our Creator. Tor since the creation of the world his invisible attributes are clearly seen - his everlasting power (àïÔtoç . . . ôúva|iiç) also and divini- ty'92. Therefore, in the earth, in the air, and in the heavens, in water, in night and in day, and in all things visible, clear reminders ((moļivfļļiaTa) of the Benefactor grip us93. As earlier recognized in Basil's sixth homily On the Hexaemeron , human vision is not enough. It is too small for perceiving the greatness of God. The created visible can remind the believer of God, not encompass the divine in its entirety. If we transfer this mode of thought into Byzantine aesthetics, I find support for an aesthetic approach that assists the believer in recognizing and comprehending the invisible attributes. In the context of holy images, however, it is a question of Christology (the God-Man) as well as cosmology (the universe as an ordered whole). A created holy image indicates the transfigured world and the incompre- hensible beauty of the Word. It concerns the economy of salvation as well as the grace of God in the holy drama. The beauty of a created holy image is what reminds the believer of God's invisible attributes, which relates to the orthodox fact that God is. Byzantine aesthetics imply this belief through "meta-images", a kind of non-categorizations, non-manifestations of that 92 Rom. 1.20. 93 Basil of Caesarea, Hexaemeron , 3.10.</page><page sequence="32">1 96 ANNE KARAHAN which is beyond human comprehension. I will come back to my notion of meta-image in the next paragraph. Imbibed with ethereal and apophatic attributes such as brilliance and different kinds of light effects, set in tram- pled perspectives, the portraits of Christ and the saints, as well as narration of the holy drama, remind the believer that God is both within and beyond human comprehension and visibility. In that way, the transfigured KÓa|ioç ('universe', 'order') of the image constitutes a locus for contemplation of God, who is both incomprehensible and comprehensible. The drama of the suffering in the flesh and the death on the cross of Christ (Passion) interact with divine grace to save humankind. In his first homily On the Hexaemeron Basil refers to "the creative skills", when talking of the action that has led to architecture, carpentry, metalwork, and weaving, and of many such arts. He underscores that even though the action ceases, the work remains. The artisan/the architect are not present, but the artistic process of thoughts can still be admired in the arti- san's work of art. Basil stresses that "the world is a work of art (ó KÓajaoç T8%viKÓv), set before all for contemplation, so that the wisdom of Him who created it should be known." Basil emphasizes how Moses used no other wording than "In the beginning He created ('E v ap%fļ eTioiiļaev)." He did not say, "He produced (èvfjpyriaev)," nor "He fashioned (ímécjTr|(T8v)," but "he created (ēTroirļcrev)"94. I compare Basil's verbal distinction with John Damascene's statement - "create an image of Christ" (Ttoiei Xpi- cftou to eÌKÓvi&lt;7|ia)95. Obviously, the Greek verb Ttoiéco, 'to create' is used to describe the actions of God's creation as well as the action of creating a holy image of Christ (and the holy drama)96. Utilization of the same verb indicates a certain analogy. The outcome of the former as well as of the latter is loci and phenomena intended for contemplation of God. The great difference is that the uncreated transcendent God creates 'out of nothing' (èi; oďk övtcöv), while the created artist creates out of matter created by God. The created artist organizes what was disturbed at the fall; that is out of chaos the artist re-creates a balanced divine cosmos. On the creation of the lights of the heavens, Basil writes: If, at any time in the clear cool air of the night, while gazing intently at the indescribable beauty of the stars, you conceived an idea (svvoia) of the Crea- tor of the universe - who He is who has dotted the heavens with such flowers, and why the usefulness is greater than the pleasure in visible things - or again, if at times you observed with sober reflection the wonders of the day and through visible things you inferred the invisible Creator97. 94 Basil of Caesarea, Hexaemeron , 1.7. y John Damascene, Contra i ma g i num calumniator es, 1.19. 96 The verb rcoiécû is also translated 'to make'. 97 Basil of Caesarea, Hexaemeron , 6. 1 . Cf. the significance of the star-studded pallium of the Byzantine emperor.</page><page sequence="33">BEAUTY IN THE EYES OF GOD 1 97 Basil's statement vindicates that the intelligible and visible is a divine gift. It serves to give an idea (ëvvoia) of God, who can only be known in terms of mental and spiritual perception or at the best in the experience of deification (0écoaiç). The vital importance of the created is found in its spiritual usefulness. The visibility of created matter should serve compre- hension of the incomprehensible invisibility of God's uncreated is. How- ever, the phenomenal universe pertains to the forces of nature and the prop- erties of bodies and bodily faculties. Thus, I argue that diversions and pastimes, which only mesmerize, intrigue, and affect in a transient, tempo- ral, and earthly sense are of little significance for Byzantine aesthetics. The gist of beauty in an orthodox sense is an experience of the divine through and beyond the created visible. The believer should not contemplate the created material itself, but whom He is who has created the beauty of the created cosmos. It is significant that Basil exemplifies with the indescriba- ble beauty of the stars, since light and brilliance constitute the principal metaphor for God, not only in the thought of Basil, but of many fathers98. Given that God's is is considered to be invisible, what better meta-image could there be than the meta-image of the insubstantiality of ethereal light. In addition, it is by way of the created light that we perceive the created. The path towards the Light goes through the light. In his sixth homily On the Hexaemeron , Basil asks rhetorically: if visible things are so beautiful, what will be the invisible? If the grandeur of the heavens transcends the measure of the human intellect, what mind will be able to explore the nature of the everlasting? If the sun, subject to destruction (cpGopã), is so beautiful (kcxA-òç), so great, so swift in its motion, presenting such orderly cycles (rcspióôoDç), possessing a magnitude so commensurate with the universe that it does not exceed its due proportions to the universe; if by the beauty of its nature it is as conspicuous in creation as a radiant eye; if the contemplation of it is incapable of satisfying us, what will be the beauty of the Sun of justice? If it is a loss to a blind man to be unable to look upon this, how great a loss is it to a sinner to be deprived of the true Light (&lt;xA/r|0ivoi) cpcoxòç)99? Contemplation of the created should be performed in such a way that the believer reaches experience of the true Light. I argue that to help the believer, Byzantine aesthetics identify communion between created visibil- ity and spiritual invisibility, in line with the twofold identification of God. Albeit, Christ is recognized as generated, not created. The snag is, however, that the nature of the eternal divine is believed not only to transcend dete- rioration, but also human comprehension. In order not to trespass, either the 98 Cf. for example Gregory Nazianzen, who speaks of created light as symbol of God who is only light of heavenly sphere, Oratio , 44.3, PG 36, 609C. 99 Basil of Caesarea, Hexaemeron , 6.1.</page><page sequence="34">1 98 ANNE KARAHAN belief in the incomprehensible divine, or the belief in the God-Man, sub- lime meta-images, a kind of non-images interact with narration of the holy drama and portraits of saints. The result is an interaction of apophatic and cataphatic theology that teaches about God, who is both beyond and within comprehension100. We know that Basil did not refer to created material images; yet, as already observed, his theological language and eulogizing of the created visible concur with the later incontestable role of holy images in Byzantine religious life. For a fact, Basil insists that contemplation of the created vis- ible will render the attentive beholder a sense of God, because human beings are born with a potential to reach an idea of God through the visible. I refer to a paragraph on the creation of the firmament, in his third homily On the Hexaemeron , where Basil discusses what is beautiful in the eyes of God through a parallel of the beauty of relationship within a statue. God in creation, but also the artist is aware of the final aim of the diverse processes of creation: 'And God saw that it was good'101. It is not to the eyes of God that things made by Him afford pleasure, nor is His approbation of beautiful objects such as it is with us; but, beauty is that which is brought to perfection according to the principle of art and which contributes to the usefulness of its end (icaÀ,òv TO TÛ) A,0ycp TT1Ç T8XVÎ1Ç £KT8À,£C70év, Kal TCpÒÇ TTļV TOU TsXoVÇ 8ĎXpT|C7TÍaV av)VT£ivov). He, therefore, who proposed to Himself a clear aim (ctkokov) for His works, having recourse to His own artistic principles, approved them indi- vidually as fulfilling His aim. In fact, a hand by itself or an eye alone or any of the members of a statue, lying about separately, would not appear beautiful to one chancing upon them; but, set in their proper place, they exhibit beauty of relationship, scarcely evident formerly, but now easily recognized by the uncultured man. Yet, the artist, even before the combination of the parts knows the beauty of each and approves them individually, directing his judgment to the final aim. God is described on the present occasion as such an artistic Commander of each of His works, but He will render becoming praise also to the whole completed world102. 100 Cataphatic theology (KaxacpaTiKÓç, 'affirmative') refers to the positive sayings about God's actions, each acknowledged as a divine manifestation (0eo(p&lt;xveia) of God in creation. The opposite, apophatic theology is a theology of negation that speaks of God in terms of negative paradoxes. I denominate them "non-identifications"; God is uncircumscribed and incomprehensible, beyond words, categorizations, and human comprehension. 101 Gen. 1.8. 102 Basil of Caesarea, Hexaemeron , 3.10.

Cf. also Richard, Cosmologie , pp. 35-36, who points to how beauty in Gregory Nazianzen refers to admiration of the perfection of the universe, which can guide humankind towards God. The greatness of the world is a divine sign, a silent proclamation of God's greatness and</page><page sequence="35">BEAUTY IN THE EYES OF GOD 1 99 From Basil's mode of thought, we can conclude that the purpose of the visible is to be beautiful in the eyes of God. Beautiful is that which pro- vides orderly motion towards God, "which contributes to the usefulness of its end". Beautiful is that which serves the divine good. Beautiful in the eyes of God is not what deceives the human eye, but what serves the salva- tion of humankind103. In an orthodox sense, the economy of salvation proceeds from God and encompasses all God's actions from the creation to the salvation in Christ; the economy defines God's actions and gifts to humankind104. The works of God in the Creation are beautiful because they relate to God; they give a foretaste of the eternal existence to come, if contemplated in the right man- ner. Likewise, I argue that the idea of beauty and good in a created Byzan- tine holy image relate to its potential to give a foretaste of God. Beauty and good relate to aesthetic approaches that can exhibit the beauty of relation- ship between the created and the incomprehensible uncreated. The idea of beauty with reference to created form, color, light, and space relates to its latent capacity to give impetus for contemplation of the Beauty of God's uncreated supra-mundane invisibility. The purpose of a created holy image relates to the Beauty of God and that which is beautiful in the eyes of God. The former identifies in the grace of God and the Passion, the twofold iden- tification of the God-Man that grants salvation to every believer. The latter identifies in that which leads humankind back to life in God. To serve its purpose, Byzantine aesthetics has to reveal the incomprehensible as well as the comprehensible, since that is the dogmatic foundation of the belief in the salvation of humankind. To vindicate my hypothesis, I will devote the next two paragraphs to a discussion on the crucial role of patterned borders, light and brilliance for semantic indication of divine uncircumscription and the created world as a scene of divine activity. magnificent quality ( Oratio , 6.14, in SC , 405, ed.

He emphasizes that Christian believers should be engrafted by faith in the tradition of the Church, as one single vine with "desires always heavenward", to "reach the upmost heights of the loftiest teachings" and to "imitate the eternal verdure" of the vine and emulate its fruitfulness106. The vine intelligently observed by eyes is enough to remind us of our nature: the parable of the Lord, when He proclaims Himself the vine and His Father the vine-dresser, and calls each one of us, engrafted by faith on the Church, the branches107 ... He (the Lord) constantly compares the souls of men to vines. 'My beloved had a vineyard' He says, 'on a hill in a fruitful place'108. And, 'I planted a vineyard, and put a hedge about it'109. Evidently, He calls the human souls the vineyard, about which He has put as a hedge the security aris- ing from His commandments and the custody of His angels. 'The angel of the Lord shall encamp round about them that fear Him'110. And then He drove in props, as it were, for us, 'placing in the Church, first apostles, secondly proph- ets, thirdly teachers'111. And leading our thoughts upward by the examples of the blessed men of old ... He wishes us also to cling to our neighbors with embraces of charity like tendrils of vine, and to rest upon them, so that, keep- ing our desires always heavenward, we may, like certain climbing vines, reach the upmost heights of the loftiest teachings'112. I argue that the vine as a metaphor for God, the faithful, and the Chris- tian oikoumene , the world as the scene of Christ's activity and of the cele- bration of the Christian sacraments had an immense impact on Byzantine aesthetics and the picture programs of the churches. Yet, when we study the image programs of the churches, we might not even recognize the idea of the trailing plant that supports and assists the believer to climb heavenward. In their anthropomorphous visibility and comprehensibility, the most obvi- ous protagonists are instead Christ, the Theotokos, and the saints. In spite of the less obvious role in Byzantine picture programs, the image of the vine modified and turned into borders and stylized patterns, plays no subordinate theological role. Spirally coiling tendrils in the shape of borders of leaves, flowers, and fruits as well as the borders of geometric designs, or 105 Basil of Caesarea, Hexaemeron , 4.7. 106 Basil of Caesarea, Hexaemeron , 5.6. 107 Cf.

These borders do not frame the motifs within closed forms, since that would have identified the divine drama within space and time and categorized God within the laws of circumscrip- tion. They identify the hedge of security arising from God's command- ments and the custody of God's angels. Like subtle indications, they attach the comprehensible to the incomprehensible, the visible to the divine. They climb the walls and the cupolas, encircle the tondi, and unite the motifs of the holy drama113. They identify the idea of the potential for each believer to reach the uncircumscribed divine and the paradise to come. The identi- fication of the divine is as it should be in line with its incomprehensibility and uncircumscription, less patent, impossible to fathom in its entirety. Sig- nificative examples are in the Early Byzantine church of San Vitale (mosaics) in Ravenna, Italy, as well as in the Middle Byzantine Tokali kilise and the three so-called column churches Elmali kilise, Karanlik kilise, and Çankli kilise (mural paintings), all four in Cappadocia, as well as in the Late Byzantine Chora church (mosaics and mural paintings), in Istanbul, Turkey. (Figure 5) Another great example is the reconstructed apse of the church of San Michele in Africisco (ca. 545-546), executed in mosaics, formerly in Ravenna, now in the Museum für Byzantinische Kunst (Inv. no. 6642), Bode Museum, Berlin114. (Figure 6) In the apse, flanked by the archangels Michael and Gabriel a youthful Christ stands vigorously in front of a golden setting in the garden of Paradise. The book in the hands of Christ shows a passage of the Latin text: "He who has seen me has seen the Father115" and "I and the Father are one116". Apart from the obvious that this is an image of God incarnated, we also have a meta-image of the triune God, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. In an apophatic sense, the Trinity is signified through interaction of golden brilliance and the two names. For support of my hypothesis, I refer for example to Dionysius the Areopagite, who speaks of light (cpœç) as one of many names given by humankind to God, who is nameless117. 113 Tondo , 'circular painting', 'sculptured medallion'. 114 A watercolor by Enrico Pazzi of 1842-1843, in the Bode Museum, shows the mosaic still in situ.

Karahan</page><page sequence="39">BEAUTY IN THE EYES OF GOD 203 The apex of the arch is devoted to the Lamb of God, encircled by an aureole colored in white, blue, and red. The intrados is devoted to a gold and green colored foliate border in the shape of a chain of ovals, an indica- tion of the uncircumscribed one-God concept and the faithful. The border coils spirally like an ornamented verdant tendril on a blue colored back- drop, the blue signifying the Heavens. On both sides appear in each oval (originally) six fluttering white doves (today only five), symbols of the apostles, who have reached the loftiest teachings and thus are fundamental branches in the vineyard of saved human souls. "La vigne est l'image de l'âme", as the French translation stipulates118. The Lamb of God in the apex, and the apostles below encircled by verdure that glimmers of gold emphasize the tendrils of vine, the faithful, who will experience salvation through the passion of Christ. At the point where the coiling foliage merges to give rise to a new oval, from each side is intersected a white colored (divine) fleur-de-lis (the Trinity) with a circle (uncircumscribed eternity) colored in red (the Cross Death) on top of the middle leaf. If contemplated beyond the patently visible, the border identifies the divine mystery and the grace of God through different kinds of paradoxes. The notion I use for such artistic devices is "meta-image", a kind of apophaticism that is non-identification/non-categorization of the divine. Because the divine is not in the visibility itself of the borders of foliage, flowers, and fruits or geometric abstractions, neither in colors, brilliance, gold, or precious stones. The meta-image is a form of inter-imagery revelation/ implication of the incomprehensible divine. The meta-image acts in com- munion with narration, props, and holy persons. To use a patristic mode of thought, I refer to John Damascene's statement that "God does not show forth His nature but the things that relate to His nature" (xa 7ispi xfļv cpóaiv)119. If contemplated beyond its visibility, the meta-image stimulates divine impetus. The potential lies in the characteristics of the meta-image, if contemplated it will help the believer to conjure up internal visions of the uncircumscribed, supra mundane divine. Another kind of borders, with similar theological connotations are those devoted to portraits of saints and angels inscribed in tondi, linked together to signify continuums of divine growth and existence. For pictorial exam- ples, I refer to the image programs of the Monastery church of St. Catherine in Sinai, Egypt, the church of San Vitale in Ravenna, and the two Cappado- cian churches, Haçli kilise, at Giillii Dere and El Nazar kilise, at Göreme. (Figure 7) 118 French tr. by Giet, p. 305. 1 19 John Damascene, Expositio fide i , 1 .4.</page><page sequence="40">204 ANNE KARAHAN Fig. 7. The Ascension. El Nazar kilise (Göreme 1). Photo A. Karahan In a theoretical sense, patterned borders indicate eternal uncircumscrip- tion, because they have neither closed figurative nor non-figurative form. As such, I argue they signify divine presence, action, and growth. In a united apophatic and cataphatic sense, patterned borders in communion with por- traits of saints and narration of the holy drama are orthodox semantics for belief in the God-Man. Interaction of the divine continuum, implied through subtle and ethereal meta-images, such as borders, light, gold, and brilliance and the more proper physical visibility of portraits and narration identify theological didactics on the ļii)axf|piov, the revelation of divine operation and divine presence, the secret revealed by God. The believer who carefully contemplates the holy image will experience a divine manifestation of God's creation and presence in the image of God and the holy drama. Gems, Gold, Silver, and Pearls The gem-border is another established signum of Byzantine aesthetics, obvious not only to those who methodically explore the Byzantine world of holy images, but also to any amateur in the history of Byzantine art. (Figure 5) Gem-borders are depicted as part of the pictorial programs on walls and vaults, in apses and on props such as thrones, footstools,</page><page sequence="41">BEAUTY IN THE EYES OF GOD 205 cushions, baptismal fonts, and garments. Moreover, as we can observe in the church of San Vitale, Ravenna, they are also presented in the form of marble revetments patterned to imitate gem-borders. Gems appear also on such motifs as the three-armed cross-nimbus and the crux gemmata , as well on other cross motifs. I argue that in their capacity as identifications of the uncircumscribed and incomprehensible divine, gem-borders as part of the holy drama emphasize the twofold identification of God and the communion of human and divine in the holy drama. Thus, connecting and uniting the visibility and comprehensibility of the holy drama to the invis- ibility and incomprehensibility of God's triune is. I argue that not only gems, but also silver, gold, and white pearls are meta-images that signify not only the divinity and the divine power of the God-Man, but also the nameless, incomprehensible, and supra-mundane tri- une God. Since orthodox theology identifies the image of God, Jesus Christ as Light from Light (cpœç èie cpcoTÓç), and Basil speaks of Christ in terms of the true light (cpœç tò à^r|0ivóv)120, light and brilliance in the context of holy images indicate the idea that the three persons of God are uncircum- scribed and 'of the same substance' (ônooóaioç). The image of the invis- ible God and the supra-mundane Trinity is a one-God concept upon which orthodox tradition is built. I argue that light and brilliance were ethereal enough not to be taken for a materialization or categorization of God who is beyond circumscription and human comprehension. The abounding use of gems, silver, gold, and pearls is not due to the pecuniary value of such materials, but to their capacity of instigating light and brilliance, which as we know is the most common metaphor for God and the divine. In support of my hypothesis, I refer to Basil's Homily 7, 1-7, where he emphasizes the transitoriness of worldly belongings and the futil- ity of craving for precious stones. Basil enumerates emerald, hyacinth, chrysolite, beryl, achate, amethyst, and jaspis, as well as silver, gold, and pearls, and categorizes them as stone ( XiQoq ). He refers to gold and silver as soil/dust (xouv) and distinguishes them from the true brightness of the kingdom of heaven. The beauty of the created is nil in comparison to the true beauty of the uncreated. What Basil discusses in his homily is the futil- ity of striving for earthly belongings. Yet, taken into an aesthetic context of religious didactics, the beauty of worldly riches serves for contemplation of the Beauty of God the Light. Compare how Basil in On the Holy Spirit quotes the Scriptures: "The first man was from the earth, a man of dust; the second man is from heaven"121. In one of his letters, he also stresses: 120 Basil of Caesarea, De Spiritu sancto , 47. 121 Ibidem.</page><page sequence="42">206 ANNE KARAHAN the Son was light from light ((pœç ¿K (ponóç), and was born, though not cre- ated, from the substance of the Father (¿K tî1ç oòaía ç tou IïaTpôç), they then brought in also the doctrine of "likeness of substance," (ô|xooóaiov) thus intimating that whatever idea of light is attributed to the Father, this will equally apply to the Son also. For true light in relation to true light, by the very conception we have of light, will have no variation122. The theological language of Basil confirms the vital impact of light and brilliance in Byzantine aesthetics. Features such as light and brilliance not only instruct and edify that the protagonist is God, the true Light, but also identify that God is present here and now. The believer who contemplates the effects of light and brilliance in a holy image will be given knowledge of the spiritual beauty of God thereby become illumined. Although Basil does not refer to meta-images such as brilliance and light, I find support for my hypothesis in Basil's treatise On the Holy Spirit : If we are illumined by divine power, and fix our eyes on the beauty of the image of the invisible God, and through the image are led up to the indescrib- able beauty of its source, it is because we have been inseparably joined to the Spirit of knowledge123. I also refer to Athanasius of Alexandria, who emphasizes that the divine light manifested in the theophanies in spiritual life, is help given by the Word to those who pray124. The mode of thought of both Athanasios and Basil recognize some kind of didactic analogy between God/the Word and the metaphor of light, in spite of its self-evident insufficiency to encompass God. Likewise, meta-images such as gold, silver, pearls, and gems, light and brilliance are insufficient; however, they are tools that the believer can use for approaching God. Inserted into the narration of the holy drama and the portraits of saints, they help those who pray to reach spiritual knowl- edge of the source of the indescribable beauty. Interaction of narration and meta-images indicates that the incomprehensible and uncircumscribed divine coexists and interacts with God's humanity. This communion of divine and human constitutes the core element in salvation of humankind. Significative pictorial examples are the borders of saints, in the intrados of El Nazar kilise (Göreme 1) and the church of San Vitale, as well as on the barrel vault of the Old Tokali kilise (Göreme 7)125. Portraits of saints (lives 122 Basil of Caesarea, Epistula , LII (Letter to the Canonicae) (Deferrari, I, pp. 330-333). 123 Basil of Caesarea, De Spiritu sancto , 47. 124 Cf.

The communion of the cir- cular form of the tondi, its blue colored background, and the saints' anthro- pomorphic portraits signify the saints as human links between Heaven and Earth. Created in the image of God, humankind is even closer to God than angels are126. When God created the human being, God aggregated in one and the same being the separate elements of visible and invisible, temporal and immortal, terrestrial and celestial127. Saints of which the Theotokos is the highest representative have knowledge of this twofold reality. Solely the God-Man, however, is uncreated, truly God and truly human, as stipu- lated at the Council of Chalcedon 451. Concluding Remarks I argue that to merit the epithet "holy", religious images in Byzantium had to identify God not only as anthropomorphous, but also as divine, incomprehensible, uncircumscribed, and eternal. Disregard of God's divin- ity would have been to recognize the non-orthodox idea that Christ is not fully God, as did for example the "heretic" Arians. To leave out either the human or the divine nature of God would be to imply that God is divisible that is introduce an idea of polytheism. My statement might strike anyone acquainted with patristicism as utterly ignorant and absurd, since, the immaterial divine is recognized as uncircumscribed and incomprehensible, beyond categorization and visualization. Nowhere in patristicism or in the Scriptures is any kind of materialization of God's divinity verified or accepted. However, there are myriads of patristic writings on the subject, because the essence of Trinitarian theology, Christology, and soteriology is belief in God as divine. It is a one-God concept, where salvation of human- kind is entirely dependent on divine interaction in the created world. God taking flesh is prerequisite for the salvation of humankind. Salvation is granted through God's twofold identification residing in the interaction of divine grace and suffering flesh. Annunciation and Incarnation (divine and human), Passion (human) and Salvation (divine) are in conceptual causality. God is always divine, identified in the Trinity or in the anthropomorphic 126 Cf. Gregory Nazianzen, Oratio , 38.9, in SC , 358, ed. C. Moreschini and trad. P. Gallay, Paris, 1990, p. 120. 127 Cf. how Gregory Nazianzen, Oratio , 2.75, ed. J. Bernardi, in SC , 247, Paris, 1978, p. 188, comments upon God's creation of visible versus invisible; when God created the human being dust (/oCv) was mixed with the soul (Trvsūļia) to a being both visible and invisible.</page><page sequence="44">208 ANNE KARAHAN image of the invisible God. Consequently, out of ideological necessity a holy image must answer to patristic definitions on Trinitarian theology, Christology, and soteriology. If the image falls short of corroborating 'right opinion', 'sound doctrine' (òpGoôo^ía), contemplation and imitation of the image will fail to produce the desired effect of resurrection and salvation. As discussed above, Basil's text On the Holy Spirit maintains that cau- sality prevails between dogma and the public proclamation (Kf|pi)y|ia). Although Basil does not refer to holy images, I emphasize that his state- ment confirms that Byzantine aesthetics is not an autonomous issue. To respond to orthodox perception by means of the senses (aia0r|TiK(£&gt;ç) it had to concur with 'orthodox', 'right belief (ôpGóSoÇoç). The right kind of mimesis requires the right kind of identifications of axiomatic orthodox postulates. Sense of form, combination of shapes and colors, narration and holy persons have to answer to what is beautiful in the eyes of God. Thus, in the context of Byzantine aesthetics beauty refers to aesthetic approaches that help believers contemplate God, who is visible and comprehensible as well as nameless and incomprehensible. From a Byzantine religious per- spective, beauty does not refer to the perishable, but to the imperishable, not to physical strength and vigor, but to spiritual strength, yearning, endur- ance, and purity. Beauty refers to actions that lead to communion with God. Beauty indicates command of and harmony with the will of God. Beauty relates to a believer's restoration of the natural image, a return to God. It identifies in the interface of potential and action. Beauty concerns deification (Gecoaiç), communion with God. Enlightenment and knowledge versus ignorance distinguish life from death. Divine knowledge is beauty, whereas lack of divine knowledge is absence of beauty. A holy image of Christ is a tool for contemplation in an 'orthodox man- ner', 'with right belief' (ôpGoôó^coç). Moreover, it is a visible proof of God's incarnation, according to Orthodox tradition as advocated by John Damascene. To deny and rebuff images of God's humanity is to nullify not only the incarnation, but also the salvation of humankind. Yet, the triune God and the image of the invisible God is a one-God concept. Coexistence and interaction of human and divine in God constitute an orthodox axiom. I argue that this axiom also demands extraordinary religious tools when transferred into the didactics of holy images. However, the peril of ending up in heresy is imminent. Therefore, the didactics has to be in line with how Orthodox tradition conceives of God. For an improved, more accu- rate, understanding of Byzantine aesthetics and the dilemma of didactics on God's twofold identification, we need to consider the vital impact of apophatic theology in the Orthodox tradition. Non-identifications and non- categorizations, that is knowledge of God by way of negation (aTtocpaTiKÓç),</page><page sequence="45">BEAUTY IN THE EYES OF GOD 209 are vital in the modes of thought of many fathers, but especially the three Cappadocian fathers, and Dionysios the Areopagite, Máximos the Confes- sor, and John Damascene. Comprehension of God's transcendent supra mundane divinity is said to be unattainable for human beings. Yet, lengthy discussions by the Cappadocians verify that comprehension of the incom- prehensibility of God is indispensable for the believer who wants to attain the right kind of knowledge of God. It is the impact of such apophatic thinking that both enabled apophatic indications of the divine and paved the way for the specificity of Byzantine aesthetics. In analogy with non- identifications, non-definitions, and non-categorizations of God's divinity in apophatic theology, Byzantine aesthetics used paradoxes and non-iden- tifications to teach about God's incomprehensible uncircumscription. In line with the Scriptures and patristicism, light and brilliance produce signs (crrļueīa) for recognizing the belief in the reality of the supra mundane existence of God, God's is. Light and brilliance in holy images signify the uncreated Light and not the created lights of the sun, the moon, and the stars128. Such apophatic non-identifications help to meta-represent the supra mundane incomprehensible divine. My notion for such kind of apo- phatic, didactic indications of the divine is meta-image, a kind of non- identification or non-categorization. Brilliance and light, gold, silver, gems, pearls and white color, but also circles and patterned borders non-identify, or non-manifest the incompre- hensible uncircumscription of the true Light, in a similar manner that apo- phatic theology non-defines and non-categorizes the divine beyond words, affirmations, and circumscription. A meta-image provides impetus for con- templation of the true Light, God's is. It is a non-representation of divine interaction in the holy drama. Narration of the holy drama set in communion with meta-images and different inverted, compressed perspectives, flattened and balanced corporeality, and sometimes even hovering bodies verifies the interaction of human comprehensibility and divine incomprehensibility in the holy drama. The historical event of the God-Man is identified as an event with connotations beyond time and space, a divine reality where divine and physical laws coexist and interact. Potential resurrection and salvation prevail in the interface of human and divine, in God's twofold identification. 128 Cf. Basil of Caesarea, Hexaemeron , 6.4, On the Creation of the Lights of Heaven, the sun, the stars, and the moon. Basil declares, the Lord has foretold that the signs of the dis- solution of the universe will appear in the sun, the moon, and the stars. "The sun shall be turned into blood, and the moon will not give her light" (Cf. Joel 2.31, and Mt. 24.29). From this we can conclude that everything created is exposed to corruption, only the uncreated Light of God is eternal.</page><page sequence="46">210 ANNE KARAHAN In the first chapter of his Great Catechetical Oration , Gregory of Nyssa stresses that the word of God differs from the word of humans. He stresses that "human nature is corruptible and weak, therefore its life is transient, its power unreal, and its reason (or word) unstable." Such limitations are extraneous to the "transcendent substance" that is God, since "just as our nature is perishable and has a perishable word (or reason), so that nature which is incorruptible and abides eternally has an eternal and subsisting word"129. God created human nature and God took flesh. From this belief, we understand that human nature does not relate to something vile or revolt- ing. Yet, human nature and human word are exposed to deterioration and that quality is no model for imitation. Models for imitation are the God- Man and those who through purification of their souls have restored their image of God and returned to the natural beauty. Saints in communion with God's invisible is, are inextricably linked to the imperishable Word. A saint is a spirit-bearing soul illumined by God, and as such, the saint can illumine the believer who contemplates and imitates her/him. The actions of the saints are divine knowledge that helps the believer reach deification (0éco- cnç). Gregory Nazianzen refers to a splendor in the soul (èrcicpáveia) that appears to the believer who imitates the saints130. Whereas Basil, as quoted above, calls attention to that "the lives of saintly men" are "living images" of God's government, and should serve "for our imitation of their good works"131. Saints are models because their choices and actions lead back to God. Byzantine aesthetics recognizes didactically the beauty of the non-deteri- orating divine through meta-images. Brilliance, gold, silver, gems, pearls, borders, circles, and radiant light dazzling through perforated walls, domes, and tripartite windows are apophatic tools that help the believer contem- plate God's divine presence. At celebration of the liturgy, the tectonic body of the church and its architectonic interior of spatial immateriality interact with narration, portraits of the saints, and meta-images. Spiritualized carna- tion, flattened corporeality, inverted perspectives, and flickering candlelight add to recognition of the beauty of spiritual knowledge. The lack of close adherence to and faithful representation of nature or human reality provoke a sense of the operation taking place within, as well as beyond, time and space, within natural, as well as beyond, supra mundane laws. In support, I refer to Basil's discussion in his text On the Holy Spirit : The Spirit does not take up His abode in someone's life through a physical approach; how could a corporeal being approach the Bodiless one? Instead, 129 Gregory of Nyssa, Oratio Catechetica , p. 9, 11. 1-3 and 8-11. 130 Gregory Nazianzen, Oratio , 7.14, in SC , 405, p. 214.

Only when a man has been cleansed from the shame of his evil (o àv8|iá^axo ôià xfjç KaKÍaç), and has returned to his natural beauty ((púaecoç KáXXoq), and the original form (àpxaíav |iopcpfļv) of the Royal Image has been restored in him, is it possible for him to approach the Paraclete (the Holy Spirit as advocate or counselor). Then, like the sun, He will show you in Himself the image of the invisible (xfļv eíkóvcx toõ dopáiou), and with purified eyes you will see in this blessed image the unspeakable beauty of its prototype (apxsxwcoi) KáXXoç). When a sunbeam falls on a transparent substance, the substance itself becomes brilliant, and radiates light from itself. So too Spirit-bearing souls, illumined by Him, finally become spiritual themselves, and their grace is sent forth to others. From this comes knowledge of the future, understanding of mysteries, apprehension of hidden things, distribution of wonderful gifts, heavenly citizenship, a place in the choir of angels, endless joy in the presence of God, becoming like God, and the highest of all desires, becoming God132. The beauty of the soul consists of it being created in the image of God, and in the symmetry of its virtues133. Beauty refers to the restored image of God in the believer. The unspeakable beauty of the invisible God shows forth like the sun in the illumined believer who experiences deification. Beauty in an orthodox sense reflects divine order, light, and uncircumscrip- tion, not chaos, spiritual darkness, and corruptible anthropomorphous per- fection. Swedish Research Institute in Istanbul Riksbankens Jubileumsfond, Stockholm Anne Kar ah an anne.karahan@gmail.com Summary The quintessence of Byzantine faith is the twofold identification of the God- Man. Yet, the image of God Jesus Christ and the transcendent Trinity is a one-God concept. Inevitability, I argue Byzantine aesthetics had to recognize God as both anthropomorphous and divine. Since, omission of God's divinity would verify God as divisible. In line with apophatic theology, Byzantine aesthetics used non-catego- rizations and non-identifications, what I denominate meta-images, to teach about God's divinity and that God is. Since "holy" equals right (ôpOoSóÇcoç) manner and right teaching about God (0eota&gt;yia), anything else would have been heresy. The desired effect of salvation would come to naught if the image did not concur with ' right opinion' (òp0o8oÇía). Contemplation and imitation as well as communion with God depend on aesthetics 'of right belief' (ôp0ó8oÇoç).

In context of aesthetics, the idea of beauty refers to potential impetus to restore the natural image in the believer. Beauty identifies in deification (0écoaiç), spiritual knowledge of the supreme beauty of God. Beauty does not refer to the perishable, but to the imperishable, not to physical strength and vigor, but to spiritual strength, yearning, and purity. Aesthetic approaches that help believers go beyond physical law to divine law, beyond the corporeal mundane to spiritual knowledge are good and beautiful. Interaction of narration, flattened cor- poreality, inverted perspectives, and meta-images such as light, brilliance, and pat- terned borders identifies the twofold reality of God and the historical event within and beyond time and space. This interaction of Incarnation (human visibility/suffering in the flesh) and Grace (divine incomprehensibility) refers to the Beauty of God, the prerequisite for salvation of humankind.</page></plain_text>
