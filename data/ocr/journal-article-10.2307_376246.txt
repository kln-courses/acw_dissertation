(I'm not sure it was a good idea to give you permission to "try your hand at something like 'mystical free verse.'" Your quaint anthropomorphic religious hang-ups are none of my business, I suppose. But however mystical, what you've got here is neither free nor verse. And the style of what you've got is my business.) By the numbers: Q Organization and unity: Having opted for shepherd in your crucial opening sentence, it/he obliges you to some consistency. Pastures and waters, O.K. (but see comment 2 , below). But in your whole third paragraph, onlv path (of "righteousness" vet! See 2 ) sustains a mere vestige of the initial metaphor. All of the other substantives in the paragraph are vague and too heady for any intelligent reader's conception of the sheep-hood that you've imputed to the persona. True, you revert to potential pastoral (look it up) with the rod and staff of the next paragraph. But then comes the wild restaurant scene of paragraph 5! And even if you expect the reader to think of Goodness and Mercy as two solicitous sheep dogs (?), the concluding paragraph is weak. ()Diction: (Please re-read my handout on "action-verbs and hard nouns" and scan the words that I marked with a 2 in your essay. You'll notice I didn't quibble with your atavistic tense markers. The unctious scent of religiosity that they emit is all of a piece with the genre itself. (Don't please submit that sort of thing to the Hopwood people!) To comment on just a few of the numbered items: still wwaters: Even if you insist on the plural, consider the vividness that you might have gained by specifying those "waters" and their "still"-ness. Cf. dank tarns, hushed pools, languid lakes, gurgling creeks, etc.-(you get the idea). restoreth . . . soul: Ah, dear David. There are more problems in this pair of words and its whole paragraph than I have time to solve for you. Read Aristotle, Skinner; then consult Dr. Schmerd in Counselling. Meanwhile, ask yourself: Isn't there any more vivid term for whatever you may be groping for here? Or think: how would any writer in our anthology get the vibrations of his very voice into the sentiment? Keeping your shepherd-sheep metaphor in mind, does this get closer? He strokes static sparks into the wool of my self-concept; he chucks me from across the bridges of shared features because that's where he's at. the valley of the shadow of death . . . evil: There is a fetching rhythm here- probably enforced by the relief that comes with reading the very first com-</page><page sequence="3">418 COLLEGE ENGLISH plex sentence in the piece! But I do hope that after the great books course (Shakespeare to Brautigan) you'll come by a better nose for figurative lan- guage. You have your reader swimming in a sea of troubles by the time he's tried to visualize a shadow with a valley, so that by the time he reaches such medieval abstractions as death and evil he's too out on a limb to take up arms. presence of . . . enemies: Again (ignoring the devastating effect of the whole paragraph) you blew the chance to engage your reader in his whole feelingful person. Surely anybody's enemies, if they're worth bringing up, deserve some description. And why not convey the supposed dread of being, sigh, in their "presence?" Are they glaring at you-from a far corner? from across the table? Are they grunting, cursing? Let's see and hear! Etc. The best-willed reader can't get even a hunch about the goings on here, from table, by way of enemies, by way of the spilled oil, to the curious cupful. house of the Lord: Much of the above comment applies here. Meanwhile, your childhood, it must have been something else. General: I hope you're in a humor to do something about your inadequacies- to profit from the time that I spend on your work. As a classmate of your mother and long-time friend of your family, I'm content with all who love you to acknowl- edge your limitations. So you don't figure to make any big waves. Try for a modicum of competence. Trust yourself. Be confident. See me. Spelling O.K. , (c.wtnt,) n4zorm) GROOV3~~~~~~~ ~~~~~ 6UITU. DOW _AH</page></plain_text>
