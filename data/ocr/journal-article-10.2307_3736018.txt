<plain_text><page sequence="1">MLR, 94. I, I999 The two chapters on Milton are excellent. The first of these persuasively demonstrates the 'entanglement of science and politics' in the varying and sometimes contradictory accounts of Creation and of Chaos in Paradise Lost, exploring the implications, theological and scientific, of such passages as 'downward purg'd I The black tartareous cold Infernal dregs' in Book vII. A second chapter, 'Milton and the Mysterious Terms of History', is primarily concerned with Books xi and xiI, whose 'alarming authoritarianism' (p. 166) seems at variance with the presentation of Christian liberty in the poem. Drawing on the distinction between 'ordinary providence' and 'extraordinary providence' in Milton's Christian Doctrine, Rogers locates and comments perceptively on a fundamental inconsistency in Milton's poem, which on the one hand seeks 'to ground in the authority of science a new logic of individualism, a principle of free agency' (p. 159), yet concludes its action with an extended historical narrative whose principal recurrent feature is 'the direct intervention of an anthropomorphic God' (p. 176) asserting power over his creation by meting out punishment. The vitalist net is stretched almost to breaking-point in an extended comparison between Marvell's pastoral poems and the writings and activities of the Digger Gerrard Winstanley. The treatment here of Winstanley is far too brief, and hardly bears out the generalization that Winstanley's 'activist rhetoric is desperately at odds with his pacifist theology' (at one point Rogers even speaks of'the unfortunate action of digging': depoliticizing the Diggers could not go much further than this). Yet Rogers does show that both Marvell and Winstanley are, like other writers during the years I649 to I652, concerned with a 'crisis of agency' in a period of revolutionary change. The second of the two chapters on Marvell is more consistently successful, and its comparisons of Milton's 'Comus' and 'Ode on the Morning of Christ's Nativity' with the final section of 'Upon Appleton House', praising the young Maria Fairfax in extravagant terms, work far better than those yoking Marvell with Winstanley. In a subtly argued discussion, Rogers examines the links between conscience and the 'power of Chastity' for Marvell and Milton. Once again finding a fruitful inconsistency in Marvell's poem, Rogers treats the transition between Maria as wonder-working virgin and as prospective bride as deeply problematical, in its reliance on competing discourses and contradictory views of nature and of politics. Of the writers treated in The Matter of Revolution, the one most directly influenced by vitalism is Margaret Cavendish, Duchess of Newcastle, whose copious, neglected writings on natural philosophy are the subject of Rogers's final chapter; their neglect, even when she has become an icon of early modern feminism, is understandable when we read that she claimed that a billiard ball moved by it own volition, as it realized it was about to be struck by another billiard ball. But, as Rogers shows throughout this impressive study, the historical significance of vitalism in the seventeenth century does not rest upon experimental verification of its claims. UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHAMPTON WARREN CHERNAIK I65o0-I850. Ideas, Aesthetics, and Inquiries in the Early Modern Era, 2 (1996). Ed. by KEVIN L. COPE. New York: AMS Press. 1996. xv + 366 pp. $62.50. The ambitious scope of this annual, reflected in the open arms of its title, determines the character of this volume. It is full of 'ideas' and 'inquiries', concerning or directed at Sheridan, Spinoza, Vermeer, Blake, Margaret Cavendish, Hobbes, I65</page><page sequence="2">Bunyan, Hogarth, Johnson, Shelley, Anne Bronte, Burke, Richardson, Ossian, Onania (and this is not to mention the subjects of the book reviews). The subjects and methodological approaches of the essays vary widely, constituting an all- encompassing, generous postmodern text, in which are juxtaposed, for example: an examination of the expression of female desire (particularly through a discussion of female masturbation) as a subversion of male heterosexual supremacy (by Todd C. Parker), a reading of Leviathan as part of anti-Papist, Protestant apocalyptic rhetoric, a reading of Burke on the French Revolution in terms of Foucault, carnivalization, the sublime, and New Historicist containment theories (Charles Hinnant), a consideration of the influence on Germany of writers from Scotland, and a consideration ofJohnson's style and copia rhetorical figures, followed by a New Age discussion of Shelley's animism and the I 99s (John Freeman). Such various offerings provide something for everyone, but also diffuse consider- ably the weight of individual contributions. The editor at one point notes that 'I650-1850 hopes to revive worthwhile old scholarly traditions as well as to break new scholarly ground' (p. 241). I am not sure what is meant by this statement, but what it reveals is a determination to be all things to all readers, to be 'with it' in publishing theoretically explicit articles on representations of the body (for example) as well as 'humanistic' or 'philological' considerations of biography and rhetoric. In general, this is a worthy intention. However, this open-minded approach is in danger of suggesting a somewhat uncritical attitude to the subjects presented, as if anything goes. This would doubtless be unfair as a characterization of the attitude of the editor and editorial board, but it does reflect the experience of encountering the volume as a reader. 'Every reading experience is in some sense original' (editor's foreword, p. xv). Well, yes and no, and not all are original in an equally interesting (or indeed useful) way. Of most interest to me are the articles on 'Leviathan (i 65 ): Thomas Hobbes and Protestant Apocalypse' (emphasizing, perhaps too insistently, the importance of the appearance of the work at a time of apocalyptic prophesying) by Mark Houlahan; 'National Identity in Scotland and Germany in the Late Eighteenth Century' (an informative consideration of the crucial reading of Scottish writers and 'the Scottish' by Germans, and the different relations to their own nationhood of the two linguistic peoples) by Fania Oz-Salzberger; 'Composing Herself: Music, Solitude, and St. Cecilia in Clarissa' (a sensitive original reading of the structuring role of music in Richardson's novel) by Martha Bowden; 'How to Mis(read) Hogarth: Or, Ekphrasis Galore' (a complaint against intentionalist readings of Hogarth, particularly by Ronald Paulson, using Lichtenberg's comments, among others, on Hogarth: irritably self-serving, though useful in its attempts to loosen up the possibilities of reading) by Peter Wagner; 'Johnsonian Figures: A Cornucopia of Vanity, Idleness, and Death in Samuel Johnson's Prose Writings' (a perceptive analysis of the reasons why Johnson's style moves, and the ways in which it is peculiar to him) by Mark A. Pedreira; 'The Christian Humanism of Anne Bronte' (modestly providing useful evidence for why we should take Anne Bronte more seriously as a woman, a novelist, and feminist) by James Woelfel. Any volume with as many interesting contributions as this has to be considered a success. Its success is the other side of the coin from its problems. The area of consideration for this annual is so broad, in terms of historical scope, methodo- logical considerations, subject-matter, and so on, that it resembles a dense bulletin board, an unrefined repository of disparate interests and subjects. Needless to say, one is grateful for a new publication in which scholars, particularly those younger or not well known in their fields, can present their work to a wider public.

UNIVERSITY OF ZURICH ALLEN REDDICK Philosophical Dialogue in the British Enlightenment. Theology, Aesthetics and the Novel. By MICHAEL PRINCE. (Cambridge Studies in Eighteenth-Century English Litera- ture and Thought) Cambridge, New York, and Melbourne: Cambridge University Press. I996. xiv + 282 pp. ?35; $54.95- Michael Prince begins his book with the figure of chiasmus. 'This book presents a history of philosophical dialogue in the British Enlightenment and an account of the British Enlightenment by means of a history of philosophical dialogue' (p. I). A rhetorical form, that is to say, dialogue, is the means by which a body of ideas is examined at the same time as those ideas illuminate the rhetorical form. As this might indicate, Prince's book is centrally concerned with the ancient debate (antagonism, belligerence, even) between philosophy and literature. Prince himself crisply notes at one point that 'philosophers are trained not to take fictional supplements seriously' while 'literary critics are trained to reduce serious philo- sophical arguments to rhetorical displays' (p. 22): the achievement of this book is to take 'seriously' both 'philosophical argument' and 'rhetorical display'. Prince's argument involves a detailed and intricately modulated history of a debate concerning the nature and function of philosophical dialogue which runs (in and out of dialogues themselves) through eighteenth-century debates over aesthetics, poetics, literary decorum, theology, metaphysics, and so on. Prince's somewhat surprising conclusion is signalled early in the book (indeed in its title) but arrives late in its full articulation and exposition: he suggests that the development of the novel in the later eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries is intimately bound up with developments in an apparently quite separate rhetorical form, the philosophical dialogue. Indeed, his book works something like a detective fiction, asking who killed philosophical dialogue and coming up with the answer that it was not so much killed off as transformed into the mode of a certain kind of novelistic dialogue, exemplified most fully in the work of Jane Austen. Crucial to this transformation and to the debate over the status and function of philosophical dialogue in the eighteenth century is the opposition between the abstract, non-historical, non- contingent realm of ideas on the one hand and the articulation of such ideas by contingent, mortal, historically conditioned people (by characters) on the other: people, that is to say, just in so much as they are characters with idiosyncrasies and particularities, and just in so much as the ideas that they express are tied to their singularity, tend to compromise the force of those ideas. Again, the distinction is between philosophy and literature. Put simply (and in the precision and subtlety of its explication and extrapolation, Prince's book is almost always a long way from such simplifications), developments in the history of ideas, in philosophical aesthetics, in specialized, even professionalized ethics and metaphysics, in a new secularism as well as in the invention of certain conventions of realism that come to be associated with the novel, all conspire to reduce the efficacy of what begins to be seen as an inefficient generic form. As the eighteenth century progresses, philosoph- ical dialogue increasingly comes across as too abstract, artificial, and mannered for a new taste in novelistic mimesis on the one hand and too tied to contingencies of character and situation, too easily distorted by ad hominem individualities to be effective in the statement of metaphysical verities (to be philosophical) on the other.
