<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE ORIGINS OF BIBLICAL MONOTHEISM: ISRAEL'S POLYTHEISTIC BACKGROUND AND THE UGARITIC TEXTS. By Mark S. Smith. Pp. xviii + 325. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001. Cloth, $60.00. It is hard not to be impressed by Mark S. Smith. Study after study, indeed monograph after monograph?technical studies and technical monographs?seem to flow off his pen with ease and at an amazing rate of speed. The Origins of Monotheism, recently released in paperback (2003), is just one of the latest installments. (Note his most recent book, The Memoirs of God: History, Memory, and the Experience of the Divine in Ancient Israel [Minneapolis: Fortress, 2004].) Smith envisions The Origins of Biblical Monotheism as a sequel to his earlier monograph, The Early History of God: Yahweh and the Other Deities in Ancient Israel (San Francisco: Harper &amp; Row, 1990). Indeed, in the second edition of the latter book (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans and Dearborn, Mich.: Dove, 2002), he explicitly states that the new monograph builds on the earlier one "in an effort to develop a more sus tained analysis of the development of monotheism in the seventh and sixth centuries" (p. xxxvii). Despite this explanation, The Origins of Biblical Monotheism actually covers much ground that, on the face of it, does not seem directly pertinent to the main title of the book. Here is where the subtitle with its emphasis on polytheism and the Ugaritic materials enters the picture. It is with these topics</page><page sequence="2">Hebrew Studies 46 (2005) 398 Reviews and in these texts that one finds what Smith believes was missing from his earlier book and what he intends to accomplish in the new one: namely, to take up "the fundamental question of what divinity is" and to address "the categories, structures, [and] characteristics of deities" (p. vii). He is not inter ested in specific deities per se (though some, especially Baal, get much ink), but instead "on the concepts that the ancients used to understand them" (p. 5). After an introduction (pp. 3-26) that helpfully overviews the plan of the study, the book contains three parts. Each is described in turn below. Part 1 covers the structures of divinity and comprises four chapters. First, Smith treats anthropomorphic deities and divine monsters (chap. 1). Next, he covers the divine council and the divine family (chaps. 2-3), before offering a chapter on "Pluralities, Pairings, and Other Divine Relations" (chap. 4). In this first unit, Smith discusses organizational principles that apply to the divine realm, including categories such as center, periphery, and beyond the periph ery; geography and topography; and how a deity's location on such map pings impacts their understanding and reception (e.g., demonic forces are located on the periphery or beyond and do not receive cult like "home gods"). Smith also revisits his earlier work on the four tiers of the Ugaritic pan theon and its (reduced) reflex in Israel (see below). He advocates the family as the dominant structuring device and metaphor for divinity, relying heavily on the dissertation of J. David Schloen (now published as The House of the Fa ther as Fact and Symbol: Patrimonialism in Ugarit and the Ancient Near East [Studies in the Archaeology and History of the Levant 2; Winona Lake: Eisenbrauns, 2001]). In particular, Smith argues that the divine family is modeled on the royal household. Part 2 treats characteristics of divinity. Chapter 5 covers deity traits, espe cially strength and size, body and gender, holiness, and immortality. Given the importance of the latter, especially the question of "dying and rising gods," Smith devotes the next chapter, the longest in the book, to an exten sive review of this category and its applicability to Baal and the Baal Cycle. Future discussions of the dying-and-rising-god motif will owe much to Smith's thorough analysis and devastating critique of Sir James George Frazer's The Golden Bough: A Study in Magic and Religion (London: Macmillian, 1922). It is especially noteworthy that Smith ties Baal's death and "resurrection" to royal funerary cult practices. Only after the first two parts of the book does Smith finally (re)turn to the main title of the book proper, covering the origins of monotheism in the Bible. Part 3 includes four chapters (chaps. 7-10). Chapter 7 treats El and Yahweh and the question of which of these was the original God of "IsraEL" and the Exodus. The correct answer is El; in Smith's reconstruction Yahweh</page><page sequence="3">Hebrew Studies 46 (2005) 399 Reviews was originally just one of El's sons who only later "was identified with El...[and] replaced and became the father whose name only serves as a title for the son" (p. 144). This conclusion notwithstanding, Smith posits that El and Baal may not be the only or best ancestors for Yahweh's original profile; others, for example, Athtar (!) are also possible candidates (p. 146). The last three chapters of the book comprise a unit: chapter 8 discusses the emergence of monotheistic rhetoric in ancient Judah; chapter 9 the forma tion of monotheistic theologies in biblical literature; and chapter 10, of course, monotheism in Second Isaiah. Despite Smith's beautiful epigraph to the last chapter, from T. S. Eliot's Four Quartets, that promises we will arrive at the place we started "[a]nd know the place for the first time" (p. 179), there is actually much that is familiar here. Monotheism is held to be a late phenome non, appearing shortly before the exile, and its main articulators are late, including, especially Second Isaiah. What is (perhaps) new in Smith's interpre tation is that monotheism is not a new stage of religion but "a kind of inner community discourse establishing a distance from outsiders...[so as] to absolutize Yahweh's claim on Israel and to express Israel's ultimate fidelity to Yahweh" (p. 154; cf. p. 9). Monotheism is, therefore, not religious but rhetorical?di rhetorical strategy (pp. 10, 12) or a "new stage of rhetoric" (p. 193). To be sure, the identification of "monotheizing" rhetoric is not without precedent (Smith cites C. R. Seitz [Word Without End: The Old Testament as Abiding Theological Witness (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1997)] on the point; see also the work of J. A. Sanders [e.g., Canon and Community: A Guide to Canonical Criticism (Philadelphia: Fortress, 1984)], W. Brueggemann [e.g., Theology of the Old Testament: Testimony, Dispute, Advocacy (Minneapolis: Fortress, 1997)], C. J. Labuschagne [The Incompa rability of Yahweh in the Old Testament (Leiden: Brill, 1966)]). What is per haps unique is Smith's close connection of this phenomenon with specific (historical) circumstances and the religio-historical conclusions he draws from this correlation. Yet even here there is much that is familiar. Throughout the book, Smith's erudition is everywhere evident. Citations of Ricoeur, Freud, Jung, Eliot, and Shakespeare reside easily alongside those of F. M. Cross, T. J. Lewis, P. D. Miller, and D. Pardee. That said, the book is not an easy read, with parts resembling list-like presentations of data. But it remains a goldmine of information that repays careful and close reading. In my judgment, Smith is at his best when comparing Ugaritic motifs with simi lar biblical concepts (his work with Genesis 1 and Job 38-40 are particularly insightful). Smith's historical reconstructions, while carefully argued, are often more tenuous given the nature of the evidence at our disposal (cf., e.g., the Yahweh/El reconstruction mentioned above). This leads me to two evaluative comments.</page><page sequence="4">Hebrew Studies 46 (2005) 400 Reviews First, this important book is unfortunately hindered by a number of prob lems that should be blamed, not on Smith, but on the publisher. In a work like this one, obviously meant for scholars, it is a tragedy that the book was not better designed for scholarly use. First, there is the use of endnotes rather than footnotes. With as many notes as Smith employs (over 100 pages worth), this is a major impediment and frustration in reading. Second, the lack of a bibliography is lamentable given the richness of Smith's interaction with the literature. Since the bibliographic information provided in the endnotes is generally full and complete, the lack of a bibliography would not be a prob lem save for the fact that, third, there is no author index. In the face of the mass of endnotes, it is virtually impossible to find a source or citation quickly. The inclusion of either a bibliography or author index (or, preferably, both) would have easily rectified this problem. As it stands, the book's present form appears to be another instantiation of a major university press cutting corners or trying to make a scholarly mono graph appeal to a mass market audience. I am not opposed to making the best research (certainly Smith's work qualifies as that!) available to all, but a book's raison d'?tre must be considered and university presses do themselves no favors, nor their readers (lay or otherwise) or their authors, when they ne glect that. In lieu of bibliography and/or author index, it appears that the press opted to repeat full bibliographical information in subsequent (non-initial) cita tions. As this is not consistently done, however, the impression is given, not of an intentional editorial decision, but its opposite: a case of sloppy editing. Un fortunately, this impression is confirmed by a number of typographical errors throughout the book (e.g., pp. 5, 72, 73, 102, 121, 160, 172, 177, 182, 197, 201, 233, 237, 292, 293, 294). Another round of careful editing would have had the added benefit of removing a number of unnecessary reduplications of material (especially in endnotes). Again, in my judgment, these problems are to be laid at Oxford's door, not at Smith's. As such, it is hoped that they can be rectified in future printings of the book. Second, with a book as wide ranging and evocative (not to mention pro vocative) as this one, readers will no doubt find points with which to disagree. One place that I found insightful but also worthy of further discussion was Smith's argument regarding the eclipse of the divine family in Israel, which tends, instead, to image divinity mostly in terms of "a streamlined bureauc racy headed by an absolute monarch" (p. 78). This is due, in his judgment, to the collapse of the four-tiered pantheon known, for instance, at Ugarit. There is much in this explanation to commend it but some problems remain that must be considered: (1) Even at Ugarit, the third and fourth tiers seem insuf ficiently distinct, especially because the third is so poorly attested. The only certain third-tier god, Kothar-wa-Hasis, might be unique given his outsider status. If so, his assignment to a separate tier represented (only) by him is not</page><page sequence="5">Hebrew Studies 46 (2005) 401 Reviews only somewhat circular, it may be a confusion of distinct categories (cf. p. 52). (2) There is virtually no clear evidence of tiers in Israel, and the lack of a full scale second tier (see p. 47) makes the application of the Ugaritic analogue to Israel especially problematic. (3) Bureaucracy, too, is based on family models (specifically, the royal household) according to Smith and Schloen, so Israel's "pantheon" may not be so far removed from the family after all. But, even if Smith is correct?and his argument is certainly possible if not, in fact, quite plausible?how should this eclipse and collapse be explained and interpreted! These are even more debatable points. Smith's own position, that a change of affairs took place in the eighth century when the Neo-Assyrian empire "pre sented a new world order," only after which "did Israel require a different 'world theology,'" is possible but hardly certain (p. 49; cf. p. 165). Apart from striking one as a kind of "little man" monotheism, how could such a position be demonstrated? There is the feel of a deus ex machina about it: some external situation, certainly political (economic, too, no doubt) must ex plain Israel and its religion. Internal developments, when they are allowed, are also predominantly socio-economic (and reconstructive) in nature: changes in the Israelite family due to erosion of the lineage system by the seventh cen tury (see pp. 79, 164-166). Internal genius, internal theological development, even?could it be possible??sui generis formulations seem to be ruled out. And yet one wonders if, in doing so, the results will be anything but somewhat reductionistic and dissatisfying since (a) the evidence at our disposal will only permit reconstruction (nothing beyond that), and (b), still more importantly, the topics at hand?divinity and monotheism?are pro foundly if not irreducibly theological. Readers will have to evaluate these debated points for themselves. One thing is beyond contention: even if Smith's latest opus does not answer all our questions, it remains an indispensable tool on the way to doing so. And so, he impresses yet again! Brent A.
