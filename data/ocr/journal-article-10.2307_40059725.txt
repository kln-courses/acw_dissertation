<plain_text><page sequence="1">"THE LESSONS OF TRUE RELIGION": MARY SHELLEY'S TRIBUTE TO CATHOLICISM IN VALPERGA Michael Schiefelbein Like many of her English contemporaries during the century of Catho- lic Emancipation,1 Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley openly scorned Roman Catholicism. Admittedly, she and her enlightened circle had little use for Christianity in general, but at least Protestantism was born of a fight for liberty while Catholicism was the very source of subjugation requiring the rebellion. During her 1842 travels through Luther's Germany she wrote There is something pleasing in the mere outward aspect of these Protestant German towns: they look clean, orderly, and well-built. Hail to the good fight, the heart says everywhere; hail to the soil whence intellectual liberty gained, with toil and suffering, the victory - not complete yet - but which, thanks to the men of those time, can never suffer entire defeat! In time, it will spread to those countries which are still subject to Papacy. (Rambles in Germany and Italy 1 : 209). One country still darkened by papal control, her beloved Italy, inspired her most venomous attacks on centuries of power-hungry popes "who teach him [man] to fast and tell his beads - to bend the neck to the yoke - to obey the church, not God" {Rambles 2: 186). Although she was concerned with political as well as intellectual liberty, apparently the latter cause especially kindled Shelley's idealism. It was by nourishing ignorance, superstition, and dependency on the clergy2 that the Catholic hierarchy dehumanized the faithful, both robbing them of their freedom to reason and instilling in them vices associated with unenlightened thinking. In her 1824 short story "The Bride of Modern Italy," the protagonist's incon- stancy and lack of dignity are ascribed to the "Catholic religion, which R&amp;L 30.2 (Summerl998) 59</page><page sequence="2">60 Religion &amp; Literature crushes the innate conscience by giving a false one in its room; the system of artifice and heartlessness that subsists in a convent; the widely spread maxim in Italy, that dishonour attaches itself to the discovered not the concealed fault" {Collected Tales 34). Several of her short stories echo such a sentiment.3 Not surprisingly, Shelley populates Valperga, her only novel set com- pletely in Italy, with superstitious peasants and corrupt and cruel priests. But a careful inspection of this novel reveals another picture of Catholi- cism, one so remarkably attractive that a reader unfamiliar with the views of the author might find it hard to believe she ever found serious fault with the Roman Church. In this essay, I purpose to explore this strangely positive picture and demonstrate that in the heroine's Catholic approach to faith and reason, Mary Shelley creates a model for herself. A prefatory word about Shelley's literary achievements will be helpful since they are still generally unknown, none but Frankenstein winning enough popularity to remain in print since it was published. Between 1818, when the twenty-year-old author's famous novel appeared, and her death in 1851, Shelley published four more novels, three volumes of biographies for Lardner's Cabinet Cyclopaedia, two travel books, and a number of short stories.4 She also published two editions, with invaluable commentary, of the poetry of her husband Percy Bysshe Shelley, contribut- ing in no small way to his place among the great Romantic poets. Until the nineteen fifties, critical and biographical interest in Shelley was confined to aspects of her life and work that shed light on her husband's genius. Biographies considering Shelley in her own right finally started appearing in the middle of this century and have proliferated ever since.5 In the nineteen seventies Frankenstein began receiving substantial critical attention frompsychoanalytic and feminist critics, who revealed this novel to be "an essential text for our exploration of female conscious- ness and literary technique" (Mellor xi).6 Studies of Shelley as a critic of patriarchy have continued to flourish, alongside studies focusing on her critique of romantic ideology.7 Such perspectives have begun to lead scholars beyond Frankenstein to the rest of her work, including: Valperea? Representation of Catholicism in Valperga Set in the Italian city states of the early fourteenth century, Valperga (1823) was inspired by the historical figure Castruccio Antelminelli, a Ghibelline who returned to Italy from exile to crush his Guelph enemies and ruthlessly tyrannize Tuscany with the support of the invading German</page><page sequence="3">MICHAEL SCHIEFELBEIN 6 1 Emperor.9 But as it progresses, the three-volume novel shifts its focus from political strife to the personal turmoil of two women who love Castruccio, the prophetess Beatrice and the Countess of Valperga, Euthanasia.10 One might be tempted to see the character of Beatrice as the embodi- ment of Mary Shelley's anti-Catholicism.11 Beatrice is the child of heretic Wilhelmina of Bohemia, who professes to be "the Holy Ghost incarnate upon earth for the salvation of the female sex" {Valperga 2: 26). Though she is rescued from the sect, she grows up to claim for herself extraordinary spiritual powers. For her blasphemy she is persecuted by Dominican Inquisitors eager for her death and saved only by Castruccio 's interven- tion. Later in the novel she is imprisoned and sexually abused by the fiendish priest Tripalda, who exemplifies many priests in the tale, corrupt- ing even "the lessons of our divine master ... to satisfy the most groveling desires" (1: 194). Yet, Tripalda is the only Church representative to play a central role in the ruin of Beatrice, inquisitors and other priests having little effect on her or on the story in general. And as a counter example to this monstrous member of the clergy, Shelley provides a character even more closely identified with the Church's power, the kind Bishop of Ferrara. In book 2, chapter 11, the Bishop relates to Castruccio the events leading to his adoption of Beatrice as a young child. At the time, Wilhelmina has recently died, and the heretic's disciple Manfreda is under arrest by the Inquisition. Despite his fears about involving himself with the misguided sect, the Bishop, then a young priest, takes pity on the suffering Manfreda, promis- ing to protect Beatrice, now her ward. Risking contagion, he enters the dwelling of a leper hiding the girl and takes her into his care. "[N]eed I say," the Bishop asks Castruccio, "how much I have ever loved this hapless girl, and cherished her, and tried to save her from the fate to which her destiny has hurried her?" (2: 40). He confides in Castruccio, whom he mistakenly deems "humane and generous," in order "to secure another protector for my poor Beatrice, if I were to die, and she fell into any misfortune or disgrace" (2: 44). It seems, then, that for all her condemnation of clerics who inflict misery on Beatrice, Shelley declines to cast the Church in general as villain in her tale. Included among those who deceive and abuse the naive prophetess are Castruccio, who seduces and abandons Beatrice, and the witch, who precipitates her death after playing upon her desperation, by drugging her. By far the worst culprit in the emotional and spiritual destruction of Beatrice, according to Shelley, is her own undisciplined imagination.</page><page sequence="4">62 Religion &amp; Literature The dangers of her fantasies are first perceived by the Bishop. As a child, Beatrice would sit in contemplation for hours at a time, only to weep hysterically when the Bishop questioned her about her thoughts. Then, he confesses to Castruccio, "As she grew older, her imagination developed," and her meditations on God and Nature "[yielded] a sentiment that overwhelmed and oppressed her, so that she could only weep and sigh" (2: 41). She begs him to teach her the truths of the Catholic faith, but "the more she heard, and the more she read, the more she gave herself up to contemplation and solitude, and to what I cannot help considering the wild dreams of her imagination" (2: 42). The Bishop blames these wild dreams for Beatrice's heresy and arrest, but they also contribute to her seduction. In her prayer to the Blessed Virgin, Beatrice, "burning with passion" for Castruccio, "wove a subtle web, whose materials she believed heavenly, but which were indeed stolen from the glowing wings of love" (2: 79). "[A]las!" the narrator laments, "to her they [her dreams] were reali- ties" (2: 80). Beatrice herself recognizes her wild imagination as the source of her agony, and in a speech to Euthanasia she curses God for creating it: Did not the power you worship create the passions of man; his desires which outleap possibility, and bring ruin on his head? ... And the imagination, that masterpiece of his malice; that spreads honey on the cup that you may drink poison; that strews roses over thorns, thorns sharp and big as spears; that sem- blance of beauty which beckons you to the desart [sic] .... He, the damned and triumphant one, sat meditating many thousand years for the conclusion, the consummation, the final crown, the seal of all misery, which he might set on man's brain and heart to doom him to endless torment; and he created the Imagination. (3: 46-47) When she turns to Euthanasia for solace, the Countess explains that the soul, like a cave, contains dark recesses where a "madman" dwells. Only those whose shadowy corners are exposed to an "inborn light" should explore them; otherwise the madman "makes darkling, fantastic combina- tions" and leads the soul to destruction (3: 101-02). Most people, she suggests, should avoid those recesses and linger in others where "Content of Mind" rules over noble passions, including an apparently positive form of Imagination (3: 102). Euthanasia's allegory of the soul is meant to teach Beatrice "to regulate its various powers" (3: 99). But Beatrice responds in anguish: "No content of mind exists for me, no beauty of thought, or poetry; and, if imagination live, it is as a tyrant, armed with fire, and venomed darts, to drive me to despair" (3: 102).</page><page sequence="5">MICHAEL SCHIEFELBEIN 63 If Beatrice represents a critique of irrationality rather than Catholicism, Euthanasia does voice some of Shelley's negative views of the Roman Church. When Castruccio suggests that Beatrice be entrusted to a convent after her abuse in Rome, Euthanasia rejects his advice as "chilling coun- cils" (3: 103). She sees the piety of Florence's "noblest citizens" as little more than "faith in astrology and portents" (2: 3), further denouncing the "treacherous and unprincipled" Tripalda (3: 199) and corrupt priests who "make a revenue" from "the absolution" they confer in the confessional (1 : 195). Loathe to align herself with the oppressive papacy against the German Emperor, she does so only because "[s]he is attached to the cause of the freedom of Florence," as Count Fondi reports, "and not to the power of her Popes" (1 : 177). The anti-Church sentiments she places on the lips of her heroine are unquestionably vituperative. However, in many ways Shelley portrays Euthanasia as a model Catholic. The Countess piously invokes the Virgin Mary's assistance in defending Castruccio from the deceitful Tripalda and his forces (3: 209) and in prison prays to her, repeating "the Catholic ejaculation, 'Stella, alma, benigna, ora pro nobisV then, crossing herself, she lay[s] down to rest, and quickly ... [sleeps], as peacefully and happily, as a babe rocked in its mother's arms" (3: 243). Her devout Catholic life has prepared her for this final crisis. Early in the novel, she obeys the Ave Maria bell summoning all to worship, leading her guests to Valperga's chapel and joining "in the devotions of the priest" (1: 288). She admires a "procession of monks ...chaunting in a sweet and solemn tone, in that language which once awoke the pauses of this Roman air with words of fire" (1: 203). Consoling the downcast Beatrice on her way to Rome, she offers to be her confessor, assigning her "light penances of cheerfulness and hope" (2: 184). This metaphoric function becomes literal after Beatrice's return: kneeling before Euthanasia, the heretical Beatrice exclaims, "Trust me, you shall make me a Catholic again, if you will love me unceasingly for one whole year" (3: 52). Euthanasia promises to bring her back into the true fold, thereby "in part fulfilling my task on the earth" (3: 54). Indeed, in her role as "ministering angel" (3: 37) to her subjects, to Beatrice, and Castruccio himself, Euthanasia is identified with the most revered saint of the Roman Church: the Virgin Mary. Granted, much literature of the nineteenth century portrays women as angelic beings, often in language evoking the Virgin12 - even Valperga's heterodox Beatrice is described in this way at times. But Euthanasia's identification with the</page><page sequence="6">64 Religion &amp; Literature Blessed Virgin is striking, particularly in light of her role as teacher of the faith and her own devotion to the Virgin. In her first appearance in the novel, Euthanasia is presented with the traditional features of Marian iconography: "a veil that was wreathed round her head"; blue eyes whose orbs seem "to reflect ... the pure and unfathomable brilliance, which strikes the sight as darkness, of a Roman heaven"; a brow upon which "Charity dwelt"; an expression of "wisdom exalted by enthusiasm"; a gown "rather plain, being neither ornamented with gold nor jewels"; and "a silk vest of blue [that] reached from her neck to her feet, girded at the waist by a small embroidered band" (1: 185-86). Later, the narrator refers to Euthanasia's "Madonna face" (3: 230-31), and when Tripalda furnishes a letter claiming that Euthanasia has joined his conspiracy against Castruccio, his ally Vanni indignantly exclaims, "I expect next to hear that some of the saints or martyrs, or perhaps the Virgin herself has come down to aid you" (3: 224). Euthanasia's Scholastic Tendencies For all her piety, it is her great nobility that makes Euthanasia the heroine of Valperga. But like her piety, this nobility is of a Catholic nature: it is achieved through the harmonization of faith and reason. From her scholarly father, Euthanasia has learned "to fathom my sensa- tions, and discipline my mind; to understand what my feelings were, and whether they arose from a good or evil source" (1: 194). Her lessons in rationality sustain her in the agony she endures when Castruccio chooses power over love for her, preventing both her despair and surrender to him at the price of her ideals. But for Euthanasia rationality cannot be sepa- rated from faith, as we see in a passage following Beatrice's "anathema against the creation" (3: 51): [Euthanasia] thought over her wild denunciations; and, strange to say, she felt doubly warmed with admiration of the creation, and gratitude towards God, at the moment that Beatrice had painted its defects. She thought of the beauty of the world and the wondrous nature of man, until her mind was raised to an enthusias- tic sentiment of happiness and praise. "And you also shall curb your wild thoughts," whispered Euthanasia, as she looked at the sleeping girl; "I will endeavour to teach you the lessons of true religion" (3: 54) The "true religion" promised by Euthanasia requires replacing Beatrice's "wild," "wandering thoughts" (3: 54) with sound judgments about the goodness of creation, what the Church's Scholastic Fathers, in the century before Valperga's events, called "right reason." This faculty apprehends</page><page sequence="7">MICHAEL SCHIEFELBEIN 65 order in the world and God as the source of this order. In fact, according to Thomas Aquinas, the Church's greatest Scholastic, the ultimate truth of God's existence can be determined by reason acting independently of revelation. Reason's starting point is the senses, as Aquinas explains in his Summa Contra Gentiles: For, according to its manner of knowing in the present life, the intellect depends on the sense for the origin of knowledge; and so those things that do not fall under the senses cannot be grasped by the human intellect except in so far as the knowledge of them is gathered from sensible things. Now, sensible things cannot lead the human intellect to the point of seeing in them the nature of the divine substance; for sensible things are effects that fall short of the power of their cause. Yet, beginning with sensible things, our intellect is led to the point of knowing about God that He exists, and other such characteristics that must be attributed to the First Principle, (bk 1, ch 3 in On the Truth of the Catholic Faith: 63) Euthanasia's frequent meditations on the world apprehended by her senses yields such defining characteristics of the Deity. She grasps in imperfect, created being reflections of the three most fundamental aspects of Perfect Being: unity, goodness, and truth. The following passage shows such an insight raised to the level of mystical experience: To look on the hues of the sunset, to see the softened tints of the olive woods, the purple tinge of the distant mountains, whose outline was softly, yet distinctly marked in the orange sky; to feel the western breeze steal across her cheek, like words of love from one most dear; to see the first star of evening penetrate from out the glowing western firmament, and whisper the secret of distant worlds to us in our narrow prison; to behold the heaven-pointing cypress with unbent spire sleep in the stirless air; these were sights and feelings which softened and exalted her thoughts; she felt as if she were a part of the great whole; she felt bound in amity to all; doubly, immeasurably loving those dear to her, feeling an humanizing charity even to the evil. (2: 164-65) In this paean to "the great whole," to the "secret of distant worlds" revealed in it and the "amity" and "charity" inspired by it, Euthanasia exalts the unity, truth, and goodness underlying creation. In the next paragraph she explicitly acknowledges the divine source of the created world and suggests that in loving even its evil elements - like Castruccio - she fulfills the design of the creator: "Oh! sooner shall that [sun] forget its path which it hath ever traced, since God first marked it out, than I forget to love!" (2: 166). According to Aquinas, though God's existence and his essential at- tributes are discovered by human reason, the truths of revelation - i.e., Christian dogmas - "absolutely surpass its power" {Summa Contra Gentiles,</page><page sequence="8">66 Religion &amp; Literature bk 1, ch 3, in On the Truth of the Catholic Faith: 63). But even such specific teachings, he argues, are not contrary to reason for "it is impossible that the truth of faith should be opposed to those principles that the human reason knows naturally" (bk 1, ch 7: 74). In her frequent discrimination between superstition and true Catholic piety, Euthanasia exhibits the Thomistic view of faith's reasonability. No wonder she offers this rational counsel to the crazed Beatrice: "Why will you not recal [sic] the creeds of your childhood, as your adoptive parents taught them you? I cannot school you better than they" (3: 55). Why argue that Shelley takes her transcendentalism from Aquinas rather than from Coleridge, another Christian metaphysician? After all, the philosophy of Coleridge influenced all the Romantics, including Mary and her husband, and Coleridge himself, friend and student of William Godwin, was a frequent visitor in Mary's childhood home. The answer is that in heavenly matters Shelley found her greatest inspiration not in Coleridge but in Dante, whose Paradiso she exalted in her fiction, corre- spondence, and journals.13 And Dante found his inspiration in Aquinas, his "greatest teacher" according to Dante scholar John Sinclair (173), who "more than any other summed up for Dante the Christian doctrine of God" (160). In his Paradiso, Dante places Aquinas in the glorious sphere of the Sun, where he instructs the earthly visitor at great length on a truth that frequently elevates the spirit of Valperga's heroine: "the splendor of that Idea" which "shines through more and less" all creation (canto 13 in Sinclair 191 and 193). Unlike the philosophical views of Coleridge, those of Aquinas suited well the sensibilities of Shelley. In his epistemology, Aquinas was a realist in the tradition of Aristotle, while Coleridge was an idealist influenced by Kant. These two approaches yield distinct implications about human knowledge, and, indeed, about human nature itself. Whereas realism emphasizes the dependency of human knowledge on being, idealism gives priority to the power of intellect itself as a creative force. According to Kant, we know only that which is presented to our minds by a priori categories of reason. Coleridge echoes this conclusion in poems like "De- jection: An Ode" in which Nature is depicted as lifeless apart from our imagination. Like his Romantic contemporaries, Coleridge exalts the individual genius, the brilliance of poetic imagination. It is a "repetition in the finite mind of the eternal act of creation in the infinite I AM" that "dissolves, diffuses, dissipates, in order to recreate ... It is essentially vital, even as all objects (as objects) are dead" (ch 1 3 of Biographia Uteraria in Norton 396-97).</page><page sequence="9">MICHAEL SCHIEFELBEIN 67 Such exaltation of human creativity at the expense of a universe exter- nal to the imagination would be abhorrent to Aquinas, who understood knowledge as re-presenting the world to the mind. Humans are drawn by reality, as it were, and ultimately by God himself as the final end of intellect, as Aquinas argues in the Summa Contra Gentiles: And since operations of this kind [understanding] take their species from their objects, by which also they are known, it follows that the more perfect the object of any such operation, the more perfect is the operation. Consequently to understand the most perfect intelligible, namely God, is the most perfect in the genus of the operation which consists in understanding. Therefore to know God by an act of understanding is the last end of every intellectual substance, (bk 3, ch 25 in Introduction to St. Thomas Aquinas 443) As a student of Aquinas via Dante, Shelley rejected Coleridge's glorifi- cation of human imagination. We see this in Valperga, not only in Euthanasia's warnings to Beatrice, but in the emphasis Euthanasia places on worship as the end of the ecstatic moments she experiences in contemplating nature. Her response to Beatrice's "anathema against creation" bears this out, as we have seen: "she felt doubly warmed with admiration of the creation and gratitude towards God" and "an enthusiastic sentiment of happiness and praise" - attitudes that immediately precede her promise to teach Beatrice "the lessons of true religion" (3: 54). In her essay "Why Women Didn't Like Romanticism," Anne Mellor explains the abhorrence Shelley felt for romantic ideology in terms of the destruction it caused in her lifetime. On a large scale, "a romantic idealiza- tion of radical political change" (283) had produced fifteen years of horror in France after the French Revolution. Poets like Percy Bysshe Shelley, whose verse acted as "a clarion call to revolutionary political action" (283), celebrated the creative process and ignored "the creative product." Ac- cording to Mellor, Shelley critiques such irresponsibility in her character Victor Frankenstein, who forgets the product of his creation. Shelley believed that at the root of this irresponsibility was an inflated sense of self, as Mellor explains: Mary Shelley was profoundly disturbed by what she saw to be a powerful egotism at the core of the romantic ideology: an afFirmation of the human imagination as divine defined the mission of the poet as not only the destroyer of "mind-forged manacles" and political tyranny but also as the savior of mankind, the "unac- knowledged legislators of the world." She had seen at first hand how self-indulgent this self-image of the poet-savior could be (284).</page><page sequence="10">68 Religion &amp; Literature Her "first hand" experience had shown Shelley that romantic ideology wreaks destruction in the home as well as in society. Mellor goes on to list the "poet-savior[s]" in Shelley's life who had brought misery to their families: her father William Godwin, Coleridge, Byron, Leigh Hunt, and even her husband Percy Bysshe Shelley. In concluding her essay, Mellor suggests that women of the Romantic period, like Austen and Shelley, promoted an alternative ideology which "celebrated the education of the rational woman and an ethic of care that required one to take full respon- sibility for the predictable consequences of one's thoughts and actions, for all the children of one's mind and body" (285). This brand of romanticism, "equally revolutionary" (285) is what Shelley's mother, Mary Wollstonecraft, had called "a REVOLUTION in female manners" {A Vindication of the Rights of Woman as quoted in Mellor 285). Certainly in Valperga we see such a move as Euthanasia, a victim of male romanticism, exalts reason over emotion and urges the abused Beatrice to do the same. Shelley creates in Euthanasia a thinking moral agent, who must resist her own feelings for Castruccio and must suffer the painful consequences - for herself and the people under her care - of adhering to principles of liberty, responsibility, and patriotism. By giving her such a role, Shelley challenges contemporary conceptualizations of the feminine ideal as a secularized Virgin Mary, passive and ineffectual, free "from any need for internal moral struggle" because of her otherworldly innocence (Looten 53). l4 Euthanasia's association with the Virgin, discussed above, drives home Shelley's determination to subvert such a conceptualization and thereby follow in the footsteps of her mother. In A Vindication of the Rights of Woman, Mary Wollstonecraft insisted on full humanity for women as rational beings, held to the same moral standards as men and capable of the same moral achievements.15 For Euthanasia, these achievements include a "humanizing charity even to the evil" {Valperga 2:165), inspired by her belief that even morally repugnant persons like Castruccio are creatures of God. Dante, whose vision of hell includes the worst sinners of history, is the model of such compassion - at least towards souls condemned for weakness rather than malice, like those of Ciacco, the glutton, and Francesca and Paolo, guilty of unlawful love. In the Inferno's circles of punishment, he recognizes the gradations of divergence from humanity's inherent orientation toward goodness, a concept elucidated in Aquinas's explanation in canto 1 3 of the Paradiso: "beneath the stamp of the [divine] idea the light then shines through more and less; hence it comes that trees of one and the same species bear better and worse fruit and you are born with different talents</page><page sequence="11">MICHAEL SCHIEFELBEIN 69 (Sinclair 93). For Aquinas, this comment applies also to degrees of moral perfection, as he explains in question 5 of the Summa Theologica (Introduction to St. Thomas Aquinas 34-45). The Function of Catholicism for Shelley Shelley's heroine bespeaks more than a desire to balance criticism of Catholicism with examples of individuals who excel despite their Roman faith - a desire she suggests a few times in her travel writing.16 Indeed, as we have seen, Euthanasia's nobility largely depends on her Catholic faith, understood in a way that appeals to an intellectual with deeply religious sensibilities. Despite the influence of freethinkers in her life and of her husband, an avowed atheist, Mary Shelley stubbornly clung to a belief in God through- out her life. Her journals, correspondence, and even travel writing record passionate prayers of praise and of surrender to the Divine Will, as well as professions of faith in life beyond the grave.17 Like many of her enlight- ened circle, she rejected Christianity, as she asserted to Lord Byron when he teased her about her religious sensibilities18 ; however, she was reared by her father to admire the teachings of Jesus, and she occasionally attended church services to reflect on them. More importantly, her view of God, seen especially in the visions she gives to Euthanasia, corresponds to Dante's Thomistic version of it in his Paradiso. Above a hierarchy of spirits, Dante's God is "Eternal Light," and the soul's greatest joy is to contem- plate that light, indeed to merge with it, as Dante exclaims: "Thus my mind, all rapt, was gazing, fixed, still and intent, and ever enkindled with gazing. At that light one becomes such that it is impossible for him ever to consent that he should turn from it to another sight ..." (canto 33 in Sinclair 483). 19 It is not surprising that Shelley, whose parents exalted reason, admires a heaven of eternal enlightenment, the absolute fulfillment of the mind. The God of light and beauty infinitely surpasses the anthropomorphic, fre- quently vindictive God she descries in her early essay, "A History of the Jews."20 Still, Dante's God remains a personal Divinity, not simply a philosophical ideal. He is a Being like Dante himself who, according to Shelley, "regards the objects of the visible creation with ... sympathy" (Rambles 1: 96), offering solace in contemplation and guaranteeing the eternal survival of souls. Such a God was crucial to a woman like Mary Shelley, tragically bereft of three children and her young; husband, wounded to the point of emo-</page><page sequence="12">70 Religion &amp; Literature tional collapse by the betrayal of her friend Jane Williams, and denounced by others in her mature years.21 These hardships, along with her final illness, would have disheartened an unflagging optimist; they nearly devas- tated the pessimistic, depression-proned Shelley. Muriel Spark expresses the views of many scholars in noting that there seemed to be "some force within her [Shelley] that repelled happiness or even an equitable state of well-being" (120). Indeed, Shelley's correspondence is filled with lamenta- tions like the one she utters to Jane Williams in the letter referring to her increasing religiosity: "vain wishes &amp; dispair [sic] are my dayly [sic] occupations. I look with inconceivable horror on the future ..." (April 23, 1823). But she found strength in her religious convic- tions, especially her belief in an afterlife with her husband, as this emo- tional passage from her journal illustrates: Sorrow - Sorrow - Why am I here? - but that I am destined to be wiser, better &amp; happier than I am - if it be not so - oh my God! quickly extinguish this spark of life, the tormented atom, this u [sic] wretched thing of aspiration &amp; despair - but I have faith - a firm &amp; true knowledge that I go to him, &amp; so, not tearless, not alas! uncomplain[in]g - yet resigned, I nerve myself for the future. (December 19, 1822) The complementarity of reason and faith brought to Shelley's life a wholeness in the midst of frequent losses. Like her heroine Euthanasia, she found spiritual nourishment in both study22 and contemplation. As much as she prized the "intellectual liberty" that Protestantism represented for her, in her philosophical sensibilities she resembled Medieval mystics or theologians more than the radical Protestants of her own day.23 For Evangelicals in the Church of England and Dissenters like the Methodists who gave birth to the Evangelical spirit, scholarly pursuits had little relevance to a mission of awakening a simple but profound faith in Christ among the working and middle classes. True, forbears of the reform movement, inspired by Milton's On Education, had established outstanding and progressive schools known as Dissenting Academies, which endured through 1 796 (Armstrong 41-42). Moreover, John Wesley, John Wilberforce, Hannah More, and other early reform leaders were scholars who pro- moted education for the working class. Still, what characterized the reform movement during Mary Shelley's early life was missionary zeal, works of charity including the establishment of charity schools, and campaigns against the slave trade. In the zealous dedication to practical Christianity - many elements of which would have won Shelley's support - there was little place for speculative theology.</page><page sequence="13">MICHAEL SCHIEFELBEIN 7 1 Later in the century, as Walter Houghton notes, critics of Evangelical- ism even accused the movement of anti-intellectualism. Mark Pattison, elected rector of Oxford's Lincoln College in 1861, was one such critic: Pattison traced "the professed contempt of all learned inquiry, which was a principle with the Evangelical school" to its protest against the intellectual, if too dry and rational, character of eighteenth-century apologetics: "Evangelism, in its origin, was a reaction against the High-Church 'evidences'; the insurrection of the heart and conscience of man against an arid orthodoxy. It insisted on a 'vital Christianity,' as against the Christianity of books. Its instinct was from the first against intelligence. No text found more favour with it than 'Not many wise, not manv learned.5" (125) No doubt Pattison's assessment needs to be considered in light of his High-Church biases. Moreover, it is a somewhat anachronistic interpreta- tion of "the Evangelical school ['s]" past attitudes in terms of its mid- century disdain for the erudition of John Henry Newman and the Oxford Movement's tracts. As Houghton explains, the eighteen-thirties and - forties were years of anxiety, when "the foundations of religious and political life were being shaken by new ideas, and Church and State seemed often in peril" (127). The remedy offered by Evangelicals was the Bible: infallible on "all questions," it eliminated the need to seek truth from any other written source (126). Pattison's assessment also fails to take into account intelligent women in the early Evangelical movement, who inter- preted scripture in a radically new way. In The Reader's Repentance, Christine Krueger demonstrates that in their writing, reformers like Hannah More and Charlotte Elizabeth Toma were "revising and subverting the domi- nant Christian ideology" about the subordinate role of women in society in order to "re-envision women's lives and represent them authoritatively" (9).24 Many such reformers, like Shelley herself, emphasized rationality as the means to authority for women, since emotionalism left them vulner- able to manipulation and abuse. Still, if "anti-intellectual" is too severe a label for Protestant reformers of the early nineteenth century, we might venture to say that even intellectu- als like John Wesley and Hannah More (after her conversion) would consider self-indulgent, if not wasted, a life devoted to the intellect, as Mary Shelley's was, nourished by the work of Homer, Virgil, Dante, enlightenment philosophers, and the atheist-radical Percy Bysshe Shelley. The Evangelical mission was a practical one that relied on confessional faith, dedication, and organizational strategies - all in the service of charitable works and the winning of souls. Purely intellectual pursuits</page><page sequence="14">72 Religion &amp; Literature were, at best, irrelevant and, at worst, misguided substitutions for Chris- tian service and the reading of scripture.25 The Roman Church, conversely, had a long tradition of encouraging study of the humanities and had canonized mystics and scholars, as well as theologians like Aquinas who expanded the Christian faith into volumes of esoteric discourse rather than attempting to condense it to a simple profession. The Church had championed the life of the mind, which brings to faith definition while probing its sublimity, as Dante's Paradiso demonstrates. In direct opposition to anti-intellectualism, the Church formalized its traditional teaching in Dei Filius, a document of the First Vatican Council (1870): Not only can there be no conflict between faith and reason, they also support each other since right reason demonstrates the foundations of faith and, illumined by its light, pursues the science of divine things, while faith frees and protects reason from errors and provides it with manifold insights. It is therefore far remote from the truth to say that the Church opposes the study of human arts and sciences; on the contrary, she supports and promotes them in many ways. (Dupuis and Neuner, 49) Besides this harmonization of faith and reason, Catholicism offered another kind of integration, which also must have inspired Shelley as she planned Valperga. Her husband describes it well in his introduction to The Cenci, z. play written just before Shelley started her novel on Castruccio and based upon a historical document that she had transcribed for him.26 As an apology for what may seem "to a Protestant apprehension" an "un- natural" intimacy that the Catholic characters, even the evil ones, seem to share with God, the author explains that [R]eligion in Italy is not, as in Protestant countries, a cloak to be worn on particular days; or a passport which those who do not wish to be railed at carry with them to exhibit; or a gloomy passion for penetrating the impenetrable mysteries of our being .... Religion coexists, as it were, in the mind of an Italian Catholic with a faith in that of which all men have the most certain knowledge. It is interwoven with the whole fabric of life. It is adoration, faith, submission, penitence, blind admiration; not a rule of moral conduct. It has no necessary connexion with any one virtue. The most atrocious villain may be rigidly devout, and without any shock to established faith, confess himself to be so. Religion pervades intensely the whole frame of society, and is according to the temper of the mind which it inhabits, a passion, a persuasion, an excuse, a refuge; never a check. (Shelley's Poetry and Prose, 24 1 -242) In the language of Catholic theology we might understand such a phenomenon as the union of grace and nature, however corrupted nature has become in specific individuals. Shelley's own acceptance of such a</page><page sequence="15">MICHAEL SCHIEFELBEIN 73 complexity might very well explain why the heroine of Valperga refuses to surrender her faith in the face of hypocrisy and cruelty on the part of Christian leaders and priests - why, perceiving God even in the most corrupted natures, she gravitates toward those who are fallen. In the tragedies she endured, in the magnitude of her depression, Mary Shelley knew the despair experienced by Beatrice the prophetess and Beatrice's "analogue" in The Cenci27 In her persistent faith, however, she clung to the example she created in her heroine Euthanasia, a character who might have filled a role missing in The Cenci, according to its preface: "Revenge, retaliation, atonement, are pernicious mistakes," while "the fit return to make to the most enormous injuries is kindness and forbearance, and a resolution to convert the injurer from his dark passions by peace and love" (240). Of course, the idealistic Euthanasia is doomed from the beginning since Shelley remains faithful to the facts of history about the ruthless Castruccio. Euthanasia, like the liberty of Florence, is the victim of a cruel tyrant. However, as William Walling rightly argues, Shelley intends Valperga as a critique of the traditional understanding of success and heroism. Like some of her Romantic contemporaries disillusioned by Napoleon's ex- ploits, she rejected the Machiavellianism embodied in him and tyrants before him, like the Caesars and Alexander the Great. The purpose of Valperga, Walling contends, is to show the "essential emptiness" of Castruccio 's life and the superiority of "liberty and of the domestic virtues and of the absence of personal ambition" - all embodied in Euthanasia, who tells Castruccio to "love obscurity" (70). Walling argues that, although Euthanasia is reduced to a captured member of the utterly defeated republican party, she can still assert to the victorious Gastruccio the moral point of his ostensibly successful career: that his life is 'miserable' and 'unworthy' - while Castruccio, driven for the moment into the clarity of genuine insight, can do nothing more than agree [III, 248-501. (70) Thus, the novel ends with the death of the Countess since "when the moral standard of Valperga vanishes in the person of Euthanasia, Castruccio 's career becomes meaningless" (60). The story of Euthanasia, like the history of tyranny, is tragic. However, Euthanasia, though finally imprisoned and drowned at sea, is morally victorious because she never ceases to live by her principles. Instead of being borne to Ghibelline Sicily, she is borne to her death, and in her death, as her name suggests, she possesses forever the peace she has promoted throughout her life. Like Dante's beautiful guide to Paradise (the</page><page sequence="16">74 Religion &amp; Literature namesake of whom the Paterin Beatrice falls short), Euthanasia expresses Shelley's own idealism.28 No wonder, in describing Titan's "Assumption of the Virgin," Shelley declares, "Such a picture, and the Taradiso' of Dante as a commentary, is the sublimest achievement of Catholicism" [Rambles II, 91). Christian Brothers University NOTES 1. Anti-Catholicism, widespread in England from the sixteenth century on, was exacerbated in the nineteenth century by increasing state tolerance of the Roman Church, beginning in the end of the previous century. In 1 778, the Catholic Relief Act was passed, allowing Catholic education and giving Catholics the right to inherit land. The anti-papist Gordon riots followed on the heels of this legislation in 1 780. During the early eighteen twenties heated parliamentary debate ensued over the question of Catholic Emancipa- tion. After Relief Bills were vetoed in 1821 and 1825, the Catholic Emancipation Act was finally passed in 1829. The Act allowed Catholics to participate in Parliament and to occupy most public offices. In 1850, the outlawed Church was allowed to establish the archdiocese of Westminster, despite the cry against "Papal Aggression" throughout En- gland. For discussions of anti-Catholic novelists of the Victorian period, see my articles on Charlotte Bronte, George Eliot, and Charles Dickens. 2. Shelley especially condemned the Roman Church for encouraging superstition during the plague of 1837, leading the population to remain in Rome in expectation of miraculous delivery. See Rambles 2: 236-237. She denounces dependency on the Church a few pages later: "From the Pope to the lowest priestly magistrate, all live on the public revenues, whence springs a system of clients, which existing principally in Rome, yet extends over the whole of the papal dominions, and creates a crowd of dependants [sic] devoted to the clergy" (246). 3. See the treatment of superstition in "The Dream," and of oppressive convents in "The Brother and the Sister" and "The Heir of Mondolfo," all in Collected Tales. 4. The novels Shelley published after Frankenstein were Valperga (1823), The Last Man (1826), Perhn Warbeck (1830) and Lodore (1835). Shelley's novella, Mathilda (ed Elizabeth Nitchie), was not published until 1959. Her travel book describing France, Switzerland, Germany, and Holland was published in 1817, the book describing Germany and Italy in 1844. Most of her short fiction appeared in magazines like The Keepsake between 1824 and 1 839. Her two volumes on the Lives of the Most Eminent Literary and Scientific Men of Italy, Spain and Portugal appeared in 1835 and 1837, the volume on men of France between 1838 and 1839. Of her novels beside Frankenstein, only The Last Man was reprinted in this century (1965) until the 1996 reprinting of Valperga by Woodstock Books. It will be published in a new edition by Stuart Curran this year. Her collected stories were published in an edition by Charles Robinson in 1976. The Novels and Selected Works of Mary Shelley (8 volumes, ed Nora Crook) appeared in 1996. Recent editions of Shelley's journals and letters are cited</page><page sequence="17">MICHAEL SCHIEFELBEIN 75 in this essay. She also published two editions, with invaluable commentary, of the poetry of her husband Percy Bysshe Shelley, contributing in no small way to his place among the great Romantic poets. 5. Early examples are Muriel Spark's Child of Light: A Reassessment of Mary Wollstonecrqft Shelley (1951) and the first biography to use Shelley's newly released original papers, Elizabeth Nitchie's Mary Shelley, Author of Frankenstein (1953), More recent examples are Anne Mellor's Mary Shelley: Her Life, Her Fiction, Her Monsters (1988) and Emily Sunstein's Romance and Reality (1989), both cited in this essay. 6. An important study affirming the critical status of the ever popular Frankenstein is The Endurance of Frankenstein (1979), edited by George Levine and U.C. Knoepflmacher. Perhaps the most well-known feminist treatment of Frankenstein is that of Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar in The Madwoman in the Attic (1979). Another is Mary Poovey's The Proper Lady and the Woman Writer. Ideology as Style in the Works of Mary Wollstonecrqft, Mary Shelley and Jane Austen (1984). 7. Anne Mellor's work examines both dimensions of Shelley. See also the essays in part 1 of The Other Mary Shelley: Beyond Frankenstein [\WS) edited by Audrey Fisch, Anne Mellor, and Esther Schor; and Pamela Clemit's The Godwinian Novel: The Rational Fictions of Godwin, Brockden Brown, Mary Shelley (1993). 8. Jane Blumberg's 1993 study of the early novels of Shelley, including Valperga, is a recent example cited in this essay. The Other Mary Shelley: Beyond Frankenstein also includes two essays on Valperga. 9. Shelley's husband, Percy Bysshe Shelley, described the events of Valperga in a letter to a prospective publisher: "[Gastruccio] was a little Napoleon, and, with a dukedom instead of an empire for his theatre, brought upon the same all the passions and errors of his antitype. The chief interest of his romance rests upon Euthanasia, his betrothed bride, whose love for him is only equalled by her enthusiasm for the liberty of the republic of Florence which is in some sort her country, and for that of Italy, to which Gastruccio is a devoted enemy, being an ally of the party of the Emperor. Euthanasia, the last survivor of a noble house, is a feudal countess, and her castle is the scene of knightly manners of the time"(as quoted in Blumberg 83). Despite her love for Castruccio, Euthanasia refuses to marry a tyrant and reluctantly agrees to join forces against him. Her benevolent sovereignty over her peasant subjects is answered by their loyalty. Many of them die as they unsuccessfully resist the invading Castruccio, who strips his former love of her power and destroys her castle, Valperga, where he used to court her. In the end of the novel she dies at sea on her way to exile. During his campaigns, Gastruccio has also managed to ruin the emotionally unstable prophetess, Beatrice. Abandoned after his seduction of her, Beatrice flees to Rome where she is imprisoned and sexually abused by a priest. Returning to Florence, she finds a protector in Euthanasia, who, learning that Castruccio has played a part in her distraught condition, tries to teach Beatrice to conquer her wild imagination and emotions with reason. Ultimately, however, Beatrice cannot resist her feelings for Castruccio. They lead her into the hands of a sorceress, who vows to help her win him back. Using Beatrice for her own ends, the sorceress finally murders her with poison. 10. Euthanasia's central role lead Shelley to change the original title ol the novel from Castruccio, Prince of Lucca, to Valperga: or the life and adventures of Castruccio, Prince of Lucca. 1 1 . William Walling reaches such a conclusion in Mary Shelley. See his comment on page 60.</page><page sequence="18">76 Religion &amp; Literature 1 2. In Rambles, for example, Shelley notes, "the soul is elevated and rapt by the sublime hymns to heavenly love, contained in the Paradiso. Nothing can be more beautiful than the closing lines . . . which speak of his return to earth, his mind still penetrated by the ecstacy he had lately felt" (1:96). 1 3. In chapter 2 of Lost Saints, Looten discusses at length the Marian conceptualization formulated in nineteenth-century England, exploring the way in which it essentially silenced women authors by annihilating their authority as participants in the flesh and blood world of sexual, social, and political realities. 14. Wollstonecraft actually saw herself in a better position than that of men for asserting moral authority. As Stuart Curran notes in his essay "Women readers, women writers," Wollstonecraft and Helen Maria Williams both saw themselves as "citizens of the world" who, unable to vote or participate in political decisions affecting the fates of countries, could speak with the necessary necessary about the need for representative government after the events of the Reign of Terror in France. Curran concludes, "Their dual assumptions - that the sole power women can claim comes from the pen, and that only the disinterested can wield moral authority . . . have informed the polemical stance of women well into the modern age" (186). 15. One person who, according to Shelley, embodied the charity of the Catholic Church was Pascal. See Rambles 3: 234-35. 16. An example of her fervor is this prayer written in her journal: "Oh You supreme Power - you who may reign here - who may watch over here - to whom I bow - if it is your will that I may die during this year - behold me ready to obey your commands that will call me from this prison to the shining atmosphere that you inhabit" (December 31, 1827). This translation from the Italian is provided by the editors of the Clarendon edition of The Journals of Mary Shelley. 17. In Shelley's letter to Jane Williams, April 22, 1823, she refers to a conversation in which Byron, noting an increase in her piety, asked her whether she was turning Chris- tian. She answered that she was not, but if she were she would not be "religious." All quoted letters of Shelley are taken from The Letters of Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley, edited by Betty T. Bennet. Hereafter, only the letter's date will appear in the text. la. 1 he original ot John Sinclair s translation reads: Cosi la mente mia, tutta sospesa, mirava fissa, immobile e attenta, e sempre di mirar faciesi accesa. A quella luce cotal si diventa, che volgersi da lei per altro aspetto e impossibil che mai si consenta; (canto 23, 97- 102, in Sinclair 482) 19. This manuscript essay can be found in appendix A of Jane Blumberg's Mary Shelley's Early Novels. Blumberg offers an enlightening discussion of it in chapter 2. 20. Muriel Spark describes Shelley s love for Jane Williams as "obsessional" (99). Mary had an emotional breakdown when she learned that her friend had spread rumors that, just before his death, Percy Shelley lavished attention on Jane because of the depressed Mary's cold treatment of him. Later, friends like John Trelawny and Leigh Hunt accused her of betraying her liberal husband when she edited possibly scandalous portions of his works and made other publishing decisions to avoid public shame. A social outcast during</page><page sequence="19">MICHAEL SCHIEFELBEIN 77 her unconventional life with her husband, Mary longed for acceptance in her later years, both for her sake and that of her only surviving child, Percy. 21. Shelley's impressive scholarship began in her early years under her father's tutelage. She read history, the Latin and Greek classics, Shakespeare, Milton, and the major European poets. In her description of these early studies, Emily Sunstein notes that "Mary probably had at least as fine an education as any girl in England" (40). Her voracious appetite for reading only grew during her years with Shelley. Her reading list of 1815 alone includes among its thirty-three entries Gibbons' History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Ovid's Metamorphoses in the original Latin, and Rousseau's Confessions. See volume 1 , pages 88-89 of The Journals. 22. The same might be said for members of the Broad Church movement, indebted to intellectuals like Coleridge. 23. Krueger emphasizes that, in their writing, women reformers challenged patriarchy by means of the very Bible that was evoked in justifying its authority, thereby "calling on male readers to repent" (6). A similar claim can be made for Mary Wollstonecraft, who appealed to reason to justify attributing it to women. The same sort of rationale explains Shelley's appropriation of Catholicism's discourse on faith and intellect, discussed below, even as she attacks the oppressive patriarchy of the Roman Church. 24. The reading of scripture was seen as an activity requiring no lormal training. As Krueger notes, "Evangelicals believed scripture to be radically accessible. Attacking the mystification of scripture that demanded of 'legitimate' readers expertise available to a select few, they maintained that God would reveal to babes what he concealed from the wise" (8). 25. Percy Bysshe Shelley used Mary's transcription of a history of Beatrice Cenci, which she found in the archives of Palazzo Cenci in Rome. As Mary notes in her 1839 preface to the play in The Poetical Works of Percy Bysshe Shelley, The Cenci, whose fifth act she praised, was the only one of her husband's works that she discussed with him during composition. See volume 2, pages 272-76 of Poetical Works. 26. James Rieger uses this term on page 178 ol "bhelley s Fatenn Beatrice. In this essay, Rieger identifies Sismondi's Histoire des Republiques Italiennes du Moyen Age as a source common to The Cenci (\8\9) and Valperga. 27. Conversely, Blumberg argues that Mary Shelley presents in Euthanasia a critique of inflexible idealism, that the Countess of Valperga is as obsessed with principles as Castruccio is with power and both kinds of obsession are destructive. Blumberg bases this conclusion on Euthanasia's resemblance to Mary's husband whose own inflexible idealism Mary could not accept. However, I find no evidence in Valperga itself or in any remarks made by Shelley about her novel that Euthanasia is intended to be seen as anything but heroic. And, as Emily Sunstein asserts - though she also claimsthat Euthanasia idolizes principles - "Mary Shelley neverdiscarded the Godwininian assumption that to be conquered by emotion is to have failed" (190).</page><page sequence="20">78 Religion &amp; Literature WORKS CITED Alighieri, Dante.
