<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW subject the opinions expressed in this essay to a searching investi- gation because I, in common with so many others, have a high regard for M. Friedmann's achievements in all fields connected with the history and elucidation of Jewish literature. LUDWIG BLAU. Budapest. RATNER'S "SEDER OLAM RABBAH." finn 5W1 "TD, Die grosse Weltchronik. Nach Handschriften und Druck- werken herausgegeben und mit kritischen Noten und Erkldrungen versehen, von B. RATNER. (Wilna, I897.) I NOTICED some time ago in this QUARTERLY (J. Q. R., VII, 348) the excellent introduction by Herr Ratner. I am happy to see now the text of this ancient chronicle, edited by the same author, with the variants of the MSS. and quotations from Talmudic litera- ture. These supply the variations of the Munich MS. of the Talmud, which we could not furnish for the text of the Seder Olam in the Mediaeval Jewish Chronicles, II, pp. 26-67. Herr Ratner has thus filled up a lacuna, besides adding many quotations from printed books, bearing upon our subject. I should have liked to see a table of abbreviations of the titles of the works quoted, which many readers will find a difficulty in deciphering, more especially as Ratner's work will remain for a long time the standard edition. Perhaps a table of abbreviations might be published separately. BACHER'S "EXEGESIS OF MAIMONIDES." Die Bibelexegese Moses Maimtni's, von Prof. Dr. WILHELM BACHER, Budapest, I896. (Jahresbericht der Landes-Rabbinerschule, I895- I896.) PROF. BACHER is indefatigable; his minimum yearly production is a volume of essays or the equivalent. The present monograph of 176 pages is an instalment of the programme for the year I89I-I892, with the title of Die Bibelexegese der jiidischen Religionsphilosophen des Mittelalters vor Maimi4ni. Both are interesting by themselves, as well as separately; it is to be hoped that it will be continued some other time, so as to have the subject complete. Our author is well known for accuracy in his statements, depending on texts and expanding them until the meaning comes forth by itself. He calls as his witnesses the very words of Maimonides, be it in Arabic or in Hebrew, for Prof. Bacher is master of both languages. By this learned method Maimonides' exegesis, if we may call it so, becomes 740</page><page sequence="2">CRITICAL NOTICES palatable in its mystico-philosophical garb. The matter is comprised in the following chapters:--(I) the study of the Bible; (2) allegorical exegesis; (3) anthropomorphic expressions in the Bible; (4) the different rules of exegesis; (5) the exegesis of the Midrashim; (6) that of the Targums; (7) explanation of words, viz. the synonyms, homonyms and metaphors, verbs and their derivatives, &amp;c.; (8) the names of God; (9) angels; (Io) prophecy and the prophets; (II) the theory of visions; (I2) miracles, the revelation on Sinai; (I3) Divine providence, free-will; (I4) the biblical commandments, and the reasons for them; (I5) the biblical narratives; (I6) on Gen. i; (I7) on Ezek. i; (I8) on the book of Job; (I9) explanation of special passages of the Bible; (20) the Hebrew language, and the language of the Mishna; (21) sources of Maimonides' philology and exegesis, supposed exegetical writings by him. The last two chapters are the sections which will be most useful to students of the Hebrew language. The reference to other exegetes and grammarians is exhaustive, and very valuable for those interested in Jewish theology as it appears in the Bible. The style is clear and concise, a rare talent possessed by Prof. Bacher. The subject is thoroughly treated and, I believe, in a lasting manner, so that this study of Maimonides will remain for generations. Prof. Bacher has now supplied the preface to the Dalalat, which Munk intended to write if he had lived out his time. I congratulate the author on having satisfied a want. HEBREW WRITINGS IN AMERICA. I. RABBINIC literature was transplanted to America by my lamented friend, Dr. A. Kohut. Besides his own monographs on Yemen MSS. (see J. Q. B., III, p. 620, and V, pp. 338 sqq.), he stimulated Dr. Mar- golis to follow him (J. Q. R., V, pp. 340 sqq.). I am happy to state that the tradition will continue, and, curious to say, even American immigrants are carrying on the practice of writing in Hebrew. The following monographs reached me by the kindness of the authors :-(a) Concerning the biography of Leon (Judah) Modena, by Nehemiah Samuel Libowitz, with the title of rVII, i'"rN ,m'1', i5 121 r nlt'1: (Wien, I896); (b) additional notes by the well-known M. Friedmann, by Judge Sulzberger in Philadelphia; (c) by Dr. H. Brody, Berlin, edited by the author of (a), Newark, New York. 2. The well-known traveller, E. Deinard, issued a catalogue of MSS. and books in the possession of Judge M. Sulzberger, mentioned above (Newark, 1896). No. 9 of the MSS. is the 11t Vn10, of which it is not yet certain if it is another redaction of the 5rl n TD. 74I</page></plain_text>
