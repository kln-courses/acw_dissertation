I am not a farmer, if a farmer is one who makes a living working with soil and animals. I am, I admit, an academic - a college professor. As a professor, I have the opportunity - the privilege, really - to spend many hours learning from books, students, and colleagues. Books and people have often inspired me, sometimes even transformed me. Lately, however, inspiration and change have come from an unexpected source: my three bantam hens. In this essay, I consider this new avenue of learning and growth. While reading these reflections, you may think I am writing metaphori- cally or symbolically. But I am not. I write as a literalist. The chickens are not representing something else. Indeed, I am not even writing about chickens in general, as a species or a kind. I am writing about my chickens: particular creatures that inhabit a specific place in Poughkeepsie, New York, that eat my table scraps, that provide ma- nure for my garden and eggs for my consumption. Grace is always particular, or at least is experienced in the particular. So is suffering. And both usually show up close to home. "Close to home" is the loca- tion of my chickens and a topic of this essay. I I The French philosopher Simone Weil understood much about the ne-</page><page sequence="2">200 ISLE cessity and autonomy of nature. The beauty of the world gives us an intimation of its claim to a place in our heart. In the beauty of the world brute necessity be- comes an object of love. What is more beautiful than the action of gravity on the fugitive folds of the sea waves, or on the almost eternal folds of the mountains? (128-9) With these words, Weil identifies as an object of love and beauty that which many have cursed and have tried to subdue: the autonomy of nature, and its mechanisms of necessity. It almost seems natural to want to command nature at every joint and juncture; yet perhaps it is equally natural for us to delight in nature's independence. I have experienced both desires for my chickens - the desire to control and to concede. Regardless of my desire, however, I cannot radically control them. They have helped me confront a powerful illusion: the belief or attitude that I am at the center of nature, and that I have the power to command it. This is no mean lesson; few can learn it from words alone. Hence the importance of owning chickens. My chickens obey their nature perfectly, and for our association to proceed smoothly I, too, must respect their nature. If I fail to provide fresh water, or if I am remiss in feeding them, they may survive, but they will not produce eggs. If I neglect to open their coop in the morn- ings, they will eventually die of coccidiosis; if I forget to close the coop in the evening, the fox is sure to get them. I want my chickens to stay safe and secure in "the run" - a plot of ground, surrounded by a four- foot high, fifty-foot long fence, in which they spend much time scratch- ing and pecking the soil for weed seed, worms, and other nourish- ment. Inside the run I want them to remain, yet they often do not. Lorenza mostly, but sometimes Anna, insists on flying out of the run in search of promising, new feeding grounds. I can put netting over the top of the run; that would probably keep them in. But my bantam chick- ens are good flyers, especially Lorenza. They like to fly, and part of me, I confess, wants to let them fly - right out of the run. I enjoy the sight of my chickens exploring my backyard. Besides, if a fox does manage to penetrate the fence and enter the run, my chickens can, in theory, escape by flying up into a tree. With netting overhead, they would be trapped and easy prey. Nevertheless, if my chickens spend too much time outside the run, a fox - or a dog - could ambush and kill them. The best plan is not entirely clear to me. Yet I know this: whatever I do, I cannot altogether command my chickens or the fox. They remain largely outside my will, my power. I can erect fences, tell my chickens "stay," set a Havahart trap for the fox. Ultimately, however, I cannot master them. They have their own nature; their will is not an extension</page><page sequence="3">On the Importance of Owning Chickens 201 of mine. I only deceive myself and cause harm when I think or act otherwise. Sometimes, my chickens come up on the deck and watch me read and write, and encourage me to provide them with table scraps. Often I ac- commodate them. I worry, however, about why I enjoy them on the deck. What is the nature, and the consequences, of my desire for them to enter the world of my deck, my morning routine, my daily reading and writ- ing? I like my chickens, and I enjoy their showing some signs of liking me. I pretend that they come to my deck because they want to greet me, spend time with me. Often when I feed them, I hold out my arm and encourage each chicken to alight on it and eat from my hand. Such inti- macy I enjoy. Yet what is the cost? Lorenza, the wildest of these bantam hens, is the most independent, the best flyer, and the least willing to eat from my hand. She is also the one that has consistently flown into high trees every time a fox has approached the run. Luisa and Anna, in con- trast, simply looked at the fox last time it appeared, as Lorenza flew to safety. If my wife had not spotted that fox, what would have happened to my tamer and more domesticated Luisa and Anna? I must reconsider my earlier statement about the autonomy of na- ture. We can - more or less, depending on the circumstances - enter nature, engage with nature, even change nature. This recognition is important, for it recommends that we exercise caution when we inter- act with nature (and we always, ineluctably, do and must interact with nature). Simone Weil wisely held that loving nature entails relinquish- ing the illusion that we control it and that it revolves around our de- sires. But now I suspect she also means something else. Love requires renouncing not only our imaginary control, but, in some cases, our actual power to shape - if not control - the natural order. I understand now that I can, to some extent, change my chickens. They are not as independent as I thought. Nor am I. Given our capacity to alter nature, does caution require that we at- tempt to stay out of nature's way insofar as possible? That, too, is a sign of illusion - the illusion that humans are not part of nature, that we do not necessarily dwell there. We must count ourselves in: we, too, are creatures whose home is nature. The attempt to separate our- selves from nature is the opposite of placing ourselves at its center. It is nevertheless an illusion, and perhaps an equally dangerous one. Many environmentalists of good will dedicate their lives to what they under- stand as protecting nature, namely, protecting vast, pristine wilder- ness areas from human activity. Yet as long as we maintain a vision that separates humans from nature, we will fail to live peaceably and responsibly as natural creatures with other creatures within nature's vast and intricate weave of liquids, gases, and solids.</page><page sequence="4">202 ISLE When I survey my backyard, I delight in the beauty of the clearing and the woods, the blossoms that float downward like snow, the lin- gering rain drops on new leaves that glimmer as clouds part, and the wet, dark tree trunks that partition, perfectly, the pale green growth of early spring. I see also the old stone wall that now separates the clear- ing from the woods - evidence of humans. Yes, the yard has been cleared of trees, and my woods are second generation growth. Their existence has been shaped by humans, even as they have shaped hu- man existence and continue to. My backyard informs much of who I am. So do my chickens. There they are - practicing their dance, hold- ing their heads high while their feet scratch the soil under them, then suddenly, skillfully, gracefully they take two steps back and plunge their beaks into the earth, feeding themselves and combing the soil. There they are - Luisa and Anna inside the run, behind the fence, and Lorenza outside, foraging. Is Lorenza in nature, while Luisa and Anna are fenced out of it? Has my naming Lorenza taken even her out of nature? (But we name mountains and stars. A sign of hubris, or our longing to be at home in a world and universe larger than ourselves?) I must rethink my initial statements about the autonomy of nature. Nature does operate by its own laws, its own necessity. An aspect of that necessity, however, is an interdependence that permeates its vast ecological systems, as they are called. Yet the metaphor "systems," here, betrays them. Systems are mostly discrete. Nature, while law-abiding, is fluid, organic, interwoven in the most blatant and subtle ways. And humans cannot escape this measureless, ornate weave. What could it possibly mean to elude the natural meshes in which we "live and move and have our being"? Would we deny gravity? Stop drinking - or mak- ing - water? Deny enzymes entry into our bodies? Refuse the sun's warmth? Whether we live in the city or the country or in between, we deceive ourselves if we think nature exists where we don't. The first lesson my chickens have helped me to grasp is the illusion that we are at the center of nature and that we can radically control it; the second lesson, as I am beginning to understand it, is the illusion that we can exist outside nature. Together, the two lessons suggest this: nature is an interdependent engagement of diverse habitats and autonomous creatures, including humans. My chickens, then, are autonomous be- cause they maintain their own nature, their own instincts, and they flourish or flag under conditions specific to that nature; they are inter- dependent because they influence and are influenced by the diverse resi- dents of their habitat, their home. I belong to their home, and they belong to mine. To put the point differently, we share a home, even if we use it differently This view can be broadened to include all crea- tures and habitats, for ultimately, the earth is a shared home. Simone</page><page sequence="5">On the Importance of Owning Chickens 203 Weil and my chickens, then, have taught me much. They have taught me about the ways of autonomy and interdependence in nature. What might this mean for me? Perhaps I can see a bit differently. For example, perhaps I can see a bird and be struck by a reality that exists apart from me and, at the same time, acknowledge the sun and soil and water that we share. Perhaps the next time I am tempted to use pesticides on my plants or Drano in my pipes, I'll think about the shared home and how other creatures, which otherwise live quite apart from me, are affected by me. Perhaps I'll think differently. Weil notes that "being seems to us less and less concentrated the farther it is removed from us" (159). What if distance could be reduced by thinking about our backyards differently? If we see the land around our home - our house, our apartment building, our dormitory - as shared, perhaps we can eventually grasp anew the significance of the cliche, "it's a small world," and begin to concede and respect the reality of other homes, other habitats, far away. Our backyards, the view and habitat outside our windows, have much to teach us. My chickens have brought my attention to my backyard. And paying attention is a skill chickens can help us develop. "The most important part of education - to teach the meaning of to know (in the scientific sense)" (Fiedler xi). This is the last sentence Simone Weil wrote, two days before her death. What can it mean? Why is a religious philosopher and social activist, on her death bed, think- ing about to know, in the scientific sense? Perhaps because such knowl- edge requires giving attention to something outside oneself. When in- vestigating, say, the mechanism of protein transport within the cell, you must pay attention to the cells, as if listening carefully to them, through long, countless hours of experimentation, accurately record- ing data, carefully insuring that the experiments are sound, and so on. Under these conditions, you have no time to think of yourself, and there is no reason to think of yourself - you are concentrating on the cell. You lose yourself in the cell. Or, to put it another way, paying attention allows the cell to come into your life, to have an effect on you. It penetrates you. To attempt to know something, in the scientific sense, is to learn how to wait . Being attentive, you wait for the proper time to add a new batch of cells, to run the next experiment. For your results you wait. You cannot rush the experiment, no matter how much you would like to. It is completely out of your control. The cells are indifferent to your schedule, your plans for the evening. You must wait.</page><page sequence="6">204 ISLE "The most important part of education - to teach the meaning of to know (in the scientific sense)." If you know something about knowing, you know that there is much you do not know. When you struggle with some slice of science, you confront how much there is to learn, and you gain an opportunity to become acutely aware of your limita- tions. "Know how to be ignorant," Rousseau advises. If we acknowl- edge our inexperience or lack of knowledge in the face of a particular problem or quandary, we begin to formulate genuine questions and seek assistance. We can also escape some pride. Lessons in paying attention, waiting, and humility can be gained by owning chickens. Knowing in the scientific sense need not be confined to the work of the professional scientist. We can all be scientists, if sci- ence is the art of careful observation. I spend much time observing my chickens. I have become familiar with their habits, their likes and dis- likes, and their individual temperaments. They have no interest in my coffee grinds, little in orange peels or potatoes, and much in all the other table scraps that I used to put in the trash. In the early morning they usually stay in the run; by mid-morning they have escaped the run and are scratching and digging near the house; in the afternoon they wander deep into the woods, and in the evening, if they are not fed, they are on the deck, eager to remind me of their second and last daily feeding. I could add more detail to this sketch of their schedule, but that would mainly portray the variability of their habits, or more likely, how much I still have to learn. For I suspect that if I understood my chickens better, variability in habits would appear more like pre- dictable, appropriate responses to such changing circumstances as rain, wind, season, supply of grubs, presence of predators, or variation in my routine. I still have much to learn about paying attention. I may want to lead Lorenza into the garden to prepare the soil, but if she is in the nesting box to lay an egg, I must wait. My chickens may remain in the nesting box for as long as two hours or more, and during that time, they pay no attention to me. Laying the egg becomes their sole concern. I learn about waiting, as I watch them anticipate and wait, infallibly. Waiting is a component of their duty, their nature - their dharma, if you will. Vocation, duty, and life are united and executed perfectly as my chickens wait to lay. By observation, I have learned much about my chickens. There remains much, however, that I still do not know. I do not know why they take dust baths; I do not know if the mourning doves that sometimes eat beside them can introduce viruses or bacteria against which they have no immunity; I do not know what feed is best for them, and why they sometimes stop laying eggs for a week or two and then resume; I do not know the best - the safest and kindest - way to leave them if I must be away for a weekend. There is</page><page sequence="7">On the Importance of Owning Chickens 205 much I do not know. I have consulted books, and have profited from them. A year ago, I knew nothing about chickens, and books were my first instructors. But now I prefer to consult people who have had ex- perience with chickens. For as my questions become more specific, I require people who inhabit traditions of practical knowledge and who can apply them to the vicissitudes of circumstance. There is another feature of the process of knowing, in the scientific sense, that I am obliged to mention. It is deeply satisfying. To watch and study my chickens is pleasant, even salutary. Can I explain this even to myself? In part, the satisfaction springs from observing au- tonomous creatures. I am less likely to study my chickens closely when we are interacting, for example, when I am feeding them or when they are perched on my arms. When I am with them, I do not watch them with great attention. Perhaps there is not enough distance. But when they are on their own, say, in the woods, I watch them closely, and I enjoy seeing them perform in the wild flawlessly and autonomously. Learning and admiration come together, in observation. And remark- ably, seeing them do their job well encourages me to do mine well, with skill and attention. i v My chickens encourage self-transformation. This is extraordinary. Humans often seem immutable. Chickens, however, can assist the self to change (and hence I suppose that most anything or anyone, if given proper attention, can effect such change). I write "self-transformation," because the self is the object of change as well as the agent of change. Yet the self does not change itself by itself alone. We change as we encounter and respond to something outside ourselves - neighbors, for example, or books, family members, pepper plants, community groups, or chickens. Transformation, then, requires at least two condi- tions: attentiveness, on the part of the self; and grace, that is, some- thing outside the self that assists the self. My chickens, I am suggest- ing, are an instrument of grace. They offer opportunities for change. This occurs variously. My chickens divert unhelpful self-regard. When I find myself consumed with engrossing self-interest, the chick- ens provide occasions to gain perspective. When this happens, I do not lose myself in sight of my chickens, rather I see myself and my prob- lems differently. Some problems disappear, like water vapor absorbed by a wide, dry sky; other problems remain, but appear differently, some- how made more clear and manageable. And I am different. My bur- dens lighten as my soul, if you will, becomes more solid, more deeply rooted in the ground which I share with the chickens and all other</page><page sequence="8">206 ISLE beings. I am, in a way specifiable, transformed. This gift can be attrib- uted, I suppose, to what I have already discussed: my chickens help to clarify and strengthen my connection to nature, to my home, to my environment. That environment, of course, includes humans, and my chickens have enhanced my bonds to human community. This, I realize, may surprise many, but my chickens have opened up my home to friends, neighbors, students, even strangers. There is some- thing innocuous and, apparently, irresistible about an invitation to come anytime and see the chickens. People don't call first; they just come. The greetings all take place outdoors, and the visits usually remain there. Water, wine, apples, and cheese may appear, but not usually; the visit may last from five to fifty-five minutes, but rarely more than an hour. It depends on the circumstances. These casual, low-expectation, no-preparation visits are something new at my home, and they are deeply satisfying. The chickens have also led me to deliberate encounters: I now seek out people who have experience with chickens, people who belong to such traditions of knowledge. This path, though intentional, has led me to unforeseen places - places of human flourishing. Those who talk to me about their chickens have, for example, introduced me to the world of private gardens and locally supported farms (Community Supported Agriculture), as well as to other such community groups as Scenic Hudson and Clearwater. They have also initiated me to the world of dance - community supported dances, in which old and young join together and entertain themselves without the help of Hollywood or cocaine (to name only two common American opiums). My chickens, then, have helped to transform my relation to nature and to community and have braided them snugly and pleasantly to- gether. All table scraps now go to the chickens, not to the trash bin or garbage disposal. The result: no garbage goes down my sink, and sig- nificantly less goes to the curb and into my community's landfill. The chickens consume what I used to consider refuse and convert it into fresh, rich manure. The result: my garden prospers, and I have lovely vegetables for my family and friends. In preparing the vegetables for a meal, I generate scraps, and these go back to the chickens. The result: I witness and experience the connectedness of life. The short thread which connects my food, chickens, garden, and community has been easily curled, the ends meeting gracefully. The result: an elegant, closed loop, to which I belong. As the connections between nature and community grow more vivid, I find myself thinking about how animals are treated by hu- man communities. In particular, I've been thinking about chickens and their relation to chicken - that yellowish meat wrapped in cello-</page><page sequence="9">On the Importance of Owning Chickens 207 phane. My chickens enjoy their daily routines; can this be said of the hundreds of thousands of chickens shut up all day in crowded, mecha- nized coops? To speak of chickens' enjoyment or distress is to sound terribly anthropomorphic, I know. Humans tend to cast everything - even other humans - in their own image. But I must use my language to speak about my chickens; I have no other. Moreover, I have evi- dence that my chickens enjoy their existence at my home. The chief testimony is negative: they complain bitterly when I thwart them from pursuing their gratifying routines. As I write this, they are below the front steps of the house taking their daily, mid-morning dust-bath. I suspect they like the fine dirt there, and perhaps the shade. In about five minutes, after their bath, they will dash to the back of the house and come by the chairs that support me and this lap-top computer; after a brief greeting (I usually stroke their backs) they will mount the old picnic table under the deck and groom themselves. This is when the routine begins to vary greatly. They may preen from five to thirty minutes; afterwards, they may leap down and scratch and peck, or head for the nesting box and lay, or clamber up the stairs and col- lapse as if dead on the deck in the sun. Now, by providing this brief description of my chickens' activities, I do not mean to suggest that they are self-consciously enjoying themselves, pinching themselves as they hum Armstrong's "it's a wonderful world." I am suggesting that my chickens have fashioned practices that fit their environment, my home, and that their pursuit of these practices is, if I may, satisfy- ing and fulfilling. By contrast, chickens kept in most industrial chicken farms have little opportunity to tailor and pursue their native prac- tices, because their environment is radically controlled to promote egg production or breast enhancement. Once you begin to care about some particular chickens, you find yourself concerned about other chickens and then about farm animals more generally. You also start to think about the controlled, oppressive environment in which many laborers work. Like chickens in mecha- nized coops, migrant and other workers have little freedom to fashion their practices in ways that bring satisfaction. Their relation to the land, to animals, to work is bent to maximize profits, not human flourish- ing. Revising Marx, such workers see neither themselves, nor the ani- mals, in their work; with supervisor watching, they see with constricted assembly-line vision a parade of disjointed commodities. Owning chickens can lead one to ask and wonder about little things, like grubs, but also about big things, like the dark face in the field. Who knows, the more we wonder, the more we might see and live differently.</page><page sequence="10">208 ISLE V To think about death is to wonder about the big things. I do not think it is wrong to kill an animal for food; it is wrong to mistreat an animal, including killing it shabbily, which is to say, without respect or knowl- edge. I glance at the end of my skimpy outline and I find, "Slaughter- ing the chickens." I thought I would discuss the prospect of killing, stewing, and eating my chickens when they became old. I thought that rather than bury them, I could show more respect by eating them: an- other curve in the loop. My outline and outlook, however, have been interrupted - shattered, really. Last week a fox killed Anna, one of my three chickens. My grief surprised me. Again, I was confronted with how little I know, especially about myself. The story of Anna's death. When I saw Luisa, the youngest, alone in the run frozen like a statue, with no sign of Anna or Lorenza, I ran outside and discovered a pile of feathers just outside the run. A bit further from the first pile, I discovered a second one. Two missing chick- ens, two piles of feathers - I concluded a fox got both. I searched for them, and then spent about three hours outside attempting to read, hoping that one or both might show up. Perhaps they got into a scrape and managed to escape, especially Lorenza - a good flyer with sound instincts. In the meantime, Luisa was distraught. When I first let her out of the run, she hurried to each of their favorite spots, searching for her companions, not pausing to scratch and peck. She then came to me, but when I tried to console her with some chicken feed, she would not eat (my chickens had never refused feed). When I left home to teach my courses, I was sure both Anna and Lorenza had been killed. That evening I returned and found Lorenza with Luisa forging near the drain pipes. My two chickens have changed some since the encounter with the fox. Both seem somehow chastened, certainly less adventuresome. Lorenza, who used to roam fearlessly into the woods, now stays close to home; and when Luisa sits in the nesting box, Lorenza stands by me, making soft, high pitch noises, as I read and write. In time, they will probably resume most of their old ways. As will I. Currently I am vigilant, overly cautious. Until I am satisfied with the safety of the run, I lock up my chickens in the coop if I am gone late afternoon or early evening. I have doubled the height of my run fencing from four to eight feet, and I will soon place netting over the top to prevent the chickens from escaping (Anna had flown out when the fox got her). I now exercise more control to protect my chickens, even if such secu- rity curtails their liberties. I have grown fearful. Shall I be angry at the fox? The fox performed its job perfectly. Foxes eat</page><page sequence="11">On the Importance of Owning Chickens 209 chickens. Like the warrior Arjuna in the Bhagavad-Gita, the fox's dharma is to hunt and kill. It is not mean or wayward but obedient to its nature. And what of Anna? I suppose she did her job, too - right up until the end. She flew out of the run in search of better feeding grounds; while eating, she probably sensed the fox and tried to escape, but foxes are faster, smarter, and stronger (a friend told me recently that a fox can broad jump fifteen feet from a standing position). And what of me and my duty? I need to do my job better. Perhaps if I had asked my friends more questions, I would have made the run more secure to keep my chickens from flying out in my absence. My duty is to keep the chickens and fox apart. Still I wonder, at what cost? How much control becomes too much? At what point does a safe place become a prison? When does my coop and run resemble an industrial chicken farm? I am still uncertain of my job. A satisfying exist- ence, for chickens and humans, entails risk. But what is the relation be- tween care, permitting risk, and preventing harm? By naming the chickens, have I become too attached and thereby impaired my judgement? If I had lost not Anna but an anonymous chicken, would I be more or less inclined to secure them excessively? More inclined, I would guess. By naming my chickens, by observing and caring for them as individual creatures, I find it difficult to hinder the native habits and tailored routines that bring them fulfillment. Their satisfaction, and mine, requires that I allow some hazard. The risk to myself is that it aches considerably more to lose a named than a name- less chicken; the risk to the chickens is evident. Never name a chicken if you do not want to suffer its loss. Never name a chicken if you are intending to lock it up all day in the coop. Back to the outline - "Slaughtering the chickens." The outline reaches a point beyond me. Like other plans, outlines only anticipate reality. The elemental issue here, death, makes me pause, and wonder. What do I know about killing an animal for food? Start with what I do know. Not long ago death and life were everyday affairs for all to witness and take part. Today the cellophane packaging is transparent, while the guts and death are hidden. Can I reach back and consciously participate in the inescapable fact, life requires death? Yet I wish Lorenza and Luisa a long, pleasant life; I would not kill them prematurely Prematurely! At what point do they become old enough - tottering, on the verge of death? - for me to slaughter and stew them? What is the proper con- duct? Let them die naturally? Either way, I will experience some loss. The issue should not be, however, how to avoid loss, but how to act appropriately. Lorenza and Luisa, my first chickens, are to my eyes pre- cious. Perhaps I can kill, dress, and eat my next round of chickens. I wrestle now not for a universal answer, just an honest one for myself. Yet even that is out of reach. I need more time to think about the relation</page><page sequence="12">210 ISLE between killing and eating, and about myself and my chickens. Every day I gather eggs. They are small, beige, and lovely. Eggs - a mundane miracle that works the hinge between life and death. When I collect the eggs, they are often warm, the recent fruit of the womb. Without a rooster, there is no promise of a chick, but the eggs nourish my life and that of my family and friends. These frail, unbending, re- plete, beige eggs stem from worms, weed seed, and table scraps. The elegant loop, once again, graceful and expectant. A deep sense of grati- tude, humility, and awe envelops me as I hold one of Lorenza's or Luisa's eggs. At that moment I thank them, I know there is greatness in the world, and I am lost, momentarily, in wonderment. I am not a farmer. I do not make a living working with soil and ani- mals. Yet for any of us, I believe, soil and animals can contribute to a good living, that is, to the art of living well. We tend to be unhappily consumed by life's logistical details - grocery shopping, committee meet- ings, car pooling, office work, house work. What if we could be happily occupied by the same activities? We hurry along life's time line, wish- ing we could stretch it, interrupt it, escape it. Time becomes an uneven, agitated beat. Where in the busy schedule is equanimity, composure? Thirty minutes of daily yoga? My chickens have encouraged me to think of equanimity as a tone, or a color, that saturates my day, rather than a brief appointment in a busy schedule. Aristotle and Aquinas maintained that the height of human happiness is found in contemplation. If they are correct, contemplation should not be understood exclusively as a private act performed in solitude. Otherwise, happiness borders too closely to loneliness and resides only on the edge of human existence. To be contemplative - thoughtful, attentive, aware - in the quotidian, in the everyday, is this not our aim? My chickens handle each task before them with industry, grace, and thoroughness. There is, I have been saying, much to learn from chickens. Some claim we inhabit a world increas- ingly dominated by an instrumental reason that imprisons us by a vast system of calculated, rationalized labor - Weber's iron cage. Perhaps. A latch is within reach, however. A way of escape. It may not land us in the promised land, but it does lead to a more promising place. We have some say. We can turn off the television, renounce hectic amusements, and discover the re-creation of good work: working well, working with care and patience, working toward excellence and joy. We can own two or three chickens, and learn much from them. Perhaps I am a farmer. I gather eggs, I harvest crops. If you make space for some tomato plants in your backyard or city apartment, you, too, can farm. And if you have a little spot for chickens, before you awaits opportunity for joy, learning, and eggs.</page><page sequence="13">On the Importance of Owning Chickens 211 NOTE 1.
