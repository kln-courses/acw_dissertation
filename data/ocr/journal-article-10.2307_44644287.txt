BELTFIT assesses any combination of anchorage locations, seat position, seat angles and stalk length. The program predicts the belt paths on selected wearers and checks them for comfort and safety. European manufacturers are already using BELTFIT to improve the belt layouts on their new vehicles. Further development of the program is in hand. THE WORLD-WIDE TREND towards safer cars has put pressure on manufacturers and legislators to improve the comfort, safety and convenience of seat belts. Legislation in Europe, Australia and the USA ensures that seat belts increase the safety of most wearers. Attention is now turning to the individuals for whom seat belts are uncomfortable or ineffective. A recent MIRA survey (1)* showed that 84% of UK seat belt wearers had complaints against their comfort or convenience. If the fit of belts could be improved, more people would wear them in greater safety. This would reduce road injuries and increase car sales to safety-conscious motorists. Where wearing is compulsory, there are moral as well as legal reasons for ensuring that belts are as safe as possible. Despite the close attention industry pays to seat belts, the need exists for a method of predicting how well a proposed installation will provide for the safety and comfort of potential wearers. In the past, manufacturers have designed seat belts to conform with legislation, making adjustments on the basis of empirical rules and wearer tests when the prototype body shell or seating buck is available. Although this technique "provides an acceptable solution, it can not produce the best possible answer since it does not allow the full range of dimensional possibilities to be explored. Changes to improve wearability may be proposed too late for critical body parameters to be changed. For these reasons, MIRA has developed BELTFIT, a predictive program for testing and improving seat belt layouts at the drawing board stage. This program allows the body designer and ergonomist to find the best compromise solution to suit the design brief, taking full account of the need for seat belts to be comfortable and safe. THEORETICAL BASIS FOR PREDICTING BELT FIT MIRA has for several years been developing computer-based techniques for predicting the path a seat belt follows across its wearer. The original method, due to Dr J A Searle, used the theory of developable surfaces (2) to derive belt paths over simplified human bodies assembled from cylindrical and conical surfaces. A computer program incorporating this theory was used in design studies by vehicle manufacturers. From experience of the first program, it became apparent that the limitation to simple geometrical shapes was unacceptable, because anatomical details can alter belt fit significantly. The new method introduced to solve this problem was based on the observation that a belt wearer shortens the webbing as far as comfort allows. This is true for the voluntary tightening of static belts as much as for the automatic action of inertia reels and passive systems. Since a correctly adjusted belt uses the least possible webbing, it follows that a minimum-length belt gives the correct fit. In theoretical terms this means that the prediction of belt fit can be formulated as a search for the shortest path over each body. This makes belt fitting an obvious candidate for numerical optimisation techniques. The task of finding the shortest path across a body is ideally suited to one type of optimisation known as 'dynamic programming'. *Numbers in parentheses designate References at end of paper. 2783 0096-736X/83/9103-2783$02.50 Copyright 1983 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">2784 D* SHEPPAW&gt; This technique, due to Bellman (3), proved capable of accommodating all the practical complexities of the belt fitting problem, including irregular body shapes that had defeated the earlier method. The dynamic programming formulation is a step-by-step search for the shortest path across a set of planar profiles defining the surface geometry of the body. It should be noted that, since deviations from the optimum path produce only small increases in belt length, the optimisation process needs to be very accurate. This imposes severe constraints on the search and curve-fitting procedures required by dynamic programming. Considerable research went into these aspects before a satisfactory procedure was developed. BODY SHAPES TO BE CONSIDERED No geometrically defined shape can precisely equate to the human body, especially in soft tissue areas such as the abdomen. Accepting this limitation, BELTFIT is based on three standard body shapes: the 50th percentile male, 95th percentile male and 5th percentile female. These bodies were adapted from the 'Golden Shell' anthropomorphic dummies using information provided by NHTSA. They have the great advantage of standardisation and relevance to legislation, and give repeatable results. These three bodies are intended to represent the average and the two extremes of the belt wearing population. In fact, few real people conform to the dummy dimensions in all respects. The infinite variability of human shape poses a wider problem, since it will never be possible to check the behaviour of every potential wearer. In the future BELTFIT will be expanded to include children and other subjects derived from the MIRA Anthropometric Survey of 2000 drivers (4). CRITERIA OF ACCEPTABILITY The criteria of acceptability for seat belt fit cover various aspects of comfort and safety. Some of them are commonsense rules such as making sure the belt does not fall off the shoulder, touch the neck or ride up over the abdomen. They also include the technical requirements of European and American legislation, much of which is difficult to check visually or experimentally. The following are some of the more important rules: 1. Fit on shoulder. The belt should neither touch the neck nor be outboard of the acromion. It should be a stable solution with no alternative fit off the shoulder. 2. Fit on chest. Many women find the belt uncomfortable unless it lies between the breasts and does not press on either of them. It is desirable that the belt should cross the centre-line of the chest at mid-sternum height. 3. Fit on hips. The belt should lie between the two extremes of riding over the abdomen and fitting over the thighs alone. The former may lead to submarining and abdominal injuries and the latter to excessive forward movement. 4. Buckle relative to hip. The buckle should lie behind the hip. 5. The belt must comply, for Europe, with EEC directive 76/115 and ECE Regulation 14 for belt angles and anchorage positions. 6. The belt must comply, for the USA, with FMVSS 209 and 210 for belt angles and anchorage positions. Selected comfort and safety criteria have been quantified so that the program can predict the acceptability of any given seat belt layout. BELTFIT AS A COMPUTER-BASED DESIGN TOOL BELTFIT has been written in ANSI Standard FORTRAN to make it portable. The development work was carried out on the Perkin-Elmer 3230 computer at MIRA, operating in time-sharing mode through Tektronix 4010 and 4051 graphics terminals with a Calcomp 1012 plotter. The major consideration in creating BELTFIT was to provide engineers in industry with a design tool they would want to use. This implied an emphasis on simple data and visual presentation, since designers prefer to deal with drawings rather than lists of numbers. Computer graphics have been used to present pictures anyone can understand at a glance. Where further information is required, the user can ask for pictures showing orthogonal and rotated isometric views of the body model. Selected pictures are transferred to the plotter or hard cppier to keep as a permanent record. To supplement the pictures, BELTFIT also prints a list of data, predicted paths and tests of acceptability. BELTFIT handles 3-point lap plus diagonal belts of static, inertia-reel or passive design and could be extended to other configurations if necessary. The engineer has to specify the following data for each run: a. Three-dimensional position of all three effective anchorages. b. Length of rotatable stalk on the inboard anchorage. c. Seat travel and location. d. Angle of seat cushion and seat back. e. Selection of wearers to be tested. f. Criteria against which the predicted fit will be judged. g. Whether the search for the diagonal belt path is free, on-shoulder or off-shoulder.</page><page sequence="3">THE BELTFIT PROGRAM 2785 EXAMPLES OF BELTFIT AS A PROGRAM The best way of illustrating BELTFIT as a design program is by the following examples: Figure 1 shows the installation in a well-known European hatchback with its seat at the rearmost position. For the 50th percentile male the fit is good although rather high on the chest according to the proposed amendment to FMVSS 208. The tick on the torso belt shows the first point of contact. Figure 2 shows the same car and seat position as Figure 1, but for the 95th percentile male. The fit is good. Figure 3 shows the installation in an Asian saloon, with the 50th percentile male and rearmost seat position. The belt almost touches the neck and is too high according to the FMVSS 208 zone. The upper anchorage is outside the area allowed by EEC legislation, and the lap belt rides over the pelvis. This is a very bad fit, and potentially unsafe. Figure 4 shows the same car as Figure 3, but for the 95th percentile male. The fit is just as bad. Figure 5 shows the same car as Figure 3, but for the 5th percentile female with the seat at the foremost position. The belt touches the neck and the lap belt rides up over the abdomen. This is also a very bad fit. It should be noted that the belt presses against the inside of her left breast, a common cause of discomfort among women. Figure 6 shows some research work MIRA has done on children wearing adult seat belts (5). The belt is in dangerous contact with the neck of this child of 6 with the seat in its rearmost position. Figure 7 shows the same car as Figure 6, but with the upper anchorage moved down to the lower edge of the allowable zone. The acceptable fit on the child of 3 suggests that it is possible to accommodate children in adult seat belts, provided that the upper anchorage can be adjusted. CONCLUSIONS The application of dynamic programming to the problem of predicting the shortest path across an irregular geometrical surface has led to a computer program for predicting seat belt fit. Intelligent application of this design tool will lead to seat belt installations that comply with legislation and are safe and comfortable. A NOTE ON FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS BELTFIT Version 1 is already being used by European manufacturers. Work will soon begin on an improved version of BELTFIT incorporating extra body shapes, new facilities such as seat outline and spinal articulation, and an automatic optimisation facility for positioning anchorages at the best positions within zones prescribed by the designer.
