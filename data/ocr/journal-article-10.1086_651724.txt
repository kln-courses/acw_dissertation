Temples thus often suffer the same fate as the cities in which they lie. In theory, however, they should not. Accord- ing to numerous Greek sources, at least, shrines and their contents ought to be treated with great carefulness and be respected as aßsula, safe from plundering and violence.1 As she hears that Troy has finally been captured by the Achaeans, Clytemnestra avows, “Now if  they keep clear of  guilt towards the gods of  the town—those of  the conquered land—and towards I wish to thank my colleagues and friends—Jean-Claude Buffle, Geoffrey Herman, Sabrina Inowlocki, Alessandra Lukinovich, and Philippa Townsend—who have all, at some point, read various versions of  this article and helped me improve it greatly.

Only may no mad impulse first assail the army, overmastered by greed, to pillage what they should not!”2 From Aeschylus and Herodotus onward, it is, in particular, the barbarian invaders (i.e., the Persians) who appear as paradigmatic wreckers of  temples. The “accidental” burning of  the city of  Sardis (and its temple) by the Ionian insurgents was turned by the Persians, writes Herodotus, into a “pretext for burning the temples of Hellas.”3 And, indeed, the suppression of  the Ionian rebellion was accom- panied by the almost systematic burning of  the Greek shrines of  Asia Minor.4 Soon after, “the barbarian” was to push toward continental Greece itself; at his approach, the gods “stream with sweat” as the Pythia fore- sees that “many a shrine of  the immortals he will deliver to terrible flames.”5 Without doubt, the burning down of  Athens’ acropolis by Xerxes and his innumerable troops made an indelible mark on Greek memory, so too the eventual defeat of  the Persians.6 Indeed, the Persians eventually had to pay the price for their “presumptuous pride and impious thoughts,” as the weeping ghost of  Darius in Aeschylus’s Persae proclaims: “For, on reaching the land of  Hellas, restrained by no religious awe, they ravaged the images of  the gods and gave their temples to the flames. Altars have been destroyed; statues of  the gods have been overthrown from their bases in utter ruin and confusion. Wherefore having evil wrought, evil they suffer in no less measure.”7 So too, in the words of  Themistocles, the victory of  the Athenians over “so mighty a cloud of  enemies” is not so much theirs as that of  the gods and heroes whose temples Xerxes and his troops had treated like random houses and whose images they had burned and overthrown.8 The arrogant king who wanted to turn the world into a single empire had neglectfully crossed a “limit of  toleration.” 2 Aeschylus, Agamemnon, trans.

As Bruce Lincoln has argued, the Persian rulers could legitimize the ruthless but nonetheless necessary destruction of  the Ionians’ temples through a powerful imperialistic ideology.9 As the rebellious Greeks had fallen victim to “the Lie,” it was only just that the Great king should take measures against them; and as their temples had sheltered the daivas (“demons”) that promoted “the Lie,” they too needed to be cleansed through fire.10 The Jews do not appear among the barbarians described at length in Herodotus’s Histories.11 Only after the conquests of  Alexander would they be “discovered” by Greek authors and mapped as yet another kind of “priestly sages of  the type the East was supposed to produce.”12 One of the first Greek authors to describe the Jews was Theophrastus, the dis- ciple of  Aristotle.13 In an otherwise lost treatise, On Piety—fragments of which have been preserved by the Neoplatonist philosopher Porphyry— Theophrastus mentioned the Jews as “philosophers by race” who “con- verse with each other about the deity” and who, at night, “make observa- tions of  the stars, gazing at them and calling on God by prayer.”14 In Theophrastus’s depiction of  the Jewish open-sky worship, we find no temple, no altar, and no images of  the gods. They were, however, “the first to institute sacrifice” and are thus opposed by Theophrastus to the Egyptians, “who are so far from slaying other animals, that they make the images of  these to be imitations of  the Gods.”15 More or less at the 9 Bruce Lincoln, Religion, Empire, and Torture: The Case of Achaemenian Persia, with a Postscript on Abu Ghraib (Chicago: University of  Chicago Press, 2007), esp. chap. 2. 10 On this see also Pericles Georges, Barbarian Asia and the Greek Experience: From the Archaic Period to the Age of Xenophon (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1994), 56–58. 11 Herodotus does mention, however, the “Phoenicians and the Syrians of  Palestine,” who have learned the practice of  circumcision from the Egyptians (Histories II,104).

Moses, according to Hecataeus, founded Jerusalem; once he had taken possession of  the country he insti- tuted its cult, legislation, and government; and did not make for his fol- lowers any “images whatsoever of  the gods . . . , being of  the opinion that God is not in human form; rather the Heaven that surrounds the earth is alone divine, and rules the universe.”17 As a “race of  philosophers,” the Jews, in this particular Greek per- ception, can stand together with the Indian Gymnosophists and also the Persian Magi.18 Diogenes Laërtius thus recalls that Clearchus of  Soli, another of  Aristotle’s pupils, made “the Gymnosophists to be descended from the Magi,” before adding that “some trace the Jews also to the same origins.”19 Diogenes mentions, moreover, with regard to the Persian Magi, that they “condemn the use of  images, and especially those who say that the gods are male and female,” and that according to the philosopher Dino, the name of  Zoroaster, “literally interpreted means ‘star-worshipper.’ ”20 As a matter of  fact, Herodotus had already reported that it was not the custom of  the Persians “to make and set up statues and temples and altars,” adding that “those who do such things they think foolish, be- cause, I suppose, they have never believed the gods to be like men, as the Greeks do; but they call the whole circuit of  heaven Zeus, and to him they sacrifice on the highest peaks of  the mountains; they sacrifice also to the sun and moon and earth and fire and water and winds. From the beginning, these are the only gods to whom they have ever sacrificed; 16 Hecataeus of  Abdera, apud Diodorus Siculus XL,3 (in Photius, Cod. 244; in GLAJJ, no. 11). The attribution of  the excerpt to Hecataeus has recently been the subject of  much debate; see Claudio Zamagni, “La tradition sur Moïse d’Hécatée d’Abdère d’après Diodore et Photius,” in Interprétations de Moïse, ed.

In Lysimachus’s account, however, it was because they were lepers “who took refuge in the temples and lived a mendicant existence,” 21 Herodotus, Histories I,131. 22 See, for instance, Plutarch, Life of Numa 8,13–14 (with regard to Rome); Varro, apud Augustine, City of God IV,31 (in GLAJJ, no. 72a); Strabo XVI,2,35–46 (in GLAJJ, no. 115).

The others agreed and when they had put these decisions into practice, they crossed the desert; despite considerable difficulties, they arrived in an inhabited country, where they maltreated the people and plundered and burned the temples (a ̊nqr∫pouÍ uÒbrÇzontaÍ kaμ ta; ¥era; sulΩntaÍ kaμ ejmprhvsantaÍ), and came to the territory now called Judea, where they founded a city and settled in it. The city was called ‘Hierosyla’ (ÔIerovsula) because of  their disposition, but later, when they had become powerful, they changed the name in time in order to avoid opprobrium, and called the city ‘Hierosolyma’ and themselves ‘Hierosolymites.’ ”30 To Lysimachus, so it seems, Jews have a peculiar “disposition” (diav- qesiÍ)—a hostile disposition—toward alien people and their temples, which they uÒbrÇzousin, “do violence to.” Lysimachus builds a fanciful etymology, linking the name of  Jerusalem, to the notion of  ¥erosulÇa, “temple-plundering”—a concept that can and will be extended to mean, more generally, “sacrilege,” the stealing and thus profanation of  things sacred (so too the Latin sacrilegium, which literally means “theft in a temple” comes to mean “profanation,” or “impiety”; or sacrilegus, i.e., “one who robs sacred objects,” “profanator”). Manetho, an Egyptian priest writing in the early third century BCE, also accused the Jews of  having plundered temples (¥erosulouÅnteÍ), among other impious acts, though on 28 Lysimachus, apud Josephus, Contra Apionem I,304–11 (in GLAJJ, no. 158). Not much is known about this Lysimachus, generally considered an Alexandrian mythographer of  the early first century BCE (cf. Stern, GLAJJ, 382). 29 Manetho, apud Josephus, Contra Apionem I,73–91; 228–52; Chaeremon, apud Josephus, Contra Apionem II,15–28. See the literature above in n. 25; also, with regard to the Egyptian ideological background of  these authors’ accounts of  the origins of  the Jews, see Jan Assmann, Moses the Egyptian: The Memory of Egypt in Western Monotheism (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1997) to whom we owe the concept of  “counter-history” in the specific con- text, and recently Youri Volokhine, “Des Séthiens aux Impurs: Un parcours dans l’idéologie égyptienne de l’exclusion,” in Borgeaud, Römer, and Volokhine, Interprétations de Moïse, 199–243.

Josephus has a cutting answer to Lysimachus’s etymological joke: “This fine man got so carried away in his insults that he did not realize that we Jews do not use the same word for temple plundering (¥erosule∂n) as do Greeks” (Josephus, Contra Apionem I,319). Anyone who would have vaguely heard of  the Jewish tradition regarding the conquest of  Canaan, however, would have noticed that it is indeed a story full of  violence.33 Josephus himself, in his Jewish Antiquities, recalls that Moses told the Jews waiting to enter the Promised Land to show no indulgence whatso- ever toward the “enemies” they should encounter there. He thus exhorted them to “overthrow their altars, and their groves, and whatever temples they have among them and to burn all such, their nation, and their very memory with fire.”34 To Josephus, however, this is not wanton violence but a necessary part of  the process of  taking possession of  the Promised Land. Thus Moses underlines that if  the Jews permit these enemy nations to live, they will “taste of  their manners” and thereby corrupt their “proper institutions.”35 This statement is consonant with the model we encounter in the biblical texts where we discover a conceptual framework within which the wreck- ing of  alien temples fits. As a matter of  fact, among the commandments given by Moses to the Hebrews regarding the conquest of  the Promised Land, one can find the repeated injunction to “utterly destroy all the places where the nations whom you shall dispossess serve their gods” (Deut. 31 On Manetho, cf. W. G. Waddell, Manetho (London and Cambridge, MA: Harvard Uni- versity Press, 1940); and Volokhine, “Des Séthiens aux Impurs.” 32 Manetho, apud Josephus, Contra Apionem I,237–50; 264–66. Erich S. Gruen, Heri- tage and Hellenism (Berkeley: University of  California Press, 1998), 65, suggested that Manetho’s account may in fact reflect a Jewish tradition regarding an Israelite assault on Egypt, as attested at least once in the writings of  the Jewish-Hellenistic author Artapanus (apud Eusebius, PE IX,27,21–22). It is, however, more likely to be an Egyptian reminiscence and a conflation of  the diverse Oriental invasions of  the first millennium BCE; cf. Yoyotte, “L’Égypte ancienne”; also Volokhine, “Des Séthiens aux Impurs”; and Philippe Matthey, “Récits grecs et égyptiens à propos de Nectanébo II: Une réflexion sur l’historiographie égyptienne,” in Le poison et l’oiseau, ed.

Dubois (Turnhout: Brepols, forthcoming). 33 See Gruen, Heritage and Hellenism, 67. 34 Josephus, Jewish Antiquities IV,192; according to the old but beautiful translation by William Whiston (1737), republished in The Works of Josephus (Peabody: Hendrickson, 1987). 35 Josephus, Jewish Antiquities IV,191. </page> <page sequence="8"> 28 Sacking Temples 12:2; also Exod. 23:24, 34:13; Num. 33:52; Deut. 7:5). According to Deuteronomy, the nations of  Canaan, “the Hittite and the Amorite, the Canaanite and the Perizzite, the Hivite and the Jebusite” fall under the rule of  herem, that is, they are to be “dedicated” to Yahweh; a ̊naqevmati in the Septuagint (Num. 21:2–3; Deut. 13:16, 20:17). In an early tradition con- cerning the conquest, preserved in the book of  Numbers, Israel makes the following vow to Yahweh before battle: “If  Thou wilt indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I dedicate their cities to anathema” (Num. 21:2). Most English translations of  the Bible render this a ̊naqematÇzw by “to utterly destroy.” Indeed, the anathema pronounced on the Canaanites implies that men, women, children, elders, and even the cattle be killed “with the edge of  the sword,” that the walls of  the city be razed to the ground, and, as we have seen, that their altars, temples, and images of  gods be smashed (e.g., Deut. 13:16, 20:13; Josh. 6:21, 8,24, 10:28–11:12–15). The best illustration of  such an anathema in the Bible is the capture of Jericho, as told in the sixth chapter of  the book of  Joshua. Such acts of  war, most obviously, are not a peculiar thing in antiquity, nor in more recent times.36 What is peculiar, however, is their precise codification in Deuteronomy. In a book on war and war rites in ancient Judaism, Christophe Batsch recently suggested that the biblical herem be compared with the Roman rite of  euocatio.37 As was mentioned, in antiquity, the sacra of  the enemy raise an important question in the con- text of  war: by virtue of  their sacred character, they may not be dealt with lightly. Indeed, the Roman rite of  euocatio—if  it was in truth ever per- formed—could serve as a good example of  such management of  the other’s sacra.38 Let us read Macrobius with respect to the matter: “It is well known that every city is under the protection of  some deity, and it is an established fact that it was the custom of  the Romans . . . by means of prescribed formula to call forth the tutelary deities of  an enemy city which they were besieging and now felt confident of  being able to take; either because they believed that unless they did so the city could not be taken after all or rather because, were the capture possible, they held it to be an offense against the divine law to make prisoners of  gods.”39 To Batsch, the biblical injunction of  herem could be understood as an analogous, although quite different way of  managing the enemy’s sacra and all that which has been contaminated by them: the only right and safe 36 With regard to the herem see Clifford Ando, The Matter of the Gods (Berkeley: Uni- versity of  California Press, 2008), 120–24. In general, see David El Kenz, ed., Le massacre objet d’histoire (Paris: Gallimard, 2005). 37 Christophe Batsch, La guerre et les rites de guerre dans le judaïsme du deuxième Temple (Leiden: Brill, 2005), esp. 443–46. 38 On euocatio see, recently, Ando, Matter of the Gods, 128–48. 39 Macrobius, The Saturnalia, trans.

Indeed, in his Jewish Antiquities, Josephus insists on that point, which another Mosaic instruction makes clear: “Let no one blas- pheme those gods which other cities esteem such; nor may anyone steal what belongs to strange temples; nor take away the gifts that are dedi- cated to any god.”41 Of course, once every temple had been “overthrown,” there could be none left to plunder in the Promised Land, and any temple that might be plundered (but should not be) could only be set outside the Promised Land’s boundaries: where other gods are “esteemed such.” And Josephus recalls that, indeed, there is in Judea “neither an altar nor a temple in any other city (but Jerusalem); for God is but one, and the nation of the Hebrews is but one.”42 Amid the rules regarding the herem of  the Canaanite nations in the Hebrew Bible can also be found the prohibition of  marriage with these “dedicated” people (Exod. 34:16; Deut. 7:3). The Torah repeatedly recalls that Israel is an elected people, the people God has chosen to be “his own possession out of  all the peoples who are on the face of  the earth” (Deut. 7:6). It is also “a kingdom of  priests and a holy nation” (Exod. 19:6) and, as such, must be maintained in a permanent state of  purity and “set apart” from the other nations.43 Thus, as was suggested by Josephus, the cleansing of  the Promised Land by the annihilation of  its former inhabitants along with their rites, altars, and temple is the only way to allow Israel’s preser- vation from any corrupting blending with the surrounding nations, a blend- ing that would lead to the neglect of  the exclusive worship of  Yahweh (e.g., Exod. 34:11–18; Deut. 7:4) and thus to the desecration of  the Israelites themselves. Such is, in any case, the theoretical discourse. Furthermore, in theory there should not be anyone left to be submitted to the herem in the so-called Promised Land. As the book of  Joshua recalls: “Joshua struck all the land, the hill country and the Negev and the lowland and the slopes and all their kings. He left no survivor, but he utterly destroyed all who breathed, just as Yahweh, the God of  Israel, had commanded” (Josh. 10:40).44 The problem could only arise if  the purportedly annihi- lated “aliens” were to come back. 40 Batsch, La guerre et les rites de guerre, 444. 41 Josephus, Jewish Antiquities IV,207. 42 Ibid., IV,201. 43 On the notion of  separation in the Bible, see the classic considerations of  Mary Douglas, Purity and Danger (London: Routledge, 1967). 44 One can, of  course, obviously encounter contrary statements in the Bible, e.g., in the book of  Joshua itself, see Josh. 15:63, 17:12, 23:4–7; see also Judg. 2:21–23, 3:1–2 passim. </page> <page sequence="10"> 30 Sacking Temples “When others arrived in their country and built temples and altars, they knocked them all down”: such are the words Josephus quotes from a treatise, “On the Jews” (Perμ ∆IoudaÇwn), that he attributes to Hecataeus of  Abdera, whom we already came across.45 In his Contra Apionem, Josephus quotes—apart from the “slanderers”—many other authors, notably Greek, who have referred to the Jews, since he wishes to dem- onstrate the antiquity and thereby the respectability of  the Jewish people. Among them comes “Hecataeus of  Abdera,” in whose purported treatise Josephus finds proof  that the Jews were held in high esteem both by Alexander the Great himself  and by his successor in Egypt, Ptolemy, son of  Lagus. Despite Josephus’s claims, the work he attributes to Hecataeus is today widely attributed to a Pseudo-Hecataeus, presumably an Egyp- tian Jew of  the late second century BCE, who wrote under the name of his famous predecessor an apology of  the Jews.46 It is to this Pseudo-Hecataeus that we owe the consideration that when- ever “aliens” came to the land of  the Jews and built altars and temples there, the Jews indeed “knocked them down” (katevskapton). Accord- ing to Josephus, the author of  these words even added “that it is right to admire them (the Jews) in such matters.”47 Such an assessment is, as John Barclay recalls, “unlikely to have emanated from the genuine Hecataeus”; furthermore, it is surprisingly welcomed by Josephus, who by and large tries to undermine the accusations of  hostility toward non-Jewish religious practices leveled against the Jews.48 There may be no clear-cut answer as to why Josephus provides his reader with such “evidence.”49 One may suggest that he is simply pleased to find such an understanding statement expressed by a “Greek” author; moreover, if  he agrees with the latter that, all in all, it was the “others” who were in the wrong, having built altars and temples where they should not have, it is they, in some sense, who have crossed a “limit of  tolera- 45 Josephus, Contra Apionem I,193. 46 Already in antiquity, as reported by Origen, the attribution of  the treatise to Hecataeus raised suspicion (Contra Celsus I,15). Only the fragments quoted by Josephus are extant, and they have been subject to much debate since the birth of  modern philology. In recent years, the case against their authenticity has been decisively made by Bezalel Bar-Kochva, Pseudo-Hecateus “On the Jews”: Legitimizing the Jewish Diaspora (Berkeley: University of  California Press, 1996). See also Carl R. Holladay, Fragments from Hellenistic Jewish Authors, Vol. 1, Historians (Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1983); Barclay, Against Apion, 338–40. For a different opinion, see Miriam Pucci Ben-Zeev, “The Reliability of  Josephus Flavius: The Case of  Hecateus’ and Manetho’s account of  Jews and Judaism: Fifteen Years of  Con- temporary Research (1974–1990),” Journal of Jewish Studies 24 (1993): 215–34. Josephus, nonetheless, was obviously not familiar with this debate and presumably did not know he was in fact quoting the pseudepigraphic work of  a Jewish author writing “in disguise.” 47 Josephus, Contra Apionem I,193. 48 Barclay, Against Apion, 112 n. 653; also Bar-Kochva, Pseudo-Hecateus, 97. 49 Barclay, Against Apion, 112 n. 653. </page> <page sequence="11"> History of Religions 31 tion.” Let us turn to Philo of  Alexandria to confirm this impression. In his Legatio ad Gaium, the Jewish philosopher recalls an interesting event with regard to our issue. In the winter of  39–40 CE, under the auspices of  a corrupt Roman official, the non-Jewish inhabitants of  the city of Jamnia, whom Philo describes as “persons of  other tribes from the neigh- boring nations” or “sojourners among the original native citizens” (i.e., the Jews) and who, what is more, were “continually violating some of  the ancestral national customs of  the Jews,” took the opportunity of  Caligula’s sudden disfavor toward the Jews and “erected an extemporaneous altar of  the most contemptible materials, having made clay into bricks for the sole purpose of  plotting against their fellow citizens; for they knew well that they would never endure to see their customs transgressed; as was indeed the case. For when the Jews saw what they had done, and were very indignant at the holiness and sanctity and beauty of  the sacred place being thus obscured and defaced, they collected together and destroyed the altar.”50 This “extemporaneous” altar of  “worthless wood” and fleeting bricks, built for the sole purpose of  provoking the Jews, contrasts with the perennial Jerusalem altar, made of  pure and “whole stones” (e.g., Deut. 27:6), notably described by Pseudo-Hecataeus.51 Its mixed composition only adds to its nature as a contaminating object, corrupting the sanctity of  the Promised Land, thÅÍ ¥eraÅÍ c∫raÍ to; ¥eroprepevÍ. Its erection, accord- ing to Philo, is an intolerable act of  provocation. He recalls that even in the eyes of  these “aliens” the fact that the Jews would consider this a sac- rilege that they “would not endure” is obvious. Indeed, as expected, the Jews destroy the impure altar. As a result, however, the situation de- teriorates still further, leading the emperor to command the erection of  a gigantic statue in the temple of  Jerusalem—a desecration the temple will only narrowly escape.52 Pseudo-Hecataeus also mentions that the Jews’ intolerance of  alien temples and altars had a price, even if  a lesser one: “in some cases,” he writes, “they paid a fine to the satraps, in others they obtained pardon.”53 50 Philo, Legatio ad Gaium, trans. C. D. Yonge (London: Bohn, 1854–90), 200–202. 51 Josephus, Contra Apionem I,198. Pseudo-Hecataeus further recalls that “there are not statues” in the Jerusalem temple (Contra Apionem I,199). 52 See Philo, Legatio ad Gaium, 202–333. See also the parallel account in Josephus, Jewish War II,184–203, and Jewish Antiquities XVIII,261–309. According to Josephus, similar neighborhood quarrels are partly responsible for the Jewish revolt against the Romans in 66 CE; see Josephus, Jewish War II,285–90; and Pierre Vidal-Naquet, Flavius Josèphe et la guerre des Juifs (Paris: Bayard, 2005). On the premises of  the Jewish war, see recently Martin Goodman, Rome and Jerusalem: The Clash of Ancient Civilizations (London, Penguin, 2007), 379–417. 53 Josephus, Contra Apionem I,193. </page> <page sequence="12"> 32 Sacking Temples Having suggested, via Philo, how Pseudo-Hecataeus’s appraisal of  the Jews’ “knocking-down” of  such alien temples and altars may result from the consideration that such is the way through which the “holiness and sanctity and beauty of  the sacred place” can be preserved from defilement, let us investigate a little further his hard-line stance. Indeed, the excerpts of  his treatise quoted by Josephus leave no doubt as to their author’s de- fense of  an uncompromising attitude. In the above-mentioned account of the origins of  the Jews attributed to the real Hecataeus of  Abdera (apud Diodorus Siculus apud Photius),54 the author reported that “when they (the Jews) became subject to foreign rule, as a result of  their mingling with men of  other nations (both under the Persian rule and under that of the Macedonians who overthrew the Persians), many of their traditional practices were disturbed.”55 In direct contradiction, however, Pseudo- Hecataeus insists that the Jews “cannot be shifted from their conviction” and would “suffer anything rather than transgress” their laws. Further- more, according to Josephus, he underscores how they would suffer “both tortures and the most terrible of  all death rather than deny their ancestral ways.”56 Among the examples provided to demonstrate such steadfast- ness comes the report of  the “knocking-down” of  the temples and a com- parable account about Alexander’s Jewish soldiers refusing to assist the army in its effort to rebuild the collapsed temple of  Bel in Babylon: there too, the Jews, so we read, “endured severe beating and paid heavy fines, until the king pardoned them and granted them amnesty.”57 Moreover, Pseudo-Hecataeus also reports “an incident involving a Jew” that he him- self  claims to have witnessed, according to Josephus: during Alexander’s march toward the Red Sea, a Jewish archer by the name of  Mosollamos, “a person of  considerable intellectual strength,” when confronted with the army’s unexpected halt because of  “a certain diviner, who was observing a bird for omens . . . drew his bow, fired, hit the bird, and killed it.”58 Confronted with the expected anger of  the diviner and “some others,” the archer scorns their gullibility, bluntly responding that if  the bird “had been able to know the future, it would not have come to this spot for fear that it be shot and killed by Mosollamos the Jew.” Undeniably, this Mosollamos may be considered as having had a particular “disposition” toward alien rites. Through a subtle accommodation of  the Hellenistic paradigm of  the “barbarian sage,” this fictitious anecdote allows our author to further attribute to a renowned Greek author the appraisal of 54 See n. 16 above. 55 Hecataeus of  Abdera, apud Diodorus Siculus XL,3,9.

Rather, they reflect a Jewish ideological context that follows the Maccabean revolt in Judea and the ensuing rise of  the Hasmonean rule over much of  Palestine in the late second century BCE.60 Particularly interesting in this light is the opinion of  the annexation of  “the land of  Samaria” attributed to “Hecataeus” (i.e., Pseudo-Hecataeus) by Josephus, said to go all the way back to Alexander the Great.61 Certainly, the annexation of  Samaria to the Hasmonean state needed legitimization. 1 Maccabees reports how two successive Seleucid kings acknowledged the annexation to Judea of  “three districts” from 59 On this Mosollamos incident, see Bar-Kochva, Pseudo-Hecateus, 57–71, where the case of  the author’s limited knowledge in the matters of  ancient ornithomancy is taken as an im- portant element of  his identification as a Jewish author. Greek (and Roman) thought is not, of course, exempt of  critical, even satirical, discourse on religious practices or, more specifi- cally, on divination and bird omens. There, however, the focus is mostly on the priest or the diviner. Especially significant is a story told by Plutarch, Moralia 217c–d (“When Antalcidas was being initiated at Samothrace, he was asked by the priest what especially dreadful thing he had done during his life, and he replied: If  any such deed has been committed by me, the gods themselves will know it!”). For divination see, e.g., Cicero, De Divinatione II,24 (“But indeed, that was quite a clever remark which Cato made many years ago: I wonder, said he, that a haruspex doesn’t laugh when he sees another haruspex”); also II,62; 80; Homer, Iliad II,858; Antisthenes, apud Diogenes Laërtius VI,24; Suetonius, Tiberius II. See also Livy X,40,1–12; and Valerius Maximus VII,2,5, where a deceitful Augur is sent to the front line during a battle against the Samnites; on this passage cf.

Chr.): Quellen, Terminologie, Kommentar, historische Entwick- lung (Stuttgart: Steiner, 2007), 398; Francesca Prescendi-Morresi, Comprendre et décrire le sacrifice: Les réflexions des Romains sur leur propre religion à partir de la littérature an- tiquaire (Stuttgart: Steiner, 2007), 91–93, and, more generally, 73–74. In Pseudo-Hecataeus’s anecdote, even if  the diviner is ridiculed by a pun (mavntiÍ—maÇnomai), it is nonetheless the bird who is credited with an alleged (but false) ability to “know the future,” and it is the bird that ultimately falls victim to the protagonist’s archery skills. According to Gruen, Heritage and Hellenism, 206: “No Greek would have found that amusing” (my emphasis). The anec- dote, so it has been suggested, should rather be compared with other Jewish mockeries of non-Jewish religious practices, e.g., the text known as Bel and the Dragon, a so-called Greek addition to the Book of  Daniel (see John J. Collins, Daniel: A Commentary on the Book of Daniel [Minneapolis: Augsburg Fortress, 1993], 418–19; Lawrence M. Wills, The Jew in the Court of the Foreign King: Ancient Jewish Court Legends [Minneapolis: Fortress, 1990], 132). There, Daniel laughs in the face of  the king who erroneously thinks that the image of Bel he worships is a “living god.” Daniel will demonstrate that this image is nothing “but clay within, and brass without, and has never eaten nor drunk,” before smashing it and con- founding its spurious priests (see Collins, Daniel, 405–8 for the translation and commentary of  the two known recensions of  this text). 60 Bar-Kochva, Pseudo-Hecateus, 128–37; also Holladay, Fragments from Hellenistic Jewish Authors, 329 n. 25. 61 Josephus, Contra Apionem II,43.

According to the composer of  this pastiche of  biblical narratives, the attitude toward the aliens prescribed by Deuteronomy and exemplified in the book of  Joshua was eventually taken seriously: after too long a foreign dominion, the land had to be cleansed again from its ever more stifling alien elements.64 The heroic achievements of  the Maccabees are precisely that they relentlessly fought against the wicked Jew-hating “nations roundabout” and thus restored the “holiness and sanctity and beauty” of  the Promised Land.65 To the composer of  1 Maccabees, “the nations,” ta; eßqnh, are all “basi- cally evil.”66 Both the Seleucid kings and their armies and the non-Jewish inhabitants of  Seleucid Palestine appear as the irreducible enemies of  the Jews. Alexander already is described as a hubristic king; and his suc- cessors are accused of  having further “caused many evils on earth,”67 “and from them came forth a sinful root, Antiochus Epiphanes” (1 Macc. 1:10).

This did not, however, prevent Israelite “lawless men” from misleading many by saying, “Let us go and make an alliance with the nations roundabout” (1 Macc. 1:11). The problem is thus threefold: the king, the “nations,” and the lawless Jews. All will, therefore, be re- sisted with equal zeal.71 All are in some way responsible for the desecra- tion of  the land and, even worse, of  the Jerusalem temple itself: “On the fifteenth day of  Chislev, in the one hundred and forty-fifth year [i.e., 167 BCE], they erected a desolating sacrilege upon the altar of  burnt offering. They also built altars in the surrounding cities of  Judah” (1 Macc. 1:54). Indeed, “many even from Israel . . . sacrificed to idols and profaned the Sabbath” (1 Macc. 1:43), thus following Antiochus’s decree according to which “altars and sacred precincts and shrines for idols, to sacrifice swine and unclean animals” were to be erected in the country (1 Macc. 1:47). In Jerusalem, a foreign garrison was installed (1 Macc. 1:34–36), and what both 1 Maccabees and the book of  Daniel call a “devastating abomina- tion” was set up in the temple’s holy of  holies (Dan. 11:31, 12:11; 1 Macc. 1:54), a “devastating abomination” that was precisely understood by the great historian Elias Bickerman as an alien altar.72 As any possible “limit of  toleration” had thus been crossed, “great wrath came upon Israel” (1 Macc. 1:64). “Alas! Why was I born to see this, the ruin of  my people, the ruin of  the holy city, and to dwell there when it was given over to the enemy, the sanctuary given over to aliens?” (1 Macc. 2:7). Such are the words 1 Maccabees attributes to Mattathias the priest. “Our holy place, our beauty, and our glory have been laid waste; the nations have profaned it” (1 Macc. 2:12). The rebellion is triggered when Mattathias, without 68 See also Dan. 7:8, 7:20–25, 9:26–27, 11:28, 11:31–36. 69 See Josephus, Contra Apionem II,90: sacrilegum regem. 70 See Schwartz, “Israel and the Nations Roundabout,” 23 and n. 28, for the biblical refer- ences with regard to the “nations roundabout.” 71 See, e.g., 1 Macc. 2:48: “They rescued the Law out of  the hands of  the Nations and kings, and they never let the sinner gain the upper hand.” 72 Bickerman, God of the Maccabees, 69–71. </page> <page sequence="16"> 36 Sacking Temples hesitation, kills a Jew who was coming forward “to offer sacrifice upon the altar in Modein, according to the king’s command” (1 Macc. 2:23): “When Mattathias saw it, he burned with zeal and his heart was stirred. He gave vent to righteous anger; he ran and killed him upon the altar. At the same time he killed the king’s officer who was forcing them to sacri- fice, and he tore down the altar. Thus he burned with zeal for the Law, as Phinehas did against Zimri the son of  Salu” (1 Macc. 2:24–26). The book of  Numbers recalls how the Israelites, in the desert, “began to play the harlot with the daughters of  Moab,” even sacrificing and bowing down to their gods (Num. 25:1–2). Seeing an Israelite mingling with one of  these Moabite women, Phinehas, son of  Eleazar, son of  Aaron, “took a spear in his hand and went after the man of  Israel into the inner room, and pierced both of  them, the man of  Israel and the woman, through her body” (Num. 25:7–8). Through his act, moreover through his “zeal,” qin’a, Phinehas took upon himself  Yahweh’s “jealousy,” qin’a, thus appeasing his wrath (Num. 25:11; Septuagint: zhÅloÍ)—so too Mattathias in 1 Maccabees. Moreover, just as Phinehas was granted “perpetual priest- hood, because he was jealous for his God, and made atonement for the people of  Israel” (Num. 25:13), the descendents of  Mattathias, that is, the Hasmoneans, would be entitled to priesthood, whatever their doubt- ful origins.73 They are the ones who took it upon themselves to act when such was the need. Thus: “Mattathias and his friends went about and tore down the altars” (1 Macc. 2:45). After Mattathias’s death, his son Judas, called “Maccabeus,” kept on the struggle (1 Macc. 3:4–5): “Like a young lion roaring for prey, he pursued the wicked, hunting them out, and those who troubled his people he destroyed by fire.” In December 164 BCE, Judas Maccabeus and his men, having defeated the armies of  the Seleucid general Lysias, entered the desecrated temple of  Jerusalem. New priests, “blameless and devoted to the Law,” carefully selected by Judas, “purified the sanctuary and carried away the stones of  the Abomination to an unclean place. They de- liberated about what ought to be done with the altar of  holocausts that had been desecrated. The happy thought came to them to tear it down, lest it be a lasting shame to them that the Nations had defiled it; so they tore down the altar. They stored the stones in a suitable place on the temple hill, until a prophet should come and decide what to do with them” (1 Macc. 4:42–46). The stones of  the alien altar were to be dealt with carefully. They were ritually stored in a similarly “unclean place” (probably where the remains 73 See the anti-Hasmonean polemics we encounter, e.g., in Josephus, Jewish Antiquities XIII,291; Testament of Moses VI,1. </page> <page sequence="17"> History of Religions 37 of  sacrifices were buried).74 As for the contaminated former altar to Yahweh, it was to be deposited in a “suitable place” inside the sacred pre- cinct, in anticipation of  a prophet to come. The purification of  the temple, commemorated by the feast of  Hanukkah, served as a precedent for the following purification of  the whole country.75 Indeed, after the sanctuary was restored, Judas attacked the “Nations roundabount”: the “sons of Esau,” the “sons of  Baean,” the “sons of  Ammon,” the nations of  Galaad, and the “Philistines” (see 1 Macc. 5–6). Having laid siege upon the sons of  Beaen, “he vowed their annihilation (a ̊neqemavtisen au ̊touvÍ) and burned down the towers along with all the persons in them” (1 Macc. 5:5). In Galaad, “the Nations were crushed before them [Judas and his men]; they threw away their arms and fled to the temple enclosure at Carnaim. The Jews captured that city and burnt the enclosure with all who were in it” (1 Macc. 5:43–44). So much for the Greeks’ a ̊sulÇa (inviolability): in accordance with the biblical rule of  herem, neither the temple nor the people who have taken refuge in it are to be spared. Interestingly enough, 2 Maccabees, which bears witness to a quite different perspective from that of  1 Maccabees,76 nonetheless explicitly parallels the capture of  the city of  Caspin by Judas Maccabeus, with the capture of  Jericho in the days of  Joshua (2 Macc. 12:15–16): “Judas and his men invoked the aid of  the great Sovereign of  the world, who, in the day of  Joshua, overthrew Jericho without battering-ram or siege machine; then they furiously stormed the ramparts. Capturing the city by the will of  God, they inflicted such indescribable slaughter on it that the adjacent pool, which was about a quarter of  a mile wide, seemed to be filled with the blood that flowed into it.”77 According to 1 Maccabees, it is Simon, however, the last of  the Maccabees, who definitely cleansed the land from its alien cults, although sparing the “aliens” themselves: “Simon came to terms with them and did not destroy them. He made them leave the city, however, and he purified the houses in which there were idols. Then he entered the city with hymns and songs of  praise.

Simon also succeeded in expelling the foreign garrison installed in Jerusalem since the days of  Antiochus Epiphanes, more than twenty years earlier: “He expelled them from there and cleansed the citadel from its pollutions” (1 Macc. 13:50). The author of  1 Maccabees thus summarizes the glorious deeds of  Simon: “The land had rest all the days of  Simon. He sought the good of  his nation; his rule was pleasing to them, as was the honor shown him, all his days. To crown all his honors he took Joppa for a harbor, and opened a way to the isles of  the sea. He extended the borders of  his nation, and gained full control of  the country. He gathered a host of  captives; he ruled over Gazara and Bethzur and the citadel, and he removed its uncleanness from it; and there was none to oppose him” (1 Macc. 14:4–7). Things have more or less returned to normal at the end of  1 Maccabes, where we learn that after Simon’s trai- torous assassination (by his son-in-law; 1 Macc. 16:11–17), John Hyrcanus “became high priest after his father” (1 Macc. 16:24). It is, however, in the days of  Simon’s successors, John Hyrcanus, Aristobulus I (104/3 BCE), and Alexander Janneaeus (103–76 BCE), that a truly systematic policy of  destruction of  alien temples actually seems to have occurred—at least according to Josephus, our only comprehensive source for the period.78 It was, of  course, these Hasmonean heirs of  the Maccabees who had the most interest in finding such enterprises legiti- mized in a chronicle such as 1 Maccabees describing the glorious deeds of  their forerunners. Josephus candidly reports that John Hyrcanus conquered Idumea and said he would refrain from exterminating its inhabitants only if  they would “submit to circumcision, and make use of  the laws of  the Jews.”79 In other words, to escape the herem, the aliens must themselves become Jews. Hyrcanus’s first son, Aristobulus, who ruled only one year but was the first Hasmonean to crown himself  king, is said to have behaved in the same way toward the Itureans.80 The greatest conqueror among the Hasmoneans was, of  course, Hyrcanus’s second son, Alexander Jannaeus, who once in power expanded his territory toward the coast on the one side, Trans-Jordan, and the desert on the other.81 In the process, the inhabitants of  Gaza, writes Josephus, were all slaughtered, as were the local council- men who sought refuge in Apollo’s temple. Alexander, we read, “utterly overthrew” the city.82 78 See Bar-Kochva, Pseudo-Hecateus, 129–34. 79 Josephus, Jewish Antiquities XIII,257. 80 Ibid., XIII,318–19. 81 Bar-Kochva, Pseudo-Hecateus, 131–32. 82 Josephus, Jewish Antiquities XII,364. </page> <page sequence="19"> History of Religions 39 Most famous of  all, of  course, is the fate reserved by John Hyrcanus for the city of  Samaria and the Samaritan temple on Mount Gerizim, also dedicated to Yahweh: “When Hyrcanus had taken that city, which was not done till after a year’s siege, he was not contented with doing that only, but he demolished it entirely, and brought mountain torrents to it to wash it away, for he dug such hollows as might let the water run under it; nay, he took away the very signs that there had ever been such a city there.”83 The Samaritans are indeed considered (even if  wrongly) as prototypical alien elements: Cutheans, installed on Jewish territory by foreign kings,84 who rebelliously dared to build a “temple which resembled the temple of Jerusalem.”85 The destruction of  the Gerizim temple, furthermore, would be inscribed on the Scroll of  Fasts (Megillat Taanit), the list of  Jewish holidays where, at the date of  Kislev 21, one can read: “Day of  Mt. Gerizim (on which it is not allowed to mourn)”—a holiday that commemorates the destruction of  an “alien” temple.86 * * * In general, people do not need a set of  rules—such as we find it in Deuteronomy—codifying proper behavior toward the enemy (or pur- ported enemy) in the context of  wars, conquests, or whatever quarrels they venture into. They are nonetheless always satisfied to find a discourse that legitimates the vast amount of  slaughtering, destruction, pillaging, and so on that such too-common human activities may involve and more- over that allows them to impart these with some greater meaning.87 The biblical commandments concerning the Nations of  Canaan—and thus the herem they are to be submitted to—may well originally belong to an inner-Israelite polemic: the Canaanite “alien” of  the Hebrew Bible is an alien from within, the ghost of  an idolatrous Israel prior to Israel, which needed to be uprooted and its memory condemned.88 One may 83 Ibid., XIII,281. 84 See 2 Kings 17 and the parallel account in Josephus, Jewish Antiquities IX,288–90. 85 Josephus, Jewish Antiquities XIII,56. 86 Megillat Taanit (Scroll of  Fasts) 9.3; Solomon Zeitlin, Megillat Taanit as a Source for Jewish Chronology and History in the Hellenistic and Roman Periods (Philadelphia, 1922), 70. 87 See, again, Lincoln, Religion, Empire, and Torture, as well as Bruce Lincoln, Holy Terrors: Thinking about Religion after September 11 (Chicago: University of  Chicago Press, 2003). 88 See, recently, Assmann, Of God and Gods, 111ff.; also Peter Machinist, “Outsiders and Insiders: The Biblical View of  Emergent Israel and Its Context,” in The Other in Jewish Thought and History: Constructions of Jewish Culture and Identity, ed.

The “Nations” may vaguely be the heirs of  the phantasmagorical Canaanites of  the past but are nonetheless first and foremost actual aliens: the other people who indeed dwell in the whole of  Palestine and with whom one may easily want to “mingle” were the biblical paradigm, in that respect, not to be applied anew. Such is, at least, the Jewish discourse within which war and, moreover, the sacking of  such aliens and their polluting temples was given its place. In distinction from the case of  the Persian invasion of  Greece, no com- prehensive Greek account has come down to us concerning the events that took place in Judea and, more broadly, Palestine between the rule of Antiochus Epiphanes and the acme of  the Hasmoneans. As was under- lined some time ago by Arnaldo Momigliano with regard to the Maccabean “crisis,” “We are virtually deprived of  the Seleucid, or more generally the Hellenic, version of  the events in Judea,” for the reconstruction of  which we are thus dependent on the Jewish viewpoint.89 Nonetheless, just as the Persian enterprises had determined the Greek perception of  the Persians— even largely fashioning the Greek “invention” of  the latter—so too the Jewish “cleansing” of  their country must have affected their perception by others. To Lysimachus and his readers, the story of  the Jews plundering and destroying temples and altars as they arrived from Egypt may have echoed the Maccabean actions and the subsequent Hasmonean rule— certainly also serving the purpose of  marking the Jews as an irreducible “noncivilized” people, to say the least.90 At any rate, even if  we are “de- prived” of  any Greek historiographical relation of  these events, we do encounter other interpretations of  them. Among these is the well-known opinion expressed by Tacitus that “king Antiochus endeavored to destroy the national superstition and to introduce Greek civilization.”91 This, however, may have already been the outlook of  Posidonius of  Apamea, a renowned Greek philosopher and historian contemporary to the Hasmo- neans.92 Indeed, Posidonius is probably to be regarded as the source of Diodorus Siculus’s account of  the invasion of  Judea by the Seleucid king 89 Momigliano, Alien Wisdom, 102. 90 Stern, GLAJJ, 386; Berthelot, Philantrôpia judaica, 109. 91 Tacitus, Histories V,8 (GLAJJ, no. 281).

Katell Berthelot recently pointed out that this Posidonian account— whether the author aligned himself  with the opinions he reports or not— certainly “sheds light on the link between the Maccabean revolt and the Hasmonean wars on the one side and the development of  the accusation of  misanthropy [i.e., against the Jews] in the Seleucid world on the other.”95 Strabo’s considerations with regard to the Jews—which also partly derive from Posidonius—further testify to the shift in the way these were per- ceived in between the days of  Alexander and the days of  Augustus.96 As a matter of  fact, Strabo starts by lauding Moses, an “Egyptian priest” who left Egypt because “he was displeased with the state of  affairs there.” Indeed, he taught “that the Egyptians were mistaken in representing the Divine Being by the images of  beasts an cattle, as were also the Libyans; and that the Greek were also wrong in modeling gods in human form; for, according to him, God is the one thing alone that encompasses us all and encompasses land and sea—the thing we call heaven, or universe, or the nature of  all that exists.”97 Moses and his followers settled in Jerusalem without making any use of  violence in part, writes Strabo, because “it was not a place . . . for which anyone would make a serious fight,” but also because Moses, “instead of  using arms, put forward as defense his sacri- fices and his Divine Being.”98 93 Diodorus Siculus, Bibliotheca Historica XXXIV–XXXV,1,1–5 (in Photius, Cod. 244; in GLAJJ, no. 63); Stern, GLAJJ, 184; Berthelot, Philantrôpia judaica, 111–43, esp. 127– 33. On Antiochus Sidetes’s invasion of  Judea, see the parallel account of  Josephus, Jewish Antiquities XIII,236–52, which, according to Berthelot, Philantrôpia judaica, 137, follow- ing Tessa Rajak, “Roman Intervention in a Seleucid Siege of  Jerusalem?” Greek, Roman and Byzantine Studies 22 (1981): 65–81, suggests that Josephus and Posidonius may both rely on the Seleucid court historian Timochares. 94 Diodorus Siculus, Bibliotheca Historica XXXIV–XXXV,1,1.3. 95 Berthelot, Philantrôpia judaica, 132 (the translation from French is my own). 96 Stern, GLAJJ, 265–66; see also Berthelot, Philantrôpia judaica, 113–23, with a review of  the literature. 97 Strabo, Geography XVI,2,35 (in GLAJJ, no. 115). 98 Ibid., XVI,2,36. </page> <page sequence="22"> 42 Sacking Temples To Strabo, in those days Jews were philosophers, and Moses can be compared with the Indian Gymnosophists, the Persian Magi, the Assyrian Chaldeans, and so on.99 On the other hand, after his successors “for some time abided by the same course,” the priesthood was soon taken over by “superstitious men” and then “tyrannical people.”100 Things had now changed: where Moses had instituted an original cult exempt of  any “divine obsessions or with any other absurd troubles” now stands deisi- daimonÇa, “excess” with regard to religion.101 Strabo further adds, “And from the tyrannies arose the bands of  robbers; for some revolted and harassed the country, both their own country and that of  their neighbors, whereas others, co-operating with the rulers, seized the property of  others and subdued much of  Syria and Phoenicia.”102 In the end, however, Strabo recalls, “Pompey clipped off  some of  the territory that had been forcibly appropriated by the Jews, and appointed Herod to the priesthood.”103 As a matter of  fact, the Hellenistic cities of  Palestine, subjected to Hasmonean rule, retained the date of  Pompey’s submission of  the Levant (63 BCE) as marking the start of  a new calendar era.104 Even though Strabo and, before him, Posidonius depend on a broader theory of  cultural degeneration over time, they do confront us with the perception of  the Hasmoneans in Greek literary or philosophical circles.105 From their view- point, it is the Jews who have gone too far at some point and have crossed a “limit of  toleration,” whatever its legitimization in Jewish discourse. Thus, if  Jews and Greeks seem to agree on the fact that Jews do not like alien temples, the appreciation of  such a fact is obviously quite dif- ferent. In Jewish eyes, the uncompromising stance with regard to alien temples—and one may suggest, more broadly, alien religion—fits in with a very specific ideological discourse relating to the preservation of  the sanctity of  the land and its people. In non-Jewish eyes, however, the same stance appears as “immoderate,” contributing to the coining of  the Jews not as a “people of  philosophers,” but as a “sacrilegious,” “misanthropic,” and even “impious nation.” If  in between these two perspectives the “limits of  toleration” cannot be drawn in the same way, the respective discourses they give birth to can nonetheless be compared.
