<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Brake of Time: Corso's Bomb as Postmodern God(dess) Christine HoffKraetner Since its initial publication in 1958, Gregory Corso's surreal and am- biguous ode to the destructive power of the bomb has consistently aroused extreme reactions in its readers. In a 1959 Time magazine one reviewer scathingly quoted from "Bomb"'s enthusiastic final lines as a prime example of "Beat blather" that, in his eyes, was "certainly not literature" but was excellent for recitations in the bathtub ("Bang," 80). Corso's presentation of the poem to a poetry group at New College in England was met with frank hostility, ending with Corso and Allen Ginsberg being heckled and bombarded with the shoes of the offended members of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (Moraes, 67). In contrast to this negative reception, Ginsberg defended the poem in ex- travagant aesthetic terms, arguing that "it just reduces the bomb to insignificance because the poem is greater than the bomb" (Horovitz, 67). Even Ginsberg's reaction, however, fails to acknowledge that the poem is more than just a powerful, provocative, and often amusing piece of poetry. Corso's style is wild and impressionistic, but "Bomb" never- theless articulates sophisticated social and religious questions that continue to plague us even after the fear of total nuclear holocaust has been eased somewhat by the end of the Cold War. Though "Bomb" over- • flows with surreal juxtapositions and farcical absurdity, the humor is not an end in itself but rather a tool to destabilize the reader's ingrained assumptions about nuclear apocalypse. Only after the reader has been disarmed by Corso's often hilarious treatment of a matter that is still deadly serious does the poet slip in the powerful, underlying central image - the bomb as a bringer of ultimate chaos, the brake of time itself, a postmodern god for a world that at Hiroshima suddenly realized its potential for self-annihilation. Yet Corso does not leave the reader to morbidly ruminate over these dark images. Instead, the poet recovers his sense of humor, courting the bomb with a passionate love letter and finally launching into a wild cel- ebration of destruction, reminiscent of a small boy's delight with a home chemistry set: Texas Studies in Literature and Language, Vol. 44, No. 2, Summer 2002 © 2002 by the University of Texas Press, P.O.

The bomb is a reality; death is a reality, and for Corso, the only reasonable reaction is to embrace, celebrate, and laugh with the resulting chaos. Though "Bomb" contains a whisper of social criticism, it offers no impetus to fight to change the system. Corso himself, in fact, denied that the poem had any political message at all. As he explained in a rambling interview with Michael Andre and Robert King, his reaction to the anti-nuclear protests of the 1950s focused more on death itself than on the fear of nuclear holocaust: "People were worry- ing about dying by the Bomb in the Fifties. So I said, what about falling off the roof, what about heart attack old age I picked as being the heavi- est - 'old age, old age'" (Skau, "On Bomb"). Though Corso always distanced himself from the Buddhist beliefs of fellow Beats Ginsberg and Kerouac, "Bomb"'s embrace of death has Eastern influences of which Corso himself may have been unconscious. In the face of postmodern fragmentation, Corso's position is one that is extremely compatible with both Hindu and Buddhist traditions - a sense of resignation, coupled with a casting aside of order as a source of meaning in favor of increas- ingly ubiquitous chaos. Critics of Stanley Kubrick's notorious satire Dr. Strangelove: or, How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb have suggested that the effec- tiveness of the film's humor is directly related to the taboo nature of its subject matter. In 1964 the Cuban missile crisis was just a few years in the past; the film Failsafe, which Dr. Strangelove consciously parodied, had freshened fears that a nuclear power might unintentionally trigger World War III. As a result, the film's mockery of the government, the military, and the bomb itself were deeply shocking - and, therefore, jokingly, hys- terically funny. Corso's intent seems to be much the same in his humorous presentation of the bomb. In an era during which all discussions of nuclear war were tainted with anti-Communist rhetoric and a brutal us- versus-them competitiveness, Corso needed a way to temporarily remove these connotations and create a clear zone within which his read- ers could contemplate the bomb from a slightly less ethnocentric point of view. Ironically, though Corso literally "dresses up" the bomb, the net re- sult is revelatory, demonstrating our collectively imagined bomb to be much more than a political tool in the international power struggle. The primary device that Corso uses to decontextualize the bomb is juxtaposition.

Enlargements of individual lines. Notice the slightly crooked lettering of these lines, which occurs throughout the poem: the dangling "e" in "the sad des- perate gun," the dangling "1" in "AI/ man hates you," the dangling "e" and "s" in "are deaths like," the elevated "th" in "no other death," and the dangling period in "St." and crooked "e" in "peeling." concepts butt up against each other, and puns, wordplay, and nonsensi- cal images reminiscent of the visual art of Dalí or Magritte plunge the reader into a chaotic world of dreams and half-glimpsed impressions. The result is characteristically postmodern, as Corso draws heavily from both pop and classical culture, shoving the sundry elements together with a deliberate disregard for consistency or order. The poem's larger structure is equally loose; "Bomb" lacks clear transitions, skipping al- most randomly from topic to topic. More often, however, Corso creates bizarre contrasts within a single line, throwing together elements that do not and could not meet in the real world. Turtles exploding over Istanbul The jaguar's flying foot soon to sink in arctic snow Penguins plunged against the Sphinx The top of the Empire State arrowed in a broccoli field in Sicily (30-35) Corso gives the reader only one clue to interpreting this mishmash of images: the association of disparate objects is always presented in con- junction with the exploding bomb. Even the poem's appearance reinforces the primacy of the moment of explosion: the piece is shaped like a rising mushroom cloud. Though the effect is lost in later printings, the original pamphlet edition of "Bomb" published by City Lights particularly emphasizes the poem's sense of instability and intruding chaos - the text itself, apparently printed on a relatively primitive press, marches un- steadily across the page with individual letters slightly askew. Clearly, the poet's bomb represents something more complex than mere fiery destruc- tion. Unlike a real nuclear bomb, Corso's does not merely obliterate;</page><page sequence="5">Corso's Bomb 215 instead, it breaks connections, producing chaos and forcing incompatible elements together. In a world dominated by the bomb, contradictions are the order of the day, and sly paradoxes reign: pieces of human monu- ments (perhaps monuments to humans?) are mixed with fragments of the animal world, the normally conquering Christ strikes out at baseball, as- trologers lean on "desk[s] of science/' and (more didactically) children play in parks while men die in electric chairs. In the first section of the poem (contained in the head of the mush- room cloud), Corso takes on death itself with equally cheerful impiety. His verse has the singsong quality of a child's recitation, the lurid images rendered cartoonish by Corso's puns and childlike neologisms. O there are deaths like witches of Arc Scarey deaths like Boris Karloff No-feeling deaths like birth-death sadless deaths like old pain Bowery Abandoned deaths like Capital Punishment stately deaths like senators And unthinkable deaths like Harpo Marx girls on Vogue covers my own (16-19) Corso emphasizes death's unreality in these lines, helping the reader to temporarily distance herself from it as well. Death can be "scarey," in the way that a child quails at an old black-and-white monster movie; lonely, like the state-sponsored executions that the public never sees; dignified, as one might imagine a government official's to be; or unthinkable, in the way that we do not contemplate the deaths of icons of our society: be- loved clowns like Harpo Marx, who was still alive at the time of Corso's writing ("Harpo"), or beautiful Vogue models whose reified youth seems timeless. Though the short, sudden "my own" at the end of this section adds a trace of seriousness, most of the passage examines death from the point of view of an external observer, using simple categories that a child might understand. Even the gravity of Jeanne d'Arc's terrible death is undermined by the poet's word choice - though he elevates her specific death by making it symbolic of an entire class (the unjust deaths of mar- tyrs?), his use of the word "witches" rather than "saints," "martyrs," or even "Joans" irreverently diminishes the famous young mystic by label- ing her as her executioners did. These techniques distance the reader from the grotesque, concrete details that characterize death in the real world. By examining the experience of death so broadly, Corso has achieved much the same effect that an artist might by portraying death as a black- cloaked Grim Reaper - death is sanitized and simplified, encouraging the reader to contemplate associated ideas and images rather than the full</page><page sequence="6">216 Christine Hoff Kraemer horror of its reality. Even here, however, Corso hints at the direction the poem will take later: these superficial descriptions of death provide no context for contemplating the nature of one's own mortality. Corso's in- ability to characterize his death with a glib adjective indicates an uneasy awareness of his own death's ineffability. This distancing passage leads directly into a description of New York being destroyed by a nuclear bomb. Corso's description stops with the participants' last conscious moments as they huddle in the shelter of a subway. a city New York City streaming starkeyed subway shelter Scores and scores A fumble of humanity High heels bend Hats whelming away Youth forgetting their combs Ladies not knowing what to do with their shopping bags Unperturbed gum machines [. . .] The smiling Schenley poster will still smile (22-25, 28) Corso plays here with a memento mori theme, which appears in the literary canon with some frequency starting in the Middle Ages. Works such as Thomas Nash's "A Litany in Times of Plague" show the ephemerality and vanity of human endeavor in the face of certain mortality. Just as the plague served as the mechanism for apocalypse and a symbol of looming death for medieval writers, so the bomb has been for post-World War II writers.1 Thus, Corso's emphasis in this scene is on the sad absurdity of humanity in the face of "Bombdeath" - people fumbling about fearfully, still worrying about their personal possessions even in their last mo- ments, their surroundings (gum machines, advertisements, etc. - all symbols of human culture) unchanged, prosaic, and trivial. Corso notes, "I do not know how horrible Bombdeath is I can only imagine / Yet no other death I know has so laughable a preview" (20-21). The humor here has a bit of an edge. The poet's laughter is both condescending and sad, mocking the confusion of the humans unable to grasp the enormity of their fate. Yet as in Nash's "Litany," Corso's mention of his own death implicitly includes him in the foolish crowd, so befuddled by the confu- sion that they fail to even recognize their plight. Given the distancing passage above, as well as the fact that Corso steers us away from identify- ing with any individual in the huddling crowd, the overall effect of this passage is ironic. From the poet's point of view, the doomed humans are both pitiable and laughably absurd, their death's suddenness robbing it of significance and dignity. From this ambiguous point in the passage, Corso moves through the series of outrageous juxtapositions quoted above ("Penguins plunged against the Sphinx," etc.) and then dives unapologetically into pure</page><page sequence="7">Corso's Bomb 217 whimsy. Though the humor of the previous sections might easily be described as black, Corso's mad baseball game is unabashedly playful. Once again, the poet obliquely implies that the incompatible elements that make up the baseball game have come together as a result of the bomb: "O Athletic Death Sportive Bomb/' he says, and describes "Electrons Protons Neutrons" (perhaps the only things that remain after the explosion?) marching to enter the "final amphitheatre" (38, 41, 45). Though the exact origins of the game are unclear, its positioning within the poem after the lines describing the destruction of New York suggests that it may be a kind of chaotic heaven or afterlife, thrown to- gether by the antics of the "sportive" bomb. In Corso's game lyres and tubas play together in the same band, Hermes races Olympic star Jesse Owens, and concession stands serve a strange combination of ancient Greek and American cuisine, while major religious figures - including Christ and Buddha - compete on the field.2 Despite the poet's pronounced tendency to indulge in mad fantasies like the above, "Bomb" is not entirely devoid of social commentary. Later in the poem, the reader has a sudden, surprisingly personal glimpse of the poet as he moves back into the first person. That I am unable to hate what is necessary to love That I can't exist in the world that consents a child in a park a man dying in an electric-chair That I am able to laugh at all things all that I know and do not know thus to conceal my pain That I say I am a poet and therefore love all man [. . .] (109-14) The flippancy with which the poet treats the destruction of New York is not the product of a jaded or uncompassionate soul. These short but com- plex lines encapsulate Corso's conundrum: as a poet, he feels a duty to love humanity and to celebrate the world as it is; but the world contains both beauty and horror in equal amounts, making it "necessary to love" the horror as well as the beauty. Corso's response to this paradox is simple: he laughs, thus removing himself from the paradox and placing himself above it, where the absurdity of the human condition is clear. This particular section of "Bomb," in which Corso struggles with the horror he perceives in the world, resonates well with Ginsberg's slightly earlier "Howl." Like a slide machine flicking through images too quickly for the watcher to absorb or really comprehend them, the first section of "Howl" is highly fragmented, each line a separate clause in a sentence that stretches over many pages of text. Each of these clauses contains a different image of the pain, desperation, or oppression of what Ginsberg calls "the best minds of my generation," a group of nonconformists in</page><page sequence="8">218 Christine Hoff Kraemer search of spiritual enlightenment and meaning. Unfortunately, Ginsberg implies, the structure of society is such that the spiritually minded are systematically put down, injured, or eradicated. They flounder in a dis- connected mess of pop culture, unable even to determine what is it they are looking for: whether "jazz or sex or soup," "Plotinus Poe St. John of the Cross telepathy [or] bop kabbalah." Ultimately, writes Ginsberg, they are "destroyed by madness [. . .] dragging themselves through the negro streets at dawn looking for an angry fix" (Ginsberg, 9-26). These same problems - alienation, apathy, cruelty - are sore spots for Corso as well, though his reaction in "Bomb" is more melancholy and less defiant than Ginsberg's. This existential angst, however, was hardly unique to the Beats. The despair resulting from the inability to find meaning either in the sur- rounding world or in the self is discussed most famously by Kierkegaard in his The Sickness Unto Death as well as immortalized in Beckett's Waiting for Godot and Camus's The Stranger. The subjects of Ginsberg's "Howl" react to this seemingly inescapable reality by engaging in self-destructive behavior: ravaging their bodies with fasting and drugs, committing crimes, attempting suicide, and finally adding to the chaos around them with random acts - throwing potato salad at lecturers or writing obscene poetry on walls. It is these latter acts that may provide one explanation for Corso's morbidly exuberant joy in the explosion of nuclear bombs. In Beckett's Waiting for Godot Didi and Gogo suffer miserably unless they play, laugh, and avoid contemplating the futility of their situation. Similarly, we can easily imagine Ginsberg's Beats eking out a little relief from their acts of "poetic terrorism": seriously rebelling against the Enlightenment-derived worship of rationality that they saw as enslaving but also rejoicing in the liberating pleasure of absurdity and relishing the shocked, uncomprehending reactions of the squares. Corso's exploding bombs provide the same relief of breaking out of the system - this time by breaking the oppressive and contradictory system itself. To say that "Bomb" is merely Corso's irreverent way of coping with a paradoxical and oppressive world, however, ignores the poem's religious elements. Although Corso rejected the Roman Catholic upbringing of his childhood, his work as a whole demonstrates a continuing dialogue with various conceptions of God, of which that presented in "Bomb" is only one. Though the bulk of this imagery appears about halfway through the poem, Corso has not left us entirely unprepared. The poet places heavily loaded language even in the most ridiculous and lighthearted section of the poem, the baseball game: "the visiting team of Present / the home team of Past" (50-51). These lines suggest that the bomb has united the past and the present, recalling the opening lines, "Budger of history Brake of time" (1). Cast in these terms, the bomb is not merely a</page><page sequence="9">Corso's Bomb 219 weapon; it takes on godlike powers, enabling it to interfere with the progression of time itself. Corso reinforces these characterizations with a pastiche of religious imagery, playfulness, and suggestions of cosmic power, setting up a tension in the image of the bomb that will not be articulated fully until later in the poem. Toy of universe Grandest of all snatched-sky I cannot hate you Do I hate the mischievous thunderbolt the jawbone of an ass The bumpy club of One Million B.C. the mace the flail the axe [...] And hath not St. Michael a burning sword St. George a lance David a sling Bomb you are as cruel as man makes you (2-4, 6-7) This passage is full of apparent contradictions. The bomb is presented as tremendously powerful, compared to a thunderbolt, and called "Grand- est of all snatched-sky" - an ambiguous image evoking, perhaps, a stormy horizon or the mushroom cloud itself. Its destructive power, however, is presented as potentially neutral. Corso evokes beloved religious figures, symbols of all that is good and righteous, and notes that they too have the power to kill and destroy. The bomb, however, is only "as cruel as man makes [it]," notes the poet, observing that our tendency to anthropomor- phize objects leads us to perceive the bomb as cruel when it is merely fulfilling its function. Despite these images of power, Corso also strikes a discordant note by calling the bomb the universe's toy. This paradox, in which Corso assigns the bomb both childlike and godlike attributes, is a recurring trope of "Bomb." Corso's celebration of chaos and apocalypse resonates strongly with the Eastern philosophy that his associates Ginsberg and Kerouac favored, in which destruction is seen as necessary and natural- death being, in fact, a prerequisite to new life. Corso finds a fiery beauty in the bomb as well as carnage and horror: You are due and behold you are due and the heavens are with you hosannah incalescent glorious liaison BOMB O havoc antiphony molten cleft BOOM Bomb mark infinity a sudden furnace spread thy multitudinous encompassed Sweep set forth awful agenda Carrion stars charnel planets carcass elements Corpse the universe tee-hee-finger-in-the-mouth hop over its long long dead Nor</page><page sequence="10">220 Christine Hoff Kraemer From thy nimbled matted spastic eye exhaust deluges of celestial ghouls From thy appellational womb spew birth-gusts of great worms Rip open your belly Bomb from your belly outflock vulturic salutations Battle forth your spangled hyena finger stumps along the brink of Paradise (76-93) The destruction imagined here is cosmic in scope. Corso was hardly the first to assign the bomb godlike qualities, however. Robert Oppenheimer 's famous response to the first Los Alamos nuclear test was to recall Krishna's words from the Bhagavad-Gita: "I am become Death, shatterer of worlds/'3 Interestingly, however, Corso's language describes a female bomb. "[Y]ou are due" suggests pregnancy and labor, and a few lines later the bomb does indeed give birth to cosmic destruction from its "appellational womb." Corso's choice of the word "appellational" is oddly appropriate to the Hindu destroyer /mother goddess Kali. His phrasing suggests a simultaneous act of naming and bringing into creation, much as the Judeo- Christian god is portrayed as bringing the world into creation through the Logos, or Word. Similarly, Kali wears fifty human skulls representing the letters of the Sanskrit alphabet, "the manifest state of sound from which all creation evolved" (Harding, 43). Some mystics also interpret her pro- truding tongue as the expression of sound by which the universe is created (55). Even the time-related language quoted above ("Brake of time," etc.) has a potential connection to imagery associated with the Hindu goddess. The word "Kali" comes from the Sanskrit word "kala," or time, and Kali herself is considered to have "the power of time which devours all" (41). This conception resonates well with Corso's image of the bomb as some- thing that can both stop time and force past and present together as though they were one and the same. The organic quality of the words Corso uses to describe the bomb's destruction is also strongly reminiscent of Hindu legends of Kali, who is often pictured as wearing the dismembered limbs of her victims. Though Corso's intent seems to be to portray the bomb's destructive power as godlike, he does not primarily focus on the bomb's most seemingly awe- some destructive power, the intense initial explosion that instantaneously vaporizes everything within a wide radius. Instead, Corso lingers on the disturbingly organic aftermath, suggesting images of mangled and rotting flesh: "carrion," "charnel," "carcass," "corpse." This imagery reso- nates with the myth of Kali's creation by the other gods as told in the Chandi,4 in which she is given form in order to defeat a marauding army</page><page sequence="11">Corso's Bomb 221 of demons. Elizabeth U. Harding retells this myth in the introduction to her book, Kali: The Black Goddess of Dakshineswar: Dust clouds gathered the stench of singed skin and rotting flesh to the blood-red horizon. The demons had been killed, and their blood flowed, accumulating here and there in small pools around carcasses of elephants and horses. Only some headless torsos of demons who refused to give up life still fought the Devi. The battle shrieks had died and the only cries now were those of jackals and hyenas. There was nothing left to kill, but the blood-intoxicated Mother in the form of Kali continued the carnage - smashing and slashing dead demons all over again, (xxii) This apocalyptic scene very much echoes the carnal quality of Corso's word choices. Significantly, however, the poet does not portray the bomb destroying buildings and men, or even devils and demons. Corso's bomb makes a corpse of the universe itself, slaying the stars and planets, mark- ing infinity (all of creation) with fiery annihilation. Clearly, the apocalyptic imagery that Corso employs encompasses much more than nuclear holocaust - this apocalypse is cosmic in nature, worthy of a god, as Corso clearly acknowledges with his biblical use of "thy" and "thou." Unsurprisingly, this is not the only work in which Corso experiments with images influenced by Eastern religion. The title of his poem "God? She's Black" potentially has religious as well as political significance (Corso, Ferlinghetti, and Ginsberg, 25). Given the religious atmosphere in America in the early 1960s, the suggestion that God might be not only female but also African American would have been construed as aggres- sively offensive toward the mainstream Christian establishment, a fact that Corso would certainly have relished.5 Secondly, the title recalls Kali's traditionally black skin. In explanation of Kali's blackness, one Tantric scripture comments, "Just as all colors disappear in black so all names and forms disappear in Kali."6 As an aspect of Devi, the Great Mother, Kali represents both time itself and the limitless Void from which creation came (comparable, say some scholars of comparative mythology, to the "formless void" of Genesis 1:2). Kali, who is always pictured as nude aside from her bloody adornments, is also said to be clad in infinite space in order to symbolize her lack of boundaries (Harding, 52). Though it is unclear whether Corso was aware of this imagery when he wrote about the infinite goddess of physics and space that appears in "God? She's Black," his deity serves very well as an interpretation of Kali through a scientific Westerner's eyes. In it God(dess) is literally portrayed as the physical laws of nature by the first lines of five parallel stanzas:</page><page sequence="12">222 Christine Hoff Kraemer "Gases &amp; liquids Her nature"; "Solids &amp; solutions Her procedure"; "For- mulae &amp; equations Her law"; "Metals &amp; alloys Her chore"; "Sound &amp; Light Her Store." Like the Hindu Mother goddess, this God(dess) is all- encompassing, giving birth to "stars like eggs" from an "All Central Womb"; like Kali, she is described in terms of space and void, as in the phrase "Her All Void Hand." Corso uses the word "All" to describe the God(dess) a total of five times in six stanzas - clear indication of her om- nipresence and limitlessness. Given these commonalities between Hindu myth and the imagery Corso uses in "Bomb," it is likely that Corso was at least indirectly influ- enced by Eastern myth in creating the poem's apocalyptic vision. This may also help explain why Corso's struggle with chaos and contradiction in the world around him ends with his total embrace of apocalypse at the end of the poem. If the reader interprets the poem with the similarities between Kali and the bomb in mind, then the bomb's role as a catalyst for the cycle of death and rebirth that is central to Eastern thought becomes clear. The connection between the nuclear bomb of Hiroshima and that of the poem, in fact, may be purely symbolic. The bomb's association with juxtaposition and postmodern fragmentation suggests that instead Corso's bomb serves to pull down systems of meaning and identity - causing, in other words, the symbolic death of those identities. In true rebellion against his Roman Catholic upbringing, primary among those systems of mean- ing that the bomb blows apart is the Judeo-Christian notion of God. Bomb O final Pied Piper both sun and firefly behind your shock waltz God abandoned mock-nude beneath His thin false-talc'd apocalypse [. . .] His Kingdom an eternity of crude wax Clogged clarions untrumpet him Sealed angels unsing Him A thunderless God A dead God O Bomb Thy BOOM His tomb (94-97, 101-5) It is obvious from Corso's choice of details that this "dead God" is the Judeo-Christian Jehovah. In the New Testament the place where God dwells is often referred to as "the Kingdom of Heaven," which the poet pictures as a lifeless shell. Further, the trumpets and angels that are the traditional trap- pings of God's messengers are now engaged in his destruction. Corso's use of the phrase "Sealed angels" is likely an allusion to Revelation, in which seven seals are broken before God's wrath - Judgement Day - is unleashed on the world. God, however, is dead, a casualty of the bomb's archetypal, technological might, and his promised apocalypse has been rendered thin,</page><page sequence="13">Corso's Bomb 223 false, and impotent. Instead, it is the bomb that will entice humanity to its end (note the word "final"), much as the Pied Piper of the folktale led first the rats and then the children out of Hamelin. By echoing Nietzsche's notorious and often misunderstood state- ment that "God is dead," the poet also seems to agree with the philosopher that the traditional, anthropomorphic, lawgiving Western god has become inadequate for the spiritual needs of the late twentieth century. In an age of technology, it is the bomb, the "final Pied Piper," that is capable of calling humanity to death and beyond, not the biblical God of Judgement Day. God has been rendered "thunderless" by modern thought, unable to smite wrongdoers with a Jovian thunderbolt or even, given the very real and equivalent power of the bomb, to make anyone believe that godlike power actually requires a God. Corso's line "Thy BOOM His tomb" suggests that the bomb has, in a sense, stolen God's thunder; it is the might of the bomb that people fear and hold in awe, not the Judeo-Christian God's power. Clearly, Corso's poem is more than a love song to a bomb. By personifying cosmic destruction in the form of a technological reality, Corso has demonstrated the force with which technology is now changing the archetypes that populate our psychic landscape. If it is primarily the bomb that evokes fear and awe in people while God no longer does, then in some sense, technology has usurped a place in our psyches previously held only by religion. Comparative religion scholar Ira Chernus discusses exactly this point in his 1986 book Dr. Strangegod. Arguing that the image of the nuclear bomb encompasses many of the elements of major religions' god- figures - infinite power, the notion of inevitability or fate, the day of apocalypse /judgement - Chernus suggests that one of the most signifi- cant experiences of the numinous for modern man is contemplating, in person or on film, the destructive power of the bomb. "[R]eligious symbols are paradoxical," Chernus writes in his introduction: They tell us that when we reach life's depths and extremities, order and disorder - the rational and the irrational, life and death - meet in the unifying embrace of a limitless power. Hence they tell us that to gain order and life we must accept, and perhaps experience intensely, disorder and death. (8-9) This seems to be exactly the process that the poet experiences - and, ideally, helps the reader to experience - in the course of the poem. The poet begins in a state of confusion and uncertainty, telling the bomb "I cannot hate you" but failing to directly address its reality. Instead, he re- treats behind humor and absurdity, sanitizing his portrayal of New York being destroyed and launching into the frankly silly description of the</page><page sequence="14">224 Christine Hoff Kraemer eclectic baseball game. His explanation for this behavior comes much later in the poem: "I am able to laugh at all things [. . .] thus to conceal my pain" (112-13). The poet is clearly cognizant of the world's contradictory nature and of the kinds of suffering that human beings can inflict. In par- ticular, the poem contains a total of three references to capital punishment, an issue that in the poet's eyes seems to represent man's ba- sic injustice to man.7 From this point of tension and discomfort, the poet descends to contemplate chaos and destruction in its full, cosmic, primal majesty ("hosannah incalescent glorious liaison / BOMB O havoc an- tiphony molten cleft BOOM" [78-79]), and then to consider directly, for the first time, his ambivalent feelings about the world he perceives ("That I am unable to hate what is necessary to love" [109]). The result is a revela- tion that the reader is only privy to if she shares it. Having contemplated his own inability to make the world around him fit a coherent pattern, Corso chooses to embrace and accept it, moving into an affectionate love song to the bomb and finally into a mad paean to destruction. Though previously the poet seems to have sought order, that is, a world in which horror and beauty cannot coexist, at the close of the poem he has chosen the overwhelming reality of chaos as a viable substitute. Hindu theolo- gians have been known to note that it is the very certainty of the death/ rebirth cycle that makes it so comforting; similarly, in "Bomb," chaos is a constant that can be molded into a source of stability. In seemingly direct contrast to this vision of the bomb as a godlike destroyer /creator, however, is the representation of the bomb as playful, childlike, and occasionally innocent that follows. The bomb is described as "impish" and "sportive"; Corso exhorts it to foxlike play with "Leap Bomb Bound Bomb frolic zig and zag" (72), praising its "binging bag" and "jubilee feet" (73, 74). The energy and cheerfulness of this language is unmistakable. "Binging bag" is onomatopoetic, perhaps suggesting the celebratory explosion of firecrackers; "jubilee" and "frolic" suggest ener- getic, joyful, dancelike motion, as does the phrase "Satyr Bomb," which evokes the destructive but oddly spiritual ecstasy of a springtime Dionysian revel. Even in the most dramatic exposition of the bomb's an- nihilative power, Corso includes the phrase "tee-hee-finger-in-the-mouth hop" (84), a disturbing image that suggests a bouncing child, apparently innocently delighted at the carnage. The bomb is still unmistakably fe- male, however. In one of the poem's most surreal and hilarious passages, Corso dotes on the bomb, writing affectionately: Poor little Bomb that'll never be an Eskimo song I love thee I want to put a lollipop</page><page sequence="15">Corso's Bomb 225 in thy furcal mouth A wig of Goldilocks on thy baldy bean and have you skip with me Hansel and Gretei along the Hollywoodian scene (133-39) The pity and sympathy that Corso feels for the bomb are even stronger here than in the opening section. Here, he visualizes it as childlike, a being that could be comforted with candy and drawn into a friendly brother-sister frolic. Disturbingly, however, the bomb is now literally a bomb - a blunt metal object with a "baldy bean" and "bunky seat." The image of the bomb's blank face, topped with a friendly golden wig, presents a disquietingly subversive contrast between innocence and destruction. This image may well be the key to understanding "Bomb," both in terms of Corso's initial conflict and his final resolution. The bewigged bomb both symbolizes the conflict between beauty and horror that so frustrates Corso and is shockingly, hysterically absurd - an emblem of Corso's initial inability to reconcile the opposites he perceives. Yet the indulgent attitude Corso takes toward the bomb suggests that the poet has emerged from his contemplation with an appreciation for the dual nature of reality, particularly as symbolized by the joyful disorder of postmodern pastiche. Harding notes that in India on certain feast days, three-, four-, and five-year-old girls are consecrated and worshipped as incarnations of Kali. Corso also seems to share the intuitive notion that in this paradoxical world, the destroyer and the child are two sides of the same coin, each an equally good face to put on the bomb's chaotic com- plexity. Perhaps this is an example of the numinous union of opposites that Chernus describes. Corso's vision of the bomb as a small child may also serve to put himself into a direct, personal relationship with his subject. According to Harding, the worship of Kali in human beings and in images also helps the worshippers develop a personal relationship with their goddess. To contemplate Kali as the Void is often to depersonalize the relationship, as the worshipper assumes an insignificant position in relation to the godhead. Instead, many worshippers will characterize Kali as a mother or occasionally as a sister or daughter in order to focus their adoration and contemplation. Appropriately, this part of the poem makes frequent use of the first person, and Corso imagines himself performing physical actions toward the bomb, something that does not occur elsewhere in the poem. Though the bomb has played various feminine roles (as a dark mother, and then as a daughter or perhaps sister to Corso, as suggested by "Hansel and Gretei"), it is only at the close of the poem that Corso chooses to approach it in the intimate role of a lover.</page><page sequence="16">226 Christine Hoff Kraemer O Bomb in which all lovely things moral and physical anxiously participate O fairyflake plucked from the grandest universe tree O piece of heaven which gives both mountain and anthill a sun I am standing before your fantastic lily door I bring you Midgardian roses Arcadian musk Reputed cosmetics from the girls of heaven Welcome me fear not thy opened door (140^49) The tone of this section is strangely ambiguous. The bomb's godlike attributes are pronounced: it is the fruit or the offspring of the "grandest universe tree," the might of its explosion serving as a second sun for "both mountain and anthill." Nevertheless, Corso imagines himself as an almost archetypal suitor on the doorstep of his love, bringing gifts from Edenic, mythic lands (roses from the Norse Midgard, musk from the Greek Arcadia, "reputed" (reputable?) cosmetics from an unspecified heavenly realm) to coax out his shy beloved. Corso's imagery is not unlike the writings of some mystics in their search for divine revelation. Gershom Scholem notes that the Zohar, the primary text of medieval Jewish mysticism, conceptualizes the Torah as a coy woman shut up in a palace who must be properly courted before she reveals her secrets, and even characterizes the mystic as a hopeful suitor who "haunts the gate of her house" (55). Here the text suggests that the poet is courting the true meaning of apocalypse - the divine revelation in which opposites meet. The ecstasy of the climactic lines suggests that the poet's desire to see his beloved is fulfilled. All is thrown into chaos by the bomb's jubilant explosions, and Corso rejoices wildly in the barrage: Bomb I love you I want to kiss your clank eat your boom You are a paean an acme of scream [. . .] BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM ye skies and BOOM ye suns BOOM BOOM ye moons ye stars BOOM nights ye BOOM ye days ye BOOM [. . .] ya BANG ye BONG ye BING the tail the fin the wing Yes Yes into our midst a bomb will fall Flowers will leap in joy their roots aching Fields will kneel proud beneath the halleluyahs of the wind (160- 62, 165-68, 174-76)</page><page sequence="17">Corso's Bomb 227 Robert Lifton may have described it best when he called apocalypse "the orgiastic excitement of wild forces set loose" (165) - Corso imagines na- ture itself vibrating ecstatically at the moment of destruction, responding joyously to the resulting chaos. Just as the universe, in many traditions, rejoices in its creation, Corso imagines the earth celebrating its death with equal fervor. No whimpers for Corso; his world ends with a bang. Corso's final lines make it clear that his vision is not one of literal nuclear holocaust. His bomb is much more metaphysical, symbolic of psychological and spiritual forces, not mere physical destruction. Yet not enough to say a bomb will fall or even contend celestial fire goes out Know that the earth will madonna the Bomb that in the hearts of men to come more bombs will be born magisterial bombs wrapped in ermine all beautiful and they'll sit plunk on earth's grumpy empires fierce with mustaches of gold (181-87) This passage holds Corso's final thoughts on the bomb, and in fact crypti- cally summarizes the poem's main idea. It is not enough, says the poet, for us to know that chaos (both literal and symbolic death) is assured, to argue that even the sun ("celestial fire") will eventually burn out. The poet urges the reader to realize that life itself gives rise to this chaotic force. Birth, implies Corso, ensures that there will inevitably be death; order yields to chaos, and in the end, even the mightiest empires will bow before its equal- izing might. This very Eastern conclusion summarizes one of that tradition's most troublesome truths: life is a continual struggle with irreconcilable contradictions, of which birth and death are but one inseparable pair. Throughout the poem, Corso equates the bomb with various incarna- tions of the godhead, speaking of it in religious terms and assigning it cosmic powers of creation and destruction. The poet's suggestion that the techno- logical bomb might serve as a partial replacement for God, however, carries serious metaphysical consequences. In a post-World War II world, the destructive power of the bomb is as awe-inspiringly real and terrifying as the might of a wrathful Jehovah must have seemed in a more superstitious age. Though the bomb might not have the universe-obliterating power that Corso imagines for it, nevertheless the United States alone contains enough nuclear weaponry to render Western civilization a smoking ruin, and possibly to so contaminate the rest of ecosphere as to render the earth deadly to humans for centuries to come. As China moves to expand its nuclear capabilities and reports of Russia's malfunctioning defense systems filter in, an accidental or deliberately triggered nuclear holocaust still repre- sents a compelling reinterpretation of biblical Armageddon.</page><page sequence="18">228 Christine Hoff Kraemer Significantly, however, the bomb is a creation of human beings, brought into existence by the collective will and effort of many individu- als and the tacit support and approval of millions more. To say that the bomb serves as a god-figure suggests not only that human beings have the ability to create their own gods, but also that God (in this context, the arbiter of the fate of humanity) may be in fact an extension or a kind of emergent consciousness of a people's will. Never before, however, have human beings created a god-figure that they consciously understand is under their control. With the advent of the bomb, we have been confronted with our collective ability to self-determine - with the realiza- tion, in other words, that we have the power to choose whether or not to continue to exist, and not just on an individual level. Frighteningly, how- ever, the individual gains no power from this knowledge. The collective will of the human race may still choose self-destruction, with individuals no more capable of effectively dissenting or escaping than a single cell of a human body could rebel against the whole. "Bomb" responds to this by reminding us that our lack of control is, after all, inevitable and noting that "the earth will madonna the Bomb" (183) - in other words, that cre- ation will give birth to its own end. Taken out of its metaphysical context and made tangible by examining our group tendency to stockpile the weapons of our own physical destruction, this sentiment becomes mate- rial for a deep spiritual crisis that "Bomb" only begins to explore. Though Corso does not attempt to examine the full implications of a God-bomb in his poem, he approaches the confused and chaotic world he describes with a sense of resignation, softened only by his ability to laugh. Corso's final embrace and celebration of a symbolic nuclear apocalypse suggest a belief that chaos is inevitable and inescapable; our options do not include changing the system, but only finding ways to live meaning- fully within it. For Corso, this lies in embracing, celebrating, and laughing with that chaos, as he does himself with fragmented verse and surreal humor. This acceptance, however, is not arrived at easily. To fully wrestle with our participation in the cycle of life and death requires that we deter- mine our own role - and our own responsibility - in how and whether we will continue to live. Austin, Texas NOTES 1. This comparison is made most compellingly by Ingmar Bergman's master- piece film The Seventh Seal (1957), which was released the year before "Bomb" was first published. The film is set in a plague-stricken medieval Europe and uses the Black Death to metaphorically address contemporary concerns about the bomb.</page><page sequence="19">Corso's Bomb 229 2. The selection of mainly ancient Greek elements to represent the past may not be precisely planned - Skau notes that some of the lines for "Bomb" were taken from an earlier manuscript entitled "In a Grecian Garden" (Skau, Clown 157). 3. From the Bhagavad-Gita, 11.32 (Jungk, 201). 4. A sacred book of the Shakta Tantras (Harding, xxiii). 5. Skau writes of Corso, "Like the Native American figure of Coyote, the Trick- ster, he has served as a disruptive force - self-centered, as unpredictable as a summer storm, unsettling the comfortable patterns of convention, and provoking those in contact with him to reassess their values, often much against their will" (Skau, Clown 1-2). 6. From the Mahanirvana Tantra (Harding, 47). 7. The poet writes, "I can't exist in a world that consents / a child in a park / a man dying in an electric chair" (110-11). The implication is that the poet cannot bear to live in a world that allows for such a contrast to exist. As a result, the repeated image of the electric chair serves as the poet's shorthand for the unbear- able coexistence of joy and pain that he observes. WORKS CITED "Bane bone bine."
