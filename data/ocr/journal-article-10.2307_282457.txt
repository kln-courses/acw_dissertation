<plain_text><page sequence="1">WEALTH FINANCE IN THE INKA EMPIRE: EVIDENCE FROM THE CALCHAQUI VALLEY, ARGENTINA Timothy Earle To finance their empire, the Inka empire mobilized and expropriated both staple and sumptuary goods. This paper examines the manufacture and use of wealth-associated objects in the Calchaquf Valley, located on the empire's southern periphery. Recent excavations at the imperial settlement of Potrero de Payogasta and at the local Santamariana settlement of Valdez recovered extensive manufacturing debris. Craft industries included copper, silver, and gold metallurgy; marine and land-snail shell-, stone-, and bone-bead manufacture; and mica disk cutting. At Potrero de Payogasta, the concentration of production debris in the households of the Inka elite and associated personnel represents attached specialization. Because evidence for several craft industries occurs together in individual households, related technologies were probably performed jointly. The inhabitants of the indigenous settlement, Valdez, manufactured decorative items using primarily locally available land-snail shell. At Valdez, the high frequency of ceramic molds, used in the casting of pure (unalloyed) copper, documents only initial stages of manufacture. The scarcity offinished wealth from both sites is noteworthy; although Calchaqui settlements were heavily involved in manufacture, wealth was expropriated for circulation in the Inka wealth- finance system. Para financiar su imperio, los inkas movilizaron y expropiaron tanto bienes de subsistencia como bienes suntuarios. Este articulo examina la manufactura y el uso de objetos suntuarios en el valle de Calchaquf, localizado en la periferia meridional del imperio. Excavaciones recientes en el asentamiento imperial de Potrero de Payogasta y en el asentamiento local santamariano de Valdez permitieron recobrar extensivas evidencias de manufactura. Las industrias artesanales incluyeron metalurgia de cobre, plata y oro; la manufactura de cuentas de caracoles marinos y terrestres, asi como de piedra y de hueso; y la producci6n de discos de mica. En el asentamiento inka, la concentracion de restos de producci6n dentro de las residencias de la elite inka y de personas asociadas a ellos indican especialistas dirigidos. Ya que las evidencias de multiples industrias artesanales se encuentran asociades dentro de unidades domesticas individuales, es probable que tecnologias relacionadas se realizaran en conjunto. Los habitantes del asentamiento local, Valdez, fabricaron articulos decorativos usando basicamente caracoles terrestres disponibles localmente. En Valdez, la alta frecuencia de crisoles cerdmicos, usados en el vaciado de cobre puro, documenta solamente etapas iniciales de la manufactura. La escasez de bienes suntuarios terminados en ambos sitios es notable; aunque los asentamientos calchaqui participaron intensivamente en la manufactura, estos bienes se expropiaron para restringir su circulacion al sistema inka definanciacion de riqueza. In the A.D. 1400s, the rapidly expanding Inka empire conquered the Calchaqui Valley in what is now northwestern Argentina. Why did Inka troops annex this region, located some 1,500 km by tortuous mountain road from the empire's center at Cuzco? This simple question raises complicated issues concerning the grand strategy and intricate operations of the largest Prehispanic empire of the New World (D'Altroy 1992). Although the question elicits only partial answers, because of the subtleties of human intentions and political dynamics, a central concern of any state is to finance its operations. Thus I rephrase the question more specifically to ask: How did the conquest of the Calchaqui Valley serve to finance the Inka empire? Located on the southern edge of the empire, the geographical position of the Calchaqui Valley led us to expect that the production and expropriation of wealth was a probable focus of Inka operations. Recent archaeological research at the state settlement of Potrero de Payogasta has borne out this supposition, demonstrating the direct involvement of the Inka in several craft industries.

POLITICAL FINANCE AND THE INKA EMPIRE To explain the evolution of complex societies requires an understanding of how resources are mobilized to support the activities of new institutions (Earle and D'Altroy 1989). In states, the creation of systems of taxation are basic to institutional development and maintenance. The Inka empire illustrates clearly how the political economy underlay institutional expansion. By A.D. 1400, the Inka were organized as a chiefdom, and population probably numbered in the low tens of thousands. The Inka existed in a world of warring chiefdoms, each unable to amass significant economic and political advantage to expand geographically (Hyslop 1977; Johnson and Earle 1987; Rowe 1946). Initial Inka military success set the stage for the rapid conquests of the Andean world. From Ecuador to Argentina, the army defeated more than 100 separate ethnic groups, incorporating their people and territories into a unified polity. To consolidate the conquest, the Inka maintained a large and mobile army, created a far-flung system of roads (Hyslop 1984), and constructed an extensive settlement infrastructure for ceremonies and administration (Morris 1982). Institutions of domination and integration formed the posts and beams of the empire. They created mechanisms to exert and legitimize force over a world that had been composed of many separate polities, economies, and ethnic identities. To support these new imperial institutions necessitated the development of an elaborate political economy. A political economy is the material foundation upon which complex social institutions are con- structed, and is the mechanism by which elites support the institutions on which their power, control, and legitimacy rest (Earle 1991). While the subsistence economy is primarily focused on the com- moner household and its process of making a living, the political economy involves the mobilization of resources from commoner households to finance the activities of the emerging ruling segments (Johnson and Earle 1987:11-15). Wolf (1982) refers to this mobilization as the tributary mode of production, characteristic of complex precapitalist societies. The political economy is instituted in nonindustrial states as a system of political finance. Two forms of political finance have been recognized for analytical purposes, and both played critical and complementary roles in the Inka empire (D'Altroy and Earle 1985). The first, staple finance (Earle and D'Altroy 1982; Polanyi 1968), involves state taxation in kind of such staples as grains, livestock, and clothing. Characteristically, the state, or other dominant institution, owns developed lands, and, in return for the right to use farm plots, commoner families provide labor and goods to the owner. The state holds these goods and pays them out to compensate those working for it. This form of political finance is simple and direct. By centrally managing staple production, the state mobilizes the goods needed for subsistence support of state personnel. Staple finance includes economic systems that are often referred to as "redistribution" (Earle 1977) and "mobi- lization" (Smelser 1959). Staple finance was the primary means used by the Inka to support the operations of their empire. Relying on historical documentation, John Murra (1980) described in detail the ways that staple finance operated. Lands conquered by the empire were returned for community use in exchange for corvee labor (mit'a) required of each household on a rotating basis. The state used the labor to construct state facilities, for craft manufacture and mining, and to work state agricultural lands. The maize and other crops produced on these lands were collected, stored centrally in massive warehouse facilities, and then used to support the state armies, administrators, craftsmen, and mit'a laborers. Elaborate records were kept by memory specialists using the famous knotted-string khipu (Ascher and Ascher 1981). The massive storehouses themselves have been documented archaeologically (D'Altroy 1981; Earle and D'Altroy 1982; LeVine 1992; Morris 1967). Especially in the empire's mountain core, state facilities were associated with enormous warehouse complexes that held the local agricultural produce of the state (Snead 1992). In the absence of markets and currencies, staple finance in the Inka empire was a logical and direct means to support the state's operation (LaLone 1982); it must also have been a logistical 444 [Vol. 59, No. 3, 1994</page><page sequence="3">WEALTH FINANCE IN THE INCA EMPIRE nightmare. Staple finance requires the central management of production, storage, and distribution of all the goods needed by state personnel. The state's managers had to estimate the material needs of its personnel and the labor required to meet these needs. Staples were needed daily by state personnel, but perishable foods decayed in their storage bins awaiting use. An error in judgment meant hungry state personnel or excess food rotting in the granaries. Especially problematic were the logistical problems of transportation. Staples by their very nature are heavy and bulky. Except where water transport is available, movement of staples over any distance is impractical (D'Altroy 1992; Drennan 1984; Hassig 1985). To move staple goods requires so much human labor that the staples are quickly consumed in transport, and little remains for use at the terminus. For all intents and purposes, staple finance must remain decentralized. Rather than moving the products, they must be retained in the hinterland close to their locale of production. As a consequence, staple finance is typical of fairly small-scale city states in which distance to the territorial boundaries rarely exceeds 50 km (Renfrew 1975). Where staple finance is significant in more extensive states, as in the Inka case, it is necessary to disperse state functions. Essentially the state activities become mapped on the distribution of staple production. Although this solution is certainly practical, it creates major difficulties in control for the centralized administration. A lack of centralized control over the financial structure translates into a decentralized and correspondingly weak basis of power. Among the Inka, a system of wealth finance was developed to counteract the logistical problems just described (D'Altroy and Earle 1985). Wealth finance uses valuables, primitive money, or currency (Dalton 1977) as a means of political payment. All societies have such objects, which function as personal adornments, symbols of status and position, repositories of esoteric knowledge and social history, and stores of value. These objects are made special by their rare materials, by the skilled and often sacred labor and knowledge that goes into their manufacture, and/or by their foreign origin. As elaborated by Helms (1979), for example, foreign objects can be associated with esoteric knowledge and magical power that are held by their owners. Special objects are shown in public occasions and ceremonies. Here the objects, their possession, and their use define "who is who," setting individuals within the social structure and the system of meaning that justifies that structure. These objects are given and received in socially charged ceremonies involving marriage, alliance, succession to office, and delegation of authority. What makes the wealth economy a form of finance is the ability of an elite segment or other institutional group to control the production and circulation of the wealth. Then, by directing the flow of wealth, objects can be used as political currency, exchanged for various obligations within the institutions through which elites govern. In chiefdoms, for example, prestige-goods exchange (Friedman and Rowlands 1977) is a system of wealth finance. Chiefs build their personal prestige and the dependency of their supporting population by manipulating the long-distance, ceremonial exchange of prestige goods. As described for the famous Trobriand kula exchange, chiefs establish their prestige through directing the exchange of special objects (arm rings and necklaces); the chiefs then give kula objects to their supporters who in turn give them away in social exchanges that establish social identity. The exchange of valuables is required at weddings, funerals, and other life-crisis ceremonies (Leach and Leach 1983). Thus chiefs extend initial control over the exchange of valuables to a secondary control over the social lives of their supporters. The exchange of wealth-associated items finances the chiefly insti- tution by requiring compensatory contributions of labor and goods to the chief. A chief who obtains an object of wealth through long-distance exchange can bestow it, often at a ceremonial occasion, on a supporter; these highly visible occasions represent acts of political payment that solidify the political hierarchy. Control over wealth upon which institutional finance rests can derive from control over either exchange or production. In Friedman and Rowlands's (1977) prestige-goods model, control rests on the dominant position of the chief in regional exchange. From ethnographic cases, such as the Trobriand Islands, we know that trade-partnership relationships are institutionalized, long standing, and often passed on from chief to chief (Malinowski 1922). Beyond this, to the degree that large canoes are needed for exchange, the ownership of the canoes by chiefs can be an opportunity for Earle] 445</page><page sequence="4">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY direct control over the exchange (Burton 1975). Among the Chumash of southern California, for example, the ownership of the large planked canoes by chiefs gave an opportunity for control of the exchange of shell beads used as a primitive currency (Arnold 1991). Control can also be exercised directly by dominating the production of wealth, exercised by having attached specialization (Brumfiel and Earle 1987; Earle 1981). In this case, the craftsmen and women are "attached" to a chief or institutions for which the wealth objects are exclusively manufactured. Characteristically such objects involve rare foreign materials, exceptional skill in manufacturing, or large amounts of labor such that it is difficult for "fakes" to be made outside of the institutional setting. Permitting archaeological identification, attached specialization takes place within the set- tlements of the elite or institutional patrons and often directly within (or immediately adjacent to) their households or buildings. This spatial association facilitates monitoring and control of the production. As a background for the analysis of the Calchaqui evidence, I review briefly what we know about the role of wealth in Andean society and how control over its production and exchange fit into the Inka political economy. Most importantly I consider how wealth finance helped to offset the logistical problems of staple finance by strengthening economic and political integration. In the Andes, the use of wealth dates back to the emergence of social complexity in the preceramic period. The most common wealth objects were items of personal decoration, such as clothing, jewelry, and headdresses (Murra 1962). Found archaeologically in both burials and household contexts, wealth objects evidently defined status. For example, the burial of an elite Wanka woman was characteristically marked by a copper tupu, or pin, used to hold a woman's shawl at the neck (Earle et al. 1987:Table 23). The ethnohistorical sources frequently mention how high-quality cloth and metal distinguished the dress of Inka lords (Murra 1962). These objects were rare because of the intrinsic scarcity of the raw materials used in their manufacture, such as gold and silver; the intensive labor as in the fine cumbi textiles; and the special manufacturing skills as in the elaborate metal objects. By controlling the production and distribution of wealth, the Inka state was able to control the status system of the local population (Costin and Earle 1989). For example, the fine cloth worn as a symbol of lordly status was manufactured by "women of the sun" who lived and worked at the Inka administrative centers, such as Hatun Xauxa in the Mantaro Valley (Cieza de Leon 1984:242- 243 [1551]; cf. Morris 1982). [T]he magnificent clothing made of cumbi worn by the caciques and lords could only be made for the Inca, and he handed it out to these lords. Apart from this, at many of the fiestas that were held during the year, as a favor to the lords, caciques, and nobles, the Inca gave out magnificent shirts and blankets, gold and silver cups, necklaces, bracelets, and other jewels of emeralds, turquoise, and other precious stones set in gold [Cobo 1979:221]. The objects of wealth signaled a place in the social structure that corresponded to rights and privileges in the economic and political system. Other items of wealth, such as ceremonial drinking cups, were associated with specific rituals. By controlling the manufacture and the distribution of these cere- monial props, the state effectively controlled the key ceremonial occasions-who could perform them and when. Control was exercised by spatial monitoring of craft production. The specialists formed production enclaves within the state administrative settlement. In addition to the weavers of fine cloth and metal craftsmen living with the Inka administrative centers, Chimu silversmiths from the north coast of Peru were moved to the highland capital of Cuzco (Murra and Morris 1976). The Inka empire used wealth finance to overcome the decentralized nature of its political economy, created by the logistical problems inherent in moving bulk staples (D'Altroy and Earle 1985). Wealth finance extended and centralized economic control in the following way. Staples, mobilized from local communities, were moved to the administrative centers. Here, craftspersons living under Inka supervision were supported by the staples. The wealth that they produced could be moved to Cuzco and retained in central storehouses (Morris 1967). As needed, the wealth would then be returned to the hinterland and given to local lords. The local lords' positions were marked by Inka status 446 [Vol. 59, No. 3, 1994</page><page sequence="5">WEALTH FINANCE IN THE INCA EMPIRE symbols; leadership derived from the state and was legitimized by state rituals requiring state paraphernalia (Costin and Earle 1989). For subsistence, the lords relied on food produced in com- munity fields by corvee laborers. These "rights" were vested in the political offices held by the lords and were legitimized through ownership of the material symbols given by the Inka to compensate the lords for the administrative duties they performed for the empire. In simple terms, local staples were invested by the state in attached craft production of wealth taking place at the administrative centers. The highly valued objects could then be held centrally and moved strategically by the state to retain an integrated control over the political economy and the institutions that it financed. CORE AND PERIPHERY IN THE INKA EMPIRE Extensive research has been conducted first in the Mantaro Valley, Peru (D'Altroy 1992; D'Altroy and Hastorf 1994; Earle et al. 1980, 1987; Hastorf 1992) and now in the Calchaqui Valley, Argentina (as-yet-unpublished work currently underway by D'Altroy and colleagues). These regions held very different strategic positions in the Inka empire-the Mantaro in the core and the Calchaqui at the periphery (Figure 1). Thus the two regions most probably had divergent roles in the division of labor within the Inka political economy. For the ongoing Proyecto Arqueologico Calchaqui (PAC), the goals, field methods, and recording were directly comparable to the Mantaro Valley research. In so doing, we structured our research to recognize similarities and differences in local and state economic activities. The Mantaro Valley was in the empire's mountain core, controlled and involved directly in state agricultural development. The Mantaro is a high (3,400 m), intermontane valley surrounded by the glacial peaks of the Andes. That the region had a dense pre-Inka population is documented dra- matically by large, well-preserved settlements (Earle et al. 1987). Several mutually antagonistic, large chiefdoms each occupied a cluster of fortified settlements on the hilltops and ridges above the valley floor. Following conquest, the Mantaro Valley became a center for Inka state activities. The main north- south trunk road passed directly through the valley. Population was resettled in somewhat smaller settlements located at lower elevations. The region's economy had been based on intensive agri- culture including irrigation and drained fields. Maize would have been cultivated on the valley floor, with quinoa and potatoes on the surrounding hills (Hastorf 1992), and llamas would have been pastured on the puna grassland above. Overall the economy showed remarkable stability, although the Inka state effected selective changes to integrate the region into the state (Costin et al. 1989; D'Altroy 1992; Earle 1985). Nowhere is the system of staple finance so visible as in the Mantaro Valley. Even today, the storage silos stand prominently on the hills above the ruins of Hatun Xauxa and line the slopes that bound the valley to east and west. Within 10 km of Hatun Xauxa, more than 2,000 individual storage silos have been recorded (D'Altroy 1981, 1992; D'Altroy and Earle 1992). These silos are arranged in formal lines of either circular or rectangular structures that suggest both state planning and an accounting function. Along the weste side wof the river, the storage complexes are spread out immediately above a strip settlement of local people. On the western side, extensive storage sites are found near prime agricultural lands but without associated local settlements, and here the state may have developed a system of state farms as described for Cochabamba and Abancay (D'Altroy 1992; LaLone and LaLone 1987). Outside the empire's mountainous central core, storage complexes such as those of the Mantaro Valley have rarely been described (Snead 1992). In most cases, storage beyond the core area was comparatively small scale and directly associated with administrative settlements, probably for their direct support. The limited scale and distribution of storage on the peripheries suggest that these more remote outposts were important not for amassing staples but for acquiring wealth. In Ecuador, for example, Salomon (1986, 1987) describes how the Inka state worked through the chiefly elite and their specialized traders to procure gold and feathers from beyond the empire's borders.

Map of the Inka empire, showing the road system as reconstructed by Hyslop (1984). design of the Argentinean project capitalizes on the opportunity to investigate the proposed role of wealth extraction from the peripheries of the empire for the developing political economy. The Calchaqui Valley was positioned on the margins of the Inka empire. Located at 2,500 m asl in an arid intermountain valley, the northern Calchaqui is a rural, thinly populated region of Salta Province. Prehistorically the region was home to various Santamariana chiefdoms. Subsistence depended on irrigated farming of maize and quinoa along the streams and camelid herding at higher elevations. Settlements comprised a two-tiered a two-tiered hierarchy-(1) town-size settlements, like La Paya, contained centrally placed public structures near open plazas and several hundred residential com- pounds with one or more circular houses built within massive rubble walls that enclosed private spaces; and (2) smaller settlements that contained 10 or more scattered houses without evident formal arrangement. We are conducting a detailed site survey to document this apparent settlement pattern. The local archaeological assemblage is known for dramatic anthropomorphic urns and for its tin-bronze-casted metallurgy (Ambrosetti 1908). Following conquest, the Inka empire extended its high-elevation trunk road through the valley and built there a series of administrative and military settlements (Hyslop 1984:168-188).

No large-scale storage facilities have been described for the valley; rather small com- plexes are found within both Inka and local settlements where they likely provided immediate support. Analyses in progress by D'Altroy and colleagues of botanical remains from Potrero de Payogasta suggest that staple goods were produced and processed immediately around the site such that the staple-finance system may have been minimally elaborated. During the first field season, we excavated extensively at the Inka administrative settlement of Potrero de Payogasta and less thoroughly at the local Santamariana settlement of Valdez. These excavations provide an opportunity to evaluate the different activities taking place within the state and local settlements and allow us to describe the contrast between the activities of the state in the core region of the Mantaro with the peripheral region of the Calchaqui. My research focuses on small-scale production industries that concentrated on the manufacture of wealth-associated goods. WEALTH USE AND PRODUCTION IN THE CALCHAQUI The manufacture and circulation of wealth were of special concern to our investigations. Based on the the ethe aborated earlier, we wanted to see whether the Inka state co-opted the system of wealth finance (Costin and Earle 1989; D'Altroy and Earle 1985; Earle and D'Altroy 1989). To investigate the role of wealth finance in the Inka empire as it expanded rapidly to the south, we wanted to evaluate four critical questions: (1) Did wealth exist in the economy of the Calchaqui? (2) Was this wealth in forms that could have been controlled effectively by the state? (3) Was the manufacture of wealth concentrated within Inka state facilities in the Calchaqui? (4) Was the weath of Calchaqui then exported for use in state finance? Objects of Wealth In answer to the Questions 1 and 2, wealth in the form of decorative items certainly existed in the Calchaqui sites, but it was unexpectedly rare, being found in finished form primarily in burials.

Groupings of objects are as follows: left, man- ufacturing debris; center, unfinished pieces; right, finished wealth-associated goods. All pieces illustrated are from Potrero de Payogasta. The materials from which the wealth was manufactured could in part have been controlled because they were moved long distance over the Inka roads. On the roads were many state facilities to monitor movement (D'Altroy 1992). Marine shells came from the Pacific coast. The finished copper objects were alloyed with nonlocal tin, imported from Bolivia. Other materials-including mica, turquoise, bone, and copper-were procured within the Calchaqui region, and their control would have been more difficult to achieve. Sumptuary goods recovered in our excavations included beads and other items of personal dec- oration (Table 1). Beads are made of marine shell (including various Pacific Coast genera-Meso- desma, Ollivela, and Spondylus), with additional examples of local land snail, stone (especially turquoise), bone, and human teeth (Figure 2). Beads are typically small, simple, and round (Figure 2.3k-n)-shell, 3.5-5.0 mm in diameter and .7-1.2 mm thick; stone, 2.0-6.6 mm in diameter and .7-2.8 mm thick. A few of each type are significantly larger (Figure 2.3h)-shell, 8.6-9.4 mm in diameter and 2.0-3.3 mm thick; stone, 9.1-11.4 mm in diameter and 4.5-13.5 mm thick. One tubular bead (Figure 2.3i) is made from Spondylus. Several examples of small pendant beads include examples of sea shell (Figure 2.3k) and an adult human incisor drilled through the root for suspension (Figure 2.2b). Thin mica sheets were also cut into disks (Figure 2.4h, j) and into simple geometric plaques (Figure 2.4k-n) that were perforated, presumably to be sewn onto clothing as the original sequins. One ear spool, cut in the form of a fish, was fashioned from a llama humerus. The only finished metal object recovered was a small silver clip (Figure 2. le). Finished wealth items were rare in our excavations when compared to recovery rates from the Mantaro Valley. To calculate the frequency of rare items, we used a measure of ubiquity-the proportion of our excavated unit/levels with an object present (Dennell 1976). We were careful to use this measure only within comparable deposits (primary household trash vs. ceremonial contexts), and where the number of excavated proveniences exceeded 20. At Hatunmarca and Marca, Late Horizon Wanka settlements in the Mantaro Valley, finds included a wide range of bronze and silver disks, tupu pins, tumis, needles, and other items. For the Late Horizon, finished metal objects were 450 [Vol. 59, No. 3, 1994</page><page sequence="9">WEALTH FINANCE IN THE INCA EMPIRE Table 2.

In contrast, at Potrero de Payogasta, the full list of finished wealth included only the silver clip, bone ear spool, and a few dozen beads. Ubiquity of the finished metal was only .3 percent and for the marine shell beads was 3.3 percent. At Valdez, no finished metal was recovered, and bead ubiquity was 1.2 percent from household contexts (that is 1 bead from 83 excavated collections). Based on their rarity in general contexts, decorative items of wealth appear to have been used rarely in daily life. No Late Period burials were excavated by PAC, but we know of wealth recovered by earlier excavations (Ambrosetti 1908; Gonzalez 1979). From the nearly two hundred tombs excavated from La Paya, a large, local Santamariana settlement, wealth included elaborate ceramics, bead strings, and 35 metal objects. One large mica sheet was also recovered. Most of the metal was tin bronze in such forms as axes, awls, tweezers, and tumis; one silver and two gold objects were included in the inventory. An impressive thin gold-sheet diadem was one of these items. Although local wealth certainly existed, it must have been carefully curated, entering the archaeological record almost exclusively through burial ritual. Production of Wealth In contrast to the comparative rarity of finished wealth from our Calchaqui excavations, evidence for the manufacture of metal, shell, stone, and mica wealth was abundant (Table 1; Figure 2). To answer Questions 3 and 4, craft manufacture of wealth was directly attached to Inka facilities, where it would have been carefully monitored. Interestingly, the control over the production process appears to have been highly selective. At least some regulation over wealth manufacture may have been made by controlling very specific moments in the economic process, such as the movement of the shell and tin, and by using this selective command to manage craft industries and wealth finance more broadly. The extensive evidence for manufacture, in contrast to the scarce evidence for finished objects, suggests that much of the locally produced wealth was exported from the region. This may have been especially true for the copper produced in the Calchaqui. The manufacture of metal involved three steps, the evidence for which is summarized in Table Earle] 451</page><page sequence="10">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY a 5 cm Figure 3. Ceramic molds from AD 1 at Valdez, used for casting copper ingots. 2. First was primary mining and smelting of ore. Initial extraction took place in one of many small- scale mines exploiting superficial copper ores. At La Encrucijada, located approximately 50 km to the north of our sites, an open-pit mine was located adjacent to relatively large ore grinders and smelting furnaces (Rodriguez Orrego 1979). Within our sites, the presence of small bits of nonlocally occurring copper ore suggests that some primary smelting took place here as well. Analysis of these samples and residue from molds shows that the majority of the ores were chlorides such as atacamite and paratacamite (Howe 1992). Mining of such ores would have been fairly straightforward because deposits were superficial. Primary processing would have involved crushing and heating, both simple procedures for these ore types. Second was the secondary processing of the metal into pure copper ingots, produced using simple pyrotechnic and ceramic technologies. No evidence of furnaces or pipes was found, but 21 ceramic molds, including several with metallic copper residues (Figure 3), and one probable crucible were recovered. Because metallurgical slag was very rare on our sites, we concluded that most primary processing took place elsewhere. The presence of many examples of a frothy nonmetallurgical slag, however, suggests intense burning, quite probably from the wasting of the ceramic molds, many of which show vitrification resulting from excessive heat (Howe 1992). In several architectural divisions at Potrero, we encountered large burned areas within structures; these were associated with other evidence of metallurgical activities. Third was the final fabrication, involving alloying, casting, hammering, and cutting. In Potrero, excavations recovered three ex- amples of folded sheets of gold scrap (Figure 2.1 a-c) with evidence of casting and cutting and one scrap of cast copper (Figure 2. Id). Evidence for the production of beads includes various stages in their manufacture (Figure 2). The shell was procured both from the Pacific Coast and from regional forest zones. Concentrations of shell debris, occasionally with distinctively cut edges (Figure 2.3a), are frequently recovered in excavated contexts. Unfinished bead blanks (Figure 2.3b-d) and beads broken in the process of drilling or grinding (Figure 2.3e-g) were also found. The unfinished beads may be undrilled, rough blanks, partially drilled and broken beads, or unpolished beads. 452 [Vol. 59, No. 3, 1994</page><page sequence="11">WEALTH FINANCE IN THE INCA EMPIRE / - 11 ,--) 15 /Ti 21 - 9' ^ ,,.a,&gt; &gt; 0 25 50 m 0 . :-A ^; 0 \ 1.\ Figure 4. Map of Potrero de Payogasta. Excavated architectural divisions are indicated by numbers. Evidence for the manufacture of mica includes abundant mica debitage. In Potrero, all patio groups had mica debris, and two groups (AD 5 and AD 14; "AD" refers to architectural divisions at the site, which are numbered sequentially) had unusually high ubiquity values of 55.6 percent and 40.0 percent, respectively. Much of this waste is nondiagnostic, but because the material does not occur locally, its distribution is probable evidence for manufacture. Several large pieces of unworked mica were collected from Potrero. Smaller debris was found with cut edges suggesting the negative forms of the finished objects, such as a disk (Figure 2.4c-d), and with distinctive scoring marks of the original cutting (Figure 2.4a-b, e). Incomplete discs and other pendants were probably ripped during cutting (Figure 2.4f-j). Associated obsidian flakes may have been used in the man- ufacture of mica ornaments. To evaluate the evidence for craft production in the Calchaqui, I will look first at the Inka administrative settlement of Potrero de Payogasta (Figure 4). This settlement is located along the Inka road in a thinly settled side valley of the Calchaqui. It is the primary imperial center in the region. Potrero is divided into two main sectors. The civic-ceremonial precinct is located on the northern third of the settlement across a lower saddle of the main ridge. The precinct includes a number of architectural divisions: a large enclosed plaza (AD 15) with a central usnu platform, a kallanka (gabled roof, rectangular building [AD 17]), and several special compounds (e.g., AD 21). Dignitaries would have been hosted and public state events would have been staged in the ceremonial precinct. Running south from the plaza is the ridge that dominates the settlement's layout. On the 453 Earle]</page><page sequence="12">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY very top of this ridge are several patio groups with rectangular houses (e.g., AD 4 and AD 7) that we believe were residences of the Inka lords. Two large circular buildings (e.g., AD 14) were located down the ridge at a somewhat lower position, directly above the plaza. Along the edges of the central ridge were a number of residential terraces (e.g., AD 5 and AD 16). A secondary ridge with simpler residential compounds (e.g., AD 9) extends to the west. At Potrero, evidence for manufacturing in all industries is fairly abundant. Productive activities were documented in the following frequencies: metallurgical debris in 7.5 percent of all unit/levels, marine shell debris in 7.5 percent, and mica debris in 21.6 percent. In contrast, evidence for metallurgy at Wanka settlements in the Mantaro Valley during the Late Horizon was ephemeral- only 1.4 percent unit/levels yielding metal ore (Owen 1994). No evidence existed there for the manufacture of marine shell or mica. In the Calchaqui Valley, it is evident that craft production was comparatively common within the Inka settlement. The internal pattern of manufacturing debris throughout Potrero demonstrates that craft pro- duction took place within households closely associated with the elite residential area. An obvious division seen in the archaeological evidence distinguishes the activities of the northern civic- ceremonial district and the main residential precinct to the south (Table 1). Despite extensive excavation, little manufacturing debris was recovered from the northern third of the site. The ubiquity values are as follows: metals, 1.5 percent; marine shell, 2.9 percent; mica, 7.4 percent. In all cases only the odd piece of shell or mica was recovered; no concentrations suggest manufacturing locations. This lack of a state institutional context for craft production contrasts with that noted at Huanuco Pampa by Craig Morris (1982), who describes a special architectural compound, directly off the central plaza, where evidence of textile production was concentrated. At Potrero, craft production clearly took place within households. All five residential units on the central ridge (AD 4, AD 5, AD 7, AD 14, and AD 16) were involved in small-craft manufacturing (Table 1). The larger residences (AD 4 and AD 7), which we suspect to have been the residence of Inka lords, were directly involved in metal production (Table 2). In the large rectangular building in AD 4, we recovered copper ore, a probable crucible fragment, and several examples of nonmetallic slag. A broad firing feature was located on the floor against the eastern wall of the structure. In the somewhat smaller rectangular structure in AD 7 we recovered three scrap pieces of gold sheet that had been cast and then cut with a chisel-type tool; pock marks on the surface might indicate cementation (Howe 1992). Two of the pieces had been folded as if to prepare them for reuse. It seems highly likely that this elite residence was the location for fabrication of gold pieces, perhaps like the head ornament recovered from La Paya (see Ambrosetti 1908). On the terrace AD 5, immediately below the elite patio AD 4, a second broad firing feature was located within a smaller rectangular structure. This firing feature was associated with copper ore, a possible piece of copper slag, nonmetallic slag, and the piece of cast (alloyed?) copper scrap showing gouge marks and scoring. The large circular structure in AD 14 contained another possible firing feature, copper ore, two mold fragments, and some nonmetallic slag. Evidence for the production of the small decorative items of shell, stone, and mica was found commonly in AD 7 and AD 14, which are thought to be fairly high-ranking households based on their location and impressive architecture. The highest density of the mica manufacturing waste was found, however, not in the highest elite house (AD 4), but in the houses (AD 5 and AD 16) located just off the top of the ridge. The structure in AD 16 was circular, indicating probably a non- Inka occupant, in contrast to the Inka-style buildings in AD 4 and AD 7. The close spatial association suggests that this family of local craftspersons was probably attached to the nearby Inka patrons. Interestingly the high density of craft activities on the top of the settlement, which we believe to be the elite residential core, contrasts with the very low density of manufacturing debris recovered from the residential excavation (AD 9) located on the side ridge, removed from the elite compounds. The high density and distribution of manufacturing at the Inka administrative site of Potrero is unambiguous evidence of attached specialization. Craft manufacture took place both within elite residences and in local residences immediately associated with the elite residential sector. Substan- tially less manufacturing apparently took place in other residential areas and in the ceremonial precinct. 454 [Vol. 59, No. 3, 1994</page><page sequence="13">WEALTH FINANCE IN THE INCA EMPIRE The distribution pattern of wealth debris highlights the generalized character of craft production. The craft industries involving stone and shell beads and the mica sequins were repeatedly found in the same households (AD 7, AD 14, and AD 16). Also found in these houses was evidence of obsidian manufacture, suggesting that the households were involved in generalized cutting and drilling industries for a range of small-scale decorative crafts. Because manufacturing processes were apparently fairly simple and easily transferable from industry to industry, various kinds of craft production took place together. This joining of industries would seem appropriate and effective where the overall level of production was not high and the technology of production was not high and the technology of production was simple and transferable across multiple tasks. Generalized craft industries may have characterized many relatively simple, small-scall-scale craft manufactures in world prehistory. In Oaxaca, at the site of Ejutla, Feinman and Nicholas (1991, 1993) describe conjoined small-scale production of stone and marine-shell beads requiring directly similar technologies for cutting, grinnd i g. The diameter of the bead holes appears to be standardized across materials, suggesting that the same drills were used for all bead materials. Control over craft production can be maintained eit y estricting access to a rare made terial or by managing a complicated step in the production process for which technical knowledge was limited. For the production of the beads, the manufacturing techniques were elemental. Control over the production of this wealth was apparently maintained in the Inka empire through control over the availability of sea shell. Then, to the degree that other materials were manufactured by the same craftspersons living under Inka supervision, a monopoly could be maintained over the generalized industry. In this case, control over the production of shell, imported long distances along the Inka road, extended to partial control over other related craft industries. In analyzing the cerables and the ceramic crucibles and molds from the Calchaqui sites, Hagstrum (1992, 1993) has developed the concept of intersecting technologies. Summarized briefly, she argues that pyro- technic procedures that included technical knowledge of clay, fuel, and fire were common to both ceramic and metal manufacture. Metallurgical processing also requires specific ceramic tools, e.g., crucibles and molds. At the Calchaqui sites, where ceramic materials and forming techniques appear similar for both cooking vessels and the ceramic tools of metallurgy, they would probably have been manufactured by the same artisans. It may well be that the two industries (metal and ceramics), at least where they are technically simple as in the Calchaqui case, were intertwined. Supporting this supposition, we recovered evidence of ceramic manufacture (an unfired base of a cooking pot) from the elite patio AD 4 where evidence of the metal production was also found. The important point is that the production processes controlled by the Inka involved multiple industries with cross-cutting technologies such that control over one aspect could extend into much broader control. The pattern at Potrero may now be compared to the production evidence from a nonstate settlement. The site of Valdez was selected for excavation to represent a local, Inka-period settlement. It is the closest known large Santamariana settlement to the Inka settlement of Potrero, and we expected that Valdez would have contained the residences of local lords and that local craft specialization might be associated with them. Valdez consists of approximately 500 mounds distributed across 50 ha on a gently rolling land surface near the Calchaqui River. Mounds represent both collapsed houses and trash heaps. Some distinction in status may be documented by larger mounds that are located toward the settlement's center. Overall, however, the residential arrangement does not suggest planning (DeMarrais 1993). At Valdez, the evidence for specialized manufacture is more limited and specific than at Potrero de Payogasta. The primary evidence for bead-manufacturing debris was from land snails and stone. The regional availability of these materials may have made them comparatively difficult for the Inka to control. Working debris from land-snail shell was recovered in three of the four household excavations. From the two households for which adequate data are available, overall ubiquity of land-snail debris is 7.2 percent. In comparison, marine-shell debris was recovered from only 1.2 percent of the unit/levels. Mica debris was also rare (1.2 percent), found only as very small and scattered bits that may not have been the result of manufacture. No large mica sheets, debris with cut marks, or unfinished items were found. Despite an extensive lithic industry, including the importation and working of considerable obsidian, the bead and sequin industry was very limited. Earle] 455</page><page sequence="14">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY The Inka empire selectively controlled the manufacture of the small decorative items that were most likely used locally to define status. Mica production was strongly concentrated within the Inka administrative settlement. For shell manufacture, although local land-snail beads were made at Valdez, marine-shell items were made primarily at the state settlement. The state apparently con- trolled production of marine-shell (as opposed to land-snail) beads by controlling the long-distance movement of the shell from the Pacific. For metal manufacturing, the evidence is quite different. The primary indication is the presence of many ceramic molds on Valdez. Molds have heavy bases, flaring lips, and regular oblong troughs that suggest their use to cast ingots (Hagstrum 1992). Pure copper was still adhering to the insides of several molds, indicating that they were used to make the copper ingots prior to alloying with tin, thus representing an early stage in metal processing (Howe 1992). The broad and even distri- bution of copper ore across the residential contexts from the settlement of Valdez suggests that metal processing was conducted within many local households. The copper molds were significantly more common at one household, but this may be simply the result of an admittedly small sample. In any case, the number of the molds from Valdez outnumber those from any contexts at Potrero. The overall ubiquity of the molds was 12.0 percent. Although no large burning features were described, this absence may simply reflect the limited extent of our excavations. At Valdez the local population participated broadly in one key step in the manufacture of wealth- associated goods, namely the casting of copper ingots. This simple technology took place within local residences. The broad distribution of manufacturing debris shows no association with elite residential areas, suggesting little local elite control over the manufacturing process. How then was copper production controlled, if in fact it was controlled? Mining apparently took place in many surface exposures. Many households at the local settlement participated in secondary processing of copper into ingots, using indigenous technologies for copper extraction and processing. This dispersed and uncontrolled initial procurement and processing of metal ore may make economic sense. For the comparable case of traditional gold mining in West Africa, local household labor, actually women, independently worked surface mines (Dumett 1993). These women, with their experience in both food preparation and cooking, had knowledge of basic West African met- allurgical skills and worked the metal within domestic contexts. Elemental food-processing equip- ment was used for initial crushing and grinding of the ores. Because surface mining required large amounts of minimally skilled labor, little would have been gained by central management. For the traditional West African states, rather than attempting to control initial household metal production, chiefs controlled only the long-distance caravan trade in finished metals. Among the Inka in the Calchaqui Valley, a directly analogous situation may have existed. Copper- chloride ores would have been mined from surface deposits without complex procedures. Initially, extraction and processing were likely to have been technically simple, taking place within local households and probably involving domestic technologies such as the grinding equipment and pyrotechnology used in food preparation and ceramic manufacture. Importantly, the metallurgical technology described at Valdez was the same as that documented for the imperial settlement, Potrero de Payogasta. This comparability of technologies suggests that the local population provided crafts- men and women to work the metals at the state facilities as well. Lechtman (1979) observed, and Owen (1994) and Costin et al. (1989) later confirmed, that the Inka empire is associated with a tin-bronze horizon. Prior to Inka conquest, local methods for alloying of copper were highly variable, but following conquest the Inka established a standard for tin alloying. Whatever the stylistic, symbolic, or utilitarian reasons for this alloying, the political effect would have been similar. Tin was more localized in its distribution (found especially in Bolivia) than copper, which is more broadly available. In our study of changing patterns of exchange following Inka conquest in the Mantaro Valley, the only significant change was the importation of tin (Earle 1985). Control over the system-wide distribution of tin, therefore, may well have provided the critical mechanism for control over the production of copper sumptuary objects. To sketch out how this might have worked for the Calchaqui region, it appears as if the primary steps in metal production included the mining of the copper ore and the production of copper ingots. Although further documentation is necessary, the available evidence for household-level production 456 [Vol. 59, No. 3, 1994</page><page sequence="15">WEALTH FINANCE IN THE INCA EMPIRE of the ingots at Valdez may indicate that copper was produced for tribute to the state. Murra (1962) describes how each family was given wool from which it had to produce a certain number of rough textiles for state use. Could this be what we are observing for household production at Valdez? The ingots would then have been transfered to the administrative administrative settlement at Potrero where, under close Inka supervision, the copper could have been alloyed with tin and fabricated into finished metal objects. Alternatively, the copper ingots could simply have been moved by the Inka for central fabrication near Cuzco or elsewhere. In eithe he control over the tin would have translated into a control over the production of metal wealth-associated goods. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS To summarize the results of the rre search in the Calchaqui Valley, it is important to return to the critical contrast observed in the two parallel projects. In the Mantaro Valley, located in the empire's core where a dense local population existed, imperial finance focused on the development of agricultural production as seen dramatically in the extensive state storage facilities found in the valley. Although finished objects of wealth were quite common in household contexts, evidence for their manufacture was rare. In the Calchaqui Valley, located on the empire's periphery in a region with region with relatively low pop- ulation densities, staple finance seems to have been comparatively undeveloped. No evidence exists for large-scale staple storage. Imperial finance in the Calchaqui region focused instead on development of wealth manufacture. Even though finished decorative wealth in everyday contexts was rare, wealth manufacture was apparently quite common. Perhaps delivered as tribute, copper ingots were produced within the households at local settlements; control was exercised in this context by restricting access to tin needed to produce the finished bronze goods associated with the Inka empire. The finished metal objects were produced within the administrative settlement and probably within state facilities elsewhere. Small-scale decorative wealth was manufactured in the Calchaqui Valley by specialists, who produced beads and bangles from a variety of materials including materials that were obtained from a distance (marine shell) and from within the broader region (mica, turquoise, bone, etc.). It appears that the bead industry was controlled selectively by the Inka overlords through their ability to control access to nonlocal shell and the close attachment of specialists to Inka residential compounds. Why did the Inka army conquer the Calchaqui Valley? The conquest appears to have been motivated by the local availability of metals and perhaps other local resources used in the manu- facture of wealth-associated goods. The population's technical experience with metal manufacture would also have been highly desirable. In the Calchaqui, on the peripheries of the Inka empire, the state appears to have extracted local metal as tribute produced by m'ita labor. These metals and other special materials would then have been fabricated into sumptuary goods by local attached specialists working under conditions of close supervision. Both the finished metal items and pro- cessed materials like the copper ingots were then exported for use within the imperial economy. Acknowledgments.
