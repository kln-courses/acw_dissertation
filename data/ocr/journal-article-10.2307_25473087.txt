Long before March of the Penguins, Walt Disney had turned Pablo the penguin and other assorted animated and real feathered friends into Hollywood stars. Well before Winged Migration, the famous British filmmaker, John Grierson, whose camera illuminated the life of British working people during the Great Depression, captured the spectacular journey of birds across the Western hemisphere in his 1942 film, High Over the Borders. When the box office revenues of Happy Feet, featuring animated dancing penguins, exceeds those of Casino Royale, where beautiful bodies and action-packed adventure abound, the public appeal of birds on film merit comment. Winged Migration, the acclaimed 2001 French documentary directed by Jacques Perrin, is my entree into this essay on birds, movies, and environmental history. It took more than 450 people, 17 pilots, 14 cinematographers, and sophisticated bird-rearing techniques, planes, gliders, helicopters, and balloons to capture the migration of dozens of species of birds across seven continents. Bird watching never required a more intensive investment in labor and technology. As the film's spectators, we take part in a breathtaking and sometimes dizzying movement of scale from the intimate close-up of a bird in flight to satellite images where migrating flocks are visible specks in a panorama of continental landforms and oceans. The human body has seemingly been transcended. Technology renders an intimacy that the human eye alone could not achieve. Suspended in air high above the ocean, we look upon a gannet in wonderment. It is a wonder evoked by being an intimate witness to this poetry in flight, but also by a lurking question of what technological wonders have made such intimacy possible. Winged Migration is much more than the stated story of a "promise to return"; it is a story of coadaptation between humans and wildlife. To achieve such spectacular footage, birds were imprinted on humans and their flying machines. Carroll Ballard employed such techniques in his 1996 film, Fly Away Home. But while Fly Away Home at times used the imprinting of birds on people to interrogate categories of nature and culture, Winged Migration seeks to hide the human in the life of birds, except for the negative impact of hunters and industrial pollution. The repetitiveness of overhead shots of V-f lying formations, and an accompanying soundtrack of sometimes lulling Gregorian-like chants, offer a meditation on the timelessness of nature. "For eighty million years," the narration reminds us, "birds have ruled the skies, seas, and earth," in a never-ending cycle of seasonal migration. But the landmarks visible along their flight paths-the Eiffel Tower, the Great Wall of China, and, in times past, the World Trade Center-are also reminders that time stands still for no species on earth. The histories of birds and humans are intertwined.

From Winged Migration (2001), directed by Jacques Perrin, codirected by Jacques Cluzaud and science and technology mediate the historical relations of birds and people is a subject opened up by Winged Migration, and one to which environmental historians have much to contribute. But such a move requires us to see the lives of birds and humans as coproductions. The irony is that birds never appear in the credits of Winged Migration, only people. Without either, however, no such film would exist. Still, the question remains, what is it about birds? Of the many bird species, the appeal of penguins is perhaps easiest to explain. Flightless, upright, donned in tuxedo-like garb, they are ideal anthropomorphic subjects. But what of bar headed geese, Clark's grebes, sandhill cranes, whooper swans, arctic terns, and numerous other species that appear in the film? Their sentience is less than that of chimpanzees, gorillas, and dolphins, whose likeness to humans is traded upon. It is not to the birds' sameness, unlike penguins, but to their otherness, that we need to look to understand their appeal. It is the property of flight, a promise of freedom and escape from the human condition, I suggest, that has given birds such cultural resonance. Since the early twentieth century, birds have become cultural icons of freedom and movement. When the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs sought to promote greater cultural and economic exchange between North and South America, birds became the vehicle for doing so. Grierson's film, High Over the Borders, commissioned by the OCIAA, instructs moviegoers in the folly of believing in exclusive ownership of birds through a visual tour of the flyways of Canada geese, hummingbirds, swallows, and other migratory birds that bound North and South America into a single biological, cultural, and economic region.

And we cheer for the parrot toward the end of Winged Migration as it tries to unlock the cage in which it is imprisoned, along with other animal compatriots on a boat traveling down the Amazon, snagged in the commercial net of the global pet trade. A sigh of relief comes when it succeeds in breaking free of its restraints; perhaps human domination is never complete. That, it seems, is the hope and promise of birds as moral fables of our time.
