Frisch Naval Biodynamics Laboratory New Orleans, LA ABSTRACT A modeling effort has been undertaken at the Naval Biodynamics Laboratory in New Orleans to determine the cause of atypical responses of the head/neck anatomy of certain volunteer subjects to -X vector direction acceleration profiles. The results appear to indicate that these subjects, who had been previously run in the +Y and/or -X+Y vector directions, may have learned to exert purposeful control over their head/neck responses in order to lessen the severity of their exposures. Computer simulations appear to verify the theorized explanation that the subjects "locked" their head/neck joints in anticipation of sled firing, and that the joints remained locked during the initial portion of the run until forces and torques increased to a level which forced their joints to unlock. ONE OF THE GOALS CURRENTLY BEING PURSUED at the Naval Biodynamics Laboratory (NBDL) is the identification of a mechanical head/neck linkage suitable for use in an anthropomorphic dummy. For this purpose an effort is underway to determine a parsimonious linkage between the first thoracic vertebral body (Tļ) and the head which in a statistical sense "best" simulates the three-dimensional motion of the head as measured on human subjects. Such measurements are being collected in a continuing effort at NBDL to determine the dynamic responses of volunteer subjects to impact acceleration (1,2,3,4,5,6,7)*. During the course of a modeling effort to evaluate the ability of a candidate linkage to simulate the measured kinematic response of the head when driven by the measured acceleration profile at Tļ, initially unsatisfactory results were obtained. The source of the problem was identified as an atypical measured response of the head in the particular run being modeled. Further investigation revealed that the atypical response was not an anomaly in the data, but was a characteristic of the dynamic response of the particular volunteer involved, and was seen in most of his -X vector direction (eyeballs out) acceleration exposures. Similar responses were also observed in the dynamic responses of several other volunteers. Because such atypical responses pose a serious problem to modelers and can result in model parameters which compromise the more typical response, it was believed to be important to determine the reason for such responses and to develop a mathematical model to simulate and explain them. It is the purpose of this paper to propose a theory to explain these atypical responses and to present the results of a modeling effort which tends to validate the theory. * Numbers in parentheses designate references at the end of the paper.

The linkage used was designed to reproduce the head and neck kinematic response of a particular NBDL volunteer, Subject 93. The intention was to verify the suitability of this mechanical linkage for use in a manikin by first selecting joint parameters for the linkage to simulate Subject 93 1 s -X vector direction runs. If in these runs the simulated dynamic response of the volunteer's head, when driven by his measured Tļ acceleration profile, were found to satisfactorily replicate his measured response, then the linkage would be tested similarly on +Y and -X+Y vector direction runs. (The specified vector directions indicate the direction of the thrust vector relative to the subject's gross anatomy, with -X defined in the direction from the chest to the back, +Y in the direction from the right to the left shoulder, and -X+Y approximately midway between the -X and +Y vector directions • ) In order to simplify the model and to gain some insight into the response mechanism of the head/neck system, it was decided for the purposes of the simulation to initially lock the two internal pivots of the Becker four-pivot linkage (pivots 2 and 3 in Figure 1), so that motion would be constrained to the midsagittal plane. This was justified by the fact that the dynamic response to -X acceleration is essentially planar in nature. In this way the kinematic response of the four-pivot linkage would be essentially reduced to that of the Becker two-pivot linkage (9). Since the Becker two-pivot linkage has been used successfully to simulate the measured dynamic response to -X impact acceleration (9), similar success was anticipated in simulations using the four-pivot linkage with the internal pivots locked. That is, it was anticipated that parameter fits for forcing elements at the head/neck joint and the neck/torso joint of the type used by Becker in his two-pivot linkage could be found that would permit satisfactory simulations of Subject 93 's measured head kinematic response in his various -X acceleration runs in the NBDL data base. One of Subject 93 's high peak sled acceleration -X runs, LX3583, was initially selected for the modeling effort. Computer simulations were made for this run using only * U. S. Patent No. 4,395,235 forcing elements consisting of springs and dashpots of the type employed by Becker. However, it was found that parameter values for the forcing elements which permitted the replication of the magnitude and the time of the maximum head angular acceleration did not satisfactorily predict other important aspects of the subject's kinematic response. The inadequacy of this approach may be seen in Figure 2, in which the subject's predicted and measured head rotational responses are compared . Of course, the problem in the simulation could have been a result of the particular linkage configuration used. However, it is believed that the reason for the inadequate simulation for run LX3583 is suggested by comparing the plot of measured head angular acceleration for run LX3583 in Figure 3 with head angular acceleration profiles, presented in Figures 4 and 5 for runs LX3949 and LX3970. The head angular acceleration profiles for LX3949 and LX3970 are typical of the responses observed in the vast majority of -X vector direction runs in the NBDL data base. However Subject 93 's head angular acceleration profile in LX3583 differed significantly from those shown in Figures 4 and 5. His response was characterized by an early rise in head angular acceleration and a small but significant peak in head angular acceleration which preceded a significantly L 16.17 Cm.

Hence, since all subjects were equally aware of the impending impact, it is obvious that the degree of awareness of impact cannot be used to explain the varying dynamic responses. For the purposes of this paper an atypical response can be identified by a measured head angular acceleration profile characterized by an initial positive peak which precedes the maximum head angular acceleration peak, and which exceeds 15% of the magnitude of the maximum head angular acceleration. This relatively large ratio of initial peak to maximum peak acceleration is caused both by the increased magnitude of the initial peak and by the attenuated value of the following major peak. This criterion was applied to a group of seventy high peak sled acceleration -X runs in the NBDL data base, and fifteen of the seventy were thereby classified as atypical. Eleven of the fifteen atypical responses were, however, found in a small group of subjects, including Subject 93, who had been run in the +Y and/or -X+Y vector direction prior to their -X acceleration runs, and were therefore considered "experienced" subjects. In fact, atypical responses were generally observed in the -X sled runs for four of the five subjects who comprised this experienced group. For example, Subject 83, who was the only volunteer other than Subject 93 to be run in both the +Y and -X+Y vector directions prior to his -X test series, and Subject 105, who was run only in the -X+Y vector direction before his -X runs, both generally exhibited atypical dynamic responses, similar to those found in Subject 93. This may be seen in Figures 8 and 9, which present measured head angular acceleration for runs LX3544 and LX3581. On the other hand, experienced Subject 106 did not exhibit an atypical dynamic response, as may be seen in Figure 10, which presents his measured head angular acceleration for run LX3575. Table 1 lists the experienced volunteers, together with their acceleration exposures prior to their -X runs, and indicates the type of dynamic response they generally exhibited. Experienced subjects exhibiting atypical dynamic responses did not, however, necessarily have this type of response in every -X acceleration exposure. Also, two inexperienced volunteers, Subjects 131 and 132, were found to exhibit atypical responses in a number of their -X runs, although generally not to the degree exhibited by the experienced subjects. A plot of peak head angular acceleration versus peak sled acceleration for the previously mentioned group of seventy low onset long duration (LOLD) sled runs in the NBDL data base has been presented in Figure 11. The plotted values were read manually from readily available plotted data. This figure shows the peak head angular acceleration for volunteers who exhibited atypical dynamic responses (plus symbol), as well as for subjects exhibiting a more typical dynamic response (square symbol). Figure 11 clearly shows the significant attenuation of the peak head angular acceleration that is associated with the atypical response.

It should be pointed out that other modeling efforts which used the NBDL -X vector data base for model validation (9,10,11) were based on previously reported data which exhibited the more typical dynamic response of the head and neck. Hence, problems resulting from atypical dynamic responses were not encountered by these modelers.

Head Angular Acceleration Versus Peak Sled Acceleration for -X Low Onset Long Duration Sled Runs the predicted from the measured head response at approximately 75 msec, and, as might be expected, the simulation does not achieve the maximum head angular acceleration exhibited by the measured response. Nevertheless, the above observation was helpful in the formulation of a theory to explain the observed atypical dynamic responses to -X impact acceleration. The atypical response was generally found to be a characteristic of experienced subjects. In addition, it was found that in runs exhibiting this profile the predicted head angular acceleration initially tended to replicate the trend of the predicted response obtained by locking the head/neck joint. Therefore, it was theorized that the experienced subjects learned to exert purposeful control over the response of the head and neck to impact acceleration by locking the head/neck joint until the forces and torques increased to a level which forced the joint to unlock. By locking the joint in this manner, the subject could minimize the angular velocity of the head relative to the neck at which the head/neck joint stop began to load, thereby reducing the peak head angular acceleration he experienced.

SEEMANN, ET AL. to investigate the validity of the theorized explanation for the atypical response to -X acceleration profiles and to simulate the atypical dynamic response of the head. METHOD COMPUTER PROGRAM USED FOR SIMULATION - A modified version of the Calspan 3-Dimensional Crash Vehicle Simulation Computer Program (3DCVS) (12) was used to simulate the dynamic response of the head to an input acceleration profile at Tļ. The routines that compute flexural and viscous joint torque were rewritten to permit the use of forcing elements (spring and dashpot functions) of the type used by Becker (9). The new routine computes zero flexural spring torque until the joint limiting angle (joint stop) is reached, at which point a linear spring is introduced. The magnitude and direction of the torques exerted are indicated in Figure 13 for the head/neck joint and in Figure 14 for the neck/torso joint. The new routine also permits the specification of a time at which the head/neck joint unlocks, and the time interval over which the internal joint constraint torque about the axis of rotation decreases linearly to zero. The time criterion, rather than the magnitude of the torque, was used for unlocking the joint, in order to facilitate the identification of suitable joint parameters for the modeling effort. It was also used because the torque at which the joint unlocks could presumably be varied by the subject and could be affected by other circumstances of the run. The new routine also permits the specification of different viscous damping coefficients for positive and negative relative angular velocity of the segments connected by a joint. DEFINITIONS OF COORDINATE SYSTEMS: 1 . Laboratory Coordinate System - The laboratory coordinate system is a non-translating, non-rotating orthogonal right hand triad fixed in the laboratory. The X axis is located along the center line between two benchmark buttons, which are permanently machined in the sled. The positive direction is in opposition to the thrust vector of the accelerator. The Z axis is in the opposite direction of the local gravity vector. The Y axis is defined in the direction of the cross product Z X X. The origin of the laboratory coordinate system is the location of the top surface center of the benchmark button situated at the front of the sled at the time prior to the run. 2. Sled Coordinate System - The sled coordinate system is a non-rotating orthogonal right hand triad with axes oriented parallel to the laboratory coordinate system. The origin of the sled coordinate system is coincident with the laboratory system prior to the run and translates with the sled. 3. Head Anatomical Coordinate System - The head anatomical coordinate system is an orthogonal right hand triad fixed in the head and defined as follows: Points on the skin over the left and right infraorbital notches and at the superior edge of the left and right external auditory meati are labeled with radiopaque markers. A plane is established as the best least squares fit to these four markers. This is approximately the Frankfort plane. The origin of the head anatomical coordinate system is at the midpoint of the line connecting the left and right external auditory meati markers in the plane. The +X axis is from the origin to a point between the infraorbital notches. The +Z axis is from the origin to a cephalad direction perpendicular to the plane formed by the +X axis and the line between the auditory meatus markers. The +Y axis is from the origin toward the left ear perpendicular to the XZ plane. The XZ plane is considered the midsagittal plane. The approximate location of the head anatomical coordinate system with respect to the Becker linkage is indicated in Figure 1 • 4. The T] Anatomical Coordinate System - The Tļ anatomical coordinate system is an orthogonal right-hand triad fixed to the first thoracic vertebral body, Tļ , as previously defined (1,13). The origin is at the anterior superior corner of Tļ . The +X axis is along a line from the most posterior point of the Tļ spinous process to the origin. The +Y axis is to the left, parallel to a direction from the articulation of T1 with the right first rib to a symmetrical point of the articulation with the left first rib. The +Z axis is defined to complete the right hand triad. The detailed method of recognizing these points by a three dimensional x-ray anthropometry technique, is established within the measurement technique so that the points are operationally defined by the technique (13). The approximate location of the anatomical coordinate system with respect to the Becker linkage is indicated in Figure 1 . 5. Principal Axis Coordinate System - The origin of the principal axis coordinate system is the head center of gravity (CG) • The orientation of this coordinate system is represented by a -34 degree rotation of the head anatomical coordinate system about the +Y axis. The approximate location and orientation of this coordinate system with respect to the Becker linkage is indicated in Figure 1. (For the purposes of this paper the orientation of the principal axes of the inertia tensor is not relevant, since the motion takes place only around the anatomical Y axis, which is also a principal axis. However, the principal axes were defined for subsequent investigations in which the motion will not be restricted to the midsagittal plane.)</page><page sequence="8">CONTROL OF HEAD AND NECK RESPONSE 6.981 TORQUE TORQUE* ON HEAD(N-M) ON HEAD(N-M) , . -, N.M-S N'M łT w M , b=u .

MODEL PARAMETERS AND ASSUMPTIONS FOR THE SIMULATIONS Description of the Linkage - The Becker four-pivot linkage presented in Figure 1 was used in all simulations. The geometric parameters for the linkage were derived by Becker specifically for Subject 93 (8). The components of the link lengths are indicated in Figure 1 , and the locations of the various coordinate systems with respect to the linkage are indicated in Table 2. In addition, for all results presented in this paper the internal pivots (pivots 2 and 3) were locked so that only motion in the midsagittal plane was permitted. Pivot 1 is designated as the neck/torso joint and pivot 4 is designated as the head/neck joint. All of the pivots in the Becker linkage are pin joints. The forcing elements used (spring and dashpot functions) are presented in Figures 13 and 14. Other Model Assumptions - For the runs simulated with the Becker linkage in which the head/neck joint was initially locked, the joint was unlocked at between 75 and 80 msec, and the internal constraint torque about the head/neck joint at that time was linearly reduced to zero at, or prior to, the time of maximum head angular acceleration. In the simulation for run LX3583 in which the head/neck joint was initially locked, the head/neck joint stop was assumed to be reached after the joint unlocked and the head link rotated backward through an angle of 1.6° relative to the neck. For the case in which the head/neck joint was not locked, the joint stop was assumed to be reached after the head link TABLE 2 LOCATIONS OF COORDINATE SYSTEMS RELATIVE TO JOINTS IN BECKER FOUR-PIVOT LINKAGE COORDINATE I COORDINATES OF JOINT JOINT SYSTEM X(cm) Z (cm) NECK/TORSO Tļ ANATOMICAL -6.54 -1.42 (PIVOT 1)* (0RIGIN=Tļ)* HEAD/NECK PRIN.

In all of the simulations the neck/torso joint stop was assumed to be reached after the neck rotated forward through an angle of 24° relative to the torso. All of these values were determined with the intention of fitting the model to the measured response. The mass of the head was assumed to be 4.30 kg and the mass moment of inertia about the principal axis perpendicular to the midsagittal plane was assumed to be 0.02150 N'm's^. These values were obtained from Beier et al. (15). Additionally, sensitivity studies were conducted in which the head mass and moment of inertia were varied by both plus and minus 20%, and the results obtained did not significantly change the findings or the conclusions presented in this report. Massless neck links were used for the purposes of the simulation. This was accomplished in the 3DCVS program by using extremely small values for the mass and mass moments of inertia for the neck links, as discussed in (16). Another assumption of the model was that the effect of gravity was negligible, and it was therefore set to zero. The justification for this was that the head/neck system is initially in equilibrium, and the inclusion of the effect of gravity would have erroneously resulted in the computation of an initial acceleration. Additionally, for the high g runs presented in this paper the effect of gravity was small in comparison to the other forces involved. Computer runs were also made in which the effect of gravity was included, and very little change from the results presented in this paper were observed. DESCRIPTION OF THE DATA BASE USED FOR THE INPUT DRIVING FUNCTION FOR THE HEAD/NECK SYSTEM AND FOR THE VALIDATION OF THE RESULTS - The data used for the input driving function for the head/neck system, as well as for the validation of the simulation results, were derived from the data collected on human volunteers (in this case Subject 93) in impact acceleration experiments at NBDL. In these tests the three-dimensional motion of the head and Tļ were measured by anatomically mounted clusters of accelerometers and photographic targets. The inertial instrumentation and photographic instrumentation, as well as the data handling techniques used at NBDL, have been described previously (17,18). What is designated in this paper as "measured" data for Subject 93 actually represent the values obtained by optimally combining the kinematic variables which are independently derived from accelerometer and photographic measurements (14). This technique produces a consistent set of kinematic variables which is ideally suited to modeling. For the results presented in this paper, the head/neck system was driven by the Tļ acceleration profile in the X direction only. The justification for this was the fact that the principal acceleration at Tļ occurs along the X axis. Also, other investigators (10,19) have suggested that it is appropriate to use the linear components of the Tļ acceleration, either the X component, or the X and Z components, to drive the head/neck system. Sensitivity studies were, however, conducted using the X and Z components of acceleration at Tļ , as well as the angular acceleration about the Tļ anatomical Y axis, and the results did not significantly change the findings or conclusions of this report. Because of space limitations, only the results for run LX3583 are presented in this paper. However, simulations were also made for other -X runs, LX3616 (15 g) and LX3537 (7 g) . The reason for selecting these particular runs is that they are good examples of atypical runs and because the optimum combined variables needed for the simulation were already available on magnetic tape. RESULTS Simulations were made in which the head/neck joint was locked during the initial portion of the run. It was then possible to find values for the spring constants, viscous coefficients, and joint stops for the head/neck and neck/torso joints (Figures 13 and 14), which resulted in simulations that generally exhibited the important characteristics of the measured dynamic response for Subject 93 in run LX3583 (Figures 15A through 151). The following sequence of events in the simulation for this run is generally evident in the plot of head angular acceleration (Figure 15A). The head/neck joint was initially locked, and the entire head/neck system rotated forward in response to the Tļ acceleration profile. At 75 msec the joint unlocked, and the head link then rotated backward relative to the neck until the head/neck joint limiting angle was reached at approximately 89 msec. At this point the head/neck joint stop began loading, causing the head link to accelerate forward relative to the neck, with the peak head angular acceleration achieved at 100 msec. At approximately 108 msec the neci/torso limiting angle was reached, and the necx/torso joint stop began loading. The forward angular acceleration of the neck relative to the torso began to decrease, and by 119 msec the simulation results indicated that the neck was accelerating backward relative to the torso. The large magnitudes of the negative peaks in head angular acceleration in the simulation at 134 msec and at 166 msec were a result of the backward angular acceleration of the neck relative to the torso and the attendant torques produced in the head/neck joint. It may be seen in Figure 15A that the simulated head angular acceleration follows the trend of the measured curve until just before</page><page sequence="11">6.984 M. R. SEEMANN, ET AL.

Measured and Simulated Kinematic Variables for LX3583 - Head/Neck Joint Initially Locked in Simula- tion. the head/neck joint unlocked, and the simulated peak head angular acceleration agrees well with the measured value in both magnitude and time of occurrence. However, the dip in the simulated head angular acceleration beginning at 75 msec does not appear in the plot of the measured variable. This dip in the simulated variable resulted from the unlocking of the joint, as the internal joint constraint torque was linearly decreased to zero. Because it is not understood how this happens physically, it was arbitrarily decided to let the torque decrease linearly. In any event, it was necessary to let the relative head/neck angular velocity build up sufficiently before the joint stop was hit, in order to achieve the desired magnitude of peak head angular acceleration. Although it is not possible at this time to identify the specific anatomical structures involved in the unlocking process, the simulation indicated that the control was effected in the region of the head/neck joint • The first significant negative peak in head angular acceleration in the simulation at 134 msec occurred somewhat later than the corresponding peak in the measured value at 128 msec and did not achieve the magnitude of the measured peak, as may be seen in Figure 15A. However, the simulation agrees well with the measured head angular acceleration for the remainder of the run. Furthermore, the angle of rotation of the head in Figure 15C is in excellent agreement with the measured curve, and the simulated head angular velocity in Figure 15B agrees well with the measured values, although the peak is slightly lower and not as sharp. The simulated linear displacements, velocities, and accelerations for LX3583 (Figures 15D-15I) generally exhibit the peaks and trends found in the measured variables. However, the simulated curves in some cases are not as smooth as the measurements, and in most of the plots, the magnitudes of the peaks differ somewhat from the measured variables. Nevertheless, the overall agreement of the entire set of the nine kinematic variables of interest is quite good, and it is believed that they satisfactorily replicate the measured dynamic response of the Subject 93fs head in run LX3583. A plot of the measured acceleration at Tļ in the X direction, which was used as the input driver for the computer simulation, is presented in Figure 16. This plot includes the measured values for this variable in the NBDL data base, as well as the values actually used in the 3DCVS program. As is evident in the figure, these values are identical. The simulations for LX3616 were also found to satisfactorily replicate the measured dynamic response of Subject 93, and the degree of agreement was generally comparable to that found in the simulation of LX3583. Also, in the simulation of LX3537 there was excellent agreement between most of the simulated and measured kinematic variables. However, it appears that at least one run for Subject 93 in the NBDL data base would not respond well to the method applied to the runs previously discussed, because the head angular LX3583 flNXXOC (MEASURED) .UX^.flNX)íí»l„(.M0Q0t.iBJ.VEB)„ lilii 0.00 O.OS 0.10 0.15 0.20 0.25 TIME (SECONDS) Figure 16.

Hence it is believed that the theory presented in this paper to explain atypical dynamic responses to -X impact acceleration needs to be tested further on other runs for Subject 93 as well as on other subjects exhibiting atypical responses • Nevertheless, the results for the simulations discussed in this paper appear to indicate that parameter fits have been found for the Becker linkage that permit computer simulations to reasonably replicate the magnitudes and trends exhibited by the measured dynamic response for Subject 93, based on the assumption that the volunteer1 s head/neck joint was initially locked. This brings to mind a question with important implications in modeling: Would computer simulations employing the same parameter fits for the forcing elements correctly predict the dynamic response of the volunteer's head, if his head/neck joint were not initially locked, and he therefore exhibited a more typical response? In an attempt to answer this question, a computer simulation was made for run LX3583, again using the forcing elements indicated in Figures 13 and 14. However, a different head/neck joint limiting angle was used, as was previously indicated. It was chosen so that the time of the peak head angular acceleration would agree with the time of the peak in the measured plot. It should be pointed out that the need for using a different joint limiting angle appears to indicate that the joint stop may be affected by the subject's mechanism for locking the joint . The plot of head angular acceleration obtained from the above simulation is presented in Figure 17, together with the plot of measured head angular acceleration for this run. It can be seen from this plot that the simulated head angular acceleration profile obtained when the head/neck joint was not locked looks remarkably like the typical responses of the head to -X acceleration previously pointed out, such as in Figure 4 and Figure 5. Furthermore, the magnitude of the peak head angular acceleration appears to be reasonable for a typical response in a 14 g run, since the value falls well within the range of measured head angular accelerations for typical response profiles at the 14 g level presented in Figure 11, in which this value has been plotted as a circled X symbol. Of course, this simulated value for peak head angular acceleration far exceeds the measured value indicated in Figure 17, but this is to be expected, since previously discussed results indicate that peak head angular acceleration is significantly attenuated in the case of the atypical dynamic response.

Hence, it appears from the above result that for runs exhibiting atypical dynamic responses to acceleration, it is possible to find parameter fits for the forcing elements which permit the reasonable simulation of the atypical response, assuming that the head/neck joint is initially locked, while also permitting the simulation of the volunteer's typical response when his head/neck joint is not locked. It is, however, possible that the requirement for locking the joint to simulate the atypical dynamic response is idiosyncratic to the particular linkage, although this is not believed to be the case. CONCLUSIONS 1 • The group of human volunteers who were exposed to impact acceleration tests in the +Y and/or -X+Y vector directions prior to their -X runs generally exhibited atypical dynamic responses to their -X acceleration exposures. 2. It appears that these experienced subjects somehow learned to control the severity of their exposures by locking their head/neck joints in anticipation of sled firing. The joint apparently remained locked during the initial portion of the sled run, until forces and torques increased sufficiently to cause the joint to unlock. 3. On the assumption that the head/neck joint was initially locked, parameter fits could be found for forcing elements used for the Becker four-pivot linkage that permitted computer simulations of the atypical response</page><page sequence="15">6.988 M. R. SEENANN, ET AL. to reasonably replicate the measured response of the head to an input driving function of the measured Tļ acceleration profile. 4. The parameter fits found for the forcing elements that permitted the simulation of the atypical dynamic response of the head on the assumption of an initially locked head/neck joint also permitted a reasonable simulation of typical head dynamic response when the head/neck joint was not locked. 5. The theory presented in this paper should be applied to other -X acceleration runs for further validation. 6. Although it is not believed to be the case, it is possible that the requirement for a locked joint to simulate the results could be idiosyncratic to the particular linkage. 7. There is a need to classify and group responses prior to modeling efforts. REFERENCES 1 . C . L . Ewing , D . J . Thomas , L • S . Lustick, E. B. Becker, G. C. Willems and W. H.
