<plain_text><page sequence="1">SYMBOL OF ŠIRAŠCAKRA IN ART, RELIGION AND PHILOSOPHY OF INDIA BY PADMA SUDHI Many synonyms have been used for the Sanskrit words širašcakra and prabhã-mandala in the different languages in and outside India. In the Prãkrta-Jainãgama the word lešya, in Tamil, the word Tiruvasï , in Greek the word nimbus , in English the word Halo, and in theosophical philosophy the word aura and another Sanskrit expression prabhãvall , communicate one and the same concept which has been denoted by the Sanskrit words širaš-cakra and Prabhã- Mand ala. Psychological researches have revealed the meaning of ' aura * as an astral-body or shadow-body which is visible to a person who has cryptaesthesia or mystic experience. It is used for convey* Ing the meaning of subtle emanation from flowers also. As far as the word ' halo ' in English is concerned, it gives the meaning of coloured light round luminous body, disc of sun and the moon. The Sanskrit words širaš-cakra, prabhã-mandala and prabhãvall rather give a different sense which is related to religious and metaphysical experiences than the meanings given by the word ' aura ' halo ' and * nimbus ' of the western languages. It is true, if I deal with its meaning as a student of art-history, then these Sanskrit words would express the meaning as conveyed by the words « aura ', ' nimbus ' and ' halo. 9 But beyond its restricted meaning and phenomenal meaning, which is used in the universal arts as a decorative motif, there is something more which India imparts through its religion and philosphy to the concept of éiraš-cakra and Prabhãmandala , and here in this paper all the religious and philosophical concepts about širašcakra are shown besides its significance iti the plastic and pictorial arts of India. About the origin of the symbol širaš-cakra as it is used in the art- forms of India, different opinions have been given by scholars like A. K» Coomaraswami, H. Zimmer, D. R. Sahani, J. Ph. Vogel, A. A. Macdonell, A. Grünwedel and the others. On these concepts, improvements have been made by T. A. G. Rao and J. N. Banerjee. All the scholars are divided, hold- ing two opinions about this symbol. There are scholars who have admitted the motif of Širaš-cakra in the plastic as well as pictorial art of India as belonging to the Indian origin. They are Macdonell1 and Coomaraswami.8 * Macdonell, A. A. Vedic Mythology , p. 155. * History of India and Indonesia art , p. 41. N.

Rao,5 Vogel,6 Sahani7 and Grunwedel, as against its origin in India, have propo- unded their own theory for the halo or širašcakra in Indian iconography as belonging to Greek or Iraninn origin. While discussing the halo round the Buddha's head of Gandhara-art. Grunwedel emphatically expressed in his book titled Buddhist art in India , (p. 86. Eng. Ed. London, 1901 ) that the concept of nimbus has been bor- rowed in Buddhist iconography from the Greek school, which was used for astral divinities of Greek, though it appeared very late in the Greek art during the time of Alexander. When Vogel says this, he is refuting his own theory of the origin of halo belonging to Greek-School, as in Indian art halo was visible long before the reign of Alexander. In Gandhara art of India, the halo was plain, in Šaka-Kusana period, it was scalloped border, while in Gupta period, the golden age for creativity, after retaining the old features, it is endowed with more ornamentaion. Proceeding to the Mediaeval period, Various types of Širaš-cakra were in vogue to decorate the icons of India. Seeing the gradual reformation in each period, and the additions of other art-motifs to the halo, which are relevant with reference to Indian religion and philosophy, it can be convincingly said that the šiřas-cakra belongs to India. Whatever may be the origin of the halo, it is crystal clear that it exists since ancient period in the art-history of India, and its implication was accounted by the religion and philosophy of India. The earliest account of the halo in India was found on the coins of Hermaios and Manes ( B. C. 100 ). Literary evidences have settled its earliest appearance during 2nd Gent. B. C.8 Why Macdonell accepted its antiquity and origin in India ? According to Macdonell, the symbol Širaš-cakra is evolved from the wheel which is employed as the symbol of the sun as representing both its shape and its motion in various rittual performances. It is used in Vajapeya sacrifice in the ceremony of laying the sacrificial fire and at the solstitial festival. In those ceremonies, gold or fire-band was employed as a symbol of Sun when drawing water after sun-set instead of before, and in piling the fire-altar a disc of gold was placed on it to represent the Sun. But clear association is seen with Agni-cayana ceremony. 8 Philosophies- of India , Ed. Campbell, pp. 130, 135. N.

The animal avatäras of Prajãpati later appropriated by Vi snu. There material objects were also used as symbols. The wheel later on became the mark of Cakravartin, the disc of Visnu and the dharma-cakra of, the Buddha. The disc of gold placed behind the fire-altar to represent the sun. may be the origin of Prabhãmandala or Širas-cakra. Radiance is predicated, to all devas mostly connected with the Sun and Fire. As tree behind thex empty altar representing Buddha, later on corresponded to the concept of. throne, similarly, gold-disc behind ritual-altar represented halo or širaí -, cakra. '9 , Macdonell and AKC. have traced the origin of the halo in the fire- ritual ceremony. It might be true that the gold-disc behind the altar-fire' used to enhance the light of the fire-god doubly because of the reflectivity of gold-disc placed behind it as a representative of the Sun-god. Else, it might be shown as a symbol of the union of Earth-fire with the sky-fire which is Sun: itself. It was an unconscious desire of the Vedic people to immortalize; the Earth-fire like the Sun-god which used to give them heat, life and growth in every sphere of world perpetually. If this was the case, then, from the fire- or gold-disc used in the form of halo behind those anthropomorphic gods iť may be concluded that the halo behind the heads of gods and saints, shown in the Indian iconography is the motif to symbolise the eternity like the inces- sant perpetuity of the Sun-god. The word tapas, associated with the Sun with which we have been frequently familiar in the Vedic literature, has sprouted into a fullfledged process of Yoga in the later period. The religious significance of the golden disc of the Vedic-period with the constant growth of the cortex part of the brain of the humans, reached the height - of the metaphysical experience of clairvoyance, where this golden disc had become the object of exhibiting the attainment of highest spirituality after displying it on the back of the head of a person who achieved the state of immortality through the Yógic energy. In this way, religious imporatance of the origin of Širaš-cakra or Prabhã-mandala in its later, stage gave vent to the philosophical theory of Tantra-yoga in the later half of the ancient period of Indian History. The words cakra and mandala in the compound words širaš-cakra and prabhã-mandala are generally treated as the synonyms of each other. In the Višva-koša, the meaning of mandala is given asa particular type of » Ibid,</page><page sequence="4">252 Annals BORI, LXVl ( 1985 ) serpent ( sarpa-višesa ). In SuSruta's Caraka-Samhitã ( V. éaríra-sthãna ), the meaning of the word mandala is given as the aggregate of throat, heart, eyes, lungs and veins ( kanthahrdayartetraklomanad I iu mandala.) The Amarakoša expresses the meaning as upa-süryaka (I. 3. 32). With the help of all these meanings, iirai-cakra or prabhã-mand aia can well be defined by signifying the philosophical speculation of Tantra yoga, which transformed them into a higher religious symbolism. According to it, the highest state of spiritual attainment is reached, when the soul or Jivãtmã ascends the height of Sahasrära-cakra. All the six cakras of the Tantra-yoga are associated with certain Vrttis. The Mulãdhãra-cakra, the very first cakra, consists of dharmörthakämamoksa. The pineal-gland which personifies the Sahasrära- cakra controls all the thousand Vrttis taken internally and externally by the ten indriyas ( five senses of perception and five of volition ). The piercing of the different cakras by the Kundalini means control of the mind over the Vrttis associated with those cakras. The piercing of the Sahsrãra-cakra by the kundalini leads to spiritual illumination after liberating the mind from all the Vrttis or the exhaustion of all the samskãras, good or evil, into the Hiranyamayakoša. It is this Sahasrãra-cakra or the Hiranya- mayakoša that is symbolically shown outside the physical body as a golden circle ( éiraš-cakra ) surrounding the head of the divinities and the seers. The SarpavUesa of the Višva-koša is nothing more than the Kunda- lini of Tantra-yoga. And the Anãhata, Višuddha and ij ña cakras can be Well associated with Suáruta's Caraka-Samhitã where three cakras are corre- lated with the physical organs of lungs, heart, throat and eyes with the central position of Susumnã-nãd ! which are suggested by the word mandala by Suáruta. The golden hue of the soul which is emitted from the Sãdha- ka's body with the attainment of sahasrãra-cakra corresponds to the brahma- jftãna of king Janaka, the prajnã-pãramitã of Lord Buddha and Raja-yoga of other Cakravarti kings who happened to be Räjarsis, having a golden disc over their heads. This penance-theory has brought in the highest state of Vibhüti, which is full of decorative motifs of the Lord of brilliance as is shown by Lord Krsna to Arjuna in the eleventh chapter of the Bhagavadgitã. He is the tejorašim sarvato dip timan tam ( Bg. XI. 17) from where has origi- nated the concept of prabhã-mand ala or prabhãvali or fire-ring with ellipti- cal shape surrounding the whole body of the divinity. In Gopãlottarata- panlya Upanisad (23-24), this brilliance of the Lord is imparted even to the Sun and the Moon. Agni and speech are knowm as the symbol of Kaustubha-Mani in the V aisnava-cult. This mani on the neck of the Lord j&amp;the symbol of brilliance of Jivãtmã. The divine brilliance of the Kaustu* bha also is known as érìvatsa on the chest of Visnu ( Bhag. P., XII. 11. 10: tatprakãíavyã pint sãkfãt šrlvatsam urasã vibhuh ). But one has to trans-</page><page sequence="5">PADMA ŠUDHI : Symbol of Širašcakra Í5Í form oneself into divine to witness the brilliance through the divine eyes. It is accomplished through the practice of Yoga ( Bg. XI. 8 ). Through this process, in the various stages of the mental modification, soul is also variega* ted with different colours according as one progresses towards the ultimate realization. In this practice, forms that appear like snow, smoke, sun, wind, Are, fire-fly, lightning, crystal and moon, precede the manifestaion of Brahman.10 These colours and their brilliance are visible only to yogin ( Bg* XI. 8. ). The doctrine of Karma goes hand in hand with the theory of colours of soul as narrated by Bhlsma in the Mahãbhâtata .ll Later on the same doctrine of colours whcih merged from the physical body, outside its contouť was assigned the name lešya by the Jainãgama .ia The Jain Tirthaňkara by virtue of his boundless intuition based on the crystal purity which radiates from its karmic-matter ( pudgala ) can perceive in each individual the colour* taste, fragrance and quality of the matter as emanating even beyond the strict circumference of the bodily frame ( lešya ) in such a way as to form around it a subtle halo, which is invisible to ordinary individual. The etymology of the word lešya is given like this liêyate ilisyate õtmã karmanã sahãnayeti lešya ( Lešya-koša . Mohan Lai Banthiya, árfcanda Caurariya, Calcutta, 1966). Different meanings of the word lešyá are assigned therein. These are teja, dîpti&gt; mandala , bimba , kirana or deha - saundarya ( SamavByññga , 299 ). It is the auspicious and inauspicious effect of Ätman in contact with the Jain pudgalas of different colours ( Bhagavati - sutta). Tejo-lešya belongs to divine beings which is akin to the concept of halo of iconography. Again and again, it is said in the Jain texts that the relation of lešya with the Yogi is inseparable. It is, therefore, relevant to, say that the halo ( širaš-cakra ) or prabhã-mandala has religio- philosophi- cal foundation rather than the gold-disc which was placed behind the ritual« fire during Vedic times as described by Macdonell and AKC. The second explanation of the word éiraš-cakra or Prabhã-mandala can be traced in the divinities like Visnu, whose Kaustubha-mani , born out of kslra-sagara ,18 imparts its brilliance to other luminaries : and the Vaijayanti - mãlp which is made of pearls, gems, emeralds, sapphires, diamonds and 10 Svet. up .

The three words of Sanskrit, that is, širaš-cakra, prabhã-mandala w. and prabhãvali are used in different senses. Of širaš-cakra, the meaning is given by the English word halo or the Greek word nimbus where a golden cjrcle is shown behind the head of the icon. Prabhã-mandala or prabhãvali are the art-motits of the flames of elliptical shape issuing from the body of the image. But the significance of this motif is same as of širaš-cakra. This prabhã-mandala has been visible in the motif of Natarãja, Buddha, and Visnu sometimes. In Tamil literature, the word tiruvãsl is used in the sense of prabhã-mandala or prabhãvali which enshrouds the whole body of the icons. H. Zimmer has called it a ring of fire which surrounds the figure. According to him, it symbolises the dance of Nature ( Prakrti), which is the life-process of the universe and its creatures, and within which there is taking place eternally the dance of the Prime-mover, the Lord-God.17 The. motif of lotus with six, eight or twelve petals is usually visible in the haloes of Mediaeval period. This gives the concept which is resonant in the Gopãlottaratãpanlya Upanisad, where it is said that the universe is like a lotus shining in the hand of Visnu with six petals of his aišvarya, dharma, yašas, laksml, jfiãna and vairãgya etc. which is known as lllã-kamala of Visçu.18 Besides the form of lllã-kamala which is ascribed to halo, širaš-cakra appears in the Iconography with two concentric layers of gable decorations at its outer end. In the Gupta-period, halo is characterised by its refinement and floral patterns of lotus and lotus-creeper and other art-motifs. Apart from širaš- cakra , prabhãmand ala or prabhãvali is carved emblem, special to God to whose image it is attached. Again prabha-mapdala of Visçu would contain ten avatãras or conch, disc, mace and the lotus, while prabhã-mandala of Šiva consists of the motifs of the objects belonging to Šiva. Also ocean in its anthropomorphic form in the Gupta-plastic-art is shown with the wavy pattern of water over the head in place of halo ( Visnudharmottara Purãna III : 42. 53 sägarä manujottama / samudrãnãm prabhã-sthãne salilam tu pradaršayet ). Not only this, even the hoods of the seven serpents had been decorated over the heads of the icons of Lord Buddha and Visçu. Some- ť. ■ i S3 14 Agni, P. ch. 25. « Bhãg, P. XII. 11. 12. i» Ku .

This halo is attached to the icon with the help of a rod whose thickness should be equal to one-seventh of the diameter of Sirašcakra. Varãhamihira, in his Brhat-Samhitã, has described Sürya with prabhä-mandala made of gems [ratnojjvalaprabhamandalaš ca). In the Sun-image of Mathura, seated, from the sapta-Samudrï well, ( D 46 of Mathura Museum belonging to 100 A. D. ) drawn by four horses, holding some object like lotus or sword, the deity is with two wings and a large semi- circular halo which radiates at the edge by its emerging rays. It is plain. Later on gems and pearls are shown and also twelve zodiac-signs are carved in the halo of the Sun. Sometimes, the prabhä-mandala (elliptical ring) covers the whole body which is carved with decorative motif of lion on the elephant animal having rider as a sword-bearer. Then there is Makara with Gandharva couple playing on lute and Vidyãdharas flying high with garlands in their hands. Sometimes, this ring ( prabha-mandala or prabha - valí ) has Kirttimukha finial, which consists of grinning lion face with his goggle eyes and fangs. And sometimes, chain of jewelled garland issuing out of the corner of his mouth. Sudaršana-cakra has been given the anthropomorphic shape with the flaming-arch surrounding the body ( Prabhàvali ) in the metalic iconography ( Tanjore Art-gallery, bronze Sudaršana) Coins of king Kaniska ( 120-160 A.

This Cakra-Purusa in the Harihara sculpture in Allahabad Museum is shown as a dwarf ( Raghu- vamša, X. 60 ) with a halo of eight-petalled lotus surrounding his head rather than the Solar-disc.

The Cakra-Purusa here may suggest the wheel of sovereignty and imperial power - the prãkrama of Cakravartî king.20 10 Rao : T. A. G. Elements of Hindu iconoêrabhv Vol. Ï. Pt. I DD. 31-1 20 Agrawala.

'</page><page sequence="8">256 Annals BORI, LXVl ( 1985 ) The prabhã-mand ala or prabhavali is known in South India as Tiruvãsi. It is the motif of South Indian copper-images of Éri-Natarãja. In it, there is a lotus pedestal, from which springs as encircling glory ( Tiruvãsi ) fringed with flames and touched within by the two hands of Natarãja holding drum and fire. The text Unmal Vilakham ( Ch. V ) explained the symbol of Tiruvãsi ( fiery arch ) as a motif of Pañcaksara ( five sylables of prayer, that is, shi-vã- ya-na-mah ) and the dance of Šiva therein is symbolised with the mystic syllable • Om ' The arch being the Kombu or hook of the ideogram of the written symbol and the aksara inseparable from Omkãra is the contained splendour. The text Tiru-Arul- Payãn (IX. 3 ) has explained the word tiruvãsi as representing the dance of Nature ( Ibid, Zimmer n. 17 ). AKC, along with Mr. Nallu Swami Pillai ( Dance of Šiva. p. 77 N. Y. 1965 ) commented upon the meaning of the word Tiruvãsi like this ' the first dance is the action of matter and individual energy which is represented by Tiruvãsi , Omkãra, the dance of Kãli. The other is the dance of Šiva. Aksara who is inseparable from Omkãra which is represented as the Ardha-mãtrã or fourth of letter of Pranava, Caturtham or Turiya. Consequently, it is seen that the arch is matter, Nature or Prakrti, the contained splendour. Šiva, dancing within and touching the arch with his head, hands and foot, is the universal soul ( Purusa ). The arch or fiery ring surrounding the dancing Šiva thus concisely denotes Šiva as a Rythmio Play which is represenued by the arch itself. In Hinduism, we find that concept of halo took birth from the fire- ritual where it is represented in the form of golden disc behind fire-altar. In Buddhism, the solar disc is represented with the concept of Cakra- vartin, where king rules the world because of his spiritual virtues or beside the lord of the earth, through his yogic process, he becomes the lord of psychic powers also and through attaining this siddhi, he becomes the Rãjarsi, the King and the seer. In Jainism, the theory of leàyã has invented the halo in the plastic- art of India. The author, after studying and investigating into the concepts of halo, feels that this symbol of arts can be explained elaborately with the application of philosophical and religious beliefs. According to the authort Tantra-yoga has contributed much to the concept of halo which is nothing</page><page sequence="9">PADMA SUDHI : Symbol of ¡Širašcakra 257 more than the sahasrära-cakra which shines outside the body of a Sãdhuka who attained it after dancing through all the rings of other spiritual cakras. Secondly, Vaisnavism played a great role in developing the theory of éiraš- cakra. All the decorative heavenly ornaments together with the diadem of Lord Visnu which send forth their reflected brilliance outside the bodily frame are responsible for the concept of širaš-cakra or prabhã-mandala. Thirdly, this decorative motif must have been adopted in imitation of the peacock 's dance just as the Šikhara of the temples of NSgara- style has been traced in the Mountain-theory of the North. Last but not the least, the prag- matic theory of balance can be worked out where the head of human body is the heaviest in weight so as to hold whole body in balance in its erect position. But the same head, when chiselled by the sculptor, is relatively less weighty than the lower part of the body. Tó maintain the balance of the head in the iconography, a halo is used to support the head's position so that it may not become the victim of destruction due to the natural forces of storm, rain and other agents of erosion. We find that the ancient images without halo have lost either head or their hands and not the lower part of the body. Therefore, in the middle of ancient period it might have become necessary to combine other decorative elements to the head to protect it against natural calamity. Thus the motif of halo or elliptical ring has gained sufficient impetus in the plastic-art of later period. Because of the prevalent common theory of all the fine arts, motif of plastic art got recognition in the pictorial art of India also and painters began to draw a halo over the heads of all the divinities even during mediaeval and modern period. 33 ( Annals BQRf ]</page></plain_text>
