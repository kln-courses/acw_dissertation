<plain_text><page sequence="1">William Dean Howells: Reverie and the Nonsymbolic Aesthetic WILLIAM C. FISCHER, JR. HOWELLS'S RETICENCE in articulating his private feelings is reflected by his general unwillingness to probe too deeply into the minds of his fictional characters. He is adept at faithfully sum- marizing general attitudes and mental states, but he does not often attempt a direct representation of the thoughts and feelings of his characters as they are actually taking place. When he does picture such mental processes the incident is sometimes marked by a revelatory self-conscious misgiving about the inadequacy of lan- guage for performing such a task. An authorial comment taken from A Hazard of New Fortunes sufficiently makes the point: "Beaton did not put it to himself in these words; and in fact his cogitations were not words at all. It was the play of cognitions, of sensations, formlessly tending to the effect which can only be very clumsily interpreted in language." 1 Like most novelists Howells is certainly concerned with conveying a sense of the inner life.2 But he achieves this effect most successfully by a careful depiction of the external and visible aspects of human conduct. The reader infers a good deal about the mental life of Silas Lapham, for instance, by the speech and actions of the man. Seldom does Howells take us directly inside Lapham's mind. When dramatic necessity impells Howells to reveal the immedi- ate workings of the mind, he frequently conceives of the mental William C.

Ferris Cronkhite briefly discusses Howells's increasing interest in the psychology of his fictional characters after 1897, properly pointing out that this new emphasis did not result in more precise representations of mental processes but was only a shift to a different kind of fictional subject matter ("Howells Turns to the Inner Life," NEQ 30 [1957]: 474-85). [1]</page><page sequence="2">2 Nineteenth-Century Fiction situation in the conspicuous form of a reverie, actually describ- ing the episode as such or investing it with unmistakable reverie- like qualities. The vague mental characteristics associated with reverie do not press Howells into an intimate examination of its elusive psychic configurations; yet that mental operation affords him an effective compositional device for giving the impression of turbulent mental processes at the accessible edge of consciousness. A careful look at relevant passages in Howells's writings will re- veal how certain kinds of psychic energy and moral value asso- ciated with the reverie ambiguously converge to produce a particu- lar aesthetic perspective, one that tends to limit both his conception of artistic truth and the literary style by which that truth can be represented. My inquiry is not concerned, except in an unavoidable passing fashion, with the complex aspects of Howells's personal psychology, a topic already treated at length by Edwin Cady. The issues at stake here have to do first with the way certain literary sources seem to impinge on Howells's notions of psychic activity and how his own modifications of these sources appear to affect both his fictional conceptions of mental processes (the kinds of mental processes dramatized) and his style (the way language itself is used to represent these mental processes). The evidence suggests that Howells evolves an identifiable aesthetic doctrine that is basically resistant to symbolic-metaphoric language. His concept of a style appropriate to the tenets of his literary realism is a sur- prisingly limited one that ultimately rejected the potential in fig- urative uses of language for expressing nonliteral or subjective kinds of truth. What figurative language Howells does use is mostly associated with satiric representations of shallow or de- ceptive thinking in his characters, decorative linguistic conceptions that convey a false view of the character's experience rather than reveal new insights into his relationship with the world around him. A brief episode described in the early travel book Venetian Life (1866) perhaps best encapsulates the conflicting emotional and aesthetic responses that Howells embodies in the reverie and provides a suitable point of departure for a more specific examina- tion of the various formulations of this mental operation in his fiction. The episode is undoubtedly the literary reenactment of a private moment that Howells must have experienced during his</page><page sequence="3">William Dean Howells 3 tenure as the American consul in Venice (1861-65). In later auto- biographical writings Howells makes it clear that as a child he was often victimized by fanciful daydreams. One such account from A Boy's Town (New York, 1890) relates (in a paternal third person narrative voice) how his mind was steeped in a kind of continual fantasizing: "the world within claimed him more and more... and he saw much of the outer world through a veil of fancies quiv- ering like an autumn haze between himself and its realities" (240). In Years of My Youth (New York, 1916) he describes similar moods while working in his father's printing shop, allowing his "fancy" to roam the universe only to be rudely awakened: "In these reveries I was a man brilliantly accepted by the great world, but in my waking from them I was a boy, with a boy's fears and anxi- eties in conditions that would have appalled a bolder nature" (80). Howells invests his Venice reverie, which differs from the personal experience of the boyhood daydreams in that it is clearly an act of aesthetic perception, with a sense of self-indulgence and abandon- ment that betrays an unexpected discomfort with the aesthetic point of view. As in the youthful reveries, reality is obscured- veiled with "the lingering mists of a dream"-and the narrator dis- gustedly rejects the experience as having created a distorted per- spective of the outer world: It had snowed overnight, and in the morning when I woke it was still snowing. The flakes fell softly and vertically through the motionless air, and all the senses were full of languor and repose. It was rapture to be still, and after a faint glimpse of the golden-winged angel on the bell tower of St. Mark's, to give indolent eyes solely to the contemplation of the roof opposite, where the snow lay half an inch deep upon the brown tiles. The little scene-a few square yards of roof, a chimney- pot, and a dormer window-was all that the most covetous spirit could demand; and I lazily lorded it over that domain of pleasure, while the lingering mists of a dream of new-world events blent themselves with the luxurious humor of the moment and the calm of the snow-fall, and made my reverie one of the perfectest things in the world. When I was lost the deepest in it, I was inexpressibly touched and gratified by the appearance of a black cat at the dormer-window. In Venice, roofs commanding pleasant exposures seem to be chiefly devoted to the culti- vation of this animal, and there are many cats in Venice. My black cat looked wonderingly upon the snow for a moment, and then ran across the roof. Nothing could have been better. Any creature less silent, or in point of movement less soothing to the eye than a cat, would have been a torture of the spirit. As it was, this little piece of</page><page sequence="4">4 Nineteenth-Century Fiction action contented me so well, that I left everything else out of my reverie, and could only think how deliciously the cat harmonized with the snow-covered tiles, the chimney-pot, and the dormer-window. I began to long for her reappearance, but when she did come forth and repeat her maneuver, I ceased to have the slightest interest in the matter, and experienced only the disgust of satiety. I had felt ennui- nothing remained but to get up and change my relations with the world.3 This reverie is primarily the observation in the present moment of an external scene, and thus its concreteness and immediacy per- haps make it one of the most engaging reveries Howells describes anywhere in his writings. In this aesthetic response the narrator is "touched and gratified" by the appearance of the cat and the way it "deliciously... harmonized" with the other elements of the "little scene." Although like the autobiographical reveries it too is an illusory mental state not to be trusted, the abrupt change of mood and rejection of the aesthetic experience are unlooked for. For Howells to classify this particular moment of vagrant ap- preciation as a repelling ennui-in the very act moreover of put- ting the event to literary use-is somewhat hard to understand. It would seem that Howells, on the threshold of his literary career, conceives of a purely aesthetic view of experience as fostering un- tenable relations with the world. That Howells should feel aesthetic appreciation within the frame of what he calls a reverie and that he should rouse himself from the experience with "the disgust of satiety" and a determination to "change [his] relations with the world" raise some questions worth pursuing further. Why does he associate the reverie with an aesthetic point of view and yet at the same time distrust this particular mental act? And, most significantly, does this relationship between reverie and aesthetics in Howells's mind have any appreciable bearing on his fictional conceptions and literary style? The literary exploitation of the reverie was not Howells's in- novation. It was already a well-entrenched minor convention among nineteenth-century American romantics. Such writers as 3. Venetian Life, rev. and enl. ed. (Boston, 1884 [1872]), pp. 50-51; further references in my text are to this edition. The phrase, "the lingering mists of a dream of new- world events," is a reference to one of Howells's many dreams of home while living in Venice. In a letter dated 26 April 1862 he writes to his sister Victoria about a dream "of being in America last night, as I have done so many, many times since I have been here" (Life in Letters of William Dean Howells, ed. Mildred Howells, 2 vols. [Garden City, N.Y., 1928], 1:57).</page><page sequence="5">William Dean Howells 5 Hawthorne and Melville variously use the reverie as a frame for describing emotional turmoil and as a device for creating a credi- ble literary perspective for the symbolic representation of sub- jective truths. Howells, in his juvenile fiction, seems initially to base his representations of reverie on these established models. His natural tendency to view the reverie as invested with potential moral instability and self-deception, however, causes him increas- ingly to suspect the legitimacy of the aesthetic perspective usually associated with this mental act. The conflicting moral and aesthetic motifs latent in the reveries of his juvenilia emerge in the more visible form of the Venice reverie. At the same time Howells begins in Venetian Life as well as in the companion volume Italian Jour- neys to formulate these mutually exclusive elements into a con- spicuous if not official aesthetic doctrine. It is at this early stage of his development that his growing distrust of the psychic energies traditionally associated with reverie and aesthetic perception begin to have a constraining effect on his style. He deliberately seeks (as I show) to abandon what he regards as deceptive artistic embellish- ments in the use of language. Instead he begins to cultivate a non- metaphoric style that has relatively little capacity for symbolizing the subjective modes of experience that his romantic predecessors commonly equate with truth. The reveries of the profligate Bartley Hubbard in A Modern Instance demonstrate the extent to which Howells comes to suspect and fear this mental state and help to explain the uncertain aesthetics of the reverie-prone editor Basil March in A Hazard of New Fortunes. The characterizations of March and Angus Beaton in that novel would seem most nearly to represent Howells's ultimately confused feelings about the limited capacity of literary art for rendering truth. As early as age sixteen Howells published some tentative fictional offerings in the Ashtabula Sentinel, the Ohio newspaper run by his father, William Cooper Howells. Among the first sketches was a short piece entitled "An Old Time Love Affair" (1 Sept. 1854).4 In what purports to be an abbreviated historical romance, young Howells uses the dream in a curious way that 4. 22:1 (all the quotations below are from p. 1). Volumes 22 and 23 of the Sentinel are located at the Ohio State Archeological and Historical Society, Columbus, Ohio; I used a microfilm copy deposited at the Doe Library, University of California, Berkeley.</page><page sequence="6">6 Nineteenth-Century Fiction looks forward to his later association of the reverie with an un- reliable aesthetic point of view. The story is an account in semi- epistolary form of the troubled courtship between Margery Brews and John Paston in "merry England" during the reign of Henry VI. When Margery writes her final letter to John bravely request- ing him to stop courting her (because her father will not provide an adequate dowry), the narrator offers to fill in the ensuing events for the reader. "Let me dream for you," he rhetorically asks, and goes on to describe a happy denouement in which the father relents. At the very end we are left to assume that a marriage will take place as the narrator concludes: "But the dream ends, and I return to [godespel]." Howells tries to suggest an historical authenticity by scattering archaic diction throughout the text, and I can only guess that in using the word "godespel" he means "gospel truth," or, in a broader sense, "waking reality." 6 In this instance the dream is not used as a device for dramatizing the psychic activity of a particular fictional character. It is instead the slight framework within which the narrator himself must work when supposedly there is no further reliable epistolary documenta- tion upon which the story can be based. In performing this literaryJ dream act the writer almost apologetically sees himself functioning as a proxy for the reader's imagination. In so doing Howells seems concerned with distinguishing the quality of the literary ex- perience from the gospel truth. Only a faint uneasiness with the aesthetic dream stance is suggested here, but this germinal suspicion would soon grow into a more disturbing consideration of the aesthetic point of view. Another aspect of Howells's early treatment of the reverie occurs in The Independent Candidate: A Story for Today (1854-55), his unhappy first attempt at a short serialized novel. Near the begin- ning of the story young Howells associates the reverie with a con- ventional literary notion of "fancy." Cuffins, an unscrupulous small-town politician, lapses into a brief reverie concerning his bleak chances of winning the coming election. He has just heard that the bright young man of the town is helping his opponent: " 'Indeedl it's a pity he begins wrong,' and MR. CUFFINS falls into a reverie about the future. Of a truth, however, there is nothing 5. The Sentinel page from which the microfilm was made is marred or worn at the place where the word godespel occurs.

In order to depict the operation of "fancy" Howells capitalizes on the ready-made personification embodied in a decorative poetic allusion. This conventional treatment gives the reader no clear view into Cuffins's mind beyond a "blurred and blotted picture." Further on in the story Howells more blatantly exploits the convention. He describes the mental terrors of the night experienced by Annie during a sickbed vigil over the indeP pendent candidate's feverish daughter. In delivering himself of the following passage Howells does not name the episode a reverie. But since it approximates a waking-dream state in which the fancy is vigorously exercised we are justified in identifying it as a similar situation: 0! the long, lonesome night! To lie sleeplessly, and count the life- throbs of the clock; to cheat oneself into a half slumber; to have the golden charm broken by visions of wild, haggard forms and faces, that change and shift like the glories of a kaleidoscope; to drug Reason, and leave Fantasy and her train of grisly whims in full possession of the brain; to listen to the noises, that rise through all the house, and echo in the silent room; to weave horrible pictures that fade and brighten by turns; to be haunted by memories of dreadful scenes that will not be laid; to rehearse the business of the day, with a fantastical garnish- ment from Phantom-land; to sink at last in a whirl of contending fancies into an unquiet dream, only to frighten oneself with new terrors. 0! This is most fearful.7 The fantastically choreographed figures that invade Annie's half- slumbering mind constitute a sustained and more intense version of the necromantic operation of fancy in Cuffins's reverie. Howells's notion of psychic organization and activity is strictly a traditional literary one, here represented by a rush of stylized allegorical verbiage that does not depict mental activity with any more specificity than "the blurred and blotted picture" of Cuffins's mind. The gothic figures and "grisly whims" associated with the domi- nation of Fantasy over Reason suggest at first glance that the scene 6. Ashtabula Sentinel, vol. 23, 30 Nov. 1854, p. 1. 7. Ibid., vol. 24, 11 Jan. 1855, p. 1.</page><page sequence="8">8 Nineteenth-Century Fiction was energized by the graveyard poetry of Young or Freneau. If any nearer influence can be identified, however, it might well be that of Hawthorne, a writer who compelled young Howells's deepest respect and whose works he knew well. In a brief Haw- thorne sketch called "The Haunted Mind" there is an exemplary passage that dramatizes a similar waking-dream episode. The un- inhibited nocturnal workings of fancy and imagination in the mind of the fitful sleeper impart "vividness to all ideas, without the power of selecting them or controlling them." In what Hawthorne refers to as this mental "intermediate space," representative of the fictive territory somewhere between the Actual and Imaginary that char- acterizes most of his writings, a "funeral train" of personified figures issues forth from the "dungeon" of the heart, parading the "bodily shapes" of Passion and Feeling before the hapless sleeper.8 This fictional point of view is not uniquely Hawthorne's. Washington Irving, whose works young Howells also knew, often associates the dream and reverie with literary point of view. Geoffrey Crayon describes himself at the beginning of The Sketch Book (in the short prefatory sketch entitled "The Voyage") as "one given to day- dreaming, and fond of losing himself in reverie." He then elabor- ates on how his "imagination" would conjure up "shapeless mon- sters" and "wild phantasms," as indeed do spring up in the mind's eye of his two most notable heroes, Rip Van Winkle and Ichabod Crane.9 That the reverie is also a commonly used device in the works of authors outside of Howells's wide range of literary acquaintance strongly justifies treating it as a convention. Melville is a case in point.'0 His manipulation of the reverie in Moby-Dick is a signifi- cant artistic strategy for engaging the reader in the metaphysical dimensions of the novel. In the opening chapter Ishmael (like 8. Hawthorne: Selected Tales and Sketches, ed. Hyatt H. Waggoner (New York, 1962), p. 323. See also Joseph C. Pattison, "Point of View in Hawthorne," PMLA 82 (1967): 363-69; Pattison argues, in fact, that the dream stance is the point of view from which most of Hawthorne's fiction should be interpreted. It should be noted as well that for Hawthorne such a dream posture, with its identifiable mental locus some- where in the realm between the Actual and the Imaginary, is precisely the per- spective that he ascribes to the generic definition of romance in "The Custom- House." 9.

Only two references by Howells to Melville are recorded: a somewhat deprecating review of Melville's Battle-Pieces and Aspects of the War in Atlantic Monthly 19 (Feb. 1867): 252-54, and a brief mention of him in a review of Stedman's biography in "Editor's Easy Chair," Harper's Monthly 122 (1911): 471-74.</page><page sequence="9">William Dean Howells 9 Geoffrey Crayon) sets the prevailing introspective mood of the novel by referring to "ocean reveries" and man's "deepest rev- eries," 11 associating the ocean later on with a "most mystic mood" that creates a milieu almost identical to the one Hawthorne pre- scribes for romance fiction: "so that fact and fancy, half-way meet- ing, interpenetrate, and form one seamless whole" (486). The reverie is used as a perspective for just such a transcendent mood in the chapter entitled "The Mat-Maker," achieving a skillful inter- penetration of literal action and symbolic meaning that antici- pates the first encounter with the White Whale: "So still and subdued and yet somehow preluding was all the scene, and such an incantation of revery [sic] lurked in the air, that each sailor seemed somehow resolved into his own invisible self." Thus introspectively transformed, Ishmael works out the allegory of his will and destiny with Queequeg at the Loom of Time. At this very moment Moby- Dick is first sighted and Ahab's demonic boat crew materializes in the shape of "five dusky phantoms," overpowering Ishmael's will (the "ball of free will" drops from his hand) and propelling him and the Pequod on the destined hunt (212-14). The reader, via the symbolic medium created by the reverie, has himself been launched into the thick of the chase. Melville also uses the reverie to characterize much of the spectral inner life of Pierre. The "phantoms" that inhabit the depths of Pierre's soul emerge, like Ahab's demonic boat crew, during intense moments of intro- spection that Melville refers to as "wild reveries." 12 Howells's most memorable exposure to literary uses of the dream and reverie was undoubtedly in the works of the popular senti- mentalist, Donald Grant Mitchell, better known by the pseudonym Ik Marvel. In My Literary Passions (New York, 1895) Howells de- scribes how at the age of sixteen he was much affected by two of Mitchell's books, The Reveries of a Bachelor (1850) and Dream Life (1851) (64-66), both composed of a series of tenuously con- nected reveries and dreams in which fancy and imagination loft the narrator away from "the dull standard of the actual." 13 Mitch- ell's purpose in using the reverie is not to transport the credulous reader into a romance world filled with symbolic meaning but rather to exploit it as a frame for self-indulgent sentimental 11.

It is from Mitchell that Howells probably borrowed what came to be the most noticeable characteristic of his own fictional reveries, one that is in sharp contrast with the earlier versions of the romantics. While Hawthorne's reveries are primarily retro- spective (the emergence of feeling associated with past experiences) and Melville's are deeply introspective, the reveries devised by Howells ordinarily look forward to some imagined event in the future. This is a quality similar to the one found in the reveries of Mitchell's kindly old bachelor; he imagines for himself, by the loneliness of his fireside, such future domestic blessings as marriage, or the bittersweet grief to be experienced in the death of a beloved wife or child, and so on, in a kind of extended but watered-down imitation of Lamb's beautiful reverie "Dream-Children." Howells, ever the antisentimentalist in his own thinking, moves deter- minedly away from such saccharine treatment by dramatizing the reverie as a harmfully self-deceptive mental situation. It would seem fair to conclude that he was initially influenced by the con- vention of the reverie as it existed in the fiction of his predecessors, especially in its repeated association with fancy and imagination. But in his own gradual formulation of a less symbolic mode of literary realism he was inadvertently forced to reinterpret this romantic perspective as a distorted aesthetic point of view. To a large extent then the reverie survives in Howells's writings as the stepchild of a minor literary convention, a device useful for de- picting illusions but not for expresssing deep subjective truths. For Howells it was a short step from utilizing the melodramatic effects of the reverie to characterizing it as having morally objec- tionable implications. Five years after The Independent Candidate he wrote a sketch published in the New York magazine The Knick- erbocker entitled "A Dream" (58 [Aug. 1861]) in which the first mature use of the reverie appears as a compositional device for representing self-deceptive mental experience. All that remains of the reified emotional abstractions of Annie's night thoughts is a suggestion of impulsive mental activity. Regarded stylistically, the actual thought content of the reverie is in the more realistic form of a discursive description of the ideas present in the hero's mind. Geoffrey imagines to himself the grand impression he will con- descendingly make on Clara, a cousin who had jilted him several years earlier but for whom he still secretly harbors considerable feeling. The prominent conceptual feature of Geoffrey's reverie</page><page sequence="11">William Dean Howells 11 is that it will prove to be an egotistical and false prophecy of Clara's response to him when the reunion actually takes place. This sort of anticipatory self-deception is the pattern for almost all of the en- suing reveries in Howells's fiction, especially the self-aggrandizing and debilitating thoughts characteristic of Bartley Hubbard's mental life in A Modern Instance. Although Geoffrey's situation is not labelled as such, it is clearly an incipient reverie, a sequence of "foolish thoughts." In addition it is associated with the inventive faculty and significantly suggests to Howells a latent immorality: In certain foolish moments, Geoffrey had thought to surprise and con- found his cousin, when he should meet her, by his superior manner and courtly reticence. He revelled in the anticipated enjoyment of her abasement and regret, when she should come to see what sort of a man she had trifled with-a man not only of excellent mind and conversa- tion, but of elegant presence. He invented scenes and dialogues in which he played the forgiving but dignified and inaccessible patron, and she the frightened, fluttering, embarrassed recipient of his polite attentions. AhI well, are we to be judged by our foolish thoughts? Thank heaven, no! but by how much or how little restraint we put upon them. (148) The forthright yet faintly uneasy judgment which concludes the passage suggests the discomfort young Howells begins to feel re- garding certain uncontrollable impulses of the mind in reverie. Along with this increased moral concern is a noticeable shift in style toward a plainer and more factual descriptive technique. The weird shapes of fancy that Howells formerly associates with gothic stereotypes are now transformed into mundane foolish thoughts, psychic deceptions more suitably rendered by uses of language that are increasingly nonsymbolic. The discursive representation of Geoffrey's mental processes anticipates in practice the tentative theoretical pronouncements in the travel literature regarding the limitations of both the literal and symbolic -capacity of language for depicting truth. This shift in stylistic attitude signals the begin- ning of Howells's doctrinaire notions of realism. The 1860s represent a significant turning point in Howells's career. During this period he gradually abandons the fiction of romantic emotion represented by "A Dream" and the earlier pieces in the Sentinel and turns his creative energies to enlightened</page><page sequence="12">12 Nineteenth-Century Fiction travel descriptions in Venetian Life (1866) and Italian Journeys (1867). The travel sketches provide no occasion for the dramatic representation of emotions through fictional characters. Instead they pose the new problem for Howells of recording his own emotional experiences, mainly in the form of aesthetic apprecia- tions of Old World scenes such as we have seen already in the Venice reverie. Howells works consciously in Venetian Life to eschew all expressions of what he considers to be false sentiment, assiduously avoiding the gauzy romantic illusions that previous literature had spun around the city. He is highly suspicious of the distorted truth that the literary point of view traditionally presents: "I could not, indeed, dwell three years in the place without learning to know it differently from those writers who have described it in romances, poems, and hurried books of travel, nor help seeing from my point of observation the sham and cheapness with which Venice is usually brought out, if I may so speak, in literature" (10). In a relevant passage in Italian Journeys that iterates his impa- tience with conventional literary perspectives, Howells distin- guishes between the ignorant and the informed traveller, one susceptible to "poetic fiction" as opposed to one in possession of the facts. Describing his visit to Mantua, he is deceived by the poetic seductiveness of the place because he is not in command of the factual truth regarding the city's ancient past. Before "Fact," operating as an allegorical component in the literary representation of his mental state, can activate itself to supply the proper cor- rective, the uncertain shapes and outlines provided by the ignorant mind have come and gone: For myself, when in Mantua, I tried to make a virtue of my want of information, and fancied that a sort of general ignorance was more favorable to my enjoyment of what I saw there than thorough ac- quaintance with the city's history would have been. It certainly en- abled me to accept all the poetic fiction of the custodians, and to embroider with their pleasing improbabilities the business-like suc- cinctness of guide-books; to make out of the twilight which involved all impressions a misty and heroic picture of the Mantuan past, wherein her great men appeared with a stately and gigantic uncertainty of outline, and mixed with dim scenes of battle, intrigue and riot, and were gone before Fact could lay her finger on any shape, and swear that it was called so, and did so and so.14 14. 7th ed., rev. and enL. (Boston, 1882 [1872]), p. 326; further references in my text are to this edition.</page><page sequence="13">William Dean Howells 13 The "misty pictures" and "dim scenes" of "poetic fiction" are, at a less intense pitch, similar to the "blurred and blotted" pictures of Howells's earliest fictional reveries. Howells regresses somewhat from the charming concrete specificity of the Venice reverie and resorts again to formulaic abstract conceptions of fanciful proc- esses. The cat in the Venice reverie, whose capricious comings and goings regulate the narrator's response to the aesthetic harmony of the roof-top snowscape, is a welcome innovation that more subtly achieves the same sense of transient unreliability conveyed so conventionally in the Mantua passage. Howells wants to write descriptions that will preclude vague and fanciful mental re- sponses and correspond more closely to factual truth. He does not yet sufficiently free his style (and thereby his conceptions), however, from the inherited literary terminology he first employs for representing mental processes. At this point Howells's style and conception clash with his ethical intention of conveying pure un- varnished truth. Toward the end of Venetian Life Howells makes some comments about excessive demonstrations of temperament that would seem to summarize his own attitudes toward the implied immorality of the uncontrolled and unreliable postures of reverie and fancy. In a pointed comparison between the unreined passions of the Italian and the disciplined emotions of the American, Howells emphat- ically prescribes a "self-command" over the natural mental im- pulses that would otherwise deflect one's moral development: The Italian's education, however profound, has left his passions un- disciplined, while it has carefully polished his manner; he yields lightly to temptation, he loses his self-control, he blasphemes habitually; his gentleness is conventional, his civilization not individual. With us the education of a gentleman (I do not mean a person born to wealth or station, but any man who has trained himself in morals or religion, in letters, and in the world) disciplines the impulses, and leaves the good maner to grow naturally out of habits of self-command and conse- quential habitual self-respect. (383; italics mine) This is simply a more didactic call for the same restraint preached briefly at the conclusion of Geoffrey's reverie in "A Dream." Man is not naturally good or moral but must be educated to acquire the "habits of self-command" that will make him a gentleman. The succeeding generation of young writers fostered the cliche still very</page><page sequence="14">14 Nineteenth-Century Fiction much abroad today that Howells creates a sunny fictive world that almost seems to deny the existence of any dark immorality. We can see in Howells's continual use of the reverie, however, that many of his commonplace-even "good"-people stand precariously close to the temptations of mental lawlessness and its potential immorality. If Howells cannot bring himself to dramatize the un- pleasant side of man's nature, the unseen presence of a threatening evil is at least implied by the play of uncontrolled impulses in the minds of the most gentlemanly characters in his novels. The nu- merous reveries of Basil March throughout the several novels in which he appears are prima facie evidence. In spite of the announced antisentimental intentions expressed in the travel writings, Howells is still mindful that removing illu- sions might impair the aesthetic point of view that the genre of descriptive travel literature then implied. Basil March faces a similar quandary in A Hazard of New Fortunes, as we will see further on, regarding his own picturesque literary sketches of poverty-stricken scenes in New York City. One's ethical intentions of telling the truth often interfere with one's aesthetic conceptions. Howells dexterously confronts the reader with this dilemma at the beginning of Venetian Life, likening his book to an entertaining theatrical performance, yet hoping at the same time that the omis- sion of "dreams" and "prejudices" will not prove disappointing: So if the reader care to follow me to my stage-box, I imagine he will hardly see the curtain rise upon just the Venice of his dreams-the Venice of Byron, of Rogers, and Cooper; or upon the Venice of his prejudices-the merciless Venice of Darii, and of the historians who follow him. But I still hope that he will be pleased with the Venice he sees; and will think with me that the place loses little in the illusion removed; and-to take leave of our theatrical metaphor-I promise to fatigue him with no affairs of my own, except as allusion to them may go to illustrate life in Venice. (11) Another important aspect of this statement, finally, is the inference we can draw from it regarding Howells's attitude toward language. Coupled with his self-conscious feeling of the contradiction between conventional literary posture and the presentation of truth, we find him in this instance paying particular attention to his use of metaphor, the rhetorical element so crucial, as I will shortly emphasize, to the richly symbolic prose styles of Hawthorne, Mel-</page><page sequence="15">William Dean Howells 15 ville, and James. Howells feels obliged to tell the reader at pre- cisely what point he is abandoning the metaphor, as if to signal the end of an aesthetic embellishment and the beginning of a more reliable mode of literary representation. One important result of Howells's treatment of the reverie, as we have reviewed it so far and as substantiated by the preceding passage, is that it soon led to a skeptical attitude toward written language. Because he looks suspiciously upon the operation of fancy and the aesthetic point of view associated with it, it follows that he in some way suspects the literary product of any such dubious creative process. This view seems in turn to have at least some limit- ing effect on his notion of style. In Venetian Life he talks pointedly about the weaknesses inherent in language for conveying accurate pictures to the reader. Describing the art and architecture of Venice, he not only deprecates his own ability to use language persuasively, but betrays a distrust in the written word itself: I am sure that no one strange to the profession of artist ever re- ceived a just notion of any picture by reading the most accurate and faithful description of it: stated dimensions fail to convey ideas of size; adjectives are not adequate to the ideas of movement; and the names of the colors, however artfully and vividly introduced and repeated, cannot tell the reader of a painter's coloring. (156) Going on to describe one of the famous buildings in Venice, he alludes to his own literary impotency in saying that he is "shy of endeavoring ... to transmute the substance of the Ducal Palace into some substance that shall be sensible to the eyes that look on this print" (157). Howells's reluctant faith in the medium of his own chosen art to render visible phenomena by means of plain nonsymbolic word images, the "substance" just referred to, par- tially explains his reluctance to move beyond this to figurative images for representing the invisible noumena of subjective truths in his fiction. As he says of his Venetian "reminiscences," as he calls them: "I feel that the words fail to give all the truth that is in them" (431; italics mine). In Italian Journeys he laments that even exact pictorial reproductions of an object cannot fully convey its sub- stance or its underlying truth. Both his "most gorgeous adjectives" and the process of photography (at a time when photography could produce only black and white images) are equally powerless to give the "glowing sense of those hues" in the frescoes of the houses at</page><page sequence="16">16 Nineteenth-Century Fiction Pompeii. He does, however, credit one significant advantage to photography: "it can do the drawing better, and, I suspect, the spirit also" (100; italics mine). Howells implies that art comes closest to the truth when it renders the most exact impression of the visual dimensions of life; that the most faithful nonsymbolic word images will also be most likely to capture the "spirit" or "truth" that lies behind such surface appearances. It is not surpris- ing therefore to find that artificial literary analogies that can be made to suggest truth to the reader, stylistic devices such as symbol and metaphor, do not seem to accord with Howells's notions of the imitation of reality. Such embellishments only further distort truths whose purest forms are basically visual-not linguistic. In thus assembling the evidence to demonstrate Howells's antip- athy toward symbol and metaphor, I do not mean to imply that his works are totally devoid of symbolism. Howellsian symbolism, to the extent that it does exist, however, is thematically suggestive rather than a function of any figurative use of language. The term suggestive is perhaps most germane to the distinction I would like to develop at this point between two kinds of symbolism. In talking of Howells as a symbolic realist, Everett Carter and Edwin Cady define the difference between the thematic or conceptual symbols of the romanticist and realist.'5 In their fundamentally similar 15. Carter (Howells and the age of Realism [Philadelphia, 1954]) defines romantic symbolism as follows: "Convinced of the existence of either a supersensory world, or of the need for exploring the realm of the subconscious, the romantic symbolists tried to express these otherwise incommunicable truths through the use of concrete objects which represent the outcroppings into the physical world of the metaphysi- cal or the subconscious" (133), and then cites the White Whale as such a symbol. Of realist symbolism he says, "limiting himself to the physical world of things and our rational perceptions of them, the realist used his symbols to reinforce or to give emotional dimension to some meaning already within the frame of his narrative" (134). As an example of "this more limited use of symbol" he refers to the wreck of the Walter Scott in Huckleberry Finn. Carter concludes with a less-than-satisfactory terminological distinction: "For the other, more limited way of using symbols [the realist's use] to reflect not outside the story to a metaphysical or psychological truth, but inside the story, to reinforce some meaning already in the frame of the narrative, we have no term. Perhaps we can employ the awkward phrase 'use of symbol' to distinguish this method from 'symbolism.' The romantics were 'symbolists'; the realists 'used symbols'" (133-34). We can infer from the language used by Cady (The Road to Realism [Syracuse, 1956]) that he accepts Carter's definitions and distinctions. Speaking of Howells's "use of symbols" in A Modern Instance, he says: "Only the reader who takes care to miss nothing is likely to notice that they are symbols. One reason for this is that, unlike the symbols of a Hawthorne or Melville, these have no referents outside the immediate field of the novel. They do not point to abstractions of general validity or significance. They function only to give heightened imaginative power to the particular work. They are covert and serviceable, the symbols of a realist" (214).</page><page sequence="17">William Dean Howells 17 definitions these scholars deal with the symbol not as a stylistic mode but as a method or device for conceptualizing experience in the fictive world, as a way of defining the thematic function of objects in the fictive world in relation to the general meaning of the story, as a way of suggesting various subjective dimensions of experience that accrue to such objects which the reader identifies as "symbolic" by virtue of their prominence in any given episode. In this broad conceptual sense all symbols are thematic, regard- less of the way language itself is used to feature the images or com- binations of suggestive detail that constitute the symbol. In several early works such as "Private Theatricals" (1875-76) and A Fore- gone Conclusion (1875) Howells attempts a series of experiments in extensively described landscape and interior settings that can be properly termed symbolically suggestive. But even this sort of con- centrated suggestive symbolism does not remain a regular part of his technique, save for an occasional reversion to it in the rendering of certain landscape details in The Undiscovered Country (1880) and of Faulkner's ocean-front garden in The Shadow of a Dream (1890). In most of his fiction after 1880 Howells restricts symbolic suggestiveness to one or two images or objects, when he feels such a touch is needed, rather than attempting to create a pervasive sym- bolic atmosphere. I would like for the moment to shift away from the notion of suggestive symbolism and consider an ancillary definition of sym- bolism as it relates strictly to style, that is, to the way a writer uses language. When I have spoken of Howells's nonsymbolic style, I have been referring solely to his uses of language. Both roman- ticists and realists use symbols that are thematically suggestive, images that pictorialize certain dimensions of subjective experi- ence, either emotional or metaphysical or both. Only certain romanticists and realists, however, consistently cultivate the sym- bol as a rhetorical figure in their style. Howells is not one of these. The symbolic suggestiveness he inculcates into some of his fictional scenes is achieved by a basically nonmetaphoric prose style akin to that of earlier American romanticists like Charles Brockden Brown, Irving, Poe, and even one of Howells's mentors on the Atlantic Monthly, Oliver Wendell Holmes. In fact it is from Poe that I bor- row the word suggestiveness to make the distinction between what I have called the thematic and figurative symbol. In his aversion to symbolism and allegory Poe uses the term suggestiveness at the</page><page sequence="18">18 Nineteenth-Century Fiction conclusion of "The Philosophy of Composition" in referring to the "under-current, however indefinite, of meaning" evoked by the raven. He is clearly talking about the repeated references to the raven in the poem that transform it into an object of intense and mysterious subjective interest for the reader, and not to any figurative stylistic device used in representing the bird itself. To complete the distinction, a brief allusion to the styles of Hawthorne and James will illustrate the figurative symbol as op- posed to such thematic symbols as the raven or, to give an example from Howells's fiction, the house in The Rise of Silas Lapham (I885). And here metaphor as a rhetorical device is most crucial. In their conceptions of the fictive world, as with those of Howells and the romanticists just mentioned, Hawthorne and James also use images that function as symbols at the conceptual or thematic level -as, say, in the conspicuous descriptions of the house and garden in The House of the Seven Gables or in the repeated renderings of the architectural details of the various Bellegarde houses that play so pervasive a role in The American. In addition to their thematic significance of suggesting certain subjective qualities of experience manifest in the setting, however, these same images and the objects they describe serve a stricter stylistic function as well. They are transmuted into potent metaphors in passages of action, dialogue, or meditation elsewhere in the novel, organically infusing into other dramatic episodes the subjective qualities associated with the original appearance of the image. Howells does not exercise such metaphoric symbolism in his style, even when his writing is most symbolically suggestive in the thematic sense. To put it another way, Howells "uses symbols," as both Carter and Cady show, but his symbolizing is restricted to the conceptual or thematic level- the creative act of selecting an image or object for dramatic prominence to the exclusion of other possibilities. Never to my knowledge do his symbolic images or conceptions crop up else- where in the course of a story as metaphoric turns of speech for enriching the original symbolic conception. Hawthorne and James on the other hand, and certainly Melville too, are symbolic stylists as defined by the way they use language metaphorically. Howells uses thematic symbols, but he does not develop a symbolic style that exploits the metaphoric possibilities of those symbols. Not once in Silas Lapham, for instance, does Howells convert into metaphor any images used in the numerous descriptions of or</page><page sequence="19">William Dean Howells 19 references to the new house, the central thematic symbol in the work. This is not to say that he abandons metaphor altogether. What then, we might reasonably ask, can we infer about Howells's stylistic aesthetic from the kinds of metaphor (and of simile, its figurative adjunct) that he does in fact employ? A close look at Silas Lapham suggests that Howells's metaphors and similes can be divided roughly into two groups: those that appear in authorial description and commentary and might be called "decorative," a flourish provided by the author himself, and those that appear in the dialogue of the fictional characters, metaphors perhaps best termed "colloquial" and intended to give the impression of being appropriate to the mentality of the character who utters them. The unobtrusive and somewhat commonplace nature of the metaphors in the first category, along with Howells's obvious condescension toward the colloquial figures in the second category, strongly sup- ports the argument that Howells feels uneasy about any startling or assertive uses of metaphor for conveying significant messages about the nature of his fictive world. Howells's "decorative" metaphors, rather than being drawn from the images or actions that constitute the setting or experience of the fictive world, are instead separate and unrelated artistic decora- tions, appropriate only to the literary moment at which they occur and with no particularly important thematic significance. A good portion of them are predicative, verb constructs of action and movement rather than more emphatic visual images, and might be regarded in many cases as closely approaching colloquial usage. At the construction site of the new house Silas Lapham enjoys hearing "the portable engine chuckle ... and cough." "6 He terminates a discomfiting conversation about reading books with an abrupt ex- halation that is characterized as "blowing away the whole unprofit- able subject" (123). Other metaphors are more formal and seem to take on a kind of wooden oratorical cast, as when Howells de- scribes Persis discovering "that a barb had been left to rankle in her mind" (38) or Lapham looking at Persis's face "and watching the effect of the poison of ambition" (45). A lengthy rehearsal of the Laphams' domestic history is introduced by a decorative allusion to "the silken texture of the marriage tie" (66), a figure so belletristic as to seem almost tongue-in-cheek. Near the end of the novel the 16.

But here the figurative images are used not to garnish another episode with the symbolic suggestiveness of the house (suggestive among other things of Lapham's social ambitions) but simply, in what amounts to an architectural version of the pathetic fallacy, to add for a brief moment symbolic emotional dimension to the metonymic images used in describing the burnt-out structure. Some blatant metaphors, as, with the phrases "house of mourning" and "house of laughing" (432), are self-consciously acknowledged in an allusion to Lapham's accumulating troubles as being "not always like the adversity we figure in allegory" (433). One special aspect of what I have called "decorative" metaphor anticipates Howells's patronizing attitude toward the colloquial metaphor shortly to be taken up. The florid metaphors of Bartley Hubbard's over-wrought journalistic style constitute Howells's parody of bad writing. Certain passages from Bartley's portrait of Lapham for the "Solid Men of Boston" series represent a tacit criticism of the use of figurative language. Bartley, says Howells, "made a very picturesque thing of the discovery of the paint mine," and then goes on to give us Bartley's grandiloquent opening sen- tence for the sketch: "Deep in the heart of the virgin forests of Vermont, far up toward the line of the Canadian snows, on a desolate mountain-side, where the autumnal storm had done its wild work, and the great trees strewn hither and thither, bore witness to its violence, Nehemiah Lapham dis- covered just forty years ago, the mineral which the alchemy of his sons' enterprise and energy has transmuted into solid ingots of the most precious of metals." (25) By way of contrast note the language ascribed to Lapham, who with his "unliterary habit of mind" had given Bartley this unadorned version: '"My father found it one day, in a hole made by a tree blowing down" ' (6-7). Bartley himself is cynical enough to under- stand that the average newspaper reader will unwittingly ingest this sort of swollen diction as "sincere reporter's rhetoric" (4).</page><page sequence="21">William Dean Howells 21 In his use of colloquial metaphors in the speech of his characters, however, Howells's condescending attitude toward figurative language is most apparent. To begin with, Lapham's figures of speech, although at times colorful and engaging, provide one of the chief means by which the reader identifies the man's offensive chauvinism regarding his business enterprise. Lapham is at his provincial best when boastfully waxing figurative over his paint. The product "will stand like the everlasting hills" (13), he tells Bartley; it is "like my own blood to me" (20); or to achieve its high quality, he piously asserts, "I mix it with Faith" (22). But it is in the dialogue of a conversation between Tom Corey and Walker, Lapham's bookkeeper, that Howells deliberately spins out the longest colloquial metaphor in the novel, providing at the same time a strongly derogatory comment upon it. Walker, guardedly re- ferring to Lapham's moody withdrawal into his office following a series of business reversals, likens the situation to a spell of bad weather. Corey at first misses the analogy and then responds indif- ferently to the symbolism: "Well, sir, I guess there's a cold wave coming." Corey looked up innocently, and said, "I haven't read the weather report.". ".Yes, sir," Walker continued, "it's coming. Areas of rain along the whole coast, and increased pressure in the region of the private office. Storm-signals up at the old man's door now." Corey perceived that he was speaking figuratively, and that his meteorology was entirely personal to Lapham. "What do you mean?" he asked, without vivid interest in the allegory.... (381-82) Walker then launches into a gusty extension of the metaphor, providing Corey with colorful hints but very little substantial in- formation: "I guess the old man's taken in sail.... There seems to be a kind of a lull-kind of a dead calm, I call it.... Oh, I don't say but what the old man's got anchors to windward," and so on. Howells himself intrudes at the conclusion of Walker's specu- lations to malign the "slangy and figurative excesses" (382) he had placed in the bookkeeper's mouth. Howells's frequent self-conscious references to the metaphors he uses amply demonstrate an underlying resistance to figurative language. The theatrical metaphor he deliberately forsakes at the beginning of Venetian Life as well as the repudiation of Walker's</page><page sequence="22">22 Nineteenth-Century Fiction "allegory" and "figurative excesses" in Silas Lapham are convincing examples of his nonsymbolic aesthetic plainly at work in his style. Reluctant then to exploit metaphoric language in any bold or sig- nificant manner, as the analysis of metaphor in Silas Lapham sug- gests, Howells directs the thrust of his style toward an external dramatization of subjective truths. A faithful nonfigurative rendering of action, dialogue, and setting in a Howells novel usually provides the visible continuum of experience from which the reader is expected to infer a good deal about the inner life of the fictional characters. Howells's initial distrust of the suitability of any written language for representing truth (as expressed in Venetian Life and Italian Journeys) as well as the circumspection and disdain he shows toward figurative language in particular (as evidenced in Silas Lapham) coincide with his overall distrust of the aesthetic point of view originally identified with his treatment of reverie. Henry James, who had supreme faith in the symbolic power of language for rendering truth-for getting beneath the surface of objects and phenomena and giving imagistic shape to their sub- jective qualities-recognizes the limits of Howells's style in this respect. Referring to the descriptions in Surburban Sketches (1871), he says that Howells "seems to have resolved himself... [into] one who can write solely of what his fleshly eyes have seen," and does not have "a really grasping imagination." 17 Howells's apparent fear of the disorderly and uncertain operations of fancy in the reveries dramatized in his writings goes a long way to sub- stantiate this charge. Referring shortly afterwards to James's travel sketches as they were appearing in the Nation (later to be collected under the title Transatlantic Sketches), Howells writes to James: "I should say that you tended a little too much to the metaphysical expression of travel, as opposed to the graphic." 18 Howells's stylistic ideal is a graphic one, as opposed to James's symbolic uses of language that reach behind appearances to metaphysical mean- ings. A photographic style would be the highest achievement for Howells, one that would "do ... the spirit" as well. The metaphors examined in Silas Lapham are in no way con- 17.

The longest mental episode in the novel is the embarrassing scene of Lapham's inebriation at the Corey dinner party in which Howells is more concerned with dramatizing the absence of mental processes than with inquiring into any profound thoughts or feelings Silas might be experiencing. But reverie is a predominant mode of mental activity in other Howells novels, and Howells's treatment of it clearly reflects his stylistic belief that the closest approximation to a "graphic" representation would be discursive descriptions of thought content, plain statements of such ideas as are ascribed to Geoffrey's foolish musings in "A Dream." Figurative representa- tions, such personifications as we saw in Annie's nocturnal thoughts or in the narrator's fanciful response to Mantua, are theoretically too far removed from the actual truth for Howells to continue using them. It is readily apparent in the early novels prior to Silas Lapham that Howells increasingly associates reverie with mental lawless- ness. Geoffrey's "foolish thoughts" and the Venice reverie are recognizable signs of this predilection. Reveries ascribed to Kitty Ellison in A Chance Acquaintance (1873) and to Ferris (a young man of an artistic temperament) in A Foregone Conclusion (1875) do not inflict any significant self-destruction or lasting harm to others. The characters quickly master their vagrant impulses and do not let the inherent immorality of their thoughts gain the upper hand.'9 Bartley Hubbard, in A Modern Instance (1882), is How- ells's first fictional character in whom the potential immorality of self-deceptive egotism gradually emerges to culminate in real tragedy. Howells clearly charts the course of Bartley's moral de- cline by an extensive use of the reverie situation. We have already noted Bartley's spurious journalistic aesthetic in Silas Lapham. An examination of his decidedly immoral reverie-thoughts in A Mod- ern Instance will properly prepare us for a consideration of the un- comfortable convergence of immorality and aesthetics in A Hazard of New Fortunes. Howells dramatizes at length several of Bartley's reveries which occur during his courtship with Marcia Gaylord and later after 19. A Chance Acquaintance (Boston, 1894 [1873]), pp. 233-37, and A Foregone Con- clusion (Boston, 1875), pp. 128-29.</page><page sequence="24">24 Nineteenth-Century Fiction their marriage. The main concern of the novel is in fact to show how this reverie-prone young man is primarily responsible for the increasing incompatibility between himself and his wife. When his latent immorality becomes visibly manifest to others in his un- ethical conduct (he plagiarizes material for a feature article), Bartley dimly begins to feel, in brief intervals of self-assessment, "a curious sense of moral decay" in himself and a need to make "some little moral reforms." 20 Howells's censuring hand is heavi- est in representing Bartley's most damning reverie near the end of the novel just before Bartley abandons Marcia. The reverie, as Howells seems to have understood its intimate but not clearly de- finable point of contact with preconscious and unknowable psychic impulses, is the ideal mental situation for conceptualizing this extreme stage of Bartley's moral demise: His thoughts wandered to conditions, to contingencies, of which a man does not permit himself even to think without a degree of moral dis- integration. In these ill-advised reveries he mused upon his life as it might have been if he had never met her, or if they had never met after her dismissal of him. Howells spells out the specific content of Bartley's thoughts as the restless husband continues to indulge his straying impulses. The representation is entirely discursive, with no resort whatever to figurative language in describing the forbidden conditions and contingencies of the young man's musings: He sometimes questioned whether he had not made a great mistake to get married; he expected now to stick it through; but this doubt oc- curred to him. A moment came in which he asked himself, what if he had never come back to Marcia that night when she locked him out of her room? Might it not have been better for both of them? She would 3oon have reconciled herself to the irreparable; he even thought of her happy in a second marriage; and the thought did not enrage him; he generously wished Marcia well. He wished-he hardly knew what he wished. The subterranean truth is disturbing enough so that Bartley must for the time being suppress it. In Howells's mind, as he continues the description of Bartley's mental processes, such reverie-induced 20. A Modern Instance (Boston, 1882), pp. 372-73; further references in my text are to this edition.</page><page sequence="25">William Dean Howells 25 thoughts are finally seen to be the product of "fancies" alien to a "sane and waking state." The reverie concludes as Bartley, like the narrator of the Venice reverie, is made sufficiently uncom- fortable by his mental irresponsibility to put aside his fantasies, to seek a change in his mental relation with the world. Bartley, how- ever, is not capable of bringing his fancies and impulses under permanent control: He wished nothing at all but to have his wife and child back again as soon as possible; and he put aside with a laugh the fancies which really found no such distinct formulation as I have given them; which were mere vague impulses, arrested mental tendencies, scraps of undirected revery [sic]. Their recurrence had nothing to do with what he felt to be his sane and waking state. But they recurred, and he even amused him- self in turning them over. (376-77; italics mine) The implication, in Howells's plain strong language, is that Bart- ley's contemplation of a permanent separation from Marcia repre- sents a degree of lawless fancy and moral disintegration that borders on insanity. It is also clear that Howells is eager to apolo- gize for the inadequacy of his straightforward nonfigurative lan- guage. He feels that it is impossible to represent accurately the prearticulate fragments of Bartley's thoughts and feelings. Even a style free from any metaphoric suggestiveness cannot satisfactorily make distinct formulations of subjective experience. Howells's concern with the aesthetic falsification of life is most clearly dramatized in A Hazard of New Fortunes (1890), written at the height of his literary powers. In this novel the uncertain aesthetics hinted at in the travel books fully coalesce with the im- moral posture assigned to Bartley Hubbard's reveries. Basil March, sometime poet and editor of Every Other Week (and the most autobiographical of all Howells's fictional characters), struggles against the unreality of sustaining his aesthetic relations with the world. As might be expected, March frequently succumbs to reverie, as numerous mental episodes in the novel attest. Mrs. March's characterization of her husband's temperament suggests that he is capable of the same tenuous view of the world depicted in the Venice reverie. Although she has "the greatest admiration of his mind and respect for his character," she deplores "his absent- minded, dreamy inefficiency" as well as "the native lawlessness of</page><page sequence="26">26 Nineteenth-Century Fiction his temperament." 21 This is precisely the susceptible cast of mind to be endangered by wayward aesthetic perceptions. Howells is at some pains in the novel to indicate a change in March's aesthetic posture, especially as seen in Basil's response to the poverty and squalor of New York City's tenement district. His feelings are initially ambivalent, because he sees the impover- ished scenes both artistically, as material for literary sketches, and morally, as a social condition that causes severe human suffering. Near the beginning of the novel Howells recalls attitudes of the past to show that Basil and Isabel have achieved some measure of moral responsibility since their more innocent days: "The time had been when the Marches would have taken a purely aesthetic view of the facts as they glimpsed them in this street of tenement- houses; when they would have contented themselves with saying that it was as picturesque as a street in Naples and Florence, and with wondering why nobody came to paint it" (21). Older now, Basil has tempered his purely aesthetic view with a real concern for the human pain that underlies the picturesque conditions. Talk- ing with Conrad Dryfoos, the earnest social reformer, about his intended literary sketches, he emphasizes the aesthetic necessity of composing "contrasts of luxury for the sake of full effect" (50). But immediately thereafter March at least partially repudiates this artistic stance, recognizing the greater moral propriety of young Dryfoos's strict humanitarian concern for the poor. Never- theless, as he complains to Isabel, he cannot fully resolve his quan- dary. He cannot see any viable way of bringing together his moral perceptions and his literary inclinations: ' "I confess I was a little ashamed before him afterward for having looked at the matter so entirely from the aesthetic point of view. But of course, you know, if I went to work at those things with an ethical intention explicitly in mind, I should spoil them"' (50). March, expressing the same essential incompatibility between the aesthetic requirements of his craft and the ethical implications of his personal perceptions that Howells must have felt, clings for some time to his artistic concerns. On his way through the tenement district to visit Lindau, Basil still experiences an ever-present "sense of the neglected op- portunities of painters in that locality" and feels that artistic im- pulse to "have it down in his sketch-book at once" (63). As March more and more discovers his own "sense of complicity" 21. (New York, 1890), p. 25; further references are in my text.</page><page sequence="27">William Dean Howells 27 with life around him, however, he is increasingly forced to recognize the purely aesthetic response as untenable. Life is not a "spectacle," but filled with the "forces of pity, of destruction, of perdition, of salvation." Squarely facing this realization, the Marches come to mourn the loss of their aesthetic innocence but understand that such a state is by itself an inadequate perspective for viewing life: "She lamented the literary peace, the intellectual refinement of the life they had left behind them; and he owned it was very pretty, but he said it was not life-it was death-in-life" (104-5). In his work the artist must do the best he can, knowing that the aesthetic limitations he imposes on real experience are inimical to the truth. If Basil March retrieves himself from aesthetic death-in-life, Angus Beaton, another artist in A Hazard of New Fortunes deeply infected with a reverie-prone cast of mind, is the embodiment of the moral failure inherent in the aesthetic point of view. Howells, interestingly enough, seems far more fascinated with representing Beaton's thoughts and feelings, although he is only a minor char- acter in the novel, than with dramatizing Basil's inner life, fre- quently taking the reader on lengthy excursions into Beaton's reveries. Beaton himself is every bit as self-centered and immoral as Bartley Hubbard. Unlike Bartley's discursive ramblings, how- ever, Beaton's reveries often take on aesthetic qualities which Howells conveys to the reader in the linguistic form of metaphor. As in the treatment of Walker's colloquial allegory in Silas Lap- ham, it is metaphor with a vengeance. The focal point of most of Beaton's reveries is Christine Dryfoos, whose affections he encourages because she appeals to him from an artistic point of view and because her naive attentions to him satisfy his insatiable ego. Otherwise he has no genuine respect for her. As the most artistically talented character in the novel, Beaton is in fact least capable of responding to "life" as Basil and Isabel come to recognize its humanitarian and moral dimensions. His aesthetic perspective has dehumanized him and made him re- sponsive only to his own selfish needs. Howells presents Beaton's debilitating aesthetic posture by having him think in consciously induced figures of speech conceived solely for their artistic "effect." Beaton's fanciful analogies primarily satisfy his artistic ego and do not contain any revealing subjective truths by which he can achieve self-understanding. Melodramatically posing in front of the "dull</page><page sequence="28">28 Nineteenth-Century Fiction fire" in his studio grate, he features himself the anguished romantic as he muses over his melancholic dissatisfaction with life: "It struck him there was a dull fire in his heart a great deal like it, and he worked out a fanciful analogy with the coals, still alive, and the ashes creeping over them, and the dead clay and cinders. He felt sick of himself, sick of his life and of all his works." Attribut- ing his misfortunes in general to the baseness of human nature, he does not attempt to pursue the philosophical or personal implica- tions of the thought but instead amuses himself with the effete notion that "he might get a Satanic epigram out of it some way." Finally as his thoughts turn specifically to Christine, he not only conceives of her in terms of metaphor and aesthetic effect but actually translates his mental images into an artistic sketch: But in the mean time that girl, that wild animal, she kept visibly, tangibly before him; if he put out his hand he might touch hers, he might pass his arm round her waist. In Paris, in a set he knew there, what an effect she would be with that look of hers, and that beauty, all out of drawingl They would recognize the flame quality in her. He imagined a joke about her being a fiery spirit, or nymph, naiad, what- ever, from one of her native gas wells. He began to sketch on a bit of paper from the table at his elbow vague lines that veiled and revealed a level, dismal landscape, and a vast flame against an empty sky, and a shape out of the flame that took on a likeness, and floated detached from it. The sketch ran up the left side of the sheet and stretched across it. Beaton laughed out. (57) For Beaton a serious human relationship is out of the question. Christine exists only to flatter his aesthetic sensibility. Toward the end of the novel, in a long meditation that culmi- nates in "a flash of reverie," Beaton continues to envision Christine in metaphoric terms that provide the only conceptual control he can exert over his own "life of inconsistencies." She is still "the wild animal" of his earlier musings, only now a "leopardess." Such metaphors, Howells implies in another apology for the limitations of language, are hardly adequate terms by which Beaton's self- deceptive feelings for Christine might be understood: "The fact cannot otherwise be put in terms, and the attraction which Chris- tine Dryfoos had for him, apart from this, escapes from all terms, as anything purely and merely passional must. He had seen from the first that she was a cat" (161; italics mine). Beaton's use of meta- phor reveals both the paucity of his own character and the inade-</page><page sequence="29">William Dean Howells 29 quacy of figurative language as a way of symbolically representing subjective truths. Howells, thus depicting Beaton's artistic tem- perament and its distorted human perspective, affirms that the un- controlled psychic energies he associates with reverie and artistic creativity are tinged with mental-even moral-irresponsibility. Acts of imagination and fancy lead to false relations with the world, just as in Beaton's case they create a false relation with Christine, who in the end violently rejects him. At this advanced stage in his career Howells's prejudices against the moral unreliability of the inventive faculties were deeply rooted and unalterable. The most concise evidence of this is in an article entitled "True, I Talk of Dreams" (1895) in which, among other things, he asserts that the dream state informs us "what the state of the lunatic, the animal, the devil is." 22 In going on to describe the free-wheeling operation of "imagination" in dreams, he belittles that faculty for its lawlessness and emphasizes the ne- cessity of keeping it under strict control. The imagination, he im- plies, is basically resistant to "truth": "Some loose thinkers sup- pose that if we give the rein to imagination it will do great things, but it will really do little things, foolish and worthless things, as we witness in dreams, where it is quite unbridled. It must keep close to truth, and it must be under law, if it would work strongly and sanely" (840-41). Howells seems unwilling, however, to pur- sue the logical implications of this statement as it applies to art and the creative process. He is reduced to making a nice distinction between the mental processes of dreaming and those associated with "literary invention." By the latter term he seems to imply the workings of the imagination under a strict and lawful con- trol: "In fact there is no analogy, as far as I can make out, between the process of literary invention and the process of dreaming. In the invention, the critical faculty is vividly and constantly alert; in dreaming, it seems altogether absent" (841). All of Howells's fictional representations of reverie and of the operation of fancy strain against the reticent qualifications of this allegation. Al- though he might consciously believe that the process of literary invention cannot properly function without the presence of a controlling "critical faculty," he shows again and again that the kind of temperament most capable of artistic creativity, as in the case of Basil March or Angus Beaton, is the kind least capable of 22.

His inherent fear of the vigorous workings of the imagination leads him to describe the mental qualities of his moral reprobates (like Bartley Hubbard) as being strikingly similar to those of his more artistically sensi- tive characters. Howells long before establishes in his early travel sketches, as we have seen, that literary invention cannot satis- factorily convey the virtual images of truth as it is perceived in real life. Howells's modification of the reverie convention to suit the needs of his own literary and ethical doctrines results in an uneasy compromise between art and morality. His fictional conceptions and literary style are on the whole restricted by an aesthetic posture controlled by underlying moralistic principles, forcing him to abandon symbolic uses of language as a means of interpreting reality to the reader. When he does use figures of speech, they are conceived as aesthetic and deceptive, functioning primarily to represent modes of perception incompatible with the moral truths he seeks to dramatize in his fiction.</page></plain_text>
