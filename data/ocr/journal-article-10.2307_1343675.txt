<plain_text><page sequence="1">Some Members of the Congress Richard Stern Photographs by Inge Morath 1 In most groups, there's a sort of commedia del l'arte distribution of roles. In families, factories, universities, corporations, people are known not only for their work, their looks, their social and economic status, but also for the characters they assume in the organization. So there are clowns and those who laugh at them, there are leaders and there are followers; some followers are worshipful, some resentful. Most people put on their organization-character as they put on their uniforms. It doesn't mean that the character isn't related to their temperament--they have, after all, chosen it as they have chosen what they wear-but it never represents all of what they are and often represents very little. It is a convenience, a way of smoothing the roughness of interaction. At a congress of writers, things are somewhat different. At the PEN Congress there were the clowns-writers, say, like Salman Rushdie, the young Anglo-Indian novelist; there were dour, cynical observers from the periphery-I think of Sven Delblanc, the Swedish novelist; there were writers who'd pulled themselves out of Pleistocene social pockets which they'd barely survived and which they record: here I think of Kenji Nakagami, the Japanese novelist, screenwriter, and critic. Writers' work may come out of some internal fixity which was, is, and always will be what is most them. Then comes the writer reading- This is a section from a book-length essay on the 1986 International PEN Congress called Penned In.

His response may be, "OK, they think I'm X. I'll show them Y." There is the pride of showing how much more there is to your talent: "I'll never repeat myself." As a matter of professional vitality, the writer tries to make his responses unique (even when, a true "believer," he is largely a vessel of his message). The heart of response is never-almost never?-ideology or ideas; it is always the powerful, eccentric expression which comes out of vitality, the sign that the writer is still with it. At the Congress, you saw writers whose prepared talks were full of wit and playfulness, picking up, in addition to applause, antipathetic reactions to which they responded by showing another part of themselves in their next talk. So Rushdie, dark, youthful, balding, charming an audience with standard literary anecdotes of vaunting self-depreca- tion-turning down an invitation to Downing Street because Indira Gandhi had disliked his book, then hearing that Mrs. Thatcher spoke to Mrs. Gandhi about "that fine young writer whom you met at lunch yes- terday"-became, a few hours later, a Confronter, one heavy with other Richard Stern's Noble Rot, Stories 1949-88, will be published in the fall of 1988.</page><page sequence="3">862 Richard Stern Some Members of the Congress people's burdens; he challenged "the American Writer" to clarify the discrepancy between America the Beautiful and America the Terrible.1 2 The writer's job is to know himself and others, which usually means a moral leveling. Occasionally, writers at the Congress spoke in this way and so fresh a note did it strike that they received extravagant applause. (On the second day, Amos Oz censured a panel of writers for assuming moral superiority. In addition to wild applause, he received a rhetorical right hook from Norman Mailer: "I didn't understand word one Oz said." The next time he spoke, Oz was as extreme in both opinion and rhetoric as any of the rest of us.) The Congress was a trying event for many. For the pleasure of every rhetorical triumph, every jolt of sympathy and enlightenment, every dose of self-oblivious fusion with one's peers, there was the suspicion of such easy pleasures, suspicion too of one's hunger for singular attention. The pleasure of moral outrage carries its bassorilievo of self-suspicion: "How elevated all this is. It's as if I'm back in Paris in the mid-1880s. There's a grand gala, the white-haired writer enters the room, receives the bows of ladies and gentlemen, pats the worshipful children on the head and takes his seat while the band plays a hymn to him written by Camille Saint-Saiens."2 At our congress, many writers elevated themselves by representing causes, movements, or the geography, demography, isolation, or tyranny of their countries. The New Zealand writer Michael Morrissey qualified all his comments as those of a writer from "a small country." (John Updike said that Morrissey came from that large nation called English.) Derek Walcott's obbligato was that he came from a historyless part of the earth, the little Windward Island of Santa Lucia. The Czech writer Jiri Gruisa unrolled a complicated parable about the governments which concocted divine certification for their imperialistic fraudulence and mal- 1. This was the question which provoked the response of Saul Bellow: "Writers don't have tasks. They have inspiration." Oddly, Rushdie's morning presentation was much like the first half of Bellow's: both writers played with the term "alienation," Bellow remembering when alienists were physicians to the mad, Rushdie saying that he came from an "alien nation." That is, his family was from Kashmir, Moslems in Hindu country, urban in an agrarian world, middle-class among the poverty-stricken. Now, in England, he still enjoyed "the useful condition" of alienation. Bellow reported an equally polylingual background. Born in French Canada, he spoke Russian and Yiddish with his parents, English in school, French in the streets; and the landlord was Sicilian. 2.

Updike descended for twenty-four hours from his rural literary factory with a lovely praise-song for the distant, benevolent government which appeared in the blue mailboxes where Updike dispatched man- uscripts and which brought him back celebrity and money. When Hans- Magnus Ensensberger remarked in his elegant, querulous English that Updike had turned the United States into a tiny, pastoral nation, Vasily Aksyonov, his five refugee American years empowering his English, said that indeed the United States was a pastoral country, filled with mountains, farms, tranquillity, and shepherds. Hundreds of writers, hundreds of worlds, yet there were these groupings, national and ex-national, sexual, ideological, even temporal. (In the China of 1984, where Death of a Salesman broke through an emotional dam, it was-as Americans saw it--1949.) For writers living under censorship, Franz Kafka was a political contemporary: no work was more often cited at the Congress than "In the Penal Colony"; for writers in countries which suffered the embarass if not the nausde of choice, Kafka was a psychological contemporary. 3 The Chief Confronter at PEN was Gtinter Grass. Burly, short, with a thick, black, droopy Charlie Chan mustache, dressed in a worker's Sunday suit, Grass looks like the local anarchist and atheist: foreign accent, pipe, large gestures. His voice is "baltisch tiickisch stubenwarm" (Baltic, wily, room-warm),3 and this went for his English (where "Baltic" became "German"). Grass can look as sweet as Pinocchio's-Disney's-Gepetto, as com- fortable as a pillow, but the Grass of the novels, poems, and drawings- "aufgewachsen zwischen dem Heiligen Geist und Hitlers Bild" (raised between the Holy Ghost and Hitler's picture)-is full of his favorite words: fury, rage, anger. We're always furious Already hoarse all over We're against everything; no use. So what can we do? What can we do with this rage? Mach doch was. Mach doch was.4 Do something. Do something. Take up the tin drum and beat it till the world changes. Reorganize the present and the past, campaign and keep your 3. Giinter Grass, "Kleckerburg," Ausgefragt (Berlin, 1967), p. 90. 4.

Grass kept coming to the microphone to take on the big guns, those whose celebrity equaled and books excelled his own, or those whose sense or rhetoric drew from the audience more applause than he received himself. He charged Saul Bellow with portraying a generous, prosperous America which omitted what he, Grass, had seen in the South Bronx- a third-world America, purulating under America's haughty nose. He charged the princely Peruvian novelist, Vargas Llosa, with pillorying Garcia Marquez as an ideological whore. In his lemon-striped blue shirt, the handsome Vargas Llosa looked down from the dais on the rumpled, bristling Balt, the Onkel-Dagobert anarchist surrounded by a corolla of pretty girls and apple-cheeked forty-year-olds, and unfurled, in charmingly broken English, the eloquence of humane concern. It was a confrontation destined more by anatomy than ideology, an icon of necessary collision. 4 Though it was a Congressional sport to take American writers down a peg-American writers played it as well as anyone-writers from states in which writers had almost sacred positions were not attacked. Usually this was because they uttered the shibboleths of alienation even as they radiated the comfort of state support." Often the dress of these writers proclaimed the schizophrenia: their clothes were aristocratically careless, as if to say, "I am bringing the way I am at home out for a walk. Aren't you lucky to get this peek at your betters?" Claude Simon, the sole representative of French prose-and the most recent Nobeliste-at the Congress, wore a leather, sheepskin-lined jacket over a tieless dress shirt. Here was the Hell's Angel as seen by French sartorial genius. Most of the West German writers were also tieless and wore sweaters or shirts with the top buttons undone. The views of Simon and the Germans were different, but in the Sartorial Common Market, they were frtres. They did not criticize each other and had a common enemy. Simon spoke about those "ordres du langage et duforme" which enabled him to distance himself from that "culture du masse" "cretinisee" by "les nefastes cineastes d'Amirique." Writers, he said, helped society imagine by making works like guns. As the sheepskin softened the aggressive leather of his jacket, so did the classic lilt of French prose soothe its violent content. Short, handsome, with a square, wry face, William Gaddis sat beside Simon.6 His suit was the most elegant at the Congress, a subtle assemblage 5. These, though, are preferable to the allegiance of official writers in censorship states. 6. He told me later that Simon had asked him how long they were supposed to speak. "Five or ten minutes," he'd answered. "But the guy went on for twenty-seven. I timed him."</page><page sequence="6">Critical Inquiry Summer 1988 865 .i? ?I:?:? ? ... Claude Simon of brown pleats, slits, and pockets. As for Gaddis' few minutes, they were the most revolutionary-and ignored-at the Congress, a furious, witty attack on the state's employment of the camouflage of sanctity to cover inherent- necessary- criminality. He was followed by Wang Meng, a thoughtful, white-haired, gentlemen in Western dress. A real revolutionary, Wang Meng compared the state to a body of water, which "may either bear a boat or capsize it." He himself had been capsized, but was now, according to the American scholar Judith Shapiro, in Congressional confrontation, a Capsizer (a member of the Politburo). In the "question period," she attacked both Wang and Lu Wenfu. How many people, she asked, had had to vet Lu's speech? And what did he have to say about Wang Meng's criticism of the depiction of sexuality in fiction? Mr. Lu said that he'd written the speech himself, but that he'd pass the other question on to Wang Meng. Mr. Wang rose and said that like people who only open a guest's present after the guest is gone so as not to show either greed or disappointment, he thought that sex too might be reserved for private time. Even filtered</page><page sequence="7">866 Richard Stern Some Members of the Congress through translation, the response was that of a man of wit and maturity.7 Mr. Wang was later defended by several Westerners who knew he'd been imprisoned for his liberal views and did not now abuse his new power. 5 Perhaps the toughest confronter of all was the Nicaraguan Minister of State Omar Cabezas. He was on a panel chaired by one of the blond, soft West Germans, Hans Christoph Buch.8 Cabezas is short, muscular, black-mustached; his black hair rises violently from an assertive brow; his perfect teeth flash a seducer's smile. "I am," he said, thirty-five years old, the son of Jose Maria Cabezas and Elietta Lacayo de Cabezas-she, a housewife, and he, a genius by profes- sion. A genius because he had to come up with a thousand ways of not starving. ... One day, when he was out of work, he kicked a can as he was walking down a street in our neighborhood and inside discovered instructions for making soap. He went home, took one of mama's pots, and experimented. It worked, and he repeated it in a bigger pot. It worked again, and he went out, got 7. Though the response was found unsatisfactory by most of the other writers there. A year later, Wang Meng, Minister of Culture, has the difficult job of acting as thermostat in the "anti-bourgeois" heat which sees the disappearance of the investigative writer Lu Binyan, a writer of whom, months earlier, Wang Meng could boast. In Beijing in February 1987, friends told me that Wang Meng six months earlier had said at a dinner that it was wonderful that Chinese writers-"even him," pointing at Lu Binyan-could write "whatever they wanted." During that same winter of 1987, students at Fudan University and the Beijing University of Foreign Studies (spurred by an editorial in a recent Beijing Review [24 Nov. 1986]: 22- 23) asked me why no Chinese had been awarded a Nobel Prize. "Was it politics?" I said the usual things about the capriciousness of prize-giving, but then said I thought the recent Chinese literature I'd read in translation showed a long retreat from the stories of Lu Xun and Yu Dafu in the 1920s and from the great writers of the Tang and Sung or the marvelous social and psychological analysts of Han and pre-Han times. Spend an hour reading Chuang Tzu, Mencius, or Han Fei Tzu-in Arthur Waley's Three Ways of Thought in Ancient China (London, 1939)-and you feel part of the contemporary world. Read the gifted, but laser- narrow, "problem-stories" of Zhang Jie, Shen Rong, Gu Hua, Ge Wujue, Wang Zengqi, or Jin Shui, and you know you are in a lively backwater. There is much doing, but you don't want to spend much time doing it. One reads for cultural insight, not for aesthetic transfiguration. In the comment periods, I contrasted Shen Rong's "At Middle Age" with Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibility. Most of the wonderful young men and women lit up and "saw" the difference. (Of course, I might have had a tougher time using Ann Beattie to wallop Ms. Rong, but the point still could have been made. "Modern" writers don't have to spell everything out.) 8. Next to him sat the Hungarian poet and scenarist Sindoor Csoori. On Csoori's right was Kofi Awooner, the Ghanian writer and diplomat. To Buch's left was the curly- headed Yugoslav cutie, Danilo Ki'; the mordant, professorial Sven Delblanc; and the easy- looking, biscuit-soft, bearded American novelist Robert Stone.</page><page sequence="8">Critical Inquiry Summer 1988 867 ..... ::: ..: : .:.. ?: ... ?:. ? ? , : , , ,,,,,,,: ? .?? Omar Cabezas a cauldron, and made soap for the block, later for the neighborhood and the city, and finally for the entire western part of the country. But in 1965, soap started coming from the big American companies, and that finished him. When Somoza's National Guard killed my father in 1979 for the crime of being my father, he was living in utter poverty. First the ones from the land of opportunity killed my father's hope. Somoza only completed the job by taking his life. Disgust, hatred, hero-worship, and boredom formed Cabezas. In the mountains, gnawed by solitude, broken by terrible marches, half starved, he had turned into human steel. His account of the transformation, Fire from the Mountain: The Making of a Sandinista, had made him a Latin American hero, the poet of Sandinism. No one at the Congress spoke</page><page sequence="9">868 Richard Stern Some Members of the Congress as he did: he had been there. If humanity is the persistence of being in the face of what wants to destroy it, Cabezas was as human as anyone else in the room. Yet there was excess in him. It came out as the sort of glow you see in triumphant athletes. Cabezas had to do with authority, impatience, contempt, and self-confidence. He had been hunted, he had killed, he'd driven his body through torture, he'd been betrayed, been punished, he'd punished and would punish. He was also something else that distressed every writer in the room: he was a censor. Cabezas defended himself: During American wars, there was censorship in the United States. We are at war. Yet it's not the way it is in Chile. Still, I want it to end, and it will end as soon as possible. In his blue denim workshirt, Sa~ndoor Csoori was heating up. His face looked like a gun. He'd seen how dictatorships started; he's been in Cuba, he lived behind the Iron Curtain. Always there were such defenses and sweet talk about future freedom. We thought hope meant freedom. It didn't. In the name of freedom terrible things are done. I can never agree to a state of limitation, to censorship. Cabezas took off his suit coat. Underneath was a grey sweater. Cigarette smoke shot from his nostrils. He said, "If totalitarianism comes back to Managua, I'll go back to the mountains." Delblanc spoke with the mordant self-mockery that was like a suit he put on in the morning. He had sat with friends in Eastern European rooms knowing the walls were tapped. The world had enough of tapped walls. The flamboyant, curly-headed, French-speaking charmer Danilo KiS said that totalitarianism was an art of destruction, cruelty, and crime whose instruments were deception and the mensonge. At this point, a burly old baldie rose from the floor. "I am," he said, "Raditsa. Founder of PEN. Sixty years ago, we had a Congress in Dubrovnik. I heard all this then." From the back of the room there was growling: Who was this old trout? Who cared about what he'd heard sixty years ago? A shout: "Mr. Chairman, exercise your authority. Shut him up." The shouter was that champion of liberty, Allen Ginsberg. At every session, he shuffled to the podium bringing petitions and mellifluous objections. His shapeless, colorless pants hung off his thin rump, his fat beard and bald head seemed too heavy for his neck. Coat, pants, and tie looked carefully selected from piles in the salvage shop. Our Whitman. Christoph Buch told Raditsa he had used up his time. The old fellow put on his beret and stomped out of the room.</page><page sequence="10">Critical Inquiry Summer 1988 869 Said Cabezas, "We only have poco censura. I'm uncomfortable with it, but it's necessary. If you're threatened by the most powerful country in the world, you have no option. Ten minutes after Reagan calls off his war, there will be no censorship. After the American Revolution, it took ten years for the country to have liberty of the press. Why question a nation that has existed only six or seven years?" Or a Congress of Champions who squelched their own. 6 The first and last confrontations of the conference were between Norman Mailer and some angry women. They were genuine confron- tations, deeper than anything the Congress itself discussed. From the beginning, literature has been enriched by feminine genius. Still, it is astonishing that there has been so little in literature of much that only women can know. So there's next to no description of pregnancy and childbirth. There is a famous scene in Sigrid Undset's Kristin La- vransdatter and, from less privileged positions, parallel scenes in Tolstoy, Zola, and Hemingway. There is the oblique, transfigured or symbolic account in Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, but until our own time this is, I think, about it.9 Many women writers never married; many who married had no children, and the few who did-Mrs. Gaskell, Colette-did not write about this physically and psychologically complicated experience. I myself learned more about it from my observant, articulate daughter's account of her pregnancy than I have in a lifetime of reading. Recently, the subject has come out of the closet. The poet Sharon Olds writes wonderfully about conception, pregnancy, and parturition; Shouri Daniels' The Salt Doll contains a horrific account of childbirth. Young women poets and prose writers have described, invented, and reinvented hundreds of subjects in the past two decades. If there is such a thing as a literary movement, I'd say that this is the most significant one of our time.10 That there were so few women writers present or speaking at the Congress became the charge leveled at Norman Mailer. "Out of one hundred and twenty panelists, only sixteen are women," said the petition some of the women drew up. Mailer listed the names of twenty-four women who had declined invitations to the Congress. (These included 9. See Ellen Moers' chapter, "Female Gothic," in Literary Women (Garden City, N.Y., 1976), pp. 90-110. 10. What counts in literature is the poem, the story, the novel. We read books, not movements. A movement is a way of dismissing literature (that is, a way of handling it). It is interesting to talk about movements because such talk elevates the talker and makes him feel he is taking a survey of many things. Literature, though, is the fusion of two minds-no, the fusion of one mind, the reader's, with the poem or story or novel. Anything else is conversation.</page><page sequence="11">870 Richard Stern Some Members of the Congress Doris Lessing, Mavis Gallant, Christa Wolf, Joan Didion, and, if I remember correctly, Simone de Beauvoir-who died a few weeks later.) As usual, Mailer fed the fire with oil. "There are not," he said, "that many women, like Susan Sontag, who are intellectuals first, poets and novelists second." This remark turned the roomful of PEN women into what a woman reporter called "a gigantic snake pit."" During the conference on drama,'2 an emissary from the Women's Committee entered hot from the fray, took the floor microphone, and, trembling with fury, read the Women's Petition. (I didn't catch her name.) I felt for her, felt for her passion and the hatred her insistence aroused in much of the audience. In one of the celebrated manifestos of the new feminism, Hlene Cixous writes, Listen to a woman speak at a public gathering (if she hasn't painfully lost her wind). She doesn't "speak," she throws her trembling body forward; she lets go of herself, she flies; all of her passes into her voice, and it's with her body that she vitally supports the "logic" of her speech. Her flesh speaks true. She lays herself bare. In fact, she physically materializes what she's thinking; she signifies it with her body. In a certain way she inscribes what she's saying, because she doesn't deny her drives the intractable and impassioned part they have in speaking. Her speech, even when "theoretical" or political, is never simple or linear or "objectified," generalized: she draws her story into history. ... Why this privileged relationship with the voice? Because no woman stockpiles as many defenses for countering the drives as does a man.... There is always within her at least a little of that good mother's milk. She writes in white ink.13 For PENites who had been insulated from passionate rhetorical seizures of the sort that were seen and heard at the meetings, this marvelous account may explain more than mystify. To hear this speaker or, the next day, to see that peculiarly lyric but essentially down-to-earth writer Cynthia Ozick pour her terrible anguish about Israel into an attack on Bruno Kreisky, or to have heard Judith Shapiro drive her pain into the Chinese writers Wang Meng and Lu Wenfu was to be amazed, shocked, and-in my case-infuriated. 11.

The writer has to pay for the ease of moral su- periority-alone at his typewriter, no one stops him-with some measure of frankness. Only he knows if the culpa he confesses is diversion from a greater one.14 In any case, like the average white Southerner facing those blacks galvanized into bravery and confrontation by Martin Luther King, Jr., I was infuriated at this intrusion. My ease, my habitual expectation, was subverted; my precious time was taken up by an intruder. Raucousness, rudeness, stridency, assertiveness: this was the vocabulary of visceral outrage. The enraged, trembling intruder was "mouthing simplicities" on these entrenched males and the female allies who took their stand. John Simon, rising from the self-churned foam of sexual swordsmanship, took the microphone-he also trembled-claiming that good writers were good writers, too bad so few of them were women, let them write better and earn their rewards. Luckily for the "intruder," Simon, a kind of marzipan Mailer, is incapable of marshaling anything but enmity. He was hissed more loudly than his glowering antagonist. I'd had enough. My son Christopher and I took off for a cold walk on the avenues. Half an hour later, back on Central Park South, we ran into Miller, who, as a speaker, had been manacled to the platform. "What happened, Arthur?" "Things went from stupid to stupider. You missed nothing." I let a bit of gallantry escape: "Fucking bitches." Minutes later, Christopher told me that Miller, a statesman of the Republic of Letters, Ex-President of International PEN, "blushed." (I'd only remarked his laugh.) I let this obscenity stay on the page because of an internal confidence that I don't have an ounce of chauvinist blood in me, at least, in my intellect. Yet, like a refined version-I think-of the Mailer of The Prisoner of Sex or the Napoleon who, well before Freud, said "anatomy is destiny," 14. Were earlier writers as concerned with establishing their position, or is modern literary self-consciousness part of the twentieth-century interest in the observer? Is anyone today as confident as George Bernard Shaw?: "An ... author may be as selfish as he likes without reproach from the public if only his art is superb, and he cannot fulfil this condition without sufficient effort and sacrifice to make him feel noble and martyred" (Shaw, Preface to The Doctor's Dilemma, Prefaces by Bernard Shaw [London, 1934], p. 246). Four decades later, W. H. Auden was more gnomic: Time that with this strange excuse Pardoned Kipling and his views, And will pardon Paul Claudel, Pardons him for writing well. (Auden, "In Memory of W. B. Yeats," The English Auden: Poems, Essays and Dramatic Writings, 1927-1939, ed. Edward Mendelson [London, 1977], pp. 242-43.)</page><page sequence="13">872 Richard Stern Some Members of the Congress I'm the creature of an obsolete tradition. The earliest reader I know of The Second Sex, I lent my copy to the girls at Connecticut College whom I proselyted with it in 1954. After that, my female characters were creatures of liberated intelligence; theirs and mine. Still, the anger crawling around my challenged superiority was there. I left the meeting, I said what I said, and caused Miller to blush. (His self-recognition?) 8 The superiority of a writers' congress to most others is that sooner or later almost every position will be taken by one writer or another. And, since most writers are in the business of coming clean, there is as much confession as indictment, contrition as accusation. Criticism, which is in the business of uncovering internal contradictions and, occasionally, their hypocritical facade, has a field day at such a congress. No wonder that so much periodical commentary focused on the discrepancy between the nobility of the writer's calling and the ignominy of his behavior or self-revelation. The commentary also fed on the rhetoric of discrepancy, the rhetorical color of the confrontations. The writer's solitary work is unchallenged except by those challenges his art imposes. Seduced from this solitude in which he takes all the sides and plays all the instruments, the writer often is stripped of caution as well as art. Instead of championing the complexity of positions, he becomes a Saint George of opinion and attacks creatures he diabolically magnifies. Moral purity is rarer than literary genius, though most writers in public talk are, like most people, "holier than thou." (My guess is that writers practice cynicism, indifference, and despair more than most people.) 9 Writers who become semipublic institutions have to keep removing the bronze and marble from their brains. Few have the nerve to be as nutty, angry, or closed-minded as they were when their specialness was incubating its first stories, poems, and plays. Take Bellow, for instance. Left to himself, unpressured, or even half-dreaming out loud, in public, no one is better at letting you see the writer at work. In the film Henri Clouzot made of Picasso, the camera is under a sheet of glass on which Picasso painted. You can see the painter's brush hesitate, see it decide and make its stroke; above, you see the great black eyes signal annoyance, pleasure, decision, idea. Yet Picasso was not completely lost on his painter's island. (He "destroyed" the four paintings which-who knows?-might survive on this film longer than the hundreds which were not painted &amp; la belle itoile of cinematic futures.)</page><page sequence="14">Critical Inquiry Summer 1988 873 When Bellow mixed memories of childhood with responses to remarks which had just been made around him, he was a Picasso on camera, a great improviser, Charlie Parker at the Onyx Club, Bach at the C6then organ. His fusion of modesty and creative security was unique at the Congress. (Arthur Miller's came close to it.) Bellow swears by the truth of his sensuous memory. (It is extraordinary.) As for his opinions, though he defends them powerfully, he knows that he runs into the dangers of "narrowness," "ideology," "special pleading," and "pedagogy." Old friends, we often have to agree to limit talk about certain subjects. I trust he won't mind if I offer one example. The summer before the PEN Congress, within three weeks of his seventieth birthday, his two brothers died. He was in a terrible state, and it made sense for me to drive with him to his summer place in Vermont. En route, we had a lot of laughs and a few disputes. The one I cite here began with Henry James. Bellow had been rereading The American Scene. "James thinks Italians are great in Italy, but not in New York. He treats them like garbage." When, a few minutes later, Bellow said something about another group, I triumphantly and angrily stuck him with his attack on James. The trap of contradiction angered him. "All art is ethnocentric," he said in his own-but not James'-defense. I think he meant that art springs from passion which rises from narrow encounters, local rage, adored specifics. Bellow's art isn't ethnocentric. In it, he is fair. What is contradictory in the man isn't contradictory in the artist. The artist uses the man's intensity. If it's roused by contradiction, the art becomes dramatically more interesting. Out of art, the contradictions shiver in logical cold. At the Congress, Bellow's public, "ethnocentric," "pedagogical" views followed hard upon his beautiful, dream-sharp reminiscence. These views were what was challenged by Guinter Grass and young Rushdie.15 Bellow is very good on his feet, and his responses to them made headlines.16 What really counted, the dreamy reminiscence, was scarcely mentioned. Then there's Updike. He has, as much as any well-known writer, insulated himself from the rare predicament of attack. He lives in small towns where he's the only writer of note, and he has published most of his work in a magazine which seldom prints letters of correction. In his few Congressional hours, you could see him sniffing out positions that 15. Rushdie is the editor of the English edition of Grass' political and social commentary. 16. Bellow said it was admirable of Grass to think of the South Bronx; he too thought of it. Then he said, with what Time's reporter, R. Z. Sheppard, called "patient grace": "I was simply saying the philosophers of freedom of the 17th and 18th centuries provided a structure which created a society by and large free, by and large an example of prosperity. I did not say there are no pockets of poverty." (R. Z. Sheppard, Time [27 Jan. 1986]: 77.) His private response-the next morning at breakfast--referred Grass, rather roughly, to The Dean's December (a novel, not a book of opinion).</page><page sequence="15">874 Richard Stern Some Members of the Congress ~~:?h&amp;* .7~.?. ?

Doctorow would pacify his attackers. He was not exactly throwing in the ideological towel; his "ideology" was not a political or social position but the beauty of expression. His talk was a lyric pledge of allegiance to the "tribe" in which he'd grown. Its totems were the stars and stripes, the eagle, and, especially, the postal system, represented by the blue mailbox in which he sent off his stories and the kind, uniformed postman who brought back the delighted responses and checks which supported him. Challenged by Ensenzberger, Updike's counter was a gentle retraction: "The Nation- State might be on the way out. ... It's done a lot of harm." The retraction was not made less attractive by stammer and blush. The boyishness of many gifted writers-especially writers who grow up in reasonably tranquil worlds-has much to do with the past they celebrate in their work. The greatest of such writers, Marcel Proust, always seems to be the same age. The writer and the boy are one: eager for experience and the words which fix it, yet almost simultaneously nostalgic for it. At seventy, Bellow has much of this quality, and, at fifty- four, Updike was acquiring more of it. As he opened himself more and more to his real past rather than the lyric gemmification which substituted for it in his earlier work-every grass-blade and gonadal croak heavy with lyric jewelry-his stories and essays have become finer and truer.</page><page sequence="16">Critical Inquiry Summer 1988 875 (The beautiful account of his psoriasis which appeared in The New Yorker the spring before the Congress may be his finest essay.) 10 There might have been another reason for Updike's blushes, one which also explained the brevity and relative invisibility of his stay. For years now, he's been publishing criticism. Many Congress authors bore the welts of his attention. Of Kobo Abe's book Secret Rendezvous, Updike wrote that it "is all plastic and aluminum, a shiny mess from its dust jacket in.""17 About Grass' The Meeting at Telgte, he said it was "a lead paperweight (HTS, p. 475); about The Flounder that, instead of a plot, it had "a welter of programs," "what happens when a novelist performs every service for us but his intrinsic one of rendering events" (HTS, pp. 478, 480).18 Bellow, too, carried an Updikean welt (though Updike made it clear that Bellow is not just "a very good writer" but-this with some reluc- tance-a great one) (HTS, p. 263). Still, he clearly relished showing up "the hollowness" of The Dean's December. As for Susan Sontag, the Updike flick was "our glamorous camp follower of the French avant-garde" (HTS, p. 577). In short, Updike was treading on glass (and Grass) he had broken and scattered over The New Yorker and his wonderful book of criticism, Hugging the Shore. 11 The writers who had been most described, photographed, and- usually-bought were composed of their critical welts as well as their creative wealth. Bellow had bashed-as well as been bashed by-Updike, Grass bashed Bellow, Bellow Grass. Many of us had reviewed each other's works in and out of print. Of course writers had also praised each other, were indeed more than anyone else the promoters of each other's celebrity. Susan Sontag was the most lavish praiser. She distributed it like a Commissar.19 She 17. John Updike, Hugging the Shore: Essays and Criticism (New York, 1983), p. 741; hereafter abbreviated HTS. 18. Updike can't get enough Grass-bashing. In Grass' Headbirths; or, The Germans Are Dying Out, he saw "a novelist who has gone so public he can't be bothered to write a novel; he just sends dispatches to his readers from the front lines of his engagement" (HTS, pp. 482-83). 19.

Hardwick, herself a champion Commissar of Praise and Blame, a member of more literary award com- mittees than any writer in America, had not been ungenerous to Sontag: "Susan Sontag: the name is a resonance of qualities, of quality itself... an extraordinarily beautiful, expansive, and unique talent.20 So the Congress was to a degree a meeting of statues sculpted and defaced by each other. Even those of us who felt outside the pantheon could be gratified and insulted.21 Writers would say how much they loved this book or that, or, more generally-asking a writer directions to a john-one heard "Aren't you X or Y?" or even "What a wonderful writer you are."22 Off and on the platform, the writers were making and remaking each other. It was too intense, and that part of themselves which counted most-the place where alone they were dream-gods making up the worlds they wanted-sent up warning signals to the public self, "Enough. Come home." Thursday night there was a choice of four or five parties. One was given by Giinter Grass' publishers to celebrate another edition of his book The Flounder. I didn't like the book, and though I rather like Grass, he'd served himself up generously during the day; one didn't need him after hours. The Canadian ambassador was giving a party somewhere on the Avenue of the Americas, and The New York Times, which by now seemed the bank in which the Congress daily deposited itself, was giving a party at the New York Public Library. The party given by the National Arts Club in its headquarters on Gramercy Park sounded most appealing. I spoke to a Japanese in the lobby, a Mr. Sodie. He was going down there too. We went out in the cold night, walked down Fifth Avenue, then, failing to get a cab, over to Lexington. Mr Sodie had written a best- seller, a biography of General MacArthur. On its strength, he'd been made a professor at one of Tokyo's two hundred universities. Now, at fifty-three, he planned to retire. Unfortunately, his next book, an account of Japanese-Americans who had returned to Japan-many to Hiro- shima-before World War II, had not been a great success. "The bomb is a subject no Japanese wants to read about." In the cab we finally found, he told me his family name means "sleeve." "It comes from the mistress of a samurai from Hokkaido. Her shrine-our family shrine-is there." 20. Elizabeth Hardwick, Introduction to A Susan Sontag Reader (New York, 1982), p. lx. 21. My old student, Bob Coover, had received a new novel of mine. "Still at it," he said, the only harsh note in an otherwise harmonious reunion, and, of course, the note I remember best. 22. When I introduced myself to Doctorow, his eyes widened: "Richard Stern! You're famous." As peculiar a reaction as I've ever had, it came from the atmosphere of publicity we all breathed and all hated even as we participated in it. For so sensitive a man as Doctorow, the word probably wasn't. It just meant that someone he knew had read something of mine he liked; he, Doctorow, wanted to pass off a goody and get on with his errand.</page><page sequence="18">Critical Inquiry Summer 1988 877 The Arts Club is in one of the beautiful brownstones that surround Gramercy Park. It had belonged to Samuel Tilden, who's remembered for getting a larger popular vote than Rutherford B. Hayes in the election of 1876 and for leaving a fortune to what became the New York Public Library. His old house was aglow, servants circulated with trays of caviar and salmon, chicken and beef, champagne and gliihwein. Coffee and tea were served from silver urns. I talked to the Spanish novelist Juan Benet, who looks like a tall Chester Conklin, the cross-eyed cop in the Keystone Comedies (except Benet isn't cross-eyed). He said he'd be glad to speak in French, German, Spanish, or English; we spoke in the only one in which I feel comfortable. A civil engineer, he'd begun writing during a period of intense boredom when he lived next to a dam whose construction he was supervising. He was now finishing a four-volume work. "What's it about?" I asked. That seemed to puzzle him. He said there wasn't much story. "Who are the leading characters?" Yes, he said, there were characters, but they weren't important. No story and no characters. My face questioned the enterprise. "It's about military engagements." The first engagement was based on a campaign of Stonewall Jackson, a general he much admired. Of course, he'd transferred the locale to northern Spain. "How so?" "It's where my father's family comes from. My mother's Catalan." "And you?" "They met and married in Madrid. I was born there." Who were the writers he liked? Well, he didn't like Saul Bellow, who'd been on the panel with him the day before. Ah, whom did he like? Well, he liked Thomas Bernhard, the Austrian writer, "the greatest German writer of our times." (Implied here, I thought, was criticism of Grass. Benet was not high on what surrounded him.) He also liked Beckett, and then he liked one book by an American writer, Philip Roth. It was Goodbye, Columbus. I couldn't make much literary sense out of this. I hadn't read much Bernhard,23 but who was to say what canon makes sense for a writer? Now that I have looked at some of Benet's work, in particular the "novel" Un Viaje de invierno (the title translates Schubert's Die Winterreise), I un- derstand an alliance to the three advanced B's. Benet writes exhaustively about topography and minute variations in such small events as invitations to a party. The book covers next to no narrative ground of the sort my sort of writer traverses. What I read was not to my taste, although I did relish what seemed to my limited Spanish beautiful sentences and para- graphs. (Not much happens in Bernhard, but next to Benet he looks 23.

In one of his stories, two men walk outside the theater: one hates the plays on which he has written a dissertation; the other loves them but won't go to a theater.24 My old friend Betty Fussell appeared. I introduced her to Benet, who lit up, not, as it turned out, for Betty-though most men do light up for her-but for an extremely pretty, dark-haired woman. "This is my wife," he said warmly. (The popsicle had turned into a muffin.) Across the room, surrounded by women, was the notorious critical assassin, John Simon. That afternoon at the drama session, he'd been roundly booed when he'd denounced the furious reader of the Women's Petition and prattled on about the aristocracy of art and the foolishness of sexual quotas. He's a rather charmingly terrible fellow. After a while you realize that he's worked up his fastidious fury to cover a lazy intelligence. In New York, though, well-phrased slander pays the rent and gets you girls. The only time we had met was with our then common agent, Lois Wallace, and my friend, the brilliant poet Eleanor Lerman. In the first minute, Simon flattered me by remembering that a page from a story of mine had been omitted from both the English and American versions of the book in which it had appeared; in the second, he was displaying excellent French to the waiter; in the fifth, he'd disparaged the body of the well-known dancer who was coming over to sleep with him that night. The disparagement was specific and colorful. Simon himself looks like an agreeable ship's steward and wears excellent suits which-a gossiper told me-were bought for him by a famous heiress. The same gossiper told me that his present companion was Alexandra Iles, the young woman who had been called back from Europe to testify against her former lover, Claus von Billow. After our lunch in New York, I walked Eleanor back to her office. She said she didn't know if she could go to work, Simon had sickened her so she felt she'd throw up. "I've never met a real woman-hater before." 12 One of the lines about the PEN Congress which was quoted sometimes straight, sometimes derisively, in quotation marks, was "the greatest col- lection of literary talent ever assembled." There's no doubt that lots of talent gathered on Central Park South, but there was also a tremendous absence. In fact, absence became one of the Congress' unscheduled subjects. To a degree, of course, absence is always on PEN's agenda. One of the things it does best is call attention to the mistreatment of writers, to their imprisonment and censure. At 24. See Thomas Bernhard, "Zwei Erzieher," Prosa (Frankfurt, 1967), pp. 7-15.</page><page sequence="20">Critical Inquiry Summer 1988 879 this meeting, the PEN Prison Committee announced that there were four hundred and fourteen writers in various jails around the world. (There was no higher certificate of their social importance than this.) The gentle and disheveled Heberto Padilla recited a list of his friends in Cuban jails, Adam Zagajewski a list of his colleagues in Polish jails. George Konrad, the Hungarian novelist, round, horn-rimmed, and professorial, said he'd just heard of a poet and an actor who'd been jailed that week in Rumania. In a way, then, the writers in New York were the flesh extensions of imprisoned shadows. In my first New York hour, I waited for a St. Moritz elevator-funereally slow-with a man I first thought was Mario Vargas Llosa. This face, though, was more lined, the eyes recessive, less full of flash. In sleeveless sweater and tweed coat, the man resembled those lost-cause heroes Yves Montand plays in his political movies. He spoke Spanish-in a quiet baritone to a young American who seemed to be his guide. Later, I saw his picture in a PEN newsletter. His name is Hiber Conteras. A university instructor, a Methodist minister, and a reporter, he'd been imprisoned in Uruguay from December 1976 to March 1985. Tortured, he managed in his prison years to write four novels and a collection of short stories. Five months after his release, his only son, an agricultural laborer on a Nicaraguan cooperative, was killed by Contras along with thirty-nine other volunteers. Conteras' presence was heavy with other people's absence. There are different sorts of absence. In Africa, I'd met many writers and would-be writers. In Lome, Kigali, Cotenu, and Freetown, they came up to me after talks. Some had copied their novels by hand in school notebooks; some had their papers searched by police; many had decided there was less point in writing than working for the government even if that made them censors of other writers. None of these writers were at the St. Moritz. (I guess our average age was fifty.) This meant that there were hundreds, even thousands of young writers, many of them first rate, who were also absentees. If they were PEN members, they probably couldn't afford the dues and costs of a New York week. Of course there were many established writers of the first rank who weren't there: Borges-dead in June 1986-and Beckett, Solzhenitsyn and Salinger, Pinter and Pynchon, Roth and Robbe-Grillet. There were very few French, Spanish, Italian, or Portuguese writers. There were some McCarran-Walter absentees, writers who'd been refused entry to the United States in the past: such as Graham Greene- who decided never to come again, or those like Garcia Marquez who had been given a limited visa, which he rightly refused as degrading.25 Eug5ne Ionesco, Tom Stoppard, and Wole Soyinka were male panelists who 25. George Shultz had promised the writers that the United States would no longer use McCarran-Walter to bar anyone except direct fomenters of subversion.</page><page sequence="21">880 Richard Stern Some Members of the Congress didn't show up. A panelist who came but stayed invisible was Jorge Amado, who arrived with a Brazilian bug that kept him in his St. Moritz room. (Perhaps that bug was the source of the Delegate Flu with which several of us left at the end of the week.) As for the Soviet writers, Mr. Markov of the Writers' Union announced that they would have been contaminated by those "disseminators of hatred," the emigre writers who had fled the soft embrace of the east. (Apparently the Gorbachev thaw was up to melting missiles but not words.) The American writer Toni Morrison spoke of still another sort of absentee. She said that she was here because "some black children got their brains shot out in the street all over this country" and had "the 'good fortune' to be televised." I am a read writer (as opposed to an unread one), because of those children.... Had I lived the life the State planned for me from the beginning ... I would have lived and died in somebody else's kitchen, on somebody else's land, and never written a word. The absent children were part of what earned Morrison the following salute in Newsweek: For sheer glibness, it was hard to beat the grandstanding gesture of black American writer Toni Morrison. Sporting an extravagantly wide-brimmed Caribbean sun hat, Morrison proclaimed that "at no moment of my life have I ever felt as though I were an Amer- ican." The rhetorical excess prompted many to wonder whether some Western writers are perversely envious of the victims of true political repression.26 Sporting, extravagantly, proclaimed, rhetorical, excess, perversely. Well, I don't know. Every speaker has his own form of rhetoric. Was Mrs. Morrison lying? Wrong maybe, foolish perhaps, but for me she was vivid and truthful. If she didn't feel American, who has the right to question what it is to feel that one is American? (Is this a virtue?) Surely writers who have suffered in the jails of other countries, who have been censored, silenced, searched, pushed around, punched, and starved, who have had wires wrapped around their gonads and knives driven under their fin- gernails, have known what Mrs. Morrison never knew; but she had knowledge, and her pains are as authentic as theirs. South African writers can be told it's worse in the Soviet Union, and perhaps Soviet writers in the Gulag can be told that Auschwitz was worse. That isn't the point. Writers don't deal in comparative misery. They write what they feel, and feelings are not distributed along party lines. All right, dead is dead, and 26.

What the exciting, dangerous streets are to a kid from the projects, so the lobby is to the person Pascal condemned as a troub- lemaker, the one incapable of being alone in his own room. There were two main lobbies at the conference, or rather one lobby-at the St. Moritz-and a series of anterooms outside the Casino on the Park. These</page><page sequence="23">882 Richard Stern Some Members of the Congress last rooms were used to distribute press releases, coffee, and water. After the sessions, panelists were interviewed there by reporters. The St. Moritz lobby was small-a few square yards to the left of the entrance and a few more in a square around the bank of elevators between the information desk and the Caf6 de la Paix. The smallness augmented the lobbiness. People stood around cheek to jowl with other people. Talk with strangers was a matter of friction; you were not being forward. Grass was a constant lobbyist, surrounded by young Germans who either amplified or laughed at his remarks. Another was Joyce Carol Oates. She and her husband, Raymond Smith, were there in a space of their own. They talked to no one, no one talked to them. There was a vividness of abandonment about them. Oates herself is not vivid. If anything, she's the reverse. There are odd extrusions from her hunched thinness, a large Adam's apple, thick lips-darkened with lipstick when she appeared on a panel, but usually as colorless as the rest of her- immense, hyperthyroid dark eyes, usually screened by glasses, and a cap of light brown curls. Despite the peculiarities, she seemed to aspire to invisibility. Is this thrustlessness related to her extraordinary productivity? "Nat- urally, the woman's a rind," one tells oneself. "Every ounce of juice has gone into her work." I'd never finished a novel of hers, but was an admirer of many of her stories. I had read two-thirds of her novel them. It follows a group of people all of whom dream their way through life. The dreaming is punctuated by violence, shootings, robberies, assaults-none of which have consequences for the action. The murderers and robbers go un- detected and spend very little time thinking about what they've done. You're immersed in the characters, but since they all think life's a dream and that nothing really exists or that what happens to them really counts, you begin to think this yourself. Why bother going on? You do go on though, half mesmerized, as the author seems to be, by the prosy rhythm of event-reporting. Now and then a real observation flashes through the paragraphs. Mostly though, one drifts in the sullen-a favorite Oates word-experience of these submerged people. A literary daughter of Theodore Dreiser, or better, James T. Far- rell-who would not go to sleep till he'd written ten pages, the assemblage of which constitutes a cemetery of prose fiction-Oates writes as people eat and breathe. Perhaps that's why, standing in the lobby, she seemed so set apart, a creature from another medium. She gasped helplessly, away from the typewriter or her dreaming space. It didn't appear as if she were observing anything or anyone, storing up notes for her current fiction; no, she was just there, a dutiful citizen of literature, perhaps waiting for a character to kidnap her, for the ticket back home to the typewriter. We were all away from what counted most, but no one seemed farther from there than Oates.</page><page sequence="24">Critical Inquiry Summer 1988 883 This is what I thought of Oates as I watched her. Then, back in Chicago, I read what she'd said to Claudia Drefuss about not signing the Women's Petition protesting the paucity of women at the Congress. "I really agree with you, but it's very complicated, and Norman's having such a difficult time that he's been in a difficult state all week. He worked very hard on this Congress, and Ijust can't sign.""27 A very decent refusal I thought, not at all the response of a martian or a human rind. Then I read the last hundred pages of them, a section that begins with something that violated the Jamesian canon defined by Percy Lub- bock.28 The narrative is "interrupted" by letters to the author from the main character, whom the novel's preface has identified as one of Oates' ex-students. The letters to Oates are confessional, observant, resentful, and well written. They speak enviously of Ms. Oates' intelligence, wit, coolness, and love of books. The writer says she's seen Oates' husband drive her to school in a black Volkswagen. She envies this attentive love. For James/Lubbock, a novel was not supposed to lean on any reality but its own. The leaning destroys the aesthetic independence. I usually feel as they do, but I admired the boldness of the device, especially when I saw what it did. It woke Oates, or at least the novel, up. Suddenly the book's fog is dispersed. In a few pages there's an intense and beautiful erotic scene. Nadine is twice brought to the edge of her erotic cell but then left locked up there by Jules (through whom, oddly enough, we see the scene). The finale is an eruption of violence, which unlike the deadened, meaningless, inconsequential violence of the book's first two-thirds, is consequential and powerful. Nadine shoots Jules- not quite to death-then shoots and wounds herself. The next chapters are also vivid. Maureen falls in love with her English teacher. The affair is seen from his side as well as hers, and everything is clear and strong-as is the last key scene which follows the characters as they participate in or witness the 1967 Detroit riots. The novel is light years beyond the banality and the dreamfog of its beginnings. My view of Oates was turned around. The drained pallor of the woman in the lobby looked in retrospect like a sort of grandeur, the grandeur of literary and human knowledgeability. That she may be a sort of Simenon, a captive of graphomania (fueled by an unslakable or unslaked sexuality) I don't know and don't care. Although I've read nothing else of hers that's come close to the last third of them, I've read enough (of Marya, A Life, many fine stories and essays) to salute her artistry with joy and gratitude. Usually one sees readers in lobbies, even in lobbies as small and poorly furnished with chairs and sofas as the St. Moritz's. In the Congres- 27.

Indeed, I only remember one writer carrying a book. (It was the Flemish writer Paul Koecke. He carried a French translation of one of his novels.) I didn't even realize this peculiarity until I was checking out the last day. A new group was moving into the hotel: The Cracow Philharmonic Orchestra. While some members waited by elevators with cased horns and fiddles, others had sat down and opened books. How fine to see that. The Roman proverb about religion occurred to me: "Here we manufacture and dis- tribute the faith which they believe elsewhere." Three moments with which to festoon the last Congressional morning (too unimportant to be events, too undramatic to be scenes). The first took place outside, the second within, and the third as a sort of adjunct to the Congress. The first was close to a scene. It took place in Sutton's Caf6. A sullen black waitress was slamming down plates, spilling coffee, responding harshly to customers' requests. A man complained to the boss who shouted at the waitress. Two other customers drummed orders at her, the jungle assault on weakened prey. She put down my coffee cup wearily, defeated. On Central Park South, the Casino was full. A young woman handed out a list of books the Israelis had censored (the first was on Kuwaiti poetry). I found a seat in the front row beside the very tall and lovely Alexandra Schlesinger. Up on the dais were three retired statesmen, Pierre Trudeau, George McGovern, and Bruno Kreisky. In the center was the moderator, Arthur Schlesinger, to his right, Frances FitzGerald; at one end was Kurt Vonnegut, at the other a man not named in the program. Mrs. Schlesinger asked who it was; I didn't know. Her husband came off the dais and she asked him; he didn't know. Neither did Rose Styron, who said she'd find out. Whatever looking harmless means, he looked it: an elderly white-haired and mustached gentleman in a light brown sport coat and bow tie. Back on the platform, Schlesinger said the imagination of the state was a Hegelian notion which Anglo-Saxons reject. Americans varied in their views of the state. Thoreau called it "that semi-human tiger ... with the tip of its brain shot away"; Emerson was cozier: "The state is our neighbor." Schlesinger quoted the famous sentence of Solzhenitsyn about the writer being a state within a state, and another of John Kennedy. (Or had he quoted Robert Frost?) "Poetry is a means of saving power from itself." I asked Mrs. Schlesinger if her husband had written it for the president. She didn't know. Tanned and vigorous, Trudeau spoke briefly in French and English. (It was hard to imagine him en retraite. Do leopards retire?) He could not imagine why PEN imagined that the state, "a legal abstraction, not an anthropomorphic creature," had an imagination. "Why do writers imagine they have no power? Paranoia?" He quoted Czeslaw Milosz: "I don't believe in the necessary estrangement of the writer from the state"</page><page sequence="26">Critical Inquiry Summer 1988 885 and Kofi Awooner: "Writers should seek to create a new state. If we turn away from this task, we've failed." His last citation was from Plato's Laws: "The price of not being involved in government is that we're governed by those less worthy than ourselves." Frances FitzGerald spoke next. I'd seen her only once before, an occasion I remember clearly because an hour or so after we said good night, Robert Kennedy was shot to death in a California hotel. (She and Arthur Schlesinger had just been with him in California.) I'd found her attractive and modeled a minor character in a novel on her. Her remarks here were ragged and poorly delivered. They had to do with the aesthetics of the state and were bolstered by allusions to Bali-"where there's no word for 'art' because everything is art"-and to Ryszaro Kapucinski's remark that the fall of Haile Selassie was a form of art. Then Schlesinger introduced George McGovern as the first historian since Guizot to play a major role in government. (Churchill apparently wasn't a real historian.) McGovern cited dictionary definitions of imag- ination; he too didn't see that the state could have one. He cited Gordimer and Mailer.29 McGovern praised the author of The Naked and the Dead and said he wished he'd been elected mayor of New York. Unfortunately, voters hadn't been imaginative enough. They'd rejected Mailer as they later rejected McGovern. Looking at Trudeau and Kreisky, he said Ca- nadians and Austrians had been more imaginative. Studying Reagan, he longed for Nixon and Johnson. (I thought of Chekhov's "Old Age" in which two bitter enemies fall weeping into each other's arms at the grave of the woman who was one's man's wife, the other's mistress.) Schlesinger came down again to ask Rose Styron if the mystery man had been identified. Back on stage, he went over to confer with him. The man nodded, left the chair, and went into the audience. It was Vargas Llosa's turn. In tattered, charming English, he said that the writer in totalitarian states is reduced to being either a courtesan or a dissident. In other societies, his problem was how not to become an ambassador or minister of state. In countries which pay serious attention to writers, they're frequently arrested. In countries like the United States, writers feel they're simply entertainers. As for literature, it's made of contradictions and expresses what a community suppresses; this is its social function, and it's why, for a writer, obsessions are more important than ideas.3? 29. The self-reference of the Congress was like instant nostalgia, the sort of thing television does as it bundles bits of time away to create the feeling of great emotional experience. It's what great art succeeds in doing. 30. Writers who speak of "drives" or "obsessions" have probably lost their own.

Beside him, balding, bearded, big-nosed, and eyeglassed, Kreisky looked like one of Walt Disney's dwarves. He'd spent years in dictators' prisons, but since had been in government twenty-six years. He began with "different ideas about the state, Plato's Marx's," and went on to a history of "successful terrorists"-De Valera, Begin, Shamir, Kenyatta. Now and then, he addressed his fellow panelists: "Isn't that so? Don't we think this?" He wandered into American politics: he'd known all the presidents since Truman. The audience was stirring. Was the man senile? Or was this the insolence of powerful men who don't have to consider the feelings of their audience? Whatever, the talk undermined Kreisky's obvious intelligence and Viennese Gemiitlichkeit.

In a way, this gentle, inter- esting, and useful man embodied the vanity which scarred the whole conference.31 Kreisky called across to Trudeau. "We've been invited because they need victims." My thought was, "Is this why he's making victims of us? from Satie (on La mer): "He refused the invitation but his books accepted it." A second unresisted temptation (some words from Leopoldo Alas' beautiful story Dofia Berta): "la Ilosa ... a certain kind of corn-producing lowland." 31. In brief, we all were clerks and men of worth, great men of letters, scholars of renown; all by the one same crime defiled on earth. (Dante Alighieri, Inferno [trans. John Ciardi] 15.106-8.) In the Inferno the sin was ho- mosexuality; here it was the desperate need for gifted men to be seen and heard again.</page><page sequence="29">888 Richard Stern Some Members of the Congress Even Coleridge's insistent mariner stopped only one of three. Kreisky has hundreds of us under his endless tongue." Finally, he ended: "Excuse the length of my speech, but I've come a long way." Now it was Vonnegut's turn. His was one of the most familiar faces in the room, lined and gentle despite its Mongolian mustache and fierce bush of grey-black curls. Vonnegut said that he'd been an enlisted man, and like all enlisted men hated officers. The state was not a friend of enlisted men. Norman Mailer understood this too. So did Claude Simon who, like Vonnegut, had been a prisoner in Stalag 43. My section was a mini-state: 150 men. I was elected to divide up the loaves of bread and soup into a hundred equal portions. There were no scales. If I'd given bigger portions to my friend, that would have been "the imagination of the state" .. . I was allowed to report five sick men a day. If I decided that my friends were sick, that would have been "the imagination of the state." It was witty, strong, but, like Vonnegut's excessively charming and fanciful books, it had ended too soon after the fancy. Vonnegut wound things up officially, but the Congress' final platform speaker turned out to be the unprogrammed mystery man. As Vonnegut was applauded, he made his way from the audience and sat where he'd sat before, at Trudeau's right. Schlesinger, who'd obviously made this arrangement with the man, now introduced him: "The distinguished Italian novelist, Mario Soldati." Soldati began by explaining that he'd been prevented from reading remarks he'd prepared for another session because of his wife's illness. He'd spent most of the last four days by her side in a New York hospital. Luckily, she was well enough now so that he could attend this session. We would not be deprived of his remarks. I had actually seen Soldati before. Perhaps if he'd looked as he'd looked at the Congress on Translation held in Rome in 1982 I would have recognized him. There too he'd sat up front, but not in the elegant jacket and slacks he sported now, but in a red shirt, suspenders, and an orange tie pulled down below the unbuttoned top button of the shirt. He'd both spoken and interjected loudly and comically, and when others spoke, he was still conspicuous, head thrown back, snores filtering through his thick mustache. He'd left that Congress early, off, he told us, to Spain to cover the World Cup for La Repubblica.32 Caught up in the games myself, I read some of his articles. They were full of Soldati's classical and contemporary learning, his recollections of life in Spain, and, oc- casionally, sharp and amusing observations about the games themselves. 32. 1987: See Soldati's Ah!

Mario Soldati That this "distinguished novelist," journalist, commentator, confer- ence-attender, learned and graceful speaker of three or four languages, and man of letters in the European tradition was generally unrecognized in this congress of his peers may well have been the fact that drove him to this unbilled takeover of the dais. Recognition. Only the world's most flamboyant writers are recognized internationally, at least recognized in the American Express Card sense of that word. Our Congress had dealt with imagination in the larger meaning of the word, the one provided by Coleridge and the German writers from whom he borrowed. Soldati, though, came from the most spectacular, the most visualizing, the most image-dominated country in the world. Perhaps that sharpened his hunger for visual recognition. For astronomers, the stars are not primarily a visual phenomenon, but for the rest of us they are. To be a star would be a vulgarity for most of the people in this room, and yet vulgarity meant the appetite and response of the crowd, and that was important to many here. Literature had lost much of the appeal it had had in the nineteenth century to much of that</page><page sequence="31">890 Richard Stern Some Members of the Congress crowd. It had lost it to new forms of "visual literature," to movies and television. The better-known writers here made brief appearances on television programs, occasionally in the news, more frequently in the three- and four-minute snippets of interview shows where they were quickly compounded into the tasteless cake of politics, sports, and the day's sensations which people took in with their morning coffee. It was fitting, then, that Soldati concluded the official business of the Congress. Unrecognized, unbilled, out of sequence, "Off-Program," skirting the border of tolerance and outrage, he treated us to his recollection of his first visit to New York forty or fifty years ago. It was charming, it was irrelevant, it was relevant. Kreisky had wearied the audience past endurance; Soldati mystified us, threw us off balance, charmed us. He'd now been seen and heard as well as read. He was up in the spotlight with his equals, and when he finished the Congress was finished. There was still, though, a little mopping up to be done, and that was done by the media. Between the dais and the first row where I sat was a cushion of photographers and people with microphones and tape recorders. They were slouching on the floor, from which they occasionally got up to take a picture. One, a tall, blond fellow in blue jeans and jacket, looked familiar to me. Once we even exchanged a nod. After Schlesinger gaveled the end of the Congress, he came up to me. "I'm Eiche," he said. "Do you remember me?" "Of course," I said, shaking hands with him. "But you've lost weight or something. How are you doing?" Though I remember now from letters he'd written my wife that he wasn't doing all that well. He'd gone back to Germany where he'd grown up to be with his dying grandmother who'd raised him. She'd died and he'd come back to New York to find out he'd lost his job at Cooper Union where he'd taught journalism. In addition, the people to whom he'd rented his apartment wouldn't leave, and he was scared of making a fuss about it because the immigration people were giving him trouble with his green card. He was afraid he'd be deported and wouldn't be able to get back. He'd always suffered from migraine headaches, but they'd never been so frequent or prolonged. One didn't have to look far to trace the source of those headaches. Eiche had been born in Berlin in 1945. His father was an officer in Rommel's African army. He'd been captured, interned in Tripoli, and then escaped in a British officer's coat. He'd made his way back to his regiment and joined Rommel's army in Western France. There, days before the end of the war, he'd been killed. In the ruins of Berlin, Eiche's mother got the terrible word. She took the service revolver her husband had given her to protect herself and shot Eiche's older, three-year-old brother to death, shot him in the head, and then killed herself. Hours</page><page sequence="32">Critical Inquiry Summer 1988 891 later, her mother made her way up the stairs and found this horrible scene. Baby Eiche was still breathing. She got him to the hospital and brought him home and raised him. "What are you doing here?" I asked him. "I'm sending back reports to German radio. It's enough to get by on. I have to rush off and make this last press conference. Can we meet later?" "Sure," I said, and we shook hands without specifying a time or place. Eiche was a person of considerable intellect, widely read in several languages, and a fluent-sometimes too fluent-critic in three or four of them. He was part of that indispensable bridge between the high, often remote, sometimes chilling, sometimes absurd intelligence of the best writers and the many thousands, in fact millions, who didn't even guess how much they required them to reinvigorate, re-enchant, and reinterpret their lives, their world. From the ashes of the Great War on that intelligence, Eiche had been almost miraculously rescued. He func- tioned now in the sensational world, but in a pocket where something other than life's small change jingled. I think we will run into each other. He might well be at a Congress in Valencia to commemorate the one held there fifty years ago as Spain and Europe itself collapsed in the first act of the war which ended a few days after Eiche was picked up by his grandmother from the bloody crib of the Berlin apartment house.</page></plain_text>
