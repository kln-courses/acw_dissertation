<plain_text><page sequence="1">KENNETH L. BROWN DOREEN C. COOPER Structural Continuity in an African-American Slave and Tenant Community Introduction Cary Carson (1978:42) once stated, "No matter what standard objective scholars use they can hardly avoid the conclusion that the study of arti facts has contributed to developing the main themes of American history almost not at all" (emphasis in original). This quote illustrates a problem in con ducting an archaeological investigation within his toric contexts in the United States. While this sen timent is not surprising from an historian, it also appears to be a widely held opinion among histor ical archaeologists (I. Walker 1968; Noel Hume 1969b, 1978b; Adams 1979). During the past three decades, American archaeologists have developed a number of techniques designed to improve their ability to study human behavior in more than an historical fashion. Studies of the structure of past cultures as well as the processes behind culture change have taken over the literature of prehistoric archaeology. Conversely, such studies are not cen tral to the goals expressed by some historical ar chaeologists (Noel Hume 1969b), because histor ical archaeologists have access to documents which outline the broad processes and structures of their study populations. Archaeology, it is argued, pro vides interesting details not otherwise available to historians; history provides whatever else might be needed (Noel Hume 1969b). This concept is most clearly observed in the use of the functional classification systems employed by historical archaeologists. Artifacts recovered from an historically defined context somehow have a meaning very different from that which would be assigned to them if they had come from a prehis toric context. One of the main classification sys terns employed by historical archaeologists is that proposed by Roderick Sprague. His system is in tended to be one based upon assumed function: "Any classification, especially a functional one, imposes the culture of the researcher upon that body of data. However, in most 19th- and 20th century sites, I have found this to be far less of a problem than utilizing a material based classifica tion" (R. Sprague 1981:252). This methodology rests upon the assumption that historical archaeologists have access to a wide va riety of documents which give both function and meaning to the artifacts recovered. In the final anal ysis, however, it is the historical archaeologist's knowledge of modern material culture?its uses and meanings?which is employed to determine an artifact's function and, therefore, to produce be havioral interpretations. Within Sprague's (1981: 256-257) classificatory scheme, for instance, horseshoes are listed in three places: "domestic ritual," "household pastimes," and "agriculture and husbandry.'' This list of potential functions for horseshoes might logically be enlarged well beyond Sprague's simply on the basis of an individual in terpreter's knowledge of how others employ horse shoes. Thus, for example, a horseshoe can function in the "culinary" category (as a trivet), in "home education, information, and business" (as a paper weight), or in "domestic safety" (as a weapon). The point here is that the functions of the artifacts recovered should, whenever possible, be based upon the associational context of the artifacts?a generally held belief in prehistoric archaeology. However, for Sprague and others, any individual artifact's function is based upon the totality of as sumed 4 'functions" for the associated artifacts. It is the assumed function for each of the artifacts that is based upon the prior knowledge of the archae ologist?the archaeologist's "cultural baggage." The assignment of artifact function based on a priori knowledge is a questionable practice even in the archaeology of European-Americans since it pre cludes discovery of cultural changes or adaptations. This practice is clearly inappropriate in the study of non-European-Americans?even those who oper ate within a European-American-defined cultural setting?because their use of European-American</page><page sequence="2">8 HISTORICAL ARCHAEOLOGY, VOLUME 24 technology will not necessarily be subject to the same cultural baggage as that carried either by members of the dominant culture or by the archae ologist. Prehistorians, by definition, lack historical documents and, therefore, must rely solely on the associational contexts of artifacts within the archae ological record in order to assign function and use. Historical archaeologists may not have to rely solely on the context within the archaeological record. If they choose to investigate African-Amer ican cultural contexts, however, they must employ a more "value-free" approach. The issues involved in this debate are not trivial. In the case of "Plantation Archaeology," this issue directly affects one's future success in contributing to an increased understanding of the rural South, its agricultural system, and what might be called the "African-American past." While it may be easy and convenient to assign function and use to arti facts based on a supposed knowledge of historical documents, a major disservice to the past will occur if the analysis is stopped there. If the goal is to increase understanding of plantation communities, then archaeologists must look at the function, use, and meaning of artifacts within a context that is not totally dependent upon the dominant European American behavioral system. Africans became Af rican-Americans; during the acculturation process, they adapted European-American material culture into some of their African behavioral systems. The goal of this paper is to illustrate the accul turation of an antebellum and postbellum slave and tenant community?the Levi Jordan Plantation? from the Gulf Coastal Plains of Texas. Through the use of a methodology which employs ethnographic analogies derived from African and African-Amer ican contexts, this essay demonstrates how the study of artifacts can contribute to the main themes of American history by focusing on one plantation site in east Texas. Potential Historical Archaeological Data Within this overall conception of historical ar chaeology, the methodological approach advocated here is viewed as an important mechanism designed to incorporate more' 'insider'' data into the study of the African-American past. That is, archaeologists have the potential to develop descriptions of and interpretations from the artifacts left behind by the individuals who used them in a past behavioral system. These "documents," studied by historical archaeologists and rarely employed by historians, were deposited as a result of the patterned behavior of the human beings who actually existed within the cultural systems under study. Obviously, not all deposited artifacts yield the same level of behav ioral information due to the context of the artifacts and the formation processes which occurred in the production of that archaeological context (Schiffer 1976, 1987). The potential for more accurate "in sider' ' information from these artifacts, however, is actually greater than that derived from the "out sider" historical documents. In this sense, "out sider' ' means that many of the documentary sources were produced by individuals who were not mem bers of the slave or tenant communities about which they wrote. In the study of the agricultural systems of the rural South prior to 1920, for example, the available written documents generally include plan tation records, agricultural journals, census and tax records, diaries, and travelers' journals. These sources were composed by individuals who clearly were outsiders to the slave or tenant communities they observed. They may be sources which are ' 'ernic" to the study of the elite patriarchy, e.g., the European-American component, of the plantation society, but they are ' 'etic'' with regard to the slave and later tenant portions of the society. Thus, from the viewpoint of the actual material remains, his torical archaeologists working on plantation sites have an ideal opportunity to investigate a slave or tenant community employing a very different data set than that used in traditional history. This data set has the potential to be derived from the past activ ities of the people who lived within the behavioral system under investigation. Unfortunately, archaeological studies of slave and tenant farmer systems conducted to date have generally not produced many new insights into the evolution of African-American culture. Much of this research has concentrated on tests for the de termination of ethnicity of slaves and tenants (Han</page><page sequence="3">STRUCTURAL CONTINUITY IN AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN SLAVE AND TENANT COMMUNITY 9 dler and Lange 1978; Schuyler 1980; Otto 1984; Singleton 1985a, 1985b). Historians, on the other hand, clearly acknowledge that slaves and slave descendants were blacks abducted from Africa. In order for historical archaeologists to begin to pro duce new insights into the functioning of the be havioral systems of plantation communities, they must begin to test for specific African and African American behavioral patterns within the material remains encountered during excavations of slave and tenant sites. For this type of study, the tradi tionally employed historical documents will actu ally be of little help. Like prehistorians, historical archaeologists will have to begin their analyses with a lack of knowledge as to artifact function and use by the people who used and deposited the remains. In order to answer questions about "African holdovers," acculturation, and plantation commu nity organization, historical archaeologists must alter their approach both to history and to the ap plication of models about historical artifact use. Artifacts indicative of ethnicity or ethnic retentions probably represent African or African-American behaviors which, for the most part, utilized the available European-American material culture. Ar tifacts traditionally used to define ethnicity? carved bone, hand-made musical instruments, toys, effigies, and carved and drilled shell?would have been highly curated items. Within the plan tation community, such items probably would not have entered the archaeological record in large numbers. Importantly, however, other items may have been produced by European-Americans but which had their patterned use altered to permit and define meaning for the African-American popula tion employing them. An example of this type of artifact might be a shell button which has an Af rican or African-American symbol carved onto one of its surfaces. Colored glass beads and drilled coins can be other items whose traditional or pri mary functions within the dominant culture were altered (Adams 1987). Levi Jordan Plantation Quarters The Levi Jordan Plantation was founded in 1848 on 2,222 acres of rich river bottomland on the Gulf Coastal Plains of Brazoria County, Texas, approximately 60 miles south of Houston and 15 miles inland from the Gulf of Mexico. During the antebellum period, the major cash crops produced on the plantation were sugar and cotton. Jordan's sugar mill generated additional cash by processing sugar cane for a number of the surrounding plan tations (Strobel 1926; Platter 1961). Creighton (1975) and W. Johnson (1961) also provide de tailed descriptions of the sugar industry in Brazoria County. For a period of time after the Civil War, Jordan attempted to continue producing sugar, al though the main focus of his agricultural activities appears to have shifted to cotton and cattle ranch ing (Platter 1961). After his death in 1873, the northern half of the plantation was run by his grandsons until 1876 (West Publishing Company 1892), when it was then leased until 1885. Throughout this time of transition, the activities initiated by Jordan continued, although an empha sis on cattle ranching began to assume an increas ingly larger proportion of the cash basis of the plantation (U.S. Bureau of Census 1870, 1880a; Platter 1961:162). Around 1890 or 1891, after ac rimonious litigation between two grandsons and four great-grandsons, the northern half of the plan tation, including the house and the former slave quarters, was divided among the four great-grand sons. Interestingly, the main house?a major portion of which is still standing, the original plantation hospital and house slave residence, and a few small outbuildings were built of wood. The bulk of the buildings constructed on the plantation, espe cially those having to do with the slaves and the plantation's production, were made of brick. Of the major brick buildings, only the sugar house currently has above-ground walls. The slave and tenant quarters were located ap proximately 400 feet northwest of the main house (Figure 1-1). The quarters were occupied from their construction beginning late in 1848 through their forced abandonment around 1891. Thus, the ar chaeological deposits were produced over a 42-year time span that encompasses both slavery and early tenancy. The quarters consisted of eight long, bar racks-like structures built in groups of two.</page><page sequence="4">10 HISTORICAL ARCHAEOLOGY, VOLUME 24 ^^OPEN CISTERNS a? on [ht, BLOCKT BLOCK H l,Jt.J ' ,/ ' BLOCK m BLOCK 12 SLAVE/TENANT QUARTERS AREA / / / 0 100 FT. / I-'-1 MODERN STRUCTURES IN THE AREA OF THE MAIN HOUSE, / I WELL DEFINED SLAVE/TENANT / / QUARTERS BLOCK. *77 ! !

Location of Jordan Plantation quarters. Each of these sets of structures shared a com mon central hallway probably with a single roof. Entrances into the individual cabins were located in this central hallway. Archaeological evidence demonstrates that from three to four individual cabins were built within each of the long buildings (Figure 1-2). The 1860 population census lists the plantation as having 29 slave cabins for the 141 slaves (U.S. Bureau of Census 1860). This con figuration would fit within the defined area noted above. Archaeological evidence also supports the hypothesis that several of the so-called cabins may have been larger and served as dormitories. At its height, approximately 150 slaves lived on the plan tation (Brazoria County 1862). Unfortunately, records do not exist to indicate the number of wage labor tenants who lived on the plantation. Excava tion within the individual cabins demonstrates a reduction in the number of cabins occupied. The archaeological evidence suggests that this change occurred after the Civil War, and thus that the number of tenants might have been lower than the number of slaves. OOPEN CISTERN 0 20 FT. n-A-4 \\ FIGURE 1-2. Cabin locations at Jordan Plantation. From an archaeological point of view, possibly the single most important event in the history of the quarters is that their occupants were forced to leave. A large percentage of the artifacts thus far recovered represents the preserved remains of pos sessions abandoned by the occupants as they were forced to leave. The historical documents do not indicate exactly when this abandonment occurred. Several lines of evidence?including family oral history and two civil court cases, however, suggest that it happened sometime late in 1890 or early in 1891. This forced removal has resulted in the pres ervation of an important set of artifacts represent ing items that were hastily abandoned by their owners. Further, the materials have been recov ered in positions relatively close to the place of their use. Four other factors are of great importance in the assessment of the nature of the archaeological data set from these quarters. First, the exterior walls of the quarters were made of brick set into a shallow foundation trench. This trench had been excavated about 1 ft. into the subsoil around the entire pe rimeter of each structure. This construction method</page><page sequence="5">STRUCTURAL CONTINUITY IN AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN SLAVE AND TENANT COMMUNITY 11 had the effect of sealing the archaeological deposits from outside intrusions; for example, artifacts could not be deposited under the floors from outside the cabins. Second, the "crawl space" between the floor and the soil within the area defined by the wall trench was too narrow to permit the retrieval of a large quantity of materials which might have fallen through the floor boards. Construction evidence supports the idea that the floor was constructed within approximately 4-6 in. of the ground surface inside the structures. Third, archaeological evi dence has shown that each of the quarters was padlocked after the inhabitants were removed and not reopened until long after the cabins had begun to deteriorate. Closed padlocks and door hinges have been recovered in the same general location within the three individual cabins under study. The closed padlocks suggest that the doors had either fallen or were knocked into the cabins at some point. Fourth, the area of the plantation occupied by the quarters has never been plowed. Oral history and archaeological data both sug gest that for a time the cabins were allowed to deteriorate naturally. The wooden floors of the cabins decomposed and collapsed onto the ground below, while soil, brick fragments, and organic refuse built up over the deposits dating from their forced abandonment (1890-1891) until 1913. Based upon the family's oral history, in 1913 the owner of the quarters area contracted with a devel oper to remove the bricks from the walls of the quarters. Bricks were salvaged to the base of the foundation trench in some areas, but usually the removal process stopped at or just below the orig inal floor level. This action added to the pile of debris that accumulated on the old floor area?as much as a foot of brick rubble was present in some areas tested?and further protected the floor area and the artifacts. In August 1913, and again just over a year later (Creighton 1975), the area of the quarters was flooded, depositing from 3 to 6 in. of silt over the area. This silt effectively sealed the remaining deposit. As a result of these site forma tion processes, the actual floor areas of individual cabins within the structures could be defined. The excavations into the slave and tenant farmer community at the Jordan Plantation have been de veloped both to excavate intensively a number of the individual cabins and to test systematically the area around the quarters. In both sampling strate gies, the standard excavation unit was 5 x 5 ft. in size. All units excavated at the quarters, however, began at this size, but usually were enlarged. That is, once a unit in the quarters had been excavated to the top of the brick layer that immediately over laid the cabin deposits, each unit was segmented into 25 1-x-l-ft. sub-units. Further, once this level was reached?generally at a depth of 0.3 to 0.5 ft. below surface, a system of both arbitrary and "natural" levels was employed in the excava tion of the cabin deposits. The basic arbitrary level depth was 0.1 ft., unless a soil change was noted. Within each of these 0.1 ft. levels, however, arti facts were generally pedestaled until all of the sub units of the level were excavated. This procedure has permitted the relatively rapid excavation of the deposits, while still providing extensive point plot ting of the artifacts. This methodology has proven to be extremely important, especially within the "abandonment zone." Through this methodology, areas of differential use of cabin floor space can be identified, and the original internal cabin walls can be defined. The external walls were made of brick, but those on the inside were made of a more per ishable material, probably wood. Thus, the walls were defined on the basis of "shadows" in the artifact distribution. To date, excavations have been conducted in nine of the individual slave cabins within the com munity. Based upon the present interpretation of the data, this would translate into six tenant cabins; two other structures became two-room cabins, while another may not have been employed as a residence after the Civil War. In terms of eco nomic, social, and political organization, the ex cavations have provided clear evidence that both economic and political hierarchies existed within the community during both the slave and tenant occupations. In fact, the data suggest that a great deal of continuity existed within this community over these time periods. From a behavioral perspective, the social, polit ical, economic, and in a slightly more tentative manner, some of the ideological structure of the</page><page sequence="6">12 HISTORICAL ARCHAEOLOGY, VOLUME 24 Jordan Plantation slave and tenant community can also be defined. As would be predicted, the depos its around the cabins demonstrate a very general and rather uniform distribution of the various ma jor artifact types. Much of this material relates to the domestic activities of the cabins. The differ ences noted in the distribution of these materials likely relate to differential activity use in the area of the quarters, e.g., internal plantation roads, out door work areas, outdoor social areas, and so on. The internal cabin deposits demonstrate something very different. The internal deposits provide evi dence of occupational specialization, political and economic status, and ethnicity. The best evidence for African behavioral holdovers and behavioral change also derives from the internal cabin depos its. Given the large number of Africans by birth found in Brazoria County, e.g., 133 according to the 1870 population census, some of this culture change is conceivably the result of acculturation and behavioral adaptation?the development of 44African-American culture"?as well as the changes brought about by the emancipation of the slaves. The Interpretation of Social Hierarchies and Social Change The definition of status hierarchies within his torical archaeological research has presented many formidable problems. These problems include the computing of costs for items found in the archae ological record; the determination of gifts versus purchases, especially when dealing with slaves; the often expressed belief that the plantation's owner or agent, e.g., the overseer, conferred status (Frazier 1930), thus making status and material possessions dependent variables (Adams 1987); and that status on a plantation is somehow relative to the plantation's status within the region (Rawick 1972; Kelso 1984; S. Moore 1985; Adams 1987). These factors do indeed represent problems in the interpretation of the archaeological remains. With in the context of the materials from the Jordan Plantation, however, these problems in the dem onstration of status hierarchies can be addressed. The slave and tenant community hierarchy and the plantation owner's established hierarchy may or may not have been the same. Certainly, the positions defined by the archaeological evidence do not all coincide with those normally attributed to a plantation's hierarchy. For example, as will be demonstrated below, evidence exists for a tradi tional African religious practitioner, a specialized metal worker, and a craftsman producing carved bone and shell objects. Jordan would not likely have established or assigned these positions to members of the community. While each person may also have had some formal position within Jordan's assigned plantation hierarchy, the archae ological evidence suggests that the community hi erarchy was at least somewhat independent of Jor dan's. However, the important hierarchy here is the one that would have been internal to the slave and tenant community itself, the social order that was internally defined and sanctioned, and effec tively controlled the lives of the members of the community. One of the primary functions of this internal hierarchy would be to "cushion" the im pact of slavery and tenancy on the members of the community, functioning to control and direct be havior within the community, as well as to provide aid and support to its members. Thus, this hierar chy would provide its members with a sense of continuity and support despite the oppressive na ture of the system of which it was a part. This internal hierarchy is the one which has continuity through time and for which archaeological evi dence remains. Even after slavery gave way to wage labor tenancy on the Jordan Plantation, the community and its hierarchy remained essentially intact and functioning. The major changes that have so far appeared in the archaeological record of the quarters occur in the areas of settlement patterning, diet, occupa tion, and the internal economic system. To date, no major changes have been discovered in the re tention of African behavioral patterns. Patterns within the abandonment data are essentially iden tical to those representing the accumulation of de bris during the occupation of the cabins. This ab sence of change should not be taken, however, to imply that the system was static. Rather, the ar</page><page sequence="7">STRUCTURAL CONTINUITY IN AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN SLAVE AND TENANT COMMUNITY 13 TABLE 1-1 TOTAL ARTIFACT COUNTS PER CABIN Artifact Type_II-A-2_II-A-3_II-B-1_II-B-2_II-B-3 Bone fragment 3,789 2,598 5,874 5,993 6,390 Ceramic fragment 187 91 289 242 414 Porcelain 5 0 54 16 11 Glass fragment 481 190 908 877 733 Cutlery 5 4 32 33 20 Pipes 7 6 14 40 24 Munitions 7 23 44 43 59 Melted lead 6 7 17 74 4 Beads 8 8 26 13 25 Store-bought jewelry 7 6 31 26 23 Sewing equipment 1 0 18 10 10 Buttons 42 46 404 248 340 Coins 115 5 7 Shell artifact 5 17 37 13 42 Carved bone 0 0 0 1 2 Pocket knife 1 0 4 8 6 Total 4,552 2,997 7,757 7,642 8,110 Number of Square footage Cabin Number Excavation Units Excavated Weight Amount II-A-2 3 75 2.08 II-A-3 3 75 2.08 II-B-1 6.2 156 1.00 II-B-2 4.8 119 1.24 II-B-3 6 150 1.04 chaeological evidence analyzed to date suggests that the positions continued, even though the be liefs and meanings may have changed somewhat. The definition of this hierarchy is based on dif ferential distributions of artifact classes among the various cabins thus far analyzed. As can be seen from the tables, significant differences appear in the artifact class frequencies recorded for five of the slave cabins. Table 1-1 depicts the artifact class counts from the excavation units into these cabins. Table 1-2 presents the weighted average counts and percentages of these same artifact classes. To obtain these weighted averages, exca vation units?or portions of excavation units? contained within each cabin were determined. A square footage for each cabin, based on excavated and analyzed units, was then calculated. The cabin with the largest square footage excavated, II-B-1, was assigned a weight of "1." All other cabins were then weighted according to the percentage of their excavated square footage to that of Cabin II-B-1 (shown in Table 1-1), and the weighted artifact totals and percentages in Table 1-2 were computed.

Artifact distributions within structure II-B appear to identify four cabins uti lized during the slave occupation: three functioned as residences, while the fourth may have had a specialized function. At some point in time after the Civil War, this set of cabins was converted to only two residential units and two special purpose units each connected to one of the residences. The second apparent shift in the settlement of the quarters was the abandonment of the dormito ries as residences. During the occupation of the quarters by slaves, at least one of the cabins tested archaeologically, Cabin III-A-1, appears to have functioned as a dormitory. It also lacks an obvious abandonment deposit. The presence of dormitories is suggested by the 1860 population census data, in which Jordan listed a total of 132 slaves. Of these slaves, 59 were over the age of 20 (34 males, 25 females), while 73 were below the age of 20 (37 males, 36 females) (Figure 1-3); these data sug gest that nine adult males may have lacked spouses in residence on the plantation. These single males may have occupied the larger cabins. Further, given the interesting decrease in the number of slaves aged 20 to 34 between 1850 and 1860 (34 down to 19; a decrease of 9 males and 6 females), and the corresponding increase of children below the age of 20 (47 up to 73; an increase of 20 males and 6 females) as illustrated in Figure 1-3 (U.S. Bureau of Census 1850, 1860), dormitories for older children might also have been necessary. Dietary Change Little can be conclusively stated concerning the changes in diet for the residents of the quarters. Although detailed study has yet to be undertaken on the nearly 40,000 faunal elements excavated, a shift does seem to occur in animal types as one moves upward in the stratigraphy below the cabin floors. Specifically, the amount of wild animal bone decreases upward through the deposit. That is, bones and other parts of deer, reptiles, fish, various rodents, and other wild animals decrease in number over time, while those of animals such as chickens, pigs, and cattle increase. This trend may simply be a function of the size of the bones?the smaller animal bones falling through the flooring and being deposited, while the larger ones would</page><page sequence="9">STRUCTURAL CONTINUITY IN AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN SLAVE AND TENANT COMMUNITY 15 AGE 40-49 FEMALE 2 f~ -13_ MALE 30-39 6 J j 20-29 1 3 j Sl4 10-19 6] -J2 0-9 25 1 - -116 I-'-1-I-1 |-1-1-1-1 30 20 10 0 0 10 20 30 PERCENT 1850 AGE OVER 50 FEMALE 3 |- |5 MALE 40-49 7| 110 30-39 6] [7 20-29 ?3i? -rr 10-19 161- -'-115 ?'9 ill- -J I-1- i-1 I-1-'-1-1 30 20 10' 0 0 10 20 30 PERCENT 1860 FIGURE 1-3.

Chicken eggshell, however, appears throughout the sequence, while fish scales, fish bones, and turtle shell fragments appear to decrease over time. While analysis of this material is necessary, at this time it appears that the wage labor tenants may have had a diet consisting of a higher quantity of domesticated animals than their slave counterparts. Occupational Change The archaeological evidence for occupation and occupational differences among the residents of the quarters must be examined in two ways: the occupations necessary for the plantation's eco nomic system and the occupations which func tioned within the internal economic system of the slave and tenant community. While these are not mutually exclusive economies, the different items produced play very different roles within the com bined economic system of the plantation. The primary economic activities within the slave and tenant community were those related to the pro duction of two cash crops, sugar and cotton, as well as to making the plantation as self sufficient as possible. Archaeological data currently support the following part-time, if not full-time, occupa tions practiced by both the slave and tenant occu pants: seamstress (at least three slave and two ten ant), carpenter (possibly two for each time period), hunter (at least three slave and three tenant), and a blacksmith or someone who repaired metal ob jects. While this list fails to include specialized agricultural workers, e.g., the actual field hands and sugar mill workers, these exclusions are more likely a factor of tool storage?away from the cab ins?and of the archaeological record than the structure of the plantation, and should not be taken to mean there were none. Fragments of agricultural tools, especially hoes, were recovered from sev eral of the cabins. The tools associated with occu pations such as seamstress, blacksmith, carpenter, or hunter, however, are more distinctive of these specialized activities, and possibly more often stored in a residence, than are the tools connected with agricultural activities. Further, agricultural activities may have been carried out for the plan tation as well as for the individual slave or tenant households. Thus, the presence of agricultural tools in the archaeological record of a cabin does not necessarily indicate the plantation occupation of the cabin's resident. Specialized tools are also more likely than agricultural tools to be used and stored within the cabins, especially after the Civil War, as craftsmen became more nearly "self-em ployed." Therefore, it should be expected that such tools would enter the archaeological record of the cabins more often than agricultural ones. This hypothesis is supported by the abandonment de posit, where a large percentage of the craft tools and related items has been located. Internal Economic System Of equal importance for the successful function ing of the slave and tenant community, however, was the internal economic system. Evidence from the excavations to date suggests that a number of important occupations fall into this category, in cluding: hunters (three for both the slave and tenant occupations), a political leader, a healer/magician, a "metalsmith or shot maker," and an "African craftsman." Given the importance of meat protein in the diet of the various members of the plantation community, the hunters probably functioned in</page><page sequence="10">16 HISTORICAL ARCHAEOLOGY, VOLUME 24 both the plantation and the internal slave/tenant community economic systems. Their importance in the internal system would center on their ability to provide the community with additional foodstuffs without the overseer or owner necessarily interfer ing. Such an activity might provide a mechanism for within-community status enhancement. In these cases, hunting may have served as an additional mechanism for social control and status mainte nance. Further, the occupants of Cabin II-B-2 ap pear to have provided the lead shot which may have been used by the hunters. As can be seen in Table 1-2, this cabin accounts for fully 66% of the sheet lead and melted lead * 'refuse'' by artifact count. By weight, however, Cabin II-B-2 accounts for an even larger percentage of these artifact classes. Further, the majority of "Munitions" recovered from this cabin (59%) consists of unfinished or unfired lead shot. Finally, a shot-making tool was also recov ered. In light of the clear connection between met alsmithing and religion in both African and African American cultures, the location of this cabin is interesting. While additional analysis is necessary, the apparent incorporation of Cabin II-B-2 into II B-1 might suggest that the healer/magician and the metalsmith may have been or become the same individual. The so-called African craftsman's cabin (II-A-3) produced a variety of items which form the "eth nic identifiers" discovered within the slave and tenant cabins. The tools for manufacture of the drilled shell artifacts and a number of blank shells of a variety of fresh and salt water types came from this cabin. Given the large number of fresh water mussel shells located within this cabin (an item not found in other cabins), this individual may have worked shell for other artifacts, such as buttons. In fact, a number of shell and bone buttons from the quarters appear to be ' 'homemade.'' In addition, at least one apparent "store-bought" button, recov ered within the deposits of the quarters, was found to have had a six-sided star carved into one of its surfaces. Such a symbol is found on African and African-American ritual objects (Thompson 1983). Evidence for this craft production is found from the base of the below-floor deposit through the abandonment level. African Retentions and Symbolism One of the interesting aspects of the data so far generated concerns the manipulation of African derived objects and symbols. While all of the cab ins thus far tested have yielded a number of drilled shell artifacts, two cabins had occupants who ma nipulated a wider variety of African and European American symbols. Both of these cabins' occu pants were extremely important in the functioning of the community of slaves and tenants. Cabin II B-3/4 was occupied by an individual who probably functioned in a social control capacity. This hy pothesis is supported by the discovery of a shackle chain bricked into the west wall of Cabin II-B-3, a high number of weapon-related artifacts, as well as a very high number of African and European American status items, e.g., carved bone, drilled shells, store-bought jewelry, and coins of high de nomination. Most of these items were recovered from the abandonment level of II-B-3/4, while the occupational deposits of II-B-3 contained a very low frequency of artifacts, possibly indicating that II-B-3 was utilized as a "jail" for some portion of its use, later becoming part of a larger, two-room cabin. The community-wide function of another cab in's occupants provides an important test of "Af rican" retentions through the differential manipu lation of European-American material culture. This cabin was occupied by a traditional healer/ magician. Similar to the political leader's cabin (II-B-3/4), the evidence here supports the hypoth esis that the healer/magician occupied a single cabin during slavery and expanded it into two rooms sometime after 1865. The added space served as an "office" or ritual room. A vast ma jority of the artifacts that formed part of the heal er's ritual paraphernalia date to the rapid abandon ment of the cabin. For whatever reasons, the artifacts remained behind and in a condition fairly similar to the way they were left. The main data come from a restricted area of a single cabin. Of primary importance here are five cast-iron kettle bases, several pieces of utilized chalk, fragments of a small scale, bird skulls, an animal's paw, medicine bottles, bullet casings put</page><page sequence="11">STRUCTURAL CONTINUITY IN AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN SLAVE AND TENANT COMMUNITY 17 together to form a sealed tube, ocean shells, small doll parts, a high frequency of nails and spikes, several tablespoons, metal knives?both real and "fake," a chert projectile point, and two chert scrapers. The so-called "fake" knives are long pieces of metal made in the general shape of a knife; they are, however, much thicker than a nor mal knife and have a wedge-shaped cross-section. In most cases, these fake knives have an uneven "cutting edge." These objects probably all relate to the ritual "tool kit" of a traditional West Afri can and African-American healer/magician. Clear ly, a very large percentage of these artifacts would have functioned in other activities?and likely did at various points in their use-lives. In fact, in a number of currently employed artifact cataloguing schemes, these artifacts would be subsumed in household and architectural categories and their significance in ritual activities missed. When these artifacts are taken together in an explicit test of the healer/magician model, however, this pattern of co-occurrence becomes significant in the study of African retentions in an African-American rural farming community. Research conducted by other scholars (Bascom 1952; Janzen and MacGaffey 1974; MacGaffey 1977; Thompson 1983; Janzen 1986) can be em ployed to construct a behavioral analogy which can be tested against the data from the healer/magi cian's cabin. For example, William Bascom (1952) has demonstrated that in Cuba many of the divination rituals and equipment found within the modern black and Creole populations originated in West Africa. Equipment regularly employed in these ritual activities included, among other items, wooden or metal trays, white chalk or powder, metal staffs, and bird symbolism. The trays and chalk or white powder were often used together. The powder/chalk was spread across the surface of the tray with the divination proceeding with the marking of symbols into the powder on the surface of the tray. The chalk could also be used to make the symbols not only on the tray but on other sur faces as well. Bascom further notes the close as sociation of divination and healing knowledge and ritual with birds and bird symbolism in both Africa and the New World. Sealed, hollow metal staffs or smaller cylindrical metal objects are important symbols of the healer/magician's power. Finally, Richard Thompson (1983:56) notes the following description of the beginning of a charm ritual: "On the island of Cuba, when Kongo ritual leaders wish to make important Zarabanda charm . . . they be gin by tracing, in white chalk, a cruciform pattern on the bottom of an iron kettle." These behavioral descriptions clearly help to tie a number of the artifacts discovered in the archae ological record of the tenant quarters of the Jordan Plantation into a "functional set." This functional set concerns both curing and magic ritual and ritual objects. However, the ritual objects are not the elaborate and symbolically decorated items gener ally noted within the ethnographic descriptions. In the case of the Jordan Plantation artifacts, they are simply adaptations of existing European-American material culture. Given the differences in the cul tural settings described, e.g., a free community composed of and controlled by its black or Creole inhabitants versus a community of free blacks within a larger community controlled by whites in a generally antagonistic setting, one might predict some simplification of the material culture in volved. Slave and tenant communities might not be expected to produce the highly decorated arti facts given their status and the need to "go under ground" in order to carry out these traditional practices. Thus, the symbolic meanings of the items would be clear within the context of the black community, and generally learned orally, rather than being expressed openly on the objects. If members of the dominant society happened to discover the objects, the general form and even the association might not be understood by the "for eign" discoverer. Thus, the lack of symbolic ex pression on the artifacts and their general "domes tic" nature would aid in keeping the likelihood of discovery low, further helping to keep the behavior operating within the adapting community of Afri can-Americans. Other artifacts associated with the ritual objects and a nearby plastered area of the cabin's floor may well be all that remains within the archaeo logical record of another item within this general ritual tool kit?the anthropomorphic wooden fig</page><page sequence="12">18 HISTORICAL ARCHAEOLOGY, VOLUME 24 ures called Nkisi. As John Janzen and Reinhild Janzen (1988:38) note, such figures are "power objects" in a community and/or public context. They also serve in the treatment of sickness, the protection of individuals and communities, and for the initiation of novices into the ritual order com mon to the Nkisi. These authors also state that usually when these figures are employed in ritual activities, then: At this time they are combined with other objects or ritually treated to achieve a particular end. Nails or wedges driven into the wooden figure represent the oaths that bind the word of the spell. "Injuring" the nkisi, thus provoking it, compels it to act in the desired manner (Janzen and Janzen 1988:38). While the actual carved object is missing ar chaeologically, a variety of artifacts in very close association with ritual objects, items employed in the production of charms and curing, do appear. Within an 8-sq.-ft. area around the plastered sur face were recovered 11 spikes, approximately 254 nails, at least 2 broken knife blades, a number of wedge-shaped metal pieces, and a large number of other metal objects. The amount of metal from this small portion of the unit is from 12 to 15 times the average amount of metal from a similar-sized area of the quarters. Again, these artifacts all might have had different functions and uses at some point in their history, but within the testing of a nonhis torically documented and non-European-American behavioral model, they help to support the hypoth esis that they were ultimately used in an African or African-American ritual context. By simply plac ing these artifacts into European-American behav ioral sets?e.g., culinary, gustatory, architectural sets?as is common in historical archaeology, their importance in the definition and reconstruc tion of African and African-American behavior would have been totally lost. A vast majority of these items are typical of those found within the average slave or tenant household?even within the average plantation owner's household, a fact which may have allowed some of the behavioral patterns to have survived within the context of the plantation community. Conclusion A couple of issues raised at the beginning of this paper can now be readdressed. Specifically, some of the issues related to the archaeological defini tion of ethnicity, "African retentions," and Afri can-American acculturation and adaptation within the context of the agricultural system of the South can be explored. First, the discovery of ethnicity and African retentions will come from historical archaeologists systematically investigating artifact context without a priori definitions of artifact func tion and use. The associational context of that por tion of the Jordan Plantation discussed here has been highly preserved. While such a situation may be rare?indeed some reviewers have stated "unique," it can still be employed to demonstrate an important issue within historical archaeology. This issue is that of assigning function and mean ing to artifacts. The pronounced tendency among historical archaeologists is to make such assign ments from the viewpoint of "cultural descen dants." In such a situation, documents and ac quired "knowledge" of artifact function and historical context define both the function and meaning of items recovered in the archaeological record. Such a view is static at best and unscien tific at worst. For all archaeologists, the assign ment of function and meaning requires the exca vation of sites in which the associational context has been preserved on some or all of the sites. It may well be that such contexts are rare on extant plantation sites. If so, then historical archaeolo gists will be limited in their ability to reconstruct behavior in slave and tenant farmer communities independent of historical documents. Associa tional context provides the data necessary for the reconstruction of individual, small group, and community activities, statuses, roles, and changes within each of these. Open community deposits, e.g., general site middens, trash dumps, and un der-house deposits, and so forth, do not permit these types of questions to be researched. Such community deposits are the result of the activities of use and disposal for all of the inhabitants of the site, human as well as nonhuman. Archaeologists</page><page sequence="13">STRUCTURAL CONTINUITY IN AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN SLAVE AND TENANT COMMUNITY 19 have no effective method to "control" these de posits and factor out the actual depositional agents. Second, the question of the definition of func tion and meaning directly affects the way historical archaeologists understand the development of cul ture. As the artifactual evidence from the Jordan Plantation demonstrates, the material culture em ployed and deposited at the plantation was almost solely of European-American origin and had func tion and meaning within that context. When the material culture was employed within the slave and tenant farming community contexts, however, some portion of it acquired distinctly different meanings and uses. Questions raised by archaeol ogists concerning ethnicity and the definition of acculturation and adaptational patterns and pro cesses involves sets of behaviors, not single arti factual differences. The point here is that individ uals and groups can, and do, select material items and invest them with certain beliefs and symbols. The cultural origin of the material items represents only one part in a group's consideration of function and meaning. Within American slavery and ten ancy, the differential use and manipulation of cer tain of the dominant culture's material objects may likely have been the rule rather than the exception, in which case such behavior might aid in the ex planation of some of the variation noted in Afri can-American and European-American "culture" within the United States. Definition and meaning of objects of material culture, as well as accep tance, rejection, and modification of ideas, behav ioral patterns, and material items, are processes subject to variation depending upon the back ground and interaction of those involved. Tradi tionally, historians and historical archaeologists have looked at the development of African-Amer ican culture as a process of acceptance, modifica tion, or rejection of European-American culture. However, just as clearly, this has not been an en tirely ' 'one way street.'' In order to investigate this interaction more fully, archaeologists must look for and extensively excavate associational contexts within slave and tenant farmer communities throughout the South. Only through the compari sons of such data can one begin to talk about ac culturation processes, the retention of so-called African behavioral patterns, and the definition of ethnicity. Further, such comparisons should help to define the amount of interplay between aspects of European-American and African-American cul ture in the evolution of both. Finally, if historical archaeologists wish to uti lize archaeology to provide new insights into the cultural evolution of Africans into African-Amer icans, detailed, fine-scale artifact analyses must be employed. Such analyses may lead to the discov ery of ethnicity, African retentions, and the accul turation and adaptational processes. These analy ses must include the testing of ethnographic analogies derived from African and African-Amer ican sources. European-American sources for be havioral interpretation should be expected to be somewhat different from African and African American ones, at least until they can be demon strated to explain more of the data derived from historical archaeological research. Africans and African-Americans may often be "invisible" in written history, but through carefully constructed archaeological research, they do not have to re main that way.</page></plain_text>
