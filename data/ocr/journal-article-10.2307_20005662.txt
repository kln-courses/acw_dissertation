STRUCKMEYER Professor of Philosophy, Westchester State College PHENOMENOLOGY AND RELIGION: SOME COMMENTS In recent decades, particularly since the publication of Rudolf Otto's The Idea of the Holy (19I7; Eng. trans., I923) and Gerardus Van der Leeuw's Religion in Essence and Manifestation (I933; Eng. trans., I938), what is known as the 'phenomenological' approach to the study of religion has become extremely popular. I myself, in teaching courses in religious studies, have for a number of years used Van der Leeuw's classic study; it is a work of amazing insight and scholarship, and perhaps the single greatest example ofjust how successful the method of phenomenology can be when applied to a distinct field of study. But it is not only in the domain of religious studies that phenomenologists have made important contributions; in the spheres of social and political theory, for example, as well as in the philosophy of art, the philosophy of psychology, and other areas, there have been notable accomplishments. Yet for all of its successes, phenomenology remains something of an anomaly in recent philosophical thought. Its ties to existentialism are loosely understood by many philosophers on the 'outside', and one lacks the patience to re-read - or, more likely, read for the first time - such seminal nineteenth-century works as Hegel's Phenomenology of Mind and Spranger's Lebensformen. The state of European philosophy and science in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries no longer holds much interest for us, yet it is precisely this period which gave birth to what we now call the phenomenological movement (this same period, interestingly, also gave us positivism, pragmatism, and some other philosophical currents). I do not wish to investigate, in this paper, the historical background of the phenomenological movement, though I shall find it necessary to refer to at least two figures who played pivotal roles in the movement's beginnings: Franz Brentano and Edmund Husserl. I freely admit that I have done little, indeed very little, reading in either of these figures - a sin more forgivable in the case of Brentano than in that of Husserl, phenomenologists would be likely to point out (since the later Brentano largely repudiated Husserl's basic approach). Nevertheless, to the extent that I have read a bit of their writings, and have learned much from scholars such as Van der Leeuw who apply the method to particular disciplines, I may perhaps be granted the 0034-4125/80/2828-3080 $0I.50 ( I98o Cambridge University Press lo RES i6</page><page sequence="2">254 FREDERICK R. STRUCKMEYER liberty of asking several questions which strike me as interesting and important. One of these is the following: Is it really very useful to speak of an 'essence' of religion which appears to us and is understandable providing we are able to 'bracket' our metaphysical commitments and simply discuss the phenomenon, the 'structure', which we have apprehended and understood? The question here, in other words, is about 'essences'. Was Husserl in fact a Platonist? A 'logicist'?? Husserlians themselves argue about this sort of thing,' but what seems clear in any case is that Husserl carried his opposition to nineteenth-century empiricist nominalism (of which John Stuart Mill would have been the major representative) to extreme lengths. There have been other philosophers - e.g. Charles Peirce - who also, during the period we are speaking about, were vigorously opposed to sceptical nominalism. But Peirce did not become a 'transcendental idealist', while Husserl did. In any event, what chiefly disturbs me in the essentialist thesis when formulated along Husserlian lines is that it is supposed to be truly 'scientific'. It is supposed to be the nearest approximation to a 'presuppositionless' philosophy that is attainable.2 Where the study of religion is concerned, what this means is that religion (for the first time, allegedly) can be studied without metaphysical bias. But is such a programme necessary and does it seem to work? A second question that concerns me, where the relation of phenomenology to religion is concerned, is whether there is here as much compatibility as some have supposed - especially if, as Marvin Farber claims, phenomenology is a 'philosophy within nature'3 - and if religion is taken to include at least the possibility of a supra-naturalistic component. In the space of this paper, however, I cannot do more than make a few observations (and those mostly near the end) concerning this latter question. I shall therefore concentrate upon determining whether the phenomenological method, especially as practised and defended by Van der Leeuw, actually manages to 'bracket' metaphysical claims, and whether it gives us 'pure description' unsullied by philosophical or theological bias. Even in pursuing this programme, however, I do not intend to attempt a full-blown investigation and critique of the phenomenological method; I shall rather limit myself to the discussion of certain key notions 'on the fly', instead of expounding at the outset what I take to be the core of the method. The best place to begin, then, is in medias res: let us look at certain passages in Van der Leeuw which seem to belie the phenomenologists' claims. 1 See, for example, Joseph Kockelmans' comments in his collection of Husserl studies, entitled Phenomenologv (Garden City, New York: Doubleday, I967), pp. 83-5. 2 See Marvin Farber, 'The Ideal of a Presuppositionless Philosophy', in Kockelmans (ed.), op. cit., part I, sect.

In speaking of faith,1 for instance, Van der Leeuw remarks that 'here we forsake the domain of appearances and inward experiences. Faith "appears" to us just as little as does guilt.' Again, in discussing revelation, Van der Leeuw contends that here phenomenology comes to a halt. . ., for the 'appearance' of any phenomenon as such .., must undoubtedly be essentially different from that self-disclosure of God with which revelation is concerned .. . It is impossible, owing to the essential conditions of my situation, to understand [intellectually] revelation, since a revelation comprehended would not be one ... As phenomenologists,. . . we must regard as valid revelation whatever presents itself as such. We can attempt to differentiate solely between genuine and spurious experience of revelation ... Revelation is the act of God ... The phenomenologist can only discuss what is reported to him...2 Aside from the oddly circular claim that this passage contains ('it is impossible... to understand revelation, since a revelation comprehended would not be one...'), the quotation is interesting for my purposes in its admission that some aspects of religion are indeed beyond the ken of the phenomenologist. But just why should this be so, and why just these phenomena? On what possible grounds could Van der Leeuw possibly decide that faith and revelation are not amenable to being understood phenomen ologically, when virtually everything else in the history of religion (he implies) can be so understood? Clearly, the grounds are not that faith is an 'inner' attitude and that the phenomenologist can only discuss what appears outwardly, i.e. the empirical. Throughout his entire, exhaustive study Van der Leeuw has been discussing aspects of religion (e.g., soul-travel, demonism, and mysticism) which are 'private' in the same sense in which faith is private. One does not observe souls or mystical states as one observes bodies and their behaviour. Why, then, make an exception of revelation and faith? In the passage cited above, further, Van der Leeuw claims that 'we must regard as valid revelation whatever presents itself as such', and that 'we can attempt to differentiate solely between genuine and spurious experience of revelation'. This strikes me as an impossible programme - and an inconsistent one - because how can the phenomenologist know whether he has encountered a genuine experience of revelation unless he has prior knowledge of the deity who is revealed? It is one thing to define revelation as the 'act of God'. But it is quite another to claim that 'experience of revelation' can be judged as spurious or not without taking anything for granted about the source and validity of the experience. 1 Gerardus Van der Leeuw, Religion in Essence and Manifestation, trans.

STRUCKMEYER An illustration of Van der Leeuw's tendency (whether or not it is a tendency of others who use the phenomenological method) to allow his own religious and theological opinions to determine his conclusions regarding certain phenomena is found in the chapter entitled 'Praise, Lallation, and Silence'. After making the fine observation that, concerning glossolalia ('speaking in tongues'), we must say of a man that 'something speaks through him',1 he nevertheless shortly arrives at the odd conclusion: 'glossolalia, in which "it" does indeed speak, is ultimately nothing more than verbosity; but the silence of profound emotional disturbance is the manifestation of the super-powerful itself, the wordless decision of the eternal Word '.2 We are not told on what grounds one might consider this latter claim true. Perhaps it is because Van der Leeuw himself is suspicious of glossolalia but is, on the other hand, very sympathetic toward the silence of the mystic. (If such is the case, it is not made explicit.) In any event, the method of phenomenology does not permit one to ask what grounds there are for the truth of a judgment, since one is - allegedly - only describing what appears. Yet in the passage cited above Van der Leeuw is clearly making a ' non phenomenological' judgment about the value, and perhaps also the meaningful reality, of the increasingly common experience (within recent Christianity, at least) known as 'speaking in tongues'. Very well, one may reply. But this only shows that even Van der Leeuw has his weaknesses; even he has not been totally consistent in employing the phenomenological method, the method which avoids presuppositions, which 'brackets' metaphysical assumptions, and which describes the 'structures' (whether religious or otherwise) which appear, are understood, and then spoken about. It may be argued, in short, that the inconsistencies in Van der Leeuw's treatment of revelation, faith, and glossolalia show only that he was perhaps too eager to make an exception of the Christian religion (and his own interpretation of it) in certain questionable ways; it does not show that there is anything deficient in the phenomenological method itself. Besides, has not Van der Leeuw himself disarmed the critic who would accuse him of a certain religious bias? 'I deliberately begin. . .,' he tells us, 'from the Christian viewpoint.. .'3 However, he immediately adds, this does not entail advocating any 'dogmatic treatment' of the relevant religious material. 'Rather,' he says, 'do I retain the typical phenomenological intellectual suspense (epoche), while at the same time I bear in mind that this is possible only in the light of one's own experience, and that this can never be free from its own religious determinateness.'4 A Buddhist, he remarks, would therefore be expected to engage in religious phenomenology using his own belief as the starting point, I Ibid. p. 432. 2 Ibid. 3 Ibid. p. 645- 4 Ibid. p. 646.</page><page sequence="5">PHENOMENOLOGY AND RELIGION 257 and then he would naturally discover the culmination of religion in Buddhism. Whether he would be 'right' in so doing, however, is not a matter for phenomenology itself to decide, but for theology or metaphysics. But he would be unable to proceed in any other way... In general, the 'comparison' of religions among themselves is possible only by thus beginning from one's own attitude to life. For religions are not wares that one can spread out on a table.1 All of this is finely said, and I wish only to make two comments concerning it. One is that, if Van der Leeuw is taken literally - if it is true that religions are not 'wares that one can spread out on a table', and that a Buddhist (for example) would find in his own religion (and his own sect of Buddhism, no doubt, as was in fact often the case) the 'culmination of religion', - it would seem that certain odd consequences follow. The oddest of these is that there are now as many (potential) phenomenologies of religion as there are religions - or, more exactly, sectarian interpretations of religion. And why stop there? Why not say there are as many religious phenomenologies as there are religious individuals, since even within the same sect there will be differing interpretations of scripture and doctrine? But if this is so, how can the phenomenological method claim to be giving us anything but another one-sided interpretation of the religious facts, facts which will still be seen by the individual in the way which his culture or sect or frame of mind dictates? In short, it appears that the admission made by Van der Leeuw in the lengthy quotation above cuts the nerve of the phenomenological method, at least regarding its claim to treat phenomena 'objectively'. Perhaps the reply will be made that this is not so, for what is essential and distinctive to the method is that the 'typical . .. intellectual suspense (epoche) ' is retained, which ensures that all (religious) phenomena will be 'considered solely as they are presented to the mind, without any further aspects such as their real existence, or their value, being taken into account'.2 In short, phenomenologists may reply, the method is successful so long as no value judgments or truth claims are made, and so long as the appearances are interpreted as 'given.' However, phenomenology does discuss appearances, and to discuss them it has to make assertions. And assertions must be either true or false. An illustration ofjust how important this is, and of how Van der Leeuw fails to notice that he himself transgresses the limits of his own method, is found in a chapter where he is discussing anthropomorphism in religion. There is a 'grain of truth', he says, 'in the contentions of Xenophanes and Feuerbach, that man has created a God after his own image. In fact he did so create the mother and the saviour, but not thefather.'3 Here, as elsewhere in the work in question, a claim is made with meagre or nonexistent supporting evidence. Van der Leeuw does impressively show how the mother and saviour 'forms' 1 Ibid. 2 Ibid. pp. 645, 646, n. i. 3 Ibid. p. I05 (my italics).</page><page sequence="6">258 FREDERICK R. STRUCKMEYER seem to be earlier and more basic, in religious life, than the form of the father (Judaism, for example, is a 'religion of the father'). But the examples he cites are totally inadequate to support his philosophical claim that the father form alone was not created by man 'after his own image'; Freud and Feuerbach would never accept such a claim, after all, a claim which appears quite arbitrary. Either we see that it is so, presumably, or we do not. The phenomenologist, as usual, does not 'argue' or make rationally disputable claims ;1 he merely discusses appearances. And yet in the statement cited Van der Leeuw has (again) clearly gone beyond appearances. One begins to wonder if it is not the nature of the method itself that inspires this tendency, for having made a controversial judgment the phenomenologist can happily exempt himself from having made it! Ordinary tests of truth and falsity do not apply to him, since he has already (officially) disclaimed their relevance. He is merely describing appearances, not asserting that something is or is not the case. (Thus a strange, covert 'appearance vs. reality' dichotomy is introduced.) Yet truth claims of various sorts, including metaphysical truth claims, are made in various parts of Van der Leeuw's book. To point this out is not to detract from the greatness of the work; it merely suggests that the phenom enological method may set itself a program which, at least in regard to the study of religion (and perhaps in other instances as well), it cannot achieve. Several possible reasons why it cannot achieve this ambitious programme of 'scientific description ' become plausible when we investigate in a preliminary way the beginnings of the phenomenological movement. We learn, for example, that Franz Brentano - an early forerunner of the movement - parted company (especially in his later writings) with Edmund Husserl. In Brentano's work, The True and the Evident,2 there are some important clues concerning the reasons for this split. In a letter which he wrote to Husserl in 1905, Brentano makes the following remarks: Whoever really makes an evident judgment really knows the truth and is certain of it; whoever really knows something with direct evidence is directly certain of the truth. This is unaffected by the fact that the knower, as a person judging, came into being, is subject to causation, and is dependent upon the particular cerebral organization which he happens to have. To the one who judges with evidence, the truth is secured in itself, and not by reflection on any such preconditions... There is no need at all to postulate any such thing as a truth in itself or a judgment in itself. There are only particular individuals who judge with evidence.3 I I am overstating the case somewhat, at this point, but not too greatly. Van der Leeuw does concede that 'the problem [faced by phenomenology] becomes that of what is obviously evidence' (pp. 684-5; Concerning Husserl's concept of evidence, see Cartesian Meditations, trans. Dorion Cairns [The Hague: Martinus Nijhoff, I960, ?5-6, especially p. 12]). Again, he says that 'the phenomenologist... cannot proceed without submitting again and again to correction by the facts. . .' (p. 685). But such statements are belied by others which indicate Van der Leeuw's unwillingness to have the phenomenologist's 'interpretations' be judged in the light of ordinary epistemological standards. 2 Franz Brentano, The True and the Evident, ed. Oskar Kraus, Eng. ed. trans. Roderick M. Chisholm, et al. (New York: Humanities, I966). 3 Ibid. p. I37.</page><page sequence="7">PHENOMENOLOGY AND RELIGION 259 The conceptions of truth and evidence indicated in the above passage are derived by Brentano almost directly from Aristotle. Husserl, Brentano is arguing throughout this letter, is mistaken in thinking that we fall into 'psychologism' if we admit a close connection between logic and psychology. Brentano also finds psychologism 'anathema', but insists that 'this does not mean that we should [in reaction to it] countenance a realm of entities of reason '.1 He is here alluding, of course, to those ideal 'essences' toward which Husserl believed our minds are directed when we truly understand some phenomenon - say, religion. It is not my purpose to become immersed in the considerations of logic, evidence, and truth which preoccupied Brentano and which, he believes, misled Husserl into supposing that a new intellectual method - the phenom enological method - was necessary in order for the sciences to obtain genuine knowledge. Brentano's importance for my purposes is his contention that the phenomenologist's programme is unnecessary; I have been making the stronger claim that it is not successful - at least in one conspicuous case - in the way that it pretends. There have been philosophers, notably Sartre, who argue with some persuasiveness that Husserlian phenomenology should more properly be called phenomenalism - since, while Husserl avoided Descartes' error of postu lating a substantial self, and 'timidly remained on the plane of functional description', he paid the consequent price of being unable to pass beyond the pure description of appearances as such. That is, he became in effect something of a Kantian idealist.2 But how can I know the Other? This, says Sartre, is the crucial question which Husserl does not resolve. Within Husserl's philosophy, he contends, 'the Other is the object of empty intentions... The only reality which remains is therefore that of my intention. ..'3 What Sartre alleges, in short, is that Husserl has not successfully escaped solipsism, though he believes he has. The relevance of Sartre's critique of Husserl for my limited purposes in this paper is that Sartre tends to confirm epistemologically, in the context of the 'other minds' problem, what I have been suggesting about the less than total success of the phenomenological method when applied to religion. Van der Leeuw, a preeminent practitioner of the method, asserts that it has ultimately no other goal than pure objectivity... (phenomenology) desires to gain access to the facts themselves; and for this it requires a meaning, because it I Ibid. 2 Jean-Paul Sartre, Being and Nothingness: An Essay in Phenomenological Ontology, trans. Hazel E. Barnes (New York: Philosophical Library, 1956), p. 73. Van der Leeuw (op. cit. p. 676) denies, interestingly enough, that Husserlian phenomenology does entail idealism; he similarly denies that it entails any metaphysical realism. It is simply maintained, he says, that only by assigning things 'form and meaning' can they be understood. 3 Ibid. p. 235</page><page sequence="8">260 FREDERICK R. STRUCKMEYER cannot experience the facts just as it pleases. This meaning, however, is purely objective: all violence, either empirical, logical, or metaphysical, is excluded.' Indeed, says Van der Leeuw, phenomenology properly understood is not a method that has been reflectively elaborated, but is man's true vital activity, consisting in losing himself neither in things nor in the ego, neither in hovering above objects like a god nor dealing with them like an animal, but in doing what is given to neither animal nor god: standing aside and understanding what appears into view.2 This is strikingly put. But whether the 'true vital activity' which Van der Leeuw speaks of is anything more than the ordinary, Aristotelian, scientifically honest attempt to describe things 'as they are' is questionable. All men by nature desire to know, said Aristotle. The phenomenologist believes that he attains to knowledge of the 'essences' of things; that Pure Objectivity is a goal he reaches when other methods fail to reach it. But the phenomenologist has not persuasively shown that in fact he has reached Pure Objectivity; indeed the instances taken from Van der Leeuw's otherwise splendid work tend to show that he, as a scholar investigating the phenomenon of religion, has not merely been 'standing aside and understanding what appears into view.' His own interpretations, even when he officially acknowledges them as such (and this almost never happens), influence him in a way that he does not explicitly acknowledge. In short, as Sartre contended, the egocentric predicament seems not to have been side-stepped by Husserl and those who try to adopt his method (or at least his vocabulary). Perhaps Brentano is to be heeded when he suggests that a return to Aristotelian ways of thinking would provide a way out of the impasse of modern epistemology: thought, when it is correct, is simply about things, not about other thoughts, or propositions, or essences. When one asserts what is, one speaks truly; otherwise, one speaks falsely or mistakenly. Thus whether one is doing phenomenology or not, one may correctly (or incorrectly, as the case may be) describe some phenomenon - scientific, aesthetic, political, religious, or whatever. So if, as Van der Leeuw himself says, this sort of describing is in fact man's 'true vital activity', why did Husserl and his followers need to 'transcendentalize' it? Why claim that it yields 'pure objectivity' when in fact (as experience constantly shows) many of ourjudgments are simply mistaken? A mistake is after all a mistake, no matter which epistemological method one may be employing. By way of a slightly irrelevant postscript to the foregoing, I am moved to wonder whether the phenomenological method is after all so compatible with Christianity and other religious orthodoxies as Van der Leeuw seems to suppose. The example of Max Scheler, at least, indicates otherwise. In an Op. cit. p. 677. 2 Ibid. p. 676 ('not' is not italicized in the original).</page><page sequence="9">PHENOMENOLOGY AND RELIGION 26i introduction to his translation of Scheler's last work, Man's Place in Nature,' Hans Meyerhoff points out that in this small book Scheler has clearly repudiated the view of religion taken in his earlier writings. The chief of those works, entitled On the Eternal in Man,2 argues for 'a general realm of values corresponding to the objects sought out, or "intended by" our feelings, so [that] there is a special realm of the holy corresponding to our religious feelings and acts ... The phenomenological analysis consists in taking the contents of this religious world at their face value.'3 Having written this book, however, Scheler almost immediately disowned it. After I92I, Meyerhoff points out, 'the conflict between the naturalistic and phenomen ological components in Scheler's thought broke out into the open', and Scheler reverted to a world-view which was more materialistic than idealistic - or which, at its best, attempted 'to mediate between materialistic and idealistic conceptions of history.'4 Yet this mediation was not easy, if it was possible at all, and towards the end of Man's Place in Nature the author speaks of the 'self-deification' of man in a way that is reminiscent of Hegel or Spinoza; Scheler now admits that it is an act of faith which impels (in Meyerhoff's words) his 'basic conviction that life and spirit are not antago nistic, but complementary principles in nature. . .'5 Recently Marvin Farber has also spoken of a 'philosophy within nature '.6 He and some other phenomenologists apparently find it less agonizing than did Scheler to combine phenomenological analysis with a straightforwardly naturalistic world-view. Theism is simply given up, however horrifying this must be to those many Catholic and other religious thinkers of our day who have found (or who think they have found) in phenomenology an important ally and methodological tool. In Farber's view, philosophy cannot transcend 'the existing social conditions or the human realm... [It] will always be historically conditioned.'7 I suppose it might be argued that, as a method, phenomenology is compatible both with theism (Christian or otherwise) and with naturalism. Since the method makes no metaphysical claims, it may be employed by thinkers of varying world views. But this seems too easy a way out. Early phenomenologists like Spranger (whom Van der Leeuw cites) spoke of the Lebenswelt, the lived world of concrete experience, as the place where man is inextricably rooted. Only a Kierkegaardian leap of faith would seem to be able to take us beyond this world of empirical fact. If a transcendent God is both real and knowable, then, such a deity will not merely be one fact among other empirical data. An empirical theism might be possible, but apart from revelation what could it possibly tell us? 1 Boston: Beacon Press, I96I. 2 Original edition, I92I; English ed., London, SCM Press, I960. 3 Scheler (Meyerhoffed.), p. xix. 4 Ibid. p. xxi. 5 Ibid. p. xxxv; text, chap. iv. 6 Farber, op. cit. Ibid. p. 240.</page><page sequence="10">262 FREDERICK R. STRUCKMEYER In sum, I incline to the view that Van der Leeuw among others has overrated phenomenology's value in the sphere of religion. Where the method has been successful, and Van der Leeuw's book is the single greatest piece of evidence to that effect, a partial reason may be that earlier treatments of religion were so very one-sided (either pro or con). Where the method has not been successful, where metaphysical bias has entered (as in the instances cited earlier from Van der Leeuw), this may be because the really crucial questions in religion are notjust questions of descriptive fact. 'Standing aside' here will not work; one must believe in order to understand, as Augustine said. To the extent that Van der Leeuw admits this, as he occasionally does, to that extent he surrenders the phenomenological method. If he were to adhere strictly to phenomenology, he could have no reason for preferring Christianity to Buddhism - or to Farber's naturalism. But he does have such reasons, though these are not explicitly formulated. I merely wish he had been more forthright in recognizing that, in terms of the phenomenological method, straightforward questions of evidence and truth are partially submerged, to be replaced rather dubiously by 'structures', essences, and 'pure objectivity'. But the question of truth, in religion and elsewhere, has a way of reappearing, submerge it though we may. To substitute one epistemological method for another does not change that fact at all.</page></plain_text>
