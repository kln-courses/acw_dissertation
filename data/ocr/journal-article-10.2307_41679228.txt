VITRU VI AN MEN ( Enter Mat ta-Cl ark) In one of the final scenes of Gordon Matta- Clark's 1976 film Conical Intersect , the camera travels across the metal exoskeleton of the Pompidou Center before ascending to the side wall of a neighboring Baroque edifice; it then zooms in on a large circular aperture, as if about to enter the derelict structure.02 [Cut] Inside, we watch three visitors walk among the artist's circular cuts as if surveying the building's alterations. [Cut] Close shot of a bulldozer operator waiting inside his vehicle. [Cut] We return to the building with a panoramic view of the interior, shot from below. One by one, the three visitors reappear, no longer wandering, but immobi- lized inside the geometrically perforated décor. On the right, a man (whom we recognize as the director Marc Pet it jean) stands at the edge of a circular floor aperture. One floor above, a woman supports herself by extending one arm against a wall cut by the artist. In the middle of this inanimate triad stands a younger man. While the two lateral figures stand tangent ially to the circular openings, the middle character steps inside a wall aperture and extends his legs and arms in a diagonal gesture, as if inscribing himself into the circular void. Projected against a luminous background, the carefully choreographed posture appears as a rehearsal of the "Vitruvian figure," well known from a number of Renaissance architectural treatises.^*1 Why insert this classical quotation into a contempo- rary urban scene? And why do it precisely at this culminating point of the narrative, moments before the building- and the artist's work- are to be unceremoniously demolished? Is this a gesture of defiance in the face of inevitable collapse, or a manifesto for the immanence of architectural theory against the transience of building? Suspended between ancient narratives of architecture and the exigencies of modern real estate, Mat ta-Clark 's Vitruvian man appears as the immobilized victim not only of the artist's formalist execution, but also of the intrusion of the real as an "impossible" rupture- or a "cut"- within the urban and historical continuum.

Man's figure was the microcosm perfectly aligned with the macrocosm of the universe. But what happens to such axiomatic principles after their cosmological foundation collapses? And what if this epistemological breakdown had occurred centuries ago, contemporary with the Baroque edifice of Conical Intersect , inside which the quotation of these defunct principles is artfully inserted? It is as if the panoramic shot in the film's final scene not only records the gradual disappearance of the old building and the emergence of the modern city, but also traces a second allegorical circle that measures the active circumference of an ancient system, just before its architectural support breaks down. The anthropocentric reference in Matta-Clark's Conical Intersect is in fact supported by a measurement indicated in one of the few preliminary drawings for that project, in which the artist marks the diameter of a central wall cut as being two meters wide.03 The anthropometric measurement serves as additional proof that this presumably impromptu gesture had been studied in advance, as part of the artist's overall design. In fact, if we look to Matta-Clark's earlier career, we discover that this filmed performance had been rehearsed on a number of occasions. "How the microcosmic self is revealed into the whole," reflects the former architecture student in a 1976 interview: "In fact, one of my earlier works dramatized that when I hung myself upside down at the center of one of my openings."04 This "dramatization" refers to one of Matta-Clark's first per- formances in 1971, when the artist suspended himself upside down from the ceiling of an abandoned pier in Manhattan, a structure furnished only by a tree growing out of a pile of dirt and industrial waste.05 The oscillations of the artist's body brushing against the tree created an energy circuit between man and the desolate environment. This partial revo- lution was also part of a microcosmic circle, inside which the figure of Vitruvius, as well as his image of world order, had been overturned. "Something for Vitruvius to be proud of," boasts the artist in one of his aphorisms on Anarchi tec - ture06; but perhaps the aim of the formal revolutions performed by the "prodigal son" of architecture was to make the alleged "father" of architectural theory more eccentrically "fulfilled" than self - centeredly reasserted. 07 Beyond these acknowledged citations of Vitruvius, Matta-Clark's references to the ancient author were often more implicit. Such is the case with the artist's 1974 Clock Shower , another filmed performance, in which Matta-Clark suspended himself from the digits of the clock crowning the thirteen- story tower of the New York Life Insurance building by McKim, Mead, and White (one of the first tall buildings in Manhattan designed in "Renaissance revival" style) and washed himself with soap and a garden hose.08 This performance has often been perceived as a rehearsal of similar comic film routines by Charlie Chaplin and Buster Ke a ton. 09 Yet consider- ing the striking re - inscript ion of the human figure inside the sculpted circle of a neo-Renaissance tower clock, could we rethink Matta-Clark's performance as an ironic reenactment of the "Vitruvian figure" that once again breaks into the architec- tural and urban territory of the real? In a way similar to the Vitruvian performer's defiant resistance in Conical Intersect , the artist's struggle in Clock Shower to push back the large THE REAL PERSPECTfi 42</page><page sequence="4">Ill Spyros Papapetros metal hands of the building clock serves as another allegorical reference to the exigencies of temporality and the circular pattern of architectural discourses. We know that the artist originally intended to carry out this public performance in the nude; however, anticipating com- plaints by office workers in nearby buildings, he consented to wear a short raincoat, a hat, and black tights.10 Had his original intention been fulfilled, the reference to the Vitruvian figure and its cosmological extensions might have been overly explicit, while in the realized project, they remain sugges- tively covert. Indeed, the macrocosmic analogy of this perfor- mance appears only in the very last frames of Mat ta-Clark 's film, when the camera gradually zooms out from the building clock and shows part of downtown Manhattan, with a view down Broadway. We then realize that what we have been witnessing thus far has been a telescopic view of the tower from a distant point. Like the panoramic building views in Conical Intersect , the macrocosmic reference in Clock Shower is made by the traveling movement of the camera as it surveys the urban landscape, revealing the city's covert cosmological underpinnings. In total, all three of Matta-Clark's post -Vitruvian performances trace correspondences between bodies, buildings, and the city, as indices of cosmic order. The fact that Conical Intersect's Vitruvian quotation is the last and also the most "literal" of the three iterations underscores the inverted projection of architectural origins upon the artist's cuts, as he retraces the cone of bodily- and historical- vision. The very title of Matta-Clark's third performance, Conical Intersect , speaks of an intersection, not only with the "holes" of urban history, as art historian Pamela Lee has previously suggested, but also with the histories and theories of architecture itself.11 Perhaps most intersections with history, past and present, are conical: they circle around a void object of historical reference and converge towards a single hypothetical origin or historiographical apex. In sympathy, then, with the performative approach of Matta-Clark, we could restage the narrative that leads to his Vitruvian reenactments as a play that describes a series of cosmic encounters between historical personages, who only rarely appear together. The same architects, artists, and historians act as representatives both of the Renaissance and the Modern scene, and play that double role within each episode with carefully choreographed entrances and exits. PARALLEL HISTORIOGRAPHIES ( Enter Rowe and Wi ttkower) The historiographical apex in Matta- Clark's (i)conic narrative has already been established in his architectural education at Cornell under Colin Rowe. Art historian Thomas Crowe first underlined the relations of Matta- Clark's geometric building cuts to some of the rhythmic cor- respondences identified by Rowe in the villas of Palladio and Le Corbusier. 12 More recently, Anthony Vidier extended these relations to Rowe's own education under Rudolf Wittkower at the Warburg Institute in London, where Rowe wrote a thesis on a series of "theoretical drawings" by British architect Inigo Jones. These drawings, Rowe argued, were meant to be used in a treatise by Jones that was never published.13 Deep inside this historiographical sequence lies the legacy of a project that has remained tantalizingly unrealized. However, as in several of Matta-Clark's own works, the same project materializes in the form of drawing that not only serves as the illustration THE REAL PERSPECTfi 42 - 10 Crawford, in Jenkins (no-page number). - 11 Pamela M.

Matta-Clark's library contains no books by Rowe ( The Mathematics of the Ideal Villa was only first published in book form in 1976). It does include, however, a copy of Wittkower's Architectural Principles in the Age of Humanism (a 1965 reprint of the 1962 second edition), as well as a reprint of the 1924 second edition of Geoffrey Scott's empathetic account of The Architecture of Humanism- the very antipode of Wittkower's study- whose dust-jacket juxtaposes Leonardo's Vitruvian man with a classical architectural profile. И Fig- 02 But it was Witt- kower's book that included an entire series of the Vitruvian figure in several Renaissance variations, including Leonardo's Vitruvian man, as well as a lesser-known microcosmic image from Cesare Cesariano's 1521 edition of Vitruvius's Ten Books of Architecture- an image that appears even closer to Matta- Clark's Vitruvian performer in Conical Intersect . 15 Unlike Leonardo, who- in order to fit his man into both the circle and the square- drew two pairs of arms and legs, Cesariano fits his figure perfectly into both the circle and the square with only one set of limbs. As a result, however, the man's hands and feet are disproportionately outstretched to such a degree that the end product of this "humanist" experiment appears closer to a monster: inadvertently, the grid behind Cesariano's figure projects not so much a Renaissance geometric space, but rather the medieval landscape of hybrid similitudes between man and animal . 16 Nevertheless, Wittkower used this series of figures to illustrate humanist systems of proportion that were based upon the tacit correspondences between Microcosm and Macrocosm as described in Neo-Platonic philosophy. According to Wittkower, the Renaissance revival of that idea was based loosely on one THE REfiL PERSPECTfì 42</page><page sequence="6">113 Spyros Papapetros of the introductory paragraphs of Vitruvius's Third Book, which describes the exact "fit" of the human figure inside "perfect" geometric shapes: As a proof of the harmony and perfection of the human body, he [Vi truvius ] described how a well-built man fits with extended hands and feet exactly into the most perfect geometric figures , circle and square. This simple picture seemed to reveal a deep and fundamental truth about man and the world , and its importance for Renaissance architects can hardly be overestimated. The image haunted their imaginai ion. 17 The Vitruvian figure, then, represents for Wittkower an arche- typical gestalt that resurfaces in the collective imaginary of Renaissance architects, artists, and authors, from Francesco di Giorgio to Leonardo, and from Francesco Giorgi to Fra Giocondo and Cesariano. Manuscript copying and the invention of the printing press subsidized the cosmic popularity of that symbolic imago. Nearly 500 years later, the same "haunting" figure would enjoy another renaissance through a series of publications by architectural scholars, including Rowe and Wittkower, as part of a postwar discourse that strived to fuse (post)modern architectural principles with the philosophy of new humanism. 18 In spite of these general correspondences between student and adviser, there is a principal difference: the cosmological presuppositions reflected in Wittkower's Archi tec - turai Principi e s are conspicuously absent from Rowe's formalist iterations of the Renaissance typologies retraced by his teacher. 19 This becomes obvious in the rhythmic compositional patterns Rowe extracts from Palladian and Corbusian villas, an analysis that extended the typological variations described by Wittkower. Yet Rowe's Corbusian façade diagrams reduce Witt- kower's Neo-Platonic cosmos of Pythagorean numbers and musical scales to an abstract sequence of rhythmic variations, from "A-B-C-B-A" to "A-B-A-B-A," repeated and inverted ad infinitum . 20 Even more intriguing is the fact that in his own performances of the Vitruvian figure, Matta-Clark would return to the more symbolic cosmic properties of Renaissance architec- tural theory invoked by Wittkower, rather than to the rhythmic formal sequences reiterated by Rowe. But perhaps ever since the Renaissance, the very function of the Vitruvian circle has been to act not as the static center of an immutable historical order, but as the fulcrum of dynamic regressions and theoretical returns to earlier epistemological paradigms. In fact, within the postwar revival of cosmological theories in architecture, there are a number of similar revolutions in signification that precede the texts by Wittkower and Rowe and follow the cosmi - cally oriented scholarship of the turn- of - the - century. MICROCOSM AND MACROCOSM ( Enter Saxl) While at the Warburg Institute, Wittkower's closest intellectual mentor was Fritz Saxl, who was director of the Institute after its relocation from Hamburg to London, as well as the most intimate collaborator of its founder, the cultural historian Aby Warburg.21 In his broad engagement with Renaissance culture, as well as with contemporary philosophy, art, and architecture, Saxl was likely to have encouraged Wittkower to investigate the ramifications of Neo-Platonic ideas in the architecture of the Italian Renaissance. 22 Since its inception, the Warburg Library in Hamburg (KBW), which later THE REfiL PERSPECTfi 42 17 Wittkower (1971), 14. 18 On the historiographie context of Wittkower's publication, see Henry Mil- ion, "Rudolf Wittkower, Architectural Principles in the Age of Humanism: Its Influence on the Development of Modern Architecture," Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians 31. no. 2 (May 1972): 83-91 and Alina A.

The very emblem of the Warburg Institute is a cosmological image, or imago mundi , in the shape of a tetragram from a woodcut used in a 15th century edition of a text by Isidore of Seville. The insignia represents the correspondences between the four world elements, the four seasons, and the four human "humors." In 1926, Saxl gave a lecture on the idea of "Microcosm and Macrocosm," examining its development and representations from antiquity to the Middle Ages and the early Renaissance. 23 Saxl, who had already written a dissertation on and published a multi-volume catalogue of astrological illustrations in Medieval manuscripts, 24 argued that the belief in the corre- spondence between the human body and the world could be traced back to an Iranian myth of creation that refers to a "first man," whose height equals his width and whose skin and bodily orifices represent the sky and other parts of the universe. Expanding on these "Asiatic origins," while reiterating an argument first made by Warburg, Saxl pointed out that Vitruvius's reference to the equal dimensions of the human body was indebted to similar prin- ciples found in ancient Oriental texts and later "aesthet icized" in Greek and Roman discourses.25 The reappearance of anthropomorphic concepts of the universe in a number of 12th century illuminated manuscripts confirms the fact that Medieval writers were familiar with ancient hermetic cosmogonie traditions, as, for example, the illustrations drawn from the Christological visions of Hildegard von Bingen that "represent man in the centre of the heavenly sphere, with outstretched arms touching the circle with hands and feet."26 While Christian authors resist the "pagan" origins of Oriental astrology, they replicate its repertory of images and totem-like constellations.

Photos: Warburg Institute Archive, London. Saxl argued, however, that during the two hundred years between the 13th and 15th centuries, ancient cosmology expe- rienced a "revival in theory and practice." What previously had been merely an "illustrative" use of images gradually led to an acceptance of their ancient meaning, as well as their inclusion in official practices performed by the state and the church. "The step from a metaphorical use to the practical application of images," writes Saxl, "is not the sign of a new superstition but an example of a regressive evolution."27 For Saxl, the Renaissance took a step backwards in order to move ahead: it regressed into ancient cosmological interpretation to discover a rational cosmic order, one that granted a central place to the human individual and led to the creation of the Modern subject (which truly emerged a century later in the philosophy of Descartes).28 One can trace this epistemological transition in Leon- ardo's well-known Vitruvian figure, which, according to Saxl, no longer reflected the influence of cosmological speculation, but appropriated the combination of empirical observation with scientific reasoning and experimentation. Leonardo's project is both anthropocentric and anthropometric; it uses measurement and numerical proportion instead of abstract Medieval influ- ences. At the close of his lecture, Saxl juxtaposed Leonardo's Vitruvian drawing with Albrecht Dürer's Melanchol ia in order to illustrate the differences between Northern and Southern European mentalities. For Dürer, the Saturnian "Melancholy is a symbol of the individual mind looking for its own image in the mirror of the universe,"29 while for Leonardo, the Vitruvian figure serves as a model of "the mind" that "acquiesces" in the world of external objects by recognizing "its own principle of inherent regularity."30 Dürer, according to Saxl, verges toward self - reflect ive allegory, while Leonardo reaffirms the body as a symbol with a quantifiable presence within the realm of external objects, including architecture.^-03 One may place Saxl's 1926 lecture on "Microcosm and Macrocosm" within a growing number of interwar period European philosophical and anthropological discourses, which both question and reaffirm the centrality of the human subject from a global perspective. In 1929, Saxl exchanged a number of letters with Carl Einstein, then co- editor of the avant-garde French ethnographic and archaeological review Document s , concerning the journal's publication of a number of essays by the scholars of the Warburg Library, including Saxl's own lec- ture on "Microcosm and Macrocosm."31 While Saxl's lecture was THE REfìL PERSPECTfi 42 27 Ibid., 66. - 28 This is an extension of Saxl's argument presented in a contemporary newspaper review of the lecture included in the Saxl Papers, (WIA).

From the infinitely expanding world of accessory details in quattrocento paintings scrutinized by Warburg, to the enlarge- ments of entomological images- including microphotographs of the wings and legs of a fly- published in Document s , and from Saxl's global "maps of ideas" tracing the intercontinental migration of images, to the colonial ethnographic portfolio assembled by Einstein, Leiris, and Bataille, one can discern a distinctive cosmological practice of tracing correspondences between heterogeneous images, regions, and scholarly faculties, which re- informs the depiction of the world at every possible scale. PROPORTIONAL REVIVALS ( Reenter Wittkower, followed a day later by Le Corbusier) The failed collaboration between Document s and the Warburg Library proved to be symptomatic: Saxl's essay on the "Microcosm and Macrocosm" was only published in a posthumous anthology of the scholar's lectures in 1957, thirty years after the original lecture was delivered.34 Nevertheless, within that thirty- year delay, there were significant developments that made the idea of macrocosmic correspondence even more topical for audiences beyond the Warburg circle. By the time of Saxl's death in 1948, Wittkower had already published some of the essays that would later be included in his Architectural Principles . 35 That same year, a number of articles published in European architectural journals argued for the relevance of proportion in architec- tural design.36 Such a revival of interest in proportion, as well as in classicist principles of composition, did not go unnoticed. Reyner Banham, in his well-known 1955 Archi tec turai Review article on "New Brutalism," in which he remarks on the Smith- sons's Coventry Cathedral competition entry, attributes the project's symmetrical floor plan (a mere diagram made of con- centric circles and squares crossed by diagonal lines, that was, in fact, more neo-Vitruvian than "neo-Palladian" in its conception) to the passing "influence" of Wittkower- an influence the Smithsons would later refute.37 Does this impromptu or even erroneously attributed quotation by the "Brutalist" Smithsons demonstrate perhaps less a commitment to a set of immutable "humanist" principles than an interest in modularization and the typological standardization of architectural design? If so, then Brutalism and (New) Humanism converge in their common aspiration for design universais, making the seemingly "excep- tional" symmetry of the Coventry Cathedral simply an ordinary component of the Smithsons's general design system, which is hardly different in scope from the Miesian plan of their Hunstanton School (also reviewed by Banham in the same essay). The multivalent predicament created by the contemporary revival of proportion was outlined most succinctly during the First International Conference on Proportion, which was THE REfiL PERSPECTfl 42</page><page sequence="10">117 Spyros Papapetros organized in 1951 in Milan in conjunction with the Triennale of that year. Wittkower was asked to give the opening address, as well as the closing remarks, but had to leave on the second day; in his place, Sigfried Giedion offered a final "synthesis" of the conference at its conclusion. The list of speakers included other notable historians and theorists, including James Ackerman, Mat ila Ghyka, and Bruno Zevi, as well as artists and architects, including Gino Severini, Georges Van- tongerloo, Max Bill, Ernesto Rogers, Pier Luigi-Nervi, and, of course, Le Corbusier. 38 Both Wittkower, in his opening remarks, and Giedion, in his talk on "The Whole and the Part in Contemporary Architecture," agreed that the reinvigora- tion of interest in proportion was generated by a larger need for "humanizat ion" and "integration" in architecture and the arts.39 This notion of "integration" encompassed the areas of history and theory, as well as the practices of art and archi- tecture in synthesis with a variety of scientific disciplines, such as biology, sociology, physics, and engineering. The conference speakers delineated a composite portrait of propor- tion as an epistemological apparatus with a universal capacity for performance. Proportional systems were elevated to general organizing principles that could unify all previously disparate faculties of knowledge into a harmonious system of global coop- eration between artists, architects, and even governmental agencies from different regions of the world. The renewed expansion of proportion had both geopolitical and temporal repercussions. Reading through the conference abstracts, one realizes that the historians at the convention employed proportion as an apparatus of historical commensurability, a methodological tool that allowed them to trace conceptual correspondences between chronologically distant eras and the present. Wittkower, for example, argued that following the initial revolution of the Cubists, as well as the more recent modularization of architectural design by Le Corbusier, the 20th century was experiencing a transformation comparable to one that had occurred during the transition from the Middle Ages to the Renaissance. At that moment, geometric applications of proportion- as in the drawings of Villard de Honnecourt- were substituted by mathematical treatments, such as the numerical investigations in the work of Leonardo, including his drawings of the Vitruvian figure.40 Similarly, Zevi, in his talk on "The Fourth Dimension and Proportion," attempted to bridge Modern architecture with the Baroque, and to update the stakes of proportion according to the organic principles reflected in recent projects by Frank Lloyd Wright and Alvar Aalto. Proportion created a sense of correspondence in the very structure of historical time: history was now reorganized not as a linear progression, but as the rhythmic repetition of a limited number of isomorphic themes. Even the book and photography exhibit on proportion proposed prior to the conference and curated by the main organizer of the convention, the book dealer and antiquarian Clara Manzoli, reflected similar trans -historical alliances. Within the metallic frame of a modular scaffold (that was, of course, harmonically proportioned), historical documents- including a number of original codices and other rare manuscripts from the Renaissance- were placed inside glass vitrines alongside modern publications, large photographic reproductions, and contemporary music scores, in an attempt to spatialize the conference's thematic constellations.41 While such widespread resemblances across time and space might reaffirm the concept of an immutable order, the THE REfìL PERSPECTfì 42 - 38 Contributors also included Carola Giedion, Lucio Fontana, Carlo Mollino, Gillo Dörfles, and others.

While Wittkower did not hear Le Corbusier, he received a report of the rest of the proceedings from James Ackerman, who commented that Zevi "got Baroque all wrong" and that Corbusier "spoke so badly" that he could not follow him, and that, in general, the architect "was a great bore."

While the first volume was only published in 1950, Le Corbusier had been lecturing about his system for a number of years after the end of WWII and in a number of venues, including the Architectural Association. Architectural Review published an article analyzing Corbusier's modular system by the Hungarian scientist and aesthetician Matila Ghyka, "Le Corbusier's IVIodulor and the concept of the Golden Mean" AR 103, no. 614 (February 1948): 39-42. 47 In her overview of similar issues in Brit- ain, Eva-Marie Neumann argues that the revival of interest in proportion in Britain after WWII should be examined in the context of governmental requirements for "préfabrication" in building design. See Neumann, "Architectural Proportion in Britain," ibid. - 48 Corbusier, 122-3. 118 MICRO/MACRO Architecture, Cosmology, and the Real World modern perspective on proportion, as communicated by a number of the conference participants, was that of a dynamic form of change. According to Zevi, traditional rules were now "inapplicable," and therefore, proportion had to be modified in order to survive.42 Often, such change was situated not in the mathematical principles of proportion (which remained more or less the same), but in the shifting signification of its content. As an example of "dynamic" versus "static" conceptions of proportion, Giedion referred to the changing meaning of the Vitruvian man in relation to "Corbusier's representation of the man with the outstretched hand." Giedion also mentioned the differing conception of the circle in the Renaissance as a "symbol of serenity" in contrast with Klee's conception of the circle as the "unending rotation of a pendulum" and its association with movement.43 Some of these symbolic rotations were propelled by the more pragmatic tangents of contemporary technological innova- tions. Nervi stressed the relationship of proportion to tech- nology, standardization, and contemporary "typologies" of construct ion. 44 Along the same lines, Wittkower mentioned the standardization of design in Corbusier's Modulor system as a viable alternative for the modern afterlife of proportion, and, in fact, used the system to argue for the continuing relevance of such humanist principles in the 20th century. However, since Wittkower spoke on 27 September and left the next day (to attend the wedding of his son in England), he was not present for Corbusier's talk the following evening. This unfortunate constellation of events involving the two major (guest) stars of the conference might also reflect a relative lack of correspondence in their views about proportion. While Wittkower had referred in positive tones to Corbusier's system in his opening remarks, in an abstract written in preparation for the lecture, he expressed (in brackets) a reservation about the architect's use of proportion, which he finally decided not to voice in front of the audience: "(There is an inherent weakness in his and other recent attempts at a new rational- ization of proportion. I would call it the lack of symbolic quality- but this story is probably too long and complicated to be included into my talk.)"45 Perhaps Wittkower was not entirely justified in claiming that Corbusier's "rationalized" version of proportion lacked symbolic qualities. Even if Le Modulor is a simplified version of harmonic ratios and makes no claims to a larger philosophi- cal agenda, its cosmological aspirations are inescapable. However, for Le Corbusier, the cosmic essence of proportion does not reflect the Platonic order of the universe and its celestial "harmony of the spheres" (as it did for Wittkower), but rather, it spoke to a new global economic hierarchy following World War II. Published a year before the Milan conference, the first volume of Le Modulor 46 confirmed that the revival of interest in proportion and modular systems was a response to the growing needs of the building, furniture, and packaging industry in the postwar era, as well as the demand for a system that would transport objects and construction patterns across the world. 47 In addition to illustrations of advertising posters for carts used for the exportation of fruit and vegetables from the North African colonies to Europe,48 there are two adjoining sketches in the first volume: one is a European map; the other is a global map. Together, the maps depict a network of international collaboration, as well as the trajectory of the architect's own travel destinations, which locates the global expansion THE REfìL PERSPECTfi 42</page><page sequence="12">119 Spyros Papapetros of his modular concept.49 In the second volume of Le Modulor, Corbusier's system appears to have conquered the globe, having been translated into four different languages, including Span- ish and Japanese. Such reflexive correspondences suggest that in spite of its cosmic references, the architect's self - invented unit essentially represents a closed microcosmic system with no viable links to a macrocosmic context other than its circuitous replication within a globalized industrial network. If indeed, as Wittkower suggested, Le Corbusier's proportional system lacked "symbolic quality," it acquired allegorical significance thanks to its very failure to advance as a commensurate system to the regional methods of production it aspired to unite. Like almost every revival, the resurgence of proportion was short-lived. An attempt by the organizers to hold a second convention on proportion in the United States (in collabora- tion with Philip Johnson and José Luis Sert, and with the institutional support of the Museum of Modern Art, CIAM, and the United Nations) did not materialize; nor was a volume with the proceedings of the first conference, to be edited by Zevi, ever published.50 The apparent "death-blow" to the postwar discussion of proportion was ostensibly staged in the 1957 vote on the "usefulness" of systems of proportion for "good design," called by Nikolaus Pevsner at the Royal Institute for British Architects and attended by Banham, the Smithsons, and Wittkower, among many others. As declared by Zevi afterward in an issue of Archi tet tura, "proportion was defeated" by a vote of sixty to forty-eight, which (the Italian critic failed to notice) is a proportionate ratio of five to four. 51 As if by wondrous coincidence, the "fourths" and "fifths" of Pythagoras's harmonic scale, which had originally marked the pinnacle of ancient and Renaissance theories of proportion, now heralded its official defeat. It may not be a coincidence, however, that the "final" renunciation of proportion in modernity occurred in England. In his Architectural Principles , Wittkower had blamed England and 18th century British empiricists, such as Edmund Burke, for overthrowing the "whole structure of classical aesthetics. . . from the bottom."52 Adhering to his humanist principles, Witt- kower never lost faith in the validity of proportional systems. In an article published in an issue of Daidalos edited by Gyorgy Kepes in 1960, Wittkower would still defend the appli- cability of proportion in contemporary architecture. Relying on the principles of Gestalt psychology and recent theories of symmetry by the Princeton mathematician Hermann Weyl, he reiterated the links between architectural proportion and the innate need for order in the human subject made evident by the symmetrical structure of the human body. 53 While phenomenologi - cally grounded in the body, the cosmic order invoked by Witt- kower was becoming increasingly imperceptible. After the second decade of the postwar era, cosmological notions continued to expand ecumenically across geographic regions, only to transform into atmospheric homologies among micro and macro scales that had little to do with geometry or numerical proportion. VISUAL HOMOLOGIES AND (INCOMMENSURABLE SCALES ( Enter Kepes ) A stable principle within the dynamic structure of epistemological revivals is that even when their influence is in decline, their traces in theory and practice never dis- appear, but rather continue to evolve.

Central in this theoretical shift was the faculty of vision and its agency in the perception of analogies. In one of the lectures at the 1951 Conference on Proportion, the Swiss author and theorist Adrien Turel proposed that all systems of proportion from the 16th to the 19th century were based on a method of micrometry, which was essentially a miniaturization of the anthropometric system established in antiquity by Euclid. However, after 1945, Turel argued, science had to abandon micrometry in favor of "nucleometry"- a new system of reference for the atomic age.54 What were the consequences of this nearly imperceptible system of reference? One might expect that this infinitesimal metric system would generate more rigorous standards of scientific precision; yet, on the con- trary, this same "nuclear" vision promoted a tendency towards ambiguity, atmospheric illusion, and ostensibly, liberation from corporeal proportion, measurement, and scale. Perhaps the most illustrative example of that cosmic vision is Kepes's well-known book The New Landscape in Art and Science , published in 1956 following an exhibition with the same title at M.I.T. in 1951 (coincidentally, the same year as the Milan Conference on Proportion).55 Filled with reproduc- tions of scientific imagery at every scale, Kepes's "picture book"56 served as a pictorial almanac of postwar visual culture, reminiscent of Saxl's catalogues of cosmological images from the Middle Ages. In fact, quotations of Medieval and Renais- sance iconography were not absent from Kepes's "new" landscape either. One of the final sections of the book contains a brief survey of "proportion, symmetry and module" from Francesco di Giorgio to Le Corbusier, 57 while a preceding section on mor- phology includes a series of cosmological images from earlier periods, including Botticelli's diagram of the universe from his illustrations for Dante's Divine Comedy , Copernicus's spherical diagram of the universe, and of course, Leonardo's Vitruvian figure.58 However, it is as if these Renaissance images function as allegorical mementos of their eminent futility. From this point forward, cosmological references were not based upon an idea of analogy between two contrasting entities separated by distance, but upon morphological resemblances among visually homological patterns, where distance and a host of other dis- tinctions become insubstantial. Relying on the latest technological advances in both microscopy and telescopy (including aerial and satellite photography), a number of postwar exhibitions and publications put on display the striking resemblances between molecular and planetary structures. Such micro and macro homologies span from the spherical analogies between organic patterns and man-made structures in London's Institute of Contemporary Arts Parallel of Life and Art exhibition (1953), to the connections between galaxies and living cells (mediated by the human body) demonstrated by the Eameses in their documentary Powers of Ten ( 1 968- 1 977 ) . 59 One could trace the origins of such cross - scale homologies in Laszlo Moholy-Nagy 's books for the Bauhaus in Germany and various publications in America, as well as in Kepes's Vision and Value book series, which demonstrated the visual equivalence between natural and man-made bodies at the most extreme of scales. For example, within the same section on "morphology in art and science" in The New Landscape (on a page immediately following the illustrations of Leonardo's Vitruvian man and other cosmological symbols), Kepes juxtaposes three images: a THE REAL PERSPECTfi 42</page><page sequence="14">121 Spyros Papapetros - Fig. 04 Illustrations from Gyorgy Kepes's The New Landscape (1956). spiral galactic nebula recorded by the 200 -inch Hale Telescope at the Mount Wilson and Palomar Observatories; an aerial photograph of a whirlpool in a Norwegian fjord taken by the U. S. Air Force; and a photograph of "chives," the miniscule tendrils of a climbing plant by Tet von Borsig60 (reminiscent of similar photographs by Karl Blossfeldt ) . 61 Despite their scalar discrepancies, all three images are visually related by virtue of the morphological similarity of their spiral pat- terns; the images are accompanied by a quote from The Restless Universe by the German quantum theorist Max Born. Fis* 04 Within the book's visual layout, the microcosmic element often overwhelms its macrocosmic counterpart. For example, a telescopic picture of a "galactic crab nebula" appears subordinate to a microscopic image of a "grasshopper spermatocyte" and an X-ray photograph of "zinc in fresh tomatoes."62 Other such nebulous correspondences occur nearer the surface of the earth, which in turn becomes a common threshold between micro and macro structures. In successive page spreads, Kepes visually rhymes the patterns of "earth cracks in the Boreo dessert" with the structure of a "cleared leaf,"63 or a "landscape of mud flats at low tide in France" with a detail of "the vascular system of a shark embryo."64 The skin of the earth, or the organic membrane of plants and marine animals, was once again (as in the archaic myths about the skin and orifices of the "first man" described by Saxl) the mediating surface on which cosmological relations were imprinted.

And in a finite, teeming world, things are re- peated and respond to each other. There are discernable cycles and symmetries, homologies and recurrences. Everything fits into one or several series. There is nothing that does not have its own counterpart or double, the cipher that recalls to our mind a certain premonition of it, or nostalgia for it."

As Charles Moore wrote in his article "Man, Cosmos, Symbol" in Kepes's The New Landscape , "man was once more in the world and the world was in man,"65 a reciprocal analogy that reiterates the Vitruvian dictum. But it was now the photographic image, and not the belief in metaphysical hierarchy and order, that made such cosmological relations possible. Is there, then, any relation between the micro- and macrocosmic models supported by Renaissance theories of pro- portion and Kepes's photographic, cross -scalar world alliances? If such a relation exists, it implies a methodological reversal. According to Wittkower, even during the Renaissance, the Vitruvian figure was becoming obsolete: figurative symbolism was gradually substituted by the abstract harmonies of the Pythagorean scale, and therefore numbers, rather than bodies, expressed the "generating (mathematical) principle in Microcosm and Macrocosm."66 Perhaps Kepes's modern almanac illustrates the reverse procedure. Within the modern quest for cosmological reference, proportion (in the simplified form of Le Corbusier's Modul or) coexisted with- and was eventually replaced by- visual analogies that recalled the Medieval correspondences of generalized resemblance. Microcosm and macrocosm once again communicated not within the abstract auditory intervals of Pythagoras's musical scale, but through the very loss of both interval and scale within a global landscape of vision. " El mundo es poco,"- the world is small- Columbus famously wrote in his diary in 1503. More than four centuries later, architects and historians heralded their own discovery of a new world by means of theory, photography, and design. The expansive magnification of optical data, however, also cor- responded to a conceptual shrinking or elementarizat ion of perception. Substance or scale no longer mattered as long as a common pattern was discernible. The macrocosmic connections between visually rhymed, yet radically dissimilar things were ultimately the signs of a homogenized cosmic landscape whose perceptible surface was being minimized to a limited repertory of recognizable forms.67 Once again, objects became cosmic entities, not because they established specific analogies with the world in terms of measurement or proportion, but precisely because they failed to do so. Like Kepes's photographic assem- blages of nebulous galaxies and vegetal tendrils, parts of the earthly landscape began to spiral out from their geopolitical signification and become the rudimentary appendages of an unreal universal scale. JOYOUS COSMOLOGIES ( Exit Gordon ) I begin to feel that the world is at once inside my head and outside it, and the two, inside and outside, begin to include or "cap" one another like an infinite series of concentric spheres. I am usually aware that everything I am sensing is also my body- that light, color, shape, sound, and texture are terms and proper- ties of the brain conferred upon the outside world. I am not looking at the world, I am not confronting it; I am knowing it by a continuous process of transform- ing it into myself, so that everything around me, the whole globe of space, no longer feels away from me but in the middle. 68 THE REAL PERSPECTfi 42</page><page sequence="16">123 Spyros Papapetros Next to the "concentric circles" surrounding the cosmic self in the introduction to The Joyous Cosmology by Alan Watts (a popular writer on the psychology of religion and experimen- tal drugs of the 1960s), there is a microphotograph of the concentric swirling patterns of a polished agate surface. Watts's small cosmological book and its psychedelic monologue (prefaced by former Harvard professor and drug guru Timothy Leary) is illustrated by a series of more than twenty micropho- tographs of organic and inorganic patterns in nature: from the eyes on the wings of Brazilian peacock butterflies and the leaf skeleton of the black poplar, to a spiral nebula or a platinum crystal magnified 750,000 times. While the last two images were also reproduced in Kepes's The New Landscape , for Watts, the same cross -scalar patterns represent less an external environ- ment than the inner workings of the human mind; swirling like smoke and rippling like "sunlight in shallow water," these microphotographs testify that within this chemically enhanced form of cosmic consciousness, "the pattern alone remains."69 Watts's slim volume can be found in the library of Matta-Clark, together with other cheap paperback classics of esoteric cosmology, such as P.D. Ouspensky's New Model of the Universe and Tertium Organum , both written in the earlier part of the century. 70 This bibliographic link returns us full-circle to the cosmological experiments, at both the micro and macro scale, of the self -proclaimed anarchi tect with whom this nar- rative began. Prior to the reenactments of Vitruvius in his film projects, Matta-Clark had experimented with studies of vegetal morphology in several sets of drawings dating from the early 1970s.71 Often filled with miniscule alchemical symbols, energy arrows, and other patterns, the artist's strangely radiating cacti, explosive shrubs, and rotating tree -branches offer a microscopic view of natural processes in terms of energy recy- cling.72 At times, these organic stems combine, intertwine, or invert: they create arches, streets, urban grids, or space stations, finally becoming scaleless, as they fluctuate between the micro (alchemical) and the macro (urban) cosmic scale. Two sets of drawings- high school sketches that were never exhibited or published- revolve around the same micro / macro theme and unite the beginning and the end of Matta- Clark's career (yet they are still considered to be outside the "main body" of his work). Filled with images of aliens, spaceships, and visions of planetary insemination, this set of colorful sketches is reminiscent of similar "space -fictions" in the paintings of Matta-Clark 's father, Roberto Matta. These juvenile exercises also bear an uncanny resemblance to Matta- Clark 's last known sketches, the so-called "cancer drawings" from 1978. In them, the artist envisions a series of inter- planetary battles between the immune and the infected cells of his body, which are depicted as satellites encircled by space- crafts and friendly missiles; the iconography is vaguely reminiscent of the intergalact ic battles in George Lucas's 1977 film Star Wars. But perhaps a more fitting tribute to the artist would be the final scene of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey from 1968, in which the film's space- and time - traveling Ulysses appears reborn as a planetary fetus, waltzing with the stars. One can only begin to imagine the multiple degrees of rotation in Matta-Clark's brief but stellar career, as it cin- ematically zooms in and out from the biological to the urban scale. Sometimes the rhythmic circles punctuating his life's trajectory appear as stations in a fanciful journey through space- time, and yet they also serve as monuments to a brutal confrontation with the real. - 69 Ibid., 61. 70 P.D.

Conveni enee , emulation , analogy (which includes proportion), and the pair of sympathy and antipathy represent four modes of cosmic correspondence that connect all parts of the world. Reminiscent of the microcosmic figure in Medieval imagery analyzed by Saxl, the human body acts, according to Foucault, as the "great fulcrum of proportions," a center upon which all cosmic vectors intersect.73 While Foucault suggested that the invention of a binary form of logic in the classical episteme of the 17th century prompted the dis- solution of the four similitudes, vestiges of a pre - classical mentality may have secretly survived in the art and architecture of the modern era. 74 Perhaps even the visually rhymed images in Kepes's The New Landscape capitalize on the evocative capacity of visual resemblance inherited by pre-modern similitudes, as well as an almost animistic belief in the performative capacity of patterns. While cosmological correspondences continue to inundate contemporary visual culture, their epistemological premises in the domain of art and architectural historiography have often been questioned on account of their methodologi- cal biases. Between the infinitesimal details of the microcosm and the impossibly large periphery of the macrocosm, there is a median domain, which, as some critics claim, cosmologically- inspired architects or historians tend to overlook. Such criti- cisms themselves, however, often overlook the fact that the true potency of cosmological relations lies precisely in the gap, and not in the similarity, between the micro and the macro scale. Such wide-ranging investigations across scales act as allegorical, yet highly active, fragments of a larger whole. Perhaps for similar reasons, cosmologically-minded architects or historians have also been criticized for their distance from the real, as well as for their allegedly escapist inclination toward a sense of order that is irrevocably lost in the modern world. However, Mat ta-Clark 's reenactments of the Vitruvian man in New York and Paris, coupled with the revival of proportion amidst the cry for global standardization in the postwar period, testify to the intricate connection of cos- mological research with major social and political transitions. Against a dominant view in architectural discourse of the past few decades (supported by a company of historians who, like Wittkower, lament the "rationalization" of proportion), one could argue that the revival of cosmological theories in architecture was not the consequence of a phenomenological nostalgia or abstract contemplation for a lawful version of the cosmos that no longer exists (and whose extinction coincides with the origins of Modernism), but rather, the revival signified an active reengagement with urgent sociopolitical realities throughout the world. In such terms, cosmology portends a reengagement with the world beyond the limits of its normative periphery, not the reaffirmation of an immutable spatial organization or world order. "In the end, we are all cosmologists," declared astronomer Neil Turok in a recent lecture on new ideas about the Big Bang; "even molecular biologists and particle physi- cists are cosmologists who study very small worlds."75 While THE REAL PERSPECTfi 42</page><page sequence="18">125 Spyros Papapetros Turok's statement refers to natural scientists, one wonders how the same definition could be applied to architects and archi- tectural historians across the spectrum of their specialized fields. Implicit in his assertion is the view that scale plays only a minor role in the study of a discipline; what primarily matters is the method of creating correspondences between disparate areas and reinventing their interrelations on a broader epistemological level. MICRO /MACRO: Following Turok, the core of cosmological investigations is perhaps neither in the actual micro nor the macro level, but in what lies between; that is, the slash (/)- the general sign that connotes a diagonal relationship between the two scales. It is precisely this diagonal line that allows the two symmetrical parts of that division to be exchanged, reversed, and (in the fashion of Mat ta-Clark 's Vitruvian per- formances) to rotate and become structurally inverted. Yet such rotations presuppose a certain equality of dimensions. As Saxl noted, the principle characteristic of the "first man" (and cosmological ancestor of the Vitruvian figure) was the equality between his height and width, the one-to-one ratio that allowed the human figure to be inscribed within both the circle and the square. Ultimately, the squares produced by that "primal scene" of modularization could start multiplying in the manner of an "infinite rapport" (to use a term from Alois Riegl) and create a crystalline field of diagonal rela- tionships . 76&gt;F'g- 05 The epistemological dia-grid of that modular surface is reminiscent of the function of what Roger Caillois would call " sciences diagonal e s ," diagonal sciences that (similar to Foucault's pre - classical similitudes) traverse multiple areas of knowledge and create a network of "adventur- ous coherences."77 Within this infinite system of reference, all cosmic correspondences recombine in the form of a mosaic, a chessboard of isomorphic patterns reproduced by the symmetri- cal inversion of their content, inside which the human figure gradually disappears, to be replaced by a fabric of relations. - Fig. 05 Composite image (by author).
