Ttibingen: Kerns Verlag, 2006, 313 pp. E39.95, paper. Gustav Riek completely dug out Vogelherd Cave in the Swabian Jura of southwestern Germany during only 10 weeks in 1931 -and he didn't screen! It is a very important site-mainly because of Riek's discovery of several small ivory figurines of lions, mammoths, horse, bison, and an anthropomorph in the Aurignacian strata. It is also now rather infamous for having yielded remains of anatomically modern humans, long believed also to belong to the Aurignacian but recently dated directly by AMS-14C to the Neolithic. And it supposedly had "late-surviving" mammoth remains in its Upper Magdalenian deposit-until they too were also directly dated ... to the Aurignacian. This book is a revised version of the author's doctoral dissertation at the Universitat Tiubingen. There is no doubt that it is an excellent, very well documented, clearly written, thoroughly referenced work, rescuing and making the best of a significant faunal assemblage that had never been completely studied. It contains several highly valuable generalizations and interesting observations, but always qualified by the significant stratigraphic, recovery (very small or burned bone fragments were not saved), and curational problems that characterized the excavation and the faunal record from this medium-size cave in the Danube tributary Lone Valley. A storied site (which I was fortunate to have visited with the late Kim Hahn), Vogelherd is part of the cluster of Lone and Ach sites that document intermittent human occupations of Baden -Wurttemberg during non-pleniglacial Mousterian, Aurignacian, Gravettian (not present at Vogelherd), and Magdalenian times, with representational art dating to ca. 35 kya in several sites. Following chapters on the site, taphonomy, and archeozoological methods, Niven presents the surviving record ofthe successive strata. It is clear that in Middle Paleolithic times Vogelherd was a locus of "time-sharing" between carnivores (including abundant cave and brown bears, in addition to hyenas, wolves, and lions) and Neandertals. The latter were minor elements, but they may have done some horse hunting. In contrast, the combined Aurignacian faunal assemblages are very large and contain proportionally fewer carnivore/bear remains and much more positive evidence for human hunting, butchering, and processing of horses and reindeer. These two species were treated rather differently, probably because of differences in their size and long-bone marrow content, affecting transport decisions. The site seems to have been occupied in summer or fall, for repeated hunting of these herd animals-either together or at separate times during the long series of repeated human occupations that formed the massive Aurignacian palimpsest deposits. There is a separate chapter on the rhino, other ungulate, carnivore, and small animal remains. The role of humans in procuring rhinos (mostly young and very young individuals) is ambiguous, since some may have been killed by the big carnivores. Rightly studied apart by Niven is the huge collection of mammoth remains (tusks, molars, and bones) from the Aurignacian. One of the most interesting chapters details Riek's unusual discovery of a mass of Journal ofAnthropological Research, vol. 64, 2008</page><page sequence="2">136 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH mammoth remains that may have been some kind of a structure, reminiscent of the famous open-air Upper Paleolithic mammoth "house" sites in Poland, Ukraine, etc. There are especially many cranial remains. The maximal mammoth MNI (based on molars) is an astounding 28 (adults, subadults, young, and juveniles). Niven argues that there is scarce evidence that humans used mammoths for food (only a few bones were brought to the cave in fresh state), but clear suggestions of scavenging for building and artifact raw material. The minor Magdalenian faunal assemblages are dominated by horse and reindeer-together with woolly rhino and (problematically) mammoth, plus some giant deer and cave bear (in need of direct dating). These levels represent the human reoccupation of this region after the (semi-) abandonment during the Last Glacial Maximum. Niven argues for a "surprising level of consistency (of) the Aurignacian remains" (p. 233). However one could wonder if some of this might not be the result of her having combined the collections from Riek's two thick (20-80 cm) Aurignacian cultural palimpsest strata (plus a third collection that was already merged in the repositories) and considerable mixing caused by the original cave occupants and by the excavation methods. The near-epiphenomenal role of Neandertals (compared with those ofbears and carnivores) as carcass-accumulation agents is very much in line with what we know from many sites, from Spain to Belgium. The repeated reuse of Vogelherd Cave by Aurignacian groups (who clearly invested in hearths, mammoth bone structures, and raw material caches, as well as in abundant "art") to hunt reindeer and horses on a regular, organized, seasonal, but probably fairly small-scale basis is as well documented as could be expected with these old, "challenged" collections. Some degree of human "aggregation" is fairly convincingly argued for, given the site's useful strategic location, although perhaps not the locus of redundant, larger-scale reindeer or horse slaughters as at such other German sites as Petersfels Cave or Gonnersdorf and Andernach in the Middle Rhine Valley. Nicely illustrated and containing abundant data tables and appendices, this is the definitive work on the fauna from a very important site, which was, unfortunately, excavated too early and probably not very carefully even by the standards of the time (Hugo Obermaier was screening at Altamira in the 1920s). The cave was used very differently by Neandertals and (presumed) anatomically more modern Aurignacian humans; whether this was because of inherent biological differences between the two (sub-) species or because of different human population densities and kinds of occupations of the region during various climatic phases of MIS 4 and 3 cannot be determined and remains a case example of one of "the big questions" in paleoanthropology.
