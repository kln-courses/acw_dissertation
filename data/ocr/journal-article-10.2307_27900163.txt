<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE CLASSIFICATION OF RELIGIONS. [CONCLUDED.] IV. According to their Usual Names, Locations, and Num bers of Adherents-Geographical and Statistical Method. THE last was the method of time. This is that of space. In this, religions are measured and compared accord ing to extent or quantity. At first thought, this is an ab surdity ; yet like all the others it may teach its lesson. Coupled with careful ethnological study, it is likely to be come of great importance. Its virtues do not lie in the way of teaching the quality or superiority of religions, as the argument of number is so often used. Numbers are never a mark of right and goodness, nor can they tell us the right way in the higher things of morals and religion. Notwithstanding this, they are always interesting, and they may be of inestimable use in showing how tendencies have carried themselves out, how principles have afifected men, by what sort of principles they have been moved, and to what extent; and these teachings coupled with a knowl edge of the circumstances in which the given peoples were placed and of the stage of their mental development when the principles became operative, may teach much concern ing the methods and laws of human progress. Moreover, maps and figures may show us the strength of principles, doctrines, and tendencies whose nature we already know ; and if we can procure good charts and fairly well authen</page><page sequence="2">96 THE MONIST. ticated enumerations of our own and former ages, we may obtain a vastly clearer and better impression of the march of these principles and doctrines through the world both in reference to space and time. To see plainly the con dition of things at various periods in time, is to grasp the process of the evolution and transformation of human ideas. Finally, I must say that such an attempt is in accord with the spirit and aim of the most advanced methods of teaching in history and physical science. It falls into line with those ideals which in these modern times have filled huge buildings with specimens of every sort ranging through the three kingdoms of nature-animal, vegetable, and mineral; which equip great institutions with every conceivable sort of mechanical device for illustrating the laws of the physical world; which spare no expense to establish bureaus of statistics and to report everything sup posed in any way to have a bearing in illustrating the con ditions and tendencies of nations; and which establish signal service stations and geographical institutes in which the changes in the kingdoms of the heavens above and the earth beneath may be accurately observed and duly repre sented by chart and statistics. i. GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION.-To completely pre sent to the eye the religious condition of the world through geographical relations one would need a series of "dis solving maps" representing the changes, transformations, and extensions of religions from the earliest dawn of the sentiment in human minds down to the present day. From lack of such a desideratum we shall have to extemporize what illustration is possible by means of maps of this and other periods. The means are exceedingly scarce and the periods chosen for illustration must consequently be few. (i) About 1880. For the geographical extension of the various principal religions at the present time I will</page><page sequence="3">THE CLASSIFICATION OF RELIGIONS. 97 refer to maps and tables in Meyer's Hand-Lexikon, II, p. 1611; Berghaus's Phys. Atlas, Abt. VII, iii. No. 63; and Droysen, Historischer H and-Atlas (last map). Accord ing to these best and latest reliable authorities which I am able to find, the extent of the various faiths may, with some limitations and modifications, be stated as follows: Shamanism, the highest development of the so-called savage religions, has chief possession of the mind in Africa between io degrees north and 20 degrees south of the Equator, in Northern Asia, Northern North America, and Central South America. Brahmanism (or better Hinduism) is now limited to the Aryans in Eastern and Southern Hindustan. Buddhism, in variously modified forms, extends from the middle of the Malacca Peninsula northward including Siam, Anani, Birmah, Nepal, Thibet, Kashmire, China, Mongolia, Corea, into many islands of the Pacific, espe cially Japan, Formosa, and the Philippine group, parts of other East India islands, the whole of Ceylon, a numerous following in Bactria, scattered representatives in Siberia, and some 107,500 votaries in south-Eastern Europe. Mohammedanism is territorially very wide spread and shows evidence of great vitality and activity at the pres ent time. Its control is well-nigh complete from Arabia eastward over Persia, Belloochistan, Afghanistan, East and West Turkestan, the Kirgis Steppe; and westward over Syria, Asia Minor, Turkey; the whole of Northern Africa including Egypt, Nubia, Tripoli, Fezzan, Tunis, Algeria, Morocco, the Sahara and Sudan regions; the East Coast including Somali, Galla, and Zanzibar; in the East Indies, Sumatra, Java, Borneo, Celebes, and the south half of Malacca; and a considerable representation in Hindus tan and Birmah. Christianity has three great divisions: Greek (or Ori ental), Roman Catholic, and Protestant.</page><page sequence="4">98 THE MONIST. Greek Christianity prevails almost entirely in Russia, Roumania, Montenegro, Servia, and Greece; to a consid erable extent also in Turkey, Hungary, Caucasia, Armenia, Siberia, and Abyssinia. Roman Catholicism has yet by far the widest sway. It is the all prevalent form in Austria, Italy, Spain, Portu gal, France, Bavaria, Baden, Alsace-Lorraine, Belgium; numbers about two-fifths in Holland and the German Em pire ; about one-half in Switzerland ; prevails again in Mex ico, Central America, Columbia, Equador, Venezuela, Guiana, Peru, Bolivia, Chili, Argentina, Uruguay, Para guay, Brazil, Hayti, the Spanish and French West Indies, the African islands in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans; numbers from 150 to 400 in every thousand inhabitants of Great Britain and Ireland, British America, United States, Australia, New Zealand, and Polynesia; and has scattering missions elsewhere. Protestantism, in some of its many varieties, is the chief faith in Great Britain, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Fin land; enumerates three-fifths in Germany and Holland; a little more than one-half in Switzerland, British Amer ica, Dutch and Danish West Indies; four-fifths in British West Indies, United States, and Greenland; more than half in British South Africa, Transvaal and Orange River Republic ; nearly one-third in Madagascar and Polynesia ; nearly seven-tenths in Australia; and very scantily suc cessful missions in parts of Asia and Africa (the most numerous not exceeding 7 converts to every 1000 inhabi tants of the region). (2) About 1500 A. D* For this and other past pe riods I have not been able to find published maps. Hence there was no choice but to extemporize the study. To do this roughly from historic data is not a very difficult * See also historic maps of the period.</page><page sequence="5">THE CLASSIFICATION OF RELIGIONS. 99 task. I have therefore made this sketch to show the re ligious condition of the world at some of the great epochs in religious history. We may say in general that at the year 1500 there was no Protestantism, America was un known to Europeans and belonged to the Indians, Moham medanism had reached its arm into south-Eastern Europe but had not pushed far southward into Africa nor far eastward into Asia, while the Orient was scarcely known, though its conditions were then nearly what they are now. We may sum up the distribution in general thus: Romish Christianity occupied Europe west of Russia, Turkey and Greece. Greek Christianity covered South-western Russia, parts of Turkey, Greece, Asia Minor, Northern Egypt, and Abyssinia. Mohammedanism had just been expelled from Spain, and now ruled the north coast of Africa, Arabia, Persia, Asia Minor, parts of Turkey, scattering peoples to the east of the Caspian Sea, and to a considerable extent into North ern India. A Modified Brahmanism took the place of the ancient faith in the unsubjugated parts of Aryan India, while Bud dhism had for a couple of centuries been expelled. Buddhism itself had spread everywhere east and north into Farther India, Thibet, China, Corea, and Japan. Of the rest of the world,-America, Africa, Australia, and Polynesia,-we can only conjecture from their later character and the fact that their ideas in all the fields of civilization wrere very slow to move. (3) About A. D. This marks another of those great epochs in which transformations begin. We have a very different religious world to picture to ourselves. There was as yet no Christianity, no Mohammedanism, and Bud</page><page sequence="6">IOO THE MONIST. dhism had not traveled to Thibet, China, or Japan. Then too, many of the old faiths were still living. Judaism was limited to the little Roman colony of Pal estine. Zeus and Jupiter were yet reigning, but with enfeebled power in Greece and Italy. Odin and Thor inspired and checked the fierce hordes of Teutons north of the Alps. The Celtic Druids managed the faith of the Britons. Osiris and Isis were sinking into oblivion in Egypt Ahur a Mazda, although temporarily weakened by as saults from the West, yet commanded the reverence of most Persian hearts. Buddhism had won the ascendency in India from Pun jab to Ceylon. Confucianism held well-nigh unmolested sway in China. Of the rest of the world we know nothing, except what archaeology is beginning to reveal. (4)About 400-500 B. C. Here we stand on the thresh old of one of the greatest epochs in history. Mighty changes were soon to be effected in various parts of the world. New tendencies of mind and morals are being born, and the political face of the world is putting on new aspects. The center of political power is in the Medo Persian Empire, which is now at its height. Greece too has reached the acme of its glory and receives an irre coverable blow from the monarch of the East. The Roman Republic (yet very small) has just started on its stormy and brilliant career. The Jews have been carried into captivity. Babylon and Nineveh are falling. Socrates (470-399), Buddha (560-480), and Confucius (550-478) are now living and have begun to turn out the past and usher in the future. Surely change on a great scale was taking place in men's spirits when in three such widely</page><page sequence="7">THE CLASSIFICATION OF RELIGIONS. lOI sundered regions as China, India, and Greece, the con ditions had become such that minds like these could and must be developed. Two things are suggested. First, the religious notions of the past were so old as to be worn out. Then again, the nature conditions of the past had reached a stage where higher moral ground was possible, was necessary. In these great personalities we have the mouth-pieces of the higher things ready to be spoken in those lands. Here were crises of opportunities which floated men into eternal fame. In other lands, before and since, has the like occurred. In Persia, ages before this the old religion died and the new was spoken by Zara thustra. In Palestine ages later the old formalistic Juda ism was to be set away into obscurity by the living prac tical moral gospel of Jesus. In Arabia, after still farther ages, the old nature worship and animism was to be re placed through Mohammed by the call to Islam (Salva tion) and the worship of Allah alone. 2. Statistics.-The enumeration or estimate of the num ber of adherents to the various religions is a work as yet beset with insuperable difficulties. In the first place, there is no reliable census taken among more than half the peo ples of the globe. Of the 1540 millions estimated to bo living at present, only 700 millions may be considered as counted fairly well. A people must have reached a very high social stage of civilization before the census sense becomes operative, and some of those who would be sup posed from their development otherwise to have an interest in knowing their numbers, etc., seem to have none. When besides the so-called savage and barbarous world, which includes the natives of America, Polynesia, Australia, most of Africa, and Northern Asia, is added the indifference of many of the civilized nations, the difficulty begins to show its greatness. As an illustration or two of the latter, I might remark that the population of Constantinople is</page><page sequence="8">I02 THE MONIST. not known, and the census of Cuba has never been carefully taken. Then as to the question of making estimates, there are double and triple uncertainties. First, in many of these uncounted regions the population is so changeable from time to time as to defy even respectable estimates. The nomadic and emigrating tendencies of many peoples are things hard to take into consideration. They are in this way liable to be counted twice or not to be counted at all. This is further increased by the wide-spread practice of kidnapping slaves and wives. Other factors, are the great variations of populations produced by unequal birth rates. Professor Ratzel of Leipsic cites the case of a single small village in Bavaria of which he examined the baptismal records for a period covering some 250 years, and found variations in the number of births from 170 to 38 for dif ferent decades with an almost invariable village popula tion. Many examinations of this kind go to show that increase of populations, among other things, depends much on the outlook of the people. Besides this to-a-large extent-unconsciously sterile or prolific tendency, there are the facts of infanticide and suicide, both of which prevail at times to an unbelievable extent among some nations. Again, there are various races, which through contact with higher civilizations and from other causes, are in a state of constant decline in numbers. Some have already died out entirely (Tasmanians, etc.) ; others are fast de creasing (Indians, Maori, etc.). And lastly, three of the mightiest factors having to do with this uncertainty and variation in the world's population, are famine, pestilence, and war. In some lands and at some times the proportion is very greatly disturbed by these. Happer, an English writer on the Chinese, tells of 63,000,000 having perished by hunger since 1812. And some one (Meadows I think) says that 30,000,000 Chinese perished in a single rebellion.</page><page sequence="9">THE CLASSIFICATION OF RELIGIONS. IO3 In India the populations of certain regions are occasionally terribly reduced by either famine or cholera. War not infrequently decimates the male population and seriously disturbs the naturally balanced numerical relations of the sexes. These factors put together go to show that there might be such a science as the pathology of population. When to all these difficulties in the formation of esti mates of the numbers living either now or in the past, is added the variations in the actual estimates made by trav elers and investigators, the case begins to look like a hope less one. How great this confusion may threaten to be, may be better appreciated if I state, that the population of China has during recent years been variously calculated from 150 to 450 millions. The most reliable figures, how ever, range between 370 and 420 millions, the latter being the sum given by Tseng, a Chinese statistician. (In A. D. 57 China had 21 millions.) But to come closer to the question of calculating the votaries of the difiierent faiths of the world, it must be observed that the problem would be far from solved even if we could count the peoples of the various lands, though enumeration on the best approximation of these is the only result yet or perhaps ever possible. Statistics of religion in general can do no more than collect the aggregates of population in various lands and divide the sums among the faiths supposed to predominate in those various re gions. But this is almost the loosest sort of generaliza tion, and has no solider basis than the assumption that peoples living under the same general environment and in the regions where certain doctrines have been extensively preached, must have the same religious outlook. The as sumption has some truth on its side. Such peoples must necessarily have more in common and possess a greater similarity of theory and practice than those who are widely separated and who are surrounded by very different cir</page><page sequence="10">i04 THE MONIST. cumstances of life. Yet this assumption and method, with out qualification, leave no room for the play of individual ity. Though the intelligent thinking Chinaman is far nearer the religious point of view of Buddhism than he is of Protestant Christianity, and though the scientifically in clined European or American is probably more in sympathy with the latter than he is with the former, yet it is straining the category of either name to class such men with the mass of their countrymen who subscribe to these confes sions and their ordinances. And this class of non-con formists in all civilized countries, though never conspicuous or exactly ascertainable, must be somewhat numerous, the more so in proportion to the liberty and intelligence of the people. Hence when it is stated that the number of Chris tians or Buddhists is so and so, we perceive the necessity of discounting the estimate to a considerable extent from this reason alone. I should remark in passing, that the in accuracy of religious statistics in failing to represent the individualism and independence of many, may be and is in part remedied in what we term sectarian statistics. Yet this can never appear in those general estimates of the religions of the world, and consequently our cautions re main in full force. We must further make the perhaps yet greater deduction of that multitude of indifferent per sons to be found everywhere. Almost every neighborhood numbers its scores who give little or no attention to the question of religion in any of the usual senses. These two classes in the aggregate seriously diminish the accuracy of our customary estimates. Nevertheless we must make them as best we can, and learn from them what we may. The most remarkable interest in the scientific study of religions and of religion was manifest in the period between the later 70's and the early go's of the nineteenth century. The labors accomplished by Max M ller, Rhys Davids, Tiele, Sayce, Bournouf, Kuenen, Whitney, Spencer, Pflei</page><page sequence="11">THE CLASSIFICATION OF RELIGIONS. derer, Brinton, R ville, Johnson, Carns, and their many co workers, began another epoch in religious history. The influence of this work brought about the World's Congress of Religions at Chicago in 1893; and its continuation in a hundred ways is steadily modifying the religious outlook, not only of Christendom but of the peoples who have for centuries held to the other historic faiths. ( i ) T. W* Rhys Davids, the eminent English Oriental scholar and authority on Buddhism, gives the population of the world and of the various religions as follows.

The official estimate of the Turkish government gives the total number of Mohammedans in the world as 176</page><page sequence="14">io8 THE MONIST. 000,000 for about the year 1900; while Mr. Mann in the North American Review, 1900, increases the sum to 200 3i3&gt;845 This result I have used in another way to make an object lesson. If a surface be laid out with 38%o units on each side, it will contain 145^0 square units. By using different colors and coloring as many squares as each religion has millions of adherents, their comparative fol lowings may be strikingly perceived at a glance. C. CLASSIFICATIONS BASED ON PHILOSOPHIES OF RELIGION. SUBJECTIVE. I. Professor Pfleiderer of Berlin, in a work entitled: Die Religion, ihr Wesen and ihre Geschichte (2 B nde, 1869), developed a division of which he said: "Wir hoffen, dass diese Einleitung der Religionen berhaupt und der heidnischen insbesondere sich durch die Verbindung ge schichtlicher Treue mit begrifflicher Sch rfe von selbst empfehlen, und dass sie auch vor der strengsten Kritik jener Empiriker, welche gegen jedwede begriffliche Sche matisirung stets misstrauisch sind, standhalten werde." (II, p. 60.) He bases it on an attempted psychological analysis of the fundamental principles of religion, the ground basis of piety. Here is to be sought the one un derived reality to which all else is accidental. The reason that previous divisions have proved untenable is, according to Pfleiderer s mind, that they have been based on secon dary phenomena instead of being founded in the essence of religion itself. In such divisions there are always cer tain points which will not stand the pressure of the facts. But he says : "Die Leichtigkeit hingegen, mit welcher hier der geschichtliche Stoff sich subsumirt unter den begriff lichen Schematismus, ist ein Beweis f r die Richtigkeit des Eintheilungsprinzips, also schliesslich noch ein Beweis f r die richtige Fassung des Begriffs der Religion, wei</page><page sequence="15">THE CLASSIFICATION OF RELIGIONS. IO9 chem das Eintheilungsprinzip entnommen wurde." Here is confidence enough. It should indeed be an excellent theory to warrant so much. We will look at it and hear its later fate. (See Chart.) In the first place, its geneology must be observed. It will be remembered from the discussion upon the psycho logical origin of the religious nature,* that Schleiermacher founded it in feeling and made its essence to consist of a sense of absolute dependence, and that Hegel laid its basis wholly in thought and found its essence to be sense of free dom, the more unlimited and the higher it rose the more religious. Both theories were paraded to excess by their respective followers, and received the hardest criticism from the other side and from outsiders. Indeed, one may almost say that the history of these views constitutes the history of religious philosophical discussion during the last' fifty to seventy-five years, especially in Germany. It became more and more manifest ( except to the most blinded parti sans) that neither view was able to hold the ground. A new theory or a compromise was the only resort. The former was out of the question on any of the old bases. Kant had preempted the will, Schleiermacher the feeling, and Hegel the intellect, each severally as the ground for his structure. There was no other region known, and there happened to be no passion for discovery at that time. In this embarrassment Professor Pfleiderer (then at Tii bingen) came forward with a theory compromising be tween the views of Schleiermacher and Hegel. He admits the ground claims of both, but will have none of the ex clusiveness of either. Neither is complete alone, nor are they sufficient by adding them together in a mere com promise. They must be melted together, must be blended into a perfect unity, a unity of such a peculiar type that neither looses its essential character, while each mutually * See How Religion arises-A Psychological Study, by Duren J.

Such a work were</page><page sequence="17">THE CLASSIFICATION OF RELIGIONS. III as really a discovery as the development of the onesided views which it wrought into a higher view. He lays out the ground somewhat as follows: "Das Wesen des frommen Selbstbewusstseins an und f r sich" is the only factor conceivable for a sharp or exact division. In this he finds two constituting moments: freedom and dependence. In and for themselves each claims full and unlimited sway. Hence arises conflict and struggle be tween them. The various relations growing out of these two moments of religious life form a comprehensible and sharply fixed basis of division. If in a religion one is pre dominant we see its essential characteristic, and so if the other; but if we see them standing in an equilibrium of validity, we recognize the approach to the perfect. Their unequal coexistence will be found to be the common char acteristic of the heathen religions, while their greater bal ance is the chief mark of the monotheisms. These mono theisms again are divisible on the ground as to whether the two elements only relatively have their rights recog nized, or whether this mutually recognized right becomes a completely blended realization. Christianity represents the latter, Judaism and Islam the former. In Christianity is the fullest freedom reached only when the fullest de pendence is realized. (See 2 Cor. iii. 17, also Luke ix. 24.) Judaism and Mohammedanism hold to both of these ele ments, but in such a way as to resemble two poles which though inseparable yet stand over against each other in op position. In these religions man feels himself free and also dependent, but the two are not so blended that he finds his freedom in his dependence, and at the same time the satis faction of his own will in the service of God. In them the one moment leaves off" when and where the other be gins. Not so in Heathenism. Sometimes an overpowering sense of dependence, sometimes an unlimited notion of free</page><page sequence="18">112 THE MONIST. dom are the characterizing elements. Never are both rec ognized, never do they stand in equipoise, never do they blend in pious experience. Both being indestructible ele ments, neither is ever wholly lost, and even in greatest subjection, the unrecognized factor reacts with what weak powers it has left. Yet when vigorous reaction comes, it too is just as onesided. In the heathen mind these elements are so unbalanced that they do not stand as in Judaism merely out of and beside each other, but stand in a relation of opposition, of againstness, or of contradiction to each other. In this opposed way each is false from the other's point of view. One of the two chief tendencies will be taken by the religious mind on the stage of pure nature. Either man gives himself up entirely to his dependent sense, regards himself as on all sides determined and at the disposal of the Divine All-life, in which case the nat ural will seeks by the satisfaction of the natural im pulses to compensate itself all the more because of this resignation. This accounts for the mixture of resigned self-sacrifice (asceticism) and gross sensuality in the pan theistic nature religions. On the other hand, man realizes his dependence little, an overflowing fulness of life gives an overpowering feeling of freedom from the control of the finite and limited gods of nature. He is, to be sure, in a measure dependent on them, since he prays for their help ; but at the same time he thinks to compel them into his service through the craft or force of his magic and divine exorcisms. The real feeling of dependence now reacts in the fear of an unconditioned might standing yet higher than the gods, a blind necessity or fate. This is everywhere at the back of polytheism, hard and oppressive in proportion as the gods are believed to be limited. In the stage of development which precedes what we term the beginning of civilization, this contrast of freedom and dependence is at its strongest. With the entrance of a</page><page sequence="19">THE CLASSIFICATION OF RELIGIONS. 113 higher social condition in the taking on of family and civic relations this sharp division is toned down somewhat. The individual begins, by the suggestions and incentives which these impose upon him, to recognize himself as belonging to a law-ordered whole. The sensuous will of man is re strained by custom and law till he feels his dependence on society, but at the same time he is lifted into a higher free dom in that to his previously selfish interest there is given now the greater content of a more universal aim, or inter est. This filling out of the sense of freedom with moral content and the drawing of the sense of dependence toward moral powers (deities) gradually destroys the conflict be tween them. The Greeks or Romans who had received this moral and civic culture no longer feared that blind fate above the gods; but fate became to them gradually more and more the rational will of a Zeus who was the bearer of the natural world-order, or of a Jupiter Capito linus who was the supporter of the Roman idea of the State. On the other hand, the cultured Chinaman, who before had been borne down by a stupid resignation to his complete dependence on the irrational life of nature, felt this no longer in the former way ; but as the notion of hies State-relations took hold on his life, his dependence rec ognized itself as leaning on an essentially rational whole. In both examples, however, the moral and civic relations are imperfect, their powers of influence are only relatively universal, hence the will in dependence on them does not arrive to a perfect freedom, i. e., the two do not become inwardly fully reconciled to each other. A third stage to be noticed in the cultivated nature religion, he calls the supernatural. This is where the deified powers are no longer the natural powers merely. A fundamental breach is made with nature, yet not to the extent that a positive supernatural world is attained, nor to the denial of all the old nature powers. There is spirit worship of the higher</page><page sequence="20">114 THE MONIST. sort along with many elements of nature-religion. Of this sort are Brahmanism and Buddhism on the one side, and Zarathustrianism on the other. Both have escaped the limits of the finite, in nature as well as the State, and are consequently to be distinguished from the previous stages. They form indeed a sort of pre-stage to a mono theistic religion. There is yet between them a contrasted onesidedness : since in the Indian religions the false de pendence on the finite is broken by the release from sen suous self-torture (in Buddhism also of mental) without attaining to a positive freedom in the infinite ; while in the Persian, though the freedom is placed as the absolute aim of divine things, yet it never reaches to the abolition of a dependence on the ungodly. The remnants of a former naturalism yet remain in its strong dualism. * * * Complete and invulnerable as the author's enthusiasm led him to boast his theory and classification to be, it was not complete enough to win his own assent a few years later. He has re-written the whole topic a couple of times since, and has finally himself abandoned the theory which was to have resisted the strongest criticism of opposing schools through its "combination of historical fidelity and exactness of comprehension." In his more recent work, Religionsphilosophie auf geschichtlicher Grundlage, he pro poses another theory and a different basis of division. According to the view being here developed, he is as much at fault for abandoning this division as he was at first for making it and supposing it to be final. One would have to abandon each latest view on the same ground and in the same way, if he lived and remained as fertile and progres sive minded as heretofore. The difficulty lies not so much in the great faultiness of the classification principle, but in supposing it could do the work of other classifica</page><page sequence="21">THE CLASSIFICATION OF RELIGIONS. 115 tions. For its legitimate purposes it is most excellent. One cannot look upon it carefully without being impressed with the amount of truth that it teaches. Like the other attempts which we have looked at, it has its importance. It is no fault of a theory that it is misused, or that un reasonable confidence is placed in it or immodest claims made for it. Our theories would often serve us better than they do, if we could estimate them for what they are : not finalities, but theories, working hypotheses, points of view, means of insight, etc. It is a very poor one indeed that is not of some service; it is a most excellent one indeed that does not soon run us into errors, extravagances, and dangers, if we push its application. The way in which Professor Pfleiderer applied this theory to the various religions would seem to indicate, whether he intended it or not, that he regarded religion as a projected morality. Observe especially the remarks about the cultured Greek, Roman, and Chinaman. To do this would be to limit it in actual fact to morality, when we undeceive ourselves as to the source of the projected objects of worship and of our relationships. Our only excuse for longer letting our moral conceptions take such objectified form would be, that it added a greater glow of enthusiasm and romance to our actual moral relations to think them in such a manner, or that it were best for the common folk to have this sort of supernatural outlook. Again the chief or pivotal terms of the division, free dom and dependence, are not used throughout in the same sense, as will be seen by a thoughtful examination. At the start they are the fundamental elements of all pious feeling, but later it would seem that one or the other had, in his mind (especially the sense of freedom), become the all-absorbing, all-worthy element. On this, witness his discrimination regarding the Persian religion, where the</page><page sequence="22">II6 THE MONIST. sense of dependence is indicated as though belonging to the character of mind which debases itself before demons. The position in the plan to which he assigns both Bud dhism and Islam are entirely wrong in my opinion. The prominent characteristics of the former place it under free dom, those of the latter assign it to the side of dependence. Another remark should be passed, viz., that we would be led by this theory to place too high an estimate on aver age Christianity; since, except in the very highest cases, has there neither in Christianity, Judaism, or Moham medanism ever been more than a practical adjustment or compromise between these two fundamental elements. Such a consummation were devoutly to be wished, and such a classification or analysis would have inestimable value if its calling attention to these relations aided in any way so practical an end. One can scarcely doubt that here is an attempted expression of one of the deepest features and relations of the religious life, and though its full and satis factory explanation may yet be unaccomplished, we become convinced that it has in it a profound reality. D. CLASSIFICATIONS BASED ON RACIAL RELATIONSHIP. GENEALOGICAL. I. According to Linguistic Affinity. Prof. Max M ller (Introd. to the Science of Religion, p. 143 ff.) says: "The only scientific and truly genetic classification of religions is the same as the classification of languages. Particularly in the early history of the human intellect, there exists the most intimate relationship between language, religion, and nationality." The out ward appearance, tangibility, or framework of religion in early times, that by which it was communicable from heart to heart, centered around a few words and expressions pertaining to deity, sacrifice, altar, prayer, possibly body,</page><page sequence="23">THE CLASSIFICATION OF RELIGIONS. 117 soul, virtue, sin. "Early religion and early language are most intimately connected, religion depending entirely for its outward expression on the more or less adequate resources of language." To understand this clearly, is to arrive at a basis for the most useful classification of religions. Whatever genetic relationships exist between languages "ought to hold together the religions of the world, at least the most ancient religions." In Asia, with its most important peninsula Europe, we have three families of languages: Turanian, Semitic, and Aryan. In each of these (especially the first two) the growth of language became arrested, i. e., ceased to be natural, and through religious and political influences be came permanent and solidified. With this petrifaction of language into historical speech went on a like petri faction of religion into the three great independent settle ments. The character of the latter is in great measure determined by that of the former, or at least is found to be of similar analogy. Of Turanian languages, Chinese is the oldest repre sentative. If we look into its early forms we get light on this early family of religions. Accompanying the prosy speech of China we find an ancient colorless and unpoetical religion, one which might, after the manner of the lan guage, also be called monosyllabic. Its deities are a host of independent spirits, having in the worshiper's mind little mutual interrelationship. They are evidently per sonifications of the heavens, sun, storms, mountains, rivers, etc. Beside these stands the worship of ancestral spirits and those of the more recently departed who are believed to be lookers-on of human affairs and to be exercising their powers for good or evil. This old form of faith, a double worship of human and natural spirits, lives on even yet among the lower ranks, though at least since the time of</page><page sequence="24">II8 THE MONIST. Confucius it has been superseded in the upper stratum of intelligence. Among Semitic races the names of deities clearly mark off their religions as characteristic, though indeed in lan guage, literature, and general civilization they are so dif ferent from each other and from themselves at different times. Yet running through the polytheisms of Babylon, Phoenicia, and Carthage, as well as the monotheisms of Jews, Christians, and Mohammedans, there runs the same great dominant characteristic notion of God in History, God mingling in and ruling over the affairs of men as individuals, races, and nations, as contrasted with the characteristic of God in nature. The tendency of the peoples has been to lay the stress of life on social organi zation and moral relationships ; hence as we might expect, Semitic deities in general bear names expressive of moral qualities : the Strong, the Exalted, the Lord, the King, etc. Generally, too, the anthropomorphism is not strong nor the dramatic activity prominent. Hence their tendency to monotheism, aided by the external circumstance of mo notonous desert life. And thirdly the Aryans, though now scattered by ex tended enterprise to all parts of the globe, are a family easily recognized by the roots of their language. Through the names of their gods also they show an original oneness of religion. Professor M ller denies the oft-repeated re mark that their worship may be characterized as a wor ship of nature, and says, "if it had to be characterized by one word, I should venture to call it a worship of God in Nature, of God as appearing behind the gorgeous veil of Nature, rather than as hidden behind the veil of the sanc tuary of the human heart. The gods of the Aryans assume an individuality so strongly marked and permanent, that with the Aryans a transition to monotheism required a</page><page sequence="25">THE CLASSIFICATION OF RELIGIONS. II powerful struggle, and seldom took effect without icono clastic revolutions or philosophical despair." * * * Here are three types of religion accompanying three types of language and race, the formation and settlement of which into these special features have and will for all future time determine the fate of the whole human race. The three unities which at some remote past epoch these peoples formed, have in course of time through increase of numbers and other circumstances disintegrated into what might seem a chaos of peoples, tongues, and relig ions. Yet it was not a chaos, for out of this seemingly inextricable confusion of dialects and variety of races our modern science has been able to assert the original unity and restore the principal former characteristics. (As yet the case with regard to the Turanians is somewhat doubt ful.) Professor M ller makes reference to an African and an American family of races, languages, and religions which long ago broke up into various divisions without devel oping literature or settled speech, and hence their relation ships are a vastly more difficult study. At the time in which he was speaking there was little to be gained from them in the way of support for his general view. *K *fc ^ The case of Aryan unity he develops at some length giving substantially the same reasons that I have done in another place relying principally on the authority of Pictet. (See "The Primeval Aryans, etc.") He cites the names of their principal deities, calls attention to their terms expressive of the most essential elements of religion, as prayer, sacrifice, altar, spirit, law, faith, etc. He also mentions such cases as the terms for house, town, king, etc.</page><page sequence="26">I20 THE MONIST. The comparison of the Semitic family of languages is carried out with more completeness. Here the relation is closer, the sub-races have never been so scattered, their intercourse has been more frequent, and hence their lin guistic and religious relationships are more manifest. So manifest indeed is the former, that no Semitic scholar has ever thought it to be worth his while to carry out such a comparative study of their likenesses as Pictet and others have done within the Aryan family. Nor has there ever been wrrought out a comparative grammar of the Semitic languages, like that of Bopp's, e. g., on the Aryan. By the same process of comparison which has been so success fully carried on in the Aryan group could we here still easier reconstruct the primeval Semitic civilization and religion. (A noble work yet to be executed by some earnest progressive-minded Semitic scholar who might tell us how this race lived and what they believed and thought before Hebrew was Hebrew, and before there was any Syriac, Aramaic, Arabic, Ethiopie, Phoenician, or Babylonian speeches. ) The evidence of the pre-historic oneness of the Semites drawn from the names of the deities is unusually strong. This similarity of appellation and its meaning points to the fact that there must have been a time when they as well as the Aryans decided as one people upon certain names for their gods, and nothing is more evident than the fact that this period preceded the special development into the separate languages and individual religions. The root El (meaning Strong) tells a great history with regard to this race. In Babylonian inscriptions we find it in Hu (God), as well as in Bab-il (the gate or temple of II). Among the Hebrews we have it in Beth-el (house of God), and in ha-El, preceded by the article (the Strong, the God, i. e., Jehovah). The Phoenicians in Byblus (Jebel) worshiped El, the son of Heaven and earth. His grand</page><page sequence="27">THE CLASSIFICATION OF RELIGIONS. 121 father Elium, the most high God, was killed by wild ani mals, and his father dethroned, and finally slain by him self. Philo identifies this god El with the Greek Kronos, and represents him as the presiding deity of the planet Saturn. This same El is the presiding deity of this planet according to Diodorus Siculus. And the Himyritic in scriptions in Southern Arabia also contain it. The Hebrew Eloah (plural Elohim) is the same word as the Arabic Uah (God), which without the article means god in gen eral, and with the article, Al-il h or All h, it is the God of the Koran. Again it appears in the Arabic in the fem inine All t to whom a famous temple at T f was dedicated ; and this All t of the Koran (whose temple was destroyed by Mohammed's command) is doubtless the one mentioned by Herodotus (iii, 8). The word Baal or Bel is another name of deity common to most of the Semitic peoples. Assyrians, Babylonians, Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Moabites, Philistines, and Jews all worshiped this deity as a great or as the supreme God. This points to their earlier unity as a race and to his greatness as a god. Later through local worship we hear of many Baals (Baalim collectively and with special names singly): Baal-tsur (of Tyre), Baal-tsidon (of Si don), Baal-tars (of Tarsus), Baal-berith (of Shechem, god of treaties, Judg. viii. 33; ix. 4), Baal-zebub (of the Philistines at Ekron, 2 Kings i. 2, 3, 16), Baal-peor (of the Moabites and Jews, Numb, xxv), and Baal-Sh may m (on Phoenician coins). The last named is the Beelsam n which Philo speaks of as the Phoenician sun-god, thus: "When the heat became oppressive the ancient races of Phoenicia lifted their hands heavenward to the sun. For him they considered the only God, the lord of heaven, cal ling him Beelsam n, which with the Phoenicians is lord of heaven, and with the Greeks Zeus." The Ashtoreth mentioned in the Old Testament and</page><page sequence="28">122 THE MONIST. worshiped by the Jews (i Kings xi. 5; Judg. iii. 12), the Ishtar of the Babylonians mentioned in inscriptions and in the famous epic (Geo. Smith, Chaldean Account of Gen esis), the Ashtar of the Moabite stone, and the Astarte of the Syrians, are one and the same goddess. Traces of this goddess and her consort are also found in the Himya ritic kingdom, as in Athtar. The Hebrew Melech ; the Moloch of Carthage, Crete, Rhodes, and the valley of Hinnom ; the Milcom of the Am monites (who had a sanctuary in Mt. Olivet) ; and the A dram melech and Anammelech of the Sepharvites (to whom, according to 2 Kings xvii. 31, they burned their children in sacrifice), are local varieties of an early Sem itic deity. The Old Testament Adon i (my lord) applied only to Jehovah, was in Phoenicia the very name of the Supreme Deity. This personage, as is well known, was adopted into the Greek mythology, and became transformed into the beautiful young Adonis, loved by Aphrodite, and killed by the wild boar of Ares. Yet other names are mentioned besides these. Alto gether the case is an unusually strong one from this class of words alone, that the Semitic religions belonged to gether geneologically as a class on the same basis that their language in other ways relate them as peoples of the same race. The period when they were one people with one language and one religion far antedates historic times, yet, as in the case of the Aryans, it is none the less certain; and should the work be undertaken by a scholar competent for the task, I doubt not that a much better reconstruction of primeval Semitic civilization and religion might be effected than has been done in the former case. On the Turanian ground the way is less sure. The subject is exceedingly difficult, because it has been com paratively little investigated. The languages of the Chi</page><page sequence="29">THE CLASSIFICATION OF RELIGIONS. 123 nese, Mandshus, Northern Mongolian, Tartars, Finns, etc. have as yet been very little a subject of scientific study. However, with such evidence as may be obtained, the mat ter of proving a linguistic relationship as a basis for a relationship of religions is attempted. M ller's method of proof is faulty here in that he calls to his aid the simi larity in the religions which he would, as proposed at first, prove by linguistic relations alone. Nevertheless the case is not so badly blemished as to make the investigation worthless, since they do actually assist each other much. In the cases of the Aryans and Semites we knew more of their languages at start than we did of their religions, and hence our knowledge of the former very naturally proved a great help toward a better understanding of the latter besides showing their geneological connections. But with the Turanians, we are better acquainted at the outset with their religious notions than with the family relation ship of their tongues. Hence very naturally the racial unity which the similarity of their religions points to is aided but not absolutely proved by the investigation of the leading religious terms. In the background of all Tura nian religions are certain fundamental ideas which have a closer resemblance even at first glance than any of these have with other faiths. With all of them there goes a nature worship of a sort peculiar to the group. A few comparisons and terms will show what basis there is for the attempt. In the Shu-king (one of the most ancient sacred books of China) heaven and earth are the father and mother of all things. In the ancient poetry, Heaven alone is both father and mother. The heaven-spirit is called Tien, and is ever used as the name of the supreme deity, i. e., he is the Chinese Jupiter or Allah. The word means the Great One, and in Chinese characters is compounded of two signs: *k (ta) meaning "great" and - (yih) meaning</page><page sequence="30">124 THE MONIST. "one," Ji (ta-yih or Tien). The Peerless, the Great, the High, the Exalted, the One, stands above all else. It is personified as the ancestor of all things, as the framer, as having decrees and will, as sending sages to teach the people, as knowing men's hearts, and as comforting them. This was the solace of Confucius when he desponded be cause men would not hear him: "Heaven knows me." With the other multitude of nature spirits believed in by the common people, the sages had little to do. "Respect the gods, and keep them at a distance," was a remark of Confucius when pressed by his disciples regarding the bearing of a wise man toward them. These gods were spirits of the sun, moon, stars, earth, mountains, rivers, and ancestors of the people. Putting beside these facts the less complete and prob ably less trustworthy accounts of travelers from Central and Northern Asia, we recognize some striking coinci dences. "Everywhere we find a worship of the spirits of nature, of the spirits of the departed, though behind and above it there rises the belief in some higher power, known by different names, sometimes called the Father, the Old One, who is the Maker and Protector of the world, and who always resides in heaven." From Chinese historians we learn that the Huns worshiped the sun, moon, spirits of the sky and earth, and spirits of the departed. Menander, a Byzantine writer, relates of the Turks in his time, that they worshiped fire, water, earth, and believed in and sacrificed to a god whom they regarded as the maker of the world. Castr n, the chief modern authority on the religion of these Northern Mongolians (See his Vor lesungen ber finnische Mythologie), says of the Tungusic tribes: "They worship the sun, the moon, the stars, the earth, fire, the spirits of forests, rivers, and certain sacred localities ; they worship even images and fetishes, but with all this they retain a faith in a supreme being which they</page><page sequence="31">THE CLASSIFICATION OF RELIGIONS. 125 call Buga." " The Samoyedes," he says, "worship idols and various natural objects; but they always profess a belief in a higher divine power which they call Num." This deity they also call Junta, which is the same as the Jumala of Finland. Jumala, from Juma, thunder, and la, the place, meant originally the sky. Later it signified the god of the sky, and finally came to designate gods in general. Among Lapps, Esthonians, Syrjanes, Tcheremissians, and Votyakes the same word is found with slight dialectic vari ations having the like chief signification. Castr n tells a good story to illustrate Samoyede sun worship, or heaven worship where the sun is thought of as the heaven god. He asked an old woman whether she ever said her prayers. She replied : "Every morning I step out of my tent and bow before the sun, and say, When thou risest, I, too, rise from my bed.' And every evening I say, 'When thou sinkest down, I, too, sink down to rest/ " And she added with a touch of self-righteousness : "There are wild people who never say their morning and evening prayers." So much for the general similarity of religions; but are there no linguistic connections? We saw that the Chinese Tien meant sky, god of the sky, and god in gen eral, being in meaning the exact counterpart of the North Turanian Jumala. In Mongolian speech we find Teng-ri with the same three meanings, with the later signification of spirit or demon, good or bad. In Turkish we have Tangry or Te ri, and in Yakute Tangara. Earlier Chinese authors tell us that the Huns gave to their leaders the title Tangli Kutu (or in Chinese T chen-jil) y which meant in Hunnish speech Son of Heaven. Now this title Son of Heaven, Tien-tze, is also the Chinese designation of their emperor. Again, the Chinese historians say that the Tukiu, the an cestors of the Turks, worshiped the spirits of the earth, calling them the Pu-teng-i-li. If, as is probable, pu means</page><page sequence="32">I2 THE MONIST. earth, we have in teng-i-li the Mongolian teng-ri, used in that early time as the general name of gods and spirits. In this series then we have a piece of linguistic evidence of considerable value. We perceive for those of the family in closest connection a name derived from a common root given to the highest deity, and afterwards passing through like organic changes in the process of development. "Every where they begin with the meaning of sky, they rise to the meaning of God, and they sink down again to the meaning of gods and spirits." These changes of mean ing in the words run parallel with the changes which took place in the religions of these peoples. We have now seen the basis on which Professor M ller would set up a science of religion. The linguistic evidence for a classification of the religions of peoples dwelling in Africa, America, and Polynesia is not taken up in this work. The three groups most conspicuous in history are examined and the case is thought strong enough to draw the induction, that in linguistic relationships we have the ground for the most useful divisions within the field of re ligion. Leaving aside the incompleteness of the examination both as to the number of groups left out and the unsatisfac toriness of the result, especially in the case of the Turanians, the questions should be raised : Most useful for what pur pose ? and why exclude other classifications for other pur poses ? As I have again and again remarked, each division which proceeds to look at the subject from a new point of view adds its contribution toward a complete understand ing, and consequently is just as legitimate and indispen sible as any other. Whoever then in an attempt to be scientific makes a new ground of division should endeavor not to commit that grossest of unscientific deeds, viz., the exclusion of facts within his field, even though those facts come in the form of classifications which he did not originate and over which he consequently does not glow</page><page sequence="33">THE CLASSIFICATION OF RELIGIONS. 127 so earnestly. It has not been established by anything Pro fessor M ller has brought forward, nor do I know of any reason why it should be assumed, that "scientific" and "genetic" cover each other, as he seems to assume at the outset. Like all the views before studied, this has its pe culiar place. This sort of starting-point for the study of religions puts us on track of racial and historic connections and relationships between them. It affords help toward answering one of the greatest demands of our times, viz., the question as to the origin and development of things, i. e., the "genesis" question. In this respect it is indeed a welcome suggestion. Yet we must not be so blind in our enthusiasm as to suppose the questions over which we and our age are chiefly interested constitutes the scope of "sci entific" investigation. Through language it is possible to study mythologies and religions as in no other way. Their organic relationship can be shown ofttimes beyond a doubt, and then by the aid of history their relative claims of orig inality and independence can be reasonably settled. In this way unjustifiable assumptions may be set aside and credit be placed where it belongs. It consequently incites to progress by driving us beyond these old assumptions, since it shows us their origin, their relation to other similar ones, their process of development, and, if we will, will help to point out a higher standing-ground for the future. Whatever can assist toward such desiderata has need of no other excuse for its presence. //. According to Ethnological Relationships and Histor ical Connections. A NEW CLASSIFICATION. The reason for an ethnological classification of religions is the fact that religion gets its character from the people or race who develop it or who adopt it, and that the re</page><page sequence="34">128 THE MONIST. ligions of related peoples are more nearly alike in char acter. I have already quoted Max Miiller's remark that "particularly in the early history of the human intellect, there exists the most intimate relationship between lan guage, religion and nationality." As history advances the lines do not run quite so closely parallel. Each and all become intermixed and influenced from without; yet the cast imparted to it and the type which its exponents give it are ever manifest. (Compare, e. g., English, Span ish, and Russian Christianity.) However, notwithstand ing all the deviations or separations between race and re ligion, there yet remains a striking unanimity. This is presented to us at a glance when we take the trouble to compare an ethnographic and a religious map of the world. We have in our time, however, to compare groups or fami lies of each instead of individuals or single members as would be the case in a study of the conditions in ancient times. Within the last few years we have heard much about universal religions as contrasted with national or race religions ; but how strictly in the mass of the populations the racial lines are maintained and how thoroughly they modify any importations of foreign faiths brought about by military might or political influence, is most manifest as soon as our attention is given to the situation. To take an illustration or two from the best known cases: the Christianity of the Romish type, although preached with an unrivalled pertinacity, has signally failed to take a deep hold upon the Teutonic, or Germanic, races. It has been able to take root only where the Roman civilization had been or was at the same time planted. The indepen dent spirit of Northern Europe was never subjected to the Roman yoke, and as soon as it reached a sufficient degree of culture, it produced its Wiclifs, Husses, and Luthers who, with the material then at hand, developed a distinct</page><page sequence="35">THE CLASSIFICATION OF RELIGIONS. 12 racial religious tendency. And the tenacity with which these lines yet hold is too well known to need a word of comment or support. Just as Romanism has found it im possible to penetrate northward, so Protestantism has made little impression on Southern Europe. Wherever Romance peoples are (in Italy, France, Spain, Portugal, Mexico, and South America), there is Roman Christianity in the ascendency; wherever Teutonic, or Germanic, peoples are (in Germany-excepting the southern part where the pop ulation is less purely German, and where it was more sub jected to Roman civilization-Scandinavia, Great Britain, Iceland, United States, British America, and Australia) there is Protestantism. Now the same influences, forces, and isolated circum stances which developed a special race developed at the same time a special religion, which is a necessary con stituent element or part of a race (at least after man had reached a certain stage of mental power or growth). Or, as above explained, if the religion be one imposed upon the race from without, it is destined to be made over and modi fied to correspond with the peculiar character, notions, and circumstances of the people who come to adopt it. Only an occasional thinker rises above the peculiarity which makes his people a distinct one and advocates more uni versal tendencies; and since the influence of these rare coming individuals must be for various reasons exceed ingly limited (especially because the broader views which they preach, in negating so much of the old peculiarities, seem to the masses irreligious), the stamp given to a re ligion must ever come in greater part from the side of the mediocrity of the population. Only at rare intervals in history does there come a juncture of conditions when individual influence can rise so high as to overturn the popular views ; and then we have the beginning of what later is called a new religion. The new views are grad</page><page sequence="36">i30 THE MONIST. ually taken up by the masses and gradually but certainly wrought over, interpreted and developed to correspond to the tendencies and environments of the race in ques tion. Now it should be evident that a religion is not suf ficiently understood (whatever else we may know about it) until it is seen in reference to these racial peculiarities and circumstances of life. And if religion cannot be stud ied in its fulness and fairness without going into its eth nical manifestations, not more can we expect without such a treatment to obtain a due appreciation for this great historic factor. An ethnological study of the field will have the advantage of showing what has been contributed by the various races to the full idea or concept of religion. It will show7 us that its essence has been conceived to con sist in now one and now another element, and through this will teach the elements which properly belong within its domain. In this way, its investigation will do away with a multitude of misconceptions and onesided ideas. Believing then, as I do, that new light may be thrown upon religious phenomena by undertaking its examination in such a manner as above suggested, and believing, as I have said elsewhere, that such a study is demanded by the broad candid requirements of our genuine modern science ; I offer the accompanying ethnographical divisions and outline tables as a guide for such an examination. Although we are far from possessing the material for a complete understanding of all these peoples, yet more is at hand than most of us are aware of, more perhaps than we yet have capacity to use, and more, it is to be feared, than wre yet have disposition to use with fairness and impar tiality toward those belonging to other stems of the race. In support of this remark about the material which stands ready for scientific disposal, as well as for the general cor respondence of the arrangements here adopted with the facts, I beg leave to call attention to the works of Tylor,</page><page sequence="37">THE CLASSIFICATION OF RELIGIONS. I l Spencer, Fr. M ller, Peschel, Ratzel, Hartmann, and Waitz, and to the multitude of works referred to by these well-known writers.

We have now had a glance at the chief methods of classifying religious phenomena. We perceive moreover the various starting-points and principles from which the divisions are made. It is to be hoped also that their ad vantages and limitations have been suggested, if not fully set forth. It shall not be my calling hereafter to ignore these various methods, but on the contrary to often refer to some of them with pleasure. They are neither to be un qualifiedly adopted nor narrowly excluded. They serve their respective purposes ; but because of these virtues, we are not justified in resting content as soon as our desires for clearness are in part satisfied. It must be carefully borne in mind that this subject has never had a universal and impartial investigation such as has been given to many other fields ; hence the best theories about it are but inductions made on imperfect bases. We may trust that here, as everywhere else, nature is greater than our great est guesses, and for this reason we may not hasten to tie ourselves up for fear of getting too far, especially if we divest our minds of every interest but that of desire to get at the largest truth. But how is this largest truth to be attained? Surely not without seeing the greatest possible number of the facts. And not less surely ought those facts to be studied with as little perconceived theory as may be. Our better sciences proceed by gathering the facts in an orderly manner, and then looking to see what laws and principles they point toward. It is the business of history and ethnology to furnish this material; it be longs to philosophy to draw the inductions. It strikes me then that religion (and not more this than any other human expression) does not receive full scientific justice until it has been investigated, historically, ethnologically, and phil osophically; in other words, in terms of time, space and in</page><page sequence="41">THE CLASSIFICATION OF RELIGIONS. 135 most essence. Inasmuch as there is virtually no history obtainable (in the continuous chronological and develop mental sense) for most of the peoples of the world, the historical and ethnical study must go for the most part hand in hand. The first requisite for such an undertaking is to obtain through ethnological science a general notion of the races of men and of the various leading branches of these, past and present. This has been attempted in the five preceding tables, and the reasons for it have been given in former pages of this treatise and in the one on "Introduction to a Historico-Ethnical Study of Religions." Those leading races now form so many leading points of inquiry under each of which many questions are to be asked; and first from the multitude of answers returned may be undertaken the building up of the body or superstructure of what we may fitly term a genuine science of religion.
