<plain_text><page sequence="1">The "Nameless Horror": The Errant Art of Herman Melville and Charles Hewitt William V. Spanos As the Eye, Such the Object. William Blake, Marginalia to Reynold's Discourse So if you want to know why Melville nailed us in Moby- Dick, consider whaling. Consider whaling as a FRON- TIER, and INDUSTRY. A product wanted, men got it: big business. The Pacific as sweatshop. Man, led, against the biggest damndest creature nature uncorks. The whale-ship as factory, the whaleboat the precision instru- ment. The 1840s: The New West in the saddle and Melville No. 20 of a rough and bastard crew. Are they the essentials? Charles Olson, Call Me Ishmael Man errs. Man does not merely stray into errancy. He is always in errancy, because as ek-sistent he in-sists and so already is caught in errancy. The errancy through which man strays is not something which, as it were, extends 127</page><page sequence="2">alongside man like a ditch into which he occasionally stumbles; rather errancy belongs to the inner constitu- tion of Da-sein into which historical man is admitted. Errancy is the free space for that turning in which in- sistent ek-sistence adroitly forgets and mistakes itself constantly anew. The concealing of the concealed being as a whole holds sway in that disclosure of specific beings, which, as forgottenness of concealment becomes errancy. Martin Heidegger, "On the Essence of Truth" Herman Melville's Moby-Dick is a story about the non-color White. Or rather it is a story about the awful human impulse-repeated by the American artist-to impose "color" on whiteness. To be more specific, Melville's novel is a story about two ways of erring about being-in-the- world: one-Ahab's-which violates the mysterious "truth" of Whiteness by coercing it into something it isn't; the other, Ishmael's, which, paradox- ically, lets the mystery of whiteness be. If Melville intends the Whiteness of the Whale to signify the mystery of being, then Moby-Dick is an anti- story, an interrogation of the traditional representational structure that the American artist, despite his insistent effort to break with the Logos of the Old World, re-inscribes into the uncanny formlessness of his re-newed occasion. In the language of recent literary criticism, Melville's novel is a de-struction of the American Adam's nostalgic effort to name-to anthro- pomorphize-and domesticate the dreadful mystery of being. Charles Hewitt's paintings, I submit, are informed by a similar de-structive im- pulse. They are not, like Rockwell Kent's, illustrations of Melville's nar- rative. They are, rather, "errant" intuitions of Melville's disillusionment in the romance of Emerson's "Central Man" and of his effort to de-mystify the privileged anthropomorphic eye of the American Adam, the eye (I) that, in naming and comprehending the White Whale, not only estranges the truth of its being, but also transforms it into a retaliating force. In the brief remarks that follow, I will try to open out this analogy. Ishmael's awakening from the long sleep of careless sociability is precipitated by a meditation on the difference between Ahab's and his own understanding of the White Whale that follows the "oath of violence and revenge"l that he and the others on the Pequod swear before their captain. Ahab "invests" the White Whale with an "intelligent malignity" (MD, p. 159). That is, he anthropomorphizes this living creature of the deep, gives his elusive being a human identity: "Moby Dick." In so doing he gathers the multiple mystery of man's relationship to being at large into a single, undifferentiated, inclusive, and predictable symbol or trope of Evil that, in "explaining" the human predicament, enables him to actively 128</page><page sequence="3">confront its intangibility as if it were an object visible to his panoptic Adamic eye. As Ishmael puts it: No turbaned Turk, no hired Venetian or Malay, could have smote him with more seeming malice. Small reason was there to doubt, then, that ever since that almost fatal encounter [with the White Whale] , Ahab had cher- ished a wild vindictiveness against the whale, all the more fell for that in his frantic morbidness he at last came to identify with him, not only all his bodily woes, but all his intellectual and spiritual exasperations. The White Whale swam before him as the monomaniac incar- nation of all those malicious agencies which some deep men feel eating in them, till they are left living as with half a heart and half a lung. That intangible malignity which has been from the beginning; to whose dominion even the modern Christians ascribe one-half of the worlds; which the ancient Ophites of the east reverenced in their statue devil;-Ahab did not fall down and wor- ship it like them: but deliriously transferring its idea to the abhorred white whale, he pitted himself, all muti- lated, against it. All that most maddens and torments; all that stirs up the lees of things; all truth with malice in it; all that cracks the sinews and cakes the brain; all the subtle demonisms of life and thought; all evil, to crazy Ahab, were visibly personified, and made practically assailable in Moby Dick. He piled upon the whale's white hump the sum of all the general rage and hate felt by his whole race from Adam down; and then, as if his chest had been a mortar, he burst his hot heart's shell upon it. (p. 160. My emphasis.) Like his European counterpart, that is, Ahab reifies the "errant" temporality-the nothingness-of being, transforms its proliferating differ- ence into Identity, its multiplicity into the One (Monos) in order not simply to understand-to comprehend-its elusive mystery, but to gain mastery over-to "take hold of," "to grasp," (as the etymology of "com- prehend" suggests) its elusive and thus dreadful mystery. The process, as Ishmael's recognition of the relationship between the New Adam and the Old Adam implies, is, of course, the obverse face of the nostalgic arche- type of the Fall and Redemption of Adamic man: the dispersal of the Oneness of Eternity occasioned by the fall into time and recuperation of the prelapsarian state by way of anthropomorphizing being, of coercing the shatter-the difference of temporal being, as it were-into the totalized symbolic Image projected by fallen man's recollective eye. In Nietzsche's 129</page><page sequence="4">terms, Captain Ahab's monomaniacal pursuit of the White Whale is ulti- mately motivated by a will to power over being that repeats Western logocentric man's-the old Adam's-obsessive effort to revenge himself against the transcience of time.2 This is precisely, if only tentatively, what Ishmael intuits in the following chapter, which he significantly entitles "The Whiteness of the Whale" in contrast to the previous meditaton on Ahab's attitude which he names "Moby Dick." Whereas Ahab will pursue Moby Dick in the name of mankind's vengeance against the disturbing dynamics of being, Ishmael accepts the unspeakable mystery of the white whale as the mystery of being without willfully converting it into something he can comprehend. He acknowledges the dread generated by the whiteness of the whale, the dread, in Kierkegaard's and Heidegger's rhetoric, that, in contrast to fear, has no thing as its object, the Nothingness of being-in-the-world.3 He must, it is true, explain himself. But as his supplementary and deferring play of words referring to whiteness-"pale"; "pallid," "pall," "appalling" -and his interrogative rhetoric suggest, Ishmael, unlike the Adamic Ahab, refuses to name, to identify, to "color," the "nameless," the "ineffable," the "dumb blankness," the "visible absence of color," for the sake of comprehending its dreadful mystery and thus subduing its threatening uncanniness: What the white whale was to Ahab, has been hinted; what, at times, he was to me, as yet unsaid. Aside from those more obvious considerations touching Moby Dick, which could not but occasionally awaken in any man's soul some alarm, there was another thought, or rather vague, nameless horror concerning him, which at times by its intensity completely overpowered all the rest; and yet so mystical and well nigh ineffable was it, that I almost despair of putting it in a comprehensible form. It was the whiteness of the whale that above all things appalled me. But how can I hope to explain myself here; and yet, in some dim, random way, explain myself I must, else all these chapters might be naught. (MD, p. 163) Ahab's coercive Adamic eye gathers the dreadful multiplicity of the errant energies of being-the "Naught," as it were-that renders the human situation-man's being-in-the-world-intolerable into a single, undif- ferentiated, and identifiable trope. Thus, like fallen but still "central" man in the Western tradition, whose end is promised in the beginning, he is enabled to fulfill his monistic purpose-his story-without de-viating from his linear course, without swerving from the prescribed way: 130</page><page sequence="5">"The path to my fixed purpose is laid with iron rails, whereon my soul is grooved to run. Over unsounded gorges, through the rifled hearts of mountains, under torrents' beds, unerringly I rush! Naught's an obstacle, naught's an angle to the iron way!" (MD, p. 147) Everything and everyone-the charts, the instruments of navigation, the weapons, the "isolatoes" who make up the Pequod's crew-all become a collective harpoon aimed at the "heart" of the White Whale, a collective instrument of Ahab's Mono-mania, which can now be understood as the madly rational obsession to convert the dynamic and duplicitous motion of living being into still-life, a dead one. Human knowledge becomes an instrument of power. Man's natural impulse to com-prehend the meaning of being transforms the comely hand the classical Greeks idealized into a monstrous claw. Having "located" "Moby Dick," Ahab cries triumphant- ly: Stern all! Oh Moby Dick, I clutch thy heart at last. (MD, p. 423) But, of course, as Ahab himself unknowingly knows, the Naught is an obstacle in his unerring iron way. The trope tropes. For it is precisely at the moment when the Pequod locates the White Whale that it not only eludes Ahab's grasp, but becomes a retaliating force that destroys the instrument that would contain it. It is to this troping, this swerving-this "ontological invasion," as it were-that Ishmael bears increasing witness on each of the three days of "the chase." When, on the first and second of these occasions, Ahab calls to the lookout in the masterhead, "Which d'ye see?" the response is, "Nothing, nothing, sir." And at that moment the White Whale surfaces: There she blows!-there she blows! A hump like a snow- hill! It's Moby Dick!" (MD, pp. 446, 453, 461) The identification of Moby Dick and Nothingness-and the reversal of pursuit-become explicit to Ishmael on the third and last day. For when the look-out answers Ahab's fierce question-"Nothing, sir"-Ahab shouts: Aye, he's chasing me now! Not I him-that's bad! (MD, p. 461) It is not simply, as Charles Olson puts it, echoing the pre-Socratic Hera- clitus, that man's will to power over being estranges him from that with which he is most familiar.4 His arrogant anthropomorphic effort to master, to subdue, to contain the mystery of being within the all-encom- 131</page><page sequence="6">passing and enclosing circle projected by the meta-physical eye, ends, rather, in the metamorphosis of being's natural energies into an ontological adversary that breaches the logocentric circle, dis-closes the absence at its center, that is, reveals the circle idealized by Western man as the perfect All to be the Zero of Nothingness. And the circuitous journey promised by the archetype of the Fall from an absolute origin and enacted in virtually all the "masterpieces" of the Western artistic tradition--the journey that begins with the Adam's violence against the Logos and his exile from the at-home of the fatherland the Logos guarantees into the uncanny not-at-home and ends with the recuperation of the origin or center that neutralizes the bite of time-is not finally accomplished. For Ahab and all his crew-except the eccentric Ishmael-the circumnavigating voyage ends in the "middle"-in the "zero zone"-before which there is no beginning (arche) and after which there is no end (telos) (in both senses of the word), when the Pequod goes down into the "yawning gulf," the vortex, "dragging a part of heaven with it": Now small fowls flew screaming over the yet yawning gulf: a sullen white surf beat against its steep side; then all collapsed, and the great shroud [read "pall"] rolled on as it rolled five thousand years ago (MD, p. 469) As the epilogue of Moby Dick makes clear, what the de-centered Ishmael discovers and acknowledges in the process of re-telling his ancient mariner's errant tale to the reader is not the mystified still point of the turning world that certifies his fathered centrality in the schemes of things, in physis, but the centerlessness of being that makes him always already marginal, not the "central man" of the humanistic tradition that Emerson would re-inscribe into American culture, but the "ec-centric man" that the European tradition has existed to discipline and reform: So, floating on the margin of the ensuing scene, and in full sight of it, when the half-spent suction of the sunk ship reached me, I was then, but slowly, drawn towards the closing vortex. When I reached it, it had subsided to a creamy pool. Round and round, then, and ever con- tracting towards the button-like black bubble at the axis of that slowly wheeling circle, like another Ixion / did revolve. Till, gaining that vital center, the black bubble upward burst,- and now liberated by reason of its cun- ning spring, and, owing to its great buoyancy, rising with great force, the coffin life-buoy shot lengthwise from the sea, fell over, and floated by my side. Buoyed up by that coffin, for almost one whole day and night, I floated on 132</page><page sequence="7">a soft and dirge-like main... On the second day, a sail drew near, nearer, and picked me up at last. It was the devious-cruising Rachel that in her retracing search after her missing children, only found another orphan. (MD, p. 470) Acknowledging death-the absence of presence in time-at the center of being, Ishmael relinquishes the abiding patriarchal Word and the coercive circular genetic model it authorizes and archivalizes. To put it positively, he acknowledges his orphanage, his de-centered homelessness, his errancy as the measure of his occasion. (The word derives from occasus, "the falling of the sun," which, in turn, has its source in cadere, "to die," "to perish," a word, not incidentally, that is also the source of occidere, from which our word "Occident" derives.) In other words, at the "end," Ishmael discovers what it means to be the exile he calls himself at the beginning. In so doing he also discovers that generosity in the face of being that lets being be. It is, I suggest, Melville's de-struction5 of the anthropo- morphic impulse of central man, his disclosure of man's marginality and the imperative of care or, in Keats's phrase, of Negative Capability, in the face of the "Whiteness" of being that reveals this ec-centric American novelist to be the precursor of the post-modern American writer, of, say, Wallace Stevens: One must have a mind of winter To regard the frost and the boughs Of the pine-trees crusted with snow And have been cold a long time To behold the junipers shagged with ice, The spruces rough in the distant glitter Of the January sun; and not to think Of any misery in the sound of the wind, In the sound of a few leaves, Which is the sound of the land Full of the same wind That is blowing in the same bare place For the listener, who listens in the snow, And, nothing himself, beholds Nothing that is not there and the nothing that is.6 133</page><page sequence="8">II This dis-placement of the American Adam as "central" or, in Stevens's word, "major" man, I suggest, is the essential theme enacted by the anti-representational-I am tempted to say "de-structive "-forms of Charles Hewitt's paintings "about" Moby Dick. It is not my purpose to undertake an analysis of his work at large. Such an effort to unknot its Naught would violate Hewitt's intention. It is no accident, I think, that Hewitt reluctantly gave them names only for the convenience of the gal- lery director. I intend, rather, to suggest, all too briefly, a way of "read- ing" them that, like Ishmael's supplementary text on the whiteness of the whale, simultaneously unconceals and conceals their ineffable "essence," that brings their "meaning," not into a stable and abiding presence, but into a fluid nearness that is at the same time distant. Hewitt's "abstract" paintings refuse to satisfy the representation- al and narrative expectations of the spectator's eye. Nevertheless, it will not fail, indeed, it will be compelled, to observe that they precipitate a collage of three related and focal images or visual tropes which resonate insistently through the whole group. As in the case of Moby Dick, these are, the human hand turning into claw ("The Prophecy," 4; "Spouter Inn," 5; "The Oath," 7; "Dream of Ahab with Whale," 10); the heads of harpoons ("Harpooner 2," 12; "Harpoon Motif," 13; "Drowning Har- pooner," 14; "A Dream of Ahab with Harpoons," 15); and, above all, the whale's eye ("The Prophecy," 4; "Dream of Ahab with Whale," 10; "Dream of Ahab with Harpoons," 15, "Metamorphosis: A Dream," 17; "The Wave," 18; "Deep Dive 1," 19). More specifically, the hand/claw and the harpoons are agents directed against the White Whale, the form of which, as, for example, in the "central" four-panel painting "Dream of Ahab with Whale" (10), blurs into suggestions of white waves and moun- tains that evoke the sense of the whale's continuity with nature or being at large. We recall, of course, the lookout's cry at the first sighting of the White Whale: "A hump like a snow-hill! It's Moby Dick! " The eye, on the other hand, is invariably the whale's, and its intense gaze is directed at the spectator. It is this tension within the triad of tropes that constitutes the "center" of the exhibit, indeed, that generates the pervasive violence- the fiery colors and agitated lines-that informs the paintings as a whole, a violence that the repeated frames within a number of the pieces cannot contain. I am suggesting that Hewitt, like Melville, reads Ahab's-central man's-anthropomorphic impulse to name and thus to bring the mystery into a still presence is ultimately an act of revenge against the temporality and transience of being and that it ends, not in the fulfillment of his unsatisfied desire for certainty and repose, but in a metamorphosis that transforms man into the monstrosity he attributes to the being he would subdue and his innocent victim into a retaliatory force. Like Melville, 134</page><page sequence="9">Hewitt reads the White Whale's attack on the Pequod as an ontological invasion precipitated by man's will to power over being. To put it in terms of the triad of tropes, Hewitt, like Melville- and the post-modern American poets and novelists he has influenced, Stevens, Williams, Olson, and Pynchon, for example-discloses the violence that ultimately informs the American Adam's recuperation of the anthro- pomorphic eye, the eye that European man, from the beginning of Western civilization, has privileged as the agency of knowledge. I mean, of course, the panoptic egocentric eye (I) that, obsessively bent on bringing the elusive, unnameable, and ineffable mystery of being "to light" (to presence), transforms itself into a willful agency of totalizing and undiffer- entiating comprehension, of taking hold of, of grasping: a murderous in- strument of violence, a hand and its technological extensions-the harpoon, the ship, the crew-into a rapacious phallic claw that would seize and immobilize all the difference of being. This transformation, which is most powerfully articulated in the "The Oath" (7), is what the White Whale's disconcerting eye "sees" in Hewitt's paintings. Its accusatory gaze is thus a "judgment" not only against Ahab's Adamic vision, but also, as I will presently suggest, against the (American) spectator's complicity with Ahab's mono-mania, his madly rational quest for the One. III As I have been suggesting, Moby Dick, is not simply about the human condition. It is also about art, literary and plastic as well. For Ishmael is acutely conscious of the relationship between the actual ex- perience he has suffered and the verbal/plastic process of recounting or representing it. After bearing witness to the terrible consequence of the Adamic Man of Power's careless anthropomorphic effort to comprehend and master the White Whale, Ishmael can no longer be certain of the "instrument" of story-telling to which the Tradition, since Aristotle, has given privileged status: the mimetic or representational method of linear narration that is intended to bring that which is absent (the "darkness" of whiteness) into presence as a totalized object of knowledge before the anthropomorphic eye. His inherited archival method, Ishmael seems to realize, is, like Ahab's monomaniacal anthropomorphism, not simply a disciplinary instrument of the artist's will to power over his materials, but an instrument that tropes, that paradoxically alienates the experience it is intended to bring to stand, i.e., to "capture" it, as the innocent rhetoric of the tradition has it. It is no accident, therefore, that Ishmael writes a chapter entitled "Of the Monstrous Pictures of Whales," in which he meditates on the failure of re-presentational art to depict the whale: But these manifold mistakes in depicting the whale are not so very surprising after all. Consider! Most 135</page><page sequence="10">of the scientific drawings have been taken from the stranded fish; and these are about as correct as a drawing of a wrecked ship, with broken back, would correctly represent the noble animal itself in all its undashed pride of hulls and spars. Though elephants have stood for their full-lengths, the living Leviathan has never yet fairly floated himself for his portrait. The living whale, in his full majesty and significance, is only to be seen at sea in unfathomable waters; and afloat the vast bulk of him is out of sight, like a launched line-of-battle ship; and out of that element it is a thing eternally impossible for mortal man to hoist him bodily into the air, so as to preserve all his mighty swells and undulations. And, not to speak of the highly presumable difference of contour between a young sucking whale and a full-grown Platon- ian Leviathan; yet, even in the case of one of those young sucking whales hoisted to a ship's deck, such is then the outlandish, eel-like limbered varying shape of him, that his precise expression the devil himself could not catch.... For all these reasons, then, any way you may look at it, you must need conclude that the great Levia- than is that one creature in the world which must remain unpainted to the last (MD, pp. 227-28, my emphasis).7 To suggest how Melville/Ishmael breaks out of the impasse of traditional representational narrative practice would require far more space than I can give it here. But I can, perhaps, suggest the direction of such a project by referring back to the "dim, random way" he adopts to "explain" himself concerning the "mystical and well nigh ineffable" nature of the White Whale, where he despairs "of putting it in a comprehensive form." Put simply, Melville/Ishmael assumes a negatively capable imaginative stance in the face of the "living" being he would bring near: a willingness, in Keats's still to be understood language, "to remain in uncertainties, Mysteries, doubts, without any irritable reaching after fact and reason .. " Unlike the representational or recollective artist, who is assured of the positively capable instrumentality of language (or paint), Melville/Ishmael uses a language (color) interrogatively; not to bring the whale to presence as a fixed and permanently visible thing before his and his reader's judgmental eye, as a nature morte, but precisely to activate a care-ful awareness of the mystery of its living and differentiated being. And he achieves this gener- ous purpose by what might be called, after Jacques Derrida, a process of supplementarity: that is, by a projection of a series of analogous meta- phors or tropes about whiteness that always already defer its final meaning -its presence.8 So, too, Melville's narration is not an Ahabian re-presenta- 136</page><page sequence="11">tion of the catastrophic journey from the vantage point of the assured certainty of a resolved end. It is, rather, an insistently disrupted narrative, a troping that dis-places the arrogant anthropomorphic eye of the reader's mind, a repetition in Kierkegaard's and Heidegger's sense of the word, that activates a remembering, a retrieval, which is simultaneously a process of discovering: a projective activity that lets the differential and deferring measure of the original experience be. Understood as a postponement of presence, as a refusal to fulfill the expectation of closure culturally inscribed in the mind's eye of the reader or, to put it another way-one that appropriates Heidegger and Foucault9-to satisfy Adamic man's distancing archival impulse to "en- frame" being, can it not be said that the art of Moby Dick is an art of dis-location that, in breaking down the anthropomorphic hierarchy, displaces central man as center and generates a negatively capable stance before being? This, I suggest, is the essential impulse behind Charles Hewitt's art. In turning the piercing eye of the White Whale against the Adamic spectator, Hewitt, I take it, not only focuses the viewer's com- plicity with Ahab's murderous act, but also dis-places the centrality of man's panoptic eye and its received standard of judgment, its anthropo- morphic measure. Whereas the novelist and the painter in the mimetic tradition accommodate the eye of the reader/spectator, rendering their art a confirmation and legitimation of his logocentric expectations, Hewitt, like Melville, dis-locates it and thus renders the traditional interpreter, the interpreted, the traditional questioner, the questioned. Man as the measure of all things, becomes man the measured (by being). In thus dethroning the careless mon-archic Adamic eye, doesn't Hewitt, like Melville and the contemporary American writers that follow him, bear witness to the pos- sibilities of a new, a post-modern, art, the interested measure of which, in Robert Creeley's words, is "the measure of its occasion?" Isn't this "old measure of care," as Charles Olson calls it,10 that which "informs" the kind of erring I spoke of at the beginning, the measure which errs in behalf, not of the Truth, but truth? I think also of Wallace Stevens's "Notes Toward a Supreme Fiction": Whistle, forced bugler, That bugles for the mate, nearby the nest, Cock bugler, whistle and bugle and stop just short, Red robin, stop in your preludes, practicing Mere repetitions. These things at least comprise An occupation, in exercise, a work, A thing final in itself and, therefore, good: One of the vast repetitions final in Themselves and, therefore, good, the going round 137</page><page sequence="12">And round and round, the merely going round, Until merely going round is a final good. The way wine comes at a table in a wood. And we enjoy like men, the way a leaf Above the table spins its constant spin, So that we look at it with pleasure, look At it spinning its eccentric measure. Perhaps, The man-hero is not the exceptional monster, But he that of repetition is most master.1 1 State University of New York at Binghamton NOTES 1 Herman Melville, Moby Dick, ed.
