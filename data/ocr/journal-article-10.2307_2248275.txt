<plain_text><page sequence="1">VII.-NEW BOOKS. About Dreaming, Laughing and Blushing. By Sir ARTHUR MAITCHELL, K. C. B. Edinburgh and London: William Green &amp; Sons, 1905. Pp. 157. THE three topics which are discussed by Sir Arthur Mitchell in this little volume offer some of the most difficult problemus both to psychology and biology. Their intrinsic interest is here enhanced by the fact that the author has had wide experience of niental disease, and therefore of the correlation between mental states and bodily expression. His treatmnent of the subjects is unconventional, but at the saine tiine thoroughly scien- tific; he never goes beyond what he has himself observed or verified. At the end of each article is a short summary of the conclusions which have been formed, and a useful bibliography is added at the close of the book. The most controversial of the three articles is the first,-on DreaminIg. Briefly, Sir Arthur holds that dreaming is a teinporary state of mental disorder, involving absence of will control, and diminution of the moral sense; that this state is beneficial, since the exercise of the will, which is the cause of mental fatigue, is in abeyance; and tllat dreaming almost certainly takes place continuously during sleep. Dreamiiing is thinking, uncontrolled by will, and thinking is coincident with, and perhaps a neces- sary condition of living, in man, just as are breathing, and the circulation of the blood. As Sir Arthur admits, this proposition is not capable of absolute proof, but neither is its contrary. I am not sure however that all his arguments hold. One of these is that whenever he sets himself to observe his mental state on ernerging from sleep, he always finds a dream present. May not the resolve to observe have some effect on the manner of waking, -forcing the consciousness, as it were,-just as the resolve to awake at a certain hour has an effect on the time of waking 2 The theory will no doubt be eagerly accepted by believers in the " suib- liminal consciousness," but Sir Arthur is not himself one of them; he is not convinced that orderly, i.e., will-controlled, thinking occurs durilng sleep, although there is between the orderly thin-king of wide-awake life, day- dreaming and sleep-thinking, only a difference of degree, not of killd. One of the chief difficulties of the theory, indeed, is its view of the will as in a sense external to thouight ; true, it has high psychological authority for that. One of the many interesting suggestions which occur in this article is that momnentary sleeps are nmuch imore frequent in waking hours than we believe, and that the dreams which comne in these momentary breaks in waking life may explain many of the sup- posed apparitions of the dead. A person in one of these short sleeps, of which he is unaware, has the dreamn--vision of a deceased friend, and waking immiiediately after, believes he has really seen the friend. The explanation, if valid, might be extended to the visions of spiritlualistic seances, and others of that type.</page><page sequence="2">110 NEW BOOKS. Laughing, like dreaming, is also found to correspond to a temporary state of mnental disorder, which is beneficial rather than harmful: in the mental state from which laughter issues the will is again in abeyance, and with it the moral sense is affected. Laughter does not always, or even generally, proceed fromn a purely joyous state: there is more often a touch of malice, or of meanness, or the like, in the feeling which excites it. Sir Arthur finds the phenomenon of laughter,-i.e., the physical movements in which the mental state is expressed,--inexplicable, as also the fact that precisely the same physical expression may be produced by the act, or even by the threat of tickling. The two sets of phenomena cannot be distinguished from one another, yet the one is pleasant and its continuance desired, the other unpleasant, and its continuance avoided. Perhaps the author sets them in too strong contrast one with another. It is hardly true, e.g., that " the laughter which follows tickling is not the expression of a mental state coincident with, or antecedent to, the act of tickling. It is induced by a physical operation " (p. 51). After all, the laughter does not ensue unless the tickling is felt; it is a reaction to a certain sensation-mass, and may be called the expression of that mental state: on the other hand, it is at least not unreasonable to find an analogy between the sensation of tickling and the feeling which arises on the perception of a ridiculous scene. Again, the effect of inhaling nitrous oxide mnixed with air, which Sir Arthur regards as a third and distinct kind of laughter, may be only an indirect effect of the gas. The latter may paralyse the control-centres of the laughter-reflex, so that laughter ensues upon the slightest sensation. We are all aware of nloods in which laughter arises far out of proportion to the cause. In this article there are some useful notes on the natural history of laughter: its occurrence in anitnals, in man at different ages, in the blind, in blind- deaf mutes, etc. Blushing offers perhaps the most inexplicable phenomenon of the three: it has no apparent raisoat d'gtre, serves no purpose that we can discover in the economy of life; yet it is universal in man, is unlearned, for it occurs in the born-blind, and in blind-deaf mutes,-and it also can be produced by the action of a special drug. Here again we have, according to Sir Arthur, a mental disorder, which, although not perhaps beneficial, at least does not harm the subject; but in this case the dis- order follows rather than causes the physical appearances. The mental state of which blushing is the outcome is said to be shame at the ob- servation by others of some, real or supposed, unbecoming action on our part. But is there not a blush of surprise, of sudden joy ? Perhaps the true mental correlative of the blush has still to be defined. It suggests to the author that possibly every mental state has some correlative physical outcome of a definite kind, although not necessarily on the sur- face of the body, while conversely every bodily state has probably its special mental correlative. Some interesting illustrations are given from his experience of insanity. J. L. MCINTYRE. Primitive Traits in Religious Revivals: a Study in Mental and Social Evolution. By FREDERICK MORGAN DAVENPORT. New York and London: Macmillan &amp; Co., 1905. Pp. 323. Prof. Davenport holds that religious moveements of magnitude have often assumed a mode which has been termed sympathetic likeminded- ness, and the predominant mental characteristics of a population under its influence are suggestibility, imitativeness, imagination, and emotion.</page><page sequence="3">NEW BOOKS. 111 These are exceedingly primitive and probably universal mental traits, and combined with them are nervous instability and a great lack of inhibitive control. The author gives examples of what he terms ' normal nervous instability' amnong certain Siberian tribes, but he could have amnplified with advantage his meagre reference to the latta of the Malay peoples who, however, are by no means " artless, unsophisticated children of nature ". The bulk of the book is devoted to unbiased but sympathetic accounts of the Ghost-dance of the North American Indian, the religion of the American Negro, the Scotch-Irish revivals in Kentucky in 1800 and in Ulster in 1859, the New England awakening under Jonathan Edwards which began in 1734 and lasted till 1750. The Scotch-Irish revival in Ulster was imitated from America, but that associated with the name of John Wesley was at first independent of American influence, though Edwards' account of the movement and of the wonderful ' bodily effects' was read by John Wesley in 1738, and a great outburst of emotional enthusiasm with bodily moveinents associated with physical and menital agony sub - sequently resulted from the preaching of Wesley. The descriptions of these and other revivals afford material for the student, though possibly they might have been extended with advantage. The author has also attempted to place before the reader the sociological condition of the people at the time of the appearance of the several evangelists. The author says he has " endeavoured to present a sociological inter- pretation of religious revivals ". He belongs to that school of social psychologists who are content with the use of such vague terms as sug- gestibility, imitation and the like, in lieu of an explanation which is the result of a mnore exact and fair analysis. The explanation of the phenomena of revivals which he offers is that they are due to " mental and nervous instability," in other words to the power of being swayed by emotional excitement. This he regards, prob- ably rightly so, as a primitive trait; but the explanations he offers are fairly obvious, they have been recognised by others, though they may not have been translated into technical phrases. Speaking generally, it is in the main true that savages have little power of emotional control, but we constantly find primitive peoples who make a point of not ex- pressing certain emotions, and they nlay even undergo a definite training to this effect. The lower or the less educated classes of civilised com- munities often have less power of control than many so-called savages, and it is among such that revivals spread like wild-fire. The power of controlling the emotions is one of the signs of civilisation, and the greater is this power the less likely is religious awakening to manifest itself in bizarre actions. One cannot help feeling that the book would have had a greater value if the author had paid more attention to primitive religions, a field which contains much instructive material for the psychologist. A. C. HADDON. Le moralisme de Kant et l'amoralisme contemporain. Par ALFRED FOUILLE'E. Paris: Felix Alcan, 1905. Pp. xxiii, 375. The present work of M. Fouillee is a critical study preliminary to further ethical work of a more constructive nature. In it he examines two ex- treme types of ethical theory which stand in the way of a true ethical synthesis-on the one hand, the a priori formalism of Kant (which would appear to be much more a living force in France than in this country), and, on the other, the diametrically opposed type of ethical, or rather anti-ethical, theory, which is exemplified by Hedonisin, or again by Nietz-</page><page sequence="4">112 NEW BOOKS. sche's glorification of might, and by which the conception of duty, so all-important for Kant, is ignored or boldly rejected. The real thesis of the book is that these two extremes have their common root in a false dualism, or radical opposition between morality and actual human nature. The difference between them is, that, whereas Kant infers that actual human nature must be suppressed in order that a transcendental mnoral law may prevail, the opposite type of theory regards this law as a fiction with which actual human nature is at variance. The part that deals with Kant occupies more than half the volume. After an introduction designed to bring out by contrast the peculiar character of the Kantian ethics, MI. Fouillee proceeds to examine crit- ically the argument of the Critique of Practical Reason. The discussion deals successively with the conception of a pure practical reason, which is submitted to a lengthy criticism, the conception of a forinal im- perative, and finally the conception of freedom. In spite of the evident care which M. Fouillee has devoted to this part of his argument, and the somewhat diffuse elaboration with which he has developed it, it seems to me the least effective part of the book. The questions at issue be- tween a formal rationalism like Kant's and any teleological ethics are so broad and fundamental, that one expects a criticism of corresponding breadth, a criticism such as M. Fouillee's own thesis above-mentioned suggests. What he actually gives us, however, is a criticism of a highly technical nature, which requires a constant reference to the scholastic details of the Kantian system. And, even apart from this mistake in tactics, I think the technical criticism itself will not appeal to present- day disciples of Kant as a really searching or successful examination of the master's teaching. In spite of Mi. Fouillee's close attentlon to the details of Kant's ethical system he seems to show too little sympathy with and appreciation of its significance as a whole. A single instance must suffice. Referring to Kant's description of our consciousness of the moral law as a "fact of reason," M. Fouillee asks: "Comment peut-il y avoir dans la raison pure un fait, fait qui n'a rien d'empiriqiie, qui n'est meme pas un fait veritable ? Quel fait peut etablir le pouvoir de causalite qu'on attribue A la raison pure ? Il n'y a devant nous qu'un seul fait, A savoir que nous, hommes civilises et socialisgs, iious concevons un devoir, lui attribuons un pouvoir de realisation par notre intermediaire, et eprouvons une impulsion correlative, qui reussit en une certaine mesure. C'est cette conception, cette impulsion et ce pouvoir qun!il s'agit precisdment d'examiner, pour voir s'ils ne s'expliqueraient pas autrement que par la causalite supra-sensible et par l'objectivite d'une loi formelle universelle. I1 faudrait prouver que c'est bien la raison pure qui cause A elle seule la d6termination de la volonte appe]6e devoir... I1 faudrait prouver que c'est bien la seule universalitg de la loi qui, ind6- pendamment de son contenu, cause un interet intellectuel et rend ainsi la raison pure pratique par le fait; que c'est bien la forme seule qiii agit comine cause, pour determiner le vouloir inidependaminent de toute matiere et de toute fin: tu dois" (pp. 55-56). If Kant has not been trying to prove any of these things one wonders what he is supposed to have been doing in the Analytic. But it is significant that M. Fouillee elsewhere complains that Kant does no more than analyse the conditions of the possibility of duty. The second part of the book deals first with Hedonism, and then with the ethics of Nietzsche's " Wille zur Macht ". The criticism of psycho- logical and ethical Hedonism is brief, and contains little that is not already familiar to students of ethics, but it gives an excellent re- statement of the objections usually taken to these doctrines. The renmaining section on Nietzsche is longer, and constitutes an admir-</page><page sequence="5">NEW BOOKS. 113 able and effective criticism of the paradoxes of that would-be revolutionary moralist. Nietzsche, says M. Fouillee, "n'est pas capable de dire deux mots de vrais sans en ajouter trois de faux". And with much clearness and point our author brings out again and again the elements of fallacious exaggeration and distortion that go to make up Nietzsche's often far from novel heresies. In numerous passages he exposes very happily the easy device by which Nietzsche and his disciples undertake to level down all moral values. All values, all actions are but expressions of the universal " Wille zur Macht," therefore no one of them is better than another. Forcefulness is shown as much in badness as in goodness, and it is the same forcefulness that is shown in both. M. Fouillee shows how in- cessantly these fallacies and ambiguities take the place of serious argument. To take only one of the many passages one might quote: " Pour toute esp6ce d'homme [according to Nietzsche] demeuree vigoureuse et pres de la nature, l'amour et la haine, la reconnaissance et la vengeance, la bonte et la colere, l'action affirmative et l'action negative sont insepar- ables: 'On est bon, A condition que l'on sache aussi etre m6chant; on est mechant parce que, autrement, on ne saurait etre bon' . . . ' L'homme bon est l'hemiplegique de la vertu' . . . Tel est le sophisme de Nietzsche, depassant ceux de Callicles ou de Polus, et qui efit fait la joie de Socrate. Ce dernier n'aurait pas manque de dire :-V'apr6s ton raisonnement, 6 mon ami, l'homme n'est bien portant qu'A la condition d'etre malade; une bonne sant6 est l'h6mipl6gie de la sante; bien plus, l'hemiplegie elle- meme est necessaire pour le plein et entier usage du corps." HEENRY BARKER. L'Objet de la Metaphysique selon Kant et selon Aristote, par C. SENTROUL, Docteur en Philosophie. Louvain: Institut Sup6rieur de Philo- sophie, 1905. Pp. 240. "Roused from his dogmatic slumber " by Hume, Kant's aim in philo- sophy was the restoration of certainty and peace. But in labouring for this restoration the wizard of Kdnigsberg raised up spirits too potent even for himself to lay. Since Kant, philosophy has been like a haunted house where no man can rest. Those who have gone farthest with him have insisted on going beyond him, and have filled the house of philo- sophy with weirder and still weirder spectral forms. Then has been sounded the cry of alarm 'back to Kant'. M. Sentroul proposes a still further regress, 'back to Aristotle,' back to the philosophy of the 'plain man,' who will have it that the object of metaphysics is 'being,' that thoughts come of impressions of things, that all science and all philosophy is simply Nature revealing herself to the thinking mind, not the thinking mind imposing its forms upon an outside world, which is ultimately nothing but its own creation. M. Sentroul is an intelligent and even sympathetic opponent, and draws the great lines of Kantian thought with a nettete lacking in the original, at the same time abundantly bearing out his every statement by Kant's own words. He agrees with Jacobi that the reality of the external world, so vehemently affirmed by Kant, is a " subjective reality," which means, not that things are, but that the mind is under an intel- lectual necessity of taking them to be (pp. 107-108). He points an interesting contrast beween the Kantian and the Aristotelian theory of perception (pp. 134.135). The bringing in of ' practical reason' to remedy the breakdown of 'pure reason' was not, according to M. Sentroul, an after-thought with Kant, but was part of his initial intention in writing the Critique of Pure Reason. This is argued from the Prolegomena 8</page><page sequence="6">114 NEW BOOKS. which appeared in 1783, two years after the first edition of the Critique. Of the peculiarity, not to say the weakness, so essential to Kantism, of this dualism of pure and practical reason, the thorough-paced intel- lectualist Aristotle keeps clear. But for 'practical reason' we should have had from Kant no metaphysics, neither speculative nor practical. Kantian metaphysics deal with the Absolute, with the unknowable, but not with the unthinkable, nor with the unbelievable, nay, they deal with that which man must think and believe, in virtue of those ' ideas of superior reason,' self, world, God, and again those 'postulates of practical reason,' God, liberty, immortality (pp. 198-199). Not only are we compelled to think as though these things were, but further we are driven under stress of the 'categorical imperative,' to admit them for certainties-certainties, however, of a peculiar order, not truths intellectually discerned and evidenced, but practical needs of our nature (pp. 207-208). In this re- admission of metaphysics by a side-door after they have been ejected by the main entrance, Comte and Kant act consistently together, as M. Sentroul points out in an interesting page (p. 190). Kant will ever have his admirers; it is for them to defend him against the witticism of Secretan (quoted on p. 192): " There are two parts in the system of Kant, a science which is not true, and a truth which is not known ". Any student seeking an introduction to Kant would do well to apply to M. Sentroul. A book so pregnant with thought should have an index. J. RICKABY. Die Bilder von der Materie. Eine psychologische Untersuchung iiber die Grundlagen der Physik. By Dr. JULIUS SCHULTZ. Gottingen: Van- denhoeck &amp; Ruprecht. London: Williams and Norgate, 1905. Pp. viii, 201. It is a somewhat curious fact that though no country has been more productive than Germany of starting-points for that pragmatist move- ment which is now manifesting itself so vigorously in American, English, French and Italian philosophy, yet it has nowhere been more difficult hitherto to find a contemporary thinker who employs the new mode of philosophising in its entirety. In very various ways Lotze, Wundt, Ostwald, Mach, Nietzsche, Paulsen, Windelband, Eucken, Simmel and. Jerusalem have all made important and even essential contributions to the new standpoint; but somehow no one has seemed able to put them together and to perceive their full significance. Germany in short has lagged behind; in part, perhaps, because she has been strangely remiss in translating James's epoch-making Psychology. In Dr. Schultz, however, we may welcome an almost full-blown,, and certainly full-blooded, pragmatist, whose testimony is not the less precious because he seems to have developed his position for himself. He had shown in his remarkable Psychologie der Axiome how clearly he had perceived that our axiomatic principles are human postulates whose meaning lies in their relation to experience. Or as he well says in his present work, which is as lively and stimulating as its predecessor, though its ingenious discussions are so technical as to appeal primarily to physi- cists, an axiom is "a proposition curiously coagulated out of a priori postulation, arbitrary construction and empirical testing" (p. 39). He has grasped, that is, how very complex these ' self-evident' principles really are. But still there is a striking divergence from the type of prag- matism with which we are familiar in this country. Dr. Schultz considers his method apriorist, and himself a Kantian, and an opponent of positivism in science. This clearly shows that empiricism for him is still the enemy,.</page><page sequence="7">NEW BOOKS. 115 that it still means for him the sensationalist travesty of human cognition, and that he has not yet heard of the more radical empiricism which is. voluntarist and will scorn no psychical fact as irrelevant. And so he continues to classify his theory under the old rubric as apriorism, instead of insisting that it really transcends and supersedes both of the old- intellectualist classifications. Now of course in a sense a postuLlate may be called a priori. It is. something we bring to experience to illuimine it. And no passive re- ceptivity of impressions could ever have produced it. And perhaps the word a priori is already vague and ambiguous enough not to resent, or even to welcome, this further interpretation. Again, almost every philo- sopher can, if he chooses, affiliate himself to Kant, with much the same show of reason. But where is the gain? The reference to Kant imports into a system all the confusions of that great master, and to call the method of postulation a priori is merely to plunge in unfathomable obscurity what was pretty plain before. Nay more. The mere use of this misleading nomenclature blinds Dr. Schultz to the extent and importance of the empirical factor in his own theory. If he had gone into the reasons for our postulating, he would have seen that the apriority of our postulates is relative and rests on an empirical basis. It is an em- pirical fact that our nature is (or has comne to be) such as to make certain demands on its experience. And those demands are provoked by the empirical nature of that experience. Our postulates therefore are not ultimately arbitrary or irrational; they can only be understood with reference to the conditions of life which suggested them and which they are intended to control. And so the ultimate tendency of the whole theory seems predominantly empiricist. I cannot but think also that Dr. Schultz's zeal on behalf of the old conception of substance, and his consequent preference of atomism to energetics, is strategically a mistake. It brings him into needless op- position to the most fruitful and progressive tendencies of modern physics. I heartily agree of course that our immediate consciousness of self-existence has served as the anthropomorphic model for the con- struction of the conception of substance; also that it subsequently turns out that, as developed, it is not applicable to the stream of psychic events and that a soul-atom is psychologically useless, nay, impossible. But in a consistent Humanist this result should arouse suspicions of something wrong in a conception which thus stultifies itself. And such suspicions are promptly justified when it turns out that the material ectype of the substance-soul, the atom, is no less superfluous than its prototype. The physicists therefore of the 'energetic' school have performed a great service to science by showing that the substrate-atom may be dispensed with. But does not this destroy all substance and plunge us anew into chaos ? The fear is groundless, though it might terrify those who knew no better psychology than Hume's. If neither psychical nor physical processes really exhibit to us the operation of ' substances' such as we had conceived, why not simply remodel the conception ? Why not apply the name to those features in our experience which have given occasion for constructing the impracticable ideal which is the real source of all our trouble. If a ' soul' is not an unchangeable, unknowable sub- stratum but a self-conscious stream of psychic processes, why be surprised that a ' body' is similarly a phenomenal group of physical processes, and why hesitate to call them both ' substances' in the only sense in which the word has any valid application? We shall thus restore 'substances' to psychology and to physics by the same device, and at bottom shall only be doing tardy justice to the Aristotelian conception of EVEpyELa.</page><page sequence="8">116 NEW BOOKS. The differences I have discussed may seem to some to invalidate the classification of Dr. Schultz as a pragmatist; but I hardly think them so important. For they do not affect the method of his reasoning and indeed seem to be mainly differences in the use of words. Still less do they detract from the merit of his present enterprise, which aims at subjecting the conceptions of physics to sympathetic philosophic criti- cism. If philosophy is ever to raise herself out of the undignified position of a discarded handmaid of theology who preys parasitically on the religious instincts, it will not be by the arts of a story-teller, but by devoting herself steadily to the correlation of scientific results. And that in this direction lies a wide field of usefulness who can doubt? For in physics especially the most startling discoveries are being made. That science already believes herself to have witnessed the death of 'indestructible' matter; if she can be equally fortunate in attending its birth, she may find that the life of the universe is more nearly akin to our own than any but primitive animists had suspected, and that alchemy comes at the end as well as at the beginning of science. And in any case we stand on the brink of a great extension of that regnum hominis which is the final test of truth for man. F. C. S. SCHILLER. Blemente der Psychologie des Urteils: vol. i., Analyse des Urteils. Von Dr. ERNST SCHRADER. Leipzig: Johann Ambrosius Barth, 1905. Pp. 222. In this the first volume of his work on the Psychology of Judgment the author deals with the I analysis of judgment,' i.e., with the elements that are explicitly recognisable in any single judgment. The second volume, entitled Tendenzen der Urteilsbildung, is to deal with all those factors and influences which, like education, society, study, etc., determine our judgments without as such appearing in any single judgment. The fundamental Thesis of this volume is set forth in the preface: 'The experiences of error explain the difference which exists between judgment and the mechanical combination of ideas in accordance mainly with the laws of association'. In working out this idea, the author attempts to steer a middle course between Association and Psychical Activity. With Lotze and others he holds that the laws of Association are incapable of explainino, judgment, mainly because they fail to account for the fact that we can withhold our assent from any combination of ideas as brought before the mind by association. From the point of view of association any combination of ideas produced by the psychological mechanism must be regarded as a judgment, which is to neglect the additional element of assent which constitutes the differentia of judg- ment. In short, Association fails to explain the possibility of error. It merely 'prepares the materials'for judgment. To what, then, must we ascribe the assent ? We cannot, with Lotze, refer it to a special activity of the soul, for in Psychology we can only deal with the facts as revealed by introspection and self-observation, and psychical activity is not such a fact. It may for all that exist, for introspection is by no means co- extensive with consciousness, and we are, therefore, conscious of many things, e.g., feelings, emotions, etc., of which introspection reveals nothing. For introspection is an intellectual act, and therefore deals only with sensations and ideas (Esapfindungen und Vorstellungen) and their com- binations. But since psychology is based on introspection, its ex- planation of judgment must restrict itself to the facts as revealed by introspection, even though it should thereby deal only with the ' acci-</page><page sequence="9">NEW BOOKS. 117 dents' and not with the 'essence' of judgment. Activity, therefore, being excluded, the question is: Does introspection reveal, besides the facts of association, some other psychological fact which rnay be taken as the differentia of judgment? The author professes to have found such a fact in what he calls ' the negative relation of ideas,' i.e., the most prinmitive and simple form of the experience of error. The author illustrates the meaning of ' negative relation of ideas' by the following examiple: I see a distant figure and take it to be a woman. On coming nearer, however, I perceive that the figure is pushing a cart and thereby I recognise it to be a man. Here we have the partial displacement of one idea (woman) by another (man) mediated by a third (pushing a cart). There need be, in primitive levels of myiental life, no explicit judgment in all this, but we certainly have all the germs of judgment. For we have the correction of one idea by another, and of this correction we are aware as a distinct experience, which remains in nlemory and leaves an ' idea' of itself behind. And this new idea, like any other idea, is capable of entering into all kinds of associative relations to others, and in particular it comes to accompany all combinations of ideas produced by the psycho- logical mlechanism. In other words, we no longer simply accept these combinations, but, owing to the accompanying idea of former errors, we now learn to consider the possibility of error, and therefore the possi- bility of withholding our assent, unless we find reasons for giving it. In this idea of former error, which thus enters as a modifying factor into the ordinary associative process, we have the beginnings of 'critical thinking'. The remainder of the book is mainly concerned with the further developments of 'negative relation' in the higher and more complex levels of Thought. Here the author adopts Taine's theory of substitution to show, that the idea of possible error, leading to suspension of judgment and setting the machinery of association in motion to bring up reasons for or against, need not be explicitly present in consciousness, but that its place may be taken by a ' symbol,' such as a word, a gesture, or even a mere feeling, whilst the idea itself remains below the threshold of consciousness. It is clear that the author's theories all rest on his peculiar but inter- esting view as to the limits of introspective self-observation, and as they will have to be judged on that basis, it may be worth while to characterise it a little more fully. It is a kind of Phenomenalism, and therefore con- fesses itself unable to deal with the realities of psychic life: ' we do not deny the existence of will, still less the existence of intellectual feelings. On the contrary we regard the latter as the most real elements of our psychic life. But we cannot discover them by introspection and ob- servation. Introspection reveals to us only sensations and ideas' (p. 130), and, as we may add from other passages, the 'changes' happening to those ideas. Because of this restriction to ideas the author charac- terises his Psychology as 'Intellectualism' (p. 54). The point in which he passes most clearly beyond Associationism is in not merely formu- lating 'laws' of Association, but in assuming that the changes among ideas, and their mutual relations to each other, are themselves expe- rienced in such a way as to leave new ideas behind, which afterwards through the associations into which they enter themselves, modify the original stream of thought. This enables him to trace back all the higher developments of thought to that comparatively simple break with ordinary association which he calls the ' negative relation of ideas'. R. F.

Gedanken und Denker: Gesammelte Aufsdtze. Von Prof. WILHELM JERUSALEM. Wien and Leipzig: Braumuiller, 1905. Pp. viii, 292. London: Williams &amp; Norgate. Dr. Jerusalem is a representative, perhaps somewhat eccentric and inde- pendent, of the Austrian school of the " Philosophy of Immanence," of which Mach is the best-known exponent. The present two volumes may be recommended as examples of the " Immamentist " at war and at peace respectively. The first is a vigorous polemic against the two tendencies of modern thought indicated by the title, Hermann Cohen and Husserl being the main objects of attack. The scope of the work may be gathered from the subjects of the various sections: the Psychological Basis of Kant's Criticism of Knowledge, Critical Idealism, Pure Logic, the Func- tion of the Theory of Knowledge of the Present Day, the Function of Logic. The ground of Dr. Jerusalem's polemlic is his view that Logic is or should be nothing more than a theory of the method of thought, as an instrument for the achievement of human well-being. Psychology analyses thought, History (in the wide sense) deals with its genesis and the development of complex out of simpler fornms of thought: these two, then, form the only possible avenues of approach to Logic. In other words Logic is a purely empirical science, as it was with Aristotle him- self. In fact we may fairly reproduce Dr. Jerusalem's opinion by saying that Logic is simply an applied Psychology. The discussion revolves about two points, the possibility of transcending the consciousness of the individual (Theory of Knowledge), and the origin, meaning and validity of abstract ideas and universal judgments (Pure Logic). With regard to the first question, Dr. Jerusalem simply cuts the Gordian knot: we do, in fact, transcend our individual consciousness in every sensation, per- ception, thought, and every action assumes and verifies a reality inde- pendent of itself. He is able to drive his Critical Idealists into a corner where they must either confess to Solipsism, in fact "Instantaneous Solipsism," or recant their most cherished principles: their error lies in treating of knowledge as something ultra-human, and in detaching it from feeling and from will: it is the will that first gives to things (and to other selves) objective reality: knowledge springs not fronm know- ledge but from the will, the effort to live. In the same way the most abstract of conceptions and laws (e.g., those of Mathematics) derive their validity for all normal intelligences not from the nature of thought in itself, but from experience: they are the result of an adaptation, mlore and more perfect, of our thought to the environment: their origin is the same as that of concrete knowledge: the very meanings of words, treated by Logicians as a prius, are, on the contrary, products of evolution. " All ta.lk of a 'consciousness in general,' of a 'universal consciousness,' of a 'Truth-in-itself' (i.e., one which remains the same whether grasped by men or by Gods), is not criticism of knowledge, but uncritical, dogmatical, arbitrary and purposeless Metaphysics " (p. 140). Such is the conclusion of this mnoderil A lles Zermalmender. The tone of the volume is aggressive to British ears, but the argument is skilful and deserves attention. " Thoughts and Thinkers " is a collection of papers of various dates (ranging from 1888 to 1905) and equally diverse topics-written mostly for the " educated public ". Some are of general literary interest, as those on Grillparzer, on Naturalism in Literature, on Sophie Germain; others philosophical in the wide sense,-as on Philosophical Wonder, the Future of Philosophy, Wundt's Philosophy, etc.; the remainder be- longing to Psychology and the Theory of Knowledge. The majority are</page><page sequence="11">NEW BOOKS. 119 criticisms and appreciations of various psychological writings, of Meynert, Mach, Exner, etc. All breathe an enthusiasm for freedom of thought and freedom of spiritual development. The recurring strains are such as the primacy of Psychology,-as the final court of appeal in all questions of philosophy, ethics or vesthetics:-the conception of philosophy as a Weltanschazeungslehre, not a special study ranking alongside of other sciences, but taking its place rather with religion and art;-the impor- tance of the double method in the study of social and mental phenomena, viz., psychological analysis and historical synthesis: the consistent work- ing out of the principle that all the phenomena of the moral life are bound up with the existence of society, and could have originated only in a social community; the meaning and value of psychical processes as consisting in their tendency to preserve or intensify the life of the individual or race. J. L. MCINTYRE. Schriften der Gesellschaft fir Psycholog. Forschung. Heft 15 (III. Samm- lung). Leipzig: Barth, 1905. Pp. 110. The present number of the above series of psychological publications contains two essays, the first by Dr. Baerwald, Psychologische Factoren des MUodernen Zeitgeistes (pp. 1-85), the other by Dr. Moller, Die Bedeutung des Urteils fur die Aiffassung (pp. 87-110). Both papers have drawn their inspiration from L. W. Stern's writings, on the psychology of Individual Differences, and on the psychology of Statement or Assertion. Dr. Baerwald bases his analysis of the " Modern Spirit " on the order or kinds of difference between individual minds to which Galton, Stern, and others, have drawn attention. Thus in the classical or Goethe-period of Gerrnan literature and art, the prevailing type was the 'formal,' in the modern period the 'material'. The pictorial art of the former laid stress upon drawing, upon exactness and significance of form and outline, in the modern age colour holds the higher place,-richness and splendour of colour-combinations,-while accuracy of drawing has become the mark of the Philistine. In music, the place of rhythm has been taken by melody or tone-mnasses, again the material or substance being valued higher than the form or figure or 'scheme'. Similarly the modern spirit has lost interest in abstract thought, and turns with preference everywhere to the concrete, the material, the practical. The former type of m-iind rests upon Begriffsgefilhlen, i.e., on pleasure felt in the achievement of wide, comprehensive views and principles, or general notions, irrespective of the material content on which these notions, etc., are built. The capacity to feel this pleasure guides the interest and the attention away from the particular to the Idea, from fact to law. Opposed to that type is the concrete, which finds its main interest in detail, in exactness and in mass of knowledge, without regard to its value or its significance. These main differences are worked out for the two periods in question, more especially in regard to the literatures, in a most in- teresting way. The sixth section, on the " Psychology of Mixed Feelings," with the applications in the later section, contains a useful discussion of the esthetic Emotions, the feelings of the Comic and the Pathetic, the Touching and the Sublimne, the Tragic and the Sad. Dr. M6ller's paper, written chiefly from the point of view of legal evidence, discusses the relative roles of presentation and judgment in the 'Apprehension' (Auffassung) of an event. Especially in the case of events or scenes which pass quickly before the eye-e.g., an act of violence,-there are marked differences in the actual perception or ap-</page><page sequence="12">120 NEW BOOKS. prehension of onlookers. These depend partly upon their training in judgment, relatively to the particular class of events. We may be con- scious of what kind of event is passing, without being conscious of the details in which it differs from other classes of events, alnd on which our recognition must be founded; accordingly Dr. Moller assumes an "unconscious process of comparison of the present with past similar experiences "-i.e., unconscious judgments. Rather we should say the decision occurs on the ground of previous judgments, by which a miental disposition has been established: the new impression calls the disposition into play, and the 'Auffttssung' takes place, the subject being uncon- scious only of its conditions in the past, not of any mental factors actually present at the moment. J. L. MCINTYRE. tJber Inhalt und Geltung des Kausalgesetzes. Von Benno Erdmann. Halle: Max Niemeyer, 1905. Pp. 52. This paper, which was read before the section for Methodology of Science at the International Congress of Arts and Sciences, St. Louis, 1904, and an English translation of which is appearing in the fortheoming numnber of the Philosophical Review, is an interesting attempt to find a via media between the conflicting accounts of Empiricism and Rationalism. After a lucid statement of the psychological facts of the apprehension of succession and of ' uniformity' in succession, Prof. Erdmann tries to show that consistent Empiricism is bound to reduce causality to mere regular temporal succession. We observe certain uniform sequences in. the stream of events, and beyond' these uniformities we have no right to go. Indeed, Ernst Mach (' the mnost consistent modern Empiricist in Germany') is quoted as holding that the very terms 'cause' and ' effect' with their suggestion of a productive activity on the part of the cause suggest 'fetichism,' and that a purely temporal relation must not be interpreted dynamically. If this conclusion holds good, then, as Prof. Erdmann rightly perceives, the element of necessity on which Rationalists have always insisted, is wholly banished from causal connexions. Hence Prof. Erdmann makes an attempt to re-establish it by arguing that the necessity in causal colnnexions is the same in principle as the necessity underlying even the simplest judgment of perception. If, e.g., we see a green expanse we are, under pain of self-contradiction, compelled to judge that the expanse is green. In that consists the 'necessity' of the. judgment. Similarly, since experience presents us with the fact of uni- formity, we are compelled, if we would avoid contradicting that fact, to judge that causal connexions are necessary. For uniformity, fully thought out, implies necessity, since if there were no necessity the world would be mere irregular chaos, and the conception of chaos is self-contradictory (chaos a whole without relations). However, though the necessity of causal connexions is thus vindicated against the Empiri- cists, little has been gained, for the Empiricists are right in maintaining the hypothetical eharacter of all causal connexions, so far as we build on them anticipations of the future. We know that a given cause makes. a certain effect necessary-we do not know whether in future experience. we shall meet with that cause again. Every causal law, therefore, on analysis reveals two elements of different value: (1) An element of thought-necessity, according to which like causes necessarily lead to like effects. This is the general and abstract law of causality. (2) An element of hypothesis, viz., the assumption that in future experience we, shall meet with the same causes (and, therefore, with the same effects) with which we have been familiar in the past.</page><page sequence="13">NEW BOOKS. 121 The conclusion adds little to the value of the essay, for it touches but lightly on several disputed questions, and contains inter alia a not very successful attempt to show that necessity involves the conception of force. R. F. ALFRED HOERNLE'. Pythagoras utnd Heraklit. Von Dr. WOLFGANG SCHULTZ (Studien zur antiken Kultur, Heft 1). Leipzig and Vienna: Akademischer Verlag,. 1905. Pp. 118. It is almost impossible to criticise this book. It appears as the first of a series of studies on the " pre-Socratics " from a " purely philosophical standpoint ". It is difficult to know what this means. We learn, indeed, that 'philosophical' is somehow contrasted with 'historical' and ' philological'; but this does not carry us much further. The problem is surely to understand certain fragments in the light of state- ments made by trustworthy and competent authorities who had the complete works before them, and there cannot be two right ways of doing this. As the fragments are philosophical, the philological in- terpretation of them is necessarily philosophical; for otherwise we should have bad philology. A 'philosophical' interpretation which is not at^ the same time 'philological' is nothing at all. The account of Pythagoras is a cento of quotations from ' sources ' of every date and every degree of authority. These are interlarded with fragments of Empedokles, which is quite unjustifiable. We have no right to ascribe the Orphic theology of Emnpedokles to Pythagoras without more ado. We might as well insert extracts from the Phcedo. The section on Herakleitos opens with an apparently unauthorised re- print of Diels's translation of the principal fragments. Then follows a translation of the imitation in the pseudo-Hippokratean ,Ep't atat'r7rS strange to say, into German verse! Anything more unlike poetry than scientific Ionic prose, it would be hard to find; but Dr. Schultz, having made his version, is able to say (p. 96) that the author of the HEplt &amp;atT7S9 reminds him of Goethe. The attempt to show Pythagorean influence on Herakleitos seems to me quite unsuccessful. There are good things in the book, though they are not easy to find. They are mostly in the notes, which are mainly ' philological'. The writer assures us that he has carefully considered the question of miethod, though he reserves the discussion of it to a later date. This is a great pity; for it is by no means easy to see what he is driving at, and a clear exposition of his 'methodological standpoint' would help the reader very mnuch. JOHN BURNET. Ueber St63rungen des Handelns bei Gehirnkranken. Von Prof. Dr. H. LIEPMANN. Berlin: Verlag von S. Karger, 1905. Pp. 161. This small volume is a sequel to the author's Das Krankheitsbild de,r Apraxie (motorische Asymibolie), in which he analysed a case of unilateral apraxia,-a rare if not a unique case. In the present book Dr. Liepmann enters into a general discussion of the nature of apraxia, criticises other recorded analyses, and insists on certain more precise definitions. He indicates the varieties of disturbed action that may occur in cases of brain disease, presents a very detailed analysis (mental and physical) of the real character of apraxia and separates it off from the ordinary forms. of paralysis and paresis. From local lesions of the brain there may</page><page sequence="14">122 NEW BOOKS. result: 1. Paralysis or paresis,-loss of movement or diiminution of power; 2. Ataxia,-erroneous estimates of energy, or sweep of mnove- ment, due to loss of peripheral kiniesthetic directions; 3. Loss of kinesthetic ideas (Vorstellungen),-psychical paralysis; 4. Agnosie, or sensory asymbolie, which is apraxia in the older sense of the term,- defective identification of sensations, either through absence of memory images, or from obstructed combination of these with new impressions of sense; 5. Cortical blindness, deafness, hernianopia, etc. ; 6. Motor (innervation) apraxia, which falls between 1, 2, 3 on the one side and 4, 5 on the other,-the movement is not in accordance with the ideational process, the cortico-muscular apparatus is in order, but is not in the service of the total psychical process ; 7. Ideational Apraxia, where the movement is in accordance with the ideational process, but the latter is interrupted at the point where the Hauptzielvorstellung is converted into the Teilzielvorstellung. The relations of these activities is dis- cussed with much acuteness and the discussion is a valuable contribution to the place of the kinaesthetic sensations or " innervation " sensations in the psychical series. W. LESLIE MACKENZIE. ThYodule Ribot's Psychologie. Dargestellt von Dr. S. KRAUSS. Erster Teil. Jena: Hermann Costenoble, 1905. Pp. xvi, 170. This volume is the first of a series of tractates on recent French Psy- chology promised by the author. It consists, for the most part, of a careful exposition of Ribot's chief psychological writings. It is the work of a disciple, and there is a preface by M. Ribot himself in which he approves of the correctness of the account here given. What little criticism there is confines itself mainly to a reply to the objec- tions urged by such writers as Stumpf and Miunsterberg against various details in the French psychologist's theories. For German students the book will have a distinct value. The chief omission seems to be the absence of any metaphysical analysis of the presuppositions underlying a " Psychology without the soul ". G. R. T. Ross. L'ideal ismo moderno. GUmDO VILLA. Torino: Fratelli Bocca, 1905. Pp. 452. This is the tenth work published since 1898 by the author, who assuredly lets no grass grow beneath his strenuous tread. As in most of the others, notably in the Contemporary Psychology now published in four languages, he is still engaged in critically watching and summing up the trend of modern thought. Under the present title he reviews recent developments in psychology, sociology, history, ethics and metaphysics. The burden of his argument is the revolt of idealism, spiritualism, or volontarismo against the claims of nineteenth century positivism, i.e., natural science, to be the mould and measure and philosophy of the doc- trines, principles and history of mind, character, huinan ideas as such, and to impose its atomic, quantitative estimates on knowledge which is essentially qualitative, made up of subjective values and not predicable by scientific causation. We see the tables turned once more, and intro- spection, which has gone cowering under the taunt of lack of objec- tive validity, rearing a proud crest, conscious of its intimacy with all of knowledge that is immediate, direct, certain. To it, to borrow Prof. Ward's recent utterance, belong facts, to science fictions.</page><page sequence="15">NEW BOOKS. 123 The book is hardly satisfying ; nor is the author satisfied. He has but laid down his pen for a brief moment. The lines that are but opened up call for deeper work and more constructive treatment in subsequent volumes. So far we are brought up against a revival in partly fresh terms of Dualism. And whither is the substitution of ' divergence' for 'parallelismn' likely to lead us ? The psychologist, too, as is right and inevitable, knows his own field so infinitely better than any other, that it seems impossible for him to speak of the methods, ideals and develop- ments of ' natural' science save as an outsider-or at best from the point of view of the science of yesterday. But the work should serve as a most useful guide to those who would follow modern, especially continental, -thought. C. A. F. RHYs DAVIDS.
