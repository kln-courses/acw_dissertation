<plain_text><page sequence="1">MENTAWEI SOCIAL ORGANIZATION BY EDWIN M. LOEB THE Mentawei islands lie 100 degrees east of Greenwich, and extend from the equator 5 degrees south. They belong to a general group of islands lying west of Sumatra, of which Nias is the more important to the north, Engano to the south. The Mentawei islands are at present under the Dutch govern- ment. At the time I visited Mentawei, the spring of 1926, the permanent residence of the Dutch lieutenant in charge was in the large northern island, Siberut. A detachment of native soldiers was stationed in the intermediatary island, Si Pora, and another detachment at North Pageh, the northernmost of the two Pageh islands. I did all of my work on North Pageh, spending five months. The resident German missionary aided me in learning the native language, in obtaining information from the natives, and in lending me the aid of his Christian Batak teachers, who wrote down texts from the verbal information given by the indigenes. The natives of the Mentawei islands belong to the Malayan race, with but a trace of Veddoid influence. The latter gives rise to occasional wavy hair types. Culturally, compared to other Malayan peoples, the Mentawei islanders belong at the bottom of the ladder. Due to their isolation, the waves of early Hindu and later Mohammedan influence left them untouched. For this reason Hindu traits, which were introduced elsewhere into the Malay archipelago and the Philippines, are absent in Men- tawei. The more important of these traits are: rice culture, the smelting of iron, pottery, cotton and cotton weaving, work in stone structures, betel-chewing, and the development of chief- taincy. In the religion of the Mentawei islanders some trace of Hindu influence can be seen in the customs of chicken and pig sacrifice, the communal meal, and the arts of divination, especially that of hepatoscopy. On the other hand, the mythology of Mentawei has remained untouched by Hindu influence. Concerning the original home of the Mentawei people little is 408</page><page sequence="2">LOEB] MENTAWEI ORGANIZATION 409 known. Dr. Karny has surmised' that the Mentaweians emi- grated from Sumatra to Nias, and thence to Siberut. From an account of the year 1621, Karny ascertained the fact that only Siberut was at the time inhabited. The Pageh islanders have retained traditions of migrations to the southern islands, and the founding of the first village in North Pageh, Taikako. At the present day there are certain linguistic and cultural differences between the three groups of the Mentawei islands; Siberut, Si Pora, and the Pagehs. These differences become accentuated in North Siberut, due probably to Nias influence. It is only in the latter region that head-hunting and the use of the shield are to be found. Little is known, however, of the Mentawei islands with the exception of the Pagehs.2 A very brief summary of the material culture and the religion of Pageh is essential to the understanding of the social organiza- tion. I shall make use of the word "Mentawei" rather than "Pageh" in this article, with the understanding that data men- tioned were collected in the Pagehs, rather than throughout the islands as a whole. The Mentawei islanders live in pile houses. These may be classified as follows: the uma, the lalep, and the rusuk. The uma is the communal house. It is utilized as council house, trophy house (for skulls collected in the hunt), reception house for visitors, dancing-floor, and sleeping-place for the men during punen, or religious celebrations. During these periods the men have to keep apart from women. The communal house is not forbidden to women, although it belongs more especially to the men. The building of this house entails a long period of punen (religious festival) and, in former days, a human sacrifice under the center pole. The uma and the surrounding family houses (lalep) compose the Mentawei social, political, and religious unit. Like the Bontok Igorot, the Mentawei village does not act as a unit. Each portion of the village has its own uma, and each portion is spoken of as an uma. While each uma has its own 1 Dr. Heinrich H. Karny, Auf den Glickinseln. Natur. 1925. 2 A not over reliable book was written on Si Pora, viz., Alfred Maass's Bei liebens- wiirdigen Wilden, Berlin, 1902.</page><page sequence="3">410 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 30, 1928 rimtaa ,or sacrificing priest, the government of the uma is in the hands of all its adult men. The priest has no jurisdiction other than religious, and that only during punen ceremonies. Both the communal house (uma) and the family house (lalep) contain altars at which the livers of chickens and pigs are given in sacrifice to the spirits. While it is the rimata or priest who sacrifices for the souls of all the members of the community (the uma), it is the house father (ukui) who afterwards sacrifices for the members of his household. Therefore, while the priest is surrounded by an elaborate network of taboos, the house father also is under many restrictions. The result of this circumstance is the seeking out of the position of rimata by men of lazy temper- ment, and the avoidance of marriage until late age by all men. A man cannot afford to be a house father (ukui) until he has children to help him in his labor. Both the priest (rimata) and the shaman (sikerei) are required by native custom to be married men. If they were single they might break some of the taboos of office. The rusuk is any house which does not contain an altar. These houses may be situated in the banana fields of the men, or in the village itself. When they are situated in the fields they are usually spoken of as sapou, or field huts. Young men, young women, and widows or widowers commonly live in rusuk. The rusuk is free from taboos, and youths can eat what they wish there, or do otherwise as they will. The young people hold their love affairs in the rusuk. This matter will be referred to again when speaking of marriage. Finally, a man or woman who has been put out of the community (uma) lives in a rusuk. He then can take no part in the communal life and festivals of his associates. He is called a si-pu-rusuk. The individual is only put out of the community for serious cause, such as witchcraft. The individual must, before leaving the uma, summon his soul from the roll of the inmates of the uma. While he is living in rusuk he is not allowed to par- take of sacred, or sacrificial, food. All deer and sea-turtle which he catches must be given to the members of the uma. The clothing worn by the Mentawei islanders is very scanty, and of a primitive nature. The men wear a loin cloth made from tapa from the breadfruit tree (artocarpus incisa). The remainder</page><page sequence="4">LOEBI MENTAWEI ORGANIZATION 411 of their apparel is in the nature of decoration rather than clothing. Strings of red-colored rattan are worn, as well as imported glass beads and brass arm rings. The hair hangs over the left ear, and is tied to a knot at the shoulder. The clothing of the women is also very simple. When they are at home in the village they merely wear a strip of imported cloth around the lower portion of the body. This was formerly made of tapa. When the women go out they wear an upper dress, skirts and hat made from banana leaves. The main weapon of the Mentawei islanders is the bow and arrow. For the purpose of shooting monkeys, and in war, the arrows are poisoned with antiaris toxicaria. For birds, blunted arrows are used. Spears were also formerly used in war, the iron heads being imported. The most important decorations of the Mentawei islanders are their filed teeth and tattooing (titi). The latter is done by the aid of two little sticks. On one of the sticks is a vertical needle. This stick is tapped by the other stick. Small pricks are made in the skin in this manner, and the coloring matter, the darkened sap of the sugar cane, is inserted. A convex bow is started on the chin and comes down to the shoulders. Lines are also made over the breast to the pit of the stomach. The hips, arms, legs, and fingers are also tattooed. The tattooing on the women resembles that on the men, but is simpler in form. According to the belief held by Herr B6rger, all tattooing was formerly connected with the religious festival (punen) system of the Mentawei islanders.3 The Mentawei islanders have two forms of boats. The first is a simple dugout canoe, without outriggers. The second is the large war boat (kalaba). The second boat can hold as many as 3 According to information which I received while investigating the Mentawei punen system, the tattooing on the calf of the leg, the back of the hands, and the sides of the body, was the final form of decoration, and formerly was always done at the time of a special punen, punen lepa. This punen was held to wipe out the evil influence of blood spilled in the village. A special porch was constructed in front of the uma for the purpose of the tattooing, so that the blood would not fall on the ground. In the words of the informant, "The blood that flowed from the tattooing was for the purpose of covering the blood of the dead man." The tattooing on the upper leg of the men was always done just before marriage.</page><page sequence="5">412 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 30, 1928 thirty men, is rowed, not paddled, and is fitted with sails. It is furnished with a roof and outriggers. The war boat was formerly used in the expeditions between islands, when feuds were to be settled, or a human sacrifice obtained. It is now still used for the purpose of going to the small uninhabited islands at the period gathered. The dugout canoe (abak) is used as a means of com- munication between villages, for fishing, and by the women in going to their submerged taro fields. The villages are all laid out in the interior of the islands, on the sides of the rivers. Formerly paths were scarce, and the boats served as the chief means of communication. The food of the Mentawei islanders is chiefly fish (iba). Meat is also called iba. The pig, chicken, and dog (which is not eaten) are kept as domestic animals. Deer and monkeys are hunted with the aid of dogs. In Siberut the wild boar occurs, and is also hunted. The men cultivate fields of banana trees and sugar-cane. The women grow taro in fields which are inundated. Sago is prepared as chicken food, but is not eaten by the people. In Siberut sago and not taro is the main article of diet of the people. Rice is grown nowhere except in the two Christian villages of Pageh. The system of religious festivals with their attendant idleness prevents the cultivation of this cereal. The villages that have turned Christian are said to have done so for the purpose of being able to cultivate rice. The Mentawei people believe in nature spirits, souls, and ghosts. The chief nature spirits are those in the sky (tai-ka- manua), those in the sea (tai-ka-baga-koat), those in the jungle (tai-ka-leleu), and those in the earth (tai-ka-baga-polak). The translations are literal. The spirits are not given individual names, nor are there higher gods, as elsewhere in Indonesia. There is however a special earthquake god called Teteu, or grandfather. It is because of this god that the human sacrifice was formerly made at the time of building an uma. It is also because of this god that there is in Mentawei a taboo (takeikei) against the spilling of blood within the village.4 * One exception to this rule is made. At the time of building an uma, blood is spilled on the ground to summon Teteu up to witness the dancing.</page><page sequence="6">LOEB] MENTAWEI ORGANIZATION 413 Besides these spirits, the Mentawei people believe in two river spirits, Ina Oinan (mother of rivers, or water) and Kameinan, or, in translation, father's sister. The first of these spirits is propitious towards the people, if properly sacrificed to, and pro- viding the people have committed no ritual sin. It is probably due to this spirit that the people have the custom of bathing their children all day in the water of the rivers while the children are young. The custom is said to be due to the need of acquainting the young with the water spirits, so that they will not stumble in the rivers. The second spirit, Kameinan, is always spoken of as being evil. The Mentawei religion, in common with other Indonesian religions, hinges on the soul concept. The main purpose of the cult in Mentawei is to obtain health and long life. Disease is thought to be due to the temporary absence of the soul, death to the permanent soul-loss. The soul that leaves the body in dreams and sickness is called the si-magere. The soul that leaves at death is called the ketsat. It is this latter soul which turns into the ghost, sanitu. Ghosts are always the bringers of disease, and are invariably malevolent. Ghosts are never prayed to, except for the purpose of witchcraft, nor do-they receive sacrifices except for the aforesaid reason. Avoidance is practised towards the ghosts, for they alone are primarily responsible for the luring away of people's souls. In order to prevent this, kera or fetish sticks are erected at all of the possible entrances to the village. These sticks prevent the approach of the ghosts, as long as the people have committed no ritual sin, have broken no taboo. This leads to the necessity of another explanation. Not only have all people souls, but all animals and plants also have souls. Thus, when a pig is sacrificed, the liver is placed on the altar for the protecting spirits of the uma. But it is not the liver itself that the spirits are supposed to eat, but rather the soul (ketsat) of the pig, and this ketsat resides in the liver. In one account of a pig sacrifice it is recorded that "the ketsat of the pig went squealing up to the skies" as a sacrifice to the heaven spirits. There is still another animating factor in back of all things, both of the animate, and of those, which to us, are inanimate. These are the spirits</page><page sequence="7">414 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 30, 1928 (kina). All objects have kina. Therefore it is not the fetish sticks (kera) themselves which keep the ghosts from the village, but it is the spirits (kina) of the sticks which perform the office. For this purpose the people give the fetish sticks thorns, spears, and daggers. The people also must sacrifice to the fetish sticks, or rather to the kina of the sticks. Since everything in existence has kina, everything is considered anthropomorphic. Thus the uma, the houses, boats, bamboos, etc., speak, are spoken to, and act as human beings. One of the most important taboos in Mentawei is directed against the cutting of boats and work tools. The kina of these articles would object. Finally it may be suggested that the kina, or spirits, are more fundamental than the souls of living beings. For while souls are found only in living beings, spirits (kina) are found in all objects. Even souls, si-magere, must have spirits, kina, to animate them! Thus the first line of an invocation made by the priest (rimata) at the founding of a new uma reads, "Konan kina-si-magere-mai tatoga-ku." "Come, spirits of the souls of our children." Necessarily the shaman (sikerei) is the most important man of the community. For since the object of Mentawei religion is the avoidance of sickness, the major portion of the cult falls into the hands of the shaman. Moreover, it is the shaman alone who has "seeing eyes and hearing ears," that is, it is he (or she) who can see and hold conversation with the spirits of the altar, and thus diagnose disease. Moreover, the ghosts are visible to his eyes alone, when they enter the village, bringing death and disease. Finally, it is the shaman who accuses people of witchcraft. This gives him the power of removing persons obnoxious to him. The shaman of Mentawei is not of the "inspired" type, as among the Batak. That is to say, neither spirits nor ghosts enter his body or speak through his lips. While he holds conversation with, and is in special rapport with, the invisible and spirit world, still this world remains outside of his own person. If, then, the word "shaman" be used in its Siberian connotation, it would be better to label the Mentawei sikerei as a "seer." Culturally the seer type of medicine-man is older than the true shaman or in- spired type, for it is the seer that is to be found among the more</page><page sequence="8">LOEBI MENTAWEI ORGANIZATION 415 primitive, or more isolated peoples, such as the Australians, the Andaman islanders, and most, if not all, of the American Indians. The seer usually obtains his position and power through acquiring a vision, and the Mentawei sikerei must obtain a vision in order to have his "seeing eyes and hearing ears." This vision is sought for after the youth is warned by sickness. If the youth disobeyed the warning he would die.5 The religious festival of the Mentawei people is called lia or punen. The lia is a family festival, is of shorter duration, and is attended by the sacrifice of chickens. The punen is the celebration attended by all of the members of the uma, men,, women, and children. It is of longer duration, lasting sometimes for years, and both pigs and chickens are sacrificed. The house father (ukui) conducts the lia, the priest (rimata) conducts the punen, aided by one or more seers. According to Hansen, the Mentawei islanders are in a state of punen, with its attendant taboos (takeikei), for about ten months in the year.6 The Mentawei 5 Among the Plains Indians every man is supposed to obtain a vision, and hence all would, according to my definition, be seers. This of course is not true. The prob- abilities are that this aspect of Plains culture arose from the vision quest of seers proper. Among other Indians, as the California Pomo, certain medicine-men are not seers, but practise by virtue of inherited magical outfits. Yet these men are in better rapport with the spirit world than the layman. This distinction between the shaman and the seer has been, to a certain extent, anticipated by Boas ("America and the Old World." Congres International des Americanistes, Giteborg, 27, 1925), who writes: "The belief in obsession is a most characteristic form of belief in the Old World-where it occurs practically everywhere. On the other hand it seems quite foreign to the beliefs of American tribes. Ideas of personal contact between man and supernatural beings are quite frequent, but ob- session and with it the various forms of exorcism do not seem to occur. The spirits may attack man, but they do not enter his body." I have made use of the term pos- session, and not obsession. Furthermore, I have not classified the difference between the two types of medicine-man as belonging to the New and Old World, respectively, but rather as belonging to an archaic and a more recent culture stratum. Possession does not occur practically everywhere in the Old World. Even in Indonesia itself it is lacking in the islands west of Sumatra, in Borneo, and no doubt elsewhere. On the other hand, it is not certain that possession is not to be found among the tribes of the Northwest in America. The reason why I must differ in opinion with Boas lies perhaps in the fact that he has only taken one attribute of the "possession concept," that of the disease factor. 6 J. F. K. Hansen, De Groep Noord en Zuid Pageh van de Mentawei-Eilanden. Bijdragen tot de Taal, Land en Volkenkunde van Nederlandsch-Indie, 174, 1915.</page><page sequence="9">416 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 30, 1928 concept of punen and its attendant ideas is known elsewhere in the cultural region of southeast Asia. Thus the Bontok Igorot have their rest days.' More strikingly similar, however, are the pena and attendant gena (taboos) of the Angami Naga of Assam. During these periods the unit of the village holding the festival is rendered isolated and all work in the fields forbidden.8 It is therefore only the severity of the Mentawei punen system, and the extent to which it has influenced all of the institutions of the people, which make it exceptional. Among the occasions on which punen are held may be included: the building of a new communal house (uma), the choice of a new priest, the making of a new field, the spilling of blood within the village, an epidemic in the village, when a tree falls in the com- munity, and after the killing of a sacrificial animal, monkey, deer or sea-turtle. The duration of a punen at the time of the founding of a new uma or at the election of a new priest is so long (lasting at least nine years) that these two events are usually held simul- taneously. If a priest dies, his successor is not chosen until a new uma is erected, and some married man fills the position tem- porarily. Family or personal punen, that is lia, are held at the time of sickness in the household, marriage, adoption of children, the making of a boat or family field, etc. It may be said that all children have to be adopted, but this is done in the family itself. In case the father is married to the mother, he will adopt the children. Otherwise the father or mother's brother of the woman will adopt the children. The ceremony, with all of its taboos, lasts nine months. Adoption is necessary in order to give the child its legal rights in inheritance. A punen is initiated by the ceremonial washing of the hair of the participants, and the adoption of gala decorations. All work in the fields is then stopped, and strangers are denied access to the uma. The main ceremonial acts of every punen are the slaughter of pigs and chickens, accompanied by the sacrifice of the livers and haruspication. During the invocation accompanying 7A. E. Jenks, The Bontoc Igorot. Ethnological Survey Publications, 1: 206. Manila, 1905. 8 J. H. Hutton, The Angami Nagas, 192, 1921.</page><page sequence="10">LOEB] MENTAWEI ORGANIZATION 417 every sacrifice, the souls of the people of the uma are invoked to return and remain by their owners. During the first nights of the punen, dancing takes place by the seers. The dance is for the purpose of pleasing the spirits, and is held in imitation of various birds and animals. During the latter part of the punen, hunts for monkeys and deer are made, and the sea-turtle is sought for by placing large nets (djarik). During the time of punen the men sleep in the uma, for all sexual intercourse is taboo. No special ceremony concludes a punen, but the men simply resume their fishing on the sea, the women their work in the fields. At the time of any punen of importance, all the work of the people has to be initiated by the priest. Thus, no boats can be built until a first boat is constructed by the priest and his assis- tants and then consecrated. The same thing is true of the first making of fields, fishing, djurut making,9 hunting, etc. This feature of the punen system causes the prolongation of the ceremony, for in case of any bad omen, such as an earthquake or sickness in the village, the work of initiation is delayed. In the family lia (small punen) accompanying marriage or adoption, various kinds of work have to be initiated and consecrated in much the same fashion. Finally, at the time of the making of a new uma, all of the youths who have never been initiated to an uma undergo initiation. The initiation of the youths is called eneget. This initiation is for the purpose of placing the youths under the protection of the guardian spirits of the uma. For each youth taken in, a pig must be sacrificed. Two pigs are sacrificed for each boy, and one pig for each girl. The youths are then given a ceremonial bath, and blown on by the priest. These acts are accompanied by a blessing. Adults who wish to join an uma different from their own are forced to give a pig for punen before leaving their old uma, and another pig upon entering the new uma. Considering the Mentawei punen system from a theoretical point of view, it seems probable that the concept arose from the 9 Djurut is an unfermented drink used by the people of Mentawei. It is made from coconut milk and sugar-cane juice.</page><page sequence="11">418 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 30, 1928 lia, or family system. That is to say, it was the house father (ukui) who alone originally made the sacrifice, and this was done for the blood family, the original unit. Later, with the coming in of the communal house, the families became partially merged in the uma, or larger division, and the priest (rimata) became the offitiating head, or father, of the community. The older lia, or family system, has never become lost. Not only is the lia alone the prevailing form of ceremony at ordinary family functions, births, adoptions, and mild cases of sickness, but it is also true that for every punen feast and sacrifice there must also be a family sacrifice. That is, each house father must carry back a portion of the meat from the communal house, perform a sacrifice, and consume it with his own family, in his own home. At the time of sacrifice, in the communal house, all of the meat is divided equally amongst the house fathers. The meat is not eaten in the communal house (uma), but is brought home to the family houses (lalep), where another sacrifice is made, and the meat is eaten there. Another consideration which causes me to assume the priority of the family lia, is the prevailing spirit of communism among the members of the village unit (the uima). The members of the uma are, as it were, an enlarged family, with the rimata (priest) as their father. Just as in a family all goods are equally divided among the members, so in the uma, during punen time, all products of the hunt or fishing expeditions are equally divided, the priest receiving the same share as the others. Contributions for the sacrifice, moreover, when not for the purpose of expiating an individual fault, are equally leveled, and this again tends to create an equality in the ownership of domestic animals. With the exception of certain insignia of office worn by the seers and priest when officiating (including chicken feathers worn by the priest) all clothing must be of the same kind during a punen period. During other periods, not much variation is shown in clothing, even at the present day. It therefore seems probable that the punen system originated from a family method of sacrifice. Fastening itself upon a culture originally barren in ceremonial usage, it became extended under</page><page sequence="12">LOEBI MENTAWEI ORGANIZA TION 419 the guidance of the seers,1' and presently permeated all aspects of Mentawei culture. Death, marriage, puberty, sickness, and the initiation of all methods of work, became mere aspects of punen ritual. Government, through a system of fines or ostracism, became a part of punen supervision. Communism, inherent in earlier family groupings, became ritually retained during punen periods. The punen system brings enforced idleness, prolonged abstention from sexual intercourse for longer periods than are known perhaps to any other people on earth, intermittent periods of feast and famine, and an utter inability of the people to absorb foreign elements of culture, such as the rearing of non-sacrificial animals (as cattle), or the cultivation of rice, which requires steady labor. On the other hand, it has lasted because of the insistence of the seers, who play upon the credulity of the people. Likewise, it appeals to the group feelings of the people, keeping them united in a brotherhood of faith, a common ownership of material possessions, and an equality of rank and prestige." I will now discuss the family itself, that being the smallest unit in Mentawei social organization. In order to avoid the use of circumlocutions I will hereafter use the following native words without translation: uma, communal house, division of village; lalep, family house; rusuk, house without altar; punen, religious festival of people of uma; lia, family religious festival. Kinship terms.-It must be remarked in the first place, that there is no "Malayan" system of kinship. Morgan very incorrectly assumed the existence of a simple kinship system by generation, which was comparable to the Polynesian, and which extended over the whole of Indonesia.1'2 Such a concept could only hold true of the Philippines, Borneo, Celebes, and the Moluccas, where 10 The seers are the chief profiteers of the punen, especially when the sacrifices are given for the purpose of curing. They and the priests do little work beyond the ceremonial. In a written account of shamanism in Mentawei, which I received from two seers, these men claimed that it was because of the spirit communications coming through the seers that the people of Mentawei have so many taboos. 11 So great is the feeling of equality in Mentawei, that if a man excels in the hunt or fishing, he is liable to be accused of witchcraft and put to death. 12 L. H. Morgan, Ancient Society, 418.</page><page sequence="13">420 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 30, 1928 sib systems are lacking. Sumatra, with the exception of the low nomadic tribes, has either patrilineal or matrilineal sibs. The islands to the west of Sumatra have, in general, sib systems. In Java it seems probable that earlier sib systems have been wiped out by the higher culture of the peoples. In Mentawei itself the kinship terms are such as could be used in a sib system, but no trace of such a system is existent. Kruyt has already published the Mentawei kinship termin- ology.'3 I have checked this up, and am giving some additions. The word ukui is used in Pageh for father. It also indicates that a man belongs to the married men's age class. Father's sister's husband and mother's sister's husband are also spoken of as ukui. The word ama (a more general term for father in Indonesian) is used in Siberut. In Pageh the word ama is only used in compounds indicating father, as togat si-ama-et, a child who has a human father, or a human being. Ina is the common word for mother throughout the Mentawei islands. Father's brother's wife is also called ina. A man calls his father's sister ina in address. Ta-ina, not mother, is used in address for son or daughter. Uncles are differentiated from father and from each other. Badja is the term for father's brother. This term is also applied to any old man or woman, the root being old. Thus, pu-babadja, to live to an old age. The paternal uncle, however, is not fully differentiated from the father, for both ukui and ama are used in terms of address. Mother's brother is kamaman, and the reciprocal used in address is ta-kamaman. Father's sister is called kameinan and mother's sister kalabai. According to Kruyt, mother's brother and mother's sister are addressed also by their sister's children as ukui and ina. A specially close relationship exists only between a boy and his kamaman. A man calls his nephews or nieces through his sister bua. The verb form of the word bua, bua-ake, means to bear fruit. A child can speak of his grandparents as si-bubuakat. The nephews and nieces through a man's brother are called momoi. A woman reverses the words bua 13 Alb. C. Kruyt, De Mentawaiers. Tijdschrift voor Indische Taal, Land en Volkenkunde, 2 ff, 1923.</page><page sequence="14">LOEB] MENTAWEI ORGANIZATION 421 and momoi, depending on whether the children are through a brother or sister. A man calls his brother, and a woman calls her sister, alei. This same term can be used for a parallel cousin of the same sex, thus a father's brother's child, or a mother's sister's child. The same word is used for friend. Sara-ina, one mother, is a more common name for brother or sister, and is also used as a term for friend. This term is used very broadly, even in addressing animals. Any person who can neither be addressed as a relative nor as a friend (personal names are not used in address) is considered a stranger (sa-sareu, one from a distance) and is an actual or potential enemy. A brother speaks of his sister, or a sister of her brother, as maniu. But a man speaks of his brother, or a woman of her sister, as si-lat (meaning the other side of the body). In address the age of the sibling is considered when a man speaks to his brother or a woman to her sister: thus, elder sibling is kebu; and younger, bagi. The word kebu used in compound means elders, or ancestors, tai-kebu-kat. When two people are married, they are spoken of as pu-kebu-kat, pu being a verbal prefix. In Si Pora the word for brother is saraket, but in Pageh this term is only used when speaking of a dead brother. The information which I received concerning cousins differs from that printed by Kruyt. Kruyt writes: The children of my father's or of my mother's brother are my patogan ama; those of my father's or mother's sister, patogan ina. The children of a brother and of a sister are to each other taluba. According to the information which I received from the natives' a village census of ten marriages in Matobe (Pageh), and informa- tion derived from Herr Bdrger, the children of two brothers are called pa-togat-ama. They call each other brother and sister, and are not supposed to marry. The children of two sisters are called pa-togat-ina. They do not call each other brother and sister, but seldom marry. The children of a brother and a sister do not call each other brother and sister. They seldom marry. It will be observed that my spelling of the first two terms differs from that of Kruyt. While the orthography of Kruyt defies translation, the first two terms as given to me mean the children of a father</page><page sequence="15">422 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 30, 1928 and his brother, and the children of a mother and her sister. In the ten marriages recorded at Matobe, one was between cross- cousins, the children of a brother and sister. In another marriage the two fathers were pa-togat-ama, and the man and wife called each other brother and sister. Children and youths are classified according to age. They are not usually spoken of, or addressed, by name. A child in general is spoken of as toga. Then there are a number of terms for little boys and girls used in address. Boys may be called si-rou, puisu, si-rue, etc. Girls may be called si-djidji, when under one year of age, when older si-oiso, rogai, loiboi, etc. An un- married man is spoken of as si-lainge, lainge meaning a beautiful body. An unmarried woman is spoken of as si-oko. A married man is called ukui, or father. A married woman si-ka-lalep, the one in the house. In Pageh a man and woman will live together for some time, and may have children, before marriage. A man will speak of the woman he is keeping in this way as his mandri, and the man is spoken of by the woman as mandri. From second- ary usage the term means relatives in general, especially husband or wife. After the death of a near relative, one again changes one's age status. A child without elders is addressed as lulusai. A widow or widower is called si-lumang. The word teteu however is the more common for a widow or widower, both in reference and in address. When the man marries again, his children call him ukui. A grandfather or grandmother is also called teteu, although, according to Kruyt, he or she may be addressed by the children as father or mother. The child speaks of his grandparents as si-bubua. A person speaks of his grandchildren as punu teteu, punu meaning "in place of." In address the children are called ta-teteu by the grandparents. Finally any bereaved person is spoken of as pailot, although, more specifically, this means a man who has lost a brother or wife. A person who has lost all of his or her children is called si-botok. Taking up next relatives by affinity, we find that parents-in- law are called tali-ku (my thread). Son-in-law or daughter-in-law are also called tali-ku. The brother of a man's wife, or the husband of a man's sister is his lakut. The brother or sister of a woman's</page><page sequence="16">LOEB] MENTAWEI ORGANIZATION 423 husband is his eira. The wife of a man's brother is also his eira. The husbands of two sisters call each other sa-ulu. The words sa-ulu and sa-eira are also used for a blood related family. The word epu can mean either parents, or relatives in general. The inmates of a household are referred to as sanga lalep, one house- hold. The kinship system as outlined above stresses age classes. Not only is a distinction made between children, youths above puberty, and married people, but a further distinction is made in cases of bereaved persons. These distinctions are rendered necessary by religious custom. Married men are under many more taboos than single men. When a man becomes a widower, he is no longer an ukui and hence must receive a change of relationship term. The need for this change is clearly indicated in the case of seer or priest, since these men cannot even practise their office if unmarried. It has been shown that a distinction is made between the mother's relatives and the father's relatives. The mother's brother, kamaman, is especially close, in Pageh, to his nephews. In the stories it is always the maternal uncle and not the father who is the natural companion of the boys. A maternal uncle must also allow his nephews and nieces the right to gather the products of his fields, along with his own brothers and children. The paternal uncle is not sharply differentiated from the father, since they are both addressed in the same manner. Cross-cousins are allowed to marry each other, but there is no compulsion. Accord- ing to Kruyt, children of the same mother but of different fathers are allowed to marry, provided they come from different families. This would show that descent is counted primarily in the male line. Personal names.-Personal names are changed frequently in Mentawei, as in Polynesia. If a person dies, the survivors of the same name must change their names. When a person becomes bereaved by the loss of a near relative, he or she goes into mourn- ing. While the bereaved person is in mourning he loses his name, being called teteu, or some similar title. During the period of mourning the bereaved person must lay aside all ornament, and abstain from attending punen. The ghost of the dead is believed</page><page sequence="17">424 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 30, 1928 to render the bereaved person unclean. At the end of the period of mourning the bereaved person is ceremonially washed, a lia is held, and the person assumes a new name. A man or woman who loses a spouse mourns until he or she marries again. In case there is no remarriage the person retains the title teteu. A man or woman who becomes a seer assumes a new name. He will however fre- quently change this name. A child is given its first name before its fourth month. Either the father or the mother gives the name. A nickname may also be given. A person's family cannot be inferred from his name, although these may be ancestral. The name of a forefather or grandfather is frequently assumed, provided the member of the elder generation is already dead. A person who is about to die will change his name, so as not to carry it down into the grave with him. The name which a dead person bore can never be used or uttered again. To do this is a curse, since the name is ghost- contaminated. In former days it would have occasioned a fight. To further illustrate the close connection between ghosts and names, the case may be mentioned, as given by Kruyt, in which the elders not only change their names at the death of a child, but also in the event that subsequently a brother or sister of the dead child becomes sick. A seer then comes in and gives the elders new names. The only cause of sickness and death in Mentawei (out- side of visible natural causes and some forms of witchcraft) is soul-abstraction by ghosts. Hence name-changing in Mentawei is fundamentally a form of ghost avoidance. It is difficult to tell sex by the Mentawei names. Women how- ever are more apt to be named after flowers. A short list of names is here given, as collected by B6rger in Pageh. No guarantee can be presented that the names are not nicknames. The Mentawei people are reserved about giving their names, since these can be used in witchcraft. Names of men Si Ngena-katiri Si Sara-mata Si Soibo-mei Si Gaba-bulau Si Sarat-mulaibo He who waits on the upper river. The one-eyed. He who goes in the evening. He who looks for money. He who is always speaking.</page><page sequence="18">LOEBI MENTAWEI ORGANIZATION 425 Si Tuitui-ake-ina Si Ta-maila Si Gaba-punen Si Telu-malainge Si Maletuak Si Mairank Si Manjang He who chases away his mother. He who is not ashamed of himself. He who looks for punen (long life). He who is three times beautiful. A variety of bat. A variety of fish. An eagle. Names of women Si Ta-anai-si-ake-nia Si Ogo Si Itjo-tubunia Si Oba-osa Si Sarat-sinogai She who has no one there to give her anything. The flower. She who looks at her own body. She who wishes to be diligent. She only is called. It may finally be remarked that no record is kept of the deeds of ancestors nor of their names. Hence it is impossible to collect genealogies or historic traditions. All the Mentawei stories have nameless heroes. Either the hero is simply called a man, simanteu, or else the name is descriptive of an achievement, as Segemulaibi, "he who climbed up on a rattan." Marriage.-While marriage is still by purchase in Siberut, in Pageh the custom is not practised, or rather is said to have fallen into disuse. In one village of North Pageh, Saumangania, bride- purchase is practised. The name for the bride-price is patalagaat, that which is placed in the middle. Of course, with the payment of a bride-price the peculiar feature of Mentawei marriage, the preliminary living together of the couple in a rusuk, is absent. While all the writers on Pageh are in agreement that the bride- price is the older of the two customs, and this seems the general opinion of the natives themselves, yet in my mind there is con- siderable room for doubt. No mention is made of bride-purchase in Mentawei stories. Further, the idea of rigid bride-purchase seems somewhat alien to Mentawei, where both a strong patri- lineal power is lacking, and the idea of purchase does not enter into other fields of social or economic life. Besides, in Siberut, the bride-purchase, according to Kruyt, is enacted in extreme form. If the husband dies before the price is completely paid, his brothers assume the debt. Now in Nias a rigid patriarchal power is coupled with bride-purchase, and it may well be assumed that the latter</page><page sequence="19">426 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 30, 1928 cultural feature was diffused to the north of the Mentawei islands, that is, Siberut. Marriage in Pageh is matrilocal as to village. In the ten marriages reported from Matobe, eight took place in the same village, and two men married into the village. The general rule is that women do not leave their village to marry, for if they did so they would lose possession of their taro fields. It very often hap- pens that men marry the women for their fields. Now in patri- archal societies, such as the Batak or Nias, marriage is patrilocal and inheritance patrilineal. Matrilocal residence and rigid bride- purchase cannot consistently be coupled together, and I know of no society where they are found in common. There is no evidence in Pageh that men formerly owned the taro fields, or that marriage was originally patrilocal. Taking up now the regular mode of Mentawei marriage, we find that this can be divided into two periods. In the first period the man and woman sleep together, but are not allowed to eat together. For want of a better designation, I will call this period betrothal. In the second period, after a marriage lia has been performed, the couple sleep and eat together. The husband then becomes an ukui or house father. While the couple are still betrothed they must sleep together in a rusuk, since the man can- not visit his mistress at the home of her parents. Any children which are born are adopted (pipi) by the father of the woman, or if the father is not available, by the woman's maternal uncle. When the couple prepare to marry, the man must first lay out a banana field, and build a lalep (house) with the aid of his wife's family. Then after marriage, the children are readopted by the parents. Girls are often engaged when quite young. This is called turu- ake-nen. The man goes to the mother and obtains her promise for the girl. No present is given, however, at this time. When the girl is older, the man actually becomes engaged (sere) to her. He then gives some beads, cloth, and armbands to the mother. If the mother accepts, she sends her daughter the next day to meet the boy in his field hut. Even if the mother does not accept, the girl is liable to go anyway. Both of these forms of engagements are</page><page sequence="20">LOEB} MENTAWEI ORGANIZATION 427 considered binding, and the mother is supposed thereafter to keep other men from her daughter. The first form occurs only if the daughter is very young. Either girls or men may be the owners of rusuk. It is in these forms of houses that the betrothed pair cook and sleep. They eat, however, in the homes of their parents. Young men may visit each other in the rusuk, provided they do it openly. Actually, as far as adultery is concerned, the engaged pair are as good as married. A man may desert his betrothed and take another girl. This however is very much looked down upon by the people. While a man is living with his betrothed in rusuk, he is sup- posed to do some work for the girl's parents in their field. He is also supposed to keep the girl supplied with cloth, baskets, and ornaments. According to B6rger, while the man is in rusuk, he must avoid the father and mother of his bride. That is, he must not speak to them. The girl must avoid the mother of the man, but not the father. After marriage there are no restrictions of this nature. While marriage itself in Mentawei is strictly monoga- mous, yet during the rusuk period a man may have intercourse with all the sisters in a family. The keeping of a woman in a rusuk is not altogether an open affair. The man and the woman never enter together. Usually the woman goes in first, and then some- time after the man follows. The reason for the prolonged period of betrothal before mar- riage lies in the many taboos to which married men are subjected. They are not allowed to kill pigs or chickens, fell trees, ram in the earth for planting poles, to eat squirrels, coconut rats, etc. If they break any of the taboos the children would become sick. The most common reason for marriage as given in Matobe was that the elders of the woman either died or left the village. Then there remained no one to look after the children. The next most important reason was the desire of the man to gain possession of the fields of the woman. In two cases the reason given by the man for marriage was his desire to become a seer. As already pointed out, a seer must be a married man. It is usually the woman who desires a marriage to take place. She does not however tell the man directly, as she would be</page><page sequence="21">428 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 30, 1928 ashamed to do this. If however she already has two or three children, she may say to her friends, "I have so much trouble, it is almost as if my children have no father." Then the man is told that he must marry the woman. According to the census taken at Matobe, one third of the total number of children were born out of wedlock. When it is decided that the young pair will marry, and after the groom has the necessary house, domestic animals, baskets, etc., to render marital life economically feasible, a group of the relatives of the man, under the leadership of the father of the groom or the paternal uncle, go to the dwelling of the girl. Here a stereotyped conversation follows. The father of the man asks for the girl for his son, and the father of the girl accepts, depreciating, however, the marriageable qualities of his daughter. Then a date is set, and in preparation for the marriage lia, wood, food, and grated sago as chicken food are prepared. After this the people ceremonially wash their hair (magiri). A prelimi- nary visit which is held at the house (lalep) of the girl takes place in the evening. The next morning the actual ceremony takes place at the house of the brother of the groom, who performs the cere- mony. The wife of this man brings in the bride. The central feature of the Mentawei marriage is the eating together of groom and bride. Heretofore the couple had never eaten together. After this ceremony the pair must always eat together in their lalep. For a man or wife to eat separately would be a sin; this sin has a special name, masoilo, and arouses the anger of the spirits of the altar. The exact manner in which the bride and groom partake of their first food in common, is for the offici- ating brother to divide a cooked white chicken egg in half, giving one portion to the groom and one to the bride. After the egg is eaten, a general feast follows. The name of the egg used in the marriage ceremony is pasailiat kabei, "to change the house hand." After this marriage meal the men and women go separately to bathe in the river. On their way back they gather sacred flowers for the altar (buluat). Then the old flowers (katsaila) are removed from the house altar and scattered over the house, the new flowers being put in their place. Next the people oil their bodies, and make</page><page sequence="22">LOEB] MENTAWEI ORGANIZA TION 429 them yellow with powdered curry berry, as decoration for the lia. The officiating brother then sacrifices eggs and yam (laiket) to the spirits of the altar, accompanied by suitable invocation. Next he takes a white chicken and passes it over the heads of the married couple. This is called lia-ake, to make lia. The invocation spoken is as follows, Akoi lia mai gougou , sisasa tubu-nia Here is our lia a chicken that can fly up by itself, Siagai pato manua. Aili-ake-nen mai samanku samba tatoga. that knows the morning. So may my wife and children be. In other words, the wife and children should be like the chicken. For the chicken flies straight, knows when it is morning, and is, in general, a wise bird. After the invocation the chicken is killed, sprinkled with water, singed, and the liver inspected for omen taking.14 The remainder of the lia is performed by the married couple, aided by the brother. The affair lasts for a month or two. Every kind of food used must be obtained, and sacrificed at the altar of the new house. Remnants from the new fields, boats, and new work tools must also be consecrated by being sprinkled with water in the uma. Special foods that must be caught and sacrificed are shrimps and crabs. The idea is that these give the young couple long life, due to their habit of changing their skins. The bouquet of flowers before the altar must also be changed in the new home, since these sacred plants are supposed to contain the souls of the dwellers of the lalep. Finally, the woman must be taken into the uma of the man, if the marriage takes place in the same village, or the man taken into the uma of the woman, if he be a stranger to the village. This involves a short punen period, and the killing of a pig. Pregnancy and child-birth. "--When a woman becomes pregnant she is relieved of all heavy work. She is also subjected to a number of taboos. She cannot go near a dead animal, for fear of killing 14 The Mentawei islanders are not allowed to let blood drip on the ground. So chickens are killed by wringing their necks and pigs by spearing, so that they bleed to death internally. 15 The information given by Kruyt, op. cit., 41, is complete and reliable on these topics, and I am here giving a summary of his investigation.</page><page sequence="23">430 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N S., 30, 1928 the foetus. She cannot sit or run in the sunshine, or sit with her back to the fire. She cannot tie knots, plant taro,. or wash sago. Certain foods are also forbidden to the woman. No trace of the couvade appears, nor is the married man placed under many new restrictions at this time. He must not however go hunting. While the woman is pregnant her husband must abstain from sexual intercourse with her, nor can he again approach her until some time after the birth of the child. While the woman is pregnant she is only allowed to come into contact with married men. Even her own brothers, if they be unmarried, are not allowed access to the house. There are no midwives in Mentawei, but a number of women aid at the time of a birth. They support the woman, who gives birth to the child in a sitting position. When the event does not go off smoothly, everything in the house is opened, and all knots are untied. If in spite of these measures the child is late in arrival, the people say that it is because the woman has broken a punen taboo. Then, if the condition of the woman continues to be serious, a seer is summoned. Sacrifices are made, a half going to the seer as his payment, and a cure affected in the usual manner. The seer brings with him his bells, a basin of water, and plants with life- giving qualities. The seer tinkles his bells, sings incantations, and urges his guardian spirits, perhaps the wood spirits (tai-ka-leleu), to descend into the water. The plants are mashed up and put into the water, and the woman is then made to drink some of it, the remainder beiig poured over her as a bath. Finally the soul of the woman is invoked to return, and the cure is at an end. After the child is born the navel string is cut with a knife by the women. The placenta is covered with ashes, placed in a bam- boo cooker, and preserved above the fireplace. Children born dead, si-laelae, are cast out into the wilderness. If the mother dies in childbirth, the child is strangled and buried with her. Otherwise the mother would come back looking for the child. The ghost of such a mother is considered more dangerous than other ghosts, but the body is disposed of in the usual manner, being either deposited on a platform or buried. In Nias, when a mother gives birth .to twins, the pair are usually killed, but in</page><page sequence="24">LOEB] MENTAWEI ORGANIZATION 431 Mentawei the lives of both are spared. No great harm is thought to have been done. Some people think, however, in the case of girl and boy twins, that the pair will not live long, because they have come into too close contact with each other in the womb. The day after the birth of the child, the mother brings the suckling to the river, and remains squatting in the water the entire day with the child in her arms. She only goes home to eat. She does this for three months, except when it rains. Until the child is old enough to begin learning to walk, it is never allowed to touch the ground. The word used for caring for children is. uka, which also means to hold. Either the father or mother must be in constant attendance on young children, holding them in their arms. The adoption of the child.-After the birth of a child, the mother can resume work as soon as her condition allows. The person who adopts the child, however, must observe lia for at least ten months. If the couple are married, it is the father who adopts (pipi) the child, otherwise the father of the woman. The delay caused by the adoption lia furnishes another argument against early marriage in Pageh. One or two days after the child is born, the first lia takes place. This is called lia kabe-bela, "lia for the hand coming out." Chick- ens are killed in sacrifice, and the child is given its first talisman (ngalou). The father obtains wood, and cuts it as small as matches. These are wrapped in red calico, and hung around the neck of the child. After this the father has to initiate all kinds of his work in the usual ceremonial manner. For one month the father must only fish, the next hunt, then make tapa, then start in work on his fields, finally either build a boat or make sago. Three months are spent in preparing the decorations for the child, its brass wrist bands, arm bands, and tail of leaves. The brass ornaments are, of course, imported, but the time is spent in consecrating the ornaments. At the time of attaching the final ornament to the child, the leaf tail, a special lia is held, lia koirit alai, "The lia for the putting away of the hair." At the.beginning of this lia, the hair of the child is cut, especially-around the neck and behind the</page><page sequence="25">432 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 30, 1928 ears. This hair is then wrapped in a leaf of the sacred plant bobolo (Dracaena) and placed in a bamboo cooker. In this cooker the hair of all the children of the family is kept and the cooker is inherited in the family. After this lia the hair on the crown of the head can never be cut, for fear of losing the soul. When the child is five months of age it receives its second talisman, ngalou panake, the shutting talisman. From then on it can eat all kinds of food without injury to itself. The talisman is called "shutting," because it is supposed to close in the soul to the body of the child. At this time the child is also given further decorations, including strings of glass beads, and the hair of its head again cut. In order to strengthen the power of the second talisman, two monkeys have to be obtained. The first monkey killed is called loket, or to entice. The skull of this monkey is hung up in the uma as usual. This skull, as well as all other deer and monkey skulls in the uma, are supposed to lure the wild animals of the jungle, so that they can readily be caught. At time of punen, the souls of the wild animals are summoned. They then come up a special ladder, the spirit ladder, and enter the uma. The second monkey shot is called seukatnia, the cooked one. The cooked flesh of this monkey is rubbed on the child, "in order to warm the talisman." Finally after the child has been taken to the field, and a lia held there, and after all forms of work have been properly initiated, the lia for adoption is at an end. The ordinary time for this lia is ten months, but if the child is taken sick in the meantime, the affair will last longer. During the course of the lia the man holding it, and his wife, are unable to have sexual inter- course, or to attend to their ordinary work. As a result, their fields run to weeds. Still, the proper form of lia is held to be a necessity, for without it the child is not regarded as legitimate, and cannot inherit. It may be said of Mentawei ritual in general, and this state- ment would hold for all primitive or isolated peoples, that the elaborateness of their ceremonial system gained its chance for development due to lack of economic competition and absence of alien mental outlook. Once tobacco, cloth, and oil for lamps were introduced, the natives of Mentawei had other aims to strive for,</page><page sequence="26">LOEB] MENTAWEI ORGANIZATION 433 other work to perform, than that merely prescribed by their religious system. With alien goods necessarily came alien and critical ideas. The Mentawei punen is no longer the same, either in length or in strictness of observance, as that of former days. The natives themselves are well aware of this fact, and regard the past as the Golden Age, when punen were real punen, and the amount of sacrifices furnished mighty feasts to the spirits. Married life.-Since every married man becomes an ukui, or house priest, married life in Mentawei is in itself somewhat of a sacrament. Hence it is not surprising to find that divorce is either absent, or at least very rare. I heard of only one case of divorce in Pageh, and that was occasioned by the husband's turning Chris- tian. The altar was desecrated, the man placed outside of the uma, and the wife considered that she had no choice but that of taking her children and fleeing. Naturally the felicity of married life is no greater in Pageh than elsewhere, and wives, when dis- pleased, are apt to run away; husbands, to avoid their spouses. In the history of ten marriages in Matobe, three of the wives had on occasion run away from their husbands. One of the wives ran away five times, another three times. The sec6nd wife stayed away for a period of five months on one occasion. In the case of a wife's running away at her own will, it is not in accordance with custom for the husband to seek her return. She must do this of her own accord. Adultery is said to-have been formerly punished by death, now by the confiscation of property by the family of the wronged party. I heard of no certain cases of adultery in Matobe. One woman was said to have committed the sin with her grown-up stepson. But this was mere gossip. Adultery certainly was very rare. One finds that in Mentawei the same good qualities are re- spected in both men and women, the same bad qualities despised. A popular Mentaweian is one who obeys the punen rules, is socia- ble, a good worker, generous to members of the uma and to rela- tives, good-tempered and jovial. People who steal, change boundaries, indulge in witchcraft, or are greedy, are held in disfavor. UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, BERKELEY, CALIFORNTA</page></plain_text>
