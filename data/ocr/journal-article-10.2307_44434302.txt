Stein Insurance Institute for Highway Safety John J. O'Neill Maryland State Police ABSTRACT The Maryland State Police, in cooperation with Saint -Gobain Vitrage and the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, installed anti-lacerative Securiflex Inner Guard windshields in a number of their new vehicles. The exposure and visibility characteristics of these windshields have been monitored and compared to the experience of standard HPR windshields of similar vehicles in the fleet. The performance of the Securiflex windshields has shown visibility properties similar to standard windshields. More importantly, the superior safety characteristics of the Securiflex windshield prevented a Maryland State trooper from recieving lacerative injuries as the result of a collision in which his vehicle struck the rear of another vehicle. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has estimated that anti-lacerative windshields such as the Securiflex windshield could eliminate over 170,000 lacerative injuries each year resulting in an annual medical cost savings of over $10 million. MOTOR VEHICLE CRASHES ARE THE LEADING CAUSE of severe head and facial injuries. More than 600,000 such injuries result from crashes each year (1)*. Passenger cars are involved in more than 85 percent of these crashes and their occupants account for approximately half of all hospital-treated facial injuries associated with crashes (2). More than 235,000 vehicle-related lacerative facial injuries are caused by contact with vehicle glazing. Windshields account for approximately 75 percent of these injuries, while side and back windows cause the remaining 25 percent (2). "High penetration resistant" (HPR) laminated windshields have been required in American motor vehicles since 1968. This *Number in parentheses designate references at end of main text. windshield design increased the thickness of the plastic interlayer compared to earlier construction and was designed to retain an occupant when striking the windshield during a collision. Although this design significantly improved windshield safety performance, the possibility of lacerative injuries still exists from shattering of the inner glass layer. An analysis of actual crashes in which the head of an occupant struck HPR windshields has estimated that in a 25 mph collision an unrestrained occupant has an 80 percent chance of receiving facial damage and a 30 percent likelihood of receiving lacerations requiring sutures (3). Manufacturers have attempted to alleviate this hazard by several methods including varying the dimensions and strength of the inner glass or middle plastic layer, or adding an additional inner layer that would contain the shattered glass surface. This report details the in-use experience with inner guard windshields manufactured by Saint -Gobain Vitrage. These windshields are essentially standard laminated HPR windshields with an additional thin plastic layer bonded to the inside (occupant) surface. A demonstration program is being conducted by the Maryland State Police, in cooperation with Saint -Gobain Vitrage and the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety and involves 100 Securiflex inner guard windshields in new vehicles. The visibility characteristics of the Securiflex windshield were monitored and compared to an equal number of standard HPR windshields from a designated comparison group of similar new vehicles. During normal use windshield visibility deteriorates due to minor damage (chips, scratches and dirt) that accumulates. Experience to date indicates that changes in visibility for Securiflex windshields are similar to standard HPR windshields. Most importantly, this program has also demonstrated that the Securiflex windshield has superior safety performance compared to standard HPR windshields. 2.1006 009 6-736X/ 85/ 9302-1006 $02 . 50 Copyright 1985 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">WINDSHIELD TECHNOLOGY Since 1966, the HPR windshield has been standard in all American vehicles. This windshield is constructed of two layers of glass, each approximately 3/32 inch thick, bonded with a layer of polyvinyl butyral, 30-thousands of an inch thick, sandwiched between them (Figure 1). This interlayer is designed to reduce the potential for penetration during impact. Before 1968, some windshields manufactured for sale in the U.S. were constructed of a single sheet of glass that was tempered or toughened. When struck by an occupant in a collision, these tempered windshields shattered, breaking into many small pieces of glass which were likely to lacerate occupants or allow them to penetrate the windshield. Equally hazardous, glass fragments were retained by the mounting rubber at the base of the windshield, creating a sharp edge which could cause serious neck injuries. Moreover, if this windshield was hit and shattered by an external source, visibility was seriously impaired and a further hazard could occur from pieces of glass imploding onto vehicle occupants. The current HPR windshield has been shown to drastically reduce the frequency and severity of windshield-related injuries compared to tempered and earlier laminated windshields which had a thinner plastic interlayer (16 mil) (4, 5). The plastic interlayer reduces the potential for penetration and for broken glass falling onto occupants. In low-speed impacts, the outer glass layer is usually cracked and injuries are generally limited to bruising. At higher speeds, both layers of glass crack and the plastic interlayer stretches to absorb the impact of the head, producing the characteristic starred impact pattern and a bulge in the windshield. Penetration velocity of the current HPR windshield is approximately 26 mph, which is at least double the velocity of previous laminated windshield designs. Although the HPR windshield has reduced injuries in comparison to these earlier windshields, head and facial lacerations as the result of impacting windshields during crashes continue to occur particularly when the interlayer is stretched beyond its elastic limit in a higher speed crash (3). In this case, the glass fragments and interlayer separate, exposing the sharp edges of glass fragments. To overcome these limitations several manufacturers have attempted to evolve anti-lacerative windshields by either toughening or varying the basic construction characteristics of the standard windshield (or both), or bonding an additional protective plastic layer to the occupant side of the windshield (6,7,8,9). SECURIFLEX INNER GUARD WINDSHIELD Saint -Gobain Vitrage manufactures a four-layer laminated windshield, marketed as the Securiflex Inner Guard windshield, consisting of the conventional HPR windshield combined with an additional layer of clear Polyurethane on the occupant side (Figure 1). This inner layer (0.5 mm thick) protects the occupant from contacting shattered glass and thus has the potential to eliminate most lacerative injuries. Additionally, the inner layer can lessen the likelihood of glass fragments falling onto occupants if the windshield is struck from an external source. The Securiflex windshield has optical properties similar to a conventional windshield. Laboratory tests and on-road experience have shown the plastic inner layer to be very durable and capable of withstanding exposure to the climatic, environmental, and cleaning conditions that would be encountered in normal use (10,11). More importantly, the performance of the Securiflex windshield during head impact tests has been found to be superior to that of conventional windshields. Comparative tests of standard and Securiflex windshields were conducted at Wayne State University in simulated collisions over a range of velocities (20 to 105 km/hr) (12). The tests involved a 1975 Peugot 504 with a part 572 anthropomorphic dummy in the right front passenger seating position. Figure 2 displays the results of these tests in terms of the Triplex Laceration Index (TLI) (which is calculated from the number and length of cuts on the dummy's face), and whether tearing of the interlayer occured. The Securiflex windshield was found to be more resistant to occupant penetration and to have a higher penetration velocity (signified by a tear in the interlayer) than standard HPR windshields. In these tests, interlayer tears began to occur in the Securiflex windshield at 57 km/hr (35 mph) although some tests at higher velocities did not produce tears. For standard windshields interlayer tears began to occur at 35 km/hr (22 mph). There were no lacerations of the test dummy "skin" surfaces at collision impact velocities up to 65 km/hr (40 mph) for Securiflex windshields. Lacerations were present in all collisions involving standard windshields above 20-25 km/hr (12-16 mph) (Figure 2). The Head Injury Criteria (HIC) values (a measure of the potential of brain damage from head impacts) recorded during these tests did not significantly differ between Securiflex and standard windshields. These tests clearly demonstrated the superior performance of the Securiflex windshield under crash conditions. Moreover, NHTSA has concluded that "nearly all lacerative injuries to occupants from contact with the windshield (at any crash speed which 2.1007</page><page sequence="3">2.1008 I. S. JONES, ET AL.

If this windshield were installed in all passenger cars, the agency estimated that lacerative injuries sustained by 177,600 persons would be eliminated, and the corresponding savings in medical costs would be at least $10.8 million (2,13). ABRASION RESISTANCE TEST REQUIREMENTS Glass-plastic windshields such as Securiflex were not allowed until recently in American vehicles because the plastic material, which is inherently softer than glass, could not meet the abrasion resistance test specified in FMVSS 205. This test required that windshield glazing must not exhibit haze (scattered light) in excess of two percent after being subjected to 1,000 cycles of a Taber abraser as specified in American National Standard (ANS) Z26.1, Test No. 18. Although the test was designed to simulate the severe abrasion that might occur to the exterior windshield surface due to environmental and operational factors such as the accumulation of chips and scratches from high speed particle impacts, windshield wiper usage, ice scraping, etc., the standard was interpreted by NHTSA to require that both the exterior and interior surfaces be able to pass the test. European standard ECE R43 recognizes that the interior surface of the windshield is not exposed to the same factors as the exterior surface. Consequently, less stringent performance requirements for the interior surface have been established in Europe, which allow up to four percent haze after 100 cycles of the Taber abraser. It is interesting to note that even this test is presumed to be more severe than would be expected after a "lifetime" of exposure for the interior surface (2). In November 1983, NHTSA amended FMVSS 205 to allow glass-plastic glazing and has adopted the same test requirements as the European standard. MARYLAND STATE POLICE DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM Since 1976, the Securiflex windshield has been installed in approximately 100,000 vehicles in Europe. However, few detailed records were kept of their experience, and although overall reaction has been very positive, critics have questioned whether usage conditions for vehicles in Europe are comparable to those in the United States. Accordingly, the Maryland State Police program was established to demonstrate the performance of the Securiflex windshield under conditions of exposure and usage typical of the United States. To equip the demonstration vehicles, standard HPR windshields were shipped to 2.1009 Saint -Gobain Vitrage for application of the plastic inner guard and then returned to the Maryland State Police. The design of the program involved retrofiting Securiflex windshields to a number of new vehicles being incorporated into the police fleet. The vehicles were distributed among 19 barracks throughout the state and a similar number of vehicles were then designated in each location to be monitored for comparison. No special procedures, adhesives or sealants were required to install the Securiflex windshields in the demonstration fleet. The first windshields were installed in new Plymouth Gran Fury police vehicles during October 1981. By the summer of 1982, a total of 50 Gran Fury's had been equipped. Beginning in the fall of 1982, Securiflex windshields were installed in 50 new Ford LTD's, bringing the number of Securiflex equipped vehicles in the program to 100. The comparison group comprised 50 Gran Fury and 50 Ford LTD vehicles with standard windshields. Records were kept of the dates of installation and odometer readings of Securif lex-equipped vehicles, as well as the odometer readings of comparison vehicles (14). All of the windshields were inspected for noticeable damage (e.g., chips and scratches) which was recorded on special forms. The visibility characteristics of the windshields were assessed using a portable ref lectometer to measure the "gloss" of the windshield surfaces (see Appendix). This instrument measures the reflective properties of the windshield surfaces. As the windshield surfaces accumulate dirt, chips and scratches during exposure, their visibility decreases so that the gloss value which measures the amount of reflected light will also decrease. Changes in windshield haze, the property used to assess the abrasion resistance of windshield surfaces as specified in FMVSS 205, can be derived from these gloss measurements (see Appendix). Gloss measurements were taken directly in front of the driver and front seat passenger positions and on the inside and outside surfaces. To insure a consistent and repeatable procedure, these measurements were taken using a template with cut-out sections to accomodate the measuring apparatus. Also these measurements were taken by the same two officers. Gloss measurements were taken of the Securiflex windshields immediately after their installation. At the same time measurements were taken of the standard windshields to serve as baseline values for comparison. RESULTS OF INSPECTIONS OF SECURIFLEX AND STANDARD WINDSHIELDS Inspections including gloss measurements were performed in May 1983 on available Gran Fury vehicles. These</page><page sequence="5">2.1010 inspections provided at least a second gloss measurement of 47 Securiflex windshields and 43 standard windshields. Through May 1983, the average exposure of the windshields was 37,395 miles driven during 15 months for standard windshields and 37,443 miles driven during 13 months for Securiflex windshields U5). . ^ Ł The gloss data were summarized . ^ Ł by computing an overall gloss value (average of driver and passenger side measurements) for each windshield surface. Initial and May 1983 values were compared and their differences converted to changes in windshield haze (see Appendix). Table 1 shows changes in percent haze attributable to surfaces of Securiflex and standard windshields. The outside glass surfaces of both types experienced larger increases in haze than the interior surfaces. This is to be expected because of the more severe exposure of outside surfaces to precipitation, wiper action, scraping, and high speed impacts of small objects. The inside Securiflex surfaces had lower increased haze than standard glass surfaces, indicating less reduction in visibility. However, this difference was not statistically significant. Further analysis indicated that the differences in the increased haze of the two windshield types was not influenced by difference in miles driven or vehicle locations. The increased haze experienced by all of the these vehicles was well within expected levels. I. S. JONES/ ET AL. Comments about the inside surfaces of the Securiflex and comparison windshields did not differ, except that several of the Securiflex plastic layers had been gouged by the radar units placed on the dashboards. These marks were located in the bottom-center portion of the windshield, well out of the direct field of vision of the driver and passenger. Examination of standard HPR windshields on vehicles used for speed enforcement indicated small scratches in the same location. This damage is discounted due to the special nature of its cause. Some Securiflex windshields had wiper marks on the outside surfaces. This was due to inadequate installation of the windshield, leaving a gap in the mounting allowing objects to be lodged and subsequently dragged across the windshield by the wiper blades. Several windshields were cracked by external impacts from stones or 'other small objects. In at least five of these instances involving Secur if lex-equipped vehicles there were no fragments of glass found on the inside (16). Although documentation of incidents involving comparison vehicles was not as detailed as those involving Securif lex-equipped vehicles, one incident in which a standard windshield was struck by an external impact from a steel cable resulted in the windshield shattering glass fragments into the interior of the vehicle. It should also be noted that several comparison windshields had significant chips or cracks and were not replaced whereas some Securiflex windshields were replaced for very minor damage.

The impact speed of the LTD was estimated at 45-50 mph; the change in velocity from the impact was estimated at 17-20 mph. Although the trooper operating the vehicle was wearing a seat belt, because of his large stature, his chin struck the steering wheel and the top of his head impacted the windshield, shattering the glass in a typical head impact pattern. The trooper was not lacerated by the glass and suffered only slight bruising of the top of his head from the impact. He did lacerate his chin from striking the steering wheel and had soreness in both of his knees from contact with the facia adjacent to the steering assembly. Figure 3 shows the vehicle's Securif lex windshield. Note that although the windshield glass was shattered, the fragments did not penetrate the plastic inner layer which remained completely intact and smooth. There was no glass in the interior of the vehicle. In November 1983, a Securif lex-equipped Plymouth Gran Fury caught fire while in operation, burning the entire right side of the engine compartment and the adjacent vehicle sheet metal (18). The intense heat shattered part of the windshield, but the plastic inner layer proved self extinguishing. In fact, the left side of the windshield remained intact and clear. Figure 4 shows a picture of this windshield. This incident helps to validate laboratory flamability tests conducted on the windshield. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS Although high penetration resistant (HPR) windshields have been required on vehicles since 1968, over 150,000 lacerative injuries are caused each year from shattered windshield glass. Manufacturers have attempted to alleviate this problem by modifying the existing HPR construction to either prevent the shattering of glass by toughening or prevent the occupant from contacting glass. Since October 1981, the Maryland State Police have equipped a portion of their new vehicles with the Securiflex inner guard windshield. This windshield is essentially a standard high penetration resistant windshield with an additional plastic layer bonded to the inside (occupant) surface. The inner layer prevents shattered windshield glass from coming in contact with a vehicle occupant. Laboratory testing indicates that this windshield can eliminate most lacerative injuries. 2.1011 The Maryland State Police demonstration fleet consists of 100 Securiflex equipped vehicles, 50 Gran Fury Plymouths (1981 model) and 50 Ford LTD 's (1982 model), and similar groups of vehicles designated for comparison. Visual inspections and measurements of the reflective characteristics (related to visibility) for both Securiflex and designated standard windshield surfaces were performed at the start of the program. In May 1983, these inspections were repeated to update surface damage (i.e. chips and scratches) and ref lectometry measurements of the Gran Fury's. The average exposure of these windshields was over 37,000 miles during 13-15 months . Comparison of the results from the initial and updated inspections indicated the visual performance of the windshields was not substantially different. Specifically, the frequency and severity of the damage to the windshield surfaces (i.e. chips and scratches) from normal use were similar and the resulting loss in visibility (defined in terms of increases in haze) was not significantly different between Securiflex and standard windshields. Additionally, the Securiflex windshield performed as expected in that no glass fragments came into the vehicle although several were shattered by external impacts from objects such as stones. More importantly, the Securiflex windshield did prevent lacerative injury in a crash involving one of the Ford LTD 's travelling at highway speeds. The Maryland State Police program has demonstrated that the Securiflex windshield is acceptable for general use on American vehicles. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has concluded that if this windshield was installed in all vehicles, over 170,000 facial injuries would be eliminated producing a savings of over $10.8 million in medical costs.

APPENDIX: MEASURING WINDSHIELD VISIBILITY The visibility characteristics of windshields can be assessed by performing haze and gloss measurements. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 205 specifies that in evaluating the abrasion characteristics of glazing materials, visibility measurements are to be conducted with a hazemeter in accordance with American National Standard "Safety Code for Glazing Materials for Motor Vehicles Operating on Land Highways" (Z26 . 1-1966) . This device passes light through a glazing specimen and measures the proportion of scattered light, referred to as "haze" which is expressed as a percentage. There has been little research to assess the effect of haze on visibility. The requirements of the standard specify no more than two percent haze after 1,000 cycles of a Taber abraser which simulates abrasive action that the glazing might encounter. However, a</page><page sequence="9">2.1014 I. S. JONES, ET AL. recent study (1)* concluded that it was not uncommon for drivers to operate their vehicles with substantial amounts of haze (4 percent or greater) on the windshields. This study also attempted to assess the significance of haze and concluded that four percent does not represent significant impairment to visibility compared to minimal haze levels. Gloss rather than haze measurements were used to assess the experience of the Securiflex windshields because they do not require a laboratory setting and it is possible to attribute changes in visibility to the specific windshield surface measured (i.e., inside/outside). Gloss measurements were performed with a portable ref lectometer, model LMG 010/60°, manufactured by Dr. B. Lange, West Germany (Figure 1). The device projects a beam of light against a surface and measures the amount of light that is reflected "perfectly" at the same angle as incidence. As the surface becomes abraded, less light is perfectly reflected and the gloss value decreases. Before measurements are taken, the apparatus is calibrated with a standard smooth surface. Ref lectometer measurements are affected by several surface characteristics (2). The surface must be clean (the Maryland State Police used commercially available cleaners such as Windex). The measurement is also affected by the curvature of the surface, so a special template was fabricated to be attached with suction cups to the outside surface of the windshields centered on the mounting for the rear view mirror (Figure 2). Cut out areas were provided for locating the head of the ref lectometer. When the head was on one surface of the windshield, the opposite surface was covered by a black cloth to prevent extraneous light from affecting the measurement. Figures 3 and 4 show two views of the set up for a gloss measurement of the outside surface of a windshield. The template assures that the measurements were taken directly in front of the driver and front seat passenger positions on the inside and outside surfaces. (Gloss measurements on glass surfaces of the windshield will be greater than for the plastic inner guard because the refractive index for the windshield glass is greater than the plastic inner guard, 1.52 compared to 1 . 50 . ) The gloss values obtained during the project have been very stable. The accuracy of the instrument is + 1 percent. Gloss values of the order of 100 have been recorded, indicating that the accuracy of the gloss values were + 1 gloss unit. The variability of gloss values between windshields was minimal, with a vast majority (80 percent) of ♦Number in parentheses designate references at end of appendix. the values occurring within a limited range (typically 10 gloss units) (3). As expected, the exterior windshield surfaces had larger changes in gloss values than the interior surfaces indicating more severe exposure (e.g. wipers, high speed impacts by particles, precipitation, etc.). Laboratory tests (4) have derived the relationship between changes in gloss value and changes in percent haze. The increase in percent haze can be derived from the following linear equations: Outside Surface (Glass) AH0 = (Gi - G2)o 3 Inside Surface (Securiflex Plastic Inner Layer) AH i = (Gi - G2)i 2 Where Gi and G2 are the Gloss measurements of the initial haze-free windshield surface and subsequent exposed surfaces, respectively.
