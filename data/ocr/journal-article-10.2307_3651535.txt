<plain_text><page sequence="1">Objects of Love and Decay: Colonial Photographs in a Postcolonial Archive Liam Buckley James Madison University I try to wrest myself from the amorous Image-repertoire: but the Image-repertoire burns underneath, like an incompletely extinguished peat fire; it catches again; what was renounced reappears; out of the hasty grave suddenly breaks a long cry. -Roland Barthes, A Lover's Discourse Research into colonial photography is frequently a forensic exercise: we "read" photographs as documents and extract historical information that offers insight into the context, time, and place of the original production and distribution of the images (e.g., Alloula 1986; Edwards 1992; Monti 1987; Ryan 1997). With few exceptions (Edwards 2001; Gordon 1997), the "social lives" of colonial photographs, as well as the places they currently inhabit (such as museums, coffee table books, online photograph galleries and auctions, traveling exhibits, and academic books), have received little attention. This article addresses the venues that host colonial photographs after the end of colonialism and how images of colonial life continue to "perform" and "provoke" (Edwards 2001:88) during the era of independence. Focusing on the photograph collection of the National Archives of The Gambia in West Africa, I examine the life of those photographs that were left behind in the former colony at the time of independence in 1965, thereby becoming the archival holdings of the new postcolonial nation. The photograph collection of the National Archives consists of some 2,600 images mostly produced by Joseph Bahoum, a Gambian civil servant, between 1947 and 1956. Bahoum recorded the persons and events locally associated with activities organized to modernize Gambian society in preparation for the end of colonial rule, such as Empire Day parades, intercolonial cricket matches, Remem- brance Day services, and prize-giving ceremonies.' Today, almost 40 years after independence, these photographs are in very poor condition. One afternoon, while doing research in the National Archives, I was told by the Keeper of the Records, CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY, Vol. 20, Issue 2, pp. 249-270, ISSN 0886-7356, electronic ISSN 1548-1360. ? 2005 by the American Anthropological Association.

It was a piece of a page- about the size of a postage stamp-from one of Bahoum's albums. The power had gone down that day, the ceiling fan had stopped, and I was sweating-a piece of the brittle page must have broken off and stuck to my hand and had been trans- ferred to my forehead as I wiped off the sweat. My hands and face were filthy and covered in brown dust. Around me, piles of newspapers stacked haphazardly filled the tables. I would open up manila folders to find small ants crawling within, files would fall apart, rusty paper clips would break, and pages would easily tear. Dirt, dust, mold, torn paper, water damage, rodent droppings, empty fold- ers, missing items-this is the stuff of the narratives of decay that accompany the presence of colonial artifacts in postcolonial archives. At their inception, the establishment of archives signaled the ability of the new nation state to legislate with authority-to keep itself and its citizens in order, to maintain its heritage and secrets, to foster culture, and to grant public access. Today, instead of symbolizing the advance of independence and its "gifts" of development, progress, and mod- ernization, postcolonial archives are sites of decay and loss, serving as evidence of postcolonial inefficiency and carelessness. I argue, however, that rather than being something aberrant and a stereotypical sign of the neglect and inefficiency of the postcolonial state, decay-as well as the right to allow for decay-is central to the cultural practice of archiving. The desire to preserve the national heritage in these material remains signals the transformation of the former colony into a modern nation and the national attainment of a specific sign of being modern. In the first part of this article, I discuss the colonial underpinnings of how Africanist scholarship and development discourse makes sense of archival decay in the former colonies. According to these narratives, achieving recognized standards of archiving and records management is a benchmark of the development of the postcolonial state out of its colonial history. Archival decay is an offence to these standards; it reinvigorates the visual iconography of "Darkest Africa" in the minds of those who seek to salvage what the postcolonial state appears to be ignoring. In the second part, I consider the significance of decaying photographs from a local perspective in which the sovereignty of the state as a custodian of the belongings of its citizens is not at all obvious. At issue is the question of who has the right to look after the artifacts of material culture as they inevitably expire. The discourse surrounding decaying colonial photographs is a lover's discourse. The decay causes controversy because it reminds us of our feelings for, and intimacy with, colonial culture and asks that we imagine ways of finally letting go. Much of the analysis of the archive as an object of critique works within an index of modernity that privileges order and regulation, command and control (Derrida 1995:1-5; Edwards 2001:4). Accordingly, the archive functions as a social model for the practice of police surveillance (Sekula 1989), republican nationalism (Posner 1940), and imperial agendas (Richards 1992). Decay, however, signals the outbreak of le mal d'archive (archive fever) (Derrida 1995:12)-it animates the capacity of the archive to deconstruct the teleology of these models that would</page><page sequence="3">LOVE AND DECAY IN A POSTCOLONIAL ARCHIVE 251 work to dominate our encounters with this institutional space. The very presence of the boxes of worn and dog-eared photographs in The Gambian National Archives suggests that there is nothing inevitable or natural about photographic depictions of the colonial past becoming objects of treasured heritage. Because they are archived objects, colonial photographs exist within a highly restricted sphere of social activity. By law, these items have prestige in that they are disengaged from circulation and exchange (Bohannon 1955; Kopytoff 1986). Before they enter the archive, objects move out of a current, active stage (during which they are used and modified on a daily basis) into a semicurrent, and finally into a noncurrent stage when they are appraised in terms of their value (legal, historical, administrative, or evidential) and eligibility for permanent preservation or permanent "retirement" (i.e., destruction; Angel 1968). As with the restrictions surrounding any other prestigious item, archived colonial photographs are moni- tored by a range of moral expectations and competing conceptions as to their value. Gaining the "reader's ticket" granting access to archived material requires that a person follow the rules when in the presence of objects capable of decay. In the reader's room of The Gambian National Archives, a page of rules hangs on the wall. The visitor initially submits to the orders and prohibitions on signing the application for the entry pass: all readers must obtain a reader's ticket; all researchers must complete a production order form (staff included); and researchers can order only three documents at once. However, staff must ensure that researchers view only one item at a time; each additional item is obtained only by surrendering the previous one. No bags or coats are allowed into the reading room; noise must be minimized; pencils only, no pens; no eating or smoking is permitted, no marking or defacing of documents; staff must constantly monitor visitors to see that these rules are adhered to. These regulations do not rule out the fact that things decay but rather prohibit readers from exercising their capacity to aid in that decay. Claude L6vi-Strauss nicely captured the type of contest over decay that struc- tures the institutional culture of the archive when, early on in Tristes Tropiques, he finds himself locked up in one. Describing the beauty of the room, he notes, "The effect was broken only by a notice board ... containing an extraordinary inscrip- tion ... [which read] 'Under pain of severe sanctions, it is strictly forbidden to tear out pages from the archives and to use them for particular or hygienic purposes. Any person infringing this rule will be punished'" (L6vi-Strauss 1964:20). As this scene suggests, the archive provides a home to the tension that holds state authority and the right to care for and destroy in a dynamic relationship. Archiving and Archival Loss in The Gambia British metropolitan interest in the archival holdings of its colonies began in the mid-1930s. Working through the British Secretary of State for the Colonies, the Institute of Intellectual Co-Operation (a branch of the League of Nations) sent out questionnaires, soliciting information for inclusion in the second volume of Guide</page><page sequence="4">252 CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY International des Archives.2 The replies from the Gambia indicate that no central archives office was in existence at that time; there was no general guide to the holdings; papers were being stored in various administrative buildings in Bathurst, the capital, or in the Commissioners' offices in the provincial headquarters of Cape St. Mary, Kerewan, Georgetown, and Basse. Public access to records (up to 1885) was only available at the Governor's Office, the Aide-de-Camp's Office, and the Secretariat in Bathurst, where space had been set aside for visits by the public.3 The information gathered from the questionnaire indicates that the records were not in a satisfactory condition "owing to the difficulty of guarding against the ravages of insects and the harm done by the damp atmosphere." Although the replies were substantial when detailing the location of archived material as well as the structure of authority that administered them, they consisted of single- word answers ("none" or "no") when identifying the measures taken to protect the archived material. Given the fact that very little direction had been provided on the issue of preservation or restoration of archived materials, this should not be surprising. No local expertise or training on preservation or restoration techniques or any policy regarding the preservation, restoration, or reproduction of archived documents was available. In fact, no opinion on the importance of preserving documents for the archive was even provided. Although the maintenance of archived materials received little consideration, the question of its ownership created much discussion in the "off the record" minute papers that circulated as the questionnaire was being completed. One issue that caught the attention of administrators in the Gambia colony reads as follows: "In the event of the decease of a person having occupied a high public post, does there exist a right of seizure in regard to documents concerning Government affairs and belonging to the deceased's estate? What is the authority that can exercise this right?" The official answer to this question was vague: it was "unlikely" that any such person would exist. However, the existence of such a person would indeed mean the existence of a category of document over which the government had no authority (CSO 2/3051, see n. 2). By the end of World War II, the preservation of official records in colo- nial territories had assumed a more established place in the work of government. Archived objects assumed an importance that was shared by those who main- tained them because of their "historical interest." Records of permanent historical value that could be seriously damaged, destroyed, or lost necessitated the practice of careful storage, sorting, and preservation. In turn, this practice testified to the modernity of colonial administration that was not only up to date but also forward looking: Archives have in fact a threefold importance: first, while they are current, for the immediate purposes of Administration; a little later because they furnish Precedents and give the Historical Background of the work of the Office; and finally for long-term purposes--the interest (many of them at present unpredictable) of Historians and other Students in the future.4</page><page sequence="5">LOVE AND DECAY IN A POSTCOLONIAL ARCHIVE 253 Beyond the broadcast of metropolitan rhetoric, the administrative experience of colonial modernity meant anticipating a future that would order the mess of the present. In 1948, an official in the Gambia described his work in a "dungeon-like mess of documents" and his hopes of arranging the room "in an orderly fashion." His main concern, however, was that the storage room "would be swamped," and the Gambia colony would eventually need an ordinance to officiate the destruction of records. Contemplating archives, then, consisted of imagining ways of both preserving and regulating the disposal of records. During the independence celebrations of 1965, a gift from Nigeria officially established the country's new national archives. At the time, Dauda Kairaba Jawara, the first president of the republic, noted that the gift would be used to organize the records that had "fallen into disarray" (Smyth 1966). J. M. Smyth, an archivist from the British Colonial Office, oversaw the first three months of work (November 9, 1965, to February 25, 1966), during which time 4,000 items were classified into 49 classes. The destruction of records was kept to a minimum because little of the material was deemed "ephemeral." By 1970, a locally recruited Public Records Committee had formed to monitor requests by government departments to destroy materials (Bahoum 1972). Decay, in the form of the damage brought on by mold and insects, remained a problem through the 1970s and into the 1990s (International Records Management Trust 1996). As a branch of the Personnel Management Office, the rooms of The Gambian National Archives are found in the Quadrangle, which has been the site of administrative offices since the mid-19th century. The Quadrangle is located in Banjul, the center of the national capital, which is given over to the public monuments and buildings of colonial occupation and modem-day government. Constructed as a West African colonial version of an Oxbridge college, the Quadrangle is distinguished by colonnades, whitewashed walls, peaked roofs made of corrugated iron, a wind vane, and a clock tower. It sits nestled between the Anglican Cathedral and July 22nd Square (formerly known as the MacCarthy Square), which remains to this day the site of parades and displays of civic authority. Since the early 1990s, Gambian archivists have been assisted by the International Records Management Trust, a U.K.-based consultancy that supports "developing countries" in managing their government records. The Trust funds all training for the archivists, often sending them to Ghana or to the United Kingdom and provides for some archiving supplies. The Gambian government pays the archivists' salaries. As suggested above, rather than being a stereotypical sign of the neglect and inefficiency of the postcolonial state, decay is central to the activity of archiving and signals the transformation of the former colony into the modern nation. For exam- ple, in 1996, the International Council on Archives published its report "Memory of the World at Risk: Archives Destroyed, Archives Reconstituted," in response to a UNESCO initiative to "safeguard the cultural heritage of mankind" (Auer 1996; Vanrie 1996). The report compiled a survey of high-risk archive holdings in "hot-spot" countries such as Liberia, Burundi, Rwanda, Yugoslavia, Ireland,</page><page sequence="6">254 CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY Croatia, Bosnia, and Herzegovina (Albrada 1996; Biernat 1996; Connolly 1996; Kolanovid 1996; Kovadevi6 1996). The global scope of the report indicates that archival decay is not peculiar to African nations. Instead, the threat of archival loss indicates the national attainment of a specific sign of being modern--one that characterizes those venues capable of experiencing international war, racial or religious oppression, civil strife, ethnic cleansing (and archival cleansing), earth- quakes, power surges, strikes, terrorism, nuclear accidents, and disasters (Fryks6n 1996) as well as independence from former colonial regimes. Encounters with Archival Decay In spite of its worldliness, archival decay fits in neatly with, and ampli- fies, Western intellectual discourses (in Europe and North America) regarding "Afro-pessimism" (Bourename 1992) and the "plight" of African nations after colonialism. For academics, the end of colonialism and the advent of indepen- dence in Africa promised the opening of new national archives and the offer of access to previously unavailable material. In 1960, the historian Philip Curtin noted, "As African governments have become richer of late, they have become more interested in their past, and the outside world has become more conscious that there is an African past worth investigating" (Curtin 1960:129). Colonialism would finally end when its records were put in order and the research period of independence could begin. African nationalism was a friend of the archives, and the new states were emerging with a healthy interest in their "national" history. Compared with their colonial forebears, African officials were more interested in research. Independence would certainly bring "bigger appropriations for the care and collection of archives" (Curtin 1960:130-131). As it turns out, however, the experience after independence has proven that the incorporation of archived colonial material into postcolonial culture has been more problematic than previously envisaged. The memoirs and research reports in Africa comment without fail on the poor conditions of archives. For example, the journal History in Africa has, since its inception in 1974, devoted space to archive reports. With its concern for research methodology, these reports osten- sibly work to publicize the contents of archives that have previously been terra incognita and whose value has often been a "zealously guarded secret" (Henige 1974:2).5 Framed as such, these articles communicate their data in the genre of the travel narrative with its structuring motifs of exploration and revelation (Pratt 1992). What is most striking about these reports is the attention to the visual detail of the archive and the ways in which writers evoke the presence of decay and inefficiency. Indeed, there is a certain sensuousness to the way these descriptions seem to be actually touching and handling their subject matters. Commentary on the postcolonial archive is striking in its studied use of the visual iconography of "Darkest Africa." Here, one imagines oneself as the explorer facing a gloomy, disease-ridden tangle of unfamiliar natural materials and encountering apparently</page><page sequence="7">LOVE AND DECAY IN A POSTCOLONIAL ARCHIVE 255 irrational rules of social interaction. The dominant image that transfixes our vision is one of a foliage-like density that offers both the promise of abundant wealth and the dangers of the unknown, of disease and death (Curtin 1964:58-87). In the mid-19th century, explorers left home in search of commercial opportunity in Africa, their eyes already prepared for what they expected to see and what they as- sumed about "the nature of Africa and Africans' place in nature" (Ryan 1997:38). After independence, the same image remains as a traveling companion and guide. Archives are indeed dark (Reefe 1976:189)-the generator goes down, the lights go off, the hum of the spinning fan above your head gives up, and you start to sweat. Archives are dirty, infested with "voracious termites left for years to eat as they like" (Painter 1985:375) and "who have a taste for newspaper" (Conrad 1976:177). The marks on manila folders, signs of fragility and disintegration, sug- gest that they have "undergone the ravages of silver-fish, cockroaches, and bats" (Smith 1982:372) or the "ravages of worms and other insects" (Welch 1982:380). Standard rules and forms of efficiency do not work in the archive. Gaining the nec- essary permission to enter and retrieve material is often a tedious and drawn-out affair. Archive administration is highly volatile and overly rigid, capable of hinder- ing the researcher (King 1998:408) or innovatively flexible, allowing the bending of rules to open up the closed record (Bessant 1997:402). Getting into the archive is not a matter of protocol but a result of "luck and various complicated twists of fate" (Park 1983:408). In the postcolonial archive, rules regarding training, expertise, and foresight are reversed. Hopes of finding everything nicely laid-out are dashed when one encounters "complete shambles with documents missing or stored in unclassified heaps on some shelves or on the floor" (Reefe 1976:187). The chaos takes on a life of its own, moving valuable documents out of the archive and into the market where they are sold as "wrapping paper for vegetables and other products" (Park 1983:397). Being priceless is not something that the archive can afford. The progress of decay signals the possibility that things are moving forward in time but not according to the narrative of independence that accompanied the establishment of new national archives in Africa. In the archive, colonial categories continue to work at shaping social relations even though the world outside is living in the time of independence-at least, from the perspective of those nationals visiting from former colonizing countries. Visiting researchers thus report with some discomfort and embarrassment that they are accorded a privilege that is "colonial"; they are struck by just how "mentally colonized" the local population still appears to be (Bessant 1997). The archive is an old-fashioned and out-of-date place-a place of leisure that harkens back to the gentleman's club of the past that admitted only whites and tea-drinking blacks (King 1998). In the still air of the postcolonial archive, anachronism hangs like the odor of mold spores. Decay-the sign that things are coming to an end-brings to mind the time when things first began. The informal social relations of the archive transports</page><page sequence="8">256 CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY the Western researcher back to "a time before the professionalization of the study of Africa" (King 1998:406); back to the impetus of the early days of African history whose frontier status as a discipline is reflected in the title of Roland Oliver's aca- demic autobiography In the Realms of Gold: Pioneering in African History (King 1998:409). Dirty, moldy, infested files guard the way to the treasures hidden in "back regions" where no cataloguer has gone before, where you are the first to enter, where you feel yourself become the first archivist (Derrida 1995:55). The collection of African art narrates itself in a similar manner, remembering buy- ing sprees as adventures into dark places and labyrinths, where the adventurous hunted and excavated, finding what no one had seen before (Steiner 1994:132). Decay, then, allows the researcher an aesthetic of discovery and the chance to evoke what it must have been like at the dawning of colonialism, a time of true discovery-a time when charm and innocence still existed because the discov- ery was stumbled on and unforeseen. However, for imaginary Africa (Mudimbe 1988, 1994), first beginnings stall and begin again and again, starting to decay in their beginningness. The sensuous accounts of archival decay present themselves in the imperfect, in what Roland Barthes called "the tense of fascination": "it seems to be alive and yet it doesn't move; imperfect presence, imperfect death: neither oblivion nor resurrection; simply the exhausting lure of memory" (Barthes 1978:217). Somehow we are captivated by the idea that it is alive and yet it doesn't move-such was often the reaction to the birthing of new national cultures at the end of colonialism in Africa: "As the original locus of the human race, Africa was ancient; yet under colonial control, it was also infantile. Thus it became a kind of old fetus always waiting to be born but confounding all midwives" (Morrison 2001:18). These accounts are evocations, written after the fact. Memoirs of archival work remember a colonial period that the narrators did not experience directly and yet are still able to call to mind-a Platonic anamnesis, recollections of experiences known in a previous existence, by an earlier soul. They consist of those forms of memory that often substantiate nationalist discourse and genealogy; recollections that one is obliged to have already forgotten, "of which one needs unceasingly to be reminded" (Anderson 1991:201). Such archival encounters with postcoloniality certainly resemble a form of colonial nostalgia, with all its delusional potential to romanticize the thrill of imperial days now lost to history. However, there is also the possibility, very provisionally, that there is something very loving in this intellectual tradition's recollection of colonialism-always looking back to the scene of first contact, the love at first sight, the feelings of being offended and tirelessly rehashing the offense, the sensuousness of the description, as if there were fingers at the tip of their words (Barthes 1978:73). Commentary on archival decay, especially when specifically related to the fading away of colonial photographs, is an anxious lover's discourse. The tumult of anxiety comes from waiting and anticipating the final loss of the loved object.</page><page sequence="9">LOVE AND DECAY IN A POSTCOLONIAL ARCHIVE 257 Love for the object of study is often accompanied by the fear that this ob- ject will soon disappear. For example, Malinowski's "love" for the objects of anthropology is shadowed by an anticipation of a time for mourning: Ethnology is in the sadly ludicrous, not to say tragic position, that at the very moment when it begins to put its workshop in order ... the material of its study melts away with hopeless rapidity. (They) die away under our very eyes. .... The hope of gaining a new vision of savage humanity through the labours of scientific specialists opens out like a mirage, vanishing almost as soon as it perceived. [Malinowski 1961:xv] In the field of photography, it was a similar fear of irredeemable loss that motivated the work of salvaging photographs that belong to a period we now call "colonial." The honorable work of salvaging culture guided "the appetite of the camera- touting anthropologist who insisted on the urgency of recording the vanishing, dying, disappearing peoples ... before it was too late" (Poignant 1992:42). Anglos quickly photographed Native American Indians who were, at the time, "doomed to disappear" (Dippie 1992:132). The architecture of the Haida Indians was also about to disappear because of "the rapid progress of decay," which would mean that obtaining "satisfactory illustrations of them in a few year's time" would be impossible (Blackman 1992:142). This salvage imperative makes its most recent appearance in the discourse that informs contemporary intellectual endeavors to preserve the photographs them- selves. For example, Jonathan Benthall, the director of the Royal Anthropological Institute, describes his early work with the institute's photograph collection in terms very similar to the discovery narrative of African archive memoirs. He speaks, for example, of "a phase of excavation from dusty basements" and the problems of handling "dangerous" negatives that "were made of combustible cellulose-nitrate" (Benthall 1992:vii). Benthall's experience of decay inspires a postcoloniality that looks forward not backward in time; that anticipates the end of colonialism taking place when the mystification of colonialism finally ends, when we show what was "really happening." Accordingly, colonial photographs would play a key role in the postcolonial exercise of dismantling colonial ways of knowing the world. Benthall describes the role played by colonial photographs in the exhibits of the 1980s, a period of becoming "self-conscious and reflexive in terms of the promotion of 'exotic images'" that "coincided with research into the colonial his- tory of anthropology with the growing influence of Edward Said's Orientalism [1978] and its postcolonial critique of colonial discourse" (Benthall 1992:vii). In other words, colonial photographs played a role in fostering a "postcolonial sen- sitivity" in the academy. Viewers worked to reinterpret colonial photographs and made them "speak" postcolonially, as objects no longer loyal to colonial domina- tion but to the project of retrieving the submerged, the subaltern, the "indigenous counter-narrative" (Edwards 2001:107). Without these photographs and this "pre- cious deposit of human understanding" (Benthall 1992:vii), the history of the colonial that had previously been silenced in history writing would melt into thin</page><page sequence="10">258 CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY air. According to this model, colonial photographs are the very stuff of postcolo- nialism. They help in the work of constructing a noise-free line of understanding linking the past to the present and in substantiating the teleology of a history that one day in the future will be more accurate than it is today. Colonial Photographs in a Postcolonial Archive No one would deny the poor condition of the photograph collection at The Gambian National Archives. In the second part of this article, I consider the local parameters of what counts as decay and what the phenomenon of decaying pho- tographs can tell us about postcolonial life. Most of the photograph albums are falling apart: the spines are damaged, pages are loose and drop out, the covers have separated from the spines. In many cases, the covers lie on their own, next to sec- tions of incomplete albums. When individual pages fall out or detach themselves, they are usually returned to the wrong album. The randomness of their replace- ment is largely because the pages themselves are not numbered, and no detailed inventory of album page descriptions exists to allow for accurate restoration. The negatives for replacing damaged photographs are also missing. The album pages themselves are frequently dirty, creased, and torn. Some of them are spattered with drops of white paint, whitewash most likely. Many of the photographs are missing from the pages. Empty spaces with the remains of dried glue indicate that the photographs that were once there were torn out at some point. In a few cases, there are notes written around the space where the photograph was formerly located, indicating its eventual destination. Many of the photographs are so faded that it is sometimes impossible---even for the archivists-to decide whether the depicted person is a British colonial or a Gambian local. When a photograph is so yellowed, it is difficult to tell white from black. The condition of archived colonial photographs in The Gambia problema- tizes any claim on the part of the nation to a rationalist modernity whose survival depends on the possession of documentation. In September 1999, for example, The Gambian National Records Service (NRS) conducted a five-day workshop on records and information management. At the closing ceremony, the director of the NRS declared that no government body or business organization could survive today without making records of its own activities. He continued by warn- ing that an office would not be able to operate successfully if it "had to rely on memory alone for keeping track of every transaction." In conclusion, the press release stated that the resources necessary for successful records management were "man-power, materials, and money" (Observer 1999:3). The director's state- ment was characteristic of the discourse of record management in which effi- cient archival work is equated with the development of modern forms of gov- ernment and state practice. They also made sense in terms of the ideology of the UK-based International Records Management Trust for which investing in archives is the equivalent of investing in the development of new nations. Today's</page><page sequence="11">LOVE AND DECAY IN A POSTCOLONIAL ARCHIVE 259 archiving standards trace their roots not to the archives of antiquity but to legisla- tion following the French Revolution, which established centralized holdings for all the records of the state and making these accessible to all citizens (Auer 1996; Posner 1940). Although the statements regarding the redundancy of memory might have been true for the management of paper records, the case of visual records in The Gambian National Archives proves itself to be more troubling. In addition to their physical decay, the albums are also "fading away" in terms of the information they convey. Most of the photographs are not captioned, and there is no detailed catalog accompanying the collection. The archive's catalog lists the photographs under general groupings, such as "King's Birthday Celebration," but does not provide details for the subject matter of each photograph individually. The photographs provide no "signature" that can be cross-referenced and identified. "The Informa- tion Officer," for example, might have signed a letter dated 1945. Checking with the staff register for that year would provide the name of the author. The same would not be possible for a photograph with no caption. The archive is bound by law to house and look after the collection as materials designated for permanent preservation-regardless of the condition of individual photographs or whether documentation is available to identify the people depicted in them. The archivists fear that, outside of the archive, the generation of Gambians who would be able to identify the photographs will soon be dead and that they will be left in charge of a collection of slowly decaying old photographs with no names. The director's appeal to "man-power, materials and money" as the solution to the problem of decay, appears at first to fall within the development discourse that gives the impression of holding Gambian archiving in its grasp. The same nationalist discourse would speak of the archive as instituting an accountable public sector serving citizens with inalienable rights (Gupta 1995). However, social dynamics at work outside of the halls of the Quadrangle intervene, revealing the extent to which the universal categories of development discourse can be embedded in a local context but are spoken in a way that sounds universal. Manpower Much to the frustration of the Gambian archivists, the state of the photograph collection is not public knowledge. Indeed, the activity of archiving in The Gambia remains socially invisible. "No one knows we're here" is the main complaint of the archivists, surpassing their frustration at lack of funds and training. As with many of the occupations introduced by the colonial administration, the archivists often encounter problems when explaining their careers to those not familiar with the practice of record management. Archivists spoke of being at their former job when one day they received word that they were being transferred to the National Archives. "I had not even applied for the job when I was posted there. I'd never heard of the archives. Someone had to show me where to go," one</page><page sequence="12">260 CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY archivist said. Another told me that her friends often asked her why she spent so much time working with "old things" and why the government wastes money by paying salaries to people who look after "old bits of paper." Another archivist spoke about the experience of having his job compared to that of a storekeeper (who brings what shoppers request) and to a gardener or night watchman (who tends to somebody else's property and guards it). Those who might be able to make sense of their work to the Gambian general public are rarely at work in the archive long enough to do so. There is a rapid turnover of trained archive personnel. The civil service administration in recent years has tended to move those personnel with some expertise in archival practice into new offices once their training in records management is complete. In addition, Gambians trained abroad in record management, in London or Accra (Ghana), are frequently recruited by nongovernmental organizations on their return home. The decay of the collection provides visible evidence that the National Archives, although an institution of prestige, fails to serve the nation as a locus of power and authority. Furthermore, the anticipated disintegration of the pho- tographs activates a discourse that allows the archivists to explore the structures of meaning at work around them. For example, all that was wrong with the archive was attributed to the nationality of the archive's director who was Nigerian: local writers did not deposit copies of their work; the national TV station did not make a documentary about the archive; the public was not only not interested in coming to the archive but were, in fact, actively discouraged from doing so. The director's Nigerian identity was, in fact, not unusual, given the long- established practice in The Gambia of recruiting personnel from Sierra Leone as well as Nigeria for high-ranking positions in the civil service and legal system. Even so, many of the archivists were quick to resort to nationalist rhetoric and formula when critiquing the "foreignness" of the director. A retired archivist noted that, "the archive contains our history, our secrets" by way of explaining the need to have a Gambian running the archive. Accordingly, the foreign status of the director denied him access to a position of authority, and this attitude was extended to the archive as well. At the same time, however, no such critique was made of the International Records Management Trust, despite its also being based outside the country, but in the United Kingdom rather than another African nation. Archival decay signaled an institutional impotence: This explained why the public displayed almost no interest in the holdings and why individuals refused to deposit materials in their possession. One archivist commented on a Gambian who had visited the archives looking for a photograph of his deceased father (a high-ranking politician during the Jawara years).6 When the father had died, all his personal papers had been thrown into a storage unit and had grown moldy. The archivist noted, "If the papers had been given to the National Archives, they would have survived, and the son would have been able to consult them." However, the archivist admitted that, in all likelihood, the NRS would not have been able to store them, and even if they had, the documents probably would have faced a</page><page sequence="13">LOVE AND DECAY IN A POSTCOLONIAL ARCHIVE 261 similar end. The nationality of the National Archives's director thus provided the chance to consider the nature of the authority at work in the archive-an authority based not only on the right to own materials but, more importantly, on the right to regulate and monitor their slow destruction. Materials As noted earlier, the archive's proprietary relationship With its holdings has been vague ever since the colonial period. Given that it is generally not known that the state is the owner of all materials that enter the archive, there is a high rate of what the archivists would call theft. However, certain members of the public would call it taking what is rightfully theirs. For example, when a department head retires, he frequently takes all the files from his office to keep at home with his family. I told the archivists about my experience in the United States of watching security guards monitor high-ranking personnel as they packed up their offices on their last day--their job was to ensure that no documents were removed. This would be impossible in The Gambia, I was told. Those who leave such positions are high-ranking men-no lowly security guard could stop them packing up folders to take home Materials deposited for holding in the archive were also frequently taken back by those people who had originally deposited them there, disrupting the supposedly irreversible flow of material into, but not out of, the archive. This was often the case for the items of Class Number 54, a "catch-all" category that included entries such as academic articles, theses and dissertations, and single issues of journals and magazines not clearly belonging to any other class. The catalog entries for this class were often amended with notes reporting that the object had been removed, frequently by the author. For example, in August 1998, the file containing the dissertation Government and Opinion in the Gambia 1816-1901 by Dr. Florence Mahoney, the first Gambian to earn a doctoral degree, was found to be empty. When it was discovered that the item was missing, Dr. Mahoney, a member of the archive's board of directors was angry and upset. Rumors of theft and stories of accusations leveled at high-ranking people in the museum and archiving world became the stuff of conversation in the Quadrangle hallways. The following year, archive personnel, with the help of the International Records Management Trust, obtained a photocopy of the dissertation from the British Library in London. When the photocopy arrived at the archives, Dr. Mahoney withdrew it from public access and returned it to her private keeping. Finally, for a different reason, another substantial case that questioned the ability of the National Archives to look after its collection came from the Inter- national Records Management Trust in the United Kingdom. In 1996, following an inspection of the archives by the trust, a collection of the country's first news- paper, "The Gambia Intelligencer" (1891-94), was transferred to London. It "had to be withdrawn from use because of its fragile, brittle condition." The trust noted</page><page sequence="14">262 CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY that a number of pages had disintegrated beyond repair: "the entire file of news- paper is in danger of being lost forever." The need to take action was deemed "urgent," and so, "the newspapers were taken back to London to be repaired by a professional conservationist" (International Records Management Trust 1996:par. 56). The Gambian archivists were very aware that the collection had not yet been returned. Within the state's cultural domain that grants proprietary rights, there is a set of claims on the right to care for something or to allow that object to be destroyed. This contingency makes sense in an archive, given that most of the appraised material is actually destined not for permanent preservation but for destruction. The real wisdom of archiving is not a question of knowing what to keep but of what to send to the incinerator. Destroying records is serious business, with protocols and regulations that must be followed. It can only take place under strict supervision in a state-operated incinerator. Materials selected for destruction, for example, should not end up in the market as wrapping for produce. Along the archive's corridors, stories circulate of how people buying loaves of bread have found them wrapped in official documents. More recently, the right of the NRS to destroy records deemed of little archival value was suspended in 1994 after a military coup, which ousted the government that had been in power since 1965. The 1994 coup blocked the work of the archive for the first time since the early days of the colonial period. In the catalog and classificatory scheme of the archive, the transition between colonialism and independence was a seamless event. Records remained opened, and respect for provenance was maintained. Apparently the president who had been ousted in 1994 had visited the archive several times-his signature is on the first line of the opening page of the visitors' book. Part of marking the end of the former government was to cease the work of archive destruction because the new government wished to appear transparent in the public eye. This has lead to growing stacks of boxes overflowing onto the floors of offices and files spilling out of cabinets and drawers. Indeed, the current president, Yahya A. J. J. Jammeh has yet to visit the archives. According to the archivists, he got as far as entering the building but then turned away because, he said, the place was "too dirty." Money For many of the archivists, the relationship between records management and national development would make more sense if the archive actually gener- ated money. As with the discussion of the director's nationality, talk of money presented the archivists with another occasion to articulate their hopes for gener- ating the kind of moral authority their work might have in an ideal world. Such an authority would have enabled them to successfully claim payment from a British woman who had some years earlier copied some photographs for a calendar being</page><page sequence="15">LOVE AND DECAY IN A POSTCOLONIAL ARCHIVE 263 produced for a local insurance company. The same authority would have mobi- lized the obedience of those local writers who refused to deposit free copies of their work, claiming that the government should pay them for the products of their labor. Part of the ideal and privilege of being archived is, of course, withdrawal from the world of money. To explain the effects of this status, many of the archivists contrast the National Archives with the National Museum. In terms of the in- frastructure of civil service administration, the two institutions are separate. The archive is part of the NRS, which is in turn part of the Personnel Management Office. The museum is part of the National Council for Arts and Culture (NCAC), which in recent years has successfully won grants and funding from UNESCO and its World Heritage Site initiative. Many of the archivists, including those who were former NCAC employees, characterize the museum as an institution that holds and displays objects bringing funds to the institution. On the other hand, archived ob- jects isolate their host archival institution from forms of sociality associated with the exchange and circulation of money. I rarely saw any money during my time in the archives. When I ordered pho- tocopies, I would watch my own money being placed in a box in a locked drawer, and this appeared to be the extent of the presence of money in the archive. The concept of financial hardship or lack of investment does not fully capture how the absence of money was understood by the archivists who saw it in terms of the archive's social isolation and its failure to establish relationships with local communities. By way of contrast, in the employee narratives that describe work in the museum, money plays a key role in establishing the social relations with those who produce cultural objects. An archivist spoke of her former employ- ment with the NCAC-having lived her whole life in Banjul, the museum trips "up-country" to acquire artifacts opened her eyes to a world she had never seen before. She spoke of the people she met, the clothes they wore, and their dances. The museum workers made videos and audio recordings and exchanged money for artifacts. They paid elders to narrate local histories that would be recorded. When the museum workers returned on later trips, they always received a warm welcome. In these scenarios, money does not function as a depersonalized instrument existing in a discretely separate economic realm of social interaction. Rather, money allows strangers to initiate and substantiate social relations where none had existed before. Suggesting the lack of an absolute opposition between gift and commodity (Parry and Bloch 1995), museum workers gifted money and received artifacts. Even during their interactions with village elders, money did not function as an impersonal and amoral symbol, but instead established the museum workers in a patron-client relationship with local historians, based on the local practice of remunerating certain types of speech activities (Irvine 1989).7 Whereas the museum employees "gift" money, the archivists attempt to create relations with the surrounding communities by obliging them to donate to the</page><page sequence="16">264 CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY archive. In face of the continual removal of material from the archive, it is not surprising that the archivists considered doing outreach work to educate the public about the archive's mission to house the nation's documents and records. The very idea of giving private possessions to the state to become public property was alien, and this meant that the project faced major challenges. The heart of this failure was a fundamental questioning of the idea that the state was in the best position to judge the archival worth of an object, to care for it, and to establish the locus of what would be its eventual decay. For archivists in The Gambia, then, archival decay actually begins when the state runs out of things to appraise and possess. Local etiquette makes it difficult for the state to call on its public to donate material for safekeeping. Arranging for posthumous bequests is a private affair and not a civic duty. If it is discussed at all, it is with close kin and certainly not with state employees. It is an unspeakable faux pas to approach people uninvited to talk about what will happen to their belongings when they die-accusations of sorcery would be bound to follow. In many ways, then, having an eye on the future is to have an evil eye. All of this works against any attempt by archivists to suggest the donation of private collections. An archivist told me about a respected elderly gentleman who had an incredible collection of photographs in his possession. He said that as an African, he could not approach the man about giving the collection to the archive. He went on to suggest that I might be the ideal candidate for raising the subject with the old man because I was an outsider and my rudeness would be excused. The problems associated with encouraging public donation to the archive are not new. In his report on archiving in The Gambia during the early years of independence, Stephen Amat Bahoum (the first Chief Archivist) noted the failed attempts to acquire the private papers of S. J. Forster, a Gambian citizen (Bahoum 1972). In the narratives that circulate in the hallways of the archive, the agent of decay is frequently the family that survives the deceased-more often than not represented by the figure of the widow who "throws away" her husband's belong- ings: "The people who inherit do not know the value of the material ... they throw it away.... After the man died, she simply tore everything up." The grief of a widowed spouse observes a family-oriented system of loyalty and obligation for which the idea of giving to the state is an alien thing. In The Gambia, the state does not assume an anthropomorphic form; it does not appear as one's parent, uncle, cousin, or older sibling, one's age-mate, or friend-not even a stranger to be hosted. As such it is not socially substantial enough to enter into a relationship based on gifting and reciprocity-it is not able to redirect the movement of mate- rials that are already guided by careful inheritance laws and a respect for lineage boundaries. Thus, the only way the elderly man with the photograph collection would consider making it a gift to the archives would be if the state "bought" it from him. Like the act of delivering an oral history to a patron, the act of "giving" to the state would be a service rather than a duty and therefore required the return of a gift as remuneration.</page><page sequence="17">LOVE AND DECAY IN A POSTCOLONIAL ARCHIVE 265 Mourning Colonialism The true act of mourning is not to suffer from the loss of the loved object; it is to discern one day, on the skin of the relationship, a certain tiny stain, appearing there as the symptom of a kind of death: for the first time I am doing harm to the one I love, involuntarily of course, but without panic. -Roland Barthes, A Lover's Discourse For Roland Barthes, the encounter with a photograph was to consider the question of mortality and the fact that your photograph can outlast your life. Looking at the image of Lewis Payne, for example, Barthes muses, "He is dead and he is going to die" (Barthes 1981:95). But what about the encounter with the photograph that is itself about to expire? What is the structure of that experience? The figure of the widow who destroys her dead husband's belongings reminds us that it is necessary to learn how to grieve and let go of the loved object and acknowledge the reality of its departure. Things of the past, these photographs no longer serve any original purpose, mission, or imperial ideology; they assume no practical importance. Could we now allow these images a more trivial existence-"just some old photograpis," for example? Could we imagine throwing them away or letting them fade out, get brittle, fall apart? If projects of visual design were central to the regulation and presentation of the imperial world, then our encounter with that world was and remains via the medium of visual record. It was and remains love at first sight. Although colonial photographs depict times that we no longer love, they remain loved objects themselves. This love manifests itself today in a "tearful archaeology" (Alloula 1986:4) that is not necessarily nostalgic for the imperial past (Alloula 1986:116; Tatum 1989) but is instead provisionally mournful, recognizing the decay of photographs and their fragile materiality as they pass out of the material world. The final stage of the existence of colonial discourse as a lover's discourse is the sounding of grief. The concept and fact of a photograph's vulnerability to decay has a particular resonance in the National Archives. It calls into question the ways in which people become intimate with the artifacts of their material worlds-as well as the type of love that should mediate that relationship. To love is also to posit an idea of self that one assumes in the act of loving. Thus, the very inevitability of decay engenders a phenomenological consciousness not only of the self but also of the ways in which that self is related to wider social structures and environments. From the state's perspective, this inevitability is an enviable thing. In the National Archives, the state attempts to engage people on the subject of what is best for the objects they love. The outcome can never be obvious because the state-the institution that would love and ask for loyalty in return-engages a loving self that is as capable of being a rational expression of the essence of a person, as it is of being blind, unthinking, and caught up in a frenzy.</page><page sequence="18">266 CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY National archiving in The Gambia animates the core symbols and practices of a system of obligation to the future that does not anticipate the state. The decay of the nation's archived photographs happens outside of any actual archive, in the homes of citizens who claim the right to foster, preserve, and waste the life of a set of photographs. All this might finally explain the lack of captions in the archive's photograph albums. There were no captions because those who originally compiled the albums presumed that the people in the images were already known: "You wouldn't put a caption on a picture of your child, would you?" one archivist asked me. Captions would have been a posthumous bequest, catering for an audience- presumed but yet to appear-who had no relationship to those depicted in the photographs but would still wish to speak of them.

ABSTRACT The poor condition of a collection of colonial photographs cur- rently housed in the National Archives of The Gambia is the subject of a variety of competing discourses and practices concerning the preservation of colonial visual culture. At issue is the question of who has the right to look after the artifacts of material culture as they inevitably expire. I suggest that the discourse surrounding decaying colonial photographs is a lover's discourse. The decay causes contro- versy because it reminds us of ourfeelings for, and intimacy with, colonial culture and asks that we imagine ways offinally letting go.
