Was the usage of the New Testament writers consciously literary, and if so, what are the implications? The theme that links these contributions together is that of continuity between the words and concepts of classical and Hellenistic Greek and those of the New Testament. Study of this continuity is essential for the interpretation of St. Paul in particular, since he stands pre-eminently at the junction of the two 'worlds'. Parts 2 and 3 of this volume amply show the benefits of such an approach from the point of view of New Testament studies. J.G.F. POWELL University of Newcastle upon Tyne FREDE (M.) and STRIKER (G.) Rationality in Greek thought. Oxford UP, 1996. Pp. x + 353. ?40. 01982- 40449. The twelve articles in this volume originate in papers given at a conference in Berlin in 1991 in honour of Ginther Patzig. The editors (both former students of Patzig) refer to Patzig's belief that 'rationality was a matter of painstaking, detailed, minute reflection and hard intellectual work', an ideal that these consistently outstanding articles on rationality in Greek thought certainly live up to. The discussions of 'rationality' go into areas as diverse as physics, psychology, ethics, grammar, logic, and medicine and leave the reader with a complex but vivid picture of Greek philosophical debates on rationality. However, to a volume that proclaims to treat of rationality in 'Greek thought' but contains no articles on topics prior to Plato's Timaeus, one might object that insufficient attention is paid to the development of the concept of rationality before we, in Michael Frede's words, 'meet it in a full-blown devel- oped form in Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle' (3). In fairness, F.'s excellent introduction has a few pages on Homer and Presocratic philosophy, but surely a chapter or two on the earlier development could have generated further insights. Even when it comes to post-Socratic philosophy the reader may feel that with only one article on Plato but half of the articles directly on Aristotle, the volume is too heavily weighted in favour of Aristotle to be genuinely representative. Nor is there any reflection on what might be peculiar to Greek thinking about rationality, with the notable exception of Geoffrey Lloyd, who assesses the extent to which Galen's medical practice lives up to his ideals of an axiomatic deductive science whilst making significant comparisons with Chinese science. F.'s introduction suggests some features connected with reason which guide subsequent discussions: reason is perfected through a method (logic or dialectic), aims at an understanding that enables us to live a good life (ethics), involves a variety of abilities and a basic knowledge of the world, and has its own desires. Richard Sorabji, analysing the 'crisis' in Greek thought following Aristotle's denial of rationality to animals, disputes the last point in the case of Aristotle, though it then becomes unclear how to deal with Aristotle's claim that, even apart from the practical benefits, 'all men desire to know' (Metaphysics 1.1). Addressing issues of teleological rationality, Dorothea Frede argues that the Timaeus defines the soul in such a way that it can grasp both the visible and the intelligible worlds (an example of a tendency in later Plato, displayed also in the dialectic of the Philebus, to bring the two together), whilst David Furley argues that for Aristotle the final cause is an aspect of the efficient cause. Turning to Aristotle's ethics, John M. Cooper analyses the role of thumos in relation to reason and argues that thumos has its own distinctive desires for to kalon which are crucial to our moral virtue and which remain independent of reason even in the fully moral person. The indepen- dence, however, seemed problematic to this reader given that Aristotle defines to kalon as 'whatever is good and pleasant because it is good' (104) and the good is the concern of practical reason. Jacques Brunschwig shows how Aristotle synthesises two traditions of equity (epieikeia) as indulgence and as natural law in his notion of equity, whilst F. persuasively argues that Aristotle is a rationalist in that reason goes beyond experience in involving understanding of the explanatory connections between the objects of experience. Turning to Aristotle's syllogistic, Jonathan Barnes shows the grammar behind it to be closer to Frege's than is generally acknowledged (though Aristotle's failure to identify the logical differ- ence between proper names and common nouns remains problematic) whilst Gisela Striker makes important points about the difference between reduction and perfection in Aristotle's syllogistic. Malcolm Schofield offers a strong interpretation of the Epicurean notion of 'epilogismos' as the everyday procedure of 'appraisal' by comparison of experiences. Perhaps, however, the Epicureans' motivation for choosing exactly 'epilogis- mos' for this job could be further explored: might the prefix 'epi-', for example, rather than suggesting the focus 'on' the experiences (235), which seems self- evident, suggest reflection on experiences already had (contrast 'prolepsis')? Julia Annas finds a difference between Pyrrhonist and Humean scepticism in Hume's failure to see the loss of motivation that follows from suspending beliefs in values. Mario Magnucci does much to clarify Ammonius' interpretation of Aristotle according to which future contingent propositions have an 'indefinite' truth-value, though I am still not sure that the notion of 'a real world' in the future allows it to remain genuinely contingent. In sum, an excellent volume which could, however, have been more broadly conceived. T.K. JOHANSEN University of Bristol GILL (C.) Personality in Greek epic, tragedy and philosophy. The self in dialogue. Oxford UP, 1996. Pp. x + 510. ?50. 0198146760. In this stimulating book Gill presents his mature reflections on the psychological and ethical models of the self implicitly or explicitly employed in Greek epic, tragedy, and philosophy. He argues that, in contrast to moder 'subjective-individualist' conceptions of person- 224</page><page sequence="2">NOTICES OF BOOKS ality centred on the self-consciousness and self-legisla- tion of an individual 'I', Greek thought works with an objective psychological model (in which motivation is conceived in terms of a dialogue between parts of the soul and as governed by reasons and reasoning rather than by subjective will) and a participant ethical frame- work (in which debate on the good life for a human being is embedded in engagement with and reflection on one's role as a participant in shared forms of life). Despite these differences, however, ancient and moder approaches (G. claims) focus on issues which are at least analogous, and indeed ancient views of what it is to be human offer important perspectives on the notions of selfhood and personality which can contribute to their alternative construction in objective-participant terms. G. pursues in detail a variety of topics and contro- versies, but always with an eye on their contribution to his overall thesis. This takes us from the internalized dialogue of Homeric decision-making to the ethical psychology of the philosophers. Parallels are drawn between the 'exemplary gestures' of 'problematic heroes' (e.g. Achilles, Medea), which G. interprets as forms of (second-order) reflection on shared (first-order) norms, and philosophical forms of post-reflective virtue which build on, but modify or transform ideals acquired at the pre-reflective level. Neither the problematic hero nor the virtuous person is a subjective-individualist-the former is engaged in a form of debate on the validity of shared norms, and the latter's goal is not self-realization or self-creation but a life of dialogue and shared enquiry which requires the development of intrapersonal har- mony in the context of interpersonal or reciprocal relationships. In thus involving the reshaping of first- order priorities by second-order rationality, Greek views of normative humanity may be compared to certain modem accounts of personhood, though they differ in not privileging subjectivity, autonomy, and the radical creation of the self. G.'s thesis deserves to be influential. We should agree that Greek psychology and ethics do not privilege the 'characterless' moral self over the individual whose emotional and intellectual development is deeply embedded in mutual social relationships. G. is also persuasive on the continuity between the explicit psy- chology of the philosophers and the implicit models of epic and tragedy. The links he establishes between interpersonal and internalized dialogue as salient con- cepts in Greek thought greatly illuminate the philosoph- ers' insistence on the interdependence of social and psychic harmony. G.'s approach is selective, but it is a strength that his theoretical framework can readily be applied to contexts which he does not discuss. There is, however, a tendency towards over- schematization: the 'participant' account of the relation between pre- and post-reflective conceptions of the good life, for example, is made to apply in similar form to Homeric and tragic heroes, as well as to the ethical theories of Plato, Aristotle, Epicurus, and the Stoics. But it is questionable (a) how closely the 'problematic heroes' of epic and tragedy represent the sort of rational reflection on society's norms that is promoted by the philosophers; and (b) to what extent post-reflective conceptions of virtue in the philosophers can be con- sidered truly participant. In the first case, we can accept that the stance of a hero such as Achilles or Medea is both a reflection of shared social norms and an attempt to communicate; where this communication takes the form of an extreme and apparently anti-social 'exemp- lary gesture' there is a gulf between conventional norms and the hero's attitude towards these norms. But this need not be the case: as G. concedes (314; cf. 307), the hero's stance functions as a strategy within the cat- egories of conventional discourse, and not at a more developed level at which ordinary conceptions of virtue are modified or transformed; his focus, accordingly, is narrower than 'the proper goals and form of a human life' (cf. 238). The problematic stance of an Achilles stands in significant contrast to the unproblematic reflection of a Sarpedon; there need not be the gap between poetic forms of first- and second-order reason- ing that there is in the philosophical case, because poetic reflection may simply endorse conventional standards. In the second case, the suspicion that the participant ethical model is being pushed beyond its limit is raised particularly by the discussion of the relation between the lives of contemplation and of ethical virtue in Aristotle's ethics. G. rightly argues that Aristotle sees the contem- plative life as arising from, reflecting upon, and thus requiring the life of virtue, but his claim that contempla- tion itself conforms to the participant model is dubious. For while it is true that no contemplator will in practice be capable of leading a solitary life, and that Aristotle suspects that collaboration may make one a more efficient contemplator (EN 1177a34), contemplation is not essentially collaborative; indeed, in so far as it is a divine activity, the more it approaches its essence, the less collaborative and the more self-sufficient it will be. The forms of the 'participant' model are heterogeneous, and achieve cohesion as a group only by contrast with the 'individualist' alternative. Kantian ethical theory is a constant target and (nega- tive) point of reference, and G. is right both to reject the radical abstraction of the Kantian approach and to stress the non-Kantian orientation of ancient ethics. But he may mislead when he attacks elements of the Kantian system (such as universalization, impartiality, and the distinction between moral and non-moral motives) which also have a less abstract application in a range of non-Kantian forms of ethical thought. G. gives the impression (per- haps unintentionally) that such notions have no real place in ancient thought, when in fact ancient authors from Homer onwards offer copious evidence of the relevance of some form of these concepts to ancient ethical models. These, then, are ways in which G. claims too much. He claims too little, it seems to me, in limiting himself to the relation between modern philosophical theory and analogous issues in Greek poetry and philosophy; indeed, at several points (e.g. 459) he deliberately eschews any wider (cross-cultural or universal) applica- tion, and he is somewhat coy about the extent to which he regards his thesis as a true account of human ethical and psychological life. This ignores the currency of similar ideas in other spheres of enquiry, especially in the growing consensus of evolutionary psychology and social anthropology on the fundamental importance of reciprocity in human co-operation, and on the basis of the most distinctive features of human intellectual, ethical, and cultural life in our species' unique forms of sociality. If G.'s thesis is true for Greek culture, this may be because (a version of) it is true absolutely. 225</page><page sequence="3">NOTICES OF BOOKS This concentration on theory also underlies G.'s decision to press the argument that his Greek models represent thinking about '(what we call) personality', and specifically that Greek accounts of what it is to be human can be compared to modem theories of person- hood. G. deals in detail with criticisms which could be made of this project, as well as with criticisms which have actually been made of his earlier work on the same topic, but I remain unconvinced that he has met the fundamental objection that there is no one concept of the person, but rather a range of conceptions founded on varying sets of criteria which are more or less arbitrary and, when translated into the real world, often repug- nant. (Are sufferers from Alzheimer's disease persons? Not on the typical criteria). Theories of personhood, moreover, often have a moral agenda. To be a person is to enjoy certain rights to be treated in certain ways and not in others; this is different from most ancient concep- tions of what it is to be a human being. Only the Stoics advance very far along the path of making the human being as such a locus of ethical value, while in popular contexts one's claims normally rest on participation in some definite relationship or particular community. The participant framework on which G. lays such emphasis, in fact, does not favour the development of an interest in concepts such as that of the 'person'. G.'s work constitutes a powerful argument in favour of a historically aware dialectic between modem and ancient ideas. It will be most rewarding to those pre- pared to work hard-to test its hypotheses, follow up references, pursue the controversies in which it engages, and use its insights in other applications. This is a book with which one can do a great deal, both in applying and in modifying its thesis. DOUGLAS L. CAIRNS University of Leeds SONNTAGBAUER (W.) Das Eigentlicher is unaussprech- bar. Der Kanon des Polyklet als 'mathematische' Form. (Europaische Hochschulschriften Reihe XV Bd. 69). Frankfurt am Main: Peter Lang, 1995. Pp. 322. ?36/DM 89. 3631489250. The ancient report that the fifth century Argive sculptor, Polyclitus, wrote a book, the Canon, setting out a series of mathematical relationships which would define the perfect proportions for the human body and that this was incorporated in one of his bronzes, the Doryphorus, and the identification (since the middle of the nineteenth century) of this statue with one of a boy of which over fifty copies survive (the best-known being the one from Pompeii which is to be found in the Archaeological Museum at Naples) opens up the intrigu- ing possibility that careful measurement of these copies might reveal the principles of the system. The sub-title of Sonntagbauer's book suggests that it might be another of the regular attempts (none of which has yet been convincing) to do just that. So it is, in a sense, but its aims are actually much broader. S. conveniently lists for the reader no fewer than twenty propositions which he will aim to prove (25-7). Those specific to Polyclitus' statue are: that the mathematical system on which it is based is founded on contemporary mathematics and music theory; that the proportions are not static, but dynamic; that they involve concepts of time and space; that irrational numbers must in some sense be involved; that mathematical irrationality and proportion are linked. More general propositions are: that fifth century thought is essentially 'musical-mathematical' in nature; that musical theory, mathematics, and philosophy are all tied together; that this kind of musical-mathematical world- view is not physical as we would understand the term, but anthropomorphic; that fifth century thought is Pythagorean; that Heraclitus is involved in this as well; that most philosophical terms are also 'musical-mathe- matical' terms; that the question of incommensurability is central to fifth century thought; that tragedy also has its roots in these ideas. Even in the abbreviated and sim- plified (and no doubt over-simplified) form in which I have stated these objectives (and I have, in the interests of brevity, omitted several which could not be satisfac- torily summarised) this is a formidable programme, and it is hardly worth saying that S. fails to prove all of these points; this is a plan for a lifetime's scholarly work, rather than a single book. There are a number of issues which one would expect to see discussed in an argument based on Polyclitus' Canon. How far can one rely on the accuracy of a copy, for example? And can (e.g.) Galen's rhetorically vague flourishes ('the relation- ship of finger to finger, and of all of them to the palm and the wrist, and of them to the forearm, and of the forearm to the arm, and of everything to everything ...') be treated as if they were mathematically precise formulations of proportion. S. does not consider these questions. He makes big assumptions. It is taken for granted that 'mathematical' equals 'Pythagorean' (although, despite a lot of generalised talk about Pythagorean mathematics, ancient sources actually attribute an extraordinarily small number of real math- ematical advances to Pythagoreans). Though it is still legitimate to present the discovery of the irrationality of the square root of 2 as an important turning point in the history of mathematics, it would have been good to see some recognition of the doubts recently expressed that it was really the 'foundational crisis' we used to believe. The principal problem, however, is S.'s failure to demonstrate, in an argument which claims to find Pythagoreanism and mathematics behind an enormous variety of aspects of Greek culture, that in fifth century Greece philosophy and mathematics were of interest to any but a handful of eccentrics (and his attempt to turn virtually all contemporary philosophers into crypto- Pythagoreans is not convincing). The virtue of S.'s book is in the detail, and in the hard, precise argumentation. Had the thesis been less ambitious, it would have had more to say. Finally, there is an extensive bibliography including 218 items. Only ten of them are not in Ger- man (and of these ten, nine are in English). Although, I suppose, one could take a wry pleasure in noting that it is not only Anglophones who can be remorselessly monoglot, it is sad that this should be the case with a book which bears the symbol of the European Union prominently on its cover. More important, the result is that the base of scholarly activity on which the book rests is insufficiently broad to support a thesis so wide- ranging and potentially so important.
