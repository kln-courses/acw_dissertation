<plain_text><page sequence="1">17 The So-Called Orphic Gold Tablets in Ancient Poetry and Poetics* Surprisingly little has been said about the possible connection between the famous Virgilian Golden Bough1 , which is a kind of talisman that opens for Aeneas the way to the underworld, and the so-called Orphic gold tablets2 found in a number of graves in different places throughout the Greek world, which are likewise Totenpässe intended to help holders on their afterlife journey. That little is what Eduard Norden wrote about a century ago in his fundamental commentary on Aeneid 6: "In diesem Zusammenhang ist auch с. . .&gt; der bekannten Goldblättchen zu gedenken, die in Unteritalien den in die Mysterien Eingeweih- ten ins Grab mitgegeben wurden. Solche кгтХа %pi)aa oder tamôeç %рг&gt;аои begegnen auch im Zauber &lt;...&gt;; mit diesen Ausdrücken hat der vergilische 209 crepitabat brattea (= Àerciç) auffällige Ähnlichkeit (vgl. 144 frondescit virga metallo )."3 However, in what nowadays is the standard commentary on Aeneid 6 for the English-speaking audience, Roland Austin, without even mentioning the gold tablets, merely states that "the Bough remains an enigma"4. In the same vein, four contemporary scholars, writing specifically on the (speaking broadly) mystical background of Aeneid 6, take no notice of the similarities between the Golden Bough and the gold tablets, despite the fact that in their analysis they make use of texts written on some of the tablets5. On the other hand, an ingenious alternative explanation of the Golden Bough has been proposed, namely that the Bough is a reference to the %púa£iov ócei Geíoio n^ócxcovoç I KÀcòva of Meleager's introductory epigram (АР 4.1. 47f.), intended to signal the importance of Plato's writings for the interpretation of the Virgilian underworld6. Likewise, in studies focusing on the gold tablets themselves, beginning with that by Günther Zuntz, no mention of the Golden Bough is ever made, although other Vir- gilian contexts are occasionally cited7. Certainly more facts about the gold tablets are available now than at the beginning of the twentieth century, so that one hardly needs a justification for re-examining Norden's scarce dossier; but before we begin, a warning is necessary. The gold tablets are not a uniform and consolidated phenomenon8: on the contrary, such tablets have been found in places as far apart as Southern Italy, mainland Greece, and Crete (and possibly Ionia), they date from different periods from the fourth (or even fifth) century B.C. to the second (or third) century A.D., and they vary significantly in both their shape and inscribed content. Thus, when comparing these tablets with the Golden Bough, we should ideally confine ourselves to one specific tradition that would appear, on considerations of geography and chronology, most relevant to Virgil. How- ever, since our evidence for any individual tradition is still very fragmentary (to say the least), we are bound to adopt an eclectic approach and to point out parallels wherever we can find them. * I am grateful to Prof. Robert Maltby and Prof. Jürgen Hammerstaedt for their valuable suggestions and criticism. I am also greatly indebted to Mr. Richard Davies for his generous help with my English. 1 The literature on the Golden Bough is enormous; for a recent treatment, with further bibliography, see Pârvulescu (2005). 2 Several editions and monograph-length studies, often under the same cover, of the gold tablets have appeared recently; to cite just some of them: Pugliese Carratelli (2003), Edmonds (2004), Graf and Johnston (2007), Bernabé and Jiménez San Cristóbal (2008). An important collection of essays, also including an edition of the tablets, was published last year: Edmonds (2011). As individual studies are numberless, for further bibliography one should consult the books cited above. 3 Norden (1926: 172). 4 Austin (1977: 83). 5 Molyvati-Toptsis (1994), Weber (1995), Torjussen (2008), Bremmer (2009) and (2011). 6 First suggested by Michels (1945), later resumed by West (1987), and subsequently developed by Weber (1995). 7 Zuntz (1971). Cf. also e.g. Pugliese Carratelli (2003), Edmonds (2004), Graf and Johnston (2007), Bernabé and Jiménez San Cristóbal (2008). 8 The most up-to-date collection of the gold tablets is perhaps that by Edmonds in Edmonds (2011: 16-50). I find, however, Graf and Johnston (2007: 1-49) more useful in some respects. In the former tablets are arranged according to their type, in the latter according to the place they were found.</page><page sequence="2">18 B.Kayachev First of all, the question must be asked whether Virgil could be aware of the gold tablets at all. This seems likely, though impossible to prove decisively. As already pointed out, a number of tablets come from Southern Italy (and Sicily), and although they all date from about the fourth century B.C., one similar tablet, dating from the second or third century A.D., has been found in Rome, which strongly suggests that the tradition continued uninterrupted in Virgil's time as well9. The most obvious and fundamental point of contact concerning the physical appearance of the Golden Bough and the gold tablets is that, as already seen by Norden, both the leaves of the Bough and the tablets are made of gold foil. To this we should add that a number of tablets are actually leaf-shaped: in some cases their precise shape is not reported, two are in the shape of an ivy-leaf10, but the majority, in cases when the type of leaf is made explicit, can be described as myrtle-leaf shaped11. Remarkably, Virgil compares the Golden Bough to a mistletoe, and a mistletoe-leaf happens to be more or less like a myrtle-leaf; the problem is, however, that none of the leaf-shaped tablets has been found in Italy. There are basically two types of gold tablets: those inscribed with a longer, generally metrical, text, which are normally of a rectangular shape; and those briefly inscribed with either the name of the deceased, a profession of his status as an initiate, or a greeting to Persephone and/or Pluto (sometimes the first ele- ment is combined with either of the two latter), which often are of a leaf-shape. In most cases only tablets of one type have been found in the same place, which makes it look almost as if these two types of tablets represented two different and unrelated traditions. However, in Crete tablets of both types have been found in close proximity12, so that at least they are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Thus, it may not be impos- sible that leaf-shaped tablets were known in Italy as well. In addition to the obvious physical resemblance between the Golden Bough and the leaf-shaped gold tablets, they also perform analogous functions. The Sibyl speaks of the Bough as a ritual offering to Perse- phone that grants access to the underworld ( Aen . 6.142f.): hoc sibi pulchra suum ferri Proserpina munus I instituit. In a similar manner, some of the tablets of the 'shorter' type have inscriptions which present them as either a 'letter' or an offering to Persephone (and/or Pluto)13. Perhaps the most telling parallel is provided by the much-discussed Posidippus tablet - which actually happens to be of a myrtle-leaf shape: «^epoecpóvrii IIooeíôucTTOç |it)GTr|ç ei)oeßr|&lt;;14. What is Posidippus implied to be doing to, or for, Persephone? One option is to supplement %a(peiv (with the implied кгХгшх), as in three of the five similar tablets, which would make it sound almost as the standard greeting formula used in letters15. We should note, however, that, whereas in letters the sender is normally named before the addressee (much as in the two analogous tablets from Macedonia, see the preceding note), in the Posidippus tablet Persephone, the receiver, is named first, which seems to be more natural for dedicatory texts. Thus, alternatively, we may rather take the inscription to announce that Posidippus offers to Persephone the gold leaf itself. Whichever is the right interpretation, in either case Persephone receives the gold leaf, whether it be as a 'letter' or an offering, and in this respect the parallel with the Golden Bough is, I think, undeniable. But what is the purpose of offering to Persephone either the Golden Bough or a gold leaf? At first sight, the reason why Aeneas needs the Bough seems plain: as the Sibyl tells him, no-one is allowed to 9 These are tablets 1 to 9 in Graf and Johnston (2007: 4-19). 10 Tablets 26 a and b in Graf and Johnston (2007: 36). 1 1 Their shape is variously indicated by editors as that of an almond, a laurel-leaf, or a myrtle-leaf, but as has been argued by Dickie (1995: 86), it is "a myrtle-leaf not a laurel-leaf [or almond] that we would expect initiates going on their journey to the Underworld to have with them" and that, therefore, all of these tablets are most probably meant to represent; cf. Tzifopoulos (2011: 169f.). 12 For example, tablet 15, which is of the 'shorter' type, comes from the same cemetery in Eleuthera, and dates from the same period, as 10-12, which are of the 'longer' type; see Graf and Johnston (2007: 24). 13 The five relevant tablets are brought together in Edmonds (2011: 39 and 46). 14 Tablet 31 in Graf and Johnston (2007: 42). 15 These are the three tablets with the %aip8iv formula: [ПХо{&gt;]тот кос! &lt;E&gt;[8pG]o7rovei %aíp£v (Crete), ФгАлотп OepG£&lt;póvr|i Xaípeiv (Macedonia), and OiÀ,coTT|pa xcoi Aea7i(ó&gt;Te(i){a} %épe(v) ê{t}^œ(i) (?) (Macedonia). The first two are tablets 15 and 37 in Graf and Johnston (2007: 14), the last is tablet E6 in Edmonds (2011: 39).</page><page sequence="3">The So-Called Orphic Gold Tablets in Ancient Poetry and Poetics 19 go down into the underworld without it (Aen. 6.140f.). The tablets with shorter inscriptions do not provide enough evidence for their precise function, but if we use the information supplied by the longer texts, the picture becomes clear enough. On two similar tablets from Thurii we see the deceased announce: vîv S' ík8tiç т]ксо трос! ayvryv Фероефоуегосу, I coç rcpocppcov 7réji'|/r|i eôpaç éç e-òayécov16. Bearing in mind that several tablets of the 'shorter' type also explicitly identify the deceased as an initiate, we can thus draw the conclusion that their purpose is to open the way not to the underworld in general, but rather to a specific, and better, place allotted to those who were initiated into the mysteries. In other tablets we find the same idea expressed in a number of similar ways: 1) ôe^iàv óSourópei I taijucováç 0' iepoùç Kai ãXaea 3&gt;£po£(poveíaç (Thurii); 2) ка! ôf| Kai ai) rciwv óôòv ëp%eai, av те Kai aÄAoi I цгхзтаг Kai ßa%%oi tepàv axeí%ODai kXeeivoí (Hipponion); 3) Kaminévei g' гжо yrjv xéXea ааааттгр öAßioi aÄAoi (Pelinna); 4) кщкг jne rcpòç jidgxcdv 0iáGO')ç- e%co ôpyia . . . (Pherae); 5) eïoiGi íepòv taijicova* obroivoç yàp ó jiúcruriç (Pherae)17. Thus, the function of the gold tablets would appear significantly different from that of the Golden Bough. Indeed, the first task the Bough is employed for is to persuade Charon to carry Aeneas and the Sibyl over Styx (Aen. 6.406-410), in other words, it seems to grant access to the under- world in general and not to a particular part of it. However, we see the Bough once again when, after a long journey through various regions of the underworld, it is eventually delivered to Persephone's palace (Aen. 6.628-636). It is hardly by chance, although the connection is not made explicitly, that only after this do Aeneas and the Sibyl proceed to Elysium (6.637-639): his demum exactis, perfecto muñere diuae, I deue- nere locos laetos et amoena uirecta I fortunatorum nemorum sedesque beatas. Many similarities between Virgil's description of Elysium (where the first person to be mentioned is none other than Orpheus18) and the picture given by the gold tablets have been pointed out by others19, but, surprisingly, it has so far escaped notice that the Bough and the tablets play virtually the same role as they open the way to either sedes beatas or eSpaç coayécov20. The tablets of the 'longer' type feature a variety of different texts, but among them two groups are espe- cially prominent. One group comprises tablets speaking of Persephone as the queen of the underworld who determines the posthumous fate of the dead21; it is mainly from these tablets that we took the above-cited references to the happy abodes allotted to the initiated. The other group consists of tablets which describe the encounter of the deceased with the guardians of the spring of Mnemosyne22. 1 would suggest that, much as the delivery of the Golden Bough by Aeneas to Persephone's palace parallels the appeal by the deceased to Persephone implied in the tablets of the first group, Aeneas and the Sibyl's encounter with Charon may be alluding to the narrative told in the tablets of the second group. Let us list individual parallels. Aeneas and the Sibyl enter the palace of Dis (Aen. 6.269 domos Ditis ); the deceased approaches the palace of Hades (4 Aíôao ôójicov). In the forecourt of Dis' palace Aeneas sees a huge dark elm-tree (283 ulmus opaca ); near Hades' palace a white cypress grows (5 ^edktiv . . . KDTtapiooov). Aeneas and the Sibyl approach the river of Styx (384 fluuioque propinquant ); by contrast, the deceased is told not to come near to the first spring (7 xamr'q xrjç Kpfjvriç 'xr'8k o%eôòv é|H7r£À,áar|a0a). Both these places are described as the gathering place of the souls of the dead (305 hue omnis turba ad ripas effusa ruebat and 390 umbrarum hie locus est , cf. 6 £v0a Kaxep%ójwevai '|A)%ai veKÚcov 'i/t)%ovxai). Styx is guarded by Charon (298 portitor has horrendus aquas et flumina seruat)' there are guardians at the spring of Mnemosyne (9 (púÀaKeç ô' 87rímep0£v eaaiv). Both Aeneas and the deceased are asked by either Charon or the guardians what they have come for (389 fare age , quid uenias , cf. 12 oxi %péoç eíoacpimveiç). ^ Tablets 6 and 7 in Graf and Johnston (2007: 14). 17 Tablets 3, 1, 26a, 28 and 27 in Graf and Johnston (2007). 18 Cf. Austin (1977: 202f.). 19 See e.g. Molyvati-Toptsis (1994: 38 and 44f.), Pârvulescu (2005: 905f.), Torjussen (2008: 76f.), Bremmer (2009: 200). 20 Pârvulescu (2005: 905f.) comes closest to my conclusion when he observes that both Aeneas and the initiate act in the manner of a suppliant. 21 These are mainly the tablets of A series, as they are conventionally labelled since Zuntz (1971). 22 В series in Zuntz (1971) and thereafter. For a synoptic text see below.</page><page sequence="4">20 В. Kayachev Their ends are, of course, quite different, but they both manage to dispose towards themselves their 'hosts' (407, cf. 18): the latter, because he knows the right answer, written on the gold tablet for him to remember; the former, because he (or rather the Sibyl for him) can produce the Golden Bough. If, as has been recently argued by Christoph Riedweg, the various metrical texts inscribed on the gold tablets come originally from a single poem with a coherent narrative23, Aeneas' catabasis would thus par- allel the story told in this hypothetical poem not only in some individual situations and motifs, but also in terms of general structure, whereas the role played by the Golden Bough would be comparable to the function performed defacto by the gold tablets, whether or not the use of the tablets was referred to in, and thus sanctioned by, the poem itself. To be sure, all the collected parallels are suggestive at best and, on their own, cannot prove beyond reasonable doubt that in Aeneid 6 Virgil does indeed refer either to the gold tablets as physical objects, or to the poem preserved on these tablets as an independent literary text, or to both the tablets and the poem as connected phenomena (that is, as we know them). Obviously, the problem largely depends on whether the gold tablets and/or the poem were widespread enough, firstly, for Virgil to know about them and, secondly, for Virgil's audience to expect and recognise allusions to them. It seems easy to give a negative answer, since "no author contemporary with the gold tablets seems to mention them, even though they range in date from the fifth century ВСЕ to the third century CE"24. However, although indeed no explicit reference to the gold tablets exists, it has been convincingly argued that Posidippus' appeal to the Muses to write down in golden columns what they have heard from either Apollo or Bacchus (SH 705.6 Ypa'|/óc|ievai ôéÀ-xcov év Xpuoéaiç oeÀíoiv) is an allusion to the gold tablets of the same kind as known to us25. 1 would tentatively suggest that Meleager's 'golden branch of Plato', which is sometimes believed to be the prototype of the Virgilian Golden Bough, may likewise be an allusion to the gold tablets, specifically hinting at the affin- ity of Plato's eschatological myths with the ideas expressed in the tablets26. In addition to these (arguable) references to the gold tablets as physical objects, possible echoes of the vocabulary and ideas featured by the tablets have also been pointed out in a whole range of poetic texts of different types and periods, from Parmenides and Empedocles to late antique funerary epigrams27. This is not the place to re-examine all these parallels, which anyway are mostly too general to indicate unambiguously a direct textual relationship rather than a common conceptual background. Instead, I shall suggest a few further possible allusions to the texts of the gold tablets. They will be, however, of a differ- ent and somewhat unexpected kind, with points of contact primarily found not on the level of specifically 'Orphic' concepts (as in most earlier examples), but on that of narrative (as, at least in part, in the case of Aeneas' catabasis28). To be more precise, I shall compare the narrative of the В series tablets with a number of passages from Theocritus, Apollonius, Callimachus, Virgil, Propertius, and Ovid. I must, however, warn from the outset that the parallels I shall be drawing are probably not close enough to convince a sceptic and their validity largely depends on what currency as a literary text one is ready to assign to the (hypotheti- cal) poem of which fragments have been preserved on the gold tablets. If this poem was a fact not only religious, but also literary, the parallels are most likely to be deliberate literary allusions, potentially with far-reaching implications for the meaning of the texts they are inserted into. In what follows I shall adopt this maximalist position and speak of parallels with the texts of the gold tablets as allusions without further qualifications. 23 Riedweg (2011: 245-256), developing an observation made by Zuntz (1971: 383f.). In what follows, for convenience's sake, I shall be speaking of metrical texts from the tablets as deriving from a single poem. 24 Edmonds (2004: 31). 25 See Dickie (1998: 65-76); cf. Dickie (1995), Rossi (1996), Clay (2004: 84f.), Dignas (2004). 26 See especially the comparative study by Edmonds (2004). 27 Feyerabend (1984), Sassi (1988), Riedweg (1995), Dickie (1998), Clay (2004: 176 n. 203). 28 Another notable exception is an epigram by Leonidas (AP 16.230) whose narrative situation, as has been tentatively suggested by Bernabé and Jiménez San Cristóbal (2008: 35), is modelled on that of the tablets of В series.</page><page sequence="5">The So-Called Orphic Gold Tablets in Ancient Poetry and Poetics 21 The tablets of В series allow us to stitch together about twenty lines of uninterrupted narrative, which thus constitute the longest continuous fragment we have of the (hypothetical) poem. It will be useful to have the text of the whole passage before our eyes, and of several reconstructions that have been attempted so far29, 1 suggest that we take the least conservative one, that by Richard Janko, as our starting-point, while, when relevant, also adducing the actual wording of individual tablets: Mvrijioowriç TÓ5e (?)0pîov ercei av 'iéXhr'Gi 0aveío0ai [ ] TÓ8e Ypa['j/ócTco [ ] gkótoç а|1ф1каХ,г)'|/а&lt;;. e')pf|G8iç 8' AíSao òó|ncov ércì ôe^ià Kpr|vr|v, mp 8' ocÒTfi ÀeuKTiv èoTrjKmav icirnápiGcrov, 5 8V0OC Kaxepxójievai xj/D^ai vekxkùv '|/{)%ovt(xi.

Let us first consider a parallel in Theocritus. One point of resemblance was already noted by Zuntz, and so we may start by quoting his comment on the mysterious à,£dkti KD7tócpioooç mentioned in the tablets: "This 'white cypress' indeed has never ceased puzzling students; for the cypress is not white &lt;. . .&gt;. Greeks reading these words of the Gold Leaves are therefore likely to have recalled, rather, the cypresses in Kalyp- so's garden [n. 3: Od. 5. 64] and at the cave of the enamoured Cyclops [n. 4: Theocr. xi. 45]; add that the cypress grows, according to two passages in Theocritus, at springs [n. 5: Theocr. xxii. 41 (with Хгьках and ttAxxtccvoi, by àévocoç Kpf|vr|) and Epigr. iv. 7. A. S. F. Gow &lt;. . .&gt; confirms the poet's description by a quo- tation from the Geoponica but subsequently calls Theophrastus to witness that it is 'not very appropriate', since 'the tree dislikes moisture'. Even so, the Gold Leaves and Theocritus confirm each other]."32 Now, the Theocritean context we are interested in (22.41) is modelled on the only context in Homer mentioning a cypress (Od. 5.64), as is pointed out by Alexander Sens: "The line preserves a slight botanical inconcin- nity already found in Homer: both the Хехжц and 7tÀ,cxTavoç are appropriate near a stream, since they grow in wet, marshy ground &lt;. . .&gt;, but the cypress demands dry soil &lt;. . .&gt;; likewise, at £ 64, the two trees 29 Janko (1984: 99), Ferrari (2008: 25), Riedweg (2011: 248). 30 More recent collations of the Hipponion tablet, as well as the discovery of a new tablet (from Entella: tablet 8 in Graf and Johnston [2007: 16]), have now apparently established that òp(pvr)£vxoç can be reconstructed here more securely than Janko (1984: 95) thought; see the apparatus in Bernabé and Jiménez San Cristóbal (2008: 247). 31 Line 12 is generally thought to be a contracted variant of 10-11. 1 would rather suggest that 12 represents the original form of 10, so that the passage should be reconstructed as follows: oí ôé oe £Ípf|GovTai öxi xpé°Ç eÍGacpiicáveiç, I otti Òr' è^epéeiç 'AïÔoç gkótoç òpípvrievToç. 32 Zuntz (1971: 373).</page><page sequence="6">22 В. Kayachev mentioned before the cypress, the кАт10рг| and the aïyeipoç, appropriately favor wet soils."33 The Homeric allusion in Theocritus is beyond doubt, so that at first sight it might appear that the parallel with the cypress of the gold tablets is nothing but a coincidence. There exist, however, further points of contact, which are specific to Theocritus and the gold tablets. To begin with, in place of the Homeric KÀí|0pr|, the Theocritean landscape features âxúkoci (mentioned in the same line as кяжарюоог), which are obviously reminiscent of the curious epithet Хегжг| that defines Kurcápioooç in the tablets. Also, whereas in Homer the landscape is described throughout in a static mode (note especially Od. 5.70 Kprjvai 8' è^eirjç rcíoupeç péov iiôaxi À&lt;£DK(ò), in Theocritus the reader follows the progress of the Dioscuri as they find a spring (22.37 eùpov 8' àévaov Kpf)vrjv), much in the same way as the deceased is instructed in the tablets that he will find a spring (4 eí&gt;pr|0£iç 8' ÄiSao ôójlicov zni Se^ià Kpr|vr|v, cf. also 8f.). Remarkably, in some of the shorter tablets of В series the spring is likewise described as either aíévaoç or aíeípooç34, in contrast to Homer. Furthermore, at the spring Castor and Pollux meet Amycus, much as the deceased meets the guardians. However, unlike the tablets where the guardians address the deceased and ask what he has come for (12 oi Sé oe eipf|GovToci on xpéoç doacpimveiç and 11 otti é^spéeiç 'ÂïSoç okótoç òpcpvrjevToç) and, in the shorter version, who he is (tÍç 8' éooí; к&amp; 8' éooí;)35, in Theocritus it is Pollux who asks Amycus whose place it is they have come to (54 %aîpe, ^eîv', otiç éooí. TÍveç ßpoToi, cbv oSe %œpoç;;). The conversation is not going on very smoothly, when at last, and rather unexpectedly, Pollux asks Amycus if he would not even give him water to drink (62 o')8' av тоСбе rcieîv tSSoctoç av ye Soírjç;), much in the same way as the deceased asks water from the guardians (16f. àkXà 8от' сока I '|A)%pòv üScop rcpopéov [the Hipponion tablet has jriévai] Tîiç Mvrjjioowriç arcò Àíjuvriç), who, in contrast to Amycus, willingly give him to drink (19 mrnoi ooi Scooodoi rcieív Geírjç ало icpf|vr|ç). Amycus rudely replies to Pollux that, if he is really thirsty, he will learn that soon (63 yvcooeai, e'í oei) Sí'|/oç àvei|néva %eí?t£a Tspoei), and this reply cannot but remind of the claim made by the deceased that he is dying from thirst (16 ô('j/r| ô' elfi' aùoç ка! аяоААицт: note the emphasis on the 'dryness' caused by thirst in both contexts, ôí'|/oç . . . тероег and Suj/ti . . . aùoç). Amycus invites Pollux to a boxing match, in which the latter obviously wins, but we do not hear of water again. What shall we make of these parallels - perhaps not unexplainable in some other way, but certainly striking? What is the thematic connection, if any, that would make an allusion to the narrative of the gold tablets meaningful? Let us consider the wider context of Theocritus' Dioscuri. The poem is a hymn in honour of Castor and Pollux that celebrates them, first of all, as saviours of those who are within a hair's breadth of death (6 àvGpcoTccov ocoTrjpaç ènì ^г&gt;рог) fióri èóvTcov). Their first prerogative is to save ships in storms (8-22), when the sailors have already lost all hope (18 ôiojnévoiç 0avéeo0ai, cf. 1 еле! av це^цог GaveîoGai in the tablets). Thus, I would suggest that the first narrative of the hymn, that of Pollux' fight with Amycus, provides an implicit aetiological explanation of the Dioscuri's status as saviours. On the one hand, Theocritus clearly draws a parallel between the Argo which brings them to Bebrycia and the ship suffering wreck (note the chiastic echo: 12f. toí%odç I ajucpoTepouç, of the latter, and 30f. ajuipoTepcov Щ I toí%cov, of the former)36. On the other, he casts their visit to the land of the Bebrycians as in a sense a cata- basis: it is no doubt significant that, in contrast to Apollonius' version37, in Theocritus the Argo comes to Bebrycia straight after the passage through the Clashing Rocks which are often thought of as the gates to the underworld38. Remarkably, it has been suggested that the scene of the Argonauts' debarkation on the Bebrycian shore (29-37) is imitated in Virgil's account of the Trojans' arrival at Cumae at the beginning 33 Sens (1997: 109). 34 Tablets 10-14, 16, 18 and 29 in Graf and Johnston (2007). 3^ The same tablets as listed in the preceding note. 36 Sens (1997: 28f. and 82) has also suggested that Theocritus' storm narrative owes certain details to the account of the Argo's passage through the Clashing Rocks in Apollonius. 37 In Apollonius the Argonauts' visit to Bebrycia takes place before the Clashing Rocks. If, as is argued by Sens (1997: 24-33), the Argonautica predates the Dioscuri , this would be a telling alteration. Cf. also the preceding footnote. 38 Nelis (2001: 228-244), cf. Knight (1995: 44).</page><page sequence="7">The So-Called Orphic Gold Tablets in Ancient Poetry and Poetics 23 of Aeneid 6 (2-8)39, so that perhaps a connection can be made between Pollux' adventures in Bebrycia and Aeneas' catabasis. If my reading of the first narrative part of the Dioscuri as a quasi-catabasis is valid, its thematic link with the gold tablets becomes obvious. Furthermore, I would like to speculate that in Pollux' encounter with Amycus Theocritus may be providing not just an analogy to the encounter of the deceased with the guardians, but in fact an aetiology. We have seen at a number of points that Amycus' hostile behav- iour is almost exactly the opposite of the solemn hospitality displayed by the guardians. Now we may point out that, again in contrast to Apollonius where Amycus is eventually killed, in Theocritus Pollux does not kill Amycus but makes him promise that in future he will not attack newcomers (134 |1г|7тох' ëxi ^eivoiGiv £Kcbv ócviripòç ёошбои), in other words, that he will behave more like the guardians of the gold tablets. Perhaps it even would not be too much to say that, after the encounter with Pollux, Amycus becomes as it were precisely this sort of a guardian. Let us now turn to Apollonius whose Argonautica features (at least) two passages arguably alluding to the texts of the gold tablets. The first and the less certain one is the account of the Argonauts' arrival in Colchis; I shall deal with it only briefly, simply listing parallels without much discussion. As in the case of Theocritus' Dioscuri , the most general point of contact with the texts of the tablets is established by the chthonic associations of Colchis40. The Argonauts direct their steps to ócojuaxa Aír|xao (3.177, cf. 213f.), much as the deceased of the tablets finds himself near Aíôao ôójioi. On their way to Aeetes' palace the Argonauts cross a plain with trees upon which the Colchians put the bodies of their dead as a way of burial (3.200-202 evGa 5e 7coM,ai I èí;eír|ç TcpójiaÀoí те кос! íxéai éjiTrecpúaai, I xcov кос! ел' áicpoxáxcov véieueç oeipfìGi Kpéjiavxai), and so in the tablets a cypress is the landmark at which the souls of the dead gather for refreshment (6 ev0oc Kaxepxojuevai '|n)xai veicócov '|/t&gt;xovxai). In the forecourt of the palace the Argonauts see four marvellous springs (3.222-227), flowing with either milk, wine, perfumed oil, or water changing from cold to hot41, and so in the tablets two springs with different qualities are found at Hades' palace (4 and 8f., cf. 19). We should especially note the similarity between the expression used by Apol- lonius to introduce the last of his springs (3.225 f] 5' ap' aSôcop лрорееаке) and that applied in the tablets to the spring of Mnemosyne ('}/u%pòv uôcop rcpopéov, at the same metrical position as in Apollonius): the exact collocation üScop 7cpop- does not occur elsewhere in Greek poetry42. Finally, Aeetes who questions the Argonauts about their identity and the purpose of their coming can be compared to the guardians. The second and more detailed parallel is found in the episode of the Argonauts' encounter with the Hesperides (4.1381-1501)43. In fact, this episode contains two narratives imitating the plot of the gold tab- lets: the first, the Argonauts' encounter with the Hesperides itself; the second, Aegle's account of Heracles' coming to their garden the day before (1432-1449). Let us start with the main narrative. The very first par- allel we see is in the way it is introduced: the expression MoDaacov o8e JlU)0oç (1381) is strikingly similar to the formula which introduces instructions for the dead in one of the tablets, Mvruiooúvriç xóôe (?)0pîov (1). Not only is the grammatical structure the same in the two sentences, but it also may not be irrelevant that the Muses are actually Mnemosyne's daughters. As for the function of this introductory formula in Apollonius, it is generally taken to signal the author's scepticism towards the narrative that follows, and its 39 Henry (1878: 549f.), Hligi (1952: 127). Aen. 6.8 inuentaque flumina might thus be an allusion to Theocr. 22.37 eùpov 5' otevaov Kpr|vr|v, which in its turn I argue to derive from 4 £i)pf|G£iç . . . Kprjvrjv of the tablets. 40 See Knight (1995: 177 and 182f.), Nelis (2001: 228-235). 41 As Hunter (1989: 122) remarks, "[s]treams of milk and wine are among the traditional Bacchic miracles". We may point out that milk and wine also figure in some of the tablets, cf. for example: Kpiòç eíç yáXa ërceoeç. oívov e%e iç eúÔaíjiova (tablets 26 a and b in Graf and Johnston [2007: 36]). 42 This is admittedly the only solid textual parallel between the two contexts. It may not be sufficient on its own, but it is also corroborated by the fact that Apollonius' springs have a direct intertextual connection with the spring in Theocritus (which in its turn, as we have seen, has further, and more secure, points of contact with the spring of the gold tablets): see Sens (1997: 29 and 106). 43 Again, it is suggested by a remark in Zuntz (1971: 391) that makes an indirect connection between the white cypress and the tree of the Hesperides as variants on the universal concept of the tree of life.</page><page sequence="8">24 В. Kayachev use may be ironical indeed, but at face value it certainly rather denotes the story-teller's awe, as if he were about to give an account of a divine revelation. For twelve days the Argonauts have been carrying the Argo through the Libyan desert, when at last they come to Lake Tritonis (referred to as 1391 Àijivrj, cf. the lake - 8 and 17 Xi'ivr' - of Mnemosyne in the tablets), the water of which, however, proves salty and undrinkable. (I would thus suggest that Lake Tritonis may be juxtaposed with the first spring in the tablets, which the deceased is instructed not to drink from.) So the Argonauts, tortured by thirst (1394f. érci fy'pì' yàp ёкегто I ôíij/a ÔDr)7ia0ífl те кос! aÀ,yeoiv and 1459 8í'|/ti k£kjhtiótocç, cf. the thirst experienced by the deceased: 16 8i'|/r| 8' ei|T avoq mi алоМл^аг), set out to look for fresh water. They come to the garden of the Hesperides, where they find the carcass of the guardian-dragon (1434 cppoDpòv öqnv, cf. 9 (pt)À,aKeç of the tablets) Ladon, killed by Heracles, and the nymphs themselves, mourning over him. As the Argonauts approach (1407 méXacaav, cf. the instruction not to come near the first spring: 7 jar|Sè a%eôòv è|ircetaxcrr|o0a), the Hesperides turn to dust, but Orpheus addresses them with a supplication, asking for water with which he and his companions could quench their thirst (1417f. póov, ф ano Síyav I aí0ojLiévr|v ajtioxov taocprjoojiev). The prayer for water obviously paral- lels the analogous request about which the deceased is instructed in the tablets (16f. Sixj/rj 5' eíjn9 aúoç mi à7róÀÀD|iar àXkà бот' сока I '|/D%pòv i)ôcop rcpopéov), and perhaps, given the supposed Orphic character of the tablets, it is not irrelevant that in Apollonius it is none other than Orpheus who utters the prayer. The Hesperides are said to take pity on the Argonauts (1422 éÀiaipov), and so are the guardians, if one accepts Pugliese Carratelli's conjecture (éÀeoúaiv: the Hipponion tablet44 has èpéoDGiv). In reply to Orpheus' prayer one of the Hesperides, Aegle, tells the Argonauts how on the previous day Heracles came to their garden, likewise suffering from thirst: Aegle's account reproduces the narrative of the gold tablets for a second time. Aegle describes Heracles as literally 'dry with thirst' (1442 ôí'|/r| mp%aÀioç), virtually the same expression as used by the deceased in the tablets (16 Si'|/r| 8' dju' aúoç: note also that both phrases occupy the same metrical position)45. She also says that he came looking for water (1443 üócop é^epécov) using the same verb, and at the same metrical position, as the guardians in the tablets when asking the deceased what he is seeking in the underworld (11 otti òri &amp;;epéeiç). With a kick of his foot Heracles makes water spring forth from a rock, and it is this spring that Aegle shows to the Argonauts. After they have quenched their thirst, the Argonauts decide to go after Heracles and try to catch him. In a sense, this repeats the narrative pattern found in the tablets where the deceased is promised to follow, after he has drunk from the spring of Mnemosyne, the 'other jhÚgtoci and ßaK%oi' along the sacred road. Although oT8Í%£iv is not a rare word in Greek epos, it seems nevertheless worth noting that it is applied to both Heracles (1459f. àXká jiiv eï кщ I Srjoijiev GTeí%ovTa Si' r]7ceípoio kiovtcç and 1481f. éç ô' старое àviow ц')0г|аато jifj jaiv et' áXkov I (naoTrjpa crueí%ovTa Kixriaejuev) and to these jiÚotoci and ßaK%oi (20f. ка! 5т] Kai ai) 7uœv óôòv ep%rai, r'v те Kai aÀÀoi I jiixxcai Kai ßaK%oi íepriv gt£Í%odgi KÀ,eeivoí). Remarkably, the second passage from the Argonautica has also other textual parallels with the tablets: the participles ávicov and 7iicov are placed at the same metrical position, and aXkov I |шатг|ра and äXkoi I jL шотаг both produce enjambement. Again, we should ask the same question as in Theocritus' case: what is the meaning of this allusion, if such it is; what is the point Apollonius intends to make, if any, by bringing together the Argonauts' visit to the Hesperides with instructions for the initiates about the underworld? To begin with, the garden of the Hesperides, traditionally placed at the western end of the world, is thus closely associated with the under- world, much in the same way as Colchis is by virtue of its location at the furthest east: allusions to the texts of the gold tablets would obviously intensify these associations. At the same time, since, as has been often noted, the capturing of the Hesperides' golden apples by Heracles is a counterpart to Jason's quest for the 44 Tablet 1 in Graf and Johnston (2007: 4). 45 It should be noted, of course, that Apollonius' variant of the phrase, with карха^ео ç instead of aúoç, comes from Homer (where it occurs only once: II. 21.541 Ьщг' mp^a^éoi). In the Homeric context the phrase is however, unlike both Apollonius and the gold tablets, just a passing remark without any specific function in the narrative, since those who are said to be thirsty are not looking for water.</page><page sequence="9">The So-Called Orphic Gold Tablets in Ancient Poetry and Poetics 25 Golden Fleece, the use of the same model in both contexts would underline their parallelism and add to its implications. On the other hand, Apollonius seems to play on the connection of the gold tablets with mys- teries. Heracles, who created the marvellous spring in the garden of the Hesperides, is cast as it were in the role of a founder of mysteries, whom the Argonauts follow in the manner of initiates. Thus, the intertextual pun on (шахтера - 'ivaxai may in fact be not merely phonetical, but also imply some sort of etymological connection46. However, potentially the most significant implication of the allusions to the texts of the gold tablets is to be found elsewhere. As has been often observed, these funerary texts have striking similarities with Egyp- tian representations of the afterlife journey47. The most relevant shared motif for our present purposes is that of thirst experienced by the deceased, which he seeks to relieve by drinking from a spring flowing near a tree. Of course, there are perceptible differences in detail as well; the most remarkable functional differ- ence is that, whereas in the tablets the white cypress seems to play the role of a mere landmark and it is the guardians who are asked for water, in the Egyptian representations it is the tree itself (generally either a palm or a sycamore, but never a cypress), as a manifestation of a goddess, that the dead addresses his prayer to48. Now, looking back at the episode of the Argonauts' encounter with the Hesperides, we cannot fail to notice that in several details it comes much closer to the Egyptian scenario than to that of the gold tablets. To begin with, Orpheus directs his prayer to the Hesperides who in response first reappear in the shape of trees and only then turn back into their anthropomorphic form. This identification of a female deity with a tree is strikingly reminiscent of what we find in the Egyptian version, which is especially remarkable since the Hesperides do not seem to figure as hamadryads elsewhere. Also, Orpheus addresses the Hesperides first, without being questioned by them, as the deceased is by the guardians in the tablets, and similarly in the Egyptian texts the prayer for water is not prompted by any questions. As has recently been argued by Susan Stephens, in a study dealing with (hitherto largely ignored) Egyptian intertexts in the three major Hellenistic poets - Callimachus, Theocritus, and Apollonius49 -, the Argonautica features numerous implicit allusions to figures and events of Egyptian mythology. The most extensive parallels are found in the Egyptian representations of the underworld: as Stephens observes, in book 4 Apollonius "has not only deliberately constructed his narrative to evoke a vaguely Greek poetic katabasis but conformed his text in strategic locations to mirror one of the most prominent (and idiosyn- cratic) features of Egyptian cosmology, the voyage of the Sun through the realms of the night"50. Stephens' remarks on the Libyan section of the Argonauts' journey are particularly relevant to our argument: "From the perspective of the Egyptians who lived to the east of this region, the area of the western desert was the land of the dead. &lt;. . &gt; The crossing of Libya requires the Argonauts to carry their boat for twelve days and nights (4.1389) - the number of hours of darkness in the dat. The final stages of the Egyptian underworld journey provide a close parallel: the waterways become a desert, and the solar boat must be carried or dragged before it can emerge again into the light."51 True, Stephens mainly points out parallels with the Egyptian underworld in its cosmological rather than eschatological function, but the two are in fact very similar in many respects, and the underworld journey of the soul closely resembles that of the Sun. So I think it is justified to assume that Apollonius in the episode of the Argonauts' encounter with the Hesperides is indeed alluding to that station of the tradi- tional Egyptian afterlife journey where the deceased asks for water. And I would further suggest that this 46 I am unaware of jiaGirip and iiúgttiç (or their cognates) having been directly connected in antiquity, but both have been linked with jioúoa: on the derivation of jioúgcx from jllcogGou see Assaël (2000: 17-27), from jideiv see A. Hardie (2004: 11-14). 47 See Zuntz (1971: 370-376), Merkelbach (1999) and Dousa (2011). The latter discussion is by far the most detailed. 48 See Dousa (2011: 129-140). As Dousa (2011: 133) specifies, the tree is normally either "merged with a human form or merely associated with one". 49 Stephens (2003). Cf. also, on Apollonius, Noegel (2004) and, with the emphasis on the political context of Ptolemaic Egypt, Mori (2008). 50 Stephens (2003: 218f.). 51 Stephens (2003: 231).</page><page sequence="10">26 В. Kayachev 52 Cf. Stephens' (2003: 225) remarks on Apollonius' practice of conflating analogous patterns from Greek and Egyptian mythology. Egyptian parallel does support, rather than exclude, the allusion to the texts of the gold tablets, since on the one hand it confirms the underworld associations of the episode, while on the other it cannot explain textual parallels with the tablets. Thus, it would seem that Apollonius noticed the affinity of Egyptian eschatology with that of the gold tablets52 long before modern scholars. The Callimachean parallel I want to suggest (in the Hymn to Athena ) is, among those we have seen so far, the least certain, but at the same time potentially the richest in important implications. Perhaps on its own this arguable allusion to the texts of the gold tablets would not even be worth noting, but it is cor- roborated by considerable circumstantial evidence, for several Latin poetic texts alluding to the hymn53 seem at the same time, with various degrees of plausibility, to recognise its 'Orphic' subtext. Moreover, this parallel provides, as I shall argue, an interpretative key to an important aspect of the poetological imagery employed by a number of Hellenistic and Roman poets. Let us start by listing the few available direct points of contact between the Hymn to Athena and the (hypothetical) poem fragmentarily preserved on the gold tablets. In general, I suggest that Tiresias' encounter with Athena narrated in the hymn (lines 57-136) can be compared to that of the deceased with the guardians as described in the tablets. The most obvious similarity is the motif of thirst: Tiresias comes to Hippocrene, the deceased to the spring of Mnemosyne, both urged by irresistible thirst (77 Suj/áoaç ô' aípaxóv xi лот! póov ti?U)0£ Kpávaç, cf. 16 òí''fr' ô' eijLt' aúoç ка! a7ióÀ,?U)|iai). (Outside the Tiresias sec- tion, the narrator of the hymn gives the prescription - for which the story of Tiresias provides an aetiologi- cal explanation - to drink, on the day of Athena's festival, not from the river but from springs, 46 7uv£t' arcò Kpavav jirjS' arcò тсо 7uotoc|ico, which cannot but remind us of the instruction for the deceased to avoid the first spring, Kpr|vr|, and to drink only from the pond, Xijuvri, of Mnemosyne.) Both are asked, by either Athena or the guardians, what brings them there (80f. tÍç oe (. . .) xaXznàv óôòv ауауг ôaíjicov; cf. 12 on Xpéoç doacpixáveiç). It has been remarked that Tiresias' blindness, with which he is punished for seeing Athena, can be symbolically equated with death54: this obviously assimilates Tiresias to the protagonist of the gold tablets narrative. Whether or not Tiresias is given water to drink, remains unclear, but in response to the pleas of his mother Chariclo Athena takes pity (95 0eà ô' £À£T|G£v èxocípocv, cf. the conjectural 18 éÀeoCaiv) and promises him that in Hades, unlike all the other dead, he will retain his intelligence (129f. ка1 (iióvoç, eí)T£ Gavfl, 7C£rcvt&gt;|jivoç £V v£kÚ£ggi I cpoiTaarî, |И£уаА,ф TÍjnioç Ây£GÍ^a), which is also, of course, exactly the point of drinking from the spring of Mnemosyne - to be able to remember one's own identity when confronting the rulers of the underworld. Before I propose an interpretation for this allusion, I suggest that we first consider several literary responses to the Hymn to Athena in Latin poetry. Not only will they support my claim that Callimachus does allude to the narrative of the gold tablets, but they may also provide some clues for the role this 'Orphic' subtext plays in the hymn. The first relevant context is found in Virgil: the Orpheus narrative at the end of Georgics 4 is, I would suggest, much indebted to Callimachus' treatment of the story of Tiresias. Let us list the most remarkable correspondences. Both Orpheus and Tiresias are going upwards, the former from the underworld to the upper world, the latter to the top of Helicon. Both break a law given by a deity (487 hanc dederat Pro- serpina legem ; 100 Kpóvioi 5' coSe Àéyovxi vójuoi), by looking at what they are forbidden to see, although they do not do it deliberately (491 immemor heu! uictusque animi respexit; 78 g%£ xXioç огж £0éÀ,cov 8' £ÍS£ та [Щ 0£jLLiTOc), but urged by some irresistible desire (488 subita incautum dementia cepit ; 77 ôixj/áaaç ô' acpaxóv ti). Both are addressed in similar ways by the person they have looked at, Orpheus by Eury- dice and Tiresias by Athena (494f. quis et me ... miseram et te perdidit, Orpheu , I quis tantus furor?; 80f. tÍç G£ . . . I co Eúripdôa, %аХгпау óôòv ауауг Saijucov;). The punishment is also similar in both cases: Orpheus is deprived of the possibility to see Eurydice again, Tiresias of that to see at all (499f. dixit et ex 53 On the reception of the Hymn to Athena in Latin poetry, in addition to what I have to discuss, cf. Hey worth (2004: 145f.). 54 Cf. Hunter (1992: 20): "The loss of sight is like the loss of life."</page><page sequence="11">The So-Called Orphic Gold Tablets in Ancient Poetry and Poetics 27 oculis subito . . . fugit' 82 a jnev £cpa, rcaiSòç 8' бщшш v')^ eXaftev). Orpheus attempts to embrace Eury- dice and to speak to her, but this proves no more effective than Tiresias' physical stupor (500-502 neque ilium I prensantem nequiquam umbras et multa uolentem I dicere praeterea uidit' 83 £ОШ0Г| 8' acpGoyyoç, éicóÀÀaoav yàp àvîai I ycovaxa rai cpcovàv ëo%ev à|u,a%avía). From this moment, it may be said that Eurydice takes over Tiresias' role, while Orpheus becomes Chariclo's counterpart: it is Eurydice who literally loses her sight, much as Tiresias does (496 conditque natantia lumina somnus , 497 circumdata nocte' 82 оццата vvi, e^iaßev, 92 cpcxea: note that lumina renders cpaeoc), and it is like Chariclo embracing Tiresias that Orpheus attempts, though in vain, to embrace Eurydice (501 prensantem nequiquam umbras ; 93 aju(poT£pociGi cpíÀ,ov 7i£pi miSa ?iaßoiaa). Also, both Orpheus' and Chariclo's laments are compared to a nightingale's song (511 qualis ... maerens philomela' 94 yo£pav oíxov ócr|Soví8cov), but, unlike Chariclo, Orpheus is unable to mitigate the gods (505 quo fletu Manis, quae numina uoce moueret ?' 95 ay£ ßapi) KÀmoiaa, 0£a 8' еХецсеу èxaípav). Finally, Orpheus' own death evokes that of Actaeon, with whom Tire- sias is explicitly contrasted, as both are violently dismembered (520-522, cf. 114-116). It is beyond the scope of the present study to discuss in detail the meaning of Virgil's allusion to Cal- limachus. What we can do is highlight some points that may possibly attest to Virgil's recognition of the gold tablets as a subtext of Callimachus' hymn. First of all, Virgil as it were reinstates the plot to its origi- nal setting, the underworld, although, unlike the tablets, in the Georgics it is on the way from, not to, the underworld that the events happen. In a similar vein, the very figure of the Virgilian protagonist may create a link with the texts of the tablets if they indeed originate, as is often assumed, from an Orphic context. In addition to these general similarities I would like to suggest a more specific point of contact. As is noted above, it is some sort of dementia that makes Orpheus break Persephone's prescription and thus parallels Tiresias' insufferable thirst. In its own turn, the motif of thirst plays a crucial role in the tablets, where the deceased is instructed not even to come near the first spring (apparently, the spring of Lethe) and is only allowed to quench his thirst from the second, the spring of Mnemosyne. To put it in more abstract terms, the deceased is urged by an irrational desire to drink from the spring of forgetfulness, but as an initiate he knows, and his gold tablet helps him to remember, that he must conquer this desire until he can drink from the spring of memory. Orpheus' situation is similar: he is forbidden to look at Eurydice only until a certain moment, and his ability to resist the temptation can likewise be said to depend on whether he remembers Persephone's prescription. In fact, Virgil seems to etymologise dementia as 'loss of memory' by explicitly calling Orpheus immemor (4.491) and thus hinting at the connection of mens with meminisse55 . So the Vir- gilian Orpheus would seem to fail in performing, mutatis mutandis , precisely that task of resisting forget- fulness to which the narrator of our (hypothetical) 'Orphic' poem, possibly likewise Orpheus, encourages the deceased. In Propertius there are two contexts, in elegies 3.3 and 4.956, which refer to Callimachus' Hymn to Athena while also arguably alluding to the gold tablets as its subtext. Let us start with the later of the two. In elegy 4.9 Propertius narrates how Heracles, after the fight with Cacus, came to the sanctuary of Bona Dea, from which men were excluded, asking for water to quench his thirst. Since the elegy's connection with the Tiresias narrative of Callimachus' hymn, as well as with the episode of the Argonauts' encounter with the Hesperides in Apollonius, has been pointed out by others57, we can immediately turn our attention to a possible allusion to the texts of the gold tablets. Of course, there are several motifs shared by Propertius' elegy and the tablets that are also found in either Callimachus or Apollonius, which therefore have hardly any weight in proving Propertius' acquaintance with the tablets. But one point of contact seems specific to Propertius and the tablets: unlike both Callimachus' Tiresias and Apollonius' Orpheus and Heracles, who do not introduce themselves when, looking for water, they meet a deity, Propertius' Heracles does present himself, and moreover in an emphatic manner reminiscent of the tablets. In the tablets the deceased iden- tifies himself before the guardians as a child of Earth and Heaven (14 rfjç mîç eÍjlíi raí Oůpavoí), with 55 See Maltby (1991) s.v. mens and amens. Note Berry (2011), who draws suggestive parallels between the two. 57 See Hutchinson (2006: 205 and 216). Cf. Berry (2011: 399f.).</page><page sequence="12">28 В. Kayachev a qualification: 15 oròxàp éjnoi yévoç oúpócviov), while also intimating that they must know his lineage already (15 xò ôè taxe Kai amoí). In Propertius Heracles curiously presents himself as the one who has held the vault of heaven on his shoulders and who has received (whatever this means) the earth (37f. audis- tisne aliquem, tergo qui sustulit orbem? I Ule ego sum : Alciden terra recepta uocat ), and he also suggests that his deeds can hardly be unknown to his prospective hosts (39 quis facta Herculeae non audit fortia clauae?). At the same time, Heracles' remark that on earth he is called Alcides (38), i.e. (grand)son of Alcaeus, seems to allude to the fact that in heaven he is known as a son of Zeus. This may seem at first sight a random coincidence, but in fact the motif of divine descent plays similarly crucial roles in both contexts. In the tablets it is the insistence of the deceased that his true lineage is from heaven (15 сштоср èjLioì yévoç oůpáviov) that secures his request for water (in the tablets of A series the deceased even claims his descent to be from gods: mi yàp éyà&gt;v ůjnwv yévoç öAßiov eiSxojuai eivai58). In Propertius Heracles is refused water, perhaps precisely because he does not state his divine parentage clearly enough (although at 43f. he mentions Hera as his stepmother; but note that the priestess, at 53, addresses him with a mere hospes , as if not understanding, or not believing, what he hints at), so that he is compelled to take it by force. After that, however, instead of being punished as an ordinary mortal who has broken a divine prohibition, Heracles himself acts like a deity as he institutes a symmetric ritual taboo, banning women from the Ara Maxima (note also the invocation of the deified Heracles concluding the elegy). Perhaps the water Heracles drinks can even be considered, in a sense, the agent of his deification, much as in the tablets the water from the spring of Mnemosyne opens for the initiates the way to the abodes of the blessed. The second Propertian context arguably alluding to the gold tablets is the programmatic elegy 3.3. Its connection with the prologue and the dream narrative of Callimachus' Aetia is well-known, but Propertius also appears to be using the Hymn to Athena , a fact not generally acknowledged. Given the highly fragmen- tary state of the Aetia , it is, of course, likely that a number of points shared by Propertius' elegy and Cal- limachus' hymn could also find parallels in a lost part of the prologue, but on the whole the amount of close correspondences seems to favour a direct relationship. As is noted above, Propertius was certainly familiar with the Hymn to Athena. Let us list the most important parallels. Both narratives take place on Helicon, by Hippocrene, at midday (in Propertius the last point can be inferred from the reference to siesta): uisus eram molli recubans Heliconis in umbra, I Bellerophontei qua fluit umor equi (If.), uraco érci Kpócva fEÀiKcoví8i ка Xa peoíaa I À,œvTo* jueoajißpiva ô' eí%' opoç áat&gt;%ía (71f.)59. Propertius attempts to drink from the spring of Hippocrene after the manner of thirsty Ennius (5f. paruaque iam magnis admoramfontibus ora / unde pater sitiens Ennius ante bibit ), and likewise Tiresias, tortured by thirst, comes to the same spring (77 Si'j/áoaç ô' a(paxóv ti лот! póov Kpócvaç). Both Propertius and Tiresias are rebuked in similar ways by a deity, either Apollo or Athena (15f. quid tibi cum tali , demens, est flumine? quis te I carminis heroi tangere iussit opus? 80f. tÍç oe (...) xakznàv óÔòv ауаув Saíjicov;)60. Athena's speech is confined to this single question, whereas Propertius' Apollo develops the Callimachean motif of road by enriching it with borrowings from Apollo's instructions in the prologue of the Aetia ; finally Apollo shows Propertius a new path (26 qua noua muscoso semita facta solo est). Propertius follows the path and finds himself in a grotto where he meets the Muses; Tiresias becomes blind, and momentarily also speechless, so that his mother Chariclo has time to make reproaches to Athena for her cruelty. Athena's answer (introduced by 95f. 0eà 5' гХгг' aev ETaípav. I ка( viv Â0avaía rcpòç tóS' гкг^гу ekoç) is in a number of points similar to Calliope's welcome to Propertius (37f. e quarum numero me contigit una dearum: I ut reor a facie, Callio- 58 Tablets 5-7 in Graf and Johnston (2007: 12-14). 59 I would suggest that umbra may be hinting at jieaajißpiva, especially as Ovid's allusion to the same Callimachean passage {Met. 3.144 dies medius rerum contraxerat umbras) seems both to render |LieGa|ißpivcx literally as dies medius and to imitate it in sound with umbras (on Ovid's engagement in his Actaeon narrative with the Hymn to Athena , see below); a further confirmation comes from Ovid's Amores , where in a similar manner Callimachus' |ieaa|ißpiva is playfully evoked by membra (1.5. If.): aestus erat, mediamque dies exegerat horam; I adposui medio membra leuanda toro. 60 I would tentatively suggest that demens may be alluding to Ôaíjicov (while perhaps also acknowledging Virgil's use of dementia in the Orpheus narrative).</page><page sequence="13">The So-Called Orphic Gold Tablets in Ancient Poetry and Poetics 29 pea fuit)61. Athena forbids Chariclo to deplore her son's blindness, Calliope warns Propertius from touch- ing epic themes. At the same time, Athena promises to make Tiresias a prophet (121 iliocvtiv гкг' GrjGco viv àoíôijiiov éaaojLiévoiaiv), and similarly Propertius is told that he will be an elegiac poet (Ali. quippe coronatos alienum ad limen amantes I nocturnaeque canes ebria signa morae ); much as Tiresias will be an expert, among other things, in ornithomancy (123 yvcooercoci ô' opviGaç), Propertius will be able to give competent advice on matters of love (49 per te clausas sciat excantare puellas). Both goddesses confirm their promises with a symbolic gesture: Athena nods after Zeus' manner (131f. còç (pccjjiva катгуггхте* то ô' évTEÀiç, ф к' £7uve{)Ofl I riaÀAocç), Calliope gives Propertius to taste the water from the spring (51f. talia Calliope , lymphisque a fonte petitis I ora Philitea nostra rigauit aqua). The most fundamental point of contact with the texts of the gold tablets is the fact that Propertius' elegy likewise features two springs, the 'wrong' one and the 'right' one (even though apparently they turn out to be the same62). In both the tablets and Propertius' elegy the protagonist is deterred from the first spring and is only allowed to drink from the second (which, strictly speaking, is a pond rather than a spring: 8 and 17 À,i|ivr| or 32 lacus , in contrast to 4 Kprjvri or 5 fontes', although it then figures as 19 Kpr|vr| or 51 fans too). In the tablets the first spring is the place where the souls of the uninitiated come for refreshment (6); in Propertius Ennius, after drinking from Hippocrene, conjures as it were the spirits of some figures of Roman history (7-12). The spring of Mnemosyne is reserved for those initiated into mysteries (note 21 ixuoxai кш ßoncxoi, cf. 7cé(L me |ie Trpòç jnxxucov Bkxgodç* e%co öpyia ... in a tablet from Pherae63), and similarly the spring from which Propertius eventually drinks is associated with the mysteries of the Muses (29 orgia Musarum)' and the Muses are, of course, Mnemosyne's daughters. An untrodden path shown by Apollo leads Propertius to this secret spring (25f.); in the tablets the deceased follows a sacred road, open only to the initiates, after drinking the water of Mnemosyne (20f.). Ovid possibly alludes to the texts of the gold tablets in the Actaeon narrative of the Metamorphoses (3.138-252), which, of course, is also known to be indebted to the Tiresias section of Callimachus' Hymn to Athena 64 . The setting of Actaeon's encounter with Artemis recalls at once the landscape pictured in the tablets. It is a valley thickly grown with pines and cypresses (155 uallis erat piceis et acuta densa cupressu: note the collective singular of cupressu ; cf. 5 ÀeDiayv èaxr|Kmav K-imocpiocrov); in the valley there is a grot- to with a spring to the right (161 fans sonat a dextra , cf. 4 етсг ôe^ià Kpfjvrjv)65, and to this spring Artemis often comes to bathe (163f. hie dea siluarum uenatu fessa solebat I uirgineos artus liquido perfundere rore and 165 quo postquam subiit , cf. 6 ev0a Kaxepxójxevai '|A)%ai veicúcov '|/{&gt;%ovTai). It is not thirst but chance that brings Actaeon to the spring and thus makes him see the naked goddess, so it is all the more striking that in Actaeon's punishment water plays a crucial role as the material agent of his metamorphosis. When Artemis sprinkles him with ultricibus undis (190), Actaeon begins transforming into a stag until it is only his mind that remains unchanged (203 mens tantum pristina mans it). The function of the water from the spring of Mnemosyne is likewise to preserve the memory of the deceased in the underworld, and possibly also in his future reincarnations (perhaps, not necessarily human)66. 1 would further suggest that the peculiar periphrastic reference to Actaeon as Autonoeius heros (198) is intended to convey, through its 61 We may note that both Athena and Calliope are explicitly identified as goddesses. As is noted by Hey worth and Mor- wood (2011: 122), cf. A. Hardie (2009: 22), Propertius etymologises Calliope's name as deriving from бц/ in the sense of 'face' (cf .facie) rather than 'voice'; one could speculate that the other sense of б'|/ is meant to be evoked by ercoç in the Callimachean subtext. 62 Both Bellerophontei . . . umor equi (2) and Gorgoneo . . . lac и (32) must refer to Hippocrene, cf. Hey worth and Mor- wood (2011: 121). 63 Tablet 28 in Graf and Johnston (2007: 38). 64 See recently Van Tress (2004: 97-109). 65 As Börner (1969: 493) rightly remarks, "keine bewußt exakte Ortsangabe"; so perhaps its only raison d'être is to evoke the location of the spring in the tablets. 66 Of course, as noted above, the motif of preserving one's own memory figures also in Callimachus' account of Tiresias, so on its own it cannot establish a secure point of contact between Ovid and the tablets; however, it is only in Ovid and the tablets, in contrast to Callimachus, that water makes the protagonist preserve his memory.</page><page sequence="14">30 В. Kayachev etymological associations (cf. ocòxóç and voCç), precisely this idea of the 'unchanged mind' {mens pristina ), and, if understood in that way, it can be certainly compared to the expression 'mindful hero', jnejnvr||n£v0ç lípcoç (apparently referring to the deceased), that features in one of the tablets of В series (from Entella)67. Chased by his own hunting dogs, Actaeon attempts to stop them by naming his identity and appealing to the fact that they must know him (230 Actaeon ego sum: dominum cognoscite uestrum! cf. Ule ego sum at Prop. 4.9.38), in a manner reminiscent of how the deceased acts when questioned by the guardians (14f. rfjç mîç eíjii ... то Sè ïcrce кос! oruxoí). I am ready to concede that, taken on their own, parallels with the gold tablets found in individual pas- sages of Virgil, Propertius and Ovid may not be conclusive. However, since these passages also allude to one and the same Callimachean model, which in its turn likewise has certain points of contact with the tablets, it seems natural that all parallels should be considered cumulatively, as if found in a single context. Taken in this way, I believe, they constitute quite a substantial, if still not irrefutable, argument for assuming that the three Latin poets recognised in the gold tablets, or rather in the poem inscribed thereon, a subtext of Callimachus' hymn. Why then does Callimachus (supposing he does) allude in his hymn to the gold tablets? What is the principal point he wants to be inferred from this allusion? On the basis of the comparison with Propertius' elegy 3.3, it can be suggested, firstly, that Tiresias' wish (whether realised or not) to drink from Hippocrene implies the motif of drinking the water of inspiration and, secondly, that Callimachus associates this motif with drinking from the spring of Mnemosyne. As has been convincingly demonstrated by a number of studies68, the Tiresias section of Callimachus' hymn features systematic allusions to Hesiod's account of his encounter with the Muses at the beginning of the Theogony , so that Tiresias' own encounter with Athe- na turns out to be a variation on the theme of poetic initiation. Of course, as has also been pointed out many times69, in the original account of Hesiod's initiation there is no drinking from either Hippocrene or any other spring, and it is only in Hellenistic poetry that the motif of drinking the water of inspiration is first attested. Although one might speculate that the Hymn to Athena is the ultimate model from which all later examples of this motif derive, it seems much more plausible that here Callimachus is himself alluding to an earlier and more detailed treatment (in the hymn we are not told whether Tiresias actually drinks). Cal- limachus' own dream narrative at the beginning of the Aetia is, of course, an obvious, if far from perfect, candidate for the role of such a model. It has been often assumed that in his dream Callimachus imagines either himself or Hesiod drinking from Hippocrene (or some other spring on Helicon), but unfortunately the evidence is not conclusive70. Later I shall discuss another possible source text for the motif of drinking the water of inspiration (not necessarily excluding, but certainly predating, the Aetia), whereas at the moment I would like to focus on the Hymn to Athena and the Aetia . Whether or not Callimachus made use of this motif in the Aetia as well as in the hymn, the former can shed some light on its significance in the latter. Crucial for my argument is the fact that the Hymn to Athena parallels in a number of details the Aetia in general and its opening part(s) in particular71. To name just the most basic point of contact, both the dream narrative in the Aetia and the Tiresias section of the hymn are variations on the topos of poetic initiation, both dependent to a significant degree on the proem of the Theogony. On a more precise level, perhaps the most striking verbal parallel is derived from the fact that both Callimachus of the dream nar- rative and Tiresias in the hymn are referred to as young men in very similar, and very specific, terms: the former as àpxiyéveioç (schol. Flor. 18), the latter as apxi yeveia I TtepráÇcov (75f.).

These two subtexts will provide important clues for our understanding of Callimachus' allusion to drinking from the spring of Mnemosyne. The first subtext I would like to discuss is Parmenides. Although the Parmenidean parallel to Cal- limachus' motif of untrodden path is well-known (fr. 1.25 toc 'ir' Ttaxéouaiv, cf. В 1.27 ektÒç tioctod)72, Parmenides is not generally considered among Callimachus' sources73. 1 suggest that Apollo's advice in the Aetia prologue (fr. 1.23-28) owes more to Parmenides than just this single motif. The relevant passage is fragment В 6 where the Goddess instructs Parmenides to follow one way of inquiry while avoiding two others, thus constituting a neat counterpart to Apollo's commandment to avoid the highway and to follow the less frequented path74. The most obvious and uncontroversial parallel is established by the fact that both Apollo and Parmenides' Goddess refer to their own precepts in almost the same way: mi то8' avcoya, та jiTi mxéouoiv ajaa^ai I xa crueißeiv (fr. 1.25f.) and toc о' èyà&gt; (ppócÇeoGoci avcoya (В 6.2). As is easy to observe, in both cases the same verb of command (avcoya) governs an infinitive (crueißeiv or cppócÇeaGai) with a direct object expressed by the same demonstrative pronoun (та). The actual instructions also have points of contact, although these are less certain because of the lacunae in Callimachus' fragment: [. . .] ócoiôé, то (lèv 0úoç otti rcoc%iGTov I [0pé'|/ai, tt]]v MoCoav ô' coyaGè ^87CTaÀir|v (fr. 1.23f.) and %pr' то Äiyeiv те voeîv т' èòv E[i'iEvai (В 6.1). Although it is not impossible that the conjectural 0pe'|/ai is an infini- tive with imperative force, it is rather more probable that it depends on a modal word like Parmenides' %pf|, especially given the presence of a precise counterpart in the well-known Virgilian rendering of Apollo's prescriptions (Eel. 6.5 oportet). Turning now to the Hymn to Athena , we can hardly fail to notice that the hymn too seems to allude to Parmenides. There are some similarities of diction that may well look accidental if taken on their own (55f. piocpa 5' éyeo ti I ташб' épéco* |li')0oç ô' огж é(ióç, ÒXK èTépcov, cf.

В 1.2f. érceí |i' éç Ó8òv ßrjaav тюАлофГцлхуу ayoDoai I Saíjuovoç), but the scenes of the meeting of either Tiresias or Parmenides with either Athena or the Goddess have more telling, even if contrasting, resemblance. In contrast to the benevolent address of Parmenides' Goddess (B 1.22f. mi | le 0eà rcpocppcov гжебе^ато . . . ënoç сросто ка( |хг яросирба), Athena's address to Tiresias is tinted with anger (79 tòv 8è xo^cooajiéva тегр ojicoç 7rpooé(paG£v Ä0ocva). Perhaps more significant is the fact that whereas Parmenides is assured that what brings him to the abodes of the Goddess is not 'ill fate' (B 1.26f. oí) tí g e jioîpa какц тгрояшгцтге véeo0ai I tt|v8' óôóv, note also that at 1.2f. this way is described as óôòç Saíjuovoç), with the implication that it is generally those who have died that come there75, Athena's message is pointedly almost the reverse as she intimates to Tiresias that it was bad luck that brought him to Helicon (80f. tÍç öe ... xoc^ercàv ó8òv ayaye ôaijicov;), for he will become blind, which in this context, as we have seen already, is a kind of substitute for death. The second subtext which I suggest to be likewise alluded to in both the Aetia and the Hymn to Athena is Plato's Phaedrus. It is now widely agreed that Callimachus' (conjectural) reference to the singing of cicadas (fr. 1.29f. Àiyùv f|%ov I [твттгуос;]) and his wish to become, presumably, one of these creatures (32 éyœ ô' 8ÏT|v o')^a%iL)ç, ó лтероец) are meant to evoke the famous myth of the cicadas told by Socrates in the Phaedrus (258e6-259d8)76. Indeed, Callimachus' remark that he belongs to those oï Aiyùv f|%ov I 72 See e.g. Massimilla (1996: 219), who also mentions among parallels В 6.3-5 but without discussing it. 73 For example, Acosta-Hughes and Stephens (2002: 246) do not name Parmenides in their list of (ten) poets Callimachus alludes to in the Aetia prologue. 74 Interpretation of Parmenides' fragment is a matter of controversy. The traditional understanding (which I adopt) depends on the supplement e'lpyco in line 3, instead of which ар^со has been suggested: see Palmer (2009: 65-68) who accepts the latter reading and argues for an alternative interpretation, making this fragment an introduction to the Goddess' exposition of the 'notions of mortals' (B 1.30 ßpoxcov ôó^aç). Even if Palmer is right, Parmenides will be instructed to avoid the wrong way of inquiry elsewhere (B 7.2 àXkà où tt^gô' à(p' óÔoi) ôiÇriGioç eípye уогцха). 75 See e.g. Coxon (2009: 10). 7^ See, most importantly, Andrews (1998: 13-17).

As has been observed, Socrates narrates the myth "év jLiearijLißpiai and stresses that they should not nod off into sleep in the heat like most men (Phaedrus 259a). If Callimachus' dream took place in the heat of the day, the image of the cicada may have formed part of the link between it and the Reply."77 Now, midday is precisely the time of Tiresias' encounter with Athena at Hippocrene, and I would suggest that Callimachus' strikingly repetitive insistence upon the fact (72 jLieaajißpiva 8' d%' opoç aai)%ia and 73 jieaa|ißpivai 8' eoav copai) may be reproducing the analogous, even if less conspicuous, feature of Socrates' narrative (Socrates refers to midday three times on a single page: 259a2 év (i8ari(ißp{a, а7 ixearuißpia^ovxa, and d8 év xfj jiearijußpia). Moreover, both in Callimachus' hymn and in Plato's dialogue the location is at a spring (71f. 17C7CCO érci Kpáva fE^iKcoví8t кос Xà peoíaa I Àcovxo* jueoajußpiva 8' eí%' opoç áa')%ía, cf. 259a5f. соолер rcpoßaxia jwearnußpicx^ovxa rcepi xr|v Kpr|vr|v ea)8eiv). Perhaps there also exists a certain parallel- ism between the protagonists of the two narratives. In Socrates' myth the cicadas are descendants of the people who became so devoted to the Muses that they incessantly sang, forgetting to eat and drink, until they died. As a reward (259c3 yépaç xoöxo Ttapà Modowv), the cicadas do not need nourishment and sing all their life, and when they die, they come to the Muses and inform them who among the living honours them (259c4-6 aSeiv, ecoç av x£À,£Dxt|oti, Kai jnexà xaûxa èXQòv кара Moúaaç ànayyéXkeiv xíç xíva a-òxcov xijia xcov év0á8e). In Callimachus' hymn Tiresias receives in a sense an analogous gift from Athena (120 é£ éjjiOev TioXkà jievewxi yépa): he will live a long life as a famous seer (121 jiávxiv ... àoíSijiiov éaaojiévoiaiv), and when he dies, he will obtain a position of honour in the underworld (129f. eůxe 0ócvr|, TceTcvojiévoç év vekveggi I cpoixaaeî, jieycxÀco xí|nioç AyeaíÀa). To the possible allusions to the Phaedrus found in the Aetia and the Hymn to Athena we may add par- allels from Propertius' elegy 3.3, which, as has been argued, is in its turn alluding to both of Callimachus' texts. Whether these parallels are a sign of Propertius recognising the Platonic subtext behind his Callima- chean models, or they derive from some lost passage in the opening parts of the Aetia , in either case they obviously corroborate the evidence for Callimachus' use of the Phaedrus. To begin with, the locus amoenus that provides the background for the conversation between Socrates and Phaedrus has certain similarities with the grotto where Propertius encounters the Muses. The place is explicitly called a jiouoeíov (278b9 xò Nujicpcov v&amp;JlIoc X£ ка1 jioDoeîov)78, and it is decorated with votive figures (230b7f. N-ujicpœv xe xivcov Kai А%еХфо') íepòv ало xcov Kopôv xe Kai áya?ijiáxcov ëoucev eivai), much in the same way as the Muses' grotto has votive offerings (28 tympana , 29 orgia , 30 calami) and statues (29 Sileni patris imago and, per- haps, diuersaeque nouem sortitae iura Puellae 79). Both Socrates in his myth of the cicadas and Propertius allot the Muses specific domains in which they assist their followers (259c5-d7, 33-36)80. Both play on the etymology of Calliope's name, the former with 259d7 KaMioxr|v cpcovf|v, the latter with 38 ut reor efacieSi. And here, in the figure of Calliope as the eldest of the Muses, we find a link to the Aetia : as has been observed by Nancy Andrews, "Callimachus' choice of Kalliope as the first speaker suggests that Callima- chus &lt;. . .&gt; wants to engage in dialectic and song"82 after the manner of the Platonic cicada, which is "the symbolic embodiment of the immortal soul, and, in particular, the soul of the philosopher"83. Andrews' 77 Hunter (1989: 2). 78 The Platonic passage is cited by Rothstein (1898: 20). 79 Cf. Hey worth and Morwood (2011: 121): "[W]e might think of a grotto in garden, with nine statues artfully distributed." 8^ This parallel is noted, in general terms, by Hey worth and Morwood (2011: 122). The idea of ascribing specific domains to each of the Muses, in accordance with the etymological associations of their names, originates in Hesiod who seems to play with the etymologies of their names in passages adjacent to the catalogue of the nine Muses ( Th . 76-80; see A. Hardie [2009: 10-17]), which admittedly makes the parallel between Plato and Propertius less specific. 81 Plato's etymology follows the Theogony where, as is pointed out by A. Hardie (2009: 12, cf. 23), "КаМдотгп (Cal- liope) picks up cm! Ka&gt;ii (68 'with beautiful voice')". Propertius' is unorthodox and, as such, is obviously bound to evoke the traditional one as well. 82 Andrews (1998: 17). 83 Andrews (1998: 16).</page><page sequence="17">The So -С ailed Orphic Gold Tablets in Ancient Poetry and Poetics 33 observation brings us very close to the point I want to make concerning the programmatic message of the Aetia prologue. By alluding to Plato's Phaedrus and to Parmenides, Callimachus, I would suggest, recasts in philosophical, or, to be more precise, epistemological, terms the polemic between the Telchines and him- self that at first sight appears a purely literary dispute concerned with matters of style. Callimachus' hints at the doctrine of transmigration in the Aetia prologue evoke, along with the myth of the cicadas, the famous chariot allegory (presented shortly before the myth, at 246a3-249d3)84, which in its turn is directly related to Parmenides' proem85 - likewise alluded to in the prologue. The basic point Socrates makes in his account of the allegory is that philosophers and their likes are those who, in their préexistence, have seen, and can remember, the most of the true, ontological, reality (248d2-4 xt^v jnèv nXziom [sc. xcov àÀr|0côv] iSoöoav dç yovr|v àvôpòç yevrjGojiévoD qnXoaóípoD r' (piÀ,0mÀ,0D r' jiodoikoC xivoç Kai épcoTiKoC), whereas those who have seen less become men of a more mundane nature, from kings to 'poets'86 to tyrants. Parmenides draws an analogous distinction between the true knowledge of the onto- logical reality conferred by the Goddess and the unstable notions of mortals about the phenomenal world (B 1.29f. f|inèv àÀ,r|0eíriç гЬкькХго ç àxpejièç лхор, I f|8è ßpoxwv ôó^aç, xrjç огж evi moxiç à^r|0f|ç, cf. В 2.3-6). By alluding to these two contexts in the Aetia prologue, Callimachus unambiguously aligns him- self with the philosophers, the few who aspire to the true knowledge, whilst his opponents are thus assigned to the company of the irrational many. What is the implication of Callimachus' claim to, as it were, true philosophical knowledge? On the one hand, it obviously is a response to the Muses' famous assertion on the epistemological status of poetry in the proem of the Theogony (27f.): 'íôjnev ij/eúôea noXkà Xiyziv éxúfioiaiv ójioía, I ïôjiev 8' em' è0éÀco|U£v ócÀr|0éa yrip{)(jao0ai. But on the other, whereas for Hesiod it may be natural to lay claims to truth on a universal level, Callimachus must be making a more specific point. I would therefore suggest that, rather, the Parmenidean-Platonic metaphysics is evoked in the Aetia prologue as a poetological metaphor, with the implication that Callimachus values and seeks to understand the true essence of poetry, whereas for his critics it is the sheer length of a poem (or its subject, or genre), not its quality, that matters87. What is it that enables Callimachus to claim such things? On the metaphorical level, as we have seen, the answer is more or less clear: Callimachus receives a revelation from Apollo, much as Parmenides does from his philosophical Goddess, and, being like Socrates an admirer of the singing of cicadas, he must have likewise a philosopher's soul. But what does this mean on the level of poetics? What is this àÀr|0£ia, as opposed to ôó^ai, about poetry that Callimachus declares (according to my reading) he has the knowledge of? What is it that distinguishes Callimachus from his opponents? I would suggest we should indeed ask not so much what the objective difference between the 'substantial' and the 'accidental' qualities of poetry is, but rather what faculty it is that enables Callimachus to see the true essence of poetry. This faculty, I believe, is memory. Although, again, we should perhaps shift the emphasis from the Platonic dichotomy of the ideal and the phenomenal realities towards the Pythagorean notion of the transmigration of souls. Whereas for Plato it is vital that the soul remembers what she has seen in the ideal celestial world, for Pythagoras it is important to remember what you have seen not in the other world, but in your previous reincarnations. And so, I would suggest, for Callimachus it is a deep knowledge of the poetic tradition (which, to an extent, may admittedly be a case of the transformation of quantity into quality, after the manner of Pythagoras rather than Plato) that distinguishes him from his opponents. Indeed, Callimachus' wished-for immortality would make him contemporary with, and thus an eyewitness of, every single event (which, of course, has always been the privilege of the Muses themselves, cf. //. 2.485: yap 0шг éaxe mpeoxé xe ïaxe X£ 7cávxa) and, what matters even more, every single poetic utterance. Ennius' claim to be a reincarnation of Homer is arguably nothing more than a banalised version of precisely this concept. 84 In addition to Andrews (1998: 15f.), cf. Marinčič (2007: 42f.). 85 See recently Palmer (1999: 18-30), cf. Slaveva-Griffin (2003). 86 248elf.

Kayachev Drinking from the spring of Mnemosyne fits this pattern perfectly, for the memory its water gives is not of a temporal, but of an eschatological, thus everlasting, nature. It thus seems far from inconceivable that Callimachus would have made the springs of the Muses, Mnemosyne's daughters, flow with water of com- parable qualities. The difference would be that drinking the Muses' water opens access not to the abodes of the blessed in the underworld, but to the eternal world of poetic tradition88. The difficulty is, of course, that Hesiod's, or Callimachus' own, drinking in the Aetia is but a conjec- ture, however plausible it may seem. The only solid fact we have is that in the Hymn to Athena Tiresias comes to Hippocrene with the intention to drink from it (though even here it is left unspecified whether he actually does). Can what I have suggested about the meaning of the Parmenidean and Platonic allusions in respect of the Aetia prologue be applied likewise to the hymn? Whereas the modality of Callimachus' programmatic statement in the Aetia prologue seems to be more or less straightforward, the poetological message of the Tiresias narrative is at first sight ambiguous. There is, of course, no doubt that Tiresias' encounter with Athena is a variation on the theme of poetic initiation; what is unclear is whether it is a positive or a negative example. Leaving aside what is on the surface, the suspicion that something is going wrong seems to be supported by Callimachus' apparent reversal of his Parmenidean model where, as we have seen, the Goddess, in stark contrast to Athena, demonstrates conspicuous benevolence in her welcome to Parmenides. If we take this reversal at face value, it would imply that Tiresias' initiation is, if not sim- ply unsuccessful, of quite an opposite nature to that of Parmenides (and, therefore, to that of Callimachus himself as it is pictured in the Aetia prologue). I would suggest that the reversal of Parmenides' situation is meant, rather, ironically, and that Parmenides should still be considered a positive model. A similar case can be found in the passage where Athena states the reason for Tiresias' blinding (100-102): Kpóvioi 8' w5e Aiyovxi vójiov I oç ке tiv' àGavárcov, ока 'щ Geòç aúxòç ekr |xai, I àGpr|OTi, jiiaGcò toûtov i8eîv цеуаХсо. In addition to the parallels between Callimachus' hymn and the myth of the cicadas in Plato's Phaedrus , I would further suggest that the laws of Cronus Athena refers to are meant to recall the decree of Adrastea in Socrates' account of the life-cycle of the souls (248c2-4): Geojióç те AôpaaTeíaç oôe. íftiç av ух&gt;%ц 0£ф cj'&gt;vo7iaôòç yevojuivri koctíôti ti tcdv aXrjGcov, |ui%pi те Trjç eTepaç rcepioóoi) eivai aTrfijiova . . . (cf. especially ti tôv a^rjOcov with tiv' ccGavaTcov). In the light of the importance Socrates gives to the seeing of the divine, true reality as the only condition of the soul's well-being, it seems natural to suppose that, on the level beneath the narrative, Tiresias is granted the gift of prophecy and afterlife memory not despite his having seen Athena, the goddess of wisdom and truth (cf. 135f.), naked, but precisely because of it. In the same vein, I think, we should interpret the apparently negative connotations (note 77 acpaTÓv ti) of Tiresias' thirst, namely not as an indication that it was wrong for him to come to this particular spring, but rather as a way of concealing the fact that it is, again, not despite but because of his coming to Hippocrene (and, more probable than not, eventually drinking from it) that he obtains his gift89. If I am right in connecting the motif of drinking the water of inspiration with the drinking from the spring of Mnemosyne referred to in the gold tablets, one further potentially relevant text should be at least mentioned. This is, of course, Philitas, to whom (together with Callimachus) Propertius' famous ques- tion - quamue bibistis aquam? (3.1.6) - is directed, and more precisely the Demeter , where, as has been often assumed, some kind of a scene of poetic initiation, apparently involving drinking from the spring of Burina, took place90. 1 would tentatively suggest that Philitas, in his Demeter , may actually have been also the first to allude to the drinking from the spring of Mnemosyne in a poetological context. Given the mystic associations of the Demeter myth (in particular, in its Homeric version), it would hardly be surprising to find in Philitas' treatment references to the texts of the gold tablets which had a functional connection with 88 Cf., from the Renaissance perspective, Murrin (1969: 75-97). 89 Cf. in general Müller's (1987: 61) positive interpretation of Tiresias' encounter with Athena. Cf. also Murrin (1969: 83f.). 90 Cf. Müller (1987: 55 п. 177).

A detailed reconstruction of this hypothetical scene of poetic initiation would be unnecessarily complicated, and even so the results would hardly be conclusive. Instead, I propose a much shorter argument, which is perhaps no more convincing, but hopefully not much less suggestive either. About a half of the contexts I have argued to contain allusions to the gold tablets have been also demon- strated to bear traces of Philitean influence, which can mean that the authors of these contexts alluding to Philitas recognised the tablets as his subtext. I confine myself to citing relevant discussions. To start with, Philitas is explicitly referred to in the Aetia prologue and in Propertius' elegy 3.392. Among Callimachus' hymns it is, of course, the Hymn to Demeter - the twin piece to the Hymn to Athena - that is most obvi- ously indebted to the Demeter 93 , but the other hymn is likely to have references to Philitas' poem too94. The Libyan episode of Apollonius' Argonautica has also been convincingly argued to be in play with the poetological passage of the Demeter 95 . Finally, the Demeter has been proposed as an influence on the Orpheus narrative in Virgil's Georgics 96 . To round off this essay, I would like to make one final suggestion. I began with Norden's observation that the Golden Bough features certain similarities to the gold tablets; at a later point I argued that Proper- tius' drinking from the 'Philitean' spring in a grotto of the Muses may be modelled on the drinking from the spring of Mnemosyne referred to in these tablets. Now I would like to call attention to the fact that in his account of how he finds that spring Propertius seems to be alluding to the scene of Aeneas' search for the Bough. Both Propertius and Aeneas are shown the way (3.3.26 semita , 6.194 uia ), the former by Apollo, the latter - indirectly - by Venus. Both places they start from are situated in a pleasant environment, character- ised by green and soft soil (3.3.26 muscoso . . . solo, cf. uiridis in the next line, 6.192 uiridi . . . solo , cf. also 195f. pinguem . . . humum). Both places they come to, and this is the most remarkable point of resemblance, are associated with doves: Propertius finds doves at the pond from which he is about to drink, Aeneas is led by two doves to the tree on which the Bough grows; in both cases the doves are explicitly identified as Venus' birds (3.3.31 et Veneris dominae uolucres, mea turba, columbae , 6.190 geminae cum forte colum- bae and 193 maternas agnouit auis : cf. dominae and geminae ). Two inferences (complementary, rather than mutually exclusive) can be tentatively made if we accept this parallel as a real allusion: first, that Propertius recognised Virgil's association of the Golden Bough with the gold tablets; second, and perhaps more interesting, that Propertius read Aeneas' catabasis as in a sense a poetic initiation, as an immersion into the world of the literary past97. By way of conclusion, let us briefly survey the evidence presented in this essay. Firstly, Aeneid 6 fea- tures possible allusions to both the gold tablets as physical objects and the texts inscribed on them. Sec- ondly, Theocritus' Dioscuri and Apollonius' Argonautica contain three episodes, the former one and the latter two, that apparently reproduce the narrative pattern of a scene from the tablets. Thirdly, Callimachus' Hymn to Athena arguably alludes to the same scene, whereas three Latin poets - Virgil, Propertius, and Ovid - seem to acknowledge Callimachus' debt to the texts of the gold tablets. Finally, it can be specu- lated that Philitas' Demeter already made use of the same texts, since Callimachus, Apollonius, Virgil and Propertius appear to conflate in a number of contexts allusions to both Philitas' poem and the hypothetical 'Orphic' poem as they can be reconstructed from the available evidence. All these parallels are admittedly not sufficient to prove beyond any doubt that the texts of the gold tablets were known to Hellenistic and Roman poets, but, on the assumption that these texts derive from a single poem which would have had not just religious but also literary currency, the parallels do indeed look like deliberate allusions. 91 For possible links with mystery cult in Philitas' Demeter , see Marinčič (2007: 28-38), although, as he concedes (p. 34), "[i]t is impossible to ascertain what role, if any, Demeter's mysteries played in Philetas' poem". 92 For Propertius, see most conveniently Bowie (1985: 83f.) and Spanoudakis (2002: 59-64 and passim ). 93 Spanoudakis (2002: 293-299). 94 Müller (1987: 55 and 64). 9^ Kyriakou (1995: 210-214) and Spanoudakis (2002: 301-303). 96 Marinčič (2007: 28-38). 97 On the epic underworld as a metaphor for poetic tradition, cf.
