<plain_text><page sequence="1">ZOOMORPHIC DECORATION AND THE PROBLEM OF THE SOURCES OF MOZARABIC ILLUMINATION* BY JACQUES GUILMAIN IT is not the purpose here to discuss in a general way the remarkable paintings which appear in many of the Latin manuscripts made in Spain during the period extending approximately from the middle of the ninth to the end of the eleventh centuries.' That the illuminations of these Mozarabic books are often works of art of high quality and should be studied more thoroughly as such goes without saying.2 But a number of technical problems remain to be solved; and it is with a single problem of this type that we will deal below - the question of the origin and character of the zoomorphic decorations in Mozarabic manuscripts. Only a partial solution will be presented; this is not a definitive study, and, indeed, fur- ther research may well result in modifications of our conclusions. Much work remains to be done in our search for the sources of the vocabulary * The research on this problem was done during 1957-58 while the author held a University Fellow- ship in the Department of Fine Arts and Archaeology at Columbia University. The results were in- corporated into a doctoral dissertation submitted at that institution in June 1958. I must express my sincere gratitude to Professor Meyer Schapiro for his help and encouragement. I am indebted also to the library staffs of the Department of Fine Arts and Archaeology at Columbia and the Pierpont Morgan Library in New York.

The best source of information on Mozarabic scriptoria is Jules Tailhan's "Appendice sur les bibliotheques espagnoles du haut moyen Age," in Nouveaux melanges d'archdologie, d'histoire et de litterature sur le moyen dge, ed. Charles Cahier (Paris, 1874-1877), Iv, 217-846. The illuminations in Spanish books made from the end of the eleventh century onward differ considerably from the Mozarabic images of the tenth and first part of the eleventh centuries. The transition from Mozarabic to Romanesque is peculiarly abrupt in Spain and is accompanied by the substitution of the French-hand script for the old Visi- gothic minuscule. In relatibn to this artistic phenomenon, consult Meyer Schapiro's "From Mozarabic to Romanesque in Silos," Art Bulletin, xxi (1989), 818-874. 2 A step in this direction is taken in an exemplary way by Professor Schapiro in his article on Silos cited in note 1 above. 17</page><page sequence="2">18 Zoomorphic Decoration in Mozarabic Manuscripts of ornamental elements used by Mozarabic illuminators. Some attention has been given to the influence of the North in relation to certain iconographic types, e.g., the anthropomorphic form of Evangelist symbols.3 In this form only the head of the Evangelist figure represents an animal - the body being that of a man. Pro- fessor Cook observes the appearance of this motif in a number of Mozarabic mini- atures and attributes their presence there to the influence of Northern pre- Carolingian models.4 Professor Schapiro notes that the organization of the Evan- gelist figures on some Mozarabic pages in such a way that the symbols turn away from, but look back towards the Christ image must derive from Carolingian pro- totypes.5 Furthermore, it can be demonstrated beyond any reasonable doubt that the complex interlace ornaments found in a great many of the books made in the area of Le6n-Castile are derivatives of Carolingian types, particularly the interlace systems used in the decoration of the manuscripts of Tours and those of the Franco-Saxon school; this problem will be considered in a separate article elsewhere, and only a few references will be made to it here.6 However, a number of scholars have presented a strong case for the East as a primary source for the archetypes of the zoomorphic forms which play such an important role in Mozar- abic illuminations. Thus, for example, the Oriental character of Andalusian7 zoomorphic initials 3 I am indebted to Professor Marion Lawrence of Barnard College, who brought to my attention the relevance of the studies on this iconographic type to my own thesis. 4 Walter W. S. Cook, "The Earliest Panels of Catalonia (IV)," Art Bulletin, viii (1926), 208-215. This type of animal-man symbol appears frequently in a group of ninth-century manuscripts exe- cuted in Landevennec, a center in Brittany where insular influences were strong. Consult Genevieve L. Micheli, L'Enluminure du haut moyen age et les influences irlandaises (Brussels, 1939), pp. 97-99; also p. 79. 5 Meyer Schapiro, "Two Romanesque Drawings in Auxerre and Some Iconographic Problems," Studies in Art and Literature for Belle da Costa Greene, ed. Dorothy Miner (Princeton, 1954), pp. 888- 389 (note 36). 6 That there is a definite relationship between Northern interlace ornamentation and the inter- lace decoration in the Mozarabic manuscripts of Leon-Castile has been observed by a number of authors; e.g., see Manuel Gomez-Moreno, Iglesias mozdrabes: Arte espantol de los siglos IX a XI (Madrid, 1919), pp. 361-362; idem, in Ars Hispaniae: Historia universal del arte hispdnico iii (Madrid, 1951), 406; Pijoan, Summa artis, ViII, 539-540; G. Menendez-Pidal, "Mozarabes y Asturianos en la cultura de la alta edad media, en relacion especial con la historia de los conocimientos geograficos," Boletin de la Real Academia de la Historia, cxxxiv (1954), 288; Carl Nordenfalk, in Early Medieval Painting, p. 165, observes that around the period 930-940 large interlace initials, "obviously inspired by the school of Tours or Franco-Saxon models," appear in the Mozarabic manuscripts of Leon- Castile. My own research on interlace ornament essentially confirms this observation. However, the extent of the penetration and the effect on style of this Northern type of decoration in Spain has been underestimated by Dr Nordenfalk as well as the other authors mentioned above. 7Generally speaking, the Spanish manuscripts made from the end of the ninth century onward can be classified into three geographical groups according to their scripts - Andalusian, Toledan, and the group made in the territories no longer under Moorish rule, Leon-Castile. Works made in Catalonia have a script of local character (Fig. 1). For general discussions of these problems, consult the books and articles listed above in notes 1, 6. See also Charles Upson Clark, "Collectanea His- panica," Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences (Paris, 1920), xxiv; Agustin Millares Carlo, Nuevo estudios de paleografla espafiola (Mexico, 1941). One has to be careful to differ- entiate between "Visigothic manuscripts," which comprise all works (including the Mozarabic ones) written in scripts belonging to the same family, and "manuscripts of the Visigothic period," which refers to those works made in Spain prior to the Moorish invasions.</page><page sequence="3">Zoomorphic Decoration in Mozarabic Manuscripts 19 has been observed by several authors, sometimes in a general way,8 and at other times in a more detailed fashion. In the Biblia Hispalense,9 Gomez-Moreno dis- covers a number of initials to which he assigns an Eastern origin; more specifically, he points to a drawing of a crane, with some Arabic letters inscribed upon its neck and a fish hanging from its beak (Fig. 2).10 This motif of a bird struggling with a fish, which it holds or tries to hold in its claws appears elsewhere in Mozarabic manuscripts (Fig. 8),11 and also on a sculptured tympanum of Koubatchi, in Daghestan.12 Andre Grabar points to a cock, in another Andalusian manuscript, as belonging to a type derived ultimately from Sassanian models, but directly re- lated more to those works of the high Moslem period more or less contemporane- ous with Mozarabic miniatures (Fig. 4).13 The zoomorphic initials of Toledan manuscripts, although more plentiful than those in Andalusian works, seem to derive from the latter.14 In the opinion of Gomez-Moreno, Toledan manuscript decoration in general appears to be of Syrian or Armenian type."5 Furthermore, according to Gomez-Moreno and Dominguez Bordona, the earlier manuscripts of the free zone of Leon retained the Oriental character of the Andalusian and Toledan works in their ornaments.'6 This leads us to the large group of manuscripts of the area of Leon-Castile.'T 8 See, for example, Dominguez Bordona, Spanish Illumination, i, 10-11. 9 Codex Toletanus, Madrid, Biblioteca Nacional, Sign.

It should be said that the church in Daghestan may date from the twelfth century; on this, consult Jurgis Baltrugaitis, Etudes sur l'art medi6val en Georgie et en Armenie (Paris, 1929), pp. 54, 104, Fig. 84, and pl.

The author, in his text, mistakenly places this initial in a Castilian manuscript (Madrid, Real Academia de la Historia, 8; Expositio Psalmorum from San Millan de la Cogolla, A.D. 980), but corrects himself in his note 13. 14 Some drawings of zoomorphic initials in Toledan illumination are reproduced by Gomez-Moreno, Iglesias, i, figs. 195-197. 15 Gomez-Moreno, Iglesias, i, 359. 16 Dominguez Bordona, Spanish Illumination, i, 10-11; G6mez-Moreno, Iglesias, i, 359-361; idem, Catdlogo monumental, i, 153, describes the animal ornamentation in the 920 Bible of Le6n (Cabildo Catedral de Leon, sign. 6), as follows: "En cuanto a los animales y adorno, se ofrecen con un caracter de orientalismo indudable, pero no bizantino, sino siriaco o copto, con afinidades andaluzas patentes; asi es muy admisible su mozarabismo, que sancionan otros codices hechos en Andalucia, cual es el siguiente." Grabar, Arte del primo millennio, pp. 316-317, argues for strong Sassanian and Moslem influences in this manuscript, i.e., in the decorative scheme of the pages showing the Evangelist symbols. 17 The two major pioneers in the development of illumination and calligraphy in the region of Le6n- Castile during the earlier part of the tenth century were the monks Magius and Florentius. Both men had pupils who carried on their work. For further information on these men and their manuscripts, consult Wilhelm Neuss, Die Apokalypse des Hl. Johannes in der altspanischen und altchristlichen Bibel- Illustration (Mtinster in Westfalen, 1931) i, 5-16, 18-25: idem, Die Katalanische Bibelillustration um die Wende des ersten Jahrtausend8 und die altspanische Buchmalerei (Bonn, 1922), pp. 63, 66; Domin- guez Bordona, Spanish IUumination, I, 11, 15; idm, Expoaici6n, p. 171; G6mez-Moreno, Iglesias, I,</page><page sequence="4">20 Zoomorphic Decoration in Mozarabic Manuscripts From this region, the zoomorphic decorations in the manuscripts of the scripto- rium of San Millan de la Cogolla have received particular attention (Fig. 1). Of great interest are the animals which make up the large initial illustrated in Fig. 46. The letter represents two crossed, leaping ibexes, grouped around a tree of life; they are shown over two little dogs which imitate their movements. This group derives, according to Professor Grabar, from a motif originally of ancient Mesopotamian tradition, then Sassanian, but here in a specifically proto-Islamic version;18 Fig. 47 shows a Persian form of this type, and Fig. 48 a tenth-century Armenian variant. The Eastern character of the style and the animal ornamentation of the Beatus of Gerona (Gerona, Chapter of the Cathedral), dated A.D. 975, has also been strongly stressed.'9 This work cannot be definitely placed - it may have been made in Tavara but there is no doubt that it was illuminated by the monk Emeterius, who had been a pupil of the famous archipictor Magius, one of the leading figures in the history of early mediaeval painting in Spain.20 A number of distinctly Oriental animal types have been noted in this work; thus, both Neuss and Grabar compare a monster which appears in the manuscript to the Sassanian peacock-dragon, i.e., the "Semourv," with the head and legs of a dog, and the tail of a peacock (Fig. 49).21 Neuss observes further that the griffins on fols. 175v-176 131, 361-362; Menendez-Pidal, loc. cit., pp. 226-227, 274-277, 287; Nordenfalk, in Early Medieval Painting, pp. 165-168. 18 Grabar, in Arte del primo millennio, pp. 315-316, and note 14; see also Dominguez Bordona, Span- ish Illumination, i, 362. The variations of this Oriental scheme of opposed and crossed animals are discussed by Jurgis Baltrusaitis, Art sumerien; art roman (Paris, 1934), pp. 17-29; see also Nils Aberg, The Occident and the Orient in the Art of the Seventh Century, ii; Lombard Italy (Stockholm, 1945), p. 58. 19 The oriental character of the illuminations in this manuscript has been emphasized especially by Neuss, Die katalanische Bibelillutration, pp. 66 f., 140; idem, "Probleme der christlichen Kunst im maurischen Spanien des 10. Jahrhunderts," Fruhmittelalterliche Kunst I. Neue Beitrdge zur Kunstge- schichte des ersten Jahrtausends (Mainz, 1954), pp. 256 if. 20 The possibility that the manuscript was made in Catalonia is suggested by Neuss, Die Apokalypse, ij 24, 42-43; Manuela Churruca, Influjo oriental en lo0 temas iconogrdftco8 de la miniatura e8pafola, siglo X al XII (Madrid, 1939), p. 103, attempts to place it in a monastery of the Asturias-Le6n area. Actually, on the basis of its inscriptions, it is possible only to date the codex A.D. 975, in relation to the exploits of a governor of the region of the Duero in Leon (Fig. 1), and to attribute its illuminations to the painter Emeterius, a pupil of the archipictor Magius (see n. 17 above), and a nun named Ende. Men6ndez-Pidal, loc. cit. (n. 6 above), pp. 206-207, states the problem: "En fin, los documentos a 61 referentes le sitfian entre los afios 959-995, y la accion a que la suscripcion del codice gerundense se refiere fue sin duda una expedicion gemela a la emprendida en marzo del 975 por Garci Fernandez y sus coaligados de Pamplona, Leon, Monz6n y Saldafna. La noticia del fracaso de la expedicion de Garci Fernfandez llego a Cordoba en 15 de julio; el copista de nuestro Beato fecha diez dias antes VI1 FA Ila NNS JULIAS, 'en el tiempo en que Fernan Lafnez habia marchado a combatir a los moros,' todo lo cual es poderosa prueba de como el monasterio en que se copiaba nuestro Beato era de la region del Duero, uno mas de los enclavados en ese nuicleo activo de las tierras por entonces repo- bladas de mozarabes en la retaguardia segura de los cristianos.... En resumen, el codice hoy en Gerona se fecha con relacion a las empresas de un gobernador leones de la region del Duero. Los copis- tas que lo iluminaron y lo escribieron son los mismos Emeterio y Senior que figuran retratados bajo sus respectivos nombres en el otro Beato tabarense. Neuss incluso reconoce hermandad de mano entre ambos codices." See also Clark, p. 85 (no. 539); and Nordenfalk, in Early Medieval Painting, p. 166. 21 Grabar, in Arte del primo millennio, p. 316. For a Sassanian example of the peacock-dragon, see</page><page sequence="5">Zoomorphic Decoration in Mozarabic Manuscripts 21 are definitely Sassanian types (Fig. 50).22 Grabar relates the cavalier shown on fol. 134v to an early Moslem form based on Sassanian prototypes (Fig. 51). He goes on to derive the trappings of the horse from those of Iranian cavaliers; for example, the phalerae in shapes of half moons, the tassel sustained by a small chain on front of the horse's croup, and the animals knotted tail. The pearled harness appears in Omayyad works.23 The eagle grasping a roe in its claws which is found in the Gerona Beatus (Fig. 49) derives also, according to Grabar, from models in Moslem art and Christian art in areas of Moslem expansion.24 In effect, although (like Neuss) he derives the animal types ultimately from Sassanian sources, Grabar comes to somewhat more specific conclusions. Grabar deduces that the Mozarabic elements with which he has dealt derive, as a whole, not directly from the much older Sassanian types, but more probably from Oriental models of the eighth, ninth, and tenth centuries - models which in turn derive from the first Moslem art, itself permeated with Sassanian elements.25 However, in relation to the approach to this problem taken by Professor Grabar, there is a pitfall which he himself recognizes. The danger is that certain Oriental elements (e.g., cufic inscriptions) were used so generally in the West as decorative forms that they can no longer, in individual cases where they appear in this region, be apprehended with certainty as directly derived from Oriental models.26 However, Grabar does not believe this to be the case in relation to those motifs which he discusses. It is true, one should bear in mind, that the contact be- tween the East and Spain was, for the most part, stronger than between the Orient and other Western areas. There can also be no doubt that the major Spanish illuminators of the tenth century were familiar with Carolingian manuscript art, as was pointed out above.27 If it is assumed that the transmission of decorative elements is generally Friedrich Sarre, L'Art de la Perse ancienne (Paris, 1921), plate 94 (drawing made after a cast of a de- tail of the equestrian statue of Khosrau II, at Tak-i-Bostan). 22 Neuss, Die Apokalypse, i, 275. See also idem, in Friihmittelalterliche Kunst I, p. 271. The appear- ance of this type of griffin in ninth-century Asturian sculpture (San Miguel de Lifio) is noted by Helmut Schlunk, in Ars Hispaniae: Historia uniaersal del arte hispdnico, ii (Madrid, 1947), 367; see also Zichichwili, loc. cit., (n. 12 above), pp. 145-146, and plate viii. 23 Grabar, in Arte del primo millennio, p. 314. The Oriental character of this cavalier has also been observed by Neuss, Die Apokalypse, i, 275; Friihmittelalterliche Kunst I, p. 271, Neuss states: "Direkt nach Persien und zur sassanidischen Kunst weisen Bilder wie das des Reiters im Kampf mit der Schlange auf fol. 134 des Beatus von Gerona.... 24 Grabar, in Arte del primo millennio, p. 316. 25 Ibid., p. 317. Professor Grabar concludes: "Et cela nous confirme, avec evideiice, ce que d'autres motifs, plus sassanides, nous avaient fait observer, a savoir que - malgre l'abondance et la purete relative des formes sassanides qu'on y trouve - les elements orientaux des enluminures Mozarabes dependent immediatement non pas de modeles proprement sassanides (dont la serie s'arrete d'ailleurs au milieu du VIIe siecle), mais de modeles du premier art islamique farci d'1eements sassanides, et plus exactement des oeuvres chretiennes des pays orientaux soumis a l'Islam et qui subissent une forte influence de l'art musulman. Ces modeles ont d'u dater du VIIIe, IXe et Xe siecles; ils etaient donc plus ou moins contemporains des manuscrits Mozarabes. Cette conclusion relative aux enluminures ornementales rejoint donc celle que nous avions proposee pour les images avec figures." 26 Ibid., p. 312. 27 See above, notes 4, 5, 6. The educated inhabitants of Spain during the Visigothic and the Mozara-</page><page sequence="6">22 Zoomorphic Decoration in Mozarabic Manuscripts more likely to take place from manuscript to manuscript than from sculpture or textile to manuscript, then the possibility that some of the Oriental types of zoomorphs in Mozarabic illumination may derive from Northern models should also be taken into account.28 That strong influences from the East operated upon French art, not only during the Merovingian, but also the Carolingian and later periods is well known and need not be reviewed here.29 However, a few individual examples of Oriental motifs found in Merovingian, Carolingian, and Mozarabic art may be considered with fruitful results. On some animal forms in Merovingian and Mozarabic manuscripts, one dis- covers geometric elements, such as circles or heart-shaped forms, a common feature in Oriental art30 (cf. Figs. 5, 6, 46).31 Here, then, is a system of decoration which enters early into Northern art from the East; hence, its Mozarabic vari- ants may very well derive directly from Northern models (see also Figs. 47, 48, 49, 53, 54). The griffin, with the body of a lion and the head of a bird, which is found in some Mozarabic manuscripts (cf. Figs. 6, 50), appears also in Merovingian and Carolingian works (cf. Figs. 5, 6, 7).32 It is interesting to note that in the Mozara- bic and Carolingian examples illustrated in Figs. 50 and 7 the wings of the mon- bic periods were eager collectors of books, which they often obtained from other countries, including France and Italy; on this, consult Tailhan, loc. cit. (n. 1 above), pp. 231-232, 238-239, 240-241, 319- 320; and Micheli, p. 171, note 5. 28 Disagreements on some points in Professor Grabar's writings should in no way be taken as a criticism of this exemplary scholar's work. 29 It is not possible to list all the references to this problem here; some of the more important works are: Emile MMle, L'Art religieux du XIP siecle en France: Etude sur les origines de l'iconographie du moyen age (Paris, 1922), pp. 41 ff.; Johannes Br0ndsted, Early English Ornament: The Sources, Development and Relation to Foreign Style of Pre-Norman Ornamental Art in England (London, 1924), pp. 318 ff.; Jean Ebersolt, Orient et Occident: Recherches sur les influences byzantines et orientales en France avant les cro-isades (Paris, 1928); Louis Brehier, L'Art en France des invasions barbares a l'e'poque romane (Paris, 1930); Jurgis Baltrusaitis, Art sume'rien, art roman (Paris, 1934); Richard Bernlieimer, Romanische Tierplastik und die Urspriinge ihrer Motive (Munich, 1931). 30 Ebersolt, op. cit., pp. 98-99, states: "Les Occidentaux, comme les Byzantins, subirent le charme de cet art asiatique oiu le genie dui decor s'allie 'a l'observation aigue de la realit6. Les artistes orientaux ornerent souvent le corps des animaux de motifs, qui leur donnent un aspect encore plus decoratif." 31 The Sacramentarium Gelasianum (Fig. 5), an eighth-century work, was probably made in Northeastern France. On this manuscript, consult Ernst Heinrich Zimmermann, Vorkarolingische Miniaturen (Berlin, 1916), text, pp. 217-218 - on p. 81, he points to the Oriental character of much of its animal ornameintation, and attributes it to the influence of Eastern textiles. Brondsted, pp. 305 ff., compares the animal ornamentation of Frankish manuscripts, like the Sacramentarium Gelasi- anum, to Coptic zoomorpnic decoration. For a more recent description of this codex, and additional bibliography, see Elias Avery Lowe, Codices Latini Antiquiores: A Paleographical Guide to Latin Manuscripts Prior to the Ninth Century (Oxford, 1934-1956), i, No. 105. 32 Oriental influences in the animal decoration of the manuscripts of Tours are noted by Brondsted, pp. 319-320, i.e., "Syrian influence, which made itself felt in France in the Merovingian Age, did not come to an end, as one would perhaps believe, with the Carolingian renaissance and its strong incli- nation towards the antique. On the contrary it continued to be unmistakably and strongly perceptible in one of the principal groups in the older Carolingian manuscript art at a date about the year 800, the so-called Ada group. Likewise several of the decorative animals in some of the chief manuscripts of the Tours school are obviously of Oriental origin and not antique." In note 2, p. 320. Brondsted points out the Sassanian character of the griffins in the First Bible of Charles the Bald.</page><page sequence="7">Zoomorphic Decoration in Mozarabic Manuscripts 23 sters are shown realistically, one behind the other - a Hellenistic device - whereas, by contrast, in the Oriental type illustrated in Fig. 633 the two wings are shown in expanded view.34 The use of animals as column bases in some of the canon tables of the Codex Vigilanus (Fig. 53), a manuscript made at Albelda,35 is also an Eastern motif. In monumental art, animal column bases first appear in Hittite architecture - there as lions - and continue to be used in the Orient. The motif is found also in Greek illumination, e.g., in the eleventh-century manuscript in Venice, Marciana, graec. 540.36 In Western illumination, it has been observed in the Merovingian manuscript in Paris, Bibliotheque Nationale, lat. 12168,37 and in Carolingian works, e.g., in the First Bible of Charles the Bald (Fig. 8).38 However, it is found also in the English Gospel Book of Saint-Germain-des-Pres (Fig. 9),3 and the Franco-Saxon Second Bible of Charles the Bald (Fig. 10) ;40 in the last two cases, the animals derive from the Celtic interlace-beast. Actually, the Merovingian manuscript mentioned above is itself permeated with Celtic,41 as well as Ori- 33 Where the gold ewer in the abbey of St Maurice (Fig. 6) was made is uncertain. It has been placed in both Western and Eastern areas. Mehmet Aga-Oglu, "Is the Ewer of Saint Maurice d'Agaune a Work of Sassanian Iran?" Art Bulletin, XXVIII (1946), 160 ff., concludes that it is probably a Byzantine piece of the late tenth, or early eleventh century. In any case, the griffins with which it is decorated are undoubtedly Oriental. 34 This contrast between the methods of placing animal winigs in Hellenistic art, or its derivatives, and Oriental art, is discussed by Professor Meyer Schapiro in his lectures on early Christian art at Columbia University. 35 The Codex Vigilanus or Albeldensis was completed in 976. Its first calligrapher was Vigila. It contains, amongst other records, those of the proceedings of the Spanish councils. A great deal of information on this codex was recorded by Professor Walter W. S. Cook in an unpublished booklet in the Pierpont Morgan Library in New York entitled "Description, Bibliography and Miniatures of the Codex Vigilanus, Ms. d. I. 2. of the Escorial." See also P.

Br0ndsted, p. 11, note 2, states the belief that the manuscript is the creation of an artists who "has worked in material both from the South and North of England." 40 For further information and bibliography on the Second Bible of Charles the Bald and the Franco- Saxon Style, consult Micheli, pp. 133, 136-138, 140, 167; Nordenfalk, in Early Medieval Painting, pp. 154, 157, 224. 41 Micheli, pp. 83-84, and fig. 109.

It is interesting to note that in the Merovingian, English, and Mozarabic works the animals themselves have no bases, and hence seem rather to hang from the col- umns rather than support them, as they do in the two Carolingian works where the beasts rest, so to speak, on solid ground (cf. Figs. 8, 10 with Figs. 9, 53) like the creatures in the Greek manuscript mentioned above. Thus, the animals in the Second Bible of Charles the Bald seem to be a fusion of the insular type, and the more stable - perhaps one should say classical - form found in the Greek M\Ianuscript and the First Bible of Charles the Bald. It is assumed by Male and Bernheimer that the appearance of column-bearing animals in Carolingian man- uscripts is due to the influence of early Syrian works which have not come down to US.43 This seems to be somewhat too strong a generalization, since there is little doubt that the animals in the Second Bible of Charles the Bald derive partly from English models. Certainly, one may also assume that the motif of the column- bearing animals, as it is found in the Codex Vigilanus, derives from Northern rather than Oriental prototypes, since it shares with some of the Northern vari- ants the suspended-animal form.44 Some other similarities between the decora- tion of the Codex Vigilanus and Carolingian works should be mentioned here. The use of animal forms as capitals in the Vigilanus canon tables has parallels in Franco-Saxon illumination.45 The animals which serve as capitals in the Spanish manuscript (Fig. 53) do not hold up the arch in a stable manner. In some cases they actually seem to run through the junction of the arch and the column, and they all turn back to bite the ornament. Furthermore, in the left and central columns, the upper parts of the interlace fillings have been cut to leave square spaces in which one leg of each animal is accommodated, but in a most startling way, for the creatures' legs cross the framing ribbons but also rest on top of the cut interlace fillings which are on the same plane. These biting, entangled animal forms are reminiscent of Northern types. The double animal head used as a col- umn base in the Codex Vigilanus is found also in Carolingian art (cf. Figs. 11, 38). In a somewhat later manuscript, the Codex Aemilianensis, which is probably a 42 The Oriental animal forms in Frankish and Merovingian manuscripts are discussed by Brondsted, pp. 305 if.; he believes that Coptic Egypt was the source of these forms, and holds that the Eastern animal types were passed on from Frankish straight into English illumination. 43 Male, pp. 39-40; Bernheimer, pp. 120 ff. Bernheimer gives an excellent account of the evolution of this motif, both in monumental art and illumination, in the East and in the West. Ile believes that the column-bearing animals in the Greek Marciana Manuscript (see above, footnote 36), and the Merovingian Augustine (see above, footnote 37) derive from North-Syrian illumination. 44The Codex Vigilanus is permeated with Northern interlace forms (see n. 6 above), 45 They are found, for example, in the manuscript in Cologne, Dombibliothek, 14 (the page on which appears the figure of Joln the Evangelist, which is reproduced by Amedee Boinet, La Miniature carolingienne: ses origines, son d&amp;ueloppement tParis, 19131, plate Cviii). For further information on this codex, consult Micheli, pp. 136, 139, 140. The use of the whole animal as a capital may be related to the use of the foreparts or heads of animals for the same purpose. The latter is a very ancient motif in Eastern monumental art; it is found, for example, in the Louvre Museum capital from the fourth- century B.C. Achaemenid palace in Susa. The capital is reproduced by Arthur Upham Pope and Phyllis Ackerman edd., A Survey of Persian Art from Prehistoric Times to the Present (London and New York, 1938-39), iv plate 101.</page><page sequence="9">Zoomorphic Decoration in Mozarabic Manuscripts 25 copy of the Codex Vigilanus,46 one discovers a number of creatures opposed heraldically.47 Good examples are the pairs of animals which make up the column bases on fol. 16r - which are again of the suspended type (Fig. 52). The beasts themselves are similar to the crested lion on the so-called Risano clasp, a Byzan- tine (?) work (Fig. 19),48 and are intertwined with the interlace vine in a complex way which will be discussed below. It is enough to point out here that the heraldic grouping as such is comparable to that of the two winged creatures on fol. 169v of the Gosepl Book of Lothair (Fig. 13) ;49 in both cases the animals confront each other with one foreleg raised, as if on the verge of battle. Heraldic groups are used also in the construction of initials in the Codex Aemilianensis, for example, on fol. 316v (Fig. 54). The initial on this folio is similar in many ways to the Carolingian one illustrated in Fig. 57.50 In both structures the backs of the birds have been curved to form the main circular body of the letter, and from the lower parts of the animals' tails - which meet in the Spanish initial and almost meet in the French one - there arises a small plant; this grouping may derive from the Oriental motif of the tree of life flanked by animals.5' In the Codex Aemilianensis the birds are poised as if for battle; they actually claw one another in the Carolin- gian example. The ascender of the Spanish letter, however, takes on the form of a leaping beast. Despite some differences, the overall structural scheme of the two 46 The Codex Aemilianensis was begun in 976, the year of completion of the Codex Vigilanus (see n. 35 above) and is named after the scriptorium of San MillAn de la Cogolla where it was made (Fig. 1). The manuscript was completed in the year 992; its first scribe was Velasco. See Professor W. W. S. Cook's unpublished booklet in the Pierpont Morgan Library in New York, "Description, Bibliogra- phy and Miniatures of the Codex Aemilianensis, Ms. d. I. 1. of the Escorial." The reader is again referred to Antolin's Catdlogo (n. 35 above), i, 320-368, iv, 533-534; consult also Clark, p. 32, no. 519; and Nordenfalk, in Early Medieval Painting, p. 163. Although most authors assume that the Codex Aemilianensis is a copy of the Codex Vigilanus, it has also been suggested that they both de- rive from one, or more common prototypes; on this point of view, consult Tailhan, p. 312, and Pijo!an, p. 506. 47 This is again a very ancient Eastern motif which is found already in Sumerian and Scythian art; on this, see Michael Ivanovich Rostovtzeff, Le Centre de l'A8ie, la Russie, la Chine et le style animal (Prague, 1929), p. 36; idem, The Animal Style in South Russia and China (Princeton, 1929), p. 33. The type develops a large number of variations in Oriental art and Western art influenced by it. 48 The clasp is tentatively considered to be Sassanian by Erwin Margulies, "Coloisonn6 Enamel," in Pope-Ackerman, i, 782. This author, however, argues for a Sassanian origin of cloisonne enamel. It seems more probable that the clasp is a Byzantine piece of the tenth century; this view is taken, on good grounds, by Aga-Oglu, loc. cit., (n. 33 above), p. 169. The similarity between the animal orna- mentation of the Risano clasp and that of the early tenth-century Asturian Cross of Victory has been observed by Helmut Schlunk, "The Crosses of Oviedo: a Contribution to the History of Jewelry in Northern Spain in the Ninth and Tenth Centuries," Art Bulletin, xxxii (1950), 110. 49 The Gospel Book of Lothair was made in Tours during the period 843-855.

The principal prototype for the Carolingian letter must have been a Merovingian form (cf. Figs. 14, 15, 57).52 There are mod- ifications, however. The ninth-century initial is more elaborate, and has acquired interlace decoration (in the tip of the ascender); and this, in addition to the inter- twining of the birds' claws and beaks, would seem to indicate influences from insular circles. But some details in the French letter reflect the influence of East- ern textiles. For example, the collar decorated with circles is a common feature in Sassanian, Byzantine, and Moslem art, as is also the practice of dividing birds' wings into two fields separated by a pearled strip - in the Carolingian initial illustrated here the entire upper field is decorated with circles - the lower field re- solving itself into a series of bands (Fig. 57).53 In the Codex Aemilianensis, as in some Moslem textiles,54 there are small quadrupeds which fill the empty spaces within the larger decorative scheme. There is thus apparent in the structure of the initials discussed here an evolution from Merovingian prototypes to Carolin- gian variants, in which additional impulses from the East, through the intermedi- ary of textiles, have played an important role. Consequently, by the ninth cen- tury, there existed in French illumination ready-made models for the Mozarabic letter illustrated in Fig. 54. Certainly, in the Spanish initial, fresh impulses from the Orient may have again resulted in further modifications, but these do not seem to have been of primary importance in determining the basic form of the decoration. Insular art itself became very early permeated with Eastern zoomorphic ele- ments.55 Hence, there is a possibility that some of the Oriental animal motifs in Continental illumination do not even derive directly from Byzantine, Syrian, 52 On the manuscript containing the initial illustrated in fig. 14, consult Zimmermann, text, p. 167; on the work containing the initial illustrated in fig. 15, see ibid., pp. 215-216.

Br%ndsted, pp. 104 if., discusses Oriental animal orna- mentation in South English illumination of the seventh to the ninth centuries. Br5ndsted believes that these ornaments passed from Continental into insular manuscripts; actually, the process, for the most part, could have just as easily gone the other way around. Micheli, p. 79, notes that such works as the Sacramentary of Gellone and the Book of Kells derive much of their decoration from Oriental prototypes; the Merovingian Sacramentary, however, reflects also strong insular influences in its interlace decoration. It is not possible to list here all the works in which there appears references to the Oriental character of insular zoomorphs; the reader is referred to the various references given throughout this paper. For information on the Sacramentary of Gellone (Paris, B. N. lat. 12048), consult Lowe, C. L.

Some of these motifs are distinctly of Eastern origin; the provenance of others cannot be easily established. It is evident that virtually all decorations of this type could have come into Spanish art from the North. Thus, for example, in a Bible made in the region of Leon in the year 920 (Leon, Chapter of the Cathedral, Sign. 6) one finds human forms which take on the shape of initials,57 a common device in some Merovingian books.58 Let us examine once more the motif of the bird struggling with a fish which was dis- cussed above. The image of a bird capturing a fish, or a small quadruped, is with- out doubt a very ancient Oriental schema,59 which becomes part of the traditional Merovingian vocabulary of ornaments, and continues to appear in Carolingian illumination (cf. Figs. 3, 55, 56, 58).6? Indeed, it seems as if this decoration, when it is found in Mozarabic works, often derives from these Northern sources, and has little connection with similar forms in Eastern monumental art. The practice of constructing letters with fish figures in the Codex Aemilianensis - for example the Alpha and the Omega on fol. 16r - probably derives also from Merovingian art (cf. Figs. 16, 17); fish initials continue to appear in some Carolingian works.6' 56 To deal with this problem adequately would require a very careful and extensive study of a good sample of the manuscripts involved, an impossible task here. 57 See, for example, Gomez-Moreno, Catdlogo monumental, ii, plate 87. 58 In the Sacramentary of Gellone (Paris, B. N. lat 12048), for example (cf. Zimmermann, plate 158a); see also above, note 55. Articulated human forms used to construct initials are found also in some tenth and early-eleventh-century South Italian Greek manuscripts; for example, Patmos, cod 33; Vatican, cod. gr. 2138; and Florence, Laurenziana, cod. Plut XI, 9. These works are discussed by Kurt Weitzmann, Die byzantinische Buchmalerei des IX. und X Jahrhunderts (Berlin, 1935), pp. 84 fi. Although the author notes the influence of Western Latin manuscript decorations in some of these Greek works, he considers the human initials in Patmos cod. 33 to be the invention of an unschooled Italian artist, i.e., "Diese Initialen stellen die Bemtihungen eines ungeschulten Italianers dar, aus eigener Kraft neue Formen zu finden" (p. 84). However, it seems more reasonable to assume that these initials derive from Western models. 59 See, for example, L. Legrain, "Seal Cylinders," Ur Excavations (Oxford University Press: Publi- cations of the Joint Expeditions of the British Museum and the University Museum, University of Pennsylvania, to Mesopotamia, 1951), x, plate 42, nos. 820, 822. 60 On the two Merovingian manuscripts in which the initials illustrated in figs. 55, and 56 appear, consult Zimmermann, text, pp. 218-219, 220-221; Lowe, C. L. A., ii, nos. 238, 252. Both authors date the manuscript, Laud. Misc. 126 mid-eighth century; Lowe places it in North, or Northeastern France, Zimmermann in Northeastern France. Lowe dates the manuscript, Douce 176, eighth-ninth century, Zimmermann - around 800; according to Lowe, the manuscript was written in Northeastern France, or possibly Cologne, and, according to Zimmermann, in Northeastern France. The Carolin- gian manuscript in which there appears the initial illustrated in Fig. 58 is dated both by Rand, i, 45, and Kbhler, text, i, 870, during the abbacy of Alcuin, i.e., 796-804; on the basis of its script, and fish-and-bird initials, it is classified by Rand, following Kdhler, as "Embellished Merovingian" in style. 61 For example, in the manuscripts of St Gall. On these works, consult Adolf Merton, Die Buch- malerei in St. Gallen vom neunten bis zu elften Jahrhundert (Leipzig, 1923).</page><page sequence="12">28 Zoomorphic Decoration in Mozarabic Manuscripts It is not possible to enter here into the much-debated question of the ori- gin of early mediaeval bird-and-fish initials. Such initials do not appear in the earlier Greek manuscripts which have come down to us, but they are found quite early in Italian Latin works, becoming very common in seventh-century Latin illuminations as a whole. However, it is evident that these letters, which seem to have originated in the West, eventually become modified by Oriental forms, a fact observed above in relation to certain types, e.g., heraldically paired birds around a tree of life, and the motif of the bird struggling with a fish.62 Be that as it may, we must conclude in the light of our analyses that the letters constructed with fish and bird forms which are found in Mozarabic manuscripts derive pri- marily from the Western Latin tradition of zoomorphic decoration. The point of view which is taken here - that many of the Oriental zoomorphic types in Mozarabic manuscript decorations may derive from Northern variants in Merovingian and Carolingian art - would obviously be made more secure if we could point to some unmistakably Northern decorative animal types in the Spanish works. This will now be done. II We can discuss only very briefly here the nature and evolution of Northern animal decoration before its introduction into illumination. On the origin of the Northern animal style, suffice it to say that (although some dissent exists) the majority of scholars, following Bernhard Salin, agree that this style derived initially from the zoomorphic decorations on the edges of Provincial Roman "chip carvings." Their absorption into Germanic art took place during the fifth century; they were first adopted by the tribes of the Danubian basin or those in the Northwest of the Continent and the associated areas of Scandinavia.63 The first stage in the evolution of the style is summarized by Professor Nils Aberg thus: From the Roman prototypes there then arose the Nordic animal style, owing to the deg- radation of classical modelling and its replacement by more mechanical and stereotyped 62 Byzantine-Oriental features modify the structure of bird-and-fish initials early in the West (on this, see also Zimmermann, text, p. 8, and Aberg, i, 86). Nevertheless, the theory that zoomorphic initials originated in the West seems to be the correct one (see, for example, Zimmermann, text, pp. 4 if.). Theories of an Eastern origin are always based on studies of Greek manuscripts which are much later in date than the Latin ones, in which this type of decoration first appears; and incorrectly presuppose that a flow of influences from West to East is highly improbable (see, for example, Weitz- mann, p. 67). 63 The most recent review of this problem in English appears in Wilhelm Holmqvist's Germanic Art During the First Millennium A.D. (Stockholm, 1955), pp. 192-16; the author gives an excellent bibliography. See also the pioneer work of Bernhard Salin, Die altgermanische Thierornamentik (Stockholm, 1904), pp. 128-1929, 9214, 355; and Aberg, The Occident and the Orient, ii, 110-111, iII, 36-37; W. von Jenny, "Zur Herkunft der germanischen Tierornamentik des friihen Mittelalters," Jahrbuch des deutschen archdologischen Instituts, XLIX (1934), 9.95-3191. Von Jenny briefly reviews the research on this complex problem up to 1934, and considers the Eastern as well as the Western theories of the origin of Germanic and Nordic animal ornaments. Nils Aberg reviews the problem briefly in the light of research up to 1947. The theory of a Western provincial Roman origin is by far the most plausible and most generally accepted one.</page><page sequence="13">Zoomorphic Decoration in Mozarabic Manuscripts 29 figurations. The decisive break with the classical style did not begin, however, until the Nordic animal motifs commenced to leave the edges or the strictly defined fields, gradually to extend over ever larger surfaces.64 At this stage, the formation of the first Northern animal style - Salin's Style I - was accomplished.5 Some variations of the animal forms which appeared during this development, ranging from the still relatively representational to the almost completely abstract are illustrated in Figs. 18-20. In Style I, the animal forms reveal themselves as the antithesis of the classical ones from which they initially derive. The zoomorphs are highly schematized; details tend to be elim- inated, and the major anatomical features (head, body, snout, eyes, etc.) are clearly outlined as individual, stereotyped sections. The zoomorphs take on the appearance of assembled objects; indeed, the separation of their body parts often results in giving them an insect-like aspect.66 The first Nordic style of animal ornament did not remain restricted to the Scandinavian countries, where its development actually took place. It spread out widely over mainland Germanic areas, and reached as far as Lombard Italy in the South, and Anglo-Saxon England in the West.7 The final development of Style I led to a late phase during which the bodies and jaws of the zoomorphs tended to become curved, drawn out, and ribbonlike; at the same time, simple interlace ornament began to appear in Germanic art.68 The next major form of Northern animal ornamentation has been defined by Salin as Style JI.69 The actual formation of this type is a complex problem, which cannot be dealt with at length here. It is possible that it took place immediately after the inivasion of Italy by the Lombards in A.D. 568, and that Mediterranean interlace decoration became incorporated into Lombard art, at first to compete, but eventually to fuse, with the Nordic animal types. The resulting zoomorphized interlace style would then have spread northward and eastward. However, it is also possible that Style II developed before the Lombard invasion, and in the Rhenish-Frankish areas, early in the sixth century. Thirdly, the possibility ex- ists that the explanation of the formation of Style II is to be sought in the English and Scandinavian material. In the latter case, it is the Lombards who would have received their animal ornamentation - both Styles I and II- from the North.70 The characteristics of Style II, and its relationship to Style I, are summarized by Professor Holmqvist: Style II clearly represents a general sobering-down after the wild orgies to which Style I abandoned itself in its later phases. An effort is made to recover greater balance in the com- position, and a certain preference is shown again for whole animal bodies, strictly formal- 64 Aberg, iII, 87. 65 Salin, pp. 214-245; see also Holmqvist, pp. 17-27. 66 Von Jenny, loc. cit., p. 299. 67 Aberg, in, 38. 68 Aberg, ii, 91. 69 Salin, pp. 245i-271. 70 Aberg, ii, 88, 91-94, 111-118; iII, 72 ff.

The hallmark of Style II, in Scandinavia as elsewhere, is the interlacing rhythm of movement; but this, at least at first, is not too complicated. A typical form is S-shaped animal bodies with heads bent back and biting downwards. These beasts are often arranged in rows or pairs, the two being sometimes intertwined to form a simple loop. Symmetrical or diametrically symmetrical forms of composition are very frequent, as are also leaf-scrolls in the "wave-pattern" style and "wave-crests" shaped in the form of animals' heads.7" What precisely the role of Germanic Style II was in the development of insular illumination and its derivatives as a whole is somewhat difficult to determine,72 but the problem becomes a bit more manageable if one assumes, with Professor Lowe, that the Book of Durrow is a Northumbrian and not an Irish work.73 There can be little doubt that Germanic ornament did influence the formation of the interlaced zoomorphs in the Book of Durrow, in which there appear the char- acteristic tuft-like extremities, and the jaws drawn out into trails, both elements present already in Style I, and extending into Style II, where the ribbon jaws become a very common feature; in addition, certain compositional features of the interlaced zoomorphs in the Book of Durrow can be related to Style II, e.g., the chains of ring-shaped animals (cf. Figs. 21, 22, 23).74 Some compositional group- ings seem germane only to the style's insular variants, having counterparts in Anglo-Saxon art (Fig. 24).75 However, the animals in the Book of Durrow do not reach the level of abstraction found in Germanic decorative arts; they appear to be a mixture of Germanic forms and more naturalistic forms of Mediterranean origin taken probably from Irish art.76 The Irish animal style itself, as exemplified in the Book of Lindisfarne or the Tara brooch, seems far too realistic to be derived directly from Style II; furthermore, it lacks such common features of the zoo- morphs in Style II as the snouts elongated into trails and the stereotyped tuft- 7n Holmqvist, p. 52. For the development of Style II in Lombard Italy, see Aberg, ii, 88-109; for the Germanic development in general, idem, iII, 72-118. The possibliity exists that Style II evolved initially parallel to Style I, and developed through successive stages into the eighth century. Indeed, from the middle of the seventh century onward, Scandinavian Style II seems to become influenced by its English variants; on this, see again Holmqvist, pp. 49-55. 72 "Germanic" here is used in the broadest sense and is meant to include Anglo-Saxon variants. 73 Lowe, C. L. A. ii, no. 9?73, pp. 43, 53. The author states that the book was "written in North- umbria by a hand trained in the Irish manner, and copied from an exemplar in the hand of St Colum- ba, the founder of Durrow ...." 74 The details from the mounts of the drinking horn found at Sutton Hoo illustrated in figs. 921 and 9292 are, according to Aberg, i, 60, in ordinary Style II, i.e.: "The animal ornament from Sutton Hoo is dominated by the Germanic Style II, and in it there are no elements from Celtic quarters. This ani- mal style in the find is mostly of ordinary development, and the compositions are based on well- known schemes. On the triangular mounts in fig. 31 [our figs. 921 and 9?9?] the influence from interlace has produced a trail-like composition of animal motifs, grouped in pairs . . .

All these observations lead Aberg to con- clude that the Germanic Style II and the zoomorph style of the earlier insular manuscripts are not directly related but represent parallel developments, condi- tioned in the former by the fusion of Germanic Style I zoomorphs with Mediter- ranean interlace, and in the latter by the meeting of the Celtic animal style with the same Mediterranean interlace.79 Thus, according to Aberg, the animal style of the Book of Durrow can be best understood as a product of the fusion of the Germanic and the Irish, difficult as the latter may be to define as such.80 Aberg presents this view as more reasonable than the one postulating that the zoo- morphic decoration in the Book of Durrow marked an initial phase in the devel- opment of the Irish animal style,8' a style which can perhaps be exemplified best in such works as the Book of Lindisfarne, dated about 700, which was also made in Northumbria. The lack of pure Germanic elements in the animal style of the Book of Lindisfarne, and its scarcity in later insular art, is thus explained as the result of a stifling of Germanic elements due to a progressively overwhelming influence of the Irish animal types, which included realistic elements from the Mediterranean world with which Ireland was in direct contact.82 77 Aberg, i, 113-116.

Professor Aberg's derivation of Style II has not been accepted by all leading archaeologists; thus, Holmqvist, p. 41, casts some doubt on the importance of Mediterranean interlace in the formation of Style II; he states: "The argument of the formative significance of the Mediterranean interlace ornament undoubtedly loses force when it is remembered that this form of ornament is considerably more in evidence in Burgundian and Frankish than Lango- bardic works.... It is also an important point that Style II appears in a considerably purer and more varied form in Anglo-Saxon and Scandinavian art than in Langobardic, where only a few, easily distinguishable motifs are used." 80 Aberg, I, 112. 81 For example, the view taken by Frangoise Henry, La Sculpture irlandaise pendant les douzes premiers siecles de l'ere chretienne (Paris, 1932), i, 61-63, 193-195. This author believed, when she wrote this work, that the Book of Durrow was made in Iona, and marked an early phase in the de- velopment of Irish art influenced by the Germanic, a phase followed by a further evolution depending on the acquisition of more realistic Mediterranean animal motifs through the intermediary of North- umbrian art. More recently, in her book, Art irlandais (Dublin, 1954), p. 31, Mlle Henry recognizes that the Book of Durrow may have been written in Northumbria, She believes, however, that the book must have been illuminated in Ireland itself, i.e.: "le fait que le manuscrit a WtE decore en Irlande, peut-6tre meme dans le monast6re colombain de Derry, tout proche de Fahan et de Carndonagh, ne peut guere 6tre mis en doute." 82 Aberg, i, 38-41, 54-66, 112-116, 119. Extremely important in respect to this whole question are the objects discovered in 1939 at Sutton Hoo in Southeast England (see n. 74 above). The find</page><page sequence="16">32 Zoomorphic Decoration in Mozarabic Manuscripts It should be clear from the brief survey just given that the development of interlaced zoomorphs, as they appear in the decoration of insular manuscripts and their derivatives, was a phenomenon which took place in the North (i.e., in Germanic, English, and Celtic areas).83 To this source only can we trace the tendency towards the creation of complex, twisted, and grotesque interlaced bit- ing forms which puzzle and startle the spectator. In some insular manuscripts, for example the Lindisfarne Gospels and the Book of Kells,84 this tendency is carried to the extreme. There, some animals - and even human beings in the Book of Kells - are not only twisted and interlaced, but become integrated with other abstract ornaments in a most peculiar way. For example, on fol. 139 of the Book of Lindisfarne85 the head and foreleg of a beast terminate the right margin of the page, which is conceived as the animal's body; for, at its other end, the margin becomes the creature's rump, hind legs, and tail, all twisted into a scroll. Similarly, on fol. 8r of the Book of Kells,86 at the upper center of the page, a human head and arm appear in profile view. The beard, tongue, and hair of the head are twisted into a fantastic interlace system; furthermore, the ribbons of the frame become the neck and shoulder of the man, so that the entire complex frame on three sides becomes his body; finally, in the lower left-hand corner, the frame ribbons once more acquire a biomorphic character, and become transformed into a pair of legs. Elsewhere (fol. 188 r)87 the entire decoration of the page is the body is roughly contemporaneous with the Book of Durrow. The objects found at Sutton Hoo are mostly in the Germanic style, but include also pieces of Irish, Byazntine, and Coptic workmanship. Signifi- cant is the appearance of some animal forms which combine some Celtic and Anglo-Saxon features. The role of Ireland in the formation of the Hiberno-Saxon style is summarized by Clapham, "Notes on the Origin of Hiberno-Saxon Art," Antiquity, viii (1934), 57, as follows: "We must conclude that Hiberno-Saxon art was in origin in no sense Irish but that the Irish perhaps welded its component parts into one style; that this welding probably took place in Northumbria in the second half of the 7th century, and that it was transmitted thence to Ireland and over half Europe." More recently, the importance of the r6le of Ireland in the development of insular art has been minimized by F. Masai, Essai sur les origines de la miniature dite irlandaise (Brussels, 1947); however, his conclusions, based in part on a number of misconceptions, have not been accepted by the leading scholars. See Frangoise Henry, "Les debuts de la miniature irlandaise," Gazette des Beaux-Arts, xxxvii (1950), 5-34, 139-148; Carl Nordenfalk, "Before the Book of Durrow," Acta Archaeologica, xvIII (1947), 141 if.; and Meyer Schapiro's review of Masai's book in the Gazette des Beaux Arts, xxxvii (1950), 134-138. 83 Henry, La Sculpture irlandaise, I, 194, compares the zoomorphs in these styles as follows: "I1 pourrait y avoir toute une zoologie de l'entrelacs-animal irlandais, une botanique de son d6cor v'getal. Le Germain, au contraire lorsqu'il regoit une bete bien constituee s'applique a la detruire. I1 veut effacer tout souvenir de structure, confondre tout effort pour retrouver une forme organisee. L'Irlandais aime la complication, mais il tient A la faire naitre de la combinaison d'elements parfaite- ment clairs. Le Germain cherche l'obscurite et par IA atteint souvent A la terreur." 84The entire Book of Kells is reproduced in two volumes published by Urs Graf-Verlag, with a third volume of text: Codex Cennanensi8: The Book of Kells in Three Volumes (Bern, 1950-1951); for descriptions of the Book of Kells, see E .H. Alton's Introduction (III, 11-23). See also Lowe, C. L. A., ii, no. 274, pp. 43, 53; Edward Sullivan, The Book of Kells (London, 1920). 86 This folio is reproduced in several publications, i.e., Eric George Millar, The Lindisfarne Gospels (London, 1923), plate XXXI; Zimmermann, Vorkarolingische Miniaturemn, plate XXI; Evangeliorum Quattuor Codex Lindisfarnensi8, II. 0 Fol. 8r of the Book of Kells is reproduced by Zimmermann, plate 179; also in Codex Cennanensi8, i. 87 Sullivan, The Book of Kell,, plate XIV; Codex Cennanensis, ii.</page><page sequence="17">Zoomorphic Decoration in MIozarabic Manuscripts 33 of a beast whose monstrous head above is terminated below by a pair of birdlike legs intertwined with its tail. On fol. 291,88 again, the entire decorated field is con- ceived as the body of a human figure, the head of which is seen above, the hands at the sides, and the feet below. On fol. 12r the figure of Matthew has a body which is the central stem of the first letter of his name (Fig. 60).89 This tendency to define an abstract ornament as the body of a creature through the addition of head and legs is found also in Carolingian art, where it seems to have been inspired, at least in part, by insular prototypes.90 Thus, the terminals of the S initial from the Second Bible of Charles the Bald, illustrated in Fig. 25, are the head and legs of a bird. In the same manuscript, there can be found a like motif in some of the canon tables. There, the capitals of the inner columns are lion heads, while the shafts, which are decorated with abstract ornaments, ter- minate below as the paws of the beasts (Fig. 26). This motif is not peculiar to the Second Bible of Charles the Bald, but is quite common in Carolingian illumina- tion.9" Actually, the zoomorphic decoration of Carolingian manuscripts, especially those of the Franco-Saxon group, is permeated with insular types.92 The whole interlace-beast of the Lindisfarne species certainly appears (Fig. 10); more com- mon, however, is the practice of transforming the lateral extensions of initial terminals, and other interlace systems, into animal heads (cf. Figs. 27, 28, 29). A curious variation of the interlace animal is a form in which the interlace actually pierces the beast's body instead of going over or under it.93 This device was observed by Kendrick in a number of works,94 for example, the eighth- century English manuscript now in Rome, Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana, 88 Sullivan, The Book of Kells, plate XVIII; Zimmermann, plate 172; Codex Cennanensi8, II. 89 Compositions similar to those described above appear also in other insular manuscripts, for example in t-he Book of St Chad (see Zimmermann, plate 246. P. Meyer, "Notes on the Art and Orna- ment," in Codex Cennanensis, iII, 37, having observed these compositional features on the folios of the Book of Kells mentioned above, as well as some others, states: "In mediaeval northern art the forms are animalized from the outside by the addition of animal or human heads and limbs. No ac- count is taken of the organic coherence of the parts; for instance, on 8r the head at the top is sepa- rated from the legs by a long stretch of non-representational ornament, and the separation on 183r looks still more crass because the two parts are rendered more naturalistically." 90 It may be, however, that these motifs, as they appear in Carolingian illuminations, derive also in parts from the Merovingian zoomorphic initial tradition. 91 In the Psalter of Folchard, to give only one other example. On fol. 11 of the manuscript, the capitals of two of the columns are composed of lion heads and forepaws; the shafts, decorated with complex systems of plant ornaments, terminate below as the interlaced hind paws and tails of the beasts. Although heavily decorated with plant ornaments, this manuscript shows distinct insular features in its interlace, interlace zoomorphic, and other abstract ornamentations. On the sciip- torium of St Gall in relation to insular influences, and further bibliography, consult Micheli, pp. 122- 124 (see also n. 61 above). Fol. 11 of the Psalter of Folchard is reproduced by Boinet, La Miniature Carolingienne, plate CXLII. The motif of the animal-column, as it appears in Carolingian art, may depend in part on the animal-capital and animal-column-base types discussed above. 92 No attempt can be made here to describe in detail the complicated zoomorphic decoration of insular and Carolingian illuminations; we must restrict ourselves to forms which have, as will appear subsequently, clearly found their way into Mozarabic art. 93 This form is described by Kendrick, Anglo-Saxon Art, p. 145. " Ibid.</page><page sequence="18">34 Zoomorphic Decoration in Mozarabic Manuscript8 Barberini, lat. 570;95 in ninth-century English sculpture, and West Saxon metal work; in Continental metal works, both Frankish and Scandinavian; in Carolin- gian illumination;9" and in the Book of Kells. Because he believes the motif to be rare in Celtic art, Kendrick suggests that it may be a Carolingian invention which found its way into English illumination. However, it seems more likely that the motif is an insular invention. Thus, in the Design from the Sutton Hoo drinking horn, illustrated in Fig. 22, the bodies of the animals are transformed into grills at their crossing points, and penetrate one another. Similarly, in the detail from fol. 2v of the Book of Lindisfarne, illustrated in Fig. 59, we note that the neck and tail of each bird has been transformed into ribbons which become interlaced in such a way that the neck of a given animal is literally penetrated through and through by the tail of the preceding one. That the penetration systems in the Kells animals derive from the Lindisfarne type, and not Carolingian models, seems almost certain; thus, it is interesting to note that in the detail from the Book of Kells illustrated in Fig. 61 the penetrations take place in sections of the animals' bodies which have been transformed into ribbons. Certainly, it is logical to assume that the appearance of this device in later English and Continental illumination depends also on prototypes of the Lindisfarne family.97 Fig. 30 95 The manuscript has been placed in North England by Kendrick, op. cit., p. 144, and Micheli, p. 28; it is placed in South England by Zimmermann, text, p. 140. Lowe, C. L. A., i, no. 63, states only: "Written probably in England in part by a scribe Wigbald (fol. 153)." Reproductions of the pages on which the penetrations are found appear in Zimmermann, plates 313a; 315a, b; 316b; 317a, b. 96 That is to say, in the ninth-century Gospels in the New York Pierpont Morgan Library (Ms. 728, fol. 13); but there, it is not a case of ribbons piercing a beast, but of climbing plants growing through the columns of the calendar tables. In metalwork the motif is found on the book cover from Lindau-am-Bodensee, also in the Morgan Library, to give only one example; the cover is reproduced by Schlunk, Art Bulletin, xxxii (1950), fig. 24, opposite p. 111. 97 This is also the view taken by Micheli, p. 85. The author discusses a late Merovingian Gospel Book made in Northeastern Gaul, now in the Essen Domschatz; the penetration systems in this work are quite extensive (see her figs. 113, 114, and especially 116). She concludes: "Ce systeme de per- foration qui avait apparu dans la miniature hiberno-northumbrienne, dans L'Evangeliaire de Lindis- farne, des le d6but du VIIIe siecle, qui s'6tait repandu surtout dans le Sud de l'Angleterre, est ici particulierement developpe...... It would appear that there must be a direct relationship between the penetration systems found on the Sutton Hoo drinking horn (Fig. 22), and those in the Book of Lindisfarne (Fig. 59). If it is agreed with Professor Aberg that the animal designs on the drinking horn are in ordinary Style II (see n. 74 above), then it follows that some direct influence from the Style is reflected in the decoration of the Book of Lindisfarne. It would also seem logical to assume that the penetration motif is somehow related to the system of intersecting animal bodies, which Aberg, i, 63 considers a Style II feature. This, however, is not quite what he believes, for he states: "Thus in the Northumbrian Book of Lindisfarne no traces whatever of the Germanic style features are observed . . . " (ibid., p. 116); and, having discussed the transformation of the Germanic animal style through the influence of Medi- terranean interlace which "caused the jaws and the eye sockets to pass into ribbon trails, and the ani- mal bodies to become drawn out like ribbons and at times, in an extremely unnatural, but very char- acteristic manner, to intersect each other, as if they were rather interlaced trails than animals" (ibid., p. 119), he goes on to say, on p. 120: "The Irish animal style lacks direct counterparts to this development, even though interlace asserted itself there in various ways, such as in interlacing of necktufts, of tails and neck parts.... Although not entirely convincing, we will accept Professor Aberg's point of view, for the time being, as that of a superior authority (see, however, n. 79 above).</page><page sequence="19">Zoomorphic Decoration in Mozarabic Manuscripts 35 illustrates a late eighth-century example from the School of Canterbury;98 Fig. 31, an eighth-century example from a Hiberno-Northumbrian center;99 and Fig. 32, a Carolingian example from Tours.100 III Let us turn now once more to tenth-century Mozarabic manuscripts. On fol. 70r of the Codex Vigilanus (Fig. 63) the capitals of the columns are conceived as semicircular ribbons terminating in animal heads, facing one another, and biting the edges of the arches. At the base of each column shaft one can see the hind legs of the creatures - goatlike two-headed monsters with bodies composed of column shafts elaborately decorated with interlace. The legs and heads of the beasts are, for the most part, relatively realistic, but they have been incorporated into the abstract decoration. Similarly, on fol. 67r of the book (Fig. 692) the three arches are held by human figures, of which the heads and torsos are shown; how- ever, the three decorated column shafts become their bodies, and, below, the lateral ribbons are transformed into legs and feet. These features are so much like those described above in certain Franco-Saxon and related works that the similarity can hardly be accidental (cf. Figs. 26, 63).101 Also in the Codex Vigilanus there are a number of separate animal heads, which are used to finish off, laterally, the extended curving ends of interlace systems (Figs. 33, 34, 35); elsewhere, they are used to terminate interlace loops inside a column base (Fig. 36). Structurally, these forms are also similar to those found in insular manuscripts and Continental works influenced by them (i.e., Figs. 27, 28, 29, 37). The Vigilanus heads are not, in themselves, exactly like those in the insular or Carolingian works; it is in the fusing of the anatomical parts with ribbon ends and loops that the similarity is evident, and the connec- tion with the North, in this respect, is distinctly felt. It is interesting to note that 98 On the Stockholm Codex Aureus, see Zimmermann, text, pp. 286-289; Micheli, pp. 31-32, 62, 93. 99 On the manuscript in Durham, from which the detail illustrated in Fig. 31 is taken, consult Lowe, C. L. A., ii, no. 149, pp. 10, 149. Professor Lowe observes that the manuscript was "written probably in Northumbria, in a great center of calligraphy in the direct line of Irish tradition, or else in Ireland itself. Its text is not Northumbrian but Irish." 100 The manuscript from which we took the detail illustrated in our fig. 32 is described by Edward Kennard Rand and Leslie Webber Jones, The Earliest Book of Tours (Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1934), p. 96; Micheli, pp. 93-94; Leslie Webber Jones, "The Text of the Bible and the Script and Art of Tours," Harvard Theological Review, xxvIII, (1935), 136 Sf. The manuscript appears to be a post-Alcuinian one, dating perhaps from the regime of Fridugisus, according to Professor Jones; this despite the fact that its decoration seems earlier in style when compared with that in other works from Tours. Penetrations occur also in late Merovingian illumination (i.e., see above, note 97). They are common in English illumination, and, in addition to the examples mentioned above, appear also in the manuscript in Leningrad, lat. F.V.I.N.8. (see above, note 39) - consult Zimmermann, plate 321, which illustrates fol. 12r of the manuscript; and on fol. 0 of the Gospel Book in the Maeseyck Church of St Catherine (Zimmermann, pl. 318a; Micheli, plate 37; Nordenfalk, in Early Medieval Painting, plate on p. 120); The bird initial from the Second Bible of Charles the Bald illustrated in fig. 25, with its beak, legs and head-crest intertwined with the double ribbon of its body, must also be related to beasts with penetrated body parts discussed above. 101 Columns with human heads and feet are found in the ninth-century Northern Gaul manuscript in Paris, B. N., lat. 11956, fol. 8v (Micheli, plate 217).</page><page sequence="20">36 Zoomorphic Decoration in Mozarabic Manuscripts in the head shown in Fig. 35 the tendency towards realism has been virtually lost; there the interlace-scroll end is retained entirely but has been given a zoo- morphic character through the addition of such features as eyes, ears, and snout. Although the form is somewhat complicated by the decorative row of circles be- tween the two curved ribbons, it is evident that it is quite similar to certain of the more stylized interlace-zoomorph types common in Franco-insular art, in which the character of the interlace-scroll is almost wholly retained, except for some slight modifications at the point of attachment of the snout (cf. Figs. 29, 35). Thus, it appears as if the interlace zoomorphs of the Codex Vigilanus repre- sent a form of decoration which proceeds from Carolingian derivatives of insular types but resists complete geometrization and tends to retain in many cases some representational features. In the motif from the Codex Vigilanus illustrated in Fig. 40 the head of the beast is fused with a ribbon and a plant form, reminding us of interlace zoomorphs found in such Carolingian manuscripts as the Psalter of Folchard, made in St Gall, a center where plant ornament tended progressively to become a dominant feature and fused with residual pre-Carolingian and insu- lar forms (cf. Figs. 39, 40).102 Turning now to the Codex Aemilianensis, we see that this manuscript, too, is permeated with interlace zoomorphs. These are invariably of the more abstract variety, which, as was noted above, is found in Carolingian works, and (though rarely) in the Codex Vigilanus; that is to say, it is a type in which the interlace scroll wholly, or almost wholly, retains its character, but to which eyes, jaws or beak, and ears have been added to render it animal-like. The jaws of the Aemili- anensis heads tend to be quite long, and even seem to form twisted, closed bands, though this may be due to the strong curling of the snouts (Fig. 41). According to Aberg, jaws extended into trails and closed jaws are not Celtic features but appear in Style II animals, to some extent in the Book of Durrow, and in some later English manuscripts (cf. Figs. 31, 41, 43).103 Although rare in the Book of Lindisfarne, animal heads with long jaws or beaks which seem closed at their peaks do sometimes appear (Cf. figs. 44, 45). The curled-up snouts, much exag- gerated in some of the Aemilianensis heads (Fig. 42), represent a feature which may have originated in the Orient but becomes a characteristic element in Celtic art;'04 it is present also in many of the Vigilanus heads (Figs. 33, 40). However, the direct prototypes for the Aemilianensis variant must surely have been a Franco-Saxon model (cf. Figs. 41, 42, 44, and 29). It is interesting to note that the Aemilianensis head illustrated in Fig. 42 is integrated with the interlace system in the same peculiar manner as the Carolingian head shown in Fig. 37;105 i.e., the interlace scrolls are transformed into the heads of beasts which bite an outermost scroll-ribbon, arising from the interlace core and looping around the heads. 102 See above, note 91. 103 Aberg, i, 115-118. 104 Ibid., pp. 40-41. 105 For the bibliography on the Franco-Saxon manuscript from which we drew the detail illustrated in Fig. 37, and a discussion of its position within the Franco-Saxon school, see Micheli, pp. 137, 142.</page><page sequence="21">S f N CATAONIt N e.g TOLDL 0 uL -\,tA EDA C-DA f 0.1. 4S .5. 1.

The animals which make up the base are combined with interlace ornament in a most peculiar way. The inter- lace itself is made up partly of plant forms, and resembles a grape-vine motif; but the beasts are not related to it in the usual Mediterranean manner, where the creature is simply intertwined with the stems, and may hold foliage in its mouth.'06 In the Codex Aemilianensis, on both sides, the ribbon enters the ani- mal's mouth, goes through its throat, comes out at the back of its neck, flows towards its trunk, and pierces it; then twists around to form a scroll interlace terminal finished off as an animal head by the addition of eyes, ears, and snout. These features are not Oriental but Northern. Particularly telling is the penetra- tion of the bodies by ribbons, a motif which was discussed at some length above (Figs. 22, 30, 31, 32, 59, 61). We chose to deal with only two Spanish manuscripts in the preceding section. It would not be possible to discuss at length here all the Mozarabic manuscripts of Leon-Castile in which unmistakably Northern zoomorphic forms appear; this would, in fact, involve a great deal of repetition. It must be pointed out, however, that Northern animal decoration is not peculiar to the Codices Vigilanus and Aemilianensis alone. Indeed, the illuminators of San Millan de la Cogolla, where the latter was made, had a predilection for this type of ornamentation. Thus, in the very work from this scriptorium from which we illustrate the crossed ibexes initial in Fig. 46, and which has received so much attention as a result of its Oriental character, there appears a number of complex Northern interlace zoo- morphs, and interlace initials without zoomorphic additions, which are almost exactly like those in the Codex Aemilianensis.'07 This is true also of another tenth- century work from San Mill'an, of which some folios are reproduced by Clark.'08 The interlace zoomorph was a favorite motif also for the artists of Cardefia and Silos (fig. 1).109 In the St Gregory Moralia in Madrid (Biblioteca Nacional, Sign. Vit. 14-2), the work of the calligrapher Florentius, there is a large initial, the inter- lace terminals of which become delicate bird heads."10 Again, the animals are 106 For example, the animals on the ivory Box of Silos, a Moorish work dated A.D. 1026 now in the Burgos Museum (see Ars Hispaniae, iII, fig. 368). 107 Clark, in Transactions of the Connecticut Academy, XXIV, plates 33-36 (fol. 20; the folio on which appear the end of the commentary on Psalm XXXIV, and the beginning of Psalm XXXV, fols. 103v, and 199v); see also pp. 40 (no. 584), 172-180. Clark observes (pp. 43, 173) that the interesting initials in the manuscript may be by the same hand as those in another work from the same scriptorium (Madrid, Real Academia de la Historia, 56; his MS. 601). 108 Ibid., no. 598 (pp. 42, 164-168, and plates 928-929). The manuscript is in Madrid, Real Academia de la Historia, 39; Clark reproduces fols. 65r, 94v. 109 Pages from a manuscript executed in San Pedro de Cardefia in 949 (now in the J. Rylands Li- brary in Manchester), on which appear such zoomorphs, are reproduced by Dommnguez Bordona, Exposici6n, fig. 8, and by Montague Rhodes James, A Descriptive Catalogue of the Latin Manuscrits in the John Rylands Library at Manchester (Manchester, 1921), ii, plates 120-122. See also Micheli, figs. 266 and 267, in which she reproduces pages from a tenth-eleventh century manuscript from Silos (Paris, B.

The conclusions relating to the sources of the animal dec- oration in these books can be safely applied only to those works made in the free zone of Leon-Castile.1"3 Obviously, many of the zoomorpbs which appear in the illuminations in this region are Eastern types; some of them may derive directly from Oriental models, but many others derive from Northern variants of Eastern forms. Furthermore, a large number of zoomorphic decorations are structurally so much akin to Northern animal ornaments that the latter must have provided the models - and these must specifically have been, for the most part, Franco- insular derivatives of Hiberno-Saxon archetypes. The very character of the decorated pages in many works of Leon-Castile de- pends on their interlace and zoomorphic ornamentation, which will often make up the major compositional masses in the design. These Mozarabic manuscripts contain an unreal world of vibrating letters and twisted zoomorphs, a world in which human figures are reduced to the form of delicate mechanical objects. This treatment of organic forms reminds us very much of the "fantastic artifice of Northern ornament."1"4 Indeed, even in the image of the "Oriental" cavalier in the Beatus of Gerona (Fig. 51), the lance which passes behind the body of the man, but over the neck of the horse, articulates in a rhythmic over-under alterna- tion reminiscent of the complex weaving motion of a Northern interlace-ribbon."'

Dominguez Bordona, in Spanish Illumination, i, 20, observes that in eleventh- century Mozarabic manuscripts, there is a marked change of style characterized, in parts, "by the substitution for native ornamental details of those of French and Irish origin.... 113 Zoomorphic decorations in Toledan and Andalusian works were not thoroughly examined durinrg the course of this study. 114 Meyer Schapiro "The Decoration of the Leningrad Manuscript of Bede," Scriptorium, xii (1958), 202, thus aptly describes this kind of stylization. 115 Georgiana Goddard King, "Divagations on the Beatus," Art Studies, Medieval Renaissance and Modern (Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1930), p. 24, observed: "Opening the Beatus now at Burgos de Osma we find along with traits characteristic of the scriptorium of San Millan such interlaced and racing figures as belong by definition to England alone......</page></plain_text>
