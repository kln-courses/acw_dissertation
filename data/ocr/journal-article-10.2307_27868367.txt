DIANNE VAN OOSTERHOUT Eastern Indonesia is known among anthropologists as the area in which the notion of the 'flow of life' is emphasized. It is also the area that F.A.E. van Wouden, a true pupil of the Dutch structuralist J.P.B, de Josselin de Jong, believed to form a cultural region, sharing a common structural core of mar riage system, clan system and socio-cosmic dualism. Therik's ethnography fits into this tradition by exploring dual symbolic classifications such as male/female, centre/periphery and inside/outside as these are used by the South Tetun in the southern plains of Timor, and by the Wehali in particu lar, to organize and perpetuate society. However, following Fox, Therik also distances himself from this predefined model by focusing on 'metaphors for living'. These emic metaphors allow for the analysis of local (dual) catego ries. They also allow the integration of eastern Indonesian societies that do not possess such a structural core, but that do link up with shared themes such as precedence or uma (the house). Linguistic evidence, myth analysis, and the transcription of words and texts function to make local perceptions and meanings the starting point of the analysis. Therik's contribution to our knowledge of eastern Indonesia lies first and foremost in the way he reveals the internal dynamics, flexibility, and poetic quality of local knowledge sys tems, and the ways these link up with daily practice and social structure. This publication will appeal mainly to (symbolic) anthropologists and socio linguists, and, to some extent, to historians. Wehali is identified as the ritual centre of the island of Timor and, con ceptually, of the world. Wehali was once the centre of a network of tributary</page><page sequence="2">196 Book reviews states and the seat of a spiritual figure of traditional authority. This figure was the source of life from which the surrounding domains derived their prosperity. Historically, tribute was paid to Wehali for the performance of the rituals of life. In its contemporary setting this centre continues to maintain its rituals and traditions, and to be a source of life for its peripheral domains. Wehali is considered to be a female centre, and its 'Great Lord', although male, to be a 'Female lord'. Embodied in his person is the fundamental Timorese idea that ultimate authority is defined as female. This has conse quences for the ways in which land and property are divided: all land and houses pass from women to women. It also has consequences for marriage exchange, in which it is the men who are exchanged among related 'female houses'. As the source of life, Wehali is the husband-giver to other areas of Timor. This contrasts sharply with the common association of the flow of life with wife-givers and the exchange of women among 'male houses'. A central dual symbolic classification in this book is the dichotomy outside-inside, or outsiders-insiders, which finds expression in two major 'metaphors for living': paths and precedence. Paths appear to relate prima rily to the application of dual categories to origins, expressing the distance and route to the source of life. According to the origin myths of the Tetun, their domain is the place of origin of humans, which means that nobody is completely an outsider: every outsider is potentially a returning insider. However, there seem to be several insider categories. Therik, born in another part of the Tetun-speaking area, is considered to be more 'inside' than outsid ers from elsewhere. But it takes the mastering of the ritual language of the ancestors to become truly part of the source domain and to gain access to the power of Wehali. Therik's endeavour to unravel this ritual language may thus be read both as a blueprint for local power relations, and as a reversed life-cycle journey, a journey back in time, tracing 'the old path of the ances tors'. Such paths reappear throughout the chapters in different forms, such as the path of men through marriage, or, in a reversed route, the path along which crops are reciprocated from the periphery to the centre in return for the flow of life. Following in the footsteps of various (Australian) anthropologists who, in the last two decades of the twentieth century, explored alternative perspec tives on eastern Indonesian societies, Therik employs the theme of 'prec edence' in analysing patterns of social or ritual relationships. These patterns result from the application of dual categories (outside and inside) by the peo ple of the region in defining the nature of their social relationships. Therik argues that the phrase fo baa, 'giving away', is used to indicate that Wehali is the origin of all societies. 'Thus the notion of "centre-periphery" begins at this point' (p 69). The Wehali people further elaborate the concepts of centre and periphery in various idiomatic expressions which imply centrality and</page><page sequence="3">Book reviews 197 precedence. Some such expressions are botanical (trunk, source), others anthropomorphic (umbilical cord), still others related to the house (inside). These idioms, familiar in many eastern Indonesian societies, stress the direc tion of the flow of life. By taking an inward-looking approach, Therik misses the chance to place Tetun within a wider comparative perspective. His material repeatedly pro vides moments at which interesting and significant parallels could have been drawn with other Austronesian societies, or at which he may have contrib uted to regional theory-building. Even in the concluding chapter we find no serious effort to make a clear statement, or to stress the relevance of his impor tant conclusions in a wider context. This omission leaves it up to the reader to decide on the positioning of the Tetum, and severely limits the contribution of the book to the study of (eastern) Indonesian societies. Furthermore, the material is presented as representing a view that is shared by all members of society. Perhaps this is related to the focus of the study on local origin myths, which, as the author stresses, have to be told using the words of the ancestors to avoid misfortune. In any case we miss out on internal dynamics, status and gender differences, and contested or conflicting claims to precedence. This reinforces the impression that what is being presented is an idealized version of local history. Therik pays very little attention to processes of social change or to the realities of individual members of society. Another point of criticism concerns the use of local terminology. Throughout the text, Therik provides ample functional examples of local narrative genres (such as origin myths, ritual speech, poetry), but it is rather difficult to keep track of the local terminology which he uses so abundantly. The fact that the glossary is more elaborate than the bibliography exemplifies the imbalance here between local perceptions and regional comparisons. Nevertheless, the result is a thorough view of Tetun perceptions of origins and social order.</page></plain_text>
