<plain_text><page sequence="1">PRIMITIVE MAGIC AND MANA H. PHILSOOPH University of Edinburgh Magic has not received sufficient theoretical attention in anthropology in recent decades, and particularly not in comparison with such related subjects as religion (in general), witchcraft, taboo or totemism. The last general work of significance is still Malinowski's essay, 'Magic, science and religion', published in i925. Many important questions thus remain to be discussed, and one of these is whether, in primitive societies, magical world-view is, or is not, personalistic; whetherfor the actor magic is, or is not, concerned with conscious or personal agents, that is, with ' spiritual beings'. A hundred years ago, Tylor (i865; I87I) tried to explain magic in terms of the association of ideas, taking the view that magic does not involve a belief in con- scious agents. This view, which was developed by Frazer (I890; 9 i I) and may also be found in Hegel (I895), is still dominant in anthropology. So, for instance, Pid- dington (I950: 363) declares that: ' ... our idea of magic is of something which: (a) produces results directly, that is, without the intervention of spiritual beings ... .'; Beals and Hoijer (I959: 553) make the same distinction: 'Religion, as we have seen, involves, among other things, belief in supernatural beings, whose actions relative to man may be influenced and even controlled. Magic, on the other hand, presupposes a rigid relation of cause and effect, unaffected by supernatural beings'. Others distinguish between those kinds of beliefs and practices which involve reference to more or less 'personalised' spiritual beings, such as gods, ghosts and spirits, and those which do not, implying instead the notion of an impersonal, unindividualised power (Beattie I964: 212). Levi-Strauss (I966: 22I) puts it as follows: ' .. . it can, in a sense, be said that religion consists in a humanization of natural laws and magic in a naturalization of human actions ... The anthropomorphism of nature (of which religion consists) and the physiomorphism of man (by which we have defined magic) constitute two components which are always given and vary only in proportion'. It is true that some ethnographic descriptions report that in some primitive societies magic is concerned with the belief in conscious agents. But this fact has not led scholars to dispute the general validity of the Frazerian view regarding primitive societies. Tylor and Frazer were not unaware of this fact, which can hardly be overlooked even if the available ethnographic materials are not of a high standard. Thus Tylor writes: 'Magic includes the result of two principles. On the one hand it may seek the aid of spiritual beings, in which case its theory forms part of religion . . .' (I874: 6o). Elsewhere he says: 'A large proportion of them [magical rites] belong to the general theory of religion, inasmuch as their efficacy is ascribed to the intervention of spiritual beings' (I889: I99). Likewise, in Frazer's (I9II: 226-33) evolutionary scheme of thought, there is a stage in which</page><page sequence="2">PRIMITIVE MAGIC AND MANA I83 religion and magic are fused, and consequently magic is seen sometimes to involve reference to conscious agents. Yet, there is still a tendency to suppose that in primi- tive societies in its pure or ideal form magic does not assume the existence of conscious agents and that, if it sometimes does so, this is to be explained by its combination with religion. This article argues that in primitive societies magic is, from the point of view of the actor, concerned with conscious agents. These agents are believed to be con- scious or personal, or, if it is preferred, 'animate' or ' spiritual', in the sense that they are believed, among other things, to be able to understand and respond to what the magician does and says in magical rites and spells. The magician performs the magical act, not in a vacuum, but in order to express his ideas and feelings to, and establish a relationship with them.' This argument is intended to be applied only to primitive magic, that is, to what has been considered as magic in anthropological research on primitive societies. It could lose its significance and validity to a lesser or greater degree when applied to some other types of magic. It is not, for example, significant for medieval magic because it is taken for granted, a fact often neglected in anthropology, that this magic is, for the actor, related to conscious agents. Nor is it quite valid in this connexion, as medieval magic in a broader sense has a proto-scientific aspect (Thorndike 1923). As far as the relation between magic and the agents is concerned, there cannot be an argument which equally holds true for all the senses in which the term 'magic' is used, and there can hardly be an argument which does not hold true for magic in one or some of its senses. The Frazerian view in question is partly or wholly applicable to some of the medieval and modem senses of magic in spite of the fact that it is not, as will be shown, applicable to primitive magic for which it is primarily intended. In addition to trying to show that, far from being impersonal as is traditionally assumed, magic is personalistic, I have two further objectives. I shall attempt a critical analysis of Malinowski's concept of 'magical virtue' and that of 'mana'; and I shall hope to apply and demonstrate the importance of the following methodological assumption: In anthropology, a set of beliefs should be studied at two clearly defined stages. First, the observer should attempt to understand the beliefs in terms of the actor's conscious formulation of them. Second, he should endeavour to go deeper and formulate his own explanatory view of the beliefs in question, a view of which the actor is himself not usually conscious. The actor's conscious formulation of a set of beliefs should not be mistaken for his explanations for it. His explanations are often rationalisations which are useful to consider, but may not be essential to the observer's study. These two stages should be distinguished as clearly as possible because this reduces the ever-present danger, that the observer will tend to project his own ideas on to the actor. Examples of projections of this kind will be seen in the study of magical virtue and mana. The first-stage study, which is all that is offered here, must precede the second-stage one. For the observer should have a correct understanding of what the beliefs in question actually are, before he can form his own theory of them. There is often a tendency on the part of the observer not to concentrate sufficiently on the first-stage study. As will be shown, some prominent recent scholars have propounded new 'theories' of mana without first having</page><page sequence="3">184 H. PHILSOOPH adequately considered the actor's conscious conception of mana. The same is true with primitive magic. The actor's conscious formulations here have been so neg- lected that in many fundamental respects, the Frazerian view is still dominant.2 Most of the evidence I shall examine comes from Malinowski's study of Tro- briand magic and Evans-Pritchard's work on Zande magic. Malinowski's is the most detailed ethnographic report on primitive magic, while Evans-Pritchard's work constitutes the most intensive ethnographic record on magical agents which, as will be shown, are embodied in 'medicines' among the Azande. The fact that Evans-Pritchard's research on Zande witchcraft and magic is best known for its important and pioneering contribution to witchcraft studies is itself an indication of the extent to which, in recent decades, far more attention has been paid to witch- craft than to magic. For the book is in fact equally important for the light it sheds on magic. Again, it seems to be generally held (quite erroneously, as I shall show) that Trobriand and Zande magic are not basically concerned with conscious agents. So these classical studies will provide on the one hand convenient evidence with which to examine my argument and, on the other, the opportunity for considering some of the ethnographic and theoretical reasons which are usually given for the opinion that, for the actor, primitive magic does not involve agents. Trobriand magic3 In his research on the Trobriand Islanders, Malinowski does not show much interest in the relation between Trobriand magic and conscious agents. In some instances, however, it is clear that Trobriand magic is associated with entities, such as ancestral spirits, which are obviously conscious agents. As he explicitly ack- nowledges, Malinowski was not able to investigate as fully as he would have wished the relation between Trobriand magic and these agents. Thus, in Coral gardens and their magic, in the section called 'Some detailed statements about errors of omission and commission', he writes: 'What is exactly the relation between the mischance brought about by the offended spirits and mischance brought about by malicious magic? I cannot say, for again I have not investigated this problem as fully in the field as I should have done' (i966a: 468). Several lines later, referring to the fact that in some magical practices spirits are invoked and assumed to be present, he states: 'But here again I have not gone deeply enough into the subject to ascertain what they [spirits] do and whether they are really believed to be there . . .' As far as their religion is concerned, Malinowski presents a most elaborate account of the Trobrianders' beliefs in the spirits of the dead (baloma) and the part these spirits play in the annual harvest festival (milamala). Yet even in the study of religious practices, he does not always pay sufficient attention to the supposed existence and significance of conscious agents. For example, in the analysis of funeral ceremonies which he treats as religious practices, only the social aspect of the ceremonies is taken into account. It is argued that in the course of the ceremonies the dead man is spiritually absent, because his spirit (baloma) has already left his body for the island of the dead (Tuma). Hence the reason his wife and his relatives-in-law mourn and perform the active role in the ceremonies is to express their grief and sympathy only in relation to his matrilineal kinsmen and not to the dead man himself. As Malinowski puts it: 'And what makes the whole performance most disconcerting is the absence of the real protagonist-Hamlet without the prince of</page><page sequence="4">PRIMITIVE MAGIC AND MANA Denmark. For the spirit of the dead man knows nothing about all that happens to his body and bones, and cares less, since he is already leading a happy existence in Tuma . . . The ritual performances . . . and all that is donc with his relics, is merely a social game, where the various groupings into which the community has re-crystallized at his death play against each other' (I957: I27). But is the protagonist in the drama of death really absent? Shortly after this quotation, one finds Malinowski saying that the dead man's matrilineal kinsmen are tabooed from approaching, washing, adorning, caressing and burying the corpse, for 'if they were to touch or come near it, pernicious influences from the body would attack them and cause their disease and death'. The 'pernicious influences' are then described as follows: 'These pernicious influences are con- ceived in the form of a material exhalation, issuing from the corpse and polluting the air. It is called bwaulo, a word which also designates the cloud of smoke which surrounds a village especially on steamy, calm days. The necrogenic bwaulo, invisible to common eyes, appears to a witch or sorcerer as a black cloud shrouding the village. It is innocuous to strangers, but dangerous to kinsmen'. There are some grounds for thinking that this 'material exhalation' which Malinowski also calls 'a special substance' (I957: 379) is a 'soul' or a conscious agent. First, it is harmless to strangers but harmful to matrilineal kinsmen, it is therefore able to distinguish two groups of people from each other and to treat each quite differently. In other words, it is capable of understanding and response. Second, the qualities of being quasi-ethereal and visible only to spiritually-gifted men, or in special conditions, are two characteristics which are widely ascribed to souls in primitive societies. As a matter of fact, the baloma is also conceived of as possessing both these characteristics (Malinowski 1948: 135-46). Third, the idea that the baloma leaves the body immediately after death is not in contradiction with the belief in the existence of a soul in the dead man, because in many primitive societies man is believed to have more than one 'soul'. Among the Mailu, studied by Malinowski himself, man is said to have three souls: a 'vital principle' which is the breath and resides in the breast and ceases to exist after death, a 'spiritual part' which goes to the world of the dead, and finally, a 'spirit' which is, among other things, present in the mortuary rites (I9I5: 653, 690-I). In the Trobriand Islands, besides the baloma a sorcerer has a soul called kosi. This soul, which also has the above-mentioned two characteristics, does not go to the island of the dead, but for a short time stays near the dead man's village and then vanishes.4 There is, however, no need to assume that the soul present in the funeral cere- monies of the Trobrianders is different from baloma. It is widely believed that spirits and souls are able to be in more than one place at the same time. So, for instance with reference to the Kalabari, Horton writes: 'Thus, whereas a Kalabari would be as contemptuous as we should of someone who talked about a table as being in two places at one time, he would not be so of someone who said the same thing of a spirit: for instance, the dead, who are thought to exist "in spirit" only, can be talked of without any sense of contradiction as both "in the sky with God" and as "in the burial ground. . ."' (I96I: 205). It could thus be argued that after death the baloma dwells in two places at the same time. On the one hand, it is in the island of the dead, for it 'leaves the body immediately after death has occurred and goes to Tuma' (Malinowski I948: I3 0),</page><page sequence="5">i86 H. PHILSOOPH and on the other, it is still associated with the body, as it should take with itself the 'spiritual' essence of the objects which are offered to it in the funeral ceremonies: 'After death the bereaved relatives adorn the corpse with all the native ornaments which the deceased had possessed. They also put on his body all his other vaigu'a (valuables), in the first place his ceremonial axe blades (beku). The spirit is supposed to carry these away with him to Tuma-in their "spiritual" aspect, of course' (I948: I32). Although Malinowski does not himself sufficiently emphasise the presence of conscious agents, his ethnography is so brilliant and rich that it can throw signifi- cant light on the communicative aspect of the magical act. In Trobriand magic, the supposed intervention of some of the agents is plain. Many spells are solely or at least partly addressed to ancestral spirits, indeed the invocation of these spirits is 'perhaps the most universal feature of Trobriand spells' (I957: 328).5 For example, at the harvest, the magician lays some offerings on the hearthstones and 'addressing the ancestral spirits he utters this short incantation': 'Let us give up last year's food, O old men; let us eat the new food instead' (i966a: I67). The very first spell cited in Argonauts of the western Pacific is addressed to some wood sprites which are asked to leave the trees prepared for felling: 'Come down, O wood sprites, 0 Tokway, dwellers in branches, come down! Come down, dwellers in branch forks, in branch shoots! Come down, come, eat! Go to your coral outcrop over there; crowd there, swarm there, be noisy there, scream there! *..' (I964: I27). Bush-pigs are dangerous to gardens and should be driven away. Commenting upon a spell which refers to bush-pigs, Malinowski writes: 'I have divided it [the spell] into two parts, the first being a compound address, probably to the ancestral spirits and certainly to the bush-pigs, the second an exorcism'; and later: 'It is rather stated in a loud persuasive voice, obviously meant to reach the bush-pigs' (i966b: 266). Moreover, the Trobrianders say: 'As the magicians charm over the garden site (with this spell), they order the bush-pigs away, and these go to Tepila [The home of the pigs]' (i966a: II7). Discussing another spell, Malinowski brings out again the Trobrianders' belief that bush-pigs can hear the spell and respond to it: 'Its object is to frighten away the bush-pigs. The towosi [garden magician] showed some reluctance to give me this magic because if the bush-pigs heard it they would go into the garden'(i966b: 329). A further excellent example involving spiritual agents whose conscious aspect might remain unnoticed by a modern observer concerns taytu. To the Trobrianders taytu is not simply a plant, it is capable of hearing magical words: '(i) We plant taytu, already it lies (in the ground). (ii) Later on, it hears magic above; already it sprouts. (iii) We go to the garden, we walk round, we recite magic-(we charm over) all the garden. . .' (i966a: I4I). It is also capable of conscious response and excitement. Writing about a taytu spell with a quotation from the Trobrianders, Malinowski says: It is very interesting that in the main part of the spell the magician invoked only the weaker kinds of taytu, those which are slow sprouting, affected by disease, and so on. As I was told by one of my informants: 'The bad taytu hears the magic, the good taytu hears it also; the good taytu knows that the bad one will grow with the magic, it grows more quickly so as</page><page sequence="6">PRIMITIVE MAGIC AND MANA I87 not to be ashamed.' Thus the competitive principle enters not only into human activities in the Trobriands, but is carried right down into the soil among the crops (I966a: I42). The formula is based on the belief that the plants can listen and hear the magic, that they are affected by the words and this belief is remarkably well and simply documented in the text (I966b: 28I). There is a taytu spell in which some varieties of taytu are mentioned: I Break forth, 0 taytu, in daytime. Break forth, 0 taytu, at night ... II 0 nakoya taytu, breaking forth again and again. O sakaya taytu, breaking forth again and again. O nabugwa taytu, breaking forth again and again . . (I966a: I49-50). Once again, Malinowski makes a similar remark: The varieties of taytu here enumerated, nakoya, sakaya, etc., are all good and palatable, but very hard-growing tubers. Here again my informants, asked why the garden magician only mentions those varieties which grow with difficulty, gave me the answer: 'later on when the lupilakum (the best and most easily growing taytu) hear that the garden magician appeals to the wild (not really domesticated, hence difficult of growth) kinds; later on they rush ahead, the lupilakum, and they leave the other kinds behind ... (I966a: i5o). But taytu is not the only agent, or the embodiment of an agent, with which the magician intends to communicate and which appears to be merely a physical object. In the course of planting a garden for instance, the magician utters a spell over a tuber of a yam called Kwanada: Blaze up, flare up towards the village! Spread fast, move fast towards the bush! (I966a:II4). Malinowski comments on this spell: 'The spell is obviously an exhortation to the vegetables to grow and spread on both sides of the garden' (I966a: ii4); and else- where: 'It is addressed directly to the Kwanada and the imperative might be taken as literally a communication from the magician to the yam tuber as representative of the crops in the garden' (I966b: 272). Zande magic As far as the relation between primitive magic and conscious agents is concerned, the ethnographic observations on Zande magic are far more illuminating than those on Trobriand magic, particularly because they shed considerable light on 'medi- cines' the conscious aspect of which is so difficult to understand. Medicines form the dominant element in Zande magic and usually comprise vegetable ingredients such as bulbs, arboreal parasites and creepers. As the following account attempts to show, the Azande seem to believe that medicines are able, firstly, to understand the spell, and secondly, to respond to it, that is, to carry out what the magician asks them to do in his spell. ' . . . The magician addresses (sima) the medicines and tells them what he wants them to do. These spells are never formulae. The magician chooses his words as he utters the spell ... All that is required is that the meaning shall be clear because the medicines have a commission to carry out and they must know exactly what the commission is' (Evans-Pritchard I937: 450-I)-</page><page sequence="7">i88 H. PHILSOOPH Zande blood-brotherhood pacts entail a ceremony in which the two men concerned swallow each other's blood, and the blood is addressed by the spell. The ceremony has 'the configuration of a typical magical rite'. The spell starts with 'You are blood, which we exchange ...' and is 'typical of Zande spells'. And, what is more, the blood is regarded as a magical substance which 'corres- ponds' to the vegetable medicines under consideration (Evans-Pritchard I962: I38-44). Consequently, the blood is believed to have the same quality as medicines, namely, the ability to understand and respond to the spell: 'Azande say that the blood goes down into the stomach of a man and from there sees all that he does, and when a man betrays his blood-brother it avenges itself on him. The blood knows exactly what is required of the blood-brother because it has heard the address made to it wlhen it was swallowed' (I962: I46). The Zande term 'sima' is used not only for spell but also for prayer. Evans- Pritchard defines the term as 'An address accompanying rites and formiing an integral part of them. When the address is made to medicines I call it a spell ... An address to the ghosts or to the Supreme Being I call a prayer' (I937: Io). As an example of Zande spells we can cite that employed with the medicine (gbau) which can make a man invisible when he goes to seek vengeance upon a person in a blood feud. The man 'addresses' this medicine as follows: 'You are gbau. When I stalk that man who has brought my vengeance on him may he not see me. Even when I approach and stand close by his hut may he not see me. When I blow my gbau "fia" and approach him may he not look far. May my gbau seize him and may I hurl my spear at him to exact vengeance for the wrong he has done me. May he not know on what day I am coming to spear him ... (I936: 407). The responses of medicines to incantations are often very ingenious. The medicine of vengeance (bagbuduma) 'is regarded as a judge which seeks out the person who is responsible for the death, and as an executioner which slays him. Azande say of it that "it decides cases" and that it "settles cases as judiciously as princes". Like all good magic, it acts impartially and according to the merits of the case' (1937: 388-9). The medicine of thunder (ngua gumba), which is resorted to when valuable articles such as spears are stolen, distinguishes between the guilty and the innocent very carefully. 'No other than the guilty need fear the roar of thunder any more than an innocent man need fear the inquisition of a human tribunal'. Moreover, 'Should the spears have been hidden by the thief in the roof of an innocent man's hut it may cause him alarm since the magic, hard on the tracks of its victim, causes thunder to crash and roar on the threshold but it will not kill him' (1937: 390-I). There is a medicine (amatangi) which is sometimes used for preventing theft. The owners of the medicine believe that it is so careful in differentiating the thief from others that 'if a man comes to take something from its owner's homestead having first asked pernmission no harm will come to him' (1937: 4I8). The responses of the above medicines are, at least in their owner's view, moral. There are some medicines which are 'stupid' and act without moral purpose. The Azande say that a medicine either 'judges equitably' or is 'evil medicine'. But even the responses of 'stupid' and 'evil' medicines could be ingenious. There is a medicine (menzere) which frightens the Azande more than any other bad medicine.</page><page sequence="8">PRIMITIVE MAGIC AND MANA 189 The medicine is placed near a hut the owner of which is intended to be killed. Many people may walk over the medicine but, as the Azande say, it will kill a man 'only if it is the man whose name has been given to the medicine in the spell' (I937: 393). In addition to (or because of?) being capable of some understanding and res- ponding, medicines have 'souls'. The word (mbisimo) used for the 'souls' of medicines is the same word employed for the 'soul' of witchcraft-substance. The 'soul' appears to play a similar part in witchcraft and magic. In witchcraft, it is the 'soul' or the psychic part of witchcraft-substance which leaves the witch's body in order to bewitch a person: 'What Azande call mbisimo mangu, the soul of witch- craft, is a concept that bridges over the distance between the person of the witch and the person of the victim. Some such explanation is necessary to account for the fact that a witch was in his hut at the time when he is supposed to have injured someone' (I937: 33). Likewise in niagic 'Medicines act by means of their soul, an explanation which covers the void between a magical rite and the achievement of its purpose' (1937: 36). For example, 'A man makes vengeance magic and it kills a witch. What is happening between these two events? Azande say that the mbisimo ngiaa, "the soul of the medicine", has gone out to seek its victim' (1937: 463). The cooking of a medicine causes its 'soul' to take the form of steam and smoke. 'The virtue of a medicine is sometimes spoken of as its soul, and is believed to rise in steam and smoke when it is being cooked. Therefore people place their faces in the steam so that the magical virtue may enter into them. Likewise, Azande say that when they cook vengeance-medicines the soul of the medicine goes up in the smoke from the fire and from on high surveys the neighbourhood for the witch it goes forth to seek . . .' (I937: 465). One of the occasions on which the face may be immersed in the steam of the 'soul' is the gathering of witch-doctors. While some medicines are being cooked, each witch-doctor 'puts his face in the steam, taking care to keep his eyes open meanwhile so that it enters into them' (I937: 210). We have briefly examined evidence in support of the hypothesis that to the Azande medicines, or fetishes, are conscious, a hypothesis which seems to be generally in accord with the more recent studies of Evans-Pritchard (1956: 100-3) and of Lienhardt (I96I: 64-8). We may now make a few remarks on the way in which Evans-Pritchard looks upon Zande medicines. One of the reasons why Evans-Pritchard is not inclined to regard medicines as personal or conscious appears to be that he strongly opposes Tylor's evolutionary and intellectualist theory of animism and does not wish Zande magical beliefs to be considered as animistic beliefs. In his book, Witchcraft, oracles and magic among the Azande (1937), if he had not stressed that medicines are not personified, his readers could have thought, at least in the 30's, that Zande magic is animistic. In his foreword to the book, referring to the Zande poison oracle whose magical qualities are similar to those of medicines, Seligman observes that at first sight: 'The obvious suggestion is that the oracle is animistic, a personal agency, hearing and answering the questions put to it, an example of sheer animistic belief . . .' (1937: xviii). And speaking of the way in which the Azande behave towards the oracle, he says that on the face of it: ' Here, again, belhaviour is upon an animistic pattern . .' (1937: xxi).</page><page sequence="9">I90 H. PHILSOOPH This article is not, needless to say, concerned with Tylor's intellectualist evolu- tionism. It is true that if animism is taken simply in the sense of 'belief in spiritual beings' this article not only supports this conception, but also seeks to extend it into the domain of primitive magic. But, firstly, Tylor's interest in, and under- standing of, 'spiritual beings ' are not quite the same as those ofthis article. Secondly, in the last two decades an increasing number of scholars, including Evans-Pritchard, have tended to attach considerable importance to the belief in spiritual beings (Evans-Pritchard I956; Firth i959; Horton I96I; Goody I96I; Lawrence &amp; Meggitt I965; Spiro I966). Another reason why Evans-Pritchard declines to regard medicines as personal is that the Azande classify them as 'things' and not as personal beings. In the Azande's view, a person (boro) has limbs and is able to breathe, whereas a medicine has no hands or feet, and cannot take air into its body or exhale it. It would appear that the hypothesis suggested here does not contradict the Azande, because the term 'personal' is used in a different sense in this article. As the ethnographic data cited serve to show, the Azande seem to believe that medicines are, in the sense used here, personal. The Azande use even the same word (mbisimo) for the 'soul' of a medicine as they do for the soul or one of the souls of a human being. The fact that they put medicines in the class of' things' does not seem to create a prob- lem, since it would be questionable to suppose that men everywhere classify phenomena by the same criteria and for the same purposes. Embodiment in a human form is not assumed here to be essential to personal agents, as many agents are either bound to an object which does not look like a person or are not solely bound to one object. Nor is it necessary that the agents be visualised in a human form, as many agents remain supra-sensible: 'Nuer do not claim to see God [Kwoth], nor do they think that anyone can know what he is like in himself' (Evans-Pritchard I956: I23). Consequently, this visualisation is some- times only intellectualistic, if not impossible. As will be especially clear to the reader of Nuer and Dinka studies, as far as the relation between the agents and physical phenomena is concerned, the basic role of the agents is not to be or to resemble these phenomena, whether in the form of the human body or not, but to explain and give meaning to them. As Lienhardt (I96I: I48) puts it, 'Thus even for the Dinka themselves, a Power [spirit] is not an immediate datum of experience of the same order as the physical facts or events with which it is associated. To refer to the activity of a Power is to offer an inter- pretation, and not merely a description, of experience .. '.6 Although medicines are classified as things, one of Evans-Pritchard's achieve- ments lies in showing that medicines differ from ordinary things in possessing 'mystical power'. His definition of medicines is as follows: 'Medicines: any object in which mystical power is supposed to reside and which is used in magical rites. They are usually of vegetable nature' (1937: 9). And what is more, it could be argued that what he calls the mystical power of a medicine corresponds to what is here named the conscious aspect of a medicine. Unlike many writers, he employs the term 'mystical' quite explicitly: 'Mystical Notions. These are patterns of thought that attribute to phenomena supra-sensible qualities which, or part of which, are not derived from observation or cannot be logically inferred from it, and which they do not possess' (1937: 12).</page><page sequence="10">PRIMITIVE MAGIC AND MANA I9I Thus medicines possess mystical power in the sense that they are supposed to have the 'supra-sensible qualities' referred to in this definition. It seems that these qualities can only be those which form the conscious aspect of medicines, namely, the 'soul' or the ability to understand and to respond. Is it not true that the 'soul' is supra-sensible and is described as 'an inherent power which is mysterious not only for us but also for them' (1937: 82)? Is it not true that the ability in question has no observable basis or mechanism? And is it not also the case that medicines do not possess any other quality which can be regarded as supra-sensible? The concept of magical virtue It is impossible to establish the relation between primitive magic and conscious agents without considering magical virtue and mana, two concepts which also deserve to be studied in their own right. In the following consideration of these concepts it will become clear, among other things, that the denial of the relation in question appears to lead to the mystification of primitive magic and is ethno- graphically untenable. One of the elements of primitive magic which particularly discloses this is the spell. If the spell is not intended to be understood by the agents, then for what purpose is it recited, and how is it supposed to affect the agents? Note that here we are dealing with the actor's standpoint, and not that of the observer. As far as the question of the spell is concerned, Frazer, following Tylor, simply overlooks it altogether. The spell has no place in his theory of magic; he cannot explain the spell in terms of the association of ideas. In his copious works he devotes hundreds of pages to describing rites, whereas spells are cited very rarely and are usually assigned a superfluous role. In contrast, Malinowski does not ignore the spell; indeed credit is due to him for being the first to demonstrate its significance. But, in his view, the spell is not intended to be a means of communication with the agents. He holds that, for the actor, the spell is in itself powerful and its power is 'transferred' or 'conveyed' to the object concerned directly or through a material medium. He calls the power of the spell 'magical virtue', 'magical force', and the like. Malinowski's thesis has a theoretical and an ethnographic basis. The theoretical basis consists in his notion that the belief in the creative power of words is not peculiar to magic. It manifests itself in childhood in every society. The child expresses its need for food, toys and other things, and its parents provide them for him. Thus the child gradually feels that the mere mention of a thing can create that particular thing. In adulthood, this attitude towards words is not abandoned. It manifests itself in the spell, in advertisement, political oratory and so forth. That in many situations words could be highly important is no doubt true. But the crucial question is whether this importance is intrinsic or instrumental, that is, whether words are important in themselves or as a means of communication. The above-mentioned instances suggest that the importance in question is instru- mental. The child's speech has no power of its own, it is effective only because the child's parents understand it and respond to it. Political oratory is not delivered in a vacuum, it is addressed to people. Advertisement would be of no avail if nobody took notice of it. The power attributed to the spell is not, therefore, explicable with the aid of these examples. In the case of these instances, the power of words is</page><page sequence="11">192 H. PHILSOOPH instrumental and intelligible, whereas in Malinowski's conception of the spell it is intrinsic and mysterious. It should be noted that not only the magician's communication with the agents but also any other communicative process may become mystical if we deny that it is such a process. If we deny that when a man asks another man to do something and if the latter does so, the hearer's response is presupposed by his understanding of the speaker's request, we may be led to assume that the words spoken have an intrinsic and mysterious power which forces the hearer to act in a certain way. The ethnographic basis of Malinowski's thesis is his Trobriand data. He makes clear in detail that, to the Trobrianders, the spell is very important. He writes, for instance, that the spell is the only element in magic which is kept secret, exchanged and inherited. Magical rites and substances are rather simple and sometimes absent, while the spell is essential to magical practice, has a fixed formula and is associated with mythology and ancestral figures. And 'The question "where is the real strength of magic?" would receive the reply: "in the spell"' (I964: 404). It is undoubtedly true that for the Trobrianders the spell is important, but it is questionable whether this importance is believed to be intrinsic. To say that verbal expression is a major element in oratory is one thing, and to say that this element is in itself powerful is another. It would appear that Malinowski does not give any convincing evidence for his thesis, and is indeed projecting the thesis on to the actors. For example, the Trobriander's statement that the real strength of magic is in the spell is too short and general to throw light on the question whether the strength of the spell is, for the actor, intrinsic or not. Furthermore, as we have already seen, there are many statements uttered by the Trobrianders and many remarks made by Malinowski himself which seem to demonstrate that Trobriand magic is related to the idea of conscious agents, and that spells are a means of communication with them.7 Even if Malinowski's thesis held true for the Trobriand Islanders it would not have been applicable to many societies in which no special importance is attached to the spell. Evans-Pritchard observes that among the Azande, 'The magician chooses his words as he utters the spell. There is no power in the address itself' (I937: 450). 'Indeed, the qualities of the spell in Zande magic are the direct opposite of those which we have been told characterise Trobriand magic. It is a saying rather than a formula, it is familiar, it is handed over without strict reference to genealogical ties, the knowledge of it is not confined to the practitioner' (I929: 623). The concept of mana In I89I, Codrington published his famous book The Melanesians in which he attempted to show that the Melanesians believe in an impersonal supernatural 'power' called mana. Other ethnographers reported similar beliefs among other peoples such as the belief in wakan among the Sioux (Dorsey I894; McGee I897; Fletcher I9I I), in orenda among the Iroquois (Hewitt I902), and in manito among the Algonquin (Jones I905). These ethnographic data led an increasing number of scholars to argue that the study of primitive magic, if not primitive religion, can be illuminated by the notion of supernatural power, a power which is in itself impersonal and came to be known as 'mana'. It was also argued by many scholars that the belief in supernatural power is chronologically and/or logically prior to</page><page sequence="12">PRIMITIVE MAGIC AND MANA I93 that in conscious agents. Hence the term pre-animism, coined by Marett who expressed the concepts of mana and pre-animism in an elaborate form in his book The threshold of religion (I909). In the first quarter of this century the concept of mana was highly influential and provided a foundation for many theories regarding magico-religious beliefs, such as those of Marett and Durkheim. Since then (roughly speaking), its influence has diminished to some extent, but this fact shows not so much that the degree of its acceptability has declined as that anthropological interest in it-and in magic in general-has diminished. As a glance at the existing literature would show, the concept of mana is still generally accepted although British anthropology has usually rejected it since the first quarter of this century (Malinowski i925; Evans- Pritchard I929; I965; Firth I967). Elsewhere it is still regarded as one of the 'dis- coveries' of anthropology and, as will be noted, is still a subject of theoretical interest to anthropologists like Levi-Strauss. It has also had a considerable impact on other scientific disciplines (e.g. Wagenvoort I947; Rose I949; I951; Jung I960; Cassirer I965). In criticising the concept of mana, it should be acknowledged that, at the time of its emergence, this concept had some positive influence on anthropology. Suffice it here to say that as far as primitive magic is concerned, firstly, the view that magic deals with supernatural power is a step forward from Tylor's and Frazer's view of magic, and secondly, unlike Tylor and Frazer, the advocates of the concept of mana-or rather most of them-hold that, to the actor, magic is supernatural. In Tylor's view, magic is neither concerned with conscious agents nor with super- natural power; it is simply a misapplication of the laws of the association of ideas.8 Frazer goes somewhat further and says that because magic does not involve agents it therefore implicitly assumes that phenomena are determined by impersonal powers. But with regard to the idea of impersonal powers there are two differences between Frazer and the advocates of the concept of mana. In the first place, this idea does not play a major part in Frazer's analysis and description of magic, while it is a central idea to those who uphold the concept of mana. Most of the latter emphasize the belief in mana as much as Tylor does the belief in 'spiritual beings '. In the second place, Frazer's impersonal powers are not supernatural, while to most of those who maintain the concept of mana the latter is a supernatural or sacred power. In the third or last edition of The golden bough, Frazer makes a modification in his theory of magic (I9II: 542 I74-5). He writes that magic has not only a 'logical basis' but also a 'physical basis', the former being furnished by the association of ideas and the latter by a sort of ether through which magical impressions are trans- mitted from one distant object to another. By 'ether' he seems to wish to convey the idea of mana. As will be seen, the resemblance between mana and ether was already pointed out by the proponents of the concept of mana, and Frazer makes explicit in a footnote that what Marett means by mana is to him the 'physical basis' of magic (I9II: iii). This modification is not however fundamental. It does not affect Frazer's actual treatment of magic and is chiefly a result of the influence of those who advocated the importance of the concept of mana. On the whole, however, the concept of mana is mystifying and this can be seen first of all in its relation with the spell. It cannot explain the role of the spell in 2-M.</page><page sequence="13">194 H. PHILSOOPH primitive magic. It cannot be said that the spell is addressed to mana, as an imper- sonal power is not capable of understanding. Consequently, the advocates of the concept of mana tend either to ignore the spell or contend directly or indirectly that, for the actor, the spell is efficacious, not because it is addressed to a conscious agent, but because it itself possesses mana. But this contention does not solve the problem as there are many peoples who do not ascribe any supernatural significance to the spell. Mana and magical virtue are fundamentally similar to each other. Both are impersonal powers, both reside in the spell, and both serve to deny the relation between the spell and any conscious agents which could be inferred. It is worthy of note that, in his later writings, Malinowski himself uses the terms magical virtue and mana interchangeably (i966b: 68, I45, 2I5, 240-I). There are, however, some differences between the two. Magical virtue basically resides only in the spell, whereas mana can be attached to almost anything, especially the magical object and the magical rite, and to any person, especially the magician, and as a result it can be used to envelop every element of primitive magic in mystery. Magical virtue is not supernatural whereas mana is. It is true that Malinowski tends to place magic in the supernatural domain, but in his actual discussion of magical virtue he is not concerned with something supernatural: what the verbal expressions used in magic, oratory and advertisement have in common is not supernatural. Finally magical virtue is intrinsic to the spell, whereas mana is independent of the agents. Malinowski is interested in the spell and its power; the impersonal nature of this power and its relation with animism do not engage much of his attention. But the advocates of the concept of mana do not pay sufficient heed to the spell; their basic interest lies in criticising animism and in showing that mana is not derived from the agents and cannot be explained in terms of them. In the analysis of magical virtue, I have tried to show not that the spell cannot be powerful, but that the power of the spell is instrumental rather than intrinsic. Likewise, in the examination of mana, I intend to show, first of all, not that magic has nothing to do with mana, or supernatural power, but that mana is derivative rather than independent. There is no doubt that, as will be seen presently, mana is believed to exist; what is questionable is that it is believed to exist independently. In other words, what is objectionable is that supernatural power is not derived from supernatural agents or, if it is preferred, spiritual power from spiritual beings. Spells, magical objects, magical rites and magicians can have mana because they are closely associated with the agents. They are means of communication and interaction between men and the agents, and may also be related to the agents in other ways, such as temporally, spatially and mythically. Moreovqr, they, or rather some of them, may be means by which the agents manifest, exercise or delegate their power. What is true of magical phenomena is also true of other animate and inanimate phenomena which are charged with mana but are within the sphere of primitive religion. They are either closely associated with the mystical agents or are the means by which such agents manifest, exercise and delegate their power. It should be made clear here that the analysis of Zande medicines was not intended to imply that in all primitive societies magical medicines are always believed to be consciously active. There are many magical medicines which are believed not to be conscious but to have only supernatural power or value. The</page><page sequence="14">PRIMITIVE MAGIC AND MANA I95 substances, bundles and other things which have been traditionally regarded as magical medicines in anthropology are sometimes the embodiments of the agents and sometimes the means of communication and interaction with the agents. Also medicines have sometimes been considered to be magical in the sense that their supposed attributes are false and untenable by modern scientific standards. But this sense is unduly loose because any scientific idea can be called magical when it is proved to be wrong and methodologically untenable. In his classical analysis of mana among the Tikopia, Firth attaches very little theoretical significance to the question whether mana is dependent on the agents or not (I967: I78). However, he elucidates ethnographically that to the Tikopia ' the only real source of manu [or mana] is in the spirit world' (I967: I89). He writes, for instance: Pa Fenuatara, eldest son of the Ariki Kafika, explained manu as follows: 'In this land manu is there in the lips of the chief. In his speech whatever he may ask for, if a chief is manu then when he asks for fish, they will come; when he speaks requesting a calm it falls. That is a mana chief. . .' I asked if mana lay simply in the chief as a man. My question made him laugh. He replied: 'No, friend. His manu is given hither by the spirits . . .' I asked also if mana lay simply in the words recited. He replied: 'There is no manu in speech, it is simply asking . . .' (I967: I83). But Tikopia is not the only instance in which the derivation of mana from the agents is ethnographically established. For example, speaking of Guadalcanal, in the Solomon Islands, Hogbin writes: The natives hold that these [spirits] are all possessed of power which they can use for the benefit of human beings. This power is given a special name, nanama. It is an attribute of all spirits, like their ability to remain invisible and to move about from place to place with extreme speed, and has no ultimate source (1936: 244). It may be surprising to add that a careful study of Codrington's book The Melanesians, which is supposed to be the original ethnographical foundation of the concept of mana, also leaves no doubt about the derivation of mana. Suffice it here to quote the following statements: This Mana is not fixed in anything, and can be conveyed in almost anything; but spirits, whether disembodied souls or supernatural beings, have it and can impart it; and it essentially belongs to personal beings to originate it though it may act through the medium of water, or a stone, or a bone (I89I: iign). If a stone is found to have a supernatural power, it is because a spirit has associated itself with it; a dead man's bone has with it mana, because the ghost is with the bone; a man may have so close a connexion with a spirit or ghost that he has mana in himself also ... (I89I: II9-20). The advocates of the concept of mana at times acknowledge that in some cases mana depends on the agents; indeed this dependence is sometimes so conspicuous ethnographically that it can hardly be overlooked. They, however, stress that there are also cases in which mana is independent. There are of course some ethnographic studies on the basis of which the dependence of mana cannot be definitely shown, but the reason is that in these studies the relation between mana and the agents is not sufficiently documented. Yet often even in this type of study evidence for the dependence in question is not entirely lacking. For instance, Hewitt, whose ethno- graphic work on the Iroquoian belief in orenda is a well-known basis of the concept of mana, observes:</page><page sequence="15">I96 H. PHILSOOPH The savage man conceived the diverse bodies collectively constituting his environment to possess inherently mystic potence [such as orenda], and to be living, thinking, willing, passionful beings ... (I902: 33). The one requisite credential to this pantheon was the possession of orenda. And the story of the operations of orenda becomes the history of the gods (I902: 4I). Thus it came that the possession of orenda or magic power is the distinctive characteristic of all the gods, and these gods in earlier time were all the bodies and beings of nature in any manner affecting the weal or woe of man (I9I0: 147-8, my emphasis). One could in fact argue that wherever the actor's ideas on mana and particularly on the relation between it and the agents are sufficiently recorded, the derivative nature of mana is consciously or unconsciously established by the observer. It is thus no accident that Firth, Hogbin and Codrington lend support to this idea of derivation: their studies on mana are the most intensive ethnographic works on this subject. Firth's work is undoubtedly an ethnographic masterpiece, besides being a major theoretical contribution. But it should be noted that there are also many other works which confirm this idea. For instance, we are told that among the Fijians: 'So rooted is the tendency to look for a spirit behind mana that natives who want to be orthodox Christians, and yet believe in the mana of a thing, ascribe that mana to God' (Hocart 19I4: 99). In the island of Mala in the Solomons 'The words [mamana and mamanaa] have a direct reference to the power of ghosts: everything that is mamana [my italics] is so because of its connexion with ghosts who empower it. There is no idea of a thing being magically powerful in itself Always the power of the ghosts is predicted' (Ivens I930: 137). Among the White Mountain Apache 'Back of all supernatural power is In Charge of Life [the supreme deity], its original source' (Goodwin 1938: 28). Since the question whether mana is independent or not is a major issue, we may also consider two other weighty reasons cited in support of the supposed inde- pendence of mana: a. It is said that sometimes the belief in mana overshadows that in the agents. Because that is so it does not of course follow that mana is independent of the agents. Granting that mana emanates from the agents, we could say that the im- portance ascribed to the former points to the importance ascribed to the latter. Furthermore, it seems to be the observer rather than the actor who over-emphasises the belief in mana. For instance, Codrington tends to exaggerate the significance of mana in such a way that some of his statements have proved to be somewhat misleading, especially when they have been taken out of context. He starts his discussion of the Melanesian magico-religious beliefs and practices by describing the idea of mana, not that of the agents, and says: 'The Melanesian mind is entirely possessed by the belief in a supernatural power or influence, called almost uni- versally mana' (i89I: II8). How can the Melanesian mind be 'entirely' occupied by the idea of mana while it is also, as his remarkable book makes abundantly clear, greatly interested in the idea of the agents? He observes that: 'Without some under- standing of this [mana] it is impossible to understand the religious beliefs and practices of the Melanesians; and this again is the active force in all they do and believe to be done in magic, white or black' (I89I: I9I). This is half the truth, the other half being that without some understanding of the agents it is also impossible to understand Melanesian religion, magic and mana itself He remarks: 'All Melanesian religion consists, in fact, in getting this Mana for oneself, or getting it used for one's benefit-all religion, that is, as far as religious practices go, prayers</page><page sequence="16">PRIMITIVE MAGIC AND MANA I97 and sacrifices' (I89I: iign). This is another way of saying that in a practical sense, Melanesian religion consists in man's attempt to persuade conscious agents to exercise their supernatural power, or to bestow some of it upon man, for his benefit; a statement which is applicable to every religion studied by anthropologists. But Codrington's remark, or rather the remark taken out of its context, gives the impression that Melanesian religion differs from other religions and has nothing to do with the belief in the agents. b. It is said that, for the actor, the distinction between the personal and im- personal aspects of the supernatural is vague. One cannot but conclude, however, that this distinction is so vital to the actor that he cannot afford to be vague about it. He makes frequent contacts with the supernatural for a variety of necessary purposes; he is therefore bound to decide whether he is contacting something personal or impersonal, that is, something capable of feeling, understanding and purposeful action or not. This is not a scholastic question, but a question whose answer determines to a great extent the manner in which he comes into contact with the supernatural. Personal agents and mana cannot be treated in the same way. The Melanesians studied by Codrington and the Tikopians never 'pray' to mana, but to the agentsfor mana. The Azande invoke magical medicines and expect them to make careful judgements only because they have arrived at the conclusion that magical medicines are personal, It may be objected that if the actor's distinction in question were not vague he would not have gone so far as to think that, say, Zande medicines are personal. But to have a wrong idea is one thing, and to have a vague idea is another, here the matter at issue is vagueness not wrongness. Also, as Evans-Pritchard demon- strates in the case of the Azande, the actor's view of the medicines makes sense in terms of the actor's world-view and limited cultural heritage. The real problem is not that the actor does not distinguish between the personal and the impersonal in the supernatural realm, but that anthropological observers have not so far examined the concept of personal or conscious agents sufficiently. We are frequently told that such-and-such an agent is 'vaguely personal' or 'more or less anthropomorphic', but we are never enlightened sufficiently as to what exactly 'personification' or 'anthropomorphic' is supposed to mean. An implicit supposition is that unless an agent has a definite form, and especially a human form, it is vaguely personal or not an agent at all. For instance, taking wakan as an example of supernatural power, Durkheim writes that wakan is not a personal agent because it has not, among other things, a 'determined form': 'The wakan is in no way a personal being; the natives do not represent it in a determined form' (I964: I92). Then he goes on to support a quotation in which another observer takes the term 'personification' to mean visualisation in a human form: 'According to an observer cited by Dorsey, " they say that they have never seen the wakanda, so they cannot pretend to personify it"' (I964: I92). In order to make sure here that the actor does not mean that to him wakan or wakanda is impersonal, I cite the quotation, which is also supported by Dorsey, fully and exactly: 'They say that they have never seen Wakanda, so they cannot pretend to personify Him; but they have often heard Him speak in the thunder. They often wear a shell which is in honour or in representation of Him, but they do not pretend that it resembles Him, or has anything in common with his form, organization, or size' (Dorsey</page><page sequence="17">198 H. PHILSOOPH I894: 372). Owing to the role played by gender in the French language the quota- tion, or rather part of it, given by Durkheim does not contradict him in the French text of his book, although this part is cited faithfully (I9I2: 275). The above supposition was earlier considered with reference to Zande magic, and it was said that as some agents remain supra-sensible the visualisation of them is speculative if not impossible. This is well expressed by the actor when he says that because he has never seen wakanda he cannot pretend to visualise it in a human form. The supposition is in fact a reflection of a general tendency on the part of the observer to conceive the agents too readily in terms of physical phenomena. To say that the agents must have distinct shapes is to assume that a physical or bodily aspect is indispensable to them. Another significant reflection of this tendency is the view that to the actor even the agents' power, namely, mana is, or is very similar to something physical. This view is another source of the mystification of mana, besides the idea of the inde- pendence of mana. It is also very wide-spread: Mana is 'a sort of ether, imponder- able, communicable, which spreads of itself' (Mauss &amp; Hubert I96I: I089). 'What we find at the origin and basis of religious thought are ... indefinite powers, anonymous forces ... whose impersonality is strictly comparable to that of the physical forces whose manifestations the sciences of nature study' (Durkheim I964: 200). 'Waken might be compared with a fluid which courses through all existing things . . .' (Levy-Bruhl I926: I33). 'Conceived as somewhat in the nature of a transferable fluid, it [mana] could be conducted into weapons by placing them in temples . . .' (Lowie I948: 76). Mana is also said to be many other things, such as the first form of physical force, an invisible substance, a universal energy and com- parable to electricity and influenza. 'Mana thus,' says Marett, 'implies a religious experience that is primarily of the perceptual order, a frame of mind in which the sacred is simply "sensed"' (I929: 77I). But is there any convincing evidence for this view? Codrington states explicitly that mana is not physical: 'There is a belief in a force altogether distinct from physical force. . .', and 'It is a power or influence, not physical, and in a way super- natural . . .' (i89I: ii8-i9n). His statement that 'it is present in the atmosphere of life' could, if one reads too much into it, give the impression that mana is something like a pervasive ether or energy. But this statement is neither substantiated nor clarified. Hogbin, who has re-studied mana in Melanesia, and who admires and generally confirms Codrington's findings, says: ' . . . I would hesitate to subscribe to the statement that mana is "present in the atmosphere of life" because I do not know what it means' (I936: 267). Besides, Codrington's remark that mana 'shews itself in physical force' and Firth's comment that the 'presence' of mana is 'judged by material tokens' do not create a problem here. Firstly, they do not indicate that mana is physical in itself, secondly, mana is not associated only with physical phenomena: 'it shews itself in physical force, or in any kind of power or excellence which a man possesses' (Codrington I89I: II9). That this view is not the actor's but is projected onto him by the observer is clearly admitted in the following passage referring to some Bolivian tribes: 'These tribes had a ritual apparently based on the belief that an invisible magic substance floats in the air and permeates certain sacred objects, such as altars and rattles. This belief was not stated by the Indians, but was inferred from the motions</page><page sequence="18">PRIMITIVE MAGIC AND MANA I99 made by shamans and other people during religious ceremonies ...' (Metraux I942: Iso). There are a number of factors which invest this view with a certain plausibility. One of them is that conscious agents, which may have, or take quasi-ethereal and other physical forms, have sometimes been mistaken for mana. A case in point is wakanda, or rather this term in one of its senses, which was discussed earlier. Speaking of some of the contexts in which the terms wakanda and manito are used, Radin writes: I was fortunate enough to work among the Winnebago and Ojibwa, where the belief in wakanda and manito is strongly and characteristically developed. In both tribes the term always referred to definite spirits, not necessarily definite in shape. If at a vaporbath the steam is regarded as wakanda or manito, it is because it is a spirit transformed into steam for the time being; if an arrow is possessed of specific virtues, it is because a spirit has either transformed himself into the arrow or because he is temporarily dwelling in it ... (I9I4: 349). Another factor of which we are frequently reminded is that mana is contagious; it spreads from one object or person to another object or person, especially by physical contact. But because this is so, it does not follow that mana is in itself physical. Political power is, like mana, contagious. Like mana, it is transmissible through persons. The people who are closely related with a powerful statesman, such as his friends and relatives, may enjoy some power, even if he has not officially delegated any authority to them. Like mana, it is communicable through objects. The things closely associated with a monarch, such as his crown, his palace and his statues, usually have political significance. Like mana, it disseminates through action. The activities in which a political head takes part or which are directly concerned with him, such as ceremonies and formal or informal gatherings, could confer prestige or be politically important. Like mana, it spreads through bodily contact. This is one of the reasons why so many people wish to touch, to shake hands or be photographed with a political leader. Like mana, it may be attached to almost anything. Any animate or inanimate object can suddenly be invested with political significance. But in spite of all this, political power is not generally con- ceived of as a physical substance floating in the air.9 The analogy between mana and political power can clarify some aspects of the former which are apparently mysterious and quasi-physical. In the following quotation, the term 'electricity' may be easily replaced by the expression 'political power': 'The comparison has frequently been made between mana and electricity. Like electricity, mana is impersonal, and like electricity it can be channelled, directed, and used to achieve a desired end by one who knows how to manipulate it' (Herskovits I966: 356). Still another factor is the linguistic one, of which three examples may be men- tioned here. The first is that some of the actor's statements indicate in the literal sense that mana is something physical. But does the actor take such statements literally? The Tikopians say that mana 'is clenched in the chief's fist'; but there is no evidence to show that they use this expression in its literal sense. It seems, in fact, to be more in accord with the general description of mana in Tikopia to assume that the Tikopians take the expression figuratively. The second example is that some of the actor's actions would point to mana as something physical if they were not understood symbolically. Mana appears to be</page><page sequence="19">200 H. PHILSOOPH handed over as a physical object in the following passage referring to the Tikopians: He [Pa Rangifuri] said: 'The new chief beseeches the chief who has gone for some manu for himself, that he may crawl to the gods and the assemblage of ancestors ... Then the chief who has departed goes, performs his crawling to the god, and stretches out his hand to him. 'Here! Give me some manu that I may go and give it to my next-in-line (successor)'. It is given him by the god, whatever it may be, a bundle of leafage or the fruit of the coconut or a fish, or whatever be the desire of the chief who is beseeching him. Thereupon he comes again to sit in his place. He stretches out his hand to the new chief who is sitting among men (in the world of men). 'Here! There is your manu'. The manu is given hither after the fashion of gods; not a man looks upon it; he observes only the food which has become good, the taro, the yam, the coconut, all food has fruited well indeed (Firth I967: I8o-i). The inference however seems to be that what is handed over here is not mana itself but some objects which, owing to their association with mana, are regarded as tokens of mana. Like political power, since mana is not, as the rest of the data on mnana in Tikopia indicate, concrete, it cannot be handed over except in a symbolic manner. The third example of the linguistic factor is that the different meanings of the term mana are not sufficiently taken into account. Mana is sometimes apparently concrete because it may denote not only what is here named 'supernatural power', but also the things which have this power. In Tikopia it is possible either to say the manu of the rain, or to call the rain itself manu. But the employment of the term mnana in these two senses is not an indication that the actor confuses the abstract and the concrete. In English, political power could also refer to entities which possess it, as in the expression 'The Great Powers', and so on. The mechanistic or reifying tendency in understanding mana survives, as the idea of the independence of mana does, even in some of the most recent and ingenious theories on the concept of mana. Levi-Strauss's theory is based on the assumption that for the actor inana is, among other things, independent and concrete (ig50: xli-lii). Swanson, whose theory presupposes the independence of mana, writes: 'Mana is a substance or essence which gives one the ability to perform tasks or achieve ends otherwise impossible. It increases natural abilities and confers supernatural skills. In itself, however, mana is an object, not a body of skills and abilities which are obtained through learning . . .' (I966: 6). I have undertaken a brief analysis of the concept of mana, an analysis which is particularly indebted to Firth, Hocart, Hogbin and Radin. Before concluding, reference may be made to the translation of the word itself. The expression 'super- natural power' is not, as a translation, entirely satisfactory. It has sometimes a broader meaning than mana. In fact, on occasions, it might be more apt to trans- late mana as 'supernatural value' or 'supernatural quality'. In many contexts it seems to be equivalent or analogous to 'supernatural efficacy', 'holiness', 'sacred- ness', 'blessing', or II The translation of mana is a controversial and complex subject which cannot be discussed here. It may only be hoped that the number of difficulties in translating mana will not be used, as has often been the case, as another excuse for its mystification. The translation of any word from one language into another can create difficulties if one wishes to be precise. Thus, Firth, quoting a philosopher, writes: 'Our own term "power" has a multiple range of meaning, so why should we expect the word mana to have a single precise meaning?' (I964: 403).</page><page sequence="20">PRIMITIVE MAGIC AND MANA 20I In conclusion, it may be said that the advocates of the concept of mana exercised an important influence on anthropology early in this century. They advanced beyond the Frazerian concept of magic in some respects. They showed that, for the actor, primitive magic is supernatural, and stressed many of the difficulties of making a hard and fast distinction between magic and religion. Hence the expression 'magico-religious' suggested by Marett. Moreover, the criticism which the up- holders of the concept of mana made of the Tylorian concept of animism had a positive aspect. It drew attention to the fact that there are many religious, or magico- religious, phenomena which are believed not to be animate (i.e. conscious), but to have only supernatural power. Although it is not simply true, contrary to the prevailing assumption, that Tylor, the great pioneer, was entirely unaware of notions like that of mana (Tylor I958: 229-46), it is true that he did not follow them up. He was interested in the extent to which phenomena are believed to be con- scious or to be the abode of conscious agents rather than in the extent to which phenomena are believed to be under the influence of the agents. Some of the aspects of the agents' influence and power, especially the 'contagious' aspect, did not receive much of his attention, and as a result, his study of conscious agents remained incomplete in a sense. On the whole, however, the advocates of the concept of mana mystified primitive magico-religious beliefs, and this can be seen, among other things, in their treatment of the spell and the contagious aspect of the supernatural. The con- cept of mana, that is, the notion of a supernatural power which is quasi-physical and independent of conscious agents is a reification and a mystification. It is not a discovery of anthropology but an illusion of the observer. Anthropology has made so many genuine contributions to the study of man that it need not take pride in this concept. The theorists of the concept of mana have built on sand because they have not sufficiently observed a fundamental methodological rule according to which the first-stage study of a set of beliefs should consist in a thorough investigation of the actor's own conscious formulation of those beliefs. The belief in mana, or supernatural power, in the sense of a dependent and non- reified power is an ethnographic fact. We cannot however say that, for the actor, the distinction between the personal and impersonal aspects of the supernatural is vague. It is the observer who has not sufficiently clarified his notion of personalisa- tion. Nor can we say, as there has been a tendency to say, especially in recent decades, that primitive magico-religious beliefs have two poles, personal and im- personal. Firstly, supernatural power is not in opposition with the agents but belongs to, emanates from, and is indeed essential to them. The agents can exist, or be believed in, only if there are some phenomena, physical, social, psychological and so forth, which can be interpreted as the manifestations of their power. Secondly, because supernatural power belongs to personal agents, it is misleading to call it impersonal. Thus the world-view of both primitive religion and what is rightly or wrongly regarded as primitive magic is solely and truly personalistic. NOTES I am grateful to DrJ. Littlejohn, Dr M. J.

The first version of this article was read before a seminar at the Department of Social Anthropology,</page><page sequence="21">202 H. PHILSOOPH University of Edinburgh, in March I968. I should like to emphasise that this article is only preliminary to an intensive study of primitive world-view to be published later. I In many cases the magical act is, of course, not only a supposed 'supernatural' or 'spiritual' communication and interaction, but also a social one. The people who take part in the magical act may simultaneously communicate, consciously or unconsciously, ideas and feelings which are socially important to them. There are even cases in which the magical act is purely social communication and interaction. But the social aspect of magic, its complex relations with the supernatural aspect, and the conditions in which one of the aspects, particularly the social one, overshadows the other cannot be discussed here. They require separate consideration. 2 All the Frazerian aspects of the anthropological conception of primitive magic will not be discussed here. 3 Due to lack of space, my ethnographic examinations of Trobriand and Zande magic are shortened here. 4 For the notion of kosi see Malinowski (I96I: gon) in addition to (1948). 5This point is also made elsewhere: 'Names of ancestral spirits are recited in the magical spells; in fact, these invocations are perhaps the most prominent and persistent feature of the magical spells' (Malinowski 1948: 147). 6 For the explanatory aspect of the belief in conscious agents see also some of Horton's valuable articles (e.g. Horton I962). 7 Due to lack of space, my analysis of the ethnographic basis of Malinowski's thesis is parti- cularly shortened here. 8 Sympathetic magic and the relation between primitive magic and the association of ideas are not intended to be examined here. This subject, which requires a separate paper, will be discussed elsewhere. 9 This approach to the 'contagious' aspect of supernatural and political power, which is also applicable to many other cases, relates to Durkheim's concept of the sacred. But this relation cannot be considered here. IO It should be noted that, like mana, the English word 'blessing' denotes not only something abstract but also something concrete: A good fire is a blessing in cold weather. As far as the relation between mana and grace is concerned, it may be recalled that Weber takes mana as an example of charisma (I966: 2), a word which means the 'gift of grace' in Greek.
