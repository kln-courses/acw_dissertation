<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> 456 PHOENIX the Weberian approach, which Ru ̈pke does not entirely avoid, is that Roman religion is too easily reduced to a mere subdivision of politics, marked by festivals, euergetism, laws, banquets for the boys (among the elite), and parades and holidays (for everyone else). To balance Weber, we may need anthropology, in the theories of Victor Turner (liminality, communitas) and Clifford Geertz (the semiotic concept of culture); or perhaps John Searle’s theories of speech act (for the republic before public writing) and its extension to performance act (for the third century and after).3 Religion, minimally, is a way of understanding and interpreting the universe and one’s place in it. The Romans had great confidence in their religion, whether or not they individually believed in augury, anthropomorphism, or specific rituals. The understanding and assumptions that gave rise to that confidence were, precisely, the object of all that elite competition. The study of Roman religion cannot be confined to its pragmatic and political aspects while ignoring religion itself. As compelling as Ru ̈pke’s conclusions can be, they are at times in danger of doing just that. University of Iowa Carin Green Imperial Ideals in the Roman West: Representation, Circulation, Power. By Carlos F. NorenÄa. Cambridge University Press: Cambridge. 2011. Pp. xxi, 456. NorenÄa takes as his central theme the question of how the change in Roman government from republic to monarchy related to the major cultural changes that occurred at about the same time in the Roman empire and especially in the Roman west. Syme argued that the switch to monarchy drove cultural change; more recent work on the subject tends to see the advent of monarchy as a product of broader developments in society. Noren ̃a proposes an alternative to these two viewpoints, one that seeks to explain these simultaneous changes “as the product of a more general convergence of ‘social power’ in the Roman world” (10). Noren ̃a defines “social power” (a term coined by the sociologist Michael Mann) as “control over territories, resources, and persons, and . . . . the manner in which such control is organized, both logistically and symbolically”; this power “is mainly collective and institutional instead of individual, and it is situated not within societies, but rather within sets of overlapping and interconnected networks” (322). The emperor was “the critical ‘node’ ” (323) for these networks and functioned as a “symbolic glue” (324) that replaced the pure force that had held the empire together during the republic. This led to “a measure of ideological unification between the multiple actors who controlled the main power networks of the Roman world” (324) and in turn to a more stable form of government. This concept of the role of the emperor as an ethical and beneficent entity is central to the book. Noren ̃a’s main thesis is that the emperor was systematically depicted as a “moral exemplar,” who “not only reinforced the power of the Roman state . . . but also increased the collective authority of the local aristocracies upon which the empire’s social and political order was based” (1). The core of the book is an attempt to prove this thesis by studying the iconography of the imperial coinage, based on the idea that this material 3For example, V.

Noren ̃a’s focus is on the west because these provinces did not, as in some places in the east, have their own coinage. His chosen chronological range is a.d. 69–235, because not until 69 was the majority of western coinage produced in Rome itself, while after 235 the situation is made more complicated by a proliferation of short-lived emperors. The book is organised in three parts. In Part I, titled “Representation,” Noren ̃a discusses the main values or ideals that are associated with the emperor in art and other media; he presents mainly numismatic data that he believes identify a “system” in the coinage that emphasised particular virtues of the emperor and benefits of empire. In Part II, “Circulation,” he studies how this system was diffused through the empire and how it changed over time. Noren ̃a considers these issues from the standpoint both of central authority and local reception, particularly through examining how the value system identified in the coinage was reflected in local inscriptions. The final part, “Power,” is in effect a short conclusion in which Noren ̃a connects the results of his analysis of the imperial ideological system to the concept of “social power.” Noren ̃a bases his analysis on a sample of about 143,000 silver and 36,000 bronze coins; the data comes mainly from hoards. Just over half the types represented on these coins (55% on the silver, 57% on bronze) are personifications, mostly of virtues; gods and goddesses make up about half the remainder, with objects and imperial family members constituting the rest. Among the personifications, Noren ̃a identifies five “core virtues.” These, although not an “official canon” and not corresponding exactly to imperial virtues stressed by Pliny, Dio, and Suetonius, form a “discrete set of virtues” that is “coherent” and that emphasises “specific contexts, concrete outcomes, and practical applications of these virtues for the community as a whole” (61). The five main virtues are (with percentages of total virtues by coin count): aequitas (“fairness”; 24%), pietas (“piety”; 20%), virtus (“military virtue”; 13%), providentia (“foresight”; 12%), and liberalitas (“generosity”; 12% on silver coinage, 6% on bronze). The frequent use of the adjective augusta or the genitive augusti with these virtue names in the coin legends shows that they were meant to be understood as directly associated with the emperor. In discussing the implications of this data Noren ̃a largely (and deliberately) avoids discussion of concepts of agency, reception/intelligibility of coin types, and propaganda; these are relevant, Noren ̃a writes, but even more important are “the underlying mechanics of coin production and circulation” (191). He argues that it is only by studying “total mint output,” the “mix of new and old coins in that output,” and how coins were put into circulation and subsequently circulated that the function of coins “as a medium of official communications” can be understood. A key basis for Noren ̃a’s arguments is the idea that only 10 to 25 per cent of state payments were made using new coins, which were thus “substantially outnumbered by older coins” (196). This “more or less” rules out “the regular targeting of particular groups, such as soldiers, with specific, topical messages,” and more importantly leads Noren ̃a to conclude that in general circulation the new coins would be even less prominent: “they will have been swallowed up by the ocean of coins circulating at the moment” (196). This leads to the next step in Noren ̃a’s argument, “that only the most common types will have stood out within the immense population of imperial coins circulating at any one time” (197). Noren ̃a then moves on to identify links between the pattern of virtues seen on the coinage and the frequency of the mention of these virtues in inscriptions, usually appear- </page> <page sequence="3"> 458 PHOENIX ing as an epithet in the superlative. Under Trajan providentia makes its first appearance on the imperial coinage and it also appears in an official inscription; under Commodus there is a similar situation with nobilitas (231–232). The high emphasis on pietas in the coinage of Antoninus Pius is reflected by the epithet piisimus used in two inscriptions (from Rome and Ostia) honouring his adopted son Marcus Caesar. Another example involves Macrinus and providentia (234), where the virtue is prominent on Macrinus’ coinage and also appears as an epithet on three milestones (all from Noricum). Under Septimius Severus Noren ̃a identifies both a direct correspondence between felicitas on the coinage (where it accounts for 20% of virtue types) and the appearance of the epithet fe- licissimus in inscriptions, and more general “conceptual” links between military themes in each medium. But the number of inscriptions that illustrate these links with the “canon” of virtues seen on the coinage is very small (one each for the examples of Trajan and Commodus, three for Macrinus). One wonders whether the opposite conclusion could be drawn from this (and from the lack of specific correspondence between numismatic and epigraphic virtues for other rulers): that as a rule there was no close connection between them. Other questions come to mind. Is it valid to argue that the commoner types would have a greater prominence than the rarer in the eye and mind of a user of coinage? Would rarer types perhaps be more striking than common ones (the great majority of which were single-figure types) to a person who paid attention to the designs on his money, simply by virtue of how they stood out from the crowd? Even the commonest of Noren ̃a’s core virtues, aequitas, would have been no more common in general circulation than one coin in any given eight; the three least common core virtues would appear on no more than one in twenty. Noren ̃a (195–196) reconstructs a model for the circulation of Roman coinage that envisions coins passing from the imperial mint to the provinces where it is paid out to soldiers and administrators, then moves from these bodies to the civilian population. But other arrangements are possible, and archaeological evidence suggests that in some parts of the empire the typological makeup of coin circulating in military areas could be different from that in civilian ones.1 This book is a refreshing alternative to the approach traditionally employed by numis- matists and historians when analysing coinage. Noren ̃a brings the commonest types into the foreground and through a meticulous and detailed analysis shows that these images may well have had a much more important function (whether deliberately intended or not) than normally thought in spreading the virtues of the emperor and thereby helping to unify the Roman empire.
