<plain_text><page sequence="1">196 The Cambridge Law Journal [1969] The resulting confusion could have been less—or perhaps merely more sharply defined—if their Lordships had not so often eschewed discussion of precise instances on the pretext that every case is a question of fact. This is of course tme, but the result is a series of abstract propositions, as unhelpful as any statute or code while considerably less terse. There is Iittle use having a final court of appeal responsible for the decision of questions of doctrine, if the results are more delphic than the oracle, who at least had the advantage that her ambiguities were uttered in only one voice. John TUey. pettitt v. PETrrrr: a post-script Even the most cursory reading of Pettitt v. Pettitt will reveal that common law and equity have failed to mould a coherent and flexible body of rules to determine title to, or possession of, matrimonial property. Indeed it may have been constitutionally improper for the courts to have done so; for then they might have encroached, if Lord Reid is to be believed, on the province of the legislature! A matri¬ monial property Bill is inevitable and imminent. It will certainly present its own problems of interpretation, and may attempt to shroud the gently-acrid and confused jurisprudential battles which Mr. Tiley has described in the previous note. Will no one tell me what [they sing]?— Perhaps the plaintive numbers flow For old, unhappy, far-off things, And battles long ago. I doubt, however, if Pettitt will be forgotten. The judgments and speeches sharply illustrate traditional judicial attitudes, techniques and prejudices. For example, English lawyers have for long been suspicious of exercising a discretion (pejoratively described as " palm tree" justice); and only do so if statute requires it of them. In Pettitt, Lord Hodson conjured up Coke's ghost to remind us that discretion is necessarily " uncertain and crooked," and that the " met- wand " of the law is always " golden and straight." The certainty of legal principle must be preserved, particularly if tide to property is in dispute. It was to maintain this certainty, said Lord Upjohn, that equity invented presumptions which represented " what the parties, had they thought about it, would have intended." But not all lawyers, and fewer laymen, would accept that these presumptions are the quintessence of common sense. Lord Diplock (as would Lord Reid) preferred to apply "familiar" common law techniques, which eschewed the law of resulting trusts as well as Lord Denning's</page><page sequence="2">CLJ. Case and Comment 197 discretion to do what is " fair and just in all the circumstances of the case," and invoked in their place an " anthropomorphic conception of justice," in the shape of the ** fair and reasonable man." Unless it is possible to infer from the conduct of the spouses . . . an actual common intention ... the court must impute to them a constructive common intention which is that which in the court's opinion would have been formed by reasonable spouses. Lord Diplock claims that this test is significantly different from Lord Denning's, in that it employs a technique known to the courts (for example, in frustration cases), and ignores events occurring after the time of the relevant transaction. But some may think that Lord Diplock's analysis resurrects the conceptualism of Bullen and Leake and the discredited fiction of the implied contract, and that it is only ex facie different from Lord Denning's. It will be recalled that the Pettitt claim was brought by a spouse, who had " improved " the property of the other, on a summons under section 17—a section which provides an expeditious and summary procedure for determining title to or possession of property. I sympathise with Willmer LJ.'s observation, in the Court of Appeal in Pettitt, that it would be an absurd result to conclude that a spouse who puts up a shelf or touches up a window-sill " has started to acquire a beneficial interest in the property." Indeed, even if the improvements are substantial, to recognise that they create a proprietary interest will create eonsiderable conveyancing difficulties and conflict with the policy, accepted by the legislature and the House of Lords, that transactions in real property should be simplified and facilitated: cf. National Provincial Bank v. Ainsworth [1965] A.C 1175; Caunce v. Caunce [1969] 1 W.L.R. 286. At the same time it must be accepted that there is great force in the contention that the distinction which the courts have drawn between the position of the contributor to the purchase price and the improver of property can produce unfortunate results, and that there may be circumstances where it is just that an improver should be recompensed for his services. Some, but not all, of the difficulties which have been mentioned could have been avoided if the courts had been prepared to recognise, and a convenient procedure had been available to enforce, a quantum meruit claim. In Pettitt, Lord Reid did not think that the doctrine of unjust enrichment was of any help; but his understanding of the scope of that doctrine appears perhaps to have been somewhat limited. There is a line of cases, the foremost of which is the Court of AppeaFs decision in Craven-Ellis v. Cannons Ltd. [1936] 2 K.B. 403, which establishes that a quantum meruit claim will lie for services rendered, even in the absence of contract, if the</page><page sequence="3">198 The Cambridge Law Journal [1969] defendant freely accepted the benefit of the defendant's services, with the actual or presumed knowledge that they were to be paid for: see Goff and Jones, The Lxtw of Restitution, pp. 14-15, 29-31. There is no case where the courts have allowed such a claim where one spouse has improved another's property, and to allow a quantum meruit claim here would admittedly involve an extension of existing authority. But, as Lord Reid said: I do not think that it is a very convincing argument to say that, if a stranger makes improvements on the property of another without any agreement or any request by that other that he should do so, he acquires no right. . . . \Y\i the spouse who owns the property acquiesces in the other making the improvements in circumstances where it is reasonable to suppose that they would have agreed to some right being acquired if they had thought about the legal position I can see nothing contrary to ordinary legal principles in holding that the spouse who makes the improvement has acquired such a right. Whatever test is employed (and Lord Reid's is not dissimilar to that of Lord Diplock), the courts should recognise that they are making a policy decision in these circumstances. Various factors, such as the extent of the improvements, faithful domestic services rendered over the years, and whether the husband improver has lived "rent free," should then be relevant in determining whether any claim, personal {quantum meruit) or proprietary (under s. 17), should be admitted and to rebut the presumption that an improver-spouse of property is presumed to be making a gift of his services to the owner-spouse.

ORGANISING RESISTANCE TO TAKE-OVER BIDS— THE LEGALITY OF STRATEGIC ALLOTMENTS OF SHARES Article 12 of the Articles of Association of Bamford, Ltd. conferred on the directors exclusive control over the allotment of shares. The board of directors, anxious to resist attempts by J. C. Bamford (Excavators) Ltd. to buy the company out, allotted a large proportion of the unissued shares to a company which could be relied on to use the voting power thereby acquired in preventing the take-over. One of Bamford's directors, who had opposed the allotment, issued a writ claiming on behalf of all the members except the other directors (who were named as defendants) a declaration that the allotment was void. The board countered by convening an extraordinary general meeting to consider a resolution moving the ratification of the allotment, whereupon the plaintiff issued a second writ claiming a declaration</page></plain_text>
