Rosenthal1 Introduction In 1664 Ferdinand Bol produced a large painting for the Magistrate's Chambers (schepenkamer) in the Amsterdam Town Hall entitled 'Moses Descends from Mount Sinai with the Ten Commandments'.2 Bol depicts Moses as he is described in Exodus 34:29-30: face shining and eyes wide with awe, descend ing with the tablets of the Law. We can infer that this is Moses' second descent from Sinai from the position of the tablets. The first time Moses descended Sinai with the Law, he was greeted by the sight of the Hebrews dancing around the Golden Calf, the idol they had erected in his absence (Exodus 32:19). Other contemporary artists, among them Rembrandt, depicted Moses at this moment holding the tablets high above his head in anger, ready to smash them in his disgust with the scene. But in Bol's painting, we see Moses holding the tablets in front of his chest, preparing to show a far more reverent crowd the Law God has just given them.3 Below Moses are the people of Israel, who are attentive * Throughout this paper passages from the Theological-Political Treatise (TTP) are referred to by chapter, paragraph number and reference to Gebhardt's edition of Spi noza's Opera.

For my discussion of this painting I draw upon two works of Albert Blankert, Kunst als regeringszaak in Amsterdam in de 17e eeuw: Rondom schilderijen van Ferdinand Bol (with summary in English) (Lochem 1975), and Ferdinand Bol (Doornspijk, 1982); and the doctoral dissertation by Barbara Joyce Buchbinder-Green, The Painted Decorations of the Town Hall of Amsterdam (Evanston, 1974). There is some uncertainty as to the actual date of this painting. It was probably commissioned in 1659, though it was not actually hung until 1664, at the earliest. Bol did not receive payment for it until 1666. See Blankert, Ferdinand Bol, pp. 109-10, and Buchbinder-Green, Painted Decorations, pp. 152-3. 3 According to Buchbinder-Green (Painted Decorations, pp. 153-4), it was Jan van Eyk in 1758 who first suggested this interpretation of the painting in Kunst en historié HISTORY OF POLITICAL THOUGHT.

Having already been brutally punished for their idolatry (Exodus 32:26-35), all the figures below Moses look up to him in awe, except for one who looks down at the ground. If the painting itself does not provide certain evidence for the identity of this figure, we can turn to the marble frieze commissioned by the Amsterdam burgomasters to be set under neath the painting.4 At its centre, the frieze depicts the frenzied scene around the Golden Calf, and at its periphery, the increasingly debase forms of behav iour (singing, dancing, gambling, fighting, fornicating) that occurred as a result. The draped and bearded figure who leads the worship of the idol at the focal point of the frieze is most likely the same as the figure bowing down in the painting. It is Aaron the high priest, who, after having succumbed to the demands of the people and fashioned the idol (Exodus 32:4), now contritely avoids looking directly at Moses. Indeed, the drama of this painting is contained in the tension between these two figures, counterposed along a diagonal axis of light: Moses bearing the law, and Aaron the high priest bowing down before him. As we shall see in more detail below, this painting was commissioned by the Magistrates in order to make a specific political point: the welfare of the people requires that the priests, the interpreters ot the law, be subservient to the authority of the state and its founding principles. We know, from two letters, that Spinoza was working on something resem bling the Theological-Political Treatise in 1665, a year after Bol's painting was finished and hung in the Town Hall; he had probably begun work before then.5 Although the medium is obviously different in each case, Spinoza's Theological-Political Treatise shares certain crucial features with Bol's paint ing. First and foremost they share a common subject, the Hebrews, and more specifically the position of Moses the lawgiver. As we shall see, while Spinoza treats a great range of Biblical events in the Theological-Political Treatise, that of Moses in his capacity as founder of the state is clearly the most important. kundige beschryving en aanmerkingen over aile de schilderyen op het stadhuis te Amsterdam (Amsterdam, 1758), p. 139.

J.A. Clover and Mark Kulstad (Hackett, 1990). Since Bayle's Dictionary entry, most scholars agree that some of the Theological-Political Treatise was drawn from an earlier (and now lost) defence Spinoza had written for himself and his principles at the time of his ban (herem) from the Amsterdam Jewish community in 1656 (see Henry E. Allison, Benedict de Spinoza: An Introduction (Yale, 1987), p. 7).</page><page sequence="3">WHY SPINOZA CHOSE THE HEBREWS 209 Second, Bol's painting and Spinoza's text share a particular socio-historical context: not only were they composed at roughly the same time and place, but they address the same fundamental issues: the ongoing struggle between the Dutch Reformed Church and the state, and also, by extension, the related struggle between the republican States party and the monarchist Orange party. Third, Spinoza and Bol (or at least the authorities who commissioned his work) both understand that to be effective, political argument must go beyond the realm of purely rational discourse. For this reason they attempt to appeal to the masses through an interpretation of an imaginative example.6 But why should this example taken irom .Scripture be relevant to Spinoza s situation, much less to our own? While scholars have all noted Spinoza's use of the Hebrews in the Theological-Political Treatise, their interpretations of it have varied. Some have argued that Spinoza used the ancient Hebrews only as an example of 'a rude and barbarous way of life'; they are not models to be imitated but 'antagonists of the Moderns'.7 But while Spinoza is trying to overturn a sacred view of history and replace it with one more secular, he does not reject the use of the Hebrew example altogether. Important work has also been done tracing Spinoza's relation to his medieval predecessors, particularly Maimonides, and to his liberal successors in the Enlightenment.8 But while the broad historical perspective is crucial to a complete understanding of Spinoza's argument in the Theological-Political Treatise, here I would like to concentrate 6 Although Spinoza says in the preface to the Theological-Political Treatise that Ί do not ask the common people to read these things' (TTP, Preface, 34; GIII/12), in a letter to Oldenburg he had said that one reason why he was undertaking the project that culminated in the Theological-Political Treatise was to avert the accusation held by the 'common people' [vulgus] that he was an atheist (Letter XXX to Oldenburg, September or October 1665, in The Correspondence of Spinoza, trans, and ed. A. Wolf (New York, 1928), p. 206, GV/166). Moreover, although Spinoza did not permit the translation of the Theological-Political Treatise from Latin into Dutch, at that time it was perhaps due more to the unexpectedly strong reaction that the book had provoked rather than an original plan to limit its audience (Letter XLIV to Jarig Jelles, 17 February 1671, Correspondence of Spinoza, ed. Wolf, p. 260, GV/227). I will return to this issue again in the conclusion. All that we need assume at this point is that the audience is composed of persons other than those led exclusively by reason, which is most people. 7 André Tosel, Ύ-a-t-il une philosophie du progrès historique chez Spinoza?', in Spinoza: Issues and Directions, ed. Moreau and Curley (Leiden, 1990), pp. 306-26. A. Matheron also points to passages in which Spinoza emphasizes the primitive aspect of the Hebrews (see e.g. Alexandre Matheron, Le Christ et le salut des ignorants chez Spinoza, (Paris, 1971), pp. 14 ff), but he would not, I think, subscribe to all other aspects of Tosel's interpretation. 8 See Shlomo Pines, 'Spinoza's Tractatus Theologico-Politicus, Maimonides and Kant', in Scripta Hierosolymitana, Vol. 1, ed. Ora Siegel (Jerusalem, 1968), and more recently, Steven B.

Others have insisted that Spinoza adopted this example solely for external reasons, because it belonged to his ostensible political enemies — the Calvinist clergy — and he simply wanted to subvert their use of it.9 Yet, as I hope to show, that approach pays too little attention to the constructive use Spinoza makes of the example. Finally, there are those who are sensitive both to the context in which Spinoza writes and the use he makes of this example to illustrate his own theoretical principles.10 In what follows I will argue along with those in this last group who think that Spinoza uses his analysis of the function of prophecy and religion among the ancient Hebrews to illustrate and solve a deep theoretical problem in the Hobbesian social contract theory as he sets it forth in the Theological-Political Treatise: the need to explain how self-interested individuals in the state of nature are willing to surrender their natural rights and create a sovereign power to which they become subject in civil society. The history of the Hebrews is an example of just how that transition is managed through the prophetic appeal to divine authority and the institutionalization of religion in the life of the state. But we need to delve farther into the question. For even if prophecy solved the Hebrews' dilemma, how can the Hebrew theocracy be relevant to the Dutch republic, or to the modem secular age?" The deeper relevance of the Hebrews must transcend the specificity of their historical situation; their story must tell us something about the constitution of society and the nature of political language itself.12 I suggest that what makes the Hebrews exemplary in this deeper sense is the function of prophetic language: the appeal to an imaginative narrative example that claims universal authority in order to justify a particular set of institutions.13 In other words, when the prophets called the Hebrews 9 Lewis S. Feuer, Spinoza and the Rise of Liberalism (Boston, 1958), p. 119. 10 Sylvain Zac, 'Spinoza et l'état des Hébreux', in Philosophie, théologie, politique dans l'oeuvre de Spinoza (Paris, 1979), pp. 145-89. Etienne Balibar, in Spinoza et la politique (Paris, 1986), also places the Theological-Political Treatise within the political struggles of the time. " P.F.-Moreau, in 'Les Principes de la lecture de l'Ecriture Sainte dans le T.T.P.', Groupes des Recherches Spinozistes: Travaux et Documents, No. 4 (Paris, 1992), pp. 119-31, compares Spinoza's use of the Hebrews to that of his contemporaries (e.g. Koerbagh, Meyer) and concludes that Ί1 est done possible de reprendre comme exemple [i.e. the Hebrew state] ce que l'on refuse comme modèle' (p. 127). In the same volume are useful articles on other uses of the Hebrew state: F. LaPlanche, 'L'érudition Chrétienne aux XVIe et XVIIe siècles et l'état des hébreux' (pp. 133-47); and C.R. Ligota, 'Histoire à fondement théologique: la republique des hébreux' (pp. 149-67). 12 Norman O. Brown, in his article 'Philosophy and Prophecy: Spinoza's Hermeneu tics', Political Theory, Vol. 14 no. 2 (May 1986), pp. 195-213, also considers the function of prophetic language in the political argument of the Theological-Political Treatise, though he focuses on its transformative rather than its exemplary effect. 13 The general sense in which I use the term exemplar is indebted to two recent discussions of this rhetorical concept: Timothy Hampton, Writing from History: The</page><page sequence="5">WHY SPINOZA CHOSE THE HEBREWS 211 'chosen', they were performing a function essential to any society: using the imagination to transcend individual interests and to create a common standard of judgment and behaviour. When Spinoza and Bol chose the Hebrews as their subjects, they were performing a function analogous to that of the prophets, appealing to and interpreting the collective imagination of a people in order to exhort them to right conduct in society. In order to see this further point we must turn to Spinoza's own discussion of exemplaria and the use of such models in the contemporary historical discourse. In what follows, then, I will make four basic points. First, I will take what Spinoza says in the Ethics about an exemplar of human nature as a clear and basic indication of what the purpose of an exemplar is: to transform value from an individual and subjective utility to a universal and objective standard. Second, I will argue that the function of prophecy in the foundation of the state is essentially to fulfil the role of an exemplar, but on a political (not ethical) level; that is, to persuade the individual that his or her interest is only fulfilled through submission to the state's authority. Third, I will show how the history of the Hebrew state exemplifies the tension inherent in an exemplar between its particular imaginative origins and its universal pretensions. Fourth, I will claim that the narrative of the Hebrews' use and misuse of prophecy spoke directly to the Dutch of Spinoza's time and speaks indirectly to the political theorists of our own time. The Origin and Function of an Exemplar in the Ethics Spinoza defines 'good' and 'evil' in the opening definitions of Part 4 of the Ethics: 'By good I shall understand what we certainly know to be useful to us';14 'By evil, however, I shall understand what we certainly know prevents us from being masters of some good'.15 The striking feature of these definitions is their apparent subjectivity. What is useful and therefore good to one person may not be useful and good to another. This, of course, raises an immediate problem about the use of these value terms; for if they are to be meaningful they must apply not only to the experience of a single individual, but to others Rhetoric of Exemplarity in Renaissance Literature (Ithaca, 1990); and John D.

Spinoza is aware of this difficulty and points the reader back for further explanation to the preface of Part 4, in which he discusses the idea of an exemplar of human nature,16 whose very purpose is to bridge the gap between 'subjective' value and 'objective' value.17 The structure and function of such an exemplar is exactly parallel to the structure and function of prophetic language in the Theological-Political Treatise: it provides a bridge for the transition from personal interest or utility to general interest. Let us therefore first examine how Spinoza conceives an exemplar in the Ethics, and then explore the extent to which it is able to fulfil its stated function. An exemplar of human nature is itself an example of a broader category of exemplary ideas, each of which creates a standard on the basis of which value judgments can be made. Let us, for example, take a look at the origin of a judgment about something's perfection. In order to judge the perfection of a thing, men must have some idea of the end for which it was made. Spinoza thinks that he can discern the origin of the notion of perfection in the Latin etymology [perficere from per + facere] of the word itself: 'If someone has decided to make something, and has finished it, then he will call his thing perfect — and so will anyone who rightly knows, or thinks he knows, the mind and purpose of the Author of the work'.18 The idea is that when something is complete, and the end of the author or maker of the work is realized, then it can be said to be perfect. Thus, in an example Spinoza himself gives, when a man desires to build a house, he will consider it perfect when it is complete according to the initial plan he had of it. Of course, if another person does not know the intentions of the author, then he will be unable to judge whether the work is imperfect or perfect. In this sense, a judgment of value is not tied to any broad ovumnlor Kill In ο cnooifir* u/nrV onH ιfc rAlafurp etarrp of PAmnlpfinn As soon as people wish to make judgments about other things whose author's intentions remain unknown, the need arises for broader categories that can subsume specific judgments under more general ideas. That is precisely the structure of an exemplary idea: it is a universal idea that functions as a model, on the basis of which a value judgment may be made. Although the idea of an 'end' is no longer readily apparent, it is nonetheless still very much present as the universal idea towards which things do or should tend. As Spinoza writes: But after men began to form universal ideas, and devise exemplaria of houses, buildings, towers, etc., and to prefer some exemplaria of things to others, it came about that each one called perfect what he saw agreed with 16 In the preface to Part 4, Curley renders the Latin exemplar as 'model'. I prefer to use the cognate 'exemplar' in order to maintain the dual sense of 'example' and 'model' in the original. My reasons should become clearer in what follows. 17 I am indebted for this way of putting the problem of value in Part 4 of the Ethics to an article by Edwin Curley, 'Spinoza's Moral Philosophy', in Spinoza, ed. Marjorie Green (Notre Dame, 1979), pp. 354—76. 18 £4pref.; GII/205.</page><page sequence="7">WHY SPINOZA CHOSE THE HEBREWS 213 the universal idea he had formed of this kind of thing, and imperfect, what he saw agreed less with the exemplar he had conceived, even though its maker thought he had entirely finished it.19 In this way, the meaning of 'perfect' changes from a literal judgment of whether a thing is complete or not, to a more abstract judgment of whether and to what extent the thing conforms to the universal idea of which it is supposed to be exemplary. This move allows an individual to judge the perfection of a thing, whether or not he actually knows the intention of its maker; for now the judgment is not whether a specific intention has been realized but whether the thing realizes an abstract degree of exemplification, under which the particular intentions have been subsumed. One man can thus judge the house of another, not on the basis of the owner's original plan and whether it is complete or not, but on the basis of an idea of what a house as such should be like — in other words, on the basis of a universal idea of a house that serves as an exemplar. TVinc fit thf* camp timf* thiit nnivprcal ÎHpîi ornnnc thinac linHpr a single category, it also functions as the ground for a judgment of their relative 'perfection'. An exemplar is the abstract 'end' towards which things of a certain kind should tend if they were to become perfect; it is the standard which they should imitate and by which they should be judged. The same process occurs in a judgment about whether something is 'good' or 'bad'. As we have seen, Spinoza originally defines these terms from the point of view of an individual's utility. But obviously what is useful to one person at any given time and place may not be to another. Spinoza notes that '. . . one and the same thing can, at the same time, be good, and bad, and also indifferent. For example, Music is good for one who is melancholy, bad for one who is mourning, and neither good nor bad to one who is deaf.20 So if the value terms 'good' and 'bad' are to mean something more than the mere subjective utility of an individual, then it is necessary to find a basis for this kind of judgment that transcends the particular judgment of the individual. That is the specific purpose of an exemplar of human nature. So, after the apparently 'subjective' definitions of good and evil in 4dl and d2, Spinoza points the reader back to the preface, where he says, Ί shall understand by good what we know certainly is a means bv which we mav annroach nearer and nearer to the model of human nature that we set before ourselves. By evil, what we certainly know prevents us from becoming like that model'.21 Exemplars can serve this purpose, as a bridge from 'subjective' to 'objective' value, because they are formed not on the basis of an individual judgment but on the basis of a universal idea. In this 19 Mpref.; GII/206.1 have retained the Latin exemplaria here instead of Curley's uniform translation of it as 'models' because I want to argue that the word means both 'model' and 'example'. I think the first instance of the word in this passage could be translated as 'model' while the second could be translated as 'example'. 20 £4pref. 21 Ibid.</page><page sequence="8">214 M.A. ROSENTHAL light, when an individual judges something (or someone's actions) as good, he is making a judgment that assumes the existence of a model that applies to all things or actions of that kind, and therefore has some injunctive force. However, the so-called 'universal idea' upon which an exemplar is con structed is itself questionable. Spinoza distinguishes between ideas that he calls 'common notions', which 'are the foundations of our reasoning', and 'axioms, or notions, [that] result from other causes', which are 'ill-founded'.22 Universal ideas belong to the second category. Whereas 'common notions' are 'equally in the part and in the whole, [but do] not constitute the essence of any singular thing',23 'universal ideas' (despite their name) are the confused product of a single mind that has been affected by the ideas of many external bodies. Thus a 'universal idea' is derived not from the reflective comparison of the ideas we have of different bodies but from 'fortuitous encounters with things'25 that are superimposed one upon the other through the equally haphazard procedures of memory.26 It is not an 'adequate idea', the clear and distinct foundation of reason, but an 'inadequate idea', nothing more than a mutilated and confused image of the external world.27 As an image, a 'universal idea' is, at bottom, always the product of a subjective experience of the external world.28 For this reason it can never attain 22 £2p40s 1. 23 £2p37. 24 As Spinoza writes, 'Those notions they call Universal, like Man, Horse, Dog, etc., have arisen... because so many images (e.g, of men) are formed at one time in the human Body that they surpass the power of imagining — not entirely, of course, but still to the point where the Mind can imagine neither slight differences of the singular [men] (such as the color and size of each one, etc.) nor their determinate number, and imagines distinctly only what they agree in, insofar as they affect the body. For the body has been affected most [forcefully] by [what is common], since each singular has affected it [by this property]. And [the mind] expresses this by the word man, and predicates it of infinitely many singulars.' (£2p40sl.) 25 £2p29s. 26 Memory is nothing other than the association of two or more images following the order of a body's interactions with the external world. See £2pl8s. 27 Spinoza sums up the difference between adequate and inadequate ideas in £2p29s, where he writes: Ί say expressly that the Mind has, not an adequate, but only a confused [and mutilated] knowledge, of itself, of its own Body, and of external bodies, so long as it perceives things from the common order of nature, i.e. so long as it is determined externally, from fortuitous encounters with things, to regard this or that, and not so long as it is determined internally, from the fact that it regards a number of things at once, to understand their agreements, differences, and oppositions. For so often as it is disposed internally, in this or another way, then it regards things clearly and distinctly ...'. 28 '... to retain the customary words, the affections of the human Body, whose ideas present external bodies as present to us, we shall call images of things, even if they do not reproduce the [external] figures of things. And when the Mind regards bodies in this way, we shall say that it imagines' (£2pl7s).</page><page sequence="9">WHY SPINOZA CHOSE THE HEBREWS 215 the truly universal status to which, in name at least, it aspires. Certainly some images are more frequently repeated or are more vivid than others. But that only explains why some images become the central features of these general ideas, not why they ought to be described as 'universal'. The fact is, as Spinoza emphasizes, that 'these notions are not formed by all [men] in the same way, but vary one to another, in accordance with what the body has more often been affected by, and what the imagination recollects more easily'.29 So, although someone might think that the term 'Man' refers to a single, universal genus, in fact, when the actual description of that genus is given, its extension will vary depending upon which features of bodies have most vigorously or frequently affected the knower. One person will understand by 'Man' 'an animal of erect stature', another, struck by another feature, will understand it as 'an animal capable of laughter', and so on.30 These definitions may be useful as an aid to memory, but as a means towards scientific truth or as a way to overcome the subjectivity of value judgments they are flawed.31 The problem is that the very appearance or universality in which such terms are draped obscures their origins as judgments made by individuals in particular circumstances. These particular judgments appear as natural categories, which are discovered rather than in vented, but like teleological explanations of nature, they are really impositions of human categories, produced by the imagination, upon the natural world. Thus, as Spinoza himself realized, since exemplars are not common notions derived from adequate ideas of the natural world, but rather ill-founded con structs of the imagination, these so-called 'beings of reason' are perhaps more aptly named 'beings of the imagination'.32 For the sake of gaining an appear ance of objectivity, we can easily confound exemplars based upon universal ideas with real natural categories, but we can never really escape their origins in the subjective domain of imaginative experience. 29 £2p40sl. 30 Ibid. 31 Set Appendix Containing Metaphysical Thoughts, Part 1, ch. 1: 'So when Plato said that man is a featherless biped, he erred no more than those who said that man is a rational animal. For Plato was no less aware than anyone else that man is a rational animal. But he referred man to a certain class so that, when he wished to think about man, he would immediately fall into the thought of man by recalling that class, which he could easily remember. Indeed Aristotle erred very seriously if he thought that he had adequately explained the human essence by that definition of his. Whether, indeed, Plato did well, one can only ask.' (The Collected Works of Spinoza, p. 301; GI/235.) 32 'We see, therefore, that all the notions by which ordinary people are accustomed to explain nature are only modes of imagining, and do not indicate the nature of anything, only the constitution of the imagination. And because they have names, as if they were [notions] of beings existing outside the imagination, I call them beings, not of reason, but of imagination.' (Zslapp.; Gil 83/11-17.) See also Martial Gueroult, Spinoza II (L'Âme) (Hildesheim, 1974), Vol. 2, p. 415.</page><page sequence="10">216 M.A. ROSENTHAL The need for exemplars should now be clear. They are 'notions we are accustomed to feign'33 in order to compare and judge individuals of the same kind in some certain manner. But it should also be clear that insofar as they are based upon universal ideas that are ultimately derived from the imagination, they fail in their purpose of defining an 'objective' and certain standard of value. It remains an open question to what extent these exemplars, 'beings' more of the 'imagination' than of 'reason', can lead us to an ethical life in Spinoza's sense — that is, a life governed by reason.34 But in another guise, that of prophecy, exemplars will play a critically important role in the political sphere, where, according to Spinoza, the imagination and the passions necessarily dominate. The Origin and Function of Prophecy in the Theological-Political Treatise As Spinoza analyses it, prophecy has both the structure and the function of an exemplar: it is an inadequately conceived universal idea that serves to guide the judgment and conduct of men. Although prophecy originates in the particular situation of the prophet, and uses highly imaginative language to express its views, it claims universal authority because it appeals to God as its source. Moreover, despite the theologians who 'have accommodated Scripture to [Ar istotelian and Platonic] speculations',35 the true purpose of prophecy is not speculative but ultimately practical: it exhorts men to 'right conduct' in their affairs. In other words, it creates a standard that is used to judge other people's actions and that also serves as a model to be imitated. Spinoza explains the idea of the Hebrews' 'chosenness' or 'election' by God in the context of the exemplary function of prophecy. The prophets called their people 'chosen' in order to exhort them to conduct that the people would believe was approved by God, a universal authority; and, to the extent that the people followed the exhortations of their prophets and adhered to a single standard of 'right' conduct, they saw visible proof of their 'chosenness' in the positive results of social cohesion, which in turn became a further incentive to follow the prophets, thus reinforcing the original standard of conduct. As we shall now 33 £4pref. 34 Edwin Curley, in 'Spinoza's Moral Philosophy', thinks that Spinoza 'must be saying that we can form an idea of human nature, which is rightly used as a standard of judgment' (p. 364). Curley holds that there are adequate ideas of human nature which, because an individual will necessarily desire to realize them (as a function of his or her conatus), are objective. For other views on the relation of an adequate idea of human nature and the ideal of the 'free man', see Dan Garber's recent paper delivered to the Jerusalem Spinoza conference, 'Dr. Fischelson's Dilemma: Spinoza on Freedom and Sociability' (Leiden, forthcoming); and Lee Rice's 'TanquamNaturaeHumanaeExem plar: Spinoza on Human Nature', in The Modern Schoolman, LXVIII (May 1991), pp. 291-303. 35 TTP, Preface, 18; GIII/9.</page><page sequence="11">s £*Ky . t là i j Ijr* : app ·Ρ·η K*.s ♦ A. .M§* &amp; '</page><page sequence="12">WHY SPINOZA CHOSE THE HEBREWS 217 see, the exemplary structure of prophecy uniquely suits it to solve the problem that arose for the ancient Hebrews in the Sinai desert, a problem equivalent to that found in the theoretical 'state of nature'. Let us look at this problem and how Spinoza thinks that prophecy was able to address it. In the Theological-Political Treatise, Spinoza examines in great detail how Moses was able to found the Hebrew state. When the Hebrews were cast out of Egypt into the desert they had no constitution of their own: 'they were no longer bound by the legislation of any other nation, so that they were permitted to enact new laws as they wished'.36 But the problem was that 'they were quite incapable of ordaining legislation wisely and retaining the dominion in their own hands, as a body', for the reason that '[a]lmost all of them were crude in their understanding and weakened by wretched bondage'.37 Moses, aware that his people were unable to take control of their own destiny, realized that 'the dominion had to remain in the hands of one person only, who would command the others and compel them by force, and who would prescribe laws and afterwards interpret them'.38 But how could Moses alone compel his people, against their divergent individual interests, to obey him? He realized that even if he were able to gather enough support to use physical force he would not be successful in his long-terms aims; for the 'obstinate temperament of the people . . . would not allow itself to be compelled by force' ,39 Peaceful means were necessary if the state would endure. Thus, Moses had recourse to the invocation of divine power and authority, first in order to ensure his own power;40 then, to institute the state.41 Moses overcame the lawless condition of the Hebrews by instituting a state based on religious practices and ceremonies, a successful theocracy whose nominal king was God.42 That alone, for Spinoza, was the purpose of Sinai, and was what entitled the ancient Hebrews to be called a 'chosen people'. We have already noted the situation of the ancient Hebrew nation once they had left the slavery of Egypt under Pharoah. They were no longer subject to the laws of any other nation and were free to choose a new set of laws and 36 77P, V, 26; GIII/74. 37 TTP, V, 27; GIII/75. 38 Ibid. 39 7TP, V, 28; GIII/75. 40 'Moses was easily able to retain this dominion, because he excelled the others in divine power, persuaded the people that he had it, and showed this by many testimonies' (ibid.). 41 'Moses, by the divine power and command, introduced religion into the Body politic, so that the people would do their duty not so much from fear as from devotion' (TTP, V, 29; GIII/75). 42 In the Discourses onLivy, Machiavelli makes a very similar argument. Numa was able to transform Rome from a city based on force to a city founded on principles of law and obedience, through the use of religion (Discourses, Book 1, §11). On this parallel see also Brown, 'Philosophy and Prophecy: Spinoza's Hermeneutics', pp. 208-9.</page><page sequence="13">218 M.A. ROSENTHAL institutions for themselves.43 Spinoza describes their situation in these juridical terms: For after they had been freed from the intolerable oppression of the Egyp tians, and had not attached themselves to any mortal by any contract, they again acquired their natural right to do everything they could, and each of them could decide anew whether he wanted to keep it, or to surrender it and transfer it to someone else.44 But why could they not just decide their future rationally among themselves? Using concepts developed in his analysis of 'natural and civil right' in the previous chapter, Spinoza suggests that the difficulties the Hebrews faced in their task were juridically and psychologically equivalent to those faced in the 'state of nature'45 The dilemma they faced in their lawless condition was that, although each person had the natural right to make his or her own decision, the very exercise of that right prevented the institution of civil society. The problem results from the fact that most people are led not by reason but by their appetites and passions. In the state of nature, an individual lives according to his 'natural right', that is, an individual has 'the supreme right... to exist and act as it is naturally determined to do'.46 But most people are not determined to live according to the dictates of reason; 'on the contrary', Spinoza omnhQci7i&gt;c ' t h.1 \ ' orp ') 1 ! horn iirnomnt of .

Indeed, in the state of nature, each person 'is permitted, by supreme natural right, to want and to take, in whatever way, whether by force, by deception, by entreaties, or by whatever other way is, in the end, easier'.51 The 'obstinacy' of the Hebrews was anchored 43 See also TTP, XVII, 26; GIII/205. 44 Ibid. 45 See Matheron, Le Christ et le salut des ignorants chez Spinoza, p. 10. Douglas Den Uyl argues that the Hebrews were not in the 'state of nature' because they already had the rudiments of social life (D.

In Spinoza's view, Moses understood what needed to be done in order to forestall the disintegration of the state of nature into conflict and chaos: he needed 'to so establish a political authority that there is no room left for deception, indeed, to so establish everything that everyone, no matter what his mentality, prefers the public right to the private advantage'.52 Moses also realized that an appeal to disinterested reason would not work with the Hebrew masses, who were led by desire and appetite. Spinoza, in fact, denies the possibility of the masses ever acting on the basis of anything but personal advantage: individuals must therefore somehow be led to act for the public good through their own self-interest. Since 'no contract can have any force except by reason of its utility' it is entirely rational for an individual to break a contract (whether private or social) when it no longer serves his purpose.53 Hence, if someone is going to try to persuade the unruly masses that cooperation is in their best interest, he or she must be aware of what Spinoza calls the 'universal law of human nature', namely that 'between two goods, each person chooses the one he judges to be the greater, and between two evils, the one which seems to him lesser'.54 To this iron law of self-interest, though, Spinoza adds one important rider: the individual chooses 'the one which seems to the person choosing to be greater or lesser, and not that things necessarily are as he judges them to be'.55 According to Spinoza, not only did Moses understand the underlying logic of self-interest that governs human behaviour in the state of nature, but he also understood that the appearance of self-interest was as important as its reality. His strategy therefore was to manipulate the appearance of self-interest until it was identical with real public interest. Moses appealed to revelation as the source of his views because prophetic revelation spoke to the situation of the people in language that they could readily understand and which directly appealed to their individual self-interest while using it in service of the community. Spinoza defines prophecy as vivid imaginary language used by a person (a prophet) to exhort the ignorant masses to right conduct. The Prophets 'perceived God's revelations only with the aid of the imagination, i.e. by the mediation of 52 TTP, XVII, 16; GIII/203. 53 TTP, XVI, 20; GIII/192. Spinoza gives the example of a person who deceptively contracts with a robber to deliver goods to him at a later date. Spinoza thinks that when the person is later released he has no obligation whatsoever to make good on the promise; indeed he is fully rational to renege on it (TTP, XVI, 16-19; GIII/192). As Curley notes, this contrasts starkly with Hobbes's view of the same example (see Hobbes, De cive, ii, 16; Hobbes, Leviathan, xiv). 54 TTP, XVI, 15; GIII/192. 55 Ibid.</page><page sequence="15">220 M.A. ROSENTHAL words or of images, the latter of which might be either true or imaginary'.56 God communicated to the prophets through either a 'true voice', as he did to Moses alone, or 'visible forms and symbols', that often appear in a dream, such as Joshua's vision of an angel with a sword. But Spinoza does not think that the prophets had any super-human capacity, only a more vivid imagination than others: 'the Prophets were endowed, not with a more perfect mind, but instead with a power of imagining unusually vividly'.57 However, since the people were ignorant of its causes, they misinterpreted the richness of prophetic language as an indication of its divine, supernatural origin. Thus, 'the Prophets were said to have the Spirit of God because men were ignorant of the causes of Prophetic knowledge, wondered at it, and on that account, were accustomed to refer it to God — as they did all other abnormal phenomena — and to call it the knowledge of God'.58 It is this very misunderstanding of prophecy which paradoxically explains its success in guiding conduct. For although the prophet speaks in language that addresses a particular set of circumtances it is under stood by its audience to have universal authority. Only then can it function effectively to define 'right' conduct, not only for the individual but for every one. We can see how this misunderstanding works if we continue our examination of interpersonal dynamics in the state of nature. Because there are no prior rules of conduct in the state of nature, each interaction between individuals has an uncertain outcome. A person can never be sure whether he will be deceived by the other or not, or even whether he will live or die. This uncertainty produces a constant affective vacillation in the individual between hope that things will turn out in his self-interest and fear that they will not. Indeed, the wretchedness of the state of nature is such that there is good reason among people to presume strongly that things will not turn out in their favour. As Spinoza remarks in the opening sentences of the preface to the Theological-Political Treatise, people 'are often reduced to such straits that they can bring no plan into operation, and since they generally vacillate wretchedly between hope and fear, from an immoderate desire for the uncertain goods of fortune, for the most part their hearts are ready to believe anything at all'.59 This is the fertile ground upon which both prophecy and superstition take root. Despite their differences, which we shall examine in some detail in the next section, both prophecy and super stition address the same problem: the uncertain relations an individual has with external persons and things (fortune),60 and the wrenching vacillation between hope and fear that stems from this human condition. 56 TTP, I, 43; GIII/27. 57 TTP, II, 1 ; GIII/29. 58 7TP, I, 42; GIII/27-8. 59 TTP, Pref., 1; GIII/5. 60 It is not a coincidence that both the opening sentences of the Theological-Political Treatise and the preface to Part 4 of the Ethics both begin with a reference to fortune —</page><page sequence="16">WHY SPINOZA CHOSE THE HEBREWS 221 Prophecy is able to address a person's self-interest, not by way of the abstract principles of reason, but by way of his or her own uncertainties and passions. Since, 'by natural right each person can act deceptively, and is bound to stand by the contract only by the hope of a greater good and fear of a greater evil',61 each person is interested in arriving at what concrete expectations (i.e. whether his hopes will be realized or not) he has for an outcome that would justify his abiding by the contract. A person will listen to prophecy because he or she desires above all to have a consistent set of expectations about the results of his or her actions, and prophecy appears to provide that certainty through its status as the word of God. In other words, it regulates a person's hopes and fears by locating them in a larger scheme of things, which is itself governed by an omnipotent being who expresses various passions (anger, care, etc.) — God. In this way, what works for one individual can also work for another, and a pattern of stable interactions emerges.62 Thus, while prophecy satisfies a person's narrowlv conceived self-interest in the state of nature — i.e. to end or at least regulate the vacillation between hope and fear — it also serves the general interest by establishing a standard of conduct which all can be expected to, and indeed do, imitate. Therefore, when Moses called the Hebrews 'chosen' he was not merely describing their relation to God but actively exhorting them to a certain way of life that would mould them into a nation. In fact, the Hebrews were a lawless band of people cast out into the desert, thrown back into the 'state of nature'. But Moses, in order to give them a law and found a nation, placed their particular experience into the framework of a divine plan in which they played a special role. He took what had been their bad fortune and recast it as the founding principle of their society.63 This idea appealed to the particular experience of each person and yet provided a broad basis upon which to build institutions and practices that would coordinate interactions between self interested individuals. Although in effect the people were transferring their the power of external things over human affairs. While here I assume the theoretical construct of the state of nature, I think Spinoza does provide a deeper metaphysical reason for its actual existence, which he calls the power of 'fortune'. For the role of 'fortune' in the Theological-Political Treatise, see F. Mignini, 'Theology as the Work and Instrument of Fortune', in Spinoza's Political and Theological Thought, ed. C. De Deugd, pp. 127-36. 61 TTP, XVI, 23; GUI/193. 62 Of course there still may be people who refuse to accept the prophet's teaching and continue to deceive others. But Spinoza's claim is that most men will desire to accept it. From that point on, the few who do not could be compelled by force. 63 Machiavelli admires Moses — along with Romulus, Cyrus and others — for this same reason: 'They owed nothing to fortune but the opportunity which gave them matter to be shaped into what form they thought fit; and without that opportunity their powers would have been wasted, and without their powers the opportunity would have come to nothing' (Machiavelli, The Prince, Ch. 6).</page><page sequence="17">222 M.A. ROSENTHAL natural right to the authority of Moses, they believed they were giving it to God. 'God alone, then, held political authority over the Hebrews, and this authority alone, by the force of the covenant, was rightly called the Kingdom of God, and God was rightly called also the King of the Hebrews.'64 This anthropomor phic concept of God, a ruler who made a covenant with and guided his people in history, made it easy for individuals to transform their hopes and fears in relation to other people to hopes and fears in relation to God himself. Moses was not interested in teaching the people, with their 'childish understanding', about the nature of God as such, but only about His plan for their conduct, their rights and responsibilities to Him. Thus, he ritualized the people's relationship with their God into ceremonies and practices, and in this way the worship of God meant the establishment of institutions through which the founding prin ciples of the state were made to endure. Spinoza is quick to point out that the sense in which the ancient Hebrews λ*/ργρ pVincpn wac nniniip tn thpm· 4thp Ϊ tiu/q nf thp OIH Tp.Qtamp.nt wptp rPVP.alp.H and prescribed only to the Jews'.65 Moreover, we might think that this story would only be useful to other people who themselves are of 'primitive' under standing and predisposed to believe in an anthropomorphic God, miracles and the like.66 But there is an important point to be made before we dismiss the history of the ancient Hebrews out of hand: it is not necessarily the content of prophecy itself that is exemplary to others — for as Spinoza emphasizes, it addresses the particular situation of the Hebrews alone — but the structure of prophecy and its function in the state. Spinoza is not trying to eliminate the use of prophetic language, for he realizes that it would be impossible as long as people are driven by their appetites and passions and think through the medium of the imagination alone. Rather, he is attempting to attack and undermine a misuse of exemplary language, a misuse which is also illustrated in the narrative of the Hebrews. Prophecy and Superstition Although, as we have seen, prophecy performs a crucial function in the creation and maintenance of the state, a danger lurks in the exemplary language of prophecy itself: people can easily mistake the appeal to divine authority for an appeal to the truth. That is precisely the difference between religion and 64 TTP, XVII, 30; GIII/206. 65 TTP, III, 22; GIII/48. 66 We see a parallel case in Machiavelli's Discourses where, after having described the men who were persuaded by Numa's invocation of the gods as 'rude' and 'unculti vated', he ironically undercuts the distance between ancient Roman times and his own by pointing out that '[it] did not seem to the people of Florence that they were either ignorant or rude, yet they were persuaded by Friar Girolamo Savonarola that he had converse with God' (Machiavelli, Discourses, 1.11).</page><page sequence="18">WHY SPINOZA CHOSE THE HEBREWS 223 superstition, in Spinoza's view.67 Both religion and superstition originate under the same set of circumstances: the uncertainty and affective vacillation charac teristic of the state of nature; and both have the same immediate purpose: to guide wretched, self-interested individuals in their behaviour; but while religion uses the prophetic language of revelation for the sake of teaching knowledge about right conduct alone, superstition uses prophetic language to lay claim to the truth about nature itself. While religion stays within the epistemological limits of prophetic language, superstition oversteps them. The result, at least in the scriptural history of the ancient Hebrews, is that while the prescriptions of religion are based upon devotion to God and produce a relatively stable society, the prescriptions of superstition are almost invariably based upon the fear of an earthly King and produce conflict. To see why this is so, we must first explain in more detail the tension within prophetic language itself and then turn to how this tension is exemplified in the narrative of the Hebrews. We can see how superstition develops out of prophetic language if we briefly recall what Spinoza says about exemplars in the Ethics. The purpose of an exemplar is to establish an 'objective standard' of value, which it does by an appeal to a 'universal' idea. But this universal idea of something can itself often 67 One problem here is that Spinoza is not entirely consistent in the terms he uses for this distinction between the proper and improper use of prophecy. In the preface to the Theological-Political Treatise, for instance, he refers to the difference between religion and superstition (TTP, Pref., 3). But we must also keep in mind the difference between what Spinoza calls 'true religion' (e.g. see TTP, ΧΠ, 22-3; GIII/162—3) based on divine law, and ceremonial religion based on rituals, which is something like the distinction Wernham, in his introduction to Spinoza: The Political Works, makes between 'inward' and 'outward' religion (A.G. Wernham, Spinoza: The Political Works (Oxford, 1958), pp. 34-5), though Wernham does not insist that inward religion must be true only that it cannot be controlled by the sovereign. Curley also interprets Spinoza's reference to superstitio animi {TTP, Pref., 5; GIII/6, literally, superstition of the mind) as 'true superstition' in contrast to 'false' superstition, which is 'a manipulative use of seers which takes advantage of the people's belief in them' (see his footnote 2). I identify this 'true' use of superstition with the proper function of 'outward' religion. That is, it directs the populace to act in conformity with the precepts of inward religion (such as acts of charity, justice and loving kindness) even though they are not necessarily motivated in these acts by reason (see TTP, XII, 34-7; GUI/165 for the foundations of Scriptural religion). In the 'false' use of superstition, we find the confusion of speculative knowledge with the realm of the imagination, a confusion common (albeit in different ways) to both those theologians who would interpret Scripture on the basis of Platonic or Aristotelian categories and to soothsayers who would interpret events with the auguries of birds {TTP, Pref., 18; GIII/9, and Pref., 5; GIII/6). In both cases, the 'seer' is using some notion of divine authority not to inspire 'right conduct' but rather to 'prop up his own inventions' and authority {TTP, XII, 40; GIII/166). I would like to standardize these different terms in line with my interpretation: that is, 'religion' does not refer to the knowledge of the divine law (for that is 'philosophy') but to the proper function of cermonial law (i.e. to exhort to right conduct as true superstition does), while 'superstition' refers to the perversion of the function of ceremonial law itself.</page><page sequence="19">224 M.A. ROSENTHAL prove to be epistemologically inadequate. That is, although it claims to repre sent the ideal or model of all things of a certain kind, in fact it might represent only a particular image or a series of particular images blurred together. For example, an exemplar of human nature formed in this manner looks as if it is a rational concept common to all, though in fact it is an imaginative construct that reflects the unique situation and experience of its creator. For it to fulfd its function — to create a standard of value and conduct — an exemplar of human nature trades on its appearance of universality in order for it to be accepted in practice by the multitude. Thus, even as Spinoza underlines the need and desire for such an exemplar, he is also careful to point out the possible errors to which its underlying epistemological ambiguity can potentially lead. Most impor tantly, Spinoza warns the reader against imagining that exemplars and the values attendant on them are found in, or products of, nature itself. They are just human constructs made in order to compare things, to judge relative value, and to emulate in one's actions. As soon as those who use an exemplar violate its intrinsic epistemological and practical limitations — using it to explain nature itself, rather than simply as a guide to conduct — it tends to lose its ability to serve its original purpose. Moreover, certain people, realizing that the masses are ignorant and easily manipulated, are eager purposely to misuse these exemplars ιυ gain power ior memseives. What the misuse of an ethical exemplar and the misuse of prophetic language have in common is a misapplication of teleological thinking to nature. In the preface to Part 4 of the Ethics, Spinoza reiterates his critique of cosmic theology articulated in the appendix to Part 1 : 'Nature does nothing on account of an end . . . What is called a final cause is nothing but a human appetite insofar as it is considered as a principle, or primary cause, of some thing.' But, since human beings imagine nature to act as they do, on account of an end, 'when they see something happen in nature which does not agree with the model they have conceived of this kind of thing, they believe that Nature itself has failed or sinned, and left the thing imperfect.68 It is legitimate to speak of 'ends' in human affairs, which are conceived primarily through the imagination, but it is a profound error to read such an idea back into nature, which is governed by eternal and necessary laws conceived by reason alone. Teleological explanation has a inevitable role in the explanation of human affairs, but must be eschewed in the explanation of nature itself.69 The problem is that some people want to 68 £4pref. 69 If man were able to live by reason alone, which would be to live and act in accordance with his determinate nature, then there would be no need for concepts of good and evil at all (£4p67). For these concepts arise because man is dependent on external things in order to preserve his existence. Since an individual desires what he lacks, to the extent that external things prevent a person from living in full accordance with his nature, he will imagine and desire a more perfect nature, one that lacks nothing, as his 'end'.</page><page sequence="20">WHY SPINOZA CHOSE THE HEBREWS 225 claim that their exemplar of human nature, which they set before men as an end that ought to govern their action, is itself an end of nature, thus confusing the realm of the imagination, which for the most part determines human values, with that of reason, which legitimately determines the truths of nature.70 We see this problem most acutely when we look at how Moses' prophetic pronouncement, that the ancient Hebrews were 'chosen' by God, was inter preted and used in the course of their history. As we saw above, the prophets used this notion in order to bridge the gap between personal interest in the state of nature and common interest in a civil society. It worked because it appealed directly to the Hebrews while locating them within a story of universal signifi cance; it explained what had happened and what they ought to do in the future. But although this narrative was teleological — i.e. it established an end (a model of conduct) that the Hebrews were obliged to realize (or imitate) in their actions — it did not necessarily violate the epistemological limits of prophetic lan guage. Moses himself, as Spinoza emphasizes,71 knew that the Hebrews were 'chosen' to be distinct from other nations, not for their wisdom or blessedness, but for their success in temporal matters. He spoke 'according to the Hebrews' power of understanding' in order 'to warn [them] in this way ... so that he might bind them more to the worship of God' ,72 In other words, Moses used prophetic language for its effect, which was to strengthen those very institutions for which the Hebrews had been 'chosen' in the first place, not because it taught anything about the workings of nature itself. The notion of a 'calling' allowed the Hebrews to preserve themselves by placing the self-interested desires of each individual within the larger framework of God's plan that involved choosing them, the Hebrew nation, as the main protagonist. On this level the teleological explanation of their actions was perfectly legitimate; there was no attempt to claim that the Jews were chosen for anything other than a certain form of conduct. Moses was able to translate the prophetic idea of a 'calling' directly into concrete social practices that preserved the state and protected its own ideologi cai (i.e. propncuc) rounaation. in otner words, he established a religion whose purpose was to maintain the social pact (in the form of a theocracy, in which power and right was symbolically transferred from the masses to God) through the institution of law. But at no point did Moses confuse the laws of the Hebrew theocracy, which were created by humankind and particular to it, with the eternal laws of nature decreed by God. Certainly, piety was identified with obeying civil law, and civil law was not distinguished from religious ceremo nies and rites: 'So, in this state civil law and Religion (which as we have shown, 70 For more on this point, see the appendix to Part 1 of the Ethics, especially from 11/81/25 to the end. 71 TTP, III, 3; GIII/44. Spinoza refers to Deuteronomy 9:6-7. 72 TTP, in, 5; GIII/44.</page><page sequence="21">226 M.A. ROSENTHAL consists only in obedience to God) were one and the same thing.'73 Yet there was no confusion of this religious law, which encompassed both ceremonial and civil law, with the 'divine law', which teaches the eternal truths of nature through the 'natural light' (reason) innate in every person.74 Moses himself claimed no true knowledge of God75 but only exhorted the Hebrews to right conduct: 'The tenets of the religion were not teachings, but laws and commands; piety was thought to be justice, and impiety a crime and an injustice' ,76 For the individual, obeying the ceremonial laws of religion was identical not only with his moral duty77 but also with his political life: for '[ajnyone who failed in his Religious duties ceased to be a citizen, and for this alone was considered an enemy; anyone who died for Religion was considered to have died for his Country, and absolutely no distinction was made between civil law and relig ion'.78 Therefore, for the state, the practice of these ceremonial laws by its citizens meant its continued existence. Tn this lieht. it was no accident that most of the religious ceremonies of the Jews could not be performed by an individual alone but only by a group.79 Moses identified civil law and religious law in order to inspire obedience to the state, not through fear of an earthly authority, but through devotion to a divine being who had ordered the life of His chosen people in this particular manner, that is, through the practice of these laws and rituals. Moses also showed that he was aware of the epistemological and practical limits of the prophetic foundation of the Hebrew state in the way he organized its constitution. Most importantly, he separated the powers of the political authorities, whom he charged with administering and enforcing the law, from those of the priestly caste, charged with interpreting the law. In order to foster the belief that God was the actual monarch of the state, Moses constructed (with common resources) a 'palace of God' that would serve as a visible reminder of the presence of divine authority.80 He also appointed one of the tribes, the Levites, to be 'the courtiers and administrators of this divine palace' .81 The chief 73 TTP, XVII, 31; GIII/205. 74 'By human law I understand a manner of living which serves only to protect life and the state; by a divine law, one which aims only at the greatest good, i.e. the true knowledge and love of God' (TTP, IV, 8; GIII/59). Spinoza describes the universal character of divine law and the way in which the 'natural light' (reason) that discovers it is common to all men in TTP, I, 1-5; GIII/16. 75 See TTP, IV, 29; GIII/64. 76 TTP, XVII, 31; GIII/205. 77 Even general moral precepts were not taught to the Jews as true for all men but were accommodated to their particular understanding and practice (TTP, V, 7; GIII/70). 78 7TP, XVII, 31; GIII/205. 79 See TTP, V, 2; GIII/69. Conversely, the divine law does not require any ceremony at all (TTP, TV, 20; GIII/62). 80 TTP, XVII, 42; GIII/208. 81 TTP, XVII, 43; GIII/208.</page><page sequence="22">WHY SPINOZA CHOSE THE HEBREWS 227 of the Levites, Moses' brother Aaron, was 'the supreme interpreter of the divine laws, the one who gave the people the replies of the divine oracle, and finally, the one who petitioned God on behalf of the people'.82 But Moses made sure that although they had the power of interpretation of God's law the priests did not have the authority to command that they be obeyed; this he left exclusively in his own control. The priests perpetuated the illusion that God had ordained the state by performing the religious rites that were commanded by God and interpreting the law, and in this way the actual leaders of the state, beginning with Moses himself, enjoyed the venerated status of being 'the ministers of God's state and . . . God's agents' without giving up any of their political authority.83 This separation of powers set limits on the leaders' authority, since they had to act within the law, and preserved the integrity of the priestly caste, since they could only gain honour by their interpretations.84 Moses used the priests to maintain the fiction that preserved his authority. But he also realized the dangers involved When he tent for himself the eyelnsive. rioht of enforeino the law, he tried to make sure that the priests would not overstep their bounds and think that their privileged status as the interpreters of God's law gave them the power to enforce it, a step that would effectively undermine his own authority.85 However, the very fiction that had founded the state could easily be perverted by the priests for their own ends. Spinoza sees the prophetic foundation of the Hebrew state as both its greatest strength and its fatal weakness. For although prophecy could serve as the basis of a religion uniquely suited to bind the Hebrews together into a cohesive political entity, it could also be distorted into a set of superstitious beliefs that might tear them apart. Spinoza argues that the Levites were the cause of the ruin of the state for at least two reasons. First, their privileged status led to grumbling and division among the other tribes. Already, before Moses' death, there were signs of discontent among the élite. The very success of the state constituted at Sinai had given men the leisure to question the divine authority Moses had claimed, and his motives in estab lishing the Levites (with his brother at their head) as a special caste.86 Once the 82 Ibid. 83 TTP, XVII, 65; GIII/212. 84 7TP,XVn, 63^; GIII/212. 85 I neglect other features of the Hebrew state that Spinoza cites in TTP, XVII, as important reasons for its success: its citizen army (para. 69); the fact that the leaders themselves were bound together through a common religion (para. 70); the equal share in the ownership of all lands and fields (para. 84); the feasts and rituals that inspired a joyful devotion (paras. 89-91); the reverence for the temple (para. 92), etc. 86 Compare to TTP, Preface, 2; GIII/5: 'For no one has lived among men without seeing that, when they are prospering, even those who are quite inexperienced are generally so overflowing with wisdom that they believe themselves to be wronged if anyone wants to give them advice.'</page><page sequence="23">228 M.A. ROSENTHAL veil of appearances that was so crucial to the maintenance of the state had been pierced, rebellion became so widespread among the people that it was only ended through some 'great calamity or plague';87 this was a sign of things to come. Second, and more importantly, the special role reserved for the Levites led them to abuse their own power and thereby create turmoil in the state. Especially after Moses died and no one assumed the role of supreme commander, there was little to prevent the Levites from claiming not only the right to interpret laws but also the right to enforce them.88 They found the justification for their actions in a new interpretation of God's word, provided by the 'many relentless and foolish Theologians' among them.89 These men were not mindful of the limits of prophetic knowledge and interpreted the laws of right conduct as if they were the laws of nature itself. But this move, although useful in justifying the priests' claim to political authority, had catastrophic consequences for the state. Religious authority, originally instituted by Moses in order to benefit all, became the means of a small group to dominate the rest. Spinoza thinks that in order to gain power the priests claimed that they had not only the right to interpret the laws but the right to enforce them as well. To justify this claim they used prophecy not to exhort the masses to right conduct, aa iiau uiigiiianj' utcii imtnu^u, uui ni uiuçi ιυ manipulais ins niaaaua ιυ ui^n own ends. The masses' very ignorance and fear which made prophecy effective in the first place, paradoxically also enabled the theologians to transform their religion into superstition.90 As we have seen above, since the masses were ignorant of the divine law of nature, they were quick to take anything extraor dinary as a sign of God's will. The vivid nature of prophetic language itself was inexplicable to them, and was consequently considered as a higher form of knowledge.91 But the willingness of the masses to accept the word of prophecy allowed them to be easily misled. For example, whereas Moses and the other prophets had used 'miracles' not to teach about the nature of God but to guide the people,92 the priests used them much as soothsayers used the entrails of 87 ΤΤΡ, χνπ, 103-4; GIII/2I9. 88 ΤΤΡ, XVII, 100; GIII/218. 89 77Ρ, XVII, 99; GIII/218. 90 See ΤΤΡ, Preface, 4; GIII/5: 'Because reason cannot show a certain way to the hollow things they desire, they call it blind and human wisdom hollow. The delusions of the imagination, on the other hand, and dreams and childish follies they believe to be divine answers.' 91 ' [T]he Prophets were said to have the Spirit of God because men were ignorant of the causes of Prophetic knowledge, wondered at it, and on that account, were accustomed to refer it to God — as they did all other abnormal phenomena — and to call it the knowledge of God' (7TP, I, 42; GIII/27-8). 92 The true prophets did not think miracles were exceptions to the law of nature (TTP, VI, 6; GIII/83), nor did they think they could be used to learn about the nature of God (ΤΤΡ, VI, 30; GIII/87).

But the very hollowness of such interpretations of religious law had an unfortunate effect: they served the immediate interests of the priests but not the long-term interests of the masses. Introducing elements of superstition into the religious structure of the Hebrew state served the priests well, at first. They were not interested in maintaining the order of the state through a stable practice of religious rites which inspired devotion among the masses; rather, they ruled by introducing into the state practices that encouraged the very passions found in the state of nature. In fact, the power of superstition is such that it plays even more intensely on the hopes and fears of the individual than does religion, but without resolving them in the way religion does. Superstition, Spinoza argues, does not have any interest in allaying the fears of an individual; it does not seek to transform fear into devotion but uses this fear to maintain control of the state. 'Fear then, the reason why superstition arises, is preserved and is encouraged.'94 In this manner, instead of maintaining a stable set of laws, the Levites began to constantly increase them, 'determining everything by priestly authority and daily issuing, concerning ceremonies, the faith, and everything else, new decrees, which they wanted to be no less sacred and to have no less authority than the laws of Moses'.95 But the paradoxical effect of these decrees and the theological disputes that accompanied them was to undermine the faith of the masses in the religious order of the state. Since the epistemological ground of the priests' authority was ambiguous, and they had strayed from its proper domains, it was easy for others to dispute them. The signs that once had meant one thing could easily be twisted by the imagination of someone else to mean something different.96 The doubt that a few individuals had already displayed in the time of Moses grew unchecked under the rule of the Levites. In response, the priests only redoubled their attempt to manipulate the desires of the people, allowing 'great license' and agreeing to whatever the common people desired when fear Theological-Political Treatise, see the paper by Edwin Curley, 'Spinoza on Miracles', in Proceedings of the First Italian International Congress on Spinoza, ed. Emilia Giancotti (Naples, 1985). 93 'Indeed, [men who immoderately desire uncertain things] believe God rejects the wise and writes his decrees not in the mind, but in the entrails of animals, or that fools, madmen and birds foretell his decrees by divine inspiration and prompting' (TTP, Preface, 4; GIII/5). Hobbes also distinguishes between two senses of 'prophecy': (i) as God speaking to the people; and (ii) as prediction of future events (see Hobbes, Leviathan, Ch. 36, pp. 456-8). 94 TTP, Preface, 5; GIII/5. 95 TTP, XVIII, 8; GIII/221. 96 Compare this to what Spinoza says about the conflicting interpretations of 'uni versal ideas' in £p40sl and Metaphysical Thoughts, Part 1, ch. 1. These passages are quoted in notes 17 and 26, above.</page><page sequence="25">230 M.A. ROSENTHAL was not effective. The vacillation between hope and fear which had been endemic to the state of nature was reintroduced into the state by the very agents who had been appointed to preserve its stability. Thus weakened, the Hebrew state easily succumbed to the invasion of foreign armies. Once the mechanisms for inspiring devotion among the people had broken down or proven inefficacious, something else was needed to keep the people in check. If the state was to be reconstituted, the only possible solution was to introduce an earthly sovereign to rule the masses in conjunction with the priests; and that, as Spinoza tells us, is what the Hebrews did.98 This finally broke the political effectiveness of the covenant with God that Moses had instituted. If Moses' technique for ruling had been to gain the people's assent to his authority through the perpetuation of a fictive covenant with God, the technique of the kings was by necessity more direct — the threat of force. What had been a theocracy thus devolved into something resembling Hobbes's 'Leviathan'99 but with annoying and dangerous relics of the past regime still extant. The élite of the old order had survived and were content with their lot, but their successors were not and were continually trying to usurp command. The institution of the priesthood persisted and continued to treat the rights of the ruling authorities with disdain, looking always to re-establish its own prophetic rale. Thus, the Hebrew kings 'had a state within a state, and ruled precariously'.100 The pnnctiint ctrifp within thp ctatp hptwfpn thp nripctc anH thp lrinoc nmHiipprl conditions from which only tyranny could result.

Whether it accurately depicts and explains the events in the Old Testament is far less important than the use that Spinoza makes of it. On one level it appears simply to relate the narrative of the rise and fall of the ancient Hebrew state. On another level, this story proves to have a moral: the institutionalization of the priesthood leads to the state's corruption and collapse. Indeed, Spinoza writes that 'the more I consider this change [in the priesthood] the more it compels me to burst out in the words of Tacitus: at that time God's concern was not with their security, but with vengeance'.103 Going yet one level further, I think that this story is a political allegory which translates the awful mystery of 'God's vengeance' on the Hebrews into a meaningful philosophical point about politics. In other words, Spinoza wants to show that the imaginative means which are necessary to produce political community can just as easily cause its downfall. But all of these elements are buried in yet another level of significance, which is Spinoza' s use of the story itself as an exemplar. Spinoza is not only asking his readers to understand the underlying significance of the narrative of the Hebrew state, but exhorting others to regard it as an example to imitate. It is to this that we turn in the next section. The Hebrews and the Dutch What the prophets were to the ancient Hebrews, the Holy Scriptures were to the Dutch. It was for this cultural and historical reason that Spinoza chose the ancient Hebrews to be his example in the Theological-Political Treatise, and this is also what allows this example to function as an exemplar, or guide to action. On this score Spinoza followed his own advice: If someone wishes to teach some doctrine to a whole nation, not to mention the whole human race, and wishes it to be understood in every respect by everyone, he is bound to confirm his teaching solely by experience, and for the most part to accommodate his arguments and the definitions of things to be taught to the power of understanding of the common people, who form the greatest part of the human race.104 Just as an appeal to reason would not have been effective with the Hebrews, Spinoza thought that he must appeal to the experience of the Dutch if he was to persuade them of anything. But the 'experience' of a people is a broad and complex notion. As Simon Schama has so admirably shown, the seventeenth not in more danger from its own citizens than from its enemies, and where those who have command do not fear the former more than the latter' (TTP, XVII, 17; GIII/203-4).

See also TTP, XVII, 112; GIII/220: 'With this we see how Religion was introduced into the Hebrew state, and how its political authority could have been everlasting, if the just anger of the lawgiver had permitted it to stay the same. But because this could not happen, it had to perish in the end.' 104 TTP, V, 37; GIII/77.</page><page sequence="27">232 M.A. ROSENTHAL century Dutch saw themselves in the light of three important sets of historical narratives or myths: the story of their own heroic struggle against the Spanish, which retroactively assumed a strongly nationalist bent; the story of the Bata vians depicted in the writings of Tacitus (and other Roman historians) and drawn upon by Grotius (amongst others) to explain the ancient origins of the nation; and the story of the ancient Israelites.105 It is this last founding myth in which Spinoza is obviously interested in the Theological-Political Treatise}06 As we shall now see, his interpretation of the rise and fall of the Hebrew state is not just a random example of his political philosophy, but one chosen for νciy cuiicicic icaauiiô. ojjiuu/,α iiupcu ιυ uac nie ncuicwa lu anuw mai luiciaucc of opinion and belief was necessary for the welfare of the state. Although it would be far beyond the scope of this paper to explicate the full range of the meaning the story of the ancient Hebrews had for the seventeenth century Dutch, we can focus on the aspects most relevant to Spinoza by returning to the painting described in the introduction, Ferdinand Bol's 'Moses Descends from Sinai with the Ten Commandments', hanging in the Magis trates' Chamber (Schepenkamer) of the Amsterdam Town Hall. As the art historian Albert Blankert has pointed out, there are undoubtedly two reasons why this somewhat unusual subject was selected for such a prominent place.107 The first and more general one is that the Calvinist influence on the Dutch state at this time was strong, and from the earliest days of their sect the Calvinists 105 Simon Schama, The Embarrassment of Riches (Berkeley, 1988), Part 1, ch. 2, passim. Grotius' account of the Batavian origins of the Dutch Republic, which includes a description of their manners and mores, is Liber de AntiquitateRepublicae Β atavicorum (1610). Schama's list of national origin myths (what I would call 'exemplars') obviously should not be understood to exclude all other sources that may have contributed to the formation of Dutch character, political institutions and intellectual life in the 'Golden Age'.In his book, The Myth of Venice and Dutch Republican Thought in the Seventeenth Century (Assen, 1980), E.O.G. Haitsma-Mulier has stressed the importance of what he calls the 'myth of Venice' in Dutch thought during this time and discusses its influence on Spinoza via the work of Pieter de la Court. Although the influence of this myth may well have been felt in higher intellectual and political circles, it does not seem to have had equal resonance in popular political culture. So while Venice may have served Spinoza in a variety of ways, it was not useful to him as a common imaginative referent, an exemplum. That might explain why there are so few actual references to Venice in Spinoza's work, at least in the Theological-Political Treatise. 106 In several places Spinoza directly compares the situation of the Hebrews to that of the Netherlands — see, for instance, TTP, XVII, 54; GIII/210 — but I am claiming a far more extensive parallel than these explicit comparisons alone would justify. 107 According to Blankert this was only the second treatment of this subject by a Dutch master (the other one was by Rembrandt) and the first to be hung in a courtroom anywhere in Europe. See the English summary of Blankert's Kunst als regeringszaak, p. 65. What follows is based on this source; on Blankert's other monograph, Ferdinand Bol, pp. 50-1; and on Schama, The Embarrassment of Riches, pp. 116-25.</page><page sequence="28">WHY SPINOZA CHOSE THE HEBREWS 233 had identified with the exodus of the ancient Hebrews.108 The second, more specific reason has to do with the troubled relations between the Calvinist clergy and the Amsterdam government. Let us look first at the general reason why this painting was commissioned before we look at its specific place in debates of the time. We need to know how the Calvinist identification with the Israelites was adopted by the Dutch before we examine the struggle over its interpretation. The painter's use of this scene from Exodus to make his point was not a mere conceit or mannered allusion. By 1665 the Dutch had already repeatedly used the Old Testament to describe their own trials and tribulations, especially against the Spanish. In order to break the siege of Leiden by the Duke of Alva in 1574, William of Orange had taken the desperate measure of breaking the great dykes that protected the city and surrounding land from the ocean, with the result that the Spanish, panicked by the rising waters, had fled. Local historians and city fathers described this event in providential terms as the hand of God intervening on the side of his 'chosen people' against their oppressors, who were compared to the Midianites. The parallel with the trials of the ancient Israelites was not expressed in speeches alone: the chronicle of this event was recited thereafter during a commemorative meal with food (bread and herring) that was supposed to remind the celebrants of the Leiden citizens' heroic sacrifice and providential salvation.109 This 'commingling of scripture and historical chronicle' helped foster the emerging Dutch nation's sense of sepa rateness, creating a vision of destiny which transformed the profane events such as battles, trade, and even household chores, into the unfolding of a sacred plan.110 The Calvinist preachers produced a theology in which the Dutch 108 G. Groenhuis, in his article 'Calvinism and National Consciousness: The Dutch Republic as the New Israel' (in Britain and the Netherlands, Volume VII, ed. A.C. Duke and C.A. Tamse (The Hague, 1981), pp. 118-33) contests the view of some eminent Dutch historians (among them E.H. Kossman) who hold that, while the Calvinists frequently made the analogy with ancient Israel they did not see themselves as the 'inhabitants of a New Israel, as an elect nation'. See also Dr Groenhuis's work De Predikanten (Groningen, 1977) (with English summary), which Simon Schama draws upon. 109 Schama discusses this incident and its contemporary interpretation on pp. 26-7 of The Embarrassment of Riches. A fuller description of the military and political aspects of the siege can be found in Geoffrey Parker, The Dutch Revolt (Harmondsworth, 1988). Groenhuis also notes many instances of the use of biblical imagery in the struggles of the early Dutch republic, as well as seventeenth-century uses, such as the poet Joost van den Vondel's comparison, in his play HetPascha (The Passover), of the deliverance of the children of Israel with the liberation of the United Provinces (see Groenhuis, 'Calvinism and National Consciousness', pp. 120-1 and passim). 110 Schama, The Embarrassment of Riches, p. 103. He also points to the curious way in which the Dutch penchant for cleanliness, frequently noted by foreigners, was a 'militan[t]... affirmation of separateness': 'What was cleansed was the dirt of the world that had obscured the special meaning of Dutch history and the providential selection of its people' {ibid., p. 380).</page><page sequence="29">234 M.A. ROSENTHAL Republic was the 'New Canaan,' and they saw their own position 'as equal to the prophets of ancient Israel' .n 1 On this basis, the 'more demanding Calvinists ... attempted] to establish godly norms of social behaviour that were laid down as fitting for the new Chosen People. Conformity to these norms guaranteed perpetuation of the covenant; deviation from them, the downfall of the com monwealth.'112 In other words, both politicians and preachers constantly ex horted their people to 'right conduct' through the terms of this scriptural identification. Thus, close to a century after the events in Leiden, when Bol was commissioned to paint Moses for the town hall, and when Spinoza was com posing the Theological-Political Treatise, the identification with Israel had been well sown in the imaginative and moral landscape of the nation. The scriptural narrative of the ancient Hebrews, then, was exemplary for the Dutch in both structure and function: in structure, because it could appeal to the imagination of the individual in the guise of an end that appeared to have divine, and therefore universal significance; and in function, because it served to exhort people to act in relation to an 'objective' set of values and in prescribed ways. But even if the narrative of the Hebrews was exemplary for the Dutch, the precise sense in which it was exemplary was not always construed in the same way by all people. A particular exemplary figure, like Moses, could be identified with different messages, religious or political. The Catholic tradition viewed Moses as a "prophetic harbinger ot the messianic return , while the Dutch identified him at different times with William of Orange, the noble liberator, and with Oldenbameveld, the magistrate who was 'the first great patriot of the law' and a proponent of religious toleration.113 As we have seen, Spinoza argues that the philosophical basis of this variety in interpretation and use of an exemplar stems from its foundation in an inadequately conceived universal. So what appears to be universal really reflects some more particular interpretation of experience. The fact that the scriptures were 'revealed' hides their human origins. This is both an exemplar's strength and its weakness; that which allows it to appeal to a large group of people separated by different interests and ideas can itself be used in service of those different interests. It is certain that the Dutch drew upon the scriptural history of the Hebrews to understand and shape their own experience in a common way, but the possibil ity of more than one interpretation of this identification opened the way for conflict over the exemplary authority of one use or another of the universal idea (scripture) that was at its foundation. The image of Moses holding the tablets of the law that he brought down from the top of Mount Sinai was indisputably an image of authority for the Dutch nation in the seventeenth century, but it 'was when individual Dutch men and women tried to discern what exactly it 111 Groenhuis, De Predikanten, p. 183. 1,2 Schama, The Embarrassment of Riches, p. 381. 113 Ibid., pp. 112-13.</page><page sequence="30">WHY SPINOZA CHOSE THE HEBREWS 235 was that those tablets commanded .. . that the scriptural analogy began to lose clarity and coherence'.114 The dispute over who had the ultimate right to interpret scripture, and who had the authority to enforce its commands, was the specific reason behind the commission and conception of Ferdinand Bol's painting of Moses. In 1665, although the clergy was officially under the rule of the state's authority, nonetheless 'a bitter controversy arose on the issue of the primacy of the church or the state'.115 Since the revolt against the Spanish in the sixteenth-century the head of the House of Orange-Nassau had led the army and, for a good measure of that time, the country, through the office of the stadholder.116 But after the sudden death of William II in 1650, the States party, led by Jan de Witt, formed a republican government without a stadholder.117 The majority of the Calvinist clergy was stridently opposed to the government of the States party, not least because of the relative tolerance it showed to other religions.118 Although they bowed (voluntarily or forcibly) to the power of de Witt's government, none theless their natural and historical sympathies were with the Orangists.119 The Orangists in turn sought to use the clergy's influence over the populace to serve its own end, which was to re-establish itself at the head of the government. It is not surprising then to find the Calvinist clergy using Biblical analogies in r a.\- _ _j._ji__ij-.-_.l_ 190 Blankert argues that the Amsterdam burgomasters chose Bol's painting and specified the depiction of its subject-matter in order to counter the claims of the Calvinist clergy — and also by extension those of the Orangist party — and thereby strengthen their own position and that of the States party within Amsterdam.121 The painting stresses the role of Moses as Lawgiver and depicts his brother Aaron, the high priest, as subordinate to him and the Law.

'The relief as a whole', Blankert comments, 'served as a warning of the chaos that results when the leadership of the people falls into the hands of the clergy'.122 In addition, just in case the audience did not immediately grasp the visual evidence, a poem by Joost van den Vondel was also commissioned, apparently sometime before the painting itself was completed: The Hebrew Moses has received the Law from God, with which he returns from above to the people, who greet him reverently and welcome him eagerly. The free State begins to flourish when the people respect the laws.123 Using images drawn from the Old Testament, the town authorities hoped to make a statement to the clergy (in their own language) and to the populace about the proper order of the state.124 οριιιυζ,α, iikc jdui, cmpiiasizcu uic image ui iviuùcî» aî&gt; lawgivci uctauuc ne wanted to argue for the priority of the state in all matters, whether secular or religious. It is Moses as the prophetic founder of the state who was able to lead the people from the state of nature into civil society; and it is Moses as lawgiver who organized the state so that it would endure. But, as we saw in the previous section, the means by which Moses founded the state could easily be perverted by others for their own interests. This is precisely the point where Spinoza's analysis of the causes and effects of the corruption of religion into superstition 122 Blankert, Kunst als regeringszaak, p. 65. 123 Quoted in Katherine Fremantle, The Baroque Town Hall of Amsterdam (Utrecht, 1959), p. 77. It derives from a poem by Vondel published in 1659. Vondel himself had been a target of the Calvinist clergy in 1654 when his play Lucifer was banned (Schama, The Embarrassment of Riches, pp. 119-21). While Fremantle thinks that the poem was actually inscribed beneath the painting, both Buchbinder-Green (The Painted Decora tions of the Town Hall of Amsterdam, p. 153) and Blankert (Ferdinand Bol, p. 52) disagree. However, other expository poems by Vondel were inscribed under other paintings in the town hall; for example, under Van Helt Stocade's Joseph Distributing the Grain in Egypt, which was in the Treasury Room (Schoorsteenstuk) (Buchbinder Green, The Painted Decorations of the Town Hall of Amsterdam, p. 110). 124 It is worth noting that a few years before the Magistrates commissioned Bol's painting to assert their own authority over and against the Calvinist ministers, they had also commissioned for another part of the town hall a large painting of the Batavians, depicting Claudius Civilis who had led the Batavians in a revolt against the Romans. Claudius was readily identified with the first William of Orange who had led the Dutch in their revolt against the Spanish in the sixteenth century. The commission was a sign of respect made as a result of the re-emergence of the Orangist faction, who claimed the stadholderate for the young William of Orange, later to be William III. For a detailed discussion of this episode, see the article by Carroll, 'Civic Ideology and its Subversion', passim, and Blankert, Kunst als regeringszaak, p. 64. This example shows how different exemplars can be used in different (complementary and conflicting) ways at the same time.</page><page sequence="32">WHY SPINOZA CHOSE THE HEBREWS 237 on the Hebrew state is deeply related to his argument for toleration in the contemporary United Provinces. Spinoza bases his argument for toleration on the distinction between the proper and improper use of exemplary language (like prophecy or scripture) in the state. To see this let us go back to the preface of the Theological-Political Treatise where Spinoza tells the reader that he has a twofold purpose in writing the work. His overarching aim is, as he declares in the Preface, to show 'not only that... freedom [of opinion and worship] can be granted without harm to piety and the peace of the State, but also that it cannot be abolished unless piety and the Peace of the State are abolished with it'.125 But in order to achieve this end Spinoza thinks he must first 'indicate the main prejudices regarding relig ion, i.e. the traces of our former bondage, and then also the prejudices regarding the right of the supreme powers'.126 For '[m]any, with the most impudent licence, are eager to take away the greater part of that right, and to turn the heart of the masses (who are still liable to pagan superstition) away from the supreme powers, so tftat all may rush again into slavery'.'^' Spinoza intends to expose these prejudices and their causes through a thorough critique of Scripture, thereby undermining the position of those who seek to exploit the masses through the manipulation of superstitious beliefs. But under the political and social conditions of the United Provinces of his time, Spinoza did not think it was possible to deny any and all roles to religious belief and practice. As he writes: For everyone knows how highly the people value the right and authority regarding sacred matters, and how much everyone hangs on the utterances of the one who has it, so much so that we can rightly say that the person who has this authority has the most powerful control over their hearts.128 Given these conditions, Spinoza found it necessary to appeal to these religious beliefs and practices through his own interpretation. In this light, the use of the ancient Hebrews was not just an analogy or illustration of a theoretical point, but an exemplar, something to be imitated. Spinoza realized that the same underlying dynamics involved in Moses' appeal to revelation in the foundation of the state were at play in the Dutch identification with the scriptural narration of the Hebrews. If Moses called his people 'chosen' in order to exhort them to 'right' conduct, i.e. to conduct that would best maintain the state, then the Dutch Calvinist belief that their nation had been 'chosen' to endure and triumph over their travails could also be used to maintain a certain political order. But Spinoza also thought it imperative that the priestly caste, the Calvinist preachers, not be allowed to overstep the bounds of their proper role in the state. In this sense, 125 TTP, Preface, 12; GIII/7. 126 TTP, Preface, 13; GIII/7. 127 Ibid. 128 7TP, XIX, 40; GIII/235.</page><page sequence="33">238 M.A. ROSENTHAL the painting compresses the exemplary meaning of the narrative of the founding of the Hebrew state, as Spinoza has reconstructed it, in one highly symbolic moment: the priests must kneel below Moses, who embodies the proper relation of prophecy to the law. In other words, the right to interpret the law must be distinct from the right to enforce the law. Only under this constitutional arrange ment could the state persist. In the Netherlands of Spinoza's time, however, the priests threatened to cross this boundary, claiming that they had the right not only to interpret the law but also to enforce their interpretation of it.129 They pursued.this claim just as the ancient Levites had, not directly but indirectly through the establishment of a king whom they believed they would control. In the period during which the struggle between church and state, republicans and Orangists, was most intense, '[t]he idea of the Dutch Israel was given its most elaborate treatment' by Calvinist ministers for whom the 'State existed for the sake of the Church'.130 Moreover, the rhetorical strategy the Calvinists adopted to further their own ends was that of the 'relentless and foolish' theologians whom Spinoza had identified among the Levites of the young Hebrew nation: they claimed that their interpretation of the laws was identical with philosophical truth.131 Once in power, Spinoza believed, the theologians would attempt to suppress all interpretations of the law that differed from theirs; for to allow a diversity of beliefs would effectively undermine their very claim to power as exclusive arbiters of true knowledge and belief. But any such attempt would be illegiti mate, impractical and ill-advised: illegitimate, because each person has the natural right to maintain whatever idea or passion they have;132 impractical because it is impossible for any individual (or group of individuals) to control the minds of the multitude;133 and ill-advised, because the imposition of pro 129 Spinoza is not opposed to the various interpretations of scripture but only to the attempt by one sect to prohibit the interpretation of another (see TIP, XIV, 3; GIII/173). For earlier disputes, see D. Nobbs, Theocracy and Toleration. A Study of the Disputes in Dutch Calvinism from 1600-1650 (Cambridge, 1938). 130 Groenhuis, 'Calvinism and National Consciousness', pp. 122-3. The books Groenhuis discusses are: Abraham van de Velde, De Wonderen des Allerhoogsten (The Miracles of the Almighty), published in 1668, and Herman Witsius, De Twist des Heeren met syn Wyngaert (The Quarrel of the Lord with his Vineyard), published in 1669. 131 We see Spinoza's opposition to this attitude reflected in the correspondence Spinoza had with Willem van Blijenbergh who, although himself not a Calvinist priest, believed that when the truths of reason and revelation were in conflict, the truth of revelation superseded that of reason. See letter 20, in The Collected Works of Spinoza, especially pp. 361-2 (GIV/97-8), and Spinoza's reply, letter 21, pp. 375 ff. (GIV/126f.). 132 '. . . it cannot happen that a mind should be absolutely subject to the control of someone else.

What Spinoza did in the Theological Political Treatise, just as Bol attempted to do in his painting, was remind interested parties of this fact. The toleration of belief and ideas, if not of action, was central to the maintenance of the social contract. Obviously, Spinoza was reading contemporary Dutch concerns back into the scriptures. He was not concerned with the 'historical truth' of the scriptures, even if one were available,135 but only with the use of its contents for his own purposes. Like others who came before him in the tradition of writers who employed the rhetoric of exemplarity, Spinoza felt free to pick and choose from own point.136 But this is entirely consistent with his aim in the Theological Political Treatise: if we are talking about politics then we do not appeal primarily to reason but to experience, which is constituted through the imagi nation and memory. In other words, we must use exemplary language. Spinoza starts with an imaginative universal, the scriptures, that has an important political and cultural function in Dutch society, and gives his own interpretation of it, one which he believes is consistent with its function: the preservation of a stable state. Of course, Spinoza could hardly have foreseen the traumatic overthrow of the States party by the Orangists at the time of the French invasion, two years after the Theological-Political Treatise was published in 1670.137 But it about that men do not make their own judgment about everything, according to their own mentality, and that they are not, to that extent, affected with this or that affect' (TTP, XX, 6; GIII/240). 134 'That is why rule over minds is considered violent, and why the supreme authority seems to wrong its subjects and to usurp their rights whenever it wants to prescribe to each person what he must embrace as true and what reject as false, and further, by what opinions each person's mind ought to be moved in its devotion to God. For these things are subject to each person's control, which no one can surrender even if he wishes to' (TTP, XX, 3; GIII/239). 135 This is still a vexed question in modern scholarship of the Old Testament. The narrative accounts of events were themselves probably reconstructed for a religious purpose. Thus we have an interpretation of an interpretation, ad infinitum. For more on this question, see the anthology edited by Ronald E. Clements, The World of Ancient Israel: Sociological, Anthropological and Political Perspectives (Cambridge, 1991). 136 See TTP, V, 41-2; GIII/78. On the necessity for selection in an exemplar, see Lyons, Exemplum, introduction. As Lyons points out, the etymology of both exemplar and exemplum is in the terms excisio, which means 'to cut out'. 137 For a vivid account of the political events leading up to the debacle, in which the De Witt brothers, leaders of the States party, were brutally murdered by a mob, see Rowen, John De Witt, Chs. 11 and 12. This occasion also gave rise to the story, probably</page><page sequence="35">240 M.A. ROSENTHAL at the time he was writing the Theological-Political Treatise there is no doubt that he believed it imperative to intervene and to try to persuade people of the dangers involved in the Calvinists' misuse of prophetic language, not only for philosophers but for all citizens of the republican state. Conclusion: The Hebrews, Spinoza and Us As prophecy was for the ancient Hebrews, or the scriptures for the Dutch, Spinoza's Theological-Political Treatise is to the contemporary political theo rist: an exemplar. We have seen that, in his analysis of the Hebrew state, Spinoza argues that prophecy (i.e. revelation) was the means by which Moses was able to persuade individuals led by their passions and self-interest that they should join together into a state governed by a single rule of law. We have also seen that Spinoza chose the example of the ancient Hebrews for the Theological Political Treatise oreciselv because the seventeenth-centurv Dutch saw them selves as the 'new Israel'. In both these cases, the notion of 'chosenness' played an important role in the construction of an exemplar. The prophets and preach ers used this idea because it effectively appealed to individuals to see them selves within a divine plan, whose realization depended upon their actions. Both prophecy and scripture, then, are exemplars in the sense Spinoza defined it in the Ethics: imaginative universale that function to create a standard on the basis of which value can be defined and right conduct urged. What I hope to have shown in the preceeding discussion is that exemplars play as important a role in politics as they do in ethics. But there is one further point I would like to make in conclusion. From the very first sentence of the Theological-Political Treatise, Spinoza emphasizes that the power of reason over human affairs is limited. Over and over he argues that most people are ruled by their passions and best appealed to through the imagination, thus, it a person wants to convince another ot something, then he or she 'should not connect his arguments or give definitions ... Otherwise he will write only for the learned, i.e. he will be intelligible only to a few men compared with the others'.138 Rather, he must accommodate his arguments to the understanding and experience of the common people through the use of narratives that appeal to the imagination.139 This does not mean, of course, that reason has no role in politics. Reason teaches that society is the best means to preserve individual existence, and it shows us ways to improve society apocryphal, that Spinoza, so incensed at the death of the two politicians, attempted to confront the mob with a sign reading 'Ultimi barbarorum' (you are the worst of barbarians) and had to be restrained by his landlord who prudently feared for the philosopher's life (see ibid., p. 220). 138 TTP, V, 37; GIII/77. 139 Ibid, (quoted above) and TTP, V, 38-9. For further discussion of accommodation as a hermeneutical principle, see Brown, 'Philosophy and Prophecy', pp. 202-5.</page><page sequence="36">WHY SPINOZA CHOSE THE HEBREWS 241 for that end.140 Moreover, it is an insight of reason, and amply demonstrated by experience, that people cannot escape being influenced by the passions and the imagination.141 But although reason teaches important principles about politics, it cannot itself solve the pre-eminent political problem: how to con vince men led by their passions that their interests are best served in society. In order to do that, the theorist, as well as the politician, must appeal to the imagination to address the very passions and interests that dominate most people's lives. The same principles that apply in the creation of political society through prophecy thus apply to its interpretation. It is necessary to use exam ples, like that of the Hebrews, not just to prove theoretical points but to exhort people to act in a certain way. In contemporary language, we could say that Spinoza was well aware of the 'performative' dimension of political discourse. He did not choose the Hebrews merely because they were an appropriate example for his theory, but because they already functioned as an exemplar, as a model that oueht to be imitated. In the intemretation of this nartirnlar exemplar he is himself trying to govern its meaning and use in political life. Spinoza chose to analyse the Hebrews because of the cultural resonance of scripture in seventeenth-century Dutch society. We choose to analyse Spinoza's work because it has some resonance in some small part of our own society, among academics and other 'learned men'. But if we wish to seriously address the problem Spinoza did, if we intend to use Spinoza's Theological-Political Treatise in our time as he intended it to be used in his, not just as an example to be used in intellectual discussion, but as an exemplar to imitate in the service of establishing a free and tolerant political order, then we must look to the Hebrews, and ask ourselves what imaginative notions lie at the foundations of our own society and how we ought to interpret them.

COLLEGE 140 TTP, III, 14; Gni/47. 141 In the Ethics, Spinoza argues that 'man is necessarily always subject to the passions, that he follows and obeys the common order of Nature, and accommodates himself to it as much as the nature of things requires' (E4p4c).</page></plain_text>
