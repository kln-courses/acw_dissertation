<plain_text><page sequence="1">DICKRAN TASHJIAN, Skyscraper Primitives: Dada and the American Avantgarde, 1910-1925, Middleton, Conn., Wesleyan University Press, 1975. Pp. 283; 94 ills. $20 Dada, as is pointed out in all the anthologies, was officially institutionalized at the Caf6 Voltaire in Zurich in 1916 by the Rumanian poet Tristan Tzara, the writers Hugo Ball and Richard Huelsenbeck, and the Alsatian painter-sculptor Hans Arp. Until the 1920's, usually under the name Dada but sometimes not, these people and their peers staged shocking demon- strations, featuring wildly nonsensical recitations, before audiences in Zurich, Paris, Berlin, and to a lesser degree New York; and Max Ernst, Hans Arp, Kurt Schwitters, George Grosz, and others produced an art of what was then a perversely iconoclastic nature. As is widely argued, the disillusionment born with World War I set the proper mood. In Sky- scraper Primitives, Tashjian treats manifestations of Dadaism in the art produced in New York, showing that aspects of the work of Charles Demuth, Arthur G. Dove, Joseph Stella, John Covert, Man Ray, Morton Schamberg, and even Charles Sheeler and Stuart Davis took on a Dada coloration, though none of these artists or contemporary critics used the term "Dada" in discussing their work. Tashjian quite correctly presents the European emigre's Francis Picabia and Marcel Duchamp, who arrived in New York before the official beginnings of Dadaism, as the instigators, the founding fathers, so to speak: at times some of the Americans adopted specific aspects of the work of these two men. More often their in- spirational example as conceptual artists counted most. Although the Ameri- can contribution to the art of international Dadaism has been covered be- fore, well though briefly by William Agee and John Tancock, Tashjian is the first, I believe, to juxtapose the art of these Americans with the contemporary Dadaist spirit in literature (again not officially designated as Dadaist during the period). He covers the work of major and minor critics, essayists, and poets-giving special attention to the poetry of E. E. Cummings, Hart Crane, and William Carlos Williams and writers for the underground and little magazines, Camera Work, The Soil, Contact, The Little Review, Broom, Secession, The Guardian, and others. Tashjian took his very title, we learn finally on page 132, from an article in the first issue of The Guardian, in which Gorham Munson describes Richard Coady, the publisher of The Soil and supporter of writings on the aesthetic qualities of the machine and such inadequately treated material as sport, jazz, and Indian artifacts, as a "skyscraper primitive." Munson, writing in the last year of Tashjian's period, predicted that "we are in the childhood of a new age" and lamented that the late Richard Coady "would have become a leader for Young America. Like Guillaume Apollinaire in France, Coady in America was the first spokesman of certain new impulses and his death, like Apollinaire's death, deprived the oncoming movement of a direc- tive stand." Wonderfully and richly textured, Skyscraper Primitives is invaluable in presenting the full cast of characters who made up a particular approach in America, the main actors and such hangers-on as Elsa Baroness von Freytag-Loringhoven, supposed to have had a tempestuous affair with William Carlos Williams, and Arthur Cravan, the self-styled "World Champion at the Whorehouse" who fought the boxing champion Jack John- son and also got himself arrested by stripping at the American Inde- pendents Exhibition in March of 1917. Tashjian's premise of the existence of a Dadaist kind of consciousness in America is viable and useful, and he succeeds in recreating the ambience that expressed that consciousness; nevertheless, his choice of examples is sometimes questionable, his research sometimes faulty, and his style of writing frequently turgid, tortuous, and overworked. Nor does Tashjian ever define the limits or parameters of the style in art and literature that is his subject; he simply asserts that a painting, poem or essay is Dadaist or that one is more Dadaist than another, as though he were dealing with something immediately and uni- versally recognizable and easily quantifiable. The first three and last two chapters, dealing with the visual material, contain the best work. In the other chapters, on literature, Tashjian often beats his point to death; worse, he finds manifestations of Dadaism where none exist or designates as Dada anything unusual or inventive. He quotes William Carlos Williams: "I didn't originate Dadaism but I had it in my soul to write it. Spring and All [twenty-seven poems interspersed with thirteen prose sections] shows that." Because Williams disordered the chapters numerically, Tashjian comes to the heady conclusion that "this disorder functions primarily to suggest the destructive chaos of creation- a Dada insight" (p. 104). Williams himself insisted that the disorder made fun of typographical arrangements, but Tashjian takes this explanation as proof that Williams was "spoofing Dada itself." Some of Dada was vehemently nihilistic, and a bit of what came under the aegis of the European move- ment was simply cleverly playful. By not making distinctions between these various moods and overtones, Tashjian seduces the reader into assuming that Dada was just one single thing-a thing that in the end is amorphous and without substance. Tashjian's comparisons between art and literature are usually forced and sometimes downright ridiculous. He compares the wheel- barrow of William's poem "Little Red Wheelbarrow" (Spring and AU) with Duchamp's Readymades because Williams transposed it into language through accurate, concise description; this, to Tashjian, means a Ready-</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 313 made transposed into language, "because the fact has no need of the word, and the word in turn becomes free and dynamic in its precise attachment and identification with the fact" (p. 108). Eager to fit every- one he can into an undefined Dadaist mold, Tashjian designates writers who accept the machine wholeheartedly, like Matthew Josephson, editor of the underground magazine Broom, as issuing "self-projected Dada atti- tudes." Tashjian equates Josephson's positive acceptance of the machine, symptomatic of a new order, with De Zayas's nihilism and Picabia's anthro- pomorphization of the machine, although the attitudes here are worlds apart. Quoting Josephson's statements liberally, Tashjian, remarkably, seems unaware of their meaning, as, for example, of this one of 1922, quoted in the very paragraph that compares Josephson with De Zayas and Picabia: "The machine is not 'flattening us out' nor 'crushing us!'. . . The machine is our magnificent slave, our fraternal genius. We are a new and hardier race, friend to the sky-scraper and the subterranean railway as well" (p. 128). Despite all this, Tashjian has culled quotations that deal with America's attitudes toward European Dadaism and other matters that cannot be found as a body elsewhere in any book on American art of the early 20th century. These sections are invaluable, although Tashjian's conclusions and comments must often be taken lightly. The material shows that at the time con- temporary commentators saw America as even surpassing Dada, without realizing that the European sense of malaise in Dada offered something that America could not then assume. Edmund Wilson, deploring the current American urban environment in Vanity Fair in February, 1922, observed that the electric signs in Times Square made the Dadaists look timid. For him, Times Square was "the masterpiece of Dadaism"; it was "pro- duced naturally by our race and without premeditation which makes your own horrors self-conscious. . ." Along with misreadings, sometimes Tashjian hits the mark in his comparisons between art and literature, America and Europe. For example, he provocatively compares the poetry of E. E. Cummings, who, predictably, is seen as a foreshadower of the dynamics of Dada, with the abstract poetry of the German Dadaist Richard Huelsen- beck (who eventually became a New York psychoanalyst) and the so-called optophonetic poems of the Berlin Dadaist Raoul Hausmann. Hausmann, as did Cummings, varied the sizes of letters and calculated their placement on the page to add a visual dimension to the poem. Tashjian admits that no evidence shows that Cummings ever saw or heard a Hausmann poem. The similarities, however, remain, indicating that the same literary phenomenon sprang up independently in different places at the same time. In Chapter Nine, "The Art of Assemblage," Tashjian discusses the paintings and assemblages of Covert, the collages of Stella, which can hardly be called assemblages, and the assemblages of Dove. Here there are shocking errors, misrepresenting facts and misappraising an artist's accomplishments. No one is more brutalized than John Covert. Tashjian states that only five works of Covert survive (p. 189), a painful mistake because, aside from those scattered in public and private collections, the Yale University Art Gallery and the Seattle Art Museum alone contain fifteen. Tashjian then condemns Covert for possessing an irony not informed "by a well developed point of view." The criticisms, whether or not justified, are so ephemeral that they obfuscate rather than clarify issues. We are told, for example, that the "Brass Band and Vocalization, . . . de- spite their wit, are predominately sensuous in their treatment of materials." This is a dark utterance, for it may mean that they do not have enough wit for what they are trying to do, that wit opposes sensuousness, that the works are too sensuous, or maybe something else, all this without explain- ing what about them is sensuous or witty. Tashjian makes no concerted at- tempt to discover just how Vocalization offers a visual analogy to sound or why an assemblage of upholstery tacks is entitled Time; that is, he does not define the link between the concept and the realization of the assemblage. Equally disturbing is the sloppy treatment given Duchamp, who as the high priest, as it were, of the Arensberg group, did influence some Americans, like Covert, who were inclined toward a conceptual sort of art. Because Tashjian is most familiar with the Large Glass, he assumes that this work must always have been the connecting link. In Covert's work, traces of various versions of Nude Descending a Staircase can be found; the Large Glass, however, was not completed until 1923, whereas Covert's constructions were made in 1919. In a passage on Man Ray, Tashjian writes that Man Ray was aware of the Large Glass because the discursive title of his great painting of that year, The Rope Dancer Accompanies Herself with Her Shadows, is supposed to echo, presumably in sound, the rhythm of the full title of the Large Glass: The Bride Stripped Bare By Her Bachelors, Even. This is wild, for Duchamp's work did not exist in 1916 and the title, when Duchamp did make it up, was in French. Impossible or highly unlikely precedents are also postulated for Stella's collages of ca. 1918 to 1923. First Tashjian suggests the Readymades of Duchamp because, like the collages of worn bits of paper and cloth, the Ready- mades involve common objects (p. 193). Secondly, Tashjian suggests sources in advertisements, corresponding to Josephson's urging that advertise- ments be a source for the artist; but in Collage No. 3, Chiclets, which Tashjian cites as evidence for the influence of advertising, the brand name on the Chiclets wrapper is practically rubbed out. Tashjian is prob- ably correct, however, in claiming Schwitters's Merzbilder, collages of scraps of paper and discarded tickets, as a possible source: Merzbilder had been included in group shows at the Societe Anonyme in November, 1920, and March, 1921. One suspects that Tashjian has not seen the works he discusses, or at least has not looked at them closely. No one can deny that Dove's Grandmother of 1925 (New York, Museum of Modem Art) is one if not the most beautiful of the collages made by any early American modernist; yet Tashjian dismisses it in a phrase, along with Miss Woolworth, which is probably the worst of the collages, as having cloying overtones (p. 201). Covert, Stella, Dove, and the other American artists appearing in Skyscraper Primitives all either habitually congregated or appeared occasionally at Walter Arensberg's apartment on West 67th Street in Manhattan. From 1914 to 1923 this served as the only Dadaist salon in America, a place that, along with Stieglitz's 291, was an instrumental center in the development of the avant-garde impulse in America following the Armory Show. Arensberg brought the artists together, gave them a place to gather, and commissioned several works. In addition, he composed Dadaist poems, wrote an American Dadaist manifesto, and sponsored New York's three Dada magazines, the short-lived The Blind Man, and the single issues of Rongwrong and New York Dada. Next to the artists, Arensberg was the single most important figure in early American modemism's conceptual contingent. He might have been given an entire chapter but certainly should have been given several long passages. Yet Arensberg is never mentioned on two consecutive pages: he flits through the book as an insubstantial phantom by means of vague references to the Arensberg circle; the only definite thing said is that he bailed out Cravan after he had been arrested for stripping at the Independents Exhibition. Tashjian ought at least to have consulted Fiske Kimball's "Cubism and the Arensbergs" (Art News Annual, xxi, 1955). In Chapter Ten, "Painting the Machine," Tashjian devotes a strong section to Morton Schamberg, whose machine paintings have been assumed by Milton Brown (American Painting from the Armory Show to the De- pression, Princeton, 1955) and other writers to lack the overtones of anthropomorphism found in Duchamp's and Picabia's renderings of machines and machine parts. Brown observed that "Schamberg, like the majority of Americans . . . , lacked the complex esthetic mentality and was seemingly unaffected by the involuted philosophies of his European contemporaries" (Brown, p. 117). Tashjian, however, correctly emphasizes the phallic aspects of Schamberg's oil of 1916, The Well, which was probably in- spired by Picabia's machine portraits of one year earlier. Tashjian is the first to observe that Demuth may have gone to Duchamp not only for en- couragement for his own conceptual leanings but for specific formal sources; the fractured surfaces made up of the ray lines in Demuth's industrial land- scapes could have been derived from similar textures in the Large Glass. Yet it would be more correct to assume that the sources were pieces later in- corporated in the Large Glass, for the related devices occur in Demuth's work as early as 1917; one should note the source could also have been the dislocations observed in paintings of C&amp;zanne. Nevertheless Tashjian has made an important point to be considered by students of Demuth, one not brought up by his scholars such as Ritchie and Famham. Unfortunately, Tashjian discusses only one of Demuth's seven Poster Portraits, the portrait of William Carlos Williams known after one of his poems as I Saw the Figure Five in Gold; since none of the others are even mentioned, one can only hope that Tashjian knows of them. They are probably the most important grouping of works of a conceptual nature done within early American modernism, and they would have fit in nicely with Dove's portrait- constructions. Tashjian might argue that the chapter headings got in the way, for the Posters, except for the Williams piece, neither incorporate machines, the subject of Chapter Ten, nor the act of assemblage, the subject of Chapter Nine. Still, to have omitted them entirely is inexcusable.</page><page sequence="3">314 THE ART BULLETIN The one clear-cut statement on the death of art to appear in America between 1910 and 1925 was formulated by the Mexican caricaturist and theorist Marius De Zayas; his polemical essays appeared in Camera Work between 1910 and 1915. In 1912, De Zayas proclaimed in "The Sun Has Set" that "art, which is striving toward the Ideal, has succumbed to Industry, which is striving for the Real." In Tashjian's first chapter, "Camera Work and the Anti-Art of Photography," he establishes that during the first two decades of this century photography was generally seen as some- thing different from art; it was, as the critic Charles H. Caffin put it, a scientific process (p. 17). Even Stieglitz's work was seen as straight photography: it established facts and so could not be evaluated as art. Yet for De Zayas only photography offered a way out of the inevitable destructive process: as a fact-producing means of representation, photography alone had a place in a fact-oriented culture. In 1913, in an essay simply called "Photography," De Zayas argued that: "In order fully and correctly to appreciate the reality of Form, it is necessary to get into a state of perfect consciousness. The reality of Form can only be transcribed through a mechanical process, in which the craftsmanship of man does not enter as a principal factor. There is no other process to accomplish this than photography." The anti-art positions of De Zayas and the critic-poet Benjamin de Casseres make a suitable introduction for the analyses that follow in Tashjian's second and third chapters, "291 and Francis Picabia" and "Marcel Du- champ and Man Ray." Thereafter the organization of the book clouds the issues. Because one could plausibly argue that to some extent a part of the work of all the artists in the Arensberg group derives from Picabia and Duchamp, that work ought to be discussed immediately after Picabia and Duchamp; instead it is relegated to Chapters Nine and Ten. The intervening chapters (Four to Eight) are devoted to the analogies between literature and Picabia, Duchamp, and the Arensberg artists; and at best the material is forced and strained. This material on the literature ought to have been dovetailed with the discussions on the works of art or inserted as a block afterwards. As it is, the occurrence of the literary material between that of Duchamp-Picabia and the art of the Arensberg group is unfortunate and adventitious, dissipating the carrying force in the observa- tions on the works of art.
