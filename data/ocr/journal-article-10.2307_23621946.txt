<plain_text><page sequence="1">ENGLISH SUMMARIES OF THE HEBREW SECTION MILITARY ARCHITECTURE ALONG THE 'WAYS OF HORUS' — EGYPTIAN RELIEFS AND ARCHAEOLOGICAL EVIDENCE BY E.D. Oren and J. Shereshevski (pp. 8-22) The relief on the north wall of the great Hypostyle Hall in the temple of Amon at Karnak illustrates a series of forts and water stations along the 'Ways of Horus' in northern Sinai. This record testifies to the high level of Egyptian military organization along its major artery of communi cation with Asia. The reliability of the architectural detail of the fortified structures in the Karnak reliefs has, however, long been the subject of scholarly controversy. The present study examines the numerous representa tions of military architecture in Egyptian New Kingdom monuments and compares them to the archaeological record from Egypt, Nubia, North Sinai and Canaan in order to determine, in Sir Alan Gardiner's words, "whether the artist (of the Karnak relief) was endeavoring to record actual facts or whether he was merely indulging his individual fancy". The stylistic analysis of the relief indicates that this unique cartographic record represents accurately, and in correct sequence and compass orientation, the main components of Egypt's military organization in northern Sinai, i.e. small Migdol forts, large fortified towns on the Canaanite terminus, the major staging station of Sile and the frontier canal on the edge of the eastern Nile Delta. The study of Egyptian reliefs and archaeological remains shows that the Migdol fort was designed specifically for the Egyptian military organization in border zones and along strategically important roads such as the 'Ways of Horus'. The Karnak relief probably commemorated the establishment of the military complex along the 'Ways of Horas' and perhaps also the excavation of the sweet water canal on the edge of the Nile Delta. TEMPLE MODELS AND THEIR SYMBOLISM by Claire Epstein (pp. 23-30) During the excavation of the Orthostat Temple at Hazor, a 'house-shapecT vessel came to light in the Holy of Holies (111. 1) dating to the Late Bronze Age. A review of cultic traditions current for centuries in the ancient Near East shows that symbols which were originally the pal pable expression of widely-held beliefs and thought to be imbued with a special potency, continued in use long after their initial meaning had become lost. In the course of time many symbols came to be used as decorative elements customarily associated with cultic objects. This is well illustrated by the recurrent use of accepted sym bols on models of temples and shrines from different periods and provenance in Mesopotamia and the Levant, many of them found in a temple context. In early Mesopotamia a monumental doorway flanked by a ringed gate-post symbol was widely recognized as a temple (Ills. 2, 3). Later, a similar connotation was implied by the representation of two non-functional pil lars, one on either side of a doorway, above which a pediment was frequently indicated. Even when highly stylized, the indication of no more than one or two such symbols sufficed to associated an artefact with a temple or shrine. Other emblems were also in use, among them the attributes of the deity worshipped, whose figure was sometimes shown within the shrine. Among the cultic elements which, after a considerable interval, came to be used on representations of temples and shrines, is a circular symbol, known from fourth millennium BCE contexts. From the late third millennium onwards it occurs in different periods in widely separated geograph ical regions in the form of clay bosses placed around a shrine doorway (Ills. 5,6, 7,8), as a circular disc c"owning the shafts of engaged pillars flanking a doorway (Ills. 11, 12) or as the top-most feature on a vase-shaped receptacle (111. 17). At the end of the Late Bronze Age, shrine models fashioned in the technique used for ceramic vessels came to light at three separate sites (Ills. 1, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18). In contrast to models featuring a large open doorway, the above examples were clearly intended as receptacles, being furnished with a clay door which could be closed. The nature of their contents remains unknown, but since they exhibit accepted stylized cultic and architectural features, they may have been part of the ritual furniture used in the practice of the cult. Alternatively, they may have served as containers in which treasured objects were kept for safety, or 'cages' in which were housed the sacred temple snakes, as suggested by Yadin, who recalls the</page><page sequence="2">194* ENGLISH SUMMARIES entwined snake motif depicted above the opening on a model from Ugarit (111. 18). The Hazor 'shrine-house' (111. 1), with its high pedi ment rising above the opening, falls into place along with a varied range of temple models which, in one form or another, continued in use for millennia, while later ver sions incorporating a similar range of symbols and archi tectural features are known from the Iron Age. NEW LIGHT ON THE RELATIONS BETWEEN EGYPT AND SOUTHERN PALESTINE DURING THE EARLY BRONZE AGE by A. Ben-Tor (pp. 31-36) There is a general consensus among scholars that there was some degree of Egyptian involvement in Canaan in EBI. Opinions differ, however, with regard to the nature of this involvement (military occupation? commerce?) and its chronological and geographical scope. A thorough examination of the ceramic material un earthed at Tel 'Erani conducted by Baruch Brandl, iden tified more than 1000 Egyptian vessels, mostly from the nine EBI strata, comprising more than 50 types belonging to nine families of Pre-Dynastic Egyptian pottery. A petrographic analysis of this material by Naomi Porat, indicated the existence of three clearly defined groups: a) local Canaanite ware, b) Egyptian imported ware, c)'Egyptian' locally made ware; groups b and c belong typologically to the Egyptian ceramic repertoire. Side by side with the local Canaanite potters, Egyptian potters appear to have been working in southern Pales tine ('Erani, 'En Besor and other sites) producing pottery in the Egyptian and formal technological tradition, using a specific kind of local clay. A study of the 'Erani lithic assemblage by Steven Rosen came up with very similar results. Three groups of flint tools were discerned: local tools, Egyptian imported tools (the minority) and 'Egyptian' locally made tools. The latter are typologically Egyptian, but are made of a local flint different from the material used by local craftsmen. Sickle blades constitute a high percentage of the local 'Egyptian' lithic assemblage, while arrowheads are en tirely absent. The more than 60 seal-impressions of Egyptian style discovered at 'En Besor clearly belong to a well-known Egyptian group of similar stamped clay sealings and bullae, represented in Egypt by hundreds of examples. These are an integral part of the Egyptian system of tax collection in kind, and the storage and distribution of the produce by Egyptian officials. The petrographic analysis of some of the 'En Besor bullae by Naomi Porat produced a surprising result: they were not sent from Egypt, but were locally made of a clay almost identical with that of the local 'Egyptian' ceramics and with the material used for making the bricks for the construction of Building A at 'En Besor. The 'En Besor bullae thus belong, together with the local 'Egyptian' ceramic and flint industries, to a growing group of artifacts produced locally in southern Palestine in the Egyptian tradition and style. The 'En Besor bullae belong typologically to a group of bullae well known from Egypt. Yet the clay of these bullae is local, and they seem to have been stamped with locally made seals, which have not survived as they were prob ably made of wood. The signs are clearly Egyptian, and almost all of them have clear parallels in sealings found in Egypt, but their execution is sloppy in a way unparalleled in Egypt. Many of the combinations of signs typical of the Egyptian sealings are absent at 'En Besor, while several of the signs at 'En Besor have no parallels in the Egyptian corpus of seal impressions. Thus the seals used at 'En Besor must have been locally manufactured in the Egyp tian tradition. While they show a distinct 'family resem blance' to their Egyptian counterparts, they are clearly not identical. Were the 'En Besor receptacles which were sealed there destined to be sent to Egypt? No petrographic data for the sealings and bullae unearthed in Egypt are available, but stylistic comparison indicates that among the hundreds of sealings and bullae known from Egypt, not a single one resembles any of the 'En Besor bullae! Therefore it appears that the sealing of the agricultural products, and their storage in the Egyptian administra tive building at 'En Besor, shows that the goods were intended for local consumption. We are perhaps looking at an imitation of Egyptian administrative practices by the Egyptian population of 'En Besor and its vicinity, in an attempt to run their affairs just 'as things are done back home in Egypt'. THE SETTLEMENTS IN THE 'EN BESOR OASIS DURING EARLY BRONZE I by R. Gophna (pp. 37-43) Excavations were undertaken during 1976 and 1979 respectively at Site H and at the 'En Besor sites, north and south of the 'En Besor oasis in the northwestern Negev. The results have clarified the history of settlement near the 'En Besor springs during EB I, as well as the connections between the oasis and Egypt during the Naqada II-III periods and the beginning of the First Dynasty. The EB la settlement at Site H now appears to have been the southernmost of the settlements in southern Canaan at the very beginning of the Early Bronze Age. Its material culture demonstrates close affinities with the</page><page sequence="3">ENGLISH SUMMARIES 195* culture characteristic of Lower Egypt at the end of the Predynastic period. Following the abandonment of Site H, a new settle ment, the 'En Besor site (Stratum IV), was established in the 'En Besor oasis south of the springs. The Stratum IV pottery is dated to EB lb; it does not include Egyptian pottery, indicating a break in contacts with Egypt during this early phase. Since most scholars now tend to date Stratum III at this site also to EB lb — and not to EB II as was formerly suggested — this would place the establish ment of the royal Egyptian staging post at the site some time during the early First Dynasty and shortly after the destruction of the Stratum IV Canaanite settlement. Contacts between Site H and the Eastern Delta had probably already taken place before the massive penetra tion of the Upper Egyptian Naqada II culture into Lower Egypt. The settlement history at the 'En Besor site (Strata IV-III) may indicate that the Egyptian staging post (Stra tum III) was established during, or shortly after, the peak of the diffusion of the Naqada III culture in Lower Egypt, when the process of the unification of Egypt had already been completed (end of Dynasty O). The history of the settlements in the 'En Besor oasis during EBI reflects the fluctuating sequence of con nections between Canaan and Egypt in the period extend ing from late Predynastic times to the threshold of the Dynastic Age. THE EGYPTIAN MIDDLE KINGDOM SYSTEM FOR WRITING FOREIGN NAMES AND THE BEGINNING OF THE WEST-SEMITIC ALPHABET by B. Sass (pp. 44-50) The quasi-alphabetic system of writing foreign words in Egypt has its origins in the Old Kingdom and is best documented in the Execration Texts. Elements of'group writing' or syllabic writing made their first appearance at that time (Middle Kingdom) and continued to develop until, towards the New Kingdom, a system emerged which according to some scholars, is comparable to cuneiform in the notation of vowels. The subject is discussed here for its possible influence on the genesis of the Northwest-Semitic alphabet. It can probably be con eluded that if such an influence existed, it must have been exerted during the quasi-alphabetic stage of the Middle Kingdom, and this lends further support to a Middle Kingdom date of the Proto-Sinaitic inscriptions. THE POLITICAL STATUS OF MEGIDDO VII A by I. Singer (pp. 51-57) The hoard of ivories and other valuables discovered in the 'treasuiy of the newly-built palace of Stratum VIIA contains several items which indicate that this exception ally rich and diversified collection was owned by the Egyptian administrators stationed at Megiddo. These include the pen-case of the governor Thutmose (also known from Beth-Shan), the plaques of the songstress Krkr and the Hittite panel, which must have reached Megiddo in the context of the Hittite-Egyptian diplo matic contacts after 1258 BCE. The bronze base of the statue of Ramses VI, probably erected in a temple, leads to the same conclusion, namely, that sometime in the second half of the 13th century BCE or in the first half of the 12th, the Canaanite city-state of Megiddo was turned into an important Egyptian governmental centre, in con formity with the overall Egyptian policy in Canaan in the Ramesside period. FEATURES OF SETTLEMENT IN THE NORTHERN SHEPHELAH DURING MB AND LB IN THE LIGHT OF THE EXCAVATIONS AT TEL BATASH AND GEZER by A. Mazar (pp. 58-67) Eleven seasons of excavations at Tel Batash under the direction of G.L. Keim and the author provided ample data concerning the history of this site during the Middle and Late Bronze Ages. These data are examined in the paper in the light of the results of excavations and surveys in the northern Shephelah. The excavations at Gezer are of major importance in this discussion. During MBIIB Tel Batash was founded as a fortified town surrounded by earth ramparts; a massive mudbrick structure, probably a citadel, was uncovered at the north eastern corner of the city. This site was one in a line of fortified cities which were established at that time in the northern Shephelah, like Gezer and Beth-Shemesh. This settlement pattern is viewed as distinct from that of the Early Bronze Age, when there were no fortified cities in this region, except the very large city of Yarmuth which probably ruled the entire region between the Elah and Sorek Valleys. The transition from the Middle Bronze to the Late Bronze Ages is represented by the destruction of the fortification systems at both Gezer and Tel Batash. Tel Batash remained an unfortified town in the kingdom of Gezer for the rest of the LB period. A series of patrician houses were uncovered in Area B at Tel Batash in Strata X-VII, which span the mid 16th-late 14th centuries BCE. Each of these strata was destroyed by heavy fire, burying quantities of restorable pottery vessels which will be of special value for the study of the development of pottery in this region during LB. The architecture of the patrician houses, particularly those recovered in Strata VIII and VII, is of special interest. Their plans are unique, though buildings at Beth-Shemesh, Gezer and Taanach provide some parallels.</page><page sequence="4">196* ENGLISH SUMMARIES The fate of Tel Batash during the 16th-14th centuries appears to differ widely from that of Gezer, the capital of the city-state to which Tel Batash belonged. The results of the excavations in Area VI at Gezer appear to show that life continued there peacefully for a long period, while during the same period the town of Tel Batash suffered from frequent destructions and subsequent rebuildings. This shows that while the city-state succeeded in defend ing itself against raids, it was too weak to defend its 'daughter' cities, which suffered from attacks by Habiru gangs or other local enemies. Both Gezer and Tel Batash appear to have suffered a great decline and perhaps depopulation during the 13th century BCE. HAZOR AND MARI by A. Malamat (pp. 68-71) A review is presented here of the entire Mari 'corpus' relating to Hazor. At present fourteen Mari documents referring to Hazor are known, a considerable number for two places so distant from each other. Regarding the earliest document, from the days of King Shamshi-Adad, only a few lines have been published. The corpus includes four letters and ten administrative or economic texts, attesting to close ties between Mari and Hazor. Previously, we have dealt in a series of articles with the older material, while here the emphasis is placed on the last three volumes of the Mari archives, ARMT 23, 24 and 25 (published 1984-1986). They contain seven refer ences to Hazor (half of the entire corpus), mentioning messengers from Hazor at the Mari court or shipments of one sort or another from and to Hazor in the days of Zimri-Lim, the last king of Mari. Of special interest are the three references in Volume 25, attesting to despatches of jewellery, gold and silver vessels by the king of Hazor destined for Zimri-Lim. Yet these precious objects are not sent to Mari proper, but rather to depots (pisannu) which the Mari king maintained in far away countries such as Ugarit. A CULT-OBJECT IN THE KH.KERAK WARE CULTURE by Ruth Amiran (pp. 72-74) The horseshoe-shaped object 'decorated' with human representations and other elements is one of the charac terizing features of this culture, and is known all over the area into which this Trans-Caucasian culture migrated or which it conquered in the EB III period. The cardinally important feature on these objects is the representation of a human head perching at the centre of the brim. 111. 1 shows some of the many known specimens of this object, from the excavations in the Amuq, in Beth-Shan, Beth Yerah and Ai. The designations 'andiron' (suggested by S. Hood) or 'stand for a cooking pot' (suggested by R.J. Braidwood) should now be challenged by the discoveries of H.Z. Kosay at Pulur on the Euphrates (as part of the Keban Project). He excavated there some specimens in situ on floors of buildings he identified as temples, which are indeed larger than those found here. Kosay defined these objects as 'sculptural sacred hearths' (Ills. 2-5). I should like to suggest that all these horseshoe-shaped objects excavated here are cult objects, reminiscent in form of a female lap and functioning as receptacles for votive offerings in the ritual. THE SOCIO-DEMOGRAPHIC STRUCTURE OF THE INTERMEDIATE BRONZE AGE by I. Finkelstein (pp. 75-81) The paper deals with the socio-economic system of the people of Palestine in the Intermediate Bronze Age and with the demographic processes in the Early Bronze III Intermediate Bronze Age-Middle Bronze Age con tinuum. Special emphasis is given to the patterns of settlement in the Negev. The main argument is that the multimorphic-symbiotic society of EB III had a pastoral nomadic component, both in the ecological frontier zones of the northern part of the country and in the marginal zones — the Negev and Transjordan. The pastoral groups in this specialized society were 'invisible' archaeologically. The collapse of the urban centres in the last phases of EB III unsettled this socio-economic sys tern. The sedentary communities (now mainly small villages) were not capable of producing enough surplus of grain for exchange with the pastoral groups; as a result the latter had to engage in seasonal agriculture and the former to practice some animal husbandry. Many of the Negev pastoralists settled down and hence became ar chaeologically visible. The reurbanization in the early second millennium brought about a revival of the multi morphic-symbiotic society. The marginal groups shifted back to a specialized economy based on pastoral nomad ism and again 'disappeared' from the archaeological record. RECONSTRUCTING THE CANAANITE TOWER-TEMPLE by A. Kempinski (pp. 82-85) The discovery of a Canaanite tower-temple at Hazor brought the number of these buildings in Palestine to three and in the Syro-Palestinian area to eight. Y. Yadin</page><page sequence="5">ENGLISH SUMMARIES 197* has dealt with the chronology of these buildings, which is now well established in the last phase of the MB IIB (= MB IIC) period. Only a few attempts have been made to reconstruct the facades of these temples. Following W. Andrae's sugges tion made long ago, that cult-stands represent temples, two stands from Megiddo are discussed here: a 629 in the form of a two-storied building and a 201 in the form of a tower (Ills. 1-4). This reconstruction may provide a general idea of the appearance of this building during the last phase of the Late Bronze Age. The architectural details, as well as the painted motifs and decorations of both stands, may also illustrate the exterior wall-decoration of Late Bronze Age cult build ings. THE 'CULT STANDARD' FROM HAZOR IN A NEW LIGHT by Miriam Tadmor (pp. 86-89) Among the numerous cult objects discovered in the excavations at Hazor, the 'Cult Standard' remains unique in its shape and ornamentation and in the fact that it is made of bronze overlaid with silver foil (Y. Yadin et al., Hazor II, Jerusalem 1960, pp. 117-118, PI. CLXXXI; Y. Yadin, Hazor, London 1972, pp. 36-37, PI. XV:C). X-ray radiography has exposed the correct shape of the element incised in the centre of the standard, hitherto supposed to be anthropomorphic. It is, in fact, a geo metric design of a rectangle with a double base and with two bent lines projecting from each of the lower corners. Two dots are seen between the double lines of the base. A brief analysis of the design is discussed within the framework of Canaanite art. A description follows of the standard's find-spot in Building 6211 in Area C, which is interpreted here as a shrine. As the standard was hidden in a pottery 'snake-house', it is tentatively suggested that the rectangle may also be interpreted as a depiction of a container or a cupboard in which snakes were held. It has a double base for the insertion of the snakes, two ventila tion holes, and two projecting handles for carrying. The snakes, so prominent on the standard, strengthen the assumption that the framed face symbolizes the image of the Canaanite 'snake goddess'. The rectangular element is as yet unique in Canaanite iconography. TWO SEALS OF WOMEN AND OTHER HEBREW SEALS by N. Avigad (pp. 90-96) A group of 16 Hebrew seals are discussed here; two of them belong to women. They are acquisitions of un known provenance. The seals are inscribed in palaeo Hebrew script of the 8th-7th centuries BCE. Most of the names mentioned on the seals are known from the Bible; some are unknown. The legends read as follows: 1. l'mnwyhw / bt gdl 9. l'dnyh/w sm' 2. Is'dh 10. lh$lyhw / 'bd' 3. l'bd'/ sryhw / yhy 11. lslm/hdyhw 4. lmhsyhw/nby 12. lsmryhw b/n yrmyhw 5. lpltyhw / bn ksl' 13. lpdyhw/spl 6. lplfyhw / hlqyhw 14. lpshr 7. l'tyhw / mtnyhw 15. lgmryhw b/n 'lntn 8. !,hmlk/yhwT) 16. lrp'bn/bn'nt THE ASSYRIAN ATTACK ON LACHISH: THE EVIDENCE FROM THE SOUTHWEST CORNER OF THE SITE BY D. Ussishkin (pp. 97-114) This paper discusses the topographical and archaeologi cal data from the southwest corner of Tel Lachish, which throw light on the attack carried out by Sennacherib's army on the fortified city of Lachish in 701 BCE. The attack is illustrated in Sennacherib's 'Lachish reliefs'; these reliefs are not discussed in this paper, except for some aspects in which they complement and illustrate the archaeological evidence. Clearly the topographical situation dictated the place of the main attack on the walls. The city was surrounded by deep valleys, except for the southwest corner, where a topographical saddle connected it with the hillock to the southwest, on which Moshav Lachish is situated today. The main attack on the walls seems to have taken place here and the large Assyrian camp was probably located on the hillock to the southwest (111. 2). The excavations at the southwest corner were begun by Starkey and continued by our expedition in 1983-1985 in Area R, a sectional trench oriented vertically to the edge of the mound (Ills. 3, 8, 10-11). These excavations enabled us to understand and reconstruct the battle which took place here. The fortifications at the southwest corner were very strong, especially as the line of the city walls made a sharp corner there. The outer revetment rose here to the sum mit, where it formed a tower; it joined the main city wall at the corner. Together the two walls formed a fortifica tion about 15 m thick in the southwest corner. The Assyrian siege-ramp can be reconstructed. It was fan-shaped and built of stones. A horizontal platform was erected at the top, in front of the tower of the outer revetment. Here stood the siege machines which attacked the walls. Once the defenders were overcome, the As Syrians extended the siege-ramp on top of the tower of the</page><page sequence="6">198* ENGLISH SUMMARIES outer revetment in order to attack a new defence line further inside. A counter-ramp, composed in the main of debris taken from earlier levels, was dumped by the defenders against the inner face of the main city wall opposite the place where the Assyrians built the siege-ramp. It rose higher than the city wall, and enabled the defenders to prepare a new inner defensive line, once the defence of the city walls had collapsed. The second stage of the siege-ramp seems to have been laid in order to attack this new defence line. Remains of weapons and ammunition, as well as the 'Lachish reliefs5, enable us to study the details of the battle. Among the finds, mention should be made of an iron chain and of large perforated stones hung on ropes which were apparently used by the defenders to attack the siege machines, as well as sling stones and about 850 Assyrian arrowheads. An appendix discusses the possibility that a unit of 50 royal Judaean chariots was garrisoned at Lachish in the 8th century BCE. This conclusion is based on a number of indications, primarily the southern annex of the palace-fort (111. 23) which we interpret as a stable for horses, and the large courtyard in front of it, which may have been used for drills and chariot parades. LEXICAL NOTES ON SOME ANCIENT MILITARY TERMS BY I. Eph'al (pp. 115-119) The focus of this paper is on the lexicology of certain composite expressions which were used as military tech nical terms. 1) The expression elip qarabi, "battle ship", occurs initially in the inscriptions of Ashurbanipal pertaining to his war against Tirhaqa, king of Egypt (667 BCE). The origin of the first component of this expression (elippu) is East Semitic, while the second (קרב, qaräbü) is West Semitic. Their relatively late interest in naval warfare accounts for the Assyrian scribes5 need to formulate such a composite technical term. 2) The semantic terms for "captive" in biblical He brew, Babylonian (Achaemenid period) and Greek are derivations of the standard weapon common to each of the respective societies among whom these languages were in use; cf. שביות חרב, "captured by sword" (Gen. 31:26);hubut qasti, "captured by bow" (Camb. 334); and aixpaXcoxoi;, "captured by spear". 3) The verb רמה along with the noun קשת, "bow", occur in the Bible in two combinations:רמה/רומי קשת, "archer(s)" (Jer. 4:29; Ps. 78:9) and קשת דמיה (Hosea 7:16; Ps. 78:57). From the biblical references to רמה and רמיה, as well as from the Greek and Aramaic translations, three meanings for רמיה are discernible: a) shooting, casting; b) deceit, treachery; c) looseness. From a linguistic point of view, all three are legitimate meanings of the term קשת רמיה. Assuming, however, that this is a technical term, it is imperative that we determine which meaning is pertinent to our discussion. Upon further comparison with the Akkadian qastum ramitum (Hh VIIA 66; ABL 281 rev. 9), it is apparent that קשת רמיה means "a loose bow". 4) מלא קשת, "to draw a bow" (2 Kings 9:24; Zech. 9:13) indicates that qastum malitum means a "drawn bow". This definition should not be confused with קשת דרוכה which means "a strung bow". THE EVIDENCE FOR METAL INDUSTRY AT DAN by A. Biran (pp. 120-134) The discovery of crucibles and of tuyeres in the course of the 1974-1975 excavations of Area B at Tel Dan indi cated that a metal industry had existed at Dan in the Iron Age (11th century BCE; Strata IV and V). When work was resumed in Area B in 1984-1987 it was found that the remains of the installations extended over a relatively large area and that the Iron Age metal industry appears already in the early 12th century BCE (Stratum VI). Numerous crucibles and bronze slag, tuyeres, circular stone installations, hearths with ashes and a wide reper toire of pottery vessels were uncovered. The vessels include chalices, pyxides, pithoi, jugs, cooking pots and a unique vessel, possibly a 'snake-house'. The vessels were found in three distinct levels, thus establishing three stages also in the metal industry. They belong to the Early Iron Age, the 12th-11th centuries BCE. An additional installation, a tabun and crucible discovered in 1985, is dated to Late Bronze I. This fact raises the question whether the metal industry was indigenous to the tribes men of Dan or whether they had learned the craft from the Canaanites of Laish whom they had replaced. AN EDOMITE SHRINE AT HORVAT QITMIT by I. Beit-Arieh (pp. 135-146) An Edomite shrine was recently discovered and ex cavated at H. Qi(mit by a team of the Institute of Archaeology of Tel Aviv University, headed by the author. Many cult objects, including cult stands, incense burners, zoomorphic and anthropomorphic figurines of clay were found near a bama in the sacred precinct. The layout of the temple and the iconography are completely alien to the Land of Judah. The pottery recovered in the shrine dates from the last decades of the First Temple period (about 600 BCE). The definition of the shrine as Edomite is based on Edomite pottery and epigraphy, as</page><page sequence="7">ENGLISH SUMMARIES 199* well as on the similarity of several of the figurines to those found in the territory of Edom. The existence of the Edomite shrine in the eastern Negev probably indicates Edomite occupation of part of that region at a time when Judah was already weakened by the Babylonian conflict, or a few years later. ON THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE FIGURE ON THE CULT-STAND FROM THE 'CITY OF DAVID' by P1RH1YA Beck (pp. 147-148) A fragment of a cult-stand found in the 10th century Stratum 14 of the City of David represents a nude male figure with a pointed beard and especially long hair and with an additional pair of hands at the centre of the body. Shiloh suggested that the figure may have carried some animal on the shoulders or perhaps been held as a captive(?). The depiction of the hair and beard has been compared to that of the figure of one of the 'Sea Peoples' on the gaming board from Enkomi, or to the nude figure in the scene on the ivory dagger from Megiddo. On the basis of analogies with representations on reliefs from North Syria (e.g. Carchemish and Tell Ha laf), ivory carvings (Nimrud) and Phoenician metal bowls representing a special Syrian version of the scene of 'the killing of Humbaba', recently discussed by Lambert, it is suggested that the similarly depicted figure from Jerusalem should be interpreted as representing the same scene. Thus, the iconography of the cult-stand from the City of David depicts a specific Syrian version of a well known Near Eastern theme, which is in keeping with the subject matter of many cult-stands of the Early Iron Age, unrelated to any Aegean or Cypriote iconography. THE TRANSITION FROM CANAANITE TO ISRAELITE HEGEMONY IN PALESTINE — A SUGGESTION by Shulamit Geva (pp. 149-153) The paper — the first step in a wider study — deals with the transition from the Canaanite to the Israelite cultural hegemony in Palestine. This is one of the most inten sively researched topics in biblical archaeology, and it was treated, by Yigael Yadin both in his theoretical studies and in his excavations. The present article begins by analysing excavation results concerning the 12th-1 Oth centuries BCE at some key sites: Beth-Shean — from the destruction of Stratum VIB to the foundation of lower VA (Yadin's last excavation); Megiddo — from the destruction of VIIA to the foundation of VA-VIB; Hazor — from the destruction of Stratum XIII to the founda tion of X, and Taanach — from IA-IB to the foundation of IIB. A new scheme for the whole slow and complex process is then proposed, which is based on tracing some identical development stages at each site, in spite of many local variations. The suggested new scheme seems to correspond to the picture obtained from the analysis of the situation during the 12th and 11th centuries, both from the Canaanite and the Israelite point of view. IRON KNIVES FROM TEL MIQNE-EKRON by Trude Dothan (pp. 154-163) The excavations at Tel Miqne-Ekron have yielded a number of outstanding finds. Among them was a com plete iron knife affixed by bronze rivets to an ivory handle with a ring-shaped pommel. This knife was discovered in a monumental public building, possibly a palace with shrine, located at the heart of the Philistine city. Its cultic or ceremonial significance is indicated by its elegant craftsmanship and the context in which it was found — on the floor of one of the shrine rooms which contained a bama, together with several iron and bronze artifacts. The same floor had a rich assortment of Philistine Bi chrome pottery, dating the entire assemblage to the first half of the 11th century. In the adjacent room, also a shrine with a bama, another ivory knife-handle was found, as well as three bronze wheels and a frame frag ment belonging to a square stand of the type known from Cyprus in the 12th-l 1th centuries BCE. Two additional ivory knife-handles of the same type were found at Tel Miqne. One of these, a handle whose insertion slot still bore traces of its iron blade, was found in an area which contained a large quantity of locally made Mycenaean IIIC: lb pottery. This handle is dated to the first half of the 12th century (Stratum VI), linking it to the initial settlement of the Philistines at Ekron. The discoveries of the complete iron knife and this ivory handle with traces of an iron blade, add to the quota of iron appearing at Philistine sites in Iron I, and raises the question anew as to the role of the Philistines in the introduction of ironworking technology. The most pertinent parallel for this type of knife handle from excavations in Israel was found in the northeast part of the courtyard relating to the Philistine temple of Stratum XII at Tel Qasila. This handle, also of ivory and terminating in a ring, was preserved with a fragment of its iron blade attached by bronze rivets. This parallel is valuable both typologically and contextually. First, because it closely resembles the examples from Tel Miqne in form, size and materials; and secondly, because of its discovery in a cultic context in the earliest Philistine settlement phase at Qasila. Similar knives with ring-shaped handles have been found at sites in Cyprus and the Aegean. Current research points with increasing frequency to evidence of European influence in the development of this type of knife with ring finial.</page><page sequence="8">200* ENGLISH SUMMARIES The assemblage of iron and bronze finds in cultic contexts at Tel Miqne-Ekron adds another facet to our knowledge of Philistine cultic practices and strengthens their link with the Aegean world. A CREMATION BURIAL AT AZOR — A DANITE CITY by M. Dothan (pp. 164-174) A large group of different types of burials was found in the excavations at Azor, southeast of Jaffa, dating from the 12th to the 6th century BCE. Among them was a cremation burial, which consisted of a stone-built square structure with a large store-jar standing in the middle. In this jar, parts of charred human skulls, some charred bones and a few burial gifts were found, as well as a copper bowl and a gold mouthpiece. Some pottery vessels were uncovered near the mouth of the jar, which was covered by a broken basalt vessel. The human remains were of males 42-45 and 14-16 years old. The finds indicate that this burial belongs to approximately the mid-11th century BCE. Cremation burials in Palestine, which are still rare in this period, may have originated either in Syria-Anatolia or in the Aegean region. The question arises whether this burial could have belonged to one of the Sea-Peoples groups which settled from the 12th century onwards on the Canaanite coast. More specifically, could this burial belong to the Dnn, one of these groups (identified by Yadin with the tribe of Dan), to whom the territory of Azor belonged. According to biblical sources, part of the tribe of Dan left Judah for the city of Laish, but the other part stayed behind, mainly on the coastal strip around Jaffa. The two ethnic elements, the Hebrew Danites and the Dnn, may have by then fused into one group, which lived in the coastal areas and engaged mainly in maritime crafts (Judges 5:17). It seems therefore possible that this type of cremation burial was brought to Canaan by the Dnn, who mixed in Azor with the Israelite settlers of the tribe of Dan. The cremation burial of the mid-11th century in Azor was the forerunner of the cremation burials a few generations later. From the 10th century onwards, this type of burial in different variations became one of the popular meth ods of interment, especially along the Phoenician coast and in the southwestern part of Palestine. THE ROYAL ECONOMY OF KING DAVID COMPARED WITH THE ROYAL ECONOMY IN UGARIT by M. Heltzer (pp. 175-180) The biblical passage in 1 Chr. 27:25-31, which is an excerpt from an archaic documentary chronicle, relates to the organization of King David's economy (first half of the 10th century BCE). The text shows that the main economic categories were in the territories which David conquered from the Philistines. The economy was spe cialized: cereals, vineyards, olive groves, large and small cattle breeding and even camel and donkey breeding were managed separately. The separate existence of vineyards and wine-stores, olive-groves and oil stores, shows that the produce was not consumed in the economy, but was distributed according to the policy of the court and state. We learn also about the existence of special workers, managers and their staff, overseeing all the branches of the economy. Some of them came not from the nobility, but from the royal service-personnel and also from the areas conquered by David. Compared with the royal economy of Ugarit in the 13th century BCE, more centralization is evident here, while the royal economy of Ugarit in its time was dis persed in elementary units — gt — over the whole kingdom. THE WEDGE-DECORATED BOWL AND THE ORIGIN OF THE CUTHAEANS by A. Zertal (pp. 181-187) A special type of pottery decoration, found, discerned and defined during the course of the Survey of the hillcountry of Manasseh, can serve as the basis for the chronology of the Late Iron II period in the Samaria hills. Moreover, the origin of this decoration seems to be in southern Mesopotamia, and can be of significance in the history of Northern Israel after the Assyrian conquest of Samaria. This is a unique decoration, imprinted before firing on the bottom of deep bowls, well known in the Samaria hills in the 8th-7th centuries BCE. The decoration is com posed of wedge-shaped signs, reminiscent of cuneiform script. Its geographical distribution is confined to the northeastern part of the Manasseh hillcountry, mainly between Shechem, Samaria and Tirzah (Tell Far'ah, N). Its Mesopotamian origin suggests the possibility that this decoration may have been brought to Samaria by the people settled in the area by the Assyrian kings after the fall of Samaria and the northern Israelite Kingdom in 721 BCE. The origin of these exiles was in Arabia, southern Mesopotamia and Elam. If this is indeed the case, the wedge-decorated bowl can be used not only as a useful chronological tool for dating the 7th century BCE, but also as proof of the origin and history of the ethnic groups which later crystallized as the Cuthaeans or the Samari tans of the Second Temple period.</page><page sequence="9">ENGLISH SUMMARIES 201" THE REPRESENTATION AND IDENTIFICATION OF CITIES ON ASSYRIAN RELIEFS by Ruth Jacoby (pp. 188-197) The Assyrian kings customarily decorated their palaces with reliefs, glorifying and praising the ruler in various ways. One method was to show countries and cities that the king had conquered. Identification of the cities on the reliefs was significant; the more distant and the stronger the city, the more fame it brought to the king who conquered it. The question is: how was the identity of a city indicated? Was the artistic description realistic or did the artists use conventional motifs? After checking over a hundred cities appearing on Assyrian reliefs, the author came to the conclusion that the main identification consisted of the city name in scribed on the relief, as well as of the inclusion of special features of the topography and vegetation, typical dress, the appearance of the population and their country's booty. On rare occasions an easily recognizable building was added to the conventional depiction of a city. THE IDENTIFICATION OF ZEREDAH, HOME OF JEROBOAM SON OF NEBAT, KING OF ISRAEL by M. Kochavi (pp. 198-201) The Masoretic text tells us only that Jeroboam the Ephraimite was born in (the) Zeredah. A much debated paragraph in the Septuagint (1 Kings 12:24 +ff.) describes Zeredah as Jeroboam's fortified capital city. Tur-Sinai explained the meaning of the place-name as 'dry, barren land'. In 1923 Albright came upon a spring called 'Ein Sari dah, located in Wadi Saridah (today part of Nahal Shi loh). He identified the ruin of Kh. Balatah, by that spring, as Jeroboam's Zeredah. He changed his mind after Alt argued convincingly that at Kh. Balatah the pottery sherds were from the Byzantine and later periods only. In a short trial excavation, conducted in 1933 in the village of Deir Ghassaneh, several miles upstream, Albright found evidence of an Iron Age settlement and suggested identifying Zeredah with that village, an identification which was accepted from that time on. During the Regional Survey conducted by the Aphek Antipatris excavation team under the present writer in 1973, an Iron Age site was located just above 'Ein Saridah. The site of Kh. Banat-Bar is situated in a well protected and commanding position. Its acropolis, an elongated barren rock formation 15 m higher than its immediate surroundings, could have served as a princely fort and its unusual form could have been the reason for its name. The proximity to the spring and the wadi bearing the ancient name and the appropriate archaeo logical remains, suggest that Kh. Banat-Bar was the site of Jeroboam's Zeredah, while Kh. Balatah down in the river-bed was the site of the Zeredah of the Second Temple and later periods. THE TRIUMPHS OF THE LORD by B.A. Levine (pp. 202-214) The book of Numbers preserves a series of poems, occur ring in chapters 21-25. These include the orations of Balaam and other expressions of praise for Israel and their God. These texts have always presented philological and exegetical difficulties, because they attest many ha pax legomena, and their style is also distinctive. The present study represents another effort to engage the interpretation of the poems in Numbers. Following the methodology of Albright and Morag, who have taught us to expect new meanings and anomalous usages in these poems, we provide new suggestions relative to their context and their diction. It is argued that they are more heroic than moralistic, and contain elements of magical theory. The literary character of the Hebrew mäsal is explored and the import of the newly-discovered inscrip tions from Deir 'Alia is assessed. Throughout, compara tive lexicography is applied to the exegesis of difficult verses. THE HOUSE OF OMRI by B. Mazar (pp. 215-219) Shomron, the capital of Israel, was apparently estab lished by Omri because of his affiliation to the tribe of Issachar and his descent from the Tola family, the most important clan of that tribe, whose home was Shamir, which is Shomron. This is also the reason why Jezreel, a town of Issachar, functioned as the second capital of the Israelite kingdom during the rule of the Omrid dynasty. The author suggests that the biblical story concerning the naming of the new capital city built by Omri and named after Shemer, "the owner of the hill Shomron" (1 Kings 16:23-24), refers to the implementation of the Israelite law of redeeming the land property of a person who died childless and commemorating his name by a relative the go'el. The main purpose was to preserve the de ceased's name on his property, so that his name would not be effaced. The most striking example of this custom can be found in Boaz's words at the gate of Bethlehem (Ruth 4:9-10). The Omrid dynasty was respected in Israel as a ruling house which had many achievements to its credit in consolidating the independence of the state and extend</page><page sequence="10">202* ENGLISH SUMMARIES ing its boundaries, buttressing its political, military and economic power, and especially in fostering close rela tions with Tyre and Judah. Of special interest is the emphasis on Mt. Carmel as a hallowed place and the establishment of the chief cult centre of the God of Israel at the foot of the mountain, near the altar of Baal Ba'al-Shamem — of its Phoenician allies. Jehu's military takeover led not only to the extermina tion of the house of Omri and the destruction of the cult of the Phoenician Baal among the ruling classes of Israel, but also to the end of the 'covenant of brothers' and the marriage relations between the royal houses of Samaria, Tyre and Jerusalem, and to the abandonment of the cult place on Mt. Carmel. Moreover, as an immediate result of this change, Israel lost its political stand against the Aramaeans and had to pay tribute to Shalmaneser III of Assyria (841 BCE). It is probable that up to the destruction of the Israelite kingdom, considerable sections of the population har boured resentment and felt disgust at Jehu's extermina tion of the house of Omri, since they regarded the rule of the Omrid dynasty as a time of exemplary prosperity, ease and good external relations. This view was widely held in spite of the dynasty's tolerant attitude towards the Baal worship introduced by Jezebel, Ahab's wife. Also it can be reasonably assumed that because of the events after Jehu's takeover, Beth-el regained its status as the central cult place of the God of Israel which it had enjoyed in the reign of Jeroboam I, before it had been replaced by Mt. Carmel. It is therefore not surprising that Beth-el in the southern hillcountry of Ephraim became "the king's chapel and the royal capital" (Amos 7:13) in the reign of Jeroboam II, the greatest king of the dynasty of Jehu. Presumably, Jehu's murderous deeds in Jezreel and Shomron were the target of Hosea's forceful words (Hosea 1:4-5); it is not surprising that both this prophet and Amos were sceptical and even outright negative in their attitude towards Beth-el as the central shrine of the kingdom of Israel. THE TEMPLES OF TEL QASILA ADDITIONAL COMMENTS ON THEIR ARCHITECTURAL AND CULTIC AFFINITIES by Ora Negbi (pp. 220-227) Recently it has been argued that the layout and context of the three successive temples discovered by A. Mazar at Tel Qasila have no diagnostic affinities to support their attribution to the Philistines. The first temple, founded in the mid-12th century BCE (Stratum XII), is a modest structure that evolved, accord ing to Mazar, from Late Bronze Age Canaanite forerun ners. Strangely enough, however, he has suggested that the double sanctuary which replaced the original struc ture during the 11th century BCE (Strata XI-X), is alien to the architectural tradition of the Levant and that its origins should be sought overseas. Reevaluation of the architectural and spatial data re veals that double sanctuaries incorporating major and subsidiary shrines existed in the Levant (Alalakh, Kamid el־Loz) during the 14th-13th centuries BCE. Kamid el Loz, in the Biq'a of Lebanon, is of special interest, since it has yielded a complex of two double sanctuaries (an eastern and a western one) built adjoining each other. The history of the eastern sanctuary goes back to the closing stages of the Middle Bronze Age; the western sanctuary was added to it in the Amarna Period, and both edifices were used till the end of the Late Bronze Age. The layout and size of the two sanctuaries, each consisting of a major and a minor structure attached to each other, is very similar. Comparative study indicates that their ma jor and minor components combine two distinctive types of Canaanite temples that prevailed in Israel during the Late Bronze and Early Iron Ages. The major structures of both sanctuaries correspond to a series of Palestinian temples, such as Fosse Temples II III, which have been recently classified by Stern as a Canaanite version of Egyptian prototypes. The minor structure of the eastern sanctuary is a single-room shrine with a corner platform, which bears a close resemblance to the Late Bronze Age road-temple uncovered by Stern at Tel Mevorakh. The architectural affinities of the major and minor components of the Tel Qasila sanctuaries are like those of Kamid el-Loz. The major Temple of Stratum X recalls Fosse Temple II-III at Lachish; and the subsidiary shrine of Strata XI-X is a miniature version of the Tel Me vorakh temple (the enigmatic layout of the major temple of Stratum XI presumably combines features of both types). As a result the assumption is unavoidable that the Canaanite affinities attested to by Mazar in the original 'Philistine' temple of Stratum XII, become even more diagnostic in the double sanctuaries of Strata XI-X. Furthermore, with the exception of an anthropomorphic vessel found in the major temple of Stratum X, the cult paraphernalia recovered from the sacred area of Tel Qasila are overwhelmingly Canaanite. In trying to trace the cultic heritage of the Philistines, one would expect to discover at Tel Qasila Aegean 'bench-shrines' and terracotta figurines of the 'goddess with upraised arms', instead of Canaanite temples and cult vessels. The Mycenaean 'hearth room' and a frag ment of an 'Ashdoda' figurine found recently at the site may support Bunimovitz's suggestion that the 'Aegean Quarter' of the 12th-11 th centuries is to be located on the 'acropolis' rather than in the Canaanite sacred area of Tel Qasila.</page><page sequence="11">ENGLISH SUMMARIES 203* A THIRD SEASON OF EXCAVATIONS AT ME$AD HASHAVYAHU by R. Reich (pp. 228-232) A small-scale rescue excavation was carried out by the author in the spring of 1986 in the eastern part of the fort of Me$ad Hashavyahu (grid ref. 1207/1462) (111. 1). The easternmost building of the central block of build ings, and a small part of the adjacent building were cleared (Ills. 2, 3). All the walls were constructed of mudbrick on a foundation of kurkar stone. The eastern part of the fort seems to have been built up, exploiting to a maximum the available space — three blocks of build ings with two streets between them. One occupation layer was identified, containing in situ broken pottery (111. 4). The pottery repertoire represents two groups already identified in the previous excavations at the site, i.e. locally made Judean pottery of the late 7th century BCE and Greek imported wares (one-handled cooking pots, black-painted skyphoi etc.). Outstanding is a lump of haematite (1126 gr.; 111. 5), which may have been used in the iron industry. Similar finds were identified by Petrie in the Greek settlements which he excavated in the Nile Delta (Naukratis, Def feneh). These findings may shed new light on the nature of the Greek presence on this part of the Mediterranean coast. HAZOR, DOR AND MEGIDDO IN THE TIME OF AHAB AND THE ASSYRIAN PERIOD by E. Stern (pp. 233-248) Some years ago Y. Yadin redated the Iron Age gates of Megiddo on the basis of the results of his own excava tions at Hazor and Megiddo, as well as of the reassess ment of Macalister's data concerning his excavations at Gezer. Since then some scholars have challenged Yadin's dating, mainly on the grounds that new data had been found in the files of the original excavators of Megiddo, or simply because they offered new interpretations of the facts already published in the Megiddo final report. The present writer contends that it is possible to use today the material from the Megiddo excavation reports for the reinterpretation of any exact sequence of dating. Any new evaluation should be based on new and well conducted excavations at sites within the territory of the northern Israelite kingdom — Hazor and Dor — which shared a common history with Megiddo. The 10th-cen tury six-room gate at Hazor should be compared with the six-room gate at Megiddo; the dates of two gates exca vated recently by the author at Dor, where the earlier four-room gate was dated to the time of Ahab, and the two-room gate above it to the Assyrian period, should be compared with the similar four-room and two-room gates at Megiddo. This evidence supports Yadin's view. An additional fact furnished by the dig at Dor is that the two-ro( m gate with it's offset-inset wall was in use uninterruptedly from the Assyrian period down to the mid-4th century BCE (the period of the great Phoenician revolt). It is suggested that both the two-room gate and the wall at Megiddo had a similar history. ON THE USE OF ARAMAIC IN THE ASSYRIAN EMPIRE: THREE OBSERVATIONS ON A RELIEF OF SARGON II by H. Tadmor (pp. 249-252) In "The Art of Warfare in the Biblical Lands" the late Y. Yadin drew attention to a scene in one of Sargon's reliefs from Khorsabad: an Assyrian officer mounted on a siege machine, and holding a scroll in his hands, addresses the defenders of a besieged city, demanding, it would seem, their immediate surrender. Yadin rightly observed that this scene resembles the case of Rabshakeh's appeal to the people of Jerusalem to surrender before Sennach erib's armies (2 Kings 18:19ff). In the present paper, this comparison is pursued further. Firstly, according to the cuneiform epigraph on that relief, the city in question, Pazasi, is located in Mannea (Western Iran). It stands to reason that the Assyrian messenger is addressing the people of the city in the language of Mannea. The message on the scroll was most probably written in Aramaic — the second official language of the Assyrian Empire — and translated simul taneously, as to the best of our knowledge, the Manneans did not possess any script for their language. If so, we have here the earliest attestation of the use of Aramaic as a 'heterography', customary in Iran beginning with the Achaemenid period. Two other observations are con cerned with the role of the bilingual Aramaic scribe in the Assyrian imperial administration and with the case of Sennacherib's bilingual chief cup-bearer, Rabshakeh, who addressed the people of Jerusalem in the "language of Judah" (2 Kings 18:28), which was, most likely, his mother tongue. THE FULLER'S FIELD AND THE 'CONDUIT OF THE UPPER POOL' by D. Bahat (pp. 253-255) These sites are prominent topographical features in the First Temple (biblical) period in Jerusalem. Their identi</page><page sequence="12">204* ENGLISH SUMMARIES fication and precise location has not been possible before. Due to the excavations of the Bethesda pools in the courtyard of St. Anne's Church, excavations which were carried out by the White Fathers, M.J. Pierre and J.M. Rousee, the dam between the two pools was examined. The excavators' conclusion was that the dam, and thus the pool at its back, should be dated to the First Temple Period. A rock-cut conduit issuing from this pool is similar to a conduit discovered by Warren under his 'Ophel Tower'. The author proposes that the two conduit sections should be combined, suggesting that the pool at the back of the dam and the conduit supplied water to the upper parts of the hill on which the City of David was built. Since parts of the conduit were within speaking distance of the city walls, it was used by Rab-shakeh as a point from which he could converse with the city's population (2 Kings 18:18; Isa. 7:3). I.O.U. NOTE FROM THE TIME OF THE BAR KOKHBA REVOLT by M. Broshi and E. Qimron (pp. 256-261) This document comprises seventeen lines of Hebrew text written on leather (ca. 15.5 x 6.5 cm). It is an 'I owe you' note from the second year of the Revolt, issued at an unidentified place called החרמת. As is to be expected in such Jewish deeds, no interest is mentioned, but it elab orates in great detail the securities for the repayment of the loan. The photograph of this document was found among the papers of the late Prof. Y. Yadin. Unfortunately we do not know either where it was found or its present location. Most probably it was shown to Yadin by an antiquities dealer. An English version of this paper is to be published in the Israel Exploration Journal. MASADA IN THE BYZANTINE PERIOD — THE MARDA MONASTERY by Y. Hirschfeld (pp. 262-274) The systematic excavations carried out at Masada under Y. Yadin exposed many Byzantine remains, including a church complex, storerooms, cells, cisterns, potsherds and other small finds. These remains were identified (by M.J. Lagrange and V. Delau early in this century) as a laura (hermits' monastery) known in ancient sources as Marda. The name Marda in Aramaic means 'fortified site', indicating the existence of an earlier fortress. Ya din's excavation makes it possible to trace the plan of the Byzantine laura at Masada. Though Masada is sur rounded by jutting, rocky peaks, its top is flat and level. It is about 600 m long and ranges from a narrow point to 300 m in width at the centre. The total area is about 20 acres (= 80 dunams), bounded on all sides by precipices giving the hill its familiar form. Along the edge of the cliff around the hilltop a casemate wall was built during the Herodian period. This wall was restored by the Byzantine monks. In fact, the only building which the monks erected from the foundations was the chapel and its annexes. All the other buildings were built among and from the ruins of the Second Temple period. Relatively well-preserved parts of buildings were chosen by the monks, such as the western palace gate or the eastern wall of the great bathhouse. Similarly the monks made inten sive use of various architectural parts such as sections of columns which supported tables or were used as doorsills. The entrance gate of the monastery was placed at the western end of the hilltop, opposite the Roman ramp. It was a solid stone gate with double arches. The upper one is a pointed arch, one of the earliest example of its kind. From the gate a path leads to the centre of the laura, which included a church and service buildings. The church compound comprised a prayer hall, a narthex, and two annexes to the north. To the east of the church and its annexes was a courtyard (ca. 18 x 20 m) sur rounded by a stone wall. The service buildings of the laura were apparently situated in the casemates of the wall, ca. 50 m west of the church. A number of tables as well as numerous Byzantine storage vessels were found there. A courtyard enclosed by a wall, similar to the courtyard around the church compound, extended in front of the service buildings. If this was indeed the location of the service buildings, we have here one more example of the division of the laura core into two parts: the church compound on the one hand and the service buildings on the other, a division similar to that found in the ruins of other lauras, e.g. Pharan, 'Ein Fawwar (Pegae), the Nea laura and the laura of Firminus. On the hilltop of Masada 13 hermit cells were found, at an average distance of 56 m. from each other (close to that of other lauras in the Judean Desert). All the cells were built within or among the ruins of Herodian build ings: Cell No. 2 next to the wall of the caldarium of the large bathhouse; Cell No. 4 in the entrance gate of the western palace; Cell No. 9 in a Herodian columbarium. Other cells were placed in abandoned water cisterns (e.g. Cell No. 13), and yet others in an underground cave (e.g. Cell No. 6) on the walls of which crosses were painted in red. The number of cells indicates that the laura of Marda probably housed between 15 and 20 monks. A ROMAN CUPPING VESSEL FROM MASADA by Malka Hershkovitz (pp. 275-277) A large number of bronze vessels were found at Masada during the excavations of 1963-1965, directed by Prof.</page><page sequence="13">ENGLISH SUMMARIES 205* Y. Yadin. Among them was a unique vessel which came from Building 9, in the destruction layer of 73 CE. Inside the vessel were 6 shekels and 6 half-shekels, all of silver, which had melted as a result of the fire. The vessel (Reg. No. 365-329) was cast from bronze. It has an elongated mushroom shape, with an upper domed portion and a lower cylindrical portion. (Height 10 cm, maximum width 7.2 cm; diameter of lower body and mouth 4.2 cm). The rim is slightly thickened and out turned. Originally a bell-shaped iron fitting with a bronze ring was attached to the top of the dome. Both were broken during subsequent treatment. This object can be identified as a Roman medical vessel, specifically a cupping vessel, known in Latin as a cucurbitula. Precise parallels are known from Germany, Corfu, Pompeii, Herculaneum and Cyprus. Until now, only one such vessel, from the Harvard excavations at Samaria, has been published from an excavation in Israel. Although the excavators did not identify it, both the description and the drawing leave no doubt that it is the same type of vessel. The method of extracting blood by the use of such a vessel was known in Greece as early as the 5th century BCE. In Roman times, cupping vessels are commonly found in tombs throughout the Empire, and are also illustrated on grave stelas. They were part of the regular equipment of physicians who accompanied the legions. We assume that the cupping vessel found at Masada originally belonged to a Roman physician and was taken as loot by one of the defenders of the fortress. The vessel, containing the valuable shekels, was hidden so that it would not fall into the hands of the Roman soldiers; instead it came into the hands of the excavator of Masada 1900 years later. FRAGMENTS OF SCROLLS FROM MASADA by S. Talmon (pp. 278-286) The English version of this article is a part of the final report on the Masada excavations and will be published in the Masada series. THE MINTS OF ASHDOD AND ASCALON DURING THE LATE PERSIAN PERIOD by Y. Meshorer (pp. 287-291) The silver coinage of Palestine struck during the Persian period, roughly between 400 and 333 BCE, has been attributed mainly to the mint of Gaza, as this city used to be the only one whose name appeared clearly on the coins. Newell tried to read the names of other cities situated along the Mediterranean coast and indeed sug gested that a coin with the letters אש should be attributed to either Ascalon or Ashdod. During the last twenty years many more coins of the Philisto-Arabian group have been found and today we are able to attribute them with much more certainty to several different mints. We have noted that certain coin-types are usually found on the southern Mediterranean coast while others come from further inland, from Samaria and Judea. We believe that there is enough evidence today to indicate that at least five different mints were in operation during that period in the Holy Land: Jerusalem and Samaria inland, and Gaza, Ashdod and Ascalon on the coast. There is even a possibility that another mint operated east of the Jordan. Some of the coins bear inscriptions (Aramaic or Phoenician) mentioning the name of the city, while others refer apparently to the names of the governors. The difficulty in the classification of the so-called Phil isto-Arabian coins stems mainly from the fact that they either have no inscription at all or, if there is one, it is very short, rarely more than one or two letters. The designs are also not very indicative, since many of the coins imitate Greek or Phoenician prototypes. Fortu nately, we have several coins with full inscriptions which should help to interpret the abbreviated inscriptions. Possible identification through design analogy should also be considered. The names of two cities in the relevant region — Ascalon and Ashdod — begin with the letters אש (ale/ shin). Hence both cities could be indicated by these two letters. However it seems that in the 4th century BCE, in order to avoid confusion, it was decided that the name of Ashdod would be abbreviated אש ('§), while the name of Ashkelon (Ascalon) would be abbreviated אן ('N) standing for the first and last letters of the name 'SKLWN. A SIEGE SYSTEM AND AN ANCIENT ROAD AT ALEXANDRIUM by Z. Meshel (pp. 292-301) Segments of two siege systems were discovered by the author at the foot of the Hasmonean-Herodian fortress. They include two incomplete rings of circumvallation walls (poorly preserved) and a few small 'camps' or enclosures. The finds cannot date the siege works, but the only siege of Alexandrium recorded by Josephus Flavius was laid by Gabinius in 57 BCE. The absence of a siege-rampart and the fact that the circumvallation walls are incomplete, fit Josephus' state ment that the fortress surrendered and was not con quered in battle. The material recorded during the survey of the siege systems is published in detail in the present article.</page><page sequence="14">206* ENGLISH SUMMARIES THE ARAMAIC AND HEBREW INSCRIPTIONS FROM ANCIENT SYNAGOGUES by J. Naveh (pp. 302-310) A decade after the publication of On Stone and Mosaic, the author brings the epigraphic finds and some relevant subjects up-to-date. Three topics are discussed: A. Syna gogue Inscriptions and Jewish Liturgy; B. Synagogue Inscriptions and Magic; and C. Ancient Samaritan In scriptions. These comprise the first three chapters of the paper. Chapter IV is devoted to Additions and Correc tions, in which inscriptions from eleven sites are dis cussed: l.H. Marish; 2. Qayrin; 3.'Assaliyeh; 4. Korazin; 5. H. Kanaf; 6. H. ha-'Ammudim; 7. Tiber ias; 8. Naveh; 9. Kh. Habra; 10.'En Gedi; 11. Dura Europos. Chapter V is a reminder that inscriptions from Rehov and one from 'En Gedi — all known for many years — have not yet been published. THE PROCESS OF MASADA'S DESTRUCTION by E. Netzer (pp. 311-320) The paper deals mainly with the wall of wood and earth built by the Zealots in their last attempt to prevent the Romans from breaking through into the fortified hilltop by means of the huge ramp they built. Up to the present, Josephus was the only source (War, VIII, 8, 5) for this episode. The author suggests that in the last weeks before the destruction, the zealots dismantled 90 •to of the ceil ings of the store-rooms and rooms at Masada in order to use the wooden beams for constructing the wood-and earth wall. This fortification consisted of an outer wall of beams 4-5 m long, laid horizontally and at right angles to the wall, adjoining the outer side of the casemate wall. A fill of earth and stones 5-6 m wide was laid down next to these beams. This fill was backed by another wall of wooden beams (2-3 m long) and bordered on the sides by a wall of upright wooden beams. According to the author's calculations, this wall was about 12 m wide, 20-25 m long and 8 m high. Undoub tedly it prevented the Romans from breaching with battering rams the casemate wall at its base and must have forced them to raise their siege ramp, thus delaying the attack by several weeks. The proof for the general dismantling of the ceilings is mainly based on the analysis of the rooms where evi dence of fire was uncovered, as against rooms where no such evidence was found, chiefly in the western palace and the northern area. In addition, it is pointed out that the Roman garrison stationed at Masada after the con quest did not have at its disposal the numerous rooms existing there before the destruction. After the destruction of the wall by fire, a policy of scorched earth was instituted at Masada. All the rooms which still had a ceiling were burnt and so were most of the personal belongings. As far as this episode is con cerned, the archaeological remains correspond in the main to the description by Josephus. A JUGLET CONTAINING BALSAM OIL(?) FROM A CAVE NEAR QUMRAN by J. Patrich and B. Arubas (pp. 321-332) A first century CE juglet containing c. 50 cm3 of thick reddish fluid was found in April 1988 in a cave located c. 2.8 km to the north of Kh. Qumran. The juglet was hidden between rocks about 1 m below ground level, and was found wrapped in palm fibers, indicating that the content may have been precious. Chemical analyses and tests (see appendix) prove that the fluid is a plant oil. It was possible to determine that it is neither olive nor any other common oil; however it was impossible to identify the specific plant from which this oil was extracted. There are features resembling palm kernel oil, which is manufactured at present for medical purposes. However, a thorough study of ancient literary sources — both Greco-Roman and Rabbinic — shows that such an oil was unknown in that period. Therefore we suggest very cautiously that the oil was extracted from an extinct plant, namely the balsam tree, According to ancient authors — Theophrastus (4th century BCE), Dioscurides and Pliny (both 1st century CE) and others — it is clear that the Opobalsamum, the sap which ran out of from incisions made in the bark of the balsam tree by means of a sharp stone, a pottery sherd, a piece of glass or a bone (but never iron nails), was a viscous, reddish, fragrant oil. According to Pliny, a drop of pure Opobalsamum will sink to the bottom of a vessel containing warm water. So does a drop of the oil from the juglet, which is reddish and thick as well. However, since balsam is an extinct plant, there is no way of verifying our hypothesis. In any case, we have here a considerable quantity of a plant oil about 2000 years old — a unique find in Israel until now. TWO BRONZE ORNAMENTS IN THE SHAPE OF RAMS' HEADS FROM MASADA by G. Foerster (pp. 333-336) The ornaments were found together on the floor of Room 611 in one of the palaces (XI) at Masada. They are probably spoils from some encounter of the Zealots with the Romans. The identical heads (3.95 X 2.5 X 1.0 cm), were cast with worked details only on one side while the other side was left smooth and plain.</page><page sequence="15">ENGLISH SUMMARIES 207* It is suggested that these ornaments may have dec orated the metal ram's head of a battering ram used manually in the Classical, Hellenistic and Roman periods in siege warfare, as, for example, on a ram's head found in Olympia. Other possibilities are also explored and some phalerae are presented. THE SYNAGOGUE AT MEROTH, THE SYNAGOGUE AT CAPERNAUM, AND THE DATING OF THE GALILEAN SYNAGOGUE A RECONSIDERATION by Y. Tsafrir (pp. 337-344) In recent years a previously unknown synagogue was excavated by Ilan and Damati at Meroth in Upper Gali lee. This synagogue was dated by the excavators to the first half of the 5th or the very end of the 4th century CE. The building generally resembles the Galilean syna gogues of the so-called 'earlier type', traditionally attrib uted to the 3rd century CE. Thus it seems to strengthen the late dating of the synagogue at Capernaum, as sug gested by its excavators, Corbo and Loffreda. These scholars believe that the synagogue at Capernaum was founded in the time of Julian (361-363 CE) and that the building came to an end not earlier than 475 CE. They base their dating mostly on numismatic and ceramic evidence. The scholars who accept this dating at Caper naum believe that, in consequence, other synagogues in Galilee, traditionally accepted as 'earlier', should also be attributed to the later date, which was apparently proved at Capernaum. The aim of this article is to challenge and refute such a conclusion. A thorough analysis of the stratigraphical conditions at Capernaum shows that the synagogue was indeed built in the 3rd century, or, at the latest, very early in the 4th century CE. The numerous 4th-century coins found below the floor level of the synagogue were col lected at the very top of the fill, and mostly in the mortar bedding of the pavement. This location of the coins confirms the suggestion supported by several scholars, that the ceramic and numismatic evidence does not indicate a late date for the foundation of the building, but rather a late reconstruction and repaving of the edifice. This stratigraphical analysis is based entirely on the data given by the excavators themselves in their preliminary reports. On the other hand, the article shows that although the general plan of the synagogue at Meroth is close to that of the 'earlier' synagogues, the quality of execution of the stone carving of the architectural elements in Meroth is significantly inferior. The conclusion follows that the builders at Meroth tried to keep to the regional classical tradition of synagogue construction (and perhaps they may have been inspired by the monumental building at neighbouring H. Qa$yon) but they were unable to achieve the high quality of masonry typical of other Galilean synagogues. If we accept the date of Meroth in the early 5th or the very late 4th century CE, we have to conclude that the other Galilean synagogues, featuring the higher standard of architectural execution typical of the Late Roman style, must be dated to an earlier period. Thus the 'conservative' dating of the synagogue at Capernaum, and other 'earlier synagogues' to the 3rd century CE seems to be correct. LEAD WEIGHTS OF BEN-KOSBA'S ADMINISRATION by A. Kloner (pp. 345-351) A lead weight was found in 1987 at Horvat 'Alim, 2.5 km north of Bet-Govrin, on the floor of a typical passage in a secret system of hideouts. The tablet measures 70 x 83 mm on one side and 78 x 93 mm on the other; it is 9 mm thick and weighs 803.6 gm. Each of the sides is decorated with a six-petalled rosette and is inscribed in Hebrew: Side 1 Bn Ksb' nsi Ysr'l wprnsw. Sm'wn Dswi. prs (clearer Ben Kosba Prince of Israel and his inscr.) administrator. Shime'on Dasoi. Half Side 2 Sm'wn bn Kwsb' nsi Ysr'l wprnsw. prs Shime'on ben Kosba Prince of Israel and his administrator. Half A similar weight was acquired by the Haaretz Museum in 1969, but was stolen in 1976 from the numismatic wing there. That weight was about half the weight of the H• 'Alim tablet. Two more weights were published by B. Lifschitz in ZDPV 92 (1976), weighing 210 and 205 gm respectively. We have, therefore, a set of lead weights inscribed in Hebrew from Bar Kokhba's time which weigh 205-210, 400 and 804-818 gm, all officially endorsed by Bar Kokhba's administration. REMAINS OF A SERAPIS CULT IN TEL AVIV by Jacob and Haya Kaplan (pp. 352-359) In 1964 an archaeological survey was carried out in the northern part of Tel Aviv-Yafo, which at that time was still largely untouched by building and road develop ment. The survey was conducted by the authors within the framework of the archaeological project of Tel Aviv Yafo begun in 1950. When development of the area began in 1976, a bull dozer penetrated the kurkar ridge and exposed four sites:</page><page sequence="16">208* ENGLISH SUMMARIES RS-1 — a cave with kokhim, Hellenistic and Roman periods; RS-2 — a burial cave of MBII; RS-3 — a rubbish pit, Hellenistic period; RS-4 — a rock-cut hollow with EBI material. This article deals with sites RS-1 and RS-3. a) RS-1 — a cave with 7 exceptionally large kokhim. Except kokh 1, all the kokhim were empty (save for a few sherds and animal bones). The remains date from two phases: 1) Hellenistic — late 2nd to early 1st century BCE. To this phase belong some isolated sherds, found on the chamber floor, in the kokhim, and especially in a hollow in front of kokh 1, as well as part of a coffin built of dressed stones containing cattle bones. 2) 1st century BCE to early 1st century CE. To this phase belong the finds originating mostly from kokh 1 and the hearth next to it: two large cooking pots, restored from sherds found in kokh 1, fragments of terra sigillata bowls (Augustan period), and of an Arretine plate stamped with the pot ter's signature (also Augustan period): L.ETTI/SAMIA. b) Rubbish pit RS-3: diameter ca. 3 m; the upper layer of dark earth mixed with ashes contained small bowl fragments, fish-plates, jars and a lamp of Hellenistic type — all from the late 2nd century BCE to early 1st century BCE. The pit belongs to the early phase of Cave Rs-1. Conclusions: 1) The absence of human bones and of human teeth, together with the cattle burial above the floor of the chamber, seem to indicate that the cave was hewn out specifically for animal burial. After the kokhim were filled and blocked off, the stone coffin was installed to provide an additional place for animal burial. The size of the kokhim and the cattle burial in a stone-built coffin, suggest the parallel with Egypt, where mummified animal burials connected with the cult of Serapis were found in such coffins. 2) Since the burial cave was found empty of its original contents and the hearth and the pottery of the second phase are dated to the late 1st century BCE to early 1st century CE, it is suggested that the cave had been cleared and occupied by people looking for shelter. Strabo, following on his topographical description of Jaffa, tells about 'robber' dens on the coast of Sharon(?). During this period the term 'robber' was also applied to the survivors of the Hasmoneans, sworn enemies of Rome and of King Herod. AN AYYUBID INSCRIPTION IN THE DOME OF THE ROCK by Myriam Rosen-Ayalon (pp. 360-370) In the Dome of the Rock, there is an inscription around the base of the drum that deserves attention. So far it has been mentioned by a few scholars, but it has not been discussed in detail. The text contains the first twenty-one verses of the Sürat Ta.Ha. of the Quran. Below the inscription is a decorative area with various motifs. Paleographically, the script illustrates very clearly the Ayyubid writing. However, the inscription bears some signs of several restorations. The evidence of these manipulations can be also found in some of the altera tions made in the accompanying lower row of ornamental designs. It can be seen that clearly these motifs suffered damage precisely at the spot corresponding to the re stored inscription. Both components — the inscription and the lower row of ornamental designs — are executed in glass mosaic, and contribute much valuable information to the history of the art of wall mosaics in the Ayyubid period, of which little is known. No date accompanies the inscription, but there seems to be enough circumstantial evidence to attribute it to Saladin himself, thus illustrating his contribution to the history of the Dome of the Rock.</page></plain_text>
