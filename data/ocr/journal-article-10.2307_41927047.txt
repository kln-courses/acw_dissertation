No one will contest the fact that Gandharan artists applied to Bud- dhist sculpture motifs borrowed from the Roman Empire, a fact historians have documented with the numerous examples from literature dealing with the political and economic ties existing in the second through the fifth century. A series of reliefs executed in the Kushan period in the north-west sector of Buddhist Central Asia demonstrate not only the connections between the classical and Buddhist worlds but to the near east as well.1 Seldom discussed in Gandharan art are the Hindu and pre-Aryan beliefs which Buddhism sought to supplant and only thinly veiled. Mainly the carvings represent separate episodes from the life of the Buddha or they illustrate Jataka tales, stories of his previous existences. They are tableaus consisting of a group of figures, usually four or five, although this number is not a hard and fast rule. On these reliefs, themes and techniques alike seem to have been borrowed from the Romans, brought possibly by Greco-Roman artists working in Gandhara.2 For instance, the triumphant entry pictured on Roman coins of the second and third century A.D.3 is paralleled by the Great Departure of the Buddha.4 The prostrate figure before the Buddha is known from a Trajanic frieze of the early second century A.D.6 The Buddha himself is modelled after the 1 Benjamin Rowland, "Rome and Gandhara", East West , Vol. 9, 3, Sept. 1958.

Corinthian capitals are ubiquitous in Bud- dhist and Roman art alike. The scenes are set in an architectural framework of columns supporting an architrave, a system related to Roman mural and scenic design,8 decoration on Roman sarcophogi,9 Imperial frieze sculpture,10 and retreating farther into the past, to Greek funerary sculpture.11 (Fig. 1) What distinguishes many of these architectonic frames from their classical predecessors is the device of isolating the framing columns from the scenes they are intended to separate. This is done by setting the column in a rectangular niche, frequently resting it on a ground line different from that of the figures. A panel in the Peshawar Museum has, in addition to the enclosing columns, two such extra columns as an additive element in the composition. (Fig. 2) Religious syncretism occuring in Gandharan art at this time may be responsible for the conglomerate representation on Buddhist works of iconography derived from other religions.12 In the ancient Near East, door posts were aniconic representations of guardian deities of the gate of heaven and/or the house of God.13 They seemed to be synonymous with the celestial door keepers appearing as early as the fourteenth century B. C. in an Akkadian epic. In Genesis 28:22, Jacob says, "And this stone which I have set for a pillar, shall be God's house." In Assyrian times, the pillar may have, on the one hand, represented the support of the sky, illustrated as a column 8 R. E. M.

On the other hand, it may, in many cases, represent the sacred tree. However, it does not appear to represent both the pillar of heaven and the sacred tree at one and the same time. More immediate was the influence of Mazdian and Zoroastrian Persian iconography on Buddhist art. For instance, the flames that emanate from the shoulders of Iranian kings are also accorded the image of the Buddha.16 They are a symbol of power and greatness. Persepolitan columns with their inverted lotiform capitals surmount- ed by animals find parallels in Indian cave sculpture and architec- ture as well as the Asokan columns. Hindu devotion is apparent in a stele fragment from Mathura where two devotees (or deities) stand beside a Siva lingam16 and another from the Charsadda district showing Siva and Nandi.17 Common to all Indian architecture were the unattached pillars called stambhas.18 These pillars could be permanently fixed or made portable for use in processions. They marked the entrances to large stupa areas and chaitya halls, labelled the places of significance in the history of Buddhism or marked the course of the Pilgrim's route.19 The original Asokan columns of which about ten of a probable thirty original are still extant, contrasted a plain circular tapered shaft rising about thirty or forty feet and bearing an inscription. They had no base and were topped by a lotiform capital superposed by a Buddhist symbol resting on an abacus. It is thought that their function may have been "to support the vault of heaven and to separate earth and sky so that man could live in an ordered world."20 Where the animal carries aloft the wheel of the Law, the entire pillar symbolizes the first turning of the wheel. It has been said that these pillars are expressive of man's worship of trees and among the trees of the forest. Examples of this ancient cult are shown by the pillar-like palm trees flanking many scenes on 14 E. D.

The importance of the structural column is expressed in the Ghaja jataka (no. 454) where a single column - upholds the city of Dvaravati, the world capital of Vasudeva.23 It represents, then, the Cosmic Tree and in turn may also be a substitute for the deity, Indra or Siva in the same way that the lingam is synonymous with Siva.24 Tree worship has been transformed in Buddhism into a pious reverence for the holy trees under which the Buddha was born, gained enlightenment and wisdom, preached, and died. Like the pillars, they mark the sacred places in his life.26 In the Lotus Sutra 26 the increasing wisdom of the bodhisattva is compared to the growth of trees. With the formulation of abstract Aryan symbolism, the ancient deep-rooted anthropomorphic and animistic beliefs in earth, sun, moon, fertility divinities, mythical heroes, etc. were never aban- doned but were incorporated into theistic Hinduism and Buddhism as a median between the phenomenal tactile world and the invisible ultimate reality.27 There is the wish-fulfilling tree (Jcalpa-vriksa or kalpa-taru)2* a symbol of life, growing in Indra's paradise, bearing the fruits of pleasure such as jewels and precious garments for the heavenly inhabitants.

The asoka tree symbolizes all nature dormant yet pregnant with new life and the tree goddess (vrilcsa-devata) is an inseparable counterpart to this tree.30 She is a "diminutive double" of the Great Mother. Her one arm entwines the tree trunk, the other bends down a branch. With one foot she gives the tree a gentle kick, thus trans- ferring her potency to the tree, only now able to bear fruit. These dryads are a recurring subject in Buddhist art, most familiar exam- ples being at Sanchi. They also appear on the Gandharan reliefs in the same role as columns, that is as separating motifs. (Fig. 3) The figures may be male (yaksa) or female (yaksini)*1 (Figs. 4 and 5) On both these reliefs, the deity stands on a water bowl on a pedistal. Five giant leaves issue form the head. In the Devi-Mahatmya ;,32 the goddess Durga declares, "Then, O Gods, I shall nourish the whole universe with these plants which support life and grow from my very body during the rainy season." The bowl (Kumbha), on the one hand, is a symbol of abundance33 and on the other, it holds the life-giving waters ( rasa ) .34 The Kalinga jataka (no. 479) tells how Ananda cleared a pit before the Jetavana gateway. In it he placed a golden jar filled with moistened earth. He dropped a seed into it and instantly a bo sappling sprang up fifty cubits tall. On the four sides and upwards shot 45 great bran- ches. In the ancient Near East, the full vase was held by a god or demigod, never a man.35 Likewise, it is probably a deity that stands upon the vase in the Gandharan reliefs. The significant fact is that, although Buddhism professed a revul- sion for many Hindu practices and called for revision of many Hindu beliefs, numerable ancient pre-Aryan and Vedic concepts were maintained. Not the least of these latter is the construction of an iconographical system wherein the tree, whether the cosmic tree or a 80 Zimmer, Myths , pp. 59-69. 81 Rosenfield has designated the one in the Kabul Museum (my Fig. 4) a devotee but its attributes, the vase on which he stands and the leaves sprout- ing from his head, suggest, rather an identification as a yaksa. Perhaps, the Kushan costume along with the the fruits and bowl he holds have been misleading. 82 Mircea Eliade, Patterns in Comparative Religion, Cleveland, 1958, p. 280. 83 Zimmer, Myths , p. 92. 84 Bosch, Ibid ., pp. 112-3. 85 Eliade, Ibid., p. 283.</page><page sequence="8">54 ERNESTA MARCHAND fertility symbol, is manifested as a deity. Both tree and deity are interchangeable with a column. The desire to spell out the historical moments in the life of the Buddha paralleled the similar development in Christian art.36 The result was a reflection of the Roman taste that swept more than half the known civilized world in the early centuries of the Christian era. Roman formats were readily accepted. First was the method of composition wherein figures were ranged in a kind of dialogue before the proscenium. Second was the costuming. Many of the figures in the reliefs are clad in the short tunic or pallium of the Roman style.37 However, it must be noted that the heterogeneous nature of the local population is witnessed by the Indian turbans and dhotis,38 or Iranian pointed caps, long belted jackets and baggy trousers.39 Third was the construction of the stage itself, generally limited in depth and bordered by classical columns. But the column, as represented on many of these Gandharan reliefs, expressed an inner meaning far beyond that of a composi- tional element in an arbitrary plan. It was highly significant and worthy of special emphasis. Whether it was sacred in itself or marked a sacred site, the artist used Indian or Roman models just as Persepolitan models were used for the Asokan pillars. 38 Hugo Buchtal, "The Common Classical Sources of Buddhist and Chri- stian Narrative Art", Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society , Parts 3 and 4, 1943. 87 Rowland, "Gandhara, Rome and Mat hura", Fig. 2. 38 Ibid ., Figs. 3 and 5. 39 Ibid ., Fig. 1.</page></plain_text>
