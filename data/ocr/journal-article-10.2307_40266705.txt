<plain_text><page sequence="1">BEAOE as BOYAH? By Ann Suter, Lafayette College Modern linguistics scholars seem in agreement that the Greek words in the semantic group péAoç/pâAAco and those in the group povArj/pov- Aojlmxi are derived from closely related Indo-European roots.1) They are in the congenial company of Plato on this point, who was the first, so far as we know, to suggest a semantic link between these two groups. In the Cratylus he comments that the words PovAeoOai, fîovAfj, âflovAia all have to do with fîoÀrj.2) That is, "to wish" or "be willing", "council" or "will", and "thoughtlessness" all have to do with a blow from a mis- sile. Modern linguists are more precise: Pierre Chantraine suggests the root *gwelH1»/*gwleH1- for the pâAAco group, and *gwel-/*gwol- for the PovAojiai group.3) Hjalmar Frisk accepts the initial labio-velar for pov- Aofiai, which, in his opinion, places it "without difficulty" alongside the PâAAû) group.4) Both Chantraine and Frisk take the basic meaning of the pâAAco group to be "throw", citing as a source for the development of the meaning "wish, will" of the PovAofiai group the Homeric phrases pâAAeaOai evi (pgeai/fiera (pçsai/êvi Ovjud).5) It is the purpose of this article to suggest an alternative source for the semantic specialization of these related roots; that is, to suggest an an- swer to the question: why are words meaning "throw, strike" etymologi- cally related to words denoting "will"?6) pâAAco /throw did not develop *) This article was first presented as a paper at the meeting of the American Philological Association in December 1983. Several colleagues offered advice: Richard Martin on the linguistics, etymologies and problems of Homeric diction involved; Amy Richlin on the rhetorical structure of the oral version; Leslie Shear on the iconographie problems. Prof. Martin offered useful suggestions on the final written version as well, as did the editors of Glotta. I am grateful to them all. Any infelicities which remain are my own. 2) Plato, Cratylus, 420. 3) Chantraine, Pierre, Dictionnaire étymologique de la langue grecque, Paris, 1968-80, sv pâAAco, PovAofiai. 4) Frisk, Hjalmar, Etymologisches Wôrterbuch, Heidelberg 1960-70, sv pâAAco, povAofiai. 5) Chantraine, sv fiovAofiai; Frisk, sv fiovAojiai.

The explanation for this is to be found in an early concept of divinity which is reflected in two artistic traditions: that of the diction of the Homeric poems, and that of an iconographie con- vention on coins, vase paintings and plaques. The concept is well-ex- pressed by Geoffrey Kirk.7) He remarks that one of the few things that differentiates the behaviour of the gods from that of humans in the Homeric poems is the gods' "special powers of remote operation". That is, the gods can exert their will from a distance. Both in the convention of Homeric diction and in that of archaic iconography, this exertion of will is expressed by the concept of throwing. It is useful first to examine in more detail the suggestion that the phrases pâXXeaOai èvi (pçEoi, èvi Ovjicp, fiera (pgeoi are the source for the semantic relationship between pâXXœ and fîovXojuai. It is my con- tention that the narrative contexts of these phrases do not provide for this semantic relationship;8) the meaning of "wish" or "will" is not pre- these two roots, which appears to be one of an enlargement through a laryngal. A useful discussion of the formal problems in the pâAAco group is to be found in Klaus Strunk, ,,Der Verbalstamm pePoArj- im epischen Griechischen" (Studies in Greek, Italic, and Indo-European Linguistics offered to Leonard R. Palmer, Inns- bruck 1976). Strunk notes in passing the blurred semantic lines of the pâAAco and PovAofiai groups in such Homeric phrases as nevOei . . . pepoAfjaro and â%£Ï...fl£- PoArffj,évoç (pp. 391 ff.), where the physical activity of striking is moving into the emotional and mental realm (see below, on the specialization of the active of pâAAco.) Another recent discussion of some of these problems is in S.R. Slings, "The etymology of povAo^ai and ocpeiAco", Mnemosyne XXVIII (1975) 1-16. He touches on the possible etymological connections between pâAAco and povAoftai : "povAopicu, since Kretschmer connected with pâAAco, has recently found a new home in PIE *gwel-..." (2-3). He does not explain his implication, however; that is, why such a home rules out a connection with pâAAco. He rejects (also without explanation) a possible semantic relation between the two groups as "the result of mere chance" (8-9), referring to P. Kretschmer, Gl. 3 (1912) and K. Forbes, Gl. 36 (1958), who argue, respectively, pro and contra a connec- tion between the two groups. In fact, all three scholars are responding to the po- sition (witnessed in Frisk and Chantraine, as noted above) that the Homeric phrases pâAAsaOai èvi (pçeou etc. provide the basis for linking the two groups se- mantically. I agree with Slings and Forbes that these phrases do not supply a rea- son for linking the two, but feel that other evidence does. 7) Kirk, Geoffrey, Myth, its Meaning and Functions, Cambridge and U. of Ca- lifornia, 1971, 33. He is supported in this by Athena herself at Od. 3.231: cela Oeôç y' êOéAcov xai rrfAôOev âvôça oaéom ... (A god, if he wishes, can save a man easily, even from far off.) 8) Indeed, Frisk comments that this is only acceptable with what he calls ,,a harsh displacement of meaning" ("starke Bedeutungsverschiebung"), sv.

The sense is uniformly "to consider",9) as in the most common line containing the phrase: âAAo 8é roi êgéco, où 8' évi (pgsai fiâAAso ofjoi (15x). (And I will say something to you, and do you consider (it) in your mind.) In another instance, Nestor speaks to his son Antilochos, as Antilochos is about to enter the horse race in the funeral games for Patroklos: àAX ays 8fj av, çiAoç jifjnv èfifiâAAeo Ovjud)...

Rarely the meaning may be extended, to "plan", for example, at Od. 11.248, where the ghost of Agamemnon speaks to Odysseus of Klytaimestra's deed: ôç ovx aivoregov xai xvvregov âAAo yvvaixôç fjng 8fj roiavra fiera cpgeaiv ëgya flâAîjmi. (There is nothing more dreadful and shameful than a woman who considers/plans such deeds in (her) mind.)

The active form, however, pâAAeiv êvi Ovvqj etc., does have the combined meaning of "throw" and "will".11) In all ten cases of these phrases in the active form, the image is that of throwing an emotion or an idea into a human or animal. 12) Zeus says of Achilles' horses: oçcoïv 8'év yovveaai PaAœ juévoç r)8' èvi Ov^cp (IL 17.45.: I will throw strength into their knees and heart.) The god wills the horses to be strong again. Or, in the 9) So Forbes (244): "... a phrase like pâXXeaOai êvi 0vjuû) means 'think about', not 'wish'...". 10) The line references for the phrases under consideration are: Iliad 1.297; 4.39; 5.259; 9.434-5; 9.611; 10.447; 14.50; 15.566; 16.444; 16.851; 20.195-6; 21.94; 23.313; Odyssey 11.428; 11.454; 12.217-18; 16.281; 16.299; 17.548; 19.236; 19.495: 19.570. u) Neither Frisk nor Chantraine mentions the active versions. Kretschmer (61-2) discusses the "Wunschpartikel" âflâÀ£(&lt; a fiâXè)y but without noting the significance of the active form. He cites the Homeric phrases with only the middle forms of flâAAco. n) The line references are: //. 3.139; 13.82; 16.529; 17.451; 19.485 = 23.260; Od. 1.200-1 = 15.172-3; 2.79; 19.10. Three additional occurrences of the phrase are found in the HAphr. (45; 53; 143 = //. 3. 139). Again, the object is abstract {ïfieçoç, juévoç) and the subject divine.</page><page sequence="4">BEAOI as BOY AH? 147 passage at Od. 1.200-1, where Athena in disguise is answering Telema- chos' questions about his father: avràç vvv roi éycb fiavreôoofiai, cbç êvi Bvfiœ/ âOâvaroi pâXXovoi xai cbç reXéeadai ôîco (But I will pro- phesy to you now, as the immortals throw it into (my) spirit and I think it will be accomplished so . . .) It is the divine will here both that she speak and what she speaks. In all these ten instances of the active form which uses the image of throwing as willing, the subject of the verb is a god or goddess. The middle form of the verb is used by both humans and gods in the sense of considering, but the active form, where the sense combines willing and throwing, is confined, in the Homeric poems, to divinities. This same specializations obtains in the usage of pâXXco/ (iâXXofiai without the phrases êvi 9vficp, etc.13) The vast majority of the verb's oc- currences in both the active and the middle have the straightforward meaning of throw or strike: throwing a cloak or sword around one's shoulders, or striking or being struck by a weapon in battle. When the object of the verb is abstract, however, when it is an emotion or condi- tion, then the verb is once again always active and the subject always a divinity.14) Apollo throws/wills strength into Aineas' chest at //. 5.513: fjxe, xai êv arrfOeaai juévoç jSaXe noifiévi Xacov (He came, and threw/ willed strength for the shepherd of the peoples.) Athena wills/throws sweet sleep upon the eyelids of various figures: . . . xai vnvovl rjôùv eni pXecpâgoiai pâXe yXavxœniç 'AOr/vrj. (And bright-eyed Athena threw/ willed sweet sleep upon their eyelids. Od. 1.363-4, et al.) Or, at //. 4.15-16, Zeus asks his fellow immortals: (pvXomv aivf/v 7 ' ogoofiev, fj (piAÔTTjra fief âjuçorépoioi pâXcofiev, (Shall we arouse dread battle, or throw/will friendship among them both?) This remarkably consistent specialization has only one exception: at Od. 2.79, Telemachos complains to the suitors that they have thrown fruitless pains into his spirit: vvv 8é fioi ânprjxrovç ôôvvaç êfipâXXere Ovfiœ. Otherwise, where forms of fiaXXco are used combining the senses of "willing" and "throwing", the form is active and the subject is a god or gods. This grammatical specialization reflects the concept of divinity which appears to be behind the image of "willing" as "throwing". An Homeric divinity exerts control over events from a distance by throwing what it 13) There are 73 forms in all; see Prendergast and Dunbar, Concordances to the Iliad and Odyssey; Lexicon des Frûhgriechisches Epos, sv paXXco. 14) 11.2.376; 4.16; 5.513; 21.547; Od 1.363-4 = 16.450-1 = 19.603-4 = 17.357-8; 14.269; 17.438. At //. 2.376, the direct object is not abstract, but Zeus is clearly willing unprofitable strife and quarrels for Agamemnon.</page><page sequence="5">148 Ann Suter wishes to accomplish - by throwing its will - into the person or situation it wishes to affect. The use of fiâAAû) in the active in Homeric diction is the verbal depiction of this concept. Iconographie depiction of this power is more difficult: how does the sculptor or painter make it clear that what is happening on the coin or vase is the will of the god or goddess standing near-by? How does the artist depict divine will in action? At least as early as the archaic period, artists visualized divine will as the god's winged soul that could fly from one place to another. Sometimes the will took the form of a winged creature standing on a figure's arm or shoulder, or hovering near; some- times it took the form of a winged object, a branch, or anything that could be sent flying through the air to work the will of the sender from afar. Examples of both types are combined in the striding figure of Zeus, holding in one hand this thunderbolt, and, in the other out- stretched, his eagle. A fully anthropomorphic example is Hermes with his winged feet, the messenger of Zeus who flies through space to work his master's will.15) Aphrodite retains her will in purely winged form, in the small erotes which so often accompany her on vase paintings. Apollo, lord of the bow, is iconographically a combination of these types: he wreaks his will with a winged missile, the arrow. Apollo's arrows are also represented in Homeric diction as objects which express the will of a divinity. They not only do his will on the narrative level, but their nature as missiles, and their purpose as the god's will, are specifically combined in his epithets èxrfPôAoç, éxatT]pô- Xoç and éxarTjPsAétTjç.16) They reflect his character as the god who 15) See, e.g., silver coins from Kaulonia (c. 550 B.C.) showing inter alia small winged figures on outstreched arms of deities; and a votive terra cotta pinax from Calabria (mid 5th a), showing Aphrodite confronting Hermes with a small winged Eros on her outstretched arm. Both the coins and the pinax are repro- duced in A. B. Cook, Zeus, A Study in Ancient Religion, Cambridge University Press, 1925. Part 2, Vol. 2, (Appendix G) 1041-1043. See also bronze votive figures of Zeus (from Olympia, c. 520 B.C. and 480-470 B.C., inter alia), and a stater from Elis, c. 470 B. C, reproduced in W. Schwabacher, "The Olympian Zeus before Phidias", Arch. (1961) 104 ff.; a proto-Corinthian lecythos showing Zeus and his thunderbolt (2nd quarter 7th c.) and Hermes with winged feet on an amphora from Melos, c. 600 B.C., both reproduced in Karl Schefold, Myth and Legend in Early Greek Art, London, 1966, (Fruhgriechische Sagenbilder, Munchen 1964), figs. 4 (Zeus) and 45 (Hermes). These examples are among the earliest of the iconographie specialization of the péXea - or instruments of will - of different divinities. Later examples are, of course, readilv available. 16) The éxa - portion of the epithets presents a problem. Is it connected with éxcbv (willingly) or with êxâç (from afar) ? It is most probably, according to Frisk and Chantraine, connected with éxcov. This gives a meaning to the epithets of</page><page sequence="6">BEAOI as BOY AH? 149 strikes from afar. His fléXea are not only the instruments of his /SovXrj; they are, on the levels of iconography, literary imagery, and etymology, identical with his fiovXij}7) This offers another perspective on the phrases paXXeoOai or pâXXsiv êvi (pgsoi, etc. Just as Apollo's epithets combine the ideas of "willing" and "throwing", so the Homeric contexts of fiâXXsiv êvi (pgeoi, etc., show this combined sense. Willing from afar is the perquisite of gods alone, and the image for this is the sending out of a winged or flying ob- ject. The middle, pâXXsaOai êvi (pgsoi, on the one hand, means "consi- der", in one or two instances, "plan", "to toss something around in one's mind". The image here is one of throwing alone, and has nothing to do with will. The middle is used because the action of the verb is directed towards the subject of the verb; the locus of the verb's action is within one person; no one's will is being exerted on another's. This throwing image is used by both humans and divinities. The active pâXXeiv, on the other hand, is carefully confined to gods, and reflects the archaic image, both iconographie and verbal, of how a god exercises its will. "he who strikes willingly", which perhaps does not make much sense when used of a god. Or, it could mean "he who strikes what he wills" - that is, "he who stri- kes purposefully", but this way of combining the two words adjusts the meaning of &amp;rtyvfrom its ordinary passive sense to an active one. In any case, it seems that the prefix éxa-, whatever its etymology, was understood by the poets of the Iliad to be connected with èxâç and to mean "from afar". Frisk and Chantraine (sv. exrjfioAoc), cite Iliad 5.54 to support this: ovôè éxTjfioÀiai jjoiv tô ngiv y' èxéxa- oto (and not the spearcasts from afar with which formerly he excelled . . .)■ The context here surely supports their contention; "the willing spearcasts" make little sense. 17) The name of the goddess Hekate is suggestive in this context. Apparently originally a goddess from Asia Minor, she was given a name by Greeks who adopted her into their scheme of things (Nilsson, Martin, Geschichte der Griechi- schen Religion, Munchen 1941-50, Vol. 1, 722 ff; Hesiod, TheogonyWX. See also Deborah Boedeker, TAPhA 113 (1983) 79-93, on her fundamental position in Hesiodic, and perhaps also Indo-European theology). On the etymology of the name, Frisk cites (sv èxarrjpeXé rrjç) Wilamowitz's opinion (among others') that it is from a language of Asia Minor and adapted by folk etymology to Greek èxâç. Chantraine (sv 'Exarrf) is concise in his opposition: "La forme originelle devait comporter un digamma initial comme ëxaroç. Pas de raison de supposer que la forme même soit un emprunt. Féminin de ëxaroç ...". "Exaroç is an epithet of Apollo also in the Iliad (1.385; 7.83; 20.71,295), and it is interesting to note that Aeschylos (Supp. 676) uses èxâxr] as an epithet of Artemis, the other (with Apollo) divine archer.</page></plain_text>
