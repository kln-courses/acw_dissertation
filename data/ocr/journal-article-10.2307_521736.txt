The general criticism levelled at the novel not only by the authorities but also by sympathetic readers was that it was ?improper&gt;&gt;, strange, confusing; readers were disoriented by this novel that seemed to be quite innocent orNhe surface. It related the perambulations of an anonymous narrator in the streets of Cairo after his release from prison in no more than a hundred or so odd pages. The Smell of It represents a break in the history of Egyptian narrative. Relating his experience upon reading the novel, Yusuf Idris succintly describes its impact on him in his ?&lt;introduction&gt;&gt; to it: This is not a novel but rather, let us say, a slap, a cry, a strong awakening moan that almost stirs' terror. The real hero in this novel is a general overwhelming feeling which has no name. The author himself does not name it and I feel embarassed myself trying to find a name for that general feeling that Son'allah has carved, created and introduced into the scope of art and literature. It is not a feeling of strangeness or disgust or loss or rebellion or desire for ten- derness or yearning for existence. It is a different feeling.1 33</page><page sequence="3">In this passage Yusuf Idris, a sensitive writer and perceptive literary critic, has given us the germ of what may be called avant-garde art. Firstly, it negates the traditional forms - &lt;&lt;this is not a novel&gt;&gt; - and, secondly, by negating the traditional forms, it defamiliarizes reality and evokes in the reader a different feeling, an experience that is quite unprecedented; so much so that there is no name for it, no word that could describe it, not even a neologism; it remains perforce unnamable. The rejection of traditional forms implies the rejection of the society that produced these forms, and the aim of this rejection is to awaken the reader to a new reality or, at least, to the necessity for a new reality. Avant-garde literature in Egypt is a literature which is deeply rooted in the social reality, a literature which is &lt;&lt;engag6e&gt;&gt;, and aims at criticizing reality as much as-if not more than-at expressing it. Within the last twenty years, the role of this avant-garde literature has been one of contestation and an overt critique of the repressive social order. The paradoxical situation of the avant-garde writers was their con- frontation with the 1952 Revolution in Egypt that was to realize their dreams and fulfill their expectations. The failure of the Nasserist revo- lution to create the ideal society these writers were dreaming of brought about a deep feeling of frustration and triggered an era of suspicion, a suspicion not only of the traditional forms and traditional society but also of the present society and its self-expression in language. The gap that existed between the traditional forms of fiction and reality was similar to that existing between society and its self-expression in a dis- course which claimed to be the discourse of truth, while it was in reality a discourse of mystification and deceit; words did not mean what they were meant to mean. It is my assumption in this paper that the new wri- ting of the avant-garde was motivated as much by the negation of this discourse of truth as it was by the negation of traditional forms of wri- ting. What it was negating was the fiction of language as much as the language of fiction. To present an analysis of a negative text we have to contrast it with the text it negates in order to elucidate the broader articulations of that negation. There is no doubt that Son'allah Ibrahim's The Star of August, which appeared four year after The Smell of It and developed further those traits which characterize the latter, could be contrasted with the novels of a traditional novelist like Najib Mahfuz but the pro- cess of negation becomes more overt and significant when we oppose 34</page><page sequence="4">The Star of August to a text that claims to be true to reality but which is actually fictionalized. The process of mystification is more active when the reader is confronted with a text that claims to represent truth than when he is confronted with one that admits to being fictive. The mechanisms of what Marie-Laure Ryan has called &lt;&lt;the principle of minimal departure&gt;&gt;2 are here suspended; the self-defence mechanisms against illusion are restrained; the process of allegorical interpretation accompanying the reading of fiction is cast aside and the reader presu- mably submits unconditionally to a sense of mystification or, at least, this is what he is meant to do since these texts' underlying assumption is that the reader is in a way infantile and credulous, incapable of making the distinction between fact and fiction.3 The Star of August was conceived as a negation of a text written by Son'allah Ibrahim himself and two other writers: Kamal al Qilish and Rauf Mis'id. The three writers went to visit the site of the Aswan High Dam in the summer of 1966, the year following the diversion of the Nile that was to witness the last flood of the river; on their return they wrote a &lt;&lt;reportage&gt;&gt; of their visit. The text, published in 1967, entitled The Man of the High Dam, aimed at presenting first-hand information from eye-witnesses on the work of erecting the High Dam. The reportage or documentary is the prototype of what we might call the discourse of truth; it refers to an extra-textual reality which may be verified. The text aims at a correlation between signifier, signified and referent; it does not aim at creating an alternate possible world as in fic- tion but at reproducing the real world as it is. I would like to argue that, in their work, the authors have- consciously or unconsciously-worked towards the mystification of their readers by processes familiar in the discourse of fiction and that the novel The Star of August is, in a way, generated negatively by this text. It is a demystification of the language of The Man of the High Dam which one might call the &lt;&lt;pre-text&gt;&gt; and, by demystifying the language, it defamiliarizes the reality that it presents whereas the pre-text was aiming at a more profound familiarization and acceptance. It seems as if there were an interchange between the two texts, perhaps even an exchange of personality: the fictive discourse becomes factual while the factual discourse becomes fictive; or one could even call it a split in per- sonality: the public discourse is mystifying while the private discourse of art is demystifying.4 35</page><page sequence="5">The text and the pre-text center around the Aswan High Dam: an object of great magnitude and of an even greater controversy in all pos- sible contexts, an object around which intersected tensions and vital issues, major struggles and confrontations. The Aswan High Dam was the point of confrontation between man and nature. It was a climax to the long line of direct struggles between the Nile and the people of the Valley of the Nile and thus entered into the realm of modern mythology. The Aswan High Dam was also, in the arena of modern life, the point of confrontation between man and machine. It meant the shift of a whole society from an agricultural stage to an industrial one. The very crux of these two confrontations is that they center around the process of change as the result of struggle. The Aswan High Dam was, on the other hand, one of the arteries of the 1952 Revolution. The project started in October 1952, three months after the coup d'etat in July 1952, and was completed in 1970, the year of Nasser's death. It thus became the focus for the concentration of a number of forces among which we can cite: the industrialization of Egypt which would entail the transformation of the country from a poor, underdeveloped, agricultural society into a rich, technologically- advanced, industrial one. The industrialization process was presented as a battlefront of equal importance to the military battlefront against Israel and imperialism.5 During the two decades involving the process of the erection of the High Dam, it came to symbolize a number of cultural, social, political and even industrial &lt;&lt;semes&gt;&gt;.6 The High Dam became the symbol of: the will of a people, the self-sacrificing capacity and power of a people, the self-determination of a people, the inspired and charismatic leadership of Nasser, the mobilization of a people, the establishment of socialism, the possibility of establishing humane cooperation between countries, a unified and homogeneous society, the struggle against imperialism, the advent of prosperity, the ascending forces of history, the conquest of nature. 36</page><page sequence="6">This list of what one might call the semes of the High Dam as symbol is by no means exhaustive. The mythical discourse that was woven around the High Dam grew as the process of construction proceeded and the discourse itself attained the proportions of its gigantic object. But, in a way, the discourse itself replaced the object, thus blurring the vision and distorting reality. The High Dam became the emblem of the Nasserist revolution and Nasser's death was reflected on the emblem that represented him. The High Dam became the nucleus around which denasserization was undertaken, the greatest achievement of all times was debased, belittled; it was described as a blunder, a mistake; it ruined the environment which had not been properly studied and, besides, it had not solved the problems it was supposed to remedy, had not ful- filled the promises and-above all-was a disappointment. The battle had been lost on all fronts. The year 1967 saw Egypt's military defeat and, with Nasser's death, the High Dam-as symbol-crumbled. Son'allah Ibrahim belongs to the generation of the High Dam buil- ders. They set all their hopes on it; it stood as the personification of what they believed in. They were truly fascinated by it. The High Dam provided that generation with the feeling of fulfillment and of &lt;buil- ding&gt;&gt; as well as a sense of direction leading towards social and eco- nomic transformation. However, the &lt;text&gt;&gt; of the High Dam, the mythical discourse that had been woven around it, and which the buil- ders helped weave, was a means of mystification. The ideology of the 1952 Revolution informed such texts. Side by side, for over twenty years, and standing in opposition, were the High Dam and the text of the High Dam. In turning now to our two texts, the reportage The Man of the High Dam and the novel The Star of August, I would like to analyse the ways in which the first text creates an object of mystification while the second creates a discourse of demystification. This is actually achieved by pro- cesses of familiarization on the one hand, and defamiliarization on the other. Son'allah Ibrahim has, in his novel, recreated the High Dam; in a way, he has disentangled the object itself and reinstated it in reality. Art is truth while reportage is deceit. Both texts are structured on the model of the journey and might each be entitled: &lt;&lt;Itinerary from Cairo to Abu Simbel&gt;&gt;. The journey as a structural element is recurrent in literature and may have different functions. It is a mode of discovery of an unknown world; it is the major mode of &lt;&lt;depaysement&gt;&gt;; the character is dislocated, removed 37</page><page sequence="7">from his natural, familiar, secure environment and placed in a new, unfamiliar, alien environment. In this alien locus he experiences trans- formations, changes; he discovers himself, and with the discovery of a new world external to himself he discovers a new self. The journey is as much an exploration of a new internal world as the exploration of a new outer world. A. The &lt;&lt;Pre-text&gt; In the text of the reportage the main function of the journey-the function of depaysement-is cancelled; the dislocation effect is annulled by a process of familiarization: the unfamiliar is described in terms of the familiar. The main device that is used is personification. As the title of the book indicates - The Man of the High Dam -the text tends to reconcile the object and the subject. It establishes a relationship between the subject-Man-and the object-The High Dam. The relationship is set in the grammatical structure of the genitive possession-idafa-that links the two substantives: Man and the High Dam. In this structure, the first member of the genitive construction-the mudaf-is, on the one hand, determined by its annexation to the second member-the mudaf illayhi- and, on the other, it becomes the possessed while the second member is the possessor. In this context, the genitive of possession likewise con- veys the idea of agency and production as in the syntagm &lt;&lt;the novel of Son'allah Ibrahim&gt;&gt; where the genitive construction entails both posses- sion and production. That Man is therefore owned and is also a product of the High Dam; if Man has built the High Dam, the High Dam has also built this new man, a &lt;&lt;humane&gt;&gt; new man. The High Dam has, in this context, a humanizing power for the word &lt;&lt;insan&gt;&gt; (human) has all the connotations of all the values attached to human compassion: civi- lity, kindness, benevolence, spirituality. It is also opposed to the word &lt;&lt;hayawan&gt;&gt; (animal) which is antithetical to it. The process of personification and humanization governs the text from its opening stanza which is a poem by the well-known Egyptian poet Abd al-Rahman al Abnudi entitled &lt;&lt;Ode to the High Dam&gt;&gt;: I feel that the arm of the High Dam Needs some of my blood.7 The exchanige of blood between the poet and the High Dam humanizes the Dam as the Dam had humanized man. 38</page><page sequence="8">The first chapter of the book entitled &lt;&lt;The Market Place&gt;&gt; introduces the reader, who has started his journey by opening the book and reading the first page, into an all too familiar locus-a locus of popular festivities and human interchange. The narration is introduced through the second person pronoun which indicates a hearer and a message implicating the reader in an act of communication and involving him in the situation described. It moves him to engage himself in the dialogue and to immerse himself in the situation. It is used as an invitation addressed to the reader by the narrators to accompany them on their voyage of dis- covery. But, from the very start, the narrators are careful not to dislo- cate their fellow travellers; they start from the familiar and guide them carefully to the unfamiliar: For a moment it will seem to you that you are entering a familiar world similar to that of the little cities scattered along the green stretch of the valley from the north to the south ... but you will open your eyes in amazement when you confront the new city of Aswan... this new city of Aswan is the site of a battle between the river and the city, between the old city and the new city.8 However, the narrators feel that though they are introducing their reader into a new world, they must first reassure him that deep inside the new Aswan still lies the old Aswan, and that nothing has in effect changed: The heart of the city has not changed since the days of the Pharaohs. In those days the city was called Suwant meaning al suq, the market. The dark granite has proven that it is-till now at least-stronger than the machine.9 What is valorized in this text is permanence as opposed to change. The narrators are here emphasizing the perennial value of Aswan as a city that has managed to survive from the times of the Pharaohs to the modern era, and is still surviving the battle against industrialization. The process is reiterated when the travellers reach the site of the High Dam itself: It is as if you were suddenly entering one of the popular quarters of Cairo.10 39</page><page sequence="9">It seems that the narrators are careful at every step to reassure their reader that what he is about to experience is not different from what he has experienced before. The process of familiarization is achieved through a number of tropes, mainly metaphors and similes, based on anthropomorphism. What could be closer to the reader than his own body? Aswan is humanized and is equated with man himself. At the end of the day &lt;&lt;Aswan puts her head on her arms of granite and sleeps as if nothing in the world was worth being awakened for&gt;&gt;.11 Also, the road leading to High Dam &lt;&lt;sweats during the daytime, but at night it stretches and opens its infinite heart to you and sighs with you&gt;&gt;.12 Not only are the city and the road anthropomorphized but the machine is likewise transformed into human form. The trucks returning from a day's work are compared to wounded soldiers returning from the battlefield waiting to be attended to in the hospital (the garage) while others are convalescing, and still others, after being cured, are awaiting their orders to return to the battlefield. The process of metaphorization which binds setting (city, road) and man, object (machine) and man, also extends into another dimension, namely, present and past. The High Dam is compared to the Pyramids and to the Sphinx, and the concrete that is poured daily into the cons- tructions is described as a daily meal offered to the High Dam which devours it as the Sphinx devoured its victims. Sidqi Sulayman, the minister of the High Dam, is compared to a pharaonic statue which has just been rescued from one of the temples of Aswan, &lt;&lt;an ancient dark giant of the colour of the stone and the hardness of granite.&gt;&gt; The valoriza- tion of the present in terms of its resemblance to the glorious past is still another process of familiarization. However, this process is, at the same time, a means of mystification. As Michel LeGuern has shown in his study of metaphor,13 the referential function of language, the function that refers the discourse to the context of reality which is external to both the speaker and the hearer, is attenuated when metaphorization is used, when we pass from the literal meaning to the figurative meaning. Metaphor is used also in the traditional mode, to wit: for adornment, liveliness, elucidation or agreeable mystification. And it is this last function that is at work in the text of The Man of the High Dam. Metaphor is used to transform reality from what it is to what it is not, mainly by changing what is not agreeable or not acceptable into some- thing agreeable; by transforming a reality which is alien and novel into a reality which is familiar and everlasting. It is a freezing process which is used in those types of discourse which aim at blocking the process of transformation and motion. 40</page><page sequence="10">The transformation of reality is further emphasized by another trope, hyperbole, which is used to amplify reality and thus anchors an image of it albeit a distortive one.14 Hyperbole is a figure which is, in a way, mathematical: it adds value or dimension to the object. It is obvious that the High Dam by its very nature invites such a trope. But in the text of The Man of the High Dam the trope overflows from the object itself to permeate all the other semantic fields of the text. The semantic field in which the contamination manifests itself most clearly is the field of human action. Action is amplified into heroism and the outcome of the struggle is presented as victory and exemplary achieve- ment. At this point, the two main axes around which the text is structured emerge: the axis of figurative language and the axis of the dynamics of the text, that is, the resolution or non-resolution of the tensions in the text. The axis of figurative language is used, as has been previously men- tioned, to blur the reality of the object. The discourse that results from this use is a highly opaque discourse. According to Todorov, an opaque discourse is opposed to a transparent discourse: The discourse without figures of speech is a completely transparent discourse and thus non-existent. Then the figure of speech appears as a drawing imposed on this transparency, a drawing that permits for the first time apprehension of the discourse in itself and not as a mediator of significance. The true character of the discourse that is called today poetical makes it opaque as clothes on an invisible body and allows it to be seen for the first time.15 Although I tend to disagree with Todorov in his equation of opaque and poetical discourse, I do agree with him as far as his distinction bet- ween opaque and transparent discourse in their relation to their referent goes. The opaque discourse calls attention to itself and effaces the referent; the transparent discourse tends to efface itself in order to establish the referent in its place. I also agree with him on the role of figurative lan- guage in the making of opaque discourse. Language, in this instance, creates a fiction, becomes a fiction severed from its referent, and stands as a construction in its own right. 41</page><page sequence="11">The opacity of the text of The Man of the High Dam stems from another process aside from the use of figurative speech, namely, from the presence of the subject of the enunciation in the discourse.16 In a way, the speaker forces his subjectivity on the hearer who has to oblite- rate his own and adopt that of the speaker. The narrators are creating a narrative situation where the reader has to identify with their point of view. The narrative that started with the second person singular shifts to the first person plural. In a way, the reader is tempted to assimilate himself to the group, to the &lt;&lt;we&gt;&gt; and to become part of the community created by the narrators in their text; the High Dam's society is the society where the &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; melts in the ?&lt;we&gt;&gt;. The nature of this collective subjectivity is of an affective type; the text abounds in what Pierre Gui- raud has called locutive messages17 expressing the comments, judge- ments and feelings of the narrators. The locutive dimension of the text blurs its predicative dimension so that the primary message of the text- its denotative, objective significance-is totally taken over by a connota- tive, subjective significance. The reader is immersed in the affective &lt;&lt;we&gt;&gt; identity and loses the critical perspective of individual rationality. I would like to pursue this argument a step further and add that the dissolution of the individual &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; and its integration into the collective identity of the &lt;&lt;we&gt;&gt; is a way of solving the alienation of the &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; and its isolation. This is also achieved in the text by the resolution of all the tensions of the narrative and adds to the mystification since no narrative can reach this type of resolution except in a utopian world or in a comic narrative mode where all tensions are resolved without Icaving any residue. The world of the High Dam is presented as an ideal possible world, a utopia where man and machine live happily every after. All tensions are solved: man has conquered nature, he has forced the machine to submit to his will. There is a perfect levelling of the social tensions; the High Dam was able to create a perfect model to which all the individual &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt;s had to conform: ministers, engineers, workers, Egyptians, Russians, sa'idis, proletarians, even capitalists all undergo transformation and conform to the model. The merging of all these elements into a harmonious whole is extended to language; the utopia has a language of its own, in this case, a language peculiar to the High Dam: a composite of Arabic and Russian. The world of the High Dam is the perfect world. If we analyze the syntagm: al sadd al 'ali we notice that the connotations attached to the first element: sadd (obstacle, obstruction, barrier, barricade) are dis- carded while the connotations of the second element: 'ali (high, ele- 42</page><page sequence="12">vated) are put to full use and could be considered the main paradigm around which the text is structured. The root &lt;&lt;'lw&gt;&gt; implies the semantic field of perfection, elevation, loftiness and the derivatives from this root comprise signifieds such as: sublime, exalted, outstanding, etc. Fur- thermore, the root &lt;&lt;'lw) is a composite of the syntagm: al mathal al a'la (the Ideal) and an equation is posed, i.e., al sadd al 'ali = al mathal al a'la. Also the world of the High Dam is not an independent possible world grafted on the larger Egyptian society but acts as a synechdoche; the part is equivalent to the whole and the general conclusion of the narra- tive is that the High Dam is my country: al sadd baladi. The reader is led on a journey to utopia that has lulled all his suspicions; a journey of illusion and delusion from which he has to be awakened. B. The &lt;&lt;Text?) Three years after the publication of The Man of the High Dam, in the year of Nasser's death in 1970, Son'allah Ibrahim's novel The Star of August appeared. It is, in its own right, the inversion of the text that had preceded it, and negates all the devices of mystification that pre- vailed in the official discourse. By using defamiliarization, the novel was aiming at restoring the referents in place of their signifiers and also at dismantling the symbolic apparatus that stood between the reader and reality. The first question that comes to mind is that of the interpretation of the novel's title. What is the Star of August? What does it represent? What does it symbolize? The star appears only at the end of the novel-on page 225-and does not stand for anything but itself: At seven thirty the only star appeared. It seemed to me that it was moving west. Then it stopped. I thought of rising and asking someone about it. The Rayyis must know it. Maybe it was Sirius which used to appear to the Ancient Egyptians at the time of the flood or maybe it was the famous Big Bear that guided navigators and wanderers. But I did not have the energy or the enthusiasm to rise and I felt that any answer I would get would not change matters.18 The narrator's process of thinking about the star he sees in the sky on an August night is the matrix around which the text is structured. The experience of the vision of the star is an immediate one and the different 43</page><page sequence="13">interpretations are rejected one after the other as useless; even the proper names that could identify the star are of no consequence. The star is apprehended in itself, in its physical existence. Objects are to be presented without mediation. The text then tends towards the imme- diate presentation of the physical world, a physical world that stands for its own sake and is not interpreted, and the question arises: should we interpret it at all? On the first page of the novel, the narrator boards the train that is to take him from Cairo to Aswan. Sitting behind a closed window he sees people standing on the platform; he cannot hear what they say.19 He does not try to guess what they are saying or to understand what they are doing; he remains at the surface of the physical world and does not try to penetrate beyond this surface. The text of The Star of August is as resistant as the window-pane, and as transparent. It is resistant because the reader is not allowed to penetrate the surface of the physical world; what the narrator presents to him is only what can be apprehended by the senses. Thus, the text has no depth; there is nothing beyond the world of objects. On the other hand, the text is as transparent as the window-pane; it exemplifies what has been described as transparent discourse: it is systematically stripped of all tropes20 and tends towards a type of innocent and neutral dis- course which Barthes has termed &lt;writing degree zero&gt;&gt; where language effaces itself to let the referent emerge in total &lt;objectivity&gt;&gt;. It is also transparent in the sense that it is severed from the subject of the enun- ciation. The various functions of language are set aside to allow the referential function, and the referential function only, to be assumed by the text. The text is taken over by the referent to such an extent that it becomes iconic, i.e., it becomes a diagram of the object. The overall structure of the novel tends towards an iconic represen- tation of the High Dam. It could be represented in the shape of a step pyramid: Part II Core 4 4 3 3 Part I2 Part III L! 44</page><page sequence="14">The first part, divided into four chapters numbered 1 to 4, describes the various steps of the High Dam's construction: 1. Excavating. 2. Blasting. 3. Moving. 4. Dumping. The subject of each one of these operations is a piece of equipment: 1. Excavators. 2. Dynamite. 3. Dump trucks. 4. Bulldozers. The second part of the novel covers only 13 pages and consists of an uninterrupted interior monologue. The third part reproduces the four operations of the first part but in descending order and describes the dismantling of the Nubian temples. The diagram of the novel is similar in form to that of the High Dam: the first part represents the upstream face of the dam while the second part represents the impermeable core and the third part the downstream face. The High Dam is to emerge in its objective reality. The general structure of the novel re-establishes the High Dam as an object as opposed to the High Dam as a signifier. The iconic structure of the novel creates a distance between the reader and the object: the object as an independent part of reality that exists outside the apprehending self. This distance is a process of defa- miliarization which has become one of the characteristics of modern art. The subject does not identify with the object but remains detached from it, empathy is cancelled and the self becomes alienated from the object. The defamiliarization is further corroborated by the nature of the actants21 in the novel and their relations. The machine is one of the actants of the novel and the textual space occupied by the machine is as extensive as that occupied by human actants. The presence of the machine as an autonomous actant places two constraints on the text: first, it implies a mechanical causality that dehumanizes the text and, second, it cancels internal space. The machine functions only in external 45</page><page sequence="15">space and does not possess any &lt;&lt;interiority&gt;&gt; or subjectivity. The machine is the model of all the other actants: all are described in terms of their outer appearance. The narrator has no way of penetrating into the internal space of the other characters; the text is stripped of all psychological analysis: only what can be apprehended by the senses is presented. The human as well as the physical world remains uninter- preted. The window-pane stands between the narrator and the other characters as it stands between the reader and the text. The world of The Star of August is dehumanized. The narrator himself is dehumanized, his subjectivity is suspended. He presents himself to the reader as he presents the other characters. He describes his actions from the outside as though he were an automaton. In the train, the narrator-who is not named throughout the novel- describes his minutest gestures in closing the door of the compartment: I got up and went to the door, turned the metal handle; it turned in my hand. The door opened towards me. I closed it again and secured it with the hanging metal chain. I returned to my place by the window.22 Though narration is conducted in the first person singular, what emerges from the text is a subject devoid of subjectivity. The narrator introduces himself as a &lt;you&gt;&gt; not as an &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt;; as any other self would have apprehended him from the outside and not as a self-conscious subject. He does not analyse himself or conduct any introspection; he does not comment on his actions as he does not comment on the other characters' actions. By cancelling his interiority he destroys the basic characteristic of the &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt;, namely the continuity of consciousness.23 This type of narrative is diametrically opposed to the interior mono- logue technique where only the internal space is presented in the text. In objective narration, only actions and gestures are presented; reality becomes somehow the sum of external relations. The feeling of defami- liarization is amplified when the physical gestures which are not part of consciousness are described by the subject himself. Also, a person de- scribing outer reality does not include himself in his perception: he per- ceives but does not perceive himself perceiving, unless the ego of the subject is split. Thus, the process of defamiliarization is achieved by transforming an unreflective consciousness into a reflective one. 46</page><page sequence="16">What is the nature of the actions and gestures which are described? These are mainly minute actions and small gestures that make up the core of one's daily life. Verbs such as: I woke up, I went to sleep, I entered, I came out, I lit a cigarette, etc. are repeated over and over again. Behaviour is analyzed into its smallest components and recorded in its minutest details. This is, for example, how the narrator describes drinking a sip of water in the train's compartment: There was a small rack next to the window on which there was a tumbler; below was a faucet of water and a metal panel which I pulled down out of the wall. It was converted into a basin. I filled the glass and raised it to my mouth. The water was warm, and I contented myself with only one sip. I let the water from the faucet collect in the bottom of the basin until it became full. Then I pushed it back into its place in the wall. I listened to the sound of the water as it drained towards the outside.24 It becomes obvious that seemingly quite unimportant events, such as drinking a sip of water, acquire an exaggerated importance. Ortega y Gasset has noted that in order to dehumanize it is not necessary to alter the inherent nature of things, it is enough to invert the order of impor- tance and create an art in which events of minimal importance in life loom up monumentally in the foreground.25 The uneasiness generated by the novel is in part the outcome of a process of defamiliarization at work in the text but it is also generated by the coercive power of the text. It is quite obvious that the transparency of the text is not as innocent as it seems. Internal space is not totally cancelled: it is repressed. The residues are created by the tensions at work on the surface of the text and these are not resolved or dissolved. Rather they are transferred from the surface of the text to its depth. Son'allah Ibrahim has presented this dichotomy between surface level and deep level by creating a totally new form in the novel. We find more than one level of narration. First, we find the main- stream of the narrative or the surface level which deals with the con- struction of the High Dam in bold print; second, we find the undercur- rent of the narrative or the deep level in small print. The surface level seems to pressure the deep level repressing it in such a way that one can sense the repression work in both the size of the text (always a small one-paragraph text) and in the size of the print. The undercurrent of the narrative-or deep level-consists of the narrator's dreams on the one hand, the interior monologue that forms the second part of the novel 47</page><page sequence="17">and represents the impermeable core of the dam and, on the other, those independent sub-texts which are inserted in small print (repressed form) at various points in the mainstream of the narrative. The connection between the sub-texts and the surface level is absolutely fortuitous and totally unmotivated by the text, there being no obvious connection between the mainstream and the sub-texts. The reader is disoriented and does not find any logical or narrative causality in these shifts. The only motivation is the complete rupture between internal and external space; between public and private life, between perception and self- consciousness. The dichotomy is actually the result of the work of cen- sorship at both the individual (dreams) and collective level (social and political critique). The sub-texts represent the repressed dreams of society: they revolve around four axes-art, social conflicts, the totalitarian state and the cult of the personality. At this level of his novel, Son'allah Ibrahim created another iconic diagram, that of coercion. On the surface is a neutral, transparent, innocent discourse aiming at presenting reality in its objectivity but, at the deep level, this transparent discourse seems to conceal a turmoil of coerced forces: art as a subversive force that has to be repressed, unre- solved social conflicts, the tyranny of the totalitarian state and the cult of the personality. The coercive discourse does not ultimately eliminate other discourses, it only represses them. In The Star of August the sur- face discourse is made meaningful by what it omits rather than by what it includes. Arabic literature is at a crossroads at the present time. The issues that face literature today are above all epistemological. Literature is the pri- vileged, perhaps even the main medium of knowledge: knowledge of the world and knowledge of the self. In societies where truth is concealed, distorted and repressed, literature's function becomes the revaluation of this truth and its disclosure. The modern Arab writer has become the bold ad hoc spokesman of society. The result is a literature immersed in everyday problems and directly linked to the media of information and communication, so much so that literature has replaced the channels through which day-to-day knowledge is transmitted and has become, in some cases, the only truly genuine if not immediate expression of the pressing problems of society.

This fact may be attributed to the role of censorship since the reportage on the Aswan High Dam was a journalistic text submitting to the governing ideology while the artist feels a greater freedom in his writing of fiction. It may also be attributed to self- censorship which shapes behaviour in public life. 5. The financing of the Aswan High Dam changed the course of Egyptian foreign policy when the World Bank refused to advance the loan and Egypt turned to the Soviet Union in 1952. 6. &lt;&lt;Seme&gt;&gt; in the terminology of the semantic analysis of a lexical unit is the minimal unit of signification and cannot have an independent realization. Thus, one would say that the symbolic signification of the High Dam is the sum total of all the individual semantic traits or components which are semes. 8. Ibid., p. 11 9. Ibid., p. 15 10.

The bipolar concept of transparency and opacity used in the linguistic analysis of dis- course notes the presence or absence of the speaker in relation to his discourse and from the point of view of the hearer. In the case of absolute transparency, the speaker effaces himself completely. At the opposite extreme, the text will be deeply marked by the subjectivity of the speaker. 17. P.

The author informed me that he re-wrote the first chapter of his novel thirteen times in order to strip it completely of all metaphors, similes and other tropes. This technique has been termed &lt;&lt;denument&gt;&gt; and is a distinctive feature of Camus' The Stranger. 21. I use the term &lt;&lt;actant&gt;&gt; after A.J. Greimas in his Semantique Structurale to convey the concept of an abstract narrative role that could be assumed by a number of more concrete occurrences. However, no complete actantial model is attempted here since it does not serve the purposes of my analysis. 22. 23. E.
