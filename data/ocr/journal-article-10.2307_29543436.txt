<plain_text><page sequence="1">MODERN + MODERN + HISTORY AS A HISTORY OF THEMES ANATOMY OF A DIVIDED WORK Franco Purini and Laura Thermes Aconviction that there are certain impossibilities, above all the impossibility of a correspondence between Plan and Project; the awareness of an unbridgeable gap in architecture, once well defined and unified but now so shattered that what remains is merely a collection of fragments; and a didactic aim - these are the distinctive characteristics of our work. These features in turn belong within a frame of reference which, in accordance with the Italian tradition, includes a strong tendency toward theoretical discussion and, consequently, a no? table distrust of empiricism and even more of any form of a posteriori justification. In contrast to the Italian tradition, however, our work maintains a radical distance from historicism, in that it selects from his? tory only certain themes, stripped of their extraneous characteristics and restored to their essence as pre-linguistic nuclei. Because of their very origin, these preclude quotation and imitation, though they do, to some extent, tolerate contamination. If the first characteristic is concerned with the problem of the design of the city and the second with the fundamental issue of typology, the third has to do with the problem of the contradictory language - at once post-symbolist and determinist - devised by the historical avant-gardes. The antecedents of our language include the exemplary treatment of structure by the Constructivists, from El Lissitzky's Prouns to Leon idov's project for the Lenin Institute; the neo-Laugerian elementarism of early Le Corbusier; the reductionism of Gropius in the Bauhaus period; the abstract lyricism of Kandinsky's Point and Line to Surface; and the purity of the work of the later Italian avant-garde - Gruppo 7 and particularly Libera and Terragni.1 Because of this background, our projects, even if at times they might be classified as post-modern,2 are profoundly different from it because of their dynamic relation to the present. We have adopted a critical approach which goes beyond trium? phant exaltation or masochistic submission. What we take from mod? ernity is above all its insecurity and division. This contrasts with another important division in our work, that between an aspiration to the tran? quil grandeur of classicism and our attraction to what remains of it. Our work on the city counterpoises an awareness of the irreducible relationship between Plan and Project against the basic positivism of the theoretical propositions of the Italian school of town planning. The sources of this school are Aldo Rossi5 s Varchitettura della citta, preceded by Saverio Muratori's work on the buildings of Rome and Venice,3 and the work of Carlo Aymonino and in general that of the architects of the Tendenza, which is almost exclusively Venetian in origin. Against the concept of urban space, defined as the suitable unit with which to exam? ine the correspondence between building typology and morphology in order to verify the 'plannability' of the city, our projects acknowledge the implicit duality of the contemporary city as well as the resulting relativity of opportunities and the fortuitousness of building pro? cedures.4 If in fact the dual nature of the city consists in an irremediable con? tradiction between the theoretical possibility of unlimited expansion (the Plan) and the finiteness of the building (the Project), it is also true that there exists no proper scale, be it that propagandized by the theoreticians of the 'territorial dimension' or of megastructures,5 or the reduced and circumscribed one of the 'part', at which it is possible to reconcile this inherent antithesis - an antithesis already present in the ancient city, but now overwhelming, thus revealing so clearly the equally inherent ambiguity of the building. Buildings do indeed have a double origin: they are products of the city but at the same time the result of a process of self-definition. As indi? vidual elements they retain an identity which is at times unique, but as elements in a series they tend towards uniformity and repetition.6 This opposition between originality and imitation, a theme which runs through the whole of modern art, hence of architecture, has trans? formed the modern city into a theatre of conflict, which will not, how? ever, be resolved by the renunciation of building or - and this is a dif? ferent matter - by theorizing about its negativity. To proclaim the negativity of the project means, in effect, to reclaim for it a parallel and paradoxical positivity, in other words building a metaphysical construct that is irrelevant to reality. Hence our accept? ance, by no means cynical, of the casual scrap as the most noble frag? ment and of the impossibility of choosing the correct dimension, a pro? cess which precedes and legitimizes the project. We propose instead the project which is autonomous but not self-sufficient, which engages in a dynamic relationship with the city and its layout without resorting to banal contextualism. The project must set its model-like soul in op? position to urban disorder, revealing what the fragments and configur? ations conceal. There is an alternative to buildings marooned in green space (Athens Charter) or the dense city of streets and squares (the Brus? sels school, and the type of projects which aim for revitalization or com? pletion, among them our project of 1979 for the former Rome slaughter? house), but it is destined to remain ideological and insubstantial until it acknowledges the role of the single building as a meeting-point between the indifference to locality characteristic of the often only approximate model, and the acceptance of place as a focus for conflict - rather than harmony - with the context.7 Neither an architecture ofthe city nor an architecture for the city is possible; only architecture in the city can AA FILES 8 57</page><page sequence="2">work, that is, the building which aims for self-effacement, towards that condition of instability which represents the only possibility of its tak? ing root. Typology The notion of building typology has inspired theoretical reflections since time immemorial. Yet opinions as to its proper application are so deeply divided that it has become extremely difficult, if not impossible, to define its acceptable role in the crucial phase of designing buildings. On the other hand, its role in the analytical stage - in identifying what is required of project - is much clearer. This duality, with its various and complex implications, is the ambiguity par excellence of architecture - at least at the theoretical level - and it has yet to be properly investigated. There are those who hold a too optimistic belief in the potential and stability of the norm as the guarantee of an ascertainable relation be? tween cause and effect, between intention and results; and there are others who deny too hastily the validity of typology as a tool for design? ing individual buildings. Yet in three important definitions of typology this implicit duality has been analysed with great clarity, albeit to different ends.8 If for Giulio Carlo Argan the essence of the type as schema (model, plan) to some degree hampers the search for the new, for Giuseppe Samona typology is a form of knowledge at the same time mechanical and creative, a knowledge which therefore seems fundamentally divided. A different division is detected by Saverio Muratori, which he identifies as an a pos? teriori element in typology, as opposed to the a priori, which in fact pre? dicts the destiny of typology. For Muratori the a posteriori is a system of classification - a statistical inventory of recurrent elements, a descriptive affair with normative aims which inhibits any approach to the heart of the project. Only the concept of a typological a priori as the meeting point between a typological instinct with roots in a developed com? munity or culture and the emergence of a specific and novel architec? tural problem makes it possible to capture that almost spontaneous event in which a particular architectural solution manages to be both unique and repeatable, both individual and general. But to attain this unconscious understanding of the type it is necess? ary, in a certain sense, to scrutinize the building as a whole, to test the coherence of each part of each of the sections into which it can be sub? divided. It is equally necessary to go beyond both the concept of the building as a whole and that which reduces it to a system of elements, in order to grasp the cohesive nature of its structure, which amounts to more than the sum of its parts. In fact, if we project the concept of the type onto the notion of a building as a community of materials, it becomes clear that the problem of comprehending building typology is in fact that of understanding the typology of society - working in col? laboration but also deeply riven - of which the building is a metaphor or analogue. If this is true, the problem becomes at once simpler and more compli? cated. Although the analogy with human society in fact makes it pos? sible for us to free ideas of hierarchy, elements, form, etc. from their merely constructional content, it is precisely this analogy which, by questioning the formal individuality of the building, questions also that of each of its parts, undermining from its roots the very idea of the organism. But the higher purpose - almost beyond architecture - expressed by a building as the product of a unity which is not simply morphological or plastic or volumetric returns one, in a circular fashion, to verify its individuality by comparing it with other, adjacent So? cieties'. This duality which is inherent to the idea of building typology recalls a similar distinction which the Italian philosopher Galvano della Volpe9 used to identify the essence of scientific discourse as heterony mous, in contrast to that of poetic discourse, which is autonomous. But in view of the impossibility for any discourse to be both scientific and poetic, heteronymous and autonomous (autonomous in the sense that it contains the elements of its own verification and has a semantic coher? ence), we are forced to conclude that typology is incapable of a satisfac? tory synthesis - to quote Giuseppe Samona - between 'notion and cre? ation', between the scientific and the poetic. The inability of typology to touch the heart of the project can be ascertained in another way: for the very reason that the typological method alone is able to anticipate the design before it comes into exist? ence, it follows that it concerns matters that are in a certain sense periph? eral to the design, given that it emerges through a series of decisions. In this sense typological discourse is only a kind of 'talk of something else', which fills the void between unexpressed intentions and conscious in? tentions. It is the exploration of the non-place rather than the place; it is investigation by default and approximation; it is the postponement of the task of measuring it is the suspension of the specific, the denial of the three-dimensional.10 But if typological analysis alone is capable of transforming building elements into abstract terms, it is also true that it removes the substance from the elements themselves; hence it is the inevitable flaw in the disci? pline of architecture, a flaw which paradoxically allows the possibility of communication. It is therefore a fertile limit which, if it does not allow us to nurture an uncritical faith in typology, does nevertheless allow us to perceive that the axis of the architectonic does not quite co? incide with that other, vertical, axis which links two empty spaces - the building with schema (model, plan, etc.) and the schema without physi? cal existence. In the end it is the substantial ambiguity, resoundingly asserted by Quatremere de Quincy, between the concept of type and that of the model which, by sanctioning for the industrial city the separation be? tween uniqueness and repeatability, laid the ground for the debasement of typology, from the merely prescriptive to a mechanism of control - the secular arm of the self-repression of the city. The language Our buildings are characterized by spaces which man has abandoned, but which retain the echo of his footsteps; interiors vigorously, indeed obsessively, structured by simple elements densely reiterated; clear but in some way compressed layouts. Our designs are the result of a pro? foundly visionary intention coupled with an eye for anthropomorphic texture and a pursuit of the disagreeable, which accompanies the unex? pected. Our programme could be summed up in a single phrase: 'sym? bolic rationalism'. This definition contains an internal contradiction, between the auton? omy of the language and its metaphorical possibilities. The coexistence in our work of mute forms and of an architectureparlante marks yet an? other division, and distinguishes it, at least as far as the Italian scene is concerned, from the apparently similar work of the Tendenza. Only by working on the language - once its structural imprecision has been clarified - can it be defined. The boundary between empiricism and theoretical soundness lies in an essential awareness of the nature of the operations, more or less interdependent, which are performed on the linguistic corpus. As revealed through the design, we understand them to be, literally, the anticipation of decay, of the deconstruction of architecture.11 Three projects The relation between model and context, the relation between old and new, and the building as narrative characterize, respectively, three of our projects: a block of sixty-five flats in Naples (1982-3), the systemati zation of the remains of the ancient river harbour of Testaccio in Rome (1983), and the chemist's house in Gibellina (1981) - three projects in a sense stressing as many impossibilities, which were ultimately found to be resources.12 58 AA FILES 8</page><page sequence="3">If, for instance, the Naples project illustrates the impossibility of a mimetic intervention, as well as that of a dogmatic assertion about the model, the one for Testaccio demonstrates that the relation between old and new can be only of greater or lesser proximity, but never of inter penetration. The project for Naples aims to exemplify the connection between type and model, the type being divided between its role as a schema and its embodiment in the form of a building, and the model in turn being divided between being repeatable - and thus being repeated - and being corrupted and compromised by contextual conditions, by a casual and scrappy ground plan, which undermines the very foundation of its exemplary nature. In the Rome project the dense, deliberately obsessive repetition of the structures, obscurely alluding at the water? front to a wall, forces it in some sense to renounce scale. All that can be measured is the gap between the ancient fragments and the new, in which the new elements may, precisely because of their unexpectedness, function as objets trouves.

The contradiction between the possibility of simply describing auton? omous forms and the complexities of literary metaphor literally attacks the building volume, eating away at its corners and transforming the in? dividual facades into self-sufficient fragments. While the use of meta phor reveals the impoverishment of the narrative possibilities of auton? omous architectural forms, it also proves that stones cannot speak. The architectural horizon advocated by Stendhal and Valery seems ever receding, yet this very distance makes it all the more desirable.

Even this genealogy is obviously divided. The contradiction between a search for style and a consciousness of the relative dependence of extra-linguistic processes on formal solutions, even if we are aware of it, is no less evident. The inspiration toward a total rewriting of the original signs of architecture and the degrading reduction, if we could call it that, of architectural language to the grammatical level are symptomatic, with a certain general applicability, of the difficulty, at the end of the sixties, of swimming away from the shallows of the abuse of functionalism that was being tolerated by the still vital school of rationalism, which was using the same forms. The dilemma con? sisted in the choice between trivializing the sublime or sublimating the banal. In Italy this latter was being carried out by the so-called Radical group (Sotsass, Mendini and the Florentine groups Archizoom and Superstudio). The core of this dilemma is rep? resented by the Tavole sugli elementi grammaticali of 1968 (see: F. Purini, Trogramma di fondazione grammaticale del linguaggio architettonico', Palatino, no.2 (April/June 1968); F. Purini, 'Note sulla composizione architettonica,, Grammatica, no.3 (1969)).

In the mid-seventies this excellent book, whose tepid success could be explained, perhaps, by the inability of the Italians to undo the knot binding Tafuri's cult of 'the negative' with Gregotti's cult of 'positivism', had the merit of posing ahead of its time - if not with great clarity - the problem of the relationship between design and building, i.e. the relationship between Plan and Design. As to the 'classifying' structure of Tavolesugli element grammaticali and its concern with the systematic recognition of 'formal types', see: Micha Bandini, 'Typology as a Form of Convention', AA Files, no.6 (May 1984). 2. The inclusion of our work in the Italian Post-Modernist movement, a movement which has revealed itself as not only more complex and varied than this slogan sug? gests, but also essentially American and not European in its complicated genealogy, is owing to the generous, open-minded attitude of Paolo Portoghesi, not just toward the salvaging of history but also toward investigations like ours that tend to plough the soil around the Modern Movement, thereby exposing its roots. With the 1980 Venice Biennale Portoghesi entrusted - in the most noble way - the effective management of history to the tripartite vanguard of the American East Coast, the Midwest and the West Coast. If the guardian of the renaissance of history is Louis Kahn, and the partly rejected father is Robert Venturi, we have yet to see, least of all from our small Italian observation post, any further developments worthy of its sponsor, Portoghesi, and the two above-mentioned protagonists (see: P. Portoghesi, Dopo Varchitettura moderna (Laterza, Bari, 1980) and Postmoderno (Electa, Milan, 1982); see also La Presenza delPas sato, catalogue of the First International Architectural Exhibition, edited by the Venice Biennale (1980)). Let us point out the correspondence between 'Dopo Parchitettura moderna', one of a series of seven etchings (F. Purini, Pareti (Grafica Romero, Rome, 1977)) and the Portoghesi essay. 3. The contributions of Saverio Muratori (1910-73), both as a practising architect and as a teacher of architecture, are to this day unrecognized, except in Italian academic circles, notwithstanding the quality and quantity of his designs and writings. For his analysis of Venice and Rome, see: S. Muratori, Studiperuna operante storia urbana di Venezia (Instituto Poligrafico dello Stato, Libreria delle Stato, Rome, 1960); the art his? torical journal Palladio (1959); S. Muratori and others, Studiperuna operante storia ur? bana di Roma (Instituto Poligrafico dello Stato, Rome, 1963). Muratori's writings on urbanism are, for all their differences, a sequel to the pre-modern city as theorized in Italy by Gustavo Giovannoni and as built by the early Piacentini; to this day it is un? clear how they managed to anticipate the 'tragedy' of modern town-planning. They also indicated positive directions for research, though these of course were lacking in the type of ideology that nowadays distinguishes and limits the radical proposals of Maurice Culot and Leon Krier, engaged as they are in polemics of a prophesizing character which remind one of Le Corbusier's sweeping proposals. Their 'avances', mostly achieved within the anti-industrial movement, can only be seen as an exit, per? haps final, from the architectural discourse. A final consideration on the question of Muratori's 'variants'. He does not see the variant as that which restrains the avant-garde, that is to say, as the intrusion of com? plex reality into the domain of absolute and abstract choices. Nor, however, can it be regarded as a pedagogic variant, as Ernesto Rogers argued. Rogers's students were assigned the task of verifying the proposition that no problem ever has only one sol? ution and that the architectural language therefore tolerates, perhaps even provides for, a significant discrepancy between the programme and its realization. Muratori's con? ception of the variant implies three further temporal applications: we may be forced to vary a design because a design is never, in reality, completed, or because it is imposed upon us because of the circumstances in which it is executed, or finally because the city, in order to decide for itself, must build up a consensus about modifications by 'passing through the narrow gate', that moment of indecision which, if it is to be resolved, re? quires a wider agreement that is in itself the result of a wider-ranging conflict. No ur? ban problem can be resolved unless all the powers entrusted with solving it are per? suaded of the suitability of a particular solution. It is, then, the architect's moral duty to confront these powers with a number of closed solutions precisely in order to dis? place the contradictions of the city administration onto those who really make the decisions. On the work of S. Muratori, see: S. Muratori, Ilpensiero e Vopera (Alinea Editrice, Florence, 1984); F. Purini, '11 Palazzo dellaDemocrazia Cristiana all' E.U.R.', in Catalogo del Consulto su Roma, soon to be published; and F. Purini, 'Die Forschungen ?ber die italianische Stadt von Saverio Muratori', in Idee, prozess, ergebnis (IBA, Berlin, 1984). 4. The notable split in post-war Italian architecture was to a certain extent anticipated by two very effective projects - effective, at least, as manifestos - of the reconstruction period, for two Roman neighbourhoods, the Tuscolano (1954), by Muratori, De Renzi and Libera, and the Tiburtino (1950), by Quaroni, Ridolfi and Fiorentino. The former represents a continuation, in a modified version inspired by Scandinavian em? piricism, of the predominantly Milanese, pre-war rationalist tradition. The latter, the most celebrated example of Italian neo-realism, was inspired by the picturesque, by the vision of an environment which recaptures the atmosphere and proportions of a small town. The contrast between the use of typological models in the Tuscolano (the slab, the gallery-shaped house by Libera, the boomerang-shaped building by Muratori) and the unpremeditated character of the Tiburtino recurred in 1959 in similarly contrasting projects by Muratori and Quaroni for the Barene di S. Giuliano neighbourhood in Mestre. Whereas Muratori's scheme suggested the use of typologies based on the his? toric city in new building projects, Quaroni's design, by suggesting rather than re? producing the crescent, obscurely alluded to the demise of typology, favouring instead a large unifying form - which bears a disturbing resemblance to the megastructure. Quaroni's proposition, already implied in his famous book La torre di Babele (Mar silio, Padua, 1967), consists essentially in emphasizing the exception rather than the norm and underlies his skepticism toward the usefulness of the project for regulating not only the city but also itself. His rejection of the statutory role of typology - to which it must be reinstated - and his role (which Manfredo Tafuri recognized) as 'master of doubt and self-criticism' (which he passed on to us as his university students) is a product of his faith in the 'city' as an ideal and his consequent refusal to focus his vision on so small a principle as the 'house'. However, the dialectic between typology and anti-typology, between building in the city and building against the city, was fi? nally resolved, at least in Rome, by Mario Fiorentino in his kilometre-long Corviale block. This 'super-block' has, at least for now, put a stop to the quest for a reassuring and definitive answer to these questions. 5. The conflict between proponents of the megastructure and those of the urban 'part' (the growth of the city through the addition of finite portions) stems from opposing interpretations of two beliefs common to both schools. The first of these is that the city is a growing organism; the second, that every city, from its very beginning, has em? bodied a genetic distinction between typology and morphology. Both of these beliefs are in fact questionable, the first in so far as it presupposes a definition of the city as an ever growing organism, the second above all because it highlights a theoretical limi? tation. 6. On these topics, see: F. Purini, Uarchitettura didattica (La Casa del Libro, Reggio Calabria, 1980), particularly the chapter 'Unita e divisione', pp. 123-44; and F. Purini, 'Norma e sregolatezza', in La metropoli spontanea: Ii caso di Roma (Dedalo, Bari, 1983), pp.79-82, extended and republished as 'Norma y desorganizacion' in Summarios, no.79 (Buenos Aires, 1984), pp.26-32. 7. On these themes, see F. Purini, 'Ii progetto e il luogo', Rassegna dell'Istituto diArchitet tura e Urbanistica delta Facolta di Ingegneria, no.26/27 (December 1973), pp.66-107; and the introduction by F. Purini, Luogo eprogetto (Magma, Rome, 1976) and Luogo eprogetto, catalogue of La Casa del Libro publications (Rome/Reggio Calabria, 1981), pp.24-32. For lack of space to do them justice, we limit ourselves here to listing the fol? lowing topics: the difference in attitudes behind the approaches which incline towards bricolage or towards construction or towards mimesis when dealing with a stratified context; the distinction between time-induced complexity and simulated complexity; the contrast between notions of environment, located space, and place; the insignifi? cance of positioning an individual in space according to the inherent co-ordinates of that space; the incompatibility between the notions of text and context. 8. Brief definitions can be found in the following texts, respectively: G. Samona, 'Una valutazione del futuro delle citta come problema del suo rapporto con l'architettura', IlMulino, no.218 (Bologna, November/December, 1971); G. C. Argan, Progetto e des tino, Il Saggiatore (Mondadori, Milan, 1965) - the section entitled 'Sul concetto di tipo logia edilizia'; S. Muratori, Arcbitettura e civilta in crisi (Centro Studi di Storia Urban? istica, Rome, 1963). It would be impossible to describe briefly the history of the typological discourse in Italy during the last twenty years but, wishing to remain consistent with the auto? graphic and autobiographic character of this article, we suggest the essay by Laura Thermes, 'Introduzione ad una ricerca sul disegno urbano in Italia dal 1959 al '71', in Struttura architettonica/struttura urbana: Note per un metodo di ricerca (1973). 9. Galvano della Volpe, Critica del Gusto (Feltrinelli, Milan, 1964). This text is a pas? sionate attempt to lay the foundation for a Marxist aesthetics, not as a simple reduction of art to its super-structural values, but as an anti-idealist reappraisal of ideas and values articulated in the individual disciplines, among them architecture. Owing to its excep? tional rigour, this book had a formative influence on a whole generation of architects, mostly in Rome, at a time when the sociological and town-planning misconceptions of the fifties were beginning to fall out of favour. The argument against the indescrib? able quality of art as formulated by Croce laid the ground for a verbal discourse, albeit improper, that is parallel to that which is strictly architectural. 10. On the central problem of measurement, we will limit ourselves to highlighting its three-sided nature: it is an abstract principle; it is the concrete measure of a particular building material, resulting from the intersection of different parameters; it is implicit in the material itself, which offers a limited range of possible applications. For a more comprehensive analysis of this theme, see: F. Purini, 'La conoscenza degli edifici', Disegno, no. 8 (Istituto di rappresentazione architettonica della Facolta di Architettura di Genova, Genoa, September 1984), pp. 161-4. 11. On the motives behind our operations on the language, see L. Thermes, 'Appunti su alcune tecniche di invenzione', Controspazio, no.3 (November 1975), pp.82-5; and F. Purini, 'La composizione architettonica nel suo rapporto con alcune tecniche di inven? zione', in L architettura didattica, pp.49-58. The approach used by Laura Thermes and taken up by Franco Purini derives from the essay 'Comment j'ai ecrit certains des mes livres', by Raymond Roussel, in the appendix of the Italian edition of Locus Solus 62 AA FILES 8</page><page sequence="7">(Einaudi, Turin, 1976). We wish, in citing Controspazio, to emphasize the central role played by this journal, during Portoghesi's editorship from the late sixties to the end of 1980, in the Italian debates. Its contribution began with the support it gave to the argument on autonomy in architecture, followed by the assertion of the cognitive value of architectural design (promoted to the status of finished product in the famous rubric Varchitettura inter rotta), and culminating in the exhibition The Presence of the Past in the 1980 Venice Biennale. As to the Italian architects included in the exhibition, the beginnings of a conflict between Portoghesi's neo-historicism and continuity with the modern was at that time already apparent. We consider modernism not as a summary of contemporary styles, but as the contemporary aspect of historical architecture. In this sense our in? terpretation of modernism is radically different from that of Charles Jencks, explorer and classifier of the architectural species, that lonesome Darwin of a passing phase. In our design work we propose, as an alternative to his selective inconclusiveness, an ex? clusive and hence tendentious selectiveness based on the exigencies of 'excess' and 'error'. Furthermore, it is important to remember that Controspazio is essentially a self proclaimed experimental publication. A vehicle for the North Italian Tendenza of the Milan period, the journal also hosted the debates among the then younger generation of architects in Rome. On the end of Portoghesi's editorship, see: F. Purini, 'Nel cielo delle riviste', Domus, no.637 (March 1983). 12. It is essential, in order to alleviate the disparity between Plan and Design, that the shortcomings and limits of resources be overcome. This has been a crucial problem for our generation, which could be characterized as 'non-building', but not, as some would have it, 'anti-building'. If it is true that today the opportunity of building involves a massive effort of persuasion, above all of politicians, it is also true that this allows the design to assert its character and objectives, hence to gain greater autonomy - which is not to be mistaken for self-sufficiency. The necessity for this act of persuasion, using the ploys of contemporary architectural rhetoric, can be avoided by a hard, inflexible and unequivocal proposal. This strategy postpones the inevitable and necessary adjust? ments. We refer once again to the conflict between the wish to formalize and to struc? ture - always violent at heart and perhaps not as solidly founded as we architects would like to see it - and the defensive reaction by the outside world towards change, a re? action which is transferred to the heart of the design. If, as Peter Handke has written, there exists an unbridgeable gap between the inside and the outside, then it becomes a certainty upon which we can rely. 'Someone sees so many objects / that he becomes indifferent to them / Someone sees so many indifferent objects / that he slowly loses self-awareness / then he sees an object / which he does not want to see / or that he would like to see more / or that he'd like to possess / so the objects become the object of his wish to see / of his will / of his malevolence / and he looks at it / and does not want to have it / or wants it / : and becomes conscious.' These lines by Hendke, our contemporary, are taken from his poem 'The inside of the outside of the inside of the world'. The consciousness of which he speaks is precisely what we would call a resource. In addition to the internal division which characterizes our work, there is another, that between the design and the drawing - an ideal, removed place (il luogo ideale allon tanato) - which is loaded, like a spring, with the distance between reality and imagin? ation and with the separation and conflict between visionary rationality and building rationale.
