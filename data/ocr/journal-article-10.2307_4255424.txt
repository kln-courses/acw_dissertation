Lansing, MI 48824). REPRESENTATIONS ON PRE-COLUMBIAN SPINDLE WHORLS OF THE FLORAL AND FRUIT STRUCTURE OF ECONOMIC PLANTS. Economic Botany 46(2):171-180. 1992. A few of the numerous small clay discs from Pre-Columbian Mesoamerica and South America contain accurate illustrations of the reproductive structures of important economic plants. The arrange- ment of seeds in fruit sections, axial or parietal, is shown for the Solanaceae (tomato, pepper) and the Cucurbitaceae (squash). The number of locules in Gossypium (cotton) bolls and the external appearance of the boll including the precise arrangement of the gossypol glands are illustrated. What are probably floral diagrams of these plant families are represented. The bell- shaped spindle whorls from the Quimbaya culture of Colombia have varied designs that resemble the campanulate flowers of Brugmansia (Datura, Solanaceae), which is known for its contorted flowers, and hallucinogenic effects. The native mythology and language, recorded in Mexico at the time of the conquest, indicates a pervasive interest in fruit and flower structure, which is reflected in the designs on the spindle whorls. These functional artifacts provide evidence of the accurate plant observation in the less well known cultures of Colombia and Ecuador. Representaciones Precolombinas de los Husos o Malacates de la Estructura de la Flor y el Fruto de las Plantas Economicas. Solo unos pocos de los numerosos y pequenos discos de cerdmica precolombina de Mesoamerica y America del Sur, contienen illustraciones correctas de las es- tructuras de reproducci6n de plantas econ6micas importantes. En ellas se muestra la distribuci6n de las semillas dentro de las secciones axial or parietal de la fruta, como en las Solanaceae (tomate y pimiento) y en las Cucurbitaceae (calabacin). Tambien se ilustra el numero de lo6culos en la catpsula de la Gossypium (algod6n), al igual que su apariencia externa y la precisa distribuci6n de las glandulas de gossypol. Ademds se representa, lo que probablemente sea, un diagrama de la flor de esta familia de plantas. En la cultura Quimbaya de Colombia, tambien se encuentran variados disenos de la forma de campana de los husos semejando las flores acampanadas de la Brugmansia (syn. Datura, Solanaceae). Estas flores han sido conocidas por sus deformaciones, y sus efectos alucin6genos. Tanto la mitologia como la lengua indigena recogidas en Mexico en la epoca de la conquista, indican un persistente interes en la estructura de la flor y delfruto de estas plantas, lo cual se ve reflejado en los disenos de los malacates. Estos artefactos tan funcionales, dan evidencia de una observaci6n bastante acertada de las plantas econ6micas en otras culturas menos conocidas, como son las de Colombia y Ecuador. Key Words: Gossypium; Pre-Columbian botanical illustration; spindle whorls; Solanaceae. The contributions of Pre-Columbian Ameri- cans to agriculture (cotton, corn, potato, pepper, squash, tomato) are well-known (Bennett 1946; Bretting 1990; Mangelsdorf et al. 1964; McLeod et al. 1982; Pickersgill 1984; Towle 1961; Turner and Miksicek 1984). Many of these appear on ancient ceramics (Dunn 1979; Larco Hoyle 1938, 1942, 1943, 1966; Seler 1961; Yacovleff and I Received 29 March 1991; accepted 5 November 1991. Economic Botany 46(2) pp. 171-180. 1992 Â© 1992, by The New York Botanical Garden, Bronx, Herrera 1934-5), and in Peruvian textiles (Cor- dy-Collins 1979; D'Harcourt 1962). Early Ma- yan embroideries depict edible fruits (O'Neal and Whitaker 1947), and Mexican Codices contain many plant illustrations associated with deities (Seler 1901, 1902-3, 1906). Pasztory (1988) has concluded that the trees in the murals at Teoti- huacan near Mexico City are generic signs for plants, and Mayan stone carvings contain rep- resentations which are probably water lilies (Rands 1953; Spinden 1975). Little attention, however, has been given to the detailed repre- NY 10458 U.S.A. </page><page sequence="2">ECONOMIC BOTANY Fig. 1. A carved gourd figuring a woman spinning thread which is wound around a rod (spindle) with a clay disc or spindle whorl (SW) on one end (from Junin, Peru). sentations of flower and fruit anatomy found on some ceramic Pre-Columbian spindle whorls. Spindle whorls (malacates in Aztec Mexico, husos in Spanish, fusaiola in classical archae- ology, Funes S'anchez 1970), are 2-5 cm diameter clay discs (Fig. 1) from the bottom of the spindle used for spinning thread from maguey, cotton, or wool fibers (Parsons 1972). They are abundant in some archaeological sites, for example from 900-1500 AD in Western Mexico (Lister 1955), from 500-1500 AD in Manabi Province in coast- al Ecuador (Shaffer 1979) and from 500-1000 AD among the Quimbayas of the Cauca River valley in Colombia (Feldman and Moseley 1983). There are thousands of spindle whorls in mu- seum collections in the Americas and Europe. In the Pre-Columbian world they were symbolic gifts to female children at birth and were often in- cluded in burials. Some of their descendants to- day use the ancient spindle whorls for spinning, and they are sold in tourist shops. Tracing the spindle whorls to specific production sites is usu- ally not possible, but there were centers of pro- duction and they were distributed at fiestas (Cor- dry and Cordry 1986). Enciso (1971) classified the plant types on Mexican spindle whorls as either unidentified flowers or geometric designs. In this study a sample of spindle whorls of botanical interest from Mexico, Colombia, Ec- uador, and Peru will be used to show the degree of detail found in their floral and fruit illustration prior to the conquest of Mexico in 1519. Patterns showing multiples of four (Fig. 2A,B) have been excluded inasmuch as they are said to represent the cardinal points, north, south, east, and west (S6journe 1956), or a sign for the planet Venus (Klein 1976). Most of the examples included have a pattern other than multiples of four, and tend to have some asymmetry (Fig. 2D,E, and N), which is common in fruit cross sections. FRUIT-FLOWER DEPICTIONS AND SPINDLE WHORL DEPICTIONS INTERNAL FRUIT STRUCTURE Seeds are connected to the inside of a fruit by a placenta that is inserted on the ovary wall (pa- rietal) or on the center (axile) (Fig. 2S,T and U). The fruit of Solanaceous plants (pepper, tomato) have axile arrangements (Fig. 2S) and the Cac- taceae have the parietal arrangement. The Cu- curbitaceae are parietal, which can be seen in gourds (Fig. 2U), but which in the squashes is obscured by the massively developed placenta which appears to be inserted on the center (Fig. 2T). This variation in placentation is seen in the spindle whorls in Fig. 2. Whorls A-K are from sites 1, 2 and 3 (Fig. 2) in Mexico. Whorl E has four parietal placentae with seeds in three cavi- ties (locules), and H is a very realistic drawing of a fruit with maturing internal structure. Others (F, I, J and K) are more stylized. The whorls L and M from Colombia resemble fruit. Examples of central and parietal placentation are shown in the Ecuadorian whorls in Fig. 2N-R. While the sections in Fig. 2 are median, other fruit and spindle whorl comparisons indicate that sections at the pedicel end of the cavity of the elongate fruit of squash and pepper were copied. In Fig. 3, A and B are sections of actual squash fruit near the pedicel end of the locule: the seeds appear as lines and this pattern matches whorls D, E and F. A similar pedicel end section of a pepper fruit (Fig. 3C) corresponds to the patterns on whorls G and H. GOSSYPIUM FRUIT AND FLOWERS Gossypium (cotton) was domesticated by the Pre-Columbians from wild types: G. barbadense in western S. America (4500 B.P.) and G. hir- sutum in Middle America (5500 B.P.) (Munro 1987; Phillips 1976). The spindle whorls in Fig. 4 come from these areas of cotton cultivation: E-Pachacamac, Peru; H and I-Manabi, Ec- uador; F and K-Cauca Valley, Colombia; J- Department Narino, Colombia; and G-Oaxaca, Mexico (locations on map Fig. 2). The diameter of most of the spindle whorls in Figure 4 is 30 mm or less, which is within the range used to spin cotton thread, in contrast to the larger whorls [VOL. 46 172</page><page sequence="3">McMEEKIN: PRE-COLUMBIAN SPINDLE WHORLS Fig. 2.

Comparisons of Pre-Columbian spindle whorls from Mexico (D, E, F, G and H) with sections of Cucurbita pepo, summer squash (A and B) and Capsicum annuum, chile pepper (C) fruit. The comparisons are A to D, B to E and F, and C to G and H. used to spin the coarser maguey fibers (Parsons 1972). Spindle whorls are flat on the side where the spun thread is being wound, and convex on the side with the design (Parsons 1972). With this orientation of the whorl in mind, it is natural to think of representations of the cotton boll (fruit a capsule) in Fig. 4E-N from the convex pedicel side with thread or fibers being produced on the other side. In Fig. 4A, the view from the pedicel side of an actual mature capsule with five open carpels with the edges of the carpels reflexed, matches closely the spindle whorls H, I and J (Fig. 4) with either three or four carpels. The genus Gossypium can be three to five locular or carpeled (Munro 1987). Bukasov (1930) found that the cotton bolls of Mexico, Guatemala, and Colombia were usually three to four carpeled like spindle whorls E-K (Fig. 4). The Aztec glyph for cotton (Fig. 4V) has three carpels (Cook de Leon- ard 1971). In Fig. 4 the modem drawings B and C rep- resent developing cotton bolls with small dark pits which are oil or gossypol glands, unique to Gossypium (Fryxell 1979), and which occur in precise rows on both the capsule (C) and the sepals (B) (Munro 1987; Saunders 1961). Iden- tical markings occur on spindle whorls L, M, and N (Fig. 4) from coastal Ecuador; L and N are views from the receptacle side and M is seen from the top side.

Spindle whorls 0-U (Fig. 4), showing various numbers (three to five) of petals and locules which are not necessarily the corolla and fruit of cotton, can be interpreted as being comparable to modem floral diagrams. The pet- als of cotton frequently have a red spot on them, and this may be represented in L, M, and P (Fig. 4) by the circles with a dot in the center. If the spindle whorls in Fig. 4 are floral diagrams, then a distinction was made between the flowers that are petalous (0, P, Q, and R) and apetalous (S) with a trilocular capsule surrounded only by sta- mens. Alone T and U (Fig. 4), which are very common designs on Ecuadorian spindle whorls, might simply be classified as geometric, but since these patterns occur in the middle of floral dia- grams O-R, they are probably abstractions of three- and four-locular fruit. SOLANACEOUS FLOWERS Datura is linked by circumstance and appear- ance to the designs on the spindle whorls from the now extinct Quimbaya culture in the Cauca Valley, Colombia (Fig. 2, 5). There the spindle whorls were found in quantity in graves (Bennett 1946), and in this culture it was traditional for those being buried alive to be given an infusion of Brugmansia (the arborescent form of Datura) to induce a semiconscious state (Lockwood 1979). Today Brugmansia is valued for both its psy- chotropic and medicinal properties by the In- dians in the Sibundoy Valley in Colombia, who until recently retained the older traditions be- cause of their isolation (Lockwood 1979). Datura flowers are campanulate, and the Quimbaya spindle whorls also have a bell shape (Fig. 5), unlike those made in Central America, Ecuador and Peru. In Fig. 5 spindle whorl E is like the flower of many Datura species (A), but whorl F is more complex. Henao Tomas's ob- servation that it is rare to see two Quimbaya spindle whorls with exactly the same markings (Restrepo Tirado 1929) parallels Schultes' (1979) description of the many curious atrophied "rac- es" of Datura (Fig. 5B) found in some areas of the Andes (Valley of Sibundoy, Colombia). In Fig. 5, the spindle whorl design F is, I believe, the equivalent of the atrophied flower B. Schultes (1979) reported that these races are "valued by the natives because of their bizarre appearance which makes them attractive in magic ritual or because of their differing physiological effects" on humans. Since Datura is a hallucinogen (Em- mart 1940; Heiser 1984; Schultes 1979), some of the very contorted Datura-like designs on the spindle whorls may represent the mental state of the person at the time they observed the plant. In Fig. 5 spindle whorl G from Colombia appears to accurately represent the flower of the tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum), and the Mexican spindle whorl H the number of stamens and the parts of the ovary of the flower D of the pepper (Capsicum). DISCUSSION In Pre-Columbian Mexico custom, ritual, so- cial control, and the creation and sacrifice of hu- man life were linked to flowers and fruit (Heyden 1979). Illustrations from religion and language reflect this emphasis. A central deity was Xochi- quetzal (Xochi = flower) whose synonyms in- cluded "plant generator" (Sullivan 1982). In her hair she had spindle whorls, symbolizing life's processes, and flowers, associated with the gen- ital region (Boone 1983; Sullivan 1982). This and the floral detail on spindle whorls may be an indication that they recognized sexuality in plants or it may be coincidental, but the Pre-Columbian cultures are known for their symbols with mul- tiple meanings (Easby and Scott 1970; Pasztory 1983; Sullivan 1982). Cotton was associated with an anthropomorphic feline Staff God in a 3000 year old Peruvian textile (Anton 1987; Cordy- Collins 1979). In the Mayan Popol Vuhl and other Mexican mythology, a person is created from the fruit of a tree or from a gourd (Broth- erston 1979; Heiser 1979). The language of Pre-Columbian Mexicans also showed their interest in floral and fruit detail. The Spanish Friar Bernardino de Sahagfun in 1529 interviewed Mexican informants for his Historia de las Cosas de Nueva Espafia ([Florentine Co- dex 1577-80] Sahagfun 1932), written in the Na- huatl language of the Aztecs and 16th C Spanish. Dibble and Anderson's (1963) English transla- tion of the Florentine Codex contains the sen- tence "Pertaining to the blossoming of the flower are the fattening, the petals, the calyx, the pistil, the pistils, the seed, the seed of the flower, the ovary, the receptacle, the stamen of the flower, the stamens." (In Nahuatl: In jtech ca in suchitl, in cueponcaiotl, pochqujotl, suchiamatlapalli, suchizoatl, tecomaiotl, tomjoli, tomjolli, achtli, achiotl, iollotli, suchitl itzin, mjavaiotl, mjmjao- atl.).

The comparisons are: A to E, B to F, C to G and D to H. the native informants were describing flowers in general terms, and the Nahuatl terms are pre- Hispanic. He provided the following literal translation of the Nahuatl terms: suchiamatiapalli = flower-wing; tiapalli = color (petal ?); suchizoatl = flower-leaf (petal ?); tecomaiotl derives from tecomatl = pot- tery bowl but originally gourd and hence in meaning "like a gourd" (calyx?); tomjoli and tomjolli derive from tomyo = hairy (pistil?), achtli and achioti derive from a tree with a red seed and achtli can mean seed or fruit; iollotli = heart (ovary?); suchitl itzin = flow- er, its base (receptacle?); mjavaiotl and mjmmaoatl derive from miauatl or corn tas- sel but cast in general terms (stamen). The Pre-Columbian informant describes the flower of Yopixochitl by saying 'it has sta- mens, it has a pistil, it is like a spindle whorl' (in Nahuatl: mjminoaio, tomjollo, mala- cachtic; Dibble and Anderson 1963). CONCLUSION The floral diagrams and fruit anatomy repre- sented on spindle whorls should be recognized as part of the botanical tradition in Pre-Colum- bian Central and South America. This would not only foster a greater appreciation of the knowl- edge of plants in the indigenous American cul- tures, but it would also favor better preservation of the spindle whorls, which because of their small size, commonness, association with ordinary people and not priests in large temples, and de- scription only as geometric, have been buried in MD............ 111 .... i m l I I l i leN- A- B -......

Tim- othy Johns. University of Arizona Press, Tucson, AZ 85719. 1990. 386 pp. + xviii $40.00 (cloth). ISBN 0-8165-1023-7. The unusual title of this most interesting book refers to a biblical passage which advises that cooked meat be eaten with bitter herbs. The human dislike of bit- terness has a very practical consequence, in leading to a tendency to avoid bitter-tasting toxins which often occur in unprocessed or untested food plants. In this book, one group of bitter substances is highlighted, the steroidal glycoalkaloid constituents of wild potato (So- lanum) species domesticated by the Aymara-speaking people in the Bolivian Andes. However, the book goes considerably beyond an in-depth look at this one par- ticular class of plant secondary metabolites, and rep- resents in total an interdisciplinary blend of ethno- botany and chemical ecology directed toward a better understanding of the origins of the human diet. In ad- dition, since many bitter toxins are also active phar- macologically, a discussion is presented of how plants came to be used in medicine. In the first of the eight chapters in the book, a model of chemical ecology is proposed, which sets out to for- malize how mankind deals with plant chemicals in the environment. Chapter 2 examines human adaptations to plant toxins, and provides a review of several chem- ical classes of such compounds. In Chapters 3 and 4, decontamination methods and domestication proce- dures are considered in turn as means to reduce the incidence of unpalatable or poisonous constituents of food plants. The major focus of Chapter 5 is on how Aymara farmers perceive the taste of potato glycoal- kaloids, and experiments on the sensory evaluation of these compounds are detailed. In Chapters 6 through 8, Johns further elaborates on the model proposed in Chapter 1, and included are useful sections on the use of nonfood plants by primates and on the history of human medicine. The book is provided with two Ap- pendices, which summarize information on traditional practices of plant processing techniques and methods of decontamination, respectively. There is also a single, lengthy and up-to-date Bibliography for the whole book, and a comprehensive Index. Dr. Johns discusses subject material embracing sev- eral academic disciplines with impressive ease, and has produced a work which is very thought-provoking. For example, he is right on target in pointing out that we require a much more profound biochemical knowledge of the effects of naturally occurring compounds in the human body. His model of chemical ecology will surely be applicable for the investigation of potentially toxic constituents of other food plants. However, perhaps the book could have been written a little more con- cisely, since several points are repeated in the text. On the other hand, the book might well have been ex- panded to mention the well-known teratogenic effects of certain of the potato glycoalkaloids, and it is sur- prising that no summary of the structural requirements for bitterness among organic molecules is presented. The volume is largely free from factual error, although one might quibble that capsaicin is not an alkaloid (pp. 56 and 236) but rather an amide. There are also a number of typographical errors in the compound names in Appendix 2, and several known classes of toxic chemicals are omitted from plant listings in this same section. With Bitter Herbs They Shall Eat It: Chemical Ecol- ogy and the Origins of Human Diet and Medicine will be indispensable for any scientist investigating the po- tato, which is currently the fourth most important seed crop in terms of its contribution to global food pro- duction. Given the very reasonable cost of the book, it will also appeal to those working in the area of sen- sory perception, as well as to the reader with a general interest in crop plants and medicinal plants.
