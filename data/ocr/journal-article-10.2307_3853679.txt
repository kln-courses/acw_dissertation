<plain_text><page sequence="1">76 NOTICES OF RECENT PUBLICATIONS Archaeology of the Old Testament. Was the Old Testament written in Hebrew ? By EDOUARD NAVILLE, D.C.L., LL.D., F.S.A. Robert Scott, 1913. pp. x + 212. 5s. net. The publication of a new book by Dr Edouard Naville will interest greatly readers who are familiar with his earlier works, especially such as The Old Egyptian Faith (Williams and Norgate, 1909). It will be taken for granted that Dr Naville has much to say that merits attention and consideration. And his new book, though many readers will hardly be convinced of the soundness of the views propounded, does not fail to fulfil in large measure this expectation. It contains some instructive and useful Egyptological data; and gives an English translation (from the German of Sachau) of one of the Aramaic documents from Elephantine, as well as other useful information about the Jewish colony there. The book, therefore, has a value apart from the novel theories it propounds. It has an interest also apart from the facts which instruct or the fancies which astonish us. It is clear that in writing it Dr Naville has been impelled by the desire, not merely to make a new book (an impulse which has become far too common), but to present to the public certain considerations which he believes to be new and of supreme importance. One sympathises with him in his devotion to what he believes to be the truth and in his fine courage. It would not be so difficult to believe that Moses wrote fragments of the Pentateuch or that he wrote them in cuneiform. But Dr Naville believes that Moses was the author of the whole of the Pentateuch and inscribed his records in cuneiform on clay tablets. Cuneiform tablets, he reminds us, are naturally independent of each other, each one forming a whole. This accounts for the lack of connection which we notice in certain parts of the Pentateuch. And since our present Hebrew text is a translation from Aramaic, which in turn was a translation from an original cuneiform text, Hebrew philological considerations simply do not count! Therefore, the arguments of the Higher Critics have no force, for, according to Dr Naville, it is "the philological analysis on which rests entirely the theory of the various documents of the Pentateuch" (p. 204). On this last-mentioned supposition the whole theory of Dr Naville seems to be based. And the supposition represents a strange misapprehension. The truth is that the analysis of the Pentateuch may be said to owe its origin primarily to critical and historical considerations. What first and early attracted attention were substantial contradictions or duplications and historical inaccuracies or discrepancies. It was discovered afterwards that repetitions and divergences in the substance or thought of the narratives were marked at the same time by differences in style and language. The linguistic analysis served to reinforce the results of a rough historical and critical analysis; and subsequent pursuit of the investigation has strengthened the fundamental positions from both sides. No doubt some Hebrew scholars have attempted to carry the analysis too far. If Dr Naville's book succeeds in convincing them of the futility of extravagance, the author will have done a service to Biblical scholarship. The book will do a further service, if it brings its readers to realize the great importance of the study of Aramaic. For, apart from the author's theory that the whole of the Old Testament was written in Aramaic before it existed in Hebrew-a theory which is confronted with as many difficulties and objections as it seeks to remove -Dr Naville's book does tend to demnonstrate the truth that, as the result of recent discoveries, the study of Aramaic has become vastly more important and imperative than it has been felt to be hitherto. MAURICE A. CANNEY. The Religion of Ancient Egypt. By Professor A. H. SAYCE, D.D. Second Edition. pp. vii+256. Edinburgh: T. and T. Clark, 1913. 4s. net. The second edition of Professor Sayce's Religion of Ancient Egypt-that portion of his Gifford Lectures which dealt with Egyptian religion-has been brought up to date in many respects, but we see that the author has retained a few conclusions and statements which might perhaps be modified in accordance with our present knowledge. Thus, for instance, he still speaks of Queen Teie or Tii, the mother of Akhenaten, as a "foreigner." This is not wholly the case. Her father Yuia was a foreigner, a Syrian prince of the Lebanon: he is called "chief of Zahi" on the unique cup in the possession of Mr Towry Whyte; but her mother Tuyu was certainly a pure Egyptian. What influence</page><page sequence="2">NOTICES OF RECENT PUBLICATIONS 77 the foreign blood of Teie and the probably equally foreign blood of her consort Anenhatp III- whose mother Mutemua was probably a Mitannian princess-may have had upon the spread of the Aten-cult we do not know, but we must not attach too much importance to it, since the cult of the Aten seems to us to be purely Egyptian in its origin, though its development may have been affected by Semitic influences from over the border. Professor Sayce regards the Aten-heresy as absolutely non-Egyptian (p. 94), but with this statement it is difficult to agree. Generally the Professor seems to assign rather more influence to Asia than many other students of Egyptian religion will admit. His great knowledge of Babylonian antiquities and of cuneiform lore generally leads him to ascribe con amore rather too much, perhaps, to "probable" early connexions between Egypt and Babylonia. Into mnany of his speculations on this point only competent Assyriological scholars are entitled to enquire: the Professor must be judged by his peers. But from the Egyptological point of view it might be said, with diffidence, that many of his supposed connexions do not carry much conlviction. One would prefer connexion with near Syria than with distant Babylonia. Syria, it is true, was early Babylonized, but not so early as to give elements of Babylonian culture and religion to Egypt. Yet the infiltration of the Syrian race into Egypt, which Professor Elliot Smith seems to prove under the earliest dynasties, may well account for many coincidences. And Syria may have supplied religious elements both to Babylonia and to Egypt. The anthropomorphic gods of Egypt may have come from the North : certainly the animal-deities were, as Professor Sayce says, those of the indigenous inhabitants, and represent the oldest stratum of Egyptian religion. Thus the hawk is no doubt the old-Egyptian sun-god (or rather sky-god) of the South, of Edfu, while the man-form of Ra may have come to the Delta from Syria. Hor is the old Egyptian sun-god, Ra the foreigner. Apis at Memphis is the Egyptian, Ptah the foreigner. Ptah certainly has a Semitic name, and Osiris himself, though there are African elements in his worship, has connexions with Syria, where may have been the Nysa of tradition, the home of agriculture, viticulture and apiculture, the "land of milk and honey." We are going to find out a great deal, and it will probably be rather astonishing, about the early relations of Egypt and Syria, and Professor Sayce will no doubt be able to appeal to manv facts as bearing out his theories. But one does not now any longer, and probably one never will again, demand a derivation of Egyptian culture from Babylonia. Yet in this book this rather old-fashioned view seems to be accepted, if not emphasized. The distinguished Professor's envisagement of the main features and tendencies of Egyptian religion will be read again with interest. During the years that have elapsed since the first publication of his Gifford Lectures many other scholars have written accounts of the Egyptian religion, and it is instructive to compare the different views of various phenomena that are taken by the different writers. Egyptian religion, as Professor Sayce says, was a hotchpotch of warring ideas, without real unity of any kind. It could rise in the mouths of the learned to the highest conceptions, it could descend in the brains of the unlearned to the lowest absurdities. It was an eminently human religion. In it its ancient votaries could find anything they wanted, and so can we modern students of it. H. R. HALL. Memphis V and Tarkhan I. By W. M. FLINDERS PETRIE, G. A. WAINWRIGHT, and A. H. GARDINER. 81 plates. London: British School of Archaeology in Egypt. 25s. The greater part of the first volume dealing with the work of the British School of Archaeology in Egypt in the season 1911-12 is taken up with a description of the results obtained from the excavation of the First Dynasty cemetery of Tarkhan. One of the special interests of this cemetery was due to the fact that wooden objects were found in an unusually excellent state of preservation, and a valuable series' of early beds was obtained, as well as many re-used boards which Professor Petrie shows to have been originally fashioned for the construction of wooden houses. Another exceptional find was a copper spear-head, the first example of so early a period : probably such spear- heads, being extremely valuable, would as a rule be stolen from any grave in which they were buried very shortly after the funeral. Mr Wainwright contributes a full description of an important mastaba, from the contents of which he deduces conclusions as to the survival of pre-dynastic ideas into the period of the First Dynasty. The bulk of the material obtained from the cemetery is given in a</page></plain_text>
