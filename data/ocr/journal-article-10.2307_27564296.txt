Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2003. xiv, 458 pp. DOI: 10.1017/S0364009407000578 This volume, awash in rich, deep analysis and reflection, is yet another magnum opus from the prolific pen of Michael Fishbane. Fishbane demonstrates the flaws inherent in any approach to the Bible that points to its rational core as its putative essence, thereby eliding its mythical dimension. He vigorously dismisses any understanding of Israelite religion that avers that monotheism, by definition, signifies the absence of myth. Most importantly, by going against the grain of modem statements that neutralize myth in the midrashic corpus, Fishbane's analy sis demonstrates myth's prevalence, variety, and integration in the main corpus of rabbinic texts. Fishbane highlights the mythological elements in the very God-language of the Bible and, at the same time, raises questions about the more precise continu ities and discontinuities between the religion(s?) of ancient Israel and those of the rest of the ancient Near East. Other scholars have focused on the physical mani festations of the divine, some of which are clearly anthropomorphic, whereas others are not; the use of masculine models of power to imagine the divine but the absence of gender-specific bodily parts; and the identity of Asherah/an asherah, which is linked to Yahweh in Israelite inscriptions. Fishbane goes beyond the current discussion and identifies the divine pathos for Israelite suffering as mythological. He adds the motifs of divine sorrow and wrath and sympathetic identification with human beings to the accepted mytholo gical repertoire of the Bible, whose main component is divine combat with the sea. Though a startled reader might wonder whether this is an unwarranted enlarge ment of the scope of myth in biblical literature, this may rank among Fishbane's most brilliant insights. Indeed, is there a distinction of quantity and quality between an Israelite God who is depicted as having emotions and the actions of the god Enki, whether sympathetically revealing the god's plan to his favorite in Atrahasis or inserting his member into the earth and ejaculating in Enki and Ninsikila/Ninhursaga? Fishbane provides evidence for this briefly in a section on biblical myth, but the cumulative effect of the textual evidence that he amasses in midrashic and mystical literature proves his point. Indeed, the key is to understand emotion as positing a psychology to the divine?just as the Meso potamian myths or the soap opera-like tales of the gods in the Homeric epics do. There is a critical distinction between the statements "God punishes the Israelites for their sins" and "God is angry at the Israelites for their sins and disciplines them." This portrayal of God undertaking an act in response to human actions or requests as mythic has been ignored by scholars. One might wonder as well whether the use of the combat motif in passages attempting to assuage divine 363</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews wrath and rejection demonstrates the link between the divine personality and the human influence on God as mythic. Fishbane emphasizes the vibrancy of mythmaking?myth is a living feature of biblical culture, not an archaic remnant left behind at random. In rabbinic texts, mythic motifs are not separated out but are incorporated part and parcel into halakhic and exegetical works. Accordingly, Fishbane's project is to redeem the mythic passages of rabbinic literature from the neglect and disdain usually accorded them. Indeed, myth may be more generative in rabbinic texts than in the Bible. Fishbane, for example, diligently works through Mesopotamian materials of a lamenting and tearful deity and notes that a deity's leaving a shrine has many parallels in Mesopotamian texts. Though the Bible is largely silent on this score, such motifs are repeatedly evoked in rabbinic literature. Rabbinic mythmaking focuses more intensely on the participation of God in the sorrows of his people. The salvation history of the people is thereby transformed into a divine drama, a historia divina of myth. God's response to Jewish suffering is personal and poignant. This pathos of God seemingly crosses the boundaries of what can be con sidered permissible to be said or thought about God. So the term ki-ve-yakhol is used to indicate that the myths about God are in fact encoded in scripture yet can only be revealed in what Fishbane terms "a strong act of exegesis." For example, the notion of divine descent into Egypt is enabled by rereading a phrase that is usually understood to refer to the nation that "You (God) redeemed for Yourself as "You yourself were redeemed." Fishbane includes a lengthy phi lologically sensitive appendix on ki-ve-yakhol, analyzing the spectrum of opinions about what it means and demonstrating how the definition he adopts fits the texts in which it appears. Fishbane delineates multiple ways in which myth is cor related to scripture. A link, however tenuous, to scripture grants authority to myth, and Fishbane elucidates the link between mythic elements and Scripture and between each other. Medieval reactions to the mythic material received in rabbinic texts ranged from defense to denial, whereas in mystical texts, myth was developed as a code to the deeper mysteries in a strong affirmation of myth. Myth became a mode of theosophical instruction. Fishbane elucidates the relationship between rabbinic midrash and the deeper mysteries, highlighting how biblical and midrashic passages are endowed with esoteric interpretation. He analyzes the characteristic differences between earlier mystical texts and the Zohar, showing how the Zohar takes myth to unknown levels. In midrashic modes, myth was readily found to inhabit scriptural narrative; for the Zohar, the hidden myth in the words of Torah was to be dis closed?the inward reality of the incomprehensible divine Being is made known perfectly and truly in the mystical unpacking of myth. Mystical mythology contains an emphasis on an instructional component, and knowledge of it leads one to do battle in all spheres of influence. All actions have supernal effect and vice versa. Fishbane's analysis richly appropriates methodological approaches to mythic thought and religion, reflecting a wide-ranging intellectual curiosity. Fish bane makes order out of a congeries of biblical, rabbinic, and kabbalistic texts, and the full force of his book demonstrates the continuing and creative vitality of myth 364</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews throughout these genres. The volume, far richer than can be evoked in a review, deserves the attention of scholars across these sources.
