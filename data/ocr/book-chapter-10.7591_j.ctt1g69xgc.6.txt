<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Aby Warburg's  Kreuzlingen Lecture:  A Keading  Il Fanciullo del West  The story i s  by now famous . In September 1 8 9 5 ,  the  young �rt historian Aby Warburg left Florence for New  York to attend the wedding of  his brother Paul . He had  much work planned during his proj ected three-year sta y  in Italy, which had begun the previous year, and there is   no apparent evidence that he intended his  American trip  to be a long one . Curiously, his distaste for New York  and the society to which he was introduced there served  to prolong his American j ourney and make it into an epi­ sode of profound importance to his  work and life .   In  1 8 97 ,  Warburg recalled h i s  impress ion  of  New  York in terms of the  "practical  foundat ion  of th i s   overrichly  assorted,  large s t  department  s tore  in  the   world . " Paul Warburg's marriage to  Nina Loeb  rein­ forced the alliance of two prominent investment banks :  M .  M.  Warburg of  Hamburg and Kuhn-Loeb of  New  </page> <page sequence="2"> 60 York. 1 This world  in itself  was one from which Aby  Warburg had fled already as a child .  In 1 923-the crucial  year  for the textual  reconstruction of  his American  memories-he referred to the " emptiness of civilization  in the American east " as the motivation for his " escape to  the natural obj ect and to scholarship . " 2 The westward  escape from New York thus recapitulated Warburg's life  path and its two inner exiles : away from banking and  away from established modes of art historical scholarship .  Warburg's American destination became the pueblos  of the Native American Southwest.  As E.  H.  Gombrich  observed in his biography, Warburg's distaste for gilded  American modernity fit into a larger, developing discom­ fort with the formalist modes of art history in which he  had been trained.  At this early point in his career, he  seems to have begun to formulate ideas of the conjunc­ tions between the production of culture itself and of aes­ thetic and symbolic images in particular. Thus the desire  to reintegrate the viewing of art into the interpretation of  culture led to the retrieval of the phenomenon of cultural  production in "primitive " society. In his notes of 1 923 ,   and i n  a somewhat condescending remark on the atti­ tudes of his own youth, Warburg added that " the will to  the Romantic " had contributed to his westward fever. 3  Gombrich suggests further that Warburg may ha ve  been influenced by the Berlin ethnologist Adolf Bastian,  who had recently warned that "native cultures all over  the world were in decline and if the material for a study  of primitive man was not collected now, it would be irre­ trievably 10st . " 4 Bastian is the source of the concepts of  the Elementargedanke ( elementary thought or thinking)  and the Volkergedanke ( the thought or thinking of a  people or nation ) .  These categories generated Carl Jung's  more famous notions of the archetype and the manifesta­ tion .  We have here the basis of two directions in modern  cultural anthropology: the cultural universalism associ­ ated with structural anthropology (Lévi-Strauss,  with the  MICHAEL P. STEINBERG  </page> <page sequence="3"> possible exception of La pensée sauvage) and the evolu- 6 I   tionism that looks to " primitive " cultures for a shared  proximity to a pure and prehistorical  cultural ground  zero ( Frazer, Freud, and Eliade ) .  In the 1 8 90s ,  Warburg  was operating within this evolutionary framework . An- other distinction, equally important, presents itself as  well :  that between liberal and romantic evolutionism. To  Frazer and Freud, evolutionism meant the transcendence  of primitivism qua cultural  barbarismo  To Jung and  Eliade,  evolutionism meant the loss  of something pre- cious and authentic . Warburg's early evolutionism im- plies the first- the liberal-agenda, but the evolutionism  itself  does  not las t o  " Images from the Region of the  Pueblo Indians " offers his new perspective, which took a  lifetime to generate .  Warburg's American itinerary took form through a  s e ri e s  o f  p e r s ona l  mee tings  and  connection s .  His   brother's new wife was  the sister of James Loeb ( later the  founder of the Loeb Clas sical  Library ) ,  who invited  Warburg to visit Harvard .  An initial interest in Dakota  Indian wall paintings took him to Harvard's Peabody  Mus eum  and  onward  to Wa shing ton  a nd  the   Smithsonian. Cyrus Adler, the Smithsonian's librarian,   professor of Semitic languages at Johns Hopkins,  and an  acquaintance of the Loeb and Schiff families ,  introduced  him to Jesse Walter Fewkes and F. W. Hodge, and James  Mooney, who in turn introduced him to Frank Hamilton  Cushing . In New York he also met Franz Boas,  whose  own German-Jewish origin provided an additional point  of contacto Adler showed Warburg ceramics that Fewkes  had removed from Hopi; Cushing spoke with him about  the symbolic ornamentation on the pottery; and Mooney  first told him about the Hopi snake dance . 5  The contact with Mooney proved the most enduring,  and it might be fair to speculate as to the intellectual rea­ son for this . In 1 8 92-93 ,  Mooney had published, in the  Annual Report of the Bureau of American Ethnology, his  ABY WARBURG'S KREUZLINGEN LECTURE  </page> <page sequence="4"> 62  study "The Ghost Dance Religion and the Sioux Out­ break of 1 8 90 . " In it he discussed Sioux religion in a  comparative context with other world religions :  "The  doctrines of the Hindu avatar, the Hebrew Messiah, the  Christian millennium, and the Hesunanin of the Indian  Ghost Dance are essentially the same . " 6 In the words of  Anthony Wallace, "Mooney anticipated those later for­ mulations which posit an essential processual similarity  in revolutionary religious movements diverse in form and  philosophical basis . "  7  Claudia Naber has recently reconstructed Warburg's  American  itinerary  with g rea t  s p e cificity. 8 At  the   Peabody, as she relates ,  Warburg found two sources on  buffalo wall paintings in the Dakotas :  George Catlin's  1 84 1  Letters and Notes on the Manners, Customs, and  Condit ions of  the No rth Ame r i can Indians and   Maximilian Prinz z u  Wied's 1 8 3 9-4 1 Reise in das innere  No rd-amer ica  in den Jahren 1 8 32-1834 . 9 At the   Smithsonian, on  23 October 1 8 95 ,  Warburg read G.  E .  A .   Nordenskj old 's 1 8 9 3  The Cliff Dwellers of the Mesa  Verde, the work he described in 1 923 as the inspiration  for his travels to the American West.  The cliff dwellings  of the Anasazi had been discovered in 1 8 8 8  by Richard  Wetherill, a rancher and amateur archaeologist, whose  Colorado home became Warburg's first western destina­ tion. 1 °  Warburg left Washington at the beginning of Novem­ ber and traveled via Chicago and Denver. He says in his  notes of 1 923 that the firm of Kuhn-Loeb had procured  for him, during his stay in Washington, letters of intro­ duction from the ministers of war and of the interior. In  Chicago, he presented a letter of introduction signed by  a c ertain Mr. S e ligmann to  " the  rai l ro ad  magnate   Ro binson " and receiv ed  a pas s  for free t rav e l  on the  Mexican Central Railway, as well as a recommendation  to the governor of New Mexico and to other "prominent  people in the region of the Pueblo Indians " and a request  MICHAEL  P. STEINBERG   </page> <page sequence="5"> for free passage on the Atchison-Topeka-Santa Fe rail- 6 3  road. 1 1  His documents introduced him as a "German sci- entist "  and a "man of means . " 12  Warburg was guided through the Mesa Verde cliff  dwellings-the American Pompeií, as he described them  in a letter to his mother and sister written from Santa Fe  on 1 4  December 1 8 95-by John Wetheril l ,  Richard's  brother. (Richard was in New Mexico at the time, trading  for Indian obj ects . )  From Mesa Verde, Warburg traveled  into New Mexico and visited the pueblos of San Juan,  Laguna, Acoma, Cochiti, and San Ildefonso.  He observed  the antelope dance while at San Ildefonso .  February and  March of 1 8 96  he spent in California, enjoying his lei­ sure-for example, a stay at the Coronado Beach Hotel  ( opened in 1 8 8 8 ) -but also preparing for a springtime  return to the pueblo s .  As wel l ,  he visited the newly  founded campuses of Stanford University and the Univer­ sity of California at Berkeley.  At Stanford, Warburg had several  discussions on  Hegel and F. T. Vischer with Julius Goebel,  a German­ born professor of literature; and through Goebel he was  introduced to Earl Barnes ,  a pioneer in the study of child  psychology. Barnes had spent time in the early 1 8 90s  con­ ducting experiments on childhood creativity with stu­ dents in the California e lementary school s .  He would  first  read aloud, from the Struwwelpeter stories ,  the  "Johnny-Head-in-the-Air " excerpt in which líttle Hans  falls into a creek during a storm; then he would ask the  children to illustrate the story. Warburg latched on to the  specific image of the storm and later conducted the same  experiment with Hopi schoolchildren. 1 3  Throughout his  western j ourney, Warburg kept notebooks and sketch­ books, which he filled with glossaries of Native American  terms, phrases, and bibliography as well as with draw­ ings of symbols, costumes,  and gestures . 1 4  At the end of March 1 8 96 ,  Warburg returned from  California to the Southwest, arriving first in New Mexico  ABY WARBURG' S KREUZLINGEN LECTURE  </page> <page sequence="6"> 64 at Fort Wingate, visiting Zuñi, and then proceeding to  Arizona-to Walpi and Oraibi and then to Keams Can­ yon, near the Hopi mesas . In 1 923 ,  Warburg recalled that  " twenty-eight years ago the railroads did not yet affect  the Moki [Hopi] vil lage s . " He recalled that outsiders  were still welcome in these villages beca use the three  days' distance between the railroad and the villages still  left the Hopi with a sense of protective isolation. 1 5  Oraibi  was at this time the only village on the mesas,  and it was  the dwelling place from 1 893  to 1 902 of the Mennonite  missionary the Reverend H. R. Voth.  Voth had gained  wide access to Hopi rituals,  access that included the per­ mission to photograph, even inside the ceremonial kivas .   Warburg stayed with him from 22 April to 2 May 1 8 96 ,   and Voth s e rved  a s  Warburg's  guide .  Through him,  Wa rbu rg  ga ined  p e rmi s s i on  t o  pho tog r aph  the   humiskachina ( corn ) dances . 1 6 I n  Voth's company, h e  had  even been allowed to enter the ceremonial kiva in Oraibi,  on the eve of the humiskachina dance . 1 ? Warburg left the  region at the beginning of May and in fact never observed  the snake dance around which he later constructed his  writing about the Hopi .   The central episode of Warburg's visit to the Hopi  was his administration of Earl Barnes 's experiment on a  group of fourteen Hopi children at the Indian Service  School at Keams Canyon on 24 April 1 8 96 .  Following  Barnes 's model, Warburg told the children the story of  "Johnny-Head-in-the-Air " :  " It was a dark cloudy day  with much lightning. A mother told her little boy not to  go out, but he went out into the storm. The storm became  so terrible that he turned back, fell  over a dog that he did  not see and stumbled into a pond where his father found  him and got him out with a long pole . "  18 He then asked  the children to draw an image of the storm, with light­ ning. Warburg's purpose was not, like Barnes's, to mea­ sure creativity but rather to explore, through the imagery  of the children,  the manifestation of the " primitive "   MICHAEL P. STE INBERG  </page> <page sequence="7"> imagination as conceived according to the criterio n of the 6 5  production of symbols .  He was interested in seeing how  the children drew the lightning :  would they draw a  naturalistic representation in the form of sorne kind of  crooked line,  or would they draw the Hopi lightning  symbol-the serpent with a forked tongue-and thereby  fail to  distinguish the signifier  from the signified ?  Warburg's working paradigm, which combined the study  of art with a certain cultural anthropology, had clearly  begun to develop but was still at an early stage . His dia- logue with the Hopi was clearly motivated by a notion  that the birth of modern culture and, a fortiori, of the  modern cultural production of religious and aesthetic  images ,  which in the Western tradition occurred in the  culture and art of Quattrocento Florence, coincided with  the mental and cultural capacity for the production of  symbols .  A rational symbolic practice separates signifier  from signified, hence denotes the mental separation of  human understanding and representation from the hid- den actions of the divine , and ultimately serves as  the  foundation for the increasing psychologica l  distance  (Distanz) of the human imagination from the divine . This  cultural phenomenon of increasing distance produced- in a linear view of the Western historical process of mo­ dernity-the Reformation and modern European secular­ ization .  In a fairly muddled convergence of the "primi- tive " and the child,  Warburg thought to measure the path  to modernity by the path to symbolization :  the fewer ser- pents and the more zigzags, the more advanced the ability  to identify a ritual symbol ( the serpent) as such and to  separate it from a nonceremonial image of a physical  phenomenon:  a lightning strike,  representable,  presum- ably, by a zigzag. The more rational (i . e . ,  systematic ) the  symbolic practice ,  the more modern the mind-both  onto- and phylogenetical ly speaking, presumably-at  work . ( It do es not seem to have occurred to Warburg that  Hopi cultural perception-adult or child-might not cat- ABY WARBURG 'S KREUZLINGEN LECTURE  </page> <page sequence="8"> 6 6  egorize a physical phenomenon outside the context of  ritual representation . )  The results of Warburg's experi­ ment made sense to him: twelve of the fourteen children  drew zigzags ;  two drew serpents  ( s ee Figure 2 9 ) .  In  Warburg's 1 8 96  conceptualization, therefore, Hopi cul­ ture was on the road from primitivism to rationality and  modernity.  As far as Warburg's conceptualizations of 1 8 96  are  concerned,  the question of to what extent the idea of  modernization through symbolic form either generated  the dialogue with Hopi culture or was generated by it is  very difficult to answer. In his notes to the lecture on the  Hopi s e r p en t  ri t u a l ,  which  he p r epa r ed  in the   Kreuzlingen sanatorium for 2 1  April  1 923 ,  Warburg  stated the importance to his subsequent work of his  American j ourney. Although we cannot know where and  how to draw the line, we have to allow for the separa­ tion-distance-between his actions of 1 8 96  and his rec­ ollections of 1 923 :  "1 did not yet realize that, as  a result  of my American j ourney, the organic connection between  the art and the religion of 'primitive ' peoples would be­ come so clear to me, so that 1 could see so clearly the  identity, or rather the indestructibility of primitive man­ who remains the same in aH times,  so that 1 could draw  him out as an organic entity precisely in the culture of  early Renaissance Florence and, later, in the German Ref­ ormation.  " 1 9 In a blunter statement of the same senti­ ment, Warburg wrote, in English, on 17 May 1 907, to  James Mooney of the Smithsonian :   1 receive the Reports o f  your admirable Institution, but  1  have not very often time enough to read them beca use my  studies are once again the Renaissance periodo Neverthe­ less 1 always feel myself very much indebted to your Indi­ ans. Without the study of their primitive ( ? )  civilization 1  never would have been able to find a larger basis for the  Psychology of the Renaissance.  One day or other 1 shall  MICHAEL P. STEINBERG  </page> <page sequence="9"> send you a specimen of my method, which, 1 dare say, is  67  new and therefore, perhaps, not as far acknowledged as 1  could expect. Nevertheless 1 work without losing the belief  in the unknown master who directs our attention.20  The question mark after the word primitive is Warburg's,  and it is a significant signa! .  His recategorization of the  "primitive " developed during the writing of the Kreuz­ lingen lecture in the spring of 1 923 .   The second and third sections o f  this essay therefore  address two biographical issues :  first, the significance of  the return of the youthful experiences in the American  Southwest to the mind and work of Aby Warburg during  his darkest period, the years of institutionalization in  Ludwig Bin swanger ' s  Kreuz lingen s ana torium,  the   "Heilanstalt Bellevue, "  from 1 92 1  to  1 924; and  second,  the autobiographical memory Warburg chose to invoke  in 1 923 and the broken process through which the reso­ nances of Hopi paganism served and haunted his later  scholarship .  Demons: Personal and Cultural   My purpose here is  not  to re sketch Warburg's biography  ( 1 8 66-1 929 )  or to recast its foundations .  Nevertheless,   as is well known, the conj unctions of personal and intel­ lectual biography are decisive throughout his life and are  of particular importance when his own thinking about  issues of primitivism and rationality is at stake . Although  clinica) information has not been available to his biogra­ phers, it has been a general assumption that Warburg  lived on the border of mental illness through much of his  life and that a short-term etiology of unknown character  preceded his breakdown in late 1 9 1 8  and the subsequent  institutionalization, which lasted until 1 924 .  His main  biographer, E.  H .  Gombrich, has treated this problem in  ABY WARBURG ' S KREUZLINGEN  LECTURE  </page> <page sequence="10"> 6 8  Warburg's biography with care and with the charge that  " it does not lie within the scope or the competence of this  study to describe the mental agonies of Warburg's psy­ chotic years . No more need be said, at any rate, than that  the inferno into which he descended should not be ro­ manticized.  " 2 1  The problemat ic effect of this fundamentally sensible  charge , however, has bee n the tendency to  duplicate  Warburg's lifelong battle against his " demons " on the  level of his intellectual work . In other words, the ten­ dency has been to look at Warburg's view of culture in  terms of his alleged proj ection of a straightforward path  from the primitive, the pagan, and the irrational to the  modern and the rational .  This is a questionable model for  examining Warburg's thought ( including the relation be­ tween his work and his own psyche ) ;  for it is  a model of  repression rather than one of "working through . "  It is   Gombrich's model,  and it al ludes,  si lently, to his own  Popperian positivism and-a fortiori-to his antipathy to  psychoanalytic constructs .  The same assumption makes  its  way  in to  Geo rge  Mo s s e 's e l e g ant s ummary  o f   Warburg's work: " For Aby Warburg, scholarship was a  way to maintain rationality in an increasingly complex  and irrational world, a means of maintaining control in a  world bordering on chaos-to warn, to exorcise, to en­ courage ,  never  detached  from the cha l l enge  of  the   times . " 22  Because Warburg liked mottoes ,  one of his most fa­ mous has regularly been used, abused, and mistranslated  to reinforce this repressive view of his cultural practice .  His great (perhaps his greatest) essay of 1 9 1 8-1 9 ( pub­ l ished in 1 920 ) ,  "Heidnisch-antike Weissagung in Wort  und Bild zu Luthers Zeiten " (Pagan-ancient prophecy in  word and image in Luther's times )  contains the following  passage ( cited by Gombrich, but duplicated here with my  own translation ) :   MICHAEL P. STEINBERG  </page> <page sequence="11"> Die Wiederbelebung der diimonischen Antike vollzieht sich 69  dabei,  wie wir sahen, durch eine Art polarer Funktion des  einfühlenden Bildgediichtnisses .  Wir sind im Zeitalter des  Faust, wo sich der moderne Wissenschaftler-zwischen  magischer Praktik und kosmologischer Mathematik-den  Denkraum der  Besonnenhe i t  zwischen s i ch  und dem  Obj ekt zu erringen versuchte . Athen wi l l  eben lmmer  wieder neu aus Alexandrien zurückerobert sein .   The reinvigoration of demoniac antiquity is  accomplished,  as we have seen, through a kind of polar function of em­ pathic image-memory. We are in the age of Faust, in which  the modern scholar-between magical practice and cosmo­ logical mathematics-strove to posit a space for enlight­ ened reflection between himself and the object world.  Ath­ ens always wants precisely to be reconquered anew from  Alexandria .   There are many keywords here,  perhaps chief among  them Denkraum ( the space for reflection ) ,  the value  threatened by modernization which Warburg invokes at  the end of the Kreuzlingen lecture . Gombrich follows his  citation with a poigant plea that this passage be read for  its " tragic awareness of the threat which the powers of  fear and of primitive magic menta lity  constitute to the  realm of reason and reflection . " He sta tes also that its  pathos must be absorbed from " the original German. "   Yet Gombrich's own passion for reason seems unable to  perceive the passage's painful ambivalence between, and  simultaneity of, the primitive and the rational, "Alexan­ dria " and "Athens . "  Curiously, he translates the last sen­ tence as "Athens must always be conquered afresh from  Alexandria . " 23 Warburg speaks of the internal desire of  Athens-what Athens wants, which i s  the continual de­ sire to control the ongoing historical and psychological  dialectic with Alexandria .  In the definitions of the poles  and the nature of their dialectic, we are in the shadow of  ABY WARBURG'S KREUZLINGEN LECTURE  </page> <page sequence="12"> 70 Nietzsche ( the Apollonian and the Dionysian ) ,  where  Popperians, apparent1y, fear to tread.  The motto placed  as the epigraph to the "Lecture on Serpent Ritual " pub­ lished in 1 9 3 9  echo es Warburg's intention:  "Es ist ein  a l tes  Buch zu bhittern,  Athen-Ora ib i ,  a l l e s  Vettern "  ( translated, without the rhyme : " It is the les son from an  old book: the kinship of Athens and Oraibi " ) .  The motto  comes from Goethe 's Faust, Part 2. Warburg had used it  in his Luther essay, in a different version : "Es ist ein altes  Buch zu bliittern, Vom Harz bis Hellas, alles Vettern . "   There , Germany and a notion of Germanic primitiveness   are j uxtaposed with Greece . Nowhere is it implied that  kinship assures harmony.  The historie al category that remains Warburg's life­ long obj ect of analysis is paganismo Often synonymous  with primitivism, it i s  a term that Warburg tends to  qualify with quotation marks-and at least in one in­ stance with a question mark. Paganism is an " early " cul­ tural phenomenon, but it returns as a dominant cultural  mode at various historie al moments, and it remains as a  dormant potentiality both in cultural groups and in indi­ vidua l  pe r sons .  A source  of  great  inner  confl ic t  for  Warburg was his intransigent insistence that Judaism re­ tained a primitive, pagan presence in the modern world .   His attitude and his  scholarship on the question of pa­ ganism thus necessarily converged with his attitude to­ ward Judaism, Jews, and his own Jewish identity. Pagan­ ism links his inner persona to the obj ect-world of scholar­ ship . There can be no assumption of distance between  Warburg and the pagan world-despite or, rather, be­ cause of the fact that distance remains the elusive goal  of   modern rationality, cultural and personal .   This dialectic must be understood in terms of the psy­ choanalytic notion of working through and, in a comple­ mentary way, in terms of an emerging cultural phenom­ enology. The "Other " is  both what is foreign in the self  and what is  culturally foreign. In the evolution of both  MICHAEL  P. STEINBERG   </page> <page sequence="13"> aspects of Warburg's model, the scholarly as well as  the 7 I  inner, psychological resolution culminates in the writing  of the Kreuzlingen lecture of Apri1 1 923 .  The act of writ- ing is by no means a secondary element in this process ;  it  is  the lifelong conj unction of Warburg's psychological  and scholarly energies .  There are two points to be made  here . First, his biography proceeds through his writings :  letters, diaries, and scholarly texts .  Thus his intellectual  and personal biography needs to be traced in terms of the  genealogy of texts . Second, the recovery ( in a clinical  sense )  of the person is  achieved through the writing of a  text ( the Kreuzlingen lecture ) ,  and that recovery is also  the recovery of writing itself.  The mutuality of the subj ectivity and mode of cul­ tura l  ana ly s i s  ach ieved  through the wr i t ing  of  the   Kr euz l i ng en  l e c tu r e  s hows  the  mark o f  Ludwig   Binswanger. In  and beyond h i s  association with Warburg,  Binswanger is  the figure where psychoanalysis and phe­ nomenology converge . Indeed, the Binswanger-Warburg  dialogue has rich potential for the as-yet-unwritten j oint  history of phenomenology and subjectivity. Binswanger  had become director of the Kreuzlingen sanatorium in  1 9 1 0 , on the death of his father. He transformed its clini-:  cal profile immediately, integrating into its traditionally  positivistic and physiologically oriented praxis a pro­ found, but not uncritical, reception of Freudian psycho­ analysis .  Binswanger was critical of what he understood  as  the biological ly drive-oriented composit ion of the  Freudian personality and strove to treat and restore an  existentially viable and complicated subjectivity. He thus  advanced what has come to be referred to as  existent i al  psychology and existential phenomenology, with his own  passion and significance increasing after the publication  of Heidegger's Being and Time in 1 927 .  His interaction  wi th  Warb urg  c arne  in the  p o s t - F r e ud i an ,  p r e ­ Heideggerian period o f  his career and thus merits further  exploration.24  ABY WARBURG' S KREUZLINGEN  LECTURE  </page> <page sequence="14"> 7 2 In  1 94 9 ,  B inswanger  pub l i shed  a s tudy ent i t led   Henrik Ibsen and the Problem of Self-Realization in Art.  Although this publication belongs to a later period in his  career, its theme expresses a model of selfhood that ap­ pears highly relevant to Warburg's own development dur­ ing his years in Kreuzlingen.  This model has been ana­ lyzed  by  Pau l  de  Man in  an  e s s ay ca l l ed  " Ludwig  Binswanger and the Sublimation of the Self. "25 De Man  describes this model of selfhood as  that of the author as  he is  changed and interpreted by his  work. . . . F or Binswanger, the literary enterprise can no­ where be distinguished from the project of self-realization .  . . . The expansion of the self seems to occur in and prob­ ably by means of the work. The authenticating function of  the work that " elevate s "  the writer aboye his original iden­ tity is so fundamentally implicit in Binswanger's thought  that he takes it entirely for granted,  without feeling called  upon to state it as  a distinctive theme or thesis .26  Writing, and, more specifically, writing the lecture on  the Hopi, became for Warburg an act of self-realization .   Self-realization can be described in terms of sublimation,  in the Freudian sense of the dynamic of the creative pro­ cess,  individual or collective . The therapeutic and asym­ metric aspects of their association notwithstanding, there  are noteworthy parallels in Warburg's and Binswanger's  developing ideas of culture and subj ectivity. Both ques­ tioned, in this period, the possibility and character of an  individual subj ectivity that would both be free of cultural  and ideological coercion and, at the same time carry cul­ tural content and connection.  After 1 927,  Heidegger of­ fered a new paradigm to existential phenomenology in  the category of authenticity, or the rediscovery of Being.  Warburg's emerging cultural phenomenology, highly  personal, autobiographically and indeed therapeutically  implicated, at no point claimed to discover in theory or in  MICHAEL  P. STEINBERG  </page> <page sequence="15"> personal experience a new cultural or personal a uthentic- 7 3  ity. Indeed, the personal equilibrium Warburg attained  after 1 923  did not generat e  an equi l i brated cultural   theory that could integrate paganism and rationality. On  the contrary, these categories never resolve their opposi- tion. If my approach differs from the traditional one that  sees  a fortress  ratio nal ity  posited against cultural de- mons, 1 do not intend -with regard to Warburg's biogra- phy or to his scholarship-to advocate a romanticization  or  ae sthet ic izat ion of cultural  or persona l  v io lence .   C l e a r l y, Warbu rg  cou ld  n eve r  h av e  s hown  the   aestheticizing-and ultimately barbarous-complacency  of Wagner's Hans Sachs, who stand s at the source of a  fulminating German and French desire for violence and  aesthetic renewal, where cultural violence is  necessary for  artistic inspiration ( "Nun schau'n wir wie Hans Sachs es  macht, dass er den Wahn fein lenken kann, ein edles Werk  zu tun" ) .27 Just as  the aestheticization of culture is  pre­ cluded, so is  the claim of resolution of cultural tension  and conflicto The only Eden that Warburg ever sought or  ever found, as we shall see at this essay's conclusion, was  a hotel in Rome .  The 1 923 lecture notes contain passages that j ustify  the connections 1 am trying to draw. Warburg gives at  least partial answers to three important questions:  Why  did he abandon the Hopi material for so long ? Where did  he first infer a connection between Hopi and Hebrew cul­ ture ?

This passage concludes the notes of 14  March; the  following day's entries begin  The primitive culture [this phrase changed from " the artis­ tic culture " ]  of the Pueblo Indians presents the rationalisti­ cally decadent European with an uneasy, painful and there­ fore unwelcome method of decisively destroying his belief  in an idyllically mellow fairyland as  the universal original  home [ Urheimat] of man before the fall from grace of the  Enlightenment. The fairy-tale foundation in the practice  and art of the Indians is  a symptom and indication of a  desperate search for order against chaos ,  and hardly a  smug and se l f-contented se l f- abandon to the  f low o f   things . A fairy-tale animal,  appearing a s  the concretest  product of playful fantasy is in statu nascendi an abstrac­ tion grasped with great effort.  It determines the dime n­ sions of phenomena that in their otherwise ephemeral in­ tangibility cannot be seized.  Example:  the serpent dance of  Oraibi .   The line Warburg draws he re is  a tragic, Weberian one:  not between primitivism and rationality but between a  dangerous enchantment and a decayed rationality. He  chooses neither. The notes of 15 March end with a dis­ cussion of the serpent dance as a desire for rain, and thus  for food, but also as  an expression of seasonal and gen­ erational continuity. "The founding category of causal  thinking is filiation [Kindschaft] , "  he writes .  The notes of  MICHAEL  P.  STE INBERG   </page> <page sequence="17"> the following day are taken up by autobiographical recol- 7 5  lection of the 1 8 75 illness of Warburg's mother (which is  discussed in the next section ) .  It is clearly possible that  the previous day's reflections on generations are involved  in this association. The notes of 1 7  March make a strong  point that attempts to question the " iron cage " historie al  process suggested aboye:  With primitive man, images of memory lead to religious  activity [ ; ]  with civilized [man] to recorded sketches .  AH of  mankind is  eternally and for all  time schizophrenic . But  perhaps  ontogenet ica l ly  an  att itude can be i dent ifi ed   which sees  these remembered images as  prior and primitive  and yet still presento At a later stage, the remembered im­ age i s  evoked not as  an unmediated, practical reflexive  act-whether as  warfare or religion; rather, the images are  deliberately sto red in pictures or signs. Between these two  stages is the treatment, the experience of an impression,  which can be called symbolic thinking.  The last extant note, dating from 29 March, contains the  following assertion and assocÍation:   The light volume of curious spectators notwithstanding,  the fact of distance, destroyed by culture, must ha ve an  entirely different sort of destructive effect on the l ife of  pagan rel igiosity. The adversity that the ludian of the  empty steppes answers by planting corn flows forth in the  same measure a s  the easy water supply or even irrigation  of cultured lands. For the unfruitfulness of the ground in  the absence of rainfall  was and is  the primal cause of reli­ gious magic among the Pueblo Indians .

The Kreuzlingen Lecture on serpent ritual of 21 April  1 923 resulted from the second legendary " business deal "  Warburg made in his life .  This negotiation was for his  discharge from the sanatorium, on the condition that he  prove able to give a sustained academic lecture .  Thus the  lecture 's ostensible theme, that of the birth of rationality  from paganism, on which he had worked throughout his  scholarship on the Renaissance, had a personal refrac­ tion . (The first deal is  well known: thirteen-year-old Aby  offered his younger brother Max his birthright [Max's  biblical image] to the business in exchange for the prom­ ise that his book collecting would always be funded. The  result was the Warburg Library and the confession from  Max Warburg-repeated at Aby's memorial service-that  this subvention was the most reckless one of his life .2 8 )   The  s t ake s  o f  th i s  s econd  dea l  were  h igher  for   Warburg, presumably, than for his  doctors . For them, the  test of sanity was an hour's talk . For Warburg, it had to  do with the lecture 's theme . If he could revive the mate­ rial on the Hopi, which-apart from the brief references  quoted aboye-he had kept hidden and unresolved since  1 8 97, and could finally articulate a position on the place  of rationality in culture, then his own biography and his  scholarly style ,  which had always been intertwined,   would dictate the  partnership of scholarly and personal  resolution.  The lecture notes he compiled in March 1 923   thus conj ure autobiographical episodes that from earliest  youth commingle with the issues of pagan culture . The  notes themselves waft in and out of coherence;  show  transparently the emotionally charged process of "work­ ing through" which they generate; and appear, certainly,  as Warburg's own dance with the serpent.  MICHAEL  P. STE INBERG   </page> <page sequence="19"> 7 7   Autobiographical Conundrums, Recalled in 1 923   Warburg's early biography, as reconstructed from corre­ spondence and from the autobiographical elements of the  1 923 lecture notes, points to a crucial but highly sensi­ tive, indeed tortured formula for the late-nineteenth-cen­ tury German intellectual :  the conviction that Judaism is  the cultural partner of paganism, not of rationality. An  acceptance of this formula in Warburg's lifelong thinking  makes the " fortress  rationality " position untenable . In  question are both the fragmented subj ect and the diagno­ sis of Judaism in various historical manifestations-in­ cluding even that of the Hamburg Jewish patriCiate-as a  vestige of cultural primitivism. Warburg's desire for dis­ tance  from contemporary  re l ig ious  p ract ice  r eca l l s   Freud's . For Warburg as  for Freud, the continuum from  the primitive and the irrational to the modern and the  rational was a fluid one . In the later cultural writings of  Freud, the cultural potential of this fluidity grew more  ominous ;  for Warburg it  had always been a terrib le   threat .  On the  personal level, Warburg never achieved a  secure distance from the same cultural demons; for Freud  this was not a concern . It seems clear that, in Warburg's  mind, the lecture on the serpent dance in April 1 923  was  his own dance with the serpent, a coming to terms with  the two dialectics that had determined, and indeed under­ mined, his lifelong sensibility: primitivism, or paganism,  and rationality; and paganism and Judaism.  The preparatory lecture notes digress repeatedly into  autobiographical issues .  Such references can be corrobo­ rated by a s ignificant body of  early correspondence .   Thus ,  in  a recent article entitled "Aby Warburg in His  Early Correspondence, " A.  M.  Meyer defined the issue:  "Exactly what was the relation between Warburg's re­ search on paganism in the Renaissance and his media­ tions and fears about Judaism ( and Jews ) remains of  ABY WARBURG'S KREUZLINGEN LECTURE  </page> <page sequence="20"> 7 8 course the problem. " 29 Meyer draws from the young  Warburg's letters to his family to form a rich picture of  the sensibilities of his personal crisis as well as of a more  general crisis among the assimilated ]ewry of Wilhelmine  Germany. In the Warburg family, religious practice had  become-certainly in Aby's eyes-formalistic . (As Meyer  po ints  out-correct ing sorne recent  con j ecture-the  young Aby Warburg did not  read the Talmud in his  child­ hood home and received no religious instruction fram his  father, the banker Moritz Warburg. Aby learned Hebrew  from his mother. ) 3 o  It thus presented a double danger:  that which was inherent, for Warburg, in ritual pagan­ ism, as well as  that of increased vulnerability to anti­ Semitismo Meyer has shown clearly how severe this con­ flict became during the years of Warburg's intellectual  formation.   In the 1 923 lecture notes ,  Warburg recorded his earli­ est childhood memory as the demoniac dreams he suf­ fered while ill with typhus at age six, in 1 873 . The imag­ ery of these dreams was inspired, he speculates, from the  i l l u s t r a t i on  in B a l z a c ' s " D i e  k l e i n en  L e i d en  d e s   Ehestandes"  (Petites miseres d e  l a  vie conjugale ) ,  which  had been read to him. 3 1  In the notes of the same day, he  also discusses the second traumat ic episode of his child­ hood: the illness of his mother in the summer of 1 8 75 ,   while vacationing i n  the Austrian resort o f  Ischl . He  re­ calls being forced by his grandfather and a "]ewish-Aus­ trian" tutor to say prayers for his mother and escaping  from these rituals by consuming sausages ( his first infrac­ tion of dietary law) from a local delicatessen and by read­ ing stories of American Indians-in a volume he recalls,   uncertainly, as  Eine Reise nach dem Westen (A  ]ourney to  the West ) ,  by an author named Brown. 32 Warburg thus  recalls his original "will  to the Romantic " as  a desire to  escape from ritual (a predicament to be repeated in New  York in 1 8 95 ,  after his brather's wedding festivities ) and  certainly not as the desire to find it.  MICHAEL  P. STE INBERG   </page> <page sequence="21"> Warburg had completed his Realgymnasium at age 79  e i gh t e en  and  en ro l l ed  in  the  Ge l eh r t en s chu l e  d e s   Johanneums for eighteen months t o  fulfill  univers ity en- trance requirements . There ,  he read G. E. Less ing 's  Laocoon with Osear Ohlendorff. Gombrich suggests that  Lessing's argument for the necessity of restraint in visual  modes of representation-the sigh of the sculptured fig- ure of Laocoon as he is attacked by serpents, as opposed  to the agonized screams in Virgil 's poetic depiction- drew Warburg into the study of visual arto At the same  time, Gombrich suggests that this turn to the study of  images "must have seemed suspect to Warburg's ortho- dox relat ions . " 3 3 Image versus word:  Which i s  more  primitive,  more threatening ? Which provides distance  from ritual madness ?  Did the turn to the study of images  signify an escape from the emotional dangers of word­ centered Judaism ? In a life of looking at images ,  Warburg  was looking for, and looking at, the truth; and this truth  consisted of personal,  cultural, and historical conflicts  and their representations . The question of Judaism re­ mained present, if not often explicitly invoked. Warburg  thus founds the practice of cultural iconology in a way  that was immediately diminished by his successors .  His  iconology de-idolizes the image, makes it move, travels  from the surface into the depths where dwell the demons  personal, cultural, social, and political .   Between 1 8 8 6  and 1 8 89 ,  Warburg was enrolled at the  University of Bonn, where his teachers were Cad Justi  and Henry Thode for the history of art, Reinhard Kekulé  von Stradonitz for archaeology, Hermann Usener for  classical mythology, and Kad Lamprecht for the philoso­ phy of  h i s tory. When urged by his grandparents  to  change universities because of his tendency to ignore di­ etary laws in Bonn, Warburg wrote to his father : " Since I  do not arrange my course of study according to the qual­ ity of ritual restaurants but according to the quality of  my teachers, I do not eat ritually. " 34 He spent the winter  ABY WARBURG ' S KREUZLINGEN LECTURE  </page> <page sequence="22"> 8 0  o f  1 8 8 8 - 8 9  i n  F l o r en c e ,  work ing  wi th  Augu s t   Schmarsow, professor o f  art history i n  Breslau, i n  prepa­ ration for the founding of a German art historie al insti­ tute there . In October 1 8 8 9  he moved to the University of  Strassburg to study with Hubert Janitschek ( art history ) ,   Adolf Michaelis  ( archaeology ) ,  and  Theobald Ziegler  (philosophy ) .  In a letter of 25 November 1 8 89 ,  he wrote  to his mother of his depression at the anti-Semitic barbs  to which he was subjected; several times a day he heard  voices in the street behind him saying, in Alsatian dialect,  "Desch ischt e Jud" (That is a Jew ) . 35  In 1 8 97,  Warburg married Mary Hertz, the Protes­ tant daughter of a Hamburg senator. His parents did not  attend the wedding but visited the couple in Wiesbaden  j ust before their departure for Florence .  The couple had  three children, whom Mary took to church and whom  Aby took to his mother's house for the Passover Seder,  "providing, " as A. M. Meyer relates ,  " rather irreverently,  German nursery rhymes for the tradi t ional  Hebrew  songs . " 36  The most difficult period in Warburg's personal nego­ tiation with Judaism and Jewish ritual carne with the  death of his father in January 1 9 1 0 .  He did not attend the  funeral or fulfill the traditional duty of the eldest son to  say the mourners '  Kaddish at a later memorial service .  As  Meyer records, he wrote to his brother Max:  The whole celebration acquires,  in a natural and subjec­ tively absolutely j ustified manner, the character of a dem­ onstration for the faithful Jews . 1 do not wish to disturb  this .  1 am after all in the eyes of others an unreliable cus­ tomer, but in my own eyes a political opponent of clerical  elementary schools such as the Talmud Torah School, and  aboye al l  1 am a 'Cherem' [banned] through my mixed  marriage and as the father of non-denominational children  whom 1 shall never lead to Judaism . . . . T he Mourners '   Kaddish is a matter for the eldest son:  it signifies not only  MICHAEL P. STE INBERG  </page> <page sequence="23"> an external act, but at this public memorial service demon- 8 1   strates acceptance of the moral inheritance. 1 will not make  myself guilty of such public hypocrisy. No one is  entitled to  demand this of me.  On 25 February, two days before the memorial service,  Warburg wrote in his diary, as  Meyer relates :  " Still more :   to  rend one's clothes ,  to  put  on carpet slippers, to  say  Kaddish, morning and night, regardless of whether one is   oneself again attacked by demons. . . . T here i s  no style in  this ,  especially if one respects Father. My respect for him  l ie s  in my not hushing up the absolute antithes i s  in  Weltanschauung through an external cultic act: for 1 am  dissident . " 3 7  The nature of the relationship between de­ mons and dissidence is  hard to know, but it is  not one of  simple cause and effect, or of symptom and repression.   The years of the First  World War were deeply agoniz­ ing for Warburg. They brought out profound conflicts  and recurring demons and, according to most observ­ ers-including Gombrich-played a role in the mental  aggravation that preceded the post- 1 9 1 8  breakdown .  Like many intellectuals ,  Warburg saw the war as  a cru­ cible for German J ewry and as  the end of the century of  assimilated culture . He was not alone in suffering this in­ ner conflict, but the fact that it was shared made it no less  wrenching. He was conscious of, and not entirely unsym­ pathetic to, the German patriotism that generated the  war; yet at the same time he realized that the argument  for German cultural superiority possessed an inherent  anti-Semitism that would now, inevitably, intensify.  Warburg's agony is vividly manifest in the material s  he  co l l e c t ed  dur ing  the  war, in  a fi l e  box  marked   "Juden . " As  is  well known, he  kept an  elaborate system  of notes, collected, ultimately, into well over a hundred  file boxes, arranged by subj ect, which in their organiza­ tion rival the idiosyncrasies of  his  l ibrary. 3 8  The box  marked "Juden " (no .  3 6 )  contains a bibliographic section  ABY WARBURG'S KREUZLINGEN LECTURE  </page> <page sequence="24"> 8 2  listing books by and about Jews , with an emphasis on  works published during the war years;  other subfiles la­ beled "Antisemitica, " "Juden und Krieg" (Jews and war ) ,   and "Konfess ionsfragen " (Religious questions ) ;  and a  general section containing newspaper clippings and ma­ terials on the Warburg family as  well  as  family corre­ spondence .   Perhaps the most extraordinary material in this  file  box is a group of twenty picture postcards from a series  called "J üdische Kriegspostkarten"  (Je wish war post­ cards ) published during the war by the Lamm Verlag in  Berlin.  Bundled together without written comment by  Warburg, the postcards express a clear propagandist mes­ sage of German-Jewish solidarity on the war front as well  as German and German-Jewish support for Polish and  Russian J ewry against indigenous anti-Semitism. Several  images show Jewish rituals observed on the Belgian and  Russ ian fronts ,  including a Pas sover Seder  in S a int­ Quentin and a Yom Kippur service in Brussels ,  both pho­ tographed in 1 9 1 5 .  Several show services held in the  field, with makeshift arks constructed on sticks .  One of  these field services is  an ecumenical one, described as  a  " konfess ionelle Verbrüderung " ( ecumenmical brother­ hood)  with an attending portrait of the Jewish, Catholic,  and Evangelical clergy. As for the protection of eastern  European Jewry, several images show vandalized Jewish  cemeteries,  with damaged headstones or with trenches  dug, by the Russians, alongside the graves .  One postcard  depicts Torah scrolls in Sochaczew, destroyed by the Rus­ Slans.  The iconographically most complicated images por­ tray the relationships between the German forces and the  " liberated"  Jews . There are group identification photo­ graphs-marked as pa s sport photographs-of Lódz  Jews, one  of a group of men, one  of a group of women.   The most arresting image of all is  an intentionally alle­ gor ica l  one : ent i t l ed  " Gros spo l en  unter  deut schem  MICHAEL  P. STEINBERG  </page> <page sequence="25"> Fig. 34.

I now want to offer a speculation that I cannot sup­ port but that seems too resonant to withhold. Visually  and iconographically, there is a clear resemblance be­ tween these photographs of Polish Jews taken by German  army photographers and the portraits of Hopi Indians  (Figure 3 6 ) taken by the Reverend H. R.  Voth, sorne in  the actual company of Aby Warburg. In both cases,  the  camera creates primitiveness by recording an asymmetric  exchange between, on the side of the observers, a culture  of expansion, power, control, and professed intentions of  liberation and, on the side of the observed, a culture seen,  literally, as primitive and transformable.  My speculation  ABY WARBURG'S KREUZLINGEN LECTURE  </page> <page sequence="28"> 8 6  is twofold:  First, Warburg, from the 1 8 95  trip on, senses  a paralle1 between the Hopi and the Jews as primitives in  an expanding world defined by economic, technological,  and cultural modernization.  The primitivism applies here  not only to the Jews living in Polish villages, who were  ordinarily not in his purview, but to the ritualistic resi­ dues present in the practices even of the Hamburg Jewish  community. Second, Warburg's life10ng pain has some­ thing to do with his inability, or perhaps his refusal ,  to  choose one side or the other. Professionally, he was an  observer and decoder of images .  But what of the culture  of the observed?  There is no question of any identifica­ tion with a sentimental idea of a noble savage . Yet the  obj ectification of the primitive observed is a position that  remains unacceptable for Warburg.  The suffering and  greatness of his career and person lie in the failure, or  refusal,  to draw the line o  These concerns inform a crucial and disturbing pas­ sage in the opening entry of the 1 923  lecture notes which  Warburg marked, in the margin, as having been written  while " under opium. " Warburg called this first section of  the notes "The Problem" and began it with the question  "Why did 1 go there ? What enticed me ? "  He notes his  impatience with the empty civilization of the American  Northea s t ,  h i s  encounter s  with the s cho lar s  a t  the   Smithsonian, and his "will to the Romantic . "  He then  stresses his dissatisfaction with the " aestheticizing his­ tory of art " and the " formal consideration of the image "  in which he had be en trained.  (Warburg rej ects two fin­ de-siec1e formalisms : those of art historical as well as re1i­ gious, ritual practice . )  Recalling his return to Hamburg  in the summer of 1 8 96 ,  he remarks ( in the passage 1 have  already cited )  that he had not yet realized how important  his identification of an organic and indestructible primi­ tive culture would be for his studies of the Florentine Re­ naissance and the Reformation.39   The passage proceeds to mention Warburg's discov- MICHAEL  P.

A couple of thousand more Jewish officers and we  might perhaps have won the slaughter of the Marne .40   The fundamental cultural irrationality of anti-Semitism  seems here to displace the irrational elements of  primitive  religion, including Judaism, and shift the position of the  Jew to one of  support for the modern war machine-a  manife station of modernization in which Warburg at   other times has no interest .  Anti-Semitism as  the ultimat e   cultural danger-for Germany, qua civilization-is repre­ sented as  a " creeping form" :  a reference to the serpent, if  also to the dangers of the cultural and social applications  of form ( i . e . ,  aestheticism) itself.  The Sassetti and Luther Paradigms  Is Warburg's 1 923  recollection that the notion of the  "primitive " he gathered from the journey to the Hopi in- ABY WARBURG'S KREUZLINGEN LECTURE  </page> <page sequence="30"> 8 8  formed an idea of recurrent primitivism apparent in the  Florentine Renaissance and the German Reformation  borne out by his own maj or studies of these cultural uni­ verses ? In question are his two essays on the art patron  Francesco Sassetti written in 1 902 and 1 907  and one on  pagan wisdom in the cultural context of Martin Luther,  completed in late 1 9 1 9 .4 1  Warburg clearly saw his family and himself reflected  in the life of Francesco Sassetti ( 1 42 1-90 ) ,  Florentine  merchant and "general manager " of the Medici bank .42  The cultural problem illustrated in his life is that of tran­ sition, in this case from the medieval world to the early  modern one. Although Sassetti exemplified the Florentine  humanist, Warburg was interested in showing the conti­ nuities of medieval culture : business and banking existed  in close negotiation with the church, religion, and arto  Like Warburg ,  Sa s s etti  l iked  mottoes ,  and Warburg  pointed out that he characterized his own person by two  contradictory ones :  the arrogant a mon pouvoir (to my  power ) and the compensatory mitia (ata mihi (may the  fates be gentle with me ) . 43 We might recall Warburg's  own contradictory mottoes :  "Athens wants precisely to  be reconquered anew from Alexandria " and " the kinship  of Athens and Oraibi . "  In the Sassetti studies ,  Florence,  as cultural universe, mediates between, on one side, the  "primitive, "  church-centered culture of the Middle Ages ,   and, on the other, the rationalizing ideals of the new Ath­ ens ( or, more relevant to the Sassetti chapel's imagery, the  new Rome ) and the image of a secularized Renaissance-a  new paganism, perhaps .  The origins of the Sassetti chapel in the church of   Santa Trinira lie in questions of ecclesiastical politic s .   The Sassetti family had been patrons of the Dominican  church of  Santa Maria Novel la .  Sa ssetti engaged the  painter Ghirlandaio, who had worked in Santa Maria  Novella, to paint the frescoes for his tomb but asked that  the scenes represent a life of Saint Francis,  Francesco's  MICHAEL  P. STE INBERG   </page> <page sequence="31"> patron saint.  The prospect of representing the life of the 8 9  founder of a rival order upset the administrators of Santa  Maria, and they rej ected the commission, forcing Sassetti  to relocate to Santa Trinita .  This is  the first level of the  "primitivism" as  identified by Warburg : medieval-style  religious disputes remained important, he showed, in the  late Quattrocento, which Burckhardt and others had de­ scribed as well on the way to secularization.   The second dimension of this  "primitivism" has to do  with the iconography of Ghirlandaio's nativity scene, the  centerpiece of  the altar and hence of the chapel itself. In  the closing lines of the 1 902 essay, Warburg suggests that  Ghirlandaio's style has to do with the growing taste for  Flemish art in the circle of Lorenzo de' Medici .  He only  hints at this affinity and says that the question of the taste  for Flemish art is  for another study.44 As Eve Borsook  and Johannes Offerhaus point out, the "general arrange­ ment of the figures and especially the portrait-like render­ ing of the shepherd acknowledges Ghirlandaio's study of  Hugo van der Goes'  Portinari altarpiece which reached  Florence in May 1 4 8 3 . " 45 Warburg treated this relation­ ship and the question of the influence of Flemish art on  Florent ine  p a inters  and patrons  in  other  e s says . In  Gombrich's words ,  "Here was another aspect of that   paradox which did not  seem to square with the idea of  Florence as an island of modernity in a Europe plunged  into darkness .  "46 As late as  January 1 929 ,  in his lecture  at the Hertziana in Rome, "Journey of  Discovery to the  Sources of  European Enthusiasm, " Warburg used the  Ghirlandaio-van der Goes relationship as a central ex­ ample .47  Warburg's long study of the German Reformation, based  on a lecture in Berlin and documented through prints and  books,  was published in 1 920 .  It  dates from a much  darker period of his life, that of his descent into mental  illness .  A massive essay, whose contents I do not attempt  ABY WARBURG' S KREUZL INGEN  LECTURE  </page> <page sequence="32"> 90 to summarize,  it contains, as an epigraph to the opening  section, the quotation from Goethe's Faust, Part 2 which  generated his Athens-Oraibi motto,  as well as, in a sec­ tion already quoted, the metaphor of Athens's recurrent  recapitulation to Alexandria . 4 8  The subtitle Warburg  proposes in the opening paragraph is "The Renaissance  of Demoniac Antiquity in the Period of the German Ref­ ormation. "49 Winckelmann and his successors,  Warburg  argue s ,  had init iated a German c la s s ic i sm based  on   antiquity's Olympian side;  the demoniac side ha s  been  overlooked .50  In the Reformation period, astrology exists  as the " uniformly primitive tool " (e inheitlich primitives  Gerat ) ,  as the march of an epoch in which " logic and  magic, like trope and metaphor ( following the words of  Jean Paul ) ' blossom from a graft on a single stem . ' "  The  specific historicity in Warburg's presentation is  not com­ promised by his immediate assertion that this very polar­ ity i s  timeless (zeitlos ) . 5 1   The essay i s  about cultural crisis and the cultural de­ mons that, in the form of violence and irrationality, ex­ plode the myths of cultural progress .  Written during and  after the First World War, the essay implies a dialogue  between contemporary cultural-and personal-cris i s   and a crucial historical antecedent. For this  reason,  as   wel l  as for the Reformation-period subj ect matter, the es­ say is akin to Walter Benj amin's study of the German ba­ r oqu e  l amen t a t i on  p l a y, Ursp rung des  deu tschen  Trau ersp i e ls ,  wr i t t en  b e tween  1 9 24  and 1 9 2 8 . 5 2  Warburg's main theme is the painful birth of a rational  and humane cosmology, achieved perhaps only by the  essay's two heroes,  Luther and Dürer. The enemy of that  cosmology is  the irrational and dehumanizing cosmos of  astrology. Benj amin's more overtly political main theme  is the crisis of sovereignty and the failure of the baroque  period ( and, in his judgment, subsequent periods as well )  to evolve a rational system of sovereignty ( the political  form of cosmology ) .

For  Warburg, the overcoming of melancholy implies the Ref­ ormation and modernity's development of  distance­ Distanz. For Benj amin, it promises the birth of the politi­ cal. Both scholars condude their studies with a discussion  of melancholia and, specifically, of its transformation as  manifest in Dürer's "Melencolia " of 1 5 1 4  (Figure 3 7) .   Warburg compares Luther, who overcame the psychic  pressures of astrology, to Melanchthon, who succumbed  to them. For example, Melanchthon insisted at least until  1 5 3 9  that Luther's birth year was, like his own, 1 4 84 ,   rather than the correct year of 1 4 8 3 ,  because astrologers  had charted the later year as a year of planetary conjunc­ tion and hence of a new epoch in Western religion . 5 3   Warburg identifies the " birthday cult " of the early Refor­ mation period as a crucial episode in " the development of  modern 'horno nonsapiens . "' 54 Luther mocked the as­ trologers and remarked that  though they had predicted a  conjunction of the ugly and evil planets Saturn and Jupi­ ter and hence a deluge ( Sündflut )  for the year 1 524, they  had failed to predict the peasant uprising of 1 525 . 55   The image on which Warburg spends most time, and  which presages the discussion of Dürer's "Melencolia, " is  that of the monk with a devil on his shoulder, as found in  a woodcut  of  the 1 492  Mainz  ed i t ion  of Johannes   Lichtenberger 's Weissagungen, held  in the  Hamburg  Stadtbibliothek (Figure 3 8 ) .  In a footnote, Warburg notes  that this image, as  well as others of the same subj ect, por­ tray the devil resting on the monk's shoulder atop the  d r ap e  of h i s  c ow l ,  wh i ch  fa l l s  " s e rp en t l i k e "  [ s chlangenartig] to  the ground . 5 6  Next to the monk  stands a smaller, timider second monk .

The war years had in­ crea sed Warburg's excitabi l ity and the sense of  doom  which had settled on him. When the  breakdown of Ger­ many in 1 9 1 8  had confirmed his worst fears, he no longer  succeeded in holding the encroaching demons at bay. Alex­ andria seemed to have conquered Athens .59   Warburg's Texts on Native American Paganism  Fin a lly, we can approach the actual lecture on serpent  ritual of 21 April 1 923 ,  or rather a single strand in it,  which contains the working out and the working through  of Warburg's mature phenomenological and emotional   position on paganismo 1 begin with the short reports and  lectures he gave soon after his return to Germany in May  1 8 96 ,  which he then put away until the turning point of  1 923 .  The 1 897  lectures, with slides, provided much ethno­ graphic information and a certain amount of vicarious  tourism to éager audiences . Warburg also tried, briefly, to  negotiate the sale of ceremonial obj ects to museums in  Germany. His main contact in this enterprise was Jesse  Walter Fewkes of the Smithsonian. While still in New  Mexico, on 5 April 1 8 96 ,  Warburg wrote to Fewkes and  reported the progress of his itinerary. Once back in Ham­ burg, on 10 October 1 8 96 ,  he wrote again to Fewkes,  re­ po rt ing  the in te re s t  of Profe s s o r  Grünwald  of the   Ethnographisches Museum in  Berlin in  purchasing sorne  MICHAEL P. STEINBERG  </page> <page sequence="37"> Moki [Hopi] kachina dolls as well as  other obj ects . " Can 9 5  you have something excavated for us ? "  he asks .  On 7  December he wrote again, this time from Berlin, report- ing his intention to give a lecture on his j ourney and ask- ing how to get in touch with the Reverend Mr. Voth. (As  this  was to be a s l ide lecture, it is  possible that he wanted  more photographs . ) The final extant letter dates from 1 5   February 1 8 97  and reports that the Berlin museum would  pay between two and three thousand marks for Hopi ce- ramics and other ceremonial obj ects . 6 0  This correspon- dence, in addition to showing an otherwise unrevealed  entrepreneurial side to Warburg's adventure, shows as   wel l  his short-term distance from the sacred aura,  to say  nothing of the demonology, of the culture to which he  had j ust bee n introduced.  The three lectures he gave confirm this distance . On  21 January 1 8 97  he spoke to the Hamburg Photographic  Society. He began with a historical sketch of  the south­ west region and a summary of the ethnographic work of  Adolf Bandelier, Frank Hamilton Cushing, Washington  Matthews, and Matilda Coxe Stevenson.  He introduced  his slides with the qualification that they represented " un  coin de la nature vu par un Kodak " ( a  corner of nature  seen through a Kodak ) . 6 1  On 1 0  February 1 897  he spoke  to the American Club of Hamburg, introducing his pho­ tographs [Augenblicksbilder: l iterally, momentary im­ ages] " from the life of the Pueblo Indians . "  He showed  about fifty sl ides .  This talk contained much more de­ scriptive ethnography and historical summary than the  first one hado  He discussed, for example, a Hopi ka china  dance he had observed in Oraibi on 1 May 1 896 ,  j ust  before he left the region .  He described the dancers as  "neither gods . . . n or priests, . . .  [but] mediums . " 62  On 1 6  March 1 897  he spoke to the Free Photographic  Union of Berlin (Freie photographische Vereinigung) ,  and  his lecture title, " Images from the Life of the Pueblo Indi­ ans in North America, " presaged the title of  the 1 923  lec- ABY WARBURG'S KREUZLINGEN LECTURE  </page> <page sequence="38"> 9 6 ture . 6 3  He reflected that "what drew me, as an art histo­ rian, to visit the groups of Pueblo Indians in New Mexico  and Arizona was that the conj unction of pagan religious  representations and artistic activity is  nowhere more rec­ ognizable than among the Pueblo Indians and that in  their culture one can find rich material for the study of  the question of the development of symbolic art . "  Perhaps Warburg's sense of duty to return to the pro­ fessional practice of art history led him to identify him­ self so unequivocally as  an art historian.  He had clear1y  been thinking as a cultural anthropologist and historian  from the time of his departure for America .  In the well  known appraisal  of his colleague Fritz Saxl, "Warburg  was indeed the student not only of Justi and Janitschek,  but also of Usener, in other words of the trend in the Ger­ man historiography of religion which-like Frazer in En­ gland-strove to understand the ancient texts and the  origin of Greek and Roman religion with the help of still  extant paganismo It was thus as a student of Usener that  he went to Santa Fe, to Albuquerque, and to the regio n of  the Mesa Verde . " 64 In sum, Warburg's short-term assimi­ lation and representation of his experiences in the Ameri­ can Southwest reflect a rich descriptive ethnography but,  at the same time, a certain degree of emotional as well as  professional rigidity.  His return to the material in 1 923  occurred in a context  of pain.  Although we must certainly heed Gombrich's  charge neither to diagnose nor to romanticize Warburg's  condition, we do have the evidence to allow two sugges­ tions :  first, that Warburg lived in agony; second, that he  vented his agony and his vacillating ability to think as a  scholar through an uninterrupted flow of personal diary  entries . 6 5  Warburg always wrote, sometimes only symp­ tomatically, sometimes with no border between a symp­ toma tic voice and a scholar1y one . There exists as  well a  leather volume that Warburg had apparent1y received in  MICHAEL P.  STE INBERG  </page> <page sequence="39"> 1 8 92,  left empty, and taken with him to Kreuzlingen . On 9 7   the first page he had inscribed " Gedenkbuch" ( book of  remembrance ) and the date, 2 September 1 8 92 .  On the  frontispiece is  inscribed "Was nicht dein ist, rühr nicht  an! A .  Warburg. Eigenthum" (What is  not yours, do not  disturb !  A.  Warburg. Personal property ) . The inscription  and, apparently, all subsequent entries ,  written in pencil,  date from 1 92 1 .  This particular volume, perhaps for its  bridge across time, seems to have retained a talismanic  value for Warburg during the Kreuzlingen years . Above  the "Gedenkbuch " inscription, he wrote "Will 1 92 1  fi- nally bring me the return to Hamburg ? "  Next to that:  "No . " Then, l ine by line: "And 1 922 ? "  "No . " "And  1 923 ? "  "Disappointment . "  "And 1 924 ? Back to Ham­ burg ! "  A few entries made before the lecture bear citing . At  one point in early April (probably the tenth, if the entries  continued on a daily basis-but this one i s  undated ) ,   Warbu rg  wro t e  t h a t  t h e  c l i n i c  d i r e c t o r  Ludwig   Binswanger might not be able t o  arrange the lecture for  the twenty-first,  as planned .  " Such a lack of psychol­ ogy ! " His humor also turns on himself, and he refers in  the same entry to the " Schlangenquatsch "-the serpent  drivel .  On the twelfth, he regains the guiding tone, refer­ ring to " the tragic symbol of the serpent . " On the thir­ teenth, he records that he has asked Fritz Saxl to bring to  him Lessing's Laocoon. Finally, in the entry of 20 April  1 923 ,  Warburg wrote that the lecture, scheduled once  again for the next day, was completed .  In the entry of the  following evening, he wrote , " Lecture on the journey to  the Pueblos took place and was a brilliant success . "   The poetic momentum o f  the actual lecture makes i t  clear  that the personal and scholarly resolution it marks re­ sides not in the redemption of rationality over primitiv­ ism but in the rej ection of such historical linearity and its  attendant psychic and scholarly pressures altogether. The  ABY WARBURG'S KREUZLINGEN LECTURE  </page> <page sequence="40"> 9 8 title must be taken seriously;  in introducing " Images  from the Reg ion  of the Pu e b l o  I nd i an s  of Nor th   America, "  Warburg i s ,  literally, showing pictures, bu t  he  is also implying a way of looking at culture and history. It  is  the same principIe Walter Benj amin later called the  " dialectical image . "  In question is  a Platonic dialectic  rather than a Hegel ian one : images  from history a s   records o f  cultural predicaments speak t o  one another,  and the eyes and voice of the historian present the points  of contacto Distance in space and time still separates ep­ ochs, but the images placed in dialogue overcome that  distance j ust enough to posit associations that burst the  myth of a g r and ,  l i n e a r  h i s t o r i c a l  n a rra t ive  wi th   premeasured increments of  cultural and  temporal dis­ tance .  Thus Warburg begins with ethnography and ends  with observations on the culture of Uncle Sam and the  telephone .  The lecture 's opening pages were omitted from the  version published in 1 93 9  by the Warburg Institute .  After  apologies for the tenuousness of his own recontructed  memories and his linguistic limitations as far as  Native  American culture is  concerned, Warburg states the ques­ tion " In what ways can we perceive essential character  traits of primitive pagan humanity ? "  Whereas  in the  1 8 97 lectures he had used the phrase "What interested  me as an art historian, " here he says, "What interested  me as a cultural historian was that in the midst of a coun­ try that had made technological culture into an admi­ rable precision weapon in the hands of intellectual man,  an enclave of  primitive pagan humanity was able  to  maintain itself. " This culture appears as a " symptom of a  completely backward humanity. " In an early manuscript  version of  this sentence,  there appears the additional  phrase-which was struck out and which therefore never  appeared in a publ i shed vers ion-" incapable  of  l ife,   crippled by a dark superstition . "  Although such condem­ nat ion of  the demoniac  aspects  of  primitive culture  MICHAEL P .  STEINBERG  </page> <page sequence="41"> speaks to Warburg's fears ( " the poisonous serpent, " he 99   states ,  " belongs i n  the fire " ) , his own editorial changes  reveal how the maturations of his argument, in the actual  process of preparing the lecture, inflected his growing  ambivalence toward "primitive " ritualistic practice . 66   Warburg's shifting paradigm seems to achieve full re­ alization in the following paragraph, unpublished until  t h e  Ge rman  ed i t i on  of 1 9 8 8 :  " Th i s  s ynch rony   [Nebeneinander] of  fantastic magic and sober purposive­ ness appears as the symptom of a cleavage; for the ludian  this is not schizoid but, rather, a liberating experience of  the boundless communicability between man and envi­ ronment. " 67 The seminal term here is  Nebeneinander, lit­ erally, "next to one another. " It is  Lessing's term, from  Laocoon, and represents his argument that the visual arts  are perceived in terms of synchronic individual images,  as  opposed to other forms, including words,  where the re­ ceptive experience is  diachronic, or Nacheinander. This  synchrony dictates the relative moderation of visual im­ agery: the sigh in the sculpture of  the dying Laocoon as  opposed to the screams described by Virgi l .  As we know,  Warburg had requested a copy of Laocoon weeks before  the lecture, after the extant notes had been completed .   The principIe of Nebeneinander informs and  transforms  the actual lecture . For Warburg, it is  a principIe of re­ deeming ambivalence, through which paganism and ra­ tionality are allowed never to be reconciled but to exist in  dialogue nonetheless .   The first mention of the serpent symbol follows this  new principIe of ambivalence .  In the presymbolic phase,  the serpent is l ightning : it is danger, but it is  also rain and  corno The serpent is the " uncanny animal " ( das unheim­ fiche Tier ) ;  its symbology emanates, suggests Warburg in  a universalist speculation, from the fact that "contempla­ tion of the sky is  the grace and curse of humanity. " Fi­ nally, " the social provision of food is  schizoid:  magic and  technology work together. " The serpent poses the ques- ABY WARBURG'S KREUZLINGEN LECTURE  </page> <page sequence="42"> 1 00 tion "To what extent does this pagan worldview, as it  persists among the Indians, give us a yardstick for the  development from primitive paganism, through the pa­ ganism of classical antiquity, to modern man ? "   Warburg now describes  these convergences a s  the  " synchrony [Nebeneinander] of logical civilization and  fantastic, magical causation . "  This is  a point of argumen­ tative as  well as lyric transition in Warburg's argument,  where the essay leaves behind the traces of thirty years of  notes .  The synchrony, or at least the ambiguity, of magic  and technology stand in for the ambiguity of paganism  and rationality. This ambiguity holds within an indi­ vidual cultural  context ( the Hopi,  Sassetti 's Florence,   Luther 's Reformation)  as well  as comparatively. A tem­ poral, transitional dimension does remain, however, be­ cause Warburg still adheres to a paradigm of historical  modernization and rationalization in a Weberian sense .   Here he descr ibes  the transit ion a s  proceeding from  Gre ifen to  B egrif(, from l i t e ra  l i ty  ( " gr a sp ing " ) to   conceptualization ( " concept" ) ,  terms he  returned to  in  a  1 924 essay on symbolism.6 8  The term and principIe of  Nebeneinander stuck to Warburg as well ;  in his Hamburg  seminar of 1 927-28 ,  he reinvoked the parallel of van der  Goes and Ghirlandaio,  which he had addressed in the  Sassetti essays,  and described their stylistic convergence  as a moment of cultural "Ne beneinander. " 69  The immediate rhetorical effect of the principIe of   Nebeneinander is to shorten the distance between pagan  and  r a t i on a l  cu l t u r e . F o l l ow ing  F r ank  Hami l t on   Cushing, Warburg mentions the Indian belief i n  animal  ancestry and describes clan nomenclature as "a Darwin­ ism of mythical e lective affinity which determines the  lives of these so-called primitive people . " 70 We have seen  the invocations of Lessing and Goethe; the presence of  Nietzsche returns as  wel l .  Warburg had described his  urge to travel to the Southwest as " the will  to the Roman­ tic " ;  now, in a short section comparing the kachina dance  MICHAEL P. STEINBERG  </page> <page sequence="43"> to ancient tragedy, he is in the realm of The Birth of Trag- 1 0 1   edy .  He compares the accompanying dances to the tragic  chorus . 71 The chorus is  the anthropomorphic symbol for  the cycles of nature . Thus dance and drama fulfill a func- tion parallel to pictorial representation and operate at a  far distance from the process of human sacrifice evident  in Mexican cults, which Warburg does indeed describe as  lunatic .  The paradigm of a borderline pagan-rational practice  e s tab l i shed ,  Warburg descr ibes  the serpent  r i tual  o f   Walpi, which he  himself did not witness . Again, there i s   no question of sacrificing the sacred animal, in  contrast  to the dance of  the Maenads in the orgiastic cult of  Dionysius . Warburg comments :  "The deliverance from  blood sacrifice as  the innermost ideal of purification per­ vades the history of religious evolution from east to west.  The serpent shares in this process of religious sublima­ tion . " In this j udgment, then, the conventional paradigm  of Athens and Oraibi is  reversed.  The symbol of the ser­ pent travels the course of the history of religion, from the  symbol of evil of the Old Testament's Babylonian primal  serpent Tiamat and Moses'  order to the Hebrews in the  desert to cure snakebite by honoring a serpent image; to  the Greek subterranean monster, as in the Laocoon story;  to the New Testament story of Paul against the vipers of  Malta . The bibil ical  serpent, from the Garden of Eden  onward,  represents the root  of  evi l ,  s in ,  and satanic  power. Similarly, the death of  Laocoon represents the re­ venge of demons, "without j ustice and without hope of  redemption.  That is  the hopeless ,  tragic pessimism of an­ tiq uity. " This is ,  however, not the identity of the serpent  of Walpi, and Warburg locates the point of transition in  the cult of Asclepius :  "Asclepius, the ancient god of heal­ ing, carries a serpent coiling around his healing staff as a  symbol .  His features are the features carried by the world  savior in the plastic art of antiquity. " 72  In a highly emotional passage, Warburg shows how  ABY WARBURG'S KREUZLINGEN LECTURE  </page> <page sequence="44"> I 02 early images of Asclepius identify him with the serpent  itself: " It is  he himself who winds around his staff. " The  serpent is  the site of violence and regeneration combined:  "The snake also reveals by its own ability to cast off its  s lough, s lipping, as  it were, out of its own mortal re­ mains, how a body can leave its skin and continue to  live . " The serpent is Warburg.  The serpent is the site of the uncanny and the ambigu­ ous. It is  transmitted through Western culture, through  the Hebrew and Christian Bibles and Greek mythology  into the syncretism of medieval and early modern mani­ festations through the rationalizations of modernity. The  road to enlightenment deepens the uncanny and the am­ biguous .  Warburg tells of an image of Laocoon that he  had spotted in a church in Lüdingworth, near Ham­ burg-close to home . In this image, Laocoon is redeemed  by Asclepius . What does this happy end represent ? Is  it  the force of enlightenment ? Or is it the enlightened claim  to truth which is, in truth, an act of censorship, the sup­ pression in narrative and representation of the violence  of the world ? Must the visual image itself be reclaimed  from the censorship of Lessing, restored from the claim  of sophrosyne to the shock of Virgil's words ?  The conclusions to Warburg's foray into comparative  ethnography offer dialectical imagery of Hopi America  and the modernized landscape of United Stat es expan­ sion. Modern America has no need, Warburg suggests,  for the serpent as an explanation of lightning . The mod­ ern American does not worship the serpent; he kills it .   Warburg then introduces a coda on the question of pagan  culture versus rationalized, disenchanted modernity. He  recalls the episode with the schoolchildren at Keams Can­ yon as the manifestation of empirical cultural flux and  normative cultural ambivalence .  The education provided  to these children by the Indian School Service will speed  this process of acculturation and modernization.  Invok­ ing Plato, he asserts, " Children stand before a cave . To  MICHAEL P. STE INBERG  </page> <page sequence="45"> lift them up to the light is the task not only of  American I 0 3  schools but of humanity in general . "  But, he warns-with  the help of a photograph of a Gilded Age gentleman  strolling beneath a power line-the conquerer of the cult  of  the serpent is "Uncle Sam in his stovepipe hat, strolling  in his pride past a neoclassical rotunda . Above his top hat  runs an electric wire . In this copper serpent of  Edison's ,   he has  wrested lightning from nature . "  Warburg's con- cluding tones are unambiguous :   The American of today is no longer afraid of the rattle­ snake. He kills it ;  in any case he does not worship it .  It now  faces extermination. The lightning imprisoned in wire­ captured electricity-has produced a culture with no use  for paganismo What has replaced it ?  Natural forces are no  longer seen in anthropomorphic or biomorphic guise, but  rather as infinite waves obedient to the human touch. With  these waves ,  the culture of the machine age destroys what  the natural sciences, boro of myth, so arduously achieved:  the space for devotion,  which evolved in turo into the  space required for reflection.   The modern Prometheus  and the modern I carus ,   Franklin and  the Wright brothers, who invented the diri­ gible airplane, are precisely those ominous destroyers of  the sense of distance, who threaten to lead the planet back  into chaos .   Telegram and telephone destroy the  cosmos .  Mythical   and symbolic thinking strive to form spiritual bonds be­ tween humanity and the surrounding world, shaping dis­ tance into the space required for devotion and reflection:   the distance undone by the instantaneous electric connec­ tion.  Warburg thus ends his lecture with an expression of  sympathy for an auratic, mythical past as opposed to the  disenchantment of rationalized modernity. Yet crucial to  the movement of his argument is his retention of the no- ABY WARBURG'S KREUZLINGEN LECTURE  </page> <page sequence="46"> I 04 tion of distance . Warburg's growing sympathy with a  mythical or magical cosmology thus has nothing whatso­ ever to do with the nostalgia for an undiffentiated com­ munity characteristic of a Stefan George or a Heidegger.  If, during the course of most of his work to this point,  Warburg had defined distance as the effortful creation of  rationality and modernity, won by Luther and the Refor­ mation from the magic of pre-Renaissance religious prac­ tice , he now sees distance as a legacy of an auratic past  that is  compromised by modern technology. Distance is   the dignity of the subj ect and is,  as  such, the product of  difficult cultural work, at no time a given, and in no way  a presumable privilege of the modern world.  The Critique of Aestheticism  In his persona as a "German scientist " ( a s  he was identi­ fied on his letter of introduction from the Department of  the Interior ) ,  Warburg observed the spread of the white  American empire and the c10sing of the western frontier  from the standpoint of a German citizen born on the eve  of Prussian supremacy and the Gründerzeit of the Ger­ man Empire. Through this lens, primitive cultures as well  as ancient ones gathered new re1evance . Despite his Ger­ man posture, Warburg's sympathy was for the subj ected,  for the Pueblo Indian whose imagery, culture, and com­ merce were being replaced by those-literally, in the im­ ages he stressed-of Unc1e Sam. Surely the paralle1 of the  wandering American Indian minority and its "primitive "  traditions ( remember that Warburg used the quotation  marks ) to that of the Jews in imperial Germany occurred  to him. The American Indians and the German J ews faced  similar predicaments of assimilation and orthodoxy.  But to neither the German Jewish predicament nor  the American Indian did Warburg's attitude evince senti­ mentality. In his  lecture of 1 6  March 1 8 97,  Warburg  MICHAEL P. STE INBERG  </page> <page sequence="47"> warned against the sentimental and romantic image of I O  5  the American Indian which had informed German imagi- nations . In both cases, the modern incarnation of the pa- gan or the " primitive " represented chaos and danger. The  problem was that the obvious alternative-the rej ection  of the primitive, the faith in rationality and sophrosy�e­ appeared itself as a romantic alternative , an aesthetic  ideal that faded as  society or the individual reached for it .  In the 1 923  lecture notes, Warburg described his im­ pulse to travel to the West in terms of the wish to escape  the " aestheticizing art history" of his training. His ma­ ture treatment of cultural representation remains consis­ tent with this position.  The interpretation of images­ and the dynamic images of ceremonial dances-require  the recognition of cultural violence, of demons .  These  forces cannot he aestheticized; on the contrary, the image  of Laocoon proves that aesthetic ' form can hav e only lim­ ited power over cultural violence. In this respect, the aes­ thetic analysis of  Warburg is  anti-aestheticist; it stands  militantly on the critical side of  European intellectual  life, next to Benj amin, and opposite,  ultimately, the fas­ c i s t  e n e r g i e s  tha t p r o c e e d  a c co rd i ng  t o  the   aestheticization o f  politics .   Warburg's 1 923  Kreuzlingen lecture, replete with its  potential for self-conscious theatricality, represents an  intellectual as  well as  a personal and therapeutic moment  of achievement . Clearly, for Warburg, the two categories  had to exist together. There is  no synthesis  here: he did  not reconcile the primitive and the modern, the chaotic  and the rational,  certainly not the formless (which has  nothing to do with the "primitive " 'anyway)  and the  formed .  But through the act of scholarship and criticism,  he placed the two in front of his eyes and gained perspec­ tive on their ambivalence and ambiguity in relation to  each other. Insofar as these elements were part of himself,  he was able to look at himself. Of the varied relationships  between a late-nineteenth-century German " self" and a  ABY WARBURG'S KREUZLINGEN LECTURE  </page> <page sequence="48"> 1 0 6  pnmltlVe " other, "  the sentimental Orientalism o f  Karl  May is at one extreme, where the other has no subj ectiv­ ity and the self reimposes its preexisting ideologies .  AI­ though it seems inappropriate to describe Aby Warburg's  intellectual style according to any kind of extreme, it  seems certain that his critical and cultural passion de­ rived from a lifelong refusal to delineate boundaries be­ tween self and other, personal and cultural-and this dur­ ing a period when the abnegation of the ideology of cul­ tural identity was not a popular intellectual alternative .  The last period of Warburg's life , from his return to  Hamburg in 1 924 to his death in October 1 929 ,  called  for the refocusing of his social and cultural paradigms.   As his health returned, he paid more attention to the in­ stitutional growth of the Warburg Library in Hamburg.  The library enj oyed a productive relationship with the  newly founded University of Hamburg and strove as  well  to e s tab l i sh  internat iona l  contact s .  In  th i s  context ,   Warburg sought to resume and retain contacts  with  American institutions in order to revive h i s  work in com­ parative ethnology.  "On the whole 1 feel  much better whenever American  friends visit " ( Überhaupt, wenn Amerikanische Freunde  kommen, geht es mir gleich besser ) ,  wrote Warburg to  Paul J. Sachs in October 1 926 .  Sachs was the associate  director of the William Hayes Fogg Museum at Harvard  University from 1 923  until 1 94 8 .  As the son of Louisa  Goldman and Samuel Sachs, he had abandoned banking  for art in a manner that attracted Warburg's sympathy.  They corresponded enthusiastically between 1 925  and  1 928 , 73  In the fall of 1 927,  Warburg wrote a memorandum to  his brothers emphasizing the importance of these Ameri­ can contacts as well as  the continuing centrality of his  work on the Hopi to his evolving scholarship . Most spe­ cifically, he was determined to make a second American  j ourney, and for this he needed his brothers' financing , 74  MICHAEL P. STE INBERG  </page> <page sequence="49"> He singles out Paul Sachs in Cambridge and also Franz 1 07  Boas and his student Gladys Reichard at Columbia Uni- versity. Reichard had j ust visited him in Hamburg. He  also mentions "Washington, " by which he presumably  means the Smithsonian .  (James Mooney had died in  1 92 1 ,  and Warburg does  not  seem to hav e had contact  with his successors . ) His goal is  to form an "organic con­ nection "  between the Warburg Library and these institu- tions, with a series of seminars devoted to the theme of  " the tradition of antiquity for modern cultures as  a life  problem. " As for his own role,  Warburg envisioned a  three-month trip for early 1 92 8 ,  during which he would  lecture at the Fogg on "pagan-ancient tradition in the  mirror of European art " and at Columbia on " the signifi- cance of ethnologic American research for the fundamen- tal principIes of cultural studies . "  He had already corre­ sponded with Boas about this latter initiative . On this  American j ourney, he says, he will no longer have the en- ergy for a sid e trip ( ein Abstecher) to Arizona and New  Mexico .  "1 must admit, " he says, "1 am a very bad trav- eler. " The return to America ,  he suggests,  will close a  circle defining his life 's work:  When 1 look back on my life 's j ourney, it appears to me  tha t  my func t ion  h a s  b e en  to  serve  the  wate r sheds   [Wetterscheide] of culture as  a seismograph of souls .  Pos­ ited from my very birth in the middle ground between Ori­ ent and Occident, driven by the force of elective affinity to  Italy, where in the fifteenth century the confluence of pa­ gan antiquity and Christian Renaissance caused an entirely  new cultural persona to emerge, 1 was also driven to travel  to America in the service of extrapersonal causes,  in order  to experience life there in its polar tension between pagan,  instinctual forces of nature and organized intelligence .   On 28  December 1 927, Warburg wrote to  Paul Sachs  about his proj ected return to America ,  stating that his  ABY WARBURG'S KREUZLINGEN LECTURE  </page> <page sequence="50"> r o S  chief goal was to build bridges between the young and  old of the American academic world and those of the old  and new Europe . He also asked Sachs to help persuade  "my loving and caring brothers " (Paul and Felix in New  York ) of the advisability of the trip : "1 would then have  the chance once again to see America,  which 1 have loved  with unyielding force for thirty-three years . " 75  Warburg's second American j ourney never material­ ized .  He did, however, return to Italy in 1 929  for a last  extended visit .  His timing proved savagely ironic . Having  worked through the presence of his own demons, he wit­ nessed the return of the demoniac to European culture .   The story is told by Arnaldo Momigliano :  Gertrud Bing, the Director of the Warburg Institute, used  to tell with great gusto a story that apparently has not  found its way into the biography of Aby Warburg by Ernst  Gombrich . Bing happened to be in Rome with Warburg,  the founder and patron saint of the Warburg Institute, on  that day, February 1 1 , 1 929 ,  on which Mussolini and the  Pope proclaimed the reconciliation between Italy and the  Catholic Church and signed a concordat, the first bilateral  agreement to be reached between post-Risorgimento Italy  and the Church of Rome . There were in Rome tremendous  popular demonstrations, whether orchestrated from aboye  or from below. Mussolini beca me overnight the "man of  providence , "  and in such an inconvenient position he re­ mained for many years . Circulation in the streets of Rome  was not very easy on that day, and it so happened that  Warburg disappeared from the sight of his companions .  They anxiously waited for him back in the Hotel Eden, but  there was no sign of him for dinner. Bing and the others  even telephoned the police . But Warburg reappeared in the  hotel befare midnight, and when he was reproached he so­ berly replied something like this in his picturesque Ger­ man: "You know that throughout my life 1 have been inter­ ested in the revival of paganism and pagan festival s .  Today  MICHAEL  P. STE INBERG   </page> <page sequence="51"> 1 had  the chanee  of  my l i fe to  be  present  a t  the r e - I 09  paganization of Rome, and you complain that 1 remained  to watch it . " 76  Warburg apparently witnessed the return of pagan  demons with a certain remove and a tone that reflected  his own inner sophrosyne . But even this position, bal­ anced and altogether charming as it is ,  is  not to be ro­ manticized .  How are we to read Warburg's tone : as comic  distance or as savage irony ? Does the secure sense of dis­ tance Warburg shows in representing Italian fascism as a  pagan comedy appear as a failure or as a success  of his  long-germinating method of negotiating the dangerous  realities of cultural demons ? The heritage of distance, of  critique and subjectivity, is the heritage defeated by the  repaganization borne by European fascism, and we can  only gues s  whether Warburg's  comic representat ion  meant for him a strategy of avoidance, an unspoken pro­ gram for v ictory, or a t rag ic  r ea l i za t ion  of defea t .   Mussolini's victories were succeeded by  Hitler's . I n  late  1 93 3 ,  four years after Warburg's death, the Warburg li­ brary and its method were removed from Hamburg to  London  and  thus  ext rac ted  from a context  where   Denkraum-the space  for  refl ect ion-had be  en  de ­ stroyed.

For a b ibliography of Voth's writings as  wel l  as  other information,  see Peter M. Whiteley, Deliberate Acts: Changing Hopi Culture through the  Oraibi Split (Tucson, 198 8) .  Voth's photographs, as  well as  other materials,  are in the Mennonite Library and Archives, Bethel College, North Newton,  Kansas .  Whiteley argues,  with considerable evidence, that Voth was reviled  among the Hopi for " subjection of Hopi re ligio n to open scrutiny [which] ran  directly counter to Hopi practice " (p . 84). Whiteley quotes the Mennonite  historian Alfred S iemens as  follows : "The first Mennonite missionary ro the  Hopi, H .  R. Voth, was an aggressive evangelist and anthropologist.  He gath­ ered many Hopi artifacts, made intensive study of their customs, vocabulary,  and religion, and wrote carefully and voluminously about them. But he, as   had the Catholic fathers before him, also antagonized them. The present mis­ sionaries feel  they are still  the objects of  a resentment that was aroused by  pioneer missionaries" (p . 85).  Whiteley also cites Voth's daughter's descrip­ tion of him (in a 1982 interview) as  "a harsh man, definitely not gemütlich . "   Whiteley writes nevertheless that "Voth made sorne friends i n  Oraibi .  H e  was  clearly in sympathy with sorne Hostile [ i . e . ,  antiassimilationist]  views and oc­ casionally served as intermediary with government agents. As the only resi­ dent white who could speak Hopi fluently, he was trusted by sorne to interpret  government policie s "  (p . 85). This is  significant in  the light of Warburg's  1923 recollection :  "Through years of  contact with the Indians he won their  trust, and he paid as  little heed as  possible to his  own missionary tasks .  He  studied the Indians, bought up their products, and developed a hefty business  MICHAEL  P. STEINBERG   </page> <page sequence="53"> in the trading of these obj ects . As a result of the extraordinary measure of  I I I  confidence he enj oyed,  it was poss ib le  to photograph them during their   dances,  something that their fear of  being photographed would otherwise  never have al lowed.

Warburg a l so  corresponded,  between January and  March 1 905 ,  with Emil  Bibo of the Cubero Trading Company, which special­ ized in Acoma pottery. Bibo sent Warburg films of matachin dances as  well a s   still  photographs .  In one  of Bibo's letters, he mentions his brother, Solomon,  by this time residing in San Francisco. This i s  a figure of considerable interest .   A German Jew, Solomon Bibo arrived in Santa Fe in 1 8 69 ,  founded the trad- MICHAEL P.

The  United Stat es authorities ,  and finally the Acoma themselves, grew suspicious  of Bibo's motives, and he ultimately fled to California.  One wonders what  Warburg's reaction might have been to this German Jewish predecessor in the  Southwest.  See Gordon Bronitsky, " Solomon Bibo, " New Mexico 6 8 : 8  (Au- gust 1 99 0 ) :  9 8-102 .

Warburg's French phrase, true to his characteristic love for mottoes, derives  from Emile Zola: "J 'exprimerai toute ma pensée en disant qu'un oeuvre d'art  est un coin de la création vu a travers un tempérament" ( "AII  my thinking can  be described by the definition of a work of art as  a corner of creation seen  through a certain temperament .

Assuming  that Warburg was aware of his  source in deriving his  own phrase, we might  speculate about the replacement of " temperament" with "Kodak " :  the substi­ tution of technology and the technical eye for sensibil ity.  62 .

The published German lecture text of 1 9 8 8  contains addi­ tional such examples .  In Warburg's description of the solo dancers accompa­ nying the humiskachina dance at  Ora ib i ,  the phrase  " extremely coarse   [ ü b e r au s  d e rb e ] " had a t  one  po i n t  read a s  " p l a i n  i ndec en t  [ d i r ek t   unanstiindige ] " (Schlangentritual, p .  40 as  opposed t o  1 9 3 8  manuscript,   Warburg Archive ) .  The fol lowing paragraph was first restored in the 1 9 8 8   edition: "The simulated pantomimic animal dance i s  thus a cultic act o f  the  highest devotion and self-abandon to an alien being. The masked dance of so­ called primitive peoples is  in its original essence a document of social piety "  ( Schlangenritual, p. 27 ) .  I have noted earlier that the " fortress rationality "  position, which Warburg so clearly turns away from in the writing of the lec­ ture, has continued to control the reception of h is  thinking, especially that  of  Gombrich.
