A NOTE ON ROBERT LOWELL'S POETRY Quem quaeritis in sepulchro, O Christicolae? -Iesum Nazarenum crucifixum, O Coelicola. -The English Quem Quaeritis ROBERT LOWELL, who won the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry in 1946 with the volume Lord Weary's Castle,1 is viewed by a number of contempo- rary critics as the present best hope of American poetry; and, since critical interest in his work has been high for more than ten years, he warrants consideration by the serious student. This discussion will be concerned with some aspects of the Pulitzer Prize volume, a fact which obviously limits the range of the poetry examined; but such a procedure is not unfair to the poet, for the collection is a representa- tive sampling of his best work. Except for a greater interest in the narrative built upon the dramatic monologue-an interest already evident in at least two poems in Lord Weary's Castle-the work ap- pearing subsequent to the prize volume shows no marked character- istics not found in the 1946 book. Indeed, the later poems demonstrate the weaknesses rather than the strong points of the earlier work. Critical interest has concerned itself largely with four aspects of Lowell's writing: thematically, his Catholicism and his radicalism; technically, his traditionalism and his violence. But the terms are mis- leading. The Catholicism-which is at least three-quarters anti-Cal- vinism-is certainly ubiquitous; the radicalism is a curious mixture of Jeremiah, St. Francis of Assisi, and Karl Marx; the traditionalism resides largely in technical detail-and that with a difference-; and the violence is both thematic and technical to an explosive degree. For an understanding of the collection we have, aside from the poems themselves, two clues furnished by Lowell. In a note2 he tells us that the title-which is not the title of any poem in the book- comes from an old ballad: It's Lambkin was a mason good As ever built wi' stane: He built Lord Wearie's castle But payment gat he nane . .. In a prescript3 he prays: 1 Robert Lowell.

In view of the emphasis of the book and the sentiment of the Latin quotation, it seems possible that Lowell means Lambkin to be Christ, Lord Weary to be mankind smothered in acedia, and the castle to be the structure of salvation. But, of course, other logical meanings can- not be overlooked. The exploitation of the poor by the rich is a re- current theme in the book, and the stanza fits the idea. Also, for Lowell, the inertia of habitual sinful behavior-built by the individual man, as it were, stone by stone-is the donjon-keep of damnation, and one of the major evils against which he inveighs. In a more self-pitying and personal poet, one might suspect the stanza to be the poet's cry against an unappreciative audience; but this construction applies to Lowell only if he is being ironic. Presumably the volume is both com- memorative and didactic; but the saints are hard to find-except in intaglio-, and the passio-in both senses-is far more prominent than the devotio. One avenue of investigation which may be fruitful for the under- standing of a comparatively young poet is the influence exerted upon his work by other writers. In specific poems-titled as "after" various poets-the tribute of imitation is paid to Rimbaud, Valery, Rilke, and Sextus Propertius.4 In his introductory note he mentions that he has borrowed a line from C. F. MacIntyre (whose name he misspells), an ardent proselyter for T. E. Hulme, Laforgue, Baudelaire, and Rilke. Other poems name or implicate, in an approving sense, Vergil, Dante, Hawthorne, and Melville; in a pejorative sense, Bunyan, the American Puritans, Unitarianism, and transcendentalism. Other in- fluences, less specific but equally definite, can be found. "The Quaker Graveyard in Nantucket," if it leans heavily on Melville for both matter and manner, also looks to Milton for its rhetorical effects. The trick of deliberate ambiguity, the Janus-word, though deriving orig- inally from Donne, probably arrives at Lowell through Pound, Eliot, and Auden. The interest in Propertius and Dante and the copious use of phrases and full lines in Latin and Italian also point to Pound and Eliot, though the non-English quotations in Lowell are thoroughly integrated into the prose sense. Crashaw almost certainly lurks behind meditations like "As a Plane Tree by the Water," and the couplet that Lowell employs for narrative and for satire seems closer to Crashaw (for example, in "For Hope") than to any other poet, especially in the violent enjambements in mid-phrase and the free use of short lines. The social protest stems from many sources, though Cobbett is the only specific mention that Lowell makes. The Catholicism comes 4 Strictly speaking, these are not "imitations." They range from fairly close para- phrases, like the Rilke, to loose adaptations like the Rimbaud. 118</page><page sequence="3">WILL C. JUMPER from Church tradition, the Vulgate Bible (especially the Old Testa- ment), and the huge body of Latin and vernacular writing which the Church has accumulated, but it comes as well from Dante and Crashaw. Its corollary is the anti-Calvinism which motivates, I think, Lowell's interest in Hawthorne and Melville and which certainly defines his attitude toward Bunyan, Mather, Hooker, and Edwards as well as toward Unitarianism and its pantheistic offspring. Randall Jarrell5 says of Lowell's poetry: The organization of the poems resembles that of a great deal of traditional English poetry . . ., but often this is complicated by stream-of-consciousness, dream, or dramatic-monologue types of structure. This is true, as we shall see, but the complication is far commoner than the simon-pure form. Elsewhere in his essay, in a passage which is in- tended to be complimentary and which was approved by Lowell for publication in the Ciardi volume, Jarrell says: The things in Mr. Lowell's poems, have, necessarily, been wrenched into formal shape, organized under terrific pressure, but they keep to an extraordinary degree their stubborn, unmoved toughness, their senseless originality and contingency. This statement is remarkable for more than the punctuation-which has been carefully reproduced. If we remove the first comma, replace the fifth comma by a semicolon, and understand that "formal shape" refers only to structural details, we have in the words of a warm ad- mirer of Mr. Lowell most of what we should want to say in criticism of his techniques. And, obligingly, Mr. Jarrell has also furnished us with the text for the other major objection when he says, what is permanently excessive is a sort of obstinate violence or violent obstinacy of temperament and perception. In a day when poets wish to be irresistible forces, he is an immovable object. This violence is exemplified by the sonnet "The Soldier," in which Lowell lifts the predicament of Buonconte of Dante's Purgatorio from its context and, by means of odd juxtaposition, fallacious theology, and building rhetorical tension, creates a diatribe against war that is brutal, poetically shocking, and metaphysically violent to the ex- tent of lacking unity as a poem. In "The North Sea Undertaker's Complaint" the problem is a different one. The poem suffers partially from the employment of a non-existent plot-or at least a plot not existent in the poem itself. 5 John Ciardi, ed. Mid-Century American Poets. (New York: Twain Publishers, Inc., 1950), p. 164. All the quotations from Jarrell will be found in this volume, pp. 158-67. Rather than writing his own prose introduction, Lowell suggested the re- printing of Jarrell's discussion. ig9</page><page sequence="4">THE HUDSON REVIEW But the big problem lies in the use of private language at crucial points in the poem: Now south and south and south the mallard heads, His green-blue bony hood echoes the green Flats of the Weser, and the mussel beds Are sluggish where the webbed feet spanked the lean Eel grass to tinder in the take-off. South Is what I think of. It seems yesterday I slid my hearse across the river mouth And pitched the first iced mouse into the hay. Up to this last line, although there is too much repetition, some idio- syncratic enjambement, and occasional overly-conversational diction, the poem has employed excellent detail for recreating the scene. But what does the eighth line mean? It may mean "and buried the first dead priest," but there is no way of proving it; and the line seems un- duly slangy if that is the meaning. It continues, clearly in a somewhat Laforguian vein: Thirty below it is. I hear our dumb Club-footed orphan ring the Angelus And clank the bell-chain for St. Gertrude's choir To wail with the dead bell the martyrdom Of one more blue-lipped priest; the phosphorus Melted the hammer of his heart to fire. Again, what does the last line and a half mean? Up to this point we can assume that the dramatic monologue presents the undertaker's anti-clericalism and his blase view toward death as opposed to the "normal" and perhaps sentimental view. But why "phosphorus"? Why the strange concluding figure? Is he still equating the priest to a mouse? Is the phosphorus to be taken as the common poison for rodents? If so, how does it fit into the plot of which we have only a fragmentary glimpse? Even if, as has been suggested, the phosphorus is to be identi- fied with the phosphorescence of the aurora borealis, and therefore with the killing cold of the North Sea, how does it fit into the poem? The all-important-for a sonnet-final line has shot off in a com- pletely unrelated direction and shattered the unity of the poem. Whether obscurity or obscurantism, it is bad writing. These two sonnets show some of the ways in which Lowell employs the "psychological organization" of his experimentalist mentors as opposed to the "logical organization" of traditional poetry. However minutely one may wish to break down structural methods of poetry for purposes of clarification and classification, it is obvious that repe- tition with variation, rational progression of argument, and narrative (or balanced combinations of these) are basically and traditionally "logical" modes of construction. It is equally obvious that what Yvor 120</page><page sequence="5">WILL C. JUMPER Winters calls pseudo-reference, qualitative progression, and the double mood (when it is truly double rather than consciously employed for controlled contrast) are basically "illogical." Defenders of the latter types of organization have seized upon the valid researches of psy- chologists into the irrational aspects of human behavior-for the purpose of more complete rational understanding-and have made these data the basis of a justification of irrationality on the grounds that, if illogical, such organization is psychological, that is, true to the structure of uncontrolled sensory-emotional experience. If poetry is to be no more than an attempt at reproducing sensory-emotional experience, then the method is perfectly justified. But if poetry is to be a rational evaluation of both intellectual and sensory-emotional experience, the method is inadequate to the poetic purpose. We take away from "The Soldier" a memory of violence, that is, both poetic shock and emotional shock, and a memory of skilled metrical and aural effects. From "The North Sea Undertaker's Com- plaint" we take away a memory of purposeful obscurity and a some- what cheap irony. The metrical structure is accurate, if unsubtle, but the suggestion lingers that the final lines say what they do partly be- cause "phosphorus" and "fire" rime with "Angelus" and "choir." The poem "After the Surprising Conversions," on the other hand, works with logical and frightening clarity from beginning to end. It uses narrative as its framework in a monologue of letter form. The material derives from a post script which Jonathan Edwards appended to a letter on the "surprising conversions" occurring in the mid-eighteenth century. The recipient was Reverend Benjamin Colman, and the added note tells him of the suicide of a "man of some renown," actually the uncle of Edwards. Lowell picks up the phrases and psychology of Edwards and expands with material derived from the narrative proper and from his own imagination. He has Edwards report the deplorable wave of defections from the Church set off by the suicide. As spiritual adviser, he seeks for all the plausible reasons he can find: "He came from melancholy parents," he had "too much or little wit," he took to reading Scripture for himself, "meditated terror, and he seemed / Beyond advice or reason." But finally the minister admits what he considers to be the real cause of the trouble, a privatio Dei: "The breath of God had carried out a planned / And sensible withdrawal from this land." The poem ends with the minute and characteristic, but essentially meaningless, scrutiny of nature for symbolic insights which we find in much Puritan writing: September twenty-second, Sir, the bough Cracks with the unpicked apples, and at dawn The small-mouth bass breaks water, gorged with spawn. The apples are unpicked because the whole town has begun to neglect the Puritan imperative to labor; what the bass means is purely in the 121</page><page sequence="6">THE HUDSON REVIEW realm of metaphysical speculation. The real point of the poem is, of course, that there is no room in the theocracy of New England for the person who takes the tenets of Calvinism seriously-that the man who perseveres in pure Calvinistic meditation ends either as a suicide or as a heretic. The form of the poem is the Crashaw couplet-without the irregular line length. At line ends phrases break over violently, and strong masculine rimes are used to define the form despite the run- over. This latter quality at times becomes annoying as a conscious device, but otherwise the structure is firm and the poem as a whole most successful in its revelation of character and theme. Here Lowell employs the means of traditional poetry to achieve a logical and satisfying result. It would be misleading, however, to leave the impression that in the volume one poem in three is logical and traditional. In the whole volume of forty-two poems, only "Salem," "Children of Light," "At a Bible House," "Charles the Fifth and the Peasant, 1790," "The Ghosts," and "The Fens" can be classified with "After the Surprising Conversions" as largely free from various kinds of obscurity and thoroughly logical in construction. It may be significant that, with one exception, these eight poems are concerned either with anti- Calvinism or with socio-political protest, themes with which Lowell is deeply concerned as a polemicist. Other poems, to be sure, like "As a Plane Tree by the Water," have only a small area of willful obscurantism, or at least of the exploitation of not discernibly logical relationships. But many of the poems are marred to a greater or less degree by the extremely private nature of the concepts employed. To be fair to Lowell, we must take note, moreover, of the excellence of not a small part of the writing in Lord Weary's Castle. A number of poems are, in whole or in part, brilliantly realized. Whole poems which fall into this classification are "The Ghost," a monologue spoken by a dead mistress and derived from Sextus Propertius; "Salem," an ubi sunt sonnet that errs only slightly in overdoing its onomatopoeia; "At a Bible House," the portrait of a dying Calvinist; "Mr. Edwards and the Spider," a pyrotechnical handling of a Jonathan Edwards sermon which might be the best poem in the book but for occasional idiosyncrasies; "After the Surprising Conversions," already commented upon; and "Where the Rainbow Ends," an amazing piece of rhetoric which sells itself despite its confusions. Very few of the poems lack some redeeming lines, and sections of other poems are worth mentioning. Whether or not it is derived from W. C. Williams, the second stanza of "New Year's Day" is imposing even when it loses itself in obscurity. Sections IV and VI of "The Quaker Graveyard" are completely successful in what they set out to do. In "Between the Porch and the Altar," a confusing treatment of the Oedipus theme, section III ("Katherine's Dream"), though marred by some abrupt 122</page><page sequence="7">WILL C. JUMPER shifts in progression, is a highly effective dramatic monologue which gathers commanding power as it works to the end. Of his technique, we can say that Lowell has, when he chooses to employ it, an effective command of traditional poetic disciplines. Generally, however, he uses traditional rhetorical and verse forms within an experimental structure. He is addicted to violent material, violent juxtaposition, and erratic imagery and figure, all of which often make the relationship between the "what" and the "how" of his poems difficult to discover. What of the themes? Randall Jarrell says quite accurately that the poems revolt against: the Old Law, imperialism, militarism, capitalism, Calvinism, Author- ity, the Father, the "proper Bostonians," the rich.... What Jarrell does not say is that Lowell's Catholicism is almost en- tirely equated with this revolt. For Lowell, Catholicism is the negative of every one of these bogeymen except authority-and he is extremely ambivalent in his attitude toward the authority of the Church. Specifi- cally he refers to "the church whose double locks, / Wait for St. Peter, the distorted key." One can hardly avoid the conclusion that Lowell chose the Catholic Church as much to outrage his Calvinistic heritage as for any other reason. He prays to Mary: Mother, for these three hundred years or more Neither our clippers nor our slavers reached The haven of your peace in this Bay State: Neither my father nor his father. ... He is violent and specific in the poem "Children of Light": Our fathers wrung their bread from stocks and stones And fenced their gardens with the Redman's bones; Embarking from the Nether Land of Holland, Pilgrims unhouseled by Geneva's night, They planted here the Serpent's seeds of light; And here the pivoting searchlights probe to shock The riotous glass houses built on rock, And candles gutter by an empty altar, And light is where the landless blood of Cain Is burning, burning the unburied grain. "Nether Land of Holland," "unhouseled by Geneva's night," and "Serpent's seeds of light" are all specific and unmistakable identifica- tions of Calvinism with Satan. "Empty altar" denies the validity of the Protestant dispensation; and the two closing lines, still using the light in an ironic sense, indicate that only the power to destroy their own potentiality remains of their once great driving force. A complete revulsion from such a concept of Calvinism would involve either ab- 123</page><page sequence="8">THE HUDSON REVIEW solute irreligion or Catholicism. For Lowell's mind, steeped in Chris- tian humanistic values, the only possible choice was Catholicism.6 There is evidence to support this analysis. When we turn to the poems treating directly with religious subjects, we are struck by the negativism of the poetry. Here are the concluding lines of three medi- tations: 0 Christ, the spiralling years Slither with child and manger to a ball Of ice; and what is man? We tear our rags To hang the furies by their itching ears, And the green needles nail us to the wall. And lion-taming Satan bows and loops His cracking tail into a hangman's noose; He is the only happy man in Lent. He laughs into my face until I cry. On Ninth Street, through the Hallowe'en's soaped glass, I picked at an old bone on two crossed sticks And found, to Via et Vita et Veritas A stray dog's signpost is a crucifix. These come, respectively, from "Christmas in Black Rock," "The First Sunday in Lent," and "The Crucifix." Jarrell states that the poems are all built upon the basic struggle between what is "closed, turned inward, incestuous, that blinds or binds," and what is "free and open, that grows or is willing to change . . ., the realm of freedom, of the Grace that has replaced the Law, of the perfect liberator whom the poet calls Christ." Jarrell is basically correct in this analysis, but he overdoes his conclusion that Lowell's emphasis is on the "open" rather than the "closed." The prophet of man's imminent doom speaks more loudly than the guide to the new light. Even the poems which attempt a positive solution do it less than half-heartedly. "Christmas Eve under Hooker's Statue," a most effective Jeremiad, piles up bitterness upon bitterness: "How the long horn of plenty broke like glass / In Hooker's gauntlets," "I ask for bread, my father gives me mould," "Where is the summer garden? In its bed/The ancient speckled serpent will appear." All it can offer at the end is: "But we are old, our fields are running wild: / Till Christ again turn wanderer and child." "Where the Rainbow Ends," the concluding and summarizing poem, gathers 6 Jarrell's explanation is simpler: "The poet's rather odd and imaginative Catholi- cism is thoroughly suitable to his mind, which is so traditional, theocentric, and anthropomorphic that no images from the sciences, next to none from philosophy, occur in his poems. Such a Catholicism is thoroughly suited to literature, since it is essentially literary, anthropomorphic, emotional." This seems unfair to Lowell, Catholicism, and literature. 124</page><page sequence="9">WILL C. JUMPER together almost all the major themes and points them to the question: "What can the dove of Jesus give / You now but wisdom, exile?" The answer is the nearest thing to a positive statement that Lowell can make: "Stand and live, / The dove has brought an olive branch to eat." Jarrell interprets this: The dove of Jesus brings to the worshipper the olive branch that shows him that the flood has receded, opening the whole earth for him; it is the olive branch of peace and reconciliation, the olive branch that he is "to eat" as a symbol of the eaten flesh of Christ, of atonement, identification, and liberation. Even if this hyperbolic expansion of the figure is indicated, it does not balance the deadly weight of the particulars of the whole poem-and it is hard to believe that Lowell does not know that olives eaten from the branch are painfully bitter. Lowell is a serious, intelligent, gifted, and powerful-albeit some- times misguided-poet. He is basically a poet of revolt, and that revolt is specifically directed against the Calvinism of his heritage, which he identifies with the Old Law of the Hebraic dispensation, and against all the historical, social, political, and economic patterns of a New-England-led America. But, like the Saxon who could de- nounce the conquerors only by learning the Norman language-and thereby began to be Normanized-, Lowell adopts the "poetic vocabu- lary" and the habits of mind of the opposition. He leans toward or- ganization by reverie and association, the acceptance of a solipsistic universe, which is the ultimate product of the disappearance of God from the Ockhamist-Calvinist conception of being. In his denial of Calvinistic total depravity, predestinarianism, and faith without works, he does not reach the affirmation of Aristotelian-Thomistic reason, freedom, and individual responsibility. He does not find the joy of the risen Christ, nor the emancipation of rational Christianity. He has not escaped the tragic Christ and the voluntaristic universe of Calvin. To the "whom seek ye in the sepulchre" of the angel, he has an- swered, "Jesus of Nazareth who was crucified." But he has not yet heard the message of the angel nor yet learned to sing the "Alleluia, resurrexit Dominusl" 125</page></plain_text>
