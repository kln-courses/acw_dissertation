<plain_text><page sequence="1">Andean scholars have long debated the nature of the relationship between two Middle Horizon (ca. A. D. 750-1000) Andean states; many assumed Tiwanaku dominated Wari and preceded Wari in time. Recent research at the Wari administrative center of Cerro Baul in the only known region occupied by both states (the Moquegua Valley of southern Peru) indicates that Tiwanaku may not predate Wari in Moquegua and that, contrary to previous assertions, both states occupied the valley for the last three centuries of the Middle Horizon. In support of this position, I review recent excavations at Cerro Baul. Then I present eight new 14C dates and summarize the evidence for two major construction episodes at Cerro Baul. I interpret the local Wari construc- tion chronology based on the 12 14C dates now available from excavation contexts and I suggest that the new data, in compar- ison with 24 published 14C dates from other Wari centers, support a later date for Middle Horizon IB Wari expansion than previously postulated. Los arqueologos andinistas han venido discutiendo desde hace mucho tiempo la naturaleza de las relaciones entre los dos esta- dos andinos principales del Horizonte Medio (750-1000 d. C.) asumiendo mayoritariamente que Tiwanaku domino a Wari y que lo precedio en el tiempo. Investigaciones recientes en el centro administrativo Wari de Cerro Baul, en el valle de Moquegua en el sur del Peru, la unica region conocida por haber sido ocupada por los dos estados, indican que Tiwanaku no precedio a Wari en Moquegua y, contrariamente a aserciones previas, que los dos hablan ocupado el valle durante los ultimos tres siglos del Hori- zonte Medio. En apoyo de esta posicion, evaluo excavaciones recientes en Cerro Baul que incluyen exploraciones en los sectores publicos y residenciales. Las investigaciones revelan evidencias de fuertes conexiones con la capital Wari, y evidencias en con- textos ceremoniales de interaccion entre Wari y Tiwanaku. Presento a continuacion ocho nuevas fechas 14C y resumo la evidencia de dos episodios principales de construccion en Cerro Baul. Interpreto la cronologla constructiva Wari local en base a 12 fechas 14C disponibles de contextos excavados en el sitio y sugiero que los nuevos datos, en comparacion con 24 fechas 14C publicadas de otros centros Wari, apoyan fechas mas tardlas par la e.rpansion durante la Epoca IB, con una duracion de inf uencia imperial Wari hasta ftnes del primer milenio d.

They shared major motifs and perhaps shared similar beliefs. Yet, they occupied distinct geographic areas, with Wari expanding throughout the central sierra from its cap- ital in Ayacucho, and Tiwanaku centered in the Tit- icaca Basin colonizing valleys east and west of the altiplano. Traditional chronologies have placed Wari after Tiwanaku state development, with a later impe- rial expansion yet earlier collapse than the Tiwanaku state. The late expansion of Wari has led to specula- tion that Wari iconography was derived directly from Tiwanaku (Ponce Sangines 1980; Posnansky 1945). Recent research is revising this speculation, however, and more recent explanations suggest coeval devel- opment of Middle Horizon ideology, a shared icono- graphic and belief system that characterize both Wari and Tiwanaku (Cook 1994; Isbell and Cook 1987; Schreiber 1992). A unique perspective on the nature of the Wari- Tiwanaku relationship can be gained from Cerro Baul, the only Wari administrative site known to date that over- laps spatially andtemporally withTiwanaku settlement systems. Although Tiwanaku ceramics have been recov- ered from other Wari provincial areas, as they have in Cusco, archaeologists have not yet demonstrated over- lapping settlements as they have in Moquegua. In this paper, I present the results of my excavations at Cerro Baul, and I evaluate the excavation data and site chronol- ogy in relation to Tiwanaku settlement in the valley as well as to Wari imperialism.l Relations Between Wari and Tiwanaku Wari was first defined as the source of a major cul- ture by Tello in the 1930s (Tello 1942). Before that CERRO BAUL: A WARI CENTER ON THE TIWANAKU FRONTIER</page><page sequence="2">68 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 12, No. 1, 2001] time, most archaeologists believed that there were differences between the ceramics called "coastal Tiahuanacoid" and classic Tiahuanaco. However, most scholars believed the Peruvian materials were somehow derived from the altiplano Tiwanaku tra- dition(Schreiberl992:75;Uhlel903).Later research described a style emanating from the Wari capital that extended all over Peru, evidently the result of rapid expansion. Menzel's (1964) ceramic chronology linked Wari expansion to the spread of Middle Horizon Epoch 1A and especially 1B ceramic styles into the Ica Valley of southern Peru. This period of expansion is usually dated toA.D.600 to 700. The following Wari ceramic Phase, Epoch 2, has more secular motifs that Menzel (1964:69-70) attributes to a crisis and reorganization in Wari cul- ture and dates to A.D. 700 to 800. Epochs 3 and 4 represent the collapse and aftermath of Wari and the development of regional ceramic styles based on pre- vious Wari styles and are traditionally dated to A.D. 800-1000. Tiwanaku ceramic chronology, while not as well defined as that of Wari, is postulated to represent an organized polity that emerged in the late fourth cen- turyA.D. and endured into the eleventh centuryA.D. and perhaps slightly later (Ponce Sangines 1972). The Tiwanaku chronology has been divided into five phases. The last two of these, Tiwanaku IV and TiwanakuV, are found locally in the MoqueguaVal- ley and are known as the Omo and Chen Chen Phases respectively (Goldstein 1989). The Moquegua sequence begins later (A.D. 500-725 for the Omo Phase) and ends earlier (A.D. 725-950 for Chen Chen) than its altiplano source (Goldstein 1993), but there are still very few absolute dates for these phases. New evidence is likely to shift the absolute dating of these phases substantially, perhaps even nullifying the existence of a Tiwanaku IV Omo Phase. Given these established chronological sequences, it is tempting to see Wari as short-lived, with a rise and fall all within the time span of Tiwanaku hege- mony. The similarity between Wari and Tiwanaku iconography is also very strong, with both traditions depicting the Front Faced Deity or the Staff God as the paramount being or sacred figure. In tenns of both style and form, Wari and Tiwanaku ceramics are dis- tinct assemblages and are segregated spatially on a regional level (Lumbreras 1974; Schreiber 1992). Thus, it is still tempting to see Tiwanaku as the source of much of the Wari iconography, perhaps cross-fer- tilized with influences from the central sierra and Nasca, and then spread by Wari warriors moving across the Andes (Menzel 1964). Despite the many shared designs in iconography, each polity had its own style of monumental archi- tecture. Tiwanaku emphasized sunken courts and massive mounds with masonry adornment, mega- lithic gateways, and imposing stelae (Posnansky 1945). Rarely ornamented with carved stone, Wari building focused upon grand compounds of stone masonry with high walls and multistory interior gal- leries, courts, corridors, and rooms (Isbell et. al 1991). Although provincial centers served different functions, their monumental architecture provided visible statements of the political power of their respective capitals and reflected the canons of archi- tecture in the principal city. Furthermore, changes in architectural styles in the capital are evident through- out each of the imperial realms. Wari architecture included the patio-group style (Schreiber 1978; Spickard 1983) and D-shaped temples in the heart- land and at Honco Pampa and Cerro Baul (Cook 2000). The Tiwanaku temple mounds found through- out the altiplano and the province of Moquegua are constructed in the style of the principal pyramids of the city of Tiwanaku itself (Bermann 1993; Gold- stein 1993). Wari corporate architectural styles are reflected in imperial administrative centers in the provinces, especially in areas where direct control was estab- lished. The level of political complexity of the con- quered region was often instrumental in determining whether an administrative center in the imperial style was established. Areas characterized by little local political complexity called for more direct forms of control, while administrative structures in more polit- ically complex societies met the need for adminis- trative centers with existing social institutions and facilities. However, other factors besides the level of local political complexity may have been important in the establishment of administrative centers. Bor- der zones, transportation hubs, and resource-rich locales also received special attention (Schreiber 1992:30). Frontier provinces, especially, often receive a disproportionate amount of attention and direct control in order to define imperial boundaries and promote political integration (Doyle 1986). Empires are dynamic entities, and the functional roles of imperial administration can change through time. Imperial reorganization and recentralization</page><page sequence="3">REPORTS 69 Figurc 1. Map of thc Moquegua Vallcy and thc locations of Ccrro Baul and thc major Tiwanaku settiemcnts. may lead to the reform of the administrative system, and thus to changes in the material correlates of polit- ical control (Doyle 1986). Alterations in the manner of political control may be reflected in the archaeo- logical record through changes to imperial adminis- trative sites (Schreiber 1992). In the case of Wari, these adjustments may be reflected in the emergence and perpetuation of the patio-group architectural style (Schreiber 1978; Spickard 1983), but the absolute dating in both the capital and the provinces for this phenomenon remains uncertain. The introduction and continuation of corporate architectural styles throughout the geographical realm of a polity is not unique to the Middle Hori- zon in the Andes. Chimu rural administrative cen- ters contained the same architectural components as the capital at Chan Chan, and the U-shaped audien- cia appears in predictable locations as a symbol of state power (Keatinge 1982). The precedent for the audiencia and storeroom architecture of Chimu administration is found in the Moche V components of sites like Pampa Grande (Day 1982) and Pacat- namu (Keatinge 1975). Inka provincial architecture also is marked by internal consistency, and some architectural elements show they followed the canons of the capital. The kancha and the kallanca are found throughout the Inka imperial realm, and it is quite probable that the former developed out of Wari influences and local developments in the Cuzco region (Hyslop 1990; Topic 1986). In reference to provincial Wari, it is imperative that both architectural form and con- struction style be traced back to its development in the heartland as a corporate style (Moseley 1979). Some of the most significant findings that bear on these issues come from the only shared frontier between the two Middle Horizon polities of Waii and Tiwanaku for example, the MoqueguaValley (Fig- ure 1). The Tiwanaku occupation of Moquegua has been the subject of intensive study, most notably by Paul Goldstein (1989, 1993). Tiwanaku settlement</page><page sequence="4">70 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY lVol. 12, No. 1, 2001] Figure 2. 3D GIS model of the architectural (white) and agricultural (black) remains associated with the Wari colony at Cerro Mejia (left) and Cerro Baul (center). focused in the middle valley (1000-1500 masl) where a three-tier settlement hierarchy complete with relict field systems has been identified (Goldstein 1989; Williams 1997). TheTiwanaku occupation did breach the high sierra, as Bruce Owen (1998) has recently reported, but its largest settlements, monu- mental works, and agrarian fields were all concen- trated in the middle valley. Until recently, we believed that Tiwanaku colonists arrived in the Moquegua Valley first, perhaps around A.D. 500. A brief hiatus between phases IV and V has been posited by Gold- stein ( 1989), but the Tiwanaku occupation of the val- ley was fairly continuous until the tenth centuryA.D. Most archaeologists believed thatWari arrived a cen- tury later and occupied the high sierra for no more than a century (Moseley et al. 1991). Recent radio- carbon dates from Cerro Baul do not support this proposition, but rather indicate that the Wari occu- pation was nearly as long as the Tiwanaku presence in the valley. Excavations on Cerro Baul Excavation of the Wari occupations on the summit of Cerro Baul, the administrative and ceremonial center of the Wari colony in the Moquegua Valley, has pro- vided insight into 1) the duration of Wari occupation of the region, 2) the relationship between the provin- cial center and the Wari capital, and 3) the nature of interaction with Tiwanaku colonies in the region. This Wari colony is located on a high sierra intervalley ridge between the Rio Moquegua tributaries of Torata 1 *r ST- Ms * * - ana lumllaca trlgure z. The Warl sltes were lmked by the longest canal ever built in the Moquegua sierra, and the settlement system is crowned by the Wari administrative center on the high mesa (2590 masl) of Cerro Baul. The flanks of Cerro Baul and the adja- cent mountain, Cerro Mejia, were covered by agri- cultural fields, remnants of which exist today. The fields around Cerro Baul probably did not support agrarian production for export outside the colony, but may have produced enough to support the extantWari population (Williams and Sims 1998). The remains on the summit of Cerro Baul can be divided into two distinct types of architecture: masonry public architecture on the very summit of the mesa and smaller households with stone foun- dations on the eastern slopes. The masonry buildings are large, similar to the buildings in administrative centers to the north and to buildings at the capital of Wari itself. The latter are elaborate versions of the domestic terraces that grace the slopes of the moun- tain and the adjacent Cerros Mejia and Petroglifo. The architectural differences between these two areas are important; construction of the public buildings likely required a mandate of the state, or at least local leadership. Due to the greater variety of resources and the bureaucracy involved, reorganization of large public works should take place less frequently than minor changes in domestic architecture. The resi- dential architecture is organic, and continual remod- eling can be organized at the household level. Domestic architectural revisions involve fewer resources, and can be undertaken more frequently.

Map of the summit architecture at Cerro Baul, documenting the 5 summit sectors and the location of all excava- buildings of this administrative center of the Wari set- tlement. This administrative site contains patio-group architecture in the Wari style, a D-shaped structure, and craft productionhabitation areas. The Cerro Baul Excavation Project over the past three years has iden- tified three distinct sectors in the architectural core on the summit (Figure 3). The eastern sector (A) is referred to as Uminaniyoq, the artisan residence area, because artifacts associated with lapidary work were recovered from excavations here. The central sector (B) of the architectural core is referred to as Willka kancha, the ceremonial sector, given the nature of the constructions in units 1 and 5. The western sector (C) of the architectural core, named Hatun Kancha, is composed of large rectilinear plazas flanked by gal- leries. Two uninvestigated sectors lie to the west. Sec- tor D is an architectural compound surrounding a large boulder at the highest point on the mountain, and sec- tor E is a raised platform toward the western end of the hill separated from the main architectural compo- nent of the site by more than three hundred meters. Public Architecture Excavations in the public architecture at the site include three units in the ceremonial sector B (1, 5, and 8) and two units in sector C (3 and 6). Unit 1 is a 12 m by 8 m trapezoidal plaza surrounded by halls on three sides in sector B (Figure 4). Robert Feld- man's 1989 excavations in structures 1 and 2 were the basis for his assertion that this locale was the site of ritualized reciprocity between elites in the form of large-scale consumption of an intoxicating bev- erage (Feldman 1998). In our excavations of structure 4 in 1997, the accouterments of this ceremonial drinking event fine ware serving and storage vessels in the forms of keros, cups, and urns were found broken in an ash layer upon the floor. This deposition layer represents a single episode that I interpret as a ritual offering that ceremonially interred this hall at the end of the Wari occupation of the cerro. The excavations in unit 1 provide evidence for activities of high-level ritual importance, as well as documenting the longevity of Wari occupation on the summit; evidence indicates that the structure was significantly remodeled dur- ing the Wari occupation of the summit, and the 4 radiocarbon dates processed from this unit reflect a distribution from cal A.D. 530-1220 (see Table 1). Located 20 m to the northeast of unit 1, unit 5 is also located within sector B. This architectural fea- ture is one of two D-shaped structures at the site. The principal room is a 10 m diameter circular hall with</page><page sequence="6"> Figure 4. Plan of the standing walls in excavation unit 1, including the foundations of disassembled phase 1 walls.

Its form parallels similar structures in the Mon- jachayoq, Vegachayoq Moqo, and Cheqo Wasi sec- tors of Wari, as well as D-shaped structures at Conchopata and Honco Pampa. All these D-shaped halls have approximately 10 m diameters, except for Vegachayoq Moqo (20 m) and Cheqo Wasi (5 m) (Cook 2000). Excavations in unit 5 focused on the northeast- ern half of the interior of the D-shaped structure, the front exterior face of this Hall, and the agglutinated rooms to the northeast (Figure 5). Burning events were associated with the abandonment of area D2 and the exterior of sbructure GN, and the agglutinated rooms were intentionally filled with sand and whole ceramic vessel offerings upon the unit's abandon- ment. A radiocarbon date processed on a charcoal sample from Area D2, originally part of the last roof of that structure, dates to cal A.D. 770-1000, cali- brated 2 sigma. A second carbon date from a wood post found on the floor of the interior of the D-shaped hall dates toA.D.770-1020, calibrated 2 sigma (see Table 1). These dates, which are statistically equiv- alent, combine to provide a date range of A.D. 780-990, calibrated 2 sigma. Although these data do not preclude an earlier construction date for the D- shaped temple complex, they do indicate that its final use was contemporary with the last phase of occu- pation in unit 1 and based on radiocarbon age would be dated to Middle Horizon Epoch 3, although the architectural form is one that is classic Wari-Ayacu- cho style (Cook 2000). Offerings of ritual artifacts were also associated with the construction of the complex. A metallic foil camelid, approximately 2 cm across, was recovered from fill beneath the floor in the center of the D- shaped hall. A cache of gourd bowls, one of them engraved with designs featuring a lizard and an anthropomorphic being with antennae and avian head hands, was excavated from a subfloor pit on the western exterior side of the circular wall. Further- more, the interior of the circular wall was coated with a plaster surface and painted various times in shades of red, white, and blue-gray. The dedicatory con- struction offerings and the treatment of the complex at its abandonment reflect the importance of this space to the ritual life of the community.

The few cul- tural materials were recovered from this excavation included a small quantity of plainware ceramic sherds and gourd seeds. A radiocarbon date of A.D. 77&gt;1000, calibrated 2 sigma was obtained from a piece of a burnt wooden pole that supported the ele- vated floor of this structure. The lack of associated cultural material makes functional interpretations of these structures difficult, but our preliminary hypoth- esis is that rooms A and C were storage structures whose raised floors kept products elevated above the earthen surface. Further excavations in structures B and C and similar architectural forms in sector C will need to be undertaken to evaluate this theory. Across the plaza in structure E, the architecture is constructed of a more refined masonry style incor- porating double walls, interior benches, and a finely finished stucco interior. There was no evidence of a raised floor, nor was any roofing material recovered in the excavation of structure E as was identified in upper levels of structures A and D. Few cultural materials were associated with the floors of struc- ture E, although there were some late fire pits asso- ciated with the latest floors in the structure. Two radiocarbon samples extracted from these hearths dated to cal A.D. 54s710 and A.D. 71s990, cali- brated 2 sigma. The earlier date is likely wood from a veiy early construction context that was burned in a secondary use context. The later date likely repre- sents the period in which the fires were burnt and the surficial structure was constructed. It is statistically similar in date to the wood from a construction con- text in the four-room complex in the southwest cor- ner of unit 3. Structures of similar masonry construction style and similar dimensions to structure E are located 20 m to the northeast of unit 3 in unit 6 (Figure 8). Three rooms, 10 m by 3.3 m, sit side by side facing a plaza that measures S0 by 25 m. Excavations in the east- ern half of the central room, structure B, revealed interior benches that ran the length of either wall 1 m above the well-made floor. Unlike unit 3 structure E, this room originally had two stories. A fallen lat- tice of 1&gt;20 cm diameter poles was discovered within the structure's wall fall matrix. k one small area, a floor made by placing flat stone slabs covered with clay over the lattice was preserved, clearly defin- I - Wall2 _ :_ a 4 2 t:g0Sitruttuxr§:23 _- l: 1' E :1: .f 2 S tn ] l 0 : ]d ] F: f:: :d r :: s [21 excavated area z Phase 2 wall R _ Dismantiedphase 1 waii 2 meters Figure 6.

Beneath this floor, the top surface of several ear- lier walls appeared, indicating a prior architectural configuration completely distinct from the architec- ture visible on the surface. Although we lacked the resources to completely excavate this earlier archi- tectural phase, it is clear that it was intentionally filled in order to provide a platform for the new occupation surface, and that parts of what were originally three distinct architectural spaces were covered to create one large platform, presumably open to the air. Seventy-five meters west of unit 8, in sector C, is one of the large plazas and associated galleries that comprise this sector. Unit 3 (Figure 7) is an open air patio, 25 m on a side, with a complex of four 2.5 m by 6 m rooms in the southwest quadrant.

LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 12, No. 1, 2001] 76 halls of sector C, however, opened onto plazas S to 10 times as large as the open air patios of sector B. What these areas shared was a common construc- tion style and similar basic architectural elaboration. The residential architecture differs significantly from this pattern. Residential Architecture Two units were excavated in the residential sectorA (2 and 7), and one additional unit (4) was located out- side of the surface architectural remains to the south of the site in order to obtain context information on a cache of 93 obsidian points recovered from a looter's back-dirt pile in 1993. Unit 2 is an area orig- inally excavated by Feldman in 1989 and amplified by ourexcavations in 1998 (Figure 9). It is comprised of 4 excavated rooms, designated A through D from north to south. The nature of constructions in this area were of a substantially different style and scale than in the public architecture at the site. Structure A was a S m by S m open plaza that was ultimately used as a trash dump, but was originally an outdoor activity space associated with structure B (2 m by 5 m), which is connected to A through a doorway on the south side of the plaza. The south wall of structure B serves as a retaining wall for structure C an 8 m x 6 m open air plaza that is elevated 1 m above and does not communicate with structures A and B below and to the north. Structure C does interface with the originally roofed structure D (7.5 m x 4 m) through a doorway on the southeast corner of the plaza. Different living levels are common in sector A, with adjacent architectural spaces having large ele- vation differences. These altitude differences, how- ever, do not imply separate households. Unlike unit 2, the 5 m by 5 m open air plaza (A) in unit 7 does not articulate with the 3 m x 5 m roofed room (B) with which it shares a wall to its east (Figure 10). Instead, structure B communicates with an unexca- vated plaza below and to the east, while a small stair- case leads up and to the north to a higher level from structure A. Although manipulations of elevation vary, the basic architectural unit in sector A is distinctive: a small (S to 8 m on a side) open air plaza that articu- late with an smaller (2 to 4 m by 5 to 7 m) roofed room. The interior roofed room typically contains a raised platfolm 1 by 2 m covered with flat stone slabs that forms a table or grinding surface and large quan- tities of undecorated ceramic wares, botanical and - - - 4 meters z excavated area z Phase 1 wall ing the lattice work as a floor rather than a roof. The second story must have been greater than 1.5 m above the earthen floor, since the side walls are preserved to that point and there is no evidence that the poles were secured below that point. The position of the fallen poles also indicate that they must have been secured well above the 1 m bench. Based on the vol- ume of wall fall excavated from the structure, its original height is estimated to have been between 4 and S m. The excavations in the public architecture at the site exhibit a clearly ritual or ceremonial nature in some areas, while other areas were apparently cleaned out but not ritually interred. The differential treatment upon abandonment between units in the ceremonial sector (which were intentionally burned or filled with ceramic offerings) and in the sectors of the large plazas is significant and there is a sub- stantial difference in the use of space and architec- tural forms. D-shaped halls and long galleries fronting 1&gt;12 m long plazas is the norm in sector B. These spaces were not designed to accommodate large numbers of people, but they are clearly supe- rior in quality and scale to the residential architec- ture at the site. The large, sometimes multistoried</page><page sequence="11"> Figure 10. Plan of the standing walls in excavation unit 7, including the foundations of disassembled phase 1 walls. animal remains, and the debris of residential activ- ity. The plazas have similar materials, although not as densely distributed. Furthermore, evidence for stone working in lapis, onyx, and obsidian was dis- covered in these residences in the form of polishing stones, debitage, and a few finished stone beads and obsidian projectile points. Thus, the residential areas of sector A housed very different activities than are documented in the monumental architecture higher on the summit. The scale of plazas and associated rooms is appreciably smaller than in either sectors B or C, and the masonry construction style is more rustic than is noted on top. Public monumental and private residential architecture are clearly differen- tiated on Cerro Baul based on construction style, scale, and the varied activities that they housed. Evidence For Two Building Phases In three of the excavation areas in the monumental constructions on the Cerro Baul summit, evidence for an earlier construction phase in the form of decon- structed wall foundations has been recovered. In sec- tor B, unit 1, structure 3, a well-preserved and very finely made floor was discovered in the 1989 exca- vations. This gallery was composed of an intentional fill of earth and rocks predating the ultimate use of the unit. In structure 2, a segment of the floor was REPORTS 77 constructed in this highest quality manner, while the majority of the room contained a stratigraphically higher, more rustic floor. Here we also noted that an earlier set of walls existed in this area in association with the well-made floor. Thus, the construction evi- dence indicates two phases, the second of which involved partial deconstruction of the first. Based on the available evidence, the first phase was apparently a U-shaped gallery surrounding a plaza. Interest- ingly, the areas in which the full widths of these rooms are preserved vary between 2.3 and 2.35 m. The second phase involved the constriction of the plaza size, the deconstruction of certain walls, the interment of the finely made floors, and the con- struction of a new set of galleries in a trapezoidal pat- tern, all with a width between 2.3 and 2.35 m. Just 50 m southwest of unit 1, excavations in sec- tor B, unit 8 revealed a set of wall foundations that formed a 1.75 m wide gallery oriented approximately 30 degrees off the Wari architecture that is preserved on the surface. The earliest phase of occupation in this unit is represented by walls 3, 6, and 7, which form the boundaries of structures 1, 2, and 3. Dur- ing a major remodeling event, these three walls were partially dismantled to create a new activity space. Walls 1, 2, and 4 were constructed to enclose this new space, and the floors and wall foundations of the original rooms were interred with fill and cov- ered by a new floor surface. Thus, the three original structures were concealed by a large platform or plaza enclosed on the north and east by walls 1 and 2 and open to the south and east, except for wall 4, overlooking the Tumilaca Valley 600 m below. In addition to the evidence for a reconstruction event in two units in sector B, excavations in sector C, unit 3 also indicate an earlier construction phase that is not represented on the surface. Structure E, the 12 m long hall with dual entrances, sits upon the foundations of an earlier structure that was oriented east-west instead of north-south. Below the floor sur- face associated with the walls of structure E, the foot- ings of an earlier stone masonry wall that had been disassembled were exposed by excavation. This wall was bisected by structure E and its foundations con- tinue under structure E's western wall into the later phase patio. An early phase floor that abutted this wall to the south was revealed during excavation, and it is probable that the southern wall of structure E may have also served as the southern wall of this early phase structure. If so, the early phase room measured - l -b I : l [2 excavated area a Phase 2 wall N - - - = 4 meters</page><page sequence="12">78 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 12, No. 1, 2001] Year A. 9lA ibr-atF ne) h) re cn w o O 0 0° 0 0 0° dating the time the wood was harvested and not the date the wood was burned. Wood is scarce in the region and the site is several hundred meters above the meager wood sources near the valley floors. Due to resource scarcity and accessibility, it is unlikely that wood was brought to the site exclusively for use as fuel, or other nonconstruction contexts. Thus, it is likely that all the beams were originally brought to the site as construction material and radiocarbon dates best represent episodes of construction activ- ity. An examination of the radiocarbon date distrib- utions within the monumental sectors of the site indi- cate that the majority of dates represent two major phases. Based on the evidence for earlier construc- tion phases at the site, it is likely that the date distri- bution represents two separate episodes of tree-felling associated with the major construction events. One felling episode was associated with the founding of the settlement and the other with a period of reconstruction during which the large plazas on the eastern half of the architectural core were most likely constructed. These construction episodes can be more accurately dated by combining the radio- carbon dates from each construction phase in order to contract the range of standard deviation inherent in the analysis. The three first-phase radiocarbon samples (including one sample from sectorA) produce a com- bined, calibrated date with a two sigma range of A.D. 600 to 685. These dates represent the first construc- tions on Cerro Baul and indicate that the establish- ment of the site almost certainly took place in the seventh century A.D., and likely took place around the middle of that century. The six second-phase dates produce a combined, calibrated two sigma range of A.D. 780 to 990 with a one sigma range between A.D. 885 and 965, and all second-phase dates proceed exclusively from the monumental sec- tors of the site. The two sets of dates are consistent with two episodal construction events; the probabil- ity that a single phenomenon is being dated passes a chi-square test at the .05 confidence interval in each case. The phase twoT-value is 1.9 with aT-crit- ical value of 1 1.1 at the .05 level. The phase one T- value is 0.3 with a T-critical of 3.8. It is also interesting to note the context informa- tion from each of these radiocarbon phases. The three early dates all come from secondary use of the wood beams, in construction fill, in a hearth, or in a burnt h) re o o o o Figure 11. Distributions of calibrated 14C dates from Wari sites.

Twelve radiocarbon dates have been processed from Cerro Baul to date (Figure 11). Of these 12, three emanate from the residential sector A. These three dates represent the organic household remod- eling that took place throughout the habitation life of these structures. They do not represent the state- instituted construction projects characteristic of the monumental core of the site. The remaining nine dates from the area of public architecture bear on the issue of construction and reconstruction at an insti- tutionalized scale. All radiocarbon dates are from wood beams, most from an intact, but burnt, con- struction context and others from the final burning episodes in small hearths within the architectural compounds. It is imperative to remember that we are</page><page sequence="13">REPORTS 79 offering context, one from each investigated sector of the site. Of the six samples that date to the second construction phase, three are in primary construction contexts roof or floor beams that have collapsed, one was burnt in a shallow hearth, and the other two are part of an offering event in the ceremonial sec- tor unit 1. These latter two samples also probably rep- resent primary construction contexts since it appears that the fuel for this offering event was probably the last constructed roof of the structure. One additional late date was also collected from the unit 1 offering context and may represent an erroneous second- phase date or could represent the youngest com- bustible material included as part of the offering fuel. All of the second-construction-phase l4C dates come from sectors B or C of the site. The lack of late dates from sector A suggests it was not involved in the later massive construction event, presumably because of the lack of public architecture in this sec- tor of the site. If these interpretations are correct there was a massive reconstruction event aroundA.D. 900 at Cerro Baul. Furthermore, this event mirrors changes taking place elsewhere in the Wari realm. Construction Events at Other Wari Sites The phase 2 construction event from which half of Baul's l4C dates are derived is manifested in the cer- emonial buildings and the patio groups, both of which conform to the D-shaped structures and patio groups found at other Wari provincial centers. At the site of Jincamocco in the SondondoValley, Schreiber documents a Wari occupation of Epoch 1 B that con- tinues into Epoch 2. The construction style follows the patio group canons seen in MH 1B in the capi- tal, and an earlier Wari (1A) presence is not in evi- dence, although a local village did exist at the site before the administrative center was built. Two radio- carbon samples were processed to date the con- struction of the Wari complex (see Figure 11). One date came from below a well-preserved plaster floor in a room that contained fancy Wari Polychrome ceramics and returned cal A.D.350-1000 calibrated two sigma. The second date from a piece of wood in the mortar of a subfloor canal dated to cal A.D. 65s1250 calibrated two sigma. A carbon date from a secondary trash deposit of Wari related materials dated to 61s1030 calibrated two sigma (Schreiber 1992: 193). The larger error ranges on these dates make them statistically comparable to one another and represent the airival of the patio-group style as is seen in phase 2 at Cerro Baul. The combined cal- ibrated date range overlaps quite well with the sec- ond construction phase from Cerro Baul, with a cal A.D. date of 66s980 calibrated two sigma. It is also interesting to note that Schreiber finds evidence that Middle Horizon 1B Ocros pottery may have contin- ued to be used into Epoch 2, a trend also noted at Cerro Baul (Schreiber 1992:229). In the Wari heartland at Azangaro, Anders indi- cates that Wari construction and occupation of this planned, administrative center was confined to Epoch 2. The three radiocarbon dates from the site (Anders 1991) (seeFigure l l)produce acombinedcalibrated date of cal A.D.890-1030 A.D., calibrated 2 sigma, closely comparable to the set of six dates combined from the second construction phase at Cerro Baul (cal A.D. 78s990, calibrated 2 sigma). Furthermore, Anders (1991) notes the presence of two trapezoidal structures in the south sector of the site, represent- ing one of the ultimate phases of construction in the formal architectural compounds. This form parallels the trapezoidal structures formed by new wall con- structions in the second phase of construction both in units 1 and 8 at Cerro Baul, significantly altering the pattern compared to earlier phase walls in both units. At Wari itself, Isbell (1997) has proposed a chronology for the capital city, but further absolute dates must be obtained to test the veracity of this model. However, if the model is accurate, the length of occupation and the major imperial changes tak- ing place in the ninth and tenth centuries A.D. throughout the Central Andes were also reflected in the architecture of the imperial center. Besides Cerro Baul, the only Wari site with more than five provenienced radiocarbon dates is Pikillacta in the Cuzco region (McEwan 1991). Radiocarbon date distributions from Pikillacta manifest the same four-century occupation as is evident at Cerro Baul (see Figure 11). If the dates from Pikillacta con- struction contexts are isolated from other types of dates, they do fall into an early and late phase. How- ever, early and late dates correspond to the same struc- tures in some instances and the phases are not as tightly defined as at Cerro Baul. The analog to Cerro Baul'smonumentalsectorC Pikillacta'ssector2- has produced six radiocarbon dates, four of which rep- resent secure construction contexts.

A.D.880-1160, calibrated 2 sigma was obtained from carbonized wood from the upper story (McEwan 1996). Combining the two early phase Pikillacta dates results in a calibrated 2 sigma range of A.D.640-810 as compared to the early phase range of A.D.60(}685 at Cerro Baul. The combination of the two later dates from Pikillacta sector 2 results in a two sigma range of A.D. 780-1020, whereas the Cerro Baul second- phase combined two sigma range is A.D. 780-980. It seems that the broad pattern changes seen at Cerro Baul with the second phase of construction were per- haps reflected in structural remodeling on a more modest scale at Pikillacta. It is nevertheless signifi- cant that changes in the use of Pikillacta, very likely an actual decline in new constructions and invest- ments at the site (Glowacki 1996), were taking place at about the same time as the second construction phase was occurnng at Cerro Baul. Radiocarbon dates of the architectural remodel- ing in Wari imperial style seem to be slightly earlier in the northern Wari realm. John and Theresa Topic (1985) have suggested that northern sierra architec- tural styles are present in the Wari center at Vira- cochapampa at an early date. The two radiocarbon dates from that site (cal A.D. 130-540, calibrated 2 sigma and A.D. 750-1450, calibrated 2 sigma) are not vew informative (Topic 1991: 159) (see Figure 11). However, dates from other probable Wari sites in the region indicate a predominance number of samples in the range of A.D. 500 to 700 (Topic 1991:159). Schreiber (1992:271) argues that Vira- cochapampa was never the focus of formal Wari con- trol; thus relying onViracochapampato inform about changes in Wari administration is problematic. At Honco Pampa, another Wari Administrativo center in the northern realm in the Callejon de Huay-</page><page sequence="15">REPORTS 81 las, Isbell's excavations produced 4 radiocarbon dates that combine to produce a two sigma range of cal. A.D.640-780 (see Figure 11). Wari imperial ceramic styles were scarce, but can be predominantly ascribed to Epoch 2 (Isbell 1989:112). It thus appears that the northern sierra experienced the expansion of the architectural reorganization before the capital and the southern provinces, a phenomenon consistent with the idea that Wari adopted certain architectural orga- nizations of the north sierra (Schreiber 1992; Topic 1991; Topic and Topic 1985) as part of the imperial reorganization associated with phase 2 at Cerro Baul. The 10 radiocarbon dates with secure contextual information, which are statistically comparable to the phase 1 building event, yield a combined calibrated 2 sigma range of A.D. 615490. If thelS radiocar- bon dates statistically similar to the Cerro Baul Phase 2 dates are all combined, the resulting calibrated 2 sigma range for this event is A.D. 890-980 (see Tables 1 and 2). It should be noted that both these ranges overlap with all the combined date ranges from within specific sites and significantly narrow the window in which these events took place if they were part of the same phenomenon. It seems most likely that the architectural constructions that con- stituted the patio-group style in sites like Cerro Baul and Azangaro emerged there early in the tenth cen- tury A.D. Discussion At Cerro Baul, a preponderance of Middle Horizon 1B ceramics is associated with the standing phase 2 architecture in sectors A and B. This association cor- relates fairly well with the data from Wari itself. In fact, there have been very few vessels with Middle Horizon 2 ceramic styles recovered from Cerro Baul, although Epoch 2 styles are present at Jincamocco (Schreiber 1992) and at Moraduchayoq in Wari (Wag- ner 1981), and are exclusively used at Azangaro (Anders 1991). A number of Andeanists have sug- gested that the patio-group style represents a major imperial reorganization, and it now seems evident at Cerro Baul. The amazing aspect of the phase 2 Baul building event is that although it falls in the same ceramic period as the other Wari examples, radiocar- bon dates are much later than most Wari scholars would attribute to MH 1B or MH 2. The clear asso- ciation of a pottery cache containing predominantly Chakipampa-style ceramics with the latest radiocar- bon dates at the site indicate that Wari peoples were at Baul in the tenth century A.D. using Chakipampa ceramics, at least in a ceremonial context. Further ceramic analysis and excavations may indicate that Epoch 2 styles were at use on Cerro Baul at this time as well, although none have yet been identified. I will not argue that these data suggest that MH Epoch 1B and Epoch 2 styles were in simultaneous use in the Wari heartland. Further radiocarbon dates from sites like Wari that bear on the patio-group con- struction style and the imperial reorganization asso- ciated with it need to be processed to address this issue. What the dates from Cerro Baul dates do sug- gest, however, is that significant new questions about the relationship between the southern colony and the Wari capital need to be addressed. Are sweeping imperial reorganizations being reflected at Baul, and if so, what is the relationship between their intro- duction in the capital versus in the provinces? One possible explanation for the architectural remodeling at Cerro Baul is that it is an entirely local event. Perhaps Baul was first established as a defen- sive outpost, as has been the assumption by schol- ars working with the issue to this point (Moseley et al. 1991). The architectural reorganization at Baul may signal a change in its role from defensive out- post to a point of ideological and economic exchange between Wari and Tiwanaku. Recent research on and around Cerro Baul certainly suggests that in the later phases (ca. A.D. 800-1000) of the Middle Horizon, there was significant interaction between Wari and Tiwanaku, including cohabitation of the upper sierra. The emerging data from other Wari administrative sites, of which much more needs to be collected, sug- gest that some major changes of a similar nature were taking place throughout the Wari realm at about the same time as the Baul remodeling. The radio- carbon dates representing these changes at multiple sites may coincidentally fall within the same range as the second construction phase at Cerro Baul, but the preliminary data from these sites is supportive of a polity-wide reorganization. Additional data need to be collected to provide the evidence to test this hypothesis. Perhaps even more importantly, what does this new information suggest about the relationship between Wari and Tiwanaku? The dates from Baul clearly demonstrate a long co-occupation of the Moquegua sierra by the two groups of people. Some of the early interpretations of the Baul ceramics sug- gested a Tiwanaku influence on some pieces. Given</page><page sequence="16">82 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 12, No. 1, 2001] the new dates and associations with unit 1 ceramic offerings, perhaps this influence may reflect a "Tiwanakuization" of an established MH 1 B assem- blage. Could it be that a principal ideological exchange between Wari and Tiwanaku was taking place late in the Middle Horizon? We also note that the abandonment of Baul roughly conforms to col- lapse of Moquegua's Tiwanaku colonies and per- haps to the end of the Middle Horizon all together. Were the Wari and Tiwanaku abandonments related? Scholars working in Moquegua have noted that several Tiwanaku sites in the valley were deliberately and systematically razed. It has been suggested that Wari was involved in the vast destruction of Tiwanaku Chen Chen-style sites in the valley (Mose- ley et al. 1991). The first dates from Cerro Baul and the interpretations based on those limited data and the established ceramic chronologies would have prohibited this involvement; according to those early data, Wari had left Moquegua before Chen Chen set- tlers had even occupied the lower valley, around A.D. 750. The new data from Cerro Baul indicate that the original proposition is chronologically possible, but the plausibility of this scenario and the relationship between peer polity interaction and imperial col- lapse awaits further study.
