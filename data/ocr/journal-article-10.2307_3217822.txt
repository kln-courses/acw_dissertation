(Read October 14, 1852.) 42 YOL. III.</page><page sequence="2">ON THE MORALITY OF THE VEDA. _ _ Rev. J. M. MITCHELL, of Bombay, has made a work of mine (Zur Literattlr und Seschichte des I2Veda, published at Stuttgart, in 1845), the subject of a special notice, whereill he commends the little volullle to the attention of the Asiatic Society in Bombay. This notice is published in the Journal of the BombafT Branch Royal Asiatic Society, No. xi. July, 1847, but has not until recently come to my knowledge. The author is grateful to Mr. Mitcllell for the favorable judgment pronounced upon his work, and feels hirtlself peculiarly rewarded for his labors in this department by the circumstance that their results have met with attention and recognition in India itself. Investigations with respect to Indian antiquity, which reach back to the very limit of the history of the human race, possess nevertheless, even for the present, a direct value. :k'or the development of the Indian people has gone on undisturbed from those early ages until now: it has never been forced from its natural course by for- eign influences; the bands have never been wholly severed which connect the latest generations with their remote ances- tors; even now, those literary monuments which, originating among this people, collduct us farther back illtO the past than any other existing works whatever (with the excep- tion, perhaps, of a very small portion of the Hebrew Scrip- tures), are still regarded as the inspired foundatioll of the national belief, and are in the hands of those whose business it is to uphold and direct that belief, the priests. What- ever contributes to the understanding of these beginnings, must also aid the comprehension of the present. And when men who combine with the culture of the NVest an intimate acquaintance with the present conditioll of India, deem worthy of their particular attention results which we have won from those ancient documents through the means only</page><page sequence="3">332 of general historical and philological research, the practical value of these results is thereby acknowledged. But the more highly I X alue the testimony to the inner truth of purely historical investigations, derived from the fact that they aid in the cotnprehension of now existing forLns of spiritual life in India, so much the more unwil- lingly would I allow to attach itself to them the reproach of " one-sidedness " which Mr. Mitchell suSers to appear in his remarks. It is this point which the following exposition is intended to illustrate. The passages in Mr. Mitchell's notice which I particularly have in milad are the followlng: "It will be see.n that he [Dr. Roth] contemplates these ancient hymns itl a purely literary point of view. It is however interesting and useful to exarnine them in another light; alld when we do so, we are compelled to form a far less favourable estimate of their character. It is true, that the general absence of anthropomorphism from the Vedic notion of divine beings, necessarily excludes tnany of the worst outrages against morality that shock us in the Pura- nas, in which the worship of deified heroes and gods assimi- Jated to men, plays so itnportant a part. Sti]l, even in this respect the Vedas are faulty; and in the character of the sacred Rishis particularly as tllese are represetlted in the commentaries on the Vedas there is much that is morally repulsive. A dialogue is given in which Yama endeavors to se(luce his tsvin-sister Yamuna. The Rishi Vasishta is assailed by the house-dog when about to steal grain. See Colebrooke, As. Res., vol. viii. pp. 401, 402. The warlike and revellgeful character of the Rishis will be afterwards noticed. Gross indelicacy (stlch as in Rosen's Rig-ATeda, pp. 214, 215) is too common to attract nruch notice. More por- tentous is the passage from the Vrihad Aranyaka, quoted by Colebrooke ut supra, p. 440. " Enthusiastic antiquarians like our author sometimes dis- like such remarks as these. But, even were we permitted to waive the claims of religion and morality, a purely lite- rary estimate of the ATedic hymils would be chargeable with that one-sidedness which the Germails generally pride them- selves on shunning." p. 406. In a similar strain is the conclusion of the notice:</page><page sequence="4">333 " Along with thorough-going German research, our author seems to possess an almost Jonesian ardour and imaginative- ness. Ee is thus able to impart no small degree of fascina- tion to his views. In his hands the old Vedic hyinns, which lie withered and sapless in our collections, like the constitu- ents of a hortus stccus} seem to burst afresh into life, and resume whatever of grace or fragrance they originally pos- sessed; so that, when we consider them in a merely literary point of view, we are free to confess that among these faded leaves there lie, potentially, charms we could little have sus- pected. WIany, however, will, we trust, approach the Vedas with yet other feelings; and recognizillg in thern the most authentic and coinplete memorial of the human milld's early aberratioils from primeval truth, will contemplate them in a far higher than merely esthetical point of view, and be enabled to deduce from those monuments, ' covered with the hoar of innumerable ages,' lessons which the human race in all succeeding times, and throughout all lands, will do well to ponder and lay serious]y to heart." p. 410. It is not diflicult for me to transfer myself to the point of view from which Mr. Mitchell has been led to such consid- erations as these. They are suggested to him by lny gene- ral estimate of the Indian antiquity which shows itself plainly enough every where in the work in question, as of a period of freshness and vigor. The discovery of such a nobler period, whose existence not long since was not even suspected (in Colebrooke appears no hint of it), must be an occasion of rejoicing to every one who has recognized even in their errors the hiC,h spiritual endowments of the Indian people. The lively exhibition of such an estimate might readily strike disagreeably one who, living among the late posterity of such an ancestry, has to struggle against their weaknesses and vices. He is naturally and unavoidably led to connect the past with the present, to seek in the former the seeds of the errors whicll flourish luxuriantly in the latter, and to regard him as partial and prejudiced who makes no mention of those errors, or at any rate leaves them in the background. Meallwhile, the author of the notice will readily concede that, in accordance witll the pur- pose had in view in my work, a complete representatioll of the life of that primitive time was not at all called for: that only brief traits could be given, and that in these it was the</page><page sequence="5">334 diSerence of that period from the middle and the modern ages tllat had claim to be made most prominent. If then the lariglgter side of tlle picttlre was exhibited, it lay in the nature of the undertakilag that it should be so. I will not, however, ref'use to respond to the challenge which seems to lie in Mr. Mitchell's words. Not that I mean thereby to acknowledge that a purely historical con- sideration of antiquity is a partial one, and a waiving of the claims of religion and morality. History has rather under a11 circumstallces an indestructible right of its own, which may be set aside in deference to none other whatever. Just as lao astronomer thinks of questioning the mathematical laws which regulate the rnotiolls of the heavenly bodies, because to tnany a biblical commentator, and even to the Catholic Church itself, tlley nzay seem irreconcilable with the passage in the telath chapter of Joshua; so will histor- ically established facts maintain their truth and value, even thougll they seem to be at variance with a narrowed Chris- tian apprehellsion of history. As in the former case the apparent contradiction is removed by a better comprehen- sion of the words of Scripture, so here too a correctly un derstood Christianity will be abundantly strong enough to allow historical truth to maintain itself without and within its lilnits, and even to make it subservient to its own purposes. But before I proceed to an exposition of mv own view of the moral value of the Indlian antiquity, I must briefly re- duce to their proper value the instances of moral error xvhich Mr. Mitchell adduces. The authority upon which they rest is Colebrooke's Essay on the Vedas or Sacred WVritint,s of the Eindus. There we read: "A very sillgular passaCe occurs ill another place [of the Riz,-Veda] colatainillg a dialogue between Yama and his twin-sister Yamuna, whom he endeavors to seduce; but his oWers are rejected by her witll virtuous expostulation." If it be considered that, according to the present conception of the Hindus, Yalna is rtller and judge of cleparted souls in the other world, from whose hancSs they receive the reward of their actions upon eartll, it will be found highly ofSensive, that the tradition shou]d make llim guilty of an attempt at so gross a critne, and particularly olle of so sensual a char- acter. And wherL once this view is taken, it will seem</page><page sequence="6">335 doubl;y scandalous that the presentation of such an occur- rence should have been allowed place in a collection of hymns regarded as sacred and inspired. This judgment, however, will undergo very essential modi- fication when the true state of the case is understood. Cole- brooke has here (a thing of rare occurrence in his thorough and careful researches) committed a serious error, and mIs- apprehended not only the text of the llymn itself, but also the commentary upon it. It is not Yama who makes the attempt at seduction, but Yami (not Yamuna, as Cole brooke writes it); and her attempt is not to seduce him, but to persuade him to a marriage with her. And the oSence which morality takes at the proceeding, assumes almost a comical appearance, when it becomes known who Yama and Yami properly are. They are, as their names denote, twin brother and sister, and are the first human pair, the origina- tors of the race ! As the Hebrew conception closely con- nected the parents of mankind by miaking the woman formed from a portion of the body of the man, so by the Indian tradition they are placed in the relationship of twins: this thought is laid by the hymll in question in the mouth of Yami llerself, when she is made to say: " even in the womb the Creator made us for man and wife." A later time, to which these alread5r fading mvths were no longer objects of simple direct belief, took offence at the idea of such a union between brother and sister, even though it were only in the tradition of the origin of the human race. And from this moral scruple sprang this hymn, wherein the poet makes Yami spend all her eloquence upon ller brother to induce him to become her husband, but he firmly refuses to comlnit such a breach of propriety. She pleads with him that the Immortals themselves desire to see posterity from the soli- tary mortal whom they have created; that their union was ordained by the C:reator; that it is not brotherly liindness in him to reJect her. But he retorts that men call him guilty who approaches his sister; that the spies of the gods, never resting, go about to take note of all that is done upon earth; $hat a time may indeed come when brother and sister shall do what their relationship forbids, but that he will not fulfill her wish. The poet himself, Mar from giving his sanction to an act of sensuality, has not suiMered even the ancient tradition of</page><page sequence="7">336 the parents of our raee to eseape his eritieising morality. To satisfy the latter he has even rendered himself guilty of tastelessness and absurdity, sinee he will not allow that union to take plaee from whieh the whole human family is to spring. H:e has not troubled himself as to how the propa- gation of mankind was to be brought about, so as only the established law of marriage be saeredly maintained. If a parallel be sought for this ease in the provinee to which WIr. Mitchell would refer the student of antiquity, it rnay readily be found in the Mosaie history. The aeeount in Genesis passes over in silence the eireumstanee that the ehildren of 2Ydam and Eve must have lived together irl eon- neetions whieh we should now term ineestuous. It beqtows not a thought thereupon, but simply holds fast to the Maet that the raee is deseended from a single pair. The Indian poet, author of our hymn, serupled and speculatecl over the diffietllty, and found an awkward solution of it, or, rather, haeked through the knot. It vvere as little reasona'ole to reekon this to his eredit as to find -fault with the Genesis for disregarding the point entirely. CErom this example, how- ever, may be seen whither we should be led, were we to take the substanee of aneient traditions for moral doetrine, and judge of them aeeordingly. The ease is not far otherwise with the seeond example quoted, yet here Colebrooke's own words might furnish means for arriving at a better understanding of it. LEfe says: " The legend belonging to the seeond of these hymns [of the seventh book] is singular: Vasisht'ha, eoming at night to the house of Varun'a (with the intention of sleeping there, say some, but as others affirm, with the design of stealing grain to appease his hunger after a fast of three dass), was assailed by the house-dog. He uttered this prayer, or ineantation, to lay asleep the dog, who was bark- ing at and attempting to bite him." H:ere then Vasishtha, famed as a model of priestly wisclom and ability, is eaught thieving; not indeed by the subjeet of the theft hirnself: his doC the saint krtew how to bann; but at least by us of an after generation. And who was the sufSerer? None other than Varuna himself, the hit,hest divilzity of the an- eielll; Indian faith, who dwells ill everlasting light, surrounded by exalted spirits and the hosts of the blest. WVhat ean have been the grain that was to be found itl his house ? The</page><page sequence="8">337 answer to that question we leave to the commentators who have invented the awkward story. It is a part of the busi- ness of the learned expositors of these ancient hymns, to specity for such of them as contain any thing beside the customary prayers and praises, some particular occasion to which each shall have owed its origin, to produce some story which shall serve as introduction to the hymn itself. Such stories have been mantlictured in great numbers (as also the biblical literature of the Old and New Testaments has called out an abundance of such productions), and so many of them as bear relation to the Rig-Veda have been gathered into a separate book, the Brihaddevata. From this work is quoted the story of Vasisht.lla's irruption by llight into Va- runa s house, whether fox the purpose of seeking a lodging, or of satisfying his hunger: after a fast, as the story adds by way of palliation. In the mass of hylans ascribed bv tradition to Vasishtha, were found sundry verses for wart- ing off the attack of a dog, and others (which, however, hardly had any original connection with the former), for calling down sleep upon all the members of a household. An attenlpt must be made to account for the occurrence of these verses in a collection of sacred hymns, and accordingly a story was trumped together, whose effect has been, it ap- pears, to fasten a spot upon the reputation of a sage who lived more than three thousand years ago, among the streams of the Pelljab. After these instances, it will probably be deemed unneces- sary that farther time be spent upon particulars. If I exert myself to defend the productions of Indian antiquity against attacks of this character, which are nzani- festly unjust, I nevertheless shall not at all allow myself to be drawn into becoming their panegyrist. And least of all should I promote an insight into the condition of those early times, were I to assemble after the same fashion an array of instances which should sllow them to have been possessed of all rnanner of excellencies and virtues. Such single selected traits may here and there be of service, as strikinffl illustrations of general observatiorls, but can fur- rlish no sure criterion of the moral value of a period or of a literature; even though, as in the cases cited, they relate to prominent individuals. For as a period of noble qualities and a literature of solid worth may exhibit many blemishes, TOL. III. 43</page><page sequence="9">338 and yet maintain their fundamental character unobscured, so also the most unworthy age may be prolific of individual instances of moral excellence, which show of only the more brightly against the dark background. If then we endeavor to gain, from the general impression made upon the reader by the productions of the earliest Indian period, a view of their moral and religious value, it will not indeed be without shadows, yet the light will prevail. The shadows are the same as rest over all antiquity, and esy ecially over periods so primitive as the one in question. Selfishness and, as its consequence, violence, are character- istics of the life both of individuals and of the community. Natiorls that are making the first advances in ciarilization win their position by struggles, by strife with their neigh- bors, by conflict with Nature. Mihoever stands in their way is their enemy, their enemy for the simple reason that he is not of them, and lays clairn to possessions, such as houses, cultivated land, palsturage, which it would be agree- able to them to call t'heir own. The hymns of the 77'eda are full of prayers to the gods for the wealth of others, of iln- precations of misfortune llpon those of other race; and later we find them trying to rid themselves of their adversaries by incantations. They covet earthly riches, and f'or its sake they serve the gods, paying them homage and offerings, in order to obtain from them in return still richer gifts, whether in the way of the blessings of fertility, or of booty to be won in battle. "If I, O Indra," says one of the bards " were master of such wealth as thou, I would be generous to him who praised me, but would bestow nothing UpOll the wicked: day by day would I give in abulldance to him who paid me honor, be he who he might. We have no dearer relati-e than tllou, vrere it a father even." (vii. 32, 18, 19.) But this selfish disregard of the ribhts of others, when the nzeans of cornfortable subsistence and animal enjoyments are in question, klaows how to cover itself with a mantle of religion. For these strangers are despisers of the true faith they oll their part wish selfishly to leep all to themselves, and give the gods llothing: they are ellemies of reliCion alld of tlle gods, and ought to be as hateful to the latter as to their worshippers. If the Greek styled all foreigners barbarians, and by this appellation e2zpressed a certain degree of contempt for them,</page><page sequence="10">339 Tooking upon himself as alone in possession -of trlle dignity and culture, it was his own manifold excellence, his own desert, upon mrhich his pride was based. Not so with the Indian; althougll he too, as well as the Iranian, had from the earliest times made the same distinction between Arian and non-Arian as tlle Greek between Hellene and Barbarian. The Arian prided himself, not upon his superiority in respect to social culture, lallguage, and the like or this at least was rlot the main element in his self-complacency, for these were ads-antages which had by no means as yet arrived at full development and appreciation but rather upon his religion: he boasted that he belollged to a nation who worshipped the true gods, and was by them guided and protected. The national pride of the Greeks was but distantly connected with their religion; with the Arian the two were insepara- bly united. He, then, who undertakes to estimate coznparatively the rnorality and religion of antiquity, will be compelled to con- cede, that the spirit of selfish aggrandizement common to all cultivated nations of the olden time, rests with the Arians at least upon a religious basis; and farther, that they present no other form of an appreciation, an over- appreciation, of themselves than is to be found also among the people of the Old Testament. If we turn our attention to domestic life, the government of the household, and relations between the sexes, we find occasion neither for special praise nor for special blame. The house is held sacred. The paternal authoritv is regarded as absolute. Polygamy is llot unknown, but evidently of rare occurrence. The wife accompanies her husband to the altar, and so joins llim in represelltillg the household there; a later period excludes woman frorn all participation in sacred things. In sexual matters the ancient Indians do not indeed deserve the praise af contillency which tlae great Roman historian bestows with adrtliration upon the Ger- mans, but neither do they exhibit that enervating sensuality to which later, in a more southern clirne, the nation becarne enslaved, and which still rests as a curse upon India. The conceptions and the language of antiquity oll subjects which later gelleral;ions have learned to cover up, are blunt and unceremonious; but there is no lustfulness in them: what is natural is situply looked at in a natural way, and the do-</page><page sequence="11">340 main of modesty is not so Mar extended as at present. One vice, however, which the Indians share with their brethren who emigrated westward, the Germans, calls here for special mention: the passion, llamely, for play, for dicing. Refer- ences to it are numerous, as well in the oldest hymns as in the later Epic poetry. Recogilition of the viciouslless of the plactice is not however wanting, and the name of game- ster is a term of reproach. And, as if by way of warning exarnple, a hymn has been admitted into the most important of the collections, the Rig-Veda, containing the complaint of a gambler, who bewails his unhappy passion, depicts its consequences, and confesses that in spite of the best resolu- tion3 he has not been able to resist the fatal temptatioll. But we shall be best enabled to assign to the ancient In- dians that place in the scale of moral culture to wllich they are elltitled, by considerilzg what were their fundamental ideas touching the laws of moral obligation, and the relation of man to the gods. Ill matters of social life it is not easy to pass seiltence upon so remote all antiquity, since we know not the precise rule by wllich they are to be judged. When, however, the recognition of eternal truths is in point, differ ences of time and place, of civilization and culture, disap- pear, and the sarne laws are in force for the past as :Sor the present. And here the diverse conceptions of individual divinities are a matter of only secondary importance: under what external forins they are imagined, and how the powers and domains of l!stature are shared ainong them all this does not affect the grand central point of the relations between the human and the divine. Accordingly. it is seen in all poly- tlleistic relit,ions, that, so SOOll as thought reaches these inner- most provinces of belief, most of the gods, who have hitherto maintained a rank nearly equal, are shaken, and are sup- planted, either by a single highest god whose subordinates they become, or by an imperfect conception of a unity of the divine principle. The aneient Indian religion exhibits here a remarkable simplicity and depth. The laws of the moral are as eternal and unchangeable as those of the natu- ral world. The same divine power has established the one and the other. This power is represented by a circle of divinities who may be most pertinently entitled the Gods of Heavenly Light. Human imagination was able to find no</page><page sequence="12">341 visible thing with which they could be compared, saving the light. Tlley are and are nalned the Spiritual. One of the old poets strives to give words to his conception of them by saying: "in them is to be discerned neither right nor left, neither before nor behind; they neither wink nor sleep; they penetrate all things: they see through both evil and good; every thing, even the most distant, is near to them; they abhor and punish guilt; sustain and support all that has life. Of this circle of seven, the sacred number, one, Varuna, is highest in rank, representing them all, as it were, com- prehending them all in his nature; and accordingly stand- ing unquestionably at the head of all the gods: his name in Greek, in the brm O0WIJOX, denotes the heaven itself. He therefore, in particular, is described as having fixed the laws by which the universe exists and moves, laws as iminove- able as if founded on a rock. As he marked out the paths of the heavenly bodies, and gave to every creature its char- acteristic powers, so he bestowed upon man reason and will and settled the bounds of the moral world, which may not be trallsgressed without detection and punishment. In all religions it may be looked upon as a sign of a moral tendency, if stress be laid upon the omniscience of tlle divine power. If the will and intention of man are to be made account of, and actions estimated not merely according to their results, the divinity must necessarily possess the attri- bute of omniscience, in order that he may direct the moral world, and judge according to desert. And this attribute is given to Varuna in full measure, and in all distinctness. He is cognizant of all that takes place, between heaven and earth, and beyond their boundaries: the winks of men's eyes are all numbered by him; when two con+rerse in secret together, he is the third who knows all they say (Atharva iv. 16); he marks the path of the wind, the flight of the bird; past and flture are present to his knowledge. In order to picture this omniscience to the conception, the an- cient poets surround him with a train of spirits, who at his command, never resting, never erring, watch the deeds of mortals. A religion which thus makes its chief divinity look into the secret recesses of the human heart-how could it Mail to recognize the nature and the guilt of sin ? Sin is a conse-</page><page sequence="13">342 quence of human weakness as well as of human wickedness, yet, as sin, it is no less punishable in the one case than in the other; and forgiveness is likewise besought of Varuna for sins that have been committed in unconsciousness. And more than once we find in these ancient prayers repentant confessions of fault, combined with supplications for its par- don, expressed in the language of simple faith. The guilt of sin is felt as a gallillg chain, and release from its captivity besought; here as elsewhere, human power can accomplish nothing without divine aid: for of himself man is not mas- ter even of the opening and closing of his eves. The punishments which await the transgressor are-be- side the loss of earthly fortune sickness and death, and, finally, exclusion from eternal happiness: these are the fetX ters with which the wicked are boutld; powers against which all struggles are vain, which they cannot escape, though they fly to the outermost limits of creatiolz. It is illdeed no clearly stated tenet of this religion, that death is the wages of sin in the sense that mortals die simply in consequence of their guilt, and, were it not for the latter, would live forever; yet the idea is often very nearly approached. Im- mortality is the free gift of divine grace to man. And here, in order to complete our ariew of the ancient Indian ideas of a moral government, we tnust take into account their belief respecting a future state. According to the most ancient custom, the lifeless bod;y is either given to the fire to consurtle, or committed to the motherly keepilag of Earth, who is invoked to receive him graciously, to wrap him up as a mother wraps her child in her garment, to lie lightly upon him. Her bosom, however, is not the last resting place of the departed: he is himself addressed: " Go forth, go forth, on the ancient paths which our fathers in old tirnes have trod; the two rulers in blissful content, Yairla, and god Varuna, shcalt thou behold." The latter of these two heavenly ones whose sight is promised to the deceased, we alreacly know; the other, Yama, is the proper chief of departed spirits. In him we find the fine combination of ideas, that the first man, the originator of the race here oll earth, is also the beginner and head of huinan- ity renewed in another wor]d. He is therefore termed the Assembler of men. The first born of them that slept is become the prince of all the new awakened; as is expressly</page><page sequence="14">343 said in a certain h;ymn: "Yama hath first found us a place, a home which is not to be taken from us: whither our fathers of old departed, thither goeth also the way of their posterity." The body which the deceased is to wear in his other ex- istence, cannot be the same one which the flames have con sumed, or the earth covered up: it may not even be one like it, for he is to dwell henceforth in the company of divine spirits, and must be clothed like these to be able to claim a right among them. And the ancient Indian religion, in entire harmony with its conception of the highest gods, and in the feeling of atl affinity between the human and the divine spirit, here plainly declares that the deceased, laying off all imperfections, 1S endowed by the divine lland with a shining spilitual body. Its nature is denoted by the same word used to express the essence of the highest divinities above spoken of; a word that unites in itself the ideas of lifefull and spiritual. The place where these glorified ones are to live, is heaven. In order to show that not merelv an outer court of the divine dwellings is set apart for them, the highest heaven, the midst or innermost part of lleaven, is expressly spoken of as their seat. This is their place of rest; and its divine splendor is not disfigured by anxr specification of particular beauties or enjoyments, such as those with which other re ligions have been wont to adorn the mansions of the blest. There they live immortal, with Yama their chief, and the Fathers who have preceded them thither. There they are happy: the language used to describe their condition is the same with which is denoted the most exalted felicity. A hymn paints this condition in the following words: Where glory never-fading is where is the world of heavenly light The world of immortality the everlastingF-set me thele ! Where Yama reigns, Vivasvat's sotl where is the inmost sphere of heaven Where those abounding waters flolv-O make me but immortal tllere ! Where there is freedom unrestrained-there in the triple vault of lleaven Where worlds of brightest glory are---O make me but immortal there ! Where pleasures and enjoyments are-where raptures and abiding bliss, Where all desires are satisfie(l--O make me but immortal there ! To the question which the theologian, or rather the mys- tlC, ever longs to solve, and longs in vain, since it lies be- yon(l the reach of his conceptions; the questioll respecting which our own sacred writingS maintain silence: what,</page><page sequence="15">344 namely, shall be the employment of the blest, in what sphere their activity shall expend itself-to this question ancient Hindu svisdom sought no answer. The certainty of happiness was enough for it. An einployment, indeed, it has found for them, but it is one which, so to speak, lies this side of their felicitv. As the gods come to men's sacrifices to receive their prayers, praise, and ofEerings, so also come with them the departed- the Fathers, as they are customarily called in the form of invisible spirits, who float about those who still remain behind on eartla, and bless alld protect them; for in their glorified condition they have received divine powers. One important defect seems to exhibit itself here: that distinct conceptions are wanting as to the relation in which the morally depraved stand to this condition of happiness, and to the other world in general. Not that I regard it as a fault that no state of eternal misery is set of against this felicitsy, or deem a series of gradations of happiness a valu- able addition to a system of doctrine: such attempts at in- dis-idualization are rather, wherever they occur, pious fan- cies; still, it reanains a defect, that no definite information is given as to what filture awaits those who die in their iniquity, who have not believed in the gods, but rather arrayed thetnselves ill hostility against them and their wor- shippers. A doctrine which on other points is so clear, could not possibly make the despisers of the gods partakers of their happiness. They would either have to be, by some miracu- lous agency, changed from bad to good, or that happiness would cease to be such. And the heavenly world is con- stantly entitled the world of the well-doing, of the pious. The reprobate, then, are assumed to be excluded from it. But what future is assigned to them ? Two possibilities here present themselves: the one, that after the death of the body the evil still live on for an in- definite time their evil life, in contrast to that of the blest in heaven; the other, that their individualit) is extinguished by death. I did for a time regard tlle former of these two suppo- sitions as the only admissible one, believing that the de- parted souls of tlle wicked were converted into spirits of darkness, after the same manner as in the conceptiolls of the</page><page sequence="16">345 Shamans. This would assume that they joined tlle hosts of demons, who under the name of Rakshas and the like terrify men in the dark, and seek to disturb the service of the gods and the performance of good works, and against whose attacks the pious invoke the aid of the gods of light. Tllus they would in another form still continue their former mode of action. I was led to regard this solution of the questioll as the only possible one, chiefly by the consideration that the SUppOSitiOll of a continued existellce of the good, and total extinction of the evil, would imply a differellce in the principle of life which animated each, while yet both pos- sess the same human llature. Tet, at present, this reason seerns to me rather correct in point of philosophy than accordant with the spirit of remote antiquity. In ancient times, the identity of humall nature in all individuals of the race was not thought of: so much as that appears even in the distilletion already mentioned as drawn by every cultivated nation between itself and the barbarians. The recognition of this identitv makes its ear^ liest appearance ill Eebrew prophecy, shows itself later in Buddhism, and becomes complete in Christianity. We ought not therefore to be surprised, if we do not find this exalted thought among the ancient Indians, twelve or fifteen centuries before Christ. Passages in the sacred writings, moreover, speak in favor of the second supposition, of the annihilation of the wiclied at death. We read there that Varuna, the supreme judge of the actions of men here and of their fate llereafter, thrusts those who displease him down into the depth. As their bocly illtO the grave, so they themsel+res sink into a dark abyss; and with that7 doubtless, tlleir being is at an end. Herewith accords, too, tlle already mentioned doctrille that immortality is a free gift from heaven. Whoever fails to receive it, ends his existence when lis body dies. Of a hell this religion knows nothing, although the later Indians have imagined for themselves hell and its horrors, after the same manner as otller nations. These conceptions form the basis of the ancient Indian religion. The whole varied world of traditions and myths which has come down to us, is, in comparisoll with these? something merely superficial, an animation of Wature and her powers, images from the ceremonies of worship, and 4 VOL.

It is a serious error to believe that the mythology of a Nature-religion exhausts its whole religious contents. The images and traditions are indeed what strike the mind most strongly, form the theme of poets and historians, are pictured by art, and symbolized in the ceremonies of the altar and the temple; ;yet along with them, and behind them, still deeper thoughts stir the heart of the illdividual and of the nation. To discern and represent these is seldom attempted, and is no easy task. But it is c)ne that repays the eSort, for here, at all periods and among all nations, is brought to light what is purely human, and what we are better able to estimate than the pictorial language of myths, which is con- ditioned by such various circumstances of tiine and place. Such a centre of general religious thought and feeling is presented in the ancient Indian doctrine of the relation of the pious to the gods, of which the chief features are above presented. The same conception forms also the ground-work of the Iranian religion, the record of which has come down to us in the Zendavesta, and may- in a less developed form, indeed have been common to all the tribes of the great Indo-European family, until partially obliterated by distant elnigrationX intercourse with other nations, and changes in manners and habits of life. No one will hesitate to allow to these conceptions a posi- tive moral value, and to esteem a literature in which such ideas are expressed. But the Indian nation has not abode by them. It has, indeed, carefully treasured up, and at a11 times regarded as sacred, the productions of its earliest pe- riod; but it has attached the main importance to a worthless supplement, and lost frozn sight and from knowledge the truly valuable portion. Only once in the whole long course of its later history has it enjoyed a period worthy of being compared with that primitive one: during the first ages, namely, of Buddhism. Those, then, who are called to labor in the wide field of Indiall missions may confidently hold up before the people its own antiquity as a model: not in order that it progress no farther than that; but that it may see how its ancestors, in their simplicity, were nearer the purity of truth than their descendants, in their self-satisfied arrogance; and how the former cherished none of those</page><page sequence="18">347 follies and errors in which they themselares are apparently hoping to find their salvation for rlow and hereafter. The student of antiquity, faXher, experiences a peculiar satisfaction in the investigation of this era, for the very reason that the moral value of the subject of his studies is not a matter of indifference to him. The charm of primiw tiveness which surroundLs these ancient hymns in a yet higher degree than the immortal poems of H:omer, is united with a nobility of diction, a pure and fresh earnestness of thought, which are no longer to be met with in the later literary productions of India. Ee finds the high spiritual endowinents which belong of right to the Indo-European family of nations, and which have placed it foremost in the world's hostory, still fresh and vigorous in the most eastern branch of that familyy and not yet disfigured by the mani- fold exerescences of peculiar views and custorns, which :have so deformed the later Indian people, that, were it not for their language, the European would scarcely recognize them for his own hndred.</page></plain_text>
