<plain_text><page sequence="1">A LOGOS CREATOR AT CHARTRES AND ITS COPY By Jan van der Meulen PRESENTED TO KARL HERMANN USENER 19.8.65. Tt is generally accepted that the stained glass of Chartres cathedral conveys a true impression of the original appearance of medieval cathedral interiors.1 There is, however, reason to believe that many of the windows in the clerestory zone, particularly in the transepts, are post-medieval. Apart from the evidence of Roger de Gaignikres,2 there is much original source material which must be examined or re-examined from this point of view.3 Because the nature and extent of Gothic retrospective eclecticism at the end of the medieval period still remains to be thoroughly investigated-that is to say, to what extent the late Gothic period reverted to twelfth and thirteenth-century forms, and whether early Gothic art was also imitated during the early Renaissance in France-it may be difficult to accept the fact that certain windows which have obviously been copied from others were, in fact, executed several centuries later than their originals. Until we develop satisfactory criteria it may, on the evidence of stylistic differences alone, not be accepted by all scholars that the inferior quality of the copies-on which all are agreed-is indeed due to the approach of a later period and not merely to the differing orientation and quality of the various contemporary artists. A detailed study of the iconography can, however, provide additional criteria. If the copy, close as it may keep to the style and outer form, fails to interpret the iconographic content of the original, then we may be reasonably 1 The known restorations and the trans- position of various panes or whole windows are catalogued by Yves Delaporte, Les Vitraux de la Cathddrale de Chartres, Chartres, 1926, (photographs by IEtienne Houvet). The integrity of the clerestory glass apart from these published restorations is accepted by recent authors: Marcel Aubert and others, Le vitrail Franpais, Paris, 1958, (particularly Jean Verrier, pp. 83f.); Paul Frankl, 'The Chronology of the Stained Glass in Chartres Cathedral', Art Bulletin, xlv, 1963, pp. 30 1-22, where further bibliographical references will be found. 2 OSeph Guibert, Les dessins d'Archiologie de Roger de Gaignidres, Serie ii, Vitraux, Paris, n.d. On plates nos. 44 to 47, Guibert re- produces Gaignibres' 'Disposition des Vitres . selon lordre quelles sont placez' of the choir and transept clerestory drawn in 1696 and apparently traced at some later date from the originals in Oxford (cf. pl. 47). In many cases the discrepancies between certain of the existing windows and Gaignibres' drawings have not been taken into consideration by recent scholars. The accuracy of Gaigni~res' rendering can be judged by a comparison of the remaining forty plates (nos. 48-85 and nos. 14 and 15, the latter wrongly titled Beaumont-sur-Oise) with many existing win- dows. The rosette windows under considera- tion, however, correspond to GaigniRres' rendering. Pintard's unpublished descrip- tions of individual windows, and other manu- scripts dating from the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries are cited by Delaporte, op. cit., pp. 38ff. * Maurice Jusselin's 'Les Peintres verriers &amp; Chartres au XVIe sikcle', Memoires de la Socigtd Arche'ologique d'Eure-et-Loir, xvi, 1923- 1936, pp. 153-254, can be taken as a point of departure, but (in spite of the loss of many documents through the bombing of the municipal library in May 1944) the indices of the Departmental Archives show the amount of unpublished material which must still be worked through before finality can be reached on this question. 82</page><page sequence="2">A LOGOS-CREATOR AT CHARTRES 83 certain that it was executed in a period which no longer understood the theological motivation of the original.4 Two clerestory rosette windows on the east side of the northern transept provide a good starting-point for the study of this question in Chartres cathedral. They are no. I38,6 in the bay next to the crossing (Pls. 31a, 32a, 31c) and its copy, no. 144,6 in the next bay but one, i.e. adjacent to the north facade (Pls. 3'b, 32b, 3I d). In both windows Christ enthroned is depicted as the Logos of the creation. The Rosette Window No. 138 We are concerned here with a typical Chartres rosette window, in which an axially eight-lobed central rosette is bordered by alternating large and small quatrefoils in the interstices and on the axes respectively. These quatre- foils are glazed with stylized plant motifs and the arms of the donor of the subjacent lancet windows. The armature divides the main round window orthogonally into nine rectangular fields and frames the circumference, con- necting the concavely blunted cusps. The central medallion is edged with a narrow red band of shorter radius, which thus leaves a relatively broad decorative border containing a tendril motif. The lobes of the main window contain radially stylized plant motifs in a simple red border. The window was last restored in 1920 and shows several incongruities which must be ascribed to its only partially good state of preservation.7 The major forms and the iconographic content do not, however, appear to have been seriously affected. The central theme faces us in hieratic symmetry, filling the entire area * The earliest published report on the windows is given by S6bastian Roulliard, Parthgnie, ou Histoire de la tris-auguste et tris- ddvote dglise de Chartres, Paris, 1609. This work, described by Delaporte (op. cit., pp. 35ff.) as being of 'une e'rudition assez vaste et un souci rdel d'exactitude', interprets for instance the icono- graphy of window no. 38, the history of Charlemagne, as being the history of the holy raiment of Our Lady (Parthenie, i, p. 188v), and believes that the depiction of a certain Gaufridus, window no. 121, represents a pre- Christian nobleman of this name. Successive authors of the l7th century-Sablon, Souchet, Challine-show no more understanding of the iconographic content. To quote Male, L'art religieux du XIIIe sicle, Paris, 1923, p. I : 'Des la seconde moiti6 du XVIe sibcle, l'art du moyen Age devint une 6nigme'. 6 Delaporte's numbering is used (see above, n. I). In Kunze's system of co-ordinates used in the author's monograph on Chartres now in preparation for the Soci6t6 Archfologique d'Eure-et-Loir, this window will be NIe. Kunze's system has been perfected by Richard Hamann-MacLean in 'System einer topo- graphischen Orientierung . ..', Marburger Universit'tsbund Jahrbuch, 4, 1965. 6 NIlle (see above, n. 5). 7 In sections of the border the yellow tendril with alternating green and amber leaves appears to have been deformed or re- placed by white glass. It is, however, not possible to say for certain which is the original condition. The same applies to the stained glass of the lobes. The left and bottom lobes (and parts of two more) are composed of far darker glass than the others. At first glance, this seems to indicate that they are older, the glass having become opaque through oxidiza- tion, but the replacement of the base (or 'root') foliage by abstract geometric forms speaks against this-and, furthermore, the bottom lobe obviously contains later violet glass. There are large undamaged areas of light translucent blue-also in the main central medallion. Either these or the darker panes must be later than the thirteenth century. The solution to the problem must probably be sought in successive restorations in the course of the centuries, some retaining the forms of the original, others 'improving' them.

Against a blue background, the lightly bearded, long-haired Logos is seated on a rectangular, green-cushioned seat or bench8 of amber-coloured marble, his bare feet9 resting on a yellow arc, the subdued primordial chaos.10 He has a red-bordered cross-halo, the golden bars of which are studded with jewels or relief work in the thirteenth-century manner. In front of him floats a half-open book.1 His hands are raised symmetrically, the right hand in the gesture of benediction,12 the left holding the globe, which is divided into the zones of heaven, the dry land, and the sea. Particularly interesting is the little castle on the earth, representing the inhabited world, or Mankind. (The Logos is clothed in a white garment, which falls in light Muldenfalten from a blue hem at the neck-line down to his feet, loose generous folds falling back from the exposed close-fitting red right sleeve. A golden- edged red cloak is draped over his shoulders and covers the left arm and hand; here, and where it hangs down from behind his right shoulder to his left knee, the blue lining is visible, making its appearance again as a broad outer border in front of his shins.) On the blue background on his right, the sun is depicted as a whirl of deep red flame, and on his left, the crescent moon, carefully extended to its full disc by a hatched surface which is again subdivided by a secondary crescent field. The importance laid on this cleverly concentrated representation of the phases of the moon is echoed in the differentiated depic- tion of the stars which are scattered over the whole area of the blue back- ground. While the rest of the stars are yellow or white, the six or seven stars around the sun are deep red, apparently a reference to the planets.13 The Iconographic Problem Essential elements of this composition differentiate it from contemporary monumental portrayals of Christ enthroned, a sphere of iconography domi- nated at this time by the majestas domini. Not a single element of apocalypse 8 The word 'throne' is avoided because there are neither back nor arm-rests. The stained glass of the lower left field of the seat shows signs of serious damage and careless restoration. It has been badly shattered and re-leaded, the whole of the right-hand portion having been replaced with modern light- violet glass, and the green quatrefoil jewel, which studs the right front panel, having been patched together from many small pieces. The front of the seat is surmounted by a heavy cornice formed of two white beads separated by a broad blue throating which shows the remains of a kymation, or egg-and- beak decoration on one or two fragments. The amber marble of the front is used again for the top surface, which appears in rec- tangular areas on either side of the cushion. * The Logos's left foot, seen foreshortened from below, must date from a later restora- tion. 10 This arc must not be confused with the rainbow in the apocalyptic visions of Ezekiel (Ezek. i, 28) or St. John (Rev. iv, 3). The complicated iconology of this motif is given a separate chapter in a forthcoming study. 1x 'Floats' because, although the book is intersected by the Logos's left knee, the lining of his cloak can be seen under the lower edge of the book, which is, therefore, not intended to be resting on the thigh. The intended super-naturality and 'levitation' of the book is accentuated by its being carefully depicted half-open with an amber outer cover, golden pages, and, above these, the green inner side of the upper cover. If it were depicted naturally in this attitude it would lie closed. 12 The right hand has three instead of two raised fingers, apparently an optical adjust- ment on the part of the artist and not due to a restoration. The hand is contained in one pane and there is no reason to doubt its perfect preservation. 13 What could be the seventh planet is, in fact, a decorative knob or tassel on the corner of the cushion; it has a partner on the front</page><page sequence="4">A LOGOS-CREATOR AT CHARTRES 85 vocabulary appears. Even the sun and moon are clearly the physical products of creation and not allegorical accessories, and the open book is not supported by the Logos's hand, but floats independently in front of him. The globe, or disc of the world, which he holds instead of the book, contains an unparalleled representation of the inhabited world. Pintard and de Lasteyrie saw in this rosette 'the creation of the world'; Delaporte suggests a narrower definition, the labour of the fourth day, or more precisely the creation of the stars.14 We shall see, however, that this interpretation as a specific act of the Hexameron is too narrow. We are here not concerned with a momentary scene from the story of the creation, but with the monumental expression of the creation as such, the Christian conception of the cosmos simply and absolutely, the incarnate Word of God portrayed as creator and providence at the same time. That this conception may be difficult to extricate from the overpowering 'actuality' of the majestas domini as representative of the Pantocrator in Western art is due only to the fact that the iconography of the pre-existent Logos of the creation has received almost no systematic study in the past. Neither its typological content, nor the origins of the individual elements have been given due consideration. A survey of all the relative aspects-if not their final solution-must be reserved for a separate study (shortly to appear), but significant insights can already be gained from the stained glass of the cathedral of Chartres and, more specifically, from its relationship to the philosophy of the local cathedral school under its twelfth-century chancellor Thierry and his pupil Clarenbaldus, both authors of commentaries on the creation. As Katzenellenbogen has convincingly shown, the historical and ideological situation of the cathedral school of Chartres itself is decisive for many questions concerning the iconography of the cathedral.15 In the above description it has been necessary to anticipate the intention of certain elements of the composition without detailed explanation, for instance the arc of chaos and the book. To simplify understanding of the problems involved, it is also advisable to introduce the major features of the exegetic and patristic background of the portrayal of the deity himself. It suffices here to point out that: I. The Logos, with cross-nimbus, is the active creator. He is, firstly, the Word of God (John i, 1-3: 'In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God . . . All things were made by him...') and, equally, the Wisdom of God (Prov. viii, 22-31: 'The Lord possessed [Wisdom] in the beginning.., before ever the earth was.., when he appointed the foundations of the earth . . . [Wisdom rejoiced] in the habitable part of his earth'). 2. As such, through creation and Incarnation, the Logos is also the corner and a corresponding arrangement on the right side of the cushion. (Whether this has some deeper significance or is due to restoration, is difficult to say. The left side of the cushion has-together with the lower left field of the seat already described-been very severely damaged and carelessly restored. The adjacent knee of the Logos has also been repaired in opaque glass.) Cf. Ellen Beer, Die Rose der Kathedrale von Lausanne, Berne, 1952, p. 29, for a survey of the iconographic tradition of this motif. 14 Delaporte, (above, n. i), p. 490. 15 Adolf Katzenellenbogen, The sculptural Programs of Chartres Cathedral, Baltimore, 1959.</page><page sequence="5">86 JAN VAN DER MEULEN manifestation of God, whose portrayal is excluded by the Old Testament,16 (John i, 10-18: 'He was in the world and the world was made by him... And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us. . . and we beheld his glory... No Man hath seen God... the Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him.' Also in Hebrews i, 2-3: 'God hath spoken unto us by his Son,.. . by whom also he made the worlds; Who being the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person' . ..). 3. The Christ-Logos as theophany can, however, only manifest the Trinity, because this is indivisible. The portrayal is of the Logos, but in the power of the Trinity. The fourth Lateran council, 1215, had stipulated that the divine personages are inseparable in being and action; they form a single principle of action towards the world.17 If the anthropomorphic deity portrayed is the Trinity, is his being dif- ferentiated by immediate symbols? The throne can be generally accepted as the symbol of sovereignty of the Father (Ps. x, 5 (xi, 4): 'the Lord's throne is in heaven'). The book, usually described as the apocalyptic 'book of life', or as the Gospel, has no place in the tradition of the iconography of creation; the question whether it must not be seen as a symbol of the Word of God or the Wisdom of God appears to be more than justified-at least in the present context. (In no other depiction of this motif does the book appear to float, to have an independent existence with God: John i, i: 'the Word was with God'). The spiritus dei remains the most elusive of these, the history of art being at a loss as soon as the usual dove is lacking; and yet we will see that the Spirit of God ('upon the face of the waters', Gen. i, 2) is an intrinsic and fundamental component of the creation. Is not the gesture of benediction a reference to the Spirit emanating from Father and Son? 4. Finally, the creation being the tangible expression of God, time and the seasons commence with it, and mankind can perceive God and his providence through this. Providence is an integral constituent of the creation, because God's labour did not cease on the seventh day; the creation of new matter ceased on the seventh day, but not God's care of his creation. The Logos has been interpreted as a basis for the doctrine of providence since antiquity.18 The iconography of the creation as such can thus only be distinguished from the representation of the extant cosmos in those cases where it is illus- trated in the narrative succession of the Hexameron, which is neither the case here nor in the majority of unified monumental depictions. The lack of specific chronological references automatically leads to a predominance of the providential aspect (Ps. xxxii (xxxiii), 6-14: 'By the Word of the Lord were the heavens made. . . . He gathereth the waters of the sea together. . . . From the place of his habitation he looketh upon all the inhabitants of the earth.'). The New Testament allows two relevant interpretations of the Cosmos: first, the Cosmos as the universe, i.e. as the sum of things created by God- 16 Exodus xxxiii, 20: 'Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no man see me and live'. Also Exodus xx, 4: 'Thou shalt not make . . . any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath'. 17 M. Schmaus, 'Appropriation', Lexikon fiur Theologie und Kirche, 1957, col. 773. 18 M. M. Marcia, 'The Logos as a Basis for a Doctrine of Divine Providence', Mediaeval Studies, v, Toronto, 1943, pp. 75- I0I.</page><page sequence="6">A LOGOS-CREATOR AT CHARTRES 87 for which the word ,iv- is also used-and, second, because within the visible cosmos the earth is the most tangible element, the earth and its inhabitants, mankind-for which the words otxou-vv is occasionally used.19 This unity of mankind with the universe can scarcely be asserted more strongly than by the audacious little castle in the midst of the great work of creation,20 held as a globe in the hand of the godhead who rules with light and darkness21 above the arched rim of a subdued chaos at his feet. The fingers of the right hand of the Logos are curved sharply inwards, as if blessing the world held in the left hand. Although the form as such is a manifestation of contemporary style, the iconographic relationship to be discussed below may well justify the postulation of a certain intentional motivation in the case in point. To sum up, the underlying exegesis is that God, the One, the eternal deity, in order to have created, must have wished to create and then known (planned) what he would create-Wisdom; then, in order to realize his wish to create, he had to express it, 'and God said, let there be . . .'-the Word. Finally, however, and this remained and remains the most elusive aspect, as the deity had no compulsion to create, his desire to create at all must have sprung from love-the Spirit (see below). Mankind, in its participation in creation (i.e. the created world) participates in God-Providence. The ramifications of theological exegesis relative to the form of representa- tion of the theme in each epoch will ultimately have to be investigated. (More often than not there is less variation than the authors lead one to believe. Their own philosophy is largely a selective synthesis of various un- named predecessors from Pythagoras, Plato and Aristotle through the Fathers of the Church up to their own contemporaries.) The introduction of Thierry of Chartres and Clarenbaldus of Arras into this study is therefore only intended to indicate a clear assertion of the cosmogonic theories current at Chartres within the hundred years which saw the construction of the Gothic cathedral so as to elucidate certain aspects of the iconography. It forms a pen- ultimate pole of medieval creation exegesis prior to the public teaching of Aristotle's Metaphysics and natural science in 1240, and throws light on much of the previous development since the famous Hexameron of St. Ambrose. In the course of the thirteenth century the school of Chartres was to lose its importance to the growing universities and its precepts were to be forced on to the defensive. Window no. 138 reflects a vigorous iconographic assertion 19 Cf. K. Pieper, 'Welt', Lexikonfiir Theologie und Kirche, x, 1938, col. 8i Iff. This is based particularly on texts of SS. John and Paul. 2o Following Luther's translation of the Bible, one may be tempted to interpret the castle as the 'fortress', the jirmamentum of the second day of the creation, Genesis i, 6: 'Und Gott sprach: es werde eine Feste inmitten der Wasser, und sic scheide die Wasser vonein- ander! und es geschah also. . . 7 Gott machte die Feste und schied die Wasser unter der Feste von den Wassern fiber der Feste. 8 Und Gott nannte die Feste Himmel'. The intention of the Genesis text, a con- solidation of the upper waters so as to allow an atmospheric volume between, has nothing to do with defensive fortification, as trans- lated by Luther. This literary confusion of origins has been taken up by German art and literature as Himmelsburg. 21 The stress laid on the planets and phases of the moon also reflects scholastic astrology, according to which the free will of mankind was dependent on the divine pre-ordination of the universe, an antique tradition which is evidenced in the sculptural zodiac cycles on French fagades since the twelfth century.</page><page sequence="7">88 JAN VAN DER MEULEN of the interpretation of the creation and the creator of the world according to Thierry and his pupil Clarenbaldus. The following survey, based on Hairing's publication of their precepts,22 is an extract of those elements of their teaching which can be recognized in the iconography of window no. I38. (The relationship is pointed out in brackets.) Thierry of Chartres Thierry professes to explain the Hexameron according to physical science. It is important to recognize these strict scientific aims at the school of Chartres -expressed so clearly in the personification of the seven liberal arts on the portail royal-because there is a tendency to confuse the advent of new Aristotelian writings in the thirteenth century with the advent of 'scientific' scholarship as such and, consequently, the appearance of 'profane' elements in the iconography of the cathedrals. Thierry first specifies the four causes of the world: (a) God, its efficient cause; (b) God's wisdom, its 'formal' cause; (c) God's kindness, its final cause; (d) the four elements, its material cause. He explains himself thus: (a) since all things in the world are changeable and perishable, they must have an originator (God the Father, who created matter); (b) since they are arranged with intelligence and in the most beautiful order, they must have been created with wisdom (God the son, who informed and ordered matter); (c) because their maker does not stand in need of any- thing, being self-sufficient, he must have created out of kindness and love (the Holy Spirit, who loves and governs created matter-the providential aspect); (d) the material cause is tangible, it can be observed (Thierry will expand on this). Moses names these causes in Genesis: (a) the efficient cause, 'God'; (b) the formal cause, in the words 'God said', because the word 'say' used by God means the predisposing of the shape and form of future things in his Wisdom; (c) the final cause in 'God saw all the things that he had made and they were very good', which signifies God's kindness and pleasure in what he created; (d) the material cause, 'heaven and earth'. For clearness of presentation we wish to point out that the first three, a, b and c, may be grouped as the spiritual causes-the Trinity-as against d, the material cause. Because Thierry attempts to use human reason for his cosmogony, he commences with d, the tangible material causes, and reverts later to an explanation of the Trinity. (At this juncture, therefore, only a brief reference to the depiction of the Trinity can be made: the anthropo- morphic godhead is both Father and Son in the theophanic portrayal of the Logos with cross-halo. He is Father in the traditional imperial symbol of the throne, Son and wisdom in the symbol of the book. Is the Holy Spirit re- presented by the gesture of benediction-a motif sometimes represented independently as the 'Hand of God' in representations of God acting through the Spirit-in the present case perhaps confirmed in its relationship to the inhabited globe, held in that providential kindness which is expressed each 22 N.

The anthropomorphic representation of the Godhead is the Trinity: Three in One. Thierry's theory of the material creation of the universe, which follows, may appear primitive. But, as Haring points out, he offers all that the physicists and astronomers of his time had to offer, assuming as they did that the entire universe consists of four elements, fire, air, water and earth. (It is this aspect which is depicted in so much detail in window no. 138, the care- fully depicted flames of the sun and the zones of air, earth and water on the globe held in the creator's left hand. For the Platonists of Chartres, St. Augustine had already confirmed a like separation of fire from the other elements: 'when writing on the formation of the world, Plato says that God first united earth and fire; from which it is evident that he assigns to fire a place in heaven. This opinion bears a certain resemblance to the statement, "In the beginning God made heaven and earth" '.23) In the first moment of time, God created matter. Because heaven is of supreme lightness, it began to move in a circular movement from the very first moment; the first complete rotation has been called the first day. During that first rotation the higher element, fire (the sun), illuminated the next lower element, the air, and warmed the third element, the water, and in so doing, suspended the water in vaporous form above the air. As a result, the air was located between the water below and the suspended vapours, as Moses said: he placed the firmament amidst the waters. (A closer look at the globe shows that the upper zone of the globe is bordered on the upper circum- ference by a double line, a firmament against the suspended vapours of heaven, the unique blue background. In contemporary and later manuscript representations of the deity the background, of course, was golden or silver, symbolic colours. Here the blue symbolizes the vaporous volume of a physical heaven.) The third rotation subjected the air between the vapours and the waters to a greater heat, which vaporized the water, the resultant contraction of which brought about the appearance of land and islands (the zone of earth). Through the resulting warmth and moisture, the earth conceived the power to produce plants and trees and, likewise, the heat produced the stars from that huge mass of water vapour, the heavens, on the fourth day. Stellar bodies must have water as their substance, as only water can rise above the earth through heat. (The stellar bodies are shown embedded in the blue vapours of the background.) The increased heat due to the movement of these solid bodies then first acted on the watery elements, from which the fish and fowl were created on the fifth day. Lastly, the life-giving heat reached the earth, and animals were created; of these Man was made in the image and likeness of God (the castle, symbolic of the inhabited world, of man as the highest form of life). Creation subsequent to the sixth day is by way of seminal causes: fire remains the active and efficient cause, earth the passive and material cause, air and water the uniting agents of the seminal causes which were implanted in the elements and from which come both the orderly succession of time and seasons (the sun and the phases of the moon) and the production of corporeal creatures. 23 Harry Bober, 'In Principio. Creation before Time', De Artibus Opuscula xl: Essays in Honor of Erwin Panofsky, i, New York, I961, p. 17, quoting from The City of God, viii, ii. 7</page><page sequence="11">90 JAN VAN DER MEULEN According to Thierry, the accepted literal exposition of Genesis was as follows: 'In the beginning God created heaven and earth' means that God created nothing before and that he created both simultaneously. Thierry draws on the physicists to show that 'earth' means all solid bodies, 'heaven' the light and invisible elements. In 'the earth was void and empty', 'void' means without form, 'empty' means without plants and animals. 'And dark- ness was upon the face of the deep' expresses the second element, water, whereas the third element, air, the spiritual quality of which somehow approaches divine refinement, can be recognized in 'and the spirit of the Lord (moved over the waters)'.24 Thierry's personal modification of this traditional interpretation is ex- plained as follows. In 'the earth was void and empty', 'earth' designated the formlessness of the two elements earth and water, the 'voidness' of which is to be seen in that they were still so mixed that they could hardly be distinguished. 'And darkness was upon the face of the deep' designated the formlessness of the two elements air and fire: air is informed by light (made tangible?), its formlessness is called 'darkness', the 'darkness' of the air approached the 'slowness' of water, in the sense of the density of fog. The primeval quality of fire is reflected, according to Thierry, in 'darkness': fire was without move- ment to 'break its density' which indeed was close to the density of the air. This formlessness, this quasi-uniformity of the elements, is the 'chaos' of the ancient philosophers. Moses calls the same confusion 'heaven and earth' which, owing to their formlessness, were almost completely alike. Now Plato, says Thierry, taught that 'matter', or the 'confusion of elements' lies underneath the four elements-just as confusion precedes definition or just as sound precedes the word (which confirms the interpretation of the arc of chaos at the feet of the creator). The power of the maker, who is to give form and order to matter is, of course, expressed in 'the Spirit of the Lord' (and illustrated as such, enthroned over the chaos in the order of his creation), which David calls the 'word of the Lord'.25 This leads to Thierry's speculation on God and the Trinity and his explanation of why Moses mentions the Spirit before mentioning the Word. Thierry's presentation of the Trinity is prefaced by an acknowledgement of the quadrivium. (We have mentioned the possible symbolism of the book as the Wisdom of God, also, however, the expression of this wisdom on earth in the seven liberal arts, first acclaimed monumentally on the portail royal. The possibility that the school of Chartres felt its own philosophy to be a constituent of God's order in creation will be referred to in our forthcoming study.) All otherness-alteritas-is preceded by oneness-unitas-the One precedes all mutability (it must exist before it can be changed). Every creature is subject to mutability and whatever exists is either eternal or created. Since 24 According to Eusebius, the introductory verse of Genesis must be interpreted as the creation of the four elements. Gregory of Nyssa, Johannes Chrysostomos, Cosmos In- dicopleustes and Augustine all see in 'heaven and earth' the expression of a polar concept of matter, i.e. of all being. The following acts of the Hexameron indicate its formative transformation. Cf. Ilona Opelt, 'Erde', Reallexikon far Antike und Christentum, v, col. II71. 25 Psalm xxxii (xxxiii), 6, quoted above.</page><page sequence="12">A LOGOS-CREATOR AT CHARTRES 91 the One precedes every creature, he must be eternal, i.e. the divinity, which, again, is the cause of existence forma essendi of all things. Just as a thing is bright or warm by virtue of light or heat, so all things derive their existence from the divinity. (The anthropomorphic depiction of the three in one has been described above, pp. 85f. The inhabited world in the hand of God, in fact, its tangential proximity to the cross-halo, would be a convincing represen- tation of this derivation of the world's existence, its participation in the One. The motivation of this significant proximity will become evident in com- parison with the altered proportions of the copy in window no. 144.) As long as a thing partakes of the One, it persists or continues in its existence. As soon as it is divided, it perishes. For the One is the very conservation and form of existence; division is the cause of destruction. The derivation of the equal One is preceded by the observation that weight and measure, place and shape, time and movement, quantity, quality and relation, all derive their existence from numbers. (Thierry was obviously strongly influenced by neo-Pythagoreanism.) The One cannot be defined in this way; he must be eternal duration, excellence. Every number is created from the One, who is therefore omnipotent. The creation of numbers is the creation of things. Now numbers generated out of themselves produce squares (2 x 2 =-4). Multiplied by other numbers they produce unequal figures (2 x 3 6 or, geometrically, rectangles). The first type with equal proportions stays within the same nature, the second type produces things of a different nature. However, it remains true that all numbers, other than one, when multiplied by themselves, produce multiplicands not equal to them- selves, whereas one multiplied by other numbers can produce all numbers, but multiplied by itself, can only produce its equal (I x i - I). The substance, therefore, of the Begetter-gignens-and the Begotten-genitus-is one and the same. Since equality precedes inequality, the generation of equality must come first. We understand this to mean that there must be another one before there can be two to make three. But Thierry proceeds with a further explana- tion: the One, if multiplied by that which precedes all other numbers, must needs beget an Equal One. Consequently, again, the One cannot but beget an Equal One out of himself and his own substance. Also, because the Equal One precedes every number it must be eternal. And because there cannot be two or more eternal beings, the One and the Equal One are One. (It is thus clear why the Godhead is depicted as one being, and equally apparent that an iconography of Father and Son as separate individuals was not possible in a Chartrain cosmology. The current converse iconography, the portrayal of the Trinity as three separate beings, is attested for at least as early as the last quarter of the tenth century and became increasingly popular towards the end of the Middle Ages. That the portrayal of a single anthropomorphic deity in fact represents the Trinity, does not appear to have been postulated in accepted studies on the subject: further confirmation by clearly inscribed antecedents will be given in our forthcoming study.26) But, Thierry proceeds, the 'divine philosophers' have adopted the word 'person' to designate both the One and the Equal One (the justification for the anthropomorphic represen- tation). 26 See the relevant chapter.</page><page sequence="13">92 JAN VAN DER MEULEN Since the One is the first and only cause or being-esse-of all things, and since the Equal One exists as the One equal to the One, it follows necessarily that the Equal One is the equal cause of the existence-existentia-of all things, more specifically their certain mode, their eternal limiting definition or boundary (we understand 'form') because he is the tetragon of the One or a mode in which the One operates. (We understand: 'one' can form no figure and requires an equal one to create the first form.) The One is thus the cause from which all things derive their existence, but their forms, mode and measure come from the One equal to the One. The Equal One is as it were the image-figura-of the One, and, furthermore, his brightness-splendor-because he enables us to distinguish all things from one another by their mode (read: character or measure). (From this we see why, also independent of dogma, the image of the Divinity is depicted as the second person. Although it may be generally recognized that the Logos is the creator, we have here, for the first time, the philosophical confirmation of the precepts of the Evangelist-according to Thierry's 'scientific' aims. This shows again how fruitful the consideration of contemporary philosophy can be for the confirmation of iconographic interpretation.27) The ancient philosophers used to call this 'mode', or the Equal One, the creator's Wisdom or Providence, and correctly so, because the mode of things (their forms and measures) is fixed by the first wisdom, their concepts- notiones-are formed in that wisdom. (We are here concerned not only with the interpretation of the second person, but also his relationship to the book as the symbol of wisdom.) Things derive their existence from the One, but their forms, modes and measures from the Equal One; one procreates all numbers, the Equal One produces the proportions and inequalities. The same Equal One is the truth of all things, the truth of a thing being its equal cause of existence. In explanation: if the mind grasps the truth of a thing, it does not stray from its limits; if it does stray, the result is falsehood, which is without reality, while truth is the first being and first reality of things. Or, more simply, whoever says what is true, always says what is in a thing. This being the equal cause of truth, it is quite manifest that the Equal One himself is the divine Word-which is nothing but the Creator's pre-definition-praefinitio- the defining essence, quality and quantity of all things, time and place. Beyond or below this pre-definition, there is no existence. The Word has been shown to be the One equal to the One. The One is the divinity and begets the One equal to the One. Hence the divinity is the Word. Unfortunately the third person was never analysed by Thierry, who re- marks only that he is the bond-connexio-between the other two. The sugges- tion that the Holy Spirit is represented by the act of benediction, must therefore rest solely on one additional criterion: in the hymn Veni Creator Spiritus, the Holy Spirit is called the finger of the right hand of God: Dexterae Dei tu digitus or Digitis paternae dexterae.28 27 Thierry was, of course, inspired to this description (i.e. to this 'research') by St. Paul, Hebrews i, 2-3 quoted above. 28J.

His personal contribution to Thierry's endeavour concerns chiefly the claim that the Word is the creator of all things and his precise definition of primordial matter. Finally, he ascribes to Christ the function of preserving the totality of God's creation-all aspects which only clarify or simplify the iconographic relationships analysed above (Logos, chaos, providence). The Son of God created the universe in its entirety: as principle he created its fundamental sources, as word its determinate shape. There are three fundamentals: (a) primordial matter (the formlessness of corporeal and incorporeal nature); (b) seminal causes (the hidden power implanted, from which one thing produces another); (c) the beginning of time (the first move- ment from formlessness to form, from non-being to being). The intellect can only imperfectly conceive the formlessness of primeval matter. The intellect follows form and determinate shape, not confusion. To grasp it, one must imagine the removal of forms-what is then left is nothing but 'being possible' or 'possibility'. When all forms are removed, the existence of things perishes, because all actuality, or being-esse-comes from form. Matter is thus not an actual thing, but rather 'absolute potency'-as the formless egg is potentially the bird. (The abstract nature of the arch of chaos at the feet of the creator in window no. I38 would appear to reflect Claren- baldus's 'defined potency' more than it does Thierry's formless material substances.) God created primeval matter; it is heresy to think of it as being co-eternal with God. It is mutable, or more precisely, mutability, and as such pre-supposes immutability, eternity, God. Although matter was created by God, it did not, in point of time, precede the formation of things, because matter and form, the components and the whole, were created together and simultaneously (and as such must have been present at the creation). The divine Wisdom which operated in pre-formed matter is called the Absolute Necessity, i.e. divine Providence. All things exist (a) by act and nature in defined potency; (b) in the divine Wisdom in undeveloped im- plicitness. St. John, 'an excellent theologian', is paraphrased: (John i, 3-4) 'All things were life in Him'. St. Augustine termed the Absolute Necessity 'the Word'; Pythagoras termed it 'number one, God'. The seminal causes are implanted in matter by God and must not be confused with its innate potency. The beginning of time is simultaneously the first movement of the seminal cause towards effecting its fulfilment. In so far as the Son of God is the word, he conceived the forms of all things and ordained the seminal causes to reach their fulfilment. Even now and until the end of the world he disposes the succession of time together with the Father and the Holy Spirit. This divine conception of forms has been called the creation in the Word. (A clear asser- tion of the unity of creation and providence.) God thus operates in four ways: (a) formaliter in the Word, conceiving the forms of things; (b) informiter in matter; (c) seminaliter in the seminal causes; (d) actualiter and reparative in the succession of time. The first three were concurrent, the last is eternally active. (We have gained a little from</page><page sequence="15">94 JAN VAN DER MEULEN Clarenbaldus for our interpretation of window no. I38: God, the creative Trinity, as actualiter and reparative in the succession of time-providence. Furthermore, at some risk of over-interpretation, we know that the informiter of matter can be looked upon as God the Father, while the formaliter is clearly expressed as God the Son; there is, however, nothing clearly intimated which seems to justify associating the Holy Spirit with the seminaliter.) The Subsequent Theological Situation After studying the school of Chartres and on entering 'the new Aristotelian world of the thirteenth century it [would look] as though we had left behind us a mental universe gone beyond recall'. It now seems possible to offer a purely philosophical explanation of nature.29 But this applies to the immediate sources of philosophy, not to their effect on the iconography of the conservative church, which, under the circumstances, represented the visual counter-assertion, the refutation of quasi-heretical precepts. The foundation of the University of Paris after 1200 had indeed resulted in a challenge from Arabic philosophy- the mediator of Aristotelian physics and natural science-to Christian theo- logy. For the time being though, up to about I240, the teaching of Aristotle's Metaphysics was still forbidden, as were the Amaurician pantheistic doctrines in which 'God was all things'. The teaching of Aristotle was authorized, however, not only in England, but also at Toulouse. Here too was centred the Manichean dualism of the Albigenses, the most dangerous heresy to threaten the unity of the church in the first third of the thirteenth century. Now we know that the bishop of Chartres took an active military part in the suppres- sion of the Albigenses and a future study will show that the neighbouring choir clerestory windows are probably a monumental donation to the memory of the local nobility participating in this religious war. Thierry of Chartres died before i i55, Clarenbaldus of Arras after i i7o. Window no. 138 may be dated in the second quarter of the thirteenth century. The window may thus appear to have been executed long after the texts discussed above. Seen against the above background, however, and with the knowledge that no important change had been wrought on the teaching at the school of Chartres in the meantime, window no. 138 can be seen as an assertion of the local doctrine at a period when the local theology was being threatened, both passively and actively, by new and dangerous theses. From the unique expression of medieval theology contained in this pro- gramme, we turn to its imitation in window no. 144. The Rosette Window No. n44 This window is so close a copy of no. 138, that an overall description is unnecessary. Only those factors will be listed which, due both to stylistic variation and lack of understanding of the iconography, date this window in the post-medieval period. In spite of all outward similarity, the icono- graphic content has become a travesty. The Logos of the creation has become the 'corrected' portrayal of a thirteenth-century figure seated on a bench in the midst of decorative symbols. 29 Etienne Gilson, History of Christian Philosophy in the Middle Ages, New York, 955, pp. 244f, 540.</page><page sequence="16">A LOGOS-CREATOR AT CHARTRES 95 The arch of the cosmos or, as we saw, primeval matter at the feet of the creator, has been misinterpreted as the contour of the decorative curvature of the plinth of the bench. This bench is now carefully drawn, its jewelled upper surface being seen 'correctly' from above. This upper surface again represents a misinformed transformation of the quilting of the cushion, of the essential iconographic insignia of the enthroned deity, with a tradition going back to pre-Carolingian times. The green colour of the original cushion has now covered not only the upper surface, but also the front of the strictly amber apocalyptic throne. The iconography of the globe has been even more profaned. One could perhaps accept the brown earth becoming green, but scarcely the copyist's blood-red for Thierry's carefully developed, vaporous heaven. Significantly, the thin line denoting the firmament has not been noticed by the copyist. The interpretation of the little castle of the inhabited earth, a central theme of the original iconography, as the heraldic castle of Castile is, of course, quite impossible. This proud concession to man's place in the universe has been degraded to the heraldic emblem of the supposed donors of the neighbouring fagade windows. Such usurpation of theological prerogative would stand alone in the iconography of the thirteenth century.30 Gone too are the symbolic proportions and the proximity of the globe to the halo. Both have become red decorative baubles against the blue background, the red and white mass of the halo subject, apparently, more to a new decorative taste than to iconographic exactness. We see, thus, the same symmetrical raising of the arms as in the original, but here the effect is that of a conjurer. The hand raised in benediction corrects the faults of drawing in the medieval hand. It now appears heavily painted in three-dimensional correctness-but blesses outwards in the direction of the north fagade. The face of the Logos, in window no. 138 finely drawn in linear transcen- dental expressionism, has become a heavily painted mass. We limit ourselves to a comparison of the eyes-there, a black pupil staring widely from the surface of an open eye, here soft brown irises comfortably bedded well under the lids. The white raiment of the Logos was in the thirteenth century a reference to light, the essence of divine splendour, the 'light of the world' of St. John's Gospel, the colour of Christ's garment par excellence. While the divinity of Jesus was expressed in white, the red of his cloak denoted his Incarnation.31 The copyist has given the Logos a heavy green tunic, richly embroidered with gold on the sleeves and with heavy, spatially-developed and deeply-shadowed folds at the neck-line. The brown cloak has a cord in front, indeed familiar in the iconography of Christ as a light decorative stroke in miniature painting (e.g. the Blanche Psalter), but here copied from the solid cord of the costume of profane figures, and unparalleled in monumental portrayals of the Logos in the thirteenth century. 3o 1Emile Male's (L'art religieux de XIII sidcle, Paris, 1923, pp. 347ff.) opinion that the piety of the royal house severely limited the extent of their iconographic representation at Chartres would be scarcely tenable if this window were indeed thirteenth century. Mile's opinion is under re-consideration by Hans Kunze-at least with respect to the galleries of kings on the fagades. Also J. G. Prinz von Hohenzollern, Die Kbnigsgallerie der franzisischen Kathedrale, Munich, 1965. 31 Gottfried Haupt, Die Farbensymbolik in der sakralen Kunst . . . , Dresden, 1941: the colour white, pp. 75f., red, pp. 84f.</page><page sequence="17">96 JAN VAN DER MEULEN The Book, the vehicle of so much symbolism in its independent levitation, its existence with God, now rests correctly on the knee, its pages, carefully drawn, being physically held open by a heavy fold of cloth assuring gravity and stability. Again, apocalyptic amber has given way to the pale turquoise of a cover jewelled in the nature of the Gospel books of the portal sculptures, and apparently copied from the same source as the cord of the cloak. Finally, the sun has lost its planets, the moon its stars. But the sun itself has also lost the flames of Thierry's cosmogony. Like the halo, it has been degraded to a red and white decorative motif, apparently influenced by the heraldic quatrefoil decoration of window no. I38. (One last word may be added on the decoration. The stylized plant-motif of the large quatrefoils of window no. 138, there motivated by the form, have been here taken over in the large lobes of the central opening, turned against the radius and geo- metricized in a sterile manner.) It is impossible to reconcile these changes with the dogmatic iconographic development of the first half of the thirteenth century. The unusual state of preservation emphasized by Delaporte also points to a later execution. However, as the general style remains undeniably that of the thirteenth century, and as no period of the developing Gothic would revert to earlier forms, we must look to a period more acquainted with the eclectic attitude. Windows nos. 139 to 144 can hardly have been executed before the late fifteenth century.32 For the first two hundred and fifty years at least, these windows were probably filled with grisaille. We cannot here solve the stylistic problems arising out of this observation. The eclectic imitation of an older style confronts us with theoretical problems which must be deferred to later studies. One discrepancy may, however, be mentioned: the robes obviously follow the high-Gothic style of long, recti- linear-breaking folds (which commence with the early work of the sculptor of the figure of Joseph in the central west portal of Rheims cathedral), mixed, however, with a form of broad depression in the style of the Muldenfalten, not, however, the true fine-lined flowing Mulde, but a sort of extended dent, pushed in under the high-Gothic (Josephsmeister) folds, or lying unmotivated across larger surfaces as a sort of modelling shadow. It is difficult to interpret this additive combination of elements of style of the two categories as a transitional manifestation, whereas the attempt to model with shadow accords with the demands of the early Renaissance.3 At the present stage of research it would be unwise to refer to the problems of the rest of the clerestory stained glass of both transepts. At most it may perhaps be mentioned that the major figures of windows nos, 139, I40, I42 and 143 are almost certainly not thirteenth century and that those of nos. 96, 97 and 103 may also be suspect.34 The irresponsible iconography of the 32 A period of active work on the cathedral commenced under Jean de B6auce, at the beginning of the sixteenth century.

But further criteria can be brought to bear on the incongruity of the copy no. 144. Typology and Topography The creation composition of window no. 138 does not, as we have seen, represent one momentary act or day of creation from the Hexameron as had been depicted in Genesis bible illustration since the early Christian era. Selected details of the Hexameron have been taken from the narrative progression of the days of creation (heaven and earth, the firmament, dry land and oceans, heavenly bodies) and combined into a representational monumental composition as a formal Creator mundi, the Logos as the causal and essential being of the universe. (This composition is preserved in no other contemporary monumental art.35) At first this seems to indicate that the en face enthroned Christ of the composition breaks in on the apparent prerogative of the Majestas Domini, an iconographic theme which is generally accepted to be wholly or at least primarily eschatologically orientated. The element of providence is, it is true, common to both the majestas domini and to the creation window in Chartres, but in general no relationship has been found between Hexameron iconography and the apocalyptic theophany which is fundamental to the majestas. Can the composition of the Chartres window then be explained as a purely formal mutation of the majestas domini tradition, achieved simply by the addition of the sun and moon and the division of the regal orb into the elements of the created world-globe? Certainly not. That this question can even arise-in spite of the obvious antipodal iconographic content-is only due to the fact that earlier studies have been largely limited to an interpreta- tion of all creation iconography as relative only to Genesis i, without reference to its essential providential aspects or its dialectical-typological relationship to the Apocalypse. Although the complex background of the typology of the creation and its relationship to the New Testament and Last Judgement must be deferred to our later study, certain elements are already obvious in the topography of the themes at Chartres itself-and as such contribute to solving the question of the copied composition of window no. 144. The adjacent rosette, namely, window no. 135,36 around the corner in the first bay of the choir, contains the iconographic counterpart of the creation theme: again Christ enthroned, en face, his right hand raised in blessing, in his left the orb. He is crowned, and flanked by three-branched candlesticks. The majestas theme is further confirmed by the apocalyptic letters37 Alpha and Omega, which flank the halo.38 Without going too deeply into the iconology, inventaire of the church of Saint-Saturnin in Chartres in 1571: 'une petite croix d'argent dor6, "oii sont 2 petitz barilletz penduz" ', cf. Delaporte (see above, n. I), p. 442. 36 Cf. n. 41, below. ** Delaporte, pl. ccxliii. "' After the twelfth century this common epithet for Alpha and Omega appears to be generally justified, although even as late as the execution of the stained glass of Chartres these letters still appear in the context of creation iconography, cf. n. 41, below. 38 The orb is divided into four abstract zones symbolizing the four elements. This reference to the substance of the universe in a composition which is otherwise obviously apocalyptic, is unique. Cf. window no. 7o.</page><page sequence="19">98 JAN VAN DER MEULEN it is apparent that-in spite of their present meaningless juxtaposition-we are here concerned with an antithetic pair: the visionary theophany of the majestas domini based on Ezekiel and the Revelation of St. John as against the manifestation of God (the deity) through his works, i.e. his creation. The copy, no. 144, on the other hand, stands alone, the thematic dependence on the complementary apocalyptic portrayal has not been recognized: the outer form of no. i38 has merely been decoratively repeated without its icono- graphic content having been understood. Before studying the present juxtaposition of the windows nos. 135 and 138 it is necessary to refer to the appearance of the same antithetic themes in another pair of rosettes in the cathedral, namely in the northern ambulatory windows nos. 49 and 52.9 Both oculi are subdivided by quatrefoil armatures enclosing a central medallion containing Christ enthroned. In the eastern- most, no. 49, he is simply shown in benediction, holding the globe in his left hand; the four angels are a reference to the creation of light.40 In the neigh- bouring rosette, no. 52, the quatrefoil contains the four animals of the tetramorph, while Christ holds the book of life in his left hand and is flanked by the candlesticks of Revelation and, again, by Alpha and Omega. (The instances where elements of both creation and apocalyptic iconography appear in one and the same majestas portrayal, involve questions of the origins and synthesis of the typology which must be reserved for our following study.41) The iconography of the two theophanies of windows nos. 135 and 138 thus indicates that they must originally have had (or have been planned to have) ** Delaporte, pl. cxlv. 40 Two hold sceptres and two censers, apparently in reference to the differentiation of the angel choirs. 41 Important examples of this synthesis of creation and majestas iconography in the monumental art of the thirteenth century are, for example in Chartres: the rosette of the neighbouring window to the west of no. 52, no. 55 (Delaporte, pl. cxlvii), which contains the same theme in the lobes of the quatrefoil while the apocalyptic symbols of the central medallion are lacking. Instead, red dots, like the stars of our creation composition, are scattered on the background. (A corre- sponding rosette in the southern aisle, no. 2 I -Delaporte, pl. lvii-appears to have originally been identical.) That this reflects a synthesis of the two themes can be construed from the eighth and last Christ binissant por- trayed in the cathedral rosettes: in the second last clerestory bay on the south side of the nave, the rosette no. 70 (Delaporte, pl. clxxxv) shows the enthroned Christ again holding the globe divided into four zones (as in the rosette no. 135, cf. n. 38, above) flanked ceremonially by two angels-a substitute for the creation of light, or even the whole Hexameron, traceable in the twelfth century. Inserted into this obvious creation icono- graphy we see the letters Alpha and Omega flanking the head of the Logos. In the thirteenth-century frescoes the Logos flanked by the sun and moon, holding the globe in his left hand, but surrounded by the apocalyptic tetramorph, appears for instance at Escurolles (Allier), south of Nevers (cf. Paul Deschamps and Marc Thibout, La peinture murale en France au ddbut de l'epoque gothique, Paris, 1963, pl. cxii, fig. 2 and p. 18I); the 'fond de roses a petites tiges' may be a later conversion of the original stars. At Rouy (Nievre) (Deschamps- Thibout, pl. cxxxiv, fig. 2 and p. 204), the globe held in his hand is even divided into zones of light and dark against a background of stars; perhaps the sun and moon were present, but this does not seem to be the case with a later example in the Nievre area, at Cosne-sur-Loire (Deschamps-Thibout, pl. cxxxv and p. 204) or the more important earlier example in the Baptistbre Saint-Jean, Poitiers (Deschamps-Thibout, pl. 1, fig. 2 and p. IO6). Conlie (Sarthe), Sarg6 (Loir-et- Cher) and Saulcet (Allier) must also be investigated.</page><page sequence="20">A LOGOS-CREATOR AT CHARTRES 99 an antithetic (opposite) or complementary (adjacent) topographical relation- ship, one which allowed their being 'seen together'. This can be confirmed by the technical circumstances of their present framing. A summary glance at the framing of all the central medallions of the clerestory rosette windows shows that, in spite of varying bay-widths, the central medallion of the rosette windows of the nave clerestory all have a similar border treatment: two relatively narrow, abstract bands of stained glass. This appears, therefore-in spite of iconographic inconsistencies-to reflect the original condition of the form (the ornamental scheme) of the central medallions. They appear to have been executed as a unified com- mission after the vaulting of the nave as the first complete interior volume of the new cathedral,42 probably before 1220. With the exception of the theophany of no. 135, the eight rosettes of the choir all contain portrayals of knights. All three on the north side and the easternmost of the southern rosettes (nos. I32, 129, 126 and I 16) have simple borders composed of two, three, or four abstract bands similar to those of the nave. The three remaining rosettes on the south side (nos. 107, I 1o and I 13), however, have their borders enriched by a beaded fillet and quatrefoil ornaments, similar to the borders of the two rosettes on the west side of the transept nearest to the crossing (no. 88 in the southern arm and no. 154 in the north). (This development of the border treatment reflects the probable chronology.43 The windows of the choir clerestory, probably donated between i219 and I223, were executed perhaps later. It is significant that the knights portrayed on the rosettes nos. 107, I 10 and i 13, with ornamental borders, all died later-towards or in the forties-than those in medallions with simple borders-roughly between 1218 and 1226. Window no. 154 can be tentatively dated 1234, no. 88 'before 1250'.) The rest of the transept clerestory glass is too confusing to be drawn on for any argument. How do our medallions compare with this development? No. 135 fits well, its border apparently not varying substantially from the neighbouring medallions on the north side of the choir. No. 138, on the other hand, has a broad, stylized vegetable border on the outside of the abstract band which borders the theme of the central medallion. This bay is c. 70-80 cm. larger than the bay of rosette no. 135 and the border has obviously been added to compensate for this discrepancy. The medallions, i.e. the inner circular panels, and therewith also the figures of the Christ, must be relatively equal in size and must have been fabricated originally for medallions of equal dimensions. The involuntary expedient of the addition of a broad, distracting display border was then unwittingly taken over by the copier at the time of the execution of window no. 144. It now has intentional decorative intent. But most significant, of course, is the fact that this copy imitated only half of the 42 Cf. van der Meulen (see above, n. 32), passim.

Scholars who know the complicated circumstances of the Chartres iconography will forgive this lapse. For the present it suffices to point out that Frankl's chronology (Art Bulletin, xlv, 1963, p. 312) of the clerestory glass is based on the inexplicable error that Bishop Regnault de Mougon donated window no. 134 before 12I7.
