<plain_text><page sequence="1">23 TABLETS FROM THE SIPPAR LIBRARY XIII ENUMA ANU ELLIL XX By F. N. H. AL-RAWI and A. R. GEORGE* Introduction The Sippar Library tablet IM 124485 is a new source for Tablet XX of Eniuma Anu Ellil (EAE), the great compilation of Babylonian celestial and meteorological omens.1 The twentieth tablet of the series, which deals principally with lunar eclipses on the fourteenth day of each month of the year, was edited by Francesca Rochberg in 1988 along with all the other tablets of lunar-eclipse omens in EAE (Rochberg-Halton 1988: Chapter 10). Rochberg was unable to report the whole text of her MS M = ND 4357, a Neo-Assyrian tablet from the library of the temple of Nabfu at Kalah; it can now be consulted as CTN IV 5 (Wiseman and Black 1996: Pls. 5-6, 145), though the copy of the reverse is inadequate. In addition a Late Babylonian exemplar of a further commentary, written in the time of Philip Arrhidaeus for the scholar Iqisa of Uruk, has come to light in W23300 (now IM 75990), published as Uruk IV 162 (von Weiher 1993: 103-5, 186). Despite these additions to knowledge, some of the text of EAE XX remained poorly enough preserved to make the discovery of a new manuscript very welcome. The new tablet allows seven sections of the text of EAE XX to be reconstructed in full, and our understanding of the technical terminology refined as a consequence. The chief interest of this tablet of EAE emerges more clearly than before. The common denominator of the twelve lunar- eclipse omens of EAE XX is eclipses that, at least notionally, set in "above" and clear "below", as observed in 1. 66 of the tablet published here. However, the observed phenomena that especially distinguish the protases of EAE XX from those of other calendrical lunar-eclipse tablets appear to be particular to partial eclipses. The progress of the eclipse to a point at which the disk is half eclipsed (imgul) or more (eli masali illik) is explicitly recorded on six occasions (??I.2, IV, V, VII, VIII, IX). The portents relate either to the moon's "emblem" (surinnu), a term that signifies the moon in eclipse (??I. 1, IV),2 to its "horns" (qarnu), i.e. the cusps of the partially eclipsed disk (??VIII, IX, X, XI, XII), or to both (??V, VII). It seems that what the compiler of EAE XX considered most portentous were the appearance, behaviour and other aspects of the lunar disk while the moon was half, or more than half, eclipsed. Tablets XX and XXI of Enama Anu Ellil are characterized by long apodoses on ostensibly historical topics, predicting the military and political fortunes of the cities of Babylonia (Akkade, Ur, Babylon, Borsippa, Mutabal, Dilbat, Eridu, DIr, Esnunna), of Babylonia as a whole (called Akkad) and of foreign nations such as Assyria (called Subartu), Gutium, Amurru, Elam, Ansan, Umman-manda and Dilmun. These apodoses elicit different responses from scholars of different disciplines. Historians of astronomy and scientists interested in ancient Mesopotamian astronom- ical data have used them as evidence for determining the chronology of the Old Akkadian and Ur III periods: prominent here are Johann Schaumberger (1949, 1954-6) and more recently Peter * Al-Rawi's work on the publication of the Tablets from the Sippar Library in Iraq 52 and subsequent issues has been aided by the generosity of the British School of Archaeology in Iraq. His contribution to the present article was the cuneiform copies, photographs and transliteration of IM 124485; George wrote the introduction, translation, textual notes and commentary. Both authors thank Dr Frances Reynolds for expertly collating the commentary tablet IM 75990 in Baghdad in September 1998, and are grateful to Professor Hermann Hunger for alerting us to errors. Those that remain are our responsibility. I For surveys of the contents of the series Eniuma Anu Ellil and associated scholia see recently Koch-Westenholz 1995: 76-93, Hunger and Pingree 1999: 12-22, Reiner 1999, Brown 2000: 254-6, and Rochberg 2004: 66-78. 20n fuinnu as a technical term in celestial observation Iraq LXVIII (2006) for the "crescent shaped appearance of an eclipsed moon" see Rochberg-Halton 1988: 177, with further discussion on p. 62 fn. 147. The newly available LB commentary Uruk IV 162 adds to our knowledge with this passage of explanation (obv. 4-6, coll. F. Reynolds): su-ri-in-ni: qar-nu: MIN : sal- mu 3' libbi(sai) sin(30) : 9d-nis ina gu-ri-in-S dili-pdt ana libbi(sa) 30 irub(ku4): su-ri-in-ni: i-da-tum ana attale(AN.MI) "'emblem' = horn, ditto = the figure inside the moon; alternatively, (in a protasis like) '(If) through its "emblem" Venus enters the moon', 'emblem' = portents for an eclipse". The gist of this is that furinnu refers essentially to the ominous parts of the moon in eclipse, both its cusps ("horns") and its face. The passage should be added to the evidence for the Babylonian "man in the moon", for which see Beaulieu 1999.</page><page sequence="2">24 F. N. H. AL-RAWI AND A. R. GEORGE Huber (e.g. 1987, 1999-2000, 2000) and, for the Ur III period only, V. G. Gurzadyan (Gasche et al. 1998: 74-6, Gurzadyan 2000). These scholars work on the assumption that omen apodoses in EAE XX and XXI signalling the downfall of kings of Akkade and Ur allude to the ends of particular kings of the Sargonic and Ur III dynasties, and seek to match these historical events with computed occurrences of the lunar-eclipse phenomena described in the respective protases. No consensus has yet emerged, however, in what has been a vigorous debate (see also Koch 1998). Assyriologists, who are more critically aware of the history of the cuneiform tradition and the evolution of the great omen compilations such as EAE, know better the shortcomings and limitations of the material, and remain highly sceptical of the value of lunar-eclipse omens for the dating of historical events (e.g. van Soldt 1994, Hunger 2000, 2002, Rochberg 2004: 270-1). Doubt arises from the general and repetitious nature of the apodotic phrases, the absence from them of named individuals such as kings, the invention of history that never was (as in EAE XX ?XI when Ur is said to take over the hegemony of Babylon) and, finally, the total lack of such apodoses in Old Babylonian eclipse omens, a lack which implies that portent and prediction were paired many centuries after the time to which some of the apodoses are supposed to refer. In addition it is well known that the redactors of Babylonian omen texts used schematic patterns in elaborating their texts. In the lunar-eclipse omens of EAE patterns emerge in the association of the various features of an eclipse and the political regions of the Babylonian world, themselves idealized as four quadrants: Akkad (Babylonia), Elam, Amurru and Subartu with Gutium (Rochberg-Halton 1988: 51-5). A logical relationship between protasis and apodosis was thereby artificially induced, which allowed extrapolation of matching protases and apodoses without empirical base. As in other omens, impossible observations are included, not only in the positing of eclipses on days of the lunar month when eclipses cannot take place, but also in the inclusion of eclipses of impossibly long duration. In Babylonian omen texts theory predominated over empiricism, with the consequence that, as texts were expanded and adapted to schematic patterns, any embedded historical data were subject to distortion and alteration. As one scholar puts it, "if [the lunar-eclipse apodoses] were occasioned by historical events at all, the description of these events may nevertheless have been altered in ways that make it impossible to identify their historical basis" (Hunger 2000: 158). Another astrological omen text long used as the foundation stone of early second-millennium chronology, the Venus tablet of Ammisaduqa (EAE LXIII), is also now considered by some to present data too distorted to be a reliable chronological tool (Gasche et al. 1998: 72-4, Gurzadyan 2000: 180-3). A further pitfall that attends work on the lunar-eclipse omens is the occasional unreliability of the edition that provides the primary data. A pertinent example for would-be chronologists is the portent of 14 Simanu predicting the death of a king of Ur, for it is often assumed to report an historical eclipse that attended the end of gulgi (EAE XX ?111). As edited by Rochberg, there were two versions of the protasis, which differed with regard to the details of the watches in which the eclipse occurred. One (A) read [EN.NUN A]N.USAN ZI-ma [EN.NUN MUR]UB4.BA TAG-Ut and the other (B) had EN.NUN AN.USAN im-su-ul Kc[? .. .1 (Rochberg-Halton 1988: 189-92).3 Commentators have reasonably assumed that these phrases, variously interpreted, represent key developments in the progress of the eclipse and have tried to take account of them in their reckonings of Ur III chronology (Koch 1998: 126, Gurzadyan 2000: 179, Huber 1999-2000: 60, 2000: 169 etc.). However valid their methods, the edition has misled them from the outset: the signs given as im-Ju-ul KI are actually it-ba-am-m[a] (MS U = BM 46239 obv. 9', coll.). The implication of the variants zI-ma and it-ba-am-ma for the reading of the text will be dealt with below, in the note on 11. 2-3. Rochberg's misreading is not an isolated error; others are corrected elsewhere in this article (see also George 1991). Though the new source published here allows for a more complete reconstruction of the pseudo- historical apodoses, we have no desire to address chronological issues here. The historicity of the omens is not our present concern; instead we are interested in the recensional history of EAE XX. 3The entire omen is quoted in three astrological reports (SAA VIII 4: 2-3, 300 rev. 6, 336 rev. 2), and in a Neo- Assyrian excerpt tablet from Kuyunjik (Rochberg-Halton 1988: 224 text G rev. 1-8). Line 5 of the latter reads: ina DA ztrim.KI u ir tirim.KI E?.BA]R SUM (coIl.) "therein the [prediction] is given for Ur [and the king of Ur]".</page><page sequence="3">TABLETS FROM THE SIPPAR LIBRARY XIII. ENUMA ANU ELLIL XX 25 Rochberg identified two distinct recensions of this tablet of the series, one more copied in Assyrian script (Recension A) and another more commonly written in Babylonian script (Recension B). It will become quickly apparent that the Sippar manuscript does not consistently hold true to either, and is thus an eloquent witness to the instability of the textual tradition of EAE in the various Babylonian scribal centres of the first millennium BC. The recensional complexity of the text current in the first-millennium scribal tradition is the subject of the commentary that follows our presentation of the new manuscript. Edition of IM 124485 IM 124485 is described in its colophon simply as the "latter section" (Akk. pirsu arkuz) and accordingly gives the text only of the second half of the EAE XX, covering months seven to twelve (??VII-XII in Rochberg's edition) and adding a section of summary (?XIII). The tablet also bears the excavation number Sippar Library 19/2182, and is published by permission of the University of Baghdad and the Directorate-General of Antiquities in Iraq. Other tablets from the library are dated to the mid-sixth century and thereafter; IM 124485 was no doubt written at some date in this era, certainly before the library was abandoned in the early fifth century. The tablet measures 3.6 x 9.2 x 16.3 cm. In the transliteration immediately below, signs marked with an asterisk are read from the photograph rather than the copy. IM 124485.

Notes 1. The spelling imAR for amurru is a common abbreviation also used in 1. 57 of this tablet. 2. Here and in all the following lunar-eclipse omens, the name of the wind is an abbreviation for ina lumun libbffu iltanu etc. itbema "during his evil portent (i.e. the moon's eclipse) a north etc. wind arises" (as in EAE XX ?1; see Rochberg-Halton 1988: 184). 2-3. The clauses in EAE XX mentioning the three watches of the night contain technical terminology that has caused some difficulty in the past, especially the verbs masialu and zi, which both occur here. Noting the parallelism of the time expressions that combine the name of a watch with the verbs s.urru, masalu and quttd2, Rochberg understood the watch to be adverbial and identified the grammatical subject of usarri, imsul and uqatti as ilu "the god", i.e. the moon in eclipse (Rochberg-Halton 1988: 45), so that, for example, in EAE XX ?V qabifta ims'ul is translated "in the middle watch [the moon] is half (eclipsed)" (Rochberg-Halton 1988: 196). In support of Rochberg's position we note that sometimes scribes placed the preposition ina before the watch name, clearly marking it as adverbial (EAE XX ?1.2 MS D 15, ed. Rochberg-Halton 1988: 185; ?VII MS D rev. 5, ed. ibid. 203; ?XI 1. 44 of the present tablet). Without ina the watch names can be read in the accusative, as we have done, following the example of an Old Babylonian lunar protasis, BE i-lum ba-ra-ar- tam i-na UD.9.KAM ar-hi-is i-te-ru-ub "if in the evening watch on the ninth day the (moon) god goes in too early" (Bauer 1936: 310 11. 15-16). On the other hand, several tablets of EAE preface the watch name with a preposition much more consistently, and this seems to be normal usage, for outside certain tablets of EAE adverbial use of the watch names without any preposition is very rare. Accordingly, it may be that the formulation EN.NUN x meaning "in watch x" is another example of abbreviated writing in EAE XX and stands for ina EN.NUN X. There is a more general point in favour of Rochberg's position. Lunar eclipses were the work of the moon god and, in descriptions of an eclipse's progress, Sin is clearly the unspoken subject of many of the various verbs that are employed: with attalu "eclipse" as the explicit or implicit object, the moon god "brings the eclipse about" (attald iskun), "makes it begin" (usarri, factitive contra CAD S/3 359), and "brings it to an end" (uqatti). The phrasing fits the Babylonians' anthropomorphic conceptualizing of lunar eclipses and other celestial phenomena, on which see Rochberg 2004: 72. It makes for a coherent approach if the agency of Sin is also observed in other verbs that describe the eclipse's progress: thus the moon god "becomes seen" (innamir), "goes" (illik), "arises" (itbd), "reaches half" (imrul) and "removes" (itbal) his face. More idiomatic translations of some of these verbs will be offered as they occur. The identification of the moon god as the logical subject of verbs that describe the eclipse's progress makes it necessary to reject the ad hoc translations of masialu and zi in the protasis of EAE XX ?111 proposed by the physicist Peter Huber (1999-2000: 60, 2000: 169), for whom the eclipse was the subject and the watch the object, and by Johannes Koch (1998: 126 "die Abendwache vorulbergeht", "halb voruber ist") and V. G. Gurzadyan (2000: 179: "the evening watches passes", "is half over"), for whom the subjects were the 4Corrupt for "wherever cities are, devastation will occur".</page><page sequence="12">34 F. N. H. AL-RAWI AND A. R. GEORGE watches; as we have noted in the introduction, imsul is in any case a phantom in that protasis, deriving from a misreading. As for zi, Rochberg read this as a logogram for nasiihu and took this to mean "to pass" a watch, so that, for example, she renders bardrita issuhma in EAE XX ?111 as "(the eclipse) passes the first watch" (Rochberg- Halton 1988: 189). The problem with this is that nasahu does not mean to spend time; the verb for that is Sutabrti. As a technical term in measuring time, nasahu can mean "to go by, elapse" of days and other units of time, a usage too common to need more than a reference to the dictionaries (CAD N/2: 10-11 plus 1. 53 of this tablet and its duplicates). Some have read barirltu issuh(zi)-ma in EAE XX ?111 and translated accordingly (Koch 1978: 126, Gurzadyan 2000: 179, quoted above). But all this is no longer relevant, for, as noted in the introduction, one witness (MS U) of EAE XX ?III barirUta zI-ma qablTta ilput writes the first verb as it-ba-am-ma. The correct reading of zi-ma in the watch clauses of lunar-eclipse omens is therefore not issuh-ma but itbdm-ma, and thus we have read it here. The verb also occurs spelled phonetically in EAE XX ?1I, where the sense is clear despite the broken context (MS S 28-9, coll.): bardrTta(en.nun.an.usan) [ ... adi na]-pa-hi it-ba-am-ma asar(ki) 'gamfi(utu) innamir(igi) "if (the moon god) in the evening watch [. . . and] he keeps going [until] dawn and is visible alongside the sun". In EAE XX ?III the subject of both verbs in the passage barlrfta itbdmma qabi-ta ilput is the moon god: "(if) he keeps going through the evening watch and then touches the middle watch". These instances also determine that the verb teba, when used of the moon, does not mean "to rise" (which is asu, napahu) but "to make progress". Returning to the passage under comment: if the moon god was already half-eclipsed in the middle watch and remained visible at dawn, ?VII as it now stands reports an impossibly long eclipse. In a text which is deeply schematic physical impossibility is not a fatal objection, and over-long eclipses have been noted in other protases of EAE. It was perhaps for this reason, however, that ancient commentators came up with an alternative understanding of qabita imsul. In explaining what is meant by this expression in EAE XX ?lb, the recently published Late Babylonian commentary from Uruk has this to say: qablTta(en.nun.murub.ba4) im-sil-ma a-di namru(zalag) illik(gin) dsamag(utu) la imur(igi)-Ju: ina mi-Ail mu-?u 20attali(AN.MI) usarri(sar)-ma a-di la res(sag) pu-u-su namir(zalag)-ma Uruk IV 162 obv. 19-20, coll. Reynolds "(If) in the middle watch (the moon god) reaches halfway and continues (in eclipse) until it is light (but) the sun does not see him": (this means the moon) began the eclipse at midnight and stayed shining right up to (the emergence) of the first tip of the white part (of the sun's disk). The protasis under comment describes an overlong eclipse of much the same duration as that in EAE XX ?VII. The explanation appended to it glosses qabi-ta ims?ul "in the middle watch he reached halfway" with a temporal phrase, ina misil miusi "at midnight", demonstrating clearly that the expression qabtita imgul has been reinterpreted as qablTtu imsul "the middle watch was half over". While qablTtu imsul is perfectly good Akkadian and elsewhere might signify midnight, we do not think this passage of commentary is a vindication of the translations of Koch and Gurzadyan in the present context. Rather it is an example of the inventiveness of late scholars working in a tradition where the ascription of alternative and supplementary meanings to written portents was part of the philological method; for other, unambiguous examples of the reinterpretation of phrases of protasis on the same tablet see below, the commentary on ?XII Scholia. The last matter for comment in this passage is the meaning of eli masali in 1. 3. This expression also occurs in the summaries of ??IX and X (11. 32 and 40 of this manuscript), where the verb teba is replaced by aldku and no watch is at issue. Rochberg comments that "whether masalu refers to the midpoint of the eclipse duration or of the duration of the night is not known" (Rochberg-Halton 1988: 201). It seems a little superfluous, in a protasis that records an eclipse's progress from the middle watch to dawn, to state explicitly that the eclipse carried on after midnight. More probably the expression eli magali aldku/tebu signifies passage beyond the mid-point in a total or near-total eclipse, i.e. when the lunar disk is more than half covered by the earth's shadow. A comparable usage of masalu occurs in the line of the Babylonian poem of creation in which Marduk determines when the moon should be at first quarter (Enama elis V 17): ina UD.7.KAM a-ga- a [lu masl-la "on the seventh day [let] the 'crown' be [half]". The expression eli masali alaiku/teba thus describes a continuing decrease in the size of the lit surface of the moon after half of it has already been obscured (im.ul). It is when this stage of an eclipse is reached that the lit surface most resembles a crescent, and so we note that what the many protases of EAE XX find especially portentous is the particular shape or other attribute of the moon god's horns: these are the crescent's cusps (11. 3-4, 20, 27, 35-6, 44-5, 56-7 of the present manuscript). 3. The lacuna is restored from BM 38164 (Rochberg-Halton 1988: 220, Text a) iii 3': MUL ina ?U.NIR Si ZAG-SU TE-m[a . . . ] (coll.). 4. The significance of the wind's direction for the prediction is now explicitly stated in the Late Babylonian commentary on EAF XX, in the section on ?1 (Uruk IV 162 obv. 7-9, coll. Reynolds): sairu(im) X 8 mna qat1(Niu)rnin-ka tu-kal : sairu(im) sa ana matati(kur.kur) il-la-ku pi-sir a-na libbi(?ai) 9 ta-qab-bi "the wind that you keep in mind (means) the wind that blows on the lands; thereby you pronounce the prediction"'. 10. The missing text cannot yet be recovered, for other witnesses to this passage are damaged: see the commentary below on the supplementary omen of EAE XX ?VII. 15. The "brightening" of the cities may refer to festivities, for namaru is used to describe the mood of such</page><page sequence="13">TABLETS FROM THE SIPPAR LIBRARY XIII. ENUMA ANU ELLIL XX 35 occasions; however, this hardly fits the gloomy fortunes predicted for Babylon, Dilbat and Mutabal in the immediately preceding lines. 16. The decipherment of the last two clauses of the apodosis is provisional. As read here, the reference seems to be a scenario in which statues were stripped of their costly metals and precious gems and cast aside; revenue so obtained bolstered the purchasing power of the great institutions in times of insolvency. The final word of the clause of summary, if correctly read s'atu, is a solecism; the clause is assumed to be an inferior alternative to ki'am ittasu u purussiUu, which rounds off other sections of EAE XX (see 11. 2, 41, 53 of this tablet). 31. The phrase zaran qabliti is explained as the well-known harran sut Ellil "Path of the Enlil-Stars" by the Late Babylonian commentary from Uruk (Uruk IV 162 rev. 4'-5'), quoted in the commentary below under ?IX Scholia. 32. The summarizing clause is often couched as a relative clause, as in MS M at this point (CTN IV 5 iv 20-1): ilu(dingir) sa eli(ugu) ma-sa-li [illiku(gin)]ku [21 ki]-a-am itta(gizkim)-supurussa(es.bar)-s'u; see similarly 11. 40-1, 53 of this tablet. In omitting ilu sa the present text follows the example of Rochberg's MS f (quoted below in the commentary on ?IX Apodosis and summary). 34-5. The verb of the temporal clause, uqatti, is transitive, the object being the eclipse (attald) not the name of the watch (contra Rochberg-Halton 1988: 46). Compare, as one among several similar instances, the protasis of EAE XXI ?V: ina sa-t-urri(en.nun.u4.zalle) usarri(sar)-ma u-qat-ti-ma iz-ku "in the dawn watch (the moon) begins and ends (an eclipse) and becomes clear". To see out a watch is expressed instead with ugammir (as in 1. 63 of the present tablet) and igmur. 40-1. The restoration of the end of the apodosis follows Rochberg's MS Q (Rochberg-Halton 1988: 210), the only source for ?X that has an apodosis identical to that of the Sippar tablet, and MS M (CTN IV 5), which has the same protasis. 42-53. This section is restored from MSS Q and M. 45, 47. It is nothing new to note that the verb itbal conveys disappearance in the context of astronomical observation. The usage is idiomatic, with ellipsis of an accusative noun signifying the god's celestial manifesta- tion: Sin anthropomorphically "takes away" his lunar self. 46. Observation of the moon on the 28th day, i.e. the month's last visible moonrise just before dawn, was a Babylonian technique for predicting eclipses in the short term (see Rochberg 2004: 272). 56. For sit-urri uqatti see above, on 11. 34-5. 56-7. The tense of innattala follows MS Q iv 20': in-na-ta-la-ma. 60. The unlikely phrase ema alu(uru) rahsu(ra) rubu (nun) iWsakkan is a corruption of ema ali rihsu issakkan, which occurs correctly in MSS Q iv 25', b rev. 11', Y rev. 13' and the commentary MS j rev. 9' (see below on ?XII); the corruption arose probably through a misreading of RA-su (= rihsu) as RA NIN, with NIN (= beltu "mistress") subsequently corrected to NUN (= rubu "prince"). 61. The emendation from sarriiti "kingship" to ameluti "mankind" is made in the light of other versions of this omen: see further the commentary below on ?XII Supplementary omen and summary. 62. The word read it-tan-gag is provisionally taken as ittanaggag from nagiagu "to bray, neigh", but without collation and in the absence of well-preserved parallels the decipherment of the first sign is not secure; other derivations are possible. The apparent lack of agreement between the singular predicate and the lost subject (1. 61: [X (X) X.M]ES, with its plural determinative, might be resolved by positing a collective such as sugullu "cattle" or senu "sheep and goats". 64. The beginning of the line is restored after the pattern of EAE XXII, where the monthly sections begin D1? TA 1 (2, 3 etc.) ITI TA uD.14.KAM "? (If an eclipse occurs) in the first (second, third etc.) month on the fourteenth day". As a writing of ina, TA iS common on that tablet. 67. The reading ukallamka recommends itself in the light of 1. 46// M iv 27 Q iv 10'. Commentary The purpose of this commentary is to set out the text of EAE XX ??VII-XIV in a way in which the different scribal traditions can be more easily distinguished than is possible in the existing edition, at the same time correcting the errors of transliteration perpetrated therein. All tablets in the British Museum, London, and most of those in the Vorderasiatisches Museum, Berlin, have been collated against the original cuneiform by the good grace of the museum authorities. In Baghdad, it was not possible to collate IM 124485. The commentary tablet IM 75990 (Uruk IV 162) was collated on our behalf by Frances Reynolds. The relevant part of the Nimrud exemplar, MS M (CTN IV 5), was read against the published photograph (Wiseman and Black 1996: P1. 145). This work achieved considerable gains, and the results informn all the transliterations given in what follows. Ideally, the whole tablet needs to be re-edited and cuneiform copies made of those many manuscripts for which none is available, but that task must await some other scholar who can devote to it the necessary time and energy.</page><page sequence="14">36 F. N. H. AL-RAWI AND A. R. GEORGE Manuscripts Autopsy of the tablets provoked the following comments on Rochberg's list of manuscripts of EAE XX (Rochberg-Halton 1988: 174-5). N = Sm 459: This manuscript is very similar physically to K 12109 (Fragment 3 in Rochberg- Halton 1988: 228); Sm 237 (Fragment 5, pp. 228-9) might also belong to the same tablet. P = VAT 11787 and Q = VAT 9419 + 11310: These fragments are parts of the same tablet. S="K 3561 (+) 6141": The museum number is more accurately K 3561+8025+9502 (+) K 6141 + 6148 + 6156+9108. The two assemblages touch but do not join satisfactorily enough to permit gluing. According to its colophon this tablet is a copy made from a writing board dated to the eleventh year of Adad-apla-iddina, which gives a terminus post quem for the clay tablet (1058 BC in the conventional chronology). This ancestry lends the manuscript a certain authority, for Adad-apla-iddina's reign was thefloruit of an important master-scholar, Esangil-kin-apli of Borsippa, whom later tradition held responsible for establishing the text of Enuima Anu Ellil (see further below). The tablet displays a distinctive Babylonian ductus that falls somewhere between Middle Babylonian and Neo-Babylonian (diagnostic are the signs Ki and DI with only one oblique wedge and RU with three separate vertical wedges), and uses old-fashioned spellings (e.g. sa-qu'-ui, dam-qa'-tum, ni-pi-ih) more frequently than other manuscripts of EAE XX. Clearly it harks back to older conventions; we shall refer to it as an early Neo-Babylonian manuscript. Though the tablet was found in Nineveh it is unlikely to have been written there. Z =VAT 9740 + 11670: This is a Neo-Assyrian tablet, not a Middle Assyrian one. Rochberg's Text c = VAT 9881 is probably part of the same tablet. Month VII. Tasrftu ? VII Protasis. MS IM 1-4. The protasis of this omen in the Sippar manuscript (henceforth MS IM) agrees in essence with what is preserved of Recension A in Rochberg's edition (Rochberg- Halton 1988: 202-3), but not with that of her Recension B, which includes, where MS IM has simply na'dursu tammar, a wholesale repetition of the omen in what may be called a procedural clause (MS S rev. 3): ila s'a ina na'durls'u idi amurri eli[s i"adru4ma etc., etc. na'durAu tammar]. As the sources of this protasis now stand, it can be observed that Neo-Babylonian MS L (Kuyunjik) and Late Babylonian MSS IM (Sippar) appear to report one version of the text, while the older MS S (early NB) has another. Neo-Assyrian MS M (Nimrud) and Neo-Babylonian MS U (presumed to be from Babylon) could belong to either; but MS U can be associated with MS S on the evidence of earlier sections of the tablet. Neo-Assyrian MS D (Kuyunjik) deviates from both in at least one detail (see the collation at the end of this section). The Neo-Babylonian compilation tablet BM 38164 (also presumed to be from Babylon), a fragmentary source that Rochberg presented as an appendix to her edition of EAE XX (Rochberg-Halton 1988: 219-20, Text a), seems to follow MSS L and IM. There is no need to repeat here Rochberg's transliteration of the protasis of MS S, which is accurate except for a single misreading. But since the protasis of MS IM is translated above, we give now the translation of this variant: 1 ?(If) on 14th Ta'ritu (the moon god) brings about an eclipse and the god in his eclipse becomes dark on the side west above and [clear on the side south below,] 2 the north wind (blows), in the middle watch [he keeps going] beyond' [halfway and ...: you observe the eclipse of ] 3 the god who in his eclipse [became dark] on the side west above [and clear on the side south below, and keep in mind the north wind]. EAE XX ?VII protasis MS S rev. 1-3 ? VII Apodosis. MS IM 5-8. The sources agree that this eclipse omen concerns Mutabal. The apodosis of MS IM differs completely from what remains of the short apodosis handed down by Rochberg's Recension A (Neo-Assyrian MS D rev. 8'): &amp;arru ana &amp;arri nukurta i&amp;appar "king will declare war on king". Tt is more akin to her Recension B, but somewhat longer.

VII Supplementary omen and summary. MS IM 8-16. The apodosis of the eclipse omen is followed in other manuscripts, as in MS IM, by a supplementary omen concerning the stars of Numusda and Marduk. The reason for its presence may be that, like the preceding lunar-eclipse omen, it holds an apodosis concerned with the fortunes of Mutabal. Here, again, there is much variation.

GEORGE The connection between protasis and apodosis is symbolic and a good example of the associ- ations made in the development of Babylonian omen traditions. Numu?da was the patron deity of Kazallu, a town in north Babylonia that evidence from Mari shows to have lain in the territory of the tribal clan Mutiabal. Town and tribespeople formed a military alliance, for example in the late nineteenth century when Kazallu and Mutiabal jointly occupied Larsa, before being driven out by Kudurmabuk early in the reign of his son, Warad-Sin (Charpin 2004: 118). It is thus no surprise that in later Babylonian traditions Numusda of Kazallu became closely linked with the name Mutiabal (as Mutabal). The observation of his star in a position above the star of Marduk determines the political fortunes of their cult-centres: Numugda's Mutabal (i.e. Kazallu) must have success at the expense of Marduk's Babylon. At this point we may already conclude that a simple division of EAE XX into two recensions does not adequately report the ancient evidence. In Babylonia at least three recensions of ?VII were extant in the first millennium, represented by (a) the early Neo-Babylonian MS S and its duplicate, Neo-Babylonian MS U (probably Babylon), (b) Neo-Babylonian MS a (probably Babylon) and (c) Late Babylonian MS IM (Sippar). None of them matches a fourth recension, (d) copied in Assyrian script at Nineveh (MSS D//L). ? VII Other collations.

MS L 13' (p. 203): K]A X MI-SU. Month VIII. Arahsamna ? VIII Protasis. MS IM 17-20. In the eclipse protasis of this section the text of MS IM is duplicated by the two other Neo-Babylonian sources, MS a (probably from Babylon) and MS e (a seventh- century excerpt tablet from Ur) and by Neo-Assyrian MS Z (Ag?ur). The early Neo-Babylonian source MS S, on the other hand, has the directions "above" and "below" transposed: [`2? (If)] on 14th Arahsamna (the moon god) brings about an eclipse and in [his eclipse] the god becomes dark [on the side] east below and [clear] on the side west above, 13 a north wind (blows), in the middle watch he sets out (illik) and [in the dawn] watch he reaches halfway, and his cusps are [jabbing] the sky: 14observe the eclipse of [the god] whose cusps in his eclipse [were] jabbing the sky, and [keep] in mind the north wind. EAEXX ?VITI protasis MS S rev. 12-14 Neo-Assyrian MSS D, N and P are witness to very similar versions of the protasis, but their fragmentary state does not allow complete knowledge of their text. MS D (Kuyunjik) has igmur where early Neo-Babylonian MS S and Late Babylonian MS IM and duplicates all have illikma, so that it refers to an eclipse that sees out the middle watch, perhaps without continuing into the dawn watch. As they stand now, and leaving aside variants in spelling, the fragmentary MSS N (Nineveh) and P (Aggur) agree with both MS S and MS IM, so that this protasis does not determine to which recension they belong. ? VIII Apodosis. MS IM 21-3. The text states that this eclipse omen concerns the city of Eridu; by this time Eridu was uninhabited and its name understood to signify Babylon. In the apodosis MSS IM and e bear witness to essentially the same text, from which the fragmentary MSS D, N, P, Z and a do not deviate in any significant way. MS S begins with other material and then gives the prediction for Eridu, as follows: [15DI? ina ITI.AP]IN MIN LU.NIG.TUK sa E.BI i-sa-ri[s illaku] UG7 ri-is-ba-tum GAL.[MEs 16ina A ana NUN.KI ES.BAR SUM-in NU[N.KI GURU?.ME]?-SU i&amp;-gag-gi-?u BALA LUGAL K(JR URU ik-ka?-[ad LUGAL LA-mu 17LUGAL q]a-du IM.RI.A-SU GAZ DUMU LUGAL Z[I.MEg-94 KAR]-er EAE XX ?VIII apodosis MS S rev. 15-17 [15?

ENUMA ANU ELLIL XX 39 The extra material consists of an abbreviated protasis and an apodosis of the kind characteristic of second-millenium lunar-eclipse omens. Similar extra omens occur in ??II-VI, IX-X and XII of MS S and will be discussed below, in the concluding section. ? VIII Supplementary omen. MS IM 23-4. After the eclipse omen, a short supplementary omen is interpolated. In MS IM this concerned a conjunction of Venus with the moon on 14th Nisannu. MSS N, P, Z and a also preserve fragmentary traces of the same omen at this point; the only significant variant is offered by MS Z, which gives the date as 15th Nisannu. MS S again stands out as different, citing the month Arahsamna, probably because this was the month at issue in the immediately preceding eclipse omen. It differs in other details too: ina ITI.APIN UD. 14.KAM Idili-pat ana SA 30 KU4-[ma ana ZAG-SU E ZAH] URU U UG.MESzSU GIR KUR ana KUR [GAR-an?] EAE XX ?VIII supplementary omen MS S rev. 17-18 (If ) on 14th Arahsamna Venus enters the moon [and comes out on its right side: 18 destruction of ] a city and its people; an incursion of the enemy [will occur(?)] in the land. ? VIII Scholia. A single item of commentary relates to the protasis of the lunar-eclipse omen. It is preserved on the newly available Late Babylonian commentary from Uruk: [qarnais'u samami] 3nak-pa: AN.MI TIL-tU ina AB.AB GAR-ma : AB.AB X[ ... ]X 4 i-na-di-ir: i-a- an-ni: Uruk IV 162 rev. 3'-4' ["His cusps] are jabbing [the sky"]: (it means the moon god) brings about a total eclipse among the Pleiades; the Pleiades = [. . .]; "(if ) it becomes eclipsed" (means) it changes shape. The topic under comment is common to all sources and does not determine which of the variant omens of ?VIII was known to the commentator. At least three recensions of the text are visible in this section of EAE XX, represented respectively by (a) early Neo-Babylonian MS S, (b) Neo-Assyrian MS D (Kuyunjik), and (c) Late Babylonian MS IM and duplicates. *?VIII Other collations.

Month IX. Kislimu ?IX Protasis. MS IM 25-9. In the protasis there is again a distinction (as in ?VIII) between one recension that describes the eclipse beginning "above" and clearing "below" and another that has these adverbs transposed. Of the eight manuscripts preserving text of this section, MS IM from Sippar is the most complete. As usual, its eclipse begins "above". Three Neo-Assyrian tablets, MSS M (Nimrud), P and Z (both Assur), and an excerpt tablet from Kuyunjik (MS f ) all agree with the protasis preserved on MS IM; two others, MSS D and N (also Kuyunjik), have such scant remains of ?IX that they cannot be restored one way or the other. Neo-Babylonian MS a omits this section. It is again the oldest source, early Neo-Babylonian MS S, in which the eclipse begins "below"; this manuscript also offers an abbreviated version of the procedural clauses: [19? (If) on] 14th [Kislimu] (the moon god) brings about an eclipse and in [his] eclipse the god becomes dark [on the side] north below and [clear] on the side south above, [20 a west wind (blows),] in the dawn watch he reaches halfway, (and) [his] right cusp [is] curled:6 observe the 6Redmng [kap] sat: see the collation of MS S revn 20 at the end of this section.</page><page sequence="18">40 F.

MS IM 29-32. In her edition of ?IX Rochberg presented MS S as the only available source for the apodosis; the excerpt tablet MS f she treated on a different page (Rochberg-Halton 1988: 223). Following the identification of MS IM, and the publication in the 1990s of the tablet from Nimrud (MS M = CTN IV 5) and the Late Babylonian commentary tablet from Uruk (Uruk IV 162), more can now be said about this apodosis. The omen is stated to concern the city of Der. MSS M and IM present essentially the same text of the apodosis, which falls into two parts, concerning (a) the fate of Dar and (b) a predicted movement of Venus. The two texts are only distinguished by an error of haplography in MS M, which for ul ultabbar reads ul-tab-bar (CTN IV 5 iv 8), without negation and thus conveying the opposite fate for the king: "he will live long". The older manuscript, MS S, offers a variant version, beginning with standard phrases not connected with Dar. Since the published edition of MS S is faulty at this point and the new sources help with our understanding of it, the apodosis is given in full: [Dl? ina ITLGAN MIN] I RSK A mi-lum [GIN]-rmal [A.GAR? in-n]a-di KI.LAM TUR SU.G[U7 GAL-.i 22 ina AAana BAD.A]N.KI ES.BAR SU[m-(in) LUGAL BAD.A]N.K, BA.UG7-ma K-SU SI.SA-er s'ar-r[u-ut KUR 23... ]X X X[ X (X) X E]N.NUN MURUB4.BA ina-tal DINGIR e-l ma-sa-[l GIN] EAE XX ?IX apodosis MS S rev. 21-3 [?l(If) in Kislimu ditto:] Adad will rampage.

The god [went] on beyond the halfway point. This passage has been restored from the Neo-Assyrian excerpt tablet MS f (Kuyunjik), which holds a version of the apodosis that is neither exactly that of MS S nor that of MSS M/I TM. Some of the spellings are unusual: ina SA BAD.AN.KI E?.BAR SUM BAD.ANI qur-ru-ub LUGAL BAD.AN.KI KUR-SU u-se- es-ser 15sar-ru-ut KUR uz-lab-bar AN.BAD (= d&lt;dili&gt;-pat?)

Venus(?) will be shining brightly alongside the Yoke of Enlil and 16will be seen in the middle "band". (The god) in his eclipse went on beyond the halfway point: thus his portent and prediction. ?IX Scholia. The planetary prediction is itself partly illuminated by the Late Babylonian comment- ary tablet from Uruk: za-ra-nu qabi-ti(murub4)"m : har-ra-nu rsu-ut den-lill [:] za-rral-nu {x} 5: tur-ri: Uruk IV 162 rev. 4'-5', coll. F. Reynolds The "middle zaranu" is the Path of the Enlil-Stars; zaranu means "band". The presence here of the phrase zaran qabiTti demonstrates that the commentator knew an apodosis like that of MSS IM //M. Taking account of all sources, this section of EAF XX again suggests the existence of at least three recensions, represented respectively by (a) the early Neo-Babylonian source MS 5, (b) the Neo-Assyrian excerpt tablet MS f, and (c) the Late Babylonian Sippar tablet MS TM and its duplicates from Neo-Assyrian cities.</page><page sequence="19">TABLETS FROM THE SIPPAR LIBRARY XIII.

Six manuscripts bear witness to the protasis of ?X: early Neo-Babylonian MS S, Neo-Assyrian MSS C (Kuyunjik), M (Nimrud) and Q (Assur), Neo-Babylonian MS a and Late Babylonian MS IM. Of these, MSS C, Q and a preserve only a few signs. MSS M and IM agree word for word. As becomes clear from the statement at the end of its apodosis (1. 30, quoted below), MS S disagrees as to the duration of the eclipse. It differs also in that it must have provided a fuller version of the procedural clause that exactly matched the observation of the portent. The protasis of MS S reads as follows: [24?T(If) on] 14th [Tebetul (the moon god) brings about an eclipse and [in his eclipse the god] becomes dark [on the side east above] and [clear] on the side west below, [25 a] west wind (blows), in the dawn watch he [begins (the eclipse) but does not bring it to an end, (and) his cusps are of equal size the one not growing] too fat nor the other too thin [observe the eclipse of ] the god whose cusps in his eclipse [26 were of equal size - the one] did not grow too fat nor the other too [thin - and keep] in mind the west wind. EAE XX ?X protasis MS S rev. 24-6 ?X Apodosis and summary. MS IM 38-41. MS a having petered out, five sources are extant for the apodosis. The apodosis relates to Subartu. The extant manuscripts exhibit variation in: (a) whether the omen is stated to be for Subartu and Gutium (so MS IM) or for Subartu alone, (b) what the king of Subartu does, whether, as in MS IM, he attacked and looted, maita ikassad mata isallal, or made peace, mdtdti isallim (these variants arose easily by haplography in logographic writing, where the former is written KUR KUR-acd KUR i-sal-lal and the latter KUR.KUR i-sal-lim), and (c) the synopsis of the protasis at the end, which reflects variant statements of the eclipse's duration in the protasis or even conflicts with the protasis (so MS S). Here MS Q agrees with MS IM in all particulars; MS M, however, differs from MS IM in matters (a) and (b). MS C differs on all three counts; MS S probably agrees with MS C, but damage intervenes to prevent full knowledge of what, in its text, the king of Subartu did. In addition, MS S interpolates other apodoses before the material about Subartu. Rochberg's trans- literation of MS Q is marred only by a single misreading (see the collations at the end of the section). Collated transliterations of both MS S and MS C follow, along with MS M, which was unavailable at the time of Rochberg's edition.

This omen is also the subject of a fragmentary section of the Late Babylonian commentary tablet BM 41053 (rev. 1'-5', ed. Rochberg-Halton 1988: 209 fn. 1). A better-preserved (but different) exposition is given by the more recently published commentary from Uruk. It reads as follows: DIS na ITI.AB UD. 14.KAM AN.MI GAR-ma SI.MES-S 1 -et la ik-bir l -et la iq-tin 6' MAD hab-rat: ina AB.NAGAR AN.MI GAR-ma: EN ITI-SWU: AB.SUHUR.MAS: AB.SUHUR.MA?: KUR SU.BIR4.KI 7 U gu-ti- umr: i-ra-sib: i-da-ku : as-s&amp;um ra-sa-bu: da-a-ku: EAE XX ?X commentary, Uruk IV 162 rev. 5'-7' "? (If) on 14th Tebetu (the moon god) brings about an eclipse and, as regards his cusps, the one does not grow too fat nor the other too thin": (this means) a half moon; "(If) an eclipse takes place in the Crab constellation": the "lord" of its month is the Goat-Fish constellation, the Goat-Fish constellation = Subartu and Gutium; irassib ("he will smite") means "he will kill" because rasabu means "to kill". This passage of commentary cites an abbreviated version of the protasis and then makes three comments. The first is that a partially eclipsed moon with cusps of equal size can be treated as the equivalent of a half-moon. The second asserts that a lunar eclipse on 14th Tebetu (X) is the counterpart of an eclipse in Cancer (IV), that the constellation governing Tebetu is Capricorn (X), and that this constellation signifies the countries Subartu and Gutium. Thereby the protasis of EAE XX ?X is connected with its the apodosis, a common goal of commentaries on omen texts. Finally, the rare verb irassib is elucidated by reference to a common synonym. The pairing of Subartu and Gutium indicates that the commentator was familiar with an apodosis like those preserved on MSS IM // Q and M, rather than that found on MS S, where the text is broken but there is certainly not enough space for both toponyms. At least three recensions are visible in ?X, represented respectively by (a) early Neo-Babylonian MS S, (b) Neo-Assyrian MS C (Kuyunjik) and (c) Late Babylonian MS IM (Sippar) and its near duplicates, Neo-Assyrian MSS Q (Aggur) and the slightly divergent M (Nimrud). ?X Other collations.

They are joined by a Neo-Babylonian tablet probably from Babylon, MS b. MSS M and Q bear essentially the same protasis as MS IM, which is restored from them. MS C adds innamir between the phrases itti Samag and qarnasu same nakpa (IM 44// M iv 24// Q iv 8'), making two clauses of one: "(if the moon god) is observed in the company of the sun (and)</page><page sequence="21">TABLETS FROM THE SIPPAR LIBRARY XIII. ENUMA ANU ELLIL XX 43 his cusps are jabbing the sky". It also must have held more than simply tammarma between ina UD.28.KAM and attala qurrub (IM 45-6//M iv 26//Q iv 9'). The tablet is damaged at this point but collation suggests an explicit object (Rochberg-Halton 1988: 21 1, MS C ii 8'-9'): ina UD.28.KAM DIN[GIR.(30) ina rabe-su? tammar(igi)-ma] 9 attalu qitrub "On the 28th day [you shall observe the (moon)] god [as he rises(?)] (to see if) an eclipse is at hand". MS S is increasingly damaged; the length of text lost in the breaks suggests that (a), like MS C it also included an explicit object before tammarma but (b), unlike all the other witnesses to this protasis, it did not include the phrase qarnas-u same nakpa. Assuming also that it agreed with MS C in other particulars, this is its version of the protasis: [31 (If) on] 14th Sabatu (the moon god) brings about an eclipse and [in his eclipse the god] becomes dark [on the side south above and clear on the side east below, 32a north wind (blows),] he begins (the eclipse) in the dawn watch [and is still visible at sunrise, he does not] cover [all of the "emblem"] and disappears: on the 28th day 33 observe the (moon) god as he rises(?)], (to see if an) eclipse is at [hand: he will rise, be red] and show you an eclipse: observe [the eclipse of] the god who in his eclipse [became visible and disappeared,] 34and [keep in mind the] north wind. EAE XX ?XI protasis MS S rev. 31-4 ?XI Apodosis and summary. MS IM 48-53. The omen is stated to concern Babylon. In the apodosis the six manuscripts extant for the protasis are joined for the last two lines by a Neo-Babylonian fragment from Uruk, MS R. MSS C, M and Q are again very close to the text of MS IM; the only significant variants are a preference for qurrub in MSS IM, M and Q against synonymous qitrub in MS C (already seen in the protasis), and MS Q's omission from the final summary of ittasu, which was probably inadvertent. MS R probably matches MS IM (read in 1. 1': B]ALA!? E.KI rzriml.Kl ik-kim {x} "Ur will steal the hegemony(!) of Babylon"). The older source, MS S, differs in more respects. If correctly restored, it reports bad news for Babylon, and indeed the entire world (represented by the "four nations"),7 but then adds an additional, non-calendrical omen which signifies instead a favourable outcome: [ina sA] ana KA.DINGIR.RA.KI ES.BAR SUM-in rKA.DINGIR.RA.KIl [ZAH-SU qit-ru-ub 35 den-lul 1 KUR.KUR ka-l[i-?i-na ittazar KU]R.KUR LIMMU.ME? ina pu-hur DINGIR.MES GAL.MES a-sab Su[B- ti? ... 36BALA-e K]A.DINGIR.RA.[KI SE?.UN]UGki GU.RI.DE it-te-er DINGIR ina KAN5-SU [GI6 is-su 37ILLU ina ID] SEG ina AN GIN-ni EBUR SI.SA dam-qa-tum GAR-[na] EAE XX ?XI apodosis MS S rev. 34-7 [Therein] a prediction is given for Babylon: [the destruction] of Babylon [is near; 35 Enlil has reviled] all the lands: the four nations in the assembly of the great gods, dwelling amid [ruination(?) has been decreed for them(?).

The first three of these comments refer to the protasis. The first explains what is meant by the statement about the moon's face (surinnu "emblem") not being fully covered: the moon has set while totally eclipsed. This seems to be the reverse of the expected explanation; perhaps the text is defective (e.g. for ina attale la gammarti "while partially eclipsed"). The second comment elucidates a word, either rikistu or kisirtu, if that is how KEt-tUz should be transcribed, that is not preserved in the protases that are extant; it can be reconciled with the surviving text if it falls in the broken passage of the protasis represented by MSS S and C, where it could only be the object of tammar. However, neither rikistu nor kisirtu matches the trace of the beginning of this word visible on MS C, where we have read as ila. Whatever the solution to this problem, the explanation "bond of everything" suggests a cosmological interpretation (on the cosmic "bonds" see Horowitz 1998: 265). The third comment explains the summary, which one would have thought lucid enough to need no such comment. The final comment identifies who in the apodosis is meant by the king approved by Enlil. The presence of this topic makes it very likely that the commentator knew an apodosis like that on MSS IM //M/ /Q and MS C, for the phrase in question does not seem to appear on MS S. The eclipse omen of ?XI thus also survives in at least three recensions: (a) that of the oldest source, early Neo-Babylonian MS S, (b) that of Neo-Assyrian MS C (Kuyunjik) and (c) that of Neo-Assyrian MSS M (Nimrud) and Q (Assur) and Late Babylonian MS IM (Sippar). Recensions (b) and (c) are closely related. ?XI Other collations. MS C ii 12' (Rochberg-Halton 1988: 211): BIR-sa qit-ru-ub, DU.A.BI ril-[ru- ur, 14': KAR-ki[m?] Month XII. Addaru ?XII Protasis. MS IM 54-7. Seven manuscripts of EAE XX provide the text of the protasis of ?XII: the Middle Assyrian fragment MS Y (Asgur), early Neo-Babylonian MS S, Neo-Assyrian MSS C (Kuyunjik) and Q (Assur), Neo-Babylonian MSS R (Uruk) and b (probably Babylon), and Late Babylonian MS IM (Sippar). MSS C and Q hold text that is essentially identical with the protasis of MS IM, except that where MS IM cites both west and east winds as blowing during the eclipse, MS Q has only the west wind; MS C is broken in both places where winds are cited, and what option it chose cannot be determined. Now fragmentary, MS R seems to present an anomalous version of the same protasis, with duration and direction transposed: as can be seen on Weidner's copy, the phrase idi iltani elis [i"adir] is clearly preceded by Sdt-ur]ri us'arrfma (Weidner 1954-6: P1. 2 Uruk 159 1. 3', and see the collation at the end of the section). A more radical variant is MS S, which differs as to the direction of the eclipse and omits all reference to the lunar cusps. In this it is matched by MS b, apart from spelling variants. The text of both runs as follows: [38Dl ina ITI.?E UD.14.KAM AN.MI GAR-ma] rDINGIR ina KAN51-SU A IM.U18.LU AN,TA KAN5 rAt IM.KUR.RA KI.[TA iz-ku 39IM.KUR.RA EN.NUN].rU4l.ZAL.LE TIL ina na-pa-hi-hi NU IGI-ir ina GAL-91U 9Reading ina attale gamnmarti adri(3) irbrma.

The last witness is the reverse of Middle Assyrian MS Y, which gives a glimpse of a recension of EAE XX ?XII in the late second millennium. Rochberg's transliteration (Rochberg-Halton 1988: 217-18) fails to convey that the text at this point is written in uncharacteristically narrow columns. Once this is realized, the protasis can be transliterated thus: X [E]N.[NU.UN.ZAL.LE TIL] 2' ina E-[S&amp;U NU IGI ina KU4.BI] 3' it-t[a-an-mar] 4' DINGIR sa ina KA[N5-SU ina E-S NU IGI] 5 ia KU4.BI [it-tan-ma-ru] 6'KAN5-SU IGI.T[AB-ma IM.KUR.RA] ina su is (= DAB!? for tukdl!)

The only substantive difference is the choice of verbs to describe the moon's rising and setting: asu2 "to go out" and erebu "to go in" in MS Y against napahu "to rise" and rabu2 "to set" in MSS S // b. ?XII Apodosis. MS IM 58-60. The omen is stated to pertain to the west (Amurru). The apodoses show considerable variety. Neo-Assyrian MS C (Kuyunjik) falls silent after two fragmentary lines but still manages to pose an enigma, for we are unable to reconcile with any better-preserved manuscript the traces of the two signs preserved in its last line (see the collations at the end of the section). Neo-Assyrian MS Q (Assur) offers a protasis that duplicates Late Babylonian MS IM (Sippar) in all but minor points of spelling, with the exception of two substantive variants: (a) the phrase namar all "brightening of cities""I where MS IM 59 reads nade li- "desertion of cities", and (b), as already noted, the correct phrase ema all rihsu issakkan "wherever there are cities, devastation will occur", where MS IM 60 has corrupted text, ema URU RA NUN issakkan. Little of Neo-Babylonian MS R survives but, as in the protasis, it clearly offers a text unlike that of other sources: A prediction is given for Amurru: [5'... ]s will die. Nations will devour one another [... EAE XX ?XII apodosis MS R 4'-5' In the protasis it was found that the older sources, Middle Assyrian MS Y (Assur) and early Neo-Babylonian MS S, held much in common, and that the tradition of MS S was represented '0If correctly read, the spelling NU ZALAG-ir in MS b is ostensibly la immir "he does not grow bright". Although this makes some sort of sense in the context of eclipse omens, we suspect that its presence is owed to an ancient misinterpretation of Id innamir "he cannot be observed" (so MS S) as if from namaru "to grow bright" not nanmuru "to be observed", and a consequent adjustment of the spelling. " This obscure phrase has already occurred in the Sippar manuscript at ?VII (IM 15). Rochberg read MS Q iv 23' [kba-mar URU.MEJ but it is clear from Weidner's copy ( 1954-6: P1. 1 ) that space is lacking for this reading.</page><page sequence="24">46 F. N. H. AL-RAWI AND A. R.

MS IM 60-3. ?XII of EAE XX is one of those sections that append a supplementary omen without obvious connection to lunar eclipses (see already ??VII and VIII). In this case the supplementary omen concerns the rising during daylight of the star of Papsukkal (var. Sipazianna = Orion).13 As far as they are preserved, Neo-Assyrian MS Q (Aggur), now fragmentary, and Neo-Babylonian MS R (Uruk), which retains only a single phrase of this supplementary omen, do not differ greatly from the text handed down on Late Babylonian MS IM (Sippar), but they are not exact duplicates; for improved readings of MS Q see the collations at the end of the section. The supplementary omen appears on MSS S//b and Y as follows: 45 [MUL.SIPA.ZI.A]N.NA EN ni-pi-ih dUTU GUB-iZ KI NAM.LU.U18.LU MA?.rANSE1 AB.GU[D.HI.A. . KUR ia-ar-ru-u]r? ah-rat UG.ME? UG7.ME?

The former calls to mind Sum. igi.nigin.na = Akk. suddpwni, a physical condition characterized by giddi- ness. Elsewhere in EAE XX MS S writes ib-bu-tui where other sources have ubbutu "starvation", as noted by Rochberg-Halton 1988: 181 n. 2, 195 1. 5, 214 n. 4. 13 For the equation of the messenger god Papsukkal with the constellation Sipazianna (Orion) in mu'Apin and other texts, see Wiggermann 2001: 500 ?7 and the references there cited.</page><page sequence="25">TABLETS FROM THE SIPPAR LIBRARY XIII.

The various accounts of this omen hold no consensus as to where the boundary falls between the protasis and the apodosis. In Middle Assyrian MS Y the clause that pertains to humankind is placed in the protasis and that concerning livestock in the apodosis. In early Neo-Babylonian MS S and its duplicate, humans and livestock fall together in the protasis. Late Babylonian MS IM and its duplicates place humans and livestock in the apodosis. The phrasing of protasis and apodosis changed radically as different editors strove for meaning. ?XII Scholia. This section as a whole is the subject of comment by the Late Babylonian commentary tablet from Uruk, Uruk IV 162. At this point it is supplemented by the more fragmentary tablet transliterated by Rochberg as EAE XX text k (Rochberg-Halton 1988: 227-8). Also from Uruk, MS k is Seleucid and dated by its colophon to about a century after Uruk IV 162. Nevertheless the two texts differ only in minor spelling variants, indicating that this was a commentary which had entered the scribal tradition as a text worthy of handing down. We give a transliteration with line-numeration according to the better-preserved exemplar: DIS ia ITI.SE UD. 14.KAM AN.MI GAR-ma SI.MES-SU ina ge-e-ri (sic) la {:} 1 in-na-at-ta-lu ina GAL-SU in-na-at-ta-lu : ina AN.MI TIL-tUi s'a LU[GAL?] 12u-nam-mi-ru su-u TA : i-na : dpap- sukkal KUR-ma KI dUTU GUB: d30 ina 'kB(sup. ras.).SIPA.ZI.AN ana GENNA KUR-ma : AN.MI EN.NUN.U4.ZAL.LE u-gam-mir: AN.MI sa a-di TIL EN.NUN.U4.ZAL.LA {ras.?} GIN: EAE XX ?XII commentary, Uruk IV 162 rev. 10'-14' H/MS k rev. 1'-3' "?(If) on 14th Addaru (the moon god) [brings about] an eclipse and his cusps "' cannot be seen in the morning but can be seen when he sets": in a total eclipse in which (the moon god) lit up 12' Regulus(?) (and) set; the sign ta = "in"; "(If) Papsukkal rises and stands present with the sun": (it means) the moon god in 13' the constellation Sipazianna caught up with Saturn; "(If the moon god in) eclipse completes the dawn watch" (means) an eclipse 14' that went on until the end of the dawn watch. This item of commentary sets out four pieces of information. First is a comment on the basic observation of the eclipse, which establishes an alternative, cryptic reading of the portent. Next (as deciphered here) is a lexical quotation that equates a Sumerian postposition with its Akkadian counterpart; though the preposition ina is written with the sign ta elsewhere in EAE XX (see 1. 62 of MS IM), as well as routinely in EAE XXII, the equation has no immediate relevance to the passage under comment and its presence here may be a relic of a master's discursiveness or a pupil's inattention. Third is an explanation of the supplementary omen about the rising of Orion; this also gives an alternative interpretation of the portent. And finally a standard statement of an eclipse's duration is paraphrased in what may be less technical language. The third point cites the supplementary omen as it appears in Late Babylonian MS IM (Sippar) and not as it appears in MSS S//b and Y. Another tablet of commentary that bears on EAE XX ?XII is Neo-Assyrian K 3145 (Kuyunjik), edited by Rochberg as Text j (Rochberg-Halton 1988: 225-6). The reverse contains only traces but read in 1. 9': e-ma URU ri-ih-su~ GAR-a[n (coll.) "wherever there are cities, devastation will occur".</page><page sequence="26">48 F. N. H. AL-RAWI AND A. R. GEORGE ?XII is remarkable for the independence of its manuscripts. MSS S and b have close affinities, despite the long interval that must separate them. Unsurprisingly, given the relatively early date of MS S, their text shows a close relationship to the Middle Assyrian MS Y. The Late Babylonian commentaries report a text very like that on MS IM and its near duplicates, Neo-Assyrian MSS C and Q. Neo-Babylonian MS R deviates from all other manuscripts. ?XII Other collations.

Section of summary ?XIII. MS IM 64-7. To the twelve sections on calendrical lunar-eclipse omens the recension repres- ented by Late Babylonian MS IM (Sippar) adds a short passage of summary. This is damaged but seems to have consisted of three elements. First is a general statement that lunar eclipses at the full and half-moons are bad portents (IM 64). Next is a fragment of a sentence that we do not understand at present (IM 65); it may be related to the summary of Neo-Babylonian MS b, which mentions purussu(es.bar) attalg(AN.MI) kaltsunu(duf.a.bi) "the predictions of all eclipses" (rev. 21', see Rochberg-Halton 1988: 221). Finally, the foregoing sections are summed up by their common denominator, eclipses that set in "above" and clear "below"; these eclipses the moon is said to reveal to the observer, along with their location and duration. A similar summary is included only on the older source, MS S rev. 50, which is fragmentary (collations at the end of this section). The duplicating tablets of commentary from Late Babylonian Uruk add to our knowledge of this section of text. In combination they read as follows: DI AN.MI: ina UD.7.KAM UD.14.KAM UD.21.KAM r.15': ana UGU IGI(SO k, var.: SAL)-SU U TIL-tU: DI MUL.ME EN.NUN.MES AN.MI u'-kal-lu-mu-ka MUL r-6: sa ina ITI EN.NUN a-na d30 TE-U U DAB-U MUL.ME? ziq(so K, var: GAZ)-pi ?a ina UGU r.17 AN.MI d30 GAR-an pi-s'ir ana AA ta-qab-bi: EAE XX ?XII commentary, Uruk IV 162 rev. 14'-17' (coll.

Stars, watches, eclipse(s), he will show(!) you."'14 A star: 16' that which in the month under watch approached the moon god and passed by; the culminating stars: those that are put(?) on top of the moon's eclipse. Therefrom you can pronounce an interpretation. Not all is certain in this difficult passage and the translation is provisional. The first statement quotes in abbreviated form the protasis known to IM 64; the comment seems to assert that the date of an eclipse is determined by the date of its beginning and end. The dates cited in the quotation are not empirical but schematic; neither the seventh nor the twenty-first of a lunar month can witness a lunar eclipse. But impossible dates permeate EAE and are not the problem here, which is that the commentator's assertion seems a little too obvious. In a calendar that starts a new day at dusk the observed phases of any given lunar eclipse, from first sighting to last, will all take place on the same date. Next is a quotation which uses terminology already encountered in EAE XX (MS IM 46 and 67): it is the moon that "shows" the observer the eclipse and its attendant circumstances. The third item of comment appears to be a definition of what is meant, in the context of lunar-eclipse omens, by kakkabu "star" and kakkabia ziqpi "stars of zenith", i.e. culminating stars. Finally, as the last comment on EAE XX, the commentator asserts the fundamental basis of celestial observation: by observing lunar eclipses and other phenomena one can decode the warnings of the gods and take appropriate measures in response. ?XIII Other collation.

MS IM appends a simple rubric identifying the preceding text as the second half of the tablet and a short colophon recording the faithfulness of the copy. The commentaries hold a catchline, an elaborate rubric identifying the text, and long colophons.

Commentary and oral explanations, passages read from the series Eniuma Anu Ellil, from the part " ' (If) on 14th Nisannu (the moon god) brings about an eclipse and in his eclipse the god". Finished. The last word of the rubric indicates that the tablets hold the complete text of the canonical Late Babylonian commentary on EAE XX. Nevertheless, the catchline they provide is not the first line of EAE XXI, which deals with a lunar eclipse on 14th Nisannu, starting in the south, but an omen of the Yoke Star and its explanation. The same omen probably occurs as the catchline of the fragmentary Kuyunjik commentary tablet MS j rev. 14' (Rochberg-Halton 1988: 227): DIS rMUL.SUDUN1 A.AB.B[A] a-dir. The omen of the dim Yoke Star occurs elsewhere in EAE (A Ch Itar No. 21: 41; K 4166 ii 1', ed. Rochberg-Halton 1988: 272). Its connection with EAE XX is also evident from Neo-Babylonian MS b (Babylon), where this and another omen about the Yoke Star are interpolated after EAE XX ?XII (MS b rev. 14'-17', ed. Rochberg-Halton 1988: 220-1). But that is not the whole evidence. Fragmentary versions of the same two omens survive in other sources of EAE XX: the early Neo- Babylonian MS S and Neo-Assyrian MS Z (Assur).

First is a summary, essentially a variant version of the summary found on LB MS IM 66-7 and its duplicates (MSS S rev. 51 //b rev. 18'). There follow two general "laws" relating eclipses to a prior darkening of the moon and sun (MSS S rev. 52//b rev. 19'-20'). Neo-Assyrian MS Z and Neo-Babylonian MS T conclude with the catchline of EAE XXI; MS Z adds a colophon (broken away on MS T). The excerpt tablet MS b has one further line of summary, a different catchline (rev. 22'= EAE XXIII 1), and then a colophon. MS S concludes with a warning about the text's restricted circulation (rev. 53-4, see collations at the end of this section), a section on the divine origin of lunar eclipses that is otherwise part of EAE XXII (rev. 55-7, see Rochberg-Halton 1988: 216 and 269-70), and finally a colophon (rev. 58). The colophon of MS b shows that in this recension EAE XX was followed by EAE XXIII, the first tablet of solar-eclipse omens (Rochberg-Halton 1988: 178). Other collations of ?XIV and colophons.

Conclusions Jerrold Cooper has recently discussed the terminology that cuneiformists use to describe the texts they edit, and has proposed definitions for use when describing the variant traditions in which the text of a composition is handed down. He makes a useful distinction between "version" and "recension", defining them as follows (Cooper 2005: 50): recension a manuscript or group of manuscripts whose text shows significant but minor variations from other manuscripts of a given literary composition version a manuscript or group of manuscripts whose text shows significant and major variations from other manuscripts of a given literary composition Cooper also comments, in applying the proposed terminology to Sumerian literary compositions, that the "choice of the label 'version' or 'recension' may be subjective, but most Sumerologists would agree most of the time on the choice of one or the other in any given case" (Cooper 2005: 50). He cites the two poems of Gilgames in the Cedar Forest as examples of a composition in two distinct versions, while the Old Babylonian and first-millennium texts of Angimdimma are so close that in his opinion they can be described as different recensions of the same version. Francesca Rochberg discusses the older compilations of lunar-eclipse omens that are ancestral to the developed form of EAE, referring to the Old Babylonian texts as "prototypes or forerunners" and to the late second-millennium compilations as "transitional texts" (Rochberg-Halton 1988: 19-25); she also speaks of the first-millennium text as the "'final' version" (Rochberg 1999: 418). Ulla Koch-Westenholz has already written about the mid-second-millennium lunar-eclipse omens as evidence for a "'proto'-version of the canonical series EAE" (Koch-Westenholz 1993: 235). She noted also that the distinctive mythological paragraphs of EAE I and XXII were already associated with lunar omens at Hattusa and Emar (Koch-Westenholz 1993: 236). That being so, it is safe now to use Cooper's terminology and refer to the second-millennium "forerunners" simply as Old and Middle Babylonian "versions" of EAE. It has long been known that in the first millennium there was no single textus receptus of EAE (see already Weidner 1941-4: 181). In respect to the sources Rochberg used in reconstructing the lunar-eclipse omens she was surely correct to use the term "recension", for while there is much minor variation to be observed in them, there are few major differences. Her identification of two recensions found the division between them broadly reflected in script, with most manuscripts of her Recension A exhibiting Assyrian script and most manuscripts of Recension B, Babylonian hands (Rochberg-Halton 1988: 174). The study of the text conducted above suggests a more complex state of affairs. The sources can first be sorted into distinct groupings by period. Three such groupings are immediately visible:</page><page sequence="29">TABLETS FROM THE SIPPAR LIBRARY XIII. ENUMA ANU ELLIL XX 51 (i) MS Y from the temple of Assur at Assur, which is the only extant Middle Assyrian manuscript of EAE XX in its familiar, developed form, (ii) MS S, an early Neo-Babylonian manuscript claiming to be a lineal descendant, as it were, of an eleventh-century text, and those later sources that exhibit the same text, i.e. Neo- Babylonian MSS U and b from Babylon, which are themselves most probably parts of one exemplar, and (iii) the many manuscripts and smaller numbers of excerpt tablets and commentaries of the seventh to third centuries, represented in the latter half of EAE XX by Neo-Assyrian MSS C, D, N, f (all Kuyunjik), M (Nimrud) and P + Q and Z (both Assur), Neo-Babylonian MSS L and T (both Kuyunjik), R (Uruk), a (Babylon) and e (Ur), and Late Babylonian commentaries MS k and Uruk IV 162 (both Uruk). These three groupings of manuscript are witness to the developed version of EAE (as opposed to the much shorter earlier versions) at three different points in its history. There were at least two recensions of EAE current at the end of the second millennium, represented by the manuscripts of groupings (i) and (ii). The texts of the tablets in these two groupings are similar enough to speak of them as two closely related but distinct recensions, and it seems appropriate to call them respectively the Middle Assyrian recension and the Middle Babylonian recension of the developed version of EAE. That they fail to match is only to be expected: the mid-to-late second millennium was a time when many literary works circulated in widely variant editions, and distinctive textual traditions occur on Middle Assyrian manuscripts from Assur even in relatively stable compositions like Lugale and Angimdimma (Geller 1990: 211). The Middle Babylonian recension of EAE XX, essentially MS S with MSS U and b, is roughly the same as Rochberg's Recension B - she included those same manuscripts together with others that are not witnesses of ??VII ff. (MSS V, W and X), and also MS T (on which see below). As she noted, these are all in Babylonian script and either from Nineveh (Kuyunjik) or Babylon; they show that this Middle Babylonian recension continued to be copied deep into the first millennium. The manuscripts grouped under (iii) present a text of EAE XX that is essentially standardized in order and content but far from uniform in every detail. We have seen that Late Babylonian MS IM is close to Neo-Assyrian MSS M (Nimrud), N (Kuyunjik) and P + Q (Assur), in that substantive variant readings between them are few. Neo-Babylonian excerpt tablet MS e (Ur) and Neo-Assyrian excerpt tablet MS f (Kuyunjik) are also true to MS IM. We may speak of these manuscripts as MS IM and duplicates. Neo-Babylonian MS T (Kuyunjik) and Neo-Assyrian MS Z (A?9ur) are close to MS IM and duplicates but have extra material in conclusion. Neo-Assyrian MSS C and D (both Kuyunjik) are more prone to disagreement with MS IM and duplicates; they do not overlap, so cannot be judged one against the other. Neo-Babylonian MS L (Kuyunjik) is too fragmentary to ascribe to one or other recension with any confidence; Neo-Babylonian MS R (Uruk) is also very meagre but clearly treads a lonely path of its own. Neo-Babylonian MS a (Babylon) and the Hellenistic commentaries from Uruk are mostly faithful to MS IM and duplicates but sometimes diverge from them; the recent date of the commentaries suggests that the text continued to evolve even in the late first millennium. This is also the conclusion that Hermann Hunger came to in editing a commentary on EAE VIII from the same provenance as Uruk IV 162 (Hunger 1995). In short, the extant tablets gathered under grouping (iii) do not speak for a monolithic third recension (i.e. Rochberg's Recension A) but for a cluster of parallel and partly contemporaneous editions that we may call the first-millennium recensions of EAE. The recovery of Late Babylonian MS IM from the Sippar Library has made it possible to sharpen understanding of the recensional differences in first-millennium manuscripts of EAE XX and the text's continuing development in the Late Babylonian period. It remains to say something about the prior evolution of the text. The production of the developed version of EAE, in its several recensions, from the various older Middle Babylonian versions has been attributed to "Kassite period transcribers and editors" (Rochberg-Halton 1984: 127, similarly Rochberg 1999), for this was a time when literary compositions and, especially, omen anthologies, began to be organized into standardized texts. The relationship between these late-second millennium versions of EAE and the still-unpublished Old Babylonian version has been set out by Rochberg (1999: 416-19).</page><page sequence="30">52 F. N. H. AL-RAWI AND A. R. GEORGE Here we may add that what we have identified as a Middle Babylonian recension of the developed version of EAE, essentially early Neo-Babylonian MS S and later duplicates, offers intriguing evidence of how the developed version evolved. Curiously sandwiched between the protasis and apodosis of the lunar-eclipse omens of ?? II-VI, VIII-X and XII of this recension occur additional lunar-eclipse omens that consist of an abbreviated protasis and brief apodotic phrases. These shorter omens are not always easily identified in Rochberg-Halton's edition, where some of them have been misunderstood. Those of ?? VIII-X and XII have already been given in the commentary above; the remainder are presented here in collated transliterations: ?11 [DI? ina ITI.GUD UD X X X ib]-bu-tu GAL.ME?

The abbreviation UD MIN "day ditto" occurs in MS S up to ?V, but is then further reduced to MIN "ditto" in ??VI ff. The full notation signified by these two abbreviations is lost in the lacuna at obv. 30 (?II). Given that the extra omens are embedded in portents of the fourteenth day, one might have expected "day ditto" to signify UD.14.KAM. However, where it is preserved, the later source for the same recension of EAE XX has instead ina Id mindat&amp;u "not at its predicted time" (MS U ??IV-V). Elsewhere in the lunar-eclipse omens this phrase and its synonym, ina la adannffu "at the wrong time", denote eclipses that take observers by surprise by occurring early or late, on days outside the time when they were expected (Rochberg-Halton 1988: 42, Koch-Westenholz 1993: 236). Unpredictable eclipses are not a concern of the Old Babylonian lunar-eclipse omens described by Rochberg (Rochberg-Halton 1988: 19-22, Rochberg 2006), but they do appear in texts of the later second millennium. They are one of the topics of the lunar-eclipse omens from Emar, of a broken Middle Assyrian tablet, BM 121034, and of the fragmentary EAE XVII-XVIII. Close parallels to most of the extra omens of EAE XX can be found in all three texts: ?II (S: ibbutiu ibbas-su-) DI?

[...I These apodoses reveal that lunar eclipses occurring at unexpected times were almost always held to portend economic collapse, famine and widespread mortality. This outcome is explicitly stated in the introduction to the Middle Babylonian recension of EAE XX, which states as a general principle: "? (If the moon god) brings about an eclipse unpredictably: [there will be] starvation [ ... ]" (MSS V 5: DIS ina la mi-na-ti-s[u // S obv. 5: ] la mi-na-ti-shu AN.MI GAR ib-bu- tu [ibba&amp;sz . .. ] // X 3': GA]R ub-bu-tu [, coll.). By contrast to the wealth of parallels collected above, only one good match for the extra omens of MS S can be found by searching the apodoses attached in early texts to an eclipse on the fourteenth day of the respective month. It occurs in the unpublished Old Babylonian lunar- eclipse omens: ?VI (S // U: bartu sabu ma'du imaqqut) [AN.TA].LU' ITI.KIN.dINANNA UD. 14.KCAM GAR ba-ar-tum a-na LUGAL ERIN [rapsu] i-ma-quz-ut // BE ITI.KIN. dINANNA UD.14.KAM ba-ar-tum a-na LUGAL Uz ERIN ra-ap-su ?UB-Ut? BM 22696: 38 // BM 86381: 40 If on 14th Uliilu (the moon god) brings about an eclipse: rebellion against the king, numerous people will perish. The parallel apodoses for unexpected observations in early versions of calendrical lunar-eclipse omens far outnumber the single parallel for the fourteenth day. This makes it unlikely that in the extra omens of MS S the signs UD MIN (or jUSt MIN) stand for ur.14.KAM and confirs the</page><page sequence="32">54 F. N. H. AL-RAWI AND A. R. GEORGE correctness of MS U. The reading of UD is obviously some part of iumu "day" and the whole phrase surely signified the same as MS U's ina Id mindtlsu: read perhaps uim la mindtisu "(on) an unpredicted day" or am la adannis'u "(on) the wrong day". The apodoses employed in the omens of unpredictable eclipses in EAE XX are markedly different from the pseudo-historical predictions that otherwise characterize this tablet, which begin ina libbi (ana) GN purussuz nadin "(therein) a prediction is given for GN". As is clearly seen in the passages just quoted, they are typical of the apodoses attached to the lunar-eclipse omens in other first-millennium tablets of EAE and in older versions of the lunar-eclipse omens. The fact that variants of them occur in EAE XVII-XVIII is good evidence of an old pedigree, for this part of the series was founded on Old Babylonian material (Rochberg 2004: 70, 2006: 344-5). Matches with the Emar and Middle Assyrian texts are also suggestive, because these are even more closely related to the Old Babylonian eclipse omens. Accordingly, it seems likely that the omens of unpredictable eclipses in the developed text of EAE XX are a residue of EAE in some earlier version. They certainly call into question Rochberg's assertion that "Tablet 20 is the only eclipse tablet that has no connection to the Old Babylonian material" (2006: 346). The Middle Babylonian recension of EAE represented by MSS S and U is thus highly important for the textual history of EAE, for it is a legacy of the moment that the pseudo-historical apodoses began to displace the traditional Old Babylonian apodoses. The embedded omens of unpredictable eclipses show it all the more clearly to be an intermediary between the second-millennium versions of EAE and the developed version known from first-millennium recensions. In considering the history of EAE, Rochberg gives an account of the Babylonians' own traditions. One such tradition was that EAE was handed down by the god Ea himself, as recorded in a Neo- Assyrian catalogue of literary and scholarly compositions (Lambert 1962: 64-5 I 1; Rochberg 1999: 419, 2004: 181). Another tradition reported that EAE was among the divinatory expertise revealed to the scholarly communities of Nippur, Sippar and Babylon by Enmeduranki, a legendary king of Sippar before the flood, who was educated in these things by the gods of divination, Samas and Adad (Lambert 1967, 1998, Rochberg 1999: 421, 2004: 183). As Rochberg rightly explains, these two traditions "are not making a theological claim ... [but] simply attribute to the text the most ancient origin possible" (Rochberg-Halton 1984: 137). There is other native evidence that is not everywhere acknowledged. The Babylonians knew a third, less mythological, tradition about the early history of EAE, which held that it was one of the many scholarly compositions associated with the name of Esangil-kin-apli. This individual was a prominent scholar of Borsippa contemporary with Adad-apla-iddina, king of Babylon in the eleventh century. The association of EAE with him (observed long ago by Lambert 1962: 69) is reported in the first-millennium catalogue known as the Exorcist's Manual (Geller 2000: 242-54), where the series' ancient title (1. 39: ud-an-den.lil.hd) is included among other compositions under the heading (1. 27) riWt?(sag)rMes iskar(es.gar) dgipati(mag.mag)" sa me-sag-il-kTn(gin)-apli(a) "incipits of series of exorcists' lore of Esangil-kin-apli". Two newly available Late Babylonian manuscripts of the Exorcist's Manual bestow on Esangil-kin-apli an anachronistic patronym and elaborate titulary: "son of Asalluhe-mansum (= Marduk-iddinam?), sage of King Hammurapi of Babylon, descendant of the goddess Lisin, purification priest of Ezida". These abbreviate the longer list of honours appended to his name in first-millennium catalogues of the incipits of Sakikka (Finkel 1988: 148-50) and reaffirm the prestige attached to him as a scholar and authority. These titles are without parallel; clearly he was a scholar of enormous distinction. The editorial activities of Esangil-kin-apli are well known in connection with Sakikka, the series of diagnostic and prognostic omens (Finkel 1988); among the other texts associated with this scholar, listed in 11. 28-42 of the Exorcist's Manual, are many other medical and exorcistic series, but also the terrestrial omen series Summa alu. By the compiler of the Exorcists's Manual, at least, omen texts like EAE and Summa iilu were considered part of the tradition that exorcists had to master. Among the other texts attributed in the Neo-Assyrian catalogue of texts and authors to the god Ea are scholarly and learned compositions like Lugake and Angimdimma. Some have speculated that their attribution to the god Ea really signifies the Borsippan scholar's responsibility for these also (Geller 1990: 212-13). However that may be, there is no reason to mistrust the tradition of the Exorcist's Manual that associates EAE with Esangil-kin-apli. As with</page><page sequence="33">TABLETS FROM THE SIPPAR LIBRARY XIII. ENUMA ANU ELLIL XX 55 Sin-leqi-unninni and the Gilgamesh epic, the role of Esangil-kin-apli in the history of EAE and other compositions like Sakikka and Summa alu was most likely as an influential redactor, remembered to have been the key agent in establishing a text that after him served as the standard version. And as in the case of Gilgames and other compositions with a similar history, the more- or-less stabilized version of EAE that was written down in its various recensions in first-millennium scribal centres can appropriately be called the Standard Babylonian version. The text of EAE XX emerges from this study as an extraordinary collation of heterogeneous material. It consists principally of thirteen calendrical omens from lunar eclipses observed on the fourteenth day, two for the first month and one each for the other eleven (??I-XII), and a section of summary (?XIII). In a curious editorial technique, one Middle Babylonian recension (MS S etc.) interrupts nine of the lunar-eclipse omens by interposing between protasis and apodosis brief calendrical omens of extraneous origin for eclipses on another day (??II-VI, VIII-X and XII). The same recension also appends to the apodosis of the omen for the eleventh month a related but non-calendrical eclipse omen, perhaps as a gloss (?XI). As if to underscore the eclectic nature of the tablet, it and a Middle Assyrian recension (MS Y) introduce the tablet with a schematic passage that sets out in general terms the import of different directions of eclipse for the four nations of the world (?Ia "Intro." in Rochberg's edition). Both recensions also conclude with two omens of the Yoke star that have nothing to do with lunar eclipses (?XIV, above). This extraneous material is absent from most of the other recensions current in the first millennium and was perhaps deliberately excluded as superfluous, but homogeneity was never completely achieved. In all the late recensions, as in the older ones, three of the main lunar-eclipse omens are supplemented with celestial omens concerning the movements of fixed stars (??VII and XII), and the planet Venus and the moon (?VIII). These were no doubt drawn from other parts of EAE but it is odd to find them embedded in EAE XX. It seems that the tablet never quite overcame the disorderliness that its long evolution imposed on it. Appendix. Uruk IV 162 obv. I-rev. 2' Our understanding of the Late Babylonian commentary Uruk IV 162 has benefited greatly from the results of a collation undertaken by Frances Reynolds in 1998. The whole of the collated text of rev. 3'-end has been incorporated in the appropriate places of commentary above. Because the original tablet is at present inaccessible, it seems sensible to present here a transliteration of the balance also, incorporating the results of Reynolds's reading of the original tablet. 1.
