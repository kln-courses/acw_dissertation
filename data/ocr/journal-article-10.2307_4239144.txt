<plain_text><page sequence="1">On Lem on Cosmology and SF. As a cosmologist who also writes sf, I'd like to comment on some of S. Lem's declarations on this subject in SFS #12. He occasionally strains facts for effect (a vice he accuses many sf writers of adopting): it is fairly certain that we don't live in a cyclic universe, for example, and the universe is indeed "closed" in the geometric sense. Also, the silentium universi is not ignored in sf at all (see Gunn's The Listeners), and in any case Lem mistakes the occasional listening for radio signals from other civilizations for a concerted program. Nobody expects instant success from a radio monitoring project, and the few stars eavesdropped on haven't made scientists "feel compelled to attribute ever smaller figures to the psychozoic density in the cosmos, because the accumulating negative results of the 'sky listening' force them to do so." I'm afraid Lem</page><page sequence="2">NOTES, REPORTS, AND CORRESPONDENCE 317 simply isn't doing his homework on this; the largest earnest attempt has listened to only about 200 stars. Similarly, I don't think he should brush off sf writers with the assertion that none have speculated on what Type III civilizations would be like. The whole Type I, n and III scheme (tapping planetary, stellar, or galactic energy resources) comes from Stapledon; Shlovskii, the Soviet astrophysicist, merely formalized it. I do agree with the general tenor of his remakrs-sf does seek cozy universes. They are far easier to make humanly interesting. However, let's remember that even Pascal's horror at the abyss is an anthropomorphic projection. It may not even be so that the universe is ethic- ally neutral, and any assumption made about this possibility is a valid basis for speculation. Then too, collapsing space and time enables one viewpoint character to grasp the scales involved, a technique as old as Wells' Time Machine, so we can't simply frown at these devices as philosophically misleading; they're necessary for fiction to exist. I, too, find much sf about black holes etc. pallid, but Lem's evoking the crushing tides of neutron stars as an example of the antiheroic nature of cosmology and physics rings oddly, considering Niven's "Neutron Star" of a decade ago. Who says there aren't 'human' problems near singularities? And-incidentally-singularities aren't necessarily final; Stephen Hawking is even now working on techniques to extend physics into the time before the origin of the 'big bang.' I find it difficult to follow Lem's assertion that "nothing is today so much held in contempt in SF as reason" when he appears plainly unacquainted with a fair amount of recent sf. Also, he seems to ignore his own fine work which often treats themes central to this discussion. (Maybe they're 'not SF'?) I know it's hard to know everything that has been done-I had al- ready written If the Stars Are Gods and raised issues I thought only skimpily addressed before then, when I stumbled upon Solaris-but I have a scientist's dislike of sweeping statements unbacked by data. (Demonstrating the vacuum is tedious.) Finally, I wish Lem had more experience with the way science is done and the feelings of scientists, before deciding on the proper attitude toward its findings. The doing of science tells us much about its philosophical impact. The astrophysicists and cosmologists I know-the authors of Cosmology Now, for example-don't share one single emotional state regarding their findings. The range of human reactions to the universe is large. I think SF's role in de- picting this and exploring it is invaluable. Showing science as a human enterprise is more im- portant in the long run than describing the more transient fictions of cosmology itself. -Gregory Benford.</page></plain_text>
