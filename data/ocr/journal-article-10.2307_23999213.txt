This town of 60,000 inhab itants still draws approximately one million pilgrims annually from all over India (2). Puri is situated on the seashore of the Bay of Bengal and is the greatest temple town of Orissa, an Indian province lying adjacent in a westerly direction to the province of Bengal. The present temple was constructed in the eleventh century, and the God's name, Jagannath, which translates as 'ruler of the world', spells out well the intent of the founders of the temple, the Ganga, the main dynasty of medieval Orissa. The name was appropriate, because the history of the Gangas shows that they dedicated their kingdom to Jagannath and they only ruled as regents or ministers on behalf of their deity (3). In the context of the overall Indian high tradition, Jagannath is regarded as the ninth incarnation of Vishnu. The sculpture that is actually worshipped in the temple is singular in the Indian setting. It is the only wooden idol which receives veneration, and in addition, this sculpture is, compared to the con ventional blue-stone images of Vishnu, of a particularly crude, quasi (i) Basic field work for this paper was conducted in Puri from 1970 to 1971.

This strange, iconographie artifact has never deterred the Oriyas from lavishing a splendid ritual in honour of their Overlord. In the course of thirteen daily main rituals, the God receives three meals, the main lunch consisting of fifty-six different dishes (the temple kitchen houses 270 hearths and ovens) (4) ; he is dressed and undressed four times a day ; and some 10,000 priests organized into 108 different service-groups attend to his needs and desires. In the classical age these priests subsisted entirely on the daily distri bution of the divine food offerings and were clothed in the used garments, the dhotis, of Jagannath. The temple organization was supervised by high-ranking, land-controlling Brahmins, who resided nearby in the center of landed endowments, bestowed by the Orissan kings to finance the daily routine (5). Although the temple under went many changes it is still an economic unit of actual political interest. Jagannath is still widely considered the biggest single landowner in India, and the temple treasury stores, in net weight alone, some 430 kg of silver, 135 kg of gold, and 22 kg of precious stones (mostly diamonds from the Orissa area), all in the form of hundreds of utensils and jewellery which belong to the God (6). In the following short paper, I do not want to deal so much with a detailed description of all the myriad of economic facts and activities of the temple ; instead I would like to focus on what I shall call the principle of maintenance of the whole structure : a set of interrela tions, which regulate the interaction of the economic, social and ritual activities. These three distinct, yet interrelated, spheres of interest are to be found in the Puri temple's landed endowments, ritual service and distribution of sacred food. Endowments as food. The meaning of Mahaprasada Huge landed endowments are and have been given to Jagannath, not so much in the desire to maintain his priestly establishment, but to procure additional daily meals for him (7). These landed properties are therefore called Amrta-manohi, 'nectar-feeding', (4) L.

The cooked meal is carried into the sanctum, where the God, by looking at it, partakes of it. Through this very act of eating with his eyes, he trans forms the food into 'leftovers', Vichistha, which are regarded by his faithful, with an ambivalent shudder of horror, as his spittle, Juthia. This, the most degrading substance in normal Hindu society, is, in the case of the divine, regional, Overlord, the most precious. This 'spittle-food' is now distributed among the temple priests, the Orissan kings and high aristocrats ; the land-controlling, high-class Brahmins normally find a discreet way of avoiding it (8). In the later middle ages, with the fall of the last regional Hindu dynasty, the subsequent loss of power of its high-class Brahmins and the resultant loosening of restrictions on temple entry, it was precisely this feature of 'sacred spittle' which formed the basis of Jagannath's popularity. The same food that had served to set the monarchy and its aristocrats apart from the rest of the population now served the opposite function of closing all social distances before this Overlord. In the sentimental logic of the Bhakti and Chaitanya ages, this spittle of Jagannath became 'Mahäprasäda' the 'great Grace' (9). As the pilgrims' most popular legend states, 'whoever eats from the food of the Lord shall be blessed ; fools become wise, the sick become healthy, the poor become rich, the blind see again and the crippled walk ; Brahmins and Untouchables should eat the Lord's food together. Thus they both become children of the Lord' (10). So the eating or bestowal of Mahäprasäda shattered caste barriers, and with this direct communion all classes became the equal children of Jagannath. Thus the popularity of Jagannath in the latter medieval age deve loped in proportion to the ease of access to his food. After the sixteenth century a new 'Hall of Pleasure', a gigantic platform for food-offerings, had to be constructed, a kitchen complex was developed, and trade in the dried rice of Jagannath, Nirmalya, spread throughout India. In a distinct reversal of normal Hindu practice, eating from the food of the Lord became more important than seeing him. In the center of the temple an Änanda Bazaar, a 'bazaar of eternal delight', a (8) L. S. S. O'Malley, Puri District Gazetteer (Patna 1929), chapter on Jagan nath. (9) K. C.

Thus, while the volume of divine food distributed became the precise measure of the popularity of Jagannath with the masses, these masses from now on contributed the most important source of his future growth and power : every pilgrim was expected to provide Jagannath with the institution of a new additional meal. In the framework of this still exclusively agrarian, premarket society, this meant that additional acres or a whole village had to be endowed to procure 'as long as sun and moon shall shine' the requisite basic materials. From the sixteenth century onward the quality and quan tity of the landed endowments acquired a new structure ; the exclu sively Orissan regional king was replaced by the nondescript, all-Indian landlord as the typical donor ; endowments came to be scattered all over India (n). The transformation of Northern India under the reign of the Mughals into an economy of essentially monetary rela tions introduced the collection of rents in cash rather than kind (12). This increase in landed property not only ensured the growth and social differentiation of the various priestly services, it made them at the same time necessary. Additional groups of scribes and accountants were needed to keep track of the collections from these various endowments ; new cooks, specializing in the preparation of rice-pudding and sweetmeats had to be installed, and new food carriers, ropemakers, astronomers and calendar-makers, etc., had to be introduced. The growth and differentiation of these service groups can be traced through the sequence of their increasing num bers—the original temple at the end of the the eleventh century had eight priest-groups, at the end of the thirteenth century we find thirty-six groups mentioned, by the middle of the sixteenth century fifty-six, and at the end of the eighteenth century it reached its climax, with the highest holy number available one hundred and eight (13). This process of differentiation was at the same time one of diversi fication. It was not, however, the evolution of a deliberately devised, efficient system of division of labor ; the present diversification represents more the outcome of eight centuries of alliances, intrigues (il) A good example in S.

Normally an already inter nally-arranged system of division of labor was confirmed by the king, through the official recognition and installation of a new service, and the subsequent allotment of new shares of holy food and clothes. At the same time, this overall process served to blur the originally prominent ethnic and sectarian distinctions of these groups and transformed them into small interrelated parts of a highly sophisti cated, self-regulating clockwork of ritual interaction. While it evolved, however, a much more important, although nearly invisible, shift occurred and the whole system of control and power was reorganized in the temple. The rise of the temple priests and the development of mass-pilgrimage Before the age of mass-pilgrimage and mass-commensality, the temple, as already mentioned, was an exclusive and highly esoteric affair supervised by high-ranking land-controlling Brahmins with North Indian backgrounds (14). Although they would not defile their hands by actually serving a God whose mythology, ritual and iconography was entirely of their own making, they had devised and they supervised the most minute details of the ongoing ritual. The sacred routine was a mechanical clockwork of elaborate, relentless consumption on the part of the God, and every failure or absenteeism on the part of the temple priests was mercilessly punished by corporal punishment, meted out by a special institutional police-force. This group of high Brahmins resided in the very center of the traditional and original land endowments of the temple, that is within a ten to twenty miles radius of Puri (15). However, after the fall of the last Hindu dynasty, the helpless God's role was to cater to the new needs of the North Indian landholders. The question arose, who was to control the new, scattered lands endowed to Jagannath by these pilgrims ? This new source of power came to be monopolized by the once landless temple priests, and as it was they who conducted (14) S. N. Rajguru, The Brahmanas and the Landgrants (Bhuvaneshwar 1972), O.R.P. mimeo. (15) Earliest village grants, published in A. K.

Jagannath himself could not reasonably be expected to supervise all his petty land-holdings in person. Thus, what on the one hand worked against the reputation of these temple-priests, that is, their defiling contacts with pilgrims of questionable social background, became on the other their new road to power. From a group of disreputable temple servants, these Deolipandas rose to become a powerful class of betel-chewing, opium smoking, quasi-landlords in the name of Jagannath. The impover ished, but prudish high-class Brahmins remained helpless, watch ing, bystanders and were sometimes even forced by sheer poverty to find employment in the business of their former temple servants. There they wrote or edited sacred texts, the Mahätmyas, which described the splendors of Jagannath and the need to see him in person (16). The actual temple service was normally conducted by the second-born sons of the temple priests or farmed out to some dis tant relative, while their share of holy food and cloth was sold to pil grims ; they concentrated entirely in the cultivation of their scattered land-holdings, which they visited to collect their rents, and to pro pagate, organize, and conduct new pilgrimages to Puri. Thus, these Pandas transformed themselves into the famous 'pilgrim hunters' and became the chief agents for the ever-increasing flow of pilgrims and land endowments. The rents from the latter did not normally profit Jagannath : it was very seldom that their equivalent value in meals was served, or presented over a long period of time, although 'sun and moon' still shone on the head of his betel-chewing priestly manager. The 'management' of their pilgrim-clienteles now led them to the logical corollary of their landed estates—the cultivation of their so called 'pilgrim-estates'. Whenever they had extracted promises of land endowments from their more-often-than-not bankrupt pilgrims, the gifts were entered into yearly registers, together with the date, plus some sort of signature. The pilgrim's name and family clan were recorded in another register, the village register, and when ever a distant relative in some future generation came to pay the tra ditional homage to Jagannath in Puri, the demonstration of these registers constituted irrefutable proof that this pilgrim 'belonged' (i6) U. Schneider, Der Holzgott und die Brahmanen, Testausgabe und Inter pretation des Purushottama Mahatmya, O.R.P. mimeo 1973. 49</page><page sequence="7">JAKOB ROSEL to this priest, his customary family ' Yajamäna-panda' ; and the initial endowment set the standard against which his generosity was measured. In this way, by the end of the eighteenth century the whole of India had been parcelled out into village and district registers, through which these 'pilgrim-farmers' kept track of their clientele ; at the same time these registers constituted chips of predictable success in the yearly roulette-game of harvesting new endowments or gifts. As this potential spending power for Jagannath was shared out between the several hundred priestly families in Puri, it is not surprising that by the nineteenth century we find an option-exchange type of trade practice : district and yearly registers could be bought and sold, and were given as dowry. Often they were traded in order to unify and concentrate a person's holdings in certain provinces, thereby minimizing travel expenses and optimizing the recruitment of new pilgrims. Sometimes whole new districts were bought because a good season or a new monastic influence promised an increase in the number of pilgrims to Puri. It is, ironically enough, in the age of British-built steamships and railroads that this 'Weberian', 'innerwordly urge' for universal quantification and predictability reached its climax (17). Distances shrank to the price of a railway ticket, and the whole of India became a ready market for the pilgrimage organizers. For the first time Jagannath became accessible to the millions of landless laborers and village craftsmen who heretofore had been unable to afford long term pilgrimages. At the same time, the direct, round-trip pilgri mage relieved the priests of the tiresome burden of sharing their clientele's spending power with other shrines lying along the pil grims' route. But meanwhile the ominous spectre of the shifting ratio of people to land endangered the future greatness of the Lord's servants. From the 1870s onward land prices began to rise in alarming fashion : cash-crop markets and rising population densities had brought all land under cultivation (18). Thus the new pilgrims of the railroad age were pilgrims who either could not, or would not, endow land. The temple economy reacted to this serious challenge with impeccable elegance. No longer was the pilgrim expected to endow land for new meals ; in stead he was expected to present Jagannath with a sum of money, (17) W. W. Hunter, The Imperial Gazetteer of India (Oxford 1907), 4 vols : III, pp. 385-386. (18) S. L. Maddox, Final report on the survey and settlement of the Province of Orissa, 1890-1900 (Ranchi 1920) ; K.

A price-list for subscribers was drawn up by the priest, with a plain rice dish beginning at 5,000 rupees, ranging upward to 250,000 rupees for a seer of Makhan Mishri, a one-kilo dish of butter-rice with raisins dipped in coconut oil and sweetened with sugar balls. This new arrangement provided the priests and the temple with ready cash, which enabled them to participate in the emerging colonial money economy. Thus, the concept of providing for the God and a sacred routine focusing on conspicuous consumption has well survived the divers historical and economic challenges of the last nine centuries. But what was the nature of the benefits that the different classes of donors received, beside the rather vague honour of becoming kinsmen of Vishnu ? Ritual interaction During the classical Hindu phase of the temple, the food-offerings served to ensure the collective prosperity of the kingdom ; access to the God and his food was a privilege, and the ritual scope univer sal ; the kingdom as a whole, with all its endless hierarchies of mutual distinctions was supposed to endure and to prosper as a result of the pleasure of its Overlord. With the advent of mass pilgrimage the temple is transformed into a Bazaar, a religious vending machine, in which the age-old hopes and desires of Indian peasant society can be realized in exact proportion to a price. Many (and male) children, health, good harvests, the discovery of hidden treasure are the rewards which the legends universally promise. During this period the temple compound changes into a ritual playground, in which the pilgrims rediscover the sacred objects of their village religion in amalgamated and only slightly sublimated form (19). These objects of worship are the sacred tree, the well or water-reservoir, rock boul ders, the bathing ghat, hills, seashores and ant-hills. All these sites are not so much distinct facts or objects of worship ; they act as catalysts for a mimetic experience on the part of the pilgrims. Hills are to be perambulated, water drunk ; streams and bathing ghats used to bathe oneself, and the branches of sacred trees to fasten parts of one's jewelry or pieces of pottery (20). Thus these archaic models (19) For a good description, see L. A. Babb, The Divine Hierarchy. Popular Hinduism in Central India (New York 1975), pp. 69-102. (20) An Old Brahminical Guidebook for Pilgrims, probably dating from the four</page><page sequence="9">JAKOB ROSEL of village religion precipitate a series of experiences and impres sions which transform the pilgrim into a different person, ready to observe, but never to touch, the Jagannath. His ritual and sensual activities, a sequence of holy rites entirely predetermined by the temple compound's architecture and iconography, and supervised by the pilgrim's traditional priest, transform and change his state of mind. So the worship is not conducted in a framework of super abundant verbalization ; not communication, but communion in a very direct and non-symbolic way constitutes the content of a temple visit. Thus the truth of the temple's ritual entirely subsists on what the pilgrim's beliefs are, and in Puri he believes in what he shares— the used food, the used bathing water and the used flowers of the God. These objects are part of an uncomplicated and sensual communion based on pleasure. The Mandora flowers of the temple's three flower gardens are said to excel in color, the temple food is really excellent. Therefore the mood in the temple resembles more the gaity of a village mêla, a village fair, than the sombre atmosphere of a Shiva shrine or the plain boredom of a protestant church. But despite all these changes, the main ritual of the classical Hindu period still persisted. There were never any attempts to reconcile its premises with popular and regional beliefs. A very different ritual logic from that just portrayed appears if we look into the sanctum, at the main ritual, during which Jagannath is supposed to enjoy his fifty-six-course luncheon. There, out of the sight— the ritual is performed behind closed doors—and out of the grasp— the ritual is performed in sanscrit—of the ordinary pilgrim, a complete logical turnover takes place. No longer is the pilgrim guest of the God, instead the God is treated as a Guest of high-class Brahmins (21). The main ritualist, the Pujapanda, in a standardized series of gestures and sacred formulas, destroys himself and then begins to create out of his own sacred void the 'idea' of a divine body. After under going an interrelated series of ever-increasing materializations, the essence of a newborn and therefore absolute pure God is awakened to life and transmitted into the formerly lifeless sculpture of the God. Finally, seated in the crude wooden sculpture, the God is greeted as a tired, dusty, though high-ranking stranger, who may enjoy teenth century, gives a detailed enumeration.

A welcome aperitif (a sweet drink in fact, madhu parka) is offered, he is sacrificially sprinkled with water, his feet are washed, and a towel to clean his face is handed over. Then the customary sodaça-upachâra, the sixteen kinds of offerings which are due to a high-ranking guest, are made. Finally three sacrifices of Vedic origin are performed, in which the actual offering of food, Naivedyam, plays the most insignificant role. Afterwards the essence of the God is withdrawn from the statue, sniffed in through the right nostril of the priest, and with the help of yogic practices, sacrificially burned in his spinal cord. So, while the pilgrims eagerly throng the hall of audience to see their regional Overlord, the Lord has already departed. What is shown to them after the customary siesta hour is, according to the explicit statement of the sanskrit manual, a lifeless idol. That such a travesty should represent the most central mystery of the cult is easily understood : nothing is purer than the content of a mystery. It is even beyond the touch of comprehension, which constant threat the ritual must overcome, as it must reconcile the contradiction between divine purity and conspicuous consumption, between the need for a divine image of a society based on distances and untouchability and the need to display that very same image. But this secret ritual of dominance disguised as hospitality serves yet another purpose. It reaffirms the true causality which led to the formation of this Hindu kingdom. That is, not the God, who, owning and reigning over this kingdom, dispenses favors to the king and Brahmins, and who in turn is honored by them with due gifts ; but the sacred and sacrificial knowledge of Brahmins, which inspired the sequence of constitutional sacrifices and rituals from which the construction and growth of temples, idols, palaces and institutions resulted. What in terms of the ritual is a gigantic puppet-play, which the pilgrims may enjoy only subconsciously, enshrines at the same time the Empire's innermost secret. So while the effectivity of Jagannath for the Hindu monarchy, its aristocrats and the latter-day pilgrims was derived from the regional, territorial, and so to speak vernacular identity and reality of the God, this central ritual reconciled their interpretation with the Brahminical 'great Tradition' and its world transcending and encompassing Vishnu. 53</page><page sequence="11">JAKOB RÖSEL The principle of maintenance What is the specific connection we find between the economic, social and ritual activities of the temple, which I earlier called 'the principle of maintenance' ? In my opinion these three spheres are interrelated, and their raison d'être is the banal, superficial and to us subversive, search for pleasure. The number of landed endow ments is the measure of the services which can be financed or procured, and it is these services, mainly in the form of food, that constitute divine pleasure ; it is in exact proportion to this divine pleasure or food that worshippers receive 'Great Grace'. Thus they are blessed with children, harvests and prosperity, which in turn will yield more endowments, more food, more pleasure. The terminological sequence of Amritamanohini, Seva, Bhoga and Mahäprasäda constitutes there fore a precise description the institution gives of itself and we do not need to look elsewhere to superimpose more idealizing, metaphorical or symbolic descriptions. As Jagannath acts as Lord of Orissa we do not need to see him as a symbol of power, we better admire him in the practice of power. Thus we can say that this divine kingdom maintained itself with the help of a sacred food-chain, or to use a more modern and fancy expression, it recycled divine pleasure. It was within this matrix of nectar-feeding lands, service, pleasure and grace, that the power of the God and his township increased and decreased, every loss in one part of the sequence immediately translating itself into the other parts. Along this cycle, the God, his town, and domain reacted against the different historical challenges of the last nine centuries, and, as we have seen, he reacted remarkably well. To use the waxing and waning of this sacred food cycle as a 'leitmotiv' for the history of Orissa is beyond the scope of this small paper ; instead, having outlined how the complexities of the temple implicate and assume the existence of this simple and banal model, let us try to reduce the latter still further, by analyzing the basic anthropomorphic image which it in turn assumes of the God. The God as a mighty landlord That assumption, which is the rationale of and the justification for the whole food-chain, stems from a special conception of the 54</page><page sequence="12">THE ECONOMY OF AN INDIAN TEMPLE God—that of the mighty territorial landlord with both sensual and mundane needs and pleasures. Banal and unremarkable as such a model may appear to us, who have the benefit of not only monotheist, but secular hindsight ; it took a millennium in Orissa before it could replace older and more archaic conceptions of, or better, projections on, the 'true nature' of Gods. All great predecessors of Jagannath were of Shiva or Shakti origin—this means in the Orissan regional context that these Gods were venerated in the form of mostly uncut rocks and boulders. They were seen more as magical forces than as mythological, reproducible forms. As such they attacked peasants in the form of fever or disease, and rode lions and jackals by entering their bodies (22). Rituals, even those conducted in the major shrines, were often of an exorcistic nature and conducted in utter seclusion and esoteric settings. Food offerings needed metaphorical explana tions, were restricted in scale, and seldom accepted by the wor shippers (23). From the eleventh century onward, this religion of fear was grad ually replaced by a cult of gift-offering, centered on the new state deity of Jagannath. This new conception of the God has several features, which predetermined the structure of the whole temple. In the first instance the establishment of the 'big landlord' figure eliminates an element of fear : the power of the new God is measured by the numbers he attracts, not those he repels. This complete turn about is possible because his new image has entered the stage of social interaction. He can be honoured according to the rules of the social game, which, not only in the Orissan context, were loyalty, submission and spending. Having entered the social realm, the God becomes predictable, a prognostic fact. Philosophical thought and exorcistic superstitions alike can be reduced to the level of such questions as, should the lord be served sweetmeats twice a day, or, is garlic admissable to the divine palate ? The cognitive outlook likewise can grasp and domesticate the essence of the God in fixed architectural, mythological and icono graphie detail. Thus art becomes the important schoolteacher in the process of the God's socialization ; thus bloodthirsty hill-goddesses are educated to become well-behaved, vegetarian temple statues. Interrelations between God and worshipper can therefore be translated from magical and mechanic reciprocity into the more indistinct, (22) B. J. M. Das, Note on the Gram Devati or Tutelary village deity of Orissa, Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, LXXII (1903) 2, 81-85. (23) H. Brunner, De la consommation du Nirmalya de Shiva, Journal Asiatique, CCLVII (1969), 214-263. 55</page><page sequence="13">JAKOB ROSEL deferred, but harmless social reciprocity (24) : that of a patron-clien tele relationship. Worshippers are clients, kinsmen, who, by partak ing of the God's food and showering him with gifts and bribes will be compensated in due course (25). But the image of the 'big landlord' is the same as that of the 'big man' : one of ever-growing demands and desires. There is nothing improper in the priesthood's constant demands for new meals, new dhotis, incense, and dancing women, to perfect and embellish the daily routine. Keeping up with the divine Joneses must also be of concern to the king, who acts as regent. Thus the king neither can, nor has to, resist the growth of the sacred metro polis. In that way the basic image provides its own rationale and urge for unlimited growth, a growth which always finds its upper limit and which is held in check by the actual resources of the king dom. The God's life-style is thus not indicative or symbolic of the state of the nation ; it is the actual state of the nation's prosperity, it is the consummation of power in its most direct form of consump tion. Not only can the pattern of conspicuous consumption grow, but at the same time the territorial extension of the kingdom can expand as well, without presenting any sectarian or religious difficulties. The shaiva and shakti deities were regarded as being or as represent ing their territories—they were as immortal as their territorial body substance was ; thus neither their territories nor they themselves could shrink, expand or be destroyed. For Jagannath this older notion of representing territoriality now changed into the more flexible rationale of possession and rule. Although Jagannath can now, and does, in theory, rule over a vast newly-conquered territory, he pays for this potential of infinite conquest with the spectre of possible defeat, which in the case of image-worship and in the hands of Muslim iconoclasts must lead to his own bodily destruction : for example in 1360 A.D. Muslim conquistadors dragged him out of his temple and burned him to ashes (26). The sheer effort of organizing the tiresome task of completing the daily schedule of divine pleasure calls for an otherwise unknown degree of scope and complexity in social interaction : 108 different groups, (24) H. D. Evers, Monks, Priests and Peasants (Leiden 1972), p. 68. (25) W. S. Brooke, Note on the custom of Maha-prasad in the Sambalpur District, Indian Antiquary, VII (1878), 113-115.

Besides being the biggest economic unit of the kingdom, the temple becomes at the same time the greatest social integrated unit—this despite the fact that this challenge of social interaction is unprecedented, and that the basic ideals of Orissan society value distance over interaction, self-sufficiency and self-containment of small economic units over widespread division of labor and the consequent economics of scale. Again in this context the central image not only requires the inte grated interaction of all those groups, at the same time it also guaran tees it : holy food, daily consumed, eliminates all the sectarian and ethnic differences between priest-groups, because it constitutes their only available daily subsistence ; furthermore holy food only becomes holy through this daily ritual interaction. So the image of Jagannath initiates a model for widespread, complex interaction, while it upholds at the same time the basic tenet of the notion of purity. As the palace administration is organized to be a precise copy of the temple, and many central functions are overlapping, the Jagannath temple enabled the Orissan kingdom to evolve a sacred administration complex diversified enough to rule over a vastly expanded territory. The fact that the daily subsistence of many of these administrators was distributed via the central focus of the God's image centered the groups around Jagannath and prevented a state of segmentary rule by the headmen. As a result, deceit, distrust, strikes and dharna 'sit-ins', were avoided. Thus we could say that the anthropomorphic image of the God as a mighty landlord and Overlord allows for definite advantages in the domain of more efficient ritual, social and political integration and expansion. But this image, although indispensable, is not the crucial precondition to the maintenance principle of the food chain. That factor is the simple act of eating that is assumed by the food chain, an activity that in its turn presupposes the anthropomorphic image of the God. Let us now see if we can derive from this single iconographie feature and precondition some traits and constraints which predetermine and shape something like an 'economy of incor poration'. An economy of incorporation Royal repentance, pilgrims' promises, priestly consolation and humble submission and obedience, every possible sphere of interac tion with the God can be materialized and expressed in terms of 57</page><page sequence="15">JAKOB ROSEL food (27). Food becomes the social coin of ritual interaction. The spatial arrangement of the Puri district, the architecture of the entire temple compound, the ritual itself, all have one basic purpose, that is, to procure food for the daily consumption of the God. The struc ture of the economy is geared towards one goal, and this goal is 'incorporation' in the original sense of the word. Thus in this economy which values incorporation before circulation, consumption before investment, there should be no place for the notion of money, with its unsavory associations of unpredictable movement, unrestricted contact, and careless interchange in foreign places between still more foreign people. But money exists, and the way it is used within the framework of the temple economy again helps to show that the central idea is the act of incorporation : gold that is given to the temple treasury is called pindika, 'small riceballs', in an analogy to the rice balls offered during ancestor-worship ; the smallest connotation for the value of copper in Orissa is 'one rice-grain', for gold, one Ganja, 'Hashish-seed'. Although no coins, in the sense of fixed standards for weights and quality of metal, existed in Orissa, we still find the existence of temple money. Goldsmiths transformed thin sheets of silver or gold into punch-marked sacred coins by stamping the images of various Hindu Gods, or the symbols of the pilgrims' desires, children or grain, on to them. These coins were used by the pilgrims to pay for, or better, to give thanks for, services (28). Later in Puri, during great festivals, they were thrown and showered over the statues of Gods ; heaped on great metal trays, they were carried away and hoarded in the treasury until they were melted into new statues. Thus coins were labelled and computed as a surrogate for food, drained off the market, hoarded as treasure and finally incorporated by the God into his own statue. Coins counted only when they could no longer be counted. In the framework of the temple, and for the believer, this incorporation is complete, legitimate, of sensual and direct meaning, and unavoidable. This image of power as destruc tion through consumption, and as hoarding through incorporation was a seemingly irresistible persuasion in this society. Seen therefore from the logic of the ritual and with the eye of the believer, which we have up until now made our own viewpoint, the (27) A good example of this fact on the level of the 'Little Tradition', L.

This process, year after year, not only led to the total decline of all other shrines and to a situation in which some 40 % of all taxable land was endowed to Jagannath, it also led to the total sanctifica tion of a province which Brahminical manuals still regarded as defiled and disreputable as late as the thirteenth century (29). What is of still greater interest is that this very same process led to an era of widespread ritual and Brahminical colonization, with new Jagannath monasteries constructed and new land brought under cultivation. But the main point is that this process of unparalleled expansion and sacred investment, via the distribution of food, at no point could be perceived as such, the perspective and logic of perception being tainted by the prevalence of divine consumption and incorporation. Thus it would be unfair to rationalize this economic undertaking using the commonsense terminology and concepts of our so-called real world. This is not a sacred, pre-industrial, agrarian, re-investive, expanding and innovative economy ; instead it is the realm of the Lord of the world, who is fond of eating, hoarding jewels, and sharing his leftovers.
