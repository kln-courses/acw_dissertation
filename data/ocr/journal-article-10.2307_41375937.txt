<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS Independent super-organism GAIA: THE PRACTICAL SCIENCE OF PLANETARY MEDICINE by James Lovelock Gaia Books, 192 pages, /16.99 BETWEEN TWO WORLDS: SCIENCE, THE ENVIRONMENTAL MOVEMENT AND POLICY CHOICE by Lynton Keith Caldwell Cambridge University Press, 224 pages, Â£12.95 paperback Professor Caldwell's book, Between Two Worlds , is a synthesis of work over the last quarter of a century in examining human beings' relationship with the planet. It is interesting for its thesis that this era represents a discontinuity and valuable for its comprehensive review of the develop- ment of thinking in this area. Unfortunately, its style and language mean it is unlikely to be accessible to the wide range of people who would benefit from its insights. In contrast, Jim Lovelock's latest Gaia book is directed to a popular readership. It is full of coloured illustrations and diagrams. These deliberately make the points in simple terms for the non-scientist. There are, however, problems with this approach. I trained as a chemist, like the author, and feel uncomfortable with several explanations, for example that the chloride ion is a spherical atom. The irritation with these slightly inaccurate over simplifications made the whole book less convincing. Many organisations, companies, societies, clubs, even court cases can be described as taking on a life of their own. They seem to go beyond the control of the individuals involved. There seems nothing particularly unusual in thinking of the earth in this way. I can do no better than quote from James Lovelock's own preface: 'as you read this book keep in mind that Gaia is as yet unproven and use it and the concept of planetary medicine as a way of seeing earth's problems differently.' In these terms the book must be useful in helping us to think about the finite world in which we live. In arguing that the planet as an eco-system can be thought of as a living organism, or super-organism, it seems inconsistent to argue that viruses are somehow below life. Even if viruses are not alive, in some strict sense they are very much part of life. If Gaia exists as some super-organism, then they are a part of her as well. To some extent these are minor points of criticism. There is a tendency when describing evolutionary processes to slip into a form of language which makes it appear that evolutionary change was the result of some deliberate effort or desire on the part of the species. There is of course no evidence for this and the point is admirably made by David Attenborough in the introduction to his book Life on Earth. Much of the book uses the language of this anthropomorphic approach: ' . . a single evolutionary process in which life has, quite literally, fashioned the environment to suit itself.' This 636 sits awkwardly with the notion that the other planets, Mars and Venus, may have exhibited conditions for the develop- ment of life at some stage in pre-history that were snuffed out by the loss of hydrogen from their atmospheres. It is in contrast to the closing sentence of the book: '. . . the rest of creation will, as part of Gaia, unconsciously move the Earth itself into a new state I found this an annoying feature of the book. It is revolutionary enough to suggest that the earth is an organism, or at least can be thought of as such. The hypothesis is perhaps made more unpalatable by the notion that because of its status as a super-organism the earth was able to influence its development. Whether the hypothesis that the world is some super-organism is right or wrong as a way of thinking, it is a valuable contribution. However, if the book had been rewritten with the language of results rather than intentions then it might have been more powerful and as a way of thinking it might have shown us greater insights. For all the images of planetary medicines and physiology the book does not leave any clear directions, beyond empiricism, for healing the world of its ills. It simply leaves us with the warning that if we tamper with the unknown we are likely to be in for a surprise and probably an unpleasant surprise. The surprise suggested, although we shall not survive to see it, is that the life on earth can survive without humans and indeed despite humans. If this is so, then why does James Lovelock suggest that we have a role as stewards of the earth? The real message is surely one of enlightened self interest. Because we have intelligence, we are able to make predictions. We, unlike most life forms, are indeed able to act anthropomorphically. We should do so, not for the world's preservation, but for our own preservation, because the thesis of the book is the world may be able to get along without us.
