<plain_text><page sequence="1">Is Nature Rational? BY RALPH B. WINN OST words are like small vessels with constantly changing contents. Life does not wait for ad- justments in language, but seeks to give an immediate solution to its most imperative needs and interests. It builds up and sometimes de- stroys. It is a panorama in flux. Consequently, there comes every once in a while a moment when traditional meanings become so overgrown with the moss of ages that they stand as a handicap for clear thinking. Then it is advisable not to continue studies along customary lines, but rather to make a determined effort toward an analysis of basic concepts in the Cartesian fashion-by purging our minds of all the accumulated presuppositions, by undertaking a re-examina- tion of meanings, by unlearning and re-learning. Among the terms which have reached this stage of obsolescence today is speculative "idealism". Its connotation has become so vague that some scholars, R. B. Haldane among them, urge us to discard it altogether, while others, with J. B. Pratt, beg somebody to explain what idealism really means. Anyway, in S. Rad- hakrishnan's phrase,' "the stage seems to be set for a fresh statement". The controversy between the idealists and the materialists is so old and persistent that any attempt to end it once and for all should appear as hopeless. Time and again individual thinkers claimed to have dealt a decisive blow one way or another. But 1 An Idealist View of Life, 17. 285</page><page sequence="2">286 Is Nature Rational? the problem has apparently a thousand lives, because no sooner do the idealists pronounce materialism dead than their opponents arise in a new form, under another name, in connection with some unforeseen issue. And no sooner do the materialists gain confidence and decry idealism as superstition than their adver- saries knock at the back door. Thus, the controversy goes on unabated. That the two schools or attitudes are, in some sense, opposite is demonstrated by their enduring antagonism. What, then, is their fundamental distinction? It has been asserted that, whereas materialism seeks to account for all phenomena in terms of matter and motion, idealism tries to explain reality in terms of the mind or ideas. According to A. Hoernle's testi- mony,2 "mind, in some sense, is the hero of every idealistic story". In its most extreme form, idealism flatly denies the independent existence of material bodies. The I8th century philosophers, following Berkeley, strove valiantly to interpret reality as deriva- tive from sensory and reflective experience. Their efforts were, however, judging by the results, unsuccessful if not futile. After Kant, himself a "critical" idealist, refused to commit himself and assumed an agnostic position as regards the things-in-themselves, radical subjectivism was practically abandoned. Nowadays, you will not find, indeed, three noted thinkers who continue faithfully in the footsteps of the good bishop of Cloyne. As C. L. Barrett said in the name of modern philosophers,3 many genuine idealists believe that the reliance on the Berkeleian principles is mistaken. "The fact is that a large (he should have said: an overwhelming) percentage of idealists do not and never have relied upon the principle of esse est percipi, and that to these idealists, if not to all (!), it does not constitute an intrinsic part of idealism". The fundamental difficulty of subjective idealism-to account for the multiplicity of minds and thus to escape the absurdity of solipsism-has never been satisfactorily overcome. A rather 2 Idealism as a Philosophy, 80. 3 "Is Idealism Realism?", 7ournal of Philosophy, 1933. The parenthetical remarks are mine.</page><page sequence="3">R. B. Winn 287 vigorous attempt, no doubt, was made by Hegel and some of his successors to rescue idealism from its subjectivist faults. He postulated that the minds function under the guidance of the Absolute Idea-or, more exactly, that their operations represent minute steps in its development-and thAs reduced men's reason- ing to what may be appropriately designated as "spiritual mechanism", in which freedom of will, as ordinarily understood, plays a subordinate and hardly intelligible r61e, much to the detriment of the idealistic attack on materialism. At the same time, Hegel found it necessary to take a step away from Berkeley and Kant back to Plato and Aristotle and to admit that the external objects are no mere appearances, that they do not depend on being perceived. It was in objects, rather than in personal minds, that he found reason in operation. This objec- tive idealism was, furthermore, modernized by being blended with the notion of dynamic purpose, in the form of the dialectics of Spirit; in brief, it taught that both minds and things participate in the realization of a cosmic Ideal. In Hegel's vision, the world became a colossal thought process moving irresistibly towards the fulfillment of the logical order. This unusual doctrine, powerfully presented in Hegel's detailed elaboration, nevertheless failed to satisfy philosophers trained in respect for science. For "objective idealism", despite its claims to the contrary, was never truly objective. Its subjectivism was merely spread all over the cosmic scene, yet the underlying worldview remained essentially, as it must remain in all idealism, a spiritualist interpretation of nature. Instead of working within many subjects, Spirit, as one Absolute Idea, was assumed to animate everything in reality. But, pluralistic or monistic, ideal- ism persisted in interpreting the world in terms of the mind. In discarding subjectivism-reluctantly, no doubt-our contem- porary idealists tacitly confess their inability to comprehend the cosmos as determined solely by mental states, human or divine. If, then, neither Berkeleian subjectivism nor Hegelian spiritual- ism finds much favor with the 20-th century thinkers, what else can idealism mean? Nevertheless, the old tradition, rich in genuine insights and</page><page sequence="4">288 Is Nature Rational? also in respectability, will not surrender without further struggle. The newer trend is to pass lightly over the implication of spiritual- ism and to state emphatically that the world is, above all, intel- ligible and orderly; that it is built around the high significance of values; and that it is thoroughly teleological. Thus, ideal-ism tends to replace idea-lism. Now, this view is distinctly a retreat from the older position of uncompromising hostility toward materialism, the more so that materialism, in its scientific out- look, itself asserts that things are determined by strict laws discovered in the progress of knowledge; that values play an important role in it, particularly in human history; and even that reality manifests meaning and growth. Does this imply that idealism is ready to capitulate and prepare itself for a com- promise with some milder form of materialism, say, with realism or naturalism? This seems at least to be the implication of such theories as emergent evolution (S. Alexander, C. L. Morgan, etc.) or cosmic evolution (J. E. Boodin). Whatever novel form or wording idealism might acquire, one thing cannot be disputed and should be brought clearly to the foreground of discussion. It is, namely, that, beneath all the agelong controversies between the two philosophic schools, there lies a question of paramount significance: Is nature rational? This question is entailed, for instance, in the following frank words of Professor C. L. Barrett: "When the idealist says that the universe is Mind, we presume that everyone who possesses any acquaintance with the history of philosophy knows he does not mean that the universe is a conscious thinking being like ourselves. He does mean that it is an intelligible universe, whose systematic structure is no mere mechanism, but expression of the principles of rational order and value which are also the constitutive principles of intelligent organization of our own experience". In the question "Is nature rational?" the issue does not lie, of course, in the word "nature," by which we all understand the interdependent totality of beings, things, relations, actions, changes. There is hardly much room for disagreement on this point. The whole issue resides in the meaning of the word</page><page sequence="5">R. B. Winn 289 "rational"-for, while the materialists confine the term to human experience alone, the idealists apply it to the universe. In fact, the concept of rationality is the alpha and omega of every idealist teaching. Consequently, the following argument will be devoted exclusively to a thorough analysis of rationality. What has made people believe that the external world is, in some sense, rational? As mental functions have never been observed in inorganic matter, the origin of the assumption is to be looked for in speculation. In this instance, it has been deter- mined, as I am going to show, by the anthropomorphic tendency of human thought, two elements of which are worth pointing out, one an outgrowth of everyday experience, the other a distinctive product of philosophy. Take an ordinary field flower. Its structure is truly a master- piece of creative forces of nature. Every detail seems to have been carefully planned for growth from one stage to another. Its color and odor are well designed to attract insects who, quite involuntarily, carry the pollen to fertilize a similar plant. There is considerable waste in the process, of course, but flowers are well prepared for it. As soon as fertilization is accomplished and seeds are ripe, the function of life has been fulfilled for one season. And when one compares this splendid arrangement with the clumsy work of men, one is likely to conclude that, no matter how wise men might become, they shall never surpass nature in wisdom, except by learning from it. No wonder, people are apt to perceive the hand of God in things like field flowers, but not in things like war, corpses, mud, or stench. Yet there is no need to invoke the power of a superior Genius to explain a few selected phenomena appealing to us because of their beauty or complexity. They are no more and no less wonderful than anything else, except in comparison to human creations and in regard to man's interests and tastes. No real phenomenon requires, for its explanation, a supernatural interference, but can be accounted for in terms of natural forces and laws. And indeed, Darwin and other biologists have demonstrated that the structure and function of plants and animals is merely a result of slow selection and adaptation to conditions of earthly</page><page sequence="6">290 Is Nature Rational? life. Instead of mystical rationality, the scientist finds simply organic adjustment. The second form of anthropomorphism responsible for the idealist interpretation of nature is found in philosophy itself. Humanity is old, but it did not occur even to the wisest of men that it is possible to create a systematic discipline helping them master nature, until the sages of Greece grasped the implica- tions of abstract reflection. At first, they were encouraged in their speculations by the joy of thinking and by the sense of growing power. It was only in the age of Parmenides, Anaxa- goras, Socrates, and Democritus that they began to appreciate the superiority of reason over the senses. It was left, however, to Plato to formulate the basic principles of idealism. The work of his predecessors and, particularly, of Socrates, his teacher, convinced him that, contrary to the opinion of the ignorant, logical thought is the way of understanding. In Crito, he put this conclusion in Socrates' mouth, saying: "I am and always have been one of those natures who must be guided by reason, whatever the reason may be which upon reflection appears to me to be the best". What, then, is the function of reason? The senses give us merely data passing with the moment. As such, they teach us nothing, because transient phenomena and experi- ences never return. Only if we catch the imperishable in them, can we learn from them. This imperishable something, which cannot be seen or heard, but can be thought of, constitutes every- thing that is of value in knowledge and that gives man the power which, acquired bit by bit, enables him to mold the environment. Through the process of abstraction from transient data of obser- vation, man is enabled to comprehend concepts conveying the meaning of Reality in its various interconnected phases. These concepts are, however, no mere artifacts of human imagination. They are derived from, and apply to, nature herself. Insofar as all enduring knowledge of nature is revealed through concepts, they must function in, and dominate in some sense, everything that happens. These elements of permanence, both in the external world and in the mind, were called Ideas. Once thor- oughly grasped, thought Plato, the Ideas had to be recognized</page><page sequence="7">R. B. Winn 291 not only as superior in value to passing images of observation, but also more real. For the transient data of the senses exist only for a moment and then are no longer; but the Ideas, though seemingly arising and perishing in their particular manifesta- tions, nevertheless recur and thus demonstrate their lasting reality. Consequently, things of sensory perception are like shadows of true reality, that of eternal Ideas. It cannot be denied that Plato's insights into the mind and nature were lofty and magnificent. And yet centuries of philo- sophic and scientific experience put at the disposal of the modern thinker advantages that permit him an adequate evaluation and criticism of one of the greatest systems of thought. Without detracting anything from the historical contributions of Plato, we can say that his beliefs are no longer acceptable in their original form. We acknowledge willingly, of course, that the laws of nature can be grasped only by the mind assisted by the senses. We concede also that these laws, as understood by men, are invisible and inaudible and that they can be discovered only through generalization and abstraction from phenomena. We have learned, however, that thoughts have a much closer con- nection with the body than Plato could have ever suspected. We no longer contend that they proceed from that entity in- habiting the organism, which was traditionally called "the soul". We are inclined, in fact, to doubt its very existence. Instead, we have discovered the constant dependence of thoughts and emotions on the brain, the function of which is to adjust one's behavior to whatever conditions are presented by one's environ- ment. Even the most profound reasoning is recognized today as a way of solving problems, as adaptation. The brain itself is, in its biological and psychological aspects, nothing other than an organ of adjustment. Thus, we are confronted with the alternative questions: Is nature rational? Is reason natural? At a first glance, the alternative is artificial or false, because, as one might maintain, both questions admit of affirmative answers. But this is not what I mean. What I do mean is that, without denying the more or less permanent nature of scientific laws, it is possible</page><page sequence="8">292 Is Nature Rational? to regard them as possessing the characteristics of reason even apart from the human knowledge of them-which is an idealist's view. Or else it is possible to interpret human reason as a biological tool shaped by nature in the course of ages and, in its turn, discovering in speculation those very laws which had created it-which is a materialist's contention. The idealist insists on reading the mind into nature, as follows: "Could nature produce something fundamentally alien to herself? Could she put into her products what she herself in no measure or degree possessed? If nature could produce minds, must it not be because she possessed those characteristics with which she endowed them? Or, to speak less metaphorically, if human minds are actually parts of nature, must we not suppose that there is a likeness between the rational order which governs their thinking activities and the order which regulates nature in its other spheres or aspects".4 The strange thing about this typical argument is that no thinkers but the idealists have ever contended that the mind is alien to nature. The materialist is the first person to admit that reason is natural and that the mind has been slowly shaped in the processes of evolution. Novel forms of existence arise from time to time, not because they have pre-existed in reality in the form of "rationality", "will", "personality", "spirit", "soul", and what not, but because all combinations of matter and energy have not, and never will be, exhausted. The ma- terialist argument, in this general form, is not new and has been clearly stated as early as the very beginnings of modern philos- ophy, namely, by Galileo Galilei who said: "Nature did not make human brains first, and then construct things according to their capacity of understanding, but she first made things in her own fashion and then so constructed the human understanding that it, at the price of great exertion, might ferret out a few of her se- crets".5 It is a well-known tendency of idealism to side with transcendental metaphysics, while materialishi tends to affiliate itself with scientific empiricism. C. L. Barrett, Philosophy, 306. 6 Opere, VII, 34I.</page><page sequence="9">R. B. Winn 293 There is no reason for me to conceal that I accept whole- heartedly the latter position as based preeminently on verified findings of observation and thought. I realize, of course, that materialism is far from perfect at the present stage of its de- velopment, and even the term itself is not free from ambiguities. Nevertheless, the foundations of materialism are rooted in facts and practice; and the trend of scientific development since the I7th century indicates that science itself, despite its occasional lapses into mysticism, is about to confirm the principal assump- tions of materialism. Idealism, on the other hand, has its historical source in anthropomorphism and mysticism, and, as the latter is being slowly eliminated from the domain of sound thought and observation, idealism finds itself more and more on the defensive. It seems to me that idealism is quite wrong in ascribing to reality the qualities of thought, as if reason created nature and not the other way around. In doing so, idealism projects human traits into the external world. An analogy, paradoxically derived from Plato himself, will illustrate the point. Suppose we paraphrase and slightly modify Plato's famous story of the cave,6 to read this way: Behold! human beings living in a hall with mirrors of colored glass instead of walls. Here they have been from their childhood, and have their legs and necks chained so that they cannot move, and can only see before them, being prevented by the chains from turning round their heads. Above and below them bright lights are shining, and between the lights and the prisoners there is a raised way; and you will see, if you look, a low wall built along this way, like the screen which marionette players have in front of them, over which they show the puppets. I see. And do you see, I said, men passing along the wall carrying all sorts of vessels and various materials, which appear over the wall? Some of them are talking, others silent. You have shown me a strange image, and they are strange prisoners. Like ourselves, I replied; and they see only the reflections of things 6 T'he Republic, Book VII.</page><page sequence="10">294 Is Nature Rational? and people, including themselves, which are things in the mirror be- fore them. True, he said; how could they see anything but the reflections if they were never allowed to move their heads? And of the objects which are being carried in like manner they could only see reflections? Yes, he said. And if they were able to converse with one another, would they not suppose that they were naming what was actually before them? Very true. And now look again, and see what will naturally follow if the prisoners are released and disabused of their error. At first, when any of them is liberated and compelled suddenly to stand up and turn his neck round and walk and touch real objects, he will suffer great bewilderment and uncertainty; the solidity of things will distress him and inflict actual pain in a rough contact. He will be unable to recognize the realities of which in his former state he had colored reflections; and then conceive some one saying to him, that what he saw before was an illusion, but that now, when he is approaching nearer to facts and his eye is turned towards more real existence, he has a clearer vision-what will be his reply? And you may further imagine that his instructor is pointing to the objects as they pass and requiring him to describe their qualities-will he not be perplexed? Will he not fancy that the reflections which he formerly saw are truer than the objects which he now touches? Far truer. We need proceed no further. It is a familiar truth that at all times man's thought tends to run along anthropomorphic, or even egomorphic, lines. In the past, he endowed natural forces with human-like characteristics (animism); populated the world with gods thinking, feeling and acting in a manner reflecting man's own nature or tribe's own culture; placed himself into the center of the universe; and identified the destiny of the cosmos with that of humanity. Nature thus became a mirror reflecting human qualities, desires and aspirations, while men persistently failed to recognize anthropomorphic distortions of reality in their views. Similarly with reason. Reason is man's tool of knowledge, a way of solving more or less complex and remote problems of life. It enabled him to comprehend even the laws of nature.</page><page sequence="11">R. B. Winn 295 But is it necessary to make the external world partake, in one's own mind, of the human way of experience and then to "discover" that, remarkably enough, nature is rational? Reality (as existence) and truth (as an adequate knowledge of it) have something in common, no doubt-for how else could knowledge be possible?-yet it is sheer anthropomorphism to call nature rational, rather than reason natural, even when this is done by noted physicists, such as J. Jeans visualizing "the Great Archi- tect" and "Mathematician"7 or A. Einstein saying: "It is enough for me . . . to try humbly to comprehend even an infinitesimal part of the intelligence manifested in nature".8 It is about time to recall once more Francis Bacon's famous warning: "The Idols of the Tribe have their foundation in human nature itself, and in the tribe or race of men. For it is a false assertion that the sense of man is the measure of things. On the contrary, all perceptions as well of the sense as of the mind are according to the measure of the individual and not according to the measure of the universe. And the human understanding is like a false mirror, which, receiving rays irregularly, distorts and discolors the nature of things by mingling its own nature with it".9 In order to comprehend the true nature of things, let us ask a few specific questions. When is thought rational? Obviously, when its conclusions are adequate to the problem in question. And the problems engaging one's thought are all, directly or indirectly, of practical significance, having been stimulated by experience and being applicable to it after a correct solution. The human mind is a creation of earthly environment. For countless ages it was being shaped by experience, natural selec- tion, and numerous other forces, until finally it acquired the present capability to perceive, to imagine, to reason. Man's power of understanding may as yet be very limited and fickle, but it was again nature that had set these limitations. She gave her human children but a few sensory channels along which 7 2he Mysterious Universe, I2. 8 Living Philosophies, a Symposium, 7. 9 Novum Organum, aphorism 41. Italics are mine. R. W.</page><page sequence="12">296 Is Nature Rational? cognition was permitted to them; distorted their knowledge by providing sensory experience with a standpoint shifting in time and space; subordinated thought to emotion; and organized their logic in agreement with the dictates of the natural order. Truth itself, as a distant limit of intellectual wisdom, became nothing other than nature disguised in the symbolic forms of human knowledge. In his ignorance and vanity, however, man cus- tomarily regarded reason as his own achievement and virtue, and applauded the world whenever he succeeded in noticing its kinship with the operations of the mind; or, in an outburst of misguided insight, he projected his own qualities outward and discovered, in the ecstasy of anthropomorphic mysticism, Reality permeated with Thought. Yet the fact remains that reason is neither a prerogative of wise individuals nor a free gift of Heaven: a rational thought is simply that thought which is in sufficient agreement with the laws of nature, that thought which is well adjusted to it. Ad- justment is often factual, but rationality is a human name for the recognition of it. When do we regard a man's behavior as rational? It is not intelligent to address workers as if they were professors, or adults as if they were children; nor is it a sign of wisdom to take an umbrella on a clear day and to leave it at home when it rains; and it is definitely stupid to put salt into one's tea and expect it to be sweet. Rationality manifests itself, not in dis- regard of particular situations, but rather in insight into their practical meaning. The main requirement of intelligence is to modify and adjust one's behavior according to time, place and circumstance. Unless this is done, one's behavior results in inconsistency, blunder, failure. When do we regard an institution as functioning rationally? Clearly, when it satisfies human needs and expectations. And as requirements alter with time and country, every institution should be adapted to social change. The institution ceases to be rational in proportion to its social lag or obsolescence. Its efficiency or inefficiency is invariably relative to the general situation. That is why feudal practices normal to, and con</page><page sequence="13">R. B. Winn 297 gruous with, the older ways of living could not "work" under the later, capitalist, structure of society; and the institutions of the laissez-faire period cease, in their turn, to "work" under contemporary conditions, insofar as they are not quite adapted to meet new social phenomena and popular demands. When do we find rationality in an organism, say, in a field flower? If climatic conditions prevent the normal development of the plant, it will not reach the stage of maturity necessary for fertilization; and if the species, because of some change in environment, fails to attract insects and, consequently, to produce seeds, it is bound to perish. What we call "rational", in these and similar cases, is nothing other than sufficient adjustment of parts to the whole, of the preceding stage of growth to the sub- sequent ones, of the individual organism to its environment. Is the external world, as exemplified by activities of the chemi- cal elements and by the motions of heavenly bodies, rational? The history of science demonstrates that nature is a coherent whole. By this I do not mean that there is no conflict in the universe. Quite the contrary, motion, change, and the conflict of forces are its most conspicuous characteristics. Nevertheless, we know full well-and our knowledge is supported by the entire evidence of science-that the laws of nature are not self-con- tradictory. If a theory does not account for every phenomenon in its field and admits of exceptions, we declare it inadequate or faulty, obviously in the belief that the laws of nature work always in a definite and exact way. Shall we say, therefore, that nature is perfectly harmonious? No; for surely absolute harmony would imply changelessness. Yet change is every- where. What can it mean? Clearly that nature is constructed (this statement of mine has no idealistic implications) in a manner in which the balance of forces is continually lost and re-established. There are both adjustment and lack of adjust- ment in nature. There are both rationality and irrationality in it, if we wish to make a concession to human language. And laws of nature stand evidently for rules of adjustment, without which there would be a universal chaos beyond human un- derstanding.</page><page sequence="14">298 Is Nature Rational? Finally, is man a rational animal? According to a traditional assumption, he is. But the statement does not contain the whole truth, for there is a basic contradiction in it. Professor H. L. Hawkins, a distinguished paleontologist, was right in saying that man is the only "irrational creature", as any worm or fish, thanks to its instincts, is better adapted to its habitat. Man's utter helplessness is vastly compensated, however, by his enormous power of adjustment, of which brain is the organ, which helps him not only to gain the upper hand in the animal world, but even to combat and master natural forces them- selves. Where a lower animal perishes as a victim of its own splendid adjustment to the given but passing environment, man adjusts and re-adjusts himself to change. He has learned to live in arctic lands as well as in the tropics, to travel under the surface of the sea and above the ground and even above the clouds, to measure microscopic quantities and to lift moun- tains of stone. There is no need for multiplying our instances any further to see that rationality invariably implies adjustment and should be defined in its terms, lest our knowledge be obscured by mysti- cism and anthropomorphism. That is to say, we should define rationality as a form of adjustment, not vice versa. In referring to an instance of rationality in nature, the idealist actually deals with a case of adjustment. But he is not satisfied with this scientific name. Rather, he prefers to glorify it. He chooses to call a natural thing by a name that would put himself and his kind on a pedestal. That is how he finds reason in the cosmos. When, however, the idea strikes him, in a moment of doubt and weakness, that he is just a speck of dust in the im- mense spaces of the universe, he drives the bad thought away. It is a pity, after all, to give up his glorious illusion; for it is pleasant to cherish the notion that, in some sense at least, he is still the center of all things-if not because the world has been created specially for his sake, if not because he is God's most beloved son, if not because the sun, planets and stars revolve round the earth, then because the world is guided by those very principles of which he is the most skillful master, by the principles of reason. Many a noble man suffered because of these illusions. Many</page><page sequence="15">R. B. Winn 299 a great struggle of science was waged against these "glorious" illusions. But they are not yet all dead: the bitter fight must be continued to the end. We must learn to call things by their right name. And rationality must be recognized for what it truly is-a form of adjustment, as recognized by men. But then rationality ceases to offer a valid argument in favor of the idealistic interpretation of reality; on the contrary, it becomes a trump in the hands of the materialist. The above analysis of rationality throws a very definite light on the nature of human mind and also on the basic fallacy of idealism. Deep in human nature there lies the urge for un- derstanding. It is not a desire to know for the sake of knowing, but either an expression of the need to live with a clear purpose or else an expression of the belief that knowledge can be utilized for practical aims of man and humanity. It is the urge for understanding as a means of solving the problems of life, emo- tional and factual. However, in his primitive existence, man had all the vigor of emotional yearning, yet little insight into the paramount significance of reason. Because knowledge is essentially human, it contained a great deal of anthropomorphism. And because knowledge is essentially practical, it took, in the absence of ade- quate and exact information concerning the elemental forces of reality, the form of mysticism. So mysticism became the "knowledge" of our ancestors. They populated the universe with strange beings of fancy, created in the image of man. There arose, in their beliefs, good and evil deities who had to be propitiated, flattered, appealed to, re- spected, obeyed. This primitive attitude persists, to some extent, in modern idealism. Anthropomorphism has taken, of course, an advanced form. The forces of environment are no longer conceived of as spiritual entities, except by naive, emotional and mystic souls. Mysticism has receded only to vest itself into the scholar's language. It portrays the universe not in the image of man's body, but in the image of man's mind. It declares the existence of Intelligence controlling the world. Today, when we can account for most phenomena in terms of</page><page sequence="16">300 Is Nature Rational? facts and figures, even if not to the complete satisfaction of scholars, when we become increasingly masters of our surround- ings, it is superfluous and often harmful to persist in our primitive illusions, whether expressed with simple faith or dressed in the language of erudite philosophers. True as all this is, it may be advisable, to avoid a possible misunderstanding, to say that I do not condemn the idealism of the past. I realize full well that it has been instrumental to the development of civilization. Nevertheless today, when science, philosophy and art have largely emancipated them- selves from their original mysticism, we ought to face facts more confidently. Instead of dissipating people's energies in the vain search for intangible and transcendent goals, we should comprehend that all our tasks are earthly and human. As far as philosophy is concerned, it is not enough for it to rise to the higher planes of abstraction: it should descend, enriched and emboldened, to the source of its original inspiration-man's pursuit of security and happiness. For a correct interpretation of its mission, we should assimilate thoroughly the idea that "philosophy at all times, like science, has had its roots in man's practical needs".'0 Consquently, whether we are noted thinkers or plain people, it behooves us to concentrate our efforts on solving our immediate problems and on building a better and fuller life among the nations of the world.
