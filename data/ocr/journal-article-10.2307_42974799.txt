<plain_text><page sequence="1">213 New Eden and New Babylon: Religious Thoughts of American Authors: A Bibliography Nelson R. Burr THE "DEATH OF GOD" The demise of man's gods, which Sterling proclaimed, eventually was accepted by some modern American theologians. Their writings justified the assumption of novelists, poets and dramatists that modern men have no need of gods. The most prominent "death-of-god" spokesman was Gabriel Vahanian, professor of religion at Syracuse University. His highly controversial book, The Death of God (New York, 1961) stressed exclusion of the idea of God from modern, secularized society. His later Wait Without God (New York, 1964) declares that Christian standards (or lack of them) are a central concern of twentieth-century writers. Even those who reject God continue the Christian culture in some respects. The critique includes Melville, Faulkner, and T. S. Eliot. Reviewers generally con- sidered it sensational. Regardless of critics, Vahanian' s attitude became a yardstick by which critics have measured many American novelists, poets and dramatists of the last half century, and especially since World War II. A witness to this fact is an essay by John L'Heureux, "On the Eighth Day; The Death of God in Contemporary American Literature." ( Critic , vol. 24, no. 6, June- July, 1966, pp. 46-55). He em- phasizes Vahanian's belief that God slowly - and painfully - died in modern literature. His own argument is that in contemporary American literature God is irrelevant and Christianity is meaningless. He calls, as witnesses, the novelists Bellow, Updike, Malamud, Ellison, Styron, Baldwin, Mailer, and Gold. "I can think of none," he writes, "in whose works God is a significant aspect of reality ... if God exists at all for contemporary American literature, he is an irrelevant God of silence and unconcern; man is his own measure." Much the same is true for dramatists Albee and Tennessee Williams. The reason may be, as Vahanian says in Wait Without Idols , that Christianity has idolized various cultures. Maxine Greene traces the godless theme farther back, in "Man Without God in American Fiction." (The Humanist , vol. 25, no. 3, May-June, 1965, pp. 125-128). She cites Hawthorne's Scarlet Letter and Hester Prynne; Thoreau's Waiden and journals on indifferent nature; Ishmael in Moby Dick as an instance of survival of unassisted human power; self-reliant Huck Finn, rebel against village orthodoxy; Crane's "The Open Boat" as evidence that men create their own meanings; Dreiser's characters overwhelmed by impersonal forces; Sher- wood Anderson's people in Winesburg , Ohio , seeking communion and understanding, "never the Assurance of God." Greene claims that "our literature tends to deal mainly with human beings left to their own devices in the world," their experience not "redeemed by religious faith." Nelson Burr is a director of the History Society of the Episcopal Church and a member of the editorial board of the Historical Magazine- Editor's Note.

This view is examined extensively by Howard Morrall Harper, Jr.: 4 'Concepts of Human Destiny in Five American Novelists: Bellow, Salinger, Mailer, Baldwin, Updike." CD. A. y vol 25, no. 11, May, 1965, pp. 6625-6626, no. 65-4380). He in- sists that before World War II American fiction reflected the traditional doctrine of progress, which considered man and his institutions as perfectible. But fiction has reflected increasing pessimism about this idea, and these writers are said to believe that it fails to explain the modern experience of violence and irrationality. Their concepts of human destiny are concerned with self rather than society, with spiritual rather than economic, political, or social progress. Man is master of his inner destiny - but apparently without divine aid. Irrationality, violence, new technology and weapons threaten his survival. Even if he escapes a thermonuclear holocaust, 4 'he may be reduced to spiritual insignificance by the growing power of the mass media, the conformist society, and the welfare state." Novelists generally see no help in religious faith and churches, says Joyce Marlene Flint: "In Search of Meaning: Bernard Malamud, Norman Mailer, John Updike." t D . A., vol. 30, no. 7, Jan., 1970, p. 3006-A, no. 70-1055). She com- ments that they reject the significance of the church in contemporary life. Com- ment on Updike reveals the reasons for spurning traditional religion: "... relativism and the popularization of the liberal-humanitarian dream have literally changed the consciousness of Americans. Man is no longer capable of believing that which he cannot see and thus religious belief, loyalty, and love are becoming obsolete." The author suggests that "modern man is destined to pursue a mean- ingless life, for without faith in God man cannot satisfy his deepest need: a belief in immortality." Studies of individual novelists reveal penetration of the "death of God" con- cept into their ideas of life. Norman Mailer's viewpoint is examined in Richard Lawson Dabney's thesis, "The Rebel and the Hipster." (D. A. /., vol. 32, no. 12, Pt. 1, June, 1972, p. 6969-A, no. 72-8995). He maintains that the atomic era caused many Americans to feel that science and technology had cut them off from religious faith and from God. "Mailer's hipster embraced the nihilistic mood of the time and accepted the absence of God ..." and saw America's future as in- volved in power struggles. Decline of belief in a supernatural power is seen by Bryant Nelson Wyatt in "Supernaturalism in John Updike's Fiction." (D. A. /., vol. 31, no. 9, Mar., 1971, p. 4802-A, no. 71-6671). He perceives Updike's serious concern with "the problem of warring spiritual values in contemporary America under the impact of industrial advancement, which poses the threat of an enveloping philosophy of secular humanism." He concludes that Updike does not make a convincing case for supernaturalism, because of the prevailing anti-supernaturalism. The struggle between naturalism and supernaturalism, the ideas of God and godlessness, is revealed in Ronald Glenson Toop's "Technique and Vision in the Fiction of Ernest Hemingway: A Chronological Study." (D. A. /., vol. 31, no. 8, Feb., 1971, pp. 4181-4182-A, order from National Library of Canada, Ottawa). He sees a "godless" world and universe in The Sun Also Rises and A Farewell to Arms. In these, he believes, Hemingway saw the universe as completely naturalistic, and art as the only possible religion. But For Whom the Bell Tolls suggests that the universe is not simply naturalistic. (147)</page><page sequence="3">RELIGIOUS THOUGHTS OF AMERICAN AUTHORS 2 1 5 POETS AND PLAYWRIGHTS: GOD INDIFFERENT OR INHUMAN Novelists were not alone in wrestling with the conundrum of man's relation to a "divinity that shapes our ends." All his life it troubled one herald of a new and profoundly thoughtful poetry, according to John Herman Miller: "E. A. Robin- son's Changing Beliefs About Living in the World." ( D . A. /., vol. 31, no. 9, Mar., 1971, p. 4783-A, no. 71-6879). He traces the poet's struggle to attain a meaning for life, and believes that in his later work he reached 4 'a compromise in which he sees men of faith receiving self-knowledge rather than spriritual insight into the world. They learn to know their own selfishness but they do not ex- perience the spiritual presence of God on earth . " Anna K. Juhnke suggests that much the same attitude characterizes Robinson's contemporary: "Religion in Robert Frost's Poetry: The Play for Self-Possession." ( American Literature , vol. 36, no. 2, May, 1964, pp. 153-164). She believes that the individual is the "central reality" for Frost, and "feels com- pletely cut off from any 'divine' reality beyond its own spiritual elements of love, courage, and creativity. Yet the speaker in the poetry keeps alive the possibility that something greater than man sustains order and purpose in the universe and may sometime break through men's isolation to reveal itself." Critics seem reluctant to believe that such a hope inspired the Hartford in- surance company executive who is recognized as a foremost modern American poet. He completely abandoned traditional orthodoxy, says William Carl Hamlin in "A Thematic Study of Reality, Death, Order, and Imagination in the Poetry of Wallace Stevens." ( D . A., vol. 24, no. 3, Sept., 1963, pp. 1170-1171, no. 63-6199). This critique holds that he regarded only sensible phenomena as the basis of imaginative conception, the physical world as the only knowable paradise, and death as the beginning and end of life. A like interpretation appears in Grosvenor Edward Powell's thesis, "Romantic Mysticism and the Poetry of Wallace Stevens." ( D . A., vol. 26, no. 9, Mar., 1966, pp. 5442-5443, no. 65-12, 841). He states that Stevens's universe is "essen- tially atomistic or mechanical in structure," that he had lost religious values, and thought that the gods had disappeared. But his best poems "do express nostalgia" for a transcendent reality. Marjorie Crockett Buhr thinks that Stevens would have resisted being assigned to any philosophical school: "The Essential Poem: A Study of Wallace Stevens' Ontology." (D. A.t vol. 30, no. 8, Feb., 1970, p. 3451-A, no. 70-1218). He is, she thinks, quite American in trying to reconcile idealism and naturalism, and in some respects resembles the transcendentalists and existentialists. He accepts the current idea of God's death, and "emphasizes men's heroism in the face of God's death and he rejects mechanistic philosophies (which existentialism despises) for transcendental ones. While he rejects Jove-Jehovah forms of Being, he continual- ly searches for what Tillich calls the Being beyond the God of theism." It has been argued that Stevens saw art as a substitute for religion - as in Jay Michael Semel's study: "Structures of Belief in the Poetry of Wallace Stevens." (D. A. /., vol. 31, no. 10, Apr., 1971, p. 5425-A, no. 71-9727). The poet "felt that naturalistic doctrine had long since killed the gods," and that the church had become self-centered and intolerantly dogmatic - likewise the modern state by whatever name. Art is therefore "an alternative structure." Robinson Jeffers has been accepted as a believer in the "death of God," and so it appears in Karl Keller's "California, Yankees, and the Death of God: The Allegory in Jeffers' Roan Stallion." ( Texas Studies in Literature and Language , (148)</page><page sequence="4">2 1 6 HISTORICAL MAGAZINE vol. 12, no. 1, spring, 1970, pp. 111-120). He argues that, while the poem is per- vaded by Christian references, they suggest that 4 'the killing of the stallion is a kind of crucifixion in which it is shown that the divine cannot be tolerated in the human world ... an acceptance in allegorical figures of the terms of God's death in man's life." The term "inhumanisn aas been used to describe the outlook of this poet upon the universe and the world. It appeared more than forty years ago in a criti- que by Benjamin Miller: 4 'The Religious Philosophy of Robinson Jeffers." (University Review, vol. 4., no. 2, winter, 1937, pp. 129-132). He calls Jeffers a "painstaking scientist, describing the natural world in which man must live out his life, and the indefatigable mystic, laying bare the massive, inhuman core Earth, upon which man must lean for strength and courage." His metaphysics was anti-humanistic and naturalistic, his God essentially inhuman. This is the conclusion of later studies, like Donald William Hrubesky's: "Robinson Jeffers - An Inverted Whitman." (£&gt;. A. /., vol. 32, no. 6, Dec., 1971, p. 3253-A, no. 72-1789). Unlike Whitman, he did not perceive man as potentially divine, and so did not share his faith in democracy. He saw the universe as beautiful in itself, and God as impersonal. Another critic sees some of Jeffers's characters as appearing to favor a concep- tion of God as inhuman : William Grimes Cherry III, "An Analysis of the Major Characters of Selected Long Poems by Robinson Jeffers as Reflections of the Author's Philosophy and Poetic Theory." (D. A. /., vol. 34, no. 10, Apr., 1974, pp. 6631-6632, no. 74-5371). His Jesus in Dear Judas doubts his own divinity. Jeffers scorned what he considered as impotent Christianity, and its concept of religious salvation. Bill Hotchkiss thinks of Jeffers's inhumanism as a doctrine: "The Sivaistic Vi- sion: Art and Theme in Robinson Jeffers." (D. A. /., vol. 35, no. 8, Feb., 1975, p. 5408-A, no. 75-3884). It is "a frontal attack on the dominant humanistic value system ... so explicit that the normal 'willing suspension of disbelief' is not possi- ble for many readers." God is non-anthropomorphic, and may be approached and worshipped in reverence for natural beauty. A dramatist, says Jackson Elliott White, was "one of the first American writers to sense the 'death of God . . .' "He argues the point in "Existential Themes in Selected Plays of Eugene O'Neill." ( D . A., vol. 27, no. 12, June, 1967, p. 4270-4271-A, no. 67-7366). The playwright stressed the theme long before ex- istentialism and the "new theology" became popular, "revealing what it feels like to exist in a world without God." His early play, Thirst , is cited as a witness. His search for a new god having proved vain, he became pessimistic and despairing, and considered death as the only reality. A similar attitude is perceived in Francis L. Kunkel's essay, "Tennessee Williams and the Death of God." ( Commonweal , vol. 87, no. 20, Feb. 23, 1968, pp. 614-617). He points out that Williams's characters who search for God do not come up with orthodox conclusions. They find no appeal in the traditional, transcendent God as revealed in Jesus Christ, and apparently could accept Vahanian's "death of God" theology. ALIENATION AND LONELINESS A pervading sense of godlessness is generally believed to account for the American literary cult of the alienated individual - "Alone on a wide, wide sea. / So lonely 'twas that God Himself / Scarce seemed there to be." (Coleridge, "The (149)</page><page sequence="5">RELIGIOUS THOUGHTS OF AMERICAN AUTHORS 217 Rime of the Ancient Mariner"). At least two American critics have derived the loneliness from Emerson and Hawthorne. The origin is seen by Joseph Doherty in "Emerson and the Loneliness of the Gods." ( Texas Studies in Language and Literature , vol. 16, no. 1, spring, 1974, pp. 65-75). 4 'Emerson's internalization of the Ground of Being opened a window for American literature upon that emp- tiness into which numbers of its practitioners still bleakly stare. And in this discovery of the self incapsulated in absolute nothingness, Emerson anticipates the conditions of such loneliness as innumerable critics claim obsesses a great part of our literature to the present time." Doherty notes that Tocquevile scented this danger in American extreme individualism. Henry G. Fairbanks finds the same tendency in The Lasting Loneliness of Nathaniel Hawthorne : A Study of the Sources of Alienation in Modern Man (Albany, N.Y., [1965]). His thesis is that Hawthorne's life and work show the American longing for "a lost vision of totality 'which links God, Nature, and Man organically.' " (Comment by reviewer, Terence Martin, American Literature , vol. 38, no. 2, May, 1966, pp. 250-251). The inference is that lost religious unity and vision causes loneliness and alienation. NOVELISTS AND THEIR ALIENATED HEROES Critics since the 1950s have called attention to fictional fascination with the protagonist alienated from God and society. An early study is Richard Daniel Lehan's 4 4 Existentialism and the Modern American Novel." (D. A., vol. 20, no. 4, Oct., 1959, p. 1365, no. 59-3204). He considers Hemingway, Faulkner, Dos Passos, Bowles, Bellow, Wright and Ellison. He claims that they are non- religious, depicting people alienated from an essentially absurd and meaningless world and society. The alienated hero cannot find a way of life to replace the one he abandons, and therefore is destroyed. The alienated protagonist is perceived in John Michael Brand III: 4 'Fiction as Decreation: The Novels of Nathanael West." (D. A., vol. 30, no. 8, Feb., 1970, p. 3449- A, no. 70-1987). A Jew alienated from his religious heritage and not ready to accept the American experience, he created American characters who have lost their sustaining traditions. The result is a kind of nothingness, negation, decreation. Several critics have pinned the alienated label on a greater novelist, as does Richard Coate Gebhardt in 4 'Denial and Affirmation of Values in the Fiction of Ernest Hemingway." ( D . A. /., vol. 31, no. 3, Sept., 1970, pp. 1274-1275-A, no. 70-15,034). He maintains that Hemingway repudiates the idea of 4 'man's special place in a divinely ordered universe." Consequently his characters, thrown back upon themselves, become incomplete, lonely, isolated, and threatened. The religiously educated but disillusioned hero is depicted by Gary Douglas Elliott in "The Hemingway Hero's Quest for Faith." (D. A. /., vol. 34, no. 5, Nov., 1973, p. 2621-A, no. 73-26,346). The hero, Henry in A Farewell to Arms , sinks into despair and alienation. He is contrasted with Santiago in The Old Man and the Seaf who has a semi-Christian "viable faith for living." Richard Michael Dubiel sees a similarity of the novelist's attitude to the thought of a theologian who pondered human estrangement: "Disquietude, Ex- istence, and Endurance: Aspects of Paul Tillich' s Thought in Selected Works of Ernest Hemingway." ( D . A. /., vol. 35, no. 6, Dec., 1974, p. 3734-A, no. 74-26,706). It is said that both viewed human life in terms of meaninglessness and estrangement, and strove to find a way to fulfillment in life through "courage to be." (150)</page><page sequence="6">2 1 8 HISTORICAL MAGAZINE A peculiar kind of American alienation is seen by William Albert Cyril Francis in "The Novels of Vance Bourjaily: A Critical Analysis. " ( D . A. /., vol. 36, no. 7, Jan., 1967, pp. 4487-4488-A, no. 75-27,905). He sometimes alludes to Chris- tian mythology in his novels, which consider the struggles of characters to know themselves in post- World War II society, where they have become estranged from ethnic and cultural heritages. A thorough examination of alienation is Steven Ray Carter's "James Jones, An American Master: A Study of His Mystical, Philosophical, Social, and Ar- tistic Views. " (D. A. /., vol. 36, no. 8, Feb., 1976, pp. 5292-5293-A, no. 76-3397). The novels reveal isolation and alienation of souls from each other and from God, because of immersion in self. "Self is the enemy . . . and it must be defeated so that each soul can be reunited with God . . ." That state generally must be attained through suffering the consequences of selfishness. Another novelist also does not see alienation as hopeless, according to James Manuel Ferreira in "The Radical Individualism of Norman Mailer/ ' (D. A. /., vol. 33, no. 5, Nov., 1972, pp. 2369-2370-A, no. 72-27,853). Mailer sees the world as lacking traditional religious consolations and faith in life after death, and un- satisfied with materialism as a relief from meaninglessness and loneliness. It is the writer's mission to regenerate the national consciousness through literature. PROUD AND TROUBLED POETS Critics have long been certain that the feeling of alienation has been shared by poets and dramatists. Charles I. Glicksberg even calls it "The Malady of Modern Poetry.,, ( Prairie Schooner , vol. 21, no.l, spring, 1947, pp. 9-15). This essay avers that, because of their feeling of alienation from society and God, poets are rootless, despairing, and unsure of their social mission. William Robert Dubois has traced this feeling to the mid-nineteenth century, in "Walt Whitman's Poetry: A Record of Crisis in Identity." ( D . A. /., vol. 31, no. 12, June, 1971, pp. 6599-6600-A, no. 71-14,732). This emphasizes his search for cosmic identity, and discusses "Whitman's alienation from his central self, from his surroundings, and from his God, as offering one more example of the theme of alienation ..." A continual theme of critics is the effort of poets and dramatists to find a way out of loneliness and alienation. An example is Marlowe Dean Anderson's thesis, "Religious Themes in the Works of Robert Lowell." ( D . A., vol. 30, no. 10, Apr., 1970, pp. 4583-4584-A, no. 70-6554). This studies such themes in his poems and plays since 1939. One theme reveals Lowell as a seeker for values alternative to "the collapsed tradition of a transcendent faith. The quest for values in modern poetry is a religious search in the broad sense of man's need to overcome estrangement, his sense of being an alienated self in a hostile universe." The modern city is blamed for causing alienation. An example is Donald Albert Wilson, "City, Soul and Pysche: The Urban Poetry of Robert Lowell." (D. A., vol. 31, no. 12, June, 1971, p. 6637-A, no. 71-15,055). The poet, thinking of Boston and Concord, defines the individual as an exile in the urban scene, without relation to a spiritual community, which the modern city does not have. The theme of exile is stressed in two studies emphasizing one of the poet's most known and influential works. One is Peter Paul Remaley's "Epic Spirit in Robert Lowell's Lord Weary's Castle ." ( D . A..L, vol. 33, no. 7, Jan., 1973, pp. 3667-3668-A., no. 73-245). The protagonist is a poet-exile who has alienated himself from God's grace, and is trying to recover it. The quest is a spiritual (151)</page><page sequence="7">RELIGIOUS THOUGHTS OF AMERICAN AUTHORS 219 pilgrimage. Similar is the conclusion of John James McKenna, in 4 'The Poetry of Robert Lowell: The Major Themes.' ' ( D . A. /., vol. 32, no. 1, p. 444-A, no. 71-16,488). He perceives the purpose of Lord Weary 's Castle (1946) as an ex- planation of the soul's regaining saving grace, after becoming alienated from God through war and materialism. The study discusses Lowell's conversion to Catholicism and final disaffection from it, and from religion as a primary con- cern. Among modern American poets, who have pondered the theme of alienation, one is depicted as painfully concerned, in Howard Joel Kay: 4 The Poetry of Yvor Winters." (D. A, vol. 30, no. 4, Oct., 1969, pp. 1529-1530-A, no. 69-15,684). It is said that his early poetry, 1920-1928, reflects an alien and menacing universe, and is increasingly violent. Even though he became more restrained, his mature work still is "concerned with the horrifying effects of an alien universe, change, and death on Man, who desires stability. The only bulwark against madness is reason ..." Ronald Claude Baughman sees the same theme in "The Poetry of James Dickey: Variations on Estrangement." ( D . A. /., vol. 36, no. 11, May, 1976, pp. 7416-7417-A, no. 76-10,488). The poet, returned from World War II, discovers that men are estranged from God, fellow men, and themselves. They cannot find a way out through personal love, and discover no friend in nature, which is strug- gling with man for survival. The dramatists also seem not to offer hope of escape, according to Lawrence David Lowenthal, "The Absurd in Recent American Drama." (D. A. /., vol. 31, no. 9, Mar., 1971, pp. 4779-4780-A, no. 71-5616). His analysis of many dramas reveals a general idea that the universe is godless, purposeless and meaningless. The individual is forlorn and anxious, and must assume moral freedom without responsibility to a god. He is alienated from God and other men. The critic refers to the great influence of post-war existentialism. But this theme occurs in American drama long before 1940, claims Mohamad Rashid Karadaghi: "The Theme of Alienation in Eugene O'Neill's Plays." ( D . A. /., vol. 32, no. 9, Mar., 1972, p. 5232-A, no. 72-7461). The dramatist called alienation "the sickness of today," caused by "death of God" and the lack of a substitute. Most of his central characters feel lost and estranged from other peo- ple, the world, and God. They "belong" only in death, a release from pain - as in "The Hairy Ape." The result is "tortured isolation," claims Dorothy Kennedy Kilker in "Eugene O'Neill's Methods of Characterizing the Secret Self." ( D . A. /., vol. 32, no. 6, Dec., 1971, p. 3311, no. 72-563). Man's search for self-realization, understanding of his fellow men, and God, usually is frustrated by the nature of the world and man. It ends in meaninglessness, without the comfort of religious faith. No more comforting is Tennessee Williams, as seen in Delma Eugene Presley: "The Theological Dimension of Tennessee Williams: A Study of Eight Major Plays." (D. A., vol. 30, no. 5, Nov., 1969, p. 2038-A, no. 69-19,613). She begins with the observation that this dramatist's hero "inhabits a world in which man is alienated from mankind, God is absent, and death is certain." Like many modern writers, he uses religious ideology in trying to find a solution for man's isolation. A later critic does not change the conclusion, in Mary Ellen Shaughnessy's "In- complete Sentence: A Study of Tennessee Williams Since 1960." ( D . A. /., vol. 38, no. 9, Mar., 1978, p. 5485-A, no. 77-32,701). She notes that in Dragon Coun- try and other plays Williams is "preoccupied with themes of control, endurance, man's powerlessness in the fact of a cruel world, an alien God, and his own creative forces." (152)</page><page sequence="8">220 HISTORICAL MAGAZINE But the theme of alienation is sometimes linked with that of reconciliation. This appears in a thesis by Ronald Kenneth Dieb: "Patterns of Sacrifice in the Plays of Arthur Miller, Tennessee Williams, and Edward Albee." (D. A., vol. 30, no. 11, May, 1970, p. 5104-A, no. 70-6686). He claims that they use ritualistic sacrifice "as a solution to contemporary estrangement and as a means of dramatic resolution' ' - in modern terms. The sources of their usage are pagan and biblical religious ceremonies of sacrificial reconciliation. The ritual may represent evasion or acceptance of responsibility. One poet's work is interpreted as seeking his own reconciliation: Margaret Dickie Uroff, "Hart Crane's White Buildings ." ( D . A ., vol. 26, no. 6, Dec., 1965, p. 3354, no. 65-13, 697). It seems that his literary career was a long succes- sion of experiments to achieve transcendence and to bridge the gap between the real and the ideal world, and to overcome his own alienation from the world around him. A poet who found surcease from alienation in a traditional Christian sense is considered by Ruth Horton Whitford: "Alienation and Reconciliation in the Works of T. S. Eliot." (D. A, vol. 28, no. 4, Oct., 1967, pp. 1519-1520-A, no. 67-1 1,133). She points to heavy stress on alienation in his earlier work, particular- ly the concept of wilderness , where the alienated person is lost in meaninglessness and frustration. As he became more sympathetic to the Catholic Christian view- point, Elioťs characters find reconciliation in churchly ways of confession, penance, expiation, self-renunciation and restoration. REDEEMING LOVE IN THE MODERN "WASTELAND" Elioťs Christian religious solution implies that, in the world of loneliness and alienation, there may be a possibility of redemptive love. This way was evident to older novelists who lived into the era of disillusionment and alienation after 1945. One is appreciated by Ray B. West, Jr., in "Katherine Ann Porter: Symbol and Theme in 'Flowering Judas.' " (. Accent , vol. 7, spring, 1947, pp. 182-188). She perceived that society may cope with the "wasteland," by religion or revolution, but only when transformed by love. Man cannot live in a world divided by oppos- ing materialistic and spiritual values, without faith or love. One of Porter's contemporaries had the same perception, according to E. K. Brown: "A Christian Humanist: Thornton Wilder." (University of Toronto Quarterly , vol. 4, no. 3, Apr., 1935, pp. 356-370). He perceives the piety of Wilder as not Victorian but Catholic, expressing Christian confidence in divine providence as the determining force in life, through God's love. This interpretation generally has been confirmed by later critics, as in Allen Dennis Loyd's "The Shudder of Awe: A study of the Novels of Thornton Wilder." (D. A., vol. 29, no. 5, Nov., 1968, pp. 1541-1542-A, no. 68-16,346). He declares that a prominent theme in Wilder's fiction is "the growth of love." He contradicts the prevailing alienation by seeing man as "finding that he has a 'rela- tion to everywhere, to everybody, and to always!' " Wilder, Loyd insists, believes that man cannot solve his metaphysical problem by empirical science, and must rely upon religion as an ordered structure. His last novel, The Eighth Day , sets man in his relationship to society, science, religion and politics. Wilder's definition of Christian love underlies his fiction, says Evelyn Edith Claxton: "The Novels of Thornton Wilder." (D. A., vol. 32, no. 2, Aug., 1971, p. 959-A, no. 71-13,290). ". . . it becomes obvious that Wilder feels this love is the means by which man can transform his alienation into communion, bind up (153)</page><page sequence="9">RELIGIOUS THOUGHTS OF AMERICAN AUTHORS 221 the broken fragments of his own time into a whole that partakes of timelessness, and exercise, within the limits of his destiny, freedom of will by choosing to love.,, Another critic notices Wilder' s preoccupation with 4 4 the great religious themes' ' - particularly love. (Rhea Bond Miller, "Stages in Becoming: A Study of Form in Thornton Wilder's Novels." D. A. /., vol. 37, no. 7, Jan., 1977, p. 4357-A, no. 76-29,461). He dwelt on the "phenomena of temporal existence which most strongly intimate the existence and nature of God, preeminent among which is love . . ." Some critics find the ideal of redemptive love in a novelist often identified with post-World War II uncertainty. (Joyce Bonners Markle, "Fighters and Lovers: Theme in the First Five Novels of John Updike." D. A. /., vol. 32, no. 2, Aug., 1971, p. 975-A, no. 71-16,884). This critique perceives the emphasis upon redemptive love in his first novel, The Poorhouse Fair . A poor elderly character expresses a vision of human special worth based on Christian faith, which he communicates to others and so increases "their sense of selfhood and their hopes of more than mortal existence." Linda Marie Plagman finds that Updike's theme of Christian love was strongly influenced by the theologian Karl Barth. ("The Modern Pilgrims: Marriage and the Self in the work of John Updike." D. A. /., vol. 36, no. 1, July, 1975, pp. 325-326-A, no. 75-14,994). The novelist, she thinks, saw the causes of social alienation in loss of religious faith, and especially of the Christian ideal of unselfish love, as contrasted with selfish, unredemptive romantic love. It is argued that dramatist Eugene O'Neill finally accepted this view: Wayne Edward Bell, "Forms of Religious Awareness in the Late Plays of Eugene O'Neill." (D. A., vol. 28, no. 1, July, 1967, p. 222-A, no. 67-8828). His early plays express despair and rebellion against man's meaningless struggle against op- pressive, inscrutable forces. But his late plays place the blame upon the in- dividual's free choices. The final one, A Moon for the Misbegotten, portrays the redemptive role of love and forgiveness, without disregarding the reality of sin and guilt or the limits human destiny places on man's freedom. A peculiar interpretation of love in a religious play is seen by Paul T. Nolan in "God on Stage: A Problem in Characterization, Marc Connelly's Green Pastures." {Xavier University Studies , vol. 4, no. 2, May, 1965, pp. 75-84). "The last scene, showing Christ's crucifixion, is a simple reminder that the implications of the Christian commandments of brother love and self-sacrifice must evidence themselves in a different attitude of the superior being (the white man in the au- dience) toward the human being (the Negro actors on stage)." A secularized version of the love motif is attributed to Arthur Miller in Charles Eugene McKay's study, "The Themes of Awareness, Self-Knowledge, and Love in Arthur Miller's Major Dramatic Works." (D. A. /., vol. 37, no. 7, Jan., 1977, p. 4356-A, no. 77-1423). He contends that the playwright could not accept a moral code based on religion as suitable to the twentieth century, and therefore would base one on human experience, recognizing that man is most godlike when acting upon the instinct of love. ABSURD AND SAINTLY HEROES One result of the feeling of alienation, helplessness and insignificance has been the appearance of a stock character. He is the anti- or absurd hero, sometimes de- fiant, sometimes pathetic, and sometimes both. He may be a "nice guy" and (154)</page><page sequence="10">222 HISTORICAL MAGAZINE become a saintly (and often naive and ineffective) hero. Usually he is thought to have stepped on stage in the time of World Wars I and II. But he has been recognized in an earlier period, by Philip Leland Krauth's "The Necessary Cox- comb: The Theme of Egotism in the Works of Stephen Crane. " ( D . A. /., vol. 31, no. 11, May, 1971, p. 6014-A, no. 71-13,551). Crane dramatized "man's ab- surd conceit" as a protection against hostile nature and God. In his poems of rebellion he "depicts the little man ... as actuated by a conceit which both sus- tains his life and makes him a ridiculous little man." Later he appears in another form, suggested by James Gindin's "Gods and Fathers in F. Scott Fitzgerald's Novels." ( Modern Language Quarterly , vol. 30, no. 1, Mar., 1969, pp. 64-85). Fitzgerald's hero is charming, intelligent, sensitive, romantic, vulnerable, and inclined to play God - but doomed by an old moral order, or by his or other people's destiny, which he cannot control. Thomas M. Lorch perceives another variety in "The Peculiar Half-World of Nathanael West." ( D . A ., vol. 26, no. 4, Oct., 1965, p. 2218, no. 65-9695). His novels reveal a dark, violent, depersonalized half-world, reflecting his own pessimism. He made positive efforts to counteract the hostile forces, and pro- duced a peculiar type of hero, a combination of saint, clown and artist - rather absurd. By the 1960s the type had become a fixture in critical literature, such as David Darryl Galloway's thesis, "The Absurd Hero in Contemporary American Fic- tion: The Works of John Updike, William Styron, Saul Bellow, and J. D. Sal- inger." (D. A., vol. 23, no. 11, May, 1963, pp. 4356-4357, no. 62-5558). They share the belief of Albert Camus "that man must oppose an apparently mean- ingless universe, even though his demands for order and meaning make him ab- surd. Through dedication to his own intention, the modern absurd hero breaks away from all conventional values and actively pursues new ones." His search for values is essentially religious. A similar view is expressed by Charles B. Harris in "Contemporary American Novelists of the Absurd." (D. A. /., vol. 31, no. 8, Feb., 1971, p. 4162-A, no. 71-2379). The study focuses upon Joseph Heller, Kurt Vonnegut, Jr., Thomas Pynchon and John Barth. Their "absurdist vision" is defined as "the belief that we are trapped in a meaningless universe and that neither God nor man, theology nor philosophy, can make sense of the human condition." The hero must be ab- surd, because he cannot really do anything about it. One of Harris's novelists is studied as the creator of a non- or absurd hero, by Eric Solomon: "From Christ in Flanders to Catch 22: An Approach to War Fic- tion." ( Texas Studies in Literature and Langauge, vol. 11, no. 1, spring, 1969, pp. 851-866). Joseph Heller's "hero" of World War II, Yossarion, changes from a naive one, believing God is on his side, to one crucified by the war of a corrupt society. He is converted to a crusader against war. The comically absurd hero is examined by Joseph Michael De Roller in "The Lower-Case Absurd: A Study of the Novels of Peter Devries." (D. A. /., vol. 38, no. 2, Aug., 1977, p. 786-A, no. 77-16,219). He argues that Devries constructed "a pattern of reconciliation," in which he "transforms (and secularizes) the Christian concept of conversion as a process of self-transcendence. The pattern enables Devries' s comically absurd protagonists to achieve a more valid identity through awareness of and accommodation to their roles in society." That the absurd hero is the result of an absurd situation is the theme of Leonard Salvator Quirino's "The Darkest Celebrations of Tennessee Williams." ( D . A ., vol. 25, no. 8, Feb., 1965, p. 4706, no. 65-2240). The dramatist's universe (155)</page><page sequence="11">RELIGIOUS THOUGHTS OF AMERICAN AUTHORS 223 is depicted as moved by powers hostile to man. The six plays studied 4 4 deal with mortality as an absurd situation which provides no satisfactory 'exit' into mean- ingfulness or knowledge.' ' Predatory mortals battle futilely. Some mortals do not believe that they battle futilely, and their type is examined fully in Arnold Křupat, 4 The Saintly Hero: A Study of the Hero in Some Con- temporary American Novels. " ( D . A., vol. 28, no. 6, Dec., 1967, 2251-A, no. 67-14,064). The type, studied in West, Bellow, Barnes, Wallant and Kerouac, is intensely religious, violent, zealous for the salvation of all men, flamboyant in behavior and action. The novel of the saintly hero "introduces the possibility of an art for art's sake and for God's, the possibility of a literature concerned both with the largest spiritual issues men can face and the most sophisticated technical problems artists can face." The pathetic and futile side of the saintly hero is shown in Jonathan Baum- bach's study, "The Saint as a Young Man: A reappraisal of The Catcher in the Rye ." ( Modern Language Quarterly , vol. 25, no. 4, Dec., 1964, pp. 461-472). Holden Caulfield is depicted as a victim of the effects of evil in an incurably cor- rupt adult world, an innocent seeker for "a wise and benevolent authority." He cannot live by himself as an innocent, and is "an impotent saint, unable either to redeem the fallen or to prevent their fall." The saintly hero's dilemma appears vividly in a study by David D. Galloway: "The Absurd Man as Saint: The Novels of John Updike." (Modern Fiction Studies , vol. 11, no. 2, summer, 1964, pp. 111-127). He discerns the hero in Rab- bity Run, an ex-athlete, businessman, as a rebel against his modern spiritual "wasteland." He is an absurd saint pursuing an elusive ideal, and becomes isolated, like Yossarian in Heller's Catch-22. He is a saint not related to a par- ticular religious tradition. Another kind of saintly hero appears in Robert Jackson Higgs, "The Unheroic Hero: A Study of the Athlete in Twentieth-Century American Literature." (D. A., vol. 28, no. 10, Apr., 1968, p. 4177-A, no. 68-3745). He notices the emergence of this type around 1900, and its survival from Jack London to Ten- nessee Williams. It lives by pious platitudes, and believes in a kind of "muscular Christianity." (The athlete is prominent in evangelistic crusades, like Billy Graham's. N. R. B.) THE NEW SEARCH FOR GOD IN THE NOVEL "Death of God" theology and scientific, materialistic secularism caused aliena- tion and despair among American authors. But the quest for meaning, salvation and divinity has not been completely abandoned. Critics have found evidence of a continuing quest. John Michael Howell builds a convincing case in "The Waste Land Tradition in the American Novel." ( D . A,, vol. 24, no. 8, Feb., 1964, p. 3337, no. 64-1814). He analyzes the influence of T. S. Eliot's The Waste Land (1922) on Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby, Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises , Faulkner's The Sound and the Fury , and Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye. A persistent motif is contrast between the wasteland of materialism and spiritual sterility, and the "Grail Quest" (sometimes thwarted) of characters seeking spiritual fulfilment and a religious symbol of salvation. The search sometimes is seen as a longing for redemption, perhaps by divine help. This is suggested in Jonathan Baumbach's The Landscape of Nightmare ; Studies in the Contemporary American Novel (New York, New York University (156)</page><page sequence="12">224 HISTORICAL MAGAZINE Press, 1965, with bibliography). This includes Warren, Bellow, Salinger, Ellison, O'Connor, Malamud, Styron, Wallant and Morris. "If one had to abstract from these novels a unifying concern, ... it would be Dostoevskian, the confrontation of man with the objectification of his primordial self and his exemplary spiritual passage from innocence to guilt to redemption.' ' The search for divinity is identified by Mildred P. Strassberg's thesis, "Religious Commitment in Recent American Fiction: Flannery O'Connor, Ber- nard Malamud, John Updike." ( D . A. /., vol. 32, no. 11, May, 1972, p. 6457-A, no. 72-6417). Representing Roman Catholic, Jewish and Protestant traditions, they bridge "the gap between body and spirit, thought and act, religion and morality. Each presents rapturous emotion in his own style, ecstatic or plain, and each responds to a beauty of nature which reveals a transcendent being." According to several critics, this revelation has come to an impressive number of novelists. One is studied in Evelyn Clare Dugan, "The Novels of Thornton Wilder: Themes Through Characterization.' ' (D. A. /., vol. 31, no. 11, May, 1971, pp. 6050-6051-A, no. 71-9521). She analyzes the moral and religious themes of six novels as revealed in characters. The religious theme includes search for a divinity or supreme being, controlling one's destiny, and "reveals Wilder's pro- gression from ambivalence to serious consideration, to emphatic affirmation." His quest evidently was more successful than one described by Jon Eric Nelson: "Religious Experience in the Fiction of Ernest Hemingway." ( D . A., vol. 31, no. 1, July, 1970, p. 396-A, no. 70-12,088). He sees no cosmic order in Hemingway's writing, but an effort of characters to find order and meaning in life - ineffective, because it is so individualistic, and results in a kind of panic. Santiago, in The Old Man and the Sea, observes rituals that "do seem to have cosmic sanction . . .," and this "helps to define the special quality of the rest of Hemingway's work." One novelist was deeply impressed by this story, says M. E. Bradford in "On the Importance of Discovering God: Faulkner and Hemingway's The Old Man and the Sea." (Mississippi Quarterly , vol. 20, no. 3, summer, 1967, pp. 158-162). In a review he declared that Hemingway had discovered a creator God - "an at- titude toward the order of Creation, toward the arrangement of providentially assigned roles within that order, and toward the necessity for submission, courtesy, and mutual respect between creatures disposed within that arrangement to its all-sustaining operation." Faulkner saw in Hemingway his own doctrine of nature. Of another novelist a scholar has said that "the question of man's relation to God" gives his fiction "its special resonance." (John Douglas Lang, "William Styron: The Christian Imagination." D. A. /., vol. 36, no. 9, Mar., 1976, p. 6101-A, no. 76-5754). Styron considers the decline of religious values and "the need for a renewed understanding of the moral and spiritual dimensions of human existence," in terms of man as the image of God. Even though he does not appeal to the finality of Christian doctrine, and does not have the "specific creedal commitment of Graham Greene, Flannery O'Connor and Walker Percy." Another novelist with such a commitment is appreciated by Alice and Kenneth Hamilton in The Elements of John Updike (Grand Rapids, Mich., 1970). A review by Norris W. Yates notes the emphasis on Updike's understanding of Christian theology, his awe of and trust in the Christian God, and the longing of his characters for spiritual fulfilment. They are children of God, called to obey his eternal laws, and moved by his divine grace. (American Literature , vol. 42, no. 4, Jan., 1971, pp. 607-608). (157)</page><page sequence="13">RELIGIOUS THOUGHTS OF AMERICAN AUTHORS 225 A thorough analysis of his religious stance appears in Beverly Suzanne Uphaus, "Mode and Meaning in the Novels of John Updike. " CD. A. /., vol. 37, no. 5, Nov., 1976, pp. 2882-2883-A, no. 76-25 ,467). She emphasizes his concern with dual physical and spiritual realty, and his protagonists' dilemma of devoting themselves to the body, or to the spiritual world understood through faith. A Month of Sundays shows his dependence upon Christian doctrine, and his redefining of the American Christian past, by rejecting the Puritan separation of body and soul. Updike would seem to suggest turning from the "Death of God" attitude, and a tendency toward belief in the necessity of God. Alice Conkright Martin perceives evidence of this in "Toward a Higher Consciousness: A Study of the Novels of Joyce Carol Oates." CD. A. /., vol. 35, no. 8, Feb., 1975, pp. 5415-5416-A, no. 75-2307). "Critics of contemporary literature often argue that since God is dead, tragedy is dead . . . However, Joyce Carol Oates . . . denies that tragedy is dead," because a new definition of God can provide "a new basis for tragedy . . ." She has broken from "the nihilistic existential literature of the earlier years of the century." Search for God may inspire a novelist to create an American Christ figure, ac- cording to Robert M. Slabey in "77ie Catcher in the Rye: Christian Theme and Symbol." (College Language Association Journal , vol. 6, no. 3, Mar., 1963, pp. 170-183, with bibliography in references). Holden Caulfield's spiritual pilgrimage in New York, the great Babylon, takes place in the Christian Advent season, and his journey ends in California. The West is "the lànd from whence the Redeemer will come, bringing light into the darkened world." (See John, ch. 1). Holden sees himself as the Redeemer, a Christ figure, God recovered. IN POETRY AND DRAMA Commentaries reveal various ways in which modern American poets have sought to find God. This quest might be said to have been anticipated by the unorthodox manner of Emily Dickinson, which is reviewed in Joseph Francis Molson: "The 'Forms' of God: A Study of Emily Dickinson's Search for and Test of God." ( D . A ., vol. 26, no. 9, Mar., 1966, pp. 5415-5416-A, no. 65-14,163). Her constant seeking of authentic encounter with God is reflected in themes and imagery of many poems. Her disappointment, that he had not granted her heaven and success in love, impelled her to reject God as Father. She settled for the idea of God as Power, and made immortality a test for the authen- ticity of that idea. Critical literature shows that modern American poets have sought God in ways as peculiar as hers. One appears in George W. Bahkle's The Later Auden (New Brunswick, N. J., Rutgers University Press, 1970). This states that, after he came to the United States, in 1939, his poetry was deeply concerned with the impor- tance of belief in God. He was greatly indebted to the theologians Kierkegaard, Tillich and Reinhold Niebuhr. The process by which a poet found his way to a conception of God is examined in Marvin Ronald Lee: "Robert Lowell's Affirmative Voice." CD. A. /., vol. 35, no. 2, Aug., 1974, p. 1109-A, no. 74-18,574). This detailed study concludes that the poet "moves from an orthodox, transcendent religious affirmation, accord- ing to which the world and its inhabitants are judged harshly, to an immanent af- firmation that brings the poet into closer harmony with man, his world, and ultimately Being itself." (158)</page><page sequence="14">226 HISTORICAL MAGAZINE Ezra Pound's quest seems to end in discovering a pantheon, according to Harry Thomas Pucketťs "Encounter With the Gods: Form and Style in the Poetry of Ezra Pound. " ( D . A. /., vol. 32, no. 8, Feb., 1972, p. 4630-A, no. 72-6823). He traces the poet's progress from conventional Christian belief to "neo-pagan polytheism,' ' abandonment of approach to God through prayer, and "direct perception." "It is in his later vision poems that Pound places himself directly in the presence of his gods, rather than praying to them or singing about them, and in his vision he is able to convey directly a genuine sense of the divine." Another unusual quest has been the subject of disparate conclusions. A favorable view is Charles Daniel Klinger's study, "Some Principles of Meaning and Structure in the Poetry of Hart Crane." (D. A. /., vol. 31, no. 9, Mar., 1971, p. 4775-A, no. 71-6867). One principle is "an impulse to transcend all limitations imposed on the human spirit by time, space, and matter. This impulse issues in a quest for love, mystical vision, and a poetic word cognate with the word of God." Many years earlier the eminent critic, Hyatt Howe Waggoner, thought that this poeťs effort had failed: "Hart Crane's Bridge to Cathay." ( American Literature , vol. 16, no. 2, May, 1944, pp. 115-130) states that Crane "searched for, and sometimes seemed to have found God; but his poems record more of desire than discovery." Crane's uncertainty is balanced by the positive affirmation of Hilda Doolittle, as perceived by Joyce M. Holland in "H. D. The Shape of a Career." ( D . A. /., vol. 35, no. 12, pt. 1, June, 1975, pp. 7906-7907-A, no. 75-12,735). Three lengthy poems ("three dream visions," published in 1944-1946) assert "the real existence of a divinity, of a transcendent unity beyond multiplicity, and ... the real presence of this divinity in the modern world." Christian mystical apprehension of God is perceived in a study by Alexander Norman Hutchison: "The Context of Illumination in the Poetry of Theodore Roethke." ( D . A. /., vol. 36, no. 7, Jan., 1976, p. 4491-A, no. 75-29,664). The author appreciates ". . .the mutual relation in his work between self and world and God ... the authentic relationship between the personal and the divine." Roethke was deeply influenced by Evelyn Underbill's mysticism, but worked out his own idea of man's relation to spiritual, divine reality. One of the most intensely personal searches for a shaping power of divinity is appreciated in a critique by Hugh Pendexter III: "The Religious Question in Robert P. Tristram Coffin's Poetry." ( Colby Library Quarterly ' series 7, no. 2, June, 1965, pp. 61-69, evidently based upon a thesis, "A Critical Study of the Poetry of Robert Peter Tristram Coffin," (D. A., vol. 14, no. 9, 1954, p. 1418, pub. no. 8571, micf. A54-2079). Depending upon experience, his quest was per- sonal rather than theological, set in the framework of his beloved Maine coast. It was colored by his Bible reading, especially in the Old Testament, and sought for "some conscious and intelligent cause" - a creator of the universe. "This sense of fitting into an eternal plan permeates most of Coffin's form poetry." Recent poetry seems to reveal a receptivity to religious myth systems - biblical or otherwise - which could encourage such a supernatural outlook as Coffin's. This appears in Richard H. Behm, "A Study of the Function of Myth in the Work of Four Contemporary Poets: Charles Simie, Galway Kinnell, Gary Snyder, and Robert Duncan." ( D . A. /., vol. 37, no. 8, Feb., 1977, p. 5118-A, no. 77-2688). They have revived certain religious myth systems, and seem to evidence a continuing interest in them in the modern world, which has been thought to have forgotten them. They seek God through mythologies. In modern American drama, Eugene O'Neill and Tennessee Williams are (159)</page><page sequence="15">RELIGIOUS THOUGHTS OF AMERICAN AUTHORS 227 witnesses to the perennial search for God. Since 1960 a succession of studies has firmly established the evidence in O'Neill. Clarence Steven Turner set the theme in "Man's Spiritual Quest in the Plays of Eugene O'Neill. " ( D . A., vol. 23, no. 5, Nov., 1962, pp. 1709-1710, no. 62-4873). This exhaustive study reveals that they reveal a constant, readily discernible and almost consistent pattern in the search for God, although the religious attitudes of his characters range through Chris- tianity, agnosticism and pantheism. There are many citations of the plays, from the earliest to the latest. Other critiques since Turner's drive the theme home. It appears in Rae Dalven's "The Concepts of Greek Tragedy in the Major Plays of Eugene O'Neill." (D. A., vol. 22, no. 12, June, 1962, pp. 4343-4344, no. 62-1462). This asserts that the playwright's main interests are those of the classical Greek dramatists and the biblical religion: the relation between man and God, and the moral order in the universe. Another study sees the dramatist gradually working out a kind of creed in his search: Abram Maurice I. Fiskin, "Eugene O'Neill: The Study of a Developing Creed Through the Medium of Drama." (D. A., vol. 25, no. 8, Feb., 1965, pp. 4697-6498, no. 65-1006). He traces the growth of a philosophical system - "his own Godhunt extending over thirteen productive years," and told through his characters' search for religious meaning. Apparently he saw God in his Christ figures, who reveal divine love through suffering. O'Neill's plays are described as dramas of God-seekers in Knut Dorn 's book, Die Erlösungsthematick Bei Eugene O'Neill: Eine Analyse der Strukturen im Spätwerk (Heidelberg, 1968). Their general theme, in a broad meaning, is seen as salvation, for which the characters yearn - the innocence in which God fashioned them. The dramatist's concepts of the human/God relationship are studied in F. J. Butler's "Eugene O'Neill's Use of Symbolism in Eight Major Experimental Plays." (D. A. /., vol. 34, no. 1, July, 1973, p. 307-A, no. 73-16,801). O'Neill is said to have remarked that "he was acutely conscious of the force behind Life -Fate, God, our biological past - all contributing to the present." A later dramatist has been perceived as a God-seeker, by Esther M. Jackson in The Broken World of Tennessee Williams (Madison, Wis., University of Wiscon- sin Press, [1965]). Her detailed examination of his plays reveals his gradual fashioning of a moral structure. She states that his later works have "taken on more and more of the apparatus of the orthodox Christian search for God." WALLACE STEVENS: POETRY, A SUBSTITUTE FOR GOD? The foregoing poets and dramatists apparently sought, even if not biblical God, then at least some similar divinity above and beyond man and his creations. Some critics insist that Stevens found a god in a creation of the human mind - poetry. Joseph Neill Riddel suggested this idea in "The Never-Ending Medita- tion: A Study of Myth, Metaphor and the Poetry of Order in the Works of Wallace Stevens." ( D . A., vol. 21, no. 3, Sept., 1960, pp. 627-628, no. 60-3256). For Stevens "Poetry is an imaginative manifestation similar to old religious forms, before religion deserted its authentic expression of life and turned, in Christianity, to transcendent realms." The imagination cannot transcend the material world, but can create a spiritual life in it. The creation of a poem is a religious act, a moment of order, a ritualistic gesture. (160)</page><page sequence="16">228 HISTORICAL MAGAZINE A similar argument is presented by Ronald Thomas Swigger: "The Life of the World: A Comparison of Stevens and Rilke." (D. A., vol. 28, no. 9, Mar., 1968, p. 3687- A, no. 68-2367). He claims that both rejected traditional religion as escapist, and stressed the human sources of religious beliefs. "They believed that poetry, as a major source of beliefs, could take the place of religion in the modern world." A strong argument for this thesis is a thorough study by Muriel Smith Savage: "Wallace Stevens: Poetry as Religion." (D. A, vol. 29, no. 7, Jan., 1969, pp. 2280-2281-A, no. 69-1932). She believes that Stevens accepted "a central prin- ciple which is the sole creator of man and world," but not the traditional, anthropomorphic and wholly transcendent God. Man can have a harmonious relationship with this "central mind" through poetry, which becomes a religion and a means of redemption. Doris Leonora Eder explains how Stevens solved the problem of belief in God in a secular age: "Wallace Stevens: The Major Poems." (D. A., vol. 29, no. 12, June, 1969, p. 4482-A, no. 69-7600). She stresses Stevens's concept of a "supreme fiction" - a belief that might prove a valid substitute for the idea of God. The substitute would be poetry - "in an age deprived of that grandest abstraction of the human imagination, God." The complicated process by which Stevens reached his position is explained in a thesis by Adalaide Kirby Morris: "Imagination's Hymns: Christian Metamor- phoses in the Poetry and Thought of Wallace Stevens." ( D . Aģ /., vol. 32, no. 12, pt. 1, June, 1972, p. 6992-A, no. 72-14,341). She indicates that he used inherited Christian forms, symbols and language as "a pattern, perhaps a paradigm, for the poetic religion he hoped to substitute for Christianity." God would be the im- agination, Christ the poet-hero, the Holy Ghost the action of the imagination in human life. Kenneth Ervin Walker seems to summarize this interpretation in "Wallace Stevens' Poetry: A Search for Supreme Truth." ( D . A. /., vol. 34, no. 7, Jan., 1974, p. 4295-A, no. 73-31,974). The conclusion is that the poet rejected tradi- tional religion, and regarded poetry and the imagination "as the means for man's reconciling himself with the universe." His creation of poetry was for him this kind of moral art. JEWISH SEEKERS FOR GOD AND SALVATION No less than authors with a Christian background, those inheriting Jewish religious tradition have agonized through rejection of old orthodoxy, and sought to attain some kind of faith and a concept of God. Irving Malin perceived this problem in his Jews and Americans (Carbondale, 111., Southern Illinois University Press, 1965). He considers Karl Shapiro, Delmore Schwartz, Isaac Rosenfeld, Leslie Fiedler, Saul Bellow, Bernard Malamud, and Philip Roth. As a perceptive reviewer remarked, "although these writers rebel against orthodoxy and seek a substitute faith, some new God, they are concerned with traditional concepts of the Jewish Experience ... In his opinion, they produce their best art when they are directly concerned with their 'Jewishness,' reinterpreting the God of their ancestors; when they are not, they offer less intense and imperfect work." (Review by William Braswell, American Literature , vol. 37, no. 4, Jan., 1966, pp. 510-511). The search for a new concept of God is emphasized in Irving Malin, ed., Con- temporary American- Jewish Literature : Critical Essays (Bloomington, Ind., In- (161)</page><page sequence="17">RELIGIOUS THOUGHTS OF AMERICAN AUTHORS 229 diana University Press [1973]). In Malin' s editorial view American- Jewish authors have a definite religious slant, and should be considered from a theological stance. Jewish literature is created only out of religious concern, and the effort to build a new structure of belief. In a review Allen Haymen asserts that this thesis "will not hold up" for such writers as Malamud, Bellow, Shapiro, and Roth. (American Literature , vol. 48, no. 3, Nov., 1976, pp. 427-428). The brief career of Nathanael West (1904-1910) often has been considered as an example of the American Jewish author's struggle to find a faith and a god in a seemingly faithless world - particularly in his classic, Miss Lonelyhearts. An ex- ample is Robert J. Andreach's "Nathanael West's Miss Lonelyhearts : Between the Dead Pan and the Unborn Christ." (Modern Fiction Studies , vol. 12, no. 2, summer, 1966, pp. 251-260). He relates the novel to pessimistic American "wasteland" literature, and to the conflict between a virile paganism and an ascetic Christianity. "Because Pan can be resurrected only through the violation of one's conscience and Christ can be born only through the violation of one's nature, modern man lives in a wasteland." There is no hope of spiritual rebirth. "The truth most noticeably lacking in West's world is God's grace, which operates toward transforming nature and assisting man in his spiritual growth." This critique sets the general theme for others, which reveal the modern prob- lem of seeking salvation without God. A striking one is Robert I. Edenbaum' s "To Kill God and Build a Church: Nathanael West's Miss Lonelyhearts ." (Col- lege English Association Critic , vol. 19, no. 9, June, 1967, pp. 5-7, 11). The pro- tagonist fails in his effort to use the "Christ dream" to save a suffering world, and has to fall back upon himself, the only real "world within." The result is madness and death. He has searched for a religion and becomes his own church, but there is no triumph of faith and love, no messiah, no salvation. West revealed the sources he used in attempting to solve the problem, says Mar- cus Smith's "Religious Experience in Miss Lonelyhearts ." (Contemporary Literature , vol. 9, no. 2, spring, 1968, pp. 172-188). He stated that his psychological guides were James's Varieties of Religious Experience and Star- buck's Psychology of Religion . A sick soul tries to find redemption, has a Jame- sian conversion experience, and is reborn after alienation, has a mystical ex- perience, and attains a kind of peace - but only in a worldly and pragmatic sense, in Smith's opinion. This picture of religious failure seems to be confirmed by Nora Jeanette Williams Mann: "The Novels of Nathanael West." (D. A., vol. 29, no. 8, Feb., 1969, p. 2716-A, no. 69-3261). "By juxtaposing the traditional religious ex- perience, as described in William James' Varieties of Religious Experience , with the experience of a modern Christ, he writes a modern allegory. The hero's défi- ciences and those of the society are both embodied in his inability to re-enact an universal patterned action, the Christ dream." Laura Mandeli Zaidman thinks that West's four novels sprang from "his per- sonal quest for the American Dream." ("Nathanael West: The Varieties of Religious Experience." D. A. /., vol. 35, no. 7, Jan., 1975, p. 4571-A, no. 75-985). His four questers are contemporary priests with a religious experience. But his characters live in a world inhabited by men who have no religious ex- perience, and so have little hope for a Messianic Age of redemption. Even so, he "affirmed the need for religious experience, whether within or beyond the realm of the Judaic-Christian tradition." The ambiguities and contradictions in his life and work sprang from his ambivalence about his Jewish identity. One critic argues that the novelist saw no hope in the Christian view of salva- (162)</page><page sequence="18">230 HISTORICAL MAGAZINE tion: Stephen Joseph Gerkey, 4 'You Only Have Time to Explode: Technique and Structure in Nathanael West's Narratives." ( D . A. vol. 37, no. 11, May, 1977, pp. 7128-7129-A, no. 77-10,985). He believes that Miss Lonelyhearts is ''examin- ing the tragic face of the absurd and attempting to explode the myth that man can follow in Christ's footsteps to a transcendent, sustaining faith." Failure is seen as the conclusion of the four novels, in Michael Anthony Atheneos's thesis: "Nathanael West: Progressive Pessimist." ( D . A. /., vol. 37, no. 4, Oct., 1976, p. 2177-A, no. 76-23,156). This critic thinks that West was con- vinced of "the failure of Christianity to provide a suitable answer to the problem of human misery." He also denigrated such . alternatives as art, technology, nature worship, and cynicism. His novels emphasize personal and societal failure, but suggest no alteration in the societal structure. A scarcely more hopeful conclusion appears in an estimate of three other Jewish novelists by Ita G. Sheres: "Prophetic and Mystical Manifestations of Ex- ile and Redemption in the Novels of Henry Roth, Bernard Malamud, and Saul Bellow." (D. A. /., vol. 33, no. 11, May, 1973, p. 6375-A, no. 73-7217). The two themes come from Jewish religious sources. The critic does not insist upon "a conscious use" of them, but points out a general pattern related to Jewish biblical and mystical thought. Exile, as in the Old Testament, is the punishment for the people's transgressions, and their redemption is achieved only through God's ac- tion. Exile is a stage on the road to it. But the characters in these authors' novels lack the redemptive framework. Suffering as a way to redemption is the theme in Lois Symons Lewin: "The Theme of Suffering in the work of Bernard Malamud and Saul Bellow." (D. A., vol. 28, no. 12, June, 1968, pp. 5021-5022-A, no. 68-7846). Discussion centers on the sources of suffering in guilt, its mythic components, its connections with alienation and existentialism, and its special relevance to twentieth-century Americans. The Jew becomes the spokesman for Americans (who suffer in their quest for identity), and a metaphor for the human condition. The protagonists are like biblical sufferers - persecuted prophets, Jesus, Job. Suffering is the means of redemption. Criticisms of Bellow present his alienation from prevailing determinism and materialism, and his progression toward belief in God. Such is the view of Robert Roy Dutton in "The Subangelic Vision of Saul Bellow: A Study of his First Six Novels, 1944-1964." (D. A ., vol. 27, no. 5, Nov., 1966, p. 1363-A, no. 66-10,941). He argues that Bellow rejected the long dominance of "deterministic realism," and asserted that "the subangelic nature of man, limited as it is, allows for the existence of dignity, integrity, and equanimity within the human condi- tion." The religious dimension of his work seems to attain expression in Seize the Day , which "relates the story of man's reliance on outer forces to bring significance to his life. It is the story of man's alienation from God, his subse- quent disillusion with materialistic substitutes, and his final illumination that only he can give shape and meaning to his life." Several other critiques agree or disagree, in various ways. An example is Robert H. Fossum's "The Devil and Saul Bellow." ( Comparative Literature Studies, vol. 3, no. 2, 1966, pp. 197-206). This declares that Bellow is not a religious writer in the theological or churchly sense, and is not attracted by the "Death of God" fad. Most of his protagonists are religiously indifferent Jews. He is concerned with spiritual matters, but in the secular sense of man having to work out his own salvation through brotherhood, and accepting responsibility for himself and others. (163)</page><page sequence="19">RELIGIOUS THOUGHTS OF AMERICAN AUTHORS 23 1 Another scholar, Donald William Markos, perceives 4 'The Humanism of Saul Bellow." (D. A, vol. 27, no. 11, May, 1967, p. 3875-A, no. 67-6669). The novelist, he avers, has an affinity with humanism, and the Emersonian transcendentalist idea of man's nobility and divinity, contrary to the literary fashion of considering man as an impotent creature. He shares the humanist's belief in man's potential, and concentrates on the struggle to fulfil it, although he is aware of how naturalistic and vulnerable man's life is. Somewhat the same interpretation appears in John Jacob Clayton's "Saul Bellow: In Defense of Human Dignity." ( D . A, vol. 27, no. 7, Jan., 1967, p. 2147-A, no. 66-14,810). He discusses the sources of Bellow's defense of man against cultural nihilism, in Jewish and American traditions. His heroes are said to approach a "state of grace," trying to escape the burden of guilt and the terror of death through accepting the biblical role of the suffering victim. A later critique goes far beyond this argument, by insisting that the novelist became friendly to the idea of God: Susan Landau Golden, "The Novels of Saul Bellow: A Study in Development." ( D . A /., vol. 36, no. 7, Jan., 1967, pp. 4489-4490-A, no. 75-29,501). She notices "the increasing importance of theism" in his novels, his progression from existentialism to humanism. In his later works a character may have "a somewhat uneasy belief in God," or even a strong belief in His existence. A similar progression has been perceived in the thought of another Jewish novelist, by Jessica Gerson in "Norman Mailer: The Mystical Vision." ( D . A. /., vol. 38, no. 10, Apr., 1978, pp. 6132-6133-A, no. 7803089). She examines the evolution of his philosophy as revealed in his writing since 1948. His world view has moved "from the despairing, half-hearted Marxism of the early novels to an 'existential' viewpoint which is, in fact, deeply permeated by Jewish mysticism." He created his own mystical theology, which finds room for the attainment of saintliness and salvation. It seems that Mailer attained this viewpoint because of his disgust with modern, dehumanized industrial society, which denies love. David Morris Wiener points this out in "The Politics of Love: Norman Mailer's Existential Vision." ( D . A. /., vol. 33, no. 1, July, 1972, p. 334-A, no. 72-20,378). Modern society destroys man's faith in himself and his capacity for love or political action. The individual soul, striving for self-expression, is opposed by anti-natural forces usually associated with Satan. People are engaged in a battle against these forces in order to understand themselves and their relationship to history, and the rebel leads them. Mailer's battle, seen in theological terms, appears also in Victor J. Milne's essay, "Heller's Bologniad: A Theological Perspective of Catch-22 ." ( Critique , vol. 12, no. 2, 1970, pp. 50-69). The novel is an epic, expressing a clash between two opposing ethics: the Christian one of universal benevolence, and the com- petitive, capitalist one, which is unscrupulous. Heller is said to find a religious answer "which is in harmony with classical Protestant doctrine," and the ethical teaching of the theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer. Milne believes that Heller ac- cepted a God who promises the defeat of evil to "the man who is willing to act for the sake of righteousness ... In the last chapter . . . Yossarian and the chaplain discard their vision of the pagan universe of the epic for the Christian faith in a God of salvation ..." Another way of coming to terms with God is expounded in John Dolf Penglase: "Allen Ginsberg: The Flowering Vision of the Heart." ( D . A. /., vol. 36, no. 8, Feb., 1976, p. 5302-A, no. 76-5113). His poem "Kaddish" is inter- (164)</page><page sequence="20">232 HISTORICAL MAGAZINE preted as an attempt to come to grips with insanity, death, and God. He is said to have felt that the alienation and pollution of the modern world had been caused by man's denial of the spiritual side of his nature. Perhaps the most comprehensive comment on the modern dilemma is the writing of a Jewish poet, ac - predated by Theodore Dana Hall: "A Student of the Morning Light: A Sti of the Cultural and Salvational Vision of Delmore Schwartz.' ' (D. A. /., vol. 38, no. 5, Nov., 1977, p. 2788-A, no. 77-24,381). An extensive discussion of his religious position states that he sees "traumatic divi- sion* ' as modern man's condition, and "a terrible conflict between traditional (biblical) and modern (scientific-capitalistic) world views, assumptions, beliefs and values." Selfish ambition is injuring the world, and perverting the American Dream. Salvation lies in universal sympathy and sensitivity. SOUTHERN RELIGIOSITY IN LITERATURE Between the War of 1812 and the Civil War, the South gradually forsook political and religious liberalism and became socially conservative and religiously orthodox. Growing economic dependence upon cotton culture and slave labor discouraged the rationalist political liberalism of the eighteenth-century Enlight- enment. It encouraged the dominance of a culture characterized by evangelical religious orthodoxy and deferential lower social classes. At the same time, in defense of its peculiar institutions, the South became militantly sectional. The shift from liberalism toward conservatism appeard in the writings of three authors discussed by Clarence Peter Walhout in "Religion in the Thought and Fiction of Three Ante-Bellum Southerners: Kennedy, Caruthers, and Simms." (D. A., vol. 25, no. 11, May, 1965, p. 6604, no. 65, 3319). This superbly crafted thesis points out that the three men, living between 1795 and 1871, were most prominent in the first generation of Southern novelists. They reflected three various strains in religious thought, and took divergent attitudes toward growing orthodoxy and sectionalism. Kennedy was among the last exemplars of post- Revolutionary liberalism, and wrote essays expressing rationalistic religious views within the context of liberal Christianity. Rejecting sectarianism and respecting all honest faiths, he depicted religion as important but subordinate, and his aristocratic gentlemen as rationalists. His religion supported the idealization of plantation society, but did not favor slavery and militant sectionalism. Caruthers, a Virginia Scotch-Irishman, was a conservative, orthodox, evangelical Christian. In his novels moral problems were attributed to natural human depravity and solved through faith in Divine Providence. Like Kennedy, he idealized the planta- tion social structure, and did not use religion to defend militant sectionalism. The Charlestonian Simms, the most prominent Southern author, expressed a personal and romantic faith, distrusted rationalism, and despised sectarianism. His novels emphasized, as basically religious, the noble impulses, devotion to duty and loyal- ty to social ties, in the framework of a Southern aristocratic code. He celebrated the Southern ideals and triumphs and became an ardent and militant sectionalist. THE "NEW SOUTH" IN FICTION The society of Kennedy, Caruthers and Simms was shattered by the Civil War. During Reconstruction, a long period of readjustment, for many living was mere- ly "not dying." The intellectual community became partly progressive, looking for a "New South," and partly nostalgic, dwelling on real or fancied past glories. (165)</page><page sequence="21">RELIGIOUS THOUGHTS OF AMERICAN AUTHORS 233 Divergent attitudes are considered critically in James Kimball King's "George Washington Cable and Thomas Nelson Page: Two Literary Approaches to the New South." ( D . A., vol. 25, no. 4, Oct., 1964, pp. 2493-2494, no. 64-10,252). He contrasts Cable's longing for a new Southern society with Page's romantic defense of the ante-bellum social order and culture. Page, he believes, was in- debted to Episcopalian ideals of stewardship and paternalism. He valued classical education and aristocracy, and deplored contemporary commercialism and social instability. (Compare the conservative Anglicanism of James Fenimore Cooper and Edith Wharton N.R.B.) Cable urged his fellow Southerns "to search provin- cialism out of the land as the Hebrew housewife purged her dwelling of leaven on the eve of the Passover." The deep background of Southern mentality, which explains nostalgia and revolt, is explored by James McBride Dabbs, in Haunted by God : The Cultural and Religious Experience of the South (Richmond, Va., [1972]). He depicts a mind dominated by religious, moral and literary concepts derived from the Bible, and its idea of an omnipotent, personal, righteous God. He regards the writings of Eudora Welty and Flannery O'Connor as illustrations of his thesis, which he applies also to other Southern authors. The effect of religion upon modern Southern literature is examined also by Daniel Patrick Bergen's "In Fear of Abstraction: The Southern Response to the North in Twentieth-Century Fiction and Non-Fiction." ( D . A. /., vol. 31, no. 10, April, 1971, p. 5389-A, no. 71-8133). He stresses the non-rationalistic, non-theoretical and earthy Southern religious imagery, as opposed to Northern rationalism. And yet, one critic sees a resemblance to Northern intellectualism in modern Southern fiction. R. M. Weaver's "Contemporary Southern Literature" ( Texas Quarterly , vol. 2, no. 2, summer, 1959, pp. 126-144), compares the "revolt" of Southern novelists to that of revolutionary New England transcendentalists. Both groups rejected a past which seemed oppressive and barren. Various responses to the Southern heritage are described by C. Hugh Holman, Three Modes of Modern Southern Fiction ; Ellen Glasgow , William Faulkner , Thomas Wolfe (Athens, Ga., Univ. of Geprgia Press, 1965, with an annotated bibliography). He indicates the influences of race, geography, climate and religion upon regional fiction: Glasgow's of the Tidewater, Wolfe's of the Pied- mont, and Faulkner's of the Deep South. Southern fiction displays a profounder division (basically religious), according to Harvey Lee Klevar, "The Sacredly Profane and Profanely Sacred: Flannery O'Connor and Erskine Caldwell As In- terpreters of Southern Cultural and Religious Traditons." ( D . A. /., vol. 31, no. 10, April, 1971, pp. 5407-5408-A, no. 71-8245). O'Connor, a religious tradi- tionalist, rejects secular humanism as a distortion of man's spiritual vision. Caldwell casts away Southern religion to favor "humanism as a type of profane salvation." They represent Southern religious and cultural tensions. Regardless of divergent religious attitudes, Southern authors have been search- ing for spiritual values, according to Philip Edward Cioffari, "Major Themes in Southern Fiction Since World War II." ( D . A., vol. 30, no. 10, April, 1970, p. 4402-A, no. 70-7357). He sees a search for individuality, self-assertion, stoicism, honor, and religious faith, in Carson McCullers, Truman Capote, William Styron, Flannery O'Connor, William Humphrey and Robert Penn Warren. Two novelists, who seem to represent the search in a loyal Christian context, are Brainard Cheney and Andrew Lytle. The first is carefully appreciated by Wilton Irving Beauchamp, Jr., in "Look A-Yonder, I See Sunday: A Critical Study of the Novels of Brainard Cheney." ( D . A. /., vol. 38, no. 6, Dec., 1977, p. (166)</page><page sequence="22">234 HISTORICAL MAGAZINE 3494-A, no. 77-25306). Cheney's last two novels are influenced by his conversion to Catholicism - an event fairly common among Southern writers. It is said to have made him aware of "the necessity for man to understand his fallen nature,' ' experience God's grace and find salvation. He came to the conviction by way of viewing primitive nature in southern Georgia as 4 'a mysterious often supernatural force that permeated the lives of the people," who "saw creation as a means of understanding God." Lytle is perceived as a convinced Christian artist in Robert Vernon Weston's critical estimate, "Andrew Lytle's Fiction: A Traditional View." (D. A. /., vol. 33, no. 8, Feb., 1973, p. 4439-A, no. 73-4623). He considers Lytle's fiction as "among the best of contemporary literature," and as representing "a traditional Christian point of view, qualified by the peculiarities of Southern experience and the Southern preoccupation with the family and the land." His greatness as an ar- tist is acknowledged by Charles Chester Clark's dissertation, "The Novels of An- drew Lytle: A Study in the Artistry of Fiction." ( D . A. /., vol. 33, no. 5, Nov., 1972, pp. 2364-2365-A, no. 72-28,333). Clark regards him also as a Christian novelist, not nostalgic like Page and others, and yet writing about typical ex- periences of Southern Christians in traditional agrarian settings. Authors who clung to Christianity were bucking a general rebellion against Southern orthodox religiosity. One who went with the tide was Ellen Glasgow, who rejected religious orthodoxy and "evasive idealism" and accepted deter- ministic pessimism, according to Herbert Weaver Edwards, "A Study of Values in Selected Published Prose of Ellen Glasgow." ( D . A., vol. 22, no. 1, July, 1961, pp. 258-259, no. Mie. 61-318). This judgment is modified in a criticism by Marion Kazmann Richards, "The Development of Ellen Glasgow as a Novelist." (D. A., vol. 22, no. 8, Feb., 1962, pp. 2797-2798, no. 61-5478). She affirms that in her later work Glasgow "tempered" the rejection of traditional Calvinism in her Virginia background. The source of her unorthodoxy is attributed to Charles Darwin by Julius Rowan Raper's "Ellen Glasgow and Darwinism, 1873-1906." (D. A ., vol. 27, no. 8, Feb., 1967, pp. 2541-2542-A. no. 66-14,048). He quotes her statement that The Origin of Species inspired her youthful thinking and early novels, and declares that her fiction reflects the Darwinian concept of conflict between untamed human nature and the social instinct. He considers, however, that eventually she thought that biologic determinism "might be transcended completely through the mystical view of life." But this idea evidently did not temper her unfavorable view of Southern society, according to Beverly Spears Beckham, "The Satire of Ellen Glasgow." ( D . A. /., vol. 33, no. 9, Mar., 1973, p. 5163-A, no. 73-5646). Her satire targeted, particularly, cruelty to persons in the name of religion, also ecclesiasticism, and rigidity and social snobbery in churches. Another Virginian, James Branch Cabell, sympathized with her, says Shirley J. D. Litwhiler in "A Comparative Study of the Chivalric Satire of Ellen Glasgow and James Branch Cabell." ( D . A. /., vol. 37, no. 5, Nov., 1976, p. 2872-A, no. 76-25,692). This detailed critique claims that both spurned the traditional Southern idea of faith and devotion to God. Glasgow's religious attitudes appear in her five "rural novels" written in 1900-1925. (See Nina Edwards Hughes, "Ellen Glasgow and the 'Literature of Place.' " D. A. /., vol. 32, no. 5, Nov., 1971, pp. 2692-2693-A, no. 71-28,055). The breakway from oldtime Southern religiosity appears in other novelists, religiously and politically liberal. One of the rebels is estimated in Clara Childs Mackenzie, "Sarah Barnwell Elliott: A Biography." ( D . A . /., vol. 32, no. 6, (167)</page><page sequence="23">RELIGIOUS THOUGHTS OF AMERICAN AUTHORS 235 Dec., 1971, p. 3259-A, no. 72-7 4). Although her style is said to show the influence of sermon writing, she broke with ante-bellum romatic conservatism. Will N. Harben, a Georgia novelist who flourished between 1888 and 1919, apparently fits into the same pattern. ( See James K. Murphy, 4 'Will N. Harben: His Literary Life and Works." D. A . /., vol. 35, no. 6, Dec., 1974, p. 3758-A, no. 74-29,182). His North Georgia local color stories often depict people in rebellion against nar- row social or dogmatic religious ideas. He was tormented by "conflict between traditional orthodoxy and personal character." Erskine Caldwell is regarded as a "deliberate deflator of the legend of the Old South," by James Edward Devlin's "The Fiction of Erskine Caldwell." (D. A. /., vol. 37, no. 3, Sept., 1976, p. 1546-A, no. 76-20,380). He is regarded as a naturalist and determinist, alienated from belief in a benevolent God, and describing the coarseness of ordinary folk. Another critical realist is Thomas S. Stribling, closely analyzed in two theses: Edward Joseph Piacentino, "The Southern Novels of T. S. Stribling." ( D . A. /., vol. 34, no. 9, Mar., 1974, p. 5986-A, no. 74-5959) and Martha E. O. Overholser, "T. S. Stribling: A Study in Contrasts" ( D . A. /., vol. 34, no. 7, Jan., 1974, p. 421 3-A, no. 73-32,647). The first sees his seven novels (1922-1934) as satirizing the provincial Southern evangelistic religion, which he considered as commercialized by a materialistic ethic. The second also notices his attack upon the materialistic modern church "in contrast with its avowed purpose of spirituality." Stribling' s essay "Theism for Atheists" is an attempt to prove the existence of God and immortality of the soul in materialistic terms. Literary attack on a romanticized South undertook to demolish such ideas as the bucolic poor white, the ladylike heroine, and the ideal of gentility. The first is considered in Sylvia Jenkins Cook, "The Literary Treatment of the Southern Poor White in the 1930's." (D. A. /., vol. 34, no. 4, Oct., 1973, p. 1899-A, no. 73-24,546). She points out that the religious "quaint and devout peasant" of the post-Civil War, local-color sentimentalists became a potential revolutionist in the imagination of radical novelists. But the poor whites, while being deromanti- cized, didn't buy the communist utopia! Literary rebels were more successful in banishing the magnolia-scented heroine. Such is the contention of Marie Fletch- er's "The Southern Heroine in the Fiction of Representative Southern Women Writers, 1850-1960." (D. A, vol. 24, no. 3, Sept., 1963, pp. 1159-1160, no. 63-6217). She includes 15 authors, and claims that religious faith has declined as a quality of the heroine. The blonde angel, who appealed to people of traditional Southern religious background, has vanished. And violence more and more has displaced gentility, according to Louise Young Gossett, "Violence in Recent Southern Fiction." ( D . A., vol. 23, no. 1, July, 1962, pp. 233-234, no. 62-2206, published as a book, Durham, N. C., 1965). The author attributes increasing violence partly to the Calvinistic idea that man is prone to irrationality and evil. FAULKNER'S CRITIQUE OF THE CALVINIST CLOSED SOCIETY In a public address Faulkner once said that he was brought up in the religious, biblical atmosphere of Mississippi Methodism. Southern religion was a part of his nature, which he could not escape, even though he despised and rejected its deca- dent and stultifying features. The great novelist could have referred also to his reading as an evidence of religious concern. It is clear in Joseph Blotner's William Faulkner's Library , A Catalog (Charlottesville, Va., 1964, with bibliographical (168)</page><page sequence="24">236 HISTORICAL MAGAZINE footnotes, and a list of book purchases and orders, 1922-27). There are many references to the Bible, religion in general, and Christianity. Faulkner's relation to Southern religiosity has been obvious to his biographers, as in Hyatt H. Waggoner's William Faulkner : From Jefferson to the World (Lex- ington, Ky., 1959). The novelist, he wrote, grew up in 4 'a kind of theocracy," and knew its strength and weaknesses, and its preachiness, of which Faulkner had his own share. The theocracy inherited its religion from John Calvin, states J. Robert Barth in "Faulkner and the Calvinist Tradition." ( Thought , vol. 39, no. 152, spring, 1964, pp. 100-120, with bibliography in footnotes). He analyzes Faulkner's work as part of the Calvinist literary tradition, particularly its theme of predestination. But Faulkner's outlook was not hopeless, for he perceived the redemptive quality in Christianity's teaching that man can overcome evil and at- tain human dignity. Some critics, however, are disposed to depreciate the Christian orientation of Faulkner. An example is Clarence P. Walhout's essay, "The Earth is the Lord's: Religion in Faulkner." ( Christian Scholar's Review, vol. 4, no. 1, summer, 1974, pp. 26-35, with bibliography in notes). He attributes the novelist's religious ex- perience to "consciousness of the mythic and the mystical qualities of nature rather than the consciousness of God." The earth is the Lord's in a secular rather than a biblical sense. In partial agreement with this view is John Brown Rosen- man's dissertation, "As I Lay Dying: A Study of the Poor White in Faulkner." CD. A. /., vol. 31, no. 11, May, 1971, pp. 6069-6070-A, no. 71-10,861). This in- dicates that Faulkner used pagan and Southern as well as Christian myths "to dramatize the ceaseless 'now' of existence." At least one analyst has suspected that, while Faulkner was surrounded and influenced by Southern religiosity, he had little contact or sympathy with popular piety. ( See Elmo Howell, "Faulkner's Country Church: A Note on 'Shingles for the Lord,' " Mississippi Quarterly , vol. 21, no. 3, summer, 1968, pp. 205-210). Faulkner is perceived as of the upper class in a small town, socially above the rural masses, distrustful of formal religion and evangelical theology, and inclined to ridicule country piety. His own "theology" was far too complex for the rural church. This is perfectly clear in John Wesley Hunt's William Faulkner ; Art in Theological Tension (Syracuse, N. Y., 1965, with bibliographical footnotes). This is a study of The Sound and the Fury, Absalom , Absalom! and The Bear. It claims that Faulkner had a precise, coherent, complex theological vision of God's relation to man and the natural order, and man's meaning and experience. His theology mingles stoic and Christian ideas and values. Other Faulkner students have seen general resemblance to the thought of cer- tain modern theologians. So does Carrel Dee McLaughlin, in "Religion in Yoknapatawpha County." ( D . A ., vol. 23, no. 8, Feb., 1963, pp. 2915-2916, no. 63-1164). He likens Faulkner's view to Paul Tillich's definition of religion as "ultimate concern," but admits that he cannot be "sharply placed in any category of doctrinal or philosophical adherence." He was sensitive to religious values, and drew symbols from the Old Testament and Passion Week, and seems to share the views of Christian existentialism. But this was an eclectic, unclassifiable approach. Another scholar suggests a sympathy between Faulkner and Reinhold Niebuhr. (See Robert J. Trobaugh, "The Nature of Man in the Writings of Reinhold Niebuhr and William Faulkner," D. A vol. 27, no. 5, Nov., 1966, pp. 1441-1442-A, no. 66-1 1,005). The bond was part of "the renewed dialogue which has emerged between artists and theologians." Faulkner shares Niebuhr's (169)</page><page sequence="25">RELIGIOUS THOUGHTS OF AMERICAN AUTHORS 237 "analysis of idolatry, injustice, and self-deceit," but fails to accept the great theologian's trust in man's ability to overcome evil completely, because Faulkner took "an excessively deterministic approach to man's vices." Whatever one may think of alleged resemblances between his thought and that of influential theologians, it has seemed obvious to one scholar that Faulkner re- jected the old rationalist conventions. This is the opinion of Martha Nochimson's "Against the Limitations of Rationalism: Undercurrents in the Works of William Faulkner." ( D . A. /., vol. 37, no. 3, Sept., 1976, p. 1551-A, no. 76-20,846). She avers that he rejected rational, idealistic Christian morality and materialist theory as false, "destructive evasions of immediate life," and irrelevant. Some critics maintain that Faulkner did not repudiate basic Christian values, but spurned their debasement by Southern Calvinistic society. Charles Thomas Gregory says as much in his "Darkness To Appall: Destructive Designs and Pat- terns in Some Characters of William Faulkner." ( D . A, vol. 30, no. 4, Oct., 1969, pp. 1565-1566-A, no. 69-15,672). In the Yoknapatawpha novels religion ap- pears as an external piety, which hides internal corruption and is destructive because it denies the real values of religion. In Light In August many characters display a lack of Christian generosity, and are strict, misguided, loveless fanatics. Ike McCaslin finds personal redemption by becoming a carpenter, like Christ, and not joining any church - so expressing Faulkner's rejection of formal religion. Rejection of degenerated, institutional Christianity is noticed by Sister Mary Euda Byrne's "From Tradition to Technique: Development of Character in Joyce and Faulkner." ( D . A., vol. 29, no. 9, Mar., 1969, p. 3091-A, no. 69-4688). She points out that the novelist's traditional, Southern agrarian Protestantism presents a real "image of man and the world in totality," as opposed to "present paradoxes in degenerated and institutionalized Christianity." Faulkner's secular outlook could assume dimensions of religiosity, even though he rejected what seemed to him a corrupted faith. Faulkner's religious thought is far more complex than that of almost any other American novelist. This fact was due to an eclectic religious background, as ap- pears in Stanley Lawrence Elkin's "Religious Themes and Symbolism in the Novels of William Faulkner." (D. A., vol. 22, no. 10, April, 1962, pp. 3659-3660, no. 62-590). His mother, a Baptist, joined her husband's Methodist church. Faulkner attended a Methodist Sunday school and annual revival meetings at a camp ground, and became familiar with Southern Protestant fundamentalism. He was married in a Presbyterian church, and later became affiliated with his wife's Episcopalianism. These diverse religious environments are said to be ac- curately portrayed in his novels. His vocabulary reveals religious influence, and he often uses biblical and church imagery. He was preoccupied with some domi- nant religious themes, and his method of characterization "suggests the awe and wonder of the religious imagination at work." All his religious themes are associated with some concept of suffering. He is deeply concerned with personal reactions to evil, and in depicting the struggle with it, frequently uses biblical ar- chetypes, especially Job and Jesus. His idea of God is ambivalent, depicting him as both compassionate and malevolent. Another comprehensive view of Faulkner's religious eclecticism is J. Robert Barth, ed., Religious Perspectives in Faulkner's Fiction; Yoknapatawpha and Beyond ( Univ. of Notre Dame Press, South Bend, Ind., 1972, with bibliography). Essays by twelve critics center on his religious dimensions, and include Barth's commentaries. They reveal Faulkner's complex moral vision, his place in the (170)</page><page sequence="26">238 HISTORICAL MAGAZINE history of American Puritanism, and his use of several Western religious tradi- tions. Recurring themes are the religious dimensions of freedom and fate, Faulkner's use of myth, and human redemption through suffering. A valuable guide to the novelist's religious background and thought is George K. Smart's Religious Elements in Faulkner* s Early Novels: A Selective Concor- dance. (Coral Gables, Fla. [1965]). This is alphabetically arranged by titles, and consists chiefly of passages from Soldiers* Pay, Mosquitoes , and Sartoris , which represent the novelist's references to religious themes, characters, etc. Faulkner's ambivalent attitude toward his religious heritage appears in studies of individual writings. Philip Edward Pastore supplies such a comment in "The Structure and Meaning of William Faulkner's A Fable ." CD. A., vol. 31, no. 1, July, 1970, pp. 397-398-A, no. 70-12,255). He interprets the work in terms of Henri Bergson' s The Two Sources of Morality and Religion , with its idea of in- telligence and intuition as conflicting modes of interpreting and ordering ex- perience. A Fable shows this "dialectic" in the conflict between two characters. The Corporal represents Bergson' s true mystic and intuition, open society which seeks universal brotherhood, and a "dynamic religion" without historical prece- dent, ritual and rational verbalism. The Marshal represents intelligence, a closed society, and the static religion of historic Christianity and its clergy. The author implies that the conflict troubled all of Faulkner's fiction. Two comments on Light in August reveal how deeply the novelist was in- fluenced by the Southern Calvinistic religious inheritance. Ilse D. Lind, "The Calvinistic Burden of Light in August " (New England Quarterly , vol. 30, no. 3, Sept., 1957, pp. 307-329) agrees with other critics that Calvinistic Puritanism is a dominant theme in the novel, but avers that they have not fully studied its revela- tion of the relations between religion and repression. The thesis emphasizes the depressing effect of Calvinistic fanaticism, and its results in brutality and death by mob violence. Faulkner condemned Calvinism, but apparently could not see that the modern South offered any other religious authority. A similar view appears in Alwyn Berland, " Light in August : The Calvinism of William Faulkner." ( Modern Fiction Studies , vol. 8, no. 2, summer, 1962, pp. 159-170). The argument is that "Faulkner creates a Calvinist world in order to re- ject its doctrine at the same time that the novel exhibits Faulkner's unconscious but continuing adherence to Calvinism as an attitude, a limiting frame to vision, and emotional set." Faulkner's Calvinism was not a creed, but a "cultural residue" which he disliked but could not entirely reject, because he accepted the idea of human depravity. Another reference to Light in August suggests that the repressive Calvinist religious society appeared to Faulkner as the source of grotesque characters. (See Edward Depriest Clark, "Six Grotesques in Three Faulkner Novels," D. A. /., vol. 33, no. 1, July, 1972, p. 302-A, no. 72-20,317). Joanna Burden fails in her ef- forts to shake off the guilt arising from her hatred of blacks, by benevolence to their colleges and social agencies, because her religion is not benevolent. The result is a twisted, grotesque personality. The Calvinist doctrine of determinism, which permeated Southern mentality, deeply troubled Faulkner, as appears in a notable essay on As I Lay Dying : Charles Palliser, "Fate and Madness: The Deterministic Vision of Darl Bundren" (American Literature , vol. 49, no. 4, Jan., 1978, pp. 619-633). He argues that Faulkner wanted to make it clear that the novel rests upon the Calvinist doctrine of inexorable divine providence. The society of the Bundrens believed that "the lot of mankind is a continuous struggle against sin for possession of the soul in a (171)</page><page sequence="27">RELIGIOUS THOUGHTS OF AMERICAN AUTHORS 239 world in which God ordains the existence of evil in order to test the individual's faith.' ' At least one critic has seen Faulkner's inherited Calvinist preoccupation, with the struggle against evil, as a characteristic he shared with Hawthorne: Theodore Lewis Colson, 4 'The Characters of Hawthorne and Faulkner: A Typology of Sin- ners." (D. A ., vol. 28, no. 6, Dec., 1967, pp. 2204-2205-A, no. 67-15,608). He discerns no direct influence of Hawthorne, but indicates a common concern of the authors about sin and guilt, and the quest to attain the state of Unfällen man -all evidence of a common Calvinist Puritan heritage. Both were deeply con- cerned with the religious problem of alienation from God and man through wrong-doing. A general similarity of Faulkner's concern about guilt and innocence with that of Melville is evident in Lewis Franklin Archer's study, 4 'Coleridge's Definition of the Poet and the Works of Herman Melville and William Faulkner." (D. A.t vol. 28, no. 5, Nov., 1967, pp. 1810-181 1-A, no. 67-14,370). This sees the two novelists as romantic poets calling for "a transformation of the old order into new possibilities for life." Both were in revolt against a decadent Puritan (Calvinist) world, and against the idea of a meaningless innocence, supposed to result from the conquest of sin and guilt. They looked for a 4 'new form of in- noncence," which "permits a man to live in the world while accepting the ever- present extremes of light and dark: good and evil, success and failure, life and death." While accepting and rejecting the Southern religious heritage, Faulkner strove for a religious outlook that would "make sense." So says Edward J. Corridori in "The Quest for Sacred Space: Setting in the Novels of William Faulkner." (D. A. vol. 38, no. 9, Mar., 1972, p. 5224-A, no. 72-9251). He sees the novelist, in revolt against a decadent tradition, seeking to escape from chaos, ex- ploring the relation between man and the cosmos, struggling "for orientation or faith in an external order." This is a consistent theme in Faulkner's work. It did not mean, however, that he had abandoned the Christian idea of "last things" -eschatology. Such is the argument of Margaret Mary Mulvehill Culley in "Eschatological Thought in Faulkner's Yoknapatawpha Novels." ( D . A. /., vol. 33, no. 9, Mar., 1973, p. 5167-A, no. 73-6810). She holds that Faulkner creates a world with a genesis and a definite ending, the latter determined by "the Judeo- Christian mythology which was his heritage," dealing with death, judgment, heaven and hell. But he envisioned the outcome as the kingdom not of God but of man. He secularized the biblical idea of eschatology and made it contemporary and human. WOLFE'S QUEST FOR GOD Thomas Wolfe's life and art display the modern Southern novelist's usual ex- posure to formal religion, and then disenchantment with it. His experience resembles Faulkner's, and his attempt to find an answer appears in James Terry Plunkett, "The Quest for a Father-God in the Fiction of Thomas Wolfe." (D. A. y vol. 31, July, 1970, p. 399-A, no. 70-1836). This critique alleges that, because of a feeling of insecurity due to his supposed absence of a cosmic deity, Wolfe created an ideal, human father-god. That image combined the Southern Calvinist sovereign and authoritative God with a gentle, benevolent humanistic one. Plunkett sees Wolfe's life as a series of unsatisfactory relations with father- gods -an experience he shared with other modern American authors. (172)</page><page sequence="28">240 HISTORICAL MAGAZINE WARREN'S SEARCH FOR A CHRISTIAN ETHIC Faulkner was only one of several Southern authors who rejected inherited traditional religiosity, and tried to formulate a personal faith. Such a seeker is depicted in Wallace Anson Clinton Williams, "Religious Ethics in the Writings of Robert Penn Warren. " ( D . A ., vol. 35, no. 8, Feb., 1975, p. 5519-A, no. 75-4067). This biography stresses his devout Methodist family heritage, and the Kentucky "Bible-belt culture,' ' which he respected but could not entirely accept. It discusses Warren's view of history as "the drama of the past that corrects us," his image of man as free and morally responsible, and his concept of life as a "search for self." Warren's view of man "is very similar to ideas in the Bible, Kierkegaard, and Reinhold Neibuhr," and his thought developed "toward posi- tions quite similar to Christianity," although he was no orthodox believer. Several critics suggest that Warren's search for life's meaning caused a conflict between inherited Christianity and modern existential philosophy. This idea is developed in Helen Elizabeth Ellis, "Sunday School and Sartre - The Tension in Robert Penn Warren's Novels." ( D . A. /., vol. 34, no. 7, Jan., 1974, pp. 4257-4258-A, no. 73-31,080). The search of his characters for meaning is both ex- istential and religious, and raises a conflict between faith and skepticism. Warren shows the Christian concern about sin, virtue and redemption, but also pictures man as isolated in Sartre's sense, and forced to work out his own salvation apart from God. Another critic who relates Warren to existentialism is Barnett Guttenberg. His Web of Being: The Novels of Robert Penn Warren (Nashville, Tenn., 1975) regards Heidegger's existentialism as a way of defining Warren's "quest for selfhood." But he considers that Warren was more greatly influenced by the Christian conversion experience. Does this mean that the seeker must be rescued from sin? Sam Hynes says so, in "Robert Penn Warren: The Symbolic Journey." ( University of Kansas City Review , vol. 17, summer, 1951, pp. 279-285). He states that Warren's central theme is the necessity of accepting the biblical idea of original sin. His characters illustrate man's withdrawal from God and his return. This implies that man hungers for "a moral imperative to guide him in this * God-abandoned universe.' " George John Jabol so argues in "Robert Penn Warren: Philosopher-Novelist." ( D . A. /., vol. 37, no. 10, April, 1977, pp. 6485-6486- A, no. 77-7946). Warren is said to have intended to supply the rule in his fiction, even though his philosophy decried such "abstractionism." Perhaps the clearest summary of Warren's position is in Marden J. Clark, "Religious Im- plications in the Novels of Robert Penn Warren." ( Brigham Young University Studies , vol. 4, autumn, 1961, pp. 67-69). He finds Warren's religious significance in his concern with the problem of free will and determinism, evil in human experience, and man's imperfect nature. For him religion was an emo- tional experience, grounded in self-knowledge and responsibility. He affirmed the basic Christian values - love, human communion, and loss of self in a higher good. WALKER PERCY: ALIENATION AND LOVE The conflict, between Southern religion and modern existentialism and aliena- tion, appears in the fiction of Roman Catholic Walker Percy. He is viewed as "an inheritor of the Kierkegaardian Catholic existentialist tradition or as an embodi- ment of a modern Southern sensibility." {See Jay Paul Telotte, "To Talk (173)</page><page sequence="29">RELIGIOUS THOUGHTS OF AMERICAN AUTHORS 241 Creatively: A Study of the Writings of Walker Percy." ( D . A. /., vol. 37, no. 10, April, 1977, pp. 6489-6490-A, no. 77-8229). Like many Faulkner characters, his usually are physically and spiritually isolated, alienated from their fellow men and incapable of a reconciliation with God. The conclusion is that the oldtime religion is dead, and a new one is powerless to be born. This is not the only way of estimating Percy. If oldtime religion is not viable, and existentialism holds no hope, there may be a new kind of Christianity. Michael McConnell Cass professes to discern it, in 4 'Stages on the South's Way: Walker Percy's The Moviegoer zná The Last Gentleman ." (DĒ A. /., vol. 32, no. 7, Jan., 1972, p. 3992-A, no. 72-3022). He claims that 4 'Percy's novels offer a Christian style as a possible and redemptive third stage on the South' s way." The new Christianity is not formal and dogmatic, but one of love for others - hopeful, not stoically pessimistic like Calvinism. Percy's characters may still use inherited theological language, as in Love in the Ruins. ( See James Robert Mack, "Love and Marriage in Walker Percy's Novels." D. A. /., vol. 37, no. 7, Jan., 1977, pp. 4355-4356-A, no. 77-974). This novel presents marriage as a "sacramental unity," described "in explicit theological language," and seen as solving the problem of living in community "in the commonplace, but real world." Percy's fundamentally Christian view- point is briefly appreciated in an essay by Ormonde Plater, "Walker Percy, Novelist and Christian." (The Living Church , vol. 182, no. 19, May 10, 1981, pp. 10-11). The novelist has acidly described contemporary Western society as only nominally Christian, constantly offending human dignity and sanctity. Yet his characters, in search of themselves, are on a pilgrimage from a fallen world to one redeemed in an apocalyptic way. FLANNERY O'CONNOR, TAKE HEAVEN BY VIOLENCE Probably no novelist has appreciated the religious and moral agony of the Calvinistic South, in such vivid style, as has the Catholic Flannery O'Connor. This explains the swelling tide of criticism of her novels. One source of her in- terest appears in Zohara Mushinsky Boyd's study, "The Literary Apprenticeship of Flannery O'Connor." (D. A. /., vol. 38, no. 4, oct., 1977, p. 2120-A, no. 77-21,982). This attributes her concern about religion, and her compassion for the human condition, to participation in the Writers' Workshop at the University of Iowa. There was a deeper wellspring, revealed by Samuel Chase Coale V in "The Role of the South in the Fiction of William Faulkner, Carson McCullers, Flannery O'Connor, and William Styron." ( D . A. /., vol. 31, no. 12, June, 1971, pp. 6596-6597- A, no. 71-13,848). He notes that her environment was the "Bible- belt" South, and her writing an allegorical examination of God's grace working in that society. The estimate of her fiction as basically Christian has few exceptions, such as John T. O'Brien's "The Un-Christianity of Flannery O'Connor," in Listening , vol. 5, winter, 1971, pp. 71-81. It is generally conceded that she was seriously con- cerned with religious faith, even though her theology is not consistent and simplistic. Such is the opinion of Bobbye Green Au in "The Dragon by the Side of the Road: A Study of the Fiction of Flannery O'Connor." ( D . A. /., vol. 37, no. 10, April, 1977, p. 6482-A, no. 77-7703). It is said, that her characters' quest for grace and salvation is confused by "human limitation and fallibility in the presence of an ugly and grotesque physical reality." That reality inspired her (174)</page><page sequence="30">242 HISTORICAL MAGAZINE violence, grotesquerie, irony and grim comedy - features which she did not regard as incongruous with her theology. The violence was not peculiar, but characteristic of much contemporary fic- tion. ( See Robert Edward Golden, "Violence and Art in Postwar American Literature: A Study of O'Connor, Kosinski, Hawkes, and Pynchon," in D. A. /., vol. 33, no. 1, July, 1972, p. 311-A, no. 72-18,813). In The Violent Bear It Away, "violence is a sign of religious commitment," an assertion of freedom from "sterile rationalism' ' and "manipulation." In young Tarwater its physical, spec- tacular character eventually is displaced by "the interior violence of prophecy and religious commitment . ' ' That O'Connor uses the grotesque for a religious purpose, is explained in Robert Max Rechnitz, "Perception, Identity, and the Grotesque: A Study of Three Southern Writers." ( D . A ., vol. 28, no. 6, Dec., 1967, p. 2261-A, no. 67-15,055). He asserts that in her novels "characters may be prompted to con- front themselves because their grotesque perceptions force them to realize they are not operating as integrated personalities." The grotesque suggests that they are not genuine, and O'Connor's religious vision perceives them as in need of redemption and salvation. In spite of violence and grotesquerie, it is possible to consider O'Connor as a Christian humanist, and David Eggenschwiler does in The Christian Humanism of Flannery O'Connor (Detroit, Wayne State University Press, 1972). This study is based largely upon extensive analysis of Wise Blood and The Violent Bear It Away. He sees her religious approach, to isolation from man and God, as that of the Christian humanist, interested in redemption from fear of freedom and demonic commitment to materialism. One critic perceives O'Connor's answer to alienation in Christian love. (See Suzanne Thomas Allen, "The Mind and Heart of Love: Eros and Agape in the Fiction of Flannery O'Connor." (D. A. /., vol. 38, no. 12, Pt. 1, June, 1978, p. 7330-A, no. 7807226). The ultimate meaning of life is found in people united in the Mystical Body of Christ, and in communion between persons - an idea which fits into "the Southern Christian framework of her fiction." ( See references to O'Connor in "The Catholic Revival"). THE SOUTHERN POET: ART, TRUTH AND GOODNESS Southern poets have experienced troubles due to transition from an agrarian and Christian past to modern industrialism, materialism, and religious skepticism or indifference. This is evident especially in those who endured the Civil War, and tried to keep their religious faith. Their experience is considered by James Ran- dolph Loney in "The Poetry and Poetics of Henry Timrod, Paul Hamilton Hayne, and Sidney Lanier: An Essay on Art and Community in the Nineteenth- Century South." (D. A. /., vol. 38, no. 8, Feb., 1978, pp. 4829-4830-A, no. 7730524). All, he declares, were well-aware of their Southern orthodox Christian heritage. They conceived works of art as revealing truth and goodness, the world as revealing matter and spirit. Their spiritual interpretation of the universe was modified by keen appreciation of human finitude and imperfection - the old Christian sense of man's imperfection. Their essentially Christian attitude passed to a succeeding generation of poets, "The Fugitives." They associated it with Southern agrarian ideology and loyalty to tradition. The theorist of the new poetry is appreciated by Carol Lee Ann Saf- fioti, "Beyond Time: The Imperative of the Past in the Works of Allen Tate." (175)</page><page sequence="31">RELIGIOUS THOUGHTS OF AMERICAN AUTHORS 243 (D. A. /., vol. 37, no. 3, Sept., 1976, p. 1555-A, no. 76-20,373). From examining his essay, "Religion and the Old South," this critic concludes that Tate is "an ar- tist outstanding for his image of modern man as the product of the forces of tradition.'' He views contemporary American society as based upon "classical culture, Christian tradition, European history, American heritage, and ancestral identity." One of Tate's contemporaries elaborated this philosophy, according to Emory B. Elliot, Jr.: "Theology and Agrarian Ideology in the Critical Theory of John Crowe Ransom." (Xavier University Studies , vol. 10, no. 3, winter, 1971, pp. 1-7). He points out that in God Without Thunder (1930) Ransom rejected science and naturalism. He desired a return to the idea of a concrete, personal God "as a necessity for the stable, political, economic and social situation that he desires for America." Like several contemporary Southern authors, he did not expect religion to flourish in an industrial society, and preferred an agrarian one. They all thought that an agrarian society would be friendly to the idea of a divinely created world. This is suggested by Louis D. Rubin, Jr.: "The Concept of Nature in Modern Southern Poetry." (American Quarterly , vol. 9, spring, 1957, pp. 63-71). The leading "Fugitives" in their poems described the world of nature as created by God for all eternity. How man should relate to this world, is the main theme of a group of poets who emerged at Black Mountain College, N.C., in 1950-1956. Their general philosophy is discussed by Frankland Wilmot Davey in "Theory and Practice in the Black Mountain Poets: Robert Duncan, Charles Olson, and Robert Greeley." (D. A. y vol. 29, no. 1, July, 1968, p. 256-A, no. 68-10,225). They are said to believe that one should live according to the reality he sees in the universe, which is a process beyond human control, whether divinely ordained or not. BLACK LITERATURE: THE NEGRO BETWEEN TWO WORLDS It is commonplace to say that, especially since "emancipation," American blacks have experienced a conflict between African heritage - "black is beautiful" - and white Christian culture, to which they are expected to conform. The strain has been aggravated by a huge migration into urban environment. There they have been wrenched loose from protective influences of a Southern agrarian society, oriented to church and family. They have been economically obliged to conform to a new culture, while trying to preserve some comforting features of the old one. Those who observe and study them often wonder: Is the American black an Anglo-American Protestant with a dark skin, or still an African living in a white-controlled society, but not quite of it? The question has been reflected in black fiction and poetry. Black writings often display varied heritages - African culture and Christian biblical nurture. The first of these elements is assessed by Thomas Richard Holland in "Vestiges of African Culture in Afro- American Literature: A Preliminary Study." (D. A. /., vol. 34, no. 7, Jan., 1974, p. 4265-A, no. 74-606). He considers the mingling of African religion, Caribbean cults, and the American "Black Church," and gives as an example Baldwin's Go Tell It on the Mountain. Bontemps' Black Thunder illustrates the relation between Neo-African religion and political radicalism. Study of Africanism is comparatively new, but the influence of biblical Chris- tianity upon black American literature has long been recognized, especially in the theme, quest for freedom. Conclusions of the research are summarized by Ernest (176)</page><page sequence="32">244 HISTORICAL MAGAZINE Marvin Bradford's 4 'Biblical Metaphors of Bondage and Liberation in Black Writing: A Study of the Evolution of Black Liberation as Mediated in Writing Based on the Bible. " ( D . A. /., vol. 37, no. 5, Nov., 1976, pp. 2868-2869-A, no. 76-25,858). This discussion includes Phyllis Wheatley, David Walker, W. E. B. DuBois, James Baldwin and Albert Cleage. It asserts that black writers have found in the Bible a 4 'lineage of freedom in its account of emancipation of the Hebrews,' ' and discusses racist exegesis of the Bible. This pervasive theme is illustrated by studies of antebellum slave narratives, as in Cynthia Janis Smith, "Escape and Quest in the Literature of Black Americans.,, (D. A. /., vol. 36, no. 1, July, 1975, p. 287-A, no. 75-15,357). The narratives show that the first major source of literary metaphor was the Bible. Flight was compared to the Hebrew exodus and the pursuit of salvation through Christ. The vocabulary of an alien religion perfectly met the needs of black fugitives. Biblical imagery and blacks' observance of white practical religion were in conflict, a central issue in the work of Jean Toomer, Richard Wright, James Baldwin, and LeRoi Jones. The theme is pursued by Welvin Winfred Dixon's "Historical Vision and Personal Witness in American Slave Literature." ( D . A. /., vol. 37, no. 1, July, 1976, pp. 307-308-A, no. 76-15,625). The slaves' "religious syncretism" inspired spirituals and narratives, and an "imagery of spiritual redemption." Slaves became "children of God" and had conversion ex- periences, religious or secular. This study is based upon slave narratives, spirituals, and editions of folk and religious songs. A successor of slave narratives is modern autobiography, which is studied in Stephen Thomas Butter field, "Black Autobiography: The Development of Iden- tity, Language, and Viewpoint from Douglas to Jackson." (D. A. /., vol. 33, no. 9, Mar., 1973, pp. 51 14-51 15-A, no. 73-5532). Brief comment on religion reveals the clash of black identity with white culture. Narrators believed that, as anti- slavery Christians, they were "purifying a religion that had been corrupted by the white man giving it a political content." Tragic loss of cultural identity involves religion, according to Mary Elizabeth Mebane, "The Family in the Works of Charles W. Chesnutt and Selected Works of Richard Wright." (D. A. /., vol. 34, no. 9, Mar., 1974, pp. 5982-5983-A, no. 74-5948). This emphasizes a situation in modern black fiction: trouble in the nor- thern black urban family, pulled away from the soil and the church. DILEMMAS OF THE BLACK NOVELIST A love-hate relationship between black authors and religion is evident in many novels since the "Black Renaissance" of the 1920s. References to this theme ap- pear in Robert A. Bone, The Negro Novel in America (New Haven, 1965, revised ed., with an extensive bibliography). Rejection of the black Christian heritage often has made the preacher a whipping boy, as appears in Ronald Gerald Palosaari, "The Image of the Black Minister in the Black Novel From Dunbar to Baldwin." ( D . A. I., vol. 32, no. 1, July, 1971, pp. 394-395-A, no. 71-18,794). The portrait generally is highly unfavorable, even when some novelists concede some benefits of religious faith. They usually spurn the parson's distasteful racial role, and often dubious moral character. The frequent result of rejection is to abandon Christianity for some other religious or quasi-religious conviction. An example appears in Jerome Edward Thornton's "James Baldwin and the Christian Tradition." ( D . A. /., vol. 37, no. 8, Feb., 1977, pp. 5130-5131-A, no. 77-3590). Baldwin moved from his Christian (177)</page><page sequence="33">RELIGIOUS THOUGHTS OF AMERICAN AUTHORS 245 background to "a profound belief in a humanitarian agnosticism,' ' but still used literary 4 'religious insignia.' ' Like many Negroes, he lost an early sense of security and had to find another. For a time, says Edward Merica Jackson, Baldwin made religion a surrogate father. ( See his "Fathers and Sons: An Analysis of the Writings of James Baldwin." D. A. /., vol. 37, no. 4, Oct., 1976, p. 2181-A, no. 76-18,525). The evidence appears in Go Tell it on the Mountain and The Amen Corner. But the father could also be art, music or acting. The "religious insignia" which Baldwin used to color his writing are indicated in a detailed study by John Willie Roberts. "The Uses and Functions of Afro- American Folk and Popular Music in the Fiction of James Baldwin." ( D . A. I., vol. 37, no. 8, Feb., 1977, p. 5126-A, no. 77-2488). He employed religious music, folk sermons and religious conversion rituals. Go Tell It on the Mountain has become a symbol of Baldwin's debt to black religion. Shirley S. Allen provides an example in "Religious Symbolism and Psychic Reality in Baldwin's Go Tell It on the Mountain. (College Langauge Association Journal , vol. 19, no. 2, Dec., 1975, pp. 173-199, with reference in footnotes). This notes that critics generally have misinterpreted the novel, because they have missed the pervasive religious symbolism, allusion to the Bible, and Christian ritual, which were essential in his background. The hero's redemp- tion from fear and oppression is related in biblical terms. Baldwin's use of religious myth is appreciated also by Doris Lowene Nelson in "The Contem- porary American Family Novel: A Study in Metaphor." ( D . A. /., vol. 31, no. 6, Dec., 1970, p. 2929-A, no. 70-25,052). Again, Go Tell It on the Mountain is the example, with its "combining the Old Testament concept of a chosen people in bondage with the New Testament concept of sin and redemption to create a powerful and ironic metaphor for the position of the Negro race in America." There are varying opinions regarding Baldwin's view of resort to religion as a response to oppression. William Martin Burke claims that in Go Tell It .. . the novelist found it wanting. (See his "Modern Black Fiction and the Literature of Oppression," D. A. /., vol. 32, no. 11, May, 1972, p. 6415-A, no. 72-14,716). Another view is evident in Clifford Doyl Harper, "A Study of the Disunity Theme in the Afro- American Experience: An Examination of Five Representative Novels." ( D . A. /., vol. 34, no. 8, Feb., 1974, p. 5 102- A, no. 74-2419). Although Baldwin depicts religion as unliberating, he makes John return to the church "as the only possible means of survival." The distortion of religion can be an element of disunion in the family. Esther Alexander Terry has noted that Richard Wright rejected the base that supported Baldwin's American black culture, deeply rooted in the Old Testament and the communal black church. (See her "The Long and Unaccomplished Dream of Richard Wright," D. A. /., vol. 35, no. 1, July, 1974, p. 420-A, no. 74-15,045). Wright's Black Boy reveals alienation from his family's religion, without realizing that their "fanaticism" was a help in surviving. A more op- timistic view prevails in Raman Kumar Singh, "Richard Wright: Novelist of Ideas." (D. A. /., vol. 32, no. 6, Dec., 1971, p. 3332-A, no. 72-1946). His three ideas are seen as Marxism, Existentialism and Christianity, the last examined in Fire and Cloud, Bright and Morning Star, Native Son, The Outsider, and Man, God Ain't Like That. One critic has perceived the difference between Wright, black rebel, and Jewish rebel, Malamud. (Evelyn Gross Avery, "Rebels and Victims: The Fiction of Richard Wright and Bernard Malamud," D. A. /., vol. 37, no. 9, Mar., 1977, p. 5822-A, no. 77-4698). Malamud's characters find support in the religious concept (178)</page><page sequence="34">246 HISTORICAL MAGAZINE of a chosen people as a guide to purpose and action. Wright's live in a naturalistic world without freedom and dignity, and become alienated rebels without direc- tion. A common topic of black fiction writers is corruption of Christianity by op- pressive white society. It became constant in the work of Langston Hughes, ac- cording to George Earlen Franklin Hall, "Recurrent Themes in the Novels and Short Fiction of Langston Hughes.' ' ( D . A. /., vol. 36, no. 9, Mar., 1976, p. 6098- A, no. 76-5680). He depicts Christ and his Gospel as trapped in churches and hypocrisy, and contrasts contemporary Christianity with what he believes it should be. This Hebrew prophetic note is said to sound clearly in the dramatist Paul Goodman. ( See Louis Dunster Becker, " 'I Light Fires. No One Comes.' The Creative Literature of Paul Goodman." D. A. /., vol. 33, no. 11, May, 1973, p. 6340-A, no. 73-12,175). A key to his writing is the use of Jonah to warn the na- tion of the doom awaiting wrong-doing. The profoundly religious nature of Negro quest for identity appears in Jean Toomer (1896-1967), who for many years lived among black people in Georgia. He became a religious mystic, influenced by Quakerism and the mystic Georges I. Gurdjieff. His work is carefully studied by Michael J. Krásny, "Jean Toomer and the Quest for Consciousness." ( D . A. /., vol. 32, no. 12, Pt. 1, June, 1972, p. 6982- A, no. 72-13,098). His search for consciousness is explained in From Exile Into Being , and included meditation upon the experience of his people. This is ex- plained by Louise Blackwell, "Jean Toomer' s Cane and Biblical Myth," in Col- lege Language Association Journal , vol. 17, no. 4, June, 1974, pp. 535-542. Toomer identified American blacks with the Hebrews wandering in the wilderness, more poetically than any other author, and in a frankly biblical style. Cane sums up the tragedy that befalls the Negro when uprooted from Southern soil and transplanted to the city. This is evident in an analysis by Charles W. Scruggs, "The Mark of Cain and the Redemption of Art: A Study in Theme and Structure of Jean Toomer's Cane (American Literature , vol., 44, no. 2, May, 1972, pp. 276-291). Toomer uses Cain as "a symbol of the African in a hostile land," a slave tilling the earth without enjoying its fruits, but deriving spiritual nourishment from it. When he moves to the city, he is spiritually uprooted. POETRY AND AFFIRMATION OF BLACKNESS Ever since the black learned to express his religion in song, his poetry has voiced a longing for freedom and dignity. A convincing treatment of this subject is Harold Edward Pinkston, Sr., "Religious and Ethical Sensitivity and Ontology Implicit in Content and Style of Selected Black Poetry." ( D . A. /., vol. 32, no. 6, Dec., 1971, p. 3414-A, no. 71-31,047). Blacks in the spiritual celebrated the God who delivered the Israelites. Poets have rejected institutionalized white Chris- tianity, and used poetry to express their consciousness of black dignity. In so doing they developed their own theology, which is expounded by Hycel Berman Taylor in " 'Black English' and Christian Faith: A Poetic Theology of Black Christian Culture in America." ( D . A. vol. 31, no. 10, April, 1971, p. 5514-A, no. 71-7889). Both Christian and non-Christian black poets can be theologically interpreted to reveal the American black as chosen by God to be liberated. The chosen language is "black English" to express God's liberating ac- tivity. An historically oriented critique of American black poetry is Jean Wagner's Les Poètes Negres des Etats-Unis : Le Sentiment Racial et Religieux dans la Poesie (179)</page><page sequence="35">RELIGIOUS THOUGHTS OF AMERICAN AUTHORS 247 de P. L. Dunbar a L. Hughes (1890-1940), Paris, 1963. This stresses the in- terdependence of racial and religious feeling, and the ambivalence of the poets' world view, traceable to a basic conflict between Christianity and slavery and segregation. Feeling against the white man's oppression has been aimed at his God. That the picture is not all negative appears in William Harold Hansell, 4 'Positive Themes in the Poetry of Four Negroes: Claude McKay, Countee Cullen, Langston Hughes, and Gwendolyn Brooks." ( D . A. /., vol. 33, no. 2, Aug., 1972, p. 754-A, no. 72-18,981). He observes that white and black commen- tators have stressed the oppressive side of American black life, and neglected preservation of black values, and creative accomplishments. The creative impulse is seen, particularly, in Countee Cullen, whose life and poetry were profoundly influenced by Christian faith. This theme is further emphasized in Lawrence Rubin, "The Castaways: A Study of Three Poets of the Negro Renaissance." (D. A. /., vol. 34, no. 10, April, 1974, p. 6658-A, no. 74-8208). Cullen tried to remedy the pain of being black through his ideal of the beautiful, and in his long poem, The Black Christy which states a religious faith exalting blackness. Cullen reached his solution with struggle, says Alan Robert Shucard, "The Poetry of Countee P. Cullen." CD. A. /., vol. 31, no. 11, May, 1971, p. 6070-A, no. 71-11,458). The poet shows early ambivalence between "white" Christianity and African paganism, and gradual acceptance of Christianity, along with resignation to the black status. To one critic racial pride seems stronger than religion. (Isaac William Brumfield, "Race Consciousness in the Poetry and Fic- tion of Countee Cullen," D . A. vol. 38, no. 6, Dec., 1977, p. 3496-A, no. 77-26,639). He sees religion as a part of race consciousness, and believes that the conflict between religion and racial pride makes black American identity "enigmatic." The Black Christ successfully resolves the conflict; One Way to Heaven is less effective. Another seeker took a more difficult road, according to Sister M. James Con- roy, "Claude McKay: Negro Poet and Novelist." ( D . A ., vol. 29, no. 9, Mar., 1969, pp. 3129-3130-A, no. 69-4058). She notes his search for religious certainty and peace, for "a supernatural agency capable of ensuring racial equality, which separated him from the institutional church of his youth, led him from agnosticism to communism, and culminated in his conversion to Catholicism in 1944." The reason for his conversion appears in Thomas Sutton, "Threefold Vi- sion in the Works of Claude McKay." ( D . A. /., vol. 36, no. 5, Nov., 1975, pp. 2813-2814-A. no. 15-25,421). "He placed his last hope for Western civilization in the moral authority of Roman Catholicism, an institution which, he believed, transcended individual men, nations, and civilizations."
