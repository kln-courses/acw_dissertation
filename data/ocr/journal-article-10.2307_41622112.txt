Authors should note these changes when preparing their manuscripts for submission. For further details on the submission of papers and the preparation of papers for publication, authors are requested to consult and follow the latest Guidelines for Authors which are available online at www.arabianseminar.org.uk. Quotations, single words, and phrases from Arabic, or other languages written in non-Roman alphabets, are transliterated according to the systems set out below. • Personal names, toponyms and other words which have entered English or French in a particular form, should be used in that form when they occur in an English or French sentence, unless they are part of a quotation in the original language, or of a correctly transliterated name or phrase. In the latter cases, they should be correctly transliterated, even when they occur in an English or French sentence. • Names of sites, archaeological periods, types of pottery, which have entered archaeological usage in a particular form should be used in that form: Umm an-Nar, Julfar ware, Mleiha, Rumeila, etc. (see Guidelines for Authors for more details). The transliteration systems are as follows: (a) Arabic A * э Z j à dh iß sh -k z ti q и n (dh) (sh) b £ h j г и-« s t c ^ к e h ^ t ¿ kh j z d £ gh J / j w (kh) Í Ш th (th) * d о» s [J-» i |_^ £ _i m y_ • Vowels: a i u ä T û. Diphthongs aw ay. • Initial hamzah is omitted. • The lãm of the article is not assimilated before the 'sun letters', thus al-shams not ash-shams. • The hamzat al-wasl of the article should be shown after vowels except after the preposition //-, as in the Arabic script, e.g. wa- 7 - wazïr, fl 'l-bayt, but li-1-wazïr. • Ta1 marbütah i}) should be rendered -ah, except in a construct: e.g. birkah, zakãh , and birkat al-sibãhah , zakãt al-fitr. (b) Ancient North and South Arabian Consonants: 3 b t t b g b d d r z s1 s2 s3 s d t ? c g f q к l m n h w y (c) Other Semitic languages appear in the transliteration systems outlined in the Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research 226 (1986), p. 3. (d) Persian, Urdu, and Ottoman Turkish as for Arabic with the additional letters transliterated according to the system in the Encyclopaedia of Islam (Third Edition) except that z is used instead of zh. These instructions are available online at www.brill.nl/ AuthorsInstructions/EI3P.pdf with information about the transliteration of Persian, Ottoman Turkish, modern Turkish, and Urdu on p. 5 of this document. Note on Fonts Electronic versions of papers being submitted for publication should be submitted in Times Semitic New 12-point font if at all possible, with double-line spacing on A4-paper size and with 2.54 cm margins all round.
