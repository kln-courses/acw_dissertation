The minotaur stands in front of a background of running blue and gold, in which sky and ground seem to meld together. He glances out at us with a look of guilty apprehension in his piercing eyes, which seem as human as his hands. This painting is among the most shock- ing and the most outstanding in Maggi Hambling's exhibition of recent pictures of people, animals, landscapes, mythological and religious subjects (Serpentine Gallery, to 22nd November). Hambling has long shown an exemplary skill as a draughts- woman; but this new body of pictures con- firms her as an artist of great imaginative depths and unexpected stature. Hambling was born in Sudbury, Gains- borough's home-town, in 1945, and she spent her childhood in Hadleigh, in Con- stable country. Hambling's Head of Christ (1986) now hangs in Hadleigh church. While still at school, she took her paintings to the nearby 'Artists' House', home of Cedric Morris and Lett Haines; soon, she became one of their pupils. Haines, in par- ticular, taught her to have confidence in her pwn imagination. Later, she continued her studies at Camberwell, under Robert Medley and for a short time in the 1960s her figures resembled his fractured forms. Although Medley's stylistic influences were later much less apparent, he - like Haines - undoubtedly exerted a more general ef- fect on her development as an artist. Hambling went to the Slade School in 1967; there she reacted against the rich British imaginative and empirical traditions which had, in various ways, played their part in her early development. A confused period of environmental and conceptual work followed; but it was inevitable that an artist possessed of such considerable gifts would soon return to drawing and painting. In 1972, she began to paint people; her portrait heads of this time were reminiscent of those early pictures by David Hockney which contain traces of child art, and of Francis Bacon's savage viewpoint. Hambling moved towards a more per- sonal vision when she focused on one sitter, Frances Rose, an elderly neighbour. The Frances Rose pictures began to address themselves to one of the central concerns of Hambling's maturity: the search for a way of painting 'fallen' modern men and women without resorting to the monstrous, but reaching beyond the limits of empiri- cism. Her paintings of the mid 1970s re- vealed a sympathy with human frailty and impoverishment; but they did not always escape a certain murkiness of colour and handling, as if the content was constraining the form: her more visionary sentiments seemed split off into fantasy and mythical subjects like the Garden of Eden, now at Petworth House. A deepening and a broadening of Hambling's vision occurred in 1977, after she visited Madrid to study Goya; her 66. Minotaur surprised while eating, by Maggi Hambling. 1986-87. 144.7 by 121.9 cm. (Exh. Serpentine Gallery, London). British roots were nourished by her sense of her place within a wider European cul- ture. This was perhaps confirmed by the time she spent as the National Gallery's first 'Artist-in-Residence', in 1980-81. Her best known works of this period were the series of paintings and drawings she made of the comedian Max Wall, exhibited at the National Portrait Gallery in 1983. The Max Wall paintings combined a sense of' the mundane - of the absurdity, sadness and vulnerability of human life - with vivid images of the transforming power of reverie, wit, illusion, and imagination, suggested by the magical wreaths and wisps of cigarette smoke, like something from a genie's lamp, that appear again and again in these pictures. It was as if Frances Rose had strayed into paradise garden! And yet, despite the poignancy of these works, even the best of them seemed infected with a note of sentimentality; this was apparent as much in drawing and gestures (which sometimes veered towards caricature) as in the subject, that of the old, smoking clown whose heart bleeds. Certainly, the paintings Hambling has produced in the last four years, which form this Serpentine exhibition, show a more confident fusion of imaginative and empiri- cal elements than anything she has pre- viously achieved. Some of her pictures of people, such as Untitled (1986) hark back to earlier modes: this harrowing work shows a tramp lying prostrate among the rubbish in the street. The awkward handling of the figure offers no glimpse of anything beyond the dreadful mortality revealed to US. But with Hambling's sunrises, matters are different. These works stem from a small painting she made, on the spot, in Suffolk in 1984; for a long time the work hung at the bottom of her bed before she decided to make a much bigger version of it. This proved to be the first of a series of pictures of sunrises, painted with a brilliance, at times even a stridency, quite new in her work: they show the moment when, quite literally, night shrivels, and the living dark- ness is itself subsumed by light and colour (Fig.67). A series of bull-fight paintings form the inverse of the sunrises - in both mood and form. In pictures like Fallen bull (1985), Dead bull (1987), or Fifth bull, the often bizarre location of the brute black mass of the dead or dying creature threatens to swallow up all the colour and life around it; this repeated ritual of death becomes a pictorial 'negative' of the diurnal resurrec- tion of the dawn. It is not my wish to imply that Maggi Hambling is an artist of the stature of Bacon, or of Rothko; and yet the union of natural and formal symbolism in these sun- rise and bull-fight pictures suggests that she is looking for ways beyond the limi- tations of distorted physicalism, or engulf- ing vacuity. The most achieved pictures in this exhibition indicate that she is find- ing some sort of aesthetic solution in the re- plenishment of mythical painting. Minotaur surprised while eating and Pasiphae and the bull (1987) are paintings of an exemplary strength which etch themselves immediately and indelibly into the imagination of the viewer.

The monstrous creatures and acts depicted associate the carnal appetites of men and women, red in hoof and claw, with the brutishness of the beasts. An im- portant clue to these pictures may be pro- vided by the seemingly innocent painting of a cow's head, Welsh black heifer: selfportrait (1986) where the anthropomorphism, in- tense yet veiled, resembles that to be found in Landseer's finest stag pictures. And yet, in the eyes of the flesh-devouring minotaur, himself, we glimpse something other than appetite; Keats noticed that, when he caught the eyes of a stoat, or even a field mouse, in the withered grass of a field, 'the creature hath a purpose and its eyes are bright with it'. We never see this glint of intention in, say, Bacon's monstrously pulverised faces. That all is not lost is confirmed by the way in which, in both Hambling's mythological works, the luminous and aureate backgrounds of burning gold verge on the numinous mists of abstraction, and yet also recall the re- demptive splendours of the dawn paintings. Hambling can be said to be concerned in a secular way with the perennial prob- lems of evil and the fall, with the idea of a vicarious sacrifice, and (in the absence of God) with such hints and glints of redemp- tion as the worlds of nature, imagination, and aesthetic experience, can provide. Not surprisingly, one of her most remark- able paintings to date, Christ in Venice (1987; Fig.68), consists of a dramatic re- interpretation of a scene from the Passion. The sombre black and purple background recalls the void ofRothko's wine-dark seas; but the raised-up body of Christ suggests the harrowing and uneasy hedonism of later Titian, whom Hambling had been studying in Venice just before she painted this picture. The frail body of Jesus rises above the grimacing crowd which bears him towards his death and reminds us of the fallen world of the modern grotesque - that caricatured and ignoble 'realism', through which, as unbelievers, we have hitherto seemed compelled to confront ourselves. We might say that everything depicted is all too human; but it is not less than that. Hambling's painting offers hints if not of salvation, in any miraculous or other- worldly sense, at least of ethical and spiri- tual hope; and, with a growing confidence, she is finding original plastic and icono- graphic forms appropriate to this vision.
