<plain_text><page sequence="1">Time Structures: A Reading of Poems by Morike, Rilke and Benn JAMES ROLLESTON It is hardly a revelation to speak of the prominence of time as an originating force in modern poetry. Since at least Fritz Strich's book of 1922' we have been aware of the dominant significance of history and temporality in the texture of romantic thinking; and the omnipresence of the theme of melancholy and "Verganglichkeit" in 19th-century poetry, especially of the second rank, is a critical commonplace. My argument is concerned with neither of those subjects, although it offers ways of linking them. What I want to demonstrate, through examination of specific texts, is the structural force of the time-experience, the pos- sibility that through it a balance, a transforming mutuality, of self and world can be achieved. Both self and world have a built-in tendency to withdraw from each other, to retreat within their own systems: the lyric text is fuelled by the imperative need to counteract this tendency, to achieve both the celebration of world and an escape from the ever- threatening sterility of the self. With Heinz Schlaffer I see the modern time-experience as essentially post-romantic; even as they inaugurated temporality as the basic epistemological principle, the romantics re- mained temperamentally within an older, more generalized cosmology.2 But already in Heine's "Still ist die Nacht, es ruhen die Gassen" (from Die Heimkehr, 1824) we enter a world where the experience of time draws the human mind inward to the details of otherwise commonplace emotions and ordinary domestic surroundings. The negativity of the experience seems overwhelming; the romantic beliefs in history and "Progressivitat" collapse into fixation on pastness and loss, with a cul- minating disaster in the Doppelganger-experience itself: man confronts his image in the mirror and the one element in his life that had seemed to link him with community and meaning, namely temporal continuity, has become a mockery and an emptiness. The mirror-experience taunts the poem's speaker, transforming time into an hallucination uprooting man from a stable world that derides him. And yet it can only be within this seemingly negative dimension that any kind of mutual reinforcement of self and world can be imagined. Just how narrow the aperture is through which a temporal self can reach a temporal world is conveyed by a juxtaposition of Eduard Morike's 403</page><page sequence="2">404 JAMES ROLLESTON infrequent poetological remarks. In an 1832 letter he writes: "Immer werde ich mich wohl . .. auf eigene Erfindung des Stoffes zuriickgewie- sen sehen, da vom Vorhandenen selten etwas in meinen Kram taugt. .. ."3 And in a fragment from the same year we read: "Es ist, um es mit einem Wort zu sagen, ein krankhaftes Bestreben, die Imagina- tion zum einzigen Organ alles inneren Lebens zu erheben."4 The self is the sole source of experience; yet, as soon as the self is conceived as singular and empirical, its inadequacy as a structural principle becomes evident. The slippage of the epistemological "Ich" of Fichte and the ro- mantics towards a purely private, fragmented universe must at all costs be reversed. The task of the self is both to invent the world and be in- vented by that world. And amid all the forces that are propelling self and world away from each other, the one precarious linking factor is time. Die schOne Buche (1842) Eduard M6rike Ganz verborgen im Wald kenn ich ein Plaitzchen, da stehet Eine Buche, man sieht schOner im Bilde sie nicht. Rein und glatt, in gediegenem Wuchs erhebt sie sich einzeln, Keiner der Nachbarn rtihrt ihr an den seidenen Schmuck. Rings, soweit sein Gezweig der stattliche Baum ausbreitet, Grilnet der Rasen, das Aug still zu erquicken, umher; Gleich nach allen Seiten umzirkt er den Stamm in der Mitte; Kunstlos schuf die Natur selber dies liebliche Rund. Zartes Gebtisch umkrainzet es erst; hochstaimmige Btiume Folgend in dichtem Gedraing, wehren dem himmlischen Blau. Neben der dunkleren Fillle des Eichbaums wieget die Birke Ihr jungfrauliches Haupt schuichtern im goldenen Licht. Nur wo, verdeckt vom Felsen, der Ful3steig jaih sich hinabschlingt, Lasset die Hellung mich ahnen das offene Feld. - Als ich unlaingst einsam, von neuen Gestalten des Sommers Ab dem Pfade gelockt, dort im Gebtisch mich verlor. Fiuhrt' ein freundlicher Geist, des Hains auflauschende Gottheit, Hier mich zum erstenmal, plotzlich, den Staunenden ein. Welch Entziicken! Es war um die hohe Stunde des Mittags, Lautlos alles, es schwieg selber der Vogel im Laub. Und ich zauderte noch, auf den zierlichen Teppich zu treten; Festlich empfing er den Fuss, leise beschritt ich ihn nur. Jetzo, gelehnt an den Stamm (er tragt sein breite~ GewOlbe Nicht zu hoch), lie13 ich rundum die Augen erzehn, Wo den beschatteten Kreis die feurig strahlende Sonne, Fast gleich messend umher, salumte mit blendendem Rand. Aber ich stand und rtihrte mich nicht; daimonischer Stille, Unergrtindlicher Ruh lauschte mein innerer Sinn. Eingeschlossen mit dir in diesem sonnigen Zauber- Giirtel, o Einsamkeit, ftihlt ich und dachte nur dich! Many of MOrike's greatest poems are of course explicitly concerned with time; but I have chosen for discussion a text, "Die schOne Buche," that appears more relaxed and stylized, with its fusion of precise detail and the rhythmic formalism of the traditional idyll." However, the word "Bild" evokes the mirror-dimension, the threat of the double, already</page><page sequence="3">Time Structures in Poems 405 in the poem's second line: this term is a characteristic "marker" in MOrike, bringing in the artist's perspective here with deceptive casual- ness. "Bild" names the precarious meeting-point of self and world: on the one hand it brings into the foreground the elaborate mediating process whereby the being of the tree is reconstructed in verbal imagery. But on the other hand the phrase, "man sieht schoner im Bilde sie nicht," reminds the reader that our conceptions of beauty are reflected back by us onto their nominal source, nature itself. Nature's provocation of the aesthetic and man's urge for the dynamics of organic process pursue each other, yet the mutual pursuit can only end, so it would seem, in the artifice of word and image. Morike's poem is devoted to breaking this vicious circle, and the first step is to bring the circle into being as a circle of perfection. Through the entire evocation of the tree and its magic circle, Morike keeps the anthropomorphic implications of his images clearly in front of the reader. "Rein," "Nachbarn," "stattlich," "das Aug still zu erquicken," and of course the central para- dox, "kunstlos:" there is no line in which we are not reminded of the organizing human sensibility. And in one crucial respect, the nature of the tree itself, MOrike goes further than he need in aligning his imagery with the human realm. For in spite of or perhaps because of the stylized language, the tree sounds very like an artist. It is the accumulation of details that point in this direction. For the first four lines its isolation is evoked, but thereafter it does not seem isolated at all: there is no ten- sion in this, merely the suggestion of an analogy with the artist's isolation at the center of a world of things summoning him to responsibility. This impression is heightened by the inactivity of the tree from line 5 onwards: the reader's perspective becomes gradually aligned with the tree's, the elements of the circle are displayed moving outwards from the tree's cen- ter, and the details become richer the further we move from the tree itself. The tree seems to observe and to organize, but to lack any special qualities of its own that might explain its powers. Above all, it is of moderate height. It is the task of other, "hochstammige Baume," to ward off the sun. This phrase "wehren dem himmlischen Blau" comes as a gentle climax to a series of verbs that give the only clue to the tree's mysterious power. After the opening, seemingly static words "kenn" and "sieht" we are given nothing but verbs of process. Even as the poet announces the regularity of a picture, he initiates the process of breaking through the frame: "erhebt," "rUihrt," "ausbreitet," "gril- net," "schuf," "umkranzet," "folgend"-all these verbs imply motion or change, drawing the temporal dimension into every detail of the pic- ture. The tree's secret lies in its magical coordination of many different time-rhythms. And in the very completion of the circle, with the verb "wehren," the text moves beyond it. The artist-tree has reached the limit of its reflective powers and opens itself to the poet-observer at the very point where it seems to exclude him. For the poet is aware of the funda- mental source of energy and growth, the sun. The sun enters the poem gradually, its paradoxes carefully modulated: chaotic in itself, it is the source of all time-scales; impossible to look at,</page><page sequence="4">406 JAMES ROLLESTON it yet defines all space. It is the poet's ability to grasp these paradoxes reflectively that finally enables him to enter the tree's circle. The first effect of the sun, however, is to expel him from it. The circle achieves linguistic completion with the phrase "im goldenen Licht," a phrase that invokes the harmonious light bathing the perfect picture; and the word "Hellung" in the next couplet names the effect of the sun as that which surrounds the picture with openness, unmediated light, and thrusts the poet into it with the sudden sharpness of the word "jah." The verb "wehren" has already hinted at the sun's destructive power; what happens at the empty center of this poem, as the footpath plunges downwards and away, is a double exile for the poet. He is both irrelevant to nature's own perfection and, because of his intense involvement with the images of that perfection, confronted with a fundamental force, the sun, intent upon obliterating all the artifices set up to establish human temporality. "Distanz ist das Gesetz dieser Darstellung," says Renate von Heyde- brand, 8 and the gulf between the two halves of the poem, so carefully disguised by the stylized meter, is immense. With the change of tense, the already formal poem seems to cross the line into a new genre, the epic. These lines are full of story. Between the "Fuf3steig" of line 13 and the "Pfad" of line 16 lies a compressed evocation of whole epics of human experience: there is the suggestion of medieval temptation in "ge- lockt," the Dantesque existential crisis of "im Gebtisch mich verlor." Above all there is the move downward and off-center, as "Ab dem Pfade" echoes "hinabschlingt." As the sun can obliterate human time from outside, so the inner self can lose all sense of structure from within. And such loss of self is the very opposite of entry into nature, it is the path to madness and death. In terms of the poem's time-scale the period of loss is really larger than the three lines in the middle suggest. As I noted earlier, from line 5 onwards we begin to move outwards from the tree itself, as the tree claims for itself in ever greater detail the role of artist. There is thus a genuine epic retardation in the gradual return of the poet from functionless exile to the tree, finally consummated in the phrase "Jetzo, gelehnt an den Stamm." This journey is only nominally spatial: what the distance inherent in the tense-change allows us to per- ceive is that the poet, like the tree and yet most unlike it, is able to regain his role as poet only through his ability to organize and blend a multitude of temporal rhythms. This recovery takes place first through a deployment of the powers of language rooted in tradition and myth. What seemed like a limitation in the first part, the intrusion of linguistic categories on nature, now becomes a proud virtue as the hints of epic loss are transformed into explicit images of epic recovery. We know that the empirical path to the tree-circle leads upward, but the language tells us so symbolically, as the poet climbs from Inferno to Paradise: the Goddess looks up, the poet looks up at the sky and at the silent birds. And the festive upward motion takes place in a landscape now peopled with the figures of man's imagination, spirits and divinities both pantheistic and rococo. Most</page><page sequence="5">Time Structures in Poems 407 important, the sun itself is drawn into this invocation of mythology: it is Pan's hour, "die hohe Stunde des Mittags." If the poet's first achievement is the joyous opening up of the traditions implicit in his language, his most important claim to the regaining of his title is as tamer of the sun. As he steps up to the tree trunk, he also enters into a sym- metrical alignment with the sun, now invisible overhead. At this moment we are reminded of the moderate size of the tree, its human scale-and the sun itself is now unleashed as the agency behind this aesthetic ful- fillment. It is "feurig strahlend," "blendend," yet its effect, when mediated by the poet and tree now in perfect consort, is "fast gleich messend." The destructive force has been overcome, and on this new level of totality the sun is no longer a danger to be fended off but the fundamental source of power that reinforces, as on a sundial, the tem- poral meeting of man and nature. The poet's final posture is remarkable. Where the whole poem has hitherto been characterized by process and movement, he now claims entry, as it were, into the motionless intensity of the tree's inner con- centric rings; after the poet's reflectiveness imposed the dynamics of human time onto the tree, the tree has now communicated its self- contained stillness to the poet. Only in their achieved meeting can the world be said to bring its full play of forces into being. And as the poet becomes one with the tree, he explicitly ceases to focus on it and enters upon a new level of openness. One must be careful not to place too much stress on the invocation to "Einsamkeit," which belongs in the tradition of the idyll; but for the first time a conceptual abstraction is admitted to the poem's language, and one, moreover, which recalls the "einzeln" of line 3 and the "einsam" of line 15 at the precise moment when poet and tree have achieved community. This makes possible a broadening of the very notion of community, as the poem's dialectic enables the speaker to address "Einsamkeit" in the second person. Clearly, in this word is concentrated the poem's eritire temporal interplay: "Einsam- keit" is not a state of being but a process with a beginning and an end: the beginning is the emancipation of self from the mirror and from the half-measures of existence, the end is the full entry into the world's crea- tive process, the attainment of mutuality and balance between self and world. The evocation of a past vision completes the circle of the present and permits the poet to look once again in the mirror, to look at himself "alone," and to see his mirror filled with the fruits of his own risk- taking, the rhythmic world that has emerged from the chasm at the poem's center.7 Just as the range of experience in the poetic self seems extended, through the interlocking rhythms of human and natural time, far beyond the limits of a 30-line poem, so the actual events expand their resonance through a structure of recurrence and glimpse. The sealing off of the tree-circle at the outset is followed by an abrupt distancing and change of perspective, whereupon the circle is gradually reconstituted, by means of very similar images subtly intensified. It is like an epic of memory and forgetting within a barely existent narrative space; and this festive</page><page sequence="6">408 JAMES ROLLESTON restoration of equilibrium is punctuated by a series of glimpses, denoted by words like "jah" and "plotzlich," of time-dimensions not initially part of the recurrence-patterning, but enriching it as they are drawn in. The use of genre-effects also extends the poem's range. The poem reaches a conclusion that could be called quintessentially lyrical, as the self faces the mirror of isolation without terror. But to get to that point the poem must pass through an elaborate blend of other genres, other kinds of time. As the poet evokes the tree circle it becomes a theater, a coordinated play of forces of which he can only be the spectator; and as the exiled spectator moves to the center of attention, the genre shifts to epic and meter is deployed to convey the tension of linear advance. The goal of the "story," of course, is reentry into the theater, which itself is transformed into a place of lyric completion. The distension and recycling of the time-dimension has brought into being a genuine spatial certainty. This is a world that is, in Rilke's terminology, anchored in ongoing "Verwandlung." Todes-Erfahrung (1907) Rainer Maria Rilke Wir wissen nichts von diesem Hingehn, das nicht mit uns teilt. Wir haben keinen Grund, Bewunderung und Liebe oder Hass dem Tod zu zeigen, den ein Maskenmund tragischer Klage wunderlich entstellt. Noch ist die Welt voll Rollen, die wir spielen. Solang wir sorgen, ob wir auch gefielen, spielt auch der Tod, obwohl er nicht gefallt. Doch als du gingst, da brach in diese Bthne ein Streifen Wirklichkeit durch jenen Spalt, durch den du hingingst: Grtln wirklicher Grlne, wirklicher Sonnenschein, wirklicher Wald. Wir spielen weiter. Bang und schwer Erlerntes hersagend und Gebarden dann und wann aufhebend; aber dein von uns entferntes, aus unserm StOck entrUcktes Dasein kann uns manchmal oberkommen, wie ein Wissen von jener Wirklichkeit sich niedersenkend, so da8 wir eine Weile hingerissen das Leben spielen, nicht an Beifall denkend. It might seem that "Todes-Erfahrung" is a most improbable choice among Rilke-poems to illustrate any kind of mutuality between self and world. It is a nervous, insecure text in which the early death of a friend forces the poet to put everything he has achieved into question; we are far indeed from the magisterial progressions of "die schone Buche." And yet it is precisely under pressure like this that the intensity of Rilke's determination to make a world out of human time becomes most apparent. For despite his esoteric language, Rilke's aesthetic goals are</page><page sequence="7">Time Structures in Poems 409 fairly steadily in focus and, as Jacob Steiner has argued in the context of language,8 do not change that much throughout his career: the things that are invisible, emotions and ideas, are to be made visible and the things that are visible, from statues to flowers, are to be drawn into the invisible permanence of language. The problem with the schema, of course, is the unpredictability of the self, its tendency to break out of the craftsman's role; and Rilke came increasingly to see time, the dis- cordant and destructive common element of self, world and language, as both the necessary ground on which a poetic structure must be erected and the fluid continuum into which it must project itself. Rilke's lan- guage is quite explicit on the need to release the inherent temporality within "die Dinge" in the course of their poetic or sculptural realiza- tion: "Es gab kein ZurlAcktreten bei Rodin, sondern ein immerwthrendes Nahesein und Gebeugtsein Oiber das Werdende. Und heute ist diese Eigen- art in ihm so stark geworden, daB man fast sagen kOnnte, das Aussehen seiner Dinge sei ihm gleichgtfltig; so sehr erlebt er ihr Sein, ihre Wirklich- keit, ihre allseitige Loslosung vom Ungewissen . . . sie stehen nicht auf der Erde, sie kreisen um sie."' As Rilke fuses the idea of perfect closure with the mutual absorption of self and world into a single creative process, the analogy with MOrike's enterprise becomes clear: at the very heart of apparently static perfection there is constant motion, and only the human experience of time and death can recognize and respond to the challenge of that ceaseless movement. To evade the challenge is to risk an extinction which in Rilke's work is almost the opposite of death. For Rilke, as for Morike, Heine's mirror-expeiience, the horror of time suspended, is ever-present. Rilke articulated that experience through the figure of the doll, in his 1914 essay entitled "Puppen:" "Ihr gegentiber, da sie uns anstarrte, erfuhren wir zuerst (oder irr ich mich?) jenes Hohle im Geftihl, jene Herzpause, in der einer verginge, wenn ihn dann nicht die ganze, sanft weitergehende Natur, wie ein Lebloses, Oiber Ab- grtinde hintiberhotbe."'0 Am I saying then that we are witnessing an endless replay of the same modern artistic imperatives? This is a difficulty with any concept of tradition, one that especially afflicts the theory of modernism: after Mallarm6, the theory implies, there is little new to add, as poets are said to craft their verbal toys from word-plays and clever inversions of tradi- tional motifs, seasoned with a dash of hallucinatory hysteria. I have long found this image of poetry unconvincing, a product of the recent tyranny of France over modern German poetics." And indeed I propose to re- claim Gottfried Benn, an ambivalent denizen of the modernist camp, for my version of a modern tradition. A poetry that recognizes that the modern self has no alternative but to reinvent, rediscover or reaffirm the world may develop certain structural patterns but is otherwise un- likely to repeat itself. As the repetitions of history and nature accumulate and the possibility of transcendence continues to recede, the elements of self and world, while they cannot disappear altogether, can express them- selves on a scale ranging from almost total dominance to almost total disintegration. Interestingly, in the texts under discussion, it is Rilke</page><page sequence="8">410 JAMES ROLLESTON rather than Benn whose "self" comes closer to the pole of disintegration. If one applies to Rilke's text the structural model of the self's trans- formations derived from Morike, it does in a sense "work." A low- keyed opening leads to an anguished sense of exile from a self-contained sanctum, here the mystery of death; from stanza 3 onwards there is a gradual and painful reconstitution of the self through contact with the mystery, culminating in an illumination. But this sequence is basically scaffolding for a series of transformations, all of them partial and un- satisfying. A remarkable feature of this probing, intimate poem is that the word "ich" nowhere occurs in it. The self is implied by the first- person plural and the second-person singular, as if it is taking literally the word "Maskenmund" in line 4. Of death one can only speak through masks; but the very universality of death offers a complex opportunity to take its frightening intimacy into an experience of community. Ini- tially the reverse happens: all masks slip. The moment of death under- mines all the linguistic gestures through which living beings conven- tionally express themselves. The impersonal philosophical self of the opening is succeeded by the self as actor in a futile morality play. Ironi- cally the self can now claim a community between its own time-dimen- sion and that of other people: for death makes a mockery of all human temporal patterning. And yet, very much as Morike was able to rebuild his experience of time from the grove that had denied it, so it is a particu- lar death that begins the restoration of some life to the human puppets on their stage. There is no comfort in this new life: Rilke's language in stanza 3 enlarges the already vast distances between the living and the dead with its reiterations of "gingst" and "wirklicher." The glimpsed "reality" is by definition remote, at one with the ever-receding death realm. And yet this stanza does effect a transformation in the poem's texture, all the more striking because there is no compromising of death's negations. The first three words of the poem, "Wir wissen nichts," are now modified: we do know something, we know that death has to do with the intensification of our own world, pure negation is in some sense identical with pure affirmation. And Rilke is speaking not of para- dise but of a temporal zone: "Grtine," "Sonnenschein," "Wald," all of the named entities must be conceived as involved with process and change. In short, even as death mocks and negates human time, it opens onto the fullness of the world's time, although only for a momen- tary glimpse and only at an immense distance. Immense but not infinite; the power of Rilke's poem owes much to the reversion in stanza 4 to the puppet stage: death cannot teach us to live. And yet the texture has changed again. The characters on stage are uncertain and ignorant, but they are no longer false: the roles they play do indeed come from outside, but they are struggling honestly to fill them, to relate their "gestures" to some kind of orderly time-scale, "dann und wann." This means that the gulf between the inadequacy of human time and the fullness of death's "Wirklichkeit" is not after all absolute. The words "bang und schwer" imply that the actors are per- forming, however feebly, with some knowledge of death's presence;</page><page sequence="9">Time Structures in Poems 411 conversely the dead woman's existence is "entriickt" but not completely other. The distance between death and life has generated a time scale of its own, a zone of revelation in which man can after all touch the knowledge of his destiny. This time is given emblematic reality by the enjambement between the final, stanzas, and the exposed position of the word "Wissen" offers a last tentative response to the poem's opening line. There is no denying the awkward language of the final stanza: "sich niedersenkend" seems unfocused, "hingerissen" banal and "denkend" a clumsy note to end on. Yet it is possible without sophistry to justify this awkwardness in terms of the poem's central images of acting, learn- ing and knowing. The open ending, the vision with its temporal limits, enables the text's speaker, still in the plural voice, to face outwards towards the world, without the confidence but with some of the existen- tial achievement of MOrike's persona at his tree. The mirror of life no longer reflects back merely the annihilating image of empty human time. Looking at the text in the light of the formal categories derived from MOrike's poem, one finds patterns similar yet less seamlessly organized. Thus the relationship of glimpse and recurrence is virtually thematic in its importance. The first stanza, with its multiple negatives, is pre- cisely a denial of the glimpse: the distance, the journey of death is invoked, but it generates no time-dimension, hence no valid emotion; as the indifferent abstractions pile up, the language becomes lifeless and, in a careful symmetry with the enjambement linking the last two stanzas, the movement of the verse is just sufficient for'it to tumble over into the second stanza. Here is the recurrent world, the world without distance; the closure is not rhythmic but claustrophobic, the death-experience that could not be legitimately glimpsed is now omnipresent. At the same time the poem is struggling to impose a timetable, a limit on the emptiness of human action: "Noch ist die Welt voll Rollen . . . solang wir sor- gen. . . ." The central stanza offers the decisive glimpse, recovered as it were from a past which the poem seeks to translate into meaning. The parallel with Morike's shift to the past tense is suggestive: the mysteries both poets are confronting cannot be penetrated as enigmatic present states; human time must be deployed, the world from which man is exiled may be reentered only if it is reimagined as the final chapter of his story. With stanza four the circular world returns, and indeed the play of life, so close to lifelessness, is reenacted yet again in the last stanza, this time of course in harmony with the glimpse, now become potent memory. It is important to note that nothing new, no super- natural vision occurs in the poem: Rilke has taken hold of the one trace that death has left in the world, a moment of "Wirklichkeit" that existed only in time, and surrounded it with the repetition of ordinary time in a manner so intense, so uncompromising, that a blending of time-scales is finally "geleistet," in Rilkean language. The transformation can only be momentary, but it is now "manchmal," the hopelessness of recur- rence is breached. The word "spielen" occurs three times: initially it is strictly theatrical, the playing of roles, then it is used without a qualifier,</page><page sequence="10">412 JAMES ROLLESTON probingly. Finally life itself is "played," as a child plays with it. Child- hood for Rilke is the source of death as terror, as absence of life; but childhood regained through a confrontation with death's reality is perhaps the most precise Rilkean image for living in time. Certainly the moralistic elements in the poem, the awkward phrases about seeking applause, suggest a prescriptive intent, analogous perhaps to the weight of meaning placed by Morike on the word "Einsamkeit." Precisely because these poems reach their own goals through the articulation of a time-dimension for which they must struggle, there is a powerful impetus within their language to project this achieved time into the world beyond the poem. Eingeengt (1953) Gottfried Benn Eingeengt in Ftlhlen und Gedanken deiner Stunde, der du anbestimmt, wo so viele Gllicke Trauer tranken, einer Stunde, welche Abschied nimmt, Trauer nur-die Sturm- und Siegeswogen, Niederlagen, Graber, KuB und Kranz, Trauer nur-die Heere abgezogen, sammeln sie sich wo-wer weil es ganz? Denke dann der Herzen wechselnd Traumen, andere Gotter, anderes Bemlihn, denk der Reiche, die Pagoden saumen, wo die feuerroten Segel bllhn, denke andres: wie vom Himmel erben Nord und Slid durch Funken und durch Flut, denke an das grosse Mammutsterben in den Tundren zwischen Eis und Glut, eingeengt von Ftlhlen und Gedanken bleibt in dich ein groBer Strom gelegt, seine Melodie ist ohne Schranken, trauerlos und leicht und selbstbewegt. It is perhaps becoming clear what links these three disparate poems: it is the attempt to confront ultimate mysteries without flinching and to imagine the level of human time on which they can be approached. For MOrike the mystery is self-contained nature, for Rilke the blankness of death, for Benn the enigma of history. We have seen how Rilke and MOrike deal with the terror of the mirror-experience by reclaiming the possibility of human identity from the temporal void: for them the re- constitution of a supportive mutuality vis-a-vis the world is coterminous with the rebuilding of the "Ich," the restatement of a viable individual time-scale. But Benn's mirror-experience is different. What confronts him is not the isolation of self but the horror at the other extreme, name- ly an excess of connections, biological, social and intellectual, to other human beings. The concept of uniqueness has lost its meaning, although everyone continues to behave as if it were still in force. The result is a</page><page sequence="11">Time Structures in Poems 413 chaos of human activity without identity. The only context in which Benn feels the word "Ich" can still be pronounced is that of the self- contained poem, and his powerful yearning for the immutable "order" of the poetic self led him to the endorsement of formalist modernism in "Probleme der Lyrik." However, although this may be considered a low blow, one should not forget that this very same yearning for order within the human confusion led him 20 years earlier, with equal elo- quence, to an endorsement of racial collectivism. The actual evidence of Benn's poetry suggests a more consistent and continuous fascination with history, with a kind of evolutionary change far below the surface of human events. Poems open up rifts in the earth of dailiness, linking surface phenomena to the movement in the depths of history. Marion Adams has illuminated the productive tension between the virtual de- terminism of Benn's biological pronouncements, reducing human beings to a genetic dictatorship of irresistible and conflicting urges, and his exemption of aesthetic form from all such determinism, indeed from any criteria whatever, that might be derived from the contemporary world. She notes: "His primitivism is consistent with his discontinuous metaphysics, since the past surges up only for brief moments."12 One is reminded of the momentary glimpses of the death-realm which, for Rilke, suffice to maintain at least the viable illusion of a human identity. But for Benn there can be no such identity, because the only valid human time-scale is totally inaccessible to the empty rhythms of daily life. As Adams says: "The only social role that Benn would ever admit for the artist was special concentration on the memories of the race."'" Does it make any sense, then, to speak of a mutuality of self and world in relation to Benn? The answer is yes, provided that both sides of the equation are completely rethought. Benn would like to broaden the significance of poetic creation and communication, to establish an en- tirely new time-scale, vertical instead of horizontal. On the surface of the earth of human affairs there is the human consciousness with its yearning to become self; and in the depths of history there is the only knowable truth, a truth that has by definition some connection with the surface world because it exists through human affairs, as an enigmatic concentration of them. There are no other substances, no transcen- dentals. Rilke feels much the same way about the death-realm: it simply has to be possible to reclaim it for life because it grows within life and consists of nothing but life. But for Benn the time-scale, wherein the lucid compressions of history could generate a new continuity of con- sciousness, has to be recognized as not yet in existence. For both Morike and Rilke the creative process is one of recovery, for Benn it must be one of invention; the invocations of a fulfilled past in his poems are self- consciously close to cliche, building-blocks from the historical repertoire to be reused in the imagining of a future. But the way forward is not one of irrationalism, rather it involves a tight interweaving of surface and depth, as they are presently understood. Thus the human self can perhaps be reinvented, but only if its collectivity, its historicity, its pro- visional evolutionary status are fully acknowledged: "Der Mensch ist</page><page sequence="12">414 JAMES ROLLESTON nicht ein Ende, nicht die Krone der SchOpfung, sondern ein Beginn ... das Tierreich ist iiberschritten, hinter sich gelassen, die Emanzipation des Geistigen tastet sich in einen neu sich eroffnenden Raum."14 In this passage the dry historical language shifts towards the spatial, as Benn strives to imagine the emancipation from the aimless treadmill of linear time. But the movement is not a mystical one, not an escape from time: the process invoked in the phrase "neu sich eroffnenden Raum" ex- presses the necessary synthesis of dimensions in a verbal gesture not so remote, after all, from Morike's entry into the tree-circle. Conversely, when Benn endeavors to articulate the way in which the buried truth of history responds to poetic language, firmly spatial images gradually be- come temporal. In the following remarkable "Marginalie" we may inter- pret "geschichtliche Welt" as the movement in the depths of time, "nihi- listische Welt" as the frenzied activity of the surface and "Ausdrucks- welt" as the world of the poet's language, destined to become the "expression" of the newly imagined time-dimension: "Die Ausdrucks- welt steht zwischen der geschichtlichen und der nihilistischen als eine gegen beide geistig erkampfte menschliche Oberwelt, ist also eine Art Niemandsland, zuruckgelassenes Handeln und herausgelostes Gesicht. An Realitat ist sie das Konkreteste ... in der Dichtung, z.B., muf3 man allein sein, in die Weite sehen, womoglich Ober Wasser, und Worte heranziehen, Worte, dicht von Sachverhalten, geschichtlich beschwerte, tragische Worte, real wie Lebewesen."15 These lines enact the drama of human possibility: the singularity of humanness gradually becomes imaginable, carved out of time's geological layers by language, by words which no weight of experience can crush into final inertia. As in the time-structures of MOrike and Rilke, Benn is impelled to posit the self-expansion of poetic language beyond its own limits. Such language enters the human wasteland, "geschichtlich beschwert," and makes it possible to imagine a reinvention of the concept of identity within the framework of the new, historically discontinuous time-scale. The phrase "herausgelostes Gesicht," is revealing here; the word "Ge- sicht" is almost a topos in later Benn, a play on the double meaning of face and vision suggesting that the ultimate product of the compression of human time in the depths is a "Gesicht," a new and strange single- ness of being. The poem "Eingeengt" transfers this paradox to the immediacy of consciousness. Precisely because the human being is con- stricted, compressed within the limited possibilities of a given historical moment, the potential for forging a unique identity, a "Gesicht," exists. The title recalls the atmosphere of Benn's Expressionist youth, for ex- ample Stadler's well-known "Form ist Wollust:" Form will mich verschniiren und verengen, Doch ich will mein Sein in alle Weiten drangen. But release is just what Benn does not prescribe. Instead the compres- sion intensifies through the imperative, didactic, rigidly shaped stanzas, drawing more and more imagined experience into the fixity of a histori- cal existence; until finally the experience of history as such can be af- firmed and the stream of time into the depths of the human past opens</page><page sequence="13">Time Structures in Poems 415 up beneath the consciousness. One cannot talk here of an initial loss of self, because the very possibility of a self is at issue in the poem. But structural similarities with the other two poems discussed are readily discerned. In the first two stanzas, the stripping down of the speaker's world to a zero point is accomplished, precisely not through a process of exclusion but through its antithesis, a remorseless inclusion in the vacuum of history understood superficially. We cannot escape the "events" of the modern world, yet almost immediately the armies that seemed so permanent vanish from consciousness, seemingly without trace. The remainder of the poem struggles upwards from this abyss, but not through the imposition of epic continuity, as in Morike, or theatrical recurrence, as in Rilke. Instead, Benn imposes the paradox of radical discontinuity: only through the shedding of all illusions of selfhood can a genuine self be imagined. Renate von Heydebrand's phrase applies to all three of these poems: "Distanz ist das Gesetz dieser Darstellung;" but whereas both Morike and Rilke insist on distance in order to recap- ture, at the limits of the imagination, a residual connectedness, Benn negates all connections except "das Geistige." One could say that he radicalizes Rilke's usage of "das Wissen:" just because our only link to these remote epochs and geographies of the past is through knowledge, they can become the basis of the experiment that is the reinvention of the modern self. Man has lost his center irrevocably, but he still has his peripheries-and the mystery of language, its traditions and collective memories. It is possible to discern a structure of recurrence and glimpse in this poem, but again the priorities are inverted. Instead of Morike's seamless web or Rilke's alternation there is rigid repetition. For in Benn's world there is only recurrence, yet recurrence itself can become the source of a saving glimpse, provided it is insisted on without sentimental loosening. Thus the first stanza, very close to daily life, is without hint of any di- mension but loss; the second stanza, held within the flickering immedi- acy of newsreel, also turns in on itself, but ends in a question. The third stanza is exotic, effortful, "die feuerroten Segel" are still close to schoolroom encyclopedias. But the imagination is freed, and the fourth stanza roams to the limiting conundrums of planetary history. The shape of history is unchanged, as is the shape of Benn's stanzas, the world is nothing but recurrence and death. But through the magic of a liberated language recurrence can and has become glimpse. In the last stanza the infinite weight of the past has become infinitely light: the long-estab- lished analogy of poetry and music, the arts that exist only in time, is deployed to suggest that what has hitherto been limited to the category of dry knowledge can become the fluid substance of a new mode of being. The concluding image of the "Strom" is of course a topos, a meta- phor for life that almost every poet has elaborated. Here is Rilke's ver- sion, in a letter to Lou Salome of 8 August 1903: "Ich teile mich immer wieder und flief3e auseinander,-und mA chte doch so gern in einem Bette gehen und grol3 werden... wir sollen wie ein Strom sein und nicht in Kanale treten und Wasser zu den Weiden f0ihren ... wir sollen uns</page><page sequence="14">416 JAMES ROLLESTON zusammenhalten und rauschen."" Like Benn, Rilke insists that the poet's way into the world can only be through insistence on his auton- omy, through the compression of inherited language, its release and renewal. But unlike Benn, Rilke wants to reclaim all elements of the image for the concept of identity. The self is the river, the world is its banks. The boundaries are fluid, the temporality of the river of central importance: but the landscape is the same as in the older centuries of the Western tradition. For Benn, the chaos of the modern has devastated the landscape, the banks between self and world are hopelessly breached. But there is hope in the fact that the river has flooded the landscape: it can obliterate wounds and, moreover, it is still a river. There is still direc- tion and current. The human consciousness can never again claim it as an image for individual identity, but what is now possible is to tame its shapelessness through an openness to its totality, to the depth and multi- plicity of the human past. Then it can be "in dich gelegt." Indeed it is always present, the verb is "bleibt." But the time-scale generated by the rigor of the "Ausdruckswelt" gives access to the river's current, as Morike's narrative of discovery opens the charmed circle of the tree. Time is no longer a given, a passive background: it has become both man's proper element and his essential tool in the struggle against the disintegration of experience. For, when time's perennial masks of his- tory and language are seized and displaced by poetic speaking, it yields the only possibility imaginable of reconstituting the supportive mutuality of self and world.

The Heidelberg Festival, comprising a series of orchestral and operatic performances in the castle, has invited the Eastman Philharmonia and its conductor David Effron to be its resident orchestra. The Eastman Philharmonia is the senior orchestra of the Eastman School of Music of the University of Rochester. The performances to take place between July 26 and August 31, 1981, are part of the second annual Heidelberg Castle Festival. Oskar Kokoschka, the great Austrian painter, graphic artist, scenic designer, and author of pioneering dramatic works, who acquired worldwide renown as one of the "monoliths" of classical modern art, died in his house in Villeneuve on the shore of Lake Geneva (Switzerland) on February 22, 1980, at the age of 93. Professor Gerhard Croll, the head of the Institute of Musicology at the University of Salzburg, has recently discovered a previously unknown part of the score to "The Abduc- tion from the Seraglio" by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. The composition, the existence of which was suspected on the basis of some con- temporary sources, consists of 28 bars and Croll calls it "March of the Janizaries During the Entry of Selim Bassa." It is set in c-major for nine brass and woodwinds and two drums (one German, one Turkish). The march, if put in the designated sequence, closes a gap which, from the point of dramaturgical development, has been inexplicable. The composition will be published by Baerenreiter-Verlag during 1980. It has been agreed upon that the music will receive its official premiere during the opening ceremony of the 1980 Salzburg Festival.</page></plain_text>
