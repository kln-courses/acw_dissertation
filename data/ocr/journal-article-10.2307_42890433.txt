<plain_text><page sequence="1">PHILOSOPHICAL VALUE JUDGMENTS AND LEGAL EDUCATION.. Abraham Glasser* I The Issue: Affirmation or Skepticism THEORY nizes a differentiation in the field of between education, goals like and theory methods. in other The fields, educator recog- nizes a differentiation between goals and methods. The educator asks: (1) What do I want my students to become? (2) How shall I accomplish this goal, what material should I teach, by what teaching methods ? The educational-goals question can become embarrassing, because it quickly leads to social controversiality. To be sure, this can be avoided by playing down the goals question to innocuous dimensions and con- centrating on the methods question, or by formulating the goals question in the way that law teachers (in particular) usually do - namely, by limiting ourselves to asking what we want our students to become in point of skill, craft, technical capacity. But I submit that the goals question demands to be formulated also in the broader and more embarrassing way - namely, what do we want our students to become in point of social responsibility and ethical func- tioning, what kind of human end product do we want them to become, what social and philosophical values do we want them to affirm ? There are at least two avenues of argument in favor of our putting the goals question in this broader way. In the first place, we do not have even a partially sound basis for rigid- ly making the narrower choice of goals. We are mistaken if we think that the teaching of crafts or skills offers an autonomous area where the embarrassments of the larger values question can be avoided. True, it is said that in dealing with crafts or skills we stick to the factual and the analytical, we hope to have an effect on the student's "rational dis- ciplines" or on his "mind" ; whereas if we dealt with social or ethical value judgments, it would be the student's "opinions" or his "spirit" we should be presuming to influence. But it is unrealistic to speak exclu- sively of such a differentiation between "mind" and "spirit" or between "facts" and "opinion" while ignoring the axis of interpénétration which joins these supposedly polarized areas. Whether one emphasizes such a * A.B. 1933, Rutgers University, M.A.1935, Princeton University. Associate Profes- sor of Law, Rutgers University.

Every good teacher recognizes the analogous problems faced in the handling of specific subject matters. He knows that in attempting compartmentali- zation or classification of data he must resist the tendency to regard his own or the other fellow's specialty as having autonomous roots, lest he accomplish nothing but his own (and his students') uprooting; it is well for the "detached" scholar to remember the primary separatist meaning* of the word "detachment." Likewise, any attempt by educators to ap- proach with unrelieved distinctness the craft objectives and the larger value goals leads to cultural separatism. And special bane plagues the attempt in the field of legal education, whose materials comprise a wider range of active, urgent human interpénétrations than those of any other profession. Not only is a cultural separatist thus a poor educator (especially for the professions) in the sense of simply failing to impart to the student the integrated body of knowledge he ought to have, but, in the second place, and far more serious, this kind of separatist educator robs hu- manity of pro tanto portions of its richest resource, the development-ful- fillment potential of each human individual. Our individualist culture tends to blind us to what an individual really is. In the name of indi- vidualism we doom our individuals to that incomplete individuality which results from obliging the part to exist only as a partedness instead of as a part-of-the-whole. "Microcosm" carries far richer meaning than "atom." The interpenetrative education process I have spoken of ex- presses, for human individual functioning, the infinite relatedness of each human individual to all of humanity, and, beyond this, the infinitely in- terpenetrative relatedness of each human microcosm to whatever mac- rocosm faith may posit or knowledge may seek. How well are these interpénétrations appreciated by legal educators? Are educational goals discerned that undertake to give the law student something beyond technical professional competence? Where such larger goals are discerned, are they clearly and boldly formulated ? Is there recognition that the goals a man discerns are larger in proportion as his capacities for relatedness and for philosophical affirmation increase ? I am not sounding a trumpet for ethical dogma in the law schools, al- though I shall be needing all these next pages, I know, to convince many good readers that they are not being urged to become dogmatists. What</page><page sequence="3">62 Journal of Legal Education [Vol. 3 I am sounding is a plea for more teaching about the question of legal value judgments, and that is what this paper is about. More specifically, my purpose in this paper is to explore (sympatheti- cally) the possibility that the social objectives of our traditional human- istic moral faith - our democratic, non-exploitational objectives - derive from sound scientific and philosophical indicia, and hence must be ac- cepted as compelling guides in the shaping of social organization gener- ally and of law. This paper is a search for ways of founding ethical legal values on scientific-materialist data. My attempt to do these things, however, will not proceed along merely relativist lines ; I am seeking to come as close as possible to an absolute integration of these human values with physical nature- e., I am hypothesizing that the material world at least justifies, and perhaps determines, an ethical-democratic role for man. Further, in as much as a paper having affirmational purposes such as these is obliged to swim against the powerful current of the negation- al, skeptical or agnostic attitudes fostered by contemporary science to- ward value absolutes, it will be pertinent to have a historical analysis of ethical skepticism. The analysis of ethical skepticism will in fact take up most of the paper, for it is my thesis that when we understand the social drives and the philosophical and scientific arguments of the skeptical doctrine, we shall understand not only the falseness of ethical skepticism but much also about the arguments in favor of ethical affirmation. The foregoing somewhat abstruse statement of the purposes of this paper can be more concretely recast, and the pertinence of the subject for lawyers and legal educators can be better indicated, after some fur- ther preliminaries, which take up the next few pages. * * * Lawyers have long and prominently participated in the age-old phil- osophical quest for "truths" that might reveal in some auspicious light the purposes of man's life and the goals of human society. To this day, when a lawyer-turned-legal-philosopher pursues this affirmational quest he is likely to bestow upon the object of his search - if he does not, his critics are likely to - the multi-meaning and sect-ridden title of natural law. Being myself a legal-value-affirmation quester, and feeling the need for a short name to describe the affirmational legal values that I want to believe in, I am content to use this good old name, natural law. Of course, I shall want to have it believed that my skirts are held as cleanly as possible away from the muddinesses stirred up in the once fresh natural law waters by the numerous breeds of highly vocal dog- matists who have long sought intellectual dominion there and social do- minion thence. This defensive attitude I display about my embrace of natural law, however, is not owing merely to a wish to be dissociated</page><page sequence="4">1950] Philosophical Values and Legal Education 63 from the natural law dogmatists and from the deserved disrepute in which they are held. My attitude takes this defensive color also from the fact already mentioned that nowadays any affirmational thinking about ultimate human values is liable to incur the scorn of the rationalist skeptics who claim to represent intellectual "soundness" in the science and the philosophy of contemporary western culture. Under the in- fluence of modern theories of empirical cognition and materialist rela- tivism, even what is scientifically and culturally most contributive in the great quest for human-value affirmations - including non-dogmatic natu- ral law - tends to get branded as illusory and therefore is forced into a defensive scientific and cultural position. In the law, this general cul- tural phenomenon of our time is exemplified in the continuing ascendancy of the Holmesian existentialist 1 positivism, which impassively observes the historical struggle between conscience and cannibalism, and ridicules the lawyer who falls into the "metaphysical" illusion of believing in something beyond the manifest energies of his own metabolism, the technical efficacies of his craft, and the umpiring of the positivist game. Later I shall, of course, deal more fully with the ethical agnosticism of the Holmesian positivists and with the meaning of their seeming cultural austerities, their "tough-minded" scorn for humanistic affirmations. Despite the agnostic adversities of the time, the kind of affirmational thinking I am speaking of is today displaying signs of a significant re- vival among scientific scholars in law and other fields 2 - that is, not merely among the faith-oriented thinkers, theological and otherwise, who of course have never abandoned the quest anyhow. Recent discussions among legal educators have freshened the quest for basic affirmations or objective humanistic values in the law. At a notable conference in 1948 of divinity, law, medical, engineering and business school teachers the question discussed with greatest animation was whether present-day pro- fessional education ought to search for ethical or social values at levels of scientific provability. (Farther on I shall have considerably more to say of this conference, which was held at Buck Hill Falls, and takes its name from that place).3 At the 1948 convention of the Association of American Law Schools, and again at the 1949 convention, the deep in- 11 am here borrowing the happily chosen epithet applied to Justice Holmes by Harold R. McKinnon in The Secret of Mr. Justice Holmes , 36 A.B.A.J. 261 (1950). 2 Mention may be made at this point of Jerome Hall's recent Living Law of Democratic Society (1949) ; and of the work of F.S.C. Northrop, e. g., his Under- bill Moore's Legal Science, 59 Yale L.J. 196 (1950). See also note 15, infra. As to non-legal scholarship developments, see the forthcoming concluding installment of this article. 3 The conference proceedings are published under the title Education fob Pro- fessional Responsibility (Pittsburgh, Carnegie Press, 1948), hereinafter referred to as Buck Hill Falls Report. The papers on legal education were published also in the Winter, 1948 issue of the Journal of Legal Education (Vol. 1, No. 2).</page><page sequence="5">64 Journal of Legal Education [Vol. 3 terest evoked by similar questions during the round-tables on legal philo- sophy was a matter of general remark (and surprise). Positivist cynics will not find anything striking in this revivalist trend among the professors. But an a priori hope is at least as good as an a priori sneer, and the very pervasiveness of this new affirmational think- ing among law teachers has arguable significance. In Man The Reformer Emerson said:4 The demon of reform has a secret door into the heart of every lawmaker, of every inhabitant of every city. The fact that a new thought and hope have dawned in your breast, should apprise you that in the same hour a new light broke in upon a thousand private hearts. That secret which you would fain keep - as soon as you go abroad, lo ! there is one standing on the doorstep to tell you the same. Men cannot be blamed for reposing confidence in the common air and the common freshnesses it brings.5 I speak of freshness in this latest natural law scene. The freshness is not so much, as yet, in the substance of what is being said, as in the fact that it is being said at this particular stage of man's cultural evolu- tion. And the substance itself, of what is lately being said about natural law, will yet exhibit freshness too, although this is not so manifest as it will become perhaps in the next few years. But I here anticipate not only future cultural developments but also the development of my own argument in this paper. The immense accumulated literature of the historic natural law in- quiry, the range and variety of the ideas generated by the quest for af- firmative values in the field of law 6, compel each writer who comes to the subject anew to be as exact as possible in fixing his particular focus. My focus has been partly suggested in what has gone before. Somewhat 4 1 The Prose Works of Ralph Waldo Emerson 126 (1879). 5 This is a good place for me to mention that while I do not presume to stake out any definitely demarcated claims of originality (in the sense of first discovery) in this paper, I do aver that everything here that is interpretative, critical, or hypothetical is the result of my own independent thinking ; likewise, of course, the over-all theme or thesis of the paper. I make this statement for two reasons, neither of which has anything to do with my wanting "credit." Those reasons are: (1) If I, as one student of legal philosophy, thinking independently, have come to unorthodox af- firmational attitudes in the field contemporaneously with other independent thinkers, that fact is objectively significant, and I want to record it even at the risk of being considered an unattractively self-centered fellow. (2) This paper is pretty sparse in annotations, and my readers are entitled to know that where I make so many un- annotated statements I am asking them to listen to me, not depriving them of re- search leads to other authors. «For a convenient bibliographical start, see the annotations in Professor Julius F. Stone's The Province and Function of Law, Pt. II, especially c. VIII (1946).

My interest in finding affirmational human values in gen- eral, and affirmational legal value objectives in particular, places me in the natural law camp. Second , as also previously mentioned, natural law has meant and means to other writers many things which I disavow and which will therefore have no place in the argument of this paper. I disavow any allegiance to the varied pretensions of natural law to be recognized as some sort of actual juridical repository of more or less specific "higher law" rules. These pretensions have always been fictional, and in the clumsy hands of special pleaders for various humane as well as inhumane causes - the dogmatists of whom I spoke - have done much to discredit natural law thinking. Third, my own attitudes about legal values are linked to natural law ideas and will be developed in this paper in the following ways : I hold absolute affirmational beliefs about certain broad human goals and the necessity of shaping law accordingly. I posit that there are truths rooted in material nature which are pertinent to certain primary human value alternatives, such as democracy versus eliteism, co-operation versus com- petition, fellowship versus exploitation, relatedness versus hostility. I do not claim to know definitively , of course, just which facts of material nature support such truths, nor just how these truths shall be formulated. But for reasons to be presented in the course of this paper I consider my belief in the existence of these truths to be an informed belief, of the sort which is scientifically cognizable, entitled to critical scientific con- sideration. I shall attack the unnecessarily limited attitude of conven- tional modern science which at the present time allows no such considera- tion, and sees no possibility of scientifically relating human-value striv- ings to material nature in any ultimate way. Fourth, I hope that these attitudes of mine are "in the air," so to say. I hope they spring from the same common air that has recently freshened interest among law teachers and writers in a more absolute scientific and philosophical approach to the question of legal value judgments. Some further words of orientation: In noting the disfavor in which affirmational legal value thinking has languished during the present era of science and rationalism, I do not, of course, mean to suggest that, prior to the latest surge among law teachers, the contemporary fields of legal study and teaching conventionally embraced within the headings "jurisprudence" and "legal philosophy" had been ignoring altogether, or even minimizing, questions of legal value objectives. Many of the schol- 3 Journal of Legal Ed.No.l - 6</page><page sequence="7">66 Journal of Legal Education [Vol. 3 ars working in these fields have indeed been very interested all along in legal value emphases and not merely in the "rules" emphases of the older Austinian jurisprudence 7. The nineteenth century Austinian analytical jurisprudence, which scorned legal value inquiries while attaching ex- clusive value to inquiries by way of description and analysis of the juri- dical structures and mechanisms of positive law-making, has long been losing emphasis in these fields of study. The familiar disjunction fea- tured by writers like Professor Fuller well indicates the enlarged (or, rather, the re-enlarged) province of twentieth century legal philosophy - it has been concerned not only with "the law that is" but also, as in pre- Austinian times, with "the law that ought to be." 8 Similarly Dean Pound has summed up the twentieth century enlargement as one which has spoken no longer only of "theory of law," but also of "theory of making law."9 Professor Stone is one of those who use the term "theory of justice" to denote what was added in our time to the old Austinian analytical jurisprudence 10. For myself, I find it convenient to use the above suggested disjunction of "rules" versus "values." 11 Contemporary writers and teachers in the jurisprudence field, then, have by no means been uninterested in legal value judgments. In the new surge of the last couple of years, however, we have had what to me seems a significant change. Until quite recently, with rare exception 12, the thinking of non-theological contemporary legal philosophers about value choices has pretty generally displayed three characteristics : ( 1 ) It has been socially utilitarian - i. e., in one way or another it has asserted that law should serve men's social needs.13 (2) It has been ethically arbitrary - i. e., its concepts of social need have been chosen , arbitrarily chosen , without pretension of undertaking to prove the philosophical va- lidity of the particular value choices or the invalidity of their opposites. (3) It has necessarily therefore been, in philosophical terms, skeptical or at best relativist or reservational about its own value choices. Like sec- 7 Throughout this paper I counterpoise the terms "rules" and "values" as denoting, respectively, (1) the subject matter of positivist, descriptive, analytical jurisprudence and (2) the subject matter of a philosophical jurisprudence concerned with value af- firmations. 8 Lo n L. Fuller, The Law in Quest of Itself (1940). The familiar "is-ought" terminology was not originated by Professor Fuller, of course, but he has written about it so well that I cite him as its exemplar. 9 Roscoe Pound, Interpretations of Legal History (1923). io Julius Stone, The Province and Function of Law (1946). ii See note 7, supra. 12 See note 15, infra. 13 This is the essence of the modern "sociological jurisprudence" whose searching for the social references and incidences of law is premised, naturally, on such a utilitarian attitude. But is this attitude itself backed by any theory? Incidentally, the phrasing in the text above is not intended to suggest, of course, that the theolog- ical legal philosophers are generally anti-utilitarian. 3 Journal of Legal Ed.No.l</page><page sequence="8">1950] Philosophical Values and Legal Education 67 ular Existentialism 14 and the whole contemporary rationalist-materialist science which generates these philosophies of fundamental evasion in matters of value judgment, contemporary legal philosophy has arbitrarily been counselling affirmational social action while evading or even denying the possibility of integrating these counsels in an affirmational, scientifi- cally founded philosophy of values.15 It is a thesis of this paper that without such an affirmational philoso- phy to energize it, no program of affirmational social action in the law or elsewhere can escape eventual disintegration. This is why I consider so significant the recent indications of a broadening of value attitudes 14 Sartre's summary in his little book, Existentialism, is quite transparent in this regard. He says we should not be discouraged merely because ethical absolutes cannot be affirmed; this very circumstance, he says, means that man is "free" to choose his values, which means that man therefore has "responsibility." Well, Hitler was "free" too, and I venture to believe that the stalwart anti-fascists of all countries whose energies defied and vanquished the Axis powers were impelled by something more than displeasure over the fascists' preference in the use of their agnostically "free" "responsibility." Existentialism (which poses as a "philosophy") cannot refuse, in philosophical terms, even to a cannibalistic pathologue the right to have his value choices viewed with an open mind. It will always be a special mystery how so many notable French Catholic theoreticians could have let their belief in "free will" delude them into supposing that the fast-talking M. Sartre was offering them a congenial ideology. 15 Of the rare, philosophically affirmational exceptions among modern legal phi- losophers, the most notable was Rudolf Stammler. See e. g., his The Theory of Justice in Modern Legal Philosophy Series (1925). The compilers of the recent volume of essays in honor of Dean Pound (Interpretations of Modern Legal Philosophies (1947) ) saw fit to put C. K. Allen's essay on Stammler at the head of the volume (pp. 15-28). Yet Professor Allen found it necessary to speak diffidently of Stammler as " . . . on the whole ... a great failure among jurists. Yet he was a noble failure . . . " (p. 16). Noteworthy in the United States is the work being done at the Law School of the University of Chicago, where psy- choanalytical materials are being studied as possible indicators of value affirmation qualities intrinsic in the human psyche. The strong-questing influence of Professor Mortimer J. Adler pushes on untiringly towards these affirmations. Dean Wilber G. Katz spoke stimulatingly of these Chicago prospects at the Buck Hill Confer- ence. Buck Hill Falls Report 170-176 (1948). Dean Katz's remarks are further treated, infra. The work of F. S. C. Northrop was earlier noted in note 2, supra. A recent (seeming) adherent to legal-philosophical affirmation is Jerome Hall, in his Living Law of Democratic Society (1949). Professor Hall perceptively points out how even some of the philosophically agnostic sociological and "realist" juris- prudence writers have implicitly fallen into value affirmations. I mention this be- cause in this paper I hope to show that value affirmation is unavoidable and that self-delusive efforts to avoid such affirmation breed contradictions, disruptions, and enervations, both in the individual thinker and in the culture which he influences. As for Professor Edmond N. Cahn's recent and conspicuously successful The Sense of Injustice (1949), it is a book which bespeaks the new affirmational vitalities among legal philosophers but does not speak in really ultimate affirma- tional terms. In fact, Professor Cahn has written but the most recent (albeit per- haps the most brilliant) of the sociological-existentialist credo books. The pressures of the need to do something about ethical skepticism are manifest, however, in books like Professor Cahn's, and for this they are grandly welcome. The rarity of modern writings that quest for ethical absolutes in the law was noted by F. S. Cohen in Ethical Systems and Legal Ideals, c. I, especially p. 18 (1933). The reader will please bear in mind that I am dealing here only with secular writers, not with those having an explicitly theological orientation.</page><page sequence="9">68 Journal of Legal Education [Vol. 3 among legal philosophers. An authentically affirmational legal philoso- phy linking man as a creature of material nature with his humane value impulses, making possible for scientifically disciplined minds a serene defiance to the enervations of ethical skepticism, may at last be in its be- ginnings. I may now recast my earlier statement of purposes. The purposes of this paper are to note the factors in the evolution of western culture which have come to prevent modern science and modern legal (and gen- eral) philosophy from allowing more open-minded consideration of and teaching about absolute ethical affirmations ; to demonstrate that ethical skepticism in all forms, including its relativist variants, is historically inimical to social advance and indeed perhaps even to human biological survival; and to call attention to some new ways recently opened by scientific researches looking to the possibility of deducing absolute human value goals from material-natural data. That all this has nothing short of a mortal bearing on legal philoso- phy, on legal education, and on the whole function of the lawyer in society, needs little elaboration. It is the question of finding, consonant with material reality, the surest, the deepest laid, the most energizing, and yes, the most exaltational set of premises possible for legal think- ing and for law teaching - which is to say, it is the question of finding this kind of premises for thinking and teaching not only about what legal rules are suited to the social and individual welfare of man, but anterior- ly, it is the question of finding such premises for thinking and teaching about whether and how we are to bring ourselves to declare believing- ly that we want and are determined to work effectively for those wel- fares. Any lawyer, any man, who drifts off into a functioning not so premised takes all the risks of a ship unmoored and rudderless ; derelicts are of no use to themselves and a menace to all. In this paper I hope to give some persuasive reasons why we ought not to go on believing the faint-hearted men of science and philosophy whose teachings infer the inevitability of such a derelict process among mankind and the im- possibility of steering a long, true affirmational course. II The Paths of Skepticism Professor Homer W. Smith, a medical school teacher who spoke at the Buck Hill Falls Conference on Professional Education in 1948, 16 stated in the most straightforward terms that I have seen, the modern 16 See note 3, supra. Professor Smith's speech, "Objectives and Objectivity iq Science," was not published in this Journal , but appears in the book, Education for Professional Responsibility, at 66-76.</page><page sequence="10">1950] Philosophical Values and Legal Education 69 scientific-materialist-rationalist credo of ethical skepticism. Doubtless many scientists would dissent from much of Professor Smith's state- ment.17 But because I think he has accurately understood the full ethical implications of the contemporary scientific-materialist-rationalist world view, and because his remarks were addressed to professional-school ( teachers who were wrestling with the problem of teaching about value judgments, I am going to use Professor Smith's statement as the text for my discussion of present-day ethical skepticism. Professor Smith, in the name of science (although he disclaimed the wish to speak other than as an individual scientist), issued a decree of banishment against "Values in upper case type." He did acknowledge that "each of us is seeking to discover for himself the most satisfactory equation for living, and to aid others to this goal" ; that the professions represented at the conference "possess in common a half-formed faith that there exist certain cardinal principles that we can rely on to guide us in the complicated business of living" ; and that "this is indeed one meaning of the word profession: devotion to higher ends than merely earning a livelihood." He also apologetically observed that "the use of the term higher in this definition permits me to designate these ends as values, the only question being whether we should spell the word valué with upper or lower case type."18 It quickly became clear, however, that the only impulse of apology throbbing in Dr. Smith's credo was evoked by the dread of every philo- sophical skeptic lest he offend against his One True God, the scornful Denier who teaches that a thing ceases to exist when he turns his back upon it. Perhaps the falseness of this particular god is so hard for his devotees to detect because, if ever man's conception of divinity took inferior anthropomorphic form, it is this one: It is never easy for a man to deny his own image, but never less so than when the man and the image are imprisoned in the cultural tyranny of a narrow empiricism like that which has dominated western scientific-materialist-rationalist thought for more than a century. Empiricism, science, materialism, rationalism - why do we rob these concepts of their real splendors by suffocating their high expansive possibilities under the bleak vestments of this latter-day priesthood whose god is the denial of man? The dissenting scientists would fall into two general groupings: those who, as did Dr. Einstein in some of his earlier writings, explicitly disavow the possibility of basing a total world view on "science" alone; and those who are simply (and quite unscientifically) unclear about what "science's" ethically skeptical world view really comes to. In his latest book, Out of My Later Years 114-116 (1950), Dr. Einstein seems to come closer to the view that a fully open-minded science might find much new to tell us about scientific foundations for human value choices. 18 Smith, Objectives and Objectivity in Science in Education fob Professional Responsibility 66, 67 (1948).</page><page sequence="11">70 Journal of Legal Education [Vol. 3 Professor Smith would claim that he does not deny man, and in his individual professional performance as a medical scientist he is of course a benefactor of man. In justice further it is to be recorded that Pro- fessor Smith declares in his credo: "Viewed biologically the maximaliza- tion of human satisfactions is the only ultimate goal of lif e.,y He cites with justifiable pride the accomplishments of medical science in helping the human "living organism to resist the forces that tend to destroy it, to avoid pain and disability and death, to feed itself and satisfy its physi- cal and emotional needs ... to meet these basic biological require- ments. . . . " 19 And yet Professor Smith does deny man, because above man he sets a dehumanized science. Here are his words :20 Science is not a reformer. ... If tomorrow science discovers some equa- tion more portentous than Einstein's equation converting matter into energy, science will explore it though it threatens to destroy mankind, or worse, reduce him to a more aggravated state of misery than he now endures. Science has no humanitarian ends in view. That is why it has achieved its goals. And in keeping with this right which he claims for scientists to pursue "science" equally in the name of death and in the name of life, in fickle service to brute or to man, into Hell or towards Heaven, Professor Smith in an access of quite unscientific semantics envisages his monster's readi- ness to take on as a "social function" whatever program "society" desires even though it be the destruction of society's members :21 The expectation of life for a typical male baby born in the United States has increased from 39 years in 1850 to 64 years in 1945. Is this a social gain? No, if society desires to bring the largest number of babies into the world in the shortest possible time, for it would seem that at the present stage of our social and economic evolution there is not room for an indefi- nite number of creatures to live happily on the face of the earth ; yes, if so- ciety desires that a relatively few babies shall have a superior opportunity for economic success and personal happiness. Is medicine concerned with these if 's, and's and but's? No. When society wants less babies medicine will apply itself intelligently to that problem. When society wants life to be shortened instead of lengthened, medicine will apply itself to the task. There was in central Europe a "society" of recent and accursed memory, that declared such wants as Professor Smith portrays in his last sentence, and medicine there did indeed "apply itself to the task." I regret that I do not have available for my scientist readers the citation of a certain 19 id. at 73. ?o id. at 74. 2i Id. at To.</page><page sequence="12">1950] Philosophical Values and Legal Education 71 verdict pronounced not long ago by an American overseas tribunal against several practitioners of that kind of "medicine." Apart from the point that "society" is not an abstraction but a body of human individuals (including individual scientists) who are each and all responsible to their fellow-men and to themselves for the stand they take on major social decisions - and to stand aside is not to take a stand - apart from this, we clamor to know, upon what meat doth this our scientist feed that he is grown so great? By what chain of ideas is a thinker brought to this system of Professor Smith's where emancipation of the scientist can spell enslavement of the human race? I shall summarize the chain of ideas developed by Professor Smith himself in his argument : 22 (1) The scientist's only motive for working, besides the economic one, is "pure curiosity, a restless psychologic state frequently experienced by the fishes, birds, and mammals, and particularly by the anthropoid apes and man. History reveals that all of science, and indeed all intellectual reorientation, has come out of the desire of the inquiring mind to explore the universe." (2) . . to be successful, scientific exploration must be unin- hibited by or must overcome opposing preconception and tradition" ; by the same token, science's own discoveries are "always held sub- ject to re-examination and re-interpretation. No scientist ever permanently makes up his mind on any subject." (3) Thus, "science recognizes neither a priori nor a posteriori certi- tudes." This means that science can recognize "no Values in upper case type," and indeed today such Values lie in ruins, demolished by science. Professor Smith catalogues these monuments to man's pitiful insistence on incurring the wrath of science. Here are Pro- fessor Smith's trophies: Truth (man "tends to accept that some of his immediate beliefs are eternal and irrefragable") ; Inspira- tion ("or Revealed Truth") ; Faith (at best, "an apotheosis of the unknown" - "after fifty centuries ... a blind alley") ; Natural Law ("In Nietzsche's words 'the laws of nature are the remains of mythological dreaming'"); Love ("The contemporary philosopher recognizes the essential indignity of man and his emo- tions") ; and Progress (in nature there is "only process, an arrow pointed at both ends"). (4) This demolition of Values, while it unfetters science, confronts "proud man" with "the task of spelling out his destiny in lower case type.

He can find justification for the energies of life and scientific exploration in his own biological nature and in its need to integrate itself with its environment. (5) "The first ethic towards the integration of the organism with its environment is honesty. Honesty is not a Value, but only the best expedient if we are to deal effectively with nature and with each other/' The right to be honest must not be trammelled. Hence, the right of the scientist to pursue his explorations wherever they may lead is uncompromisable - even, as we ha'^e seen, if the sought compromise aims at soliciting science to uplift men, not to degrade them. (6) But the clincher in Professor Smith's argument for his charter of scientific licentiousness is most strange, for it transforms his scien- tist from Upper Case Übermensch to lower case lackey. Interest- ingly enough, it also marks a final disintegration of any merit his antecedent argument might claim in point of "logic." This clincher of Professor Smith's is accomplished in a passage (previously noted) where he pledges the service of medicine indiscriminately to the shortening and the lengthening of human life, abdicating to "society" the determination of which of these optional "social func- tions" medicine shall perform. So we see that the scientist here is no longer a free-ranging soul acknowledging no master except "pure curiosity," and no human pur- pose except maximum biological adjustment; a scientist hewing faith- fully to those two concepts might not be the most creative fellow one can imagine, but at least he would not be a menace. True, there is menace enough in the "pure curiosity" formula as Professor Smith develops it, but he does seem to curb it with the biological utility formula. How- ever, Professor Smith was not content to stop here, even though his own logic refused to accompany him further. For when he went on to shackle his scientist to the servitude of a spurious, nihilistic "social function," he abandoned his own concept of biological utility, and he anarchized his scientist even more revoltingly than by the formula of "pure curiosity" ; under the latter formula the scientist might still claim to be something more dignified than a little boy picking the wings from flies, under the new formula he is the hope of mankind's butchers. Now, how was it possible for a distinguished scientist and humane citizen like Professor Smith to stand forth as the prophet of a doctrine that flings open the gates to such horrors? The answer to this intriguing question might be sought along the following paths :</page><page sequence="14">1950] Philosophical Values and Legal Education 73 1. The issue Professor Smith has brought forward is not a novel one. It is probably the oldest, and, if it is not the greatest 23 issue of western philosophy, it is certainly the most important of all philosophical issues that impinge upon the worldly destinies of man. And nevertheless it is a false issue. The most extreme and probably the most familiar form in which the issue has been posed is, "Is life worth living ?" Among the more satis- factory forms in which the issue may be stated are : affirmation of human values versus ethical skepticism or negation; the dignity versus the in- dignity of man's nature and evolutionary direction; whether men can intelligently espouse high hopes and great causes when many scientists and philosophers teach that nothing is certain, least of all any universal truths or philosophical absolutes, that no values are provable, and that any particular value-objective is ultimately neither provably better nor provably worse than any other, including its own diametrical opposite. This issue has often been lost sight of behind the smoke of a great series of inter-related philosophical battles whose real importance was that even the greatest of them were only engagements in this larger ideological war over man's right to believe in and live by aspirations, without having to feel like a primitive or a fool. These inter-related subordinate philosophical issues of which I speak are known by familiar names in the history of ideas: the relationship between thinking and being, the relationship between subject and object, appearance versus reality, the idea versus the object, mind versus matter, idealism versus materialism. Philosophers customarily consider as primary these latter issues which I have relegated to secondary status. My thought in doing this was that these latter issues, as to the relationship between what is inside us and what is outside us, do in turn head up into the question of what tone our lives shall take on from study of those basic man-world relationships. At any rate, there is "primariness" enough in this epic scene for all to share. The important point is to note that Professor Smith has got hold of a very important and a very persistent issue. If he has also got a bear by the tail - and I shall return to my claim that Professor Smith's issue is a false one - that is not Professor Smith's predicament alone but ours too, for his bear is a very big and a very durable beast, one that flails his nihilistic tail about in mighty and sus- 23 The reservation is not mine, and I repudiate it. I do not join in the widely prevalent attitude of our contemporary western philosophers that Copernicus' dis- covery of heliocentrism, by ousting man from the physical center of the cosmos, rendered him unfit thereafter for his former place at the center of philosophy. This is not the occasion to debate this literally cosmic issue, and my general view- point concerning it is in any case sufficiently indicated at various points throughout the body of this paper.</page><page sequence="15">74 Journal of Legal Education [Vol. 3 tained strokes whose sweep is all the broader the more its radius is lengthened by appendaged philosophers and scientists. 2. The chief handicap faced by the skeptic of ethics or of life in winning adherents to his philosophy is that to most people it seems a foolish thing to bother about such a question as "Is life worth living ?" ; and as for the more sophisticated and less extreme variants of the ques- tion, most people again simply do not see any real problem, or they shrink from such deep philosophical waters. In my own course in legal philosophy no other point has proved so difficult for my students to grasp as the perception of the reasons for the persistency of this philosophical issue. Partly this inability reflects the analytical difficulty of the subject matter, but partly also it reflects an intuition that there is something phony about a question which thousands of generations of men have each successively rendered moot by the reiterated fait accompli of siring for- ward the race and thrusting onward its cultural evolution. • Notwithstanding all this, we do have to bother about the question. Wise and good men down through the ages have pressed it upon us in powerful arguments. Although in its extremest form ("Is life worth living?") the question has operated as an active challenge to only an (Occasional deeply contemplative or tortured soul and perhaps to a goodly number of young people in their Weltschmerz stage of maturation, never- theless the question in one or another of its variants has operated in subtle and disintegrative ways to produce untold social miseries. It has caused so much enervation among the mass of mankind and especially among those talented individuals to whom society looks for leadership, that the vitality and the aspirational spirit needed for democratic social advance have often by this means been made inadequate to the social task. The net historical consequences of the persistency of ethical skepticism have been support for reaction and retardation of progress. Ethical skepticism (whatever its earnest sponsors may intend) is the philosophical expression of the anti-democratic spirit. Not every philosophical theory attains to the status of a social institu- tion. This one has. False theories, false institutions, since they cannot survive among an informed people, die out unless their energies can find employment in the perennially flourishing enterprise of keeping the people uninformed; since an informed people will not receive them, they must seek haven elsewhere, which can mean only among the people's enemies. An institution, a theory, so perfectly adapted as is ethical skepticism for the service not of society but of society's exploiters, quick- ly finds its usefulness appreciated in the latter circles, and thereby its career is made. It is secure then, as long as its patrons are. And so if, with the founders of all the great monotheistic religions of the world, if</page><page sequence="16">1950] Philosophical Values and Legal Education 75 likewise with Aquinas, Spinoza, Rousseau, Darwin, Emerson, and John Dewey (the faint-hearted ones among us may today pardonably omit here the further ratifying voice of Karl Marx), if with these thinkers we take that view of human society which is expressed in the imagery of a single "organism" Man, it may profit us interestingly to ponder whether, at any particular stage in human history, ethical skepticism as a social- organic adaptation has served the evolutionary adaptive survival needs of the entire collective human "organism," or of only that one of its many parts called the status quo. 3. In this paper, a thorough treatment is not possible, of course, for the history of the skeptical idea in western thought. The reluctance I should feel about presuming to telescope in a few pages the philosophical intricacies of ages and the careful writings of others on so vast a sub- ject, is less keen in this instance because, as I earlier warned24, and as the reader by now must have perceived, what I have to say on the subject is cast in terms that represent largely my own historical interpretations and evaluations of ethical skepticism. Further, I am obliged by way of preliminary to develop at some length the meanings I attach to certain terms which have been much threshed by others, and in this too I am taking the liberty of proceeding with a minimum of scholarly annota- tions.25 My view of the evolution of the skeptical idea emphasizes, along with the social determinants already mentioned (and to be more fully devel- oped below), the relationship between "rational" and "non-rational" hu- man functioning. I turn therefore to a rather full elaboration of the latter two terms as I use them in this paper. A historical sketch of the skeptical idea will follow. I employ the term "non-rational" to describe an important part of hu- man psychic or mental functioning; "rational" functioning is, in the present terminology, the remainder of the psyche or mind. "Non-ra- tional" to me has no necessarily invidious meaning. Nor does "rational" constitute for me a term of unvarying approbation. Insofar as "non-rational" functioning is associated with unquestioning acceptance of authority or dogma, or with superstition, belief in magic, 24 See note 5, supra. 25 in his preface to Don Quixote , Cervantes bemoaned that he would he charged with offering to the world nothing "but a dry, insipid Legend, not worth a Rush . . . without either Quotations on the Margin, or Annotations at the End, which other Books . . . have to set them off. ... I want all these Embellishments and Graces . . . I do not so much as know what Authors I follow . . . be- sides I am naturally lazy, and love my Ease too well to take the Pains of turning over Authors for those Things which I can express as well without it." Miguel de Cervantes, Don Quixote (Ozell's Revision of the Translation of Peter Motteux) xx-xxi (1930).</page><page sequence="17">76 Journal of Legal Education [Vol.3 miracles, or other supernatural phenomena, I do consider it culturally regressive because it tends to block development of its indispensable psy- chic companion, "rational" functioning (to be defined below) ; and be- cause by bemusing and entorporing men it makes them easier prey for exploitation. This is especially true of unquestioning acceptance of dogma and authority, a primitive trait for which nothing good can be said. However, as to the others of the culturally inferior aspects of "non-rational" functioning just mentioned (supernatural beliefs), I do not regard them as necessarily wholly false from a sound psychological viewpoint, which is to say from a sound rational-materialist-scientific viewpoint. A true scientific attitude, a rational-materialist "curiosity" free of dogmatic limitation, might discover that even these primitive forms of the "non-rational" are worth serious study, and not merely from a cultural-anthropological point of view. For they may be mani- festations of a wondrousness of material interpénétration between (1) the configuration of animate matter which is the human mind (and body), and (2) whichever ones of the infinite number of material con- figurations of the cosmos (animate and inanimate) may operate on the mind (or directly on other cells or even molecules or atoms or sub-atomic entities of the body) to produce, in as yet unanalyzable ways, these in- ferior forms of non-rational functioning. By such a study, rational- materialist scientists might learn, for example, that the seemingly un- quenchable impulse man has displayed since earliest times towards vari- eties of supernaturalism ranging from magic to higher religion, cannot be tested and rejected as unfit quite so cavalierly as is often done. For if the supernaturalistic or religious impulse should turn out to be a material phenomenon, intricately expressed as man's material psychic response to material stimuli, science would be obliged to search for those stimuli, for their patterns, for their materialist cosmic meaning, even though the human psychic expressions and responses I speak of have until now assumed blurred, darkled, inferior forms from a materialist- scientific viewpoint. Later in this paper, in another connection, I shall explore further the compelling - even though in the present stage of human knowledge they remain speculative - avenues of scientific hypothesis that might be opened up by some such widening of rational and materialist conceptions as above outlined. I say such a scientific quest has compelling attraction because in that way might lie a more satisfying synthesis of human ethical and aspirational urges with cosmic reality and purpose than has been possible heretofore for non-religious thinkers. Continuing now with my statement of the ways in which I employ "non-rational" and "rational" :</page><page sequence="18">1950] Philosophical Values and Legal Education 77 Such functionings as art, love, altruism, honor, and group solidarity (as expressed for example in the belief in democracy) - in short the aes- thetic, the ethical, the feeling sides of man - these could not be thought culturally regressive or inferior in any sense, and they belong to the "non- rational. ^ " If there is value in the suggestions I have above outlined for broader study of the inferior forms of the non-rational, then a fortiori a truly free rational study of the material interpénétrations between these superior non-rational processes and their material-world stimuli might prove enlightening for science and discomfiting for the ethical skeptics among its ranks. Now for our definition of "rational" : "Rational" functioning is usu- ally associated in the first place with "thinking," rather than with "feel- ing." Further, the type of thinking that we call "reason" or "rational" is distinctive for its acceptance of methods or rules known as "logic." The basic purpose of logical method is to discover the identities or the differ- ences, the presence or absence of common features, the relationship or lack of relationship, among two or more thoughts or two or more things. This is also expressed by speaking of "classification" and the making of "distinctions." Analysis and synthesis, the highest forms of rational thought, are built upon classification and differentiation; however that type of synthesis which results in original hypotheses often also depends upon creative psychic (mental) resources of the thinker which belong, like art, to the "non-rational" functioning. Further, "rational" thinking in modern times is associated with "science" or "naturalism" ; here "reason" becomes a union between the rules of "logic" and the observable data of physical nature. The gulf between rational and non-rational is widest when the rational takes this latter form and the non-rational appears in the form of superstition, supernaturalism, etc. So we see that in its epistemological capacities, in its suitability as a tool whereby man may obtain comprehension of the world, "rational science" is a mixture of potencies, sharpnesses, and healthy disciplines because of what it includes on the one hand, and incompletenesses and constrictions because of what it excludes on the other hand. Everyone knows that there are several important problems which science and reason have not yet solved, in fact have not even made a start at solving. One of these is, why does a grouping of material mole- cules (man as materialist science sees him) enjoy a beautiful picture, feel stirred by a noble concept? In the view I take of these things it is not only understandable but inevitable that such problems should be be- yond our present science and our present reason. For - taking the ma- terialist approach - it seems to me that what a human molecule-cluster</page><page sequence="19">78 Journal of Legal Education [Vol. 3 must be doing when he responds to beauty and to exalted thoughts is this. He must be functioning within some kind of material framework or system in which these responses of his represent an inter-action be- tween himself and something in the system. But a material system hav- ing the properties to evoke such responses in live molecule-clusters must be operating under some kind of process in which the response mecha- nisms and the evocative mechanisms are very closely linked, very much in reflection of each other, so to say. And if this is true, if the material cosmos is a factor in man's quest for beauty and grandeur,26 we have got a picture of that cosmos which "science" and "reason" cannot pos- sibly conceive of so long as their view of matter is narrowly atomistic rather than interpenetratedly organic, so long as their materialist concept is so constricted by methodological austerities as to exclude absolutely all possibility that "matter" in its cosmic dimension might be the ally of human progress, so long as they refuse to see that their "logical," "dis- ciplined" denial of man might also be a denial of far more wonderful materialist processes than "are dreamt of in [their] philosophy." Since science and reason thus foreclose themselves from discovering ethical affirmations in a materialist framework, they are bound to preach un- qualified ethical skepticism, for they will not of course follow the only other path to affirmation, non-materialistic religion. There is special irony in the skeptical conclusions of a thinker like Professor Smith, for he has glimpsed and passed by one prime scientific datum that might have led him up affirmational avenues akin to those just suggested. I refer to his treatment of the concept, "scientific curiosi- ty." He states, and I suppose rightly, that curiosity is what drives man to new intellectual discovery. But he displays a strangely unscientific lack of curiosity as to the reasons why men are driven by curiosity. What is Professor Smith afraid of finding out? What unsettlement of what comfortable, tight, little elite scientific isolation are our men of "reason" and "science" afraid might come from a free inquiry into the larger biological evolutionary meaning of the curiosity urge in man? One wonders whether Professor Smith's adoption of Söderberg's phrase "the incurable loneliness of the soul,"27 is really done in sadness, is really an instance of Gibbon's "melancholy doubt obtruding itself upon the reluctant mind," or whether it is the decadent slogan written on all the banners that flutter fitfully from the insecure battlements of all the ivory towers of history. 26 In his essay on Beauty , Emerson notes Goethe's statement: "The beautiful is a manifestation of secret laws of Nature, which, but for this appearance, had been forever concealed from us." 6 Tiie Complete Works of Ralph Waldo Emerson 253 (Cent. ed. 1904). 27 Buck Hill Falls Report 73 (1948).</page><page sequence="20">1950] Philosophical Values and Legal Education 79 Now why is man driven by curiosity? Professor Smith glimpsed - fruitlessly, alas - the road to a possible answer, not in his discussion of "curiosity" (which he did not as such pursue), but in his discussion of "honesty," which we saw earlier he described (rightly again in my opin- ion) as "the first ethic towards the integration of the organism with its environment." He saw that the biological organism man needs honesty "as the best expedient ... to deal with nature and with each other."28 Here Professor Smith opened a way to possible wonders - Is man in truth at his best when he lives by Truth? Is his capacity for recognizing and acting on true data of nature possibly something more meaningful than a Darwinian capacity for mere direct biological adaptation and control? Is. nature indifferent to man? Is she equally content when man's truth capacity harmonizes him with her and when his untruths produce the discord of premature death or life-denying life? Is there no cosmic reference in the fact that man flourishes as he does when truth is his un- adulterated nourishment ? Is the truth urge no more than a social con- vention born of decorum and a narrow biological realism? Or is it, as Emerson said,29 a sign that a man is a fagot of thunderbolts. All the elements pour through his sys- tem ; he is the flood of the flood and fire of the fire ; he feels the antipodes and the pole as drops of his blood . . . His duties are measured by that instrument he is ; and a right and perfect man would be felt to the centre of the Copernican system. We see then that our conventional "science" and "reason" are unable to deal with the problem of ethical affirmation or with its aesthetic and intellectual data. It is understandable, indeed as I said inevitable, that such a "science" and "reason" should run away from the problem, cam- ouflaging their retreat by the ostrich device of pronouncing the challenge unreal. Professor Smith, as we saw, drifted into the promising affirma- tional waters of biological utility only to steer back quickly to the strange- ly more congenial breakers of denial where he invites us all to founder with him. More intriguing perhaps than the question why this species of "science" and "reason" cannot deal with the affirmation problem, is the question why it refuses to try . Further light is shed on both of these questions when we survey the history of the skeptical idea - the topic which I introduced at the outset of this section and deferred in favor of developing the meanings I attach to the terms "rational" and "non- rational." My reasons for the detour will now appear. 4. For primitive man a skeptical view of human life, much less of reality in general, is impossible. The non-rational processes of the primi- 28 Id. at 73-74. 29 IV The Complete Works of Ralph Waldo Emerson 283 (Cent. ed. 1904).</page><page sequence="21">80 Journal of Legal Education [Vol. 3 tive mind may conjure superstitious attitudes of gloom or even of doom, but these are not skeptical attitudes. They are affirmational attitudes, as are all of primitive man's, even when the proposition being affirmed is that the evil spirits are in control. Similarly, for religious man the skeptical view is impossible, by defi- nition. Faith excludes its own denial.30 Now, it is instructive to observe that the common element in the re- spective rejections of skepticism by primitive man and religious man is the non-rational. In primitive man the non-rational functioning is de- cisive on all issues because it is the only mental process he has developed. In religious man it is decisive on the skepticism issue because faith, the unshakable point in his credo and therefore the strong-point against which every skeptical assault must break itself, is rooted in the non- rational and not the rational side of his functioning.31 Further, however, so strongly innate in man is the affirmation urge that it operates irrespective of primitivism, irrespective of religion, irre- spective, in short, of any predominantly non-rational cultural outlook. The urge , even though its expression tends to be repressed, is as strong among non-religious-minded men of the contemporary western ration- alist culture as among their unrepressed religious fellows. This pri- marily non-rational urge, then, is not stilled by the rise of rationalism. Shall this archetypal urge towards affirmation, shall this thing of ours that is rooted in the immemorial and fed by the inexhaustible sap of ele- mentality itself, shall this mature urge in man be clamored down by the infantile whoops of "scientists" and "rationalists" who point their skepti- cal toy-guns and yell "bang ! bang ! you're dead !" ? 5. So far as historical records reveal, ethical skepticism as a general philosophical idea 32 developed in the west (among the Greeks) during the 30 Later I discuss the interesting social and psychic process by which an intense religious renuncíate may paradoxically fall into total skeptical enervation. It is also pertinent in this connection to recall the ingenious "skepticism" of Pascal, a deeply religious thinker who reasoned that man's inability to know anything leaves him no alternative but to trust in God. 31 1 cannot agree with religious philosophers who "prove the Tightness of belief by "rational" or "scientific" methods, e. g., Le Comte Du Nouy, Human Destiny (1947). I consider it an unnecessary and an undignified abdication of the authentic claims of man's non-rational side to thrust upon them (at least indiscriminately) a rational Protector. It is permissible to doubt whether, in its present stage of evolu- tion, man's rational functioning is ready to ascend from condominium to dominium. My own guess as to future expansion of man's rational capacities is worked out elsewhere in this paper, where I explore the possibilities inhering in the application of really open-minded rational methods of study to the materialist foundations of non-rational affirmation. My own guess , again, is that while man may never "prove" the "scientific" Tightness of religious belief, he will one day prove that the ethical affirmational impulses expressed in all higher religions are materially determined and of cosmic scope. 32 I am not speaking here of the specifically anti-religious ideas - the perennial "godlessness" of "free spirits" - which have presumably existed as a type of in- dividual unorthodoxy or "skepticism" from earliest antiquity.</page><page sequence="22">1950] Philosophical Values and Legal Education 81 sixth and fifth centuries B.C. Its appearance at this point in the develop- ment of western culture is interesting as a matter of timing. It con- curred with - more accurately it post-curred by a generation or two - the emergence of the Greek mind from the cradle of mythology and the other characteristic non-rational psychic paraphernalia of dawn cultures. Despite their historical concurrence, however, reason and rationalist skepticism were not siblings. Reason was the child of a marvellously fertile, non-rational psychic matrix. Rationalist skepticism was at best a spurious sort of afterbirth. The first of the western philosophers who pursued reason as a method of thinking - the Milesian school and the Pythagoreans - were untainted by skepticism. They and the later followers of Pythagoras - the Pla- tonists, the Cynics, and the Stoics - were history's most powerful ethical affirmers with the possible exceptions of the great religious leaders (of whom indeed Pythagoras might be counted as one) and the various modern political humanists from the American and French Revolutions to the Russian and Chinese Revolutions. To be sure, the ethical principles of many non-skeptical rationalist phi- losophers of antiquity, as of many among their progeny down to the present day, were in important respects socially reactionary. Plato and Aristotle were the first historically effective systematizers of the diaboli- cal doctrines of human slavery, social elite-ism, and authoritarian politi- cal sovereignty. The Pythagoreans performed a like disservice in an- achronistically fastening on modern man the most terrible of all cultural servitudes, the intellectual dogma yoke of the primitive mind. But es- sentially even among these, and wholly so among the greatest of the Cynics and Stoics, the ethical direction of the ancient fathers of western rationalism was towards the affirmation of man's dignity and destiny. I said earlier that the net historical consequences of ethical skepticism have been reactionary, anti-democratic. The first western skeptics did not start out as ethical skeptics ; pristine rationalism had to pass through two corruptions before philosophers could re-spawn it as ethical skepti- cism. The degenerative sequence was rationalism, rationalist cognitional skepticism, rationalist normative skepticism, and, by obvious inference from the latter, the socially applied final degeneracy of ethical skepti- cism. The first rationalist skeptics, whose leaders Protagoras and Gór- gias were the founders of Sophism, employed the newly-forged tools of reason to dismantle man's knowledge processes, but not for the pur- pose of putting the pieces together in a different way. They taught that man cannot know anything, much less with certainty, and less still by his physical senses. In its pure form, such a doctrine makes life itself impossible, for the devotee cannot decide anything, even to eat and drink. 3 Journal of Legal Ed.No.l - 6</page><page sequence="23">82 Journal of Legal Education [Vol. 3 As a matter of fact also, in this pure form the doctrine is logically irre- futable; Hume, the dean of modern cognitional skeptics, wrought an invulnerable logical system. But logic is not, as Justice Holmes reminds us, the only arena in which men wage life. Experience, whose dictates even the skeptics bow to - there is no record of any skeptic who lay back and withered away 33 - has confined the pure skeptic doctrine within the museum vaults of philosophy. On its purely cognitional side, the skepticism of Protagoras and Geor- gias, moreover, was in one respect culturally progressive - it defied the dogmatic rationalist cosmologies of the time. Indeed the usefulness of the skeptic idea in combating dogma and authoritarianism is obvious, and if I do not dwell more on this point it is only because others never tire of doing so. Moreover, a major emphasis of this paper is that this prog- ressive incidence is not the only social incidence of skepticism even in its pure form, and it is seldom the incidence of the evolved form, ethical skepticism. I have previously alluded to the socially enervating effects of skepti- cism. The cultural militancy of Protagoras and Górgias exhausted itself in cosmological debates. History barely notes their contribution in this field. The anti-cognitional enthusiasms which induced them to wage these debates were overshadowed by the clouds of anti-normative dust they raised upon the earth. Protagoras and Georgias, and their Sophist followers Pyrrho, Timon, et al., are best (and rightly) remembered as apologists for all social convention and established institutions, as men- tors of the aristocratic Greek youth, and as pillars of a rigid social con- servatism whose foundations they supported in the most effective proven way - namely, by denying the knowability of any values by which a social status quo may be tested. An outright reactionary apologist dogma would activate opponents and give them something to aim at, to rally about. A general social opiate avoids such dangers and therefore ac- complishes the desired reactionary result even better. The necessary consequence of such teachings, then, is to deepen social inertia, to ener- vate, as I said, the potential forces of social change. And this in turn, as hardly needs to be pointed out, means the retardation of democratic ad- vance out of the mists and the oppressions of exploitational authoritari- anism. 6. The doctrines of the Greek Sophists entered into the intellectual fabric of the ancient western world. As formal schools of philosophy these skeptical rationalist teachings were more often than not overshad- owed by the affirmational rationalist schools that descended from Plato 33 This may in fact have occurred among medieval religious renunciates whose names history has not preserved. 3 Journal of Legal Ed.No.l</page><page sequence="24">1950] Philosophical Values and Legal Education 83 and Aristotle. But they were abroad in the world, and whether with or without the support of influential intellects (which they often lacked, and for long periods), they displayed a rugged hydra-like vitality for the next two thousand years. This is in fact one of the most interesting pheno- mena in the history of ideas, or perhaps I should say in the history of societies. For I would now invite the reader to consider again my earlier suggestion that a false idea survives only when it is useful to a section of society which is in a position either to wage effective battle on its behalf, or to deter effectively the general social enlightenment that would expose its falseness. Considered in this light the history of skepticism both ethical and gen- eral in the middle ages, for example, is especially revealing. With the spreading influence of the Church as a seminator of simple affirmation based on faith, and with the accompanying development of Aquinas' powerful new philosophical synthesis between Church dogma and the ancient Greek rationalist affirmations, it would have seemed an inhospi- table time for skepticism in any form. And in fact, except for a rare tract of refined and contemplative subtlety by a very much holy-watered sort of "skeptic" like Abelard or William of Occam, no important name illumines the authentic literature of skepticism during the middle ages. Yet, in the very heart of the Church itself, among its closest votaries, the renunciates in and out of the monasteries, the skeptical doctrine ravaged like fire. More interesting still, the doctrine in the form it took among medieval renunciates approached, more nearly than it ever has before or since, its extremest form, "Is life worth living.,, So gravely did the Church regard the menace that the list of nine "deadly sins" from which the commonly enumerated (but variant) "seven" are made up, included, as Professor Henry Sidgwick terms them, the "rather singular sins" Gloominess (tristitia) and Languid Indifference (acedia or acidia ). A little reflection indicates that there was nothing necessarily "singu- lar" in this. The renuncíate attitude at best, even when fortified by the most vigorous affirmation of the articles of faith, tends to follow its own logic, which is after all renunciation , and where shall renunciation halt ? St. Anthony became vulnerable to the Tempter only after his renuncia- tions had proceeded so far as nearly to nullify their own original pur- pose. Renunciation in itself cannot limit itself, and if involuted and re- involuted intricately enough it strangles its affirmational goal and coun- terpoise, the faith that made it seem worthwhile at outset. The renuncí- ate on this basis alone, then, is menaced by the beguilements and stulti- fications of the extremest skepticism. He may indeed fall into a Gloom and a Languid Indifference that would make life seem not worth living;</page><page sequence="25">84 Journal of Legal Education [Vol. 3 when all is renounced, nothing can be affirmed, not even his own physical needs, and then there is in truth nothing but to lie back and wither away. Here the analysis might end, without search for further social meaning in this strange skeptical apparition of the middle ages. But it seems to. me that there is something more. All institutions, religious or secular,, impinge on secular society. Until the golden day when secular conflicts of interests among men either disappear or cease to have effect in men's conduct, everything that every man (including men in the churches) does or refrains from doing must be an impingement on the dynamic of these secular conflicts if it affects in any way what any other man does or re- frains from. The individual religious renuncíate is not withdrawn as an actor from secular history just because he is physically withdrawn from secular society. By that very physical withdrawal alone he has changed pro tanto the disposition of the forces in the social dynamic. So much is obvious. But further, a large-scale program of religious re- nunciation such as occurred in the middle ages not only must have an obvious, important secular impingement, it must also proceed from important secular causes. And obviously again, such a renunciation pro- gram and its contemporaneous secular society must have important inter- actions on each other as time proceeds. In short, large-scale renunciation is a social-historical phenomenon as well as a spiritual one. It has often been noted that the times of Jesus and of St. Augustine, when the major doctrines of Christian renunciation were enunciated,, were times of great social troubles. Augustine's time, in particular, was dominated by the shambles and the general chaos of the fall of Rome. Men in large numbers might well hearken to a call to "forsake" such a world, and so long as the condition of the world did not change very much for the better, even successive generations of renunciates might well preserve in themselves the spiritual stability of a historically fresher renuncíate attitude. But it seems reasonable to consider whether this sort of historical attenuation could go on indefinitely without serious de- stabilization of the renuncíate psyche, even through the pretty continu- ously bad (i. e., renouncable) social times of the centuries from Augus- tine to the reformation. My suggestion is that the extensive renunciate institution of the Medieval Church faced increasing trouble as it loosened from its historical moorings. A thousand years of earthly history must inevitably put strain on the Augustinián renunciate doctrine that directed men's eyes only to another world. The social strain, moreover, would be felt not only in direct ways by the renunciates within their inner world, and by the men of the outer world, but in all the manifold inter- active ways in which the strains of each would be mutually communi- cated to the other.</page><page sequence="26">1950] Philosophical Values and Legal Education 85 The renuncíate doctrine of the middle ages, then, in the view I am here submitting, suffered a weakening of its inner integration because it lost its social reference. Even when the renuncíate doctrine sprang fresh from the minds of the great religious leaders who were expressing an (at least arguably) authentic response to the social conditions of their time, the doctrine already in its very nature partook as much of an escape from worldly ethical responsibility as it did of a striving towards other- worldly devotion. Particularly in its logical nature, as previously sug- gested, the doctrine carried a powerful inner impulse towards literal and total renunciation, in short towards its own skeptical disintegration. But what was this logical self-disintegrative tendency but an expression of the (again, at least arguably) dubious social foundations of renunciation - a dubiousness which existed from the doctrine's earliest days and be- came increasingly so as the attrition of centuries and the unconscionable ethics of feudalism intensified the very social-ethical contradictions out of which Christian renunciation was born. A doctrine thus tied to social disintegration, yes to skepticism in mat- ters of worldly values, cannot hope for enduring affirmational stability when its province is all of society and not merely a handful of devoted contemplatives. Under such disintegrative conditions the attempt to resist spiritual skepticism by focussing on an exalted affirmational center is severely handicapped; and if the circle then flies apart in skeptical fragments for devotees who are become "gloom-ridden" and "languidly indifferent/' it is perhaps but a sign that (as in Augustine's time) God gives haven more readily to them to whom man refuses it, than (as in later times) to them who are the refusers of man. In justice, however, to the medieval renunciates whose fall was into the skeptical pit, it should be remembered that the remaining roster of the "deadly sins" •( Pride, Avarice, Anger, Gluttony, Unchastity, Envy, and Vainglory) also represented the moral experience of the monastic life. The Church saw that if betrayal of the renuncíate idea could be accomplished in two ways of "deadly" self-denial, there were yet seven ways to the same damnation by sins of self-indulgence. At the same time, the entire roster of nine suggests also the pressures and the strains within an institution and a society whose universal renuncíate creed helped hold the mass of mankind in a chivalrous but quite unethical slavery. That the peril of spiritual instability among the Church's re- nunciates moreover was not limited to the cases of despairing skeptics, was of course most vividly shown in the charges of monastic fleshly excesses that figured so prominently in the Protestant reformation. I cite these unhappy facts of history for their bearing on my thesis that even so affirmational an institution as the Medieval Church may be</page><page sequence="27">86 Journal of Legal Education [Vol. 3 powerless to extirpate spiritual skepticism, if the secular interests which skepticism in all its forms ultimately serves and strengthens are likewise served and strengthened by the net historical influence of the spiritual- affirmational expounders themselves; in other words, if the affirmational doctrine being expounded has been trimmed so as to renounce to some men what rightly should be shared by all. 7. One of the most flexibly adaptable organisms in nature is the hu- man social status quo, which knows so well how to sustain its essential survival interests in the face of forces pressing for change. Likewise the skeptical doctrine which is its cultural servant knows how to evolve in response to changing historical conditions. The inter-action of the skep- tical idea with social enervation and exploitation grows more complex, then, as social complexities intensify. The rationalist foundations on which skepticism claims to build groan ever more protestingly under the ponderous edifice, which if it were ever completed would be mankind's tombstone. And when man, by his head and his heart, with all the "thunderbolt'' energy of his rational and non-rational powers that Emer- son saw, staunchly goes on affirming himself and denying his deniers, they reappear in new forms of refined cunning. It is seldom, indeed, that the skeptic possesses the basic vigor and integrity to announce his creed with the forthrightness of our much belabored but really quite at- tractive Professor Smith. Hume did so, and everyone respects him for it. But the valiant Humes and Smiths are rare in the history of skeptical thought; and they are far less disintegrative in their social influence than the insidious tribe of lesser scribes and reason- juggler s who like to imagine that the spittle they lick from the feet of their skeptic Idol has not dripped down over him from the mouth of Mammon. In the past hundred years or so this tribe has flourished as at no other time in his- tory. It is today fastened on the neck of science and of society. It will yet be thrown off, even as many times in the past. The social protector (and beneficiary) of modern skepticism is an in- stitution in whose honored name we have often sunk deep into dishonor. I refer to the greatest of modern western social contributions, the indi- vidualist idea. What a paradox it is that the proudest triumph of west- ern affirmation, the establishment of the dignity and value of each human individual, the vision that each man belongs to eternity and to infinity, what a sardonic thing it is that this glory of our affirmational glories should ever adopt as its philosophical creed the skeptical text that for so many centuries was the bible of its deniers. The struggle to establish the individualist ideal has been the struggle for human freedom. In the highest sense, it has been man's struggle to go on evolving from the prison sameness of primal clay towards the il-</page><page sequence="28">1950] Philosophical Values and Legal Education 87 limitable differentiation of the free universal mind. We see this process of unceasing evolutionary diversification throughout animate nature, in the multiplicitous formation of spccies and individual variations gener- ally, and in the refreshment of culture that occurs in our own species whenever in history large numbers of individuals are freed for creative self-development. It is a plausible enlargement of Darwinian survivalist theory, in my opinion, to suggest that this continuous differentiation or individuation in the life process expresses the biological urge of animate matter, not merely to survive, but by mutualizing itself with the enrich- ing and endless differentiations of its material world, to shine with the sun, to soar with the heavens, to throb and to flourish with everything that lives and flowers. The energy and the goal of this evolutionary drive as manifested in man, some call God, some call teleological Nature, some call materialist affirmation. But its integer is always the individual human being, and its theme is always his affirmation. The struggle of the individual to differentiate himself is necessarily waged in a social framework. It is idle therefore to dream of attaining fullness of self outside that framework. Psychoanalysts are familiar with the forms of neurosis that are the reward of men whose wish for something higher takes the shape of a wish to stand above man. Later in this article I shall develop more systematically this subject of social inter-relatedness as it bears on man's evolution towards his self-afifirma- tional goals. My emphasis here is on the ways in which the individualist quest has been deflected from its natural course - that of the evolving individual in an evolving society - by asocial forces whose pretended phi- losophical justification is a tissue of skeptical sophistries. A few familiar historical references will be illustrative. The great ob- stacle to free human development - L e., to effective individualism - has been economic exploitation of man by his fellows. This exploitation has taken two broad forms, which tend to coalesce as the organization of so ciety becomes cast in a governmental-legal framework. The prototypes of these two forms of exploitation are chattel slavery and malevolent des- potism. The broader exploitative forms which these represent are the private and the political. Now it is an interesting fact of history that the thrust towards liberty and against exploitation has been more conspicuously successful in the political field than in the private. This is true both in the actual social incidence of the two struggles and in their ideological accomplishments. Political democracy both as a living reality and as an idea has arrived at a far more secure place in modern western society than has the reality or the idea that private economic activity is a public responsibility. The most usurpational, the most venal political pirate feels compelled nowa-</page><page sequence="29">88 Journal of Legal Education [Vol. 3 days to palm himself of? as the democratic people's choice, but I know of no private wage-cutter, price gouger, or tax-evader who has claimed he was really being a socialist. I stated that the private and the political forms of economic exploita- tion coalesce as society, government, and law become more inter-or- ganized with each other. This truism is also expressed in the idea that a state is the instrument of a society's economic configuration, and that law in its incidences (if not in its terms) bespeaks the same configura- tion.34 Where, as in this country, the economic configuration has had a 34 Here I wish to register my dissent from the view of Marxist theoreticians that the ultimate historical-social determinant is economic. I am acquainted Tith Engels' (e. g., Letters on Historical Materialism; Ludwig Feuerbach and the Out- come of Classical German Philosophy) and Lenin's (e. g., Materialism and Empirio-Criticism) careful explanations that the theory of historical materialism and Marxism's attack on philosophical idealism are not the ridiculously over- simplified apotheosis of economics that Marxism's critics (and many Marxists) conceive. I am aware that informed Marxist writers take into account the whole apparatus of "idealistic" functioning among men, and that they acknowledge the effectiveness of "ideals" as factors in historical change. See, e. g ., Engels' letter to Joseph Bloch, Sept. 21, 1890. "According to the materialist conception of history the determining element in history is ultimately the production and reproduction in real life. More than this neither Marx nor I have ever asserted. If therefore somebody twists this into the statement that the economic element is the only determining one, he transforms it into a meaningless, abstract and absurd phrase. The economic situation is the basis, but the various elements of the super-structure - political forms of the class struggle and its consequences, constitutions established by the victorious class after a successful battle, etc. - forms of law - and then even the reflexes of all these actual struggles in the brains of the combatants: political, legal, philosophical theories, religious ideas . . . [have] . . . their influence upon the course of the historical struggles and in many cases preponderate in determining their form. There is an interaction of all these elements in which, amid all the endless host of ac- cidents (i. e., of things and events, whose inner connection is so remote or so im- possible to prove that we regard it as absent and can neglect it) the economic move- ment finally asserts itself as necessary. Otherwise the application of the theory to any period of history one chose would be easier than the solution of a simple equation of the first degree. "We make our own history, but in the first place under very definite presupposi- tions and conditions. Among these the economic ones are finally decisive. But the political, etc., ones, and indeed even the traditions which haunt human minds also play a part, although not the decisive one." I Karl Marx, Selected Works 381- 382 (Adoratsky ed. 1933). I agree that an ideal or a value judgment which is in conflict with the economic structure of a society can have effective social life only in so far as the economic structure yields it place. That is, such an ideal will operate effectively in social- institutional form, it will cause change in the social organization as distinct from merely operating as a drive toward change, only in so far as the economic founda- tions of the social organization will adapt or give way. My dissent from the Marx- ist position on these questions is not, then, in respect of the specific historical proc- ess that occurs when an anti-status quo ideal having economic consequences is adopted in a society. Where I dissent is on the question of what causes men to advocate such an ideal. And I believe that the Marxist refutation of philosophical idealism is irrelevant to my position. For as indicated heretofore and as will further be developed, the view I take of history posits a broadened scientific-ma- terialist process in which the material cosmos determines that man shall evolve toward those expansive and creative goals we think of as being possible only under</page><page sequence="30">1950] Philosophical Values and Legal Education 89 considerable fluidity owing to expanding frontiers and rapid technologi- cal advance, the more direct forms of exploitation have been less im- portant - excepting always our former negro slavery and its continuing heritage of both agrarian and urban semi-peonage - than in countries of less plenteous or less developed productive capacity. This has made pos- sible in the United States, with much less struggle than in England or France, for example, a persistent vitality of democratic ideas of govern- ment and law. In a word, the ever-present exploitational menace of the private enterprise system has been countered in the United States over a longer period and by a more effective democratic resistance than in any other basically private enterprise society in history.35 non-exploitative democratic conditions. Thus I posit, as anterior to the materialist economic determinants of the Marxist theory of history, materialist ethical deter- minants rooted in man by nature. Again, I agree with the Marxist that man cannot accomplish his wants except by giving them expression in the economic structure of society, but if those wants are for anything more than animal comfort (and they are), then I maintain we are obliged to search for their determinants. And this search describes nothing more than a logical circle if we terminate it with the economic determinants which Marxists say are "ultimate." The Marxist position is ably, but I think ineffectually, argued in Howard Selsam, Socialism and Ethics (1943). A word about Marxist legal theory. Professor Fuller (The Problems of Juris- prudence 65-70 (Temp.ed. 1949) ) describes Soviet annalyses of capitalist or "bour- geois" law as having an over-simplified economic-determinant form. There is noth- ing over-simplified in the passage quoted from Engels earlier in this note. I am not sufficiently versed in Soviet legal writings to know whether Professor Fuller's de- scription is just. It is easy for all of us who are bred in the chivalrous restraints and balances of western analysis and verbal expression to miss an important im- plicit premise in much of Soviet writing and oratory that offends us. We ought to keep in mind that when a Soviet writer calls a westerner a villain he does not necessarily mean that the man is consciously villainous ; he may mean that the net historical effect of the man's impact on society is going to turn out villainous in the intricate inter-active sense of Engels' statement. It is unfortunate, very unfortu- nate, that Soviet writers do not better adapt themselves to this cultural barrier that hampers communication even between advancd intellectuals of the two societies. If Professor Fuller's description of Soviet legal writings about capitalist law should be ill-founded the explanation may lie in some such failure of communication. We may, on the other hand, have here an instance, on the part of the Soviet legal writers, of the kind of over-simplified historical materialism which Engels himself criticized in the letter earlier quoted from, and of which he said, "I cannot exempt many of the more recent 'Marxists' from this reproach, for the most wonderful rub- bish has been produced from this quarter too." Finally, the theories of E. Pasukanis, the Soviet legal writer whom Professor Fuller chiefly has in mind, were substantial- ly departed from by other Soviet authorities after 1936. Professor Harold Berman, in his article entitled The Challenge of Soviet Ixiic (62 Harv.L.Rev. 220, 449 (1948- 49)) suggests that Soviet legal theory of the past twelve years has developed new capacities for integrating within itself non-economic data, including a number of what I suppose Engels would have called "traditions which haunt human minds." Later in this paper I return to the subject of this note, the possibility of founding a vigorous, democratic social ethic on a broadening conception of materialist science that could enable ethical affirmation to break out of the present rationalist-material- ist prison which it shares with ethical skepticism, 35 Not excepting modern England, for that country is no longer basically under the private enterprise system.</page><page sequence="31">90 Journal of Legal Education [Vol. 3 Americans are proud, and justly so, of the political genius that has made our name, the world over, a symbol of the power of a democratic people to keep alive the maxim salus po pulì suprema lex. Even when, in transitory lapses of their traditional democratic vigilance the American people slumber and their government and law seek a welfare that is not salus populi, such is nevertheless the faith in which America's name is honored wherever freedom is honored that our country can come peril- ously close to incongruous dishonor while friends abroad and at home look on bemused. By the same token, however, this very reputation of ours for democratic genius, which makes the reality of our anti-demo- cratic lapses appear unreal (especially when they assume major propor- tions), carries the reassurance also that no such lapse can ever be more than that, a passing lapse. It is not the strength of a democratic people that speaks in its lapses, only its inattention, and history teaches us that that is flimsy stuff for political adventurers to build ambitious policies on. America's democratic capacities to curb exploitation, her proven ca- pacities for democratic resurgence even after serious reactionary lapses, are in a long historical tradition which is not of course confined to this country. This tradition is what I previously referred to as the indi- vidualist idea, and, in its larger meaning, as the freedom quest. The his- tory and the adversities of this tradition are particularly vivid in America, that is, the American experience gives an especially clear illustrative dis- play of the workings (good and bad) of the free individualist struggle generally in modern western history. I refer to the fact that in America, as in the individualist movement of the western world generally, have been combined the energies, sometimes in conjunction and sometimes in antagonism, of two great human drives, the drive for liberty and the drive for property. America's democratic vigor in holding true histori- cal aim on the individualist goal as such, and in checking the appetite of property interests which elsewhere in the world have at times devoured their old comrade liberty, is faltering today as it has never done before. And in terms of the cultural evolutionary process which this expresses - apart, that is, from the accompanying economic process 36 - this faltering of ours represents nothing less than a denial of the individualist idea it- self. I have referred to the paradox in this denial. The cultural mech- anism of the denial has been an unscrupulous union allying one part (property) of an affirmational idea (individualism) with a negational idea (skepticism), against the essence (liberty) of that affirmational idea. The statement of scientific-rationalist skepticism enunciated at Buck Hill 36 See note 34, supra , arid also the later part of this article, where I state my reasons for not positing economic processes as the ultimate historical determinant.</page><page sequence="32">1950] Philosophical Values and Legal Education 91 Falls by Professor Smith contains as I shall bring out in my concluding installment in the next issue of this Journal, a good indication of the way in which among influential American teachers and thinkers, the individ- ualist idea has come to deny its own affirmational foundations and, there- fore, its hope of higher realization. [To Be Concluded ]* * The concluding installment will continue the discussion of the interplay between ethical skepticism and individualism. It will argue that a falsely narrowed in- dividualism needs a skeptical doctrine with which to oppose affirmation of social- ethical values. Absent such a skeptical doctrine, men's "non-rational" impulses towards social relatedness and ethical affirmation would nourish, within the very heart of the individualist creed itself, those humanistic values of relatedness which are inherent in the idea of a democratic, non-exploitational fellowship of equal, individual men. This the western bourgeois status quo must, in its disrelated "in- dividualist" nature, try to prevent. Hence its science, its philosophy, its juris- prudence, its pedagogy (especially at the level of training for the influential pro- fessions), servilely adapt themselves to the indicated cultural chore of purveying that ethical skepticism which serves social reaction by separating men from one another. For ethical skepticism deters men from believing in a multi-individual reference where each individual's life-value might take on objectively-referred af- firmational tones. The adaptive pressures making for cultural servility among our scholars and educators are perhaps nowhere stronger than in the field of legal education. A legal philosophy that dared to be truly uninhibited in subjecting law to normative inquiry, a real study in our law schools of the "theory of justice," would be bound to have unsettling social results, to say the least. But such a legal philosophy and such a law school study program are difficult to achieve because the cultural conditions needed to energize them are lacking so long as our general scientific and philosophical culture scorns the application of broadened scientific methods to the problem of ultimate legal-ethical norms. The historical hatchet-job of ethical skepticism has always been to prevent any such affirmational energizing of science and philosophy. What are the law schools of the world's leading democracy going to do about all this? The paper will conclude with a survey of, and the writer's speculations about, recent scientific researches that open paths to an expansion (both by "rational" and "non-rational" methods) of scientific attitudes towards human value affirmations. ♦</page></plain_text>
