Whether one agrees in detail with its emphasis, or even interpreta- tions, Wolf's valiant attempt to impose coherence and some rational order on the long span that men have inhabited Middle America provides a useful perspective and an overview normally lacking from comparable works; they are generally devoted to one or another shorter time segment, or restricted area, often unconnected with that which preceded or which followed in the total experience. Little but praise can be forthcoming for Wolf's courageous and moderately successful efforts to draw on various categories of source materials and weave them into a single, uninterrupted summary; this is a notable achievement, and a worthy one. While still wishing that adeptness in handling historical materials for post-Contact phenomena had matched that for earlier times, one can still underline the great significance of his tying together and linking the pre-Colonial, Colonial, and National sequences, throwing provisional rope bridges over the disciplinary or intra-disciplinary abysses that often separate specialists of equal good will and competence.

Reviewed by GEORGE KUBLER, Yale University In each generation our understanding of Sahagun expands. Early in this century his position as the first modern ethnographer was confirmed, and now D. Robertson in Mexican Manuscript Painting (1959:162-72, New Haven), has established Saha- gun's close relationship to medieval encyclopedic learning and, in particular, to Bartholomaeus Anglicus in the 13th century. The work of reinterpreting the great 16th century Franciscan scholar will probably continue for another generation or two at least, under the impetus given by the present translation of the Nahuatl texts, compiled by Sahagun from native informants upon whose memories of pre-Conquest society he was able to draw, much as we still can draw upon the live memories of people who remember Europe before the first World War. His purpose was both to extirpate idolatry and to preserve the intricacies of Indian traditions of language. The more we examine his work, the more remarkable is his great design to record the totality of Mexican Indian civilization from the mouths of native informants. Yet it becomes less likely that he surpassed the aims of a Franciscan mis- sionary of his generation by anticipating the ethnographical science of the 19th century, as some students formerly thought. Book Nine gives us a case in point. It pertains to the economic life of that metro- politan portion of the Aztec people who were settled upon the island of Tenochtitlan, where the center of Mexico City now stands. The opening Nahuatl chapters are an economic history compiled in terms of the development of trading in the market places of the island. The account opens "at the time commerce began" in the last quarter of the 14th century, when the merchants still sold as imported goods only colored par- rot feathers. About fifty years later green stones still were not sold, but cotton clothing was being imported to supplement the traditional native garments of maguey fiber. Gold and green stone jewelry appeared only after 1450, and feather capes a little later. The merchant class is discussed in great detail, as we read of their travels, their organization, their function as spies and agents, their rituals, and their high standing in</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 407 the society. Six chapters at the close, of which we had an earlier direct translation into French and German by Eduard Seler, report the craft techniques of the Aztec gold workers and lapidaries. The joining of the two themes of the merchants with the jewelry craftsmen provides a clear indication that Aztec society attained the splendor with which its name is usually associated only after 1450, and that the economic activities of the merchants were a principal factor in the sudden prosperity of the Tenochca people. The most complete recent study of the pre-Conquest Mexican merchant class is by Miguel Acosta Saignes, entitled, "Los Pochteca" (Acta Anthropologica 1, 1945). Acosta's work discusses the spread of Aztec commerce and its relation to Mesoamerican society, as well as the ritual traits of the behavior of the merchant class. Acosta, how- ever, overlooked the clear indications of an economic history outlined above. To be sure, the Spanish text by Sahagun is more compact than the Nahuatl sources. The historical awareness of his native informants, which comes through to us with insistent clarity in Dibble and Anderson's translation, is muted and reduced in the Spanish versions. On this point as on so many others, we now can see that two versions of Sahagun's record of Indian society were available. One is the uncondensed native text as put down from the speakers' mouths, and the other is a Spanish version, directed by Sahagun and intended to edify European readers without offering great difficulties to 16th century understanding. It is still unclear how much Sahagun understood the things his Indian associates told him. In the present case we may wonder whether Sahagun himself followed the drift of the economic history so boldly outlined in the first chapters of Book Nine, when we see how little of it survived in his Spanish text. Teotl and Ixiptlatli: Some Central Conceptions in Ancient Mexican Religion. ARILD HVIDTFELDT. Copenhagen, Denmark: Ejnar Munksgaard, 1958. 182 pp. d.kr. 24,-. Reviewed by CHARLES E. DIBBLE, University of Utah In a section on cult and myth, Hvidtfeldt presents the views of Robertson Smith. He further accepts Smith's view that cult or ritual is primary and myth is secondary or accessory. Whereas Smith was not familiar with the concept of mana, Hvidtfeldt dis- cusses the concept at great length and considers an understanding of the nature of mana as vital to the problem of cult and myth. In the discussion of mana, the dancing mask or masked dancer is a concentration of mana, i.e., "the mask is mana-bearing." Turning to the writings of his teacher, Dr. Svend Pallis, the author sees a course of historical development in which the mana of hunting peoples develops toward fixed dieties, anthropomorphic dieties, in urban agricultural communities. Basic to his thesis is a quotation from Pallis: "Presumably the primitive agriculturist introduced anthro- pomorphism; he thought of everything in the cosmos as human, and all the manas of the cosmos assumed human characteristics.... In urban culture... the idea of a deity becomes firmly established. . . the relation between the god and his image is one of identity.... " Hvidtfeldt turns to Aztec religion to illustrate his theoretical considerations, utiliz- ing the Mexican text materials of Bernardino de Sahagun. One of his reasons for select- ing the Mexican material is that he considers the Aztecs at "the stage which is charac- terized by agriculture and an incipient urbanization." The word teotl is to be translated as god or mana. He concludes: "From a linguistic point of view the word has not been thoroughly investigated, but from a factual point of view we have established usages which must be supposed to be based on concepts of 'mana,' and in such a way that the word teotl itself must be assumed still to have-or at least to have had-a meaning of</page></plain_text>
