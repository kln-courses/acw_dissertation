<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE DIVINE MONOLOGUE AS A CHANNEL OF REVELATION Revelation, whether human or divine, is interpersonal in structure. The word itself "re-velare" refers to a situation in which something is un-veiled for somebody to see. In the Judeo-Christian tradition, the Bible has been read as the Word of God, that is, under the assumption that it conveys to readers across the ages the various disclosures made by God in history. Recent Catholic theology, particularly in the wake of Vatican II, has stressed the dialogical character of Divine Revelation.1 Not only is Biblical Revelation intrinsically and objectively interpersonal, but it is also mediated in the Sacred Writings through the extensive use of literary dialogues, either poetical, historical, dramatic, lyrical or narrated, sometimes held between human conversationalists, but more often involving Yahweh.2 The relationship is indeed obvious between "dialogue" as a liter- ary device and the interpersonal communications implied by the idea of Revelation, although its precise definition requires a close scrutiny of Bib- lical usage and a critical assessment of literary mediations. While then "dialogue" can readily be connected with Revelation, the same is not true of "monologue." Although a speaking God conveniently portrays the initia- tives of God for the benefit of mankind, what can be the signification of a thinking divinity? If Yahweh talking to Israel is indeed in a position to communicate, does he still communicate when he starts talking to himself ? In the following pages, an attempt will be made at evaluating the revela- tory character of divine monologues, especially as they are found in the prophetic books of the OT. First, I shall discuss briefly the notion of mono- logue or soliloquy in general. Secondly, a number of typical instances of divine monologues will be presented. Thirdly, a theological or existential interpretation of the same will be suggested. I The exegetical productions relative to the monological form in general are scant and unsatisfactory. In 1961, when N. P. Bratsiotis endeavored to relate his own Der Monolog im Alten Testament? to current scientific in- quiries, he could not mention a single book or article devoted to the subject, 1 R. Latourelle, Theology of Revelation (New York, 1966) 38, 324-327, 457-460 (Vatican II). 2 See on this subject, Dialogues bibliques et dialectique interpersonnelle of the present writer, soon to be published by Desclée C° and Bellarmin. 3 Z AW 73 (1961) 30-70. 161</page><page sequence="2">162 The Catholic Biblical Quarterly [Vol. 32 outside of a study on Hosea by his master, B. Bella. He should, of course, have referred to R. A. F. MacKenzie, The Divine Soliloquies in Genesis,4 and possibly to H. W. Wolff's lengthy study on quotations in prophetic books.6 Nonetheless, he did not find anything more than a few lines here and there in commentaries or introductions.6 I am not aware of any sig- nificant contribution having been made since 1961. In this instance, as in so many others, the way O. Eissfeldt treats the monologue is, I believe, typical of the attitude of exegetes in general. According to Eissfeldt, then, the monologue is a pre-literary form, and as such utilized before and outside the biblical texts themselves, either orally or in writing. This means, among other things, that the monologue form is a phenomenon of literature in general, not exclusively a scriptural datum. It is classified by Eissfeldt, together with sermons, valedictory and political addresses, etc., under the heading "speech" ( Rede ).7 What disturbs me in this kind of approach is that it is at best restrictive. Even if one should admit the validity of the classification, he would still have to account for the presence of monologues not only in other prose forms, but in non-prosaic forms as well, say in a lamentation or a drama. But is the classification itself entirely valid ? On what ground does Eissfeldt decide that the mono- logue form is prosaic ? Or, more radically still, is it useful to consider poetry and prose as the supreme literary genres ?8 I do not intend to pursue this line or to come up with a definition of the type : "a form of artistic entertainment by a single speaker."9 Such a prob- lem would require a separate discussion. I shall be satisfied at this point with distinguishing between monologue as a form and as a literary device . Bratsiotis would say, more or less in the same sense: selbstständige and 4 CBQ 17 (1955) 277-286. 5 "Das Zitat im Prophetenspruch" (1937), Gesammelte Studien sum Alten Testa- ment (Theologische Bücherei, 22: Munich, 1964) 36-129. 6 Cf. art. cit., p. 32, notes 11 and 12. - P.

As if the monologue form would be found wherever one does not get an immediate answer to what he has said. - In Histoire et eschatologie (Neuchâtel et Paris, 1959), R. Bultmann calls Augustine's Confessions a monologue (p. 53). But certainly, Augustine talks to Someone, as the constantly recurring "tu," "te," "tuae," "tui" indicate. 7 Cf.

What is a monologue, as a device, or as a stylistic procedure? If the results obtained by Bratsiotis in his important inquiry on the subject were, in the opinion of this writer, valid and certain, he would have dispensed with such a question. But they are not even sure on the essential point of determining the boundaries encompassing the monologue. Bratsiotis ac- knowledges, with common usage, that a monologue means to speak to oneself. He adds however: or to speak to a being that will not answer, because maybe it is absent, or abstract, or lifeless, etc. . . .n I would suggest that in the second case, it would be more appropriate to talk of half- dialogue12 or one way dialogue,13 since the speaker does not address him- self but someone else. To the extent that the speaker directs his words to someone else, he dialogues, but to the extent that his counterpart does not speak in his turn, the dialogue remains incomplete, it goes only half way. Most certainly, it is not a monologue, which, in the humorous words of Balzac, is made of "dialogues des Solitaires avecque l'Echo."14 On the other hand, the expression "to speak to oneself" is somewhat ambiguous. It fails to cover all the relevant cases when, for example, it is taken to mean that the speaker must perforce address himself in the second person and in an allocutive way. One very well might talk to himself in an objective fashion, so to say, without using the pronouns "thou" or "you." The expression shows similarly its inability to regroup the relevant data when it is taken to mean that the speaker addresses himself in absolute privacy or exclusively for himself. There are instances, I believe, when a speaker talks to himself but for a public . The speaker is aware that some- one will overhear the conversation that he is having with himself. To quote Biblical instances of public (or private) monologues at this juncture would not only be cumbersome but also repetitious especially since we will en- counter many of them in the second section. Suffice it for now to mention a distinction which is sometimes made between "monologue" and "solil- oquy," in accordance with what I prefer to call "public and private mono- 10 Art. cit, p. 56. u Ibid., pp. 30, 54. 12 Littré mentions the word "demi-dialogue" in the sense of a letter as part of a correspondence (sub voce "dialogue"). i® There is not even an implied contradiction between "dialogue" and "one way" or "unilateral," since "dia" does not refer etymologically to a duality, but to a process. 14 Quoted by R. Virzel, Der Dialog (Hildesheim, [photographic reproduction of] 1895) II, 265, n.2.</page><page sequence="4">164 The Catholic Biblical Quarterly [Vol. 32 logues."15 "Public" as used here should not be confused with the reader (or listener) to whom even the private monologue is opened. The people ad- dressed in the public monologue are inhabitants of the literary world in which the words are pronounced. Now then, one must ask how faithful and how true to reality is a literary reproduction of the words someone had spoken to himself able to be ? The question is especially meaningful as regards a private monologue which, in principle, cannot be known except by the speaker himself. In this connec- tion, Bratsiotis distinguishes between mediate and immediate monologues, the former being reported by the speaker himself, while the latter is reported by someone else.16 To the immediate type, he naturally grants a greater historical weight. Wolff also deals with the problem. In his view, quotations which can be shown textually either not to have been pro- nounced before their writing, for example, because they are future, or at least not pronounced in the same sense, are fictitious and imaginary.17 I deem it sufficient, considering the stylistic rather than historical approach of the present article, to point to the basically artificial character of the monologue as a literary device. Let us note, first, that language is social.18 R. Virzel is doubtless right when he writes that men have dialogued before monologuing.19 At least this much is certain that articulate language is normally and appositely used for conversation. When left to himself, a man may think and be swayed by emotions, yet he will speak little if at all. Second, the literary use of monologue appears as unrealistic because it portrays somebody alone talking to himself - on the page or on the stage - while on the other hand revealing every word to the reader or listener. Third, the soliloquies are sometimes versified and as a rule elegantly worded. Finally, the historians most often could not possibly have heard or divined what the heroes of their narratives are purported to have said to themselves or pondered in their minds. These remarks show that the monologue is a literary device endowed with a great degree of artificiality, undoubtedly much more than the dialogue.20 16 "Le monologue suppose un auditeur ou un auditoire, tandis que le soliloque consiste à parler (lat. loqui) tout seul (solus)." (P. Foulquié, Dictionnaire de la langue philosophique [Paris, 1963] 174). Bratsiotis shares this view, cf. art . cit., pp. 37-39. 16 Art. cit., pp. 43-44. 17 Art . cit., p. 68. 18 Cf. B. Snell, Der Aufbau der Sprache (Hamburg, 1952) 82. 19 £)er Dialog, I, p. 7. I do not think he is quite right in considering soliloquy as the symptom of a somewhat deranged mind. 20 "The soliloquy in a play is intended to be a direct and sincere expression of the</page><page sequence="5">1970] The Divine Monologue 165 One could be more specific and measure the degree of artificiality obtain- ing in different instances of monologues, through correlating the same with the traditional major divisions of literary forms, namely lyric, drama and narration. Lyrical poetry behaves quite honestly in its use of the mono- logue, since the author is always, although partially, identified with the "I" who speaks and eventually monologues throughout the poem. This iden- tification of the author with his characters is necessarily lessened in a drama, because now many characters express their creator simultaneously and each one, in consequence, inadequately. Narration admits of a still deeper divide between author and characters, a separation which normally prevents the author from possessing any exact and objective knowledge of what his heroes may have said or thought. As the degree of convention and artificiality grows, in the same measure the frequency of the monologue diminishes. The lonely song, to oneself and for oneself, is usual in lyrics, much less frequent is the dramatic aside or monologue, still more unusual is the narrated soliloquy, except evidently in confessions or memoirs which as a rule employ the "I" style and, for that reason, are akin to lyric.21 We must not forget that the three fundamental divisions of literature are Grundformen (E. Staiger), that is moods, perspectives, and manners of expression rather than fixed molds or set structures. These do not live in isolation the one from the others, but on the contrary constantly interact and cooperate with one another. Any lyrical piece, a psalm for instance, shows almost immediately that it borrows many traits from the dramatic or the narrative styles.22 We may anticipate that such will be the situation speaker's real thoughts, with the conventional not true to life, triple assumption that we know ourselves, that we think in grammatically coherent language and that we speak these thoughts aloud" (M. Boulton, The Anatomy of Drama [London, 1960] 81-82). 21 The Commentarti de bello gallico C. Julii Caesaris are a well known exception to this rule, and it is also well known that Caesar's account of his Gallic expeditions are no less biased and subjective for having the appearance of objectivity. 22 Ps 35 can be shown to have the following structure: I-3: half dialogue with Yahweh (petition) 4-8: wish concerning the psalmisťs enemies 9-10 : monologue including a half dialogue with Yahweh (anticipated praise) II-16: monologue (description of trials) 17-18: half dialogue with Yahweh 19-21 : wish concerning the enemies 22-24: half dialogue with Yahweh 25-26: wish concerning the enemies 27-28: final wish including anticipated praise. The regularity of the poem is striking. Pairs of wishes and half dialogues gravitate, so to say, around the central monologue of w. 11-16. These verses, on the other hand,</page><page sequence="6">166 The Catholic Biblical Quarterly [Vol. 32 presented to us by the Divine monologues, since their "I" must be a dramatic "I," even though the prophecies in which it is found are couched in the lyrical style. Many famous dramatic monologues in profane literature really are dialogues, when they are considered as lyrical outpourings of a passionate subjectivity.23 Similarly, the monologues of both Pharisee and Publican ( tauta pros eauton : Lk 18,11), soliloquies though they may be on the narrative level, contain a dialogue with God on the dramatic level.24 Briefly then, to monologue means to speak alone, that is to oneself and for oneself . When someone else is admitted, the monologue becomes public, and to the extent of that admission, closer to the dialogue. The degree of realism or historicity of a monologue is determined by the stylistic level on which it is found. These levels range from the lyrical, to the dramatic or to the narrative. II Bratsiotis is of the opinion that the monologue form is one of the most commonly used by the prophetic authors. What is communicated is not so much Goďs mind as the writers' personal experience.25 In fact, he can find only a few verses of Hosea as instances of divine soliloquies in the prophetic books, namely Hos 6,4-6; 11,8-9; 12,1-2; 9,10-15; 11,1-4. Only the last one would seem to me to deserve such a classification, since in 12,1-2 God does not even speak, and in the three other references he addresses someone in the second person, that is, in the form of a half dia- logue. Apart from Hosea, only Isaiah, Jeremiah, Amos, Micah and Zephaniah add both a dramatic and a narrative touch to the basic lyrical tonality of the whole, inasmuch as they set before Yahweh (cf. v. 17) witnesses standing up and accusing (v. 11), and they likewise report events which no longer exist at the time the lament is performed (w. 13-16). The monologue is evidently public, opened especially to Yahweh, and as such does not cut the communication established by the surrounding dialogue. 2a Thésée for example, in Jean Racine's Phèdre (IV,3) is alone on the stage and consequently soliloquizes at the level of the dramatic action. At the lyrical level however, he addresses Hippolyte who just went out (w. 1157-1164), then "Justes- dieux" (w. 1165-1166). In V, 4, he again shall be alone, but, this time, he will monologue at all levels, wondering what to do, hesitating, and finally deciding to make an inquiry. - It is not always true, even at the dramatic level, that a character soliloquizes when he is left alone on the stage. He may talk to the public (cf. the Annoncier in Le soulier de satin of Paul Claudel). In Phèdre 111,2, it may be that Phèdre really dialogues with Venus, although the goddess is not visible. 24 R. Bultmann confuses the two levels and holds these prayers to be wholesale monologues (cf. Die Geschichte der synoptischen Tradition [Göttingen, 19616] 207) ē 25 Art . cit., p. 36.</page><page sequence="7">1970] The Divine Monologue 167 seem to have presented the Divine Word in the guise of monologues. Ezekiel and Deutero-Isaiah20 were apparently too didactic, while Daniel too objectivistic, to appreciate a device so deeply human, intimate, subjec- tive and concrete. As for the other minor prophets, they have shown a preference for other forms : Habakkuk for prayer, Jonah for irony, etc. . . . Presently, I will be satisfied to identify a few divine monologues, with- out attempting to list them exhaustively. I shall present successively private, public, lyrical, dramatic and narrative monologues articulated by Yahweh. Is 62,1: About Zion I will not be silent, about Jerusalem I will not grow weary, until her integrity shines out like the dawn and her salvation flames like a torch.27 As long as Yahweh had been silent, Zion had lain desolate. But now that God is about to speak, her vindication (41,14; 54,14) is near, as near as full daylight when dawn breaks forth.28 This passage from night to day, from abandonment to salvation, is portrayed with the help of a monologue, a private one most probably, since a half dialogue follows thereupon (w. 2-7) in which Yahweh states what he wants Israel to hear as a result of his decision not to remain silent any longer. But is it Yahweh who speaks in Is 62,1 ? Many commentators think not, among them E. J. Rissane,29 C. Westermann,80 and J. L. McKenzie.81 I would rather believe, with F. Delitzsch32 and E. G. Kraeling,88 that this verse gives the reader a glimpse of what takes place in Yahweh's mind: i) because God speaks again in w. 6 and 8 - and is introduced explicitly in v. 8; ii) in view of the relative separation implied by the way the speaker tells Israel about "your integrity, your glory, your God, your Land . . . " a separation that is more fitting for Yahweh than for his 26 These two great prophets attribute a rather defensive stance to Yahweh. They show him arguing against the Israelites or against foreign divinities (cf. W.

Jer 8,13: I will surely have them harvested;84 says Yahweh. Not a grape on the vine, not a fig on the tree. The leaves all withered, the rivers flowing away from them.85 Jer 8,19c: Why have they provoked me with their idols and futile foreign gods ?86 Jer 8,13-23 appears to be a literary unit. Among other indications, the recurrence of the harvest (w. 13, 20) and healing (w. 15, 22) motives show this. H. Graf Reventlow calls this section a Klageliturgie, except for v. 13 which he strangely cuts off from the following verses.87 This liturgy may have been composed between the two major deportations (598-587), at a time when the harvest was over, the harvest of the first deportation, and yet a harvest that would have to continue (cf. v. 20), although the wounds inflicted on the people seemed incurable already (cf. w. 21-22). Besides Yahweh, the people also soliloquizes in w. 14-16, 18b and 20a. In w. 14-16, the Judeans witness the execution of Goďs decree (v. 13), but they are not led to repent ; they despair fatalistically. Upon seeing this, Yahweh communicates his decision in the form of a decree (a half dia- logue) : "Yes, now I send you serpents . . ." (v. 17). When it is the prophet's turn to speak, he laments aloud, he weeps day and night (v. 23) over the misunderstanding that separates Yahweh and Judah. Here are two old partners who do not know any longer how to talk things over and whose voices return to their origin like an echo in the midst of the prophet's lamentation (cf. vv. 19b-20a). In this poem, the monologue form raises a tripartite wall of separation between an angry God, an unbelieving people, and a dejected prophet. 84 MT has 'ãsõp 'āsīpēm, for which various corrections have been suggested (cf. J. Bright, Jeremiah [The Anchor Bible ; New York, 1965]). It is possible to retain the massoretic punctuation and to derive both forms from the same root: 'sp (Gesenius derives ' āsīpēm from swp ). 'ãsõp would then be the inf. abs. qal and 'āsīpēm the first p. s. future hifil. The inf. abs. qal may accompany any other declention, according to P. Joüon. Grammaire de l'hébreu biblique (Rome, 1923) 353. The only difficulty is that 'sp appears to assume very seldom, if ever, the hifil form. Compare to Ze 1, 2, where 'ãsõp 'āsēp certainly means "to suppress" (cf. hiqrattî, in v. 3) as if through harvesting. 85 I understand 'etēn, usually derived from ntn and translated "I will give," in the sense of "permanent waters," and would further propose to read ' ētānīm , i.e., to transfer the mem final of ya'abrûm to 'etān. 36 W.

The whole land has been devastated and no one takes it to heart. This short poem goes on two more verses (12-13), which however are more appropriately put in the prophet's mouth, even though they sound the same chord as the preceding verses. The Jerusalem Bible indicates by an inverted comma that a speaker is heard in v. 7, but no corresponding comma indicates at what point he ceases to speak. J. Bright puts w. 7-11 between brackets.39 F. Nötscher notes that this section of Jer provides the only instance of a lament being attributed to Yahweh.40 H. Lamparter identifies correctly w. 7-11 as a soliloquy and further comments that it opens Yahweh's heart to the reader. His heart is agitated by grief and anger toward his faithless people.41 Jer 14,10: Here is what Yahweh was saying [to himself] concerning this people: "Yes, they love to wander, their steps never checking.

Others realize that Yahweh speaks not to but about his people (cf. Jerusalem Bible, Chicago Bible, RSV). I submit that Yahweh here is speaking about his people to no one but himself . He can hardly address Israel in the third person the way he does in v. 10, and as for Jeremiah, v. 11 mentions explicitly that Yahweh begins to speak to him only at that point. This verse, according to Graf Reventlow,42 would be part of a Volks - klag elied, extending from 14,1 to 15,9, a communal lamentation composed on the occasion of a national disaster,48 and to which v. 10 would give a divine answer. Although the answer is negative ( wayhwh W rāzām: deklaratorische Urteil) , God's judgment is not without its reason ( Be- gründung ) and it must be proclaimed ( Gerichtsankündigung) .44 Following the lead thus given by Graf Reventlow's analysis, together with MacKenzie's own suggestions about the divine soliloquies of Genesis - to which I will return shortly - we may pause briefly to consider the content of the divine monologues. MacKenzie distinguishes two elements : motivation and proposition, although he splits the first into two parts in connection with Gn 3,22 and ll,6-7.45 In fact, I believe that the analysis of most divine monologues will reveal the presence of one, two or all of the following elements: a) reason, i.e., a fact, a situation that weighs objectively on the decision; b) motive, i.e., a feeling, a disposition that influences the decision in a subjective way; c) decision . In Jer 14,10, we find the three elements in the logical order a-b-c. In Is 62,1, we had c-b, in Jer 8,13, c only, in Jer 8,19c, a only in interrogative form, in Jer 12,7-11, c-b-c in a lament perspective. I propose to analyze the remaining mono- logues in the same way, those at any rate that I shall quote extensively. Ze 3,7ab: I thought: "You will at least fear me, you will learn the lesson,46 and her dwelling won't be destroyed by all the actions I will take against her."47 We are probably presented here with another private monologue of 42 Op . cit., pp. 150, 153. 43 Ibid., pp. 152-153. 44 Ibid., p. 163. 45 Art, cit., pp. 280-281. 46 In v. 7a, the third person would harmonize more easily with v. 7b, and for that reason many emend the text (Ehrlich, J. M. Powis Smith in ICC, K. Elliger in ATD, etc.). But it is not necessary, not even if v. 7ab is regarded as a monologue, although a second poetical level must then be admitted at which Yahweh talks to Jerusalem.

Yahweh's speech had been introduced in 3,1-5 by the description of Jeru- salem's rebelliousness and hardheadedness (w. 1-4), as contrasted with Yahweh's justice (v. 5). Thereupon Yahweh defends his conduct in front of an imaginary tribunal. He explains that he has destroyed other nations in order precisely to teach Jerusalem a lesson. In 3,7ab, Yahweh reveals the reasons underlying his decisions ( a-b ) by quoting what he had had in mind, what he had thought, and what he had said to himself*0 In v. 8, he condemns Jerusalem in a one way dialogue. Public monologues are more frequently assigned to Yahweh than private ones, especially by certain prophets, among whom Isaiah is foremost. Is 6,8: Then I heard the voice of the Lord saying: "Whom will I send ? Who shall be our messenger ?" In 6,5, which incidentally is the first instance of biblical monologues mentioned by Eissfeldt,51 the prophet had been talking to himself.52 He had been wondering about his own inadequacy, and this had not escaped the notice of the seraphs. Now, it is Yahweh's turn to debate within him- self what he should do ( c element in question form), and Isaiah as it were reads Goďs lips, thus conventionally hearing this public monologue. It is indeed possible to interpret the first person plural of v. 8 ( our messenger) as representing a "borrowing from the imagery of a heavenly assembly found in ancient religions, and known especially from Ugaritic litera- ture. . . ."58 In such a case, God would not soliloquize, but address his 48 E. Sellin in Kommentar zum AT, J. M. Powis Smith, K. Elliger, etc. 49 The Jerusalem Bible , RSV, The Chicago Bible, etc. 50 E. Dhorme fails to account for the temporal discontinuity that the monologue introduces in Yahweh's speech. His Bible de la Pleiade brackets only v. 7a and holds this half verse to be addressed directly to Jerusalem (note 7). 51 He further mentions Is 10,7-11; Mi 6,6-7 ( Einleitung in das AT, loc . cit.). 52 This is not usually recognized by the versions. The Jerusalem Bible has: "I said . . The Chicago Translation: "Then said I ..." ; The King James Version has the same; RSV : "And I said . . ."; R. Knox: "Alas, said I . . ; LXX: " kai eipa . . Vulgate "Et dixi . . ."; Dhorme: "Je dis alors . . . ."

I think, however, that an alternative explana- tion is more probable, namely, that the plural - note the parallel first person singular: I send - refers to the duplication of the self that takes place wherever anyone confers with himself. Perhaps the two explanations are not mutually exclusive. Is l,2b-3: I reared sons, I brought them up, but they have rebelled against me. The ox knows its owner and the ass its master's crib ; Israel knows nothing, my people understands nothing.54 There is no mistaking the public character of these lines. The speaker, Yahweh, has been introduced by the prophet to an audience composed of Heaven and Earth (v. 2a). Vv. 2b-3 are in fact part of the rife-pattern.65 However, are we here confronted with an authentic monologue? I suggest that such is the case, at least at a certain level of literary composition. Although, at the dramatic level, Yahweh speaks to Heaven and Earth as to the judges of a cosmic tribunal, at the more basic lyrical level of the prophetic utterance, he can but address himself, since on the one hand Yahweh is the only God and sole Judge of his actions, and on the other hand, in these verses, he does not not care to address Israel, so disillusioned is he, so scandalized, by her gross ingratitude. The whole monologue seems to contain a developed a element. Is 3,4 : I give them boys for princes, raw lads to rule over them. This time, we find only the c element. Some would attribute v. 4 to the prophet,56 but the "I" that breaks in abruptly at this point is surely the divine Ego, as H. Wildberger57 and V. Herntrich58 have pointed out. This divine declaration discloses in a dramatic fashion the theological dimension of history. The social disorders that Is 3,1-15 foretells stem ultimately from God. In particular, the tyranny exerted by irresponsible lads will be a mis- begotten and contradictory realization of the messianic prophecies (cf. Is 9,5-6). 59 54 Translation of The Jerusalem Bible, as was also the case with Jer 12,7-11, and will be for Is 3,4. 55 Cf. J.

These verses relate Yahweh's decision and the punishment of Babylon described in the entire ch. 13, in terms often reminiscent of the "holy war" vocabulary and dramatically connected with the Day of Yahweh (v. 6). Since this chapter has to do with Babylon, it is most likely postexilic.61 As for the public character of the monologues, I infer as much from the exemplary and almost didactic nature of Babylon's fate as described in ch. 13. Yahweh' s role in the event is there for everybody to see. Is 29,13-14: For the Lord has said: "Because this people approaches me only in words, honors me only with lip-service while his heart is far from me, and my religion, as far as it is concerned, is nothing but a human commandment, a lesson memorized, 14 very well, I shall have to go on being prodigal of prodigious prodigies with this people. The wisdom of its sages shall decay, the intelligence of its intelligent men shall be shrouded . . ." 22 Yahweh indeed has said, the God of the House of Jacob, Abraham's redeemer: "No longer shall Jacob be ashamed, no more shall his face grow pale, 23 For he shall see what my hands have done in his midst, he shall hold my name holy."62 Ch. 29's structure is uncertain.

Alonso Schökel, ought to be displaced.64 We would be left then with two units, namely w. 9-14 and w. 17-24, equivalent in length, each terminating in a divine speech. In the first poem, Isaiah reproaches the Judeans for their spiritual blindness (w. 9-12) and assigns to Yahweh himself the task of telling them in a public monologue that they have only themselves to blame for it (w. 13-14). In the second poem, the prophet anticipates a miraculous restoration, hearing for the deaf, light for the blind (w. 17-22), in explanation of which he again introduces Yahweh monologuing in favor of the House of Jacob (w. 22-23a). Note in these two soliloquies the ethical coloring explicitly attributed to Yahweh ( yďan , lākēn of w. 13-14) ; Yahweh does not act without pondering his decisions. Vv. 13-14 seem to contain the a element together with c, w. 22-23, b and c (in narrative form). Is 61,8-9: For I, Yahweh, love justice I hate iniquitous robberies.65 I will reward them faithfully and make an everlasting covenant with them. 9 Their race will be famous among the nations, their descendants amidst the peoples. All who see them will regard them as a race whom Yahweh has blessed. These two verses are part of a poem that extends from v. 1 to v. 11. The poem treats of the mission given by Yahweh to his servant, the prophet. The mission is directed to Israel as his mediator vis-à-vis the nations. "The words of Yahweh describe this as the reward for Israel's suffering."68 They use for that purpose the elements b-c, and their public character is evidenced by the fact that Zion exults in w. 10-11 after she has taken cognizance of them. Is 66,2-4: But upon this one will I look, on the lowly and the broken of spirit, on the one who trembles at my word. 3 He who slaughters an ox - he kills a man, he who sacrifices a lamb - he strangles a dog, 63 From 29,9 on, Ariel is not mentioned, and The Jerusalem Bible notes (f) that w. 9-10 are addressed to the incredulous Judeans, even though it includes them in the oracle on Ariel. 64 Cf.

Since they elect to follow their own ways and their souls delight in their abominations, 4 I in my turn will select hardships for them and bring them what they dread ; for I called and no one would listen. They did what I consider evil, they chose to do what displeases me.68 The present soliloquy offers a very important insight into the prophetic idea of Yahweh's motives in reaching his decisions. Yahweh prefers justice to sacrifices (cf. Am 5,21-27; Hos 6,6; Jer 7,21-23; Is 1,12-17). He looks (element b ) upon the humble and obedient, not upon the ritual practice (element a). If then Israel chooses ( gam hēmāh, bãhar) to follow her own ways (element a), Yahweh in his turn will choose (gam 'ant, bãhar) to bring hardships upon her (element c). From a thematic point of view, it is worthy of note that Is 66,2-4, of all the OT poems, is apparently the most critical of and hostile to the cult. C. Westermann waters down its polemical thrust,69 but J. L. McKenzie and G. Fohrer preserve it in all its harsh- ness.70 In order not to prolong unduly the present inquiry, I will present briefly the monologues yet to be mentioned. In Jer 12,14-17, Yahweh decides in his mind how he will treat the "wicked neighbors" of Judah. Without condoning their crimes, he nonetheless proposes to have compassion on them and to restore them, to provide them, so to say, with a particular exodus. Mi 1,6-7 shows Yahweh in the act of pronouncing the condemnation of Samaria in front of a cosmic and universal tribunal (v. 2, cf. Is l,2b-3). Finally, I would suggest that Am 1,3-2,9 can conveniently be understood as a long public monologue, preparatory to the exhortation that from 2,10 on, Amos directs to the Northern Kingdom in the half dialogue form. However complex the literary evolution of ch. 1 and 2 may have been,71 especially 2,6-16, the sudden apparition in v. 10 of the allocutive speech, between the protasis of v. 6 and the apodosis of v. 13, still a way of speech that is going to be retained in the remaining part of the book, must be given 67 I derive dam from dmm II (cf.

Between v. 9 and v. 10, monologue is replaced by dialogue, the process of decision by the process of conversion. We have attempted heretofore to exemplify the divine monologues private and public. In so doing, we could not help considering, at least obliquely, the basic literary styles in which they are used. Actually, the cases studied belonged to the lyrical Grundform, which was complemented by the dramatic form inasmuch as Yahweh was made to think aloud or to speak. This was further complemented by the narrative Grundform when he was introduced by another voice (vg. Jer 8,13; 14,10; Ze 3,7ab (Yahweh introduces himself); Is 6,8; l,2b-3; 29,13-14; 29,22-23a; Jer 12,14-17; Mi 1,6-7). Presently, I shall add a few more instances of divine monologue from the prophetic books and also from non-prophetic, even non-biblical, sources. Jer 48 is a collection of oracles against Moab. Its unity is, consequently, more thematic than stylistic. Dominating and, so to speak, directing the many voices that are heard throughout the long drawn out poem, Yahweh expresses his views and feelings about Moab, one time in a one way dialogue (w. 43-44), and four times in monologue form (vv. 30, 35, 38b, 47) .72 While Jer 48 has offered us an instance of lyrical context in the sense that w. 30, 35, 38b, 47 are all introduced as Yahweh's own words, as his literary creation, Jer 46,5-6 can exemplify some sort of dramatic context if we are justified in interpreting these verses as an interior monologue of Yahweh. I believe this to be so, to the extent at least that the defeat of the Egyptian army is described in these verses not objectively, but through Yahweh's eyes and reaction: "What do I see? They are panic stricken . . (v. 5). 73 As to the narrative style, the best examples are found in the first half of Genesis, more precisely in its Yahwistic strand. ". . . in the use of [the divine soliloquy] he [the Yahwist] stands practically alone among the 72 H. Lamparter, F. Nötscher and J. Bright agree that the vv. 30, 35, 38b (Bright: 38) and 47 are spoken by Yahweh. 73 Among the profane writers, J. Joyce in particular has made extensive use of the "interior monologue." In Is 53, "Goyyim-rabbim" and their kings seem to be attributed by the poet an interior monologue. Rather the flow of their consciousness passes by the reader, not properly language, since surprise and astonishment have shut their mouth (52,15a). Thus Ebed's passion and ultimate triumph are described through the subjective apprehension of "Goyyim-rabbim," colored by what they see and understand (52,15b). All of which is very proper, in view of the fact that Ebed bears "our sufferings" (53,4) and "offers his life in atonement" (53,10). - Compare to E. Auerbach, Mimesis (Bern, 1949) 33-34.</page><page sequence="17">1970] The Divine Monologue 177 historical writers of the OT." So says R. A. F. MacKenzie,74 who goes on to enumerate the instances: Gn 2,18; 3,22; 6,3,7; 8,21; 11,6-7; 18,20-21. I would, for my part, replace 18,20-21, which is not a monologue but a disclosure to Abraham in dialogue form, by 18,17-19 immediately preced- ing, which is indeed a soliloquy. Gn 1,26 (P) ought also to be mentioned. I noted earlier that MacKenzie analyzes the divine monologues of Genesis from the point of view of their content. If we would apply to them the categories introduced above, we would obtain the following result: Gn 2,18 (b-c); 3,22(0-6); 6,3 (b-a-c) ; 6,7(c-b); 8,21 (6-a-c) ; 1 1,6-7 (a-b-c ) ; 18, '7-'9(c-a-b). Before we bring the present consideration to an end, two complementary points remain to be made. The first is relative to human monologues in the OT, the second to divine monologues in ancient Near Eastern literature. I do not intend to study the human monologue of the OT for its own sake,75 but merely to throw a sidelight on the divine soliloquies. H. W. Wolff has noted, in the article to which I have referred previously, that the prophetic writings put the Word of God in contradistinction to the words of the men they quote. Accordingly, he adds, Yahweh's Word and human quotations build together the unique Word of God proclaimed dialectically.76 This observation applies perfectly in the case of human monologues. I have asserted above that Deutero-Isaiah had little use for divine soliloquies. Even in places where he succeeds in attributing to Yahweh a rather subjective demeanor, viz., 42,14-16, the divine speech is endowed with such external efficiency, such materiality (cf. 42,13.17) that it seems impossible to classify it as a monologue. The same divine speeches, on the other hand, clearly portray in the theological space which they generate, individual human beings thoroughly incapable of hiding anything from their Creator, devoid of any secret and identified with their soliloquies. Cyrus is an example in 48,16c, or Ebed in 49,4a or Zion in 49,14.21. In Deuteronomy, it is worthy of note that Yahweh always speaks in dialogue form, while Israel regularly uses the monologue. For example : "You may say in your heart : 'These nations outnumber me . . / " (7,17; cf. 8,17; 9,4; 12,20.30; 15,9; 17,14; 18,21; 28,67). See also Is 33,14; 10,8-14; 14,13-14. As far as I could ascertain, the NT does not seem to attribute any 74 Art. cit., p. 278. 75 It is mostly with them that Bratsiotis is occupied in his article of Z AW. 76 "Im Prophetenspruch steht das Wort Jahwes und das Wort des Menschen [quoted] gegeneinander ...

( Das Zitat, p. 100).</page><page sequence="18">178 The Catholic Biblical Quarterly [Vol. 32 monologues to Jesus.77 The ancient Near Eastern mythologies, however, did put some in the mouths of their divine actors. Baal's jubilant exclama- tion on contemplating the palace built for him by Kothar : "My house have I builded of silver; My palace, indeed, of gold,"78 is a case of lyrical monologue. Here is a soliloquy virtually public that depicts a radiant god surrounded by his pantheon at the glorious instant he is going to hold a banquet in his new palace. This intimate exultation becomes fully public when, a few verses later, Baal sends the same lines to Mot, his enemy. The two monologues of Baal and Mot in the same poem dramatize their contradictory ambitions. Baal sits in his palace, swinging the yew-club in his right hand: "Tribute I'll send not to Divine Mot . . . he says.79 Meanwhile, Mot "calls out in his soul and thinks in his heart: T alone will have sway o'er the gods. . . "80 Dramatic also, and ostentatious, is benign El's reaction, when Baal's death is announced to him. He descends from his throne, pours dust of mourning on his head, gashes his face, and, when he has sufficiently attracted everybody's attention, shouts: "Baal's dead ! - What becomes of the people ? Dagon's Son ! - What of the masses ? After Baal I'll descend into earth."81 Other soliloquies are narrative, also, for example, the long allocutive monologue of Yassib in Keret,82 thanks to which the reader learns that Yassib has been lead by some interior impulse (ambition?) into trying to dethrone his father. If Ereshkigal did not bare her true feelings in a monologue, the order she gives to the doorkeeper in w. 37-38 would be ambiguous. As it is, there is no doubt about her offensive intentions con- 77 The actors of the parables frequently soliloquize: the landowner and the wicked husbandmen (Mt 21,37-39), the rich epicurean (Lk 12,17-19), the prodigal son (Lk 15,17-19), etc. Historical characters also make use of monologue occasionally: Elizabeth (Lk 1,25) ; especially when Jesus reads their hearts: the Scribes (Mk 2,7), the Pharisees (Mt 12,24, cf. Lk 5,21), etc. Why not Jesus? - The Evangelists' restraint has not been always imitated by further generations of Christians. The liturgy of The Holy Family (first Sunday after the Epiphany in the Roman Catholic Calendar) has Jesus the Worker monologuing: Irriget sudor mea membra, dixit, Antequam sparso madeant cruore Haec quoque humano generi expiando Poena luatur. 7® Cf.

Many others could be added, especially if human mono- logues were included. m Our survey of the divine monologues in the prophetic books would remain incomplete, if we did not attempt to assess this literary phenomenon as it bears on Revelation. An exhaustive evaluation would call for a detailed interpretation of individual verses. Such an approach belongs in a commentary and, as a matter of fact, would hardly suit the purpose of this paper, which is concerned with the divine monologue as a literary device. It is certainly insufficient to state that Yahweh speaks to himself merely when and because he is alone.85 Or to argue that Yahweh soliloquizes when he deals with his close friends86 - this is not always so. Or to observe the recurrence of the same motives in the content of the monologues.87 Or finally to suggest that the monologue operates more intellectually, while the dialogue, more affectively.88 What we need to discover is the mental attitude, the Weltanschauung, the vision portrayed by the prophets in their use of divine monologues. What appears to me then, firstly, is that monologue as used to portray a revealing God, is not only unobjectionable and appropriate, but brings with itself the assurance that the divine disclosure is authentic, unadulter- ated and truthful. The divine monologues lead us directly into Yahweh's mind ; they open to the reader the secret source of Goďs choices in a way 83 "Va, portiere, aprile la tua porta, trattala secondo gli ordinamenti antichi!," which is enigmatic. But Ereshkigal had said to herself moments before: "Questa [Ishtar] (che cosa vuole) ? Io voglio (continuare a) bere l'acqua cogli Annunaki . . ." (Transi. G. Furlani, Miti babilonesi e assiri [Firenze, 1958] 300) ś, compare to ANET , p. 107. 84 Cf. Furlani, op . cit., p. 223. 86 H. Gunkel gives that lame explanation in connection with the divine monologues in Genesis, cf. Genesis ( Handkommentar zum AT : Göttingen, 19646) I, XLIII. 86 Bratsiotis holds this opinion and substantiates it with the cases of Abraham and Hosea, cf. art cit., p. 58. 87 R. A. F. MacKenzie follows this tack in the CBQ article often referred to. 88 "Mit dem Ich redet der Verstand, mit dem Du Herz und Empfindung." Saying reproduced by R. Virzel, Der Dialog II, p. 268, who, as far as he is concerned, does not care to separate monologue and dialogue along these lines (cf. ibid., p. 376).</page><page sequence="20">180 The Catholic Biblical Quarterly [Vol. 32 that must be termed infallible. This indeed is the value conventionally ascribed to the monologue: it imprints on a speech the mark of utmost sincerity and of absolute truthfulness. The speaker who soliloquizes talks to himself and consequently does not try to fool anyone ; he may, of course, deceive himself, but this possibility does not seem to be taken into consider- ation by the Bible in dealing with God. Moreover, what the speaker says will always express faithfully what he thinks, since he is supposed to "think" the very words of the text. In this way, the divine monologues provide for Revelation a basis of unsurpassable surety. Secondly, the divine monologues are especially adept at conveying the immanent side of God. This kind of speech, so characteristic of man, so anthropomorphic when applied to Yah weh, simulates God to man and presents Him as a person. Notwithstanding E. Auerbachs opinion on the subject,89 this mode of speech must be said to reveal Yahweh's intimate motives, his plans, his intentions, even his doubts. We could in fact analyze the content of divine monologues through the use of categories essentially relative to decision and choice, namely reason (a), motive (fc), decision (O. Thirdly, that soliloquies isolate and separate is also true. O. Ludwig has stressed this point in connection with Shakespeare's monologues.90 In the case of God, separation means transcendence . There are times when he is fed up with mankind. He then stops talking to men, retires into Himself and reflects. That men of Israel penetrate into God's privacy through the mediation of prophets does not do them any good, since they read only their condemnation written in his decision. Fourthly and finally, not authenticity, nor immanence, nor transcendence can be understood as being directly revealed to human hearers or readers by the divine monologues. The said monologues remain a literary device, and as such conventional and dependent on a human author, the prophet. Divine monologues only pretend to give us an immediate look into Yahweh's mind. In fact, they entail essentially the prophetic mediation . As narrative, they may refer to his interpretation of history. As dramatic, they may stem from his experience of the constant conflicts arising between Yahweh and Israel. As lyrical, they may evoke his personal and mystical communion with God, his "theopathy," as A. Heshel would put it. By contrast with Yahweh's monologues, the absence of any such speech 89 "Gott gibt seinen Befehl in direkter Rede, doch er verschweigt sein Motiv und sein Absicht . . ( Mimesis , p. 16). 90 "Alle grosse Leidenschaft isolirt. Sie sucht die Einsamkeit, mit sich zu berathen, sich schlecht zu machen, sich zu trösten, sich auszutoben."

Regarding the mythological monologues, it is noticeable that they do not relate God and man, but rather gods among themselves, and the motives which seem to weigh on their decisions are a far cry from the deliberate lākēn and ya'an of the biblical tradition.91 Summing up, this beautiful instance of a style, at once humble and exalted,92 which the divine monologues have presented to us, must be interpreted as referring to a God who is close at hand and yet distant, present and yet absent, so close that one can read infallibly in his mind, and yet so different from men that he is constantly opposed by them; a divinity whose loving intentions are made manifest as well as his punitive decisions; in short, a God who expresses his own Word in prophetic language. Roger Lapointe, O.M.I. Université Saint-Paul Ottawa 01 The gods of Enuma Elish for instance are submitted to change, but they do not enjoy any historical existence. They are caricatures, hardened once and for all in a given posture: Tiamat, in the will to kill the other divinities, Qingu, in a domineering ambition, Ea, in prudence and cleverness, Marduk, in an aristocratic invincibility, etc. However hard they try to look free in pondering their decisions, the reader knows before hand what they will decide eventually. 92 The mixture of humble and elevated styles, is typical of biblical and christian traditions, according to Auerbach. Classical authors feel obliged to conform in each case, either to the one or to the other style. Cf. Mimesis , p. 91, and passim.</page></plain_text>
