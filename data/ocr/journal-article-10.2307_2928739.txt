<plain_text><page sequence="1">JAMES ELKINS On Visual Desperation and the Bodies of Protozoa CONSIDER THE SCYTHIAN LAMB or borometz, a creature that lived on a stalk (fig. 1). As it grew, its trunk stretched, and soon it could only look down on the grass that once nourished it. Eventually it starved and died, and its body became a husk.' As Claude Duret shows it, the borometz is eating the top few inches of meadow grass, and its coat is already going to seed. It is a sad creature, something of a melancholy hunger artist among the vigorous fanciful monsters of the medieval bestiaries. Yet it is easy to understand, because it is constructed by analogy: its stalk is like a tree trunk, and in that sense it is a plant; but the stalk is also like an umbilical cord, and in that sense it is an animal. A young borometz is a lamb, tethered to the ground. It becomes more plantlike when its desiccated organs, muscles, and wool become a vegetable matrix for borometz seeds. Hence it is both plant and animal, though it is never entirely one or the other. As A. 0. Lovejoy has pointed out, in the Middle Ages creatures conformed to a "chain of being" that was imagined as a succession of species, each in analogy to the ones before and after it. From God Himself to the lowliest worm, creatures paraded in sturdy succession.2 The great chain of being is not a rope, with fibers inextricably entwined, but a chain, with clearly articulated links. Both real and invented creatures had to obey these laws of fixed difference. The gryllus was the operative principle of monstrous construction: monsters were formed by con- joining nameable parts taken from nameable creatures. Thus a centaur is a man and a horse, a borometz is a tree and a lamb, and a heraldic wyvern is a two- legged dragon, derived from four-legged dragons, which are in turn derived from lizards, snakes, and bats. Grylli are always formed by this ars combinatoria of parts.3 The borometz is predicated upon clear, illogical comparisons between lamb and seed pod, trunk and umbilicus, animal and plant. It is my contention here that analogic reasoning is what allows us to perceive the borometz at all: to see that it is one creature, that it has a mode of life, that it is, in the most fundamental sense, a body. Lovejoy's history can be reread as a handbook for the conditions of the possibility of seeing bodies at all, since it is an extended study of the ways that linguistic construction made creatures compre- hensible.4 Analogic thought is resilient and resourceful, and as long as it can unearth a term for comparison we can perceive a body in comprehensible con- trast to our own. Analogies allow us to see bodies where we might see meaningless REPRESENTATIONS 40 * Fall 1992 ? THE REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA 33</page><page sequence="2">FIGURE 1.

The analogic principle holds good for most bodies in pictures, mythologies, bestiaries, and dreams; for the classical gryllus or monstrum; and even for the most shocking teratology. Yet there are also the rare cases in which our capacity to complete the analogy fails, and we cease to comprehend what we have seen, or cease to see bodies at all. This has happened most recently in the case of the Burgess shale, the Cam- brian strata in British Columbia that yielded creatures so bizarre that they were at first mis-seen and classified as members of familiar phyla. Only in recent decades have we been able to comprehend that some have gelatinous blobs in place of heads, hollow mouthlike tails, spikes for legs, or feeding tubes that deposit nutrients in hoppers arrayed along the back. One such creature is named Hallucigenia in honor of its capacity to disrupt expectations.6 But the most radical challenge to our capacities to analogize, and to the dependent ability to compre- hend e eene de ae the resence of bodies, came in the Enlightenment. That was the time of the great microscopical discoveries, when creatures were found that did not seem to be constructed by analogy with other creatures at all. Their appearance engen- 34 REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="3">dered a phenomenon I will be calling "visual desperation" as the microscopists struggled to find suitable analogies that would allow them to make sense of what they were seeing. Visual desperation is not a common problem, and when it occurs it reveals how widely and naturally we rely on analogic thinking. I take it that our ability to understand the bodies we encounter, whether they are humans, grylli, or borometzes, depends on finding workable analogies. "Visual despera- tion" is a name for a peculiarly strained and anxious seeing that casts about, trying to construct analogies and retrieve an unknown form into the fold of vision. When it succeeds, we complacently classify the bodies as humans, other animals, plants, and fabulous beasts of various sorts. When it fails, we become blind; we see only chaos or trackless monstrosity. Enlightenment Microscopy as Conceptual Anarchy The history of magnification-and especially its exemplary moment, the invention and elaboration of the idea of "protozoa"-recapitulates many ideas that preoccupied the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries in other spheres. To some early microscopists, the microscope was an instrument of entertainment: its slides were magic lantern transparencies, and its brilliant "stages" boasted the most wondrous actors. Microscopic life was nothing short of "microscopic theater," a "spectacle tres rejouissant," in which condensed lights revealed aston- ishing underwater comedy.7 The hieroglyphic acrobatics and "joyous leaps, frisky contortions, and vaults" of "the harlequin, or insect [found in] muddy water," reminded one amateur scientist of lusty springing in the commedia dell' arte (fig. 2).8 Barbara Stafford's Body Criticism looks at the history of Enlightenment micros- copy from this vantage, bringing out its connections with theatrical ruse, decep- tion, phantasm, confusion, and "visual quackery."9 The microscopic spettacoli were also implicated in the Enlightenment search for origins, both spatial (in Louis Pasteur's and Lazzaro Spallanzani's experi- ments, which attempted to isolate the living from the sterile)'0 and temporal (in the question of the "potential immortality of the protozoa" popularized by Samuel Taylor Coleridge and "proved" in the 1920s);" the entire problematic of the primitive and its nature (and here we recall that one of the myriad names the protozoa went under was Urtierchen); the disruption of classical beauty, propriety, and decorum (here Anton van Leeuwenhoek's early observation of frog feces "swarming with little animals" is exemplary); and the insoluble obstacles the new creatures presented to moral, sexual, physiological, and morphological classifi- cation.'2 Puzzlement about taxonomy is reflected in their many names: astonished discoverers called them invisibles, animalcules, dierken (little animals), fish (a French On Visual Desperation and the Bodies of Protozoa 35</page><page sequence="4">41 1 , " '- ".. ..',. .

The interest in "pongoes" (immature orangutans) and calmucks (legendary inhabitants of North and Central Asia) are signs of the concern about the dividing line between human and animal.'4 Medieval grylli like the borometz, with its tame collage of animal and plant parts, could no longer staunch the flood of transgres- sions. Eighteenth-century microscopical investigations showed how hopeless it is to place the line between animal and human, by doubting a far more basic, and equally hopeless, proposition: to distinguish between animal and plant. A group of free-swimming creatures, the phytoflagellates, have chloroplasts like green plants but swim like animals. Sometimes they appear as primitive "trees," coalesced from creatures that had been freely swimming moments before.'5 Some creatures change from animal-like motile forms to sessile plantlike forms in a single generation; rapid swimmers can become "seeds" (cysts) that "germinate" when conditions are improved; and many display a range of sexual and asexual forms of reproduction. As the nineteenth century recognized, the origins of both animality and sexuality are microscopic. 36 REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="5">The early writers were faced with an array of questions that strained the limits of analogic thought. Do protozoa have "bodies" without limbs or organs? Are they trunks or fragments? Can an arm or a finger be alive, function as a body? Can a "body" lie open and transparent to investigation? Isn't a "body" properly some- thing with opaque skin dividing its inside from the outside? Is a "body" something that can be continuous with other bodies or with the outside world? A body-at least a human body-is potentially beautiful, and its skin can be ideally smooth, "like ivory" in the classical trope. Microscopy also challenged that, because it made humans disgusting. William Cowper's Anatomia corporum humanorum includes a minute, fascinating, and nauseating examination of skin pores.'6 The microscopic eye surfaces again in Jonathan Swift's repulsive, misogynist itinerary of oils, flakes, "Pomatum, Paints, and Slops" in "The Lady's Dressing Room." The hero, sneaking into his Lady Celia's boudoir, finds towels "Begumm'd, bematter'd, and beslim'd / With Dirt, and Sweat, and Ear-Wax grim'd," and he inspects her mag- nifying glass, "that can to sight disclose, / The smallest Worm in Celia's Nose." Low-level magnification (which suited the blurry optics of the early microscopes) maximized the alien monstrosity of everything human, and by extension that of everything which lies just below our notice.

Tinier animalcules were considered less "malformed" in part because they lacked observable form altogether. Some books inventory repellent creatures, each with a minuscule smudge to show its life-size appearance (fig. 3).17 Microscopy showed horrors far worse than the monstrous births, distorted animals, and Hyperbo- reans of ancient and Renaissance lore, and forced questions on the nature of monstrosity. Can the nine orifices of medieval medicine be multiplied indefi- nitely? Can a body include fifty stomachs migrating freely in a milky interior? Can it be only mouth and stomach, with no tissues to nourish? Can urine and phlegm float around a body together with brains and stomach, and then pierce a make- shift anus and escape? Can a hundred eggs live together with a heart in a trans- parent body, itself "living" inside a coffee louse?'8 Protoplasm is a strange word. Is it a substitute for brain or soul? Is it a kind of "sensitive" tissue, something that corresponds to our own "irritable" nerves?19 When is an arm a paddle or a fin?20 Does a ciliated protozoan have a thousand tiny arms, or are they mechanical help- mates like oars? And what does it mean to say a body has oars? Can a body be 38 REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="7">parasitized by homuncular slaves, each pulling at a built-in prosthetic paddle? The amoeba, called "little" or "blind Proteus" and "animalculum singularis- simum,"2 spills its "arms" into its "legs" continuously, churns its "stomachs" into "bladders," and moves its anus to any spot on its "body."22 The observers were dumbfounded. A.J. R6sel von Rosenhof, the amoeba's discoverer, waited patiently for "a head, feet, or even a tail."23 At times he was sure he saw turtle- forms, antlers, or at least flippers (fig. 4). John Turberville Needham watched a "Proteus" decapitate itself and then put forth a "wheel-like Piece of Machinery."24 As we look through this strange history, we will encounter two related strat- egies for retrieving visually intractable forms. Analogy was a shaky epistemolog- ical tool because it rarely provided satisfying explanations and because it risked seeming inappropriate or fanciful. Especially preposterous analogies tended to collapse, so that they were not so much permanent insights as heuristic devices that were in a sense constructed in order to be discarded. If an odd body is seen indistinctly, at a distance, or in a memory, we might say it looks like another thing, even if we do not really believe what we are saying-for example, that it is a human who looks like a table. In saying that we do not mean that the form is actually an impossible hybrid; instead the statement allows us to keep looking, to keep seeing something while we think. The propaedeutic function of analogies will be evident here, as will the more considered and permanent attempts to rewrite the unruly protozoa as true analogues of other forms. The second strategy avoids known analogies in favor of neologisms: instead of saying the apparition is a human who looks like a table, we might choose to see it as an integrated form, and coin a term for it-say, a tabular human. The newly named creature defeats further analysis: it is simply an enigma, something new with a new name, a sphinx. Neologism, I will argue, is the principal strategy that modern science uses to paper over problems that analogies continue to provoke; but I want to begin by considering an earlier episode in the history of microscopy, in which both far-fetched analogy and taxonomic neologism served as ways to talk about bodies that seemed utterly unacceptable. Pushing Sperm off the Edge of the World Sperm are still called spermatozoa, literally "sperm animals." The first people to see spermatozoa recognized them as living creatures, but they balked at the thought that human bodies might be in perverse commensal partnership with mindless vermin. Calling them by the more obvious analogic names-tad- poles, worms, snakes, and so forth-was often not enough, since it was difficult to accept that the male body might harbor, and possibly even depend on, such ani- mals. The simplest and most radical solution to this dilemma was to deny that On Visual Desperation and the Bodies of Protozoa 39</page><page sequence="8">spermatozoans were analogous to bodies at all. In a letter of 31 May 1678, Leeu- wenhoek again raises the question of the differences between these "dierken" in dogs and other animals, but most of his attention is consumed in an effort to record the "vessels" (vaten) he had first seen in the seminal fluid a year before (fig. 5). His ephemeral vaten have never been explained, and they have vanished from the literature.25 Leeuwenhoek protests that he is "not an expert" at drawing, and he drew relatively little in comparison with Christian Huyghens or Robert Hooke (his first descriptions of protozoa are not illustrated), but he tries hard to show the ways the vaten lie in obscure tangles. The letters D-D-D-D at the bottom of figure 5 represent a dense interweaving that "the eye cannot follow." Four such drawings survive, looking like nothing so much as student exercises or doodles; the sperm themselves, which could have been shown swimming in this labyrinth, are absent-they appear in other plates, lined up with specimens from other spe- cies. To Leeuwenhoek the dierken in seminal fluid were "nothing but the vehicle [voerwage] of a certain extremely volatile animal spirit [seer vollatile animale geest], impressing on the conception, i.e., the ovum of the woman, the perception of life [het levende gevoelen]." The vaten, on the other hand, are nothing so immaterial: they are "nerves, arteries, and veins," and indeed every organ of the body is nascent in the seminal fluid ("Once I fancied I saw a certain form ... which I fancied I could compare with some inward part of the body")26 In this way the body remains intact across generations; the father bequeaths the components of his body in dissected form (hence the interest in how the fibers of the vaten are related), together with the principle of motion, the "volatile spirit" embodied by FIGURE 5.

But in this disembodied transmission of body from one generation to the next, the missing part is the spermatozoan itself; nothing in the vaten corre- sponds to disembodied sperm. The spermatozoa become incomprehensible as bodies, since they themselves would require their own vaten to ferry them from one generation to the next. Later observers failed to find Leeuwenhoek's vaten, and without them it became more difficult to account for spermatozoa without having recourse to slimy animal metaphors. Whether or not the embryo is contained in the sperm- and it is far from clear that Leeuwenhoek thought so-the question of the trans- mission of the body remained vexing. We can pass over the hallucinations and misguided illusions of Nicolaas Hartsoeker, who saw the head of the sperm as a womb (such solutions were too literal to be widely believed), but like Leeuwen- hoek's interest in the vaten, many early theories were bound up with the demotion of spermatozoa to accidental or mechanical intrusions?27 Turberville Needham's New Microscopical Discoveries (1745) offers a description of the "milt vessels of the calamary" in entirely mechanical terms (fig. 6): they consist of an "outward transparent case," "round head," "screw," "sucker," and a "spongy substance" On Visual Desperation and the Bodies of Protozoa 41</page><page sequence="10">containing the calamary's semen. The mechanisms undergo a complicated mechanical involution to release the fluid, and Needham wonders if Leeuwen- hoek's "supposed Animalcules" might not be "nothing more than immensely less Machines analogous to these Milt-vessels."28 Needham's solution is, of course, incomplete, since these calamary sperm cases would presumably release tiny sperm, which would themselves have to be mechanical in order to preserve the separation of "sperm" and "body." There would be no living bodied sperms at all, just machines housing machines without end. The fact that Needham did not see this infinite regression might be read as willful ignorance. The Panspermist move- ment (whose proponents held that every substance contains a "seminal nature" or "seeds" ready to sprout) cannot be understood apart from this anxiety about the status of spermatozoans. Three years later Needham wrote "A Summary of Some Late Observations on the Generation, Composition, and Decomposition of Animal and Vegetable Substances," in which he denies that the spermatozoans are bodies composed of "head" and "tail": These Tails were so far from being Members given them to swim and steer by, that they evidently caus'd in them an unstable oscillatory motion; and were in effect nothing more than long filaments of the viscid seminal substance which they necessarily trailed after them.9 P. L. S. Muller's expanded edition of Linnaeus (1773-75) recounts one of Need- ham's experiments showing a root fibril with its characteristic "horns" (Kolben) that generate animalcules.30 "Horns" and "heads" were more acceptable as sperma- tozoa, in particular when they could be assigned to miscellaneous "Animal and Vegetable Substances" instead of the insides of our own inviolate bodies. These accounts show the strain of invention, and there is something of Rube Goldberg in the overcomplicated vaten and iterated pneumatics of the calamary milt-vessels; but at least vaten, machines, and inanimate parts were more accept- able as partners in male bodies than wormy tadpoles. If we choose to read this from a Freudian point of view, we might say that male scientists took offense at being violated or polluted in an "unmasculine" fashion, and certainly the out- landish constructions and theories are in line with the urgency of that desire for inviolate purity. In a sense, these explanations are all neologisms, since they had to be elaborately shored up in order to fend off the immediate apparition of swimming worms. When all else failed, the spermatozoa themselves could be herded into the corral of scientific neologism, a strategy that we will see again at the close of the paper. One of the most striking of these denials occurs in an early edition of Carolus Linnaeus's Systema naturae itself.31 There, in order to find the spermato- zoans, we must turn to the last of the six classes of Animals, the class of Worms (Vermes), and to its final genus, provocatively titled Chaos. There, among the lowest, unclassifiable members of animalia, is the amoeba Proteus and the even 42 REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="11">stranger slime molds, called Chaos fungorumfeminum and imagined as transsexual animal spores that turned vegetable and produced mushrooms (this species is credited to the comically unbelievable name of Baron Miinchhausen). At the end of the short list of the members of Chaos is a miscellaneous category, the obscurae, a darkness within a chaos, under which we read the one-line entry: d. Spermatici vermiculi Leeuwenh.? Spermatozoa are therefore animals in their own right, with bodies; but they are practically pushed off the edge of the world of taxonomy: class Worms (Vermes), genus Chaos, species unknown (obscurae), Spermatici vermiculi (spermatic worms), discovered by Leeuwenhoek. Hacking Up Hydras The first decades of our awareness of sperm witnessed a tumultuous effort to avoid applying the principle of analogy at all-to deny the possibility that we might be related to "spermatic worms." That virulent revulsion did not come into play with animalcules less intimately associated with human bodies. Instead it became a matter of testing the limits of analogic thinking in order to comprehend new forms of life. The freshwater hydra is a well-studied cause celebre (fig. 7). At first, it appeared to be a plant, since it spends most of its life fixed to underwater leaves and stalks. But then it was observed to "walk," by pulling up its "roots" and tumbling slowly end over end. The monstrous "Polype" seemed even more so when it was "divided"-that is, its "arms" were cut-and each frag- ment grew into a whole creature. It seemed to have no internal organs, only a cylinder within a cylinder, sometimes filled with green "curds." One researcher decided that the "curds" were neither "blood" nor "sap" but something else, not confined to animal or plant "vessels" but free to roam throughout the body like curds in milk.32 Consider the monstrous possibilities of the Polype from the late eighteenth-century standpoint: a single "limb" (a limb, we may note, with no bones, no hand, no muscles, and no skin) could regenerate into a whole Polype, which might then develop "buds" on which smaller Polypes would grow and then swim or "tumble" away.33 Even plants did not propagate that way. Those Polype "children" would be "sons" and "daughters" of arms. Budding did not seem normal (though there are plant species that grow miniatures of themselves rather than seeds), and for animals it has always been a traditionally monstrous possi- bility. Its equivalent in humans is not the hidden womb but the psychotic fantasy (think of David Cronenberg's film The Brood, with its budding mother), the swelling boil, the malignant tumor. Hydras appeared to be sexually and anatomically deviant, but at least they had a "mature" form that could be described analogically (as a headless, footless, On Visual Desperation and the Bodies of Protozoa 43</page><page sequence="12">skinless, boneless trunk and arms). Other animalcules could not be so easily described, since they seemed to be toying with the more basic idea that a body should have a canonical form proper to its species. Heinrich August Wrisberg's Observationum de animalculis infusoriis satura (1765) includes a description of infu- soria that have no single form (fig. 8). One such group of "molecules" (probably bacteria) exists in seven forms: in groups (A), lines and triangles (B, C) that swim, aggregates of "four, five, or more" (D, E), as an "animalculum sphaericum" (I), and as globules with a "tail of little bladders" (cauda vesiculari; H). The groups, as "individuals," can themselves become gregarious, as at K and L, where "two of the animalcules grow together" (duo eiusmodi animalcula, coalitioni proxima), and this opens the way to larger groups: an infinite scale leading toward man-the animal who had recently credited himself with inventing the "social contract." Wrisberg's animalcules apply the principle of atomism to living bodies. A human body becomes nothing more than a magnetic aggregate of primal spheres, and that in turn implies the loss of an essential quality of the body as it had been known: its unity, the dependence of its parts. The Polype could be hacked apart into slices and shreds, but each scrap was A ,i ~ l ' ,, '' : " ' ". ? ': '. FIGURE 7. The freshwater hydra.

Between the two extremes, comprehensible analogic bodies were being compressed into a nar- rowing space. Breaking the Chain of Being This incipient conceptual chaos was meliorated somewhat by the thought that there might still be a continuum of forms from most complex to most simple. Martin Frobenius Ledermiiller illustrates a drop of carp semen, in which he is pleasantly surprised to find "millions of little egg-shaped creatures" describing sinuous paths through the seminal fluid.34 Circulating granulated pro- toplasm was taken for alarming numbers of gestating embryos. Some thought the fecundity of protozoa was unnatural, "especially if we consider the infinite number of young ones which are visible to us through the transparent skins of their bodies."35 The Chain of Being encouraged the imagination to see bodies within bodies, composed of bodies, surrounded by bodies. Needham wondered how such things were generated: "If in the common Way ... the Process will be boundless," he thought, "and [each] in their seed have others."36 Perhaps most eloquent is John Hill, in the Essays on Natural History (1752): It is not to be doubted but Creatures, even below the minutest of those we see in the common Fluids, may have existence there, and that Gradations infinite between these Atoms of Existence and nothing, may have Being37 On Visual Desperation and the Bodies of Protozoa 45</page><page sequence="14">William Turton's edition of Linnaeus (1806) ends not with the obscurae we consid- ered above but with another meditation, a painterly evocation of the last visible things: Termo ... a most minute simple gelatinous point... in most animal and vegetable infu- sions: of all known animals the most minute and simple, being so extremely delicate and transparent as often to elude the most highly magnifying powers, blending as it were in the water in which it swims.38 Such evocations of the Chain of Being exemplify a holistic sense of analogy: if beings continue toward the atoms or the stars (and the astronomers' conjecture of infinite stars is significant here),39 then one must be related to another according to a universally applicable analogical comparison. But the wholesale reinterpretation of protozoa as small creatures "like" other bodies could not be satisfying, if only because it was also a dodge, a way of avoiding their unsettling differences. Louis Joblot's Descriptions et usages de plusiers nouveaux microscopes ... (1718) attempts to salvage analogic explanation by giving his "poissons" names like "Gold and Silver Bagpipe," "Turtle" (a "fish" that has "horns" "like a stag"), and "Water Caterpillar" (chenille aquatique).40 Henry Baker's "Bell-Animals, Wheel-Animals [and] Funnel-Animals" are similar solutions.41 The end of this literal metaphorization is anthropomorphic delusion, as in Joblot's "perfect Mask" that has six "legs," a "tail," and a "singular coiffure" (coiffure singuliere; fig. 9, bottom). There is no question of literal belief here, but of a delicate and loose relation between observation and representation that misuses fantasia for expla- nation. Ledermuller, too, does not think his "Harlequin worm" is dressed to dance, but neither does he suspect he may be making something other than useful description. The next generations were irresistibly attracted to these stretched analogies, though they tended to use them with greater precision. At the same time, each improvement in accuracy was an attack on the continuous Chain of Being. Typi- cally only a few parts of an animalcule could be assigned analogic meaning, so that the explanations tended to sound wrong. Thus Henry Baker finds a "body" on his Polype, along with a "head" with "mouth" or a "kind of snout" and possibly "teeth" (or at least a "fine scale"), a "gut" with a "stomach" and an "anus," and a "tail," but he allows that the "body" "has no Part that can be called either Back or Belly."42 In a footnote he defends the use of"arms" for the Polype's tentacles: "As these Parts serve the Purposes of Arms rather than Horns; I shall chuse all along to call them by that Name." He names the "head" not because it looks like an animal's head, but because it is "that anterior part which raises in the center between its Arms," and asks that the reader understand it is not "like" the heads of other animals. More monstrous combinations are even less convincing. Hill recorded "lobster's claws" on microscopic animals.43 Vorticella campanella, a bell- shaped animalcule, uses flagella to sweep a vortex of water and nutrients into its 46 REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="15">I, . .. ... . -.:.e: ... .' .. , ,,. ? ? :'~~~~FIGURE 9.

The swirling flagella are a confusing sight: Leeuwenhoek saw "horses' ears" (hoorntgens) and Baker imagined a "bearded tongue."44 To use a Panspermist metaphor, these far-fetched analogies contained the seeds of their own destruction, since each one spoke eloquently about its own insufficiency. As soon as it became impossible to conceive of simple protozoans with "an Apparatus of Limbs more elaborately formed than those of the largest animals,"45 it also became impossible to retain the once-continuous Chain of Being. Some Panspermists, ready to accept different seeds for different creatures, were among the first to articulate the new position: For tho' . . . Nature seems everywhere to ... go off by almost imperceptible Gradation; yet, in our present Ignorance of the entire Chain of Being, we are so liable to mistake distant species for the most immediate ones to each other, that the Analogy is thereby nearly extinguished, and its Traces almost effac'd6 One of the last natural philosophers to hold the eighteenth-century views is Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg, whose Infusion Animals as Fully Developed Organ- isms: A Look into the Deeper Organic Life of Nature (1838) has become proverbial as On Visual Desperation and the Bodies of Protozoa 47 On Visual Desperation and the Bodies of Protozoa 47</page><page sequence="16">* *. co * FIGURE 10.

He discovered "over fifty" stom- achs (Magen) in Leucophrys patula, and proclaimed protozoa must have digestive tracts on the model of higher forms.48 To do this, he had to imagine connecting stretches of gut, since protozoa have free-floating "vacuoles," "stomachs" without tubes. Ehrenberg's long texts and intricate observations are innervated with the quality of visual desperation: he could not bear to see what lay plainly before him, and so he strained to see a familiar form in the shifting translucent jelly (fig. 10). The stomach plays a strange role in Ehrenberg's writing, since it is a metonym for the body. When a stomach (with its attendant esophagus and intestine) is present, the creature suddenly has a body like a bird, a cow, or a person. Without the stomach, there is only the almost invisible sarcode, mysteriously moving and alive. The Difference Between an Eye and an Eye-Spot The analogic Chain of Being finally broke under the pressure of these microscopic infractions, and at the same time the animalcules' bodies became incomprehensible. Felix Dujardin, one of Ehrenberg's many critics, is careful not to separate animal and plant too rigorously, though the temptation to do so must be counted as an inexorable human instinct. Instead he implies it is a matter of continua punctuated by gaps. He is skeptical of the "eye" that had been seen on the "monoculous Insect" Cyclops. The red or black eyespot (stigma) that we would like to consider an animal feature is made from "plant" structures like chloro- plasts. We could say, in eighteenth-century terms, either these stigmata are "plant eyes" proper to plants, or our own eyes are descended from plant parts, so that 48 REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="17">vision itself is vegetal-a barely conceivable alternative, but one that was seriously entertained in eighteenth-century discussions about the possibility that minerals might be kinds of vegetables, with their own "seminal matter." The "red spot" (tache rouge) had also been cited as a primary characteristic of the protozoan Euglena, an animal/plant that can swim but also pause and make energy for itself using inbuilt chloroplasts. Dujardin says the "tache rouge" is "extremely variable, sometimes multiple and sometimes made up of irregular groups of grains."49 Carl Theodor Ernst von Siebold, another critic, remarks that the "simple pigment point" "has no cornea, and contains no body capable of refracting light" and therefore is not an eye.50 Other red spots in protozoa turned out not to be eyes, and some protozoa thought to be sensitive to light showed no evidence of eyes. Eventually, these critiques of dissective analogies turn on the illogical nature of analogy in general: Mr. Ehrenberg, following his methodology, assumes the significance of his "red spots," and must then explain certain white spots . . . which he takes for a brain or at least a nerve ganglion ... [but] that is all that the Infusoria have in the way of a nervous system; all the rest has to be provided by analogy.5' The frontal attack on analogy leaves little room for the likes of Leeuwenhoek or Joblot (whose observations Dujardin finds "so strange and fantastic") and, more important for the future, it transforms a psychologically and epistemologically helpful reaction (seeing tentacles as arms) into a problem. What exactly is the "tache rouge" if it is not an eye, or even the analogue of an eye? Can it really be satisfying to claim it is a variable concatenation of unknown properties? Dujardin remarks that Ehrenberg and others are wrong to assign human structures to microorganisms. Instead protozoa should be said to possess a "degree of organ- isation in proportion to their mode of existence" (en rapport avec leur maniere de vivre). Instead of judging protozoa to be like humans (or turtles or bagpipes), or giving them arms (or horns or fins), Dujardin carefully speaks of structures and parts "like" others or "reminiscent" of them. But note the weight that these words are forced to carry. The analogies are unworkable, but without them the bodies are incomprehensible. Current microbiology has not resolved these problems. Analogies still occur, but they are confined to schematic illustrations and to introductory passages. The former strategy is common in older texts, before photographs could be cheaply reproduced. Ernst Haeckel's idealized plates of Radiolaria imagine them as machines or geometric constructs, even though he does not say so in the text (fig. 11). When analogies occur in modern texts, they tend to be confined to paren- thetical passages, or simplified pedagogical texts, where it is clear that they are only for the purposes of initial comprehension. Siebold, in a modern voice un- afraid of technical neologism, speaks of "a round, pulsating cavity," the "vacuolae" and "oral aperture," and "vesicular, irregular contracting cavities." Contemporary On Visual Desperation and the Bodies of Protozoa 49</page><page sequence="18">microbiology is more thoroughly grammaticized, with its caryogamy, syzygy, heter- othallism, and automixis instead of undifferentiated copulation. Many fossils of analogic thought are embedded in our current jargon; one need only recall sper- matozoa, with its echoes of Linnaean classification. I would like to stress that the proliferation of neologisms does not solve the problem of analogy but rather defers it, pushes it outside the texts. It is still nec- essary to think analogically in order to achieve an initial comprehension. Karl G. Grell, in one of the best recent textbooks, notes that independent fission in mito- chondria and plastids has been observed, thereby making them strongly "remi- niscent" of free-living organisms "trapped" in cells; but he doubts that organelles can be equated with organs or organisms, since organelles "are not a 'cell within a cell"' but "have to be regarded as 'semi-autonomous."' A plastid is "like" a cell- that is the classical analogy, the one that would have captivated Enlightenment observers-but it is also not like a cell, since it is only "'semi-autonomous."' Why is semi-autonomous in quotation marks? Because everything living is semi- autonomous, and the purpose here is to escape from the analogy without inter- rogating it too closely. The quotation marks, and the strict phrase "have to be regarded," are the formalized residue of eighteenth-century dilemmas. Proto- zoans, he says (and his detachment here might well have seemed insouciant to the early workers), "generally reach a higher degree of differentiation than metazoan cells."52 This emphasis (the italics are his) skirts a philosophic problem, as recal- citrant as ever: What are our own bodies, if not structures with a "high degree of differentiation"? The shimmering "infinite number of young" that thronged inside transparent "mothers" would today be explained as a characteristic of pro- toplasm. Protoplasm commonly circulates, and the conjunction of that circulation FIGURE 11. Radiolaria.

Kakabekia The sense of desperation that overcame the early investigators as they watched orderly creation breaking apart into a myriad perversities can only be recaptured for us in rare, peripheral cases. Kakabekia is one such (fig. 12). It is an "umbrella-shaped" organism, found only in two soil samples in the courtyard of Harlech Castle in Wales. It lives in an ammonia-soaked environment-an ancient horse stable-that would be disastrous to any other organism. Still, it is not utterly alone in creation, because it has also been found in a wildly different place: in the two-billion-year-old Gunflint Chert formation in Ontario. The connections between the two remain hypothetical. As a fossil, it is called Kakabekia umbellata; as a living organism, Kakabekia sp.: the same genus, two billion years apart, unre- lated to any others in the interim.53 A "green helical organism," described in 1940, "moves by growing," recycling itself like a tank tread. It remains unclassified, though it may be related to spirochaete bacteria.54 For the most part, one has to go beyond science to find more extensive par- On Visual Desperation and the Bodies of Protozoa 51</page><page sequence="20">allels to Enlightenment wonder. Wilhelm Reich's The Bions (1938) revives the Pan- spermists' position: "Life can burst forth anywhere." This may be an unwitting revival, since Reich was compelled to ignore the history of science in order to proceed the way he did. If samples of organic matter are heated to incandescence, and then cultured on sterile media, then according to Reich they produce "bions," pre-living, motile units that then develop into "org-animalcules," what we call protozoa and infusoria.55 Heat and swelling are the keys to the germination of the nascent "spores": "I could not help but think," he writes, "that all known types of spores must have formed when the earth was still hot." The eccentric position of such discoveries underscores the decisive linguistic transformation that has affected mainstream scientific inquiry. The process of analogical thinking now occurs below the horizon of scientific publication, and it is there we have to look to find what has become of Ehrenberg's "stomachs" or Leeuwenhoek's "horses' ears." The early microscopists looked at dierken and won- dered "Who are we?"; the recent protozoologists look at the same organisms, which possess the same power to call into question concepts as fundamental as the nature, form, and sexuality of the human body, and they ask about "semi- autonomy" and "degrees of differentiation." Scientific terminology, italics, and quotation marks have become the procrustean beds of analogic thinking and imaginative metaphor. At the same time, they have effectively quelled the visual desperation that threatened early accounts by redescribing the failure of analogy as a matter of linguistic construction. Notes 1. John M.

The connection between the eighteenth-century breakdown of the analogic Chain of Being and microscopy can also be followed in Bishop Berkeley's "argument from microscopes": blood appears solidly red, but under the microscope it is part red cells and part clear fluid. But either one or both of these impressions must be wrong, and therefore color is a secondary quality, so that "the colors which we see [do not] exist in external bodies." This approach was made famous in another form and for our century by Bertrand Russell's argument about the various "real" tables shown us by our eyes and by our microscopes. See Berkeley, Three Dialogues Between Hylas and Phi- lonous (Indianapolis, 1979), esp. 20; and Russell, The Problems of Philosophy (Oxford, 52 REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="21">1975), 10.

Critics of this notion thought that sexual reproduction would eventually be necessary, so that the animalcules could spawn and then die. (The psychology of this is immediately apparent: sex involves death, and the researchers wished to be sure microscopic animalcules had not found a better way.) Eventually- in the first decades of this century-L. L. Woodruff completed exhaustive experiments to prove that Paramecium sp. could regenerate indefinitely without needing to resort to sexual reproduction. A single individual, therefore, is effectively "immortal": it splits part of itself, which goes on living until it is ready to split; there is no dissolution, no "death," and no need to find another organism to perpetuate life. See Woodruff, "A Summary of the Results of Certain Physiological Studies on a Pedigreed Race of Paramecium," Biochemical Bulletin 1 (1912): 396ff.

With the nineteenth-century realization that no brain was going to be discovered in animalcules, the protoplasm and its motive force became an object of intense interest. The investigations take their philosophic force from debates about the senses, "irritability," and the mind-body problem. These better-known sources should be cor- related with more recent research on artificial intelligence and especially propriocep- tion, the body's internal senses.

Fischer, Fixirung, Fuarbung, und Bau des Protoplasm (Jena, 1899), which are some- times preoccupied with the most tenuous, "etherial" tissues. 20.
