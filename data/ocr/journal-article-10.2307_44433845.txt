(SP-479) A Guide for Power Plant Installations in Trucks. John C. Walter, Cummins Engine Co., Inc. The installation of a power plant in a truck carries with it a requirement for attention to the systems which provide the operational support for the power plant. This paper addresses these systems by describing and discussing the designs that are commonly used and some of the pitfalls that may be encountered. These support systems are covered: engine mounting, cooling, drive train, air intake, fuel, lubrication, exhaust, and accessories. Also discussed are clearances between the engine and adjacent surfaces and truck noise levels. 810003. A Reconnaissance of Supercharging Technology 1902-1980. Richard F. Ansdale, Engineering Consultant. The very sophistication of modern turbocharging tech- niques seems to overshadow other forms of supercharging and their excellent potential for tailoring engine per- formance characteristics more in line with actual re- quirements, that is, enhanced performance, fuel economy and/or more acceptable emission levels. Indeed certain turbocharging practices follow a self defeating path thus encouraging a re-examination of supercharging by other means: exploitation of pressure waves, induction tuning and, most recently, recourse to positive displacement supercharging with and without exhaust reheat and comparative performance evaluation at vehicle level. 810004. An Overview of Some Turbocharged Gasoline and Diesel Engine Automobiles. Robert A. Mercure, National Highway Traffic Safety Ad- ministration, U.S. Department of Transporta- tion. This paper makes an overview of published data on the performance, fuel economy, and emissions of some recently introduced turbocharged gasoline and diesel engine powered passenger cars. These vehicles are com- pared with models equipped with naturally aspirated engines of larger displacement and with comparable overall performance. The problems of the small turbo- charger are discussed. Some data is provided on the efficiency degradation of small compressors as a function of blade tip clearances. Different magnitudes of fuel economy improvement can be obtained by applying the turbocharger to gasoline and diesel engines depending on the utilization of the increased power. The use of increased power is largely limited by the turbocharger inefficiency and acceleration lag. Solutions to these problems do not appear promising for the near term. Furthermore, power options continue to be offered by U.S. manufacturers with engines of increased displace- ment. In view of these considerations, it appears unlikely that any type of turbocharger will be applied to high volume production models manufactured by U.S. auto- makers in the near term. 810005. Turbocharging the Automotive Two Stroke Diesel Engine. R. Parkin, P. C. Few and D. J. Picken, School of Mechanical &amp; Production Engrg., Leicester Polytechnic (Leicester/England). This paper reports the theoretical and experimental investigation of different combinations of automotive, two stroke, diesel engine with scavenge blower, turbocharger and auxiliary combustion chamber. The various configurations are compared on a basis of trapped air flow, charge density and power output. It is shown that freely turbocharged operation of a high speed, two stroke, engine is limited by the low overall efficiency of turbochargers in the size range recom- mended, and methods of alleviating this problem are described. 810006. Supercharging for Fuel Economy. J. Buike, J. Davis, J. Marsh and L. Ryder, Bendix Super- charger Engineering Center, Farmington, MI. This paper explores the apparent dichotomy between the performance benefits of supercharging and fuel economy. Following an investigation of the tools available for fuel savings, especially drivetrain and engine alternatives, the desirable characteristics and optimum configuration of a supercharger are examined. Engine dynamometer data for a 1.7-liter gasoline engine equipped with a Bendix Supercharger and performance and test data from Bendix-supercharged test vehicles confirm that super- charging provides a means to achieve fuel economy, performance, driveability, and acceptable emissions. 810007. Chrysler Corporation's New 2.2 Liter 4 Cylinder Engine. W. L. Weertman and J. W. Dean, Engineering Staff, Chrysler Corp. A new 2.2 liter SOHC four cylinder engine was designed and developed for Chrysler Corporation FWD vehicles. The overall design and many of the specific features have been selected to favor the FWD installation. This paper describes the design characteristics of the major parts and discusses many of the significant development items. In providing this new engine emphasis was placed on performance, fuel economy, emissions, durability, min- imum weight, package size, serviceability, and manufac- turing. Extensive testing, including initial production engines, has verified that the program objectives have been achieved. 810008. World Wide Escort/Lynx Engine Design and Development. J. F. Macura, J. C. Gagliardi and J. G. Quick, Ford Motor Co., J. A. Howard, Ford Motor Co., Ltd.; and W. Hirsch, Ford of Germany. In 1981, Ford Motor Company introduced a new family of fuel efficient four cylinder engines world wide. These engines, based on a compound valve arrangement in a hemispherical combustion chamber, were specifically 21</page><page sequence="3">810010-810014 designed for installation in light weight front-wheel-drive vehicles. Ford Research efforts were integrated with the resources of Ford U.S. and Ford of Europe to design and develop the engine in a compressed time frame. The technical and organizational efforts to accomplish this task, as well as the design and development are discussed. 810010. Nissan NAPS-Z Engine Realizes Better Fuel Economy and Low NOx Emission. Masanori Harada, Tadashi Kadota and Yoshitaka Sugi- yama, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. (Yokosuka, Japan). Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. has succeeded in developing a highly reliable, simple-mechanism engine that can be used with a carburetor system, a fuel injection system or an LPG system. During the 1980 certification programs conducted in the United States and Japan, this engine was unrivaled in its low emissions and excellent fuel economy. Such high fuel efficiency is realized by the adoption of a fast-burn combustion system. Fast-burn combustion is made possible by the development of a high-speed swirl system and a two-point ignition system. Furthermore, an EGR system with a WT valve has also been developed to afford precise control over the EGR, which is what optimizes the performance characteristics of this engine. Uniform EGR distribution is realized through improve- ments made in the intake manifold. Because of its low emission levels and high fuel efficiency, this engine is expected to find wide utilization in meeting the stringent requirements for energy conser- vation and environmental protection. 1981 SA E Transactions 810011. Forensic Analysis of Automobile Fires. Dennis A. Guenther, Dept. of Mechanical Engrg., The Ohio State Univ.; Larry G. Goodwin and Ronald N. Thaman, Systems Engineering As- sociates, Columbus, OH. This paper presents the methodology of the investigative techniques for examining vehicular fires. Discussion illustrating the mechanical "finger prints" that show the investigating team the mechanism of fire spread is presented. The common causes of vehicular fires and examples of each are discussed. The techniques used by the forensic chemist in determining incendiary fires and the use of specialized equipment in the investigation are illustrated. Tests are discussed to show the theories postulated in the investigative stages of the vehicle examination. Lastly, the interdisciplinary team approach to the investigation is discussed showing the validity of "forensic" engineering and chemistry in examining vehicle fires. 1981 SA E Transactions 810012. Motor Vehicle Non-Crash Fires. Peter Cooley, Highway Safety Research Institute, Univ. of Michigan. Non-crash motor vehicle fires have received less attention by specialists in automotive safety than crash fires. They can be equally spectacular but result in fewer, less serious injuries. They occur on an average of one out of every 1,000 registered vehicles and can result in significant property damage. Various data sources on non-crash fires were reviewed with reference to previous studies. Fire department responses to motor vehicle fires reported in 1976-1977 within Michigan were analyzed. A review of burn injuries associated with motor vehicles indicates that persons working on a stationary vehicle and accidently coming into contact with a hot surface is the largest source of injury. Injuries received from fire in a car not involved in an accident account for less than 7% of these injuries, which are mostly minor. It was recommended that some form of industry standard be established that considers smoke emission, toxicity of gas by-products of combustion, and ignition sources as well as burn rate of materials. Such a standard could be flexible and adaptable to changes in vehicle design and new processes and materials. 1981 SA E Transactions 810013. Fire Tests and Criteria for Mass Transportation Seats. Robert Brady Williamson and Fred L. Fisher, Univ. of California, Berkeley, CA. The role of polyurethane seats in fire growth is briefly reviewed. The focus of this paper first of all determines the fire characteristics and hazards of the original polyurethane BART seats and secondly, evaluates re- placement seating materials. Fire test procedures are described and test results are given for both the poly- urethane and the LS-200 "Low-Smoke" seats. 810014. Mechanisms of Antioxidant Decay in Gasoline Engines: Investigations of Zinc Dialkyldithio- phosphate Additives. Stefan Korcek, Lee R. Mahoney, Milton D. Johnson and Walter O. Siegl, Ford Motor Co., Dearborn, MI. Selected engine oils and zinc dialkyldithiophosphate additive concentrates have been added to used oils in various engines and subjected to engine testing. Oil samples obtained as a function of mileage accumulation have been analyzed using the peroxy radical titration method and 31P NMR. The engine studies were supple- mented by laboratory investigations of antioxidant be- havior of pure neutral and basic zinc dialkyldithio- phosphates, dialkyldithiophosphoric acid, tetraalkylthio- peroxydiphosphate (disulfide), and of neutral zinc dial- kyldithiophosphate in combination with a hindered phenol antioxidant, 4,4'-methylenebis(2,6-ditert -butyl- phenol). These investigations included studies of the effects of hydroperoxides and hydrocarbon oxidation products on the radical scavenging activity of the above compounds. The results obtained from engine and laboratory studies were used to assess the role and 22</page><page sequence="4">810015-810019 chemical changes of zinc dialkyldithiophosphate additives in radical scavenging processes in the engine. 810015. The Fate of Ashless Dispersants in Gasoline Engines as Followed by Carbon- 14 Radiolabeling. T. R. Erdman, Chevron Research Company, Richmond, California. This paper describes the use of carbon- 14 radiolabeled succinimides and succinate esters to investigate the role of ashless dispersants in controlling deposit formation in gasoline engines. Analysis of used oils, varnish deposits, and insolubles from several gasoline engine tests showed that: 1. Ashless dispersants were not significantly broken down chemically in service. 2. Dispersants played an active role in the processes leading to deposits and were evenly distributed in varnish throughout the engine. 3. Insolubles in the oil were agglomerations of small, primary particles of about 300-400 diameter. 4. A major portion of the dispersant in used oils was bound up with polar organic and inorganic species and was unable to assist in dispersing particles. The implication of these findings on the development of new additives and crankcase oil formulations is discussed. Discussion: Darreil W. Brownawell, Exxon Chemical Co. 1981 SA E Transactions 810016. Lubricant Performance in Passenger Car Turbo- chargers. J. A. Keller, H. V. Lowther and T. W. Rogers, Mobil Research and Development Corp. Turbocharging of gasoline-powered passenger car engines, to provide improved performance while maintaining good overall fuel economy, has been adopted by some U.S. and overseas builders. The high temperatures encountered in turbochargers can seriously affect the engine oil life. Under certain severe operating conditions excessive oil degradation deposits can be formed in the turbochargers which can lead to bearing failure. A vehicle chassis-rolls test procedure was developed to evaluate lubricant composition effects on turbocharger deposits and bearing condition. Evaluations of a number of different engine oils have demonstrated superior performance for one class of synthetic oil over high-quality mineral oils in lubri- cating the high-temperature areas of passenger car turbochargers. 810017. Gasoline Engine Combustion - Turbulence and the Combustion Chamber. M. T. Overington and R. H. Thring, Ricardo Consulting Engineers Ltd. A research programme has been carried out to investigate the effects of operating gasoline engines with different combustion systems. The results showed that at high compression ratios (13:1) compact combustion chambers allowed an increase in compression ratio of between 1 and 2,/2 numbers for a given fuel quality compared to conventional designs. Fuel economy benefits of about 10% could be achieved by using high ratio compact chambers and lean operation. 810018. A Study of the Genesis Mechanism of Unburned Hydrocarbons in a Constant Volume Bomb. N. Yamada and Y. Iwashita, Toyota Motor Co., Ltd.; and T. Asaba, Univ. of Tokyo. The genesis mechanism of unburned hydrocarbons (HC) in a turbulent flow field has been studied by using constant volume cylindrical bombs. To investigate the influence of the turbulence intensity on combustion duration and HC, two different types of turbulence, one was the turbulence generated by swirling flow and the other was the isotropic turbulence, were selected. Results show that HC decreases with increasing the turbulence intensity and is independent of turbulence properties and even weaker turbulence which has little effect on com- bustion duration has a great deal of effect on HC. A special technique was devised to freeze a reaction at an arbitrary moment of combustion process. The fol- lowing points have been made clear. First, the oxidation of HC continues for a while after the pressure has peaked. Second, the reaction rate of post flame oxidation increases with turbulence intensity, but the fraction of HC oxida- tion after the pressure has peaked is about 60% and is not influenced by the turbulence intensity. 810019. Hydrocarbon Oxidation in the Exhaust Port of a Spark Ignition Engine. John V. Mendillo, Com- bustion Technology Unit, Arthur D. Little, Inc.; and John B. Heywood, Sloan Automotive Lab., Massachusetts Institute of Technology. An experimental study was performed to determine the fraction of unburned hydrocarbon emissions which are oxidized in the exhaust port of a spark ignition engine. The technique used was injection of a C02 quench gas into the exhaust port, at various planes along the port centerline, to cool the exhaust gas and "freeze" the hydrocarbon oxidation reactions. By quenching the reaction of hydrocarbons at the cylinder exit plane, cylinder exit hydrocarbon emissions levels were deter- mined. By differencing the concentration of hydrocarbons observed during quenching and nonquenching operation, fraction of hydrocarbons reacting in each section of the exhaust was determined. Experiments were carried out to define the effects of engine operating conditions on the fraction of hydro- carbons oxidized. The variables studied were fuel-air equivalence ratio, speed, load, spark advance and com- pression ratio. The results of the experimental parametric study were correlated with those predicted by an existing exhaust port oxidation model. The results show that reductions in hydrocarbon level due to oxidation in the exhaust port range between 2 and 23</page><page sequence="5">810020-810024 37%. Those variables that cause substantial changes in gas temperature, port residence time, or oxygen concentration were most significant. Cylinder exit hydrocarbon emis- sions levels and the extent of reaction within the exhaust port for a range of fuel composition were also determined. A set of experiments with air injection into the exhaust, at the cylinder exit plane, showed that substantial additional oxidation of hydrocarbons can be obtained with injection into the exhaust gases before significant cooling occurs. 810020. Cyclic Dispersion in the Homogeneous-Charge Spark-Ignition Engine - A Literature Survey. Michael B. Young, General Motors Research Labs. This literature survey was undertaken to assess the state of the art relative to cyclic dispersion in combustion and its effect on the subsequent pressure development in the cylinder of a homogeneous-charge spark-ignition engine. The scope of this survey ranges from papers written about 25 years ago, corresponding to the beginning of systematic investigations of this phenomenon, to more recent papers. The earlier papers described survey-type experiments in which controllable engine and operating variables were changed, generally one at a time. More recent papers have dealt with the relations between in-cylinder flows, and cyclic combustion and pressure variations. In this survey, these papers are reviewed and the findings are summa- rized. 1981 SAE Transactions 810022. The Effect of Truck Dieselization on Fuel Usage. Anil B. Jambekar and John H. Johnson, Mich- igan Technological Univ. The effect of truck dieselization for three levels of diesel penetration into each of the eight classes of trucks is modeled. Diesel and total truck sales, population, mileage and yearly fuel usage data are aggregated by four truck classes representing light, medium, light-heavy and heavy-heavy classes. Four fuel economy scenarios for different technolog- ical improvements were studied. Improvement of fuel economy for light and heavy-heavy duty vehicle classes provides significant total fuel savings. Truck dieselization of light and light-heavy duty vehicle classes provides the largest improvement of fuel usage due to the fact that they have large numbers of vehicles and presently have few diesels. Total car and truck fuel usage in the 1980's shows roughly a constant demand with cars decreasing due to improved new fleet fuel economy and trucks increasing due to a larger population with better fuel economy due to dieselization and improved technology. These trends show total on-highway diesel fuel usage shifting from 13% in 1980 to 25-40% in 1990 depending upon the level of dieselization of cars and trucks. 810023. Medium-and Heavy-Duty Truck Fuel Economy and Consumption Trends. David Lax, Energy and Environmental Analysis, Inc., Arlington, VA; and Eldon Rucker, Dept. of Energy, Office of Transportation Programs, Conservation and Solar Energy, Washington, DC. This paper presents the results of an analysis of trends in medium- and heavy-duty truck fuel economy and fuel demand. The analysis is based on an examination of in-use fuel economy data contained in the 1977 Truck Inventory and Use Survey and a survey of the available literature. Estimates of future trends in medium- and heavy-duty truck fuel demand through 1995 are developed with the use of an accounting model of highway fuel consumption. The authors conclude that the estimation of current and future trends in medium- and heavy-duty truck fuel economy and fuel demand is subject to a high degree of uncertainty due to the significant variation in truck weight and use characteristics and the lack of sufficient data which are based on consistent fuel economy measurement procedures. The output of the model of highway fuel demand is compared with available statistics on truck use patterns in order to calibrate projections of medium- and heavy-duty truck fuel consumption usage by medium- and heavy-duty trucks is estimated to grow from 1.1 MMB/D in 1979 to 1.4 MMB/D in 1995. 810024. Low Temperature Field Performance of Flow Improved Diesel Fuels. D. E. Steere, Imperial Oil Limited; and J. P. Marino, Exxon Chemical Co. Recent trends predicted by the Petroleum Industry are showing an increased demand for diesel fuel. This is because of the increase in diesel vehicles in North America due to the excellent fuel economy of the diesel engine. This trend will, however, tax the crude barrel for diesel fuel owing competing demands for jet fuel, kerosene, and heating oil. A way of overcoming the projected shortages of diesel fuel is through the use of specially designed flow improvers. These additives enable the blending of higher cloud point winter diesel fuels while maintaining satis- factory low temperature performance. A series of winter field tests have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of these products. In over-the-road tests it was shown that flow improved diesel fuels will operate satisfactorily down to 6-13°C below their cloud points. The actual performance was found to be dependent upon the fuel/additive combination and the particular engine fuel system design. The installation of a larger fuel filter on one of the critical engines and a fuel-line heater on another, further improved the low temperature performance. The results were used to confirm that the Low Temperature Flow Test (LTFT) can be used to accurately predict field results. 24</page><page sequence="6">810025-810030 810025. Transit Bus Fuel Economy Test. H. H. Buckel, Booz, Allen &amp; Hamilton, Transportation Con- sulting Div., Bethesda, MD. A transit bus fuel economy testing procedure has been developed, and verified by proving grounds tests, that will enable the motor coach industry to accurately evaluate vehicle modifications and new components without arduous and lengthy revenue service operations. This procedure is based on the proposed Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) recommended practice for Type II fuel economy testing of heavy-duty vehicles. Verification of the procedure was done by obtaining repeatable results from testing of bus weights and diesel fuels. Tests of other variables produced the following fuel consumption results. Changes in the bus weights produced a reduction of one half the percentage of each weight loss. Diesel fuel #2 demonstrated a one percent improvement over diesel #1, measured on a volume basis. Turbo- charged diesel engines demonstrated at least a 7 percent improvement over the baseline engine. A 22 percent reduction in the rear axle ratio decreased fuel consump- tion by nearly 6 percent. A tested oil additive did not change fuel consumption and the results of air condi- tioning produced inconclusive results. Testing was conducted in July 1980 as a joint effort of the government, SAE, and many elements of the transit industry. 810026. Weld Associated Localized Necking during Fab- rication of Dual Phase Steel Wheel Rims. M. S. Rashid, Metallurgy Dept., General Motors Re- search Laboratories; and A. E. Rathke, Me- chanical Engineering Dept., General Motors Institute. High strength steels, such as the dual phase steels and high strength, low alloy steels, offer potential for wheel weight reduction but have been used sparingly, in part, because of a special problem that is unique to wheel rim fabrication. Compared to plain carbon steel, these steels have a higher tendency for weld related neck formation during rim fabrication and this contributes to a higher production scrap rate. This paper investigates mechanical property and microstructural changes produced in the flash butt welded, heat affected zone of one commercially available dual phase steel. Heating conditions most likely to increase the tendency for localized necking are identified. Microstructural phenomena that might be responsible for the problem are discussed and plausible solutions are suggested. 1981 SAE Transactions 810027. Development of Cold Rolled High Strength Steel Sheet with Excellent Deep Drawability. Nobuo Ohashi, Toshio Irie, Susumu Satoh, Osamu Hashimoto and Isao Takahashi, Research Lab- oratories, Kawasaki Steel Corp. Deep drawing quality high strength (400 MPa grade) cold-rolled steel sheet for automotive use has been developed. This steel sheet is characterized by its chemical composition of extra low carbon, high phosphorus and small niobium together with aluminum. It exhibits very high f-value and elongation in tensile test and also an excellent deep drawability in small cup test and actual press test of automotive panel parts. The resistance to cold-work embrittlement is improved by controlling the compositions and the cooling rate after final annealing. Spot weldability and the weld performances are very good like as ordinary mild steel sheets. These properties are compared with those of DDQ grade mild steel sheet and previously developed high strength dual phase or rephos- phorized steel sheets. 1981 SAE Transactions 810028. High-Strength Cold-Rolled Steels Produced by Continuous Annealing and Their Automotive Applications. H. Takechi, N. Takahashi, M. Abe, O. Akisue and K. Koyama, Nippon Steel Corp. In continuous annealing, accelerated cooling methods have recently found practical application in addition to conventional gas jet cooling or water jet quenching method. Moderate cooling rate of gas jet cooling or accelerated cooling makes it possible to utilize new high-strength steels with excellent properties. The faster cooling rate deteriorates ductility of steels. These newly developed steels are improved rephos- phorized steels with high f-value and high bake hardenabi- lity, dual phase steels with superior ductility, Ti-stabilized high-strength steels with very high f-value, grain boundary hardening steels employing low temperature annealing, and unique ultra high-strength steels. This paper describes properties and process factors of these steels, and their automotive applications. 810029. Predicting Structural Performance of Automotive Bodies from As-Shipped Properties of Steel. Bernard S. Levy, Inland Steel Co., Research Laboratories. The purpose of this paper is to provide a simple analytic procedure for determining the potential for thickness reduction of structural body parts using mild and high strength steels where it is assumed that the effect of buckling or crippling is considered separately. Static, collision and fatigue loading cases are evaluated for both the bulk steel and for spot welds. In addition, the effect of forming and paint-bake aging on the as-received prop- erties of the steel is considered. 1981 SAE Transactions 810030. Deformation Behavior of High Strength Steel Sheets. T. Oki, Z. Shibata and M. Sudo, Kobe Steel, Ltd. (Japan). In this paper the tensile deformation behavior of dual- phase steel and the effect of mechanical properties of 25</page><page sequence="7">810031-810035 various types of high strength steel sheets on surface wrinkles during forming have been studied. A continuum model based on the "rule of mixture" is proposed to explain the tensile deformation behaviour of dual-phase steels which are composed of ferrite and martensite. In the model, the size of martensite and the strain ratio of martensite to ferrite are considered. Moreover, one of the assumptions of this theory is that the flow curves of the ferrite and martensite follow the equations a = Kcn and a = A lnc + Be + C respectively, where K, n, A, B and C are constants. Agreement between the calculated results and the experimental results is good for low volume fraction of martensite. The occurrence and growth of wrinkles under non-uniformly distributed stretching load depended mainly on the yield ratio and n-value in a small strain range. On the other hand, the occurrence, growth and disappearance of surface wrinkles during press forming were closely related to strength at the low strain state and r value. The steel sheets having low strength at the low strain state and high r value were hardly subject to wrinkles and when wrinkles occurred they were easily eliminated. 810031. Development of Door Guard Beams Utilizing Ultra High Strength Steel. Hiroshi Nousho, Yasuo Sasakura, Takeshi Miyamoto and Hiroshi Sakurai, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. Door guard beams have been developed through the utilization of ultra high strength steel (tensile strength &gt; 100 kg/mm2). At first, the sheet metal gauge was reduced in proportion to the strength of the ultra high strength without changing the shape of the beam section. This caused beam buckling and did not meet guard beam specifications. Analyzing this phenomena in accordance with the buckling theory of thin plates, a design criteria that makes effective use of the advantages of ultra high strength was developed. As a result, our newly designed small vehicle door guard beams are 20% lighter and 26% thinner than conventional ones. This makes it possible to reduce door thickness while increasing interior volume. 810032. A New Iron-Base Superalloy for Exhaust Valves. Tetsuo Kato, Norioki Uyehara and Kenkichi Matsunaga, Daido Steel Co., Ltd.; and Teruo Isomura, Masaki Matsuno and Masanori Iizuka, Fuji Valves Co., Ltd. For heavy duty gasoline or diesel engines, exhaust valves of 21-2N or 21-4N are generally coated by cobalt-base hard facing alloys, at faces. But the sluggish supply and the spiraling price of cobalt recently forced automakers to adopt valves of highgrade superalloys without hard facing. Candidate superalloys for high-performance exhaust valves are gamma-prime strengthened nickel-base alloys such as Inconel 751 and Nimonic 80A. Unfortunately above-mentioned alloys are too expensive for automobile components. So authors tried to develop a gamma-prime strengthened iron-base alloy, which bears basically 40% Ni-19% Cr-Al-Ti. To optimize Al and Ti contents the effect of the total amount and the ratio of them was examined thoroughly on hardness, strength and corrosion resistance of experimental alloys at elevated temperatures. Finally authors succeeded in developing a new gamma- prime strengthened iron-base superalloy, RS914, which is inexpensive and satisfies requirements for exhaust valves of both gasoline and diesel engines. 1981 SAE Transactions 810033. High Temperature Corrosion-Fatigue Test Meth- od for Exhaust Valve Alloys. Stephen B. Caird, Engine Components Div., Eaton Corp.; and David M. Trela, Engineering &amp; Research Cen- ter, Eaton Corp. A rotating beam fatigue test method was developed to determine the high-temperature corrosion-fatigue prop- erties of valve alloys under cyclic stress in a simulated engine operating environment. The test results showed that microstructural modification of an alloy through heat treatment can significantly improve corrosion-fatigue properties. For test development purposes, Nimonic 80A was selected for testing and a mixture of lead compounds was used as the corrosive environment. This is a typical combination of alloy and environment found in heavy- duty spark-ignited engines. This test method may also be applicable to other corrosion-fatigue problems such as sulfidation in diesel exhaust valves. 1981 SAE Transactions 810034. Development of Stamped Steel Exhaust Mani- folds - A Materials Supplier Program. Merle M. Cleeton, U.S. Steel Corp. This paper describes a materials supplier program de- signed to develop the use of stamped stainless steel exhaust manifolds for internal combustion engines. Inception of the program was the result of a plan to reduce weight of case engine components through the substitution of stamped steel components. The process of material choice, prototype, manufacture, initial testing, and resulting noise problems are described. Noise reduc- tion methods are reviewed including computer analysis. Prototype design production, testing, and joining methods are discussed. A review of the current state of the art and the projected future of stamped stainless steel exhaust manifolds conclude the paper. 810035. Influence of Columbium on the 870°C Creep Properties of 18% Chromium Ferritic Stainless Steels. John N. Johnson, Metallurgy Dept., General Motors Research Laboratories, Warren, MI. Ferritic stainless steels are commonly used for the 26</page><page sequence="8">810036-810046 structural components in automotive bead-bed catalytic converters. A laboratory investigation was conducted to characterize the elevated temperature creep properties of various ferritic steels. Results show that a significant improvement in 870°C creep strength of 18% chromium steels is achieved with the combination of approximately 0.5% free columbium and a high final annealing temper- ature. Such steels are shown to have short term 870° C creep properties comparable to type 304 stainless steel. The superior creep strength of columbium-bearing steels appears related to a Laves phase precipitate which forms at elevated temperatures. 1981 SAE Transactions 810036. Oxidation Resistant 12% Cr Automotive Stainless Steel. Joseph A. Douthett, Armco Inc. In response to the automotive industry's need to find stronger, more oxidation resistant stainless alloys, a study was carried out to evaluate 12% Cr ferritic stainless steels alloyed with Al, Ti and Cb. An alloy with 1.2%A1, .3%Ti and .6%Cb was chosen to optimize oxidation resistance, processability, weldability, and creep or sag strength. This ferritic composition known as 12SR possesses creep strength far superior to 409 due to solid solution strengthening with Cb. The Al and slightly higher Cr contents compared to 409 have increased the maximum service temperature with respect to oxidation by at least 55-83°C (100-150°F). Potential automotive applications include truck converters, sheet metal manifolds, and diesel particulate traps. By using the improved elevated tem- perature properties, weight savings may be realized. 1981 SAE Transactions 810037. Aluminum-Coated Steels for Elevated Temper- ature Applications. Alan F. Gibson, Farrell M. Kilbane and F. Curtiss Dunbar, Armco Inc., Research Center, Middletown, OH. The standard tests for exhaust system materials are reviewed and new tests involving cyclic oxidation and salt exposure plus oxidation are suggested. The importance of edge oxidation in the interpretation of oxidation weight gain measurement for coated steels is demonstrated. For aluminum-coated steel Type 1, 80% of the weight gain was due to edge oxidation for the test conditions used. Depth profiling an oxidized aluminum-coated steel Type 1 shows why this product is an excellent material for elevated temperature applications. The protective oxide on the aluminum-coated product remains almost pure aluminum oxide even after the coating has alloyed with the base steel. Improved aluminum-coated steels are shown to be possible by changing the chemical composition of the steel substrate. 810038. Corrosion of Cast Aluminum Alloys under Heat- Transfer Conditions. R. R. Wiggle, V. Hospa- daruk and F. M. Tibaudo, Ford Motor Co. Most coolant formulations designed for cast iron engines are unsatisfactory for aluminum head/block use because of excessive heat-transfer corrosion, resulting in heavy corrosion product deposition and loss of cooling effi- ciency in the radiator. The effect of inhibitor and buffer additives, singly and in combination, on the heat-transfer corrosion rates for cast aluminum alloys was investigated. It was shown that some tetraborate and phosphate mixtures can be exces- sively corrosive. Silicate, in contrast, effectively protects the heat-transfer surfaces. In addition, the effects of heat-transfer surface temperature, nucleate boiling, and variations in glycol, dissolved oxygen and chloride concentrations on the heat-transfer corrosion rate were investigated. 1981 SAE Transactions 810044.

After analyzing the epidemiological and data availability problems of con- ducting definitive research into the relationship between long-term exposure to shock and vibration and the health of truck drivers, they describe the requirements for a feasible, scientifically sound epidemiological research program that can be implemented incrementally. 810045. Comprehensive Measurement of Ride of In- Service Trucks. Henry R. Jex, John W. Zellner, Walter A. Johnson and Richard H. Klein, Systems Technology, Inc., Hawthorne, CA. This paper summarizes a comprehensive research program of the ride qualities of long-haul trucks. Factors are identified which contribute significantly to differences in ride quality between various truck models and config- urations over a range of actual operating conditions. Detailed measurements of six floor and seat accelerations and driver and passenger ride ratings were made on ten in-service trucks over five segments, ranging from "smooth" to "rough," of a typical California freeway. The experimental methodology is reviewed and validated, and example data and preliminary comparisons between the objective and subjective measures are presented. 1981 SAE Transactions 810046. Subjective and Objective Ride Evaluations of Commençai Vehicles. N. C. Mehta, International Harvester. The purpose of this paper is to explore the degree of correlation between the subjective ride evaluations by a qualified group of people and various objective ride vibration analysis techniques. It is not the purpose of this paper to establish limits to acceptable levels of vibration or vibration comfort criteria on an absolute basis. Rather it deals with relative aspects of ride comparisons between 27</page><page sequence="9">810047-810057 various vehicles. Preliminary evaluations of these objec- tive techniques indicate that they correlate well with subjective evaluations. 810047. A Subjective Assessment of Truck Ride Quality. James C. Miller, Human Factors Research, Inc., Goleta, CA. A subjective assessment of ride quality was undertaken in order to estimate the relationships among 22 factors that affect concepts of ride quality and to assess the interaction of these factors with 7 ride quality issues. Nine line-haul drivers drove and rated each of 16 tractor- trailer vehicles. The factors, driver vibration, ease of steering, and interior cab noise determined overall impressions of ride quality. Of the issues, front axle load, tractor configuration, tractor rear suspension, trailer suspension, trailer load, wheelbase length, and newer and older cab designs, the latter evoked the clearest differentiation of ride quality between paired vehicles. 810054. 1978 U. S. Automotive Service Market: How Large is Large? Lemuel Carroll DeWeese, III, General Motors Corp. The size of the 1978 automotive service market is the total dollars spent on car and truck repair and maintenance in 1978. The 1978 personal-use automotive service market is the retail dollars spent in 1978 on repair and maintenance for cars and trucks used primarily for personal trans- portation. Service market estimates in this report do not include body repair parts and body repairs. Bureau of Economic Analysis data indicate a personal-use service market, excluding do-it-yourself (DIY) service, of $36 billion. A similar estimate made by General Motors Research Laboratories, based on a large national survey of actual consumer expenditures, is $37 billion. The personal-use automotive service market, excluding DIY, is roughly 3/4 the size of the total automotive service market, based on data from the Motor and Equipment Manufacturers Association and Frost &amp; Sullivan, Inc. A $47 billion personal-use automotive service market es- timate for 1978 made by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration contains assumptions resulting in an estimate that is about $10-$1 1 billion higher than other estimates in this report. 810055. Is Your Automotive Service Equipment Telling You the Truth? - A National Field Evaluation of Automotive Test Equipment. William R. Magro and H. James Eckler, Booz, Allen &amp; Hamilton Inc., Transportation Consulting Div.; and Wendell A. Cook, Dept. of Transportation, National Highway Traffic Safety Administra- tion. Rational research and development of advanced inspec- tion, analysis, and diagnostic equipment cannot proceed without reliable quantitative information about the service equipment now in use. Although new equipment speci- fications are readily available, there is comparatively little data on the performance of equipment in use, and much of that is considered proprietary. This paper presents information on the condition, accuracy, and repeatability of automotive service equip- ment in use. This information was derived from on-site data obtained at a national sample of 307 auto repair/ diagnostic facilities. Over 6,000 pieces of some 24 types of equipment, ranging from tire pressure gauges to com- puterized engine analyzers, were subjected to detailed field engineering evaluation. 1981 SAE Transactions 810056. What You Always Wanted to Know About Auto Repair Shops but Were Afraid to Ask - A National Survey of Owner/Operators, Mechanics and Consumers. William R. Magro, Booz, Allen &amp; Hamilton Inc., Transportation Consulting Div.; and Wendell A. Cook, Dept. of Trans- portation, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The quality and cost of auto repairs have been a major source of consumer complaints for many years. However, efforts to improve the automotive repair process have been hindered by lack of reliable quantitative data on factors thought to be significant contributors to consumer complaints. This paper presents quantitative data from three recent national surveys, including: (1) a personal interview survey of 1,512 automotive service industry owner/op- erators; (2) a personal interview survey of 591 mechanics employed by those owner/ operators; and (3) a telephone survey of 2,434 recent customers of those service facilities. The paper presents data on repair industry equipment, procedures, practices, and reference materials, as well as mechanic skills, experience, and compensation. Rela- tionships between customer assessment of the repair process and characteristics of the repair facility are also examined. 1981 SAE Transactions 810057. Improvement of Spark Ignition Knock Detector Performance by Learning Control. Daisaku Sawada, Toyoto Motor Co., Ltd. (Japan); and Takashi Shigematsu, Toyota Motor Co., Ltd. (Japan). The improvement of the system response and the stability of the Knock Control System (KCS) by using Learning Control is discussed. The learning control keeps the feedback results in the computer memory and changes the feedback gain ac- cording to the data in the memory. An application method of the learning control to KCS is studied. Improvement of the learning control by adding analogy and extinct functions are explained. The new KCS with learning control is realized by a 16 28</page><page sequence="10">810058-810064 bit micro-computer, and the test results of the new KCS on 1.8/ vehicle are also described. 1 981 SA E Transactions 810058. Optimal Closed-Loop Spark Control of an Au- tomotive Engine. Itshak Glaser and J. David Powell, Stanford Univ., Stanford, CA. This work concerns the application of optimization theory to develop control laws for use in closed-loop control strategies to minimize the effect of environmental changes, manufacturing tolerances, and time degradation. The paper describes the acquisition of engine mapping data for a 2.3L, 4 cylinder engine, the use of the data to develop analytical functions describing the fuel con- sumption and emissions, and the use of the functions in an optimization procedure to arrive at control strategies and driving cycle predictions of fuel consumption and emis- sions. The optimum schedules were then used to deter- mine a closed-loop spark control strategy which yielded a 2% improvement in fuel economy over the open-loop control when the relative humidity was 75% at 90°F. 810059. Electronic Spark Control Systems. Part 1: Micro- computer-Controlled Ignition System. Part II: Bosch Knock Control. G. Hönig, H. Decker and S. Rohde, Robert Bosch GmbH (Germany). In the first part of the paper, the advantages of a computerized spark advance control system for spark ignition engines are discussed. Such an ignition system with its components is described in detail. In the second part, a new BOSCH KNOCK CONTROL SYSTEM is presented. The difficulties in detecting high speed knock are shown. Design and function of the BOSCH KNOCK CONTROL SYSTEM are described. Dynamometer and road test results are presented. 810060. A Turbocharged Engine with Microprocessor Controlled Boost Pressure. J. E. Rydqvist, L. Sandberg and R. Wallin, Volvo Car Corp. A prototype boost pressure control system, utilizing a microprocessor to govern the wastegate settings, has been developed and tested on a turbocharged petrol engine with intercooler. The Volvo Computer Controlled Turbo (VCCT)-system allows optimum boost pressure settings for varied operating conditions. A knock detecting system retards ignition and lowers boost simultaneously, minimizing torque loss with no increase of exhaust gas temperature. For high perform- ance turbo engines this strategy is important, since at continuous high power operation no increase in thermal loading (with risk for degraded durability), can be accepted. Vehicle tests show significant improvements in per- formance and fuel economy. 1981 SA E Transactions 810061. New State-of-the-Art in Engine Controls. J. W. Hoard and R. D. Berry, Advanced Engine Engineering Office, Ford Motor Co. Engine control systems are changing rapidly under the combined pressures of emission, fuel economy, and marketing requirements. As electronic controls become more readily available and less expensive, new possibilities arise in total vehicle control system choices. An exper- imental electronic engine control system is described which achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and speed of response. Vehicle data are presented which demonstrate the vehicle impact of such a control system. 1981 SA E Transactions 810062. Maximizing Efficiency of Fuel Production and Utilization. Don E. Koehler and W. F. Marshall, U.S. Dept. of Energy, Bartlesville Energy Tech- nology Center. An experimental study was undertaken to determine the influence of fuel octane quality, engine compression ratio, and ignition timing adjustment on fuel utilization effi- ciency. This information, combined with data on refinery energy consumption for producing fuel of various octane qualities, can be used to estimate the potential for improvement in miles traveled per barrel of crude oil consumed. The vehicle selected for this investigation incorporated a closed-loop, air/fuel ratio control system using an oxygen sensor and a three-way catalyst. Ignition timing was adjusted for minimum fuel consumption at each of three compression ratios with the engine operating on fuels of various octane quality. An ignition timing retard system was used for those combinations of compression ratio and fuel quality which precluded use of best ignition timing. Results indicate that a 13% improvement in miles traveled per barrel of crude oil consumed is possible. 810063. Instrumented Approaches to Ride Comfort from the Perspective of Tire Engineers. S. A. Lipp- mann and K. L. Oblizajek, Uniroyal Tire Co. The paper has two objectives: (1) to describe the manner in which tires are involved in the "torsional nibble" disturbance, an occasional problem in vehicle devel- opment, and (2) to illustrate a generally applicable approach for diagnosing the relationships between tire properties and subjective disturbances. 810064. Lateral Maneuvers of Passenger Vehicles - Sub- jective Impressions versus Dynamic Measure- ments and the Role of the Tire. K. L. Oblizajek and S. A. Lippmann, Uniroyal Tire Co. Engineers who are developing new models of vehicles invest considerable effort in adjusting the steering char- acteristics to conform with specific commercial objectives. In this process, tires have to be redesigned so that their 29</page><page sequence="11">810065-810070 steering properties match the requirements imposed by the physical nature of the vehicle and the subjective reactions of test drivers. One method for the identification of the underlying physical system, and the determination of the required tire properties proceeds by the general approach outlined in the paper. 810065. The Effect of Stabilizer Ply Geometry on Rolling Resistance and Cornering Force Properties. Mar- tin A. Yuijevich, Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. Many tire construction parameters influence rolling resistance and cornering force properties. This paper concentrates on the influence of the stabilizer ply geometry of radial passenger car tires. Using a designed experiment, the construction pa- rameters studied were: the width of the stabilizer plies relative to the tread arc width, the crown angle of the stabilizer plies and the amount of rubber gauge above and below the stabilizer ply edges. Results indicate a strong relationship exists between these construction parameters and rolling resistance and cornering force properties. 1981 SAE Transactions 810066. The Effect of Tire Aging on Force and Moment Properties of Radial Tires. Marion G. Pottinger and Kenneth D. Marshall, B. F. Goodrich, Co. The increase of rubber stiffness with age causes radial tire cornering stiffness to significantly increase during ware- house (shelf) aging. The increase in cornering properties is linear with the logarithm of time and dependent on storage temperature. Five different brands of radial tires studied age in a very similar manner, exhibiting the apparent effect of two different aging mechanisms. A limited experiment indicated an approximate balance of aging and break-in effects on radial tire cornering properties in normal service. The in-service results imply that neither force and moment tests nor vehicle handling tests should be preceded by break-in or scrub-in proce- dures if the desire is to predict in-service behavior. 1981 SAE Transactions 810067. Tread Design Effect on Winter Traction. Thomas R. King and Frank E. Matyja, General Tire and Rubber Co. A variety of tread design features were hand carved into blank tread poly/steel radial passenger tires for winter traction testing. Included were variations in siping amount, depth, thickness, and angle as well as variations in the size and shape of tread elements. Testing involved drive traction and stopping distance testing on ice, packed snow, and soft snow. Increases in winter traction were noted with a number of test features that could be applied to tires now under development. 810068. A Canadian Survey of Automobile Tire Pressures, Tire Failures, and Tire Maintenance Practices. Dennis A. Attwood and Raymond D. Williams, Road and Motor Vehicle, Traffic Safety Branch, Transport Canada. The survey described herein was performed by Transport Canada in 1978 to obtain a nationally representative sample of tire pressures, to record driver maintenance habits, and to obtain cursory information on tire failures. Over 70 percent of the tires examined in the survey were underinflated, and as many as 37 percent were underinflated by 4.0 pounds per square inch (psi) or more. In addition, almost 90 percent of the vehicles examined had at least one tire that was underinflated, and almost 60 percent of the vehicles had at least one tire that was underinflated by 4.0 psi or more. Results are discussed in terms of driver maintenance practices and driver characteristics. 810069. The Effects of Tire Inflation Pressure on Pas- senger Car Fuel Consumption. Bruce C. Grugett, Martin E. Reineman and Glenn D. Thompson, United States Environmental Protection Agen- cy. Measurements of passenger car fuel consumption at different tire inflation pressures were recently conducted. These measurements were obtained from a vehicle operated on a test track using transient driving cycles and over a range of ambient conditions. The observed changes in fuel consumption, 0.33 percent/psi, should therefore be representative of actual driving conditions. Subsequently, tire inflation data from 2000 vehicles in six cities were analyzed to determine the extent of passenger car tire underinflation. These data sources were then combined to estimate the nationwide excess fuel consumption, about 600 million gallons per year, due to tire underinflation. 810070. Cummius-TARADCOM Adiabatic Turbocom- pound Engine Program. Roy Kamo, Cummins Engine Co.; and Walter Bryzik, U.S. Army TARADCOM. This paper describes the progress on the Cummins- TARADCOM adiabatic turbocompound diesel engine development program. An adiabatic diesel engine system adaptable to the use of high performance ceramincs which hopefully will enable higher operating temperatures, reduced heat loss, and turbocharged exhaust energy recovery is presented. The engine operating environments as well as the thermal and mechanical loadings of the critical engine components are covered. Design criteria are presented and techniques leading to its fulfillment are shown. The present shortcomings of the high performance ceramic design in terms of meeting reliability and insulation targets are discussed, and the needs for composite designs are shown. A ceramic design meth- odology for an insulated engine component is described and some of the test results are shown. Other possible future improvements such as the minimum friction- 30</page><page sequence="12">810071-810076 unlubricated engine through the use of ceramics are also described. 1981 SA E Transactions 810071. Oil-less Engine Design. Vahan V. Basmajian, Megatech Corp. An operative internal combustion engine is transparent for demonstration of internal combustion engine prin- ciples. A transparent cylinder houses a noncontacting piston, a combustion chamber being sealed by means such as protruding annular teflon rings seated in an annular groove of the piston or a flexible flap formed integrally with the piston which is pressed firmly to the internal surface of the cylinder wall by pressure developed within the combustion chamber during operation of the engine. Other portions of the engine are transparent to enable their contained parts to be observed during operation. The engine also has an enlarged flywheel to permit operation of the engine at low, observable speeds. The engine burns low carbon fuels such as alcohol to keep the cylinder walls clean. The engine is designed with various sizes of piston caps to change the compression ratio. It utilizes a timing lever which varies the ignition timing from -20° to +20°. Study of flame propagation, combustion, and emissions are enhanced by the glass cylinder which is air cooled for optical reasons. This oil-less engine is coupled to an electric dyna- mometer for measurements of torque, engine rpm, cylinder pressure, manifold pressure, and cylinder head temperature. The engine is patented (U.S. Pat. No. 3,698,370 and Re-issue No. 30,253). 810072. Spark-Assisted Diesel for Multifuel Capability. Kunihiko Komiyama and Ichiro Hashimoto, Engine Technical Center, Komatsu Ltd. (Japan). In order to evaluate the feasibility of spark-assisted diesel engine concept for multifuel capability in which forced spark can assist ignition in case of no self-ignition, a spark plug was adapted in the pre-combustion chamber of a conventional diesel engine. Performance tests and emis- sion tests on the engine were carried out with methanol, ethanol, gasoline and diesel fuel. And also injection and combustion characteristics with the fuels were measured for the investigation of difference with each fuels. The test results show that this spark-assisted diesel has multifuel capability and it is concluded that this type of engine has enough potential for the future and alternate low cetane number fuel use and the performance is comparable to a conventional diesel engine with various fuels. 1981 SA E Transactions 810073. Vehicle Testing of Cummins T urbocompound Diesel Engine. Michael C. Brands, John R. Werner and John L. Hoehne, Cummins Engine Co., Inc.; and Saunders Kramer, Dept. of Energy. Two turbocompound diesel engines were assembled and dynamometer tested in preparation for vehicle tests. Both engines met the 1980 California gaseous emission re- quirement and achieved a minimum BSFC of .313 lb/bhp-hr and a BSFC at rated conditions of .323 lb/bhp-hr. These engines were then installed in Class VIII heavy-duty vehicles to determine the fuel consumption and performance characteristics. Fuel consumption test- ing showed a 14.8% improvement for the turbocompound engine in comparison to a production NTC-400 used as a baseline. The turbocompound engine also achieved lower noise levels, improved driveability, improved gradeability, and moderately increased engine retardation. The second turbocompound engine was placed in commercial service and accumulated 50,000 miles on a cross-country route without malfunction. Tank mileage revealed a 15.92% improvement over a production NTCC-400 which was operating on the same route. A number of component modifications were incor- porated into the turbocompound engine which resulted in fuel consumption reductions which exceeded the expected benefit from turbocompounding alone. Previous labo- ratory testing showed a 6% reduction in fuel consumption for a turbocompound engine over an equivalent NH engine operating along the torque curve. Using these test results, the incremental fuel consumption improvement strictly due to the turbocompounding alone was estimated at 4.2% to 5.3% depending upon the terrain or mission load factor. 1981 SA E Transactions 810075. Tungsten Oxide Electrochromic Display. Jeffrey B. Sampsell, Texas Instruments Inc., Dallas, TX. We have constructed tungsten oxide (W03) electro- chromic displays (ECDs) with the display characters having a seven segment format. The displays are elec- trochemically symmetric with both the counter electrode and display electrodes composed of W03. The W03 was deposited using a variable geometry angle evaporation technique to obtain highly porous electrodes. Several lithium salts in various organic electrolytes have been used with the predominant number of displays filled with lithium hexafluoroarsenate (LiAsF6) dissolved in acetone. Either Zr02 felt or sintered AL203 has been used as a porous, white background material to the display seg- ments. Response times of the displays vary with electrode size from approximately 200 ms for 4 mm digits to approximately 1 s for 25 mm digits. The displays exhibit cycle lifetimes in excess of 106 cycles. 1981 SA E Transactions 810076. Electroluminescent Instrumentation. B. Shep- herd, Smiths Industries Ltd., Vehicle Instru- mentation Div. (London/England). A pilot plant facility has now been established to build DC electroluminescent panels. A new product is being 31</page><page sequence="13">810077-810085 made which combines analogue and digital readouts on one panel. Any panel up to 6" X 18" can be made due to the process simplicity which consists largely of screen printing techniques. The pilot product is 2" X 1" and displays are made six at a time. A combination of custom designed I.C.'s and microprocessor drive can be used to provide full, flexible solid state instrumentation. 810077. Super High Brightness FIPS under Direct Bat- tery Drive. Wayne D. Stewart, NEC Electron, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA; Yukitoshi Yoshida, Nip- pon Electric Co., Ltd. (Kanagawa, Japan); and Togo Miyazaki, Nippon Electric Kagoshima Ltd. (Kagoshima, Japan). This paper describes the brightness improvement of fluorescent indicator panel (FIP) for automotive appli- cation. The brightness improvement factors are analyzed and discussed about the possibility to get high brightness under direct car battery drive. Using with this approach, a newly developed car clock FIP is described. Its brightness is 1100 ft.L at 12 V operation while old FIP has brightness of 400 ft.L. Evaluation data shows this new bright FIP has the same quality level as one of currently used automotive FIP. This also shows the possibility of the FIP operation under TTL level for common usage. 810078. Planar Vacuum Fluorescent Displays. Kiyoshi Morimoto, Futaba Corp. In the last several years, the application of electronic devices to the automobile has grown exponentially. Environmental concerns and fuel costs have created the need which has been fulfilled by the rapid advance of LSI semi-conductor technology. LSI microcomputers are being considered for almost all control functions within the automobile. For those applications requiring visual display, the digital information inherent in the micro- computer system is most compatible with the electronic type displays. Today, the display technologies in practical use are Planar Vacuum Fluorescent, Light Emitting Diode, Liquid Crystal and Gas Discharge. The Planar VFD has achieved the greatest acceptance for automotive applications. This paper will describe the Planar VFD, explain its features and benefits, and compare them with other display technologies. 810081. Exhaust Emission Patterns from Two Light-Duty Diesel Automobiles. Peter A. Gabele, Frank M. Black, Foy G. King, Jr., Roy B. Zweidinger and Rex A. Brittain, Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, NC. Particulate and gaseous emissions from two light-duty diesel automobiles were examined over six operating cycles. Particulate characterizations included mass emis- sion rate, soluble organic content, and trace element content determinations. The particulate matter was sampled using both a total filtration system having 20 X 20 inch filters and a conventional probe arrange- ment employing 47 mm filters. Bioassay of selected diesel particulate extract was carried out using the Ames test procedure. Gaseous characterization included real-time analysis of regulated exhaust emissions. A special oper- ating schedule was developed for each test car using the real time system to modally determine the effect of acceleration rate on regulated gaseous emissions. 810082. Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons in the Exhaust of Gasoline and Diesel Vehicles. J. Kraft and K.-H. Lies, Volkswagenwerk AG (Germany). The purpose was to study the precision and the separation efficiency of the analytical methods which are currently discussed for the sampling and the analysis of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) in the exhaust of auto- mobiles. The sampling of the PAH is done by condensing the total exhaust gas flow. The PAH collected are concentrated by known liquid-liquid extractions, purified by silica gel and separated into fractions using Sephadex. Two quantitative analytical methods are used, the advanced technique of glass capillary gas chromatography and thin-layer chromatography coupled with in situ fluorescence spectrometry. The results of these chromo- tographic methods correlate within an error of 10% for both gasoline and diesel exhaust samples. The PAH contents in the exhaust gas of several diesel and gasoline cars are compared for different driving cycles. The corresponding PAH mass emissions from diesel and gasoline cars are of the same order of magnitude. 1981 SAE Transactions 810083. Chemical Characterization of Particulates from Diesel-Powered Passenger Cars. A. Postulka and K.-H. Lies, Volkswagenwerk AG (Germany). Particulate emissions from VW and Audi diesel vehicles ranging from 230 to 1000 mg/mi were analysed by different analytical techniques. The results from the classical elemental analysis shows that the particulate matter consists of up to 90% carbon. For the determi- nation of metals the X-ray fluorescence method was used, but only traces were found. Methods for the measurement of particle bound organics was based on organic extrac- tion and thermogravimetry. Results so far obtained indicate an organic fraction between 20 and 70%. Sulfates were also determined in a portion of 2 to 4% using the BCA method. 1981 SAE Transactions 810085. The Application of a Three Way Conversion Catalyst System to a Heavy-Duty Gasoline Engine. James G. Hansel, Engelhard Industries Division, Engelhard Minerals and Chemicals Corporation, Menlo Park, N.J.; Timothy P. Cox and Thomas J. Nugent, Environmental Protec- 32</page><page sequence="14">810086-810092 tion Agency, Ann Arbor, Michigan. A production heavy-duty (truck) gasoline engine was equipped with both TWC single-bed and TWC dual-bed catalysts as well as a closed-loop control, stoichiometric air/fuel ratio carburetor system. The exhaust HC, CO and NOx emissions were measured on the EPA heavy-duty transient test cycle (cold start) applicable for 1984 engines. Catalyst conversion efficiencies for HC, CO and NOx of 76%, 94% and 77% were achieved with the dual-bed system. Corresponding catalyst conversion efficiencies for the TWC single-bed catalyst system were 64%, 56% and 79%. At low mileage, HC/CO/NOx emissions with the dual-bed system and EGR were 0.68/3.60/0.74 gm/BHP- hr which were well below the 1984-85 Federal limits of 1.3/15.5/1.7 gm/BHP-hr. No attempt was made to optimize the various components of the total system in this program. A loss of approximately 3% in maximum horsepower was observed relative to the standard pro- duction engine. Fuel economy was unaffected. Several undesirable design characteristics of the air/fuel mixture preparation and particularly mixture distribution for this engine were identified and suggestions are made to modify the air/fuel mixing and manifold to achieve the degree of control now attained in current light-duty (passenger car) engines. 1981 SA E Transactions 810086. Implications of Precious Metal Catalysts with Leaded Fuels. J. E. White and C. E. Zakrajsek, Research and Engineering Staff, Ford Motor Co. The potential for catalysts to operate with leaded fuel was evaluated by screening catalysts under a variety of steady state and cyclic conditions with 0.4 g/1 leaded fuel. The influence of precious metal loading, formulation and the level of inlet 02 was also evaluated. Pure Pt was superior to catalysts containing Pt and Pd. Cyclic aging provided much better catalyst performance retention than steady state exposure. The scavenging effect of HCl and HBr, which accomplishes deposit removal in the combustion chamber, may also operate on the catalyst where cyclic operation assures a proper balance of temperature above and below 550°C. 1981 SA E Transactions 810087. The Automotive Stirling Engine - Prime Mover for a Nonresidential Heat Pump. Bruce Gold- water, Stirling Engine Systems Div., Mechanical Technology Inc. This paper considers the state of technical progress of the Stirling engine being developed under a DOE funded program for the automotive application, and describes the translation of this technology to a product opportunity in nonresidential heat-activated heat pumps. A rationale defining the logic for such an Automotive Stirling Engine Derivative Heat Pump (ASEDHP) product, the market level, and the system approach will be briefly discussed. 810088. Variable Stroke Power Control for Stirling Engines. B. Ziph and R. J. Meijer, Stirling Technology, Inc., Ann Arbor, MI. Variable stroke power control for Stirling engines offers a number of advantages among which are attractive torque characteristics, high part-load efficiency, the ability to avoid the reciprocating rod seals, simplicity and com- pactness. This paper describes the simplest way to implement the variable stroke power control, namely the variable swashplate activated by a hydraulic stroke converter. The hardware comprising the system, the principle of opera- tion and the various advantages are described herein. 810089. The Power Control System for the Ford-Philips Stirling Engine. J. E. Fenton and D. Kosacheff, Research Staff, Ford Motor Co., Dearborn, MI. A reliable power control system was developed for the Stirling engine. This control system provides a stable engine speed and an engine speed-accelerator pedal position relationship similar to a spark ignition engine allowing a driver to operate a Stirling-powered vehicle in a conventional manner. 810090. Van Crashworthiness and Aggressivity Study. Sol Davis, Dynamic Science, Inc.; and Steve Peirce, National Highway Traffic Safety Administra- tion. This paper presents the results of a series of van crash tests which were conducted by Dynamic Science, Inc. under contract to the National Highway Traffic Safety Admin- istration (NHTSA). Six van tests were conducted against a unique load-measuring barrier to study the crashworthi- ness and aggressivity of two typical van models at speeds of 15, 25, and 30 mph. Two additional tests were conducted between each of the two van models and a typical fullsize passenger car. The results of these tests are being used by NHTSA to support extension of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 208 to vans, and to provide initial information for the future FMVSS 400 series standards. The views and opinions presented in this paper are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the official view of the U.S. Department of Transportation, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. 1981 SAE Transactions 810092. Derivation and Application of Restraint Survival Distance in Motor Vehicle Collisions. Thomas F. MacLaughlin, Vehicle Research and Test Cen- ter, National Higway Traffic Safety Adminis- tration, U. S. Department of Transportation, East Liberty, OH. Restraint Survival Distance (RSD), a quantity used for determining potential occupant survival in a motor vehicle collision, is derived. The RSD depends upon the vehicle crash response, available occupant stroking distance 33</page><page sequence="15">810093-810100 (taking compartment intrusion into account) and as- sumptions regarding ideal restraint system performance. RSD calculations were performed for 17 passenger cars which were subjected to 30 mph barrier crash tests. The RSD values were compared with measured dummy responses. Similarities and differences between actual crashsurvivability levels achieved with existing restraint systems and potential crashsurvivability levels achievable with ideal restraint system characteristics were explored. 810093. Experimental Investigation of Crash Barriers for Measuring Vehicle Aggressiveness - Fixed Rigid Barrier Initial Results. Roger A. Saul and Thomas F. MacLaughlin, Vehicle Research and Test Center, East Liberty, OH, National High- way Traffic Safety Administration, U.S. De- partment of Transportation; Carl L. Ragland, Jr., Office of Passenger Vehicle Research, Wash- ington, DC, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, U.S. Department of Transpor- tation; and Daniel Cohen, Office of Vehicle Safety Standards, Washington, DC, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, U.S. Department of Transportation. This paper presents the initial results of a crash test program designed to evaluate the ability of three different barriers to measure vehicle aggressiveness. The barriers included in the study are the fixed rigid (FRB), load cell fixed (LCFB) and moving deformable (MDB). Previous crash tests and analytical studies conducted to determine causes of aggressiveness and ways of measuring aggres- siveness are reviewed. In this paper, full frontal car-to-car and FRB crash test results of an aggressive and a non-aggressive car are presented and compared. 810094. Digital Experimental Techniques Applied to Low Frequency Shake Phenomena. J. M. O'Keeffe and W. G. Sutcliffe, SDRC-Engineering Services (UK/Scan), Ltd.; I. Scheelke and U. Proepper, Adam Opel A. G. Adam Opel have been using digital experimental tech- niques to investigate the dynamic behaviour of their vehicles. The desire to combine experimental and ana- lytical data in a compatible form led to a joint project with SDRC. A mutually agreed test programme applied these techniques to provide design insight into low frequency shake phenomena. Operating tests defined the forces responsible for low frequency shake using narrow band spectra and order tracking techniques. Total deformation patterns were measured under operating conditions to determine the controlling elements participating in the vibration per- ceived at the steering wheel. Modal testing of the vehicle provided a mathematical model of the car over the frequency range 10-50 Hz. This model predicted the effect of modifications to the vehicle before they were implemented. The change in steering column response was monitored to assess the effect of these changes. Analytical predictions were confirmed by testing the modified vehicle. 810098. Window System Design Using Computer Anal- ysis. Herbert J. Keller, Chrysler Corp. Soon after the styling door surface, glass drop, and belt height are determined, the placement of window system components is critical in effecting a smooth operating window system with low effort. For single arm - single post window systems, a computer analysis technique has been developed to position the post and regulator in the most optimum location. The computer program used displays results through the use of computer graphics. This graphic output allows instantaneous evaluation of how variations in geometry effect the window system operation. 1981 SA E Transactions 810099. Dent Resistance of Surface Panel and Slam Area. Hikmat F. Mahmood, Research Staff, Ford Motor Co., Dearborn, MI. In the interest of improved fuel economy, minimum weight design of the car structure has become a main concern for automotive engineers. In the outer surface panel, reducing the weight means reducing the panel thickness or using alternative materials. These changes will affect the dent resistance of the panel. In this study, the correlation between panel geometry, material prop- erties and dent resistance is investigated. The approach is based on the relationship between the stiffness of a shell panel and the energy required to form visible dent. Mathematical formulation and design methods are pre- sented that relate dent resistance to the design parameters of the various panels. The slam area of several deck lids and life gates are investigated and a dent resistance requirement established. It is recommended that the outer surface panel (slam area) be analyzed early in the design process to determine its dent resistance, then the geometry of the panel can be improved or different material can be recommended to avoid adding slam reinforcement or increasing the thickness of the panel to prevent such a dent. 810100. Development of Optical Measuring Device for Interior Dimensions of Automobiles. Satoshi Sugiyama and Nobuaki Takahashi, Toyota Central Research &amp; Development Labs., Inc. The developed measuring device is an optical noncon- tacting system which permits rapid measurement of complicated interior dimensions based on the principle of triangulation. A laser beam is projected from a small head of the device to various points to be measured and the reflected light is automatically searched by use of a photodetector to establish polar coordinates. The polar 34</page><page sequence="16">810101-810109 coordinate values are then converted into rectangular coordinate ones with a microcomputer, and can be represented on a panel and also punched out on a teletypewriter. 1981 SAE Transactions 810101. A Consideration of Vehicle's Door Shutting Performance. Y. Nagayama and R. Fujihara, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. Many papers have mentioned, in passing, a phenomena that is known as "airtightness", which is one factor that hinders automobile doors from closing. It also causes the eardrums of any passengers in the vehicle to be tempo- rarily pressurized when the door is closed. However, a few documents have considered this phenomena in detail. In this paper, we investigate the magnitude of "airtightness" as it affects ear pressure and examine its relationship to such factors as the volume of the passenger compartment, door's opening area and its inertial mo- ment. Finally, we utilized estimation methods to predict its influence on the force required to close the door and the amount of the resultant air draft. 1981 SA E Transactions 810102. The Lever Analogy: A New Tool in Transmission Analysis. Howard L. Benford and Maurice B. Leising, Chrysler Corp. A new tool for analyzing transmissions that use planetary gearsets is presented. With this tool, entire transmissions are usually represented by a single lever, and the calculation of most characteristics is as simple as summing moments of a lever. A miniature cookbook of levers for various planetary arrangements is included which can be helpful in selecting a planetary to achieve the desired objectives of a user. 1981 SA E Transactions 810103. Axial Force and Efficiency Tests of Fixed Center Variable Speed Belt Drive. David J. Bents, NASA Lewis Research Center. Report describes experiments which investigated inter- actions of the axial "sheave spreading" forces with centerline force and torque in a fixed center compound variable speed rubber belt drive at different speed ratios, speeds, and loads. An experimental rig, geometrically similar to a belt drive CVT, was designed and built, and operated at selected speed ratios, power levels, and total tension. The data provide a preliminary determination of variable speed belt CVT axial force control requirements and indicate high transmission efficiencies over a wide range of conditions when the axial forces are moderated to keep the traction coefficient within a certain range. 1981 SA E Transactions 810104. A Fully Automatic Vehicle Transmission Using a Layshaft Type Gearbox. Harry Webster, Au- tomotive Products Ltd. The paper first discusses the reasons and need for having very efficient fully automatic transmissions for small cars. The high losses of conventional automatic gearboxes when compared to manual layshaft gearboxes leads to the automation of a manual box using two friction clutches instead of the usual single friction clutch thus giving the benefits of the high efficiency of a manual box and an ability to make the units on plant already available at most vehicle manufacturers. Results of initial development work on prototypes are given in the paper and a description of the type of work proposed for the future is outlined. 810105. Measuring Method of Hypoid Gear Tooth Pro- files. Shy ogo Kato and Toshiaki Akamatsu, Toyota Motor Co., Ltd. (Japan). In this study we have developed a new measuring method of the hypoid gear tooth profiles manufactured by Gleason's gear cutting machines. Based on analysis of the tooth profiles of hypoid gears, the angular position of the ideal gears and the position of the measuring probe contacting the tooth surface at the measuring location are computed first. Actual tooth surface measurements are made with a three-coordinate measuring machine to detect deviation of the actual position of the probe from the ideal position and the deviation of the tooth surface is then evaluated. The method gives us not only the profile of a tooth section but also the profile on the whole tooth surface. Some experimental results have proved that the measuring method is useful. 1981 SAE Transactions 810107. Optimization of a Continuously Variable Trans- mission with Emission Constraints. R. R. Radtke, L. E. Unnewehr and R. J. Freedman, Scientific Research Lab., Ford Motor Co. An optimization technique has been developed which can be used to compute the optimal control strategy for an engine/CVT configuration subject to emission constraints. (CVT stands for Continuously Variable Transmission). The engine/CVT system is represented as a function of the four independent variables: spark advance, air/fuel ratio, exhaust gas recirculation percentage, and CVT gear ratio. The Generalized Lagrange Multiplier Technique is used to optimize these variables at a set of drive shaft torque/speed points which represent operation of the vehicle over a drive cycle. Results are presented for idealized CVT's. 1 981 SAE Transactions 810109. Capacity Planning and Productivity - A Tutorial. Richard C.

Assessment of Diesel Particulate Control - Direct and Catalytic Oxidation. M. J. Murphy, L. J. Hillenbrand and D. A. Trayser, Battelle, Co- lumbus Laboratories, Columbus, OH; and J. H. Wasser, Industrial Environmental Research Laboratory, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, NC. The technology for disposal of diesel particulate by oxidation is discussed. Properties of typical diesel partic- ulate are given, including the size (on the order of 0.1 /im diameter) and the presence of a portion extractable with an organic solvent. Available reaction rate data are used to derive particle lifetimes at various temperatures; these exceed likely exhaust system residence times. The use of catalysts to increase oxidation rates and lower ignition temperatures is discussed. Small amounts of many metals increase the rate of oxidation and lower the ignition temperature. Chemical reactor theory is used to derive ignition and operational characteristics of trap/oxidizers. Special note is taken of the tendency of these devices to go rapidly from a cold unignited state to an ignited state close to the adiabatic flame temperature of the fuel. Design techniques to ameliorate undesirable temperature excursions are presented. 810113. Mathematical Modeling of Fibrous Filters for Diesel Particulates - Theory and Experiment. Se H. Oh, J. Scott MacDonald, Gerald L. Vaneman and L. Louis Hegedus, General Motors Re- search Labs. A mathematical model has been developed to describe the initial performance of fibrous filters for diesel exhaust particulates. In addition to the basic mechanism of particle deposition on fibers, the size distributions of both diesel particulates and fibers were incorporated into the model in order to account for the polydispersity of particles and fibers encountered in realistic diesel partic- ulate filters. Filtration experiments with a single-cylinder diesel engine were conducted to test the validity of the model, and the calculated filter efficiencies agreed very well with the experimental data. 1981 SAE Transactions 810114. Cellular Ceramic Diesel Particulate Filter. John S. Howitt and Max R. Montierth, Corning Glass Works. An innovative design of ceramic filter for diesel engine exhaust particulate matter is described. It is a cellular ceramic honeycomb with porous walls which act as the filter medium. Test results relating the effects of wall thickness, cell density, porosity, and filter volume on collection efficiency, pressure drop and filter capacity are described. Regeneration of the filter by ignition of the accu- mulated soot has been accomplished with conclusions drawn about the influence of exhaust temperature, oxygen content, and the effect of the filter design. 1981 SAE Transactions 810118. Diesel Particulate Trap Regeneration Tech- niques. W. R. Wade, J. E. White and J. J. Florek, Engineering and Research Staff, Ford Motor Co. Diesel engine particulates collected on a trap cause the exhaust back pressure to increase and adversely affect fuel economy and vehicle performance. Therefore, a trap must be periodically regenerated by oxidizing the collected particulates. Several techniques for regenerating a diesel particulate trap are discussed. Regeneration was achieved with high speed and high load engine operation. Lead, added to the diesel fuel, acted as a catalyst and reduced the ignition temperature of particulates collected on a trap by about 300° F. Throttling the intake air flow increased exhaust temperature to facilitate regeneration at moderate vehicle speeds. An externally fueled burner provided regeneration over the widest range of engine operating conditions, including idle. 1981 SAE Transactions 810120. Techniques and Limitations for Cold Roll Form- ing High Strength Steel Bumper Components. J. W. Ferry, Van Huffęl Tube Corp. The cold roll forming process has been utilized to manufacture automotive bumpers from high strength steels. Blending the physical properties of these steels with the design specifications of the bumpers required some departure from conventional roll forming technique. A successful technique is described, with emphasis on preferred design configurations and material formability parameters. 1981 SAE Transactions 36</page><page sequence="18">810121-810132 810121. The Evolution of High Performance Amine- Extended RIM Systems. Ronald P. Taylor and Barry A. Phillips, Polyurethane Div., Mobay Chemical Corp., Pittsburgh, PA. Limitations of conventional glycol-extended RIM systems offer the opportunity for improvements in processing latitude. Several shortcomings have been eliminated with the introduction of amine-extended RIM materials. However, the initial amine systems required high through- put machinery to mold large, thin cross-section parts. An improved amine-extended RIM material has therefore been introduced, which maintains the processing advan- tages of the initial systems, but provides significantly better flowability. 810122. Aluminum Sheet Bumpers. R. L. Rolf, R. W. Baker, W. King and R. P. Kole, Alcoa Technical Center, Aluminum Co. of America. Aluminum alloy 7029 anodized sheet bumpers are cur- rently being adopted by the automobile manufacturers because they are the most weight efficient and the easiest to form of all aluminum bumpers. The relative weight of aluminum bumpers is presented along with additional recent information on aluminum sheet bumpers. Such topics as alloy selection, design considerations, corrosion, forming and finishing are discussed. 1981 SAE Transactions 810125. Effect of Notch, Corrosion and Stress Ratio on the Constant and Variable Amplitude Fatigue Behavior of Two Materials. P. R. Bhowal, Materials Engineering Dept., Rockwell Inter- national, Automotive Operations. The fatigue response of 7075-T73 aluminum alloy (cy- clically hardening) and SAE 1045 (mod.) steel (cyclically softening) was investigated in air and corrosive envi- ronments under constant amplitude and variable ampli- tude fatigue loadings. Variable amplitude tests showed that crack propagation life was important in notched specimens in air as well as in corrosive environment. In corrosive environment pits were found to act as initiation sites in the steel specimens. The effect of stress ratio, notches and environment on the fatigue life was treated through an effective stress, aeff = al~mmax(Atf)m. Here, 'm' is a material constant that depends on the environment. This relation was also examined to predict fatigue lives under loading with variable stress ratio and applied to fatigue results. 1981 SAE Transactions 810129. (SP-482) Review of Recent Activities and Trends in the Field of Automobile Materials. Ulrich W. Seiffert, Research and Development, Volks- wagenwerk AG (Wolfsburg/Fed. Rep. of Ger- many). Throughout 1979 and in 1980, a number of powerful energy-saving constraints began to make themselves felt. Those researchers and developers who deal with the problems of energy conservation in a wider context will be aware that progress, necessary as it is, can be attained only by optimizing a larger number of aspects. This paper discusses the way in which total energy consumption is affected by the use of alternative materials to reduce vehicle mass. 810130. (SP-482) Plastics in the Peugeot S.A. Group. J. J. Lanfranchini and G. Oberle, Peugeot Société Anonyme. The evolution of automobile vehicles over the past thirty years has been considerable, partly due to the major role played by plastics. This role is shown today by the variety of parts incorporated, 800 to 1000 per vehicle, and the weight of plastics represented. In the three trade marks of the Peugeot S. A. Group, namely, Peugeot, Citroen and Talbot, it is above 5% to the average total weight, i.e., 50 to 70 kgs, depending on the model. This growth is constantly increasing in new model vehicles. A brief account of recent applications and the approach taken on production run vehicles of the Peugeot S.A. Group preceeds an introduction of a lightened model developed specially in the framework of energy savings. This research vehicle (V.E.R.A.) shows the possible extension of plastics applications for the Group models in the 80's. 810131. (SP-482) Engineering Plastics in Modern Car Design.

The use of plastics makes the designer's work easier and contributes to weight reductions in the face of energy problems. The passenger compartment must not suffer because of drag problems. Plastics play a leading role but not an absolute one. They must progress step by step through quality improvement, especially as far as versatility, aesthetics, functionality, weight and costs are concerned. 810132.

Porsche, Aktienge- sellschaft (Stuttgart/West Germany). Since 1969, Porsche have been using PUR-RIM parts in their vehicles. Most of such parts belong to the outer body panelling which has to comply with high demands on styling, wear, and stability. With the latest models, such outer panels are painted in the same colour as the rest of the body. For the first time, a passenger car is equipped with PUR-RRIM front panel and front and rear fenders. These parts are outstandingly light, dimensionally stable at high temperatures, abrasion resistant, and insensitive to trifle damage. 37</page><page sequence="19">810133-810139 810133. (SP-482) Automatically Manufactured Tires by Liquid Injection Molding Test Results of Pas- senger Car Tires. John E. Morgan, POLYAIR Maschinenbau, Gesellschaft m.b.H. A new method of manufacturing pneumatic tires has been developed which shows considerable advantages over present bias and radial ply tires. The LIM(R) process of tire production by liquid injection molding of polyurethane raw materials into a closed mold has shown favourable results both technically and commercially. Development work has been progressing in four different areas - passenger car, truck, farm service, and off-the-road tires, but this paper will concentrate on test results generated on the passenger car tire programme. Wherever possible, control tires of either bias or radial ply type have been used for comparison purposes. 1981 SA E Transactions 810134. (SP-482) Review of Plastics Application Within BL Cars. D.

(SP-482) Application of PU for Steering Wheel Production. Karl Heinz Henkel, OTTO BOCK Kunststoff KG (West Germany). Until now car factories have been using 1. hard rubber - lacquered - 2. cellulose acetabutyrate 3. PVC - soft - 4. polypropylene for steering wheel coverings. In Europe during the last 15 years these materials have been replaced mainly by PUR integral skin foam so that now nearly 80 % of all steering wheels are produced out of polyurethane. In the United States light-colored steering wheel coverings are desired which could not be made with the conventional polyurethane systems on account of the required high light stability. For two years OTTO BOCK KG has been delivering the light stable polyurethane system W 301 for light-colored steering wheels which are used by VWoA. The purpose for this publication is to describe the reasons for the application of polyurethane integral skin foam for steering wheels which have lead in a relatively short time to such an important and large-scale appli- cation area being opened up. Already in 1949 we made moldings out of poly- urethane with metal inserts for orthopedics, and some years later we opened up application areas for poly- urethane, which are a matter of course nowadays, in cooperation with the German car producers. More than 12 years ago this systematically led to the fact that, after the development of the integral skin foam system, we realized its use as an ideal material for steering wheel coverings. 810139.

The most rapid attack usually did not occur within the crevice itself, but rather pitting was most severe on the surrounding metal. The crevice geometry did not promote significant galvanic cell effects between exposed and unexposed steel surfaces for the systems studied. 1981 SAE Transactions 810140. (SP-485) ULTRASMOOTH: A Two-Side Hot- Dip Galvanized Steel for Exposed Automotive Applications. H. F. Graff, T. R. Roberts and D. H. Orts, Armco Inc., Research &amp; Technology, Middletown, OH. Armco's process for finishing a continuous hot-dip zinc coating on steel to achieve a surface finish comparable to that of cold-rolled steel is described. The process excludes oxygen from the jet nozzle finishing operation by enclosing the jet nozzles and strip within a chamber and supplying high purity nitrogen as the wiping media to the jet nozzles. After leaving the coating chamber, the strip passes through a steam mist which minimizes the spangle formation. All grades of ULTRASMOOTH are temper rolled to meet the surface texture requirements charac- teristic of automotive Class 1 cold rolled steel. The coated surface is free of ripples, dross and oxide patches. Coating uniformity is excellent. The spot welding characteristics are the same as other continuously hot-dip galvanized steels. The consistency and uniform reactivity of the coating surface results in even deposition of chemical pretreatments and uniform paint adherence. Mechanical properties, formability and automotive applications for each ULTRASMOOTH base metal grade are described. 1 981 SAE Transactions 810141. (SP-485) The Cleaning and Preparation of Auto- body Steel for Improved Corrosion Resistance. J. J. Claus and R. P. Wenz, 3M Research Labo- ratories, BS &amp; CP Div., St. Paul, MN. This publication presents the results of recent research in our laboratories which shows that a 3-dimensional abrasive surface conditioning process has the ability to produce a uniformity and similarity between steels regardless of the mill source. This process also permits the removal of carbonaceous and other detrimental residue from the surface of all steels. It is further shown that this surface conditioning process promotes deposition of a chemical activator on the steel. The effect of the pretreatment of steels with the 3-dimensional abrasive and the chemical activator is to produce a uniformly dense growth of zinc phosphate crystals and to improve the corrosion resistance of the steels. 1981 SAE Transactions 810142. (SP-485) Hot-Dipped One-Side Galvanized Steel Sheet Produced by a New Stop-Off Coating Process. Minari Gotoh, Shunichi Harada and Nobuo Ohashi, Kawasaki Steel Corp. (Chi- ba/Japan). A new hot-dipped one-side galvanized steel suitable for automotive body material has been developed. This steel is produced in a continuous galvanizing line of the inline anneal type by using a special stop-off coating material comprised of water glass, H3B03, MgO and NaOH. The galvanized side of the product exhibits the same properties as regular two-side galvanized steel. The bare side of the product has good appearance and better corrosion resistance than conventional cold rolled steel. This is due to the cleaning action of the stop-off coating during annealing of the steel. 1981 SAE Transactions 810143.

Engines with Pre- mixed Gases. J. D. Dale, Dept. of Mechanical Engrg., Univ. of Alberta (Canada); and A. K. Oppenheim, Dept. of Mechanical Engrg., Univ. of California, Berkeley, CA. The development of lean charge, fast burn engines depends crucially on enhanced ignition, since one can obtain thereby proper means for increasing the rate of burn in mixtures characterized notoriously by low normal burning speeds. Enhanced ignition involves not only high energies and long duration of ignition, but also a wide dispersion of its sources, so that combustion is carried out 39</page><page sequence="21">810147-810150 at as many sites throughout the charge as possible. Upon this premise, various ignition systems for I.C. engines, operating with premixed charge, are reviewed. The systems are grouped within the following cate- gories: (1) high energy spark plugs; (2) plasma jet igniters; (3) photochemical, laser, and microwave ignition con- cepts; (4) torch cells; (5) divided chamber stratified charge engines; (6) flame jet igniters; (7) combustion jet ignition concepts; (8) EGR ignition system. The first three derive the power from electrical energy, the rest are powered by exothermic chemical reactions at a significantly lower, practically negligible, fuel consumption. The review emphasizes the concept of staging the processes of initiation and propagation of combustion. Relative positions of various ignition systems is expressed on the plane of relative energies (the ratio of energy consumed by the ignition system, or contained in a pre-chamber, to that of the compressed charge in the main chamber) and relative volumes (the ratio of the volume of the pre-chamber to that of the compressed charge). In principle, ignition systems for engines operating with premixed charge lie on the half-plane of relative energies below one, between 10-5 for standard spark plugs to IO-1 for divided chamber stratified charge engines, while their relative volumes extend from 0 for spark igniters to 0.2 for stratified charge engines. This suggests that proper compartmentization of the combustion pro- cess may lead to significant improvements in both pollution emissions from the cylinder and specific fuel consumption of I.C. engines. 1981 SA E Transactions 810147. Knock in Spark Ignition Engines. A. By, North- ern Research and Engineering Co.; B. Kem- piński and J. M. Rife, Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The knocking characteristics of several fuels are studied using a single cylinder test engine with variations in key engine operating parameters. Compression ratio, spark advance, fuel equivalence ratio, exhaust gas recirculation, engine speed, charge inlet pressure and charge inlet temperature were varied to yield a range of engine cylinder pressure-temperature histories as the base for this study. The fuels studied include three reference fuels containing isooctane and heptane with isooctane volume percents of 80, 90 and 100. Two wide boiling range gasolines were also studied. A number of empirical relationships for autoignition times of isooctane and heptane blends are employed in conjunction with the experimentally obtained pressure- temperature histories to predict onset of knock. The accuracies of the predictions with respect to the exper- imentally determined knock points are discussed. 810148. Measurements of Hydrocarbon Concentrations in the Exhaust Products from a Spherical Combus- tion Bomb. M. C. Sellnau, G. S. Springer and J. C. Keck, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA. Total hydrocarbon concentrations in the exhaust products from a constant volume heated spherical combustion bomb have been measured using a flame ionization detector. Results were obtained from methane-air and propane-air mixtures as a function of equivalence ratio, initial pressure, wall temperature and inert gas diluent fraction. Although an effort was made to eliminate all crevice volumes and wall contamination, the results indicate that at initial pressures greater than 1 atmosphere, most of the hydrocarbon came from a crevice which was not perfectly sealed. At initial pressures less than 1 atmosphere, it was possible to correct for this and obtain an estimate of the hydrocarbon mass in the quench layer. For an equivalence ratio of unity and no diluent, the hydrocarbon mass per unit wall area was &lt;0.02 jag/cm2. This is only 2% of the value predicted by a theoretical model used to correlate standoff distances on a flat flame burner and suggests virtually complete postquench oxi- dation of the quench layer as suggested by Lavoie and co-workers. For nonzero diluent fractions, the wall hydrocarbon concentration increased substantially. 810149. Fast Sampling Valve Measurements of Hydro- carbons in the Cylinder of a CFR Engine. P. Weiss and J. C. Keck, Massachusetts Institute of Technology. A time resolved study of the unburned hydrocarbons in the cylinder of a spark ignition engine has been made. A fast acting needle value was used to sample the gas near the cylinder wall opposite the spark plug. The volume sampled was measured by water displacement and the total hydrocarbon mole fraction was measured with a flame ionization detector. Measurements were made as a function of crank angle over the entire engine cycle for a range of equivalence ratios, inlet pressures, spark ad- vances, inlet temperatures, and EGR fractions. Average hydrocarbon concentrations in the exhaust were also measured. Two possible sources of post combustion hydrocarbon in the cylinder were considered: thin wall quench layers and fine crevices into which a flame cannot propagate. The results suggest that crevices were the source of the hydrocarbon. Models for predicting hydro- carbon from both quench layers and crevices were developed and are presented. 1981 SA E Transactions 810150. Experimental Analysis of IMEP in a Rotary Combustion Engine.

Previous methods used require data recording and later processing using a digital computer. The unique features of this instrumentation include its ability to measure IMEP on a cycle by cycle, real time basis and the elimination of the need to differentiate the volume function in real time. Measurements of two engine speeds (2000 and 3000 RPM) and a full range of loads are presented, although the instrument was designed to operate to speeds of 9000 RPM. 810151. Multidimensional Calculation of Combustion in an Idealised Homogeneous Charge Engine: a Progress Report. B. Ahmadi-Befrui, A. D. Gosman, F. C. Lockwood and A. P. Watkins, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Impe- rial College of Science and Technology, London, England. This paper is concerned with the calculation of combus- tion in an idealised homogeneous-charge spark-ignited engine having a disc-shaped combustion chamber equipped with a central spark plug and inlet/exhaust valve. The purpose of the study is to assess the ability of a class of turbulence combustion models, first developed for steady flows, to simulate the major features and trends of reciprocating engine combustion. The models are based on the supposition that the time scales of the turbulence energy dissipation will be the controlling rates at which reactions can take place. Experimental evidence lends support to this supposition. Hitherto, in multi-dimensional engine prediction methods, combustion predictions have almost invariably been based on chemical-kinetics reac- tion models. In the model evaluated here the reaction rate is related to the local species concentrations and the dissipation time scale, which is deduced from the pre- dicted levels of turbulence energy and its dissipation rate. Calculations are performed for a range of engine speeds, ignition timings and fuel-air ratios. The results reported reveal that, subject to uncertainties about the empirical treatment employed for the ignition process, and the need to make a once-for-all adjustment of the burning rate coefficients to procure the correct flame speed at one set of conditions, the model yields the correct trends in ñame speed, heat release and pressure variations. In addition, examination of the details of the flow and combustion fields, show that, contrary to the predictions of Rapid Distortion Theory, the flame appears not to provoke substantial changes in the turbulence levels of the unburned gases. 1981 SAE Transactions 810152. Predicting the Performance and Emission Char- acteristics of an Axisymmetric Spark Ignition Engine. Mario Belli, Sergio G. Bova, Guido A. Danieli, Gaetano Florio and Gianfranco Leone, Dipartimento di Meccanica, Università della Calabria (Cosenza/Italy). A prediction model of the performance and emission characteristics of an axisymmetric spark ignition engine has been developed. The chamber is considered to be a thermodynamic system. Combustion is computed using the Blizard and Keck eddy entrainment mechanism as modified by Tabaczynski et al. Heat transfer is computed by the forced convection equation and a gas motion model based on continuity equations. Changes in the geometrical shape of the chamber and flame propagation have both been taken into account. NO formation has been modeled with the extended Zeldovich mechanism. Model predictions and literature data were compared. Appropriate values were determined for the four param- eters describing the combustion process and the agree- ment was good. Parametric studies on both performance and emissions were then made. However the experimental data available is insufficient to test the model fully. A more complete comparison will be made as soon as the Department test engine is ready. 810155. A Non-Contacting Torque Sensor for the Internal Combustion Engine. W. B. Ribbens, Univ. of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI. This paper discusses an inexpensive, noncontacting sensor for the measurement of the quasi-average torque of an internal combustion engine. The quantity which is actually measured by this sensor is a low-pass filter transformation of instantaneous developed torque having a bandwidth of about 9Hz. This method of torque measurement uses an inexpensive sensor which directly measures instantaneous crankshaft angular velocity. Elec- tronic signal processing generates a signal which is proportional to instantaneous crankshaft angular accel- eration. The relationship between engine developed torque and various transformations of this acceleration have been experimentally studied. This paper shows that certain of these transformations are highly correlated with the desired torque signal under transient as well as steady state operation. Transient operations which have been studied include changes in throttle position. The paper explains the sensor concept in terms of specific mathematical models for the torque and engine dynamics. 1981 SAE Transactions 810156. PTC Honeycomb Heater for Improved Fuel Vaporization. Peter G. Berg, Texas Instruments Inc., Control Products Div. Early fuel evaporation systems which provide heat energy to the fuel-air mixture early in the cold start cycle are presently widely used to improve fuel vaporization. Most of these early fuel evaporation systems use engine heat to provide the required thermal input. A newly developed early fuel evaporation approach uses a polycrystalline 41</page><page sequence="23">810157-810163 ceramic heater which is electrically energized. This heater has the ability to automatically control its output power by continuously adjusting its internal crystal structure. This paper describes the construction and operation of this heater as it applies to fuel vaporization improvements in gasoline powered vehicles. 810157. Cost Effective Engine Controls. Ronald J. Frei- mark, Automotive Systems Engineering, Motorola SG, Inc., Mesa, A Z. Hardware and software techniques are explored which allow the use of the Motorola MC6805 family of single chip microcomputers in a low cost full engine control application. A phase lock loop hardware technique is presented in which all engine timings for an electronic low pressure fuel injection system are calculated in terms of crankshaft angles. Future MC6805 based engine control systems are discussed employing a multiple processor approach to cost effective engine controls. 810159. Fail-Safe Microcomputer Software. K. N. Rao, John Deere Product Engineering Center, Water- loo, IA. This paper presents some of the error checking and fault tolerant schemes necessary to ensure extremely reliable and fail-safe micro-computer controls. The software has to be designed to operate in a diagnostic mode, as well as in a fail-safe mode, in addition to normal operational mode. The system operational characteristics are thoroughly preprocessed and hierarchially arranged as parameters for ready use by different modes of operation to ensure reliability. Some error correcting schemes to bring the system to safe operating condition are also described. A close integration of hardware, as well as software controls, in a hierarchial manner, will ensure a reliable control system. 1981 SAE Transactions 810160. Microprocessor Based Systems in the Automo- bile: Custom Integrated Circuits Provide an Effective Interface. Mark B. Kearney, John R. Shreve and Wesley A. Vincent, Delco Elec- tronics Div., General Motors Corp. While the MOS microprocessor chip has been used as a cost effective electronic building block for simultaneously meeting the goals of fuel management, emissions and reliability, it has also created the need for additional interface electronics. Interface circuits are necessary to buffer and protect the sensitive MOS circuitry from the loading and electrical transients of mechanical switches, sensors, solenoids and indicators. In some instances, the interface can be solved using a few inexpensive discrete parts, but the complexity of new systems justifies the design of custom ICs to fulfill the requirements. This paper describes how custom bipolar ICs can be used to reduce system cost and improve noise immunity, as well as reliability, when designing interface electronics. 810161. Modeling Tire Deformation for Power Loss Calculations. Donald Whicker, Engineering Me- chanics Department, General Motors Research Laboratories; and Steve M. Rohde, Mechanical Research Department, General Motors Re- search Laboratories. A combined thermo-mechanical model for calculating tire power loss has been developed at GMR. This paper presents the techniques for developing the realistic finite element models needed in both the thermal and defor- mation portions of the combined model. It also describes the techniques used in calculating deformed tire shapes. First, procedures are outlined for automatically generating a finite element discretization of a tire. Then, this discretization, together with information about the properties of tire materials, is used to develop a finite element model of the tire. This model is used in MSC NASTRAN to calculate compliances, i.e., the response of the tire to inflation and to unit loads applied at points on the tire surface. These compliances are then used in an algorithm which calculates the deformed shape of a tire loaded against the pavement surface. Sample results are presented to show the agreement between calculated and measured tire deformation. 1981 SAE Transactions 810162. Modeling Tire Energy Dissipation for Power Loss Calculations. Daniel J. Segalman, Engineering Mechanics Department, General Motors Re- search Laboratories. A mathematical formulation for calculating the energy dissipation in a steadily rolling tire is presented. The formulation uses a nonlinear constitutive equation for the viscoelastic stress response of the tire rubber. The constitutive equation is used in conjunction with infor- mation on tire material distribution, the tire temperature field, and the tire deformation field to calculate the unrecovered work done during each rotation of the tire. The required information about the distribution and viscoelastic properties of tire materials can be determined experimentally for real tires or specified for hypothetical tires. The tire temperature and deformation fields may be determined experimentally, provided by other portions of a combined thermo-mechanical tire power loss model, or be specified in any other physically plausible manner. 1981 SAE Transactions 810163. Modeling the Thermal State of Tires for Power Loss Calculations. Alan L. Browne and Artemis Arambages, General Motors Research Labs. A combined thermo-mechanical model has been devel- oped at GMR to aid in reducing tire power loss. The thermal analysis portion of this tire power loss model is 42</page><page sequence="24">810164-810168 the subject of this paper. A brief overview is first given of existing tire power loss thermal models. The present thermal analysis is then described in detail. It provides solutions to the basic equation of heat transfer within the tire structure and to its surroundings. The solutions are obtained by inter- polating between an array of solutions that has been previously generated by use of the finite element nonlinear thermal analysis and stored in a data base. Required experimental inputs are detailed. Examples demonstrating the accuracy of this interpolation scheme are then presented. Conclusions reached are that: • Interpolation between an array of previously obtained solutions is a viable computational method for determining the thermal state of tires, and • By interpolation, cost and time of the computer analysis are reduced while accuracy is maintained. 1981 SA E Transactions 810164. The Structure and Use of the GMR Combined Thermo-Mechanical Tire Power Loss Model. Donald Whicker, Alan L. Browne and Daniel J. Segalman, Engineering Mechanics Department, General Motors Research Laboratories. The operational structure and use of the "General Motors Research Laboratories Combined Thermo-Mechanical Tire Power Loss Model" are presented in this paper. The modular format of this tire power loss model is briefly reviewed. Descriptions of its three major analysis mod- ules - thermal, dissipation, and deformation - are given. A flow chart is presented showing how these modules are interfaced to form an interactive, iterative model. Steps required to operate this model, procedures necessary to obtain and prepare the input data, and sample results obtained using the model are presented. 1981 SA E Transactions 810165. Contained Air Flow in a Radial Tire. D. J. Schuring, The Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co.; G. T. Skinner and W. J. Rae, Aerodynamic Re- search Dept., Calspan Advanced Technology Center. Internal heat transfer through the tire cavity from the tire to the rim is strongly influenced by the speed distribution of the cavity air. For lack of any experimental data, exploratory tests with a hot-wire anemometer were performed on a radial tire operated at various loads, speeds, and inflation pressures. The measurement tech- nique is described, and some results are presented. Cavity air flow is governed by the peristaltic action of the footprint region; however, it is strongly modified by secondary flows. The general speed distribution is very stable, with a peak at the leading edge of the footprint and a near-zero minimum at the tire top. Peak speeds of about 30% of the tire road speed were measured. These high speeds together with the augmenting effects of secondary flows may produce internal heat transfer coefficients well comparable with those at the outer surface. 1981 SA E Transactions 810166. The Airflow Field Around An Operating Tire and Its Effect on Tire Power Loss. L. J. Oswald and A. L. Browne, Engineering Mechanics Depart- ment, General Motors Research Laboratories. The airflow direction, velocity, and turbulence level were measured around the left front tire of a passenger car operating on-road over the normal driving speed range. Both photographic and hot-wire anemometer techniques were employed. The measured airflow field, and other idealized ones, were used to select appropriate values for the tire heat transfer coefficient from previous GMR work. Tire power loss was then calculated with the GMR Combined Thermo-Mechanical Model to assess the importance of the airflow field on tire power loss. It was found that for the range of realistic flow conditions, tire power loss could be changed by up to 6% by the flow conditions alone. 810167. Rolling Resistance Measurements with a Piezo- Electric Measuring System. Albert Dijks, Vrede- stein Banden B.V. (Enschede, The Netherlands). Rolling resistance of tires has become an important factor in the energy system of an automobile. To reduce the rolling resistance forces of tires it is necessary to have a measuring system capable of distinguishing small differ- ences due to small variations in the tire itself and due to varying usage conditions. The Delft Vehicle Research Laboratory has designed and built a measuring system based on piezo-electric multi-component force transduc- ers. The system has been mounted as fifth wheel in a frontwheel driven car and may be used either in the laboratory or on the road. Results of measurements are presented for one representative steel belted radial tire type and influences of load, speed, inflation, toe-in, camber and tread depth are given. During the measurements the tread surface temper- ature, shoulder temperature and inflation rise are regis- tered. To indicate the meaning of differences in rolling resistance, the relation to the fuel consumption of a midsize European car is reported. 810168. Tire Rolling Resistance and Vehicle Fuel Con- sumption. Glenn D. Thompson and Martin E. Reineman, United States Environmental Pro- tection Agency. Tires have a very significant effect on the fuel con- sumption of a vehicle; consequently both SAE and EPA have developed test procedures for a laboratory meas- urement of the energy dissipation characteristic of tires. This paper demonstrates a good correlation between the tire rolling resistance coefficients of three radial and one bias-ply tire and the fuel consumption of vehicles when 43</page><page sequence="25">810169-810178 equipped with these tires. A change of 0.001 in the tire rolling resistance coefficient resulted in an average fuel consumption effect of 2.2 cc/km on the EPA urban cycle and 1.5 cc/km on the highway cycle. In general, a 10 percent change in the rolling resistance coefficient resulted in a 2 percent change in the vehicle fuel consumption. 1981 SA E Transactions 810169.

Speech Response System for Automotive Appli- cations. Gideon Amir, American Microsystems, Inc., Santa Clara, CA. The emergence of semiconductor speech synthesizers has made automotive applications feasible. This paper de- scribes some of the chips available today, their principle of operation and their compatibility with automotive appli- cations. 810171. Improvement of LCD Legibility for Automobiles. Ikumichi Terada and Kazuyuki Akeyoshi, Re- search &amp; Development Div., Asahi Glass Co., Ltd. (Yokohama/ Japan). Recently liquid crystal display (LDC) is quite expected for automotive instrument panels because it has many possibilities in design. But it is not sufficient in using LCD for automobile yet and the legibility of the LCD instrument panel has not been discussed. This paper describes methods of improving LCD legibility and a sample of LCD instrument panel is shown. 810172. Dichroic Liquid Crystal Displays for Automotive Instrument Panel. Shuichi lida, Kizoh Hattori and Kazutoshi Sawada, Research &amp; Develop- ment Div., Asahi Glass Co., Ltd. (Yokohama/ Japan). The characteristics of a guest-host LCD using a phase transition mode (the dichroic LCD) were measured. Being operated without polarizers, it has a wide viewing angle and a high stability to humidity. These advantages which conventional TN-LCDs didn't have are important for automotive instrument panel use. A uniform spacing technology is needed because the threshold voltage depends on a cell gap in the phase transition mode LCD. The dichroic LCD gives a wide mesomorphic range (-30 to 87.5 °C), a quick response, a high contrast, a wide viewing angle, a high stability to humidity, a high photostability, a low operating voltage and a low power dissipation. 810173. Interface and Data Format Converters in Au- tomotive Data Acquistion and Control Systems. R. C. Richards and Frank F. Stucki, Signetics Corp., Automotive Div., Sunnyvale, CA. The interconnect problem within automotive type data acquisition and control system is reviewed. In real time systems which used analog type sensors and transducers, high speed data and information format converters are needed. The format converters can be realized as single devices or possibly as part of the data processing equipment. In case threshold or switch type sensors are used to gather control information, the need for data or information format converters is minimized. Threshold sensors have also the capability to perform logic and decision making functions as single elements, or can be combined into threshold logic type network. The per- formance of such up front data processing, reduces the need of continuous realtime data processing but addi- tional memory capacity is needed to store control patterns, which are used to characterize typical control conditions. 810174. Multiplexing - Application and Installation. Paul M. Goyke, National Semiconductor. The rapid advances in semiconductor technology make multiplex wiring an attractive addition to the option laden downsized automobile. It allows the transmission of data directly on the power line using sine waves to minimize EMI/RFI. It also allows the multiplex system to operate without a failure-prone master controller. 810175. EMI-RFI Software Filtering. Marcello Vene- ziano and Tom Spoto, Ford Motor Co. In the last few years, there has been a considerable number of applications of microcomputer based systems in the automotive industry. Such systems have advantages in discriminating the signal from the EMI/RFI noise, through software techniques. This paper will explain how easily a system can be affected by EMI/RFI interference and briefly discuss some microprocessor software tech- niques on possible noise discriminating applications. 1981 SAE Transactions 810177. Reliability Considerations in the Manufacture of Chrysler's Electronic Instrument Cluster. Ber- nard F. Heinrich, Chrysler Corp., Huntsville Electronics Div., Huntsville, AL.

Multigrade Gear Lubricants in Truck Fleet Testing - Analysis for Fuel Economy Effects. R. 44</page><page sequence="26">810179-810186 L. Stambaugh, R. A. Galluccio and R. D. Koller, Rohm and Haas Co. The use of specially formulated engine oil is now an acceptable means of increasing the fuel efficiency of a vehicle. In principle, many of the same arguments used to justify their performance can also be applied to gear lubricants. Viscometrics and shear stability are discussed as they pertain to proper polymer selection for gear lubricant service. The fuel efficiency effects for three experimental lubricants relative to a commercial SAE 90 grade fluid were determined from a 3.1 million mile (5.0 million km) fleet test involving heavy duty trucks in normal service. The statistical techniques used to design this fleet test and analyze the data are presented, and the physical interpretation of the results is discussed. The results show that use of properly selected multi-grade gear lubricants can result in significant reduction in fuel consumption. 810179. The Effect of Gear Lubricant on Fuel Economy as Measured in a Line Haul Truck Fleet. J. H. Adams, K. A. Frost, L. M. Hartmann and L. J. Painter, Chevron Research Company, Rich- mond, California. A gear lubricant field test in 32 new Class 8 vehicles totaling over 2 million miles (3.2 million kilometers) determined that one lubricant compounded with a potassium borate additive can be used in both axle and transmissions, providing a 3.5% benefit in fuel economy compared to conventional lubricants, while giving supe- rior wear protection and oxidation stability. 810181. (SP-484) Light Absorption Measurements of Diesel Particulate Matter. Huel C. Scherrer, David B. Kittelson and Daniel F. Dolan, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, Univ. of Minnesota. Light absorption and scattering coefficients have been measured for particles emitted by two diesel engines; one direct injection and one indirect injection, operating over a range of speeds and loads. Integrating plate absorption measurements yield a specific absorption coefficient of 9.1 square meters per gram of non-volatile particulate matter at 550 nm wavelength. This absorption coefficient is inversely proportional to wavelength and independent of engine operating conditions or type. The scattering coefficient was simultaneously measured as 1.3 square meters per gram of undifferentiated particulate matter. These experimental results are shown to be in the range predicted by theoretical absorption and scattering cal- culations, which have been made for elongated carbon- void particles. 1981 SAE Transactions 810183. (SP-484) Measurement of Flame Temperature Distribution in a D.I. Diesel Engine by Means of Image Analysis of Nega-Color Photographs. Soo Kil Ahn, Yukio Matsui, Takeyuki Kamimoto and Shin Matsuoka, Tokyo Institute of Tech- nology. A new technique was proposed for measuring instan- taneous distributions of flame temperature and KL factor of luminous flames. Here the principle of the two-color method was used to calculate flame temperature and KL factor from the two-color densities of a film image taken on a nega-color film. We applied this technique to the high speed nega-color photographs of flames in a D.I. diesel engine operated with varying swirl ratios, and discussed the measured results of instantaneous distribution of flame temperature and KL factors. 1981 SAE Transactions 810184. Formulae for the Tractive-Energy Requirements of Vehicles Driving the EPA Schedules. Gino Sovran and Mark S. Bohn, General Motors Research Laboratories. A comprehensive analysis of the tractive-energy require- ments of the EPA Urban and Highway driving schedules has been made. The results are compact formulae in which the specific tractive energy required to negotiate a schedule is correlated primarily with the ratio of effective aerodynamic frontal area to vehicle mass; the tire rolling resistance coefficients are additional variables. The formulae coefficients permit easy determination of the proportions of the input energy required for overcoming the aerodynamic and rolling resistances, and for supplying the net powered increases in vehicle kinetic energy, respectively. The specific energy dissipated by braking has also been formulated. 1981 SAE Transactions 810185. Necessity and Premises for Reducing the Aero- dynamic Drag of Future Passenger Cars. R. Buchheim, K.-R. Deutenbach and H.-J. Lückoff, Volks wagen werk AG. Among the ways to reduce the resistance to motion and, in turn, improve fuel economy for future mass-produced passenger cars, the reduction of aerodynamic drag is the most promising. It is shown that drag reductions of 25% to 35% are achievable in future mass-produced passenger cars. This indicates that aerodynamics alone can provide a 10% to 15% fuel economy improvement in future pas- senger cars. The development procedures, and the shape and design characteristics which lead to such mentioned drag reductions are described and analyzed in some detail. 1981 SAE Transactions 810186. Automobile Aerodynamic Drag on the Road Compared With Wind Tunnel Tests. A. Morelli and P. Nuccio, Politecnico di Torino (Italy); and A. Visconti, FIAT-Research Center. This investigation was performed with the purpose of 45</page><page sequence="27">810187-810191 comparing the aerodynamic drag of an automobile as measured in a full-scale wind tunnel with the drag as measured on the road. A definition of the drag coefficient as measured both on the road and in the wind tunnel is given in advance in order to allow a comparison to be made between the two operating conditions. Three medium size European cars were selected, one notch-back type and two hatch-back types. Road testing was mainly based on the coast-down method. The total resistance was determined by statistical analysis of the experimental results. The theoretical basis and the specifications of the procedure are investigated and justified. Additional outdoor and indoor tests were carried out in order to isolate the aerodynamic drag. The wind tunnel tests were conducted on the same cars fully equipped as tested on the road and in the same speed range. The wind tunnel tests being executed at steady speeds, however, supple- mentary road tests were performed in order to determine the effect of the deceleration on the aerodynamic drag. The final results show only small differences between the aerodynamic drag coefficients as measured in the wind tunnel and on the road with the procedure here described. 810187. FIAT Research Center Reference Car: Corre- lation Tests Between Four Full Scale European Wind Tunnels and Road. A. Costelli, A. Garrone and A. Visconti, FIAT Research Center; R. Buchheim, Volkswagenwerk AG; A. Cogotti, Pininfarina Research Center; and A. Kuhn, Daimler Benz AG. As part of the general program for comparing leading European automotive wind tunnels, three reference cars derived by Volkswagen (VW), Pininfarina (PF) and FIAT Research Center (CRF) from production models, were tested in different configurations. This report contains the result of tests carried out on a CRF reference car in CRF, VW, DB and PF wind tunnels as well as on the road. The wind tunnel tests of the car in 7 different configurations show a fairly good agreement particularly for the drag coefficients measured in the various tunnels. Road tests were carried out with the car in three configurations at constant speed (measuring front and rear axle lift, body pressure and visualizing the wake) and in coast-down (measuring aerodynamic resistance). The results obtained proved that road driving con- ditions with no side wind or turbulence are correctly simulated in wind tunnel tests. 1981 SA E Transactions 810188. Car-Following Evaluation of Braking Decelera- tion Level Signals. Rudolf G. Mortimer, Univ. of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. A driving test was used to evaluate brake signaling displays, including deceleration signals, and a simulated brake signal failure. Measures related to car-following and rear-end collision performance were clearly degraded by the brake signal's failure and there were a few differences between the conventional and experimental configura- tions. 810189. Validation of the Reduction of Rear-End Colli- sions by a High-Mounted Auxiliary Stoplamp. Raymond E. Reilly, David S. Kurke and C. C. Buckenmaier, Jr., Allen Corp. of America. This study was a field validation of the effectiveness of an auxiliary high-mounted stoplamp in reducing rear-end collisions. A previous study (DOT-HS-803-467), using taxicabs, found a 54 percent reduction in relevant rear-end impacts to vehicles equipped with the auxiliary stoplamp. The present study used 5,400 telephone company passenger vehicles, half rest, half control, which accu- mulated 55 million miles during a 12-month continuous data collection period. The results showed a statistically significant 53 percent reduction in relevant rear-end impact rate in the test group as compared to the control group. The findings were thus consistent with the previous study on taxicabs. 1981 SA E Transactions 810190. The Potential of Daytime Running Lights as a Vehicle Collision Countermeasure. Dennis A. Attwood, Road Safety Unit, Road and Motor Vehicle Traffic Safety Branch, Transport Can- ada. The use of vehicle lighting during the daytime can increase the visiblity of a vehicle and can improve a driver's ability to estimate its location and direction of travel. Collision surveys conducted by both industry and government have demonstrated that the use of driving lights during the daytime can reduce the number and severity of multi-vehicle collisions. Moreover, cursory analyses suggest that the use of properly designed daytime running lights can be a cost/effective collision counter- measure. The proper design of running lights, considering the upper and lower limits of light intensity, fuel consumption and maintenance costs, is discussed. 1981 SA E Transactions 810191. Daylight Running Lights in Sweden - Pre-Stud- ies and Experiences. Kāre Rumar, National Swedish Road and Traffic Research Institute (VTI). The usage of daytime running lights in Sweden started at the end of the 60's. The behavioral studies of various measures to improve vehicle daylight conspicuity started at the same time. The conspicuity of oncoming vehicles was analyzed for drivers in real traffic. Brightness and colour contrast were found to be the most common causes of detection. The effect of different vehicle colours and lighted low beams on detection time was studied. The low 46</page><page sequence="28">810192-810199 beam condition was in all situations as good as the best colour. Many field experiments of peripheral detection as a function of running light intensity were carried out. Various types of running light systems were developed. The costs of a running light were calculated. A running light specification (intensity: 300 - 800 cd) and a law concerning its use (1 Oct. 1977) were written. The accident analyses indicate a very favourable effect of daylight running lights on collision accidents in daylight. 810192. Measurement of Effectiveness of Rear-Turn- Signal Systems in Reducing Vehicle Accidents from an Analysis of Actual Accident Data. Gordon W. Taylor and Winson K. Ng, Trans- port Canada. A study of vehicle accident data from insurance claim files was conducted to determine the relative effectiveness of red and amber turn-signal systems in reducing rear-end collisions. The effectiveness was measured in terms of the relative frequency of accidents involving these systems, with respect to a number of vehicle, environmental, and driver factors. Control for vehicle exposure was made by comparing the non-turning accidents with the turning accidents for the relevant rear-turn-signal systems. Analyses revealed that there were no statistically significant differences in rear-end accident rates between the red and amber turn-signal systems. On the basis of safety benefits, the results of the study did not appear to provide sufficient justification for changes to the present Motor Vehicle Safety Standards regarding the functional separation and colour coding of a rear-turn-signal system. 810194. Solid Modeling in CAD/CAM Systems. Leon- idas J. Jones, General Electric Co. Solid modeling provides a significant improvement in capability for describing product designs and providing these descriptions to CAD/CAM functions with a min- imum of human re-interpretation or re-generation of the geometric data. However, a solid modeler must provide a variety of critical functions if it is to serve as a master design representation and must be embedded in a computer system providing the necessary input, output, and data management interfaces. A strategy of the development of such systems and progress using that strategy at the General Electric Research and Devel- opment Center are discussed. 810195. The Role of Solid Modelling in Machining- Process Modelling and NC Verification. Herbert B. Voelcker, The Univ. of Rochester; and William A. Hunt, Eastman Kodak Co. The study of mathematical functions and computational algorithms for modelling the geometrical effects of manufacturing processes is a new research field that draws heavily on theories and technologies for modelling solid objects. This paper summarizes some recent work on the modelling of conventional machining, and on the use of such models in systems for verifying automatically the correctness of NC programs. 810196. GMSOLID - A System for Interactive Design and Analysis of Solids. John W. Boyse, General Motors Research Labs.; and Jeffrey M. Rosen, General Motors Mfg. Development. Computer graphic systems currently in production are effective for designing curves and surfaces. These systems, however, are not suitable for designing solids and cannot support many important analysis functions such as checking for interference among solid objects. GMSOLID is a solid modeling system with an interface to CADANCE, GM's graphic system. With GMSOLID, users can design complex solids by combining other simpler solids with set operations. The simplest solids (primitives), such as blocks or cones, are created directly. Because the computer has a true solid representation, the graphics system can display these solids in multiple views with hidden edges removed or dashed. Sections can be cut and cross-hatched automatically, and properties of the solid such as area and mass can be computed. 1981 SA E Transactions 810197. The Design of Assemblies. Charles M. Eastman, Institute of Building Sciences and Design Re- search Center, Carnegie-Mellon Univ., Pitts- burgh, PA. In most engineering problems, the object of interest is a composition of parts, formed into an assembly . Each shape within an assembly responds to both internal and external dependencies that determine its well-formedness. To date there has been little focus on the external dependencies. Two kinds of external dependencies are developed: locational and dimensional dependencies. Techniques for automatic maintenance of locational and dimensional dependencies are described and examples presented. 810198. Machine Layout With Volumetric Models. Rob- ert H. Johnson and Donald L. Dewhirst, Man- ufacturing Data Systems Inc., Ann Arbor, MI. Computer-Aided Engineering Systems are interactive computer based systems for application to a wide variety of engineering and manufacturing functions. Volumetric models and a structured data base are two key compo- nents of these systems. This paper presents the concept of a Product Structured Data Base and its use in combi- nation with volumetric models, in the layout phase of a machine design. This combination provides for automatic analysis of interference and fit between parts of a machine. 810199. Aluminium Based Crankshaft Bearings for the High Speed Diesel Engine. G. C. Pratt and C. A. Perkins, The Glacier Metal Co. Ltd. 47</page><page sequence="29">810200-810205 An engine bearing lining alloy of composition Al Si 1 1 Cu 1 is described which has been developed in the UK specifically for the high speed diesel engine. The alloy has the advantage of superior seizure resistance when compared with lead bronze on test rigs under conditions of sparse lubrication and controlled misalignment. The alloy is moreover free from the corrosive attack by hot oil to which lead bronze is subject. Evidence from a new design of bearing fatigue rig is presented which shows the strength of the alloy to be equivalent to that of lead bronze. The alloy has been adopted in both the connecting rod and main bearing positions in normally aspirated and turbocharged high speed diesel engines imposing loads on the bearings in excess of 55 MN/m2 (8 000 lbf/in2). 810200. Examination of Stresses in Sleeve Bearing Backs. Albert J. Matzelle, Federal-Mogul Corp., Engine and Transmission Products Group. The foundation of any multi-layered sleeve bearing is its backing. Traditional analytical methods cannot account for the variation in design, manufacturing techniques, or assembly practices - all of which have a decided affect on bearing performance. For this reason, a practical method has been developed which employs various strain meas- uring techniques to provide for a more accurate descrip- tion and analysis of the stress distribution in a sleeve bearing back and its influence on bearing performance. 1981 SA E Transactions 810201. A Friction-Reducing Shaft Surface for Use With Standard Radial Sharp Lip Oil Seals. James D. Symons, Mechanical Research Dept., General Motors Research Laboratories, Warren, MI. In the use of radial lip-type oil seals to seal against a rotating shaft, the surface characteristics of the shaft are important to the sealing and to the resultant seal/shaft friction. A plunge ground shaft surface with no lead has long been the recommended mating surface for a radial lip-type oil seal. Recently, however, a peened surface was studied which will reduce frictional torques a maximum of 50%, 60%, and 70% below that of one utilizing a plunge ground shaft surface for silicone, nitrile and polyacrylate seal materials, respectively. Seal performance from a leakage standpoint for standard sharp lip seals exceeds that of the plunge ground surface. However, the prelim- inary results indicate that the surface is not suitable with hydrodynamic shaft seals. Some insight into elastomeric friction was obtained from the tests. Surface character- istics which were shown to be important from a friction standpoint were asperity spacing (roughness width), asperity radius of curvature and asperity angle. The process was also shown to eliminate grinding lead on the shaft. 1981 SA E Transactions 810202. Ranking and Predicting Seals. LaVonn T. Gil- bert, International Harvester Co. The dynamic life of general purpose radial lip seals is found to be dependent upon the retention of the elastomeric properties of the sealing element. Determi- nation of the retention of elastomeric properties or "static life" is measurable utilizing changes in microhardness. Static aging during hot fluid immersion results in accelerated elastomeric degradation which is manifested by extreme increases in microhardness for nitrile rubbers. This hardening provides a convenient and accurate tool to rank and predict seal performance. 810203. Some Comments on Comfort Shock Absorber Seals. E. M. v. Arndt, K. H. Spies and W. Trauth, Carl Freudenberg. The unique demands of down-sized cars on the engi- neering departments of spring strut manufacturers have forced their seal suppliers to design new rod seals. The spring loaded lip seal is now a standard element of McPherson struts. An improved lip seal design with a lubrication groove provides even better riding comfort for the new generation of lighter cars. 810204. A Study of Oil Seals for Shock Absorbers of Automotive Suspensions. Yoshio Ohtake, Yoshio Kawahara and Hiroshi Hirabayashi, Nippon Oil Seal Industry Co., Ltd. (Japan); Yasuo Yamamoto and Susumu lida, NOK, Inc., U.S.A. Types of oil seals for automotive shock absorbers and their characteristics are given, and necessary items for designing seals are clarified based on experiments and experiences upon required performances of products. 810205. Thermal Performance of a Ceramic Coated Turbine Vane under Transient Gas Conditions. Herbert J. Gladden, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Lewis Research Center. The thermal performance of an air-cooled turbine vane, uncoated and coated with the NASA thermal barrier coating system (yttria stabilized zirconia plus NiCrAlY bond), was experimentally studied at both transient and steady state gas conditions in a four-vane cascade. The steady state full-throttle and idle gas conditions inves- tigated were 1550 K, 8.3 atm and 940 K, 7.1 atm, respectively. The ceramic coating reduced the temperature gradient within the airfoil and increased the time constant of the airfoil metal wall by 20 to 50% compared to the uncoated vane. The metal temperature of the ceramic coated airfoil also lagged changes in the gas temperature by about 0.4 seconds. In addition, the ceramic coating increased the full-throttle airfoil cooling performance which resulted in a decreased metal temperature of 200 kelvins. 48</page><page sequence="30">810206-810216 810206. Ceramic-Metal Joining for Turbine Applications. M. I. Mendelson and S. A. McLeod, Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft Group, West Palm Beach, FL 33402. A compression bonding method has been developed to join ceramic components to superalloys in turbine en- gines, e.g., blades-to-disk, vane-to-shaft and hub-to-shaft. The method involves isothermal forging (GATORIZ- ING®) the metal around the ceramic using a compliant internal layer. The attachment of a Si3N4 blade/superalloy disk (hybrid rotor) was characterized based upon the chemical and mechanical compatibility of their interface. The life of the joint was predicted. Finally, the integrity of the hybrid rotor joint was evaluated by spin testing the rotors at 45,000 rpm at a blade temperature of 1505°K (2250° F) for 88 hours. 1981 SAE Transactions 810207. Rotary Heat Exchanger Mounting Systems. C. J. Rahnke and J. K. Vallance, Ford Motor Co. A rotary heat exchanger may be mounted at either the hub or the rim. In either case, the mounting system must be capable of thousands of hours of operation, unlubri- cated, and in a highly oxidizing environment at temper- atures in excess of 250°C (482°F). The development of both a hub mounted and a rim mounted system is described in this paper, and pertinent test results in the solution of durability problems peculiar to each system are reviewed. These results are based on over 300,000 hours of turbine engine test experience on rotary ceramic heat exchangers. 1981 SA E Transactions 810208. Methods of Producing Compacted Graphite Structures. Thomas F. Fugiel and Michael J. Lalich, Foote Mineral Co., Exton, PA. The growing number of applications for compacted graphite irons has placed an increased emphasis on production methods for this material. This paper will review various techniques by which compacted graphite structures can be produced, evaluate production con- straints posed by each method, summarize commercial production experience where applicable, and highlight areas of compacted graphite production where further developmental work is being focused. 1981 SA E Transactions 810209. Mechanical Properties of Compacted Graphite Cast Iron. Gary F. Ruff, GM Manufacturing Development, GM Technical Center, Warren, MI. Data from mechanical property evaluations of compacted graphite iron are summarized and reviewed. A significant amount of information is presented regarding the influ- ence of structure, composition, and processing variable on compacted graphite iron tensile properties, while com- pression, shear, fatigue, and impact data is limited. Little testing has been conducted to establish bending and elevated temperature properties, and further research will be necessary to insure the acceptability of compacted graphite iron for specific applications. 1981 SA E Transactions 810212. The Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS)- Ten Years of Progress. Elaine Petrucelli, American Asso- ciation for Automotive Medicine. Injury scaling as a means for classifying the extent of trauma has a long history. Joint medical-engineering activity related to motor vehicle crash injury research, however, did not formally begin until 1967. Four years later, the first Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) was published. During the past ten years, the AIS has undergone four revisions, the most significant one in 1980. Several major problem areas, especially related to coding brain injuries, have been resolved successfully. Areas still requiring study are training needs for AIS users; sources of injury data; and comparability of the AIS with other injury classi- fication systems. 810213. The History and Evolution of the Collision Deformation Classification SAE J224 MAR80. W. D. Nelson, General Motors Corp. The Collision Deformation Classification, CDC, is an abbreviated means of communicating or describing vehicle collision damage, useful to persons collecting and interpreting vehicle collision data. This paper explains the history and philosophy, leading to the current revisions in the S.A.E. Recommended Practice. 810215. Collision Deformation Classification for Trucks. D. L. Hendricks, Calspan Field Services, Inc. The Truck Deformation Classification - SAE J1301 - is a research tool used to describe collision contact damage sustained by large truck units. Damage patterns are described in an abbreviated seven digit coded format. Standardization of the reporting format and the complete descriptions provided by the code structure allow the evaluation of damage configurations for single accidents and mass accident data. This paper describes the devel- opment phases leading to publication of SAE J 1301, the coding logic associated with the latter document, and the results of initial field application efforts. 810216. Insurance Losses in Relation to the Safety Characteristics of Automobiles Demonstrated by an Automatic vs Manual Seat Belt Study. Michael R. Appleby, Joseph J. Pratt and Bruce E. Hodge, Automobile Club of Southern Cali- fornia. The relationship between automobile insurance and the safety quality of automobiles is reviewed. Application of 49</page><page sequence="31">810217-810224 the automobile safety characteristic of crashworthiness to the auto insurance process, operating under both fault (tort liability) and no-fault conditions is presented, including the effect of the characteristics on ratemaking. Other data from various sources, e.g., manufacturers, government sponsored efforts such as the National Accident Sampling System (NASS), and internal insur- ance industry sources, are examined. The current status and potential benefit for extending the data collection is discussed. As an example, data from crash tests, insurance companies and case studies in- volving Volkswagen Rabbit automobiles equipped with both automatic and manual seat belts is reviewed and evaluated. The limitations, benefits, and costs of developing data are discussed together with the potential for incorporation of other data (e.g. from NASS). 810217. An Alternative to Percentile Models. Kathleen M. Robinette and John T. McConville, An- thropology Research Project, Inc., Yellow Springs, OH. Percentile values are valuable statistics for representing the extreme ends of a distribution of sizes for a single human body dimension; however, their use is not suitable to every problem. When it is desirable to combine dimensions in order to construct a model of the human body or any of its parts, percentiles can create problems due to the fact that, with the exception of 50th percentiles, percentile values are not additive. This report demon- strates the seriousness of the problems associated with the use of percentiles, and describes and compares an alternative approach for representing human body size variability. This alternative, which utilizes regression equations, offers a solution which is easily accessible and demonstrably an improvement over percentiles for the purpose of creating human models. 1981 SA E Transactions 810218. Driver Body Size Considerations in Future U.S. Heavy Truck Interior Cab Design. Richard G. Snyder, Highway Safety Research Institute, The University of Michigan. Accurate data on the body dimensions of truck drivers are needed and such data are not presently available. This paper provides basic source data and an anthropometrical overview of the usefulness and limitations of existing data bases; discusses the influence of population factors, including age, sex, and demographic variables; and reviews population sampling problems. Heavy truck drivers as a whole appear to represent a physically different population from that of either the U.S. general population or other professional groups. Future anthro- pometric surveys must provide information for improved accommodation for the increasing range of physical size of users, and for obtaining data more useful to engineers involved in heavy truck interior cab design. 1981 SA E Transactions 810221. Truck Cab Environment. The View From The Trucking Managers9 Perspective. Victor A. Suski and Larry Strawhorn, Engineering Department, American Trucking Associations, Inc. Considerable attention is being focused on the short and long term effects of driving on truck drivers. The effects of the cab environment, its temperature control, its size, its integrity, and its ride and handling quality are subjects of interest. The motor carrier industry views these matters differently from other concerned parties. This perspective is explained in general terms in this paper. Gaps in the knowledge concerning drivers are mentioned and a systematic research program is suggested to encompass the total driver/vehicle package. 810222. Truck Cab Environment - The View from Behind the Wheel. R. V. Durham, International Broth- erhood of Teamsters. The popular view of the life of a commercial truck driver is one of excitement, travel and freedom. It is also mostly wrong. Heavy truck driving is difficult, exacting, often dangerous work. This paper details some of the hazards which face the person behind the wheel, and some approaches to improving that unique workplace. 1981 SA E Transactions 810224. Predictions of In-Cylinder Swirl Velocity and Turbulence Intensity for an Open Chamber Cup in Piston Engine. C. Borgnakke, Mechanical Engineering Dept., Univ. of Michigan; G. C. Davis and R. J. Tabaczynski, Engineering and Research Staff, Ford Motor Co. A flow model is presented that predicts the swirl and turbulent velocities in an open chamber, cup-in-piston I.C. engine. The swirl model is based on an integral formu- lation of the angular momentum equation solved with as assumed tangential velocity profile form, V/r). This enables the swirl model to predict a non-solid body rotation which is a function of the inlet flow, wall shear and squish motion during the engine cycle. The mean flow model is coupled with a global K-e model which together predict shear stresses, mixing rates and heat transfer coefficients. An integrated form of the K-c turbulence model is used which includes the com- pressibility, shear and boundary layer effects. Turbulence generated by the inlet flow is included and assumed to be proportional to the velocity past the intake valve. Also, the production of turbulence due to the boundary layer effects are included. The resulting model is compared with experimental data over a range of engine intake port and combustion chamber configurations. For the cup-in-piston geometry, an extensive study is made of the swirl level as a function 50</page><page sequence="32">810225-810230 of piston cup dimensions and compared with available data. Comparison of the total in-cylinder angular mo- mentum, tangential velocity profiles and turbulence with experimental measurements show that the present model is superior to the standard solid-body rotation model. 1981 SA E Transactions 810225. Multidimensional Modeling Applied to the Di- rect-Injection Stratified-Charge Engine - Calcu- lation versus Experiment. Ramachandra Diwakar, Engine Research Dept., General Mo- tors Research Labs. A new multidimensional model was evaluated by com- paring calculated results with experimental data from a Direct-Injection Stratified-Charge (DISC) engine. Axi- symmetric flow, adiabatic walls, and simplified turbu- lence, ignition and chemistry models were assumed in the model. A gaseous fuel jet was used to simulate the liquid spray in the engine. For variations in spark timing, agreement between model and experiment was good for trends in cylinder pressures, and in HC and NOx emissions. 810226. Stroboscopie Laser Shadowgraph Study of the Effect of Swirl on Homogeneous Combustion in a Spark-Ignition Engine. Peter O. Witze, Combus- tion Applications Div., Sandia National Labo- ratories; and Fernando R. Vilchis, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, Massachusetts Insti- tute of Technology. A photographic study is presented illustrating the influ- ence of mixture motion in flame propagation in an internal combustion engine. Variation in swirl and turbulence levels was achieved by rotating the orientation of a shroud on the intake valve. Laser Doppler veloci- metry was used to characterize the precombustion fluid motion. A flexible shadowgraph system was developed for visualizing in-cylinder events. The results show that cyclic variation is not necessarily decreased by increasing the burn rate. The fastest burn achieved in this study occurred with high swirl, when the flame remained attached to the spark plug. If random detachment of the flame occurred, however, cyclic variation was greatly enhanced. 1981 SA E Transactions 810227. Temperature and Concentration Measurements by CARS Spectroscopy in a Firing Single- Cylinder Engine. David Klick, K. A. Marko and Lajos Rimai, Engineering and Research Staff, Research, Ford Motor Co., Dearborn, MI. Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Spectroscopy (CARS) has been applied to a laboratory benchtop engine. Post- combustion spectra were obtained which allowed deter- minations of the local gas temperature with 50°C accuracy. These spectra also provided species concen- tration information on the combustion intermediates carbon monoxide and molecular hydrogen. Broadband spectra were collected in a single laser pulse, lasting KT8 seconds, and arose from a sampled volume of less than 1 mm3. In light of the cycle-to-cycle fluctuations and spatial inhomogeneities found in piston engines, the excellent time and space resolution displayed by the broadband CARS effect are shown to be advantageous for engine work. CARS and other laser techniques are compared as to their potential for nonintrusive measurements in I.C. engines. Finally, recent advances in CARS experimen- tation are presented. 810228. Structural Optimization with Alternate Materi- als - Minimum Mass Design of the Primary Structure. Peter A. Fenyes, Engineering Me- chanics Dept., General Motors Research Lab- oratories, Warren, MI. This study investigates the mass reduction potential of various materials which could be used in the primary structure of a front-wheel drive compact car. An in-house structural optimization computer program produced alternate designs with mild steel, HSLA steel and aluminum, as well as continuous fiber graphite-epoxy and glass-epoxy composites. For each alternate material, the design was optimized to find a minimum mass structure which would satisfy the comprehensive set of design criteria. Compared to the baseline design at 106 kg, structures made entirely with HSLA steel, aluminum, or graphite-epoxy reduced the mass by 15 percent, 26 percent, and 60 percent, respectively. An algorithm for selective replacement of strength constrained members with alternate high strength mate- rials was developed and evaluated. 1981 SA E Transactions 810229. Potential Mass Reduction and Material Cost Penalties of Body Panels with Alternate Mate- rials. David C. Chang, Kuang-Ming Wu and John R. Velia, Engineering Mechanics Dept., General Motors Research Laboratories, Warren, MI. This paper describes alternate material designs of body panels for a front-wheel drive compact car. The results identify the potential mass savings and the corresponding material cost penalties for all the body panels when composite materials suitable for high-volume production (glass-SMC and carbon-SMC) and aluminum are substi- tuted for mild steel. 1981 SA E Transactions 810230. Panel Optimization Program (POP). A. V. Vadhavkar, M. G. Fecek, V. C. Shah and W. E. Swenson, Materials Engineering, Chrysler Corp. The most effective time to optimize an automotive body panel is early in its development. A full size clay model is one of these initial stages. 51</page><page sequence="33">810231-810235 The computer program developed minimizes the panel thickness and still maintains corporate quality levels. Stiffness, dent resistance, oil canning, and springback are the corporate quality requirements considered in this analysis. The program also generates weight and cost ratios for alternate material comparisons. This technique will not only reduce cost and weight, but also help guarantee customer satisfaction. 1981 SAE Transactions 810231. Materials for the Calspan/Chrysler Research Safety Vehicle (RSV). G. J. Fabian, Calspan Corp. The objective of the Research Safety Vehicle (RSV) program was to provide research and test data applicable to the automobile safety performance requirements for the mid 1980s and to evaluate the compatibility of those requirements with environmental policies, efficient energy utilization and consumer economic considerations. It was recognized that factors extending well beyond a strict consideration of safety were to be investigated in the performance of the program. Although protection of vehicle occupants and pedestrians was a major concern, the RSV was to be an efficient vehicle in the transpor- tation system. It was clear that the RSV had to include careful consideration of energy, environmental and economic factors in order to provide valid and meaningful data to support Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards for the mid-1980s. Consequently, materials for the RSV were selected not only because of their ability to provide the desired physical performance but also because they could do it at a minimum cost in terms of resource depletion and energy requirements both during manu- facture and throughout the car's life. 1981 SAE Transactions 810232. Crush Strength Analysis of Lightweight Vehicle Frame Components. C. M. Ni, Engineering Mechanics Dept., General Motors Research Laboratories, Warren, MI. An analytical technique is presented in this paper to analyze the crush strength (or force-deflection curve) of lightweight vehicle frame components which are made of: 1) high-strength steel, 2) aluminum alloy, and 3) fiber- reinforced composite. Experimental data are also in- cluded. It has been found that plastic flow of material and local buckling of sections are the key factors influencing the crush strength of metal structures, while elastic modulus and fracture strain are the dominant factors for fiber-reinforced composites such as glass-polyester and graphite-epoxy in their crush strength. High-strength steel and aluminum alloy offer the best alternatives to mild steel in terms of meeting the required crush strength with maximum weight savings. For a given design peak force, use of fiber-reinforced composites can generally result in significant weight savings. However, when the energy absorption capability is concerned, fiber-reinforced composites such as glass-polyester and graphite-epoxy used in this particular frame application are not as efficient as their metal counterparts due to their brittle fractures at low strength values. 1981 SAE Transactions 810233. Energy Absorption of Glass Polyester Structures. Paul A. Kirsch and Herbert A. Jahnle, The Budd Co. Technical Center. There have been a large number of investigations of passenger vehicle crashworthiness in recent years. Many of these studies have utilized low carbon steel as the primary material of vehicle construction. Because of the ongoing effort to produce lighter, more fuel efficient vehicles, alternate materials, such as HSLA steels, alu- minum alloys, and glass reinforced plastics (GFRP), are being considered to replace low carbon steel. However, the question arises as to how these alternate materials perform during high speed collisions. This study, con- ducted in two parts, was directed toward the charac- terization of glass fiber reinforced polyesters and their ability to absorb crash energy. The first part of the study entailed evaluating the crushing characteristics of various hand lay-up and commercially available GFRP samples. The second part of the study used compression molded low profile sheet molding compound (SMC) material for the crushing samples. Evaluation of foam filled samples was also performed in each half of the study. 810234. Material and Design Interactions in Collision Energy Management. Bernard S. Levy, Inland Steel Co. Conventional analysis of energy management works with force, velocity, vehicle mass, and time. The purpose of this paper is to view energy management by analyzing how the material in the structure absorbs energy. To supplement the analysis, strain rate sensitivity data on a variety of mild and high-strength cold-rolled steels are presented and the implications of the results analyzed. Other results from the literature are also discussed. 1981 SAE Transactions 810235. Strain-Rate Sensitivity and Energy Absorption of Hot-Rolled Sheets of DQSK, USS EX-TEN F509 and USS Dual Phase 80 Steels. C. C. Skena, United States Steel Corporation, Research Lab- oratory, Monroeville, PA. The effect of strain rate (è) on the tensile properties of steel sheets indicate that strength increased with increas- ing è, whereas total elongation, work-hardening exponent, and energy absorption went through minima in the c range of 0.01 to 0.20 sec-1. Possibly sheet formability may improve with increasing e above the minima. The c hardening exponents (M values) were shown to be highest at low strains but most conveniently determined at 52</page><page sequence="34">810236-810241 maximum load at which the DQSK, EX-TEN F50, and Dual Phase 80 steels had M values of 0.011, 0.006, and 0.008, respectively. Postuniform elongation was found to vary directly with M value. Energy absorption by the Dual Phase 80 steel was significantly greater than that of the DQSK and EX-TEN F50 steels, suggesting that the highly formable Dual Phase 80 steel can be used advantageously in energy-management systems to increase occupant protection in automobile crashes. 1981 SA E Transactions 810236. The Future of P/M in Automobiles. C. Robert Talmage, Applied Powder Metallurgy, Inc. The famous Model T Ford produced a revolution in its day due to very advanced metallurgical thinking by four engineers. Such thinking is necessary today to advance the impending and greater revolution possible with Powder Metallurgy. By designing different major components for the various production systems possible today with P/M many savings of energy, materials, equipment and costs are feasible. The potential for some present and future developments are discussed. 810237. Sintered Materials with New Concept for Valve Seats - With and without Cobalt. Tohru Nakata, Tadao Hay asaka, Hiroyuki Endoh and Osamu Miyamoto, Hitachi Powdered Metals Co., Ltd. (Japan). We applied the new sintered materials "Dispersed hard- ening alloy" to valve seats for passenger car's engines. The feature of this new type of materials is that they have many hard dispersed particles consisting intermetallic compound in their relatively soft matrixes. The evaluation was done by actual engines and we found that hard particles assured the good performance of valve seats and did not cause wear to valve faces. Moreover with this new concept the production of valve seats without cobalt can be achieved. 810238. Cylinder Liner Made by P/M-Technique. Ola Pettersson, Cold Isostatic Press Systems KB. AB Carbox in Sweden, together with Höganäs AB and a large manufacturer of cylinder liners, has been working since 1975 on the development of a new method to manufacture cylinder liners in sponge iron for combustion engines. Utilization of the P/M process has resulted in a 20-40% cost savings when comparing P/M liners to cast iron liners. A highly mechanized and modern manufac- turing method, the P/M process can be adopted for the welfare of labor and the environment. 810239. A Comparison of the Magnetic Properties of Hot Repressed and 7.4 g/cm3 Iron and 0.45% Phos- phorus Iron Cores. Kenneth H. Moyer and George W. Mickle, Hoeganaes Corp., Riverton, NJ. Atomized iron powder was screened to narrow fractions and annealed. Intermetallic Fe3P powder was blended with the fractions to provide an alloy containing 0.45% phosphorus after sintering. Cores were pressed to a density of 7.4 g/cm3 and sintered at temperatures ranging from 1600° F (870°C) to 2600°F (1430°C) in hydrogen. Magnetic properties were determined from the sintered cores and compared with previous properties measured for iron and hot repressed 0.45% phosphorus iron. It was found that the induction at any density level was approximately 500 gausses (0.5 teslas) lower than for iron. Remanent magnetization was influenced by the size of the pores. If pores were large, remanent magnetization was 8 K gausses (0.8 teslas) and increased to 12 K gausses (1.2 teslas) as the pores become finer. Both maximum permeability and the coercive force were improved when 0.45% phosphorus was added. The empirical equations developed for iron could be used to predict the properties of the 0.45% phosphorus iron cores. In the case of maximum permeability, the data points for the 0.45% phosphorus iron fall on the upper two sigma lines of the equation. The data points for induction and coercive force fall upon the equation for iron. Structure sensitive properties are generally improved because liquid phase sintering occurs in the 0.45% phosphorus alloys causing grain growth and purification to occur at lower sintering temperatures than for iron. Resistivity is almost double that of iron at equivalent densities, owing to the addition of 0.45% phosphorus. The effect of the porosity on the phosphorus iron is similar to that upon iron. 1981 SAE Transactions 810240. Superproductivity thru Metal Injection Molding. A New Parts Production Process. Raymond E. Wiech, Jr. and I. J. Weisenberg, Witec Cali- fornia Inc. Recently, a new parts production process has emerged from the laboratory to be included with machining, stamping, and forging techniques. This new process begins with conventional plastic injection molding equipment, and through subsequent steps, results in mass production of high-strength, near-ultimate density metal and ceramic parts. It is similar to, yet distinctly different from, conventional powder metallurgy fabrication. The infor- mation presented in this paper reviews the development of the technique in addition to describing the production equipment and currently available materials. 810241. Liquid Phase Compacting. S. K. Suh and S. M. Kaufman, Ford Motor Co., Research Staff. Iron powders were warm compacted in air utilizing liquid tin as a lubricant. Liquid tin functioned effectively as a lubricant over the entire range of compacting pressures examined (207-414 MPa). Under equivalent conditions, at compacting pressures of 414 MPa (30 tsi), liquid tin was shown to have lubricity comparable to zinc stearate. 53</page><page sequence="35">810242-810248 Liquid tin was found to be most effective as a lubricant when present in low concentrations (less than 5%, by weight) and when subjected to high compacting pressures. Lubricant removal, prior to sintering, was unnecessary since solution of tin in iron caused no apparent impair- ment to strength. Solution rates of tin in iron were sufficiently rapid to be capable of saturating iron with tin at 1 121 °C within 30 minutes. Grain growth and shrinkage during sintering were enhanced by the presence of tin. 1981 SA E Transactions 810242. High Strength Sintered Steels Containing Chro- mium and Manganese. J.Tengzelius, C.-A. Biànde and G. Wastenson, Höganäs AB (Sweden). By replacing Ni and Mo as alloying elements in sintered steels with Cr and Mn it is possible to achieve high strength at a lower cost for the raw material. Powder compacts containing these elements must however be sintered at high temperatures (around 1250°C) to prevent oxidation. An even carbon content in the sintered parts is reached simply by covering the sintering box with a lid. After single pressing and single sintering at 1250°C for 30 minutes a material containing 1.5% Cr, 0.5% Cu and 0.7% C reaches a tensile strength above 700 N/mm2 and a very small dimensional change (-0.07%) almost independent of the eventual scatter of the carbon content. In order to combine high strength and dimensional precision in the sintered parts the amount and type of alloying additive must be correctly chosen. 810243. Mechanical Properties of Powder Forged 4100 and 1500 Type Alloy Steels. Joel M. Neiderman, Hoeganaes Corp., Riverton, NJ. The use of chromium and manganese as alloying addi- tions to water atomized steels is possible, provided the manganese and chromium oxides that are formed during the powder production are reduced prior to forging the sintered preform. One way of reducing the chromium and manganese oxides is through the use of high temperature sintering; that is, sintering at temperatures in excess of 1204°C. Utilizing a sintering temperature of either 1260°C or 1315°C, lowers the residual oxygen contents of the 4100 and 1500 type powders to approximately 500 ppm and 400 ppm, respectively. At these low levels of residual oxygen content, the Charpy impact toughness of the chromium- manganese and manganese alloy steels is comparable to the Charpy toughness of the commercially available nickel-molybdenum alloy powder steels. One advantage to the use of high temperature sintering is the ability to shorten the sintering cycle from 30 minutes normally utilized at 1120°C to 5 to 10 minutes at either 1260°C or 1315°C. This shortened sintering time can result in reduced sintering cost. The reduced sintering cost coupled with the lower cost of the chromium and manganese alloying elements result in a significant cost savings when compared to the nickel-molybdenum powder steels. 810244. Computer-Aided Design of Preforms for Powder Forging. Suresh Pillay, TRW Materials Tech- nology, Cleveland, OH; and Howard A. Kuhn, Materials and Metallurgical Engrg., Univ. of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA. An interactive computer-aided design technique has been developed which embodies design rules established from previous experience and experimental studies for the rapid design of powder preforms. Geometrical details of the part are first input along with a schematic sub-division into regions. Trial preform shapes are then input for each region and these are evaluated, using the preform design rules, for metal flow consistency, fracture and densifica- tion. Upon successful design, the overall preform is assembled and displayed on a graphics terminal or in the form of digital information for preform die fabrication. Application of this procedure is demonstrated through an actual component. 1981 SA E Transactions 810245. Powder Metal Sintering With a Nitrogen- Methanol Atmosphere. G. W. Gaines and R. H. Kohler, Union Carbide Corp. Most powder metal part manufacturers use endothermic atmospheres in the sintering of parts. The natural gas crisis resulted in problems for endo users and began a search for alternative atmospheres. This search led to Union Carbide's atmosphere system which is more than an acceptable substitute for endothermic atmospheres. The material presented deals with results of the Union Carbide process, discusses the production increase, and presents economic comparisons with endo. 810246. Machinability Studies with Sintered Ferrous Alloys. Joseph M. Capus, Quebec Metal Pow- ders Ltd., Sorel, Quebec (Canada). The use of additives to improve the machinability of powder metal parts is discussed. It is concluded that no single additive has yet been identified satisfying all requirements in relation to cost, toxicity, effectiveness, and influence on sintered strength. The significant influence of mix composition (copper and graphite levels) on machinability is illustrated by drilling force measurements. Elemental manganese addi- tions were found to be beneficial provided graphite content did not exceed 0.6%. 810248. (SP-480) Alternative Fuels in Diesel Engines - A Review. C. D. Wood, Southwest Research Insti- tute. A wide range of fuels, from hydrogen to slurries, has been tested in diesel engines. This paper reviews test results and concludes that the diesel engine has an extraordinary capability to burn efficiently a wide range of fuel types. The problems of engine durability with such fuels now need to be addressed. Even though the diesel engine has been developed to 54</page><page sequence="36">810249-810253 its current high level of efficiency and durability using closely-specified distillate fuels, it was originally conceived as an engine to be used with cheap, low-grade fuels. We are now faced with the possibility that declining petro- leum stocks may require maximum exploitation of the fuel tolerance of the diesel engine. This paper will review the performance of various diesel engines burning a range of fuels. The literature on this subject is very extensive, and this paper is not an exhaustive review. The intent is, rather, to examine performance using fuels as diverse as possible, in order to define better the degree of engine fuel tolerance and the type of engine modifications necessary. 810249. (SP-480) Ignition Improvers for Ethanol Fuels. Ansgar J. Schaefer and Horst O. Hardenberg, Daimler-Benz AG (Stuttgart, Germany). To facilitate the use of ethanol as a fuel for unmodified conventional diesel engines, ignition-improving additives are needed which in the case described (Brazil) preferably should be based on renewable raw materials, i.e. biomass. While members of very different substance groups are known to be reactive on conventional diesel fuels, in alcohols only nitrates seem to have a remarkable ignition- improving effect. Within the nitrates investigated, cor- relations between reactivity and certain physico-chemical properties (molecular weight, oxygen balance) could be established which indicate the way to even more effective ignition improvers to be developed. 1981 SA E Transactions 810250. (SP-480) Multi-Cylinder Diesel Engine Tests with Unstabilized Water-in-Fuel Emulsions. C. W. Coon, Jr., Southwest Research Institute. Two diesel engines representative of the four-stroke cycle and two-stroke cycle main propulsion units installed in U.S. Coast Guard WPB class vessels were operated in a test environment in an attempt to demonstrate significant fuel savings associated with water-in-fuel emulsions. A prototype fuel system was assembled that would supply unstabilized emulsions for which the water concentration could range from zero to 25% of the total volume of liquid supplied to the engine as fuel. The test results for the four-stroke cycle engine indicated that an average diesel fuel savings of about 2.5% could be obtained at the most frequently encountered operating conditions using water concentrations of 15- 25%. For the two-stroke cycle engine, no significant reduction in fuel consumption could be identified. Based upon the results obtained, it was concluded that water-in-fuel emulsions of the type utilized did not offer an advantage to USCG cutter operations. 810251. (SP-480) A Study of Fuel Nitrogen Conversion, Performance, and Emission Characteristics of Blended SCR-II in a High-Speed Diesel Engine. Chieh-Shen Lin, Industrial Technology Re- search Institute (Taiwan); and David E. Foster, Univ. of Wisconsin-Madison. Engine operation with blended SRC-II and pyridine doped diesel fuel was compared relative to regular #2 diesel fuel in a 4-stroke, turbocharged, direct injection, high speed commercial diesel engine. The brake specific fuel consumption, (M-Joule/hp-hr), turbocharging, combustion characteristics and smoke did not change between blended SRC-II and regular #2 diesel fuel. This was expected since the sample fuels were blended to be of the same cetane number. The maximum torque, hydrocarbon and NOx emissions were higher for blended SRC-II. There was essentially no difference in the NOx measurements of the pyridine doped fuel and regular #2 diesel fuel. The NOx emission increase for the blended SRC-II is believed to be caused by the increased aromatic content of the blended SRC-II and not the fuel nitrogen conversion. 810252. (SP-480) Dual Fueling of a Two-Stroke Loco- motive Engine with Alternate Fuels. J. O. Stor- ment and Q. A. Baker, Southwest Research Institute. A two-cylinder, two-stroke cycle medium-speed locomo- tive engine was operated in a dual-fuel mode with either methanol, high aromatic naptha (HAN), or SRC II (solvent-refined coal) synthetic fuel as primary fuel, and with pilot injection of diesel fuel for ignition. Experi- mental variables included injection timing of both primary and pilot fuels, ratio of primary fuel to pilot fuel, and engine speed and power output. The effect of these variables upon engine thermal efficiency, horsepower, ignition delay, cylinder pressure (knock), and exhaust smoke was determined. Areas of the dual-fueling tech- nique which required modification and optimization were defined. 810253. (SP-480) Performance of a Diesel Engine Op- erating on Raw Coal-Diesel Fuel Slurries. H. P. Marshall, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State Univ., S. M. Bhat, Aerofin, Inc., S. T. Mulvaney, Gulf Research &amp; Development Co.; and J. F. Sevelli, G. E. Gas Turbine Div. Performance tests at full rack and 1400 rpm using a single cylinder diesel engine were made to determine the effects of three different micronized coal-fuel oil slurries being considered as alternative fuels. Slurries containing 20, 32, and 40 percent by weight micronized raw coal in No. 2 fuel oil were used. Results are presented indicating the changes in the fuel flow rates, concentrations of SOx and NOx in the exhaust, exhaust opacity, power and efficiency, and in wear rates relative to operation on fuel oil No. 2. The engine was operated for 10 hrs. on all fuels except the 40% by weight slurry. This test was discontinued because of extremely poor performance. Results indicate that the 55</page><page sequence="37">810254-810259 coal is largely inert in this situation and will cause a net increase in oil used and very rapid wear. 810254. (SP-480) Use of Alcohol-in-Diese! Fuel Emul- sions and Solutions in a Medium-Speed Diesel Engine. Quentin A. Baker, Southwest Research Institute. The use of alcohol as a supplemental fuel for a medium- speed diesel engine was investigated using a two-cylinder, two-stroke test engine. Both stabilized and unstabilized emulsions of methanol-in-diesel fuel and ethanol-in-diesel fuel were tested. Also, anhydrous ethanol/diesel fuel solutions were evaluated. Maximum alcohol content of the emulsions and solutions was limited by engine knocking due to a reduction in fuel cetane number. Engine power and thermal efficiency were slightly below baseline diesel fuel levels in the high and mid-speed ranges, but were somewhat improved at low speeds during tests of the unstabilized emulsions and the ethanol solutions. How- ever, thermal efficiency of the stabilized emulsions fell below baseline levels at virtually all conditions. 810255. (SP-484) Air Motion and Its Effect on Diesel Performance and Emissions. M. L. Monaghan and H. F. Pettifer, Ricardo Consulting Engi- neers Ltd. Conventional instrumentation, a laser doppler velocimeter and a constant temperature hot wire anemometer were used to characterize the air flow produced by a number of inlet ports typical of those used in open chamber diesel engines. In particular, directed and helical ports were included. The same ports were fitted to a motored single cylinder engine and the air motion characteristics were mapped over the speed range of the engine within the bowl and within the cylinder throughout the engine operating cycle. A comparison of the measured results from the motored engine tests and predictions based upon the steady flow results using conventional instrumentation was made. Performance tests with a single cylinder engine fitted with the same ports were carried out to determine whether or not the induction system influenced the performance of the engine in the way it generated bulk swirl or by any other property of air motion. 1981 SAE Transactions 810256. (SP-484) Optimization of the Differential Com- pound Engine Using Microprocessor Control. F. J. Wallace and R. M. Kimber, School of Engineering, Univ. of Bath. The paper describes further work on the differential compound engine (DCE) which, following earlier theo- retical work on the feasibility of multi-variable control is now being converted to microprocessor controlled con- tinuous optimization for minimum fuel consumption for any demanded combination of output shaft conditions. The controlled variables on this integrated compounded engine transmission system include: i) engine governor set point ii) geared turbine nozzle angle iii) engine bypass setting and, additionally, in a system yet to be developed, but already theoretically investigated, fuel injection timing and duration. The paper describes the experimental and analytical procedures, using a programmable high response hydro- static dynamometer, for establishing the 3-dimensional control surfaces for the above 3 variables, and the subsequent implementation of a microprocessor con- trolled system. 810257. (SP-484) Total Cylinder Sampling from a Diesel Engine. G. H. Hedding, D. B. Kittleson, H. Scherrer and X. Liu, Dept. of Mechanical Engrg., Univ. of Minnesota; and D. F. Dolan, Gesamthochschule Duisburg (Duisburg, West Germany). A dumping apparatus has been developed and tested for total cylinder sampling from an indirect injection diesel engine. The apparatus design is described in detail along with the experimental system. The system performance is given for one engine operating condition. Graphs of main chamber and prechamber pressures versus crankangle are also included. The system demonstrated a sampling accuracy of ±2 degrees of crankangle. 810258. (SP-484) Electronic Fuel Injection Equipment for Controlled Combustion in Diesel Engines. R. K. Cross, SGRD Ltd. (London); P. Lakra, Lucas CAV Ltd. (London); and C. G. O'Neill, Physics International Co., San Leandro, CA. The development of a versatile diesel fuel injection system for direct injection engines is described, which offers the advantages of full electronic control of injection timing, fuel metering, and injection pressure. Electronic control is inherent and the system is so versatile that fuel quantity and timing may be varied throughout the available range in successive injections. Both piezoelectric and solenoid controlled versions are described, but all present development work is concen- trated on the latter. Two sizes of injectors have been developed with maximum delivery capabilities of 130 mmVinjection and 500 mmVinjection, and both single and multi-cylinder engines have been run. 1981 SAE Transactions 810259. (SP-484) A Photographic and Thermodynamic Study of Diesel Combustion in a Rapid Com- pression Machine. Haruki Kobayashi, Takeyuki Kamimoto and Shin Matsuoka, Tokyo Institute of Technology. A diesel spray and flame in a quiescent atmosphere were 56</page><page sequence="38">810260-810265 realized without interference with combustion chamber walls in a newly constructed rapid compression machine. High speed shadow photography and pressure meas- urement were employed to obtain data for calculating the amount of air en trainmen t into the flame and spray. From a comparison of air entrainment between the flame and spray, it turned out that when ignition delay becomes longer air entrainment into flames is promoted by the thermal expansion of multi-points ignition sources in the central region of the spray. 1981 SA E Transactions 810260. (SP-484) Origins of Diesel Particulate Mass Emission. G. Greeves and C. H. T. Wang, Lucas CAV Ltd. Emissions results are presented from an experimental study of an indirect injection diesel engine. The mass measurements of particulate emission are correlated with the measurements of smoke and HC emission. The correlation provides a less expensive way of carrying out preliminary combustion optimization work. It is con- cluded that practically all of the particulate mass emission is accounted for by: (a) the black smoke or soot formed in the high temperature fuel-rich regions of the diffusion phase of burning, (b) that fraction (about 50%) of the total HC mass emission which condenses at the particulate sampling filter. The total HC mass emission is itself a function of three distinct sources in the combustion process. The understanding gained is then used to define three combustion ideals for optimizing diesel combustion to minimize fuel consumption and emissions of smoke, N02, particulates, HC, CO, odour and noise. 1981 SA E Transactions 810262. (SP-484) Performance and Emissions Charac- teristics of a Naturally Aspirated Diesel Engine with Vegetable Oil Fuels. N. J. Barsic and A. L. Humke, John Deere Product Engineering Cen- ter. The performance and emissions characteristics of a direct injected, naturally aspirated diesel engine operating on 100 percent sunflower oil, 100 percent peanut oil and 50 percent (by volume) mixtures of either sunflower oil or peanut oil with #2 diesel fuel were compared to baseline results using #2 diesel fuel. Without recalibration of the rotary injection pump, the higher fuel densities and viscosities of peanut oil and sunflower oil caused fuel flow and energy delivery increases that yielded power and emissions increases. With the fuel flow adjusted to provide equal fuel energy input, engine power and thermal efficiency decreased slightly, while emissions increased slightly. 1981 SA E Transactions 810263. (SP-484) The Effect of an Oxidation Catalyst on the Physical, Chemical, and Biological Character of Diesel Particulate Emissions. G. Hunter, J. Scholl, F. Hibbler, S. Bagley, D. Leddy, D. Abata and J. Johnson, Michigan Technological Univ. A diesel oxidation catalyst (Engelhard PTX Series) was evaluated on a medium-duty diesel engine (Caterpillar 3208, naturally aspirated, direct injection). Tests were conducted at six modes of the EPA 13 mode heavy-duty cycle to measure the total particulate, soluble organic fraction (SOF), sulfates, NO, N02, NOx and hydrocarbons emitted by the engine with and without the oxidation catalysts. Chemical analysis of the SOF collected was carried out to determine the effects of the catalysts on each of the subfractions composing the SOF. The Ames Salmonella/microsome bioassay was employed to quantify the mutagenic properties of the particulate SOF. Tests results show large increases in the amounts of total particulate and sulfate emissions due to the catalyst while the amounts of SOF are reduced by the catalyst. The amounts of NOx produced with and without the catalyst are similar, but the equivalent N02 emitted with the catalyst installed is increased at most modes. The Ames bioassay results show that the mutagenicity/ g of the SOF increased with the use of the catalyst, but the effect of this increase on revertant emission rates is partially offset by the reduction in mass emission rates of the SOF. 1981 SA E Transactions 810264. (P-91) The Fuel Economy Potential of Heat Engine/Flywheel Hybrid Vehicles. Steve M. Rohde and Neil A. Schilke, Mechanical Re- search Department, General Motors Research Laboratories, Warren, MI. Starting with the tractive energy requirements of vehicles over prescribed driving schedules, the fuel economy potential of idealized heat engine/flywheel hybrid vehicles was established as a function of vehicle characteristics and driveline efficiency. Both passenger cars and busses were considered in this analysis. The calculated idealized hybrid fuel economies were compared with current production vehicle fuel economies and the potential for substantial fuel economy improvement was noted. When the hybrid vehicle is penalized for the initial flywheel-charge energy, the potential economy gains are reduced. The effect of the initial charge energy should not be neglected in passenger car driving schedules. However, the effect is minimal for the urban schedules typical of bus service. 810265. (P-91) Impacts of Use-Pattern on the Design of Electric and Hybrid Vehicles. Andrew F. Burke, Corporate Research and Development, General Electric Co., Schenectady, NY; and Gene E. 57</page><page sequence="39">810266-810273 Smith, Dept. of Mechanical Engrg., Univ. of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI. The statistical character of automobile use is important in determining design requirements for electric/hybrid ve- hicles and potential car buyers whose transportation needs would adequately be met by a specific car design. In addition, auto-use patterns impact user economics and energy used. This paper is concerned with methods to incorporate auto-use statistics into design and simulation procedures. Daily vehicle use is analyzed using a Monte Carlo random trip generator model for various percentiles of car owners based on annual urban mileage. Results are presented in terms of log-probability plots of the daily distance traveled as a function of percent of days or percent of annual miles traveled. Statistical results are used to determine requirements and characteristics for electric and hybrid vehicles. The work reported in this paper was performed on the Near-Term Hybrid Vehicle Program, JPL Contract No. 955190. 810266. (P-91) A Free Piston Engine-Pump for an Automotive Propulsion System. Richard P. Heintz, The Dynasim Co., Kalamazoo, MI. The different approaches to the design of a Stored Energy Automotive Propulsion System are evaluated. As a result, a special kind of Hydraulic System is proposed. This concept uses the reciprocating piston internal combustion engine as the prime mover, but in a radically different form. The essential difference is that the engine crank and rotary shaft are eliminated, and direct hydraulic pumping substituted for the mechanical rotary output. This results in a Free Piston Engine-Pump (FPEP). This paper outlines how the need for an FPEP results from the concept of a Stored Energy Propulsion System. The question of whether the FPEP itself is feasible will be addressed in subsequent papers. 810270. (P-91) The New Breed of Hybrid Vehicles. Vernon P. Roan, Univ. of Florida; and Thomas A. Barber, Jet Propulsion Lab. Using a combination of test results and computer simulations, power and energy requirements for two vehicle types have been projected. These requirements were separated to be provided by two power sources: one for long-term energy and the other for supplementary power for acceleration. On this basis, it is shown that many combinations of sources may be utilized to meet a particular mission. The accompanying fuel is determined on the basis of available energy density, which depends on both the fuel type and the conversion device. 810271. (P-91) Hybrid Vehicles- Costs and Potential. Joel J. Sandberg, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology. Heat engine/electric hybrid passenger vehicles have been shown in five independent studies to have potential for substituting electrical energy for 40% to 80% of the petroleum fuel consumed by conventional ICE passenger vehicles. The hybrids were projected to exceed their conventional counterparts in initial cost (purchase price) by 21% to 62%, but be much more competitive in terms of life-cycle costs: 0-27% greater than the conventional counterparts. Hybrid versus conventional cost compar- isons varied significantly among the five studies. All five found the cost competitiveness of the hybrid to be inversely correlated to its petroleum fuel displacement capability and highly sensitive to petroleum fuel prices with all five selected hybrid designs achieving break-even life-cycle cost at petroleum fuel prices of $2.70 per gallon (in 1978 dollars) or less. 810272. (P-91) Hybrid Vehicle Test Procedure Devel- opment. Marc Trummel and Steve Mazor, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology. Electric hybrid vehicles, because of their multiple energy sources and large varieties of propulsive configurations and control schemes, present a special problem in the development of formalized Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) test procedures. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) is undertaking a task under the Department of Energy (DOE) Hybrid Commercialization Project to develop a draft test procedure with supporting actual test data that will assist the government in the development of a formal EPA test procedure for emissions certification and equivalent fuel economy determination for the possible inclusion of electric hybrid vehicles (EHVS) in corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) allowances. The procedures are being developed by an iterative review process with the interested and affected govern- ment agencies and industrial organizations. Data obtained from testing an EHV at JPL and from the General Electric Near- term Hybrid Vehicle program will be used to support the development and verify the procedure. This paper summarizes the procedure development plan and discusses the impacts and complexities of a variety of factors. A strawman test procedure is developed and discussed. The paper emphasizes the need for interaction and input into the development process by all interested parties. While absolute concensus is not realistic, at least the final procedure must be considered "reasonable" and be understood by all the affected interests. 810273. A Methodology for Evaluation and Optimization of Three-Way Catalyst Based, Low NOx Emis- sion Control Systems. P. N. Blumberg, H. Wu and J. E. Auiler, Ford Motor Co., Engineering and Research Staff, Dearborn, MI. 58</page><page sequence="40">810274-810279 This paper presents a comprehensive and expanded system analysis methodology for evaluation and opti- mization of three-way catalyst (TWC) based, low NOx emission control systems. Its relationship to previous work in engine control optimization is carefully reviewed. The expanded methodology is evolved from a synthesis of procedures, models, and empirical data. These include powertrain simulation, engine mapping data, transient air-fuel ratio analysis, three-way catalyst conversion maps, an oxidation catalyst model, a cold-start emission con- tribution procedure, and a tailpipe emission constraint level optimization of engine calibration. The methodology can be utilized to study the sensitivity of fuel economy and emission control capability to air-fuel control, catalyst activity, cold-start emissions, and hardware configuration. Examples are presented in the paper to illustrate quan- titatively the fuel economy/emissions tradeoffs of 5.0L and 2.3L engine systems as well as effects of transient air-fuel control, cold-start emissions, and catalyst con- figuration on fuel economy. 1981 SA E Transactions 810274. Stoichiometric Air-Fuel Ratio Control Analysis. B. K. Powell, H. Wu and C. F. Aquino, Ford Motor Co. A great deal of current automotive engineering effort involves the development of three-way catalyst-based emission control systems that seek to minimize fuel consumption while simultaneously meeting stringent exhaust emission standards. Mitigation of emissions is enhanced in a three-way catalyst system when the system air-fuel ratio (A/F) is in proximity to ideal burning or stoichiometry. This paper is concerned with extending methods used for determining engine calibrations to closed-loop systems with three-way catalysts. The paper presents a simulation model that employs experimentally obtained data to characterize the A/F control loop. 810275. Three-Way Catalyst Performance Characteriza- tion. Robert H. Hammerle and C. H. Wu, Ford Motor Co. A simplified method was developed to obtain three-way catalyst performance data to be used for predicting vehicle CVS-H emissions. This method involves engine dynamometer aging of catalysts and characterization of their performance as a function of four variables, namely, redox potential, temperature, space velocity and modu- lation parameter. In the process of reducing the number of variables, several simplifications were made. The simpli- fications, their limitations and the characteristic trends in the performance of a 11 Pt/Rh catalyst are discussed. 810276. Time Resolved Measurements of Carbon Mon- oxide in the Exhaust of a Computer Command Controlled Engine. J. A. Sell, R. K. Herz and E. C. Perry, General Motors Research Labs. Carbon monoxide concentrations in the exhaust from an engine operated under Computer Command Control were measured with infrared diode laser spectroscopy. CO levels were measured before and after the catalytic converter for various air-fuel ratios, using two different carburetors and using both analog and digital carburetor controllers. The response time of the spectrometer was 0.025 s, which was fast enough to resolve the rapidly varying CO concentrations. Using signal-averaging tech- niques the CO component was isolated which was due to the modulation of the carburetor's fuel metering rod. A component at the firing frequency of a single cylinder was also isolated; this component results from maldistribution of fuel to the engine's eight cylinders. Fourier transforms of the data yielded relative amplitudes of CO oscillation as a function of frequency. 810277. Fuel Economy Improvement of Rotary Engine by Using Catalyst System. Kenji Shimamura and Tomoo Tadokoro, Toyo Kogyo Co., Ltd. The fuel economy of the Mazda rotary engine was steadily improved through engine modifications and emission control systems refinements. Aiming at further improved fuel economy under the 1981 emission standards, thorough efforts were made to further improve gas sealing and ignition system and also to achieve optimum air fuel mixture. It was found that a new emission control system was desirable to maximize above-mentioned improvements. As a result, a new catalyst system for rotary engine has been established, making a substantial improvement in fuel economy under practical driving conditions. Further fuel economy improvement can be expected in the future mostly because of the catalyst system's flexibility for engine modifications. 1981 SA E Transactions 810278. Microprocessor Applications in Vehicle Emissions Testing. Mohammed I. Malik, Joseph T. Yakas and Walter J. Niewierski, Ford Motor Co. The flexibility, high performance, and cost benefits of microprocessors have been effectively applied to the field of automotive emissions testing. This paper describes the use of microprocessors in drivers aid, SHED testing, dynamometer coastdown calibration and vehicle storage techniques. The successful implementation of microcomputers into emissions measurement systems have provided the automotive industry with a cost-effective, powerful and dependable tool for use in meeting the increasingly stringent emissions and fuel economy testing requirements for the 80's and beyond. 810279. CARDIFF - A Calibration Method for Mechan- ical Dynamometers. Z. Rauker, Ford Motor Co. 59</page><page sequence="41">810280-810286 A new method, CARDIFF, has been developed for calibrating chassis dynamometers. This method is based upon the determination of the frictional losses attributable to each inertia flywheel of the dynamometer system. Frictional losses for any inertia combination are found by the summation of individual flywheel contributions. The dynamometer load setting, which is critical for emissions and fuel economy testing, is simply obtained by sub- tracting these losses from the required actual horsepower. This method increases testing efficiency by reducing the calibration time by approximately 75% as compared to the generic procedure defined in the Federal Register. 810280. Impact of Low Ambient Temperature on 3-Way Catalyst Car Emissions. James N. Braddock, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Mobile Sources Emissions Research Branch, Research Triangle Park, NC. Regulated and unregulated exhaust emissions from four late model 3-way catalyst passenger cars were measured over the urban dynamometer driving schedule of the Federal Test Procedure as a function of ambient tem- perature (50°F-81°F). Fuel economy, regulated emissions HC, CO, NOx, and unregulated emissions NH3, HCN, N20, CH4, COS, H2S, S02, S04, and C6H6 were studied. It was found that reduced ambient temperature operation «68 °F) significantly increased the regulated emissions HC and CO, and slightly increased several unregulated emissions. Within the limitations of this study, none of the unregulated emissions were emitted at concentrations that could be considered hazardous to the public. 810282. The Design of a Road and Rail Simulator. Frederick H. Hull, The Budd Co. Technical Center. The design and construction of a road and rail simulator for the dynamic testing of automobiles, trucks, trailers and railcars is described. The vibration test facility features a 1.3 million pound (600,000 Kg) seismic mass supported on airmounts. Specimens up to 100,000 pounds (45,000 Kg) can be mounted at floor level on six hydraulic actuators with force ratings of ± 200,000 pounds (900 kilo Newtons) vertically, and ± 1 10,000 pounds (490 kilo Newtons) horizontally. The six channels of actuators are program- mable and can be run closed loop with tapes derived from field input data. 135 channels of static data and 30 channels of dynamic data can be recorded and manip- ulated. 810283. Rail Transit Simulation. Ed A. Gausewitz and Ron C. Bendrey, Ford Motor Co. The design and construction of the rail transit simulator for the dynamic testing of automobiles, trucks and components is described. The test facility features seven servo-controlled hydraulic actuators, along with associ- ated electronics to simulate vehicle environmental con- ditions during rail shipment. This ability to simulate the shipping environment in the laboratory has effectively reduced the cost and the time required to evaluate designs. 810284. The Development of Criteria for a New Wheel and Hub Road Simulator. M. Robert Baren and Frederick H. Hull, The Budd Co., Technical Center, Ft. Washington, PA. More stringent requirements for reliability of truck wheels and hubs have increased the demand for faster and more realistic testing. The test program described in this paper was designed to obtain sufficient information to define the criteria for the design and construction of a program- mable road simulator specifically for truck wheels and hubs. An instrumented wheel, hub and axle were tested in a normal road environment and on a proving ground. The results, in the form of strains, were compared to those obtained from laboratory Bull Wheel and cornering load tests. From this data and from static tests, actuator sizes, maximum frequency and displacements, number of degrees of freedom, horsepower requirements, rotation speeds and other pertinent road simulator design criteria have been selected. 810285. Conceptual Development and Design of the Turbine Engine Loads Simulator. Robert D. Week, Paul B. Hasselquist and Thomas G. Moll, FluiDyne Engineering Corp., Minneapolis, MN. This paper describes the conceptual development and design of a large centrifuge test facility to simulate high manuevering loads (both inertial and gyroscopic) on an operating turbine engine. The maximum gravitational loads (15 g) occur at the end of a 40 ft (12.2 m) arm rotating at 33 rpm. A gimbal assembly supports the engine and can roll, pitch, or yaw the engine to induce loads in the desired direction. The U.S. Air Force plans to construct the Turbine Engine Loads Simulator (TELS) at the Arnold Engineering Development Center, Tennessee. This paper discusses four principal areas of the TELS conceptual development and design: structural arrange- ment, method of analysis, standard component appli- cation, and instrumentation. 1981 SA E Transactions 810286.

A new 10 cell engine dynamometer complex, which provides optimized testing and development capacity for new lines of automotive power plants for the 1980's and beyond, has been built at Chrysler's Engineering Center. This modern facility combines "state-of-the-art" instru- mentation for control, data gathering, and data analysis with new operating concepts which together allow for high levels of accuracy, repeatability, and productivity pre- viously not attainable in the area of engine testing and development. 60</page><page sequence="42">810287-810294 810287.

The technological, economic and human engineering aspects of data acquisition system development are discussed using the configuration of a microcomputer based gas compressor data acquisition facility as an example. The system described includes features common to other systems with a wide variety of applications and complexity including real time data acquisition with background data reduction, serial line communication with peripheral devices and other computers as well as IEEE standard 488 bus control of laboratory devices. Foreground operation of the data acquisition software allows for simultaneous machinery protection surveillance and compressor performance parameter data reduction. Data output is available in either graphical or tabular form on the system CRT and printer. 1981 SA E Transactions 810288. Climate Chamber Dynamometer. Brian Morgan and Ken Prest, Consine Dynamics Ltd.; and David Dundas, Esso Petroleum Co. Ltd. A special dynamometer system has been developed which in one machine incorporates the capability of two or more dynamometer systems by permitting accurate testing of motor vehicles within an inertia range of 1500 to 7500 lbs. equivalent vehicle mass, with tractive efforts up to 10,000 N. The unique load measurement system incorporating load platforms which measure tractive effort at the vehicle wheels, permits accurate simulation over this very wide range. Twelve months of usage for driveability and lubricant tests have provided accurate results within a wide range of climatic conditions. 810290. A Study on Boot Seals for Rack and Pinion Gear of Automotive Steering. Kenichi Terai, Kyojiro Okabe, Shinji Ito and Hiroshi Hirabayashi, Nippon Oil Seal Industry Co., Ltd. (Japan); and Akira Matsushima, NOK, Inc., U.S.A. Types of boot seals for rack and pinion gear of automotive steering and their characteristics are given, and necessary items for designing seals are clarified based on exper- iments and experiences upon required performances of products. 810291. More Effective Rotary Shaft Seals through Energy Saving. Volkmar Otto, Goetze AG (Germany). The power loss of a rotary shaft seal influences the endurance lifetime. It is determined in particular by the radial force, an important feature of rotary shaft seals. Decreasing radial force results in increased endurance life by reducing power loss and self-heat-generation. The comparison of seals from 1940, with those of 1980 shows the success which has been achieved as well as the possibilities for the future. The measures for the reduction of power loss have been included. 1981 SA E Transactions 810292. Long-Term Behaviour of Valve Stem Seals in Otto and Diesel Engines. Hans Deuring, Rubber Products, Goetze AG (West Germany). In order to reduce oil consumption resulting from leakage via valve guides, spring tensioned lip seals are applied. By the choice of oil side lip contact angle, degree of garter spring leverage, radial sealing force, and surface roughness of the valve stem, the metered oil leakage may be controlled and optimised. The application of an elastomer with greater wear resistance in a Fluoro-polymer basis (FKM) ensures correct functioning over the working life of vehicle engines. 810293. Redundant Linear Seals - A Selection Criterion. Dean Ahlberg, Fluid Power Research Center, Oklahoma State Univ. Leakage from the linear rod seals of hydraulic cylinders may be controlled by placing additional seals downstream of the primary seal and introducing controlled pressure in between the seals. This technique is called the 'biasing method' and was developed at the Fluid Power Research Center at Oklahoma State University (FPRC/OSU). The controlled pressure modifies the distribution of stress in the seal at the rod-seal interface. The result is a modification in the distribution of pressures in the films of leakage fluid which form between the rod-seal interface. By controlling the fluid film pressure distribution, the volumes of leakage fluid which pass between the rod-seal interface may be controlled to any desired extent. The theory behind the biasing method is explained and experimental evidence of its effectiveness in con- trolling external leakage from linear rod seals is presented. 810294. A Study of Fuel Economy in Small, Piston Ported Two-Stroke Engines. Donald L. Margolis, Univ. of California; and Mukesh Saxena, Indian Institute of Petroleum. A previously developed mathematical model of an operating two-stroke engine was modified to predict fresh air/fuel mixture loss through the exhaust port. At some operating conditions, losses as high as 30% of the newly scavenged mixture were predicted. A servovalve is proposed for placement downstream of the exhaust port. By sensing the temperature of the exhaust flow and closing the valve when this temperature falls below some set temperature, the loss in fresh mixture was predicted to be reduced to virtually zero. This was accompanied by an increase in power. 61</page><page sequence="43">810295-810302 810295. Effect of Atmospheric Temperature on the Power Output of a Two-Stroke Cycle Crankcase Com- pression Gasoline Engine. Ichiro Watanabe, Kanto Gakuin Univ. (Yokohama, Japan); and Hiroshi Kuroda, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. (Yoko- suka, Japan). It has been hitherto recognized merely by experience that the power output of a two-stroke cycle crankcase com- pression gasoline engine is inversely proportional to a power exponent larger than 0.5 of the absolute atmos- pheric temperature. To ascertain this effect, a 60 cm3 two-stroke cycle crankcase compression gasoline engine was performance tested at various inlet air temperatures. It was found that the power output varied inversely proportional to a power exponent ranging from 0.5 to 0.9 of the absolute inlet air temperature. This was explainable by the fact that the pressure ratio of the crankcase decreased as the air temperature increased and vice versa. 810296. Reduction of Diesel Idle Knock by EGR. Eiichi Watanabe and Itaru Fukutani, The Institute of Vocational Training (Japan). In order to reduce diesel idle knock, the effects of EGR on the idling characteristics were investigated on three 4-stroke cycle engines having three different combustion chambers (precombustion, swirl and direct injection). It was found that EGR was effective not only for reducing idle knock, but also for decreasing fuel con- sumption, smoke density and exhaust emissions at idling operation regardless of the type of combustion chamber. The same test results were obtained on a crankcase- scavenged 2-stroke cycle diesel engine (direct injection type) by means of inlet throttling. 1981 SA E Transactions 810297. A System for the Modal Analysis of Exhaust Emissions from Motorcycles. Ryuzou Kajikawa and Itsuo Kimura, Honda R&amp;D Co., Ltd. Devices for use in control of exhaust emissions have become indispensable to motorcycles. In order to evaluate quantitatively the effect of each device, the modal analysis system has to be required. The Modal Analysis System is one that classifies any driving schedule which is used for emissions measurement into four modes: idle, acceleration, cruise, and decel- eration; then measures the emissions continuously using a mini-computer which accumulates the results of the analysis by mode. Instead of C02 tracer method, we introduce the method of diluted exhaust gas measurement. In order for the system to produce reliable meas- urements, the accuracy of the total installation must be ensured. This paper describes the improvement of accuracy of analysers, technique on handling delay time and the verifications on the modal analysis system. 1981 SA E Transactions 810298. A New Automotive Air Conditioner Compressor. Herbert G. Siewert, Tecumseh Products Co. Presented are the design goals for the development of an automotive air conditioning compressor. Included is a discussion of how each of these goals have been satisfied in the HR980 compressor design. 810299. Application of Rotary Compressors in Heat Pumps. Dieter Ahrendt, Neumünstersche Maschinenund Apparatebau GmbH. The principle of a heat pump, as well as its basic components, are discussed. Heat pump compressors, based on a rotary piston design such as that used in Wankel engines, are considered in detail - especially since they are adaptable to wide speed ranges at fairly constant efficiencies. Engineering details and future studies are outlined, together with the critical points of heat pumps from a manufacturer's point of view. Con- tinuous operation, rather than "on and off' cycling, as well as good matching of output and heating require- ments, are made possible by this rotary approach. 810300. Rallye Trip Computer. Daniel Jauset, JAEGER, Levallois (France). The use of a trip computer, in large quantity, is more or less new for the normal car, and chiefly for consumption purposes, since a very long time the rallye car men use mechanical devices which make approximatively the job of trip computer for times and speed. The purpose of this paper is a short presentation of these mechanical devices to indicate how they are used during rallye operations, what they bring to the driver or more exactly to the copilote and to introduce what a trip computer equipped with a microprocessor may offer. Finnaly a description of the electronic rallye trip computer designed by our firm, but in accordance with the wishes of the more famous rallye pilot will be undertaken. 810302. The Evolution Towards a New Driver Information System. W. -H. Hucho, VDO Adolf Schindling AG (Schwalbach/Germany). Recent progress in micro-electronics has paved the way for new driver information systems. Driver information is to be improved by quality rather than by quantity. Liquid crystal displays, twisted nematic, are the right choice for vehicular displays. Together with new sensors and elec- tronics they form the basis for a family of instruments, which allows for a rational hierarchy of driver infor- mation. 1981 SA E Transactions 62</page><page sequence="44">810304-810312 810304. New Fuel Level Sensor. Pierre Stofati, Auto- motive Branch JAEGER France. The fuel level gages currently used in the automotive field have not all satisfying performances. The use of board computers now requires precise measurements of the reserve of fuel to be able to calculate the distance it is possible to do. We propose a hot wire gage with better performances (accuracy, linearity, stability, limited space consumption). This gage consists of a highly electrically resistant metal wire vertically stretched in the tank and through which we send periodically a pulse of current. Heating of wire due to current changes when it is submerged or not in the liquid. We shall demonstrate that the difference of the voltage across the terminals of the sensor is proportional to the liquid level. 810305. CMOS Microcomputer Simplifies System De- sign. Peter M. Redford, American Microsystems Inc., Santa Clara, CA. A new CMOS single chip microcomputer with a complete set of system features has been designed. This paper describes the difference between this microcomputer and multi-chip microprocessors. It shows that with the on board analog to digital converter, power-fail detection, interval timer and powerful input/output capability a microcomputer is more suitable for automotive control applications than a microprocessor. 810306. The Genesis of the Cathode Ray Tube as a Vehicular Display Device. Len Dietch and H. Rudolf Zeidler, Zenith Radio Corp., Glenview, IL. The Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) has long been considered for use as a vehicular display device. As time has passed, however, most of the questions or objections about its use have been overcome. With the tendency towards even more highly feature-oriented automobiles in the future, a comparison between the V-CRT and other historically competitive display devices reveals the CRT as an extremely viable alternative in vehicular instrumentation. 810307. A Dedicated Single-Chip Microcomputer for Automotive Dashboard Applications. Rüdiger Müller, Siemens AG, Components Group (Mu- nich/Germany). A single chip microcomputer (SAB 802 15P) for auto- motive dashboard applications will be described. The chip is based on a standard SAB 8021 nucleus and includes as peripheral circuitry an a/d converter, 4, 8 and 12-bit counters, keyboard decoder, display driver and a low power time-of-day-clock plus stopwatch and alarm func- tion. RAM and ROM are extended by a factor of two. Stand-by current drain is less than 5 mA. Possible applications are trip computers, air conditioning and electronic instrumentation. 810308. An Innovative Approach in Designing an Elec- tronic Instrument Cluster. Frederick O. R. Miesterfeld, Chrysler Corp., Detroit, MI. Chrysler Corporation's new 1981 Imperial introduces an unprecedented totally electronic digital instrument cluster, which features five vacuum fluorescent displays and nine low-travel push buttons for function selection. It is the intention of this paper to present the innovative aspects of the Imperial Instrument Cluster design and how Chrysler met the challenges of utilizing electronics in the auto- motive environment. 810310. Link-less Brake Deceleration Sensing Propor- tioning Valve. H. Iwai, H. Takeshita and T. Nagashima, Aisin Seiki Co., Ltd. (Kariya City, Japan). As a means of controlling vehicle brake pressures for varying axle loads and/or vehicle decelerations, link-less brake deceleration sensing valves are being used in addition to fixed split point and link type load sensing proportioning valves. These valves are a means of optimizing the ratio of front-to-rear wheel retarding forces for the full range of vehicle loadings and decelerations thereby improving brake balance and vehicle stability. The object of this paper is to describe a link-less proportioning valve designed and developed for passenger cars and light trucks. Also, included are dynamic simulation and vehicle test results. 1 981 SA E Transactions 810311. Establishment of Vehicle Braking Behavior Pat- terns with Special Reference to U. S. and European Test Procedures. Karlheinz Timtner and Detlev Duchstein, Alfred Teves GmbH (Frankfurt, West Germany). A car's brake has been pertinently termed its "con- science". For a vehicle to have clear conscience would mean that its brake system continues to function perfectly, even after long running periods. This stands specifically for the pads and linings which take direct part in the transformation of energy. For an easier choice regarding temperature-sensitivity a method has been developed to calculate the brake rotor temperature for various driving cycles. Together with the function of the friction coef- ficient which depends on brake rotor temperature it will be shown, using the friction-coefficient-scatter diagram how the sequence of locking might change. It will be explained how an unfavorable choice of pad combinations can adversely affect the braking stability and traffic safety. 1981 SA E Transactions 810312. Brake Test Dynamometer Programme for Europe and the U.S. A. Donald Hatch, Ferodo Ltd. (Assoc. Co. Nuturn U. S. A.). A single headed inertia dynamometer is used to simulate the behaviour of a brake on a vehicle in service. Both 63</page><page sequence="45">810313-810319 American and European styles of driving are adequately represented and the accuracy of the resultant test is such that standard deviation in coefficient of friction is 0.003 and of thickness lost due to wear is 0.0002 inches. Examples of the validity of this test procedure are quoted including the characterization of cast iron rotors, the effects of surface finish and the direction of machining of rotors, measurements of squeal, judder, and of slight misalignment of the brake. The Los Angeles road test is used as a specific example of American practice. 1981 SA E Transactions 810313. Production Testing of Hydraulic Units. G. Schuchmann, Girling Bremsen GmbH (West Germany).

New Pin Slider Disc Brake Designs for Compact U. S. Cars of the 80s. D. Bieraeugel and K. Stoerzel, Alfred Teves GmbH (Frankfurt, West Germany). In the American Automotive Industry, the trend as we enter the 80's is clearly to down-sized cars. Every manufacturer has had to develop and introduce lighter cars with low fuel consumption; some are already in production and offer the American public domestic vehicles which more than compete with the imports which have so dominated the news in recent years. The world-wide energy situation and the initiative of the United States Government to mandate a dramatic series of yearly drops in fuel consumption by means of the Corporate Average Fuel Economy rulings, has helped to further accelerate the move to smaller cars, which are more economical to own and maintain. In the 1976 Chrysler broke new ground with Omni/ Horizon. GM was next in 1979 with its well-received X-Cars. 1981 Model Year saw the eagerly awaited introduction of the Chrysler K-Car and Ford Escort/ Lynx. These two vehicles incorporate the latest front- wheel drive, steering and handling technology and modern diagonally split brake systems. This paper describes a new family of disc brake calipers which were developed for these two models. 810316. Fuel Efficient Motor Oil for Japanese Passenger Cars. Hitoshi Hamaguchi, Yoshihiro Maeda and Tsutomu Maeda, Nippon Mining Co, Ltd., Lubricants and Petroleum Products Laboratory. A series of bench engine tests and field trials have been carried out using Japanese domestic engines and vehicles. Various motor oil viscosity grades were evaluated in order to select the best for fuel savings. A laboratory evaluation to assess friction behavior and antiwear properties was used to select suitable friction modifiers for formulating fuel saving motor oils. In general, higher oil consumption was obtained with lower viscosity oils. In some cases piston and bearing seizure occurred under severe oper- ating conditions. Valve train wear performance of the lubricant appeared to depend mainly on the additive type used. From these experimental studies, it was determined that a viscosity grade of "7.5W-30" was best for fuel efficiency, engine performance and durability in current Japanese vehicles. Fuel efficiency was further improved by incorporating an organic Molybdenum compound as a friction modifier in the formulation. 810317. Testing of Engine Oils Having Carryover Fuel Economy Effects. Walter E. Waddey, Barry C. Deane and Harold Shaub, Products Research Division, Exxon Research and Engineering Co.; and Robert A. Carley, Marketing Technical Services, Exxon Company, U.S.A. Evaluation of the fuel economy characteristics of engine oils requires a rigorous test design. Side-by-side test designs, though adequate for evaluating the control of deposits, wear, and viscosity, require too many cars for precise fuel-economy testing. Crossover, Latin-square, and other balanced-block designs cannot be used if the fuel economy oil shows "carryover" effects; that is, if the engine is conditioned by the fuel economy oil so that subsequent oils still show a residual fuel economy benefit. The most suitable test design is a sequential one. The reference oil is run until it demonstrates a constant level of fuel economy. The test oil is then run for enough miles so that its full effect has been reached. The comparison is made between the two stabilized levels. Examples are given for an SAE 10W-40, API SF oil, which showed a 4 + % fuel economy improvement in both fleet and EPA type chassis-dynamometer sequential-design tests. A "deconditioning oil" technology is currently being evaluated. The fuel economy of a vehicle is determined on a reference oil and a fuel economy oil in a sequential manner. The vehicle is then run for a short period on the deconditioning oil, which removes any friction-reducing films from the rubbing surfaces, and restores the engine to its original reference oil fuel economy level. If successful, this deconditioning technology will greatly reduce the time and cost of fuel economy testing. 810319. Progress in the Development of Modern Ceramic Cutting Tool Materials. E. Dow Whitney, Univ. of Florida.

The close relationship between ce- ramic tool material development and improvement in productivity in the transportation industry is emphasized.

Ceramic-Coated Cutting Tools. T. E. Hale, Carboloy Systems Dept., General Electric Co. A composite cutting tool has been developed consisting of a wear-resistant ceramic coating on a tough, breakage- resistant cemented carbide substrate. Metal-cutting ex- perience shows these tools have an excellent combination of high-speed wear resistance and shock resistance in the low-to-medium speed (300-600 m/min.) end of solid ceramic tool applications. The influence of coating and substrate details upon metal-cutting performance will be presented. 1981 SA E Transactions 810322. Fatal Accident Reporting System. Angeli A. Sebastian, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The purpose of this paper is to describe the Fatal Accident Reporting System (FARS), a data system containing information on all fatal accidents that occur in the U.S. It is maintained by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). In addition, ways in which users may request data and current publications will be discussed. 810323. An Analysis of Fatal Pedestrian Accidents. John W. Garrett, Calspan Field Services, Inc. Fatal accident data discussed in this paper were collected for the Pedestrian Injury Causation Study (PICS), a program supported by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Data were collected in five cities throughout the United States over a period of three years, 1977 to 1980, and consist of over 1,997 accidents, 9.5 percent of which were fatal. Data analysis focuses on those factors which are related primarily to fatal injury sustained in pedestrian accidents. Vehicles involved include only automobiles and light trucks (pickups and vans). Comparisons with non-fatal accidents are also provided to highlight major differences between the two accident categories. Major factors analyzed include impact speed, vehicle type, injury sources, injury severity and type. The role of ground contact and of vehicle components in fatal accidents is evaluated for the various vehicle types included in the data. 810324. Highway Fatal Accidents and Travel Densities. Harold Brodsky, Dept. of Geography, Univ. of Maryland; and A. Shalom Hakkert, Road Safety Center, Israel Institute of Technology. The fatal accident rate on rural highways should theo- retically increase with an increase in travel density. One empirical study of this relationship, however, reported a negative correlation. This correlation is suspect because a common component, vehicle-miles, appears in the de- nominator of fatal accident rate and in the numerator of travel densities. In our paper two alternative methods of correlation were used, but still no evidence for a positive relationship was found. Apparently certain density asso- ciated variables, such as quality of emergency medical service, counteract the theoretically expected trend. 810325. Light Truck FRP Leaf Spring Development. Terry N. Trebilcock and Joseph N. Epel, The Budd Co. The Budd Company designed, prototyped, and labora- tory/field tested a fiberglass leaf spring for a Ford Econoline Van. Prior to design and materials selection, extensive development work was conducted on fiber/resin systems. Computer design programs were written which would accept conventional leaf spring parameters and output nominal stresses, tooling data, and weights for a selection of unidirectional monoleaf configurations. Extensive prototype testing was conducted on a laboratory leaf spring fatigue tester equipped with a simultaneous brake torque simulator (for attachment testing). Field testing was conducted on urban roads and at Ford and G. M. Proving Grounds to correlate materials, design, and laboratory-field data. 810326. Fatigue Consideration in the Design of Auto- motive Composites. P. K. Mallick, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, The Univ. of Mich- igan - Dearborn. Light weight composite materials are being considered in many structural automotive applications such as leaf spring, transmission support member, and wheels. The primary design criteria in all these applications is resistance against fatigue failure. This paper reviews some of the unique features of automotive composites in fatigue loading and discusses their differences with metals, particularly in relation to fatigue crack propagation. Practical consequences of such inherent differences are also discussed. 810328. The Influence of Engine Oil Formulation on the Prevention of Valve Train Wear in Modern European Passenger Cars. D. C. Roberts, Esso Research Centre (Abingdon/England); and M. Tournier, Esso Centre de Recherches, Mont- Saint-Aignan (France). The paper discusses the three principal wear modes that can occur in the valve train of passenger car engines, and the various factors that affect them. It shows how different 65</page><page sequence="47">810329-810336 lubricant components can influence wear and how, by careful selection of the additives and optimization of their treatment level, premium passenger car motor oils of excellent anti-wear performance can be produced meeting the many conflicting requirements of the European car passenger market. 810329. The Use of Surface Layer Activation Wear Monitoring for Filter Design and Evaluation. F. L. Milder and A. J. Armini, Spire Corp., Bedford, MA; and G. W. Jones, Fram Corp., Providence, RI. The surface layer activation technique of wear monitoring was used to evaluate the performance of alternative filter materials and to establish parameters useful for future filter design. Nine engine components were monitored for wear, in situ, during engine tests in which particulate dust was added to the lubrication system. The tests demon- strated that different engine components have (1) differing wear reduction factors upon filtration and (2) wear sensitivities which are a function of particle size. The measured sensitivity functions result in different protec- tion factors for alternative filter media which depend on the engine component being studied. 810330. Engine Oil and Bearing Wear. T. F. Lonstrup and M. F. Smith, Jr., Exxon Chemical Com- pany, Paramins Technology Division, Linden, N.J. The effects on connecting rod bearing wear of several engine oil compositional variables have been studied. A single-cylinder CLR engine installed at Automotive Research Laboratories, Inc., in Chicago has been used to study the effects of viscosity in connecting rod bearing wear for Newtonian lubricants and for a series of non-Newtonian multigrade oils on which previous field test experience was available. The results from this series of experiments showed that in the particular engine and under the conditions used, viscosity had a relatively minor effect on connecting rod bearing wear with the Newtonian oils. With the non-Newtonian multigrade oils the deter- gent inhibitor package showed up as a major variable and it was not possible to segregate the effects of the viscosity improvers used to prepare four test oils from the effects of the detergent system used. Further work showed that the detergent inhibitor effects could be drastically altered by substitution of individual additive components in the test oil. In a second series of data the authors have carefully reviewed connecting rod bearing wear data from two field tests; one reported in the literature and a second test run by the authors' laboratories. Extensive data analysis was done to correlate connecting rod bearing wear (and other engine wear) with normal lube oil compositional variables such as VI shear stability, used oil acidity and used oil insolubles. The best correlation was found between connecting rod bearing wear and pentane insolubles in the first drain of the test. Both these sets of tests indicate an abrasive mechanism as the most likely cause of steady, non-castastrophic connecting rod bearing wear. 810332. Vehicle Testing for Electromagnetic Compatibil- ity. Wayne L. Minten, Watkins-Johnson Co. EMC testing for the automobile has taken a new perspective in the past decade. The use of the micro- processor and integrated circuits to solve a multitude of safety, pollution and fuel economy problems has unfor- tunately resulted in reliability problems caused by RF radiation. The success of a good EMC test capability is an understanding of the RF radiation effects to the auto- mobile and the electronic equipment required to simulate a wide range of radiated environments. 810333. Implementation of EMC Testing of Automotive Vehicles. J. C. Kinderman, R. P. Blink, D. J. Eisenlord, M. G. Laskowski, J. G. Moyer, J. P. Peters, T. Rybak and W.

This facility includes automated shielded anechoic rooms equipped with program controlled dynamometers for radiated susceptibility and radio compatibility testing, computer controlled transient measurement and con- ducted susceptibility laboratory, open-air sites for narrow and broadband radiated emissions and mobile equipment for onboard vehicle testing. This paper presents the procedures and methods performed in the planning, construction and validation of the facility. Value analysis, system development and implementation results will be detailed. 1981 SAE Transactions 810336. Variable Geometry Turbocharging - The Realis- tic Way Forward. F. J. Wallace, R. J. B.

The paper describes the results of a major development programme in association with industry on a prototype variable geometry turbocharger turbine coupled to a wide mass flow range compressor, and the matching of this unit to a standard Perkins T 6.354 engine. The performance target for the turbine was a mass flow turn down ratio of 2:1 and achievement of potential torque back up of 50% at half of rated engine speed. The results are described under the following head- ings: 1.

Winterbone and W. Y. Loo, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, UMIST (Manchester, U. K.). The use of cycle simulation computer programs for the study of both the steady and transient performance of turbocharged diesel engines has provided very useful information for their design and development. This paper describes the development of a dynamic simulation of a two-stroke turbocharged diesel engine. The mathematical model for the system has been developed using the filling and emptying concept. The simulation also includes the characteristics of the turbo- charger compressor, turbine, scavenge blower and inter- cooler. A single zone combustion model has been used to calculate the rate of heat release in the engine cylinder from the fuel injection data. The steady state performance calculation shows a very good correlation with experimental results. Parametric studies were undertaken into the effect of friction and combustion during transient running; these show that the level of friction and the rate of combustion have a great effect on the response rate. 810338. Transient Performance Simulation and Analysis of Turbocharged Diesel Engines. N. Watson, Dept. of Mechanical Engrg., Imperial College (London/England). An advanced analytical model is presented and used for a fundamental investigation of the response of highly rated turbocharged diesel engines. Details of many aspects of the model are presented, along with a discussion of certain limitations and their importance. The accuracy of the model is illustrated. Factors influencing turbocharger response are dis- cussed and the dominant ones selected for further analysis. The fuel control system of a highly rated engine usually consists of a device that limits maximum fuel delivery as a function of boost pressure. Changes in turbocharger match can be used to improve low-speed torque and reduce exhaust smoke. The importance of then reoptimizing the maximum fuel controller for transient as well as steady-state conditions is illustrated, showing the trade-off between improved driveability and exhaust smoke. Turbocharger inertia also strongly influences response and can be reduced by design, material and diameter changes. However reducing turbine diameter alone causes an efficiency miss-match (with radial turbomachinery). The implications of the trade-off between specific speed, efficiency, diameter, inertia, matching and response are presented. 1981 SA E Transactions 810339. The Variation of Friction and Combustion Rates During Diesel Engine Transients. D. E. Winter- bone, Dept. of Mechanical Engrg., UMIST (Manchester/U. K.); and D. W. H. Tennant, JCB Research (Rochester/Staffordshire/U.K.). A comprehensive investigation of the performance of a 6-cylinder turbocharged engine was undertaken under steady state and transient conditions. Friction was measured under steady state conditions and a formula for calculating fmep is proposed. It was found that friction under transient conditions is higher than would be predicted from quasi-steady considerations. A combustion model was applied to the engine during steady state and transient conditions. It was found that combustion deteriorated under transient conditions even after including turbocharger lag effects. 810341. Turbocharging a 6-Cylinder Diesel for Various Ratings and Applications. R. C. Mcintosh, F. Brear and M. B. Shamma, Perkins Engines Group (England). Turbocharging of a basic engine type to suit different ratings and applications poses many problems. Careful design of components, choice of turbocharger match and supporting equipment are all critical in obtaining the optimum solution. The addition of turbocharging to an engine type permits it to leave behind some of the restraints of its naturally aspirated form. However other factors are encountered which set limits rather than offer advantages. The successful optimization of all these factors within one engine type permits the benefits of component and configuration rationalization to be realized while still retaining the performance diversity and flexibility nec- essary to meet the needs of the market place. 810342.

Information on objectives and development achievements of the newly introduced SAURER DK-B engine family for heavy duty truck applications is presented. In particular comparative results obtained with different supercharging methods on the same basic engine and data about transient response and altitude operation are given. The present D4KT-B engine, being the most advanced SAURER power plant, is characterized by a constant power output between 1800 rpm and the rated speed of 2000 rpm and, due to the application of combined turbocharging by a high maximum torque at low engine speed. 67</page><page sequence="49">810343-810347 810343. Fuel Economy for Diesel Cars by Supercharging. Gerhard M. Schruf and Andreas Mayer, BBC Brown, Boveri &amp; Co., Ltd. By using diesel engines with high torque and instant response as offered by those with a suitable supercharging system, it proves possible to shift the average operating point close to the engine efficiency optimum. Computer analysis confirmed by chassis dynamometer tests of two car sizes equipped with Comprex charged IDI engines show a potential improvement in fuel economy of 19-26 %. Comparison is made with a NA engine having equivalent road performance as defined by the accel- eration rate. 810344. The Optimized Design of the Exhaust Brake of the Automotive Diesel Engine. Kishiro Akiba and Masahiko Ohtani, Isuzu Motors Ltd. (Ja- pan); and Haruo Yoshiki, The Univ. of Tokyo (Japan). Exhaust brake performance is an important factor in the design of the automotive diesel engine. Many devices have been developed to achieve a higher exhaust brake force; however, most of these are complicated and expensive. This paper deals with an optimized design method for the exhaust brake system based on conventional engine components. The component design was optimized by use of a simulation program for exhaust valve behaviour and pulsating pressure waves in the exhaust pipe, which was developed at Isuzu Motors Ltd. based on an existing program. It was found that the predictions from the computer simulation agreed well with the measured data, not only in respect of exhaust brake force but also valve bounce, exhaust port pressure and so onš The simulation program proved to be a useful means of predicting the effect of various brake design parameters, and enabled an opti- mized exhaust brake system to be achieved at the design stage. The original exhaust brake force obtained on a particular turbocharged diesel engine was a mean effective pressure of 0.56MPa at rated speed. Modification of the existing exhaust manifold configuration, which took better account of the pulsating pressure available therein, increased braking mean effective pressure to 0.74MPa. A braking mean effective pressure of 0.90MPa, correspond- ing to 103% of the rated power, was achieved by adopting a specially designed valve spring. 810345. (SP-480) Ethanol Fuel- A Single-Cylinder En- gine Study of Efficiency and Exhaust Emissions. Norman D. Brinkman, Fuels and Lubricants Dept., General Motors Research Labs. Pure ethanol is being used as a spark-ignition engine fuel in Brazil, and is being considered for use in the U.S. and elsewhere. Efficiency and exhaust emissions with ethanol were quantified using a single-cylinder engine at com- pression ratios from 7.5 to 18, at equivalence ratios of 1.2 (rich) to the lean limit, and at MBT spark timing. Results were compared to those with gasoline at 7.5 compression ratio. With ethanol, compared to gasoline at the same compression ratio, engine thermal efficiency increased 3 percent, peak nitrogen oxide emissions decreased 40 percent, unburned fuel and carbon monoxide emissions were similar, and aldehyde emissions increased 110-360 percent. Increasing compression ratio from 7.5 to 18 with ethanol increased efficiency 18 percent, peak nitrogen oxide emissions 30 percent, unburned fuel emissions 25-200 percent, and aldehyde emissions 50-140 percent. Regression analysis indicated that the increased aldehyde emissions at high CR's may result from reduced exhaust temperatures. As exhaust temperature decreases, oxida- tion of aldehydes in the exhaust system decreases. 1981 SA E Transactions 810346.

The uncertainty regarding supply of conventional petro- leum fuels has provided a real opportunity in Canada to employ partial substitution of diesel fuel with alcohol. This paper briefly outlines an ongoing research, devel- opment and demonstration project sponsored by the Canadian Federal Government that will yield a practical retrofit diesel/methanol fueling system compatible with commercial heavy-duty diesel engines without major engine modifications. The basic phases of this project discussed in this paper are as follows: (a) design of the diesel/methanol emulsion fueling system for a Detroit Diesel 8V71N engine; (b) engine Dynamometer tests with this system for comparative evaluation of performance, combustion and emission characteristics; (c) retrofit system installation on a GMC Brigadier Truck powered with Detroit Diesel 8V71N engine; (d) preliminary Demonstration Road Tests to determine fuel consumption and performance. 810347.

A novel Air-Alcohol INDUCTOR with an inherent flexibility to tailor the alcohol flow rate, has been developed for a multi-cylinder, variable-speed, vehicular Diesel engine to enable operation in the Alcohol-Diesel bi-fuel mode. Tests have been carried out on the dynamometer over the whole speed range of the engine. Also road tests have been carried out under constant vehicular speed conditions. Up to 48% Diesel substitution 68</page><page sequence="50">810348-810352 was achieved on road without reduction in thermal efficiency. Laboratory tests indicate lower exhaust tem- peratures and lower smoke intensities than in the diesel mode. 810348. (SP-480) Onboard Hydrogen Generation for Hydrogen Injection into Internal Combustion Engines. Krister Sjöström, Sören Eriksson and Gunnar Landqvist, Dept. of Chemical Tech- nology, The Royal Institute of Technology (Stockholm, Sweden). A system is described for onboard hydrogen generation in an internal combustion engine. The hydrogen is produced from methanol reacting with steam in recirculated exhaust gas over a Ni-catalyst. The energy for the reaction is supplied by the exhaust waste heat. The hydrogen is used to extend the lean limit of the gasoline in order to achieve higher efficiency and lower pollutant emissions. A theoretical study of the required amount of recirculated exhaust gas has been made and the energy efficiency of the reactor has been calculated. The produced and the required amount of hydrogen have also been calculated. A stationary test engine using the system is presented. The results show a potential for very low pollutant emissions with an increased energy efficiency compared to that of a conventional engine. 810349. (SP-480) Hydrogen as an Alternative Automotive Fuel. Carl A. Kukkonen, Ford Motor Co. The technical feasibility of replacing petroleum-based fuels with hydrogen is established, considering produc- tion, distribution, onboard storage and suitability as a fuel in internal combustion engine and fuel cell-powered electric vehicles. The feasible hydrogen/vehicle systems are compared with other synthetic fuel/vehicle options and with battery-powered EV's€ On the basis of primary resource energy consumption and compatibility with existing infrastructure, the hydrogen ICE vehicles rank last. Although hydrogen fuel cells are attractive, they are not a near term commercial prospect. Therefore it is concluded that hydrogen will not be used as an auto- motive fuel in this century.

Michael R. Swain and John M. Pappas, Hawthorne Research &amp; Testing, Inc., Robert R. Adt, Jr., Univ. of Miami; and William J. D. Escher, Escher: Foster Technology Asso- ciates, Inc. The objective of the project reflected in this summary paper is to document an experimental design data-base on hydrogen-fueled automotive engines. The effort, spon- sored by the U.S. Department of Energy, is directed toward possible future designs of airbreathing piston engines using hydrogen. To this end, pertinent perform- ance and emissions (NOx only) characteristics of 16 engine configurations are presented graphically. Configurational variations of a 1600 cc automotive test engine included: throttled and un throttled operation (i.e., quantity and quality power level control); central manifold, port, direct cylinder injection [not included]; single and divided combustion chambers; exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), water induction and air injection; and certain other features. Comparisons of these hydrogen-engine characteristics with the stock gasoline-fueled reference case are made at the same and other displacements, at a (stock) com- pression ratio of 9.0 with operation at a fixed 1800 rpm. 810351. (SP-480) Liquid-Hydrogen Automotive Onboard Storage and Servicing System Project: A Pro- gress Report. Walter F. Stewart, Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM; and William J. D. Escher, Escher: Foster Technol- ogy Associates, Inc., St. Johns, MI. Under Department of Energy sponsorship, the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory is presently road testing a U.S. intermediate sized automobile adapted to liquid- hydrogen fuel. The overall project objective is to docu- ment a general experience base as a point of departure for future development. A semiautomatic fueling station developed by the Deutsche Forschungs- und Versuch- sanstalt für Luft- und Raumfahrt (DFVLR) of the Federal Republic of Germany is being used to service (refuel) the experimental vehicle. The DFVLR also provided the 150-/ (39.6-gal.) cryogenic liquid-hydrogen storage tank mount- ed in the trunk compartment and the dashboard fuel gauging system. The V-6 turbocharged engine was converted to hydrogen operation by the Billings Energy Corporation. Both the container and the engine modi- fications represented state-of-the-art technology when the program began. 810352. Spot Weldability Tests for High-Strength Steels. J. M. Sawhill, Jr. and S. T. Furr, Bethlehem Steel Corp. A wide range of quality control and mechanical tests were performed on many of the high-strength steels welded in the automotive industry. The most useful tests for describing the spot weldability of these steels were determined to be (1) the peel or chisel test for evaluating ease of welding in the plant, and (2) weld tensile tests for verifying the mechanical properties associated with service performance. Using practical experience gained in the last few years as well as related data on plain carbon steels, these weldability tests can be applied to automotive production and service performance. 1981 SAE Transactions 69</page><page sequence="51">810353-810359 810353. Observations of Factors Which Influence the Spot Weldability of High-Strength Steels. D. W. Dickinson and T. V. Natale, Republic Steel Corp., Research Center, Independence, OH. Spot weldability of sheet steel has been related to the current range over which welds with acceptable size and/or mechanical properties are obtained. There are many factors which affect the size of the current range, the location of this range, and the type and location of spot weld failure. Some of these factors include (a) chemistry, (b) surface conditions (including coatings, rust, etc.), (c) subsurface oxides and steel cleanliness, and (d) mill production procedures. Some observations on the effects of these factors upon the spot weldability of high-strength, low-alloy steels have been made. Sheet chemistries containing excessive levels of phosphorous or oxygen have been observed to cause brittle nuggets because of weld centerline hot cracking. Materials with excessive subsurface oxides likewise have been noted to promote centerline failures. High resistance surfaces tend to move the location of the current ranges. Finally, steel processing techniques can affect the nugget tear location. Examples of each of these observations will be given, together with examples of how specific weld problems were solved. 1981 SAE Transactions 810354. Fatigue Behavior of Spot Welded High Strength Steel Joints. R. B. Wilson, Inland Steel Research Laboratories; and T. E. Fine, International Harvester. A new fatigue test specimen configuration has been developed which allows testing of spot welded joints in a fully reversed axial fatigue mode in a life range from 5 X 103 to 1 X 107 cycles. The specimen, a unique square concentric tube arrangement, tests four spot welds simultaneously. The materials tested in this program included three dual-phase steels, an SAE 940X grade, SAE 1020 steel and a cold rolled, low carbon steel - SAE 1006AK for purposes of comparison. The general results indicate the superiority of the dual-phase steels in the low life region with all steels showing equivalent behavior beyond 5 X 105 cycles. Additionally, beneficial effects of increased steel thickness and increased nugget diameter were observed. 810355. Fatigue Strength of Spot Welded Joints in a HSLA Steel. D. H. Orts, Armco Inc. A wide variety of spot welded joints in a HSLA sheet steel were tested both in fatigue and statically, measuring the nugget rotation with load. Under static loads the load- nugget rotation plot was found to correlate well with a hyperbolic equation and the equation constants could be interpreted as a "theoretical load limit" and weldment "stiffness". The influence of the number, shape and position of spot welds, weld defects and improvements, the loading couple and mode of loading on the fatigue strength of the spot welded joints were evaluated. 810358. Fatigue Life Estimation on HSLA Chassis Frame. H. Shirasawa, J. Jizaimaru and T. Mizoguchi, Kobe Steel, Ltd. (Japan); and N. Tada, Toyota Motor Co., Ltd. (Japan). Fatigue tests were performed on five kinds of fillet welded joints on 2.6 mm thick HSLA steel sheets, to evaluate the fatigue life of automotive HSLA chassis frame with different joint geometries under various loading condi- tions. Specimens were made by C02 gas arc welding with 1.2 mm diameter wire. During the fatigue tests at stress ratio (R) = -l, dynamic strain was measured using a 3 mm strain gage cemented on the sheet surface nearest to the toe. Data were discussed by nominal stress as well as by local strain. 810359. Improvements in Resistance Welding of Alu- minium for Automobile Manufacture. R. M. Rivett and S. A. Westgate, The Welding Insti- tute, UK. Work has been carried out to determine the influence of electrode configuration, electrode material and the use of dual pressure welding schedules on the number of welds which can be made with a pair of electrodes when resistance welding 1mm 2117 aluminium alloy. It was found that 4.8mm tip diameter 1% Cr-Cu truncated cone electrodes gave an average life of 1380 welds compared to 400 welds with 75mm radius domed 1% Cr-Cu electrodes. Consistent results could not be obtained with pimple electrodes. For the welding con- ditions employed, electrode life was found to be depen- dent on the mechanical properties of the electrode material and independent of softening temperature. The best results were obtained with Class 3, 2.5% Co - 0.42% Be-Cu electrodes (average 1700 welds) and the shortest lives with the high conductivity Class 1 materials usually recommended for resistance welding of aluminium. The effect of dual pressure was investigated for pedestal and gun stations. Using 4.8mm tip diameter 1% Cr-Cu truncated cone electrodes on a pedestal machine it was found that lives could be extended from an average of 1300 welds, the lives ending as a result of solidification cracking, to more than 3000 by increasing the forge force from 3.1 to 7.8kN. In the latter case the lives ended due to electrode sticking. With conventional dual pressure schedules electrode life increases with increased forge level but the timing of the forge initiation must be precisely controlled so that it occurs at the end of the last current cycle. The extension in life is lost if the initiation is delayed by 1 cycle. A similar trend in results was obtained when using a welding gun fitted with 3.2mm tip diameter electrodes. The electrode life was increased from an average of 500 welds to an average of 1650 welds when a forge force of 5.7kN was employed. As some welding guns, designed for use with mild 70</page><page sequence="52">810360-810366 steel, are not capable of withstanding the high forge forces normally recommended, equipment was developed so as to give a modified dual pressure schedule. This system gave low forge forces whilst retaining a high rate of application. The results obtained with this system when using a forge force of 2.9kN achieved within 0.4 cycles after initiation were the same as those obtained when using a conventional forge force of 5.7kN. 810360. Measuring and Reducing Hydrocarbon Losses Occurring in Gasketed Flanges. M. T. Passarella, F. D. Farnam Div., Colt Industries. Gasket materials now play a major role in helping to reduce hydrocarbon leakage occurring from evaporative loss emissions. Many so-called 'conventional' gasket materials in emissions-related applications have not demonstrated significant reductions in HC leakage. In addition, scien- tific testing for real numbers to rate gasketing singularly has been difficult to impossible. These needs have created pragmatic methods for testing, resulting in improved gasketing. 810361. The Effect of Flange Roughness on Leakage Rate. Harold D. Raut, Varysburg Gasket Re- search Laboratory. Leakage rate tests were performed on two types of type 304 stainless steel gaskets. One type had asbestos fillers and the other had graphite fillers. The gaskets were tested at roughness of 125, 250, 500, and 1000 microinches, AARH. Regression analysis was performed on the test data to obtain comparison curves for the effect of flange surface on each type of gasket. 810362. Creating Gasket Seals with Rigid Flanges. Jess W. Oren, Armstrong World Industries, Inc. The interaction between the compression characteristics of gaskets and the deflections of rigid flanges is discussed as it affects the creation of required sealing stress upon the gasket. A method of applying simple and continuous beam deflection formulae describes a procedure to obtain an economical, sufficiently-stiff flange when initially designed. Multiple bolts create continuous beam condi- tions that are effective in decreasing flange deflections and creating a more uniform gasket pressure. The use of high strength bolts to maximize span length between bolts may not be advisable because longer spans require stiffer, heavier flanges. 810363. The Effect of Bolt Tightening Characteristics and Gasket Properties on Cylinder Head Gasketing. Robert J. Finkeiston, SPS Technologies, Inc. The problem of properly tensioning cylinder head bolts, in such a way that the gasket is uniformly compressed to its design sealing load is complex. Gasket relaxation must be compensated for, and the residual gasket compression must be high enough so that the seal is maintained during the combustion cycle which relieves a portion of the clamping load provided by the head bolts. The purpose of this paper is to explore the method of tensioning cylinder head bolts, the tightening strategies employed, and the interaction between the bolt tightening and gasket characteristics which influence the residual bolt preload. Experimental techniques are used to investigate the cylinder gasketing problem and the results of one study which eliminated re-torquing the bolts are presented. 810364. Fibers for Consideration in Non-Asbestos, High Performance Gasket Materials. C. M. Lindeman and R. D. Andrew, Armstrong World Industries, Inc. A wide variety of fibers have been evaluated as possible replacements for asbestos in gasket compositions. The studies to date indicate that no single material can be considered as a completely satisfactory alternative. How- ever, compositions with blends of fibers and fillers have been made that will meet the general processing and performance criteria of conventional asbestos-rubber materials. 810365. Cylinder Head Gaskets for Bi-Metal Engines and Techniques for Optimizing the Method of Clamp- ing. K. H. Albertz, Goetze AG; and K. G. Friedrichs, Goetze Corp. of America. This paper will describe the problems associated with cylinder head gaskets in bi-metal engines. To expand on this theme, the consequences for the gasket material, the gasket thickness and the method of torquing the cylinder head bolts will be traced in detail. Recommendations aimed at increasing sealing relia- bility will be made regarding the choice of gasket thickness, that is, the choice of cylinder head gaskets of greater installed thickness, since, in that way, an even distribution of pressure is achieved and the range to the minimum required surface pressure can be increased. On the other hand - mainly in connection with the requirement for cylinder head gasket non-retorquability - the recommendation will be made that angle torquing of the head bolts should be introduced. The technique and its advantages over the traditional wrench torquing technique will be explained. A thermal shock test program for evaluating the functional efficiency of the cylinder head gasket will be presented and explained in detail. The increased loading on the cylinder head gasket especially during the engine hot running phase can be simulated with this program. 810366. Designing With the New Asbestos-Free Gasket Materials. John E. Zeitz, John A. Damusis and James A. Ulrich, Victor Products Div., Dana Corp., Lisle, IL. A growing number of asbestos-free materials are being developed for use as direct sustitutes for the ASTM F 104 71</page><page sequence="53">810367-810374 Type 1 gasket materials. Using these materials in appli- cation opens up both opportunity and problem areas. The scope of this paper is to point out the strengths, weakness, and potential opportunities involved with the new generation of asbestos-free products. The scope of this paper also includes those materials currently capable of being classified under ASTM F 104 designation as well as hard gaskets and exhaust gasket materials containing metallic members. 810367. Recent Developments and New Approaches in Mechanical and Chemical Gasketing. Daniel E. Czernik, Fel-Pro Inc./Felt Products Manufac- turing Co. In recent years, there have been significant innovations and improvements made in the field of automotive gasketing. They have occurred in both the mechanical and chemical gasketing field. This paper depicts some of these innovations and improvements and describes how they have affected the gasketing of automotive joints. Improvements in mechanical gaskets such as un- broken metal core reinforcement of gasket materials, new surface coatings for seal and abrasion resistance, and use of printed sealing beads are discussed. The sealing theory of chemical gasketing and some of the latest developments in this field are included. Factors to be considered in the selection of mechanical or chemical gaskets are enumer- ated. 810370. Influence of Lateral Restraint on Occupant Interaction with a Shoulder Belt or Preinflated Air Bag in Oblique Impacts. Clyde C. Culver and David C. Viano, Biomedical Science Dept., General Motors Research Laboratories, Warren, MI. Sled tests were conducted at farside oblique angles of 15°, 45°, and 75° with a Part 572 dummy restrained by a conventional driver lap/shoulder belt system or a prein- flated driver inflatable restraint. Occupant dynamics were compared in similar tests where an inboard energy absorbing lateral restraint of the upper torso was or was not used. It can be concluded that the seat wing improves the control of the dummy's dynamics in oblique impacts by directing the occupant's motion more forward into the restraint system, thereby taking more advantage of the restraining potential of the shoulder belt or inflatable restraint in controlling the deceleration of the dummy and enhancing the benefit of the restraint system. However, additional factors associated with the use of a seat wing remain to be investigated including the effect of impact force on the occupant, interaction with out-of-position occupants and comfort/convenience. 1981 SAE Transactions 810372. Structural Characteristics of Motorcycle Hel- mets. Herbert B. Kingsbury, Univ. of Delaware, Newark, DE; and Paul R. Rohr, Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, Washington, DC. This paper presents the results of a series of nearly two hundred tests of five different brands of motorcycle helmets to determine their force-deformation character- istics and their resistance to penetration. Tests were carried out with helmets mounted on headforms. Among the test variables were point of loading, environmental preconditioning, loading rate and headform type. Results presented include the measured force-defor- mation curves, tabulated data showing permanent change in helmet thickness, energy of deformation, secant modulus at 40 KN force, and force and deformation at which the helmet is fully crushed. Also presented are measured helmet thicknesses, weights and mass center locations. 810373. The Use of the NATO Reference Mobility Model in Military Vehicle Procurement. E. N. Petrick, Z. J. Janosi and P. W. Haley, U. S. Army Tank - Automotive Command, Warren, MI. The US Army Tank - Automotive Command (TACOM) has adopted a new policy with respect to all initial vehicle acquisitions. It has been decided to specify off- and on-road mobility requirements by means of a "standard" quantitative methodology and to perform subsequent concept analyses by means of this methodology only. Prior to 1972, mobility specifications contained im- precise requirements such as "it has to be as mobile as the Ml 13 in mud, snow and sand". However, since 1972, specifications frequently included performance criteria which were given in quantitative terms. The method for computing these characteristics, however, has not been fixed until now. The objective of this paper is to review the meth- odology selected by TACOM, namely the use of a comprehensive computerized mobility simulation called the NATO Reference Mobility Model (NRMM), and to present the Command's plans to implement this policy. 810374. Quartz Capsule Pressure Transducer for the Automotive Industry. C. Y. Lee, Bendix Elec- tronics and Engine Control Systems Group, Troy, MI; and J. L. Pfeifer, Bendix Engineering Development Center, Southfield, MI. This paper describes a low-cost, high-performance man- ifold absolute pressure sensor for the automotive industry. The sensor uses a pressure-dependent sealed capacitor element constructed from fused quartz plates, and circuit detection schemes to produce the voltage signal output. Temperature effects due to the thermal elastic and linear expansion coefficients of the quartz capsule are also discussed, as are electronic compensation methods to minimize these effects in the output. 1981 SAE Transactions 72</page><page sequence="54">810375-810382 810375. Ported-Enclosure Vibrating-Diaphragm Pressure Sensor. Binneg Y. Lao, Bendix Advanced Tech- nology Center, Southfield, MI; and Brigitte Chicot, Bendix Engineering Development Cen- ter, Southfield, MI. A potentially low-cost, frequency-output vibrating-dia- phragm absolute pressure sensor has been developed which shows promise as an automotive manifold absolute pressure (MAP) sensor. The sensor output is stable within ± 1% of value from 25 °C to 50° C and within ± 3% of value from -40°C to + 80°C. It is insensitive to humidity and gasoline vapor variations. It requires no reference pressure and is therefore immune to errors due to a leaky reference chamber or material creep associated with a pressure differential. 1981 SAE Transactions 810376. Totally Integrated Presssure Transducer. R. E. Bicking, Micro Switch Div., Honeywell, Inc.; R. L. Johnson and D. B. Wamstad, Solid State Electronics Center, Honeywell, Inc. Until now, environmental and cost concerns have inhib- ited widespread application of piezoresistive pressure transducers in many applications. The monolithic silicon pressure sensor, unlike a conventional I C, must interface with the environment. The circuit side of the sensor chip is protected from the environment in the integrated pressure transducer (IPT). The entire circuit, including high level amplification and temperature compensation, is placed on a chip only 0.1" square. It has built-in trim capability via thin film resistors and is contained in a package designed for low cost processing. 810378. Onboard Sensors for Microcomputer-Based Di- agnostic Systems in Heavy Trucks. William G. Wolber and Brigitte Chicot, Engineering De- velopment Center, The Bendix Corp., South- field, MI. The technology is now available for an onboard vehicular diagnostic system. Such a system has immediate economic benefit when applied to heavy long-haul trucks, in terms of reduced incidence of catastrophic downtime, reduced maintenance cost, and improved fuel economy. A design philosophy for a modular organization of the parameters measured is described. Attention is focused on a basic set of parameters useful in all heavy trucks. The state of the art of sensors available to implement such a basic module is described in detail. Fuel flow-rate sensing in a return-flow diesel injector system is noted as a special problem. 810379. A Linear Output Hall Effect Transducer for Automotive Systems. Norman Wheelock, Micro Switch, A Honeywell Div., Freeport, IL. Micro Switch's new Linear Output //all Lffect Transducer (LOHET) provides the designer of automotive electronics significantly improved position and current sensing capabilities. The LOHET is a new three terminal sensor which combines time proven Hall effect sensing tech- nology and advanced thick film techniques. The LOHET generates an output voltage that is proportional to magnetic fields present at its sensing surface. When combined with appropriate magnetics, the LOHET can be used to sense the position of mechanical assemblies. LOHET can also be used in combination with coil and core assemblies to sense current. LOHET can even be used to sense temperature when combined with a bellows and magnetics. LOHET is an extremely versatile Hall effect sensor and will offer numerous solutions to the sensing needs of the 80's. 810380. Experimental Analysis of Zr02 Oxygen Sensor Transient Switching Behavior. C. T. Young, Bendix Engineering Development Center, Southfield, MI. An experimental analysis was performed on the transient switching behavior of Zr02 exhaust gas oxygen sensors. Sensor response delay time and voltage switching rate were investigated as a function of temperature and air-fuel ratio. A theoretical study was first conducted from which mathematical equations were derived describing the delay time and switching rate. Extensive experimentei testing was then carried out using a program-controlled func- tional tester. Sensors of three different forms were tested at temperatures ranging from 780°C down to 170°C with nine different air-fuel ratio excursions across stoichio- metry. Test data were further analyzed and the theoretical equations verified. 1981 SAE Transactions 810381. Development and Application of a Multi-Channel Load Sensing System for Research of Crash- worthiness. Kenji Ogata, Yutaka Tanaka and Kanetsugu Shibata, Toyota Motor Co., Ltd. (Japan). We have been developing a Multi-Channel Load Sensing System (abbreviated M.C.L.S.S.) measuring impact loads of all required vehicle structure parts independently, during impact against the fixed barrier. By using the above load cell for rear-end collision against the fixed barrier for two different rear body types, we could clarify the distribution of the impact loads and the energy absorption of the required vehicle structural parts. 810382. Fuel Economy and Exhaust Emissions Rela- tionships for Low and High Mileage California Automobiles. Michael R. Appleby, Louis J. Bintz and Bruce E. Hodge, Automobile Club of Southern California. 73</page><page sequence="55">810383-810389 Fuel shortages in recent years have heightened interest in the relationship of vehicle fuel economy to the control of exhaust emissions. To determine if, with accumulation of mileage, changes in exhaust emissions are accompanied by changes in fuel economy, both were measured on relatively large displacement, domestic 1976-1978 pro- duction vehicles at low mileage (0-15,000 miles) and at high mileage (40,000-60,000 miles). An analysis of the data indicates that there is a relationship between fuel economy and two of the three exhaust pollutants measured. The changes in fuel economy and exhaust emissions as well as the relationship between them are described in detail. 810383. 1978 to 1980 Ford On-Road Fuel Economy. Neil E. South, Fuel Economy Planning, Ford Motor Co. Since 1978 Ford Motor Company has been surveying the fuel economy of employes who lease new light duty vehicles from the Company. Winter and summer survey data for the three years are analyzed and compared. Car results show a significant and steady increase in average on-road fuel economy over the three year period. The percent differential between EPA measured and actual on-road fuel economy has lessened substantially since 1978. Furthermore, the percent difference between EPA and on-road is essentially constant over the range of EPA values for each of the three years. Limited fuel economy results for 1980 trucks are also discussed. 810384. In-Use Fuel Economy of 1980 Passenger Cars. R. W. Schneider, B. W. Lipka and F. K. Miller, General Motors Corporation, Warren, MI. An owner survey was conducted to determine the owner-measured in-use fuel economy of 1980 model passenger cars for a number of manufacturers. The in-use fuel economy is compared to the laboratory tested fuel economy ratings as established by the Environmental Protection Agency. An analysis of how this comparison has changed between 1975, 1976, 1978, and 1980 models is presented. Finally, an analysis was done on the influence of vehicle design parameters on the differences between EPA laboratory ratings and in-use fuel economy. The design parameters studied include front wheel drive, diesel engines, and manual transmissions. 810386. Light Duty Automotive Fuel Economy ... Trends through 1981. J. A. Foster, J. D. Murrell and S. L. Loos, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. EPA new-model fuel economy figures are presented for passenger vehicles and light duty trucks (those with GVW ratings up to 8500 lbs). The 1981 models are emphasized, with some comparisons to prior years included. Reader familiarity with the EPA tests, data bases, and analytical methods is assumed. Principal two-way analyses include comparisons of domestic vs. import, gasoline vs. Diesel, and Federal (49-state) vs. California vehicles. Sales fractions for a number of vehicle and engine emission control design features are included. The principal findings are that increased use of newer vehicle and emission control technologies in 1981 has accompanied significant fuel economy gains in spite of the tougher 1981 emission standards. 810387. Comparison of Gasoline and Diesel Automobile Fuel Economy as Seen by the Consumer. Barry D. McNutt, U. S. Department of Energy. A number of different and perhaps conflicting claims have been made about the fuel-economy benefits of Diesel- fueled automobiles versus their gasoline-fueled counter- parts. While a "traditional" figure of a 25 percent fuel-economy gain with Diesels is often used, this figure has varied due to differences in vehicle performance, driving conditions, fuel Btu content, and advances in engine design (particularly in spark-ignition engines). This paper looks at fuel economy, in the broad sense of the term, from thé consumer's perspective. The analysis is based on EPA-measured fuel economy in model year 1980, actual on-road fuel economy for 1975-1980 auto- mobiles, and recent fuel price data for gasoline and Diesel fuel. Comparisons of gasoline and Diesel fuel economy that account for these three variables are presented. Also considered is the way that gasoline and Diesel fuel economy comparisons may change in the future with changes in fuel prices, emission standards, and engine design. 810388. Analysis of Fuel Economy and Vehicle Use Data from the 1977 Truck Inventory and Use Survey. David Lax, Energy and Environmental Analysis, Inc., Arlington, VA. This paper examines medium- and heavy-duty truck fuel economy and use characteristics as reported in the 1977 Truck Inventory and Use Survey (TIUS). The study focuses on in-use fuel economy, the use of fuel conservation equipment and annual miles per truck for three vehicle weight categories as functions of engine fuel type and area of operation. The TIUS data show that there is no significant difference between the average fuel economy of gasoline vs. diesel trucks in each of the three weight categories considered in the analysis. Significant differ- ences are shown in annual miles per truck by weight category, fuel type, and area of operation. The data also illustrate a large increase in the use of fuel conservation equipment in both new and older trucks. 810389. (SP-483) Quality-Historical Perspective. Delmer C.

(SP-483) Quality Education. H. J. Bajaría, Lawrence Institute of Technology, Southfield, MI; J. Goble and G. F. Gruska, Chevrolet Motor Div., GMC. United States (US) industries spend much time and money every year in quality assurance or quality control training (hereafter referred to as quality training) for their employees. Yet these industries, in general, tend to remain frustrated with the outcome of such efforts. This paper attempts to put the total program of quality training in perspective on a national scale. Seven different segments are discussed with respect to the influence quality training has over industry professionals, professional societies, government, industry, engineering colleges, management colleges, and quality professionals. Also discussed is the question of why the task of quality training is very frustrating. 810391. (SP-483) Quality in Purchasing. David R. Schwinn, Ford Motor Co. The quality of outside supplied parts is an extremely important part in the total vehicle package consumers desire today. Although each supplier is ultimately re- sponsible for the quality of its own products, a company's Purchasing group is the most influential customer activity in obtaining high quality. With the support of other customer activities, Purchasing selects the proper supplier, plans for and monitors production start-up, monitors supplier ongoing quality information and obtains correc- tive action as supplier quality concerns arise. 810392. (SP-483) Quality Engineering Techniques in Product Design/Process. Joseph M. Michalek and Richard K. Holmes, General Motors Corp., Chevrolet Product Assurance. There are several quality engineering/statistical tech- niques that can assist in predicting potential quality problems. One of these, variation simulation has the capability of examining the effect of the product process interaction early in the product cycle. The ability to predict quality related problems in the design and/or process development stage allows re-evaluation of the design/process prior to prototype, pilot, and production build. This can result in substantial cost savings as well as minimizing production interruptions for design and process changes. This paper will examine applications of variation simulation and other quality engineering tech- niques during product and process design development. 810393.

Organizationally blended into a team management concept, but administratively reporting to the Quality Control Department, this 117- person department, consisting of engineers, skilled- tradesmen and support personnel, designs and builds the sophisticated measuring equipment and acts as the technical interface between Quality Control and other facets of the division. 810394. (SP-483) Quality Planning in Manufacturing. Samar K. Bhuyan, Chevrolet Saginaw Mfg., General Motors Corp. It is generally recognized that quality can not be inspected into the product, nor can it happen by accident. It should be built into the product by careful planning, analysis and control. This paper provides reinforcement for the proposition that quality is everyone's responsibility. But should other departments not be prepared to meet the challenge in all respects, quality control has an obligation to assure the manufacture of quality products. The paper presents several inspection plans to assure manufacturing quality and illustrates the dynamic programming ap- proach to obtain an optimum balance between quality and cost. 810395. (SP-483) Automated Data Acquisition and Anal- ysis from Production Testing. William E. Weir, Michigan Div. of TRW Inc. The data of product characteristics measured during final production testing of a product can be collected in a computer system. This data can then be analyzed and processed automatically to provide real time reporting of product quality. By having more complete quality infor- mation compiled sooner, the effectiveness of the feedback is improved. The result is improved product quality. This approach is most valuable for complex assemblies with many components produced in large volume and is now applied to the testing of Power Rack and Pinion steering gear assemblies. 810396. Recent Developments in the Measurement of Acoustic Intensity using the Cross-Spectral Meth- od. J. Y. Chung and D. A. Blaser, Engineering Mechanics Dept., General Motors Research Laboratories. In recent years, the use of the cross-spectral method of measuring acoustic intensity has been shown effective in noise-source-ranking and noise-source-identification. Us- ing a computerized data acquisition and analysis pro- cedure, the method is efficient and accurate. Its appli- cability to a near-field and/or reverberant-field meas- 75</page><page sequence="57">810397-810402 urement enables the method to be used in situ. The method has a potential of replacing many conventional acoustical measurements, but results of many parametric studies of the method are not known to many interested noise control engineers. These parametric studies, in addition to a general review of the method, are presented in this paper. 1981 SAE Transactions 810397. Automotive Applications of Three-Dimensional Acoustic Finite Elements. S. H. Sung, Engi- neering Mechanics Dept., General Motors Re- search Laboratories, General Motors Technical Center. Three-dimensional acoustic finite elements have been applied to calculate the 'knock-induced' cavity resonances for combustion chambers and the cavity 'booming' frequencies for passenger compartments. The NASTRAN finite element program is employed to solve the acoustic free-vibration problems, and resonant frequencies ob- tained from these numerical predictions have been compared with experimental results. In addition, the resonant mode shapes are shown and illustrate the acoustic pressure distributions and nodal surfaces for particular resonant frequencies. Besides a prismatic passenger compartment with 'bench-seat' model, this paper also presents results for a general 'bucket-seat' model with irregular cross-sectional seat contours. Moreover, a rather complicated cavity model such as a combustion chamber is included to illustrate the capabilities of the finite element analysis. The results illustrated in this paper are of interest in combustion chamber thermodynamic property studies, knock-sensor designs, and vehicle interior noise studies. 810398. Application of a Structural-Acoustic Diagnostic Technique to Reduce Boom Noise in a Passenger Vehicle. C. A. Joachim, Engineering Dept., General Motors Holden's Ltd. (Port Mel- bourne/Australia); D. J. Nefske and J. A. Wolf, Jr., Engineering Mechanics Dept., General Mo- tors Research Laboratories, Warren, MI. An acoustic finite element capability and a Fourier analysis capability are employed to identify the structural areas that cause boom noise in a vehicle. The noise occurs in the 127-140 Hz frequency range and results from the forces transmitted to the body structure from the vibration of the engine on its mounts. The phenomenon is diagnosed as being caused by panel vibrations exciting the second longitudinal acoustic resonance of the passenger compartment. Several panels around the front of the compartment are identified as being significant to the excitation of this resonance, and weights are added to various panels to change their vibration characteristics. The noise in the compartment is thereby reduced by 8 dB, and the suggested change is, therefore, the modification of these panels. 810399. Reduction of Automobile Booming Noise Using Engine Mountings That Have an Auxiliary Vibrating System. Hikota Sakamoto, Komei Yazaki and Masao Fukushima, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. This paper presents a new concept concerning engine mountings that can reduce engine booming noise by utilizing an additional vector. Booming noise in passenger cars, particularly those with a four-cylinder engine, is caused by exciting forces such as the second harmonic of engine inertial force. We have found that exciting forces transmitted from the engine to the body structure through the engine mountings are reduced by adding another vector which cancels out these exciting forces. This new vector can be obtained by using a mass-controlled region of a vibrating system possessing either a single degree or two degrees of freedom. When this optimally designed mechanism is adopted on a small passenger car, booming noise can be significantly reduced. 810400. An Evaluation of Light Vehicle Exterior Noise Test Procedures. R. H. Paddy, Ford Motor Company. This paper reviews the evaluation of four light vehicle exterior noise test procedures. Vehicle test results from two part throttle and one multi mode test are compared to the results from a currently in use wide open throttle procedure SAE J986. Each procedure is evaluated for clarity of instructions, time to test requirements, equipment requirements, vehicle changes required for the test, sound levels produced, how the procedures rank vehicles and the sources of sound. 810401. The Use of Acoustic-Intensity Scans for Sound Power Measurement and for Noise Source In- dentification in Surface Transportation Vehicles. J. Pope, R. Hickling, D. A. Feldmaier and D. A. Blaser, Engineering Mechanics Dept., General Motors Research Laboratories, Warren, MI. The results are reported of near-field, acoustic-intensity scans of a diesel-engine truck, chassis-mounted passen- ger-car engines, and a railroad locomotive. The meas- urements were made using the two-microphone, cross- spectral method of measuring acoustic intensity developed at General Motors. The results demonstrate the value of the method for measuring the overall sound power of a vehicle as well as for identifying its component noise sources. A review of theory and methodology is provided. 1981 SAE Transactions 810402. Computerization of a Vehicle Pass-By Noise Measurement Facility. R. A. Bishop, T. F. Foxlee and J. M. Strang, Ford Motor Co., Michigan Proving Ground. A computerized data acquisition system for exterior vehicle noise testing was developed to provide the 76</page><page sequence="58">810403-810411 sophisticated data analysis techniques and test site efficiency required to meet current and future regulations. The computer generates accurate, dependable data in a final test report at the conclusion of each test minimizing data reduction and turnaround time. Computer control of test sequences eliminates manual operations and provides efficient use of site time. The inclusion of on line Fourier Analysis Techniques provides additional noise source identification capabilities. 810403. Analytical Study on Engine Vibration Transfer Characteristics Using Single-Shot Combustion. Yoshimasa Hayashi, Kunihiko Sugihara, Akira Toda and Yuji Ushijima, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. (Yokosuka/Japan). In order to demonstrate the generation mechanism of "combustion noise" separately from "mechanical noise," the process of transfer in which vibration travels to each engine portion was analyzed through single-shot com- bustion of a propane-air mixture in the combustion chamber with the crankshaft fixed at a given angle. The effect of the natural frequency of each portion of the engine on the vibration transfer characteristics is discussed by introducing a vibration transfer function. The transfer paths of exciting forces which are caused by the combustion are quantitatively clarified. 1981 SAE Transactions 810406. The Influence of Brake System Properties on Motorcycle Braking Performance. Graham L. Donne and Peter M. Watson, Transport and Road Research Laboratory. The results of a comprehensive range of braking distance measurements obtained from a modern motorcycle equipped with disc brakes are given and discussed. Problems caused by water on the friction areas of such brakes are described and explained along with the results of various palliative measures, including changes in the disc and pad materials and the drilling and slotting of these. A pad material capable of providing a solution is described and evaluated and a test method to assess brake consistency between the dry and wet states is suggested. 1981 SAE Transactions 810408. Considerations for Improvement of Conventional Motorcycle Brake Systems. John W. Zellner, Systems Technology, Inc., Hawthorne, CA; and Keith M. Klaber, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Factors involved in improving motorcycle brake systems and components are reviewed. Component and system functional requirements are reviewed from the stand- points of manual control factors, performance, and required operating conditions. Component response prop- erties of example contemporary machines are presented. Results show that, for motorcycle hydraulic disc systems, hysteresis, wet disc response, and other response features related to manual control can be key factors. 810409. Dynamometer Investigation of the Effects of Water on Motorcycle Disc Brake Pad Materials. J. W. Davis and N. D. Woodcock, Dunlop Ltd. Motorcycle disc brakes using conventional organic pad materials can exhibit performance unpredictability in wet weather. Testing under controlled dynamometer condi- tions indicates that the problem arises due to hydro- dynamic effects. Braking torque, in the presence of water on the disc, behaves as if pad/disc friction is negatively speed conscious. In extreme conditions effective braking may not occur until near zero speed. Sharp cut off of water delivery gives substantially instantaneous recovery to dry performance. A theorized explanation of wet behaviour of conven- tional materials has aided formulation and testing of sintered metal materials as a solution to the problem. 1981 SAE Transactions 810410. (P-91) Design Studies of Continuously Variable Transmissions for Electric Vehicles. Richard J. Parker, Stuart H. Loewenthal and George K. Fischer, National Aeronautics and Space Ad- ministration, Lewis Research Center, Cleveland, OH. Preliminary design studies were performed on four continuously variable transmission (CVT) concepts for use in advanced electric vehicles. A 1700 kg (3750 lb) vehicle with an energy storage flywheel was specified. Requirements of the CVTs were a maximum torque of 450 N-m (330 lb-ft), a maximum output power of 75 kW (100 hp), and a flywheel speed range of 28 000 to 14 000 rpm. The design of each concept was carried through the design layout stage. Power losses were determined over the ranges of operating conditions, and transmission effi- ciencies were calculated. The design studies were per- formed under contracts to NASA for DOE by Garrett/ AiResearch (toroidal traction CVT), Battelle Columbus Labs (steel V-belt CVT), Kumm Industries (flat belt variable diameter pulley CVT), and Bales-McCoin Trac- tionmatic (cone-roller traction CVT). 1981 SAE Transactions 810411. (P-91) Electronically Commutated dc Motors for Electric Vehicles. Edward A. Masłowski, National Aeronautics and Space Administra- tion, Lewis Research Centerģ A motor development program to explore the feasibility of electronically commutated dc motors (also known as brushless) for electric cars is described. Two different design concepts and a number of design variations based on these concepts are discussed. One design concept is based on a permanent magnet, medium-speed, machine rated at 7000-9000 rpm and powered via a transistor- 77</page><page sequence="59">810412-810418 inverter power conditioner. The other concept is based on a permanent magnet, high-speed, machine rated at 22,000-26,000 rpm and powered via a thyristor-inverter power conditioner. Test results are presented for a medium-speed motor and for a high-speed motor each of which have been fabricated using samarium-cobalt per- manent magnet material. 810412. (P-91) Development of a DC Motor Controller. Kenneth C. Winters and William B. Martin, Chrysler Corp., Huntsville, AL. A program is underway to develop an advanced DC motor controller for use on electric vehicles. This program has now completed the first phase where a functional model was designed, fabricated, and tested. A follow-on phase will extend the development to improve and expand the system in preparation for field tests. The system under development is a self-contained, high efficiency, high frequency, pulse-width-modulated motor controller which is low in weight and cost. Its design reduces audible noise and extends battery life by reduction of battery and motor ripple currents. 810413. (P-91) Voltage Considerations for Electric Ve- hicle Propulsion Systems. Arthur E. Raynard, AiResearch Manufacturing Co. of California, A Division of the Garrett Corp., Torrance, CA; and Earl S. Carr, Eagle-Picher Industries, Seneca, MO. A total of seventeen different electric vehicle propulsion systems were studied to select two designs which best met established cost and performance goals. Both systems were then examined to assess the effect of battery pack voltage on system performance and cost. The cost of the battery pack was the major factor in system voltage selection. A voltage range of 54 V to 540 V was considered, for battery pack capacity of 24 kW-hr. The highest battery specific energy (W-hr/Kg) and the lowest cost ($/kW-hr) were obtained at the minimum voltage level. The voltage considerations for the machinery were different for the two selected designs. The first system has an energy storage flywheel to provide power for accel- eration, so the dc traction motor and the battery are not subject to extreme peaks of power demand. The second system uses a brushless dc permanent magnet motor with electronic commutation, supplied by the power control unit must handle the peak power needed for acceleration. The second system is adversely affected when combined with the lowest battery voltage. 810414. (P-91) Characterization of the Near Term Elec- tric Vehicle (ETV-1) Breadboard Propulsion System Over the SAE J227a Driving Schedule "D". Noel B. Sargent and Miles O. Dustin, National Aeronautics and Space Administra- tion, Lewis Research Center, Cleveland, OH. The NASA-LeRC under the direction of DOE is respon- sible for the test and evaluation of electric and hybrid vehicle propulsion systems and components. In September 1978, a contracted effort was undertaken with the General Electric Company to design, fabricate, and deliver a propulsion system breadboard of the GE-NTEV (ETV-1). This breadboard is currently under test in the LeRC Road Load Simulator and its operational characteristics are the subject of this paper. 810416. (P-91) Zinc-Chloride Electric Engine™ Unit for Four-Passenger Electric Vehicle. J. Kiwalle and J. Galloway, Energy Development Associates, A Gulf + Western Co. Energy Development Associates, a division of Gulf + Western Industries, Inc., has undertaken the design and fabrication of a four-passenger electric car incor- porating state-of-the-art zinc-chloride battery technology. The purpose of the project is to demonstrate the viability of the zinc-chloride energy storage system as a practical alternative to cars powered by internal combustion engines. Significant among the project goals to be achieved is the attainment of a vehicle range three to four times that of current lead-acid battery-powered vehicles on a single battery charge. Progress to date on the project is discussed. It includes the design, specification, and fabrication of the battery, vehicle and its components, motor control system, and battery control microprocessor. 810417. (P-91) Electric Vehicle Battery Management. Clifford L. Hayden, GTE Service Corp., Stam- ford, CT. The assumption of most users and critics of electric vehicles is that the solution to a more efficient, higher performance vehicle is an improved battery. That as- sumption overlooks the benefits to be derived from improvement of related components and from improved management regimes. Between now and the time there is an advanced energy storage system that will be a low-maintenance, high energy-yield system, the conven- tional lead-acid battery can continue to perform the missions in a more efficient manner through development of improved management regimes. Of the nine major battery maintenance activities which affect the reliability and life of a conventional lead-acid battery, some rely simply on an understanding of the importance of the procedure to battery life, while others rely on more information from the battery manufacturers, and better diagnostic procedures for detecting weak or hot cells. If all the maintenance procedures could be detailed and components improved, performance could be increased by as much as 30% in actual use. 810418. (P-91) Performance Testing and System Eval- uation of the DOE ETV-1 Electric Vehicle. Donald W. Kurtz, Theodore W. Price and James A. Bryant, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California 78</page><page sequence="60">810419-810426 Institute of Technology. The DOE ETV-1 represents one of most advanced vehicles in operation today. Engineering tests are now being conducted by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in order to characterize its overall system performance and component efficiencies within the system environment. A chassis dynamometer is used in order to minimize the ambient effects and large uncertainties present in track testing. Extensive test requirements were defined and procedures were carefully controlled in order to maintain a high degree of credibility. Test results include an energy flow analysis through the major subsystems and incor- porate the aerodynamic and rolling losses under cyclic and various steady speed conditions. 1981 SA E Transactions 810419. (P-91) An Economical EV Data Compression System With Sensors. Edward J. Dowgiallo, Jr., US Army, MERADCOM, Fort Belvoir, VA; and Michael E. Johnson, Frank Pierce and Louis P. Civitello, VSE Corp. A data compression system has been constructed with software and hardware specific to the electric vehicle (EV). The system and sensors are described. The system is modular and consists of a signal condition board, an analog to digital conversion board, a 16 bit micro- processor and an integral tape recorder. The micro- processor forms a trip histogram consisting of a map of average electrical and mechanical power, average velocity and time based on vehicle mechanical power and velocity intervals. Regenerative braking energy is distinguished. Temperature, voltage, current and power extreme param- eters are recorded with time. Discharges are recorded based on battery depletion or at charge initiation. Charge parameters are sampled every three minutes. A tape should last one month in typical EV operations. 810420. The Design of Trailing Twist Axles. Terry L. Satchell, Pontiac Motor Div., General Motors Corp. Trailing twist axles represent a relatively new type of rear suspension system that is becoming more common with the increasing number of front wheel drive vehicles. The design of the axle structure must account for the complex interactions of the placement and type of sub-components used to meet the load carrying, geomet- ric, and roll control requirements of the suspension. The crossbeam placement is the primary variable in control- ling suspension parameters. 810421. Rear Suspension Design with Front Wheel Drive Vehicles. Herbert Horntrich, Volkswagenwerk AG. A review of the last 20 years of rear suspension design has not shown a dominant position for one type of axle. This indicates a good balance of advantages and disadvantages between rear axles built today. The evaluation scheme described here based on the criteria economy, handling and comfort is therefore helpful when choosing the appropriate axle type for a given purpose. The characteristic features of - Rigid axle - Trailing arm axle - Semi trailing arm axle - Spring strut axle - Trailing arm torsion beam axle are discussed and their suitability for front wheel drive is examined. 1981 SA E Transactions 810422. Front Wheel Drive Concepts. Franz G. Behles and Manfred A. Schneeweiss, Audi NSU Auto Union AG (Ingolstadt, Germany). Front Wheel Drive concepts differ in the position of engine and transmission relative to the front wheels and to each other. A classification into 5 concepts is made and a description of their individual development, advantages, and problems is given. 1981 SA E Transactions 810423. New High-Strength As-Hot-Rolled and Cold- Drawm Bar Products. R. A. Joseph, D. R. DiMicco, D. W. Dickinson, M. H. Thomas, C. A. Martini, Jr. and D. H. Tostenson, Republic Steel Corp. A new series of high-strength, low-alloy bar products has been developed that provides the design engineer with steels having minimum yield strengths of 80, 90 and 100 ksi in the as-hot-rolled condition and 110 to 150 ksi minimum yield strengths in the cold-drawn or cold-drawn, stress-relieved condition. The potential benefits of these products include energy savings, cost savings and weight reduction. 810424. A New High Performance, Cost Effective, Car- burizing Grade Alloy Steel. R. B. Bertolo, R. T. Ault and R. H. Cobbett, Republic Steel Corp. A 1.8 Ni-0.60 Cr-0.12 V alloy steel has been developed for use in carburizing applications. Hardenability, strength, toughness, and fatigue tests have been conducted on this material. Comparisons were made with the properties of several standard nickel alloy steels including 4620, 4320, 3310, and 4815 which show that the Ni-Cr-V alloy performs at least as well as the 1.8% Ni grades (4620, 4320) and approaches, and in some instances equals or exceeds, the 3.5% Ni grades (3310, 4815). The Ni-Cr-V alloy can provide a cost effective substitute for these more costly high nickel grades. 810426. Research and Development of Microalloyed Me- dium Carbon Steels. Sukehisa Niwa and Isao Machida, Honda R&amp;D Co., Ltd.; and Tetsuo 79</page><page sequence="61">810427-810430 Kato, Norioki Uyehara and Yoshiharu Tanaka, Daido Steel Co., Ltd., R&amp;D Div. The hardness of microalloyed medium carbon steels is affected significantly by chemical compositions and the conditions in hot forging. Authors investigated first the effect of chemical compositions on the strength of medium carbon steels and introduced "Hardness Equiv- alent Parameter", H^. By this parameter, it becomes possible to design the steels for automobile components with various strengths. Then authors examined the effect of hot working conditions on the mechanical properties of the microalloyed steels and obtained the proper proces- sing conditions for them. After the research programs authors carried out the running test of engine and suspension components built in a passenger car and certified that the microalloyed steels possess satisfactory properties as forged. 810427. Improving the Method of Hydrocarbon Analysis. Joachim Staab and Jörg D. Baronick, Volks- wagenwerk AG (Germany); and Armin Kronei- sen, Hartmann &amp; Braun AG (Germany). Measurements of hydrocarbon compounds in automotive exhaust gas with the current instrumentation are not accurate. Systematic errors up to 20 per cent can be observed. The pertinent regulations, furthermore, contain insufficient specifications of the instruments. A research project aimed at a definition of standardized data, to decrease the measuring errors of hydrocarbon analyzers by one order of magnitude. By detailed investigations of the functional parts and of the working parameters of the instruments the flame ionization detectors were to be improved. The systematic errors caused by hydrocarbon structures or by a different oxygen content of the gas sample could be reduced to approximately two per cent on a prototype analyzer. Standardized data were derived for future legislation and future development of instruments. 810428. Automotive Paint System Hydrocarbon Control at a Practical Cost. James H. Mueller, REECO, Regenerative Environmental Equipment Co., Inc., Morris Plains, NJ. The automobile industry, and others, require a quality product paint finish at a practical cost. EPA emission requirements and energy costs have stimulated many alternate solutions. These alternates include water based compounds, solvent recovery systems, energy efficient incineration and efficient energy recovery systems. This paper discusses alternate techniques currently available. Included are cost comparisons which show techniques of how an existing automotive paint system can meet the VOC emission requirements while reducing energy costs. A summary will show a financial payback while meeting VOC control requirements, reducing energy consumption and maintaining product quality. 810429. On-Line Characterization of Vehicle Emissions by FT-IR and Mass Spectrometry. James W. Butler, Paul D. Maker, Thomas J. Korniski and Larry P. Haack, Ford Motor Co., Scientific Research Lab. A gas analysis system is described which is composed of a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer, a quadrupole mass spectrometer, and a total hydrocarbon analyzer. This combination of instrumentation along with a unique sampling system allows on-line analysis of regulated and non-regulated emissions. Data are presented demonstrat- ing the system's capability for analysis of regulated and non-regulated emissions from catalyzed and non-cata- lyzed exhaust. To demonstrate the accuracy of the analysis system, both oxygen and carbon mass balance data are given for an experiment involving the three/way catalysis of a steady-state gas stream synthesized to resemble the exhaust from a gasohol fueled engine. The use of these techniques for the analysis of vehicle emissions is also demonstrated. 810430. Characterization of Emissions from Methanol and Methanol/Gasoline Blended Fuels. Dennis Schuetzle, Thomas J. Prater and Richard D. Anderson, Scientific Research Lab., Dearborn, MI. Research was undertaken to characterize the potential differences in the chemical composition of precatalyst and postcatalyst exhaust gases from engines fueled with methanol/gasoline blends, (20/80 volume %-designated as M-20) pure alcohol and gasoline. Results were developed from both steady-state engine tests and transient CVS vehicle tests. A heated CVS system was developed for sampling emissions to minimize significant oxygenated hydrocarbon sample losses commonly encountered in the standard CVS sampling procedure. Gas chromatogra- phy/mass spectrometry(GC/MS) was used for charac- terizing the emissions. Minimal losses of methanol emissions were found using the described sampling and analysis system. The only significant qualitative differ- ences observed in the hydrocarbon emissions generated by engines burning pure Indolene clear compared to the M-20 fuel was the significant presence of unburned methanol and in some cases traces of ethanol in the exhaust of the M-20 fueled vehicle. The Indolene clear and M-20 fuels did not produce significantly different quantities of total aldehyde emissions. Methanol com- prised from 2 to 20 mole% of the total hydrocarbon emissions from using M-20, depending upon the operating conditions. Greater than 98 mole% of the hydrocarbon and oxygenated hydrocarbon emissions from an engine burning pure methanol were unburned methanol and aldehydes. 1981 SA E Transactions 80</page><page sequence="62">810431-810438 810431. A Wiegand Effect Transmission-Mounted Speed Sender. J. David Marks, The Echlin Manufac- turing Co. A new magnetic circuit design for the Wiegand Effect has resulted in a rugged, stable transmission-mounted speed signal generator to provide a digital speedometer/odom- eter readout, and to provide an input for microprocessor vehicle management systems. The device requires no electrical input, and delivers a uniform signal at TTL level from zero speed. It can directly replace existing flexible cable drives. 810432. A Physical Understanding of Solid State Humid- ity Sensors. William J. Fleming, Research Lab- oratories, General Motors Corp., Warren, MI. In an effort to produce a humidity sensor suitable for automotive applications, an investigation was made of solid state sensors which change electrical impedance as a function of humidity. Physical models are presented which describe operation of the sensors. Measured impedance characteristics of humidity sensors are ex- plained in terms of the following mechanisms: (1) physical adsorption of water vapor, (2) dissociation of water molecules, (3) electrical conduction by means of a Grotthuss chain reaction, (4) electrostatic fields associated with surface-layer complexes, and (5) electrolytic con- duction inside capillary pores. 1981 SAE Transactions 810433. Oxygen Sensing by Electrochemical Pumping. R. E. Hetrick, W. A. Fate and W. C. Vassell, Engineering and Research Staff, Research, Ford Motor Co., Dearborn, MI. A high temperature 02 sensor is described based on electrochemical pumping with a ceramic structure incor- porating two Zr02 02 concentration cells. Two modes of operation, steady state and oscillatory, are described. In each case at least a linear sensitivity to ambient 02 concentration can be achieved. A potential application is that of exhaust-gas 02 sensing for the feedback control of intake air-to-fuel ratios at values lean of stoichiometry. 1 981 SA E Transactions 810434. Strain-Controlled Fatigue Properties of Hot- Rolled DQSK Steel Compared with Those of EX-TEN F50 and Dual Phase 80 Steels. J. M. Holt, U. S. Steel Research Lab., Monroeville, PA. Monotonie-tension and low-cycle strain-controlled fatigue tests were performed on longitudinal specimens from three sheets of drawing-quality special-killed (DQSK) steel. The results showed that DQSK steel exhibits a tendency to cyclically soften. When straight lines were fitted to the data for each of the four relationships, the slopes and intercepts of the lines were not different for the sheets investigated. When the results of DQSK steel were compared with previously reported results for USS EX-TEN F50 and U SS Dual Phase 80 steels, the total-strain amplitude - reversal data showed little difference among the three grades. However, as expected, the elastic-strain - reversal data and the stress - reversal data were ranked in order of the tensile strength and the plastic-strain - reversal data were ranked in order of monotonie elongation, especially at the longer lives. 1981 SA E Transactions 810435. Fatigue Life Predictions for High Strength Steels in Automotive Applications. A. M. Sherman, R. G. Davies and A. R. Krause, Metallurgy Dept., Research Staff, Ford Motor Co., Dearborn, MI. A computer-based technique was used to produce fatigue life predictions for a variety of steels using service histories recorded from several automotive components. The materials considered, both hot and cold-rolled sheets, ranged in yield strength from 200 MPa (30 ksi) to 580 M Pa (84 ksi) and included most of the steels currently under consideration for material substitution to achieve vehicle weight reduction. The results of these computa- tions were used to produce estimates of the weight savings potential, in fatigue limited designs, of the substitution of higher strength materials for conventional hot or cold- rolled low carbon steel; the indicated weight savings were from 16 to 50% depending on the nature of the loading of the component. The wide variation in savings is an indication of the importance of design in the engineering for minimum weight. Differences in the fatigue notch sensitivities of the materials were found to be an important factor in the predicted fatigue lives. These results also show that the relative ranking of the materials for weight saving potential is for the most part the same for the four service histories tested. 1981 SAE Transactions 810436. Fatigue Behavior of Steel-Sheet Fabrication Details. K. H. Klippstein, U. S. Steel Corp., Research Lab, Monroeville, PA. This paper presents a discussion of the stress-range fatigue-design concept, including the results for 77 welded and cold-formed steel-sheet specimens exposed to con- stant-amplitude stress cycles with stress ratios of 0.02 to 0.34. The test specimens were fabricated from steels with yield strengths ranging from 30 through 80 ksi and included 7 types of details. The results are compared with stress-range curves used for welded steel-plate details. It appears that these curves can also be applied to the design of steel-sheet details such as those used in the ground- transportation and agricultural-equipment industries. 1 981 SAE Transactions 810438. Impact of Gasohol on Automobile Evaporative and Tailpipe Emissions. John M. Lang, Northrop 81</page><page sequence="63">810439-810442 Services, Inc., Research Triangle Park, NC; and Frank M. Black, U. S. Environmental Protection Agency. National interest is growing in the use of gasohol, a blend of ethanol and unleaded gasoline, as an alternate fuel to gasoline. In order to assess its viability as a transportation fuel, gasohol's impact on vehicle emissions, fuel economy, and driveability must be considered, along with the cost of production and the physical compatibility of ethanol with gasoline. Both tailpipe and evaporative emissions were exam- ined on two passenger cars, a 1979 Ford Mustang II and a 1979 Ford LTD II. In addition to determining total hydrocarbon, ethanol, carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides content, fuel economy and driveability were also examined. The procedures used for emissions measure- ment are described in the Federal Register for LDV Certification. Five fuels were used in the program, including two base fuels and three gasohol blends, each car tested with the fuels in sequential order. Generally, the addition of ethanol to gasoline reduced tailpipe emissions of hydro- carbons and carbon monoxide, but increased emissions of nitrogen oxides. Since the stoichiometric air/fuel (A/F) ratio for ethanol is lower than that for gasoline, adding ethanol to gasoline results in a lean shift in combustion stoichiometry, which generally results in a decrease of hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide emissions and an increase in oxides of nitrogen emissions. Coldstart driveability problems were experienced with the LTD II. Little change in fuel economy was observed with either vehicle. The use of gasohol substantially increased the evaporative emissions of both vehicles. Two final areas examined during this program were the adequacy of a one hour test period for determination of hot soak evaporative emissions and the sensitivity of the emissions to vehicle preconditioning. Hot soak evaporative emissions increased during the second hour of examination and both tailpipe and evaporative emissions were sensitive to vehicle preconditioning. 810439. Fuel Tolerance Tests with the Ford PROCO Engine. M. A. Choma, P. H. Havstad, A. O. Simko and W. F. Stockhausen, Ford Motor Co. A variety of fuel tolerance tests were conducted utilizing Ford's PROCO engine, a direct fuel injection stratified charge engine developed for light duty vehicles. These engine tests were run on the dynamometer and in vehicles. Data indicate an 89 RON octane requirement, relatively low sensitivity to volatility characteristics and good fuel economy, emission control and operability on a certain range of petroleum fuel and alcohol mixes including 100% methanol. Fuels such as JP-4 and Diesel fuel are not at present suitable for this engine. There were no engine modifications tested that might improve the match between the engine and a particular fuel. The 100% methanol test was conducted with a modified fuel injection pump. Durability aspects including compatibility of various fuels with the materials in the fuel system were not addressed. 810440. Contra Costa County's One-Year Experience with Gasohol. L. M. Gibbs, Chevron Research Co.; and B. J. Gilbert, Contra Costa County. Starting August 1, 1979, a one-year gasohol test was conducted by Contra Costa County. A total of 30 county pool cars were on test - 15 on gasohol and 15 similar cars on gasoline as a control group. Findings were as follows. There were no fuel-related maintenance problems in either the gasohol or gasoline groups of cars. Cool weather driveability for the gasohol cars was the same or better than gasoline cars. No vapor lock or other hot driveability problems were reported for either fuel. Fuel economy of the gasohol cars was about 5% poorer than that of the gasoline cars. Fuel system deposits with gasohol were increased and differed in character compared to gasoline. Also, the gasohol car- buretors showed more inlet needle valve tip wear. However, to date, the observed deposits and wear with gasohol have not caused any apparent problems. 1981 SA E Transactions 810441. A Comparison of the Emissions of Polynuclear Aromatic Hydrocarbons from Automobiles Using Gasoline or a Methanol/Gasoline Blend. Ulf Stenberg and Tomas Alsberg, Dept. of Ana- lytical Chemistry, Arrhenius Lab., Univ. of Stockholm; and Britt Marie Bertilsson, Swedish Methanol Development Co. Individual poylnuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) were measured in the exhaust gas from gasoline and gasoline/methanol blend fueled vehicles. Driving cycle tests as well as constant speed conditions were used. Exhaust emission samples were collected on filters together with a condenser. Eleven PAHs were quantified by gas chromatography and FID. PAHs in the fuels were also determined. There was no consistent difference in the amount of PAH-emission when the two fuels, gasoline and the gasoline/methanol blend, were compared. The emissions contain specific PAHs that cannot be found in the fuel. 810442. (SP-480) Regional Refining Models for Trans- portation Fuels from Shale Oil and Coal Syn- crudes. Norman R. Sefer, Southwest Research Institute. Refinery linear programming models were developed for Rocky Mountain, Mid-Continent, and Great Lakes regions to make future product volumes and qualities that were forecast for 1995. Shale oil and coal oil syncrudes were introduced as part of the raw materials slate. Cases were run to evaluate 82</page><page sequence="64">810443-810449 conventional products, maximum diesel fuel, and broad- cut fuel in all regions. Methanol, ethanol, MTBE, or synthetic naphtha were evaluated at 10 percent each in gasoline blends along with syncrude components. Composition and qualities of the fuels were deter- mined. Effects on raw materials, energy consumption, and investment costs indicate somewhat more benefits for broadcut fuel than for maximizing diesel fuel. Gasoline supplements also show advantages in raw materials and energy consumption. 810443. (SP-480) Methyl Aryl Ethers from Coal Liquids as Gasoline Extenders and Octane Improvers. Gary M. Singerman, Gulf Research &amp; Devel- opment Co. A mixture of methyl aryl ethers derived from the phenols present in direct liquefaction coal liquids shows consid- erable promise as a gasoline blending agent and octane improver. The mixture of methyl aryl ethers was blended at five volume per cent with a commercial, unleaded gasoline. The properties and performance of the blend in a variety of laboratory and automotive tests is reported. The tests show that the mixture of methyl aryl ethers improves gasoline octane without degrading other gasoline prop- erties. 810444. (SP-480) Emergency Transportation Fuels: Prop- erties and Performance. Brent K. Bailey and John A. Russell, Southwest Research Institute. A variety of multicomponent emergency transportation fuel formulations (diesel and spark) are evaluated by means of bench tests, single and multicylinder engine dynamometer tests, and chassis dynamometer tests. A wide range of alcohol and liquid hydrocarbon extenders are evaluated according to the tradeoff between per- formance loss and base fuel stretch-out with increasing extender concentration. Changes in gaseous exhaust emissions are also given in relative terms as a function of extender concentration. Detailed chemical composition and physical properties of blend combinations and individual blend constituents are also included. Collec- tively, these data form the basis for the DOE Emergency Fuel Utilization Guidebook. 1981 SA E Transactions 810445. (SP-480) Solid Fuel Applications to Transpor- tation Engines. Richard L. Rentz and Thomas J. Timbario, Mueller Associates, Inc.; and Roy A. Renner, Consulting Mechanical Engineer. The direct utilization of minimally processed solid fuels (particularly coal) in transportation engines is assessed. Both highway and non-highway applications are consid- ered. In general, solid fuels do not seem appropriate for highway transportation in the 1980-2000 time frame. Such fuels can be utilized for non-highway transportation with some engine types. Both technical and environmental issues are explored and a systems approach for studying the topical area is stressed. The paper features a brief historic review and current update on activities in the area of direct solid fuels utilization in transportation engines. 810446. Engine Transmission Matching. R. H. Thring, Ricardo Consulting Engineers Ltd. A study has been carried out, aimed at improving passenger car economy by better matching of the engine and transmission. Vehicle simulation was carried out which showed that a reduction of 25% in fuel consumed is theoretically possible. Engine development was carried out which showed that the results of valve timing changes were small, but the four valve cylinder head tested gave better economy than the two valve cylinder head over the whole engine operating range. Resulting from a study of transmissions, it is recommended that two wide span transmissions be developed - a six speed semi-automatic and an eight speed fully automatic. 1981 SA E Transactions 810447. Dynamic Computer Simulation of a Vehicle with Electronic Engine Control. R. G. DeLosh, K. J. Brewer, L. H. Buch and T. F. W. Ferguson, Advanced Engine Engineering Office, Ford Motor Co., Allen Park, MI; and W. E. Tobler, Engineering and Research Staff, Ford Motor Co., Dearborn, MI. A computer model which simulates the dynamic inter- actions among the components of the engine, electronic control system, and drivetrain is described. The model consists of a combination of experimental data and mathematical submodels representing components and physical phenomena. The model also contains a simu- lation of the human driver which can follow the FTP speed trace, and which can perform a variety of other tests. Use of the model is demonstrated with a study of air/fuel transients due to manifold filling. 810448. An Identification Approach to Throttle-Torque Modeling. R. L. Morris, H. G. Hopkins and R. H. Borcherts, Engineering and Research Staff, Ford Motor Co., Dearborn, MI. A low order sampled data description of the response of output shaft torque to throttle opening is described. Based upon a sampling interval of one engine revolution, the resulting fourth order dynamic model is applicable over the range of 600-2000 rpm (vehicle speed 0-60 mph) for a 5.7 liter feedback carbureted engine and automatic transmission. Physical principles are used to set up a sampled data block diagram of the system and Landau's hyperstable identification algorithm is then used to determine the parameters of the model. 810449. Mathematical Model of a Throttle Body Fuel Injection System. Robert V. Esperti, Delco 83</page><page sequence="65">810450-810454 Electronics Div., Santa Barbara Operations, General Motors Corp. A functional model of a throttle body fuel injection system is described. Although developed primarily as a tool for determining sensitivities of air/fuel ratio to component characteristics and computed variables, it also permits statistical analysis of air/fuel ratio and compu- tation of voltage compensation factors. The model consists of the system sensors and electronics; the fuel subsystem hardware, comprising the fuel pump, fuel lines, pressure regulator, and fuel injectors; and the micro- processor software. Both hypothetical and actual software can be simulated. 810450. A Microprocessor System Simulation of Engine Control Modules. William B. Galles, Delco Electronics Div., General Motors Corp. An IBM-370 microprocessor system simulation is pres- ently being developed to simulate engine control modules. It can simulate any of the production microprocessor engine control modules presently designed by Delco Electronics. It is a system simulation and includes bit for bit models of the microprocessor which use the actual microprocessor ROM code as well as the transducer and I/O chip models required to describe the presently designed engine control modules. It can and has been used for error or sensitivity analysis, software verification, and engineering analysis of hardware and software changes. It is an accurate, easy to use, and versatile tool for these purposes. This paper describes this micropro- cessor system simulation using examples to illustrate its capabilities, features, and uses. 810451. Predictive Methodology for Automotive Elec- tronics Reliability in the 1980's. J. B. King, Electrical and Electronics Division, Ford Motor Company. The automotive industry is presently experiencing a rapid escalation in the use of electronic products for the control of vital vehicle functions. Reliability of semiconductors and electronic components or, more specifically, relia- bility of the system to the full extent required by the automotive industry demands extraordinary levels of discipline from initial design to the manufacturing process and testing. Additionally, since product technology is far from being mature and in most instances is at the verge of state-of-the-art, a technique must be developed to accu- rately predict failure prior to the systems' accumulating production experience. To this end an Electronics Reli- ability Subcommittee was formed within the Society of Automotive Enginners' Electronics Systems Committee in October 1978 with the expressed charter of establishing procedures for the prediction and evaluation of the reliability of electronic devices, subassemblies and systems for automotive applications. Currently, the only recog- nized model that can be used for the prediction of reliability is MIL HDBK 217C. There are, however, many shortfalls inherent to this model. The most significant pitfalls are that the data base used in the model is not current and is not representative of the automotive environment. This paper presents some of the issues that are faced in the prediction of reliability and describes the efforts currently undertaken by the Electronics Reliability Subcommittee for the development of a predictive methodology for automotive electronics reliability in the 1980's. 810452. Reliability Prediction of Automotive Electronics. Steven J. Flint, IIT Research Institute/Relia- bility Analysis Center. This paper will discuss the need for a viable reliability prediction methodology for electronic components and assemblies used in automotive applications. Existing prediction techniques (such as MIL-HDBK-217) will be discussed and their suitability for use by the automotive industry evaluated. Characteristics of a useful prediction model will be identified and suggestions for implementing such a technique will be proposed. 810453. A Temperature-Cycled Operational Screen for Automotive Electronic Control Units. L. L. Kent, The Bendix Corp. This paper will describe the use of a "Temperature-Cycled Operational Screen" in the high volume manufacturing process of an OEM electronic engine control unit as part of an overall reliability program. This thermal burn-in was effective at identifying intermittent component and workmanship defects, and it was instrumental in reducing the product warranty failure rate. This screen was effective through use of static and dynamic thermal stress and by use of full operational testing with power cycling. Because of its relatively short duration, it was possible to put the screen into a production sequence. 1981 SAE Transactions 810454. Heat Engine Requirements for Advanced Solar Thermal Power Systems. L. D. Jaffe and H. Q. Pham, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA. A power conversion subsystem consisting of an engine, an alternator, and auxiliaries is an important portion of most parabolic dish solar thermal power systems. Requirements and constraints have been established for such power conversion subsystems in the post- 1985 time frame on the basis of expected needs of commercial parabolic dish power systems. To be competitive with conventional power systems, solar thermal systems using dish concen- trators will need power conversion subsystems rated at less than 40 kW, with a net efficiency of 40 percent at full power and 37 percent at half-power. Time between major overhauls should be at least 50,000 hours of solar operations. Minor maintenance and lubrication for a 84</page><page sequence="66">810455-810459 production subsystem should not exceed four times per year and, if possible, should not take more than one man-hour each time. The subsystem should operate properly at any angle to the horizontal. Cost targets include a factory price of $180 per kilowatt electric for the power conversion subsystem, and operation, maintenance and replacement cost averaging 0.1C per kilowatt hour for 30 years of solar operation (1980 dollars). These targets are for a production rate of 25,000 engines per year. 810455. Applicability of Advanced Automotive Heat En- gines to Solar Thermal Power. Donald G. Beremand, David G. Evans and Donald L. Alger, National Aeronautics and Space Admin- istration, Lewis Research Center, Cleveland, OH. The NASA Lewis Research Center (LeRC) as Product Manager of the Department of Energy's Automotive Heat Engine Program, is developing advanced gas turbine and Stirling engines for automobiles. To accomplish the program goals of improved fuel economy, reduced emissions, and broad alternative fuel capability major development programs have been undertaken for both engines. These programs are described along with the predicted characteristics of the engines under devel- opment and the key technology problems that must be resolved to achieve these objectives. NASA LeRC is also responsible for the development of the power conversion systems for the Parabolic Dish Solar Thermal Power Systems being developed for the Department of Energy by the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The requirements of this solar thermal application are reviewed and compared with the predicted characteristics of the automobile engines under development. A good match was found in terms of power level and efficiency when the automobile engines, designed for maximum powers of 65-100 kW (87 to 133 hp) were operated to the nominal 20-40 kW electric output requirement of the solar thermal application. At these reduced power levels it appears that the automotive gas turbine and Stirling engines have the potential to deliver the 40+ percent efficiency goal of the solar thermal program. However, in-depth studies are required to determine the extent of modifications required to adapt the engines for the solar application, and to fully assess the probable life, durability and resultant efficiency that can realistically be achieved in this application. 810456. The Stirling Engine - A Ready Candidate for Solar Thermal Power. Christer Bratt, Sten Holgersson and H. G. Nelving, KB United Stirling AB &amp; Co. (Sweden); and W. H. Percival, United Stirling, Inc. The paper describes Stirling engine developments at United Stirling of Sweden and the adaptation of their 4-95 double-acting engine as an efficient solar energy converter receiving heat from a parabolic dish concentrator. The engine needs only minor modifications to match re- quirements of a solar heated powerplant. New heat- er/receiver designs are described, including the relation of tube geometry to solar flux patterns. The 4-95 engine to be installed for a 1981 DOE demonstration program is predicted to achieve a thermal efficiency of 35 percent at a power output of 22 kW. 810457. Development of a Small, Free-Piston Stirling Engine, Linear- Alternator System for Solar Ther- mal Electric Power Applications. George R. Dochat, Free-Piston Stirling Engine Program Office, Mechanical Technology, Inc., Latham, NY. The development of free-piston Stirling engines which can meet broad system applications, for example heat- activated heat pumps, electric generator sets, and solar thermal power applications, has been an ongoing effort over the last several years. Free-piston Stirling engines, while having inherently high efficiency, have a number of other attractive features which are considered necessary for solar thermal electric power systems. The elimination of oil from the system, incorporation of clearance seals, operation with gas bearings, and the feature of having only two moving parts offer the potential for long life, high reliability, and maintenance-free operation. This paper presents a summary of the development of FPSEs for various applications, including designs for small, dispersed solar thermal power, leading to the conceptual design of a small 3- to 5-kWc electric output solar thermal module. 810458. Computer Aided Experiment System for Auto- motive Engine Research and Development by Using Optical Data-Highway. T. Toyoda, T. Inoue and S. Koganemaru, Higashifuji Tech- nical Center, Toyota Motor Co.; A. Izeki and M. Fujita, Fujifacom Corp. A computer aided experiment system utilizing optical fiber communication has been developed for automotive engine research and development at the Toyota Higashi- fuji Technical Center. The objectives of this system are to establish both low and high speed data acquisition and processing capability by introducing minicomputer based intelligent terminals and connecting them by optical fiber cable to a special processor controlling a group of the terminals. A host computer controls the special processors and the whole system works as a hierarchical and distributed function system. By introducing this system, high speed data sampling and online data processing become possible at every test bench. 810459. A Microprocessor-Based Recorder System for Data Logging in Customer and Longterm-Test Vehicles. Ch. Tscheuschner and D. Kinne, 85</page><page sequence="67">810460-810464 Volkswagenwerk AG; and F. Gliem, Technical Univ. of Braunschweig. A microprocessor controlled recorder was developed for unattended long term data logging in test and customer vehicles. Its task is to record the operating characteristics in vehicles under severe environmental conditions. Addi- tionally the entering data stream has to be preprocessed because of very limited storage capacity. 810460. Vehicle Performance Testing with Microproces- sor Based Instrumentation. Duane E. Johnson and Thomas E. Austin, Laboratory Equipment Corp. (LABECO); and William F. Van Ostrand, Eltek Corp. (Consultant for Laboratory Equip- ment). A portable microprocessor based fuel flow and distance measurement instrument has been developed which can perform distance, speed, and acceleration measurements using a standard fifth wheel and simultaneously measure fuel volume, calculate mass flow and totalize the fuel consumption using a positive displacement flowmeter. Efficiency ratios such as miles per gallon and liters per 100 kilometers are also provided. Included are a 6-digit display for time, distance, volume, and flow totalization and a 4-digit display for speed, acceleration, mass flow, volume flow, fuel temperature, and efficiency; plus two selectable analog outputs. This paper describes the design objectives, operation, and additional special features of the instrument. 810461. Advantages of Using Microcomputers in Dy- namometer Controllers. Severino D'Angelo and R. D. Gafford, Horiba Instruments, Inc. Dynamometer controllers incorporating digital microcom- puters are generally more accurate and hold their accuracy longer than their analog counterparts. Fur- thermore, the digital microcomputer can perform a multitude of other tasks normally not possible with an analog controller. This paper describes the implementa- tion and the results of the following four microcomputer functions. 1. Digital Speed Measurement . This requires a shaft encoder and a digital signal conditioner in addition to a microcomputer. The speed signal obtained with this system is free of drift, requires no calibration and has a resolution of 0.01% of reading. 2. Automatic Calibration of Parasitic Losses and Torque Signal € This is a procedure fully implemented in software, requiring approximately three minutes to execute. The automatic calibration and the drift-free speed measurement make it unnecessary to calibrate the dynamometer controller manually. 3. Torque Signal Linearization . This is accomplished by using a lookup table and a linear curve fitting technique. The linearization substantially increases the measurement accuracy at low torque values. 4. Dynamometer Set-up Procedure. This is simplified by recalling all the necessary test parameters with one control key. Some of the test parameters included are the three road load coefficients, electric inertia, flywheel combination, parasitic losses compensation and coast down speed trigger points. The possible number of sets of test parameters is essentially unlimited. They are stored in a battery back-up, non- volatile CMOS memory. 810462. Colenoid Actuators - Further Developments in Extremely Fast Acting Solenoids. A. H. Seilly, Lucas Industries Ltd. (U. K.). SAE paper 790119 on "Helenoid Actuators" introduced a novel solenoid construction giving high armature accel- erations. Another design has been conceived which operates at least as fast as the Helenoid actuators and is named the "Colenoid" actuator because of its conical armature shape. The paper will compare this innovation with conven- tional solenoids and the difference in its characteristics with the Helenoid actuator concept. The Colenoid and Helenoid armatures are capable of travel times of less than one millisecond irrespective of preload or masses. Which type of actuator for a given application will be reviewed. 1981 SAE Transactions 810463. Electronically Controlled Actuators - A Proper Means to Improve Fuel Economy. Harald Col- Ionia and Werner Hornfeck, VDO Adolf Schindling AG (Schwalbach/West-Germany). In comparison to the mechanical linkage between accel- erator pedal and throttle valve, an "Electric accelerator unit", developed by VDO, makes it possible to assess the position of the pedal not, as has been customary, as an "order" from the driver, but as a "request". It is left up to the electronic control module to set the proper fuel economy-oriented engine condition on the basis of given input data, such as rotational speed, vehicle speed, temperature, gear setting, etc. A number of applications, already proven advanta- geous in practice such as Electronic Accelerator with: Integrated Cruise Control/Speed Limiting Integrated rpm-Limiting Charge pressure Limiting Cylinder-Shut-Off are described. Another control unit which provides fuel economy is the idle speed control using a controllable air bypass. With this unit it is possible to reduce the idle speed down to the lowest possible engine speed, which can save approx. 15% on fuel in city traffic. 810464. Electro-Pneumatic Control Valve for EGR/ATC Actuation. Endre A. Mayer, The Bendix Corp. The dual solenoid control valve was initially designed as a low cost interface element between digital electronics and an automotive vacuum-spring motor such as the one 86</page><page sequence="68">810465-810473 found on Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) valves. By using two coaxially located normally closed solenoids continuous air bleed is not required from the vacuum source. The direct acting solenoids have a large 0.5 SCFM flow capacity and a quick six millisecond opening and two millisecond closing time. The unit is well suited for pulse width modulation control. Ambient tests were conducted from -40° F to +250° F without any significant change in the performance characteristics of the unit. Possible applications for this electro-vacuum interface are in EGR valve control, Automatic Temperature Control (ATC), and as a remote throttle actuator on diesel engines. 810465. VMOS Power Transistors in Automotive Sys- tems - An Update. Richard Blanchard, Supertex, Inc. The VMOS power transistor has undergone a steady series of improvements since its introduction in the mid 1970's. The current and voltage handling capabilities of this class of transistors have each increased by more than a factor of ten. The present status of VMOS power transistors as elements in automotive systems is covered in this paper. Emphasis is placed on the electrical characteristics that set these devices apart from bipolar transistors. Future directions in the development of VMOS power transistor technology are also discussed. 1981 SAE Transactions 810466. GMC Fiberglass Truck Door. R. Keith Cadman, James D. Cote' and Del C. Schroeder, GMC Truck and Coach Div., Div. of General Motors Corp., Pontiac, MI. A new fiberglass door was designed to replace steel doors on GMC heavy duty trucks as a quality improvement while reducing cost and weight. A feasibility study led to the selection of SMC for the door material. The new design incorporated unique design features and innovative materials applications. Finite element analysis was used to determine optimum material distribution for reducing stress and weight and for increasing stiffness. A test program was conducted which verified the design criteria and objectives were met. 810467. Automated Lamination of Production Advanced Composite Aircraft Structures. John Huber, Grumman Aerospace Corp. One of the principal manufacturing benefits of using advanced composites is the reduction in the number of parts needed to fabricate an aircraft structure. To realize the full potential of this benefit, however, the number of manual handling operations required to build-up a large laminate from many smaller plies of uncured material must be significantly reduced. This paper will describe a system which has demonstrated that an automated approach to advanced composite lamination can dra- matically increase the productivity of advanced composite aircraft structures. 1981 SAE Transactions 810468. Processing Continuous Filament Composite Ma- terials. Glenn W. Ewald, Goldsworthy Engi- neering, Inc. Fabricating products of continuous filament composite materials is no longer restricted to helical lathe-type filament winding and constant-area "profile" pultrusion. Although these basic processes are still important, new primary processes are being developed as composites are called upon to meet new structural and economic needs of industry. Continuous tube winding, pulforming, and pin or frame winding are three new processes currently being used for the production of high strength composite products in which precisely oriented reinforcements are necessary. This paper describes these new processes with empha- sis on the equipment used in the production environment. 1981 SAE Transactions 810471. Crash Data Analysis and Model Validation Using Correlation Techniques. Jovan Jovanovski, Ford Motor Co. This paper presents a quantitative comparison technique for evaluating similarities between sets of data resulting from a common random process. The normalized integral square error (NISE) criterion is derived using correlation techniques and is applied to deceleration-time histories obtained from six vehicle crash tests in an attempt to relate the vehicle response to the crash event. Inter- comparison of the six sets of data using NISE suggests that differences in amplitude and phase shift may account for much of the discrepancy between sets of test data. That is, the magnitude and the time of occurrence of deceleration peaks determine to a large extent the value of the comparator, NISE. These discrepancies in phase shift and amplitude are examined further with the breakdown of NISE into components which isolate errors due to phase shift and amplitude. We find that differences in phase shift account for most of the error detected by the NISE criterion. Two sets of data resulting from computer simulations of vehicle crashes are also analyzed to determine if NISE is usable as a computer model validation tool. Finally, a possible graphical method for simplifying the calculation of NISE is presented. 810473. Development and Evaluation of the CRASH 2 Program for Use under European Conditions. Ian S. Jones and Peter W. Jennings, Oxford Road Accident Group, Dept. of Engineering Science, Univ. of Oxford. This paper reports recent work undertaken by the Oxford Road Accident Group to improve the utility of the CRASH 2 (Calspan Reconstruction of Occident Speeds on the //ighway) program. Although CRASH 2 is being used extensively in the U.S.A. for accident reconstruction, its use in Europe is limited. The accident environment in 87</page><page sequence="69">810475-810478 Europe is sufficiently different from that in the United States that it has been suggested that the program could be of limited use under these conditions. Accordingly, to provide reliable figures as to the utility of the program under European conditions a representative sample of accidents has been reconstructed using CRASH 2: the sample consisted of 200 accidents investigated on-scene and 200 accidents investigated on a 48 hour follow-up basis. Results are presented which give the proportion of accidents that could be successfully CRASHed together with the reasons for not running CRASH. To improve the reconstruction accuracy of CRASH 2 for European sized vehicles, the stiffness coefficients used in the damage analysis routine have been reassessed for the minicar, subcompact and compact car categories. The data used for the update consisted of 42 frontal impacts performed in the U.K. The new coefficients were derived using a statistical optimization technique to fit the damage equation to the test data. The new coefficients show a significant improvement in the accuracy of individual reconstructions. Provision for vehicles to be yawing at impact has also been added to the program. 1981 SA E Transactions 810475. Static-to-Dynamic Amplification Factors for Use in Lumped-Mass Vehicle Crash Models. Pri- yaranjan Prasad and Arvind J. Padgaonkar, Ford Motor Co. One-dimensional, lumped-mass models for predicting the dynamic response of vehicles in crashes have been used extensively in recent years. The energy-absorbing char- acteristics, i.e., the load/deflection data, for use in the models are determined from static crusher tests of actual vehicle components. In order to account for the crush rate effects on the structure, a transformation is needed to extrapolate the statically obtained data to the dynamic case. The transformation factors - the static-to-dynamic amplification factors - are empirically derived and have been reported by some investigators to be linearly and by others to be logarithmically related to crush rate. This paper reports on the development of dynamic amplifi- cation factors for vehicles with framed structures, e.g., light trucks and S-framed cars, and unibody cars. The factors were developed by exercising lumped-mass models with various forms of dynamic amplification factors and comparing the model results with results from crash tests. The factors that best explained the crash tests are different for different construction vehicles. 810476. Vehicle Crash Simulation Using Hybrid Model. Ichiro Hagiwara, Yasuo Sasakura, Tadashi Nakagawa and Yoshihiro Kajio, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. With the increasing demand for smaller automobiles that will conserve natural resources and save energy, and the need to systematize the development of such vehicles by shortening their developmental period and by reducing the number of required experimental vehicles, the analysis of automotive collisions has become increasingly impor- tant for us. The analysis of automotive collisions was first conducted by a lumped-mass method, although it has some shortcomings, e.g., it is difficult to make models and it is inappropriate for three-dimensional analysis. Con- sequently, a finite element method is also presently in use. From the finite element method currently in use, for the purpose, however, a practical level of analysis duration and deformation analysis cannot be expected. Therefore, we have developed a hybrid program called "FEMASS", which is a combination of the lumped-mass method and the finite element method programs. Some vehicle hybrid models made by this program have been utilized in the analysis of rear-end collisions. The resultant simulations reveal that the acceleration-time characteristics and deformation-time characteristics, as well as the defor- mation modes of the respective parts involved, agree quite well with the test results. 810477. The High Speed Direct Injection Diesel for Passenger Cars. M. L. Monaghan, Ricardo Consulting Engineers Ltd. It is shown that the potential benefit of a direct injection system is a 10% gain in fuel economy compared with that obtained from an indirect injection system. A realistic consideration of the features of various diesel combustion systems shows why the indirect injection approach is universally applied to diesel passenger cars today. A production indirect injection diesel of 1.8/ total capacity was converted to direct injection form and test bed and vehicle performances obtained. The constraints imposed by the need for compatibility with existing engine ranges and the use of low cost, currently available injection equipment caused reductions in smoke limited power although gains in fuel consumption at equivalent engine load were achieved. A viable direct injection passenger car diesel requires more advanced injection equipment and boosting. 810478. Elko's Light Duty D. I. Diesel Engines with Heat Insulated Combustion System and Component Design. L. Elsbett and M. Behrens, Elsbett- Konstruktion (Elko). The heat insulated four stroke light duty d.i. diesel engine for cars was developed at Elko in the last 15 years. The main development aim was to find practical solutions to increase fuel efficiency. Heat insulation means reducing the flow of heat from the combustion air to the engine components. For this purpose a new combustion system, that is to say an air/fuel mixing process, was developed and new engine components were built and tested and the engine's cooling system was adapted to the reduced requirements. For automobile applications it was further postulated that 88</page><page sequence="70">810479-810483 the new generation of engines would have to impress upon i.d.i. diesel engines on following points: a) Torque and Power or rather acceleration, and maximum car speed per swept volume, b) Combustion noise, c) Cold start. The development results, that is to say heat insulated light duty d.i. engines, have so far been tested in about 15 cars and a total of well over 1 million km. Test results show a mileage improvement average of about 30% as compared with i.d.i. diesel engines and a reduction in fuel consumption of 40 to 50% as compared to gasoline engines. The postulated improvements concerning torque, power, combustion noise and cold start were all achieved. 810479. The M. A. N. Combustion System with Con- trolled Direct Injection for Passenger Car Diesel Engines. A. Neitz and N. D'Alfonso, M. A. N. (Nürnberg, Germany). Basing on its well-known "M" combustion system for truck Diesel engines, M.A.N. has developed the Con- trolled Direct Injection (CDI) System to meet the requirements of passenger car Diesels. A variable-area injection nozzle permits mixture preparation in the combustion chamber to be matched to speed and load. This varies the injection pattern with wall deposition of the fuel predominating at high load and speed, whereas air distribution prevails at low load and speed. Apart from the established advantages of direct injection in respect of fuel economy, the system also enables low emission and noise levels to be obtained. 810480. The Passenger Car Direct Injection Diesel - A Performance and Emissions Update. R. Cichocki and W. Cartellieri, AVL-Prof. List Ges. m. b. H. (Austria). The paper presents the current development status of direct injection diesel engines for passenger cars. Besides a description of the essential features of the injection and combustion system, reference is made to the performance and exhaust emissions potential of direct injection diesel engines in the light of legal requirements of both European Community countries and the U.S.A. Com- bustion noise and noise control are also discussed. The conclusion reached is that properly developed direct injection diesels will present a viable alternative to conventional passenger car power plants with the advan- tage of a substantially improved fuel economy. 810481. Sofim Small High-Speed Diesel Engines - D. I. Versus I. D. I. U. G. Carstens and T. Isik, Saurer Engrg. (Arbon/Switzerland); G. Biaggini and G. Cornetti, Fiat Iveco Engrg. (Turin/Italy). A small displacement direct injection diesel engine family is being developed to improve thermal efficiency as compared to the IDI version. 4- and 6-cylinder in-line engines of 2.5 and 3.7 liters displacement, both naturally aspirated and turbocharged are designed. Fuel economy of these direct injection engines is compared with the corresponding indirect injection diesel engine family at the same level of performance. It appears that with direct injection good fuel economy is achieved. However, emission constraints have to be taken into account. For different applications compromises between fuel economy and emissions com- plying with government regulations have to be found. 810482. (P-91) The Economics of Electric Vehicles. Anthony H. Ewing, Electric &amp; Hybrid Vehicles Div., U.S. Department of Energy, Washington, DC. Since 1975, prior to passage of Public Law 94-413, "The Electric &amp; Hybrid Vehicle Research, Development &amp; Demonstration Act", electric vehicle performance has improved dramatically. The top speeds of current pro- duction models are now in excess of 65 mph and ranges are between 30-60 miles per charge. The feasibility of current state-of-the-art technology for fleet missions within the performance characteristics of current tech- nology has been demonstrated in the private and public sectors. Private passenger acceptance of EVs is being established through the market demonstration program and is reflected in projected market demand figures for the 1990's. Clearly, the major barrier to expanding the market for electric vehicles is the purchase cost. Current market demand is sufficient to support conversion processes, but not straight line manufacturing processes. In order to support increased production levels and more economical manufacturing processes required to drive down selling prices, the industry must attract risk capital. In order to accomplish that task, the industry must be able to show an increasing market for electric vehicles. Thus far, the market demonstration has supplied the stimulus for increased market demand and must continue to do so in order to ensure the ability of the U.S. automotive industry to produce an electric vehicle to compete successfully with petroleum-dependent vehicles. 810483. (P-91) The Impact of Technology Development in Economics of Electric Vehicles in Fleet Operations. Clifford L. Hayden, GTE Service Corp., Stamford, CT. The electric vehicle in the past several years has developed into a basically reliable alternative to petroleum-depen- dent vehicles for certain fleet missions. The use of the electric vehicle thus far has, in fact, stimulated interest in exploring the practicality of the electric vehicle for extended range missions. General Telephone &amp; Elec- tronics has assessed the potential technological and economic advantage of Gulf -I- Western Industries, Inc. zinc-chloride battery and, based on recent tests of our vehicle and modification to mechanical design of the battery to suit vehicles being used by GTE fleet operators, will introduce three 750 pick-up trucks equipped with the 89</page><page sequence="71">810484-810491 zinc-chloride battery into its Pomona, California fleet during this year. This paper addresses modifications made to the battery design, test results, projected performance and potential economic impact. 810484. (P-91) Operating Experience of Electric Vehicles in City Government Fleet Operations. G. McDaniel, City of Greenville, SC. Based on limited data and current costs for constant dollar projections for five years, the City of Greenville, South Carolina, has found that the projected total average cost per mile for its electric vehicles in fleet operation will be approximately 128% more than for similar usage ICE vehicles for 23.6 miles average daily usage. The critical factor in the actual and projected total average cost per mile is battery life cycle cost per mile. Operating experience to date is favorable; however, the key to the increased usage of EVs is a breakthrough in battery technology resulting in improved cost benefits. 810485. (P-91) EV Technology and Fleet Experience. Walter J. Dippold, Electric &amp; Hybrid Vehicles Div., U.S. Department of Energy, Washington, DC. This paper delineates the interrelationships of technical improvements in components, electric vehicle perform- ance, energy use per mile travelled and cost in dollars per pound of hardware spread over the 4-year history of Public Law 94-413, the Electric and Hybrid Vehicle Research, Development and Demonstration Act of 1976. It then presents several problem areas in battery module interconnections, transmission short falls and regenerative braking system limitations with proposed directions for technical progress to alleviate problem areas. The level of presentation is intended to be understandable by and useful to the vehicle owner and user. Discussion of problem areas and suggestions for improvement hopefully will be a stimulus for manufacturers and vendors of components to synthesize solutions. 810487. (P-91) Electric Vans in Regular Commercial Service - A Manufacturer's Viewpoint. Donald A. Ziemer, GMC Truck &amp; Coach Div., General Motors Corp. The paper will contain a brief background of the battery vehicle development, test and prototype fabrication which led up to the field demonstration. The field operation both in Culver City and Detroit will be described. The status of each site and a summary of data derived will be presented along with comments, conclusions and considerations for the future. 810488. (P-91) Creating the Traffic-Compatible Electric Vehicle Industry in the UK - The Chloride Ap- proach. Brian D. Edwards, Chloride Technical Ltd. (Swinton, Manchester, England). To achieve commercial success, the battery vehicle must meet the operators' performance requirements in full and must do so at a total cost of lifetime ownership which is competitive with the equivalent gasoline or diesel-powered vehicle. A demonstration programme involving 71 electric vans and buses, known as Dodge Silent Karriers, is now well established and some results are presented. Following the satisfactory performance in service and the favourable operator reaction to these vehicles, an improved vehicle, the Dodge '50 Series,' is to go into production in October 1981 at a rate of up to 20 per month. A whole life ownership cost comparison with the diesel vehicle shows that at present Government support is needed equivalent to about 14% of the total lifetime cost in order to achieve parity. The subsidy requirement is expected to reduce to zero by 1987. 810489. (P-91) Field Test Experience With Electric Vehicles. Eckhard O. Dietrich, VARTA Batterie AG (Hagen/West Germany). Two major tests with Electric Road Vehicles were started in West Germany in 1974, and these tests are continuing. The tests include 130 Vans for local goods transport, and 20 Buses for local public passenger transport. The experiences of the 7 years field tests will be reported, with special information being given regarding the technology of the vehicles used, the applications, data concerning use, regarding the operating data experienced, such as energy consumption, efficiency ratio, lifespan and temperature behaviour of batteries, availability and maintenance of vehicles and finally costs and economy. 810491. Comparison of Vehicle/Fuel Test Procedures with Customer Driving. David S. Klen, Amoco Oil Co., Amoco Research Center, Naperville, IL. An instrumented "chase" car was used to observe and record driving patterns for over 3,000 motorists in three different regions. How these motorists actually drove their cars was then compared to three standardized driving procedures used to evaluate fuels: the EPA's city and highway driving schedules used for emissions and fuel economy testing, the CRC E- 15 Technique for Deter- mination of Octane Number Requirements of Light-Duty Vehicles, and the CRC Cold Start and Driveaway Test Procedure used in fuel volatility work to evaluate vehicle driveability. All of these driving procedures were found to differ from the way motorists actually drove their cars. Accelerations are generally less rapid in the EPA cycles, and engine loading is lower than it is on the road in both the acceleration and cruise modes. Accelerations in the CRC E- 15 technique were not consistent with the way motorists actually accelerate and the magnitude of the accelerations depended on the car being rated. In the CRC driveability cycle, some of the maneuvers were difficult to follow, resulting in poor repeatability of the accelerations. 90</page><page sequence="72">810492-810497 810492. Developing Road Octane Correlations from Oc- tane Requirement Surveys. J. C. Ingamells and E. R. Jones, Chevron Research Company, Richmond, California. We are often interested in predicting octane performance in cars as a function of Research and Motor octane numbers. Prediction equation parameters can be devel- oped by regressing data taken directly from Coordinating Research Council reports on annual car octane require- ment surveys. However, there is a major problem with these data. They are pooled in such a way that data points for different fuel series do not correspond to the same cars in each case. This paper presents a better method that makes use of individual car data and also fuel data. 810493. Predicting Customer Octane Satisfaction. E. R. Jones and J. C. Ingamells, Chevron Research Company, Richmond, California. In setting gasoline octane specifications, it is important to be able to predict the percentage of customers that object to spark knock (ping) at a given octane level. Direct information about octane satisfaction for trained raters, but not for customers, is available from annual surveys conducted by the Coordinating Research Council (CRC). This paper describes a simple mechanistic model for relating customer octane requirements (OR's) with trained rater OR's. Two large CRC studies involving both customers and raters support its use. 810494. Transient A/F Control Characteristics of the 5 Liter Central Fuel Injection Engine. C. F. Aquino, Engineering and Research Staff, Re- search, Ford Motor Co., Dearborn, MI. Experiments have been conducted to determine the nature and causes of A/F transients during changes in throttle angle on a 5 Liter central fuel injected dynamometer engine. Tests consisted of a series of one-second throttle ramps of various magnitudes at constant engine speed. Fuel metering calculation was adjusted to give error free metering, so that observed A/F transients were due to induction system characteristics such as manifold wall wetting, air charging, and injector phasing. The effects of throttle body and manifold temperature were investigated and a comparison of speed-density and mass-flow meter- ing strategies was made. A simple continuous flow model was developed to predict the effects of manifold air charging and wall wetting. Comparisons of model predictions and exper- imental results show the agreement for air flow to be within ± 4%. Wall wetting is described by a linear, first-order equation with two parameters; a boiling time constant, and a percent impaction parameter. Agreement between model prediction and experiment is good if the percent impaction parameter is allowed to vary linearly with throttle angle. 1981 SA E Transactions 810495. Transient Mixture Strength Excursions - An In- vestigation of Their Causes and the Development of a Constant Mixture Strength Fueling Strategy. S. D. Hires, Advanced Engines Engineering, Ford Motor Co.; and M. T. Overington, Ricardo Consulting Engineers, Ltd. This study investigates the causes for tailpipe mixture strength excursions during transient operation of an electronically controlled, central fuel injected engine. The investigation was made using a Ford 5. OL V8 engine instrumented to enable continuous monitoring of the tailpipe air-fuel ratio. Transient excursions of up to 20% are observed under warm engine conditions. Two causes of the excursions were identified: system time delays and fuel droplet deposition on induction system surfaces. A programmable control strategy was developed to compensate for observed lean excursions during accel- erations. This was done by modifying the injector signal to provide the necessary fuel enrichment. Transient re- quirements were optimized across a range of engine operations. The results have been summarized in two sets of curves - one defining the enrichment fuel volume and the other specifying the form of enrichment fuel supply. Lower induction system thermal conditions associated with cold start necessitated modification of these curves. The results of these studies can be identically applied to decelerations. The strategy developed here is suitable for any "wet manifold" engine. 1981 SA E Transactions 810496. Study of Induction Swirl in a Spark Ignition Engine. Tadayoshi Hirotomi, Isao Nagayama and Shoji Kobayashi, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. (Japan); and Masanobu Yamamasu, Kanto- Gakuin Univ. (Yokohama, Japan). The induction swirl in a spark ignition engine was studied. An effective model test using water was devised which allowed observation of the induction swirl in the cylinder. First, steady flow without a piston was observed, and it was discovered that two vortexes were generated in the cylinder. Next, the flow patterns of several cylinder heads with intake ports of various shapes were observed and their relation to combustion was investigated. From the results, it was discovered that high speed and well mixed vortexes aided combustion. Experimentation with unsteady flow with a piston was also conducted. 1981 SA E Transactions 810497. Transportation of Liquid Fuel Droplets in the Pulsative Air Flow Within the S.I. Engine Intake Manifold. S. C. Low, P. C. Baruah and D. E. Winterbone, Univ. of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology (Manchester/England). An extensive amount of research has been carried out by various authors on the entrainment of fuel droplets in a 91</page><page sequence="73">810498-810502 steady air flow, in order to understand the transportation of droplet fuel in the spark-ignition engine intake manifold system. However, the utility of this type of steady state model is very limited when applied to the real engine where the air flow is highly pulsative. The present work develops a theoretical model of the flow of fuel droplets entrained in a non-steady air flow which requires the solution of a set of unsteady one-dimensional two phase flow equations by a numerical technique. This model is then applied to a single-cylinder spark-ignition engine fitted with both intake and exhaust manifold systems and also a carburettor. 810498. A Generalized Computer Aided Design Package for I.C. Engine Manifold System. S. C. Low and P. C. Baruah, Univ. of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology (Manchester/England). A numerical scheme for a Computer Aided Design (CAD) package for the design and development of internal combustion engine intake and exhaust manifold is presented. The program is interactive and uses the graphical and visual display unit (VDU) facilities exten- sively. The basic concept of such a program was described in a previous SAE paper (Paper No. 790277) by one of the authors (SCL). The present program is written to handle a maximum of 10 cylinders and any imaginable configu- ration of intake and exhaust manifold. The input data, the preparation of which is usually a time-consuming process, are kept at a possible minimum with automatic generation of data from arbitrary drawings drawn manually on the VDU screen. The program is applied to a commercial 4 cylinder - 4 stroke spark ignition engine. 1981 SAE Transactions 810499. Soots from Used Diesel Engine Oils - Their Effects on Wear as Measured in 4-Ball Wear Tests. Fred G. Rounds, Fuels and Lubricants Dept., General Motors Research Laboratories, Warren, MI. Diesel engine oil soots from different engines have the appearance of carbon black but contain significant concentrations of engine oil additive elements. Evaluation of the soots in 4-ball wear tests supported the theory that the soots reduce the antiwear additive effectiveness by preferentially adsorbing the active antiwear additive components before they can form the essential antiwear surface coating rather than removing the surface coatings by abrasion after they are formed. Engine load and exhaust gas recirculation have large effects on the soot prowear characteristics, whereas engine refinements, engine make and oil type have lesser effects. No antiwear additives were found more effective than the currently used zinc dialkyldithiophosphates. Several preferential adsorber additives were effective in simple blends but not in fully formulated engine oils. 810500. IDI Lubrication and Wear. G. H. Youdan and M. H. Wharton, Perkins Engines Co. The paper discusses the design and development of indirect injection diesel engines with particular reference to their production of combustion soot and to the crankcase lubricating oils ability to handle it. Bench and field test results obtained from Perkins 4.108 engines are presented on the performance of bearings, camshaft/tap- pets and lubricants. These results show that no wear problem exists, that the dispersancy of lubricants can be effectively assessed and that there is a potential for an improvement in oil drain periods by the use of synthetic oils. Results also show that for one lubricant unacceptable bearing corrosion was obtained. This was disturbing since the lubricant was qualified to both MIL-L-46152 and 2104C performance levels. 810501. Influence of Oil Balls on Premature Overlay Removal of Diesel Engine Connecting Rod Bear- ings. Magan J. Patel, Cummins Engine Co., Inc. The influence of oil balls on the premature overlay removal of diesel engines connecting rod bearings is discussed. Oil balls are discrete spherical particles which embed in the bearing overlay. The elemental composition of oil balls include calcium, phosphorus (2.1 ratio), zinc and barium; elements which are also present in oil additives. Diesel engine manufacturers have observed a high incidence of premature overlay removal in upper connecting rod bearings. An in-depth metallurgical analysis of field returned connecting rod bearings and laboratory engine tested connecting rod bearings indi- cated that bearing overlay was removed prematurely due to fatigue aggravated by corrosion. The oil balls, embed- ded in the bearing overlay, are considered one of the contributing factors in premature overlay removal, al- though their exact formation and embedment mechanisms are not understood. 810502. Rolling Piston Type Compressor for Automotive Air Conditioner. Toshihide Koda, Kotaro Yoshida and Yoshiaki Hoshino, Mitsubishi Electric Corp., Shizuoka Plant (Shizuoka shi Shizuoka/Japan); and Masahiro Sugihara, Mit- subishi Electric Corp., Central Research Lab (Amagasaki shi Hyogo/Japan). The paper deals with the construction and performance of a newly developed rolling piston type compressor for automotive air conditioning systems. Both experimental results and some considerations. The automotive compressor is one of the most important elements in an automotive air conditioner and requires the following characteristics... (1) Low power consumption at high speed driving. (2) High cooling efficiency especially at low speed driving or idling. (3) Compact size and lightweight mechanism. 92</page><page sequence="74">810503-810511 (4) Quiet operation (low level noise and vibration). (5) High reliability. (6) Lower cost. A rolling piston type compressor has been developed in compliance with the above requirements. It is found that this rolling piston type compressor is very suitable for application to an automotive air conditioning system. 810503. Study of the Arrangement of Automobile Air- Conditioning Condenser and Engine Radiator in the Cooling Air Circuit. J. P. Chiou, Univ. of Detroit. Side-by-side arrangement of condenser and radiator in the cooling air circuit of automobile requires smaller ex- changer core volume and less fan air horsepower than those required in the back-to-back arrangement for the same thermal performance requirements under the same operating conditions. Side-by-side arrangement also con- tributes significantly to the improvement of overall system efficiency and fuel economy. A set of criteria in terms of Relative Radiator Core Volume and Relative Radiator Fan Air Power Requirement is developed. It can be used for selecting appropriate arrangements of condenser and radiator and for determining their optimum operating parameters. 810504. The Use of Waste Heat for Automotive Air Conditioning. Richard M. Hammer, Chemical Systems Div., United Technologies. The ejector-compression refrigeration system, a heat powered system which can be operated as a heat pump, is described. The operation of the system is discussed in general and the ejector itself is described in more detail. The central thrust of the paper is the application of the system of comfort air conditioning of automobiles. The advantages, limitations, and recommendations for future research and development are given. Several analyses of the theoretical cycle are made and equations describing the operation of the ejector are derived. A brief bibliography is listed. 810505. Preliminary Development of a High Efficiency Low Vapor Pressure Non-Fluorocarbon Air Con- ditioning Compressor. Thomas Edwards, Wil- liam Clark and Robert J. Cavalieri, The ROV AC Corp. The development status of a compact large displacement non-fluorocarbon high efficiency compressor is reported. The compressor developed is a positive displacement, rotary constrained vane machine. Compressor perform- ance results using two different refrigerants are reported. One refrigerant was a hydrocarbon whereas the other was a fluorocarbon. Data was obtained using a water calo- rimeter test stand. Test results demonstrated COP's in the range of 3.5 to 4.5 with both the non-fluorocarbon and fluorocarbon refrigerants in air conditioning test condi- tions. Maximum overall compressor efficiencies of slightly over 80% were obtained. 810506. Refrigerant 12 Leakage in Automobile Air Con- ditioner Systems. Thomas Lemmons and Ronald L. Bradow, Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, NC. The paper presents measurements of whole vehicle refrigerant 12 leakage from a varied fleet of U.S. manufactured passenger automobiles in addition to measurements of some individual leak sources within the operating vehicles. Evaluation of Halogen leak detectors and of an R-12 refrigerant, Dytel, are also made with a view of determining their sensitivity or adequacy in detecting refrigerant leaks in operating automotive air conditioning systems. Recommendations regarding de- sirability of improvements in service, maintenance and system design to reduce R-12 emission levels are also presented. 1981 SAE Transactions 810509. Unraveling the Myths of the Fastener World. G. S. Haviland, Loctite Corp. Ten commonly found statements and beliefs regarding threaded fasteners are examined against appropriate data. They are all false and misleading. The author presents them in an order and manner which should lead to an understanding of what makes bolted joints work or fail. From "vibration" loosening to "lock" washers the facts associated with the fables are presented as assisting in the achievement of fastener objectives: 1) Development of predictable clamp load 2) Prevention of self loosening 3) Maintenance of the ability to disassemble the joint by avoiding corrosion and galling. 810510. Impregnation of Porous Metal Components with Anaerobic Sealants. Thomas S. Fulda, Loctite Corp., Systems Div., Newington, CT. Theoretical aspects of impregnation sealing are reviewed to give a basis for practical discussion. A brief history of the evolution of impregnation techniques is offered. Specific applications covered are impregnation of both die cast and powder metal components for pressure and fluid retention, plating and other surface finishes, and increased machinability. Actual case histories are cited. Processing techniques as related to components on a production basis are discussed and guidelines established. Equipment developments and process refinements are explored. 810511. Computerized Tire Footprint Area Measure- ments. C. E. Prettyman, The Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. A computerized system to automatically measure tire footprint areas has been constructed and used to study the 93</page><page sequence="75">810513-810515 variations in the tire footprint area characteristics as a function of various tire parameters. The individual system components including the optical vidicon, TV monitor, TV control and digitizer, computer, data storage device, printer and plotter are described and their function in the system explained. A flow-chart of the systems computer program shows the methods used to control the test, to collect and store the digitized visual data, to calculate tire footprint length, width, total footprint area, contact area and void area and to report the results. A description of the procedure used to calibrate the system and the various test procedures used to directly or indirectly measure the tire footprint areas are given. Comparisons including test time, test accuracy and test repeatability are made between this system and the traditional methods of measuring tire footprint areas. The results presented in this paper include variations in footprint areas for a radial tire as a function of inflation pressure, tire load, and tire rotation. An explanation of the tire parameters which cause these variations are given. 810513. Contribution to the Simulation of Driver-Vehi- cle-Road System. R. N. Reddy, Central Me- chanical Engineering Research Institute (India); and J. R. Ellis, School of Automotive Studies, Cranfield Institute of Technology (England). In this study a mathematical model for Driver/ Vehi- cle/Road system has been developed incorporating steer advance and a differential form of looking ahead concept. A four degrees of freedom mathematical model is used to simulate the vehicle. The model developed to simulate the road geometry is in a generalized form and can be used to represent any kind of maneuver. Drivers' basic characteristics, information processing, decision making and control response aspects are dis- cussed. An experiment was conducted to obtain information about the information process and control response made by drivers. Individual differences between subjects are examined and discussed. The performance of the mathematical model of Driver/Vehicle/Road system has been compared with that of the subjects and shown to produce comparable results. The model developed can effectively be used for studying the vehicle handling characteristics in closed- loop systems. 1981 SA E Transactions 810514. Fuel Economy Potential of Diesel and Spark Ignition-Powered Vehicles in the 1980s. Thomas J. Trella, Dept. of Transportation. The fuel economy potential of diesel and spark ignition engines is surveyed, recognizing that these engines will be the primary power sources for the passenger car and light truck fleets during the 1980s. These surveys treat 1979 production engines, and emphasis is given to state- of-the-art technologies; engine control strategies and special combustion system configurations are given special emphasis. Summaries are presented in terms of miles per gallon for engines installed in typical vehicles. The findings presented are an attempt to quantify fuel economy improvements that could be accomplished; they are not intended to predict any actual plans. 810515. A New Generation of Powershift Transmissions for Machines in the Construction Industry. Alfred Schobinger, Zahnradfabrik Friedrichshafen AG. Modern construction machinery requires high quality and high reliability transmissions. There is a demand for extended life time and low noise level at full power shifts in all speeds and at reversing in 1st and 2nd speed. Economy - maintaining a wide range of application - will be a determining factor. A transmission design has been chosen which offers 3-, 4-, and 6-speed versions with alternate ratios. Only few parts are to be exchanged. One of the features is the cost-minimizing one-piece housing with spindles. The control system has to guarantee the transmission of the power by the clutch packages and has to provide soft shift in all speeds. The praxis shows that today 70% of the control systems are electro-hydraulically operated. A safety coding ensures best operating comfort and highest safety. Remote control, semi-automatic control and twin control stands can easily be realized. Features like start-up lock, reversing lock, pressure cut-off or converter lock-up are quite common. Hydrodynamic torque converters are a standard element in transmissions for construction machinery. Torque multiplication and automatic adaptation to working conditions provide for easy machine operation in rough terrain. Naturally, the torque converters equalize forced oscillations and protect for overload. The drive train efficiency can be increased by additional installation of stator freewheel and brake freewheel. In certain applications the torque converter may be replaced by pressure-oil lubricated and cooled multi-disc clutches. Wet clutch resp. modulating clutch. Another important element incorporated in the drive line is the wearfree, hydraulically operated retarder with its low idling loss. The new transmission range offers up to three P.T.O. drives. Each permits full engine power take-off. One P.T.O. optional converter or reversing transmission connected. Due to an extensive transmission component program, the various drive train requirements for construction machinery can be met. The application of this transmission range also includes crawler tractors, loaders, high-speed dumpers, or RT cranes. 94</page><page sequence="76">810516-810525 810516. Rotary Fuel Injection Pump Developments for High Speed Diesel Engines. A. J. Adey, F. Cunliffe and J. E. Mardell, Lucas CAV Ltd. The paper describes the new features being introduced to the Lucas CAV rotary fuel injection pump product range to meet current market demands. The introduction of an external means of setting the maximum fuel on the traditional rotary pump forms the basis of the new design described in the paper, which also gives the options of excess fuel, boost and torque control. Demands from the diesel engine designer will continue to advance with the advent of increasingly severe emissions legislation. The paper describes future developments to optimize fuel metering and injection timing controls by employing microprocessors to control a rotary distributor pump electronically. 1981 SAE Transactions 810517. Carburizing Steels Shortening Process Time. Tetsuo Kato, Norioki Uyehara, Kenji Isokawa and Yoshiharu Tanaka, Daido Steel Co., Ltd., R &amp; D Div.; and Shigeo Kimura, Teruo Ogiwara and Katsubumi Itoh, Nissan Motors Co., Ltd. Carburizing process is one of the heat treatments which consumes energy in large quantities. Authors started the program to develop new carburizing steels which would be able to shorten the process time by 10 to 20% compared with conventional steels. To obtain the data for alloy design, the effect of alloying elements was investigated thoroughly on the case depth of carburized steels. Then authors learned that C and Mo are most effective to gain the case depth and designed new carburizing steels, ESI and ES2, where contents of 2 elements were optimized. ESI has machinability, core-hardenability and tensile/ fatigue strength equivalent to SAE 5120 (Cr Steel). And ES2 are to substitute for JIS SCM 420 ( Cr - Mo steel ). ESI passed the application experiments as steering components of a passenger car. 1981 SAE Transactions 810518. Heavy Trucks and Fatal Crashes: An Unresolved Dilemma. Livia K. Li and Patricia F. Waller, Univ. of North Carolina, Highway Safety Re- search Center. Heavy Trucks (HT) are an integral part of the trans- portation system of the eighties. However, analyses of HT crashes from FARS, BMCS and North Carolina crash files indicate that HT pose great danger for occupants of vehicles with which they collide. Furthermore, during the past few years, fatal crash involvement rates of HT have been dramatically increasing and in 1978, the rate was twice that of passenger cars. To account for the safety hazards associated with HT, three hypotheses have been suggested. Changes in HT design and in qualifying HT drivers are recommended to improve HT safety. 810519. Experimental Research on Moped Engine Op- timization. Marco Nuti, Research and Devel- opment PIAGGIO Group (Pontedera/Italy). After some general considerations about energy utilization by different types of vehicles when used in urban areas, the possibility of improving moped performances by means of simple carburation and engine modifications is evaluated. Positive results are achieved in this research and they show that decidedly the moped is in first place as regards energy economy in urban areas transport. This implies that, in a short time, there will be available a class of vehicles which, besides offering energy utilization coef- ficients a little lower than those of public transport vehicles, will be characterized by the advantages of individual transport and, moreover, will contribute to reduce traffic congestion in urban areas. 810522. On Optimal Longevity of Commercial Vehicles. F. H. Zalud, Automobile Research Institute, Prague. The effect of changing economic conditions on quality requirements of commercial vehicles is discussed. Special attention is given to reliability and longevity aspects. To facilitate the evaluation of changes of reliability on total life costs of automobiles, a mathematical model was developed, which contains also separate variables defining the energy and material content in the life cost structure. The concept of optimal longevity is analyzed and factors influencing it are considered. It is shown that improve- ments in automobile reliability can lead to considerable savings of energy and material. 810523. Design, Fabrication and Testing of an Exper- imental Alpha Silicon Carbide Turbocharger Rotor. Paul Rottenkolber and Manfred Langer, Volks wagenwerk AG; Roger S. Storm and Frank Frechette, The Carborundum Co. A turbine wheel has been designed to investigate the application of ceramic materials to automotive turbo- chargers. Stress calculations for the ceramic rotor have been carried out. Sintered Alpha Silicon Carbide wheels have been fabricated by injection molding and prelim- inary testing has been completed. 1981 SAE Transactions 810525. Electrolytic Liquid Display. Daniel Jauset, JAE- GER, Levallois (France). The electrolytic display is a new passive particularly designed for automotive applications. It looks like liquid crystal display but operates on a completely different way by electrolysis phenomenon. A small current at low voltage produces the transfer of silver from a back glass where silver is not visible to the front glass where the thin layer of silver obtained gives a black surface. This type of display fulfills almost all the requirements 95</page><page sequence="77">810560-810565 of automotive uses such as temperature operating range, viewing angle, shocks and vibrations. Their manufacture operations are cheaper than those for liquid crystal and must finally give a lower manu- facturing cost. At last one particularity is its memory effect which may be in some cases an advantage. 1 981 SA E Transactions 810560. Strategies for Aircraft Interior Noise Reduction in Existing and Future Propeller Aircraft. Fred- erick B. Metzger, Hamilton Standard. Airline deregulation and the high cost of fuel have caused a renewed interest in propeller-driven aircraft as a replacement for existing turbofan aircraft. Since passen- gers on existing turbofan aircraft have become accus- tomed to lower interior noise than exists in current propeller aircraft, there has been a renewed interest in interior noise control by reduction of propeller source noise, by design of lightweight fuselage soundproofing and other noise reduction concepts. This paper discusses the noise control problem from a source noise and aircraft design standpoint. The existing state-of-the-art is reviewed and the promising strategies for reducing noise in propeller aircraft are discussed. 810561. Noise Transmission and Attenuation for Business Aircraft. Rimas Vaicaitis and M. T. Chang, Columbia Univ.; and Marian Slazak, Bell Tel- ephone Co. This paper describes analytical studies applicable for estimating the effects of noise transmission into light aircraft and commuter type aircraft. The propeller noise and turbulent boundary layer noise are considered. The analytical model described uses modal methods and incorporates flat stiffened panels for flat sided sidewalk and curved stiffened panels for cylindrical enclosures. The numerical results include noise attenuation with add-on treatments and the sensitivity of the transmitted noise to the discrete stiffening of the sidewall panels. 810562. Summary of Typical Parameters that Affect Sound Transmission through General Aviation Aircraft Structures. F. Grosveld, R. Navanee- than and J. Roskam, Flight Research Labora- tory, Univ. of Kansas, Lawrence, KS. This paper presents results of a systematic experimental investigation of parameters which affect sound transmis- sion through general aviation structures. Parameters studied include angle of sound incidence, panel curvature, panel stresses, and edge conditions for bare panels; pane thickness, spacing, inclination of window panes, and depressurization for dual pane windows; densities of hard foam and sound absorption materials, air gaps, and trim panel thickness for multilayered panels. Based on the study, some promising methods for reducing interior noise in general aviation airplanes are discussed. 1981 SA E Transactions 810564. Studies of Hingeline Gap, Trailing Edge Treat- ment, Lower Surface Deflector on Spoiler Char- acteristics and Flow. W. H. Wentz, Jr. and C. Ostowari, Wichita State University; and M. D. Mack, Boeing Commercial Airplane Co. Wind tunnel tests have been conducted to determine effects of certain design variables on spoiler performance and spoiler flow field characteristics. Measurements include forces, oil flow surveys on a vertical splitter plate, and wake velocity and turbulence measurements using a dual split-film anemometer system. Results include the effects of spoiler design variables, such as: hingeline gap, lower surface venting and deflector, spoiler trailing edge notching and spoiler porosity. Hingeline gap, porosity, lower surface venting and lower surface deflector can be designed to reduce control dead-band tendency. Wake turbulence studies show that certain modifications can be utilized to diminish peak frequencies in the wake. 1981 SA E Transactions 810565. Transonic Wing Design Using Potential-Flow Codes - Successes and Failures. Raymond M. Hicks, Ames Research Center, NASA, Moffett Field, CA. An overview of the state-of-the-art of transonic wind design by use of computer codes based on potential-flow theory is presented. Several recent experiment-theory correlations have been cited to give the reader an indication of the capabilities and limitations of these codes. The examples include correlations of experimental pressure distributions with theoretical results from iso- lated wing and wing-body codes. Computer codes using both conservative and nonconservative differencing schemes are used in this study and the effects of boundary-layer corrections are considered. The results show that calculations from a full potential, isolated wind code correlate well with data from an isolated wing test but may give poor predictions of the aerodynamic characteristics of some wing-body configurations. The potential-flow, wing-body codes used in this study gave better estimates of wing-body aerodynamic characteristics than isolated wing codes in some cases while in other wing-body cases, results given by the isolated wing code agreed better with experiment than those given by the wing-body codes. Boundary-layer corrections were found to have only moderate effects on experiment-theory correlations. The effect of aeroelastic distortions under load were found to have a greater effect on experiment- theory correlation than viscous correlations for an isolated wing test. A wing-body code was used to calculate the flow field about a wing-body configuration with body- mounted engines, which is typical of the transonic "Biz-Jet" class of aircraft. 1981 SAE Transactions 96</page><page sequence="78">810566-810572 810566. Integration of Propeller Slipstreams into the Aerodynamic Analyses of Bodies. Stan R. Fox and Frederick O. Smetana, Dept. of Mechanical and Aerospace Engrg., North Carolina State Univ. The NCSU body flow computer program was modified to include the axial velocity component of propeller wakes. The energetic wake is represented by a series of ring vortices spaced along the body axis whose strengths are related to the engine power output and whose diameters are always larger than the maximum local body dimen- sion. Agreeing at least qualitatively with limited full-scale wind tunnel data, the results indicated that aircraft drag increases linearly with power level for a given config- uration. 810567. Free Flight Research at Lockheed-Georgia. Michael W. M. Jenkins, Lockheed-Georgia Company, Marietta, Georgia. For several years a jet-powered Caproni A21 sailplane has been used, in conjunction with several remotely controlled research vehicles, for research into advanced technologies. These vehicles have been used to explore such areas as laminar flow control, spanwise blowing, parameter iden- tification methods, fiber optics, airframe noise and command augmentation techniques. The manned Caproni A21J, operated at Mississippi State University, is fully instrumented and is capable of recording up to 32 channels of data. The 0.3-scale, RCRV version of the Caproni is operated at Lockheed-Georgia in conjunction with other RCRV's. This vehicle, which telemeters up to 24 channels of data, is flown by one operator. 810568. The Forthcoming FAA Wire TSO. R. P. Fialco- witz, A. E. Petsche Co., Inc. In the past, electrical wire specifications used for pro- curement in the aircraft industry, have either been military documents, or company specifications based on the military format. These typically define the "material" used in a particular wire design. The forthcoming Federal Aviation Administration's Wire Technical Standard Order (TSO), on the other hand, will be "performance" oriented. This necessarily deviates from industry's past experience. The rationale and advantages of the new requirements are discussed. 810569. Aircraft Multi-Bus Electrical System Using a Hall-Effect Sensing Device. I. W. Moody, Beech Aircraft Corp. The multi-bus electrical system, using a Hall-effect sensing device, is designed to meet FAR requirements. The system allows the automatic separation of a faulted bus through the use of the Hall-effect device. Should the loss of both generators occur, the battery will automat- ically become isolated from the loads associated with the generators as well as automatic isolation of the electric heat and the air conditioning motor. The battery is capable of supplying essential power for at least 30 minutes on the battery (if a 34- AH NiCad is used) in night, IFR, icing conditions. The system can be pre-flight tested from the cockpit and this capability can be used by field service for problem solving in the field. 810570. Multiplexing in General Aviation Aircraft. Rich- ard G. Buscher, Cessna Aircraft Co., Wallace Div., Wichita, KS. Multiplexing Techniques for signal transmission have been used for many years in the communication industry. Their use in the aviation industry, is best typified by the MIL-STD-1553 type systems used in military aircraft and the ARINC 429 type systems now being applied to some large transports. In the General Aviation area, however, the use of multiplexing has been restricted to inter- communication within a system. An example is the link between a panel mounted radio control head and a remote radio receiver/transmitter where the requested frequency is often transmitted by a serial digital link. This paper's emphasis is on the expansion of multiplexing usage to intersystem transmission of data in a General Aviation Aircraft. 810571. Dielectric Electrostatic Charge Reduction. Rob- ert L. Truax, TCO Manufacturing Corp. Triboelectric charging of aircraft exterior plastic structure is a source of radio interference, especially at the low frequencies used for long range navigation. Stored surface charges may also reach potentials sufficient to result in electrostatic puncture of the dielectric. Additionally electronic components may fail as a result of transients caused by dielectric surface currents or punctures. Resistive, or other conductive exterior surface coatings are subject to erosion, and may be impractical when transparency is required. If improperly bounded, or maintained, such coatings may result in electrical arcing noise through the UHF band. Some alternatives are presented, suitable for wind- shield and radome applications, along with electrostatic charging test data. Also discussed are several test and instrumentation methods, including a new improved ground test method applicable to full scale aircraft. 810572. Evaluation of Multi-Viscosity Oils Designed for Aircraft Reciprocating Engines. Weldon E. Gar- relts, Univ. of Illinois, Institute of Aviation, Savoy, IL. Six, one hudnred eighty brake horsepower aircraft reciprocating piston engines have been operated for one year using three different multi-viscosity oils. Two of the oils were semi-synthetic blends and the third was an ashless dispersant. These three oils were compared with six (6) identical aircraft using a single grade aviation oil. Preliminary results have indicated that the engines 97</page><page sequence="79">810573-810580 utilizing multiviscosity oils exhibited improved cold- weather starting characteristics, averaged lower oil con- sumption, and displayed similar wear rates when com- pared to the six control aircraft using straight-weight oil. 1981 SAE Transactions 810573. The New Aviation Multiviscosity Oil, SAE 20W-50 for General Aviation. Richard A. Mengelkamp and Kenneth H. Yochum, Phillips Petroleum Co., Bartlesville, OK. For the past two decades, since the introduction of the ashless dispersant aviation oils, the quality of these oils has remained relatively constant. These "single grade" aviation oils, however, required changing as the weather changed whether the usual 50 hours of service has been accumulated or not. In fact, there have been frequent reports of aircraft engines being ruined because heavy SAE 50 (Commercial Grade 100) oils were in the crankcase when they were started and operated in cold weather without engine pre-heat. Present modern aircraft can easily fly from a cold area, with a light SAE 30 (Commercial Grade 65) oil in the crankcase, to a hot area and experience high wear due to boundary lubrication conditions and high oil consumption. With the development of shear stable, heat resistant viscosity index improvers such as butadiene-styrene co-polymers, an excellent new generation SAE 20W-50 general aircraft oil which meets the requirements of Avco-Ly coming Specification 30 IF and Teledyne Con- tinental Specification MHS-24B, is now being used commercially. Over two years of successful field service from the Arctic to the tropics has proved the concept of the multigrade general aviation oil, SAE 20W-50. 810575. Wind-Tunnel Measurements of Wing-Canard Interference and a Comparison with Various Theories. T. W. Feistel, V. R. Corsiglia and D. B. Levin, Large Scale Aerodynamics Branch, Ames Research Center, NASA, Moffett Field, California. Wind-tunnel tests and analyses of the aerodynamics of wind-canard combinations for low-speed applications are described. The experimental data show that the inter- ference between the wing and canard was favorable to the CLmax of the canard and did not degrade the CLmax of the wing, provided the canard was properly located vertically with respect to the wing. Comparison of these meas- urements with calculated results from a vortex-lattice panel code and with the classical Prandtl-Munk theory indicated that the panel code gave excellent results for lift and induced drag at moderate CL. The Prandtl-Munk theory gave conservative results for induced drag. It was found, on the basis of a simple analysis using the Prandtl-Munk theory that the L/D of a typical commuter transport that was canard-configured could be higher than the L/D of a transport with the tail aft, if the canard aspect ratio was greater than the wing aspect ratio. 1981 SAE Transactions 810576. Airfoils for Light Transport Aircraft. R. J. D. Poole, Advanced Design, The De Havilland Aircraft of Canada Ltd; Downsview, Ontario; and P. Teeling, Aerodynamics, The De Havil- land Aircraft of Canada Ltd; Downsview, Ontario. This paper presents data from tests in a two-dimensional pressurized wind tunnel of two new wing sections suitable for light transport aircraft, and a NACA 633-418 airfoil. The two new airfoils had maximum thickness/chord ratios of 18% and 21% and they were designed to achieve improved high lift and low drag by exploiting considerable aft loading and blunt trailing edges. 1981 SAE Transactions 810577. Analytical Studies on the Effects of Cooling Flows on Light Aircraft Drag. Stan R. Fox and Frederick O. Smetana, Dept. of Mechanical and Aerospace Engrg., North Carolina State Univ. A source-paneling body analysis computer program was modified to permit arbitrary panels to be opened to receive or exhaust cooling air flow. It was found that exhausting the cooling air into concave regions such as before the windshield or behind the canopy resulted in decreased drag, probably because of the stream-lining effects of the airflow. This suggests that the drag of single-engine light aircraft could be reduced by redesign- ing the cowl to entrap air below the propeller axis and exhaust the cooling portion of it (but not the engine exhaust) through flush ports in front of the winshield. 810579. Antennas- Avionics Systems Relationship. Rich- ard A. O'Neill, Dorne &amp; Margolin, Inc. Antennas are required for operation of an avionics system. The antennas are designed as a component that will be ultimately used as part of the avionics system, but also as a separate entity - that is - it will become part of the aircraft structure. Factors such as electrical per- formance and mechanical requirements of antennas must be considered from the installation and airframe re- quirements as well as the integration of the antenna with the avionics system. 810580. AFCS Integration Requirements. B. H. Chmaruk and T. R. Lamb, Collins Avionics, Rockwell International. The correct integration of the Automatic Flight Control System (AFCS), into an aircraft will provide the best performance that a system can produce. Improper integration of the AFCS, along with poor installation practices, account for the majority of problems. The Avionics subsystems are becoming increasingly 98</page><page sequence="80">810582-810589 complex, using digital designs, and the components used are much more fragile than in previous avionics. The AFCS integration requirements must include consideration of regulatory requirements, location of the equipment, installation design criteria, human factors, sensor installation tolerances, interfaces with aircraft systems, and customer special requirements. 810582. The State of the Art of General Aviation Auto- pilots: Now and in the Future. Jan Roskam and Michael J. See, The Univ. of Kansas. The paper presents the results of a study performed under contract with NASA-Langley Research Center to doc- ument the state of the art of general aviation (GA) autopilots. The study was conducted to provide NASA- Langley with fundamental, background information about the current status of general aviation autopilot technology. The information presented is based on findings obtained from a general literature search, product literature, visitations and interviews with manufacturers, users, and service centers. Recommendations concerning potential areas of further research are also presented. 1981 SA E Transactions 810584. Impact of Advanced Propeller Technology on Aircraft/Mission Characteristics of Several Gen- eral Aviation Aircraft. Ira D. Keiter, McCauley Accessory Div., Cessna Aircraft Co. Studies of several General Aviation aircraft have indi- cated that the application of advanced technologies to General Aviation propellers can reduce fuel consumption in future aircraft by a significant amount. Propeller blade weight reductions achieved through the use of composites, propeller efficiency and noise improvements achieved through the use of advanced concepts and improved propeller analytical design methods result in aircraft with lower operating cost, acquisition cost and gross weight. 810585. General Aviation Propeller Noise Reduction - Penalties and Potential. Robert J. Klatte, Hamilton Standard Div., United Technologies. Results of a study are reported in which the influence of noise reduction on weight and cost of propellers used in General Aviation aircraft was evaluated. Aircraft per- formance was not to be degraded by installation of the reduced noise propellers. Only propeller modifications were permitted. Engine modifications, such as introduc- tion of a gearbox to reduce noise by reduction of RPM, were not permitted in the study. Major factors in noise reduction found promising in the study were (1) opti- mization of performance by use of the best available airfoils, (2) use of thin airfoils and a narrow elliptical tip blade planform, and (3) increasing the number of blades consistent with maintaining aircraft performance. For the three aircraft studied (a single engine, a light twin and a heavy twin) the flyover noise reduction potential varied from 3 to 8 dBA with no weight and/or cost penalties. Also, in some cases, engine noise would have to be reduced to achieve greater reductions. The progress by General Aviation aircraft manufacturers in reducing noise is indicated by the finding that the most, recent aircraft design had the smallest noise reduction potential. 810586. Noise and Performance of General Aviation Aircraft: A Review of the MIT Study. G. P. Succi, Bolt, Beranek, and Newman, Inc. The primary objective of the study was to explore the possibility of reducing noise from a general-aviation-type propeller without altering significantly its aerodynamic performance or the engine characteristics. Our study of this possiblity involved aerodynamic and acoustic theory, design, construction, and wind tunnel testing of model propellers, design and manufacture of full-scale propel- lers, and, finally, flight tests. One propeller exhibited an overall measured reduction of 4.8 dBA during a flight test. This reduction was achieved with minimal changes in performance. 810588. The Development of a Flyover Noise Prediction Technique Using Multiple Linear Regression Analysis. Ronald K. Rathgeber, Cessna Aircraft Co. At Cessna Aircraft Company, statistical analyses have been developed to define important trends in flyover noise data. Multiple regression techniques have provided the means to develop flyover noise prediction methods which have resulted in better accuracy than methods used in the past. Regression analyses have been conducted to deter- mine the important relationship between propeller helical tip Mach number and the flyover noise level. Other variables have been included in the regression models either because the added variable contributed to reducing the remaining variation in the model or the variable appeared to be a strong causal agent of flyover noise. 810589. Rotorcraft Researchers and Operators - Is There a Common Ground? Peter D. Talbot and Wil- liam J. Snyder, Rotorcraft Technology Group, Aeronautical Research Branch, Ames Research Center, NASA, Moffett Field, California. Current operating problems experienced by major users of helicopters are reviewed and compared with NASA research plans for rotorcraft technology. The basis for the major concerns of operators was presentations made by users at a conference on advanced rotorcraft technology jointly sponsored by the Helicopter Association of America and NASA in December 1980. The comparisons serve to indicate where user interests and research interests coincide, and what long-term and short-term benefits to operators may be forthcoming from the research programs. Differences that arise from the researchers' objective to understand fundamentals and the 99</page><page sequence="81">810591-810599 users' need for immediate solutions to current problems are discussed. It is concluded that many areas of common interest exist, and that there are some potential "tech- nological bright spots" that promise near-term solutions for user problems; however, in the most basic areas, aeroacoustics, vibration, and rotor dynamics, only long- term benefits can be expected. 810591. Helicopter Noise - Is Technology the Answer? Robert J. King, Hughes Helicopters. Noise will be reduced substantially for upcoming heli- copter generations. User, community, and new regulatory requirements have combined to increase the priority of noise in helicopter design. This presentation summarizes the writer's interpretation of: industry concerns in helicopter noise rulemaking, some of the technical challenges facing the industry in complying with them, the areas over and above regulatory requirements where work is needed to improve helicopter acceptance from a noise point of view, and some recommendations for developing the technology for noise control with acceptable per- formance/economic consequences. 810592. Helicopter Accidents. Bruce J. Webster, Inter- national Air Safety, Ltd. This paper provides a statistical breakdown of U.S.A. helicopter accidents by cause/factor, phase of operation, and, percent of material failure/malfunction, cause/factor accidents by major component or system for the years 1977, 1978, and 1979. A listing of specific recurring malfunctions and their primary causes, plus possible solutions are provided. A listing of important industry requirements to improve the helicopter safety record is included. 810593. Predicting Fatigue Crack Growth on Aircraft Structures. Bert L. Smith, Wichita State Univ., Wichita, KS; and S. Y. Lee, The Boeing Co., Wichita, KS. This paper presents a technical overview of the portion of fracture mechanics that deals with the theory and practice of predicting fatigue crack growth. The use of the stress intensity factor for predicting crack growth in various shaped structural members subjected to cyclic loading is introduced. Fracture toughness, crack growth rate, and crack growth retardation from overloads are also ex- plained. Example problems are presented to enhance the clarity of explanations. 810594. A Computer Program for Predicting Fatigue Crack Propagation. S. Kauser Imtiaz, Beech Aircraft Corp., Wichita, KS; and Bert L. Smith, Dept. of Aeronautical Engineering, Whichita State Univ., Wichita, KS. A general computer program has been developed for analytic fatigue crack growth. It is designed so that the user does not need to have an extensive background in Fracture Mechanics Theory. This FORTRAN program can analyze the growth of most common types of cracks and accounts for the transition from part-thru to com- pletely thru-the-thickness crack. The input loading may be a mission profile or arbitrary cyclic stresses with or without concentrated loads and may be repeated a number of times. There are built-in corrections for geometry, plastic-zone size, plane-stress vs. plane-strain and applicability of Linear-Elastic-Fracture-Mechanics, and there are options available for crack growth rate calculations, retardation models and plastic zone correc- tions. 810596. Development of a Simple, Self-Contained Flight Test Data Acquisition System. Ronald R. L. Renz, Robert Clarke, Mark A. Mosser, Jan Roskam and Dale Rummer, Univ. of Kansas Flight Research Laboratory. This paper describes a simple, self-contained flight test data acquisition system. The system makes use of the latest sensor and microprocessor technology available, to reduce overall system costs. Coupled with this is the use of modern control theory techniques allowing minimization of data requirements, as well as flight time requirements. Capability of the system includes primarily stability and performance analysis of general aviation airplanes, al- though system versatility has been designed into the package. Presented are details of the prototype system constructed, as well as details of the data reduction technique utilized. Preliminary results of the flight test program have also been included which demonstrate the capability of this system. 1981 SAE Transactions 810597. Status of Dynamic Flight Test Technology - Model Identification for Flight Simulation. J. A. Mulder and J. G. den Hollander, Delft Univ. of Technology. Dynamic flight test technology has by now emerged as a valuable tool for assessment of aircraft performance characteristics and stability and control characteristics. In this paper emphasis is on applications in the context of flight simulation. It is shown that after flight path reconstruction and reconstruction of the motion of the primary control system a linear and stepwise identifi- cation procedure can be applied for the development of aerodynamic models and models of primary control force characteristics. These models can be implemented in mathematical models for aircraft flight simulation. 1981 SAE Transactions 810599. Analytical Techniques for the Analysis of Stall/Spin Flight Test Data. Lawrence W. Tay- lor, Jr., NASA Langley Research Center, Hamp- ton, VA; and Vladislav Klein, The George 100</page><page sequence="82">810600-810605 Washington Univ., JIAFS/NASA Langley Re- search Center, Hampton, VA. Analytical techniques for the analysis of stall/spin flight test data are reviewed by discussing (1) certain special flight instrumentation issues, (2) the mathematical mod- eling techniques, and (3) the analysis of post stall and spinning flight of general aviation airplanes. The angles of attack, sideslip, roll, pitch, and yaw are derived from measurements of angular velocity and linear acceleration. The key to the success of this approach is to simulta- neously estimate both the biases in the instrumentation and the initial conditions. Techniques for determining stability derivatives from flight data are applied to angles of attack too high for stabilized flight. This practice greatly expands the range over which aerodynamic characteristics can be determined from flight test. Non- linear terms in certain aerodynamic functions are shown to be valid by comparing them with the trends of results at different angles of attack. A very old technique of studying spins is extended and applied to some modern light airplanes. Airplanes for which the wing provides the dominant moments during spins, offer the possibility of linking spin characteristics to longitudinal data. 1981 SA E Transactions 810600. The Effect of Proplets and Bi-Blades on the Performance and Noise of Propellers. John P. Sullivan, L K. Chang and C. J. Miller, Purdue University. A analytical technique for predicting the aerodynamic performance of propellers with tip devices (proplets) using vortex lattice method shows that the ideal efficiency of a fixed diameter propeller can be improved by 1-5%. By suitable orientation and sweep of the proplet, the noise analysis method presented predicts that propellers with tip devices will have approximately the same noise as propellers without tip devices. Therefore proplets can be added to a fixed diameter propeller to improve the efficiency with no increase in noise or the noise may be reduced by decreasing the diameter with no loss in aerodynamic efficiency. 1981 SA E Transactions 810602. Propeller Performance and Design as Influenced by the Installation. Henry V. Borst, Henry V. Borst and Associates, Wayne, PA. The performance of a propeller is influenced by the effects of the airplane components including the nacelle, fuselage and wing. These bodies induce flow velocity changes in the propeller plane which changes the blade load distri- bution from that in free air and thus effects the propeller performance. The flow field in the wake of the propeller influences the drag of the propeller nacelle and the lift of the wing. In addition, the mutual interference of the pressure fields induced by the propeller and bodies influence the performance. This includes a drag increase due to interference between the blade inboard section and the spinner. The effects of these mutual interactions between the propeller and its supporting bodies on performance is discussed along with methods for deter- mining the performance changes. Illustrations are given to show the magnitude of the changes in performance due to the interactions and how the losses can be eliminated or reduced. With proper attention to the design of the propeller installation, the potential for improving the overall performance is large. 810603. Investigation of a Flight Test Method for the Measurement of Propeller Thrust. S. J. Miley and Leonard S. Miller, Texas A&amp;M Univ.; Ken Hall and Houg-Jen Tsai, Mississippi State Univ. A full scale wind tunnel test was performend with a general aviation aircraft to investigate the use of the slipstream momentum survey method as a means of measuring propeller thrust in flight. Aircraft angle of attack is shown to have significant influence on the momentum measurements. Thrust values obtained from the slipstream momentum correlated well with overall aircraft force measurements; however, insufficient data regarding the slip-stream static pressure variation resulted in a systematic error in the results. The need for detail static pressure measurements in the slipstream is dem- onstrated. 810604. A Prediction Procedure for Propeller Aircraft Flyover Noise Based on Empirical Data. Michael H. Smith, Cessna Aircraft Co. Forty-eight different flyover noise certification tests are analyzed using multiple linear regression methods. A prediction model is presented based on this analysis, and the results compared with the test data and the two other prediction methods. The aircraft analyzed include 30 single engine aircraft, 16 twin engine piston aircraft, and two twin engine turboprops. The importance of helical tip Mach number is verified and the relationship of several other aircraft, engine, and propeller parameters is devel- oped. The model shows good agreement with the test data and is at least as accurate as the other prediction methods. It has the advantage of being somewhat easier to use since it is in the form of a single equation. 1981 SA E Transactions 810605. Vortex Drag Reduction by Diffusing Vanes: Design for the "Thrush" Agricultural Aircraft. J. E. Hackett, Lockheed-Georgia Co. The use of low aspect ratio, often untapered wings on agricultural aircraft leads to strong tip vortices, high induced drag and disruption of spray patterns. Wing tip devices which modify the trailing vortex offer perform- ance and flow improvements. A systematic experimental program has lead to a patented vortex diffuser device for drag reduction which 101</page><page sequence="83">810606-810611 comprises a winglet-like vane mounted from a boom which trails a wing tip. Flight test experiments on an RCRV model indicate slight degradation of lateral stability with such vortex diffusers fitted but substantial degradation for winglets. Analysis indicates this is due to increases in with the tip devices present. The design of Vortex Diffuser Vanes for the "Thrush" agricultural aircraft is described. Instrumented flight tests are scheduled for Spring, 1981. 810606. Effects of Wingtip Modifications on Handling Qualities of Agricultural Aircraft. Cornelis P. van Dam, University of Kansas, Lawrence, Kansas. The effect of wingtip modifications on the stability and control characteristics of an agricultural airplane has been studied by means of a nonplanar quasi-vortex-lattice method. The method is used to compute the changes in steady state and perturbed state lateral-directional stabil- ity and control derivatives produced by wingtip mounted winglets, vortex diffuser vanes, and tip extensions. The study shows that the combination of excessive positive dihedral effect produced by the winglets and adverse yaw due to aileron deflection can have a detrimental effect on the roll control characteristics of the airplane. Introduc- tion of an aileron-rudder-interconnect, and reduction of the effective diehedral by canting-in of the winglets, or addition of a lower winglet can eliminate the roll control problems. 810607. Predicting Aerially Applied Particle Deposition by Computer. Alan J. Bilanin and Milton E. Teske, Continuum Dynamics, Inc., Princeton, N.J.; and Dana J. Morris, NASA Langley Research Center, Hampton, Va. This paper is a status report on a NASA effort to develop a computer code capable of simulating the deposition of materials in the wake of fixed or rotary wing aircraft operating under realistic atmospheric conditions. The deposition code "Ag Disp" is novel in that the mean particle trajectory, as well as the variance from the mean resulting from fluid fluctuations are simultaneously predicted. Sample calculations are undertaken to dem- onstrate the versatility of this code. 810608. Leading Edge High Lift Devices for Agricultural Aircraft. Karl H. Bergey, University of Okla- homa. This paper covers the results of a series of analytic and test programs on the installation of fixed leading-edge slats to standard agricultural aircraft. The results show that very considerable improvements in performance and safety are possible with relatively simple slat configurations. So- called "thin" single-surface slats were found to perform as well as more complex conventional slats for this particular application. The "thin" slats have a number of advantages in cost and weight, and in their ability to be retrofitted to existing aircraft. The application of "thin" slat technology - both fixed and automatic - to a broader range of general aviation aircraft would seem to have a great deal of merit for improving safety and performance. 810609. Structural Design - The Mother of Invention. Howard W. Smith, Univ. of Kansas. The importance of the structural design engineer is cited as the origin of a new course. Our aero curriculum and a course that fits into that curriculum is described. A course outline that emphasizes engineering on-the-board, and student design projects are described. Difficulties and problems encountered by the students and the instructor are also described. A general unavailability of design data is discussed and recommendations are suggested. Two references, and the detailed table of contents for reference two are also given. 810610. Matrix Load Analysis Method for Flexible Air- craft Structures. George W. Martin, Sr., Spe- cialist Consultant, Martin Engineering Corp. An integrated loads and stress analysis program has been written to shorten the time involved in analyzing the effect of flexibility on load distribution. The program was set up to efficiently interface with NASTRAN although any other similar structural analysis program could be used. The required matrices, coupling the aerodynamic and structural response to applied loads, are constructed automatically in the computer program. Comparisons are presented between the program output and experimental data for an actual flight article verifying the method presented. 810611. Determination of Crash Test Pulses and Their Application to Aircraft Seat Analysis. Emilio Alfaro-Bou and M. Susan Williams, NASA- Langley Research Center, Hampton, VA; and Edwin L. Fasanella, Kentron International, Inc., Hampton, VA. Deceleration time histories (crash pulses) from a series of twelve light aircraft crash tests conducted at NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) were analyzed to provide data for seat and airframe design for crashwor- thiness. Two vertical drop tests at 12.8 m/s (42 ft/s) and 36 G peak deceleration (simulating one of the vertical light aircraft crash pulses) were made using an energy ab- sorbing light aircraft seat prototype. Vertical pelvis acceleration measured in a 50 percentile dummy in the energy absorbing seat were found to be 45% lower than those obtained from the same dummy in a typical light aircraft seat. A hybrid mathematical seat-occupant model was developed using the DYCAST nonlinear finite element 102</page><page sequence="84">810612-810618 computer code and was used to analyze a vertical drop test of the energy absorbing seat. Seat and occupant accelerations predicted by the DYCAST model compared quite favorably with experimental values. 810612. Simulation of Aircraft Seat Response to a Crash Environment. J. W. Coltman, A. O. Bolukbasi and D. H. Laananen, Simula Inc. A new structural analysis method is being developed for incorporation into the seat/occupant model (Program SOM-LA), which is intended for use in evaluating the crashworthinass of aircraft seats. The analytical technique is described, and its capabilities are demonstrated in the simulation of the dynamic test of an actual aircraft seat. Computer simulation results are presented and compared with the test data. 810613. Crashworthy Design Concepts for Airframe Structures of Light Aircraft. James D. Cronkhite, Bell Helicopter Textron, Fort Worth, TX. Crashworthy concepts for airframe structures of general aviation aircraft have been investigated under the spon- sorship of NASA Langley Research Center. Several crashworthy concepts of energy-absorbing lower floor structures were developed. Design support tests were conducted to determine the performance of these con- cepts. Five concepts were selected for fabrication as full-scale floor test sections. These floor test sections were designed to have a high strength structural platform, capable of attaching crashworthy, energy-absorbing seats, supported by an underfloor crush zone that provides energy absorption and controls the loads to this platform. The design of these floor sections was analytically verified with NASTRAN for the static conditions and with KRASH for the dynamic conditions. From the five selected concepts, eighteen floor sections (three or four sections of each concept) were fabricated and delivered to the NASA Langley Research Center where they were tested under static and dynamic loading conditions. As a result of this investigation, it appears as though several of the crashworthy concepts are feasible and can be incorporated into the airframe design of future general aviation aircraft. 1981 SA E Transactions 810614. Aircraft Subfloor Response to Crash Loadings. Huey D. Carden and Robert J. Hayduk, NASA Langley Research Center, Hampton, VA. Results are presented of an experimental and analytical study of the dynamic response to crash loadings of five different load-limiting subfloors for general aviation aircraft. These subfloors provide a high-strength structural floor platform to retain the seats and a crushable zone to absorb energy and limit vertical loads. Experimental static load-deflection data and dynamic deceleration response data for the five subfloors indicated that the high-strength floor platform performed well in that structural integrity and residual strength was main- tained throughout the loading cycle. The data also indicated that some of the subfloor crush zones were more effective than others in providing nearly constant load for a range of displacement. The analytical data was generated by characterizing the nonlinear crush zones of the subfloor with static load-deflection data and using the DYCAST nonlinear finite element computer program. Comparisons between experimental and analytical data showed good correlation for the subfloors in which the static deformation mode closely approximated the dynamic deformation mode. 1981 SA E Transactions 810615. US Army Crashworthiness Program. George T. Singley, III, US Army Aviation Research and Development Command, St. Louis, MO. Results of the US Army R&amp;D effort to improve aircraft crashworthiness are presented. Because this crashwor- thiness R&amp;D program has spanned more than 20 years, this paper is only a summary; however, over the years scores of technical reports have been published docu- menting in detail the results of this program. 810617. Human Factors Aspects of Emergency Egress from a Business Jet. Thomas J. Armstrong and Richard G. Snyder, Department of Environ- mental and Industrial Health and Highway Safety Research Institute, Institute of Science and Technology, The University of Michigan. Past research has shown that although occupants often survive crash impacts of business jet aircraft, they are often injured either in the course of egress or because they are unable to evacuate. A physical task analysis was performed to evaluate procedures for emergency egress from a typical business jet to demonstrate how possible human factors problems can be identified. First, the tasks required for the flight crew to evacuate via all possible routes were determined. Second, each task was divided into a series of physical elements, such as reach and grasp, corresponding to each movement or exertion. Third, physical aspects of the aircraft affecting performance of each element such as location and force, were measured. The physical requirements of each element were com- pared with available human factors data, to rate its difficulty. Selected aspects of the analysis are discussed. 1981 SA E Transactions 810618. Avco Lycoming's ALF 502 High Bypass Fan Engine. Michael Cusick, Lycoming Division, Avco Corporation, Stratford, Connecticut. The factors influencing the design of the ALF502 engine and the evolution and development status of Lycoming's turbofan engine were the subjects of a paper presented to the Society in San Diego on October 1972. 103</page><page sequence="85">810619-810625 We study herein today's ALF502 and its selection as the engine to power the latest corporate business jet aircraft and to power a new short haul commuter aircraft.

Hawes, Aviation Electric Ltd., (Mon- treal/Canada) (Fully Owned Subsidiary of Bendix Corp.). Electronic fuel controls have been in existence for over twenty years. Microprocessor based controls, however, are just now beginning to make their way into the market place. The flexibility of these controls allow the require- ments for many applications to be met with similar hardware, and so it is expected that these controls will have an impact on a large part of the General Aviation Market. 810620. Electronic Control System for a Modern Tur- boprop Engine. J. S. Frew and M. F. Keck, Garrett Turbine Engine Co., A Division of the Garrett Corp. The basic objective was to create an integrated fuel control and propeller governor system fully compatible with engine characteristics so that optimum engine performance would be attained during all ground and flight operation within the engine operating envelope. This system requires less aircraft linkage, a reduction in the number of engine control components, a reduction in the hydromechanical unit complexity, and ease of controls settings adjustment, compared to the current production control systems. The control system employs electronic, hydraulic, pneumatic, and mechanical components, which result in enhanced performance and reliability characteristics. The system provides automatic starting, engine starting speed switching functions, acceleration fuel scheduling, fuel governor, power settings, engine torque limiting, engine gas temperature limiting, engine gas temperature signal modification to provide "Single Red Line" operation, isochronous propeller governing, overspeed protection, and monitoring functions. The monitors will switch the computer and system to "Manual Mode" when the monitor limits are exceeded, and flight may be continued. 810622. Small Turbofan Engines: Their Impact on Gen- eral Aviation Aircraft. L. R. l'Anson and W. F. Schneider, Avco Lycoming Div., Stratford, CT. An evaluation is made on the application of small turbofan engines to general aviation aircraft.

Full-Scale Study of the Cooling System Aero- dynamics of an Operating Piston Engine Installed in a Light Aircraft Wing Panel. V. R. Corsiglia and J. Katz, Ames Research Center, NASA, Moffett Field, CA. Measurements of the drag and of the nacelle internal pressures on a wing and nacelle that housed a horizontally opposed piston engine were made in the 40- by 80-Foot Wind Tunnel at Ames Research Center. These tests are follow-ons to earlier tests made with the same wing and nacelle but in which the engine was replaced with an electric motor and an adjustable orifice plate. In the initial tests the orifice plates was used to control the rate of cooling-air flow through the nacelle and thereby to simulate a range of gasoline engine types. Good agree- ment was found between the results of those tests and of the test reported here. Also, the upper and lower plenum pressure and cooling-air flow rate were found to be related by conventional equations used to represent the flow through orifices. Tests were run with three cooling air inlet sizes over a free-stream velocity range from 50 to 150 knots, an angle of attack range from 0° to 10°, and a cowl-flap deflection range from 0° to 30°. The data were analyzed by computing a flow coefficient similar to that used in the analysis of orifices. It was found that all of the flow coefficient values fell within a band that varied linearly with inlet area. The linear mean line through this band provides an estimate of the relationship between cooling-air flow rate and upper plenum pressure over a wide range of test conditions. 810624. An Overview of General Aviation Propulsion Research Programs at NASA-Lewis Research Center. Edward A. Willis and William C. Strack, NASA Lewis Research Center. This paper presents a brief overview and technical highlights of general aviaton (g/a) propulsion research efforts and studies which have been underway at NASA's Lewis Research Center (LeRC) for the past severaL years. The review covers near-term improvements for current- type piston engines, as well as studies and limited corroborative research on several advanced g/a engine concepts, including diesels, small turboprops and both piston and rotary stratified-charge engines. Also described is basic combustion research, cycle modeling and diag- nostic instrumentation work that will be required to make the new engines a reality. The discussion emphasizes the most recently-completed studies and the basic underlying research work, which have not been reported previously. 1981 SAE Transactions 810625. Aerodynamic Design Data For a Cruise-Matched High Performance Single-Engine Airplane. Bruce J. Holmes and Cynthia C. Croom, NASA Langley Research Center, Hampton, VA. Design data are presented for a class of high-performance 104</page><page sequence="86">810628-810640 single-engine business airplanes. The design objectives include a cruise speed of 300 knots, a cruise altitude of 10,700 m (35,000 ft), a cruise payload of six passengers (including crew and baggage), and a no-reserves cruise range of 1300 n.mi. Two unconventional aerodynamic technologies were evaluated: the individual and combined effects of cruise-matched wing loading and of a natural laminar flow airfoil were analyzed. The tradeoff data presented illustrate the ranges of wing geometries, pro- pulsion requirements, airplane weights, and aerodynamic characteristics which are necessary to meet the design objectives. Very large design and performance improve- ments resulted from use of the aerodynamic technologies evaluated. It is shown that the potential exists for achieving more than 200-percent greater fuel efficiency than is achieved by current airplanes capable of similar cruise speeds, payloads, and ranges. 810628.

An Assessment of Advanced Technologies for Application to General Aviation. Garey T. Mat- suyama, Dept. of Aeronautics, USAF Academy; and David L. Kohlman, Flight Research Lab- oratory, University of Kansas, Center for Re- search, Inc. A study directed toward the identification and evaluation of applicable advanced technologies for general aviation was performed. An extensive data base was generated through visits to 31 general aviation manufacturers and 3 NASA research centers as well as through an exhaustive literature search. An evaluation technique was developed which allowed candidate technologies to be ranked according to potential benefit. Finally, design studies were performed for a 6-passenger personal/business airplane and a 19-passenger commuter airplane. The General Aviation Synthesis Program (GASP) was utilized during the design studies for propulsion system and vehicle sizing as well as mission performance analysis. This paper discusses the formulation and results of the evaluation technique and the design studies for the two airplanes. The results of the technology evaluation indicated that propulsion, aerodynamic, and composite technologies are extremely attractive to general aviation. When these technologies were incorporated into the design synthesis of the two airplanes, higher wing loadings and smaller airplanes resulted. Fuel savings of 50% for the 6-passenger airplane and 40% for the commuter were realized. 810637. Design Allowable Factors in Composite Mate- rials. K. R. Berg and Rune N. Anderson, Riggs Engineering Dept. CIBA-GEIGY Corp., San Diego, CA. A basic requirement for the design of structures fabricated from composite materials is a knowledge of the design allowables for the materials under consideration. These allowables not only include the fundamental static strength properties such as tension, compression, and shear, but also properties such as bearing strength, flexural strength fatigue characteristics, environmental effects, etc. The requirements on many structures include combined loading necessitating establishing an acceptable failure criteria. Composite materials have many variables which affect their properties. If these variations in properties are not properly recognized, the design allow- ables are penalized. This paper discusses statistical factors which influence design allowables, and the importance of recognizing those variables which can effectively reduce scatter in test data. Methods are discussed which, by narrowing the scatter in test data, will improve the design allowables. 1981 SA E Transactions 810640. Fibre Reinforced Composite Applications at De Havilland. L. K. John, Composite Structure Development, The De Havilland Aircraft of Canada Ltd; Downsview, Ontario. Fibre reinforced composites have been used in de Havilland aircraft since the late forties. The DHC-5 Buffalo and the DHC-6 Twin Otter continue the use of glass fibre in polyster and epoxy matrices. The 50 passenger Dash 7 makes extensive use of aramid fibre reinforced composites. The 36 passenger Dash 8 aircraft, presently in the design stage, will 105</page><page sequence="87">810642-810684 probably see a greater application of composites than the Dash 7. Applications are all secondary structure, ranging from simple fairings to load carrying components. This paper describes the de Havilland experience with fibre reinforced composites, particularly applications on the Dash 7. Interior and exterior applications, together with some design, testing and manufacturing aspects are covered. Proposed Dash 8 applications and some special applications are also briefly covered. 810642. Development of Simplified Airborne Computa- tions for Fuel Conservative Descents in a Time- Based Metered Air Traffic Environment. Charles E. Knox, NASA. The NASA has developed and flight-tested a simple flight management descent algorithm designed to improve the accuracy of delivering an airplane in a fuel-conservative manner to a metering fix at a time designated by air traffic control. This algorithm provides a three-dimensional path with terminal area time constraints (four-dimensional) for an airplane to make an idle-thrust, clean-configured (landing gear up, flaps zero, and speed brakes retracted) descent to arrive at the metering fix at a predetermined time, altitude, and airspeed. The descent path is calculated for a constant Mach/airspeed schedule from linear approximations of airplane performance with consider- ations given for gross weight, wind, and nonstandard pressure and temperature effects. Applications of the four-dimensional and descent planning capabilities of the algorithm to conventional airplanes is being investigated. This report describes the flight management descent algorithm and presents the results of the flight tests flown with the Terminal Configured Vehicle airplane. 810680. Ethanol Fumigation of a Tur bochar ged Diesel Engine. J. Chen, D. Gussert, X.Gao, C. Gupta and D. Foster, Univ. of Wisconsin - Madison, Mechanical Engineering Dept. Ethanol has been injected through an atomizing nozzle into the intake manifold of a four cylinder turbocharged diesel engine. It was found that to avoid liquid droplet impingement on the compressor blades the injector needed to be located downstream of the compressor, in the high pressure section of the inlet manifold. 160 proof and 200 proof alcohols were investigated with a series of percentage substitutions at different speeds and loads. The fumigation of ethanol resulted in a slight improvement in thermal efficiency at high loads and a small reduction at light loads. The ignition delay and rate of pressure rise also increased significantly when ethanol was added to the engine. A change in the proof of ethanol from 160 to 200 did not produce any noticeable change in engine per- formance. Emission measurements were also made and are discussed. The problem of obtaining uniform cylinder to cylinder distribution of alcohol has been encountered. 810681. Performance of Alcohol Blends in Diesel Engines. H. Shirvani, C. E. Goering and S. C. Sorenson, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. A normally aspirated, four-stroke diesel engine was tested under operation with two alcohol containing fuel blends. The fuels contained ethanol, butanol, heavy virgin distillate, diesel Nos. 2 and 4, and a ce tane improver. The proportions of the components were selected to give blends with properties within the range of diesel No. 2. The final blends contained 25 and 43.7 percent alcohols. Test results showed a loss in power due to the reduced heating value of the blends, and some deterioration of performance at light loads. At intermediate to heavy loads, satisfactory performance was obtained. 810683. Introduction to Mini and Microcomputer Based Field Data Collection Systems. Herbert C. John- son and Herman Wipperfurth, Electro/General Corp. Both minicomputer and microcomputer based field data collection systems are described in general terms, and the natural advantages of each for various data collection needs are listed. Finally, a detailed description is given for a microcomputer based data collector/processor. 810684. The Engineering Control of Diesel Pollutants in Underground Mining. John H. Johnson, Edward O. Reinbold and David H. Carlson, Michigan Technological Univ. A review of mine air pollutant standards and the important pollutants to control in underground mines using diesel powered equipment is presented. The under- ground Mine Air Quality Laboratory instrumentation is discussed. This includes the Mine Air Monitoring Labo- ratory (MAML) and the instrumented Load Haul Dump (LHD) vehicle. The MAML measures CO, N02, NO, C02, particulate and temperatures while the LHD instrumen- tation measures and records engine speed, rack position (fuel rate), vehicle speed, C02 concentration, exhaust temperature and operating mode with transducers and a Sea Data Corporation data logging and reader system. The mine LHD cycle data are related to the EPA 13 mode cycle data. Engine and aftertreatment emission control methods are reviewed including recent laboratory NO, N02, sulfate and particulate data for a monolith catalyst. Maintenance of the LHD vehicle by engine sub- systems in relation to component effects on emissions is presented. The design of a tailpipe Emissions Measure- ment Apparatus (EMA) for underground exhaust meas- urements of CO, C02, NO, N02 and particulate under loaded conditions is discussed including the method of loading the engine. Emissions data for several vehicles in two underground mines are given. The EMA is envisioned as a quality control measurement method to assist mine maintenance personnel in maintaining low emissions 106</page><page sequence="88">810686-810692 vehicles. CO and C02 data from the MAQL are presented for several ventilation control methods: a fan, a fan with vent tubing, Fume Diluters and two exhaust system designs. The modified exhaust system involved a rearward directed exhaust system pointed at a 20-30° angle towards the roof. This system was shown to enhance the natural ventilation in that the cool mine air flowed into the drift at the bottom of the drift and the diluted exhaust gasses flowed out of the drift at the top. The modified system was shown to reduce pollutant concentrations by 50% over the standard system which was directed out the side of the vehicle at the floor level. 810686. Optimal Design of Minimum Weight Structures. Jack Osborn and Leo Thiel, SDRC, Structural Dynamics Research Corp. A unique system for lightweight, optimal design of structures is now available to the design engineer. At the heart of this system is a new, computerized set of optimization algorithms which assist the engineer in selecting the most promising concept. By combining this set of algorithms with existing finite element preproces- sors, analysis programs, and postprocessors, the design engineer can now develop an optimal, lightweight struc- ture in much less time. 810687. The Application of Plastic Scale Modeling to Construction Equipment Stress Analysis. M. K. Himmelein, Dynamics Research &amp; Development Corp., Toledo, OH. This paper presents a detailed explanation of the use of plastic models for the stress analysis of complicated structures similar to those encountered in the construction equipment industry. This explanation is supplemented by a specific consideration of the modeling and testing of a tractor-mounted ripper frame that was performed at Dynamics Research &amp; Development Corporation in Toledo. 1981 SA E Transactions 810688. Tooth Contact Analysis of Spiral Bevel and Hypoid Gears Under Load. Theodore J. Krenzer, Gleason Works, Rochester, NY. This paper describes a tool for analyzing tooth contact and motion transmission errors of spiral bevel and hypoid gear sets in the loaded state. Basic tooth geometry and no-load contact is described by standard tooth contact analysis programs (TCA) and blank dimensions. Relative deflections of the gear and pinion, due to load, are introduced either from deflection test data or are assumed based on typical deflections for an axle with similar geometry. Loading is assumed to be Hertzian taking into account boundary limits. Tooth deflections are based on beam theory. Load sharing is achieved through an iterative technique considering surface mismatches, tooth deformation and tooth bending. Some preliminary results are included. Experimental verification is needed. 1981 SA E Transactions 810689. Concepts of Product Support in an International Industrial Equipment Corporation. Roger A. Salway, Deere &amp; Co. Minimizing equipment downtime is a central concern of this conference. Fundamental to this concern is the need to define and measure the elements that significantly influence equipment downtime. The requirement for in-field management information led to the design of the Deere &amp; Company Total Reliability Analysis of Customer Equipment System (T.R.A.C.E.). T.R.A.C.E. measures in a timely and cost effective way, product reliability and life cycle costs, product serviceability, dealer service per- formance, and provides a means of improving parts service effectiveness. 810690. Product Support - A Dealer's Perspective. Dan Wujek, Valley Equipment Co. Product design engineering plays a vital role in the product support capabilities a dealership can offer. The design of the product has far reaching cost implications beyond the product itself. This paper deals with the effect of product design on the dealer's marketing capabilities, his employees and more importantly, the customer. 810691. The Challenge of Change. H. T. Larmore, (Retired), Deputy Executive Director, Construc- tion Industry Manufacturers Association, Mil- waukee, WI. This paper points out that engineers in the construction machinery industry, although experienced in coping with changes dictated by market place values, are not facing the challenge of changes resulting from and dictated by political intervention (regulations). Conflict between the normal objectives of the construction machinery industry and the assigned social type goals of regulators creates an inherent adversary relationship. Suggestions for dealing with this new dimension of change are given with applicability at national and international levels. Basically, the engineers' role will involve use of their normal tools - facts and pertinent, creditable data - properly presented and used. 810692. Friction Welding - Its Mechanical Properties. John D. Matyazic, TEREX, Inc., Hudson, OH. The mechanical properties of friction welded joints have been determined through tensile, fatigue, photoelastic and residual stress analyses. These properties and the testing methods involved are defined and the results compared to like joints welded with the flux-cored, gas-shielded process. 107</page><page sequence="89">810693-810740 810693. Vibration and Performance Testing with Smali Digital Test Systems. R. Gene Smiley, Anatrol Corp., Cincinnati, OH. Recent advances in electronics and technical advances in testing techniques have made the smaller Fourier Ana- lyzer test systems much more attractive as a more portable, more flexible alternative to large, rack-mounted minicomputer-based test systems. This paper will review numerous experimental tests performed in structural dynamics and operating performance by mechanical engineers in terms of their speed, data base size, calculation complexity, and transducer interface require- ments in an attempt to clarify the position of the smaller test system in the mechanical engineering test profession. 1981 SAE Transactions 810694. The Use of Existing and Advanced Intensity Techniques to Identify Noise Sources on a Diesel Engine. Malcolm J. Crocker, Purdue Univ. Existing techniques for identifying noise sources are reviewed. One such technique (the lead-wrapping ap- proach) was used to source-identify a diesel engine and measure the sound power radiated from the major surfaces. Two new advanced techniques (surface intensity and acoustic intensity) were developed and used to measure the sound power radiated from the same major surfaces. The conventional lead-wrapping and new inten- sity results were compared and agreement was good. The advantages of the new intensity techniques are described and suggestions made for reducing the noise of this and other similar diesel engines. 1981 SA E Transactions 810695. Off-Road Machine Operator Vibration Meas- urement Methods. J. C. Barton, Caterpillar Tractor Co. Analysis of off-road machine operator vibration data shows that the methods of absorbed power and ampli- tude-frequency distribution provide no information be- yond that expressed by the frequency weighted overall rms acceleration of SAE J1013 JAN80 and ISO 2631. The probability density functions of the data are Gaussian in both broad band and narrow band analysis. "Crest factor" is a meaningless descriptor of the data. As shown by examples, failure to consider the statistical precision of the random data results in erroneous time domain and frequency domain statistics. 1981 SAE Transactions 810696. Design Considerations for Wet Wheel Brakes. Joseph R. Fox, Fox Friction, Inc. This paper presents a basic review of the characteristics of the components of wet friction design as they apply to wet wheel brakes. The intent is to provide an understanding of the variables for the design engineer not familiar with the terminology used in the trade. Areas covered include: friction material, mating members, fluids, and groove patterns. 810697. Development of a High Pressure Load Sensing Mobile Valve. Robert H. Breeden, Sperry Corp. A program was initiated in 1975 to develop a high pressure load sensing valve for the Earthmoving and Construction Equipment market, with initial focus on excavators. The need for pilot operation, higher pressures, protection in case of line rupture, and improved metering dictated a departure from conventional approaches. A meter-out element which operates independently of a meter-in element was developed. By incorporating the elements in an actuator mounted valve body, objectives were met. A description of operation is presented, along with performance results. 1981 SAE Transactions 810698. An Example of Noise Control Treatment for Construction Machinery Cab Interiors. Walter Nakkula, Jr., Globe Industries; René Zimmerli, Interkeller, A.G.; and Richard Borough, Fiat- Allis. The effect of noise on the operator has become of increasing concern to manufacturers of construction machinery in recent years. Although the noise generated by heavy duty con- struction equipment is much greater when compared to other types of machines such as the passenger car, the problems are similar. Many of the lessons learned in reducing interior noise within the automobile can be used to reduce noise within the operator's cab of construction machinery. This paper represents the results of a joint effort between Fiat-Allis Construction Machinery, Inc., and Globe Industries, Inc. to apply these lessons to reduce the noise within the cab of a medium sized crawler tractor. 810699. Modeling Directionally Radiating Acoustical En- closures to Determine Noise Levels. Ed O'Keefe, Clark Equipment Co., Construction Machinery Div., Benton Harbor, MI. A computer modeling procedure has been developed to assess the effect of an enclosure on far-field noise levels. The model accounts for directional radiation patterns and enclosure diffraction effects for each of the six sides. Each side is represented as a point source, and for a given receiver location, all possible noise paths are appropriately weighted and summed. Application is made for several tractor shovels which use various design changes directed towards meeting Environmental Protection Agency stan- dards. Comparisons between predictions and test meas- urements show good agreement. 810740. (SP-490) SMC: Thinner - Smoother - Tougher, A New Generation of Low Profile Additives. K. E. Atkins, R. C. Gandy and R. R. Gentry, Union Carbide Corp., Research and Devel- opment, South Charleston, WV. The automotive industry's need for thinner, smoother and tougher low profile sheet molding compound (SMC) 108</page><page sequence="90">810742-810746 composites for the evolving body panel parts of the 1980's has prompted the development of Union Carbide Low Profile Additives XLP-4514 and XLP-8521. Composites utilizing these additives have provided Class A surface characteristics at 80 mils thickness and above on devel- opmental deck lid tools. Also improved surfaces on commercial parts such as a variety of models of grill opening panels, truck hoods, etc. have been observed. These studies were conducted using computer assisted experimental designs and results-analysis to ensure valid conclusions. XLP-4514 was engineered for use with modified rigid resins currently employed widely with Union Carbide Low Profile Additive LP-40A. XLP-8521 provides Class A surface with new, proprietary tougher resins as well as yielding composites with both superior surface and composite toughness. 810742. (SP-490) Glass Fibre- Reinforced Plastics in European Passenger Cars - Requirements and Applications. Klaus-D. Johnke, Passenger Car Development, Volkswagenwerk AG-Wolfsburg, (Federal Republic of Germany). Over the last decade an unstable situation in the energy and raw material sectors has had a noticable influence on the use of plastics in European automotive engineering. New approaches to the raw material and energy situation indicated that plastics would be the materials of the future. It became clear that plastomers, duromers and elastomers can be used not only for the body and external components but also for parts subjected to heavy mechanical stresses. This paper discusses the extent to which light-weight constructions using composite materials are realistic and whether high polymers can help to save energy to the extent dictated by economic requirements or whether the step from proven technical feasibility to high-volume production constitutes a stumbling block. 1981 SA E Transactions 810743. (SP-490) Development of an Automotive SMC Door. F. L. Massey, Owens-Corning Fiberglas, Granville, OH. This is the result of a joint program between Automobiles Peugeot and Owens-Corning Fiberglas with the objective to design, analyze, and prototype an SMC door for a Peugeot 305, achieving a substantial weight saving and performing the same functions as the production steel door. It is expected that automotive engineers will derive additional benefits from designing in glass composites, as aerodynamic styling becomes a factor in fuel efficiency. The design flexibility of molded components, and the modest tooling cost of compression molds (compared to progressive metal stamping tooling) will allow the designer to achieve smooth aerodynamic shapes with reduced tooling or assembly penalty. An energy analysis shows the savings of using SMC compared to steel and aluminum. 810744. (SP-490) SMC Compounding Process Control and Automation. Graham Ross, Research and Development Div., Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp., Technical Center, Granville, OH. This is a status report covering ongoing development work on the compounding process used to produce sheet molding compound (SMC). This material is used in compression molding to produce fiberglass reinforced plastic (FRP) parts of which the Corvette body and most grille opening panels are typical. The goal of this work is to improve the quality of the SMC material to facilitate its use in more demanding applications of the future, such as large exterior body panels. Specific areas being addressed include the reproducibility and uniformity of sheet weight, glass content, and thickening rate. A new SMC machine has been built for studying process modifications and computer control. This paper will review the goals, approaches and equipment involved in this work. 810745.

The versatility of polyurethane RIM systems is shown to offer the capability of meeting the requirements of many new automotive applications. The effects of the isocyanate component composition on the physical properties of polyurethane RIM systems are reported. Results and interpretations are presented which give guidance to automotive design engineers in tailoring RIM material properties to match parts design and cost criteria. Several liquefied MDI products used in RIM systems are described and their influence on performance in auto- motive formulations is compared. 810746. (SP-490) Continuously Produced Steel Lami- nates Having Polymeric Cores. Harold H. Levine, Pre Finish Metals Corp., Elk Grove Village, IL. Standard press lamination techniques cannot meet cost and volume requirements as envisioned for large scale users such as the transportation industries. The concept of metal-to-metal laminates is not new to engineers, but the successful development of continuous processing has now, in effect, served to make available a new material based on a polypropylene core and metallic skins. Various other polymers have been successfully used in the laboratory on a variety of metallic substrates, and this indicates that an entirely new family of material systems is available for exploitation. The total amount of data generated so far by all investigators are limited, but strongly suggest several uses by the automotive, construction and applicance industries and in applications where increases in specific stiffness and/or sound attenuation are of interest. 109</page><page sequence="91">810747-810753 810747.

The new products are candidates for injection molded interior and exterior automotive components. 810749. Feed-Forward Dynamometer Controller for High Speed Inertia Simulation. Severino D'Angelo and R. D. Gafford, Horiba Instruments, Inc. In general, control systems may be divided into two categories, feed-back and feed-forward systems. The output of a feed-back system is controlled by first comparing it to a desired value and then generating an error function proportional to the difference. The error function is then added to the system input through a regulator and a feed-back path. Thus, the output is forced to converge toward its correct value. Although this system achieves accurate results, it does so at the expense of response time. A feed-forward system does not employ a feed-back path nor does it generate an error signal. The elimination of these two functions can result in a substantial decrease in response time, particularly, when dealing with inherently slow systems and large error functions. A feed-forward system controls its output by precisely computing the input function from all state variables that affect the system. In practice, results obtained with feed-forward control alone are not as accurate as those obtained with feed-back. For this reason, a certain amount of feed-back should be used with feed-forward when the system control accuracy must be high. This paper describes a feed-forward control system used in the simulation of road load and inertia in an electric chassis dynamometer. This system is implemented with a digital microcomputer and a high-speed arithmetic logic unit (ALU) to produce high-speed inertia simulation comparable to simulation done with flywheel. 1981 SA E Transactions 810750. Selecting the Correct Chassis Dynamometer System. Richard A. Marshall, Laboratory Equipment Corp. Once the decision is made to test vehicles on a chassis dynamometer, the selection of the chassis dynamometer system is the next order of business. Since dynamometer equipment is available in several sizes, shapes and types and can be put together in several configurations, it is sometimes difficult to select the one dynamometer that best fits the requirements of the test program. This paper describes a decision making process for selecting a dynamometer system. The areas of cost, types of tests, available room and accuracy of requirements are dis- cussed. The discussion includes the various types of absorbers and motoring devices, the effect of roll size and the effect of speed increasers. Various types of manual and automatic controls and data acquisition systems are also included in the discussion. 810752. Frequency Response Characterization and Com- pensation of the Lamdascan™ A/F Analyzer. D. R. Hamburg, M. A. Shulman, C. F. Aquino and M. D. Palmer, Ford Motor Co. A procedure which uses modulated engine exhaust to characterize the amplitude vs. frequency response of air-fuel ratio (A/F) measuring equipment is described, and typical results obtained when the procedure is applied to a standard Lamdascan A/F Analyzer are given. A technique for extending the frequency response of the Lamdascan instrument by a factor of approximately two is discussed, and the measured characteristics which result when the improvements are incorporated into the in- strument are presented. 1981 SA E Transactions 810753. Television System for Viewing Engine Combus- tion Processes and the Image Analysis. Kazuhiro Kozuka, Akinori Saito, Masayoshi Otsuka and Kiyomi Kawamura, Toyota Central Research and Development Labs., Inc. A television viewing system with a high speed shutter TV camera has been developed for viewing and recording combustion processes in internal combustion engines. The technique has been applied to the study of combustion events in an engine with a transparent piston. The recorded combustion images were analyzed and statis- tically processed by a microcomputer for summation, averaging, and contour forming. The averaged flame propagation patterns are discussed in comparison with the gas flow motion and cylinder pressure data obtained by conventional methods. This TV technique is easy and 110</page><page sequence="92">810754-810761 effective in obtaining combustion data for various operating conditions and engine geometries. 1981 SA E Transactions 810754. Nissan Oil Econometer Permits the Measure- ment of Engine Oil Consumption. Yoshifumi Hase, Yasuo Nakajima, Shuya Nanbu and Isao Murase, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. A technique has been developed which permits the determination of engine oil consumption on an instan- taneous basis. The procedure uses the sulfur in the oil as a tracer. The concentration of sulfur compounds in the exhaust gas is determined using a Flame Photometric Detector (FPD). Special modifications of the FPD reduce the interference of other gases and improve the accuracy of the instrument. Although the unit is operationally simple, its abilities to measure continuously and respond quickly allow it to surpass conventional methods for measurement of oil consumption.

Christiansen, New Departure Hyatt Bearings, Div. of General Motors Corp., Sandusky, OH. NDH integral ball bearing spindles were used for the first time on the front and rear wheel positions on GM's 1979 E Car and 1980 X Car and are the mainstream wheel bearing design for more future vehicles. This presentation reviews: wheel bearing history that led to the development of these spindles, program objectives, construction details, laboratory test experience, vehicle test programs, design validation procedures, and testing that was coordinated over a two year time period by a General Motors corporate reliability and product engineering task force. 810756. A Family of Tapered Roller Bearings for Front Wheel Drive Vehicles. Brian J. Cave and Harvey P. Nixon, The Timken Co. Automotive wheel and brake engineers are studying various wheel bearing concepts which lend themselves to easy installation and reduction of unsprung weight. A family of tapered roller bearing designs has been devel- oped for both driving and non-driving wheels which offer the industry several options for marrying suspension, wheel and bearing components. While differing in con- figuration, all may be selected to meet established criteria for satisfactory performance based on the latest bearing analysis techniques and experience derived from extensive laboratory and field test programs. 1981 SA E Transactions 810757. Automotive Hub Bearing Units - European Ex- perience. Sven A. Benktander, SKF. The last 15 years have seen a steady increase in the proportion of European front wheel drive cars to the current 60-70 percent. To save space and weight, the traditional two-bearing arrangement has been superseded by a preset, greased-for-life and sealed, double row bearing unit. Already in its simplest form this unit cuts assembly and manufacturing costs. The lastest SKF development incorporates hub, bearing and stub axle functions and allows hub carrier and drive joint designs to be simplified. 810758. Applications of Pre-Packaged Wheel Bearing Assemblies. John W. Carlisle, Kelsey-Hayes Co., Romulus, MI. This paper presents a general discussion of bearing applications for non-driving wheels and independently sprung driving wheels. It stresses the advantages of a pre-packaged bearing assembly. The pre-packaged bear- ing assembly is a complete package including a housing with means of attaching it to the vehicle and a hub for mounting the wheel, with the bearings permanently greased, sealed, and properly adjusted. The hub may be splined for the driving wheel application or not splined for the nondriving wheel application. 810759. Improved Rearward View. Stig Pilhall, Volvo Car Corp. Various possibilities to improve the rearward view in passenger cars have been studied, with the aim, among others, to eliminate "dead angle". Tests have been performed with periscopes, vehicle TV, combined mirrors and mirrors with continuously variable curvature. The later ones have been optimized to a well functioning solution. 1981 SA E Transactions 810761. Driver Head Movements in Left Outside Mirror Viewing. Vivek D. Bhise, James F. Meldrum, Daniel D. Jack, George M. Troell, David H. Hoffmeister and Lyman M. Forbes, Ford Motor Co. Two field studies were conducted on public roads to measure driver head movements while using the left outside passenger car mirror. The first study measured the effects of mirror width in the presence or absence of overtaking traffic. Driver head movements during left lane-changing maneuvers were recorded from a lead vehicle equipped with a motion picture camera and a telephoto-zoom lens. Results showed that, in addition to the head turning motions, the drivers made on the average about 2.0 inches of lateral head movements while using one of the four left outside mirror sizes which ranged in width from 2.3 to 10.6 inches. The drivers were also found to make larger lateral head movements when no other vehicles were present in the mirror as compared to when an overtaking vehicle was present. The second study was conducted in no overtaking traffic with one mirror width and used an improved photographic technique. Head 111</page><page sequence="93">810762-810772 movements during left lane changing maneuvers were recorded by a motion picture camera which was mounted in the back of the subject's car and which photographed the image of the driver's head and eyes in the left outside mirror. The data of 25 drivers using a 5.1 inch wide left outside mirror showed that drivers moved their head laterally from 0.4 to 5.0 inches, with a median of 1.5 inches, after turning their heads to search in the mirror. In both field studies, large individual head movement behavioral differences were observed. 810762. Infinitely More See. S. A. Heenan and J. E. Wilson, Signal Products Div., Amerace Corp. As drivers, we are aware of the devices used by Traffic Engineers to present a better picture of the road and hence ease our driving task. Many products are used for this purpose and their characteristics and limitations are discussed in this paper. At night, markings are dependent primarily upon vehicle headlights for visibility and must be efficient reflecting devices to be seen at useful distances. Two principles of retroreflectance are described and their properties are compared. Relationship between the light source and the viewer's eye are covered. Recent technology utilizing the triple-mirror type of reflector has greatly increased the assurance of driver guidance, particularly in the rain and other adverse weather conditions. Examples of the installation of various types of delineations are shown. Accident data and cost/benefit ratios are discussed. 810766. Structural Urethane Adhesives for High Speed Automotive Assembly. G. M. Maclver, The Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co., Adhesive Operations. Standard two component structural urethane adhesive systems have been used successfully to bond structural plastic composites at moderate processing speeds for over a decade. The major limitation of these systems is the ability to meet high speed assembly line criteria. Recent advances in both urethane adhesive chemistry and application technology have made the concept of high speed structural composite assembly a practical reality. 810767. Bonding of Automotive Plastics - Technology and Applications. W. A. Pletcher, Structural Adhe- sives, Sealers and Coatings, AC&amp;S Division, 3M Research Center. Adhesive bonding of automotive plastics is an area that will receive increasing attention in the future. Many rigid and flexible plastic substrates are being used today in the manufacture of automobiles. Many new materials (RIM, RRIM, Polyester composites, ABS, polyolefins) are being considered in the replacement of standard automotive metals. The considerations of weight reduction, corrosion resistance, design possibilities and production improve- ments are obvious. Our discussion of Adhesive Bonding Technology &amp; Applications will include: (a) Engineering adhesives to structurally bond rigid plastics to themselves and metals. (b) General Adhesives to bond flexible plastics to rigid plastics or metals. (c) Thermoplastic Adhesives to bond a variety of specialty plastics. The general performance capabilities for each Adhe- sive System will be presented and typical applications discussed. It is proposed that the data will allow one to make sound decisions in the area of matching adhesives and applications in bonding of automotive plastics. 810769. Adhesives for Bonding Plastic Automotive Com- ponents. Barbara Dunn, R&amp;D Chemical/ CIBA-GEIGY. Although bonding of plastic automobile components is not new, certainly numerous new demands are being placed on this process today than ever before. Both new and different applications are being dis- covered for plastics, not only for the more traditional types, but also for newer modified plastics meeting current demands. With increasing demands being placed on plastics for the passenger car market, now more than ever, processing requirements are critical. As larger body components from various plastics are being planned and evaluated for upcoming car lines, assembly bonding techniques have become critical. From the history that has been generated by major plastic vehicle production, it is apparent that anything is possible, but the objective now is to find better, faster, and less costly bonding processes. 810772. An Analysis of the Movement of the Crankshaft Journals during Engine Firing. Masao Ishihama, Yoshimasa Hayashi and Takao Kubozuka, Cen- tral Engineering Laboratories, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd., (Yokosuka, Japan). In order to clarify the generation mechanism of engine noise, which is a significant problem in the first-burn engine, the behavior of the crankshaft, the force trans- ferred to the main bearing caps supporting the crankshaft, and the deformation of the cylinder block were analyzed during engine firing. As a result, it was determined that the crankshaft which deflects due to inertial force pushes the bearings violently under combustion pressure and causes intense fore-and-aft vibration of the bearings, which in turn causes vibration of the cylinder-block skirt. This is a main cause of combustion noise. 1981 SA E Transactions 112</page><page sequence="94">810773-810778 810773. Theoretical and Experimental Analysis of Rat- tling Noise of Automotive Gearbox. Toshimitsu Sakai, Yuhji Doi and Ken-ichi Yamamoto, Toyota Motor Co., Ltd. (Japan); Takeo Ogasawara and Mitsuaki Nari ta, Toyota Central Research &amp; Development Labs., Inc. (Japan). The rattling noise is most significant in many kinds of manual gearbox noises, which is generated at the idling stage of the engine operation; this stage means that a car is at rest and the gearbox is in neutral. In this report, results of our simulation analysis and experimental studies of this rattling noise are introduced. From the simulation results, it was found possible to reduce this rattling noise by optimizing the torsional characteristics of the clutch plate. This result was verified by a laboratory experiment. Applying the result into the actual passenger car, we succeeded in decreasing the rattling noise to the accept- able level. 810774. Effect of Charge Non-Homogeneity on Cycle- by-Cycle Variations in Combustion in SI Engines. B. P. Pundir, Indian Institute of Petroleum; V. A. Zvonow, Indian Institute of Petroleum, UNESCO, UNDP Project; and C. P. Gupta, Univ. of Roorkee. The influence of charge non-homogeneity on the cycle- by-cycle variations in combustion for a SI engine was studied experimentally and analyzed theoretically. Charge non-homogeneity was determined from the exhaust gas composition. Cycle-by-cycle variations in the maximum combustion pressure and the angle of maximum pressure were determined by using a real time data acquisition system. A linear relationship between charge non-ho- mogeneity and the cyclic variations in maximum pressure was found. Computed results showed that cyclic variations in maximum combustion pressure increase with increase in charge non-homogeneity at a given mixture strength. For the same charge non-homogeneity, cyclic variations also increase with leaning of the mixture and with increase in the duration of initial phase of combustion. 1981 SA E Transactions 810775. A Preliminary Assessment of the Automotive Gas Producer. Habib Amin and Russell F. Stebar, Fuels and Lubricants Dept., General Motors Research Labs., Warren, MI. The conversion of solid fuels, such as coal and wood, to a gaseous fuel in an on-board gas producer was examined as a means of fueling vital transportation vehicles in case of a catastrophic shortage of crude oil. The literature on automotive gas producers was reviewed, and a preliminary design of a gas producer was formulated for a compact car fueled with bituminous coal. The influence of other solid fuels on system design and operation is also discussed along with the advantages and disadvantages of auto- motive gas producers. Discussion: Carl H.

Schafer, Univ. of Kaiserslautern (West Germany). Previous investigations concerning the addition of hydro- gen to the air-gasoline mixture have shown the advantages of this operation in the OTTO- ENGINE. Due to the lean flammability limits of hydrogen and the chemical quality of methanol in reference to gasoline higher efficiencies and a reduction in exhaust emissions could be demon- strated. Another advantage is that these fuels - hydrogen and methanol - are not be based on petrol and can be produced synthetically. Furthermore the positive influence of addition of hydrogen on such parameters as burning velocity, com- bustion duration, burned fraction etc. can be demon- strated. 810777. On the Propagation of Turbulent Jet-Flame in a Closed Vessel. Junichi Furukawa and Tsutomu Gomi, Sophia University. In the stratified charge engine with an auxiliary chamber, the time required for combustion in the main chamber is considered to depend upon the characteristics of the turbulent jet-flame propagating in it. This study has been conducted to explore the controllability of the time required for combustion by changing the characteristics of the turbulent jet-flame. Experiments were performed by using a constant volume combustion chamber which was divided into a primary and a secondary chamber by an orifice plate. The characteristics of the turbulent jet-flame were changed by changing fuel, mixture strength and hole size of the orifice plate. The experimental results indicate that the time t required for combustion in the secondary chamber mainly depends upon the jet-flame velocity VF (propagation velocity of the leading front of the jet-flame) and the mixture strength $. It is shown that a unique relation exists between VF and (t SJ1, where SL is the laminar burning velocity of the mixture, except for rich mixtures of propane-air and n-butane-air. 810778. Clean Automobiles on Leaded Gasolines. Charles L. Goodacre, Consultant. This paper describes a novel 4-stroke piston SI engine Combustion System ('Marker'), designed and developed to meet the CAA Amendment S4358 of 1969 for car exhaust emissions for 1985 on 1969/70 vintage Leaded Gasolines. Combustion is initiated by a spark between a point anode and a diametrally placed Bar as cathode at the 113</page><page sequence="95">810779-810782 center of a spherical pre-combustion chamber. The 100-bar injected fuel collides with the bar cathode at BDC, finely atomises, and forms a 'stratified charge' by Einstein Vortex action prior to ignition within the Sphere, the cylinder being fuel dry. Ignition point is fixed 5° Early from Idle to full Power, due to the physics of Vortex action. This 'Marker' System can be built onto a slightly modified standard Monoblock; no complication in tool- ing, materials or production methods is needed for volume production. 'Marker' will meet CAA Amendment S4358 ultimate, requirement for Exhaust Emissions, eliminating the use of so called Advanced Exhaust Emission Control Devices. Exhaust Gas Energy Recovery (EGER) is used for supercharging. A CAFE of 33 mpUSg is obtained on a 1.5 tonne vehicle with 0.4CD using 1969/70 quality Leaded Gaso- lines. Widespread adoption of this Clean Marker System in the USA could save the Economy 3000 million tonnes of Crude Oil or circa 900 + Billion US Dollars by 2000 AD. 'Marker' would seem to be worth serious consideration. 810779. Impact of Fuel Economy Information on New Car and Light Truck Buyers. John Hemphill, J. D. Power and Associates; Barry McNutt and Eldon Rucker, U.S. Department of Energy; and Don- ald Snyder, California State Univ., Los Angeles. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estab- lished an automobile fuel economy information program shortly after the oil embargo, effective for the 1974 model year. The U.S. Department of Energy (formerly the Federal Energy Administration) joined EPA soon after- ward in sponsoring the information program. The pro- gram is aimed at furnishing consumers with information on estimated miles per gallon of new cars and light duty trucks. The mechanisms for distributing such information include mandatory display of fuel economy ratings on new vehicles, and copies of a printed Gas Mileage Guide for New Car Buyers required to be made available in car dealer showrooms. The program has gone through a number of changes over the years. Consumer interest in fuel economy has also increased in the past few years. Along with this increasing interest has come increased criticism of the EPA/DOE information program. In response to this criticism and in view of the many changes in the program the DOE initiated a compre- hensive evaluation of the information program. The evaluation was aimed at obtaining an accurate under- standing of the public's perception of the existing program and developing other information needed to make improvements in the program. Both quantitative and qualitative methods were used io assess program aware- ness and impact. The results of this evaluation, along with major findings and recommendations are presented. 810780. Fuel Economy of In-Use Passenger Cars: Labo- ratory and Road. Bennett Bradley, Jr., Karen E. Marschall, Lois A. Platte and John T. White, III, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. This report describes an evaluation of fuel economy of in-use passenger cars conducted by the U.S. Environ- mental Protection Agency during 1980. A total of 440 vehicles from the 1975-1980 model years were obtained from private owners in several cities. Each vehicle was tested according to the Federal Test Procedure and the Highway Fuel Economy Test. After the laboratory testing, the owners were asked to record their next four fuel purchases on a reply postcard. The results from the survey were analyzed and compared with the test results, estimates by the owner, and the values published in EPA's Gas Mileage Guide. 810781. Fuel Used to Accelerate Vehicles from Rest to Cruising Speeds. Leonard Evans and Gerald M. Takasaki, Transportation and Traffic Science Dept., General Motors Research Laboratories. This research was performed to experimentally determine how the amount of fuel used to accelerate an initially stationary vehicle to a constant cruising speed depends on acceleration level. Initially stationary vehicles were accel- erated at different rates to a constant cruising speed on a test track, and the amounts of fuel used to travel a fixed distance from the starting point were measured. By subtracting the amount of fuel that would have been required to travel this same distance at the cruising speed from the measured amounts, estimates of the additional fuel used to accelerate from standstill to the crusing speed were obtained. These estimates were then examined as a function of acceleration level, which was characterized by the time taken to reach the cruising speed. Tests were conducted for cruising speeds of 48 km/h, 64 km/h and 80 km/h. Factors investigated included differnet vehicles (8 in all), engines (L-4, V-6, V-8), and fuels (gasoline and diesel). The experimental results suggest that, in order to save fuel when accelerating from rest to different cruising speeds, drivers should: 1. Take about 15 to 20 seconds to accelerate smoothly to a speed of 48km/h (use an average acceleration of about 0.8 m/s2). 2. Use only light pressure on the accelerator pedal while accelerating at speeds greater than 48 km/h (keep acceleration below 0.7 m/s2). Drivers normally choose acceleration levels higher than those suggested above. 1981 SA E Transactions 810782. Minimizing the Weight and Cost of a Steel Deck Lid. William J.

Wolff, Alcoa Technical Center, Aluminum Company of America; and J. J. Bockhold, Structural Dy- namics Research Corporation. A minimum weight aluminum deck lid has been designed using 0.71 mm thick 6010 alloy sheet. Minimizing material weight will contribute to minimum cost. A stiff dimpled inner panel design allows aluminum panel gauges to be controlled by strength requirements. The deck lid's calculated overall stiffness is comparable to that of steel designs. Stretch-stamping and rope hemming are recommended forming and assembly methods. 1981 SA E Transactions 810784. SMC Deck Lid Design Study. Eugene Gray, Jr., Owens-Corning Fiberglas Technical Center, Granville, OH. The Multi-Materials Organizing Committee of the Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc., sponsored a deck lid design competition between steel, aluminum and fiberglas composites. The design input is ultimately to serve as a basis for developing manufactured part cost which will be compared in a follow-on report by Pioneer Engineering. The design envelope and performance criteria were tailored to a present production Oldsmobile Omega deck lid. 810785. A Study of the Costs of a Production Deck Lid Optimized for Steel, Aluminum and Sheet Mold- ing Compound. N. F. Ludtke, H. L. Kaminski and W. R. Osen, Pioneer Engineering and Manufacturing Co. Alternate material producers have designed deck lids optimized for aluminum, steel, and SMC, in an effort to reduce fuel consumption by reducing vehicle weight. This paper presents the relative estimated cost of each optimized design. The costs have been developed by a single source so that the relative cost differences are derived from the same base. The costing methodology used for this effort is presented in detail in Appendix A. The cost represents the variable cost, which includes direct labor, direct material and variable burden. This analysis is based on production methods normally used to produce 300,000 units per year. Labor, material and burden rates are typical of the Detroit area automotive industry and reflect 1981 economics. 810786. Lean Combustion in a High Compression Four Stroke Gasoline Engine. K. S. Herbsieb, L. Lorenzen and E. Kofoed, Laboratory for En- ergetics, Tech. Univ. of Denmark, (Copenhagen, Denmark). To achieve lean combustion in a gasoline engine, a swirl type combustion chamber is placed in the piston top. The compression swirl thereby created makes a rapid com- bustion possible, which is essential to a lean burn engine. The experiments are carried out with a single cylinder four stroke engine, mainly at a compression ratio of 13.8:1, and are compared to a Heron-type combustion chamber. Minimum fuel consumption is obtained at an air-fuel ratio of 19, and as an average, an improvement of approximately 5 per cent is found. The peak cylinder pressure is reduced in comparison to the Heron chamber at the same compression ratio. 810787. Valve Gear Energy Consumption: Effect of Design and Operation Parameters. Warren B. Armstrong and Bryce A. Buuck, Eaton Corp., Engine Components Div. Valve gear fixture tests have been conducted to determine the torque required to operate the valve gear of various four cylinder engines. The magnitude of these drive torques was used as an indication of the energy con- sumption level for a particular test. Engine speed, oil temperature and valve spring load were test variables subsequently determined to have a major effect on valve gear energy consumption. Cam journal and oil seal losses were also determined to contribute significantly to the total losses within the valve gear. The effects of oil pressure in hydraulic valve gear and different lash values in mechanical valve gear were also evaluated. Although the direct acting valve gear resulted in the lowest losses of those types tested, the different design objectives for each type did not permit a quantitative ranking of their relative efficiencies. Test results have shown that the energy consumption within a valve gear is a complex interplay of many factors including an implied dependence on the presence and quality of the oil film at the cam/follower interface. 810788.

Front Wheel Drive Vehicle Crashworthiness. Enzo Franchini, FIAT Safety Center. An analysis is carried out on the collision behaviour of front engine/front drive (FWD) cars in comparison with the other main types such as: - front engine/rear drive (FE/RD) - rear engine/rear drive (RE/RD) An evaluation is made of the results of standardized collision tests, integrated with non-standardized tests with particular devices. The parameters considered are those typical of defining the deformation law and the forces developed during the collision. Special attention is paid to the modes of structural absorption of energy, the influence of car weight and collision velocity. 810792.

The third section is a study of the vehicle-to-vehicle collision based on current statistics. An effort is made to provide an interpretation of the distribution of accident fatalities in collisions between large and small vehicles. 810793. Modeling and Simulation of Frontal Crash Im- pact Response. Koji Kurimoto, Hirosuke Nakaya and Kazuyuki Okada, Toyo Kogyo Co., Ltd., (Japan). The capability to predict the response of a vehicle body structure to frontal barrier crash is examined by a vehicle model represented by various lumped mass and non-linear resistance systems from that of one dimension with minimal degrees of freedom to these of two dimensions and several degrees of freedom. Comparison between numerical calculation and full scale experiment demonstrates that on even a simple representation, the calculations are in good agreement with the experiment. Several methods of obtaining the resistance characteristics based on full scale experiments and quasi-static component crush testing are also pre- sented. Further, distinctive characteristics and subjects to be considered of front wheel drive vehicle compared with front engine rear wheel drive one on passenger com- partment integrity and occupant restraint performance are discussed. 810795. Advances in LED Display Technology. Mark Greene, Hewlett Packard. Advances in Materials Technology and Packaging Tech- nology have greatly expanded the scope of Light Emitting Diode (LED) display applications. Increases in efficiency have yielded LED displays that are easily readable in direct sunlight. Today's LED display products are light- weight and very compact. They range in form and function from individually encapsulated LED lamps to multidigit dot matrix alphanumeric displays, as well as a wide variety of numeric displays and modules. These features combined with the extremely rugged construction of today's LED displays provide LED display products that are ideally suited for many applications in the automotive and avionics industries. 810796. Safety Performance of a Rear Seat Belt System with Optimized Seat Cushion Design. B. Lun- dell, H. Mellander and I. Carlsson, Volvo Car Corp. A rear seat belt system with a submarining-preventing seat design was developed. The seat has a contoured floor pan with a pronounced ridge at the front end and a seat belt with carefully located attachment points. Sled tests simulating 30 mph barrier crashes were run with both a standard Part 572 dummy and a Part 572 dummy with a modified pelvis. Both dummies had pelvis mounted submarining indicators. Comparative tests were run with a rear seat with a flat floor pan. The tests proved the efficacy of the ridge type seat in preventing submarining as well as giving low injury criteria. The modified pelvis was found to have submarining characteristics slightly different from the Part 572 pelvis. Under certain conditions the submarining indicators were capable of detecting when the lap belt loads the abdomen, but failed in some cases where the pelvis rotation was excessive. 1981 SA E Transactions 810797.

Dynamometer Studies of the Fuel Efficiency Effects of Engine Lubricants Part 1 - Apparatus and Approach. J. Heritage, Burmah-Castrol; S. I. Johnson, Environmental Dynamics, Inc.; and T. W. Selby, Savant, Inc. Studies of four straight-graded oils were made in a constant absolute manifold pressure/constant absolute backpressure engine test served by a rapid oil exchange system. The studies showed that maintaining the engine in continuous operation and exchanging the oils quickly resulted in a sensitive, economical and rapid comparison of engine efficiency. The preliminary results also seemed to give promise that the technique may produce some basic insights into the frictional factors affecting fuel efficiency. 810801. A Study of Lubricating Oil Performance in a Journal Bearing Rig, II. N. Van Os and R. B. Rhodes, Koninklijke/Shell-Laboratorium, Shell Research B.V., (Amsterdam, The Netherlands); and D. F. Covey, Thornton Research Centre, Shell Research Ltd., (England). A journal bearing rig has been used to determine the viscosity of ten multigrade oils under hydrodynamic lubrication conditions at a mean shear rate of 5 X 105 s_1 and a temperature of 150 °C. These conditions closely approximate the shear rate and temperature likely to be encountered when an oil is subjected to severe service in engine bearings. The same rig has been used to study the effect of lubricant viscosity on wear under boundary lubrication conditions at 150 °C. Bearing wear was determined by weighing the bearing shells. The results obtained under static load showed that for single-grade lubricants wear increased markedly with decreasing viscosity. However, for a number of polymer-containing oils including 10W30 and 10W40 multigrades, similar experiments showed that wear was not influenced by high-shear viscosity at least not in the region between 2.1 and 4.9 mPa.s. Attempts to explain this behaviour should take into account an additional contribution to load-bearing capacity from the elastic properties of polymer-containing multigrade oils, or protection of the metal surface by polymer adsorption. 1981 SA E Transactions 810802. The Effect of Silicone Brake Fluid on Rayon Reinforced, Neoprene Tube and Cover Brake Hoses. Richard F. Smith, Dow Corning Corp. Laboratory and field testing of silicone brake fluid, over a period of twelve years, has shown no adverse effects on braking systems while many advantages are apparent. The near complete conversion by the American Automotive Industry, to rayon reinforced, neoprene tube and cover brake hoses caused some concern with the compatibility of silicone fluid and this type hose. Data is presented comparing conventional fluids and silicone fluid and the effect of each on hoses from several manufacturers. 1981 SA E Transactions 810803. Alpine Testing of Silicone Brake Fluids. G. W. Holbrook, Dow Corning Corp. Mountain descents are widely used for brake testing in both the United States and Europe. In order to demon- strate the high temperature capability of silicone-based brake fluids mountain descents, preceded by extensive track testing, were carried out at the Stilfser Joch in northern Italy and the Grossglockner in south central Austria. A Volkswagen Rabbit was used as the test vehicle since its size, weight, engine displacement, and brake system configuration are typical of current and future vehicles. All test requirements were met with ease. The limiting factor was found to be compressibility of the silicone fluid and the ratio of master cylinder displacement to caliper and wheel cylinder volume. The effects of compressibility, although measurable in some braking systems, were found to be significant only at temperatures where a conven- tional fluid in normal use would vapor lock. 1981 SA E Transactions 810804. Compatibility of Silicone-Base Brake Fluids with Automotive Vehicle Elastomers. Charles B. Jor- dan, US Army Material Testing Directorate, 117</page><page sequence="99">810807-810812 Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD. An investigation was conducted to determine the com- patibility of recently specified silicone brake fluids with elastomers expected to be found in vehicles submitted to the US Army for test and evaluation to compare their performance with conventional fluids. More than 1500 immersion tests were conducted at temperatures ranging from 0°F to 248°F (-18 to + 120°C) with 14 different elastomers and 5 different brake fluids. It was found that the silicone brake fluids performed as well as/or better than the conventional fluid in all tests involving vehicle brake system elastomers. Brake performance of systems in which silicone brake fluids and conventional brake fluid become mixed will operate normally with no fluid/elas- tomer related problems. Contaminants such as petroleum based fluids will cause undesirable attacks on brake system elastomers regardless of the fluid in the system. 1981 SA E Transactions 810807. Comparison of Transient Response Test Pro- cedures for Motor Vehicles. M. K. Verma, Engineering Mechanics Dept., General Motors Research Laboratories, Warren, MI; and W. L. Shepard, Current Product Engineering, GM Engineering Staff, GM Milford Proving Ground, Milford, MI. This paper presents a brief description of several test procedures for measuring the transient lateral response characteristics of motor vehicles. The random steering and the step response techniques are studied in detail by being used to evaluate different vehicles. The correlation between the numerics obtained from these two test procedures is investigated. 1981 SA E Transactions 810808. Experimental Examination of Transient Direc- tional Response Tests. Robert L. Nisonger and Paul S. Fancher, Highway Safety Research Institute, The Univ. of Michigan. Four tests for measuring the transient directional response of passenger cars were performed to evaluate their respective merits. The tests examined were (1) ramp-step steer test, (2) reverse steer, (3) lane change (sinusoidal steer), and (4) pseudo-random steer. The results show that each test is capable of contributing useful information concerning the transient directional response of the vehicle in specific operating scenarios. In addition, the findings indicate that no single test provides an accurate means for assessing the results obtained from the other test procedures. Hence a combination of these test procedures is recommended for evaluating the steering response of passenger cars. 1981 tests SA E Transactions 810809. Advanced Automotive Crash Recorder Design Development and Test Analysis. Keith Klaber, National Highway Traffic Safety Administra- tion. Development and testing of an advanced automotive crash recorder system shall be described. The device is biaxial and solid-state and utilizes a special portable data retrieval accessory for data collection in the field. Reliability at low cost, accuracy, and ease of operation were major design goals. The product retains both precrash and postcrash acceleration/time history infor- mation. 810810. Digital Recording of Vehicle Crash Data. Paul G. Fouts, Gerald A. Griggs and Earl J. Holdren, Chrysler Corp. This paper discusses the development and implementation of a 16 channel data acquisition system for high "G" impact testing which includes a self-contained, on-board data acquisition unit, a programmer-exerciser and de- briefing subsystems. The microprocessor controlled, on- board unit contains all signal conditioning, A/D conver- sion hardware and logic to store 4K 12 bit samples of data per channel. This unit will debrief into an oscilloscope, a desk-top computer or a large disk-based minicomputer system. Advantages over previous systems include the elimination of costly hardware (such as umbilical cables and recorders), and a reduction in pre-test preparation and data processing time. 810811. A Microcomputer-Based On-Vehlcle Data Ac- quisition System. R. G. Bowersock, J. F. Dupree and D. T. Bock, Ford Motor Co. A microcomputer-based, multichannel data acquisition system has been developed to acquire high frequency transient information typified by, but not limited to, automotive vehicle crash test applications. The system, which has been designed to be mounted on the test vehicle during a vehicle crash, will accommodate up to 240 channels. Each channel is comprised of a stand-alone microcomputer, memory for data storage, signal condi- tioning for piezoresistive transducers, automatic calibra- tion and zero offsets, and programmable gain amplifier. The microcomputer is based upon a Motorola 6801/68701 microcomputer. The paper describes the design, development, and data processing characteristics of the prototype system. 810812. The Data Acquisition System at the DCIEM Impact Studies Facility. Timothy J. Bowden, James K. Reichert and Jack P. Landolt, Defence and Civil Institute of Environmental Medicine, Downsview, Ontario, Canada. The data acquisition system for impact testing at the Defence and Civil Institute of Environmental Medicine (DCIEM) uses a set of 49 Datalab recorders. Each of these recorders converts an analog transient electrical signal into digital form at sampling rate up to 200 kHz and 118</page><page sequence="100">810813-810823 stores 4096 samples for subsequent transfer to a computer. Data processing and plotting of results, including resul- tants and severity indices, is completed within 40 minutes of a test. The system offers a speed and versatility far superior to alternative systems using analog FM magnetic tape recorders. 810813. Digital and Analog Filters for Processing Impact Test Data. James K. Reichert and Jack P. Landolt, Defence and Civil Institute of Envi- ronmental Medicine, Downsview, Ontario, Can- ada. A set of digital and analog low-pass filters, which meet specific data-processing criteria for impact testing, are described. The design, implementation and performance of thè filters are discussed. These digital filters exhibit finite-impulse- and linear-phase-shift response character- istics. They were designed using the Remez exchange algorithm. The active analog filters, which exhibit a near-linear, phase shift, Bessel response, were developed using commercially-available integrated circuits. These filters have the frequency- and channel-class character- istics advocated by the Society of Automotive Engineers in their publication "S.A.E. Recommended Practice J21 lb, Instrumentation for Impact Tests". 810814. Use of Compacted Graphite Iron in Power Steering Components. Thomas F. Fugiel, Foote Mineral Co.; and Steven E. Clark, R. H. Sheppard Co. The use of compacted graphite iron was initiated as a replacement for the class 30 gray iron previously used for the housing of a power steering unit. The compacted graphite iron housings had greater strength, modulus, and improved surface finish relative to the gray iron housings. This allowed the power steering units to meet the required standards of performance while operating at higher temperature and pressure than previously thought possible. 810816. Weldbonding Aluminum in the Presence of Forming Lubricants. J. Dean Minford, Joining Div., Aluminum Company of America. The effects on weldbond joint strength of varying adherends, adhesives and surface contamination was studied. High strength weldbonds were achieved with the different mill finish aluminum body sheet alloys and the adhesive types most commonly used today in vehicle manufacturing. Acceptable weldbond joint strengths also were achieved in the presence of forming lubricant concentrations that would not be expected to permit good adhesion. 810817. Selection of a Conformai Coating for the General Motors Electronic Control Module. Michael Hasler, Delco Electronics Div., General Motors Corp.; and Bernard VanWert, Dow Corning Corp. This paper discusses the selection of a material to be used as a conformai coating on General Motor's Computer Command Control. Included is background information on conformai coating materials, processing, environmen- tal protection properties, and repairability of the cured material. The resulting cost of a material is a combination of all of the above factors. 810821. Predictions of Combustion, Fuel Economy, and Emission Characteristics Influenced by the Gas Exchange Process of S. I. Engines. Hidenori Tasaka and Shin Matsuoka, Tokyo Institute of Technology. The conflicting problems of fuel economy and NOx emissions in spark ignition engines are discussed in relationship to the residual gas, volumetric efficiency and pumping loss as predicted by the gas exchange analysis which was described in a previous report (SAE P. 800535). Predictions are made of: (1) the optimum valve timing for obtaining maximum volumetric efficiency; (2) the effect of valve timing on the residual gas and intake air charge and their relationships to the power output, fuel economy, and NO emissions; (3) the influence on combustibility and emissions of the main and auxiliary combustion chambers of a stratified charge engine; (4) the effects of the auxiliary intake valve air jet on the combustion of the lean combustion engine; (5) the effect on fuel economy of decreasing the pumping loss by adjusting valve timing and by adding EGR. These applications of the gas exchange calculations indicate the importance of the simulation model in evaluating combustibility, fuel economy, and emission characteristics. 810822. A Study of the Technical and Economic Aspects of Artificially Aging Aluminum Automotive Al- loys. W. H. Hunt, Jr., Alcoa Laboratories, Alcoa Center, PA; and G. H. Willett, Standard Fuel Engineering, Detroit, MI. By utilizing the rapid aging response of 6010 and 6009 auto body sheet alloys to short time-high temperature aging practices, separate aging cycles can be economically utilized for decreasing the cost of aluminum automotive panels. This report details not only the technical basis for these short time aging cycles, but also assesses the comparative costs of automotive panels designed with and without the high strengths that can be achieved through separate artificial aging. The analysis shows that the added costs associated with separate artificial aging are far outweighed by the material cost savings permitted by downgauging. 1981 SAE Transactions 810823. An Engineering Analysis of Thermal Effects in the Concentric-Cylinder High-Shear-Rate Visco- 119</page><page sequence="101">810824-810831 meter. J. C. Wall, Chevron Research Co. Equations describing the temperature distribution and consequent change in cylinder clearance for the concen- tric-cylinder high-shear-rate viscometer are developed. These equations are applied to a Barber-type viscometer for experimental verification. Results demonstrate that temperature profiles and change in cylinder clearance may be accurately calculated using shear stress, angular velocity, and material constants. Parametric studies show that even in the Barber viscometer with symmetric heat flow through rotor and stator, some change in cylinder clearance is observed. Without rotor cooling, reductions in clearance of 30% or more may be observed. 810824. Technical Review of Display Issues in Automotive Environment. P. D. Stokes and J. L. Wenzel, Ford Motor Co., Electrical and Electronics Div.; and J. S. Yun, Ford Motor Co., Electrical and Electronics Div. Electrical and Electronics Div. Over the past several years, many different display technologies have been used in the automobile. Each of technologies have certain advantages and disadvantages when used in the automotive environment. This paper reviews these advantages and disadvantages for the four leading automotive display technologies. The display technologies evaluated include Gas Discharge, Light Emitting Diode, Vacuum Fluorescent and Liquid Crystal. This Paper also includes a review of the automotive environment as it relates to electronic displays. 810826. Ergonomics of Electronic Displays. Gordon R. W. Simmonds, Ford of Britain; Margaret Galer and Ann Baines, Institute for Consumer Ergo- nomics, Univ. of Loughborough, UK. This study has evaluated the effect of several formats of electronic/electro-optical display with emphasis on the speedometer. A total of 400 drivers has participated in laboratory and road trials. These latter were conducted both by day and night over a carefully selected route. Overall, the digital speedometers were read more accurately than circular and curvilinear analogue elec- tronic displays or conventional instruments. The elec- tronic instruments were generally well liked. The most frequent preference was for the digital speedometer, which was considered easy to read and to relate to speed limits. This preference seems strongest for drivers aged over fifty. 1981 SAE Transactions 810827. A Quantitative Analysis of the Effects of Rolls Coupling on Fuel Economy and Emission Levels. Terranee E. Downey, Karen L. Besek and Ishwar S. Parekh, Ford Motor Company. The effect of coupling chassis dynamometer rolls (front to rear) on city and highway fuel economy and emissions was investigated. A representative fleet of ten Ford certification vehicles (five passenger cars and five trucks) was tested in coupled and uncoupled roll configurations. Testing was conducted on a Clayton CTE-50 dynamom- eter with a hydrokinetic power absorption unit (P.A.U.) which was calibrated at a single point (50 mph). It was found that emission levels increased signifi- cantly (95% confidence level) for all constituents except city-NOx, which demonstrated mixed results. Observed fuel economy was reduced for both city and highway (3.6% and 4.0%, respectively, for a combined Metro/High- way (M/H) reduction of 3.8%) when the rolls were coupled. 810828. Road Load Measurement and Dynamometer Simulation Using Coastdown Techniques. C. E. Chapin, General Motors. Reduction of vehicle road load is important in the overall effort to improve fuel economy in motor vehicles. The ability to accurately simulate vehicle road load on a chassis dynamometer is similarly critical in the process of measuring fuel economy on such a dynamometer. This paper discusses coastdown techniques of road load measurement and dynamometer simulation from the standpoint of SAE Recommended Practice J 1263 devel- oped by an SAE Task Force between 1976 and 1979. These techniques are compared to other methods and the equations used to determine the absorber setting which duplicates vehicle road load for a single parameter chassis dynamometer are developed. 1981 SAE Transactions 810830. Inspection and Maintenance for 1981 and Later Model Year Passenger Cars. David W. Hughes, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Inspection and Maintenance (I/M) has been demon- strated to be a practical and effective strategy for reducing the fleetwide emissions of catalyst generation and pre- catalyst generation vehicles An issue that has been the subject of technical discussion is the need for and effectiveness of I/M for the bulk of the 1981 and later model year fleet: those vehicles equipped with closed- loop, three-way catalyst systems. This paper examines both the projected need for I/M for these vehicles as well as the effectiveness of I/M test procedures. Fuel economy considerations are also discussed. 1981 SAE Transactions 810831. Influence on the Relative Motions of Air and Fuel Vapor on the Mixture Formation Processes of the Direct Injection Diesel Engine. Klaus Binder and Walter Hilburger, Daimler-Benz AG, Research Laboratories. Investigations on the relative motion between fuel spray and air in a DI diesel combustion chamber were made on a single cylinder engine with help of the high speed Schlierenfilm technique. 120</page><page sequence="102">810832-810838 The relative motion was varied by changing the air swirl velocity on the one hand and by changing the fuel jet velocity on the other hand. The effect of these different cases of mixture formation and heat release on fuel economy, pressure rise, HC-, CO-, NO- and soot emis- sions was studied on a single cylinder engine with a central 4-hole nozzle. 1981 SA E Transactions 810832. Driver Behaviour During Braking. T. P. New- comb, Reader, Dept. of Transport Technology, University of Technology, Loughborough, Leicestershire, U.K. Data is first presented of how accurately a driver can judge his pedal effort, deceleration, speed, and distance from a stopping point. Typical braking behaviour ob- tained by drivers under controlled conditions is then described, both for car and commercial vehicle drivers and, based on this evidence, a mathematical model is presented for the driver in the braking situation. The simulation study based on that model is discussed with reference to comparative results obtained from road tests. 1981 SA E Transactions 810833. Deregulation and Its Impact on Transportation. Fred H. Tolan and Edward H. Tolan, Tolan, Ekrom and Tolan, Freight Traffic Consultants. This paper describes the future of the rail and motor carrier industries as a result of less government regulation. It deals specifically with the expected impact of the "Motor Carrier Act of 1980" and the "Staggers Rail Act of 1980". It is the authors' belief that the present transition period will give way to a better transportation system than had previously existed. 810834. Realworld Fuel Economy Testing - The Sea to Sea Econorallye II. Forbes W. McRae, Vehicle Research Institute, Western Washington Univ. Eight fuel efficient vehicles traveled across the continental United States in the 1980 Sea-to-Sea Econorallye II. Each vehicle participating in this fuel economy rallye was evaluated in controlled testing for emissions, performance, and economy. In addition, "real-world" fuel economy was measured for each vehicle for the whole of the 6500 kilometer rallye route. The most fuel efficient vehicle in the rallye achieved 2.693 litres per hundred kilometers fuel consumption of diesel fuel (87.3 mpg), while transporting two passengers across the United States. 810835. Viking IV - An 87 mpg Sports Car. Bill Green, Vehicle Research Institute, Western Washington Univ. The Viking IV experimental sports car has achieved an average of 2.693 litres/ 100 kilometers at 88.5 kph (87.32 mpg at 55 mph) in a cross-country economy competition. This mileage is possible because of a radically streamlined body (drag coefficient .30) and a lightweight aluminum structure 630.5 kilograms (1390 lbs.). Viking IV is powered by a 1500 cc turbocharged diesel and meets 1980 emission standards while retaining acceleration (0 to 60 mph in 13 seconds) and top speed [177 kph (110.07 mph)]. 810836. Aerodynamic Redesign with Remanufactured Engine Results in Increased Fuel Efficiency for U-HAUL. Gary Klingaman and Perry LaShier, U-Haul Technical Center. Aerodynamic design improved the mileage figures for U-HAUL's largest fleet truck. Rounded front corners enable the establishment of laminar air flow over the van body top and sides. These corners of 150 mm (6 inch) radius, developed six years prior and currently produced on several smaller trucks and trailers, provided a com- parable mileage improvement with all designs tested. From test data analysis it was determined that, in the U-HAUL environment, aggressive streamlining, to the extent of current technology, provides little practical advantage over the rounded corners. Various other fuel saving devices were investigated; of those explored, none exhibited a significant mileage gain. 810837. Western Michigan University Research Vehicle Gamma. Stephen A. Bruno, Neal E. Hoxsie and Walter Hrynyk, Western Michigan Univ. Discussed in this paper are the aerodynamic features of the Western Michigan University Gamma passenger vehicle. The vehicle was designed and constructed for the 1980 Sea-to-Sea Econorallye II. Incorporated in the design were aerodynamic modifications, with special emphasis on front and rear body shapes. The main objective of the aerodynamic modifications was to reduce the drag coefficient of the vehicle. Methods of analysis were scale model wind tunnel testing and coastdown testing. A series of wind tunnel tests were performed with a l/15th scale detailed model of the prototype. The forces which contribute to the resistance of the motion are discussed. Wind tunnel philosophy, techniques, and assumptions are also discussed. Coastdown tests were performed to determine the drag as measured on the road. The drag coefficient was determined by statistical analysis of the test data. 810838. Technical Features of the Viking V Research Vehicle. Jeffrey L. Vickers, Vehicle Research Institute, Western Washington Univ., Belling- ham, WA. A research vehicle was designed and constructed at the Vehicle Research Institute located at Western Washington University. This car is designed to achieve good per- formance and excellent fuel economy (3.77 litres/ 100 km), using hydrocarbon-based fuels. Testing done at Chrysler exhaust emissions laboratory revealed 0.133 HC G/MI, 121</page><page sequence="103">810839-810847 0.84 CO G/MI, and 1.543 NOX G/MI. Extensive use of aluminum throughout allows low weight (466 kgs) and meets safety requirements using impact absorbing de- formable structures. An intensive aerodynamic design program produced a .30 Cd body shape. This vehicle took second place in the 1980 Sea-to-Sea Econorallye II. 810839. Heavy Truck Safety - The Need to Know. Farrel L. Krall, International Harvester Co.; and Gary W. Rossow, Motor Truck Manufacturers Div., Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association. This paper provides an overview of the current state of knowledge on medium and heavy truck safety and reviews the results of truck safety research sponsored by the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association. A number of issues have been raised about the accident experience of trucks, and the injuries and fatalities sustained by occupants. The diverse viewpoints and perceptions which exist on the reasons for these accidents and what countermeasures should be taken are reviewed. The evolutionary nature of truck accident research is presented, pointing out that sufficient detailed accident and injury data are lacking. Corresponding information on truck configuration, size, weight and exposure data remain inadequate. The role of the vehicle, driver, and highway environment in accident causation must be known and methods to achieve this goal are examined. Despite these limitations, there is progress in under- standing the causes of truck accidents. MVMA-sponsored studies, including those which led to identification of "conspicuity" as an accident avoidance measure, are reviewed. Finally, recommendations for a comprehensive heavy truck accident causation study are presented. 1981 SAE Transactions 810840. A Description of a Computer Controlled Eddy Current Chassis Dynamometer.

The Detection of Emission Related Defects on Future Vehicles - Which Assembly Line Test is Most Effective? J. C. Calhoun, D. A. Drake, G. F. Blass and K. Mirkhani, Environmental Ac- tivities Staff, General Motors Corp.; and E. J. Roelant, Manufacturing Development Staff, General Motors Corp. A test program using thirty production 1980 California "X" cars equipped with Computer Command Control emission control systems was run to compare the emis- sion-related defect detection ability of end-of-line short emission tests and non-emission (or functional) tests. In this comparison, the non-emission tests detected 91% of the defects implanted, while the short emission tests detected only 64% of the defects. Further development of non-emission tests would further improve their defect detection capability, while little can be done to improve the defect detection capability of short emission tests. 1981 SAE Transactions 810845. Boeing 757/767 Commonality Design Philoso- phy. J. E. Klansnic and R. J. Dittenberger, Boeing Commercial Airplane Company. The 757 and 767 airplanes provide maximum common- ality in equipment, flight deck configuration and handling characteristics. Pilots with three-crew ratings will be qualified to fly either airplane with a three-crew require- ment, and those with two-crew ratings will have the same flexibility. In addition to crew qualification, over 80% of the LRUs in the Flight Management System are inter- changeable between similar crew configurations of the 757 and 767, i.e., they have the identical part number. Seventy-five percent of the LRUs are common to both the two- and three-crew configurations. Components that have engine-related software (the Thrust Management and Flight Management Computers) will be interchange- able between 757 and 767 aircraft powered by engines from the same manufacturer. For the operators, this commonality will simplify crew training, reduce main- tenance and support costs, increase opportunities for pooling airplanes between airlines, and reduce dispatch delays due to wider availability of spares. 810846. 757/767 Flight Crew Interface. Robert S. Han- cock, Boeing Commercial Airplane Company. Commonality of flight deck geometry, airplane sybsys- tems, controls and displays, airplane handling charac- teristics and crew procedures between 757/767 offers the potential for common pilot type rating on different airplanes with like crew complement: 2-crew 757/767's and 3-crew 757-767's. 810847. Use of Advanced Technology Structures on Boeing 757/767. Byron L. Reynolds, Boeing Commercial Airplane Co. The usage of advanced technology structures has been a significant part of the success of the Boeing 757/767 mid range airplanes. Extensive use of kevlar, graphite/epoxy, high purity aluminum, powder metallurgy, titanium and metal bonding has reduced the weight of some structural components as much as 28%. New technology in materials and structures have been combined with new aerody- namics, propulsions and systems which resulted in a reduction in fuel burn that is as much as 40% below many of the aircraft in commercial fleets today. 122</page><page sequence="104">810848-810853 810848. (SP-492) A Short History of Aviation Gasoline Development, 1903 - 1980. Alexander R. Ogston, Exxon International. The paper covers over fifty years of aviation gasoline development, beginning with a description of the Wright Brothers' 12 horsepower engine and their use of below 40 octane gasoline. Early investigations of the detonation phenomenon are described and the means developed to suppress knock by improving fuel quality. Why the Rolls-Royce Merlin engine of the RAF Spitfire was found to require a special 100 octane fuel for the Battle of Britain is explained. The importance of the alkylation process is described. The vast volume of 100 octane fuel required for the Allied air forces in World War II could not have been produced without the alkylation process. 1981 SAE Transactions 810849. (SP-492) A History of Aircraft Piston Engine Lubricants. Robert V. Kerley This paper is a review of the literature covering the history of the use of lubricants. The uses of oils derived from animals, vegetables and minerals are placed in perspective from ancient times to the Wright Brothers' flight in 1903. After that period, the discussion is confined largely to the lubrication of aircraft piston engines. The paper attempts to explain the preference for castor oil in European and British engines and the more general, but by no means exclusive, use of petroleum-based mineral oils in the United States. The British Air Ministry, in 1929, reached a decision to abandon castor oil due to availability and cost of petroleum-based oils. The simultaneous U.S. Army Air Corps recognition of the advantages of the very flat viscosity-temperature curve of Pennsylvania oils for hot running engines and for cold starting led to the world- wide use of these lubricating oils. The background for the continued, and often con- troversial use of straight mineral oil, some of the additives used, tests of synthetic oil in winter use, and oil reclamation are reviewed through World War II until 1963 when lubricating oils containing ashless additives became the prodominant products. 1981 SA E Transactions 810850. (SP-492) Aviation Turbine Fuel Properties and Their Trends. Robert Friedman, NASA Lewis Research Center. This paper is an examination of published Jet A inspection data covering selected property distributions, averages, and trends for the period from 1969 to 1979. Yearly median values of aromatics, mercaptan sulfur content, 10-percent distillation temperature, smoke point, and freezing point are changing with time, approaching their specification limit values, particularly in the last three years. A near-specification property is defined as one within a stated tolerance band around the speci- fication limit. On this basis, most fuel samples have one to three near-specification properties, the most common being aromatics, smoke point, and freezing point. 810851. (SP-492) The History of Aviation Turbine Lu- bricants. Ray Knipple and John Thich, Royal Lubricants Co., Inc., Royal Dutch/Shell. Condensed in this report are the salient points of the forty year history of the development of the gas turbine engine, its associated aircraft and the various lubricants used. Tables are included comparing some of the important specification properties of many of these fluids, both petroleum and synthetics. An explanation is incorporated outlining the reasons synthetics perform well in the turbine engine environment. A geneological chart detail- ing the various dates on which lubricant specifications or important changes were issued is provided. There are indications that some commercially avail- able lubricants are being stressed to the limits of the fluids capabilities. Any new engine designs, therefore, may require entirely new lubricants and/or new lubrication systems. 1981 SA E Transactions 810852. (P-94) Noise Reduction of Heavy-Duty Trucks. Erich K. Bender, Robert L. Bronsdon and Paul J. Remington, Bolt Beranek and Newman Inc., Cambridge, MA. This paper describes the development of noise control treatments for two heavy-duty diesel trucks. Noise levels are reduced to 72 dBA when measured according to the SAE J366b Recommended Practice. The treatments, comprising primary dual exhaust systems and partial engine enclosures, reduce exhaust back pressures by 0.3 to 0.4 in. Hg and add about 2 1/2 percent to the tractor weights. Cooling tests show that engine oil, engine coolant, and air-to-boil temperatures meet manufacturers' specifications. Maintenance studies indicate that about 5 min is required to remove and replace three key access panels. 1981 SAE Transactions 810853.

(P-94) Current and Future Status of Motor Vehicle Noise Regulation in the Province of British Columbia, Canada. Douglas S. Kennedy, Hartford, Kennedy, Wakefield Ltd., Acoustical Consultants, Vancouver, B.C., Canada. Over the past six years, government inspection stations in British Columbia have been regularly conducting indoor vehicle noise measurements in order to enforce motor vehicle noise regulations. The program has worked well logistically but certain improvements in measurement procedures are currently being considered with the intent of making these procedures more consistent with recently developed national and international standards. It is hoped that prior to presentation of this paper at the 1981 SAE West Coast International Meeting, a quantitative assessment of past effectiveness and an assessment of proposed improvements will have been completed. 810861. (P-94) Ship Silencing Program. K. A. Tobin, Tracor, Inc. The U. S. Navy has long had a program to quiet ships to improve their combat effectiveness. The trucking industry has various on-going programs to reduce truck noise to meet various regulations, reduce operator fatigue and possible hearing loss, decrease community noise and annoyance, and improve operator recognition of warning signals. Although the two programs are vastly different in their basic motivation, dominant noise sources, frequen- cies of interest, receiver processing, and sound trans- mission medium, the methodology should be fundamen- tally similar. This paper, which reflects the views and experience of the author, describes the overall program, disciplines, and general approach used to quiet ships and, hopefully, will stimulate ideas from those engaged in reducing truck noise. 810865. A Comprehensive Simulation of High Speed Driven Valve Trains. Kishiro Akiba and Akira Shimizu, Isuzu Motors Ltd. (Japan); and Hiroshi Sakai, Univ. of Tokyo. The engine's inevitable trend to higher output and speed has improved a lot of perplexing problems to be solved in valve gear design. Among all these problems, in modern engines, valve linkage separation has grown to be of 124</page><page sequence="106">810900-810904 particular interest, since the engine's great reliability at operation beyond the rated speed has come to be the first requirement. Thus valve 'jump' and valve 'bounce' are now not the valve linkage separation phenomena that might occur beyond the maximum engine speed, but those that should be expected within the speed ranges where the engines are driven with a considerable probability. This paper deals with the new simulation model, basically composed of a double mass system, which is conceived for sound reflection of such intricate valve train behaviors at the higher speed range of operation. Thor- ough validity of the proposed model has been confirmed by experimental investigation in which a minute obser- vation of valve linkage separation as well as the behaviors of each component of the valve train was made. The new simulation will make it possible at the design stage to forecast the valve gear behaviors at high-speed operation, which in due course will make it easier to carry out the swift and reasonable design of the valve train for greater reliability and durability of the engines to be put into production. 810900. (SP-496) Radar/Microprocessor Measurement System for Near-Zero Speeds and Vehicle Dy- namics. Martin E. Smirlock, Foster-Miller As- sociates, Inc., Waltham, MA. A novel instrumentation system has been developed which enables simple, quick, and accurate measurement of vehicular dynamics within low speed ranges. The system, consisting of a microwave transceiver and microprocessor data acquisition and reduction system, measures the deceleration dynamics of low speed mining and con- struction equipment. It makes the basic measurement, calculates key parameters such as average deceleration, initial velocity, stopping distance, brake system delay time, and produces auto-scaled graphs of velocity, acceleration, and displacement versus time. 1981 SA E Transactions 810901. (SP-496) Electronic Control for Construction Machinery. Yoshihei Masai, Electro-Technical Research Center, Komatsu Ltd.; and Masahiro Watanabe, Kawasaki Plant, Komatsu Ltd. Recently, application of electronics to construction machinery has proceeded rapidly. And various electronic control systems have been developed for off-highway dump truck. In this paper, we explain an automatic retarder control system, as an example of effective use of on-board computers. This system controls the cruising speed at a constant set value while monitoring the brake's cooling oil temperature. Two of the most important functions of this system is prevention of brake trouble, and fine speed control. The former is automatic restriction of maximum descending speed by feeding information of brake's cooling oil temperature into the logic control unit. The latter is an adaptive control of brake force under various operating conditions. This control system was equipped to our newly developed dump truck, HD1600M-one of our exhibits at CONEXPO '81. 1981 SA E Transactions 810903. (SP-496) An On-Board Microprocessor-Based Data Processor/Recorder. Herbert C. Johnson, Electro/General Corp., Minnetonka, MN. The advent of microelectronics, and specifically the microcomputer, has opened up field data collection to include long-term untended applications not previously possible. This paper touches upon two of several field data collection possibilities-load data analysis and fatigue life estimation-and describes typical uses for each. In load data analysis, test engineers are basically interested in determining how their equipment reacts to field forces. This gives them an invaluable data base for future designs. In fatigue life estimation the emphasis is on the life span of critical components in field operation. Time correlation is unimportant in the algorithm which moni- tors stress-strain response of a material to external forcing. By a process of summation the percentage of fatigue life consumed during the test can be determined. Spiraling costs of doing business, keener competition and costly regulations all combine to underscore the growing need for long-term, untended field data collec- tion. Increasingly, microelectronic technology will bring more capability to this extension of an old engineering discipline. 810904. Waukesha-Dresser Industries New VR220/330 Series Engines. J. R.

The new VR220/330 series engines have been created to modernize the division's Mobile Equipment, Industrial Power Unit, and Enginator Capability through the power range from 50 to 150 BHP. The design concept which followed was to make a family of engines having a good balance between Reliability, Cost of Manufacturing, Application Ease, Serviceability, and Engine Perform- ance. The new VR220/330 series is a refinement of an earlier VR engine family manufactured at Waukesha. Features have been developed to meet the demands of the Mobile Equipment and Industrial Engine Markets. The VR220/330 engine series has a 3.875" bore, 4.665" stroke for a displacement of 55 cu. in./cylinder. The engine family consists of 4 and 6 cylinder Gasoline, Gaseous, Diesel, and Diesel Turbocharged models. The engine family was designed to utilize some existing tooling, along with currently accepted foundry techniques, and engine technology. Family concepts emphasized interchangeability between fuel types, and maximized commonality of internal and external engine parts for cost 125</page><page sequence="107">810905-810913 effectiveness, as well as simplifying service and main- tenance. The paper is divided into 3 sections emphasizing Engine History, Design Section, and Development Pro- gram. Engine History covers the initial approach and rationale for the VR220/330 family. Design Section covers design philosophy used on major engine components and features.

Sections on selected major engine parts will be included to project an image of the engine and to illustrate design features and specific solutions. 810908. (SP-497) Application of a Hydraulic Clutch to a Highway Maintenance Vehicle. Robert A. Ban- ner, The Fauver Co. In the past the fuel efficiency of many vehicles has been adversely affected by the unnecessary parasitic horse- power losses incurred by line driven hydraulic pumps when pump capacity is not required. This paper describes the application of an Ausco hydraulically actuated multiple disc clutch to the main system pump on a highway maintenance vehicle. The described clutch system was prototyped on an Iowa Department of Transportation road maintenance truck in the fall of 1980. This paper outlines the basic system concept, hydrau- lic circuit for clutch actuation, design and procurement problems, preliminary fuel economy improvement and alternate clutch actuating concepts. 810909.

The First Annual Blizzard Baja. James P. Baileys, Timothy J. Hinds, Phillip E. Roll and Lawrence W. Evers, Michigan Technological Univ. The First Annual Blizzard Baja was hosted by Michigan Technological University's SAE Student Branch on February 7, 1981. This was a competition between student designed vehicles which had previously competed in summer Baja events. The Blizzard Baja consisted of a one hour endurance race run on ice and snow. The purpose was to provide the student engineers an opportunity to test their vehicles in cold weather, snow and icy condi- tions. 810918. Design for the Super Mileage Competition. J. Pierre Crevier, Michael H. Schupan, James H. Wiegand and Raymond W. Kauppila, Michigan Technological Univ. Twenty vehicles from eighteen schools competed in the Second SAE Super Mileage Competition at the Eaton Proving Grounds, Marshall, Michigan, on June 6, 1981. Of these, fifteen completed all of the events with the winner obtaining 702 miles/gallon (298.4 KM/liter). The designs of the successful vehicles were quite varied but stressed lightness, aerodynamic streamlining, low rolling resistance and efficient drive trains. Some engines were also modified to improve efficiency. The integrated optimization of all variables within the severe constraints of budget, manpower, time and manufacturing facilities presented an excellent engineering experience for the students. 810919. Car Drivers - What Can You Do to Conserve Fuel? Philip Barry Hertz, Univ. of Saskat- chewan, Saskatoon, Sask. (Canada). The OPEC oil embargo of 1973 followed by more stringent EPA exhaust pollution limits precipitated the current Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) Stan- dards which automobile manufacturers are struggling to meet. As energy supplies become more scarce, it is of extreme importance for drivers to understand and take advantage of the factors affecting high fuel economy. This paper explains the three major pillars of high fuel economy, namely: low vehicle resistance, high fuel energy content, and high overall system efficiency. Based on an understanding of these factors, the driver is better equipped to select an energy conserving vehicle, employ economy maintenance procedures, and learn economy driving practices. The winning University of Saskat- chewan Super Mileage Vehicles are briefly cited as extreme examples of the application of these principles with above 700 miles per gallon achieved during compe- tition. Methods are indicated whereby drivers are readily capable of reducing their automobile energy consumption by at least one-half. 810920. A Comparison of the Transient Response of Two and Four Stroke Diesel Powered Generator Sets. T. R. Lalk, Department of Mechanical Engi- neering, Texas A&amp;M Univ.; and K. R. Willett, Woodward Governor Co. The response of two and four-stroke diesel powered electric generator sets to transient loading was investi- gated. The effects of addition and removal of load on generator output voltage and frequency were determined for comparison of the transient response characteristics of two-stroke diesel-generator sets operating at 1200 and 1800 rpm, and a four-stroke diesel-generator set operating at 1800 rpm. Three engine-generator sets of approximately 55 KWC capacity, representing a cross-section of the many available, were connected to a load cell used to in- stantaneously change the load on the diesel generators. Instrumentation was provided to record output frequency and voltage, electric power, and instant of load change (current monitor). Maximum steady state load was established for each engine-generator set, and the load was changed in increments of this maximum, from various steady state base loads. The time required for the frequency to return to steady state, and the magnitude of the maximum frequency deviation resulting from a load 127</page><page sequence="109">810921-810924 change were determined, and compared for the three generator sets. The response time (time to return to frequency stability following a load change) was found to be the shortest for the 1800 rpm two-stroke generator set, and longest for the 1800 rpm four-stroke set, with the response of the lower speed two-stroke set in between. The response time of the four-stroke set was two to three times as long as that of the generator sets equipped with two-stroke engines. Response times for all the generator sets increased, as the magnitude of the load change increased, up to a point, and thereafter remained relatively constant with load change. The relationship among the generator sets' response times held over the entire range of load additions and removals, as well as for all base loads from which the load changes were initiated. Maximum frequency deviations resulting from a load change were dependent upon the response rates of the engines' governors, and were determined to increase linearly with the magnitude of load change. The low speed (1200 rpm) two-stroke generator set experienced the largest frequency deviations, whereas the deviations of the other two sets were approximately the same with the high speed (1800 rpm) two-stroke having a slight advantage. Output voltage deviations resulting from a load change were found to be negligible over the entire range of base loads and load changes investigated. 810921. Combustion Characteristics of Small Spark Ig- nition Engines Using Hydrogen Supplemented Fuel Mixtures. K. S. Varde, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, Univ. of Michigan-Dearborn. Small industrial type spark ignition engines are generally designed to operate on rich fuel-air mixtures. Although improvement in fuel economy can be expected with lean mixtures problems associated with such mixture operation prohibit the use of too lean mixtures in these engines. However, it is possible to achieve satisfactory engine performance when small amount of fuel having very lean flammability limit is added to lean gasoline-air mixture. Since hydrogen has wide flammability limits, an exper- imental study was conducted to study engine performance and combustion characteristics of hydrogen supplemented mixtures in a small spark ignition engine. The results of the study showed: 1) flame speeds with hydrogen supplemented mixture were higher particularly in lean mixture region, 2) the engine could be run on lean air-fuel ratios where operation without hydrogen sup- plementation was not possible. There was overall increase in engine efficiency and reduction in cyclic pressure variations. 810922. Improvement of Two-Stroke Engine Performance with the Yamaha Power Valve System (YPVS). Noriyuki Hata and Toshimitsu lio, Yamaha Motor Co., Ltd. In two-stroke engines, the exhaust port timing has a great effect on engine performance characteristics. If the exhaust port timing can be varied in response to variations in the engine speed, an extensive improvement of performance can be realized. The Yamaha Power Valve System (YPVS) increases engine output with a valve which operates in the exhaust passage; this valve controls exhaust port timing in response to engine speed, despite the extremely high thermal load encountered in the exhaust passage. This literature deals with the construction and operation principles of YPVS and its effect on the increase of engine output. Also discussed is a series of tests and measure- ments made on the delivery ratio and trapping efficiency in order to elucidate why engine output is increased. 1981 SA E Transactions 810923. Modification of Two-Stroke Engine Intake Sys- tem for Improvements of Fuel Consumption and Performance through the Yamaha Energy Induc- tion System (YEIS). Noriyuki Hata, Takeo Fujita and Noritaka Matsuo, Yamaha Motor Co., Ltd. The recent trend of two-stroke gasoline engines indicates that engine power has been ever-increasing. With this trend, new problems have often arisen; that is, there is an area where both engine performance and fuel economy become worse at part-throttle operation. This phenom- enon is called the "trough of torque", and a solution of these problems has been one of the major subjects of two-stroke engine research and development. This literature discusses the Yamaha Energy Induc- tion System (YEIS), a simple modification of the intake system that has successfully eliminated the trough of torque; thus both engine performance and fuel economy have been greatly improved. It also discusses the construction and operation of the YEIS, as well as its effect on engine performance and fuel consumption. A large space of this literature is dedicated to the elucidation of the YEIS and the confirmation of improved fuel economy through the mode operation of the YEIS engine. 1981 SA E Transactions 810924.

(Hiratsuka/Japan). An entirely new crawler has been developed based on analysis of how better traction with less travel reduction can be achieved for a crawler tractor. Tractive per- formance is considerably improved on rock or other hard surfaces. The new crawler shows 30% higher traction at only 5% reduction in travel compared with less traction and more travel reduction (20 to 100% slip ratio) for a conventional crawler tractor, on a concrete surface. In addition, ride is more comfortable and there is less noise from the undercarriage. 810926. The Caterpillar 966D Wheel Loader. Robert E. Evenson, Caterpillar Tractor Co.

An analysis, based on laboratory results, provides estimated energy and dollar savings during an example system's life. Projected energy costs are combined with unit prices to provide life cycle cost comparisons. 1981 SA E Transactions 810928. (SP-497) Agricultural Tractor Hydraulic Power Use. Ron Burk, John Deere Product Engineering Center, Waterloo, I A. A comprehensive test program was conducted to deter- mine hydraulic power usage of an agricultural tractor in actual field operation.

(SP-494) Effect of Cylinder Liner Wear on Oil Consumption in Heavy Duty Diesel Engines. Y. Ishizuki, F. Sato and K. Takase, Engine Tech- nical Center, Komatsu Ltd., Japan. Abnormal cylinder liner wear is the cause of the gradual increase in lube oil consumption in diesel engines. The mechanism of the cylinder liner wear was examined using an L-link piston motion measurement device, and the carbon deposit buildup on the top land of the piston was found to be the cause of the wear. Piston top land cutback was proven theoretically and practically to be a useful tool to prevent wear. Other factors also influencing the wear were taken into consideration in view of the severe demands of future engines. 1981 SA E Transactions 810932.

A range of piston and ring features influencing blow-by are summarized and dis- cussed, and engine test results demonstrating the effect of some of these are featured. 1981 SA E Transactions 810933. (SP-494) New Design Methods for Pistons. Peter Reipert and Rolf Buchta, Karl Schmidt GmbH. The paper describes the details of an interactive piston development program (C.A.E.), especially its new meth- ods of piston design in relationship to oil consumption and blow-by. Based on a library of emperical design standards the preliminary design scheme of a piston is carried out interactively. The drawing is generated automatically by the computer. The design process will be continued by a cycle simulation providing all gas related data, such as heat transfer coefficients, temperature and pressure of gas at each crank angle. Using an interactive preprocessor the engineer creates economically by direct communication a three dimensional mesh for Finite Element (F.E.) calculation. For two truck diesel engine pistons detailed results from the F.E. program are presented. After modification and additions relating to the particular engine the computer produces the prototype drawing. 129</page><page sequence="111">810934-810941 810934. (SP-494) Piston Ring Development - Trends in Europe for Off-Highway Applications. G. E. Dueck, Goetze AG (Germany); and Brian A. Newman, Muskegon Piston Ring Co. Dramatic increases in fuel and lubricant costs together with longer life expectancy and significantly higher power ratings through turbocharging have led to priorities in engine development over the last eight years which place high demands on piston rings. These demands include: Better sealing (low blow-by) Improved oil scraping (increased oil economy) Less friction (reduced fuel consumption) Lower wear rates (longer engine life) Faster and more reliable running-in (reduced pro- duction costs). Modified edge designs on compression rings guarantee low blow-by. A special lapping process for chrome plated rings increases scuff resistance and reduces running-in time. Oil scraper rings with extremely narrow lands manufactured to very fine tolerances by profile grinding permit the use of low tangential loads for reduced friction. The use of such ring designs in European diesel engines is proving successful. 1981 SAE Transactions 810935. (SP-494) Piston Ring Dynamics and Its Influence on the Power Cylinder Performance. John M. Curtis, International Harvester Co., Engine Div., Components Group. The motion of the top and second piston rings and pressures at the top land and intermediate land were recorded in an operating single cylinder engine. The parameters were measured on a tight top land piston (close clearance), cutback top land piston (wide clearance) and an IH balanced pressure piston. Each piston design was evaluated with two different second ring end clearances and at two different speeds. Test results are evaluated and discussed. 1981 SAE Transactions 810937. (SP-494) Oil Consumption and Biowhy of Truck Diesel Engines - Test Bench Results. Jürgen Ellermann, Manfred D. Röhrle and Herbert Schelling, MAHLE GMBH (Stuttgart/West Germany). The paper presents test bench results concerning oil consumption and blowby of current truck diesel engines. The influence of design factors is demonstrated and the understanding of correlations between oil consumption and blowby related to design modifications is explained. With the results gained, it is pointed out that significant reductions in oil consumption figures are achievable by adaptation of pistons and piston rings to individual engine requirements. Increases in oil consumption caused by deterioration of components, as for instance cylinder liner geometry, related to insufficient crankcase-rigidity, are described. All measures stated are in serial application of current truck diesel engines. 1981 SAE Transactions 810939. (SP-496) Applying Microprocessors to Off-High- way Vehicles. Martin Kenney, Grad-Line, Inc. Using microprocessors for system monitoring and control on off-highway vehicles is a relatively new technique that has brought with it a new set of design problems. Among these challenges are those that relate to safety and system reliability which can only be overcome through thorough system specification and creative hardware/software design. 1981 SAE Transactions 810940. (SP-496) Development of a Microprocessor- Based Steering Controller for an Over-the-Row Apple Harvester. B. L. Upchurch, Sperry Re- search Center, Sudbury, MA; B. R. Tennes, U.S. Dept. of Agriculture, Agricultural Research; and T. C. Surbrook, Agricultural Engineering Dept., Michigan State Univ. In order to provide a machine with a better maneuver- ability, a microprocessor-based steering controller was designed and developed for an over-the-row apple harvester. The controller allowed the machine operator to select any one of the five steering modes which were: (1) auto-steer, (2) front only, (3) four way, (4) crab, and (5) rear only. Upon recognizing the selected steering mode, the controller executed the appropriate algorithm which performed the necessary wheel position control. As a part of the controller, absolute shaft encoders were designed. The encoders were used to sense the position of the wheels and the tree sensor arms. In each steering mode except auto-steer, the tracking ability of the rear wheels was determined. For the auto-steer mode, the ability of the apple harvester to remain centered over a tree row while moving over the row was evaluated. 1981 SAE Transactions 810941. (SP-496) The Development and Application of Electro-Hydraulic Control System for Case 4WD Tractors. Robert Dobrinska, J I Case Company; and Richard Jarboe, Cessna Fluid Power Div. The primary considerations taken into account in the development and application of an electro-hydraulic control system to an agricultural tractor are reliability, durability, safety and value. The value factor being defined as function as it relates to economics. All the aforementioned factors were taken into consideration in this project. In addition, the system provides minimum operator input and maximum system flexibility. The application of a system to an Ag tractor requires the consideration of the environmental variables in which the tractor must function. 1981 SAE Transactions 130</page><page sequence="112">810942-810953 810942. Programs of the Fluid Power Educational Foun- dation. John J. Pippenger, Fluid Power Edu- cation Foundation. Systematic training and credentialling would benefit the fluid power industry by providing a skilled and certified labor force. Effective training and certification programs are built upon a logically organized and validated list of occupational competencies. In this text, occupational competencies are defined as tasks for which the specific skills and knowledge can be identified. Validation means that they have been critically reviewed and accepted by the industry and profession. Training and certification programs are now being conducted by schools, profes- sional organizations throughout the industry without a validated list of occupational competencies for several recognized job titles. It is anticipated that the project will be completed in three phases over five years. 810944. Fluid Power Education in Agricultural Engi- neering Curricula. Tobi Goldoftas, Hydraulics &amp; Pneumatics Magazine, Cleveland, OH. Based on a survey he conducted, the author learned that the subject matter of hydraulics (such as is used in mobile equipment) is being taught in the Agricultural Engineering Departments of some universities in the United States, but the level of instruction, however, is not uniform among the various universities. The author suggests that instruction in hydraulics be (1) extended available to all universities and (2) that since virtually all mobile machinery made today is equipped with some hydraulics, that a course in this technology be required of all Agricultural Engineering students who elect the Power &amp; Machinery option. 810945.

Sturges, Rockford Div., Borg Warner Corp. In the never-ending quest of increased productivity, new methods of controlling gear and directional shifts in power-shift transmission-equipped vehicles are becoming desirable. Due to increased vehicle engine power, in- creased vehicle speeds, increased loads and shorter cycle times, currently used clutch shift modulation devices are not able to provide optimum clutch engagements under the variety of vehicle operational conditions encountered. This paper describes an electronic system developed for providing optimum clutch engagement control under any given vehicle operational condition. A description of clutch hardware, valving, torque and speed transducer, together with measuring and display devices monitoring vehicle performance, and representative test data are included. 1981 SAE Transactions 810950.

(SP-495) The Effects of Fuel Properties and Composition on Diesel Engine Exhaust Emis- sions - A Review. Thomas W. Ryan, III, John O. Storment and B. R. Wright, Energy Systems 131</page><page sequence="113">810954-810960 Research Div., Southwest Research Institute, San Antonio, TX; and Robert Waytulonis, Twin Cities Mining Research Center, U.S. Bureau of Mines, Minneapolis, MN. Due to the cost and mobility advantages of diesel- powered mine vehicles over electric vehicles, it is antic- ipated that the diesel engine will become more widely used in underground mines in this country. Concern has arisen, however, over the impact of diesel exhaust emissions on the air quality in the underground mine environment. A literature search has been conducted to identify known effects of fuel properties on the reduction of diesel exhaust emissions. Reductions can be obtained by optimizing fuel properties and by considering alternative fuels to standard diesel fuel. However, the data base is relatively small and the results highly dependent on engine type and operating conditions. Engine studies on a typical mine diesel are necessary to draw quantitative conclusions regarding the reduction of emissions, especially partic- ulates and N02 which have not been generally addressed in previous studies. 810954. (SP-495) Control of Diesel Exhaust Emissions in Underground Coal Mines - Single Cylinder En- gine Experiments with Modified and Non-Con- ventional Fuels. Glenn B. O'Neal and John O. Storment, Southwest Research Institute; and Robert W. Waytulonis, Twin Cities Research Center, Bureau of Mines. Because the diesel engine is becoming an increasingly attractive power plant for use in underground mines, concern arises about exhaust emission levels in this environment. The effects of fuel properties and compo- sition on emissions of particulate matter, oxides of nitrogen, unburned hydrocarbons, and carbon monoxide were investigated in this study. Fuels and fuel blends evaluated included DF-1, DF-2, and JP-7; a solution and an emulsion of ethanol with DF-2; emulsions and fumigation of water with DF-2; and LPG with DF-2 pilot injection. All tests were performed on a diesel engine (Caterpillar 3304) representative of underground mining equipment. A micro-emulsion of water in DF-2 proved to be the most attractive fuel based upon availability, reduction of particulates and oxides of nitrogen, and inherent fire-safe characteristics. 810955. (SP-495) Performance and Emissions Charac- teristics of a Naturally Aspirated Diesel Engine with Vegetable Oil Fuels- (Part 2). A. L. Humke and N. J. Barsic, John Deere Product Engi- neering Center. A naturally aspirated, direct injected diesel engine was used to evaluate the performance and emissions char- acteristics of a crude soybean oil, a 50 percent (by volume) mixture of crude soybean oil and #2 diesel fuel, and a degummed soybean oil. The data were compared with previous tests conducted on the same engine using #2 diesel fuel, crude sunflower oil and a 50 percent mixture of crude sunflower oil and #2 diesel fuel. 1981 SA E Transactions 810956. (SP-495) Experimental Evaluation of Fibrous Filters for Trapping Diesel-Exhaust Particulates. J. Scott MacDonald and Gerald L. Vaneman, General Motors Research Laboratories, General Motors Corp., Warren, MI. A test apparatus containing two raw-gas particulate sampling systems was designed and developed to deter- mine accurately the performance of various materials as diesel exhaust particulate filters. This apparatus was used in conjunction with a single-cylinder diesel engine and a series of fibrous filters to quantify experimentally the effects of filter face area, filter thickness, packing density and fiber diameter on filter performance. Time-dependent efficiency measurements made with this system were smooth and consistent for all of the filters tested and correctly reflected the changes made in these key trap parameters. In all cases, the collection efficiency of the filters increased during the first hour of operation and then reached a relatively constant level. The pressure drop across the filters increased continuously as particulate material accumulated on the filters. Particulate size- distribution measurements made upstream and down- stream of an exhaust filter showed that the smallest exhaust particles were more efficiently captured than the larger particles. 810959. (SP-495) The Distribution of Heat Rejection from a Single-Cylinder Divided-Chamber Diesel Engine. A. C. Alkidas and R. M. Cole, Engine Research Dept., General Motors Research Lab- oratories, Warren, MI. The effects of engine speed, load, and injection timing on the distribution of heat rejection to the coolant were examined in a single-cylinder divided-chamber diesel engine. The cooling system was separated into four zones: cylinder liner, intake port, exhaust port, and ante- chamber. The fractions of the total amount of heat rejected to the coolant from the four cooling zones were moderately affected by load and injection timing, but were not affected by engine speed. Typical values of these fractions are: cylinder liner - 53 %, exhaust port - 22%, antechamber - 18%, and intake port - 7%. The total amount of heat rejected to the coolant increased with engine speed and load; injection timing had a smaller but significant effect. Finally, the heat rejected to each cooling zone was correlated with the rate of fuel consumption. 1981 SA E Transactions 810960.

Alternative plans such as engine substitution and multi-level emission limits were studied. 810961. Experience in French Coal Mines with Fire- Resistant Fluids. Guy Blanpain, CERCHAR. The development of hydraulic transmissions has resulted in an increased consumption of hydraulic fluids. In the French Coal Mines, mineral oil which still remains the most effective hydraulic fluid is still applied underground because there is no mandatory regulation prohibiting its use. Mine operators have substituted fire-resistant hy- draulic fluids in those applications where ignition hazards are greatest; such fluids were introduced underground after being subjected to tests and controls based on precise recommendations of the Permanent Committee for Safety and Health in the Coal Mining Industry. Because of their simplicity of design, hydraulic couplings were adapted to use of non aqueous hydraulic fluids. Powered supports and some unsophisticated equip- ment are operated with soluble oil in water emulsions. Most equipment has been converted for using polyglycol solutions. The equipment still using mineral oil will either gradually be replaced by new equipment specially de- signed to operate with fire resistant fluids or modified accordingly. The final objective is to increase safety conditions underground while permitting normal pro- ductivity of operation. 1981 SAE Transactions 810962. Experience with the Testing and Application of Fire-Resistant Fluids in the National Coal Board. G. C. Knight, Rotary Testing Branch, National Coal Board, Mining Research and Development Establishment (United Kingdom). The paper describes the factors leading to the National Coal Board's decision to maximise the use of fire-resistant fluids in underground mines. The criteria of acceptability of fluids with respect to fire resistance, toxicity and technological properties are described. Experiences with the laboratory testing of pumps and motors are discussed together with the filtration require- ments for the satisfactory operation of systems. The application of fluids to achieve the successful operation of powered roof supports, hydrostatic and hydrokinetic transmissions is reviewed and details are given of the extent of the NCB's present commitment to the use of fire-resistant fluids. 1981 SAE Transactions 810963. Preparing for the Future of Fire Resistant Hydraulic Fluids. F. D. Norvelle, Fluid Power Research Center, Oklahoma State Univ. The use of fire resistant fluids in the fluid power industry is increasing for a number of factors - both economic and regulatory. These fluids, in general, have performance and other characteristics which are inferior to mineral base fluids. Efforts are being made to either improve these characteristics or compensate for them. Several of these efforts are described in this paper. 1981 SAE Transactions 810964. Pump Performance on High Water Based Fluid. D. G. Wymer, Chamber of Mines of South Africa, Research Organisation. Performance data for pumps operating on high water based fluids under both laboratory and mining conditions are presented. Of the various factors affecting pump life, the effect of fluid contamination is shown to be partic- ularly critical. Preliminary results indicate that replace- ment of conventional oil-in-water emulsions by chemical solutions and/or microemulsions could be one of several ways in which the lives of pumps operating in the mining environment might be significantly extended. 1981 SAE Transactions 810966. Reaction Injection Molding for Large Compo- nents. Jerry V. Scrivo, Hamill Manufacturing Div., Firestone, Romeo, Mich. The reaction injection molding process can be charac- terized as a low pressure (in-situ) process which is energy efficient, requires moderate capital and tooling. It was originally developed by suppliers of the automotive industry, which remains its largest market. Application of the process to other products, which initially lagged, is now in a growth phase. Recent installation of facilities for molding very large parts provides a new resource and challenge to develop innovative applications. 1981 SAE Transactions 810967. Effective Use of Composites.

Neil Anderson, Rogers Corp. High performance polyimide polymers have increasingly replaced metal parts in off-road and automotive equip- ment. Known for excellent properties at high temperature, load and speed, polyimides have proven their effectiveness in sealing and bearing applications. Their inherent strength allows polyimides to operate as bearings at very high pressure-velocity (PV) factors. Non-lubricated bearing test data on polytetrafluoro- ethylene (PTFE) modified polyimides indicate a PV capability of over 120,000 psi-fpm. Lubricated tests have been conducted successfully on transmission sealing rings at PV's in excess of 1,000,000 psi-fpm. Low wear rates result in extended operational life for polyimide com- ponents and due to the low coefficient of friction of PTFE and graphite modified compounds, polyimide parts continue to operate satisfactorily during temporary loss of lubrication. By taking advantage of polyimide's strength, low deformation under load, low wear rate, self-lubricity and chemical and temperature resistance, the design engineer is able to optimize part and assembly design. Improved performance, weight reduction, and cost savings may be realized. 810969. Design and Use of High-Performance Polyimide Components in Off-Road Vehicle Transmissions and Hydraulic Systems. Edward A. Miller, E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co., Inc. Today's off-road equipment designers are searching for ways to reduce manufacturing and warranty costs through better performance of critical component parts. High- performance polyimide parts are being used in demanding applications as replacements for metals and other mate- rials in transmissions, drive trains, and hydraulic systems. The polyimides' inherent properties of self-lubrication, flexibility, compliance, and wear rates give them advan- tages over metals. The high load bearing, high PV, high temperature resistance, and low creep properties place them above the engineering plastics. This paper describes application and design concepts to illustrate where high-performance polyimide compo- nents can contribute to cost effective performance improvements in off-road equipment. Physical properties important to engineering design, such as strength, creep resistance, thermal expansion, wear life (in both lubricated and dry systems), and frictional characteristics are highlighted. 810971. Wheel Motors for Hydrostatic Mobile Equip- ment. Siegfried Nembach, Zahnradfabrik Fried- richshafen AG. The wheel motor is a combination of hydro-motor and planetary transmission. Industrial, agricultural, construc- tion and various types of public utility vehicles, which due to their design cannot use axle drives, make increasing use of the individual wheel drive. Speed, torque transmission, wheel bearings, valves for hydraulic operation and hydraulic engagement/disengagement are some of the requirements for wheel motor drives. 810973. The "Free-Coupling" Principle as Applied to Multi-Speed and Power Assisted Hydrostatic Vehicle Drives. J. M. Weltzien, North American Hydraulics, Inc., Baton Rouge, LA.

The specific technique allows for several speed ranges and shifting in and out of power while moving. 810974. Design and Development of a Low Speed High Torque Hydraulic Motor. R. J. Recker, John Deere Product Engineering Center. A low speed, high torque hydraulic motor has been developed. This motor utilizes radial pistons with roller cam followers, a fixed cam and a rotating piston carrier splined to the output shaft. Oil routing is accomplished by a non-rotating manifold with lapped porting faces. A destroke device is provided which hydraulically retracts the pistons for disengaged operation. Mounting is accomplished through a high pressure pivot joint to allow the motor to be used for powered steerable wheels. 810976. (SP-494) An Increase of Engine Oil Consumption at High Temperature of Piston and Cylinder. Shoichi Furuhama, Masaru Hiruma and Hideki Yoshida, Dept. of Mech. Engrg., Musashi Insti- tute of Technology. Under high thermal load operation, engine oil consump- tion was monitored using the hydrogen fuel method. Burning was detected in the piston top-land clearance, and this may be a key to understanding the carbon adhesion mechanism on the piston top-land. The follow- ing results were obtained in this study: 1. Oil consumption is greatly affected by the evapo- ration of oil at temperatures higher than 160°C. 2. Burning is found in top-land clearances of hydro- gen, gasoline, and large clearance diesel engines. How- ever, only weak burning could be detected in diesel engines with tight-fitting crowns. 1981 SAE Transactions 810977.

How much reduction in piston friction loss can be 134</page><page sequence="116">810980-810991 achieved by the piston design? Piston friction force measurements have been carried out using the measuring method developed by the authors to obtain the effects of piston clearance, surface rough- ness, lubricant and ring size and contact pressure on the piston friction forces. A particular emphasis is placed on the study of effects of the piston rings by the experimental and theoretical analyses, since friction forces of piston rings accounted for 3/4 or more of the total piston friction force. 1981 SA E Transactions 810980.

Dif- ferent power/voltage ratings are possible. 810982. In-Vehicle History Recording of Diesel Engine Performance Parameters. Ronald F. Mayer and Albert L. Wolfe, International Harvester Co., Engine Div. Recently developed portable instrumentation has now made feasible and practical the accurate history recording of diesel engine fuel consumption for load factor data along with engine speed and other performance param- eters during actual vehicle operation. Engine load factor data is determined by the instantaneous fuel consumption as a percentage of full load fuel consumption and is important in the design and the application of engine components and accessories. The required instrumenta- tion consists of a precision fuel metering system, an electronic tachometer, temperature transducers, and com- pact integrated circuit histogram data recorders. 1981 SA E Transactions 810987.

Bhatia and Thomas E. Springer, The Timken Co. Advances in computer technology and the published results of extensive bearing research and empirical testing, have allowed designers to expand the traditional catalog approach and optimize the selection process for tapered roller bearings. This paper explores many of the factors influencing bearing selection where fatigue life is the primary concern, and describes how the Bearing Systems Analysis (BSA) approach, as used by The Timken Company, incorporates the effect of many of these environmental variables. Particular attention is paid to the formation and analysis of the load-speed spectrum, or histogram, and to the vital part it plays in the bearing selection process. 1981 SA E Transactions 810995. Industrial Fixed-Bed Coal Gasification: An Eco- nomic Alternative to Deregulated Natural Gas. Rolf E. Maurer, Coal Gasification Systems, Black, Sivalls &amp; Bryson, Inc., Houston, TX, a Subsidiary of Gulf Resources &amp; Chemical Corp. The role of coal in the United States energy future will definitely increase due to the higher cost of oil and natural gas. This paper reviews the projected role which coal will play in this country within the next twenty years. Specifically, the generation of coal derived industrial fuel gas using fixed bed gasifiers is reviewed. The fixed bed gasifier technology presented includes the single-stage "galusha" gasifier and the two-stage gasifier design offered by Black, Sivalls &amp; Bryson, Incorporated. The paper reviews the use of various U.S. coals in these industrial gasifiers and presents operational data from a variety of coals. The use of coal derived industrial fuel gas by companies within the U.S. is reviewed including the economic criteria which lead to these industries investing in coal gasification systems. Projected fuel costs are presented. These data suggest a cross-over between coal derived IFG and natural gas costs in the 1985 time frame. 810996. (SP-495) The Effect of Fuel Injection Rate and Timing on the Physical, Chemical, and Biological Character of Particulate Emissions from a Direct Injection Diesel. J. Campbell, J. Scholl, F. Hibbler, S. Bagley, D. Leddy, D. Abata and J. Johnson, Michigan Technological Univ. Formation of pollutants from diesel combustion and methods for their control have been reviewed. Of these methods, fuel injection rate and timing were selected for a parametric study relative to total particulate, soluble organic fraction (SOF), sulfates, solids and NO and N02 emissions from a heavy-duty, turbocharged, after-cooled, direct-injection (DI) diesel. Chemical analyses of the SOF were performed at selected engine conditions to determine the effects of injection rate and timing on each of the eight chemical subfractions comprising the SOF. Biological character of the SOF was determined using the Ames Salmonella/microsome bioassay. The study has shown that increased injection rates reduced solid and SOF particulate emissions and brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC). Increased injection rates also increased NO and N02 emissions and slightly increased the biological activity of the SOF. Retarded static injection timing increased BSFC and solid partic- ulate emissions, but reduced NO, N02, and SOF emis- sions and slightly decreased the biological activity of the SOF. Injection rate had a greater effect than static injection timing on solid particulate and N02 emissions, but had a lesser effect on BSFC, SOF emissions, and biological activity of the SOF. An increase in the rate of injection combined with a retard in injection timing has been shown to improve the particulate characteristics of the engine without adversely affecting the BSNOx or BSFC. 1981 SA E Transactions 810997.

Takase, Engine Technical Center &amp; Electronics Research Lab., Komatsu Ltd. (Japan). To control diesel combustion, the electronically controlled high pressure fuel injection system - KOMPICS has been developed. The system has been first evaluated by the single cylinder engine. The performance has been found to be better than that of air swirl type combustion. Then the system has been fitted to Komatsu SA6D155 engine (6 cylinder turbocharged and after cooled engine, 155 mm in 136</page><page sequence="118">810998-811005 the bore 170 mm in the stroke) and tested. The per- formance was very attractive, that is not only the fuel economy was attractive but also the performance at low speed was especially improved for industrial heavy duty engines. Transient response was also significantly im- proved. Preliminary endurance tests for 1,000 hours have been conducted and no significant failure has been found. 1981 SAE Transactions 810998. A New Look at the Utilization of Alternate Fuels for Diesel Engines - IDIS. Teruyuki Fujisawa and Katsuhiko Yokota, Isuzu Motors Ltd. Application of alternate fuels to diesel engine is much desired. A new and unique dual-fuel injection system has been developed for high speed automotive diesel engines. This system has two features. One is that alternate fuels such as methanol, ethanol and biomass, are directly inducted into the fuel injection pipe through one-way check valve under pressure, and blended fuels are simultaneously injected into the combustion chamber. The other is that various kinds of fuel can be easily adapted to this system not dependent upon the fuel properties such as viscosity. Using a single cylinder direct injection diesel engine and ethanol as an alternate fuel, injection characteristics and exhaust gas emissions were investigated. The results showed that ethanol could replace up to 50% of diesel fuel while keeping the normal engine operating stability. A better fuel economy was also obtained by applying both higher compression ratio and advanced injection timing. NOx concentration was un- changed compared to diesel fuel only. 1981 SAE Transactions 810999. Designing for Reduced Repair Labor Cost. Wil- liam Puffer, Empire Machinery. Field maintenance and repair costs are a major part of total operating costs on off-highway equipment. Ease of maintenance must be considered very early in the design process and re-evaluated as the design matures. Specific suggestions for product design criteria cover power train, electrical and hydraulic systems as well as lubrication and periodic maintenance items such as filters and lubricant changes. Current design approaches are discussed and preferred designs are identified. 811000. Producibility Studies on Research Safety Vehicle at Budd. W. W.

Microalloyed Cold Finished and Hot Rolled Bars. J. H. Bucher and J. F. Held, Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corp. This paper deals with the use of small amounts of certain alloying additions, primarily columbium and vanadium, to enhance the mechanical properties of cold finished and hot rolled bar products. Hot rolled products with guaranteed tensile properties are readily produced by this approach; moreover, the application of microalloyed bars has successfully eliminated the need for heat treatment of various hot forged parts such as universal joint couplings, stabilizer bars, as well as connecting rods and caps. A typical example of this approach will be presented. High-strength, cold finished bars are readily produced by starting with microalloyed hot rolled bars thus significantly expanding the range of properties achievable using a variety of base grades. Mechanical property and machinability data will be presented descriptive of selected commercially available products. 811004.

The piston of this machine is driven by high pressure nitrogen, and its speed is controlled by a sophisticated hydraulic system. This paper describes the details of the mechanism and performances of the machine, and presents some examples of studies conducted with this machine. 1981 SAE Transactions 811005. (P-97) Response of the Cervical Spine to Supe- rior-Inferior Head Impact. G. S. Nusholtz, J. W. Melvin, D. F. Huelke, N. M. Alem and J. G. Blank, Highway Safety Research Institute, The University of Michigan. A test series using 12 unembalmed cadavers was con- ducted to investigate factors affecting the creation of cervical spine damage due to impact to the top of the head. The test subjects were instrumented to measure head, T8 thoracic spine, and sternum acceleration re- sponses. Photographic targets on the head and torso allowed analysis of impact motions from high-speed movies. The stationary test subject was struck by a guided, moving impactor mass of 56 Kg at 4.6-5.6 m/s. The 137</page><page sequence="119">811006-811009 impactor striking surface consisted of a biaxial load cell with padding to vary the contact force-time characteristics of the head/impactor. The orientation of the head, cervical spine, and torso was adjusted relative to the impactor axis to investigate the effect of spinal config- urations on the damage patterns. Load and acceleration data are presented as functions of time and as functions of frequency in the form of mechanical impedance. Damage to the cervical spine was produced in all but one test, including fractures of the spinous processes, laminae, transverse processes, and the bodies of the vertebrae as well as ruptured discs and torn ligaments. Both anterior and posterior damage was produced and the sites of the damage ranged from C2 to T4. The peak forces produced during the impacts ranged from 1.8 kN to 11.1 kN. The limited response data of this pilot study do not allow any specific conclusions with regard to cervical spine tolerance levels. However, it does attest to the influence of spinal configuration and impact conditions on both response and damage of the spine due to crown impact. 1981 SAE Transactions 811006. (P-97) A Study of Impacts to the Lateral Protected and Unprotected Head. A. Nahum, C. Ward, D. Schneider, F. Raasch and S. Adams, University of California, San Diego. In an earlier series of papers, we reported on the results of a study of frontal impacts to cadaver heads which were protected and unprotected. New data is presented to quantify head response to laterally directed impacts. The temporo-parietal area of the head in stationary unem- balmed cadaver subjects was struck by a rigid impactor mass. Both helmeted and unhelmeted exposures were compared. Data collected included impactor energy, intracranial pressures at selected locations, and composite analyses from a nine accelerometer array system. In addition the data was entered into a finite element head model. Stresses and strains were predicted for various intracranial locations. The applicability of head injury indices in understanding lateral head impact are com- mented on. 811007. (P-97) Influence of Arm Position on Thoracic Injuries in Side Impact. Dominique Cesari, Michelle Ramet and Jean Bloch, Laboratoire des Chocs et de Biomécanique, Organisme National de Sécurité Routière, Bron-France. The thorax is frequently involved in side impact acci- dents; in such accidents, injuries to the thorax are related to the intrusion. The position of the impacted side arm can affect the occurring of thoracic injuries in side impact. This study describes the results of 15 side impact thoracic tests performed on 8 cadavers; most of these tests are conducted with arm involvement (the upper arm is placed along the thorax and the impact is transmitted to the thorax through the arm). The results of these tests are compared to the results of 6 tests previously published, conducted without arm involvement (the impact was applied directly to the thorax). From these results, it appears that the arm offers a limited protection when it is placed along the thorax, by distributing impact forces on the chest, and that the BLUR criterion is not well correlated with the thoracic injuries severity. 811008. (P-97) Correlation of Side Impact Dummy /Ca- daver Tests. Richard M. Morgan, Jeffrey H. Marcus and Rolf H. Eppinger, U.S. Department of Transportation, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. This paper is part of a four year study to systematically define side impact injury in terms of the kinetic response of a suitable anthropomorphic dummy. Last year a paper was presented at the Experimental Safety Vehicle Con- ference in Germany which analyzed side impact dummy response and injury prediction based on cadaver data generated by the Highway Safety Research Institute. These subjects were generally older than those discussed in the current paper. This paper includes data from a number of University of Heidelberg cadaver sled tests- including padding tests which we recently found to be (1) critical for a definitive analysis and (2) previously not available. Two advanced dummies, whose design specifications are based upon biomechanical data, are currently being evaluated by the biomechanical community. The two dummies are (1) a Side Impact Dummy (SID) designed by the Highway Safety Research Institute (HSRI) and (2) the Association Peugeot-Renault (APR) dummy from France. The performance of these two candidate dummy designs is compared by a variety of techniques in seven identical tests using cadavers. These tests are chosen for use in evaluating biofidelity, repeatability, and dummy /padding interaction. Among these techniques is a cumulative variance analysis-similar to a root-mean-square analysis- of the acceleration signal for the seven unique sled/pendulum tests where acceleration response data exists for APR dummy, SID, and cadavers. This cumulative variance approach allows an objective comparison of the response of each dummy design with respect to the cadaver data. 811009. (P-97) Quantification of Side Impact Responses and Injuries. D. Kallieris, R. Mattern and G. Schmidt, University of Heidelberg; and Rolf H. Eppinger, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Side impacts have been shown to produce a large portion of both serious and fatal injuries within the total automotive crash problem. These injuries are produced as a result of the rapid changes in velocity an automobile 138</page><page sequence="120">811010-811013 occupant's body experiences during a crash. Any im- provement to the side impact problem will be brought about by means which will ultimately modify the occu- pant's rapid body motions to such a degree that they will no longer produce injuries of serious consequence. Accurate knowledge of both the body's motion and resulting injuries under a variety of impact conditions is needed to achieve this goal. Possession of this knowledge will then permit development of accurate anthropomor- phic test devices and injury criteria which can be used to create effective injury countermeasures in vehicles. 811010. (P-97) Thoracic Injury Prediction via Digital Convolution Theory. Rolf H. Eppinger and Han-Sun Chan, U.S. Department of Transpor- tation, National Highway Traffic Safety Ad- ministration. A dynamic characterization of the human thorax, in the form of a digital impulsive response signature, has been obtained which links the acceleration response of the struck side with the far side of the thorax under side impact conditions. This dynamic characterization was obtained by a unique combination of digital convolution theory, least squares approximation techniques, and a digital set of cadaver impact data. It has proven itself accurate in predicting the maximum relative acceleration, velocity and displacement between the left and the right lateral aspects of the thorax for a variety of impact conditions including lateral pendulum impacts, lateral rigid walls impacts at 15 and 20 mph and lateral impacts into padded walls at 20 mph. Detailed discussions of the theory, the derivation of the various thoracic response signatures and their cor- respondence with actual data, the utilization of these response functions to predict injury, and the application of this technique to identify promising safety systems design strategies is presented. 811011. (P-97) Twenty-Five Years of Stapp Car Crash Conferences. John P. Stapp, U.S. Air Force, Retired. A historical review covering twenty-six years during which there were twenty-four meetings for field demonstrations and presentation of scientific papers. Twenty volumes of Proceedings were produced, consecutively numbered from Fifth to Twenty-Fifth from 1961 through 1981. The First Meeting was at Holloman Air Force Base on 17 May, 1955 in response to a request by Don Blanchard of the Society of Automotive Engineers for a tour of facilities and Field Demonstrations by the Aeromedicai Field Laboratory relating to automotive crash research, for the benefit of the newly organized SAE Committee on Motor Vehicle Seat Belts and invited guests. The evolution of the Stapp Car Crash Conferences in terms of organization and program development is traced. Contributions to auto- motive safety research resulting from the Car Crash Conferences are discussed. 1 981 SAE Transactions 811012. (P-97) The Design and Experimental Use of a Chest Load-Distribution Transducer and Force- Indicating Legs for the Part 572 Dummy. Roger P. Daniel and Carl D. Yost, Safety Laboratories Department, Ford Motor Co. The current Part 572 50th percentile male dummy's chest and legs only indirectly and incompletely measure the forces acting upon them - by spinal acceleration for the chest and by mid-femur axial force for the legs. A new chest and set of legs have been designed and are in experimental use in a Part 572 dummy which far more completely measure the forces acting upon them during crash testing. CHEST LOAD-DISTRIBUTION TRANSDUCER - Through three independent beams, with a small triaxial load cell located at the end of each beam, the vector direction and magnitude of the load can be measured at six key locations on the rib cage during the dynamic testing of restraint systems. The effect of small changes in the restraint system on the forces experienced by the thoracic area of the dummy can now be quantified. Some of the experimental results are discussed. FORCE-INDICATING LEGS - By use of these legs, femur and tibia triaxial, bending, and torsional loads can be measured along with tibia-femur (knee joint) shear loads and ankle upward bending loads. The knee joint also has force-deflection properties in shear. For the first time, these loads, induced by leg restraint systems, can be studied. Some of the experimental results are discussed. 811013. (P-97) Field Facial Injuries and Study of Their Simulation with Dummy. C. Tarrière, Y. C. Leung and A. Fay on, Laboratoire de Physio- logie et de Biomécanique Association Peugeot S.A.-Renault, France; C. Got and A. Patel, Institut de Recherches Orthopédiques, Hôpital Raymond Poincaré-Garches, France; and P. Banzet, Service de Chirurgie Plastique et Ré- paratrice, Hôpital Saint-Louis-Paris, France. With drivers wearing 3-point seat belts, the head- steering-wheel impact occurs in most serious accidents, so inducing mainly face injuries. In a first part, the authors analyze the injuries observed in a sample of 1180 belted drivers involved in frontal collisions, making a distinction, mainly for facial impacts, between injuries related to the properly so-called face and those to the skull and brain and the different possible lesionai correlations. In the second part are presented the results of work carried out in order to define a human face model adaptable to any type of Hybrid II or Hybrid III dummies' heads. The use of this model allows one to elaborate a new protection criterion for the face, desti- nation of which should be to complete the head and skull protection criterion, such as the HIC (or another equiv- alent criterion which could possibly replace it). 1981 SAE Transactions 139</page><page sequence="121">811014-811017 811014. (P-97) Impact Force-Deflection of the Human Thorax. Lawrence M. Patrick, Libbey-Owens- Ford Co. A volunteer was impacted at velocities up to 4.6m/sec. (15 ft./sec.) with a 10 kg (22.1 lb.), 15.2 cm (6 in.) diameter padded impactor. Force- time, deflection- time and force- deflection data are presented for these impacts showing a maximum force of 1.67 kn (376 lbs.) and a maximum skeletal deflection of 4.6 cm (1.80 in.). The maximum chest compression is about the same at 4.4 cm to 4.6 cm (1.72 to 1.80 in.) at all impact velocities. The force-deflection curve reaches a plateau where there is relatively little change in force for a large change in deflection after which there is a large change in force with little change in the maximum deflection. There is considerable hysteresis, and the force drops to zero while there is still appreciable skeletal deflection. 1981 SAE Transactions 811015. (P-97) Cinephotogrammetrical Study of Porcine Thoracic Response to Belt Applied Load in Frontal Impact - Comparison Between Living and Dead Subjects. J. P. Verriest, A. Chapon and R. Trauchessec, Laboratoire des Chocs et de Bio- mécanique, O.N.S.E.R.-Bron-France. The mechanical response and the injury pattern of pig thorax submitted to belt loading conditions were com- pared for living and dead subjects. The absolute deflexion and the resultant force were computed from cinephoto- grammetric data. The results indicate that dead are stiffer by 80% than living subjects. The visceral injury rate is higher in the living population. The skeletal injury rate is identical for both populations but injury patterns are different. Correlations were obtained in the living sample particularly between injury levels and deflexion, force and aortic pressure. With dead subjects, only one correlation was obtained between injury level and deflexion. 1981 SAE Transactions 811016. (P-97) Interrelationship of Velocity and Chest Compression in Blunt Thoracic Impact to Swine. Charles K. Kroell, Mary E. Pope and David C. Viano, Biomedical Science Department, General Motors Research Laboratories, Warren, MI; Charles Y. Warner, Brigham Young University, Provo, UT; and Stanley D. Allen, Utah State University, Logan, UT. As part of a continuing study of thoracic injury resulting from blunt frontal loading, the interrelationship of velocity and chest compression was investigated in a series of animal experiments. Anesthetized male swine were suspended in their natural posture and subjected to midsternal, ventrodorsad impact. Twelve animals were struck at a velocity of 14.5 ± 0.9 m/s and experienced a controlled thoracic compression of either 15, 19, or 24%. Six others were impacted at 9.7 ±1.3 m/s with a greater mean compression of 27%. For the 14.5 m/s exposures the severity of trauma increased with increasing compression, ranging from minor to fatal. Injuries included skeletal fractures, pulmonary contusions, and cardiovascular ruptures lead- ing to tamponade and hemothorax. Serious cardiac arrhythmias also occurred, including one case of lethal ventricular fibrillation. The 9.7 m/s exposures produced mainly pulmonary contusion, ranging in severity from moderate to critical. Cardiac arrhythmias occurred but were typically minor. In contrast to the lower compression impacts at 14.5 m/s, there were no rib fractures or cardiovascular ruptures. In general, peak sternal accel- eration and applied force correlated with impact velocity but not with normalized compression; and spinal accel- eration did not correlate with any parameter. Overall, the high velocity exposures, produced higher mechanical responses, more severe gross trauma and more serious cardiac arrhythmias despite lower compression levels. The results of this study while reconfirming normalized compression as one correlate of injury, emphasize the importance of loading velocity in deter- mining the overall severity of blunt thoracic impact. 1981 SAE Transactions 811017. (P-97) Test Dummy Interaction with a Shoulder or Lap Belt. David C. Viano and Clyde C. Culver, Biomedical Science Department, Gen- eral Motors Research Laboratories, Warren, MI. Belt interaction with the dummy's chest or pelvis was investigated during simulated frontal decelerations to develop a better understanding of the mechanics of belt restraint. Hyge sled tests were conducted at acceleration levels of 6-16 g's with a Part 572 dummy forward facing on an automotive bucket seat. Dynamics were compared in similar tests where the dummy was restrained by a conventional shoulder belt or belt segments attached to a modified sternum - a steel sternum with extensions for fixed belt attachments. Tests were also conducted with a conventional lap belt or belt segments fixed to an extension of the H point. Deformation characteristics of the standard and modified thorax were determined for a lateral and superior point load or a belt yoke compression of the sternum. The pelvic structure was also compressed by a lap belt. Our evaluation of test dummy dynamics indicates the following sequence of events with a conventional shoulder belt: 1.) Slack is taken up by forward movement of the dummy. 2.) The belt slips 5.1 ± 1.1 cm over the chest at a maximum velocity of 3.8 ± 1.0 m/s - independent of deceleration level. The belt then adjusts to the chest. 3.) Restraint involves primarily planar deceleration and compression of the thorax as belt loads increase. 4.) In the final phase the chest rotates about the belt and undergoes significant lateral deformation - as much as 5 cm shift in the midsagittal line - as the head and upper extremities 140</page><page sequence="122">811018-811021 decelerate. The nonsymmetric deformation of the thorax provides a pocket in the leather sternum for the diagonal shoulder belt. Interestingly, maximum thoracic defor- mation occurs after the peak in thoracic deceleration or belt load. In tests with fixed belt attachments to the chest, belt force develops faster to a higher peak and is of a shorter duration. The following sequence of events was observed in tests with the lap belt: 1.) belt slack is taken up and the belt adjusts to the pelvis, 2.) the pelvis rotates about the belt and translates along the arc of the belt, and 3.) maximum restraint occurs as the plastic covering of the pelvis compresses up to 8 cm and the upper extremities articulate forward and decelerate. Again rigid belt attachments to the pelvic structure result in a faster rise to a higher peak belt force which is of a shorter duration. Our study provides basic new information on the mechanics of belt interaction with the dummy, which may be useful in future efforts to improve belt restraint models in occupant dynamics programs. 811018. (P-97) Behavior and Response of Wheel Chair, Passenger and Restraint Systems Used in Buses During Impact. D. Kallieris, R. Mattern and G. Schmidt, University of Heidelberg, West Ger- many; and G.-D. Glitsch, M. Harres and B. Leis, Research Center for Rehabilitation and Prevention, Heidelberg, West Germany. Frontal, lateral and rear-end collisions with dummy occupied wheel chairs on a deceleration sled were conducted in two test series at a collision velocity of 30 km/h, and a sled deceleration of 8 and 12 g. In the first dummy test series conventional restraint systems were used; in the second test series improved restraint systems were employed. In a further series, four cadaver tests were conducted. For all tests and collision directions the HIC values as well as the resultant acceleration at the center of gravity lay below the admissible values of Federal Motor Safety Standard 208. Despite the low thorax accelerations numerous rib fractures occurred in the cadaver tests. In two cadaver tests, injury degrees of AIS 5 were observed (multiple liver ruptures, vertebral column injuries). 811019. (P-97) Development of a Dummy Abdomen Capable of Injury Detection in Side Impacts. J. Maltha and R. L. Stalnaker, Research Institute for Road Vehicles, TNO-Delft, The Nether- lands. A prototype of an abdomen for injury detection in side impacts is developed. This design can in principle be built into existing side-impact dummies. Necessary bio- mechanical data was obtained from free-fall studies with cadavers simulating impacts with intruding doors. The design consists of a structure with built-in tolerance limits and injury detection is obtained by a single channel go/no-go signal; thus complicated con- tinuous force and penetration measurements are avoided. The abdomen has a rigid penetration stop at the critical tolerance level. This stop is covered by a composite material giving stiffness characteristics identical to the human abdomen. Coded contact switches activated by springs when a critical load is exceeded are mounted between this material and the rigid stop. The abdomen is presented in detail together with the results of impact tests. The materials for the abdomen were selected with assistance of a computer aided design study described in this paper. The interfacing with some existing dummies and a possible extension to frontal abdomen injury detection is discussed. 811020. (P-97) An Anti-Submarining Scale Determined from Theoretical and Experimental Studies Using Three-Dimensional Geometrical Definition of the Lap-Belt. Y. C. Leung, C. Tarrière, A. Fayon and P. Mairesse, Laboratory of Physiology and Biomechanics, Peugeot-Renault Association; and P. Banzet, Saint-Louis Hospital. A theoretical study was conducted to prove that the Part 572 dummy submarines more easily than human cadavers because of their different pelvic shapes. The three- dimensional geometrical definition of the lap-belt was developed in this paper for the study of the submarining problem. It was found that not only the lap-belt angles from side view (/51) but also from the upper view in respect to the X-axis (ß2) play a significant role in the submarining tendency for each side. The anti-submarining scale is defined by a coefficient which is a function of both angles ßl, ß2 and the orientation of the upper half of the pelvic notch. A series of sled tests was performed on human cadavers, the Part 572 dummy and the modified dummy. Good agreement was found between the present theory and the experimental results. Some of the experimental results cannot be explained with the traditional geometry definition of the lap-belt given in two dimensions, but they are clarified with the present definition given in three dimensions. The graphs of the anti-submarining scales can be used as tools for checking the risk of submarining tendency in the geometrical design of the seat-belt system. The evaluations of the Part 572 dummy with modified abdominal tissue and pelvic shape at the notch are also presented: the submarining tendency, indicated by the relative occurrence number and the instant, are achieved more simulatively in the modified dummy than in the Part 572 dummy with respect to the human cadaver. 1981 SA E Transactions 811021. (P-97) Factors Influencing the Estimation of Submarining on the Dummy. M. DeJeammes, R. Biard and Y. Derrien, Organisme National de 141</page><page sequence="123">811023-811026 Sécurité Routiere, Laboratoire des Chocs et de Biomécanique, Bron-France. Submarining is a phenomenon that may appear during the restraining of an occupant by a safety belt and it is ascribed to an important lesionai factor mainly on the abdominal body segment and lumbar spine. This paper presents a literature overview and an in depth analysis of an accident survey which indicate that even if submarining may exist, it does not constitute a "safety belt syndrome" when considering the frequency of abdominal lesions. But these lesions are fairly often severe. As regards the approval standards tests, it is necessary to define an abdominal protection criterion. At present, two types of transducers are proposed for the display of submarining on the part 572 dummy and one of them, moreover, can be associated with an abdominal criterion. Our experimental study enabled us to compare the capabilities of the transducers. It is our feeling that these transducers can only be useful for the detection of submarining and that an abdominal protection criterion is still lacking. Moreover, it appears that some particular aspects of the human body model should be re-examined in the abdomen-pelvis region in order to check that the dummy presents an acceptable "human-like" behaviour. 1981 SAE Transactions 811023. (P-97) Risk and Effectiveness of Seat Belts in Munich Area Automobile Accidents. Gundolf Beier, Erich Schuller and Wolfgang Spann, Institut für Rechtsmedizin der Universität München, Munich, Germany. To assess the effectiveness of seat belts and the risk of adverse effects a 12-month accident field study was carried out, which covered all non-minor injured belted occupants. The criteria laid down were as comprehensive as possible to permit assessment in each case of whether or not the restraint system had reduced or possibly increased injury severity. Seat belts were found to reduce the number of non-minor, non-fatal injured occupants to about 1/10 of the figure for unbelted occupants. Depending on the type and locality of the accident, this ratio varies from 1/6 to 1/28. The risk of death is cut to about 1/4. With respect to non-minor injured belted occupants, in 63% of the cases injury severity was reduced, while adverse effects can be reckoned with in less than 1.3% (95% level). With respect to accidents in which non-belted occupants suffer non-minor injuries, this risk is reduced to 0.2% (99% level), and in at least 96% of all cases reduction of injury severity can be assumed. 1981 SAE Transactions 811024. (P-97) Pedestrian Post-Impact Kinematics and Injury Patterns. B. Ravani, D. Brougham and R. T. Mason, Traffic Safety Research Corporation, Palo Alto, CA. In this paper, frontal motor vehicle pedestrian collisions are classified according to post-impact pedestrian kine- matics observed in real world vehicle vs. pedestrian accidents. Results from in-depth pedestrian accident investigations provide the medico-engineering basis for this study. It was found that impact-induced pedestrian motion is influenced by the relative configuration of the vehicle and pedestrian at impact as well as the vehicle's impact speed and deceleration rate. Injury patterns were found to be dependent on the trajectory type in addition to impact severity and characteristics of the vehicle and roadway. Five basic kinematic trajectories have been identified for frontal collision cases and are described as: wrap, forward projection, fender vault, roof vault, and somer- sault. Pedestrian injury patterns are analyzed for each of the trajectory types; an injury risk index is defined; and the associated injury risks are compared. It is hoped that classification of the characteristic injury patterns and trajectories can facilitate vehicle design improvements to reduce pedestrian injury severity. 1981 SAE Transactions 811025. (P-97) Injury Mechanisms in Head-On Collisions Involving Glance-Off. Falk Zeidler and Günter Stürtz, Daimler-Benz AG, Stuttgart; Heinz Burg, Deutscher Kraftfahrzeug-Überwachungs- verein, Stuttgart; and Hartmut Rau, Technische Universität Berlin, Institut für Fahrzeugtechnik. The damage pattern of about 30% of accident vehicles with injured occupants corresponds to that created in offset head-on collisions. An accident reconstruction method using the vehicles' deformation energies as operands is introduced for this collision type. The parameters so determined are compared for accidents both with and without glance-off, and their effect on the different injury mechanisms of the belted driver is discussed. A theory is suggested regarding the cause of serious injuries to the lower extremities in glance-off accidents, and is supported by examples. To confirm the results, crash tests involving glance-off are carried out. 811026. (P-97) Factors Associated with Pelvic and Knee Injuries in Pedestrians Struck by the Fronts of Cars. S. J. Ashton, Accident Research Unit, Department of Transportation and Environ- mental Planning, University of Birmingham, England. The incidence of pelvic and lower extremity fractures is examined by reference to data extracted from police and hospital records. It is shown that the incidence and number of fractures to the pelvis and the lower extremities is strongly dependent on the age of the struck pedestrian and the speed of the vehicle. 142</page><page sequence="124">811027-811030 Pelvic injuries are shown to be more common in elderly females than in other age groups and it is suggested that this is due to elderly females being more likely, with current vehicle front end heights, to sustain a direct blow at the level of the pelvis. Pubic rami fractures appear to result when there are distributed impact forces at the level of the pelvis and acetabular fractures occur when there are concentrated forces applied to the greater trochanter. Injuries to the knee joint ligaments are shown to occur when there is an impact in the vicinity of the knee joint and can occur at speeds as low as 20 km/h although for complete rupture an impact speed of at least 35 km/h is required. It is suggested that the use of a simple impactor to control front structure compliance may not be sufficient and that a test procedure which controls hip reaction forces and knee joint angulation may be necessary. 811027. (P-97) Results of an Analysis of Truck Accidents and Possibilities of Reducing Their Consequences Discussed on the Basis of Car-to-Truck Crash Tests. Maximilian Danner and Klaus Lang- wieder, Association of German Automobile Insurers (HUK-Verband), Department of Au- tomotive Engineering. Possibilities of improved truck safety regarding frontal collisions with passenger cars are discussed. Character- istics of car/truck collisions are analysed in a study of 1,559 real accidents. Almost 40% of the fatalities in car/truck collisions result from front-to-front collisions. It turned out that the inevitably high mass of the truck does not constitute the only dominant problem in the majority of real-life accidents. Another major factor is the form aggressivity of the truck front which may be reduced by technical measures. Based on these results a series of 10 car-to-truck crash tests were carried out analysing collision types: - truck running frontally into car front, vrel = 60 kph - truck running frontally into car side, vc = 39 kph. The tests were made both with an unchanged truck and with safety modifications, using a large impact plate and an energy absorbing front protection. The large "impact plate" did not produce any appreciable safety effect in the chosen test conditions. However, as a result of slightly reduced car intrusion an effect cannot be ruled out in the lower speed range. The frontal protection with energy-absorbing con- struction and mobile design did result in improvements especially by reducing the override of the car by the truck. Quantifying this effect must be reserved for the subse- quent series of tests, which should reveal an order of priority on the basis of benefit/cost analyses. The study showed that safety measures of the truck front are extremely difficult - as they may influence the practical requirements such as bumper clearance angle, length, weight etc. - but solutions are necessary and possible. This study aimed to work out a proposal of principle safety measures. It is discussed in which terms safety measures on trucks may be described. The re- quirements of further research work are indicated. 1981 SAE Transactions 811029. (P-97) Simulation of Head/Neck Impact Re- sponses for Helmeted and Unhelmeted Motor- cyclists. Bruce M. Bowman and Lawrence W. Schneider, Highway Safety Research Institute, The University of Michigan; Paul R. Rohr, Insurance Institute for Highway Safety; and Dinesh Mohan, Indian Institute of Technology. The purpose of this study was to assess, by use of computer simulations, the effectiveness of motorcycle helmets in reducing head and neck injuries in motorcyclist impacts. The computer model used was the MVMA Two-Dimensional Crash Victim Simulator. The study investigated a wide variety of impact conditions in order to establish a broad overall view of the effectiveness of helmets. It was found that helmet use invariably reduces dynamic responses which have a role in producing head injury and, in addition, almost always reduces the severity of neck response as well. For no configuration or condition does the helmet greatly increase the likelihood of neck injury. Thus, these simulations of a wide spectrum of motorcyclist impacts provide further evidence that helmet use significantly reduces the likelihood and severity of both head and neck injuries. 1 981 SAE Transactions 811030. (P-97) Comparative Studies of Neck Injuries of Car Occupants in Frontal Collisions in the United States and in the Federal Republic of Germany. K. Langwieder, HUK Verband; and Stanley H. Backaitis, William Fan, S. Partyka and A. Ommaya, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Parallel and coordinated accident studies were conducted in the United States and in the Federal Republic of Germany to determine the extent, the level, and the comparability of neck injuries in automotive accidents as reported in the National Crash Severity Study (NCSS), and the Association of German Automobile Insurers (HUK-Verband) files. To determine the comparability of the two data sets, three primary evaluation criteria were used: 1) the distribution of overall injuries by AIS level by various occupant parameters, 2) the risk of occupant AIS injury vs. delta V, and 3) the distribution of neck injuries by AIS for restrained vs. unrestrained occupants. Frequencies and severities of neck injuries in car accidents were compared in parallel layouts between the two data sets in frontal, side and rear impact modes. In further breakdown the frontal impact file was separated 143</page><page sequence="125">811031-811036 into driver/passenger and male/female categories. Ac- cident direction and intensity as well as occupant parameters were investigated for their effects on neck injury severity. Neck injury severity distributions and types of injuries were compared with and without head contact for belted and unbelted occupants. Vehicle body components re- sponsible for neck injuries were identified. Special cases were selected from the accident files of both data sets to illustrate the effects of the dominant accident injury modes resulting from inertial and direct contact loads. Countermeasures to minimize neck injuries were hy- pothesized. 1981 SA E Transactions 811031. (P-97) Frequency and Significance of Seat Belt Induced Neck Injuries in Lateral Collisions. Felix H. Walz, Institute of Forensic Medicine, Uni- versity of Zurich, Switzerland; Peter F. Niederer, Institute of Biomedical Engineering, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology and University of Zurich, Switzerland; C. Thomas and F. Hartemann, Laboratoire de Physiologie et de Biomécanique, Association Peugeot S.A.- Renault, France. It is well established that properly worn seat belts reduce the incidence of severe neck injuries in car accidents in general. However, for certain configurations of nearside lateral collisions this statement has not been substantiated beyond any doubt by the published field accident data. In order to further evaluate this question, the samples of two accident investigation programs, one from Switzerland and one from France, were combined and analysed accordingly. They contain a total of 810 wearers of three point belts OAIS &gt;=2, 98 of which are cases of lateral nearside impacts. In 10% (N = 10) of this subset neck injuries of AIS &gt; = 1 were registered. 7 of those 10 cases were of a degree of AIS &gt; = 2 whereby 2 of them could directly be attributed to an immediate belt contact. The corresponding incidence of neck injuries in the rest of the sample (712 cases of frontal, farside impacts, rollovers etc. with 1 1 1 victims exhibiting a neck injury rated AIS &gt; = 1) is not significantly different. 1981 SAE Transactions 811032.

Ewing and D. Thomas, Naval Biodynamics Laboratory, New Orleans, LA. Static and dynamic axial tension loads were applied to the intact and isolated cervical column of the monkey and human cadaver. Radioactive microspheres were used to evaluate brain and spinal cord perfusion in the monkey. To determine neural pathway damage, somatosensory evoked potentials were recorded with stimulation of the spinal cord, and in spinal cord with stimulation of sensorimotor cortex, and in spinal cord with stimulation of cauda equina. The evoked potential amplitude de- creased prior to heart rate and blood pressure changes presumably due to brainstem distention. The preliminary studies show, 1) the brain and spinal cord were well perfused as measured with the microspheres when the evoked potentials decreased, 2) The cervical isolated cadaveric monkey spinal column ligaments failed stati- cally at approximately 1/2 to 1/3 the force required for dynamic disruption, 3) In the intact monkey, the cervical ligaments failed statically at approximately 1/2 the dynamic failure force, 4) the isolated human cervical ligaments failed at loads approximately three times those observed in the isolated monkey cervical column. 1981 SAE Transactions 811035. Mission- Adaptive Wing Flight Demonstration Program. Douglas K. Gould, The Boeing Com- pany. The AFTI/F-111 program is a full-scale-development flight test and evaluation of the mission-adaptive wing concept. This concept features variable-camber leading and trailing edge flaps that are automatically positioned to alter the wing airfoil geometry and provide best per- formance throughout the flight envelope. The flaps use flexible skins that are curved and positioned by internal mechanisms so that smooth airfoil contours are main- tained for peak aerodynamic efficiency. 1981 SAE Transactions 811036. The Anatomy of a Technology Test Bed - Integrated Flight/Fire Control - 1 (IFFC I). V. M. Marti and J. Woods Jr., McDonnell Aircraft Company, McDonnell Douglas Corporation, St. Louis, Missouri; and W. F. Swartz, Air Force Wright Aeronautical Laboratories, Dayton, Ohio. A USAF F-15B has been modified by McDonnell Aircraft Company to serve as a technology demonstrator aircraft for the Integrated Flight and Fire Control (IFFC) flight test program now being conducted at the Air Force Flight Test Center. This paper discusses: (1) the need for technology demonstrator aircraft, (2) the selection of aircraft to be utilized as demonstrators, and (3) the modification and utilization of a technology demonstra- tor. The IFFC demonstration aircraft is used as an example to illustrate some of the key points of this paper. The modifications made on this aircraft to install the Integrated Flight and Fire Control system are briefly 144</page><page sequence="126">811038-811046 discussed, which serves to show the degree of complexity of the system to be evaluated. Other modifications to this aircraft were made which provide for an onboard Instrumentation System (IS) and Video System (VS), and these are discussed in greater detail. It is the data gathering and recording capabilities which provides the means for acquiring the quantitative results needed in engineering evaluations. 1981 SA E Transactions 811038. Designing for Continued Airworthiness - General Aviation. C. A. Rembleske, Beech Aircraft Corp. Airworthiness became a national concern with the Air Commerce Act in 1926. Continuing airworthiness has become increasingly important because airplanes tend to have long lives. This certainly includes, but goes far beyond the airframe, to include power plant and every essential system: everything needed for safe flying. The designer begins by anticipating and providing for con- tinuing flight safety against the wear and tear of use and the ravages of time and environment. He will provide owners with all the guidance and instructions he knows to keep the airplane airworthy. But the operator is the final and most vital link in this chain - to follow instructions and to feed back to the manufacturer anything unantici- pated. As airplanes get older they just need more tender care. Continuing airworthiness is essential. 811039. Airworthiness Considerations in the Design of Commercial Transport Aircraft. J. R. Koch, Lockheed-California Co. This paper presents an overview of design considerations, design development, and maintenance practices required to certify a commercial transport aircraft and ensure continuing airworthiness in operation. Subjects discussed include philosophy and criteria of airworthiness with examples of their application; evolutionary nature of the design development; scope of development testing; and the process involving manufacturer, operator, and regu- latory agency to ensure continuing airworthiness through- out the aircraft operational life. Also discussed are the recent revisions in airworthiness regulations, which, along with advances in technology, have resulted in changing trends in the approach to substantiating continuing airworthiness, particularly for structures. 1981 SA E Transactions 811040. AIRWORTHINESS: A Continuing Partnership in Aircraft Operation. J. W. Steffen, Eastern Airlines. Continued airworthiness is essential to safety and oper- ation at an economical cost, with profitability as the end result. The material presented explores whether or not Industry and Government are moving in the right direction. 1981 SA E Transactions 811043. Structural Dynamics Modification - An Exten- sion to Modal Analysis. Dave Fomenti and Sri Welaratna, Structural Measurement Systems, Inc. A mathematical technique for predicting the dynamic behavior of modified structures is presented. The dynam- ics of the structure, before modification, are represented by its modal properties. This paper, therefore, begins with a review of modal analysis, and discusses some aspects of measurement that influence the quality of modal param- eter estimates. Following the explanation of the method of Structural Dynamics Modification, an illustration of the use of the technique with an easily verifiable example is presented. 811044. Structural Mode Sensitivity to Local Modifi- cation. R. N. Coppolino, The Aerospace Corp., El Segundo, CA. An efficient approximate technique for vibration mode re-analysis of a locally damaged or altered structure is introduced. The method employs a truncated set of original structure modes, augmented by an appropriate set of residual vectors, to form a reduced description of the damaged structure. The desired lowest frequency modes of the locally changed structure are computed on the basis of the reduced representation. Practical test cases, con- sisting of complex offshore oil platforms, illustrate the value of the new technique to accurately predict modal parameter changes at very substantial computational savings with respect to complete re-analysis of the structure. 1981 SA E Transactions 811045. Single-Point Excitation for Determination of Modal Characteristics of Shuttle Panels. Ralph Brillhart, Structural Dynamics Research Corp., San Diego, CA; and Harry Himelblau, Rockwell International Corp., Space Transportation &amp; Systems Group, Downey, CA. Single-point excitation techniques for conducting modal testing have gained wide acceptance in recent years. Improvements in mini-computer hardware and software have resulted in significant reductions in test time when coupled with single-point excitation. This has been achieved without sacrificing accuracy. This paper discusses the results of single-point exci- tation as used on space shuttle orbiter panels to determine their modal characteristics. Comparisons are made be- tween modes for panels installed in the orbiter Enterprise and acoustic test specimens. 811046. A Simultaneous Frequency Domain Technique for Estimation of Modal Parameters from Meas- ured Data. R. N. Coppolino, The Aerospace Corp., Los Angeles, CA. A new method for estimation of vibration mode param- 145</page><page sequence="127">811049-811054 eters from measured frequency response functions is introduced. Response functions associated with selected "independent" degrees of freedom are employed simul- taneously to deduce an effective dynamic matrix with a linear least-square technique. Vibration mode parameters are then deduced from the dynamic matrix. An additional least square relationship among "independent" and "dependent" degrees of freedom provides the means for estimation of mode shapes associated with all measure- ment locations. 811049. Structural Uncertainty in Dynamic Analysis. T. K. Hasselman, J. H. Wiggins Co., Redondo Beach, CA. Finite element modeling and computerized structural analysis are heavily relied upon in the design and development of engineered structures. Frequently these structures are tested as a means of varifying the structural models. Vibration tests are performed to measure modal characteristics, which are then compared with computed frequencies and mode shapes. These comparisons contain basic information on structural uncertainty, which is herein defined as the difference between analytical and experimental estimates. This paper presents a method for modeling structural uncertainty for generic classes of structures, based on actual analysis and test experience. It shows how the resulting generic statistical models can be applied to other structures of the same class, as a practical way of quantifying the accuracy of predicted frequencies, mode shapes and forced response, prior to testing . A realistic numerical example is presented to illustrate the general method. Statistical correlation is preserved throughout the process, and is traced through the numerical example. 1981 SAE Transactions 811050. System Identification of Large-Scale Structures. Michael W. Dobbs, Kenneth D. Blakely and William E. Gundy, ANCO Engineers, Inc., Santa Monica, CA. An efficient algorithm for system identification of large- scale structures is presented. The efficiency and practi- cality of the algorithm is demonstrated by application to models of an offshore steel-template platform and a concrete dam. The majority of the computational effort for system identification is required for structural parameter esti- mation. This computational effort is minimized by including closed form analytical response derivatives for sensitivity calculations and parameter linking for problem size reduction. These features and a general purpose finite element code developed to include these features are discussed. 811051. Airline Fuel Saving Through JT9D Engine Refurbishment. J. W. Allison and D. R. Weisel, Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft Group, Commercial Products Division, East Hartford, CT. This paper identifies areas in the JT9D engine where the potential exists for either further performance recovery following repair, or for improved performance retention. A number of new procedures and tools which will improve performance recovery are described. Improvements in inspection techniques are discussed. Operational tech- niques which will improve performance retention and impact degree of refurbishment required are also pre- sented in the paper. 811052. Management of Powerplant Maintenance and Restoration Programs for Fuel Conservation. Carlyle Reid, General Electric Company. This paper reviews powerplant operational and main- tenance procedures with the objective of minimizing fuel consumption and total operating costs of existing large turbofan engines. Specific recommendations are made to reduce the rate of on-wing performance deterioration and to define cost effective performance refurbishment. Measures being taken to accomplish further fuel and cost savings in the future are summarized. These include design performance retention improvements and devel- opment of performance diagnostic/analytical systems to permit better management control of engine operating costs. 811053. RB211 Power Plant Deterioration Review of Current Situation and Lessons Learned. A. G. Collins, Chief Performance Engineer, Rolls- Royce Ltd. The basic causes of in-service engine performance dete- rioration are summarized and the features of the RB 211 which have been designed to minimise deterioration are described. These features ensure that installation per- formance loss is virtually non-measurable. Areas where deterioration occurred on the first of the RB 211 variants, the -22B, are described together with the modifications which were incorporated in the -524, the second in the RB 21 1 family, to overcome these problems. In service airline results show the improvement in deterioration levels as a result of these modifications. An assessment of the problem areas on the -524 has led to further modifications being incorporated in the -535, the third engine in the RB 211 family. Initial test bed deterioration levels of the -535 are very low. 811054. Performance Retention Features of the PW2037. J. Keith Carriere, Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft Group, Commercial Products Division, East Hartford, CT. The PW2037 (formerly called JT10D) incorporates design and maintenance features for performance retention, many of which evolved from recommendations developed in studies funded by the National Aeronautics and Space 146</page><page sequence="128">811055-811066 Administration. A maintenance concept called on-con- dition/threshold refurbishment is recommended for the PW2037 for improving performance retention. The PW2037 is estimated to have performance deterioration less than two percent in fleet average cruise specific fuel consumption in 32,000 flight cycles when maintained according to recommendations. 811055. Design Technology for Improved Performance Retention in Turbofan Engines. David L. Seiwert, General Electric Co., Aircraft Engine Business Group. The General Electric Company's Aircraft Business Group has launched advanced mechanical design programs with the objective of substantially improving the performance retention characteristics of turbofan engines. This paper addresses the general causes of performance loss and presents current programs whose objective is to minimize these losses. Areas addressed are deterioration of clearances be- tween rotating and static components during a typical engine's life, engine generated and externally applied loads, and operating technique effects. Several advanced mechanical design features which address these conditions with the intent of minimizing or eliminating resultant deterioration of performance are discussed, and evaluation techniques for design verifi- cation, including laser optics are described. 811056. Crude Sources and Refining Trends and Their Impact on Future Jet Fuel Properties. Norman R. Sefer and Clifford A. Moses, Southwest Research Institute, San Antonio, TX. Forecasts of heavier, higher sulfur crudes show the need for more hydrotreating for sulfur removal. Increasing demands for middle distillate products will require more conversion of heavy fractions and more hydrogen proces- sing. JP-5 jet fuel, normally a straight run product, is likely to be made by hydrogénation and hydrocracking with resulting changes in properties. Synthetic crudes from oil shale and coal have special processing needs and will introduce other changes in chemical and physical prop- erties. The study identified properties of future JP-5 production for use in an alternate test procedure to qualify new Navy jet fuels. 1981 SA E Transactions 811060. FAA Certification Criteria for Critical and Es- sential Digital Systems. James J. Treacy, Federal Aviation Administration. The advent of digital electronics for use in civil aircraft, particuarly the new technology represented by central processor and microprocessor controlled systems, rep- resents a major challenge to the aviation industry. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is charged with the responsibility of evaluating these systems to determine if they can be used safely. The complexity of these systems as compared to their analog counterparts in use today makes their evaluation difficult. This paper outlines the major concerns of the FAA with the use of software controlled digital systems for airborne appli- cations. The methods which can be used by members of the aviation industry to obtain FAA certification of these systems are also discussed. The proposal of Special Committee SC- 145 of the Radio Technical Commission for Aeronautics (RTCA) forms the basis of the design methodology which is described for the successful devel- opment of the computer programs (software) to be used by these systems. 811061. Certification of Civil Composite Aircraft Struc- ture. Joseph R. Soderquist, Office of Airworthi- ness, Federal Aviation Administration. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Advisory Cir- cular AC 20-107, Composite Aircraft Structure, provides guidance material for use in showing compliance with the applicable Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR). The composite material evaluation criteria presented therein is reviewed relative to state-of-the-art aircraft applications. This paper raises related issues wherein the application of this evaluation criteria and the FAR may need special consideration. Areas needing additional attention are discussed and specific recommendations for improved approaches are outlined. Examples of civil applications of composite materials are provided. 811062. Application of Damage Tolerance Technology to Type Certification. T. Swift, Fracture Mechan- ics/Metallurgy Federal Aviation Administra- tion. A brief attempt has been made in this paper to clarify some of the confusion related to damage tolerance philosophy in satisfying the new FAA damage tolerance requirements. Differences between the U.S. Air Force and the FAA criteria are outlined. Steps to be taken in the damage tolerance analysis are itemized and details of required certification testing are included. The benefits of multiple load path crack arrest structure compared to single load path integral construction are outlined. Crack arrest phenomena is briefly described and the benefits of properly attached separate crack arresting elements are illustrated. Discrete source damage verification is dis- cussed with some of the more important details related to the pressurized fuselage. Finally, details of the first damage tolerance substantiation to the new FAA re- quirements are itemized. 811066. Integration of Energy Management Concepts into the Flight Deck. Samuel A. Morello, NASA. The NASA Langley Research Center has initiated a research program to investigate the integration of ener- gy/flight management computations and information into 147</page><page sequence="129">811067-811074 today's and tomorrow's flight deck. This paper discusses one completed effort that involved the development and flight testing of a fuel-efficient, time-based metering descent algorithm in a research cockpit environment. Two ongoing efforts discussed include: the application of this algorithm to a hand-held calculator for use in today's transport cockpit; and the development of an advanced concepts simulator for studies aimed at investigating the integration of energy management into the flight deck of the future. 811067. Airline Flight Planning - The Weather Connec- tion. Robert Steinberg, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Lewis Research Center, Cleveland, OH. Airline flight planning has shown little improvement in accuracy since the introduction of computerized tech- niques in 1964. This has primarily been, because both the type of weather product utilized by the carriers and the way they have employed it has remained unchanged over the past 15 years. The airlines now have an opportunity to make a significant advance in this area with attendant benefits in fuel savings. Most of the technological ingredients are in place, but it will take increased cooperation between government and the private sector if cost effective improvements are to be made on a reasonable time scale. This paper reviews the meteoro- logical basis for the present method of flight planning and analyzes its impact on current flight operations. A new approach is suggested for developing a weather data base, for flight planning, which has the potential of providing a fuel savings of between 2 and 3 percent on long distance flights. 811068. Wind and Temperature Database for Flight Planning. Harold C. True and David E. Winer, Federal Aviation Administration, Office of Environment and Energy. This paper discusses the importance of enroute wind conditions and the need for a wind measurement system which provides accurate and timely observations of wind and temperature conditions aloft. Recent advances in remote measurement of winds, temperature, and humidity such as the Stratospheric-Tropospheric radars and pro- filers developed at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Environmental Research Lab form the basis of such a system. A domestic system could and should be established using these devices together with a near real time winds aloft data dissemination network. Estimates of the saving in aircraft fuel consumption benefits range from 1 to 3 percent per year, or from $100 to $300 million for U.S. aviation system users at current prices and consumption. 1981 SA E Transactions 811070. Aircraft Surface Coatings for Drag Reduc- tion/Erosion Protection. Richard L. Kreitinger, Boeing Commercial Airplane Company; and David B. Middleton, NASA-Langley Research Center. Several films and spray-on coating materials were inves- tigated to find a smooth, durable coating that would reduce the drag of commercial transports and that would protect the substrate from erosion and corrosion. Two elastomeric polyurethane spray-on coatings were sub- jected to flight service evaluations on airline transports. Flight test drag measurements showed that the coatings reduced drag compared to some current surface treat- ments. 1981 SA E Transactions 811071. Operating Flight Loads and Their Effect on Engine Performance. R. L. Martin, Boeing Commercial Airplane Company; and W. J. Olsson, United Technologies Corporation, Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft, Commercial Products Di- vision. Engine diagnostic studies revealed that the primary causes of deterioration in the performance of high bypass turbofan engines are flight loads, erosion, and thermal distortion. This paper examines airplane loads that are imposed on the engine and the response of the engine to these loads. The effects of nacelle angle of attack, airplane speed, and engine airflow are discussed. It was concluded that aerodynamic loads and differential thermal expan- sion are the main contributors to performance loss due to loads. Integrated engine and nacelle designs are rec- ommended. 811072. Restoration of Performance, Models 727, 737, and 747. Jerome C. Baer, Project Engineer, 727/737 Sales Support, Boeing Commercial Airplane Company, Seattle, Washington; and William M. Staab, Senior Specialist Engineer, 747 Aerodynamics Technology, Boeing Com- mercial Airplane Company, Seattle, Washing- ton. Existing fleets of jet transports, such as the 727, 737 and 747 have useful lives which will extend into the 1990s. Because of this longevity and the impact of escalating fuel prices, improvements in the airplanes' operating eco- nomics are imperative. Studies have shown a number of changes to be cost effective. Among those being imple- mented are: improved flight operations, weight reduc- tions, drag reduction packages, more fuel-efficient en- gines, and new flight management systems. 811074. High Temperature Engine Control Electronics. D. C. Dening, Electronics Lab., General Electric Co., Syracuse, NY. Integrated injection logic (I2L) has been shown to be 148</page><page sequence="130">811076-811082 operable at temperatures to 300° C. Thus, I2L can be used in the digital control mounted on aircraft engines, where it is subjected to high temperatures and severe vibration. This paper discusses the design of PL circuits for such high temperature applications. It pays particular attention to gate design, to the patterns of interconnection, and to the metallization system employed. It also describes a data input chip for an engine control computer, which has been designed for high temperature applications. 1981 SA E Transactions 811076. Pressure Transducer Calibration Process. Frank Antonazzi, Sr., The Bendix Corp., Energy Con- trols Div., South Bend, IN. A range of high accuracy quartz capsule pressure transducers have been developed for aircraft application by the Bendix Energy Controls Division. These trans- ducers have been successfully used in aircraft fuel control systems. This paper describes an automated process that was developed for calibration of the pressure transducers. 811077. Reliability Analysis of a Dual-Redundant Engine Controller. Eliezer Gai, James V. Harrison and Robert H. Luppold, The Charles Stark Draper Laboratory, Inc. A Markov model is developed to predict the reliability of a full-authority, dual-redundant aircraft engine controller. The effects of failures of any of the controller's sensors, electronic interface modules, processors and actuators, as well as the consequences of redundancy management decisions are modeled. The use of the model to perform parameter sensitivity studies and to develop quantitative data in support of design tradeoffs is described. The effects of scheduled maintenance on the inflight shutdown rate of the engine are determined. 811078. Propulsion Multiplexer (PMUX) System-The Missing Link. Mario S. Latina and William W. Hixson, Hamilton Standard Division, United Technologies, Windsor Locks, Conn. The commercial airline emphasis on more efficient and reliable engines with lower maintenance costs has resulted in the use of in-flight engine condition monitoring equipment as part of the Airborne Integrated Data System (AIDS). To accomplish this task, the AIDS system must receive approximately twenty-five engine parameter sig- nals. The integraty of the AIDS input signals from the engine is not the responsibility of a single equipment supplier; therefore, when the user airlines have encoun- tered system problems, solutions have been slow in coming. A viable solution to this problem is to provide a centralized, engine-mounted data processing device for the engine signals. This missing link is under development. It has been named the Propulsion Multiplexer (PMUX) System and has been specified for Pratt and Whitney Aircraft and General Electric engines for the Airbus Industrie A3 10 aircraft. 811080. LAMPS III Recovery Assist, Securing and Traversing (RAST) System. F. Cracknell, DAF Indal Ltd., Mississauga, Ontario, Canada. The Light Airborne Multi Purpose System (LAMPS) mission depends for its success upon the ability to operate helicopters safely and reliably under weather conditions up to Sea State 5, i.e. ship roll angles of about 30° and wave height of 13 feet. The RAST system was developed to enable the system to meet this requirement. 811081. (SP-500) Design Considerations of DC-Link Aircraft Generation Systems. Mark A. Ross- wurm, Westinghouse Electric Corp., Aerospace Electrical Div., Lima, OH. This paper presents a brief history of aircraft generating systems with a comparison of the DC-Link system with the cycloconverter and conventional hydromechanical systems. The elements of the DC-Link systems are described and a discussion of the design considerations of the elements is presented. A brief technical description of each element is presented with block diagrams and simplified schematics. The paper concludes with a description and performance data for a 20 KVA and 40 KVA VSCF system. Hardware pictures of the design implementation are included. 1981 SA E Transactions 811082. (SP-500) Cost of Ownership Advantages with a Shared Oil System. R. C. VanNocker and W. A. Carmine, General Electric Co., Binghamton, NY. Significant Cost of Ownership advantages can be realized by sharing aircraft gearbox oil with the Electrical Power Generating System. These advantages result from the elimination of redundant oil system functions and the utilization of the existing gearbox heat exchanger. The shared oil system concept, whether with an engine gearbox or with an accessory gearbox, offers comparable advantages. General Electric's "dry cavity" generator design employed in its Variable Speed Constant Frequency Electrical Systems provides a technically acceptable solution to oil sharing. In this design, the oil within the generator, is contained entirely within passages made of engine quality materials. Contamination of the oil due to electrical insulation is not possible. This paper describes the shared oil system, why it is technically acceptable and compares the reliability, and maintainability advantages over an independent oil system. These advantages are applied to the life cycle cost formulas to show the specific advantages to be gained. 149</page><page sequence="131">811083-811088 811083. (SP-500) High Speed VSCF Generator Design Consideration. Ting L. Ho, Westinghouse Elec- tric Corp., Aerospace Electrical Div., Lima, OH. Computer aided design has been applied in the design of high speed VSCF power generation systems in the areas of spray-oil cooling, structural stability, and rotor integrity under over-speed conditions. The application of alu- minum and magnesium in the system to achieve light- weight is also covered. Thermal analysis using a finite difference program verifies the semiconductors critical temperatures upon which the heat sinks and the spray-oil flow are optimized. Finite element programs are used for stress analyses on the rotor and the structure. Attention is focused on weight reduction and stress concentration. Fracture toughness and fatigue analyses of an advanced rotor material have been used to determine the integrity of the system in terms of safety margin and service life. 1981 SA E Transactions 811084. (SP-500) Advanced Generating System Tech- nology. R. J. Kennett, Lucas Aerospace, Gen- erating Systems: Electrical Div., Hemel Hemp- stead, England. Considerable improvements in specific output of 400 Hz aircraft A C Generators have been achieved during 30 years of developments. Maximum specific output is achieved by means of the 24000 rpm 2-pole generator but significant design problems have hitherto prevented implementation of this approach. This paper describes a unique design approach to the solution of these problems and how further reductions of weight and volume have been achieved in integration with and simplification of the associated hydromechanical transmission. Associated with this is the enhancement of the allied control equipment technology by the incorporation of microprocessors. 811085. The Impact of the Microprocessor on Aircraft Electric System Control Philosophy. Byron Mehl and Greg Ruffner, Sundstrand Aviation. The use of microprocessors for the implementation of control functions in aircraft electric systems has become a reality. This paper presents a brief survey of these systems along with typical system block diagram. A description of the diagram highlights the advantages of microprocessor systems over existing noncomputerized control schemes. The second half of the paper discusses the adaptability of more advanced microprocessor systems in the next generation of aircraft electric systems. These powerful new computers will allow digital control and protection of single unit and paralleled generating and starting systems, as well as providing even more effective built-in-test. 1981 SAE Transactions 811086. (SP-500) The Effect of Critical Design Param- eters on the Selection of a VSCF System. Daniel S. Yorksie and Wayne E. Hyvarinen, West- inghouse Electric Corp., Aerospace Electrical Div., Lima, OH. Naturally commutated cycloconverter and DC-Link variable speed, constant frequency (VSCF) systems are each viable candidates for aircraft electric power gener- ation applications. Several critical design parameters have a direct bearing on the selection of the best system for a given application. These include system rating, cooling method, and temperature. System design is also influenced by other critical design parameters such as gearbox speed and range, efficiency and weight criteria, and enve- lope/location constraints. This paper identifies these critical design criteria and evaluates their impact on the selection and application of VSCF systems. A simple decision model is presented which summa- rizes the effect of these critical design parameters on system selection. 811087. (SP-500) Evolution and Development of High Voltage (270 Volt) DC Aircraft Electric Systems in the United States. J. D. Segrest, Naval Air Development Center, Warminster, PA; and W. W. Cloud, Lockheed-California Co., Burbank, CA. The increasing demands on aircraft electric systems to provide a low maintenance, highly reliable energy supply in advanced military and commercial aircraft, and the growing need to become less dependent on complex ground support facilities has accelerated the development of new concepts in power generation, control, and utilization. Coupled with this, the present threat of terrorist damage to aircraft in flight has created an unprecedented need for system survivability. Because of the relative simplicity, flexibility, and the unique ability of direct current systems to provide instantaneous redun- dancy for critical loads, there has been a renewed interest in high voltage DC aircraft systems. This paper presents the system concept, and status of hardware development. 811088. (SP-500) Packaging the VSCF System for an Aircraft Engine Environment. David D. Pollard and Gary E. Krajci, Westinghouse Electric Corp., Aerospace Electrical Div., Lima, OH. This paper addresses the packaging considerations and techniques used in the design of a fully integrated VSCF package which is mounted on an engine accessory gearbox. Special design considerations such as vibration, altitude, and temperature in the gearbox area are dis- cussed. A comparison and description of various methods of cooling, such as cold plate, immersion, and spray within a self contained cooling/lubrication system is also presented. The paper describes the integration of micro- processor modules, high power semiconductor arrays, and a high-speed generator, to form a compact, low weight VSCF system. 1981 SAE Transactions 150</page><page sequence="132">811089-811097 811089. (SP-500) Aircraft Electric System Development and Test Facilities. Don Cousins, Sundstrand Aviation. Unique and specialized in-house test facilities were required when Sundstrand Corporation added a new product line consistng of 400 Hz aircraft generators and associated controls. This paper will describe the evolution of the require- ments, the capabilities and the functions of the test facilities that have been established. These facilities provide the capability of testing multi-channel electrical systems using wiring configura- tions duplicating the aircraft installation, accelerated life testing of 12,000 rpm spray-oil cooled generators, and Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) testing of a com- plete generating system. 811090. Low and High Speed Propellers for General Aviation - Performance Potential and Recent Wind Tunnel Test Results. Robert J. Jeracki and Glenn A. Mitchell, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Lewis Research Center, Cleveland, OH. Research sponsored by NASA has indicated that there is a significant potential for fuel savings from advanced propellers designed for lower speed general aviation (G.A.) aircraft as well as the advanced turboprop for future higher speed (Mach 0.6 to 0.8) aircraft. Lower speed G.A. propellers tested in the Lewis 10 X 10 foot wind tunnel had variations in the level of airfoil tech- nology and activity factor. At cruise, the measured performance was about 4 to 5% below the predicted levels. A large part of this difference appears to be from inadequate modeling of blade and spinner losses with round shank blade designs. Blade cuffs and shaping of the spinner/blade juncture should offer the potential of recovering most of these losses, and combined with various advanced concepts may result in a 10 to 15% reduction in trip fuel for future lower speed G. A. aircraft. Advanced aerodynamic concepts for high cruise speeds were evaluated in the Lewis 8x6 foot wind tunnel. Results from these tests show high propeller performance can be obtained to at least Mach 0.8, offering the potential of reducing trip fuel by 15 to 30% compared to equivalent technology high bypass ratio turbofans. 1981 SA E Transactions 811091. The Use of "Kapton" Polyimide Film in Aero- space Applications. D. H. Berkebile and D. L. Stevenson, E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. Over the past 15 years, "Kapton" polyimide film has been adopted as the principal wire and cable insulation in over 70 military and commercial aircraft, missile and space vehicle applications. This wide acceptance is due to the unique combination of properties found in "Kapton": low weight, low smoke toxicity, high dielectric strength, toughness, chemical resistance and the ability to withstand extremes of temperature. This paper describes the key steps in the manufacture of wire and cable insulated with "Kapton". It reviews the latest in shop handling techniques including automated stripping and high speed marking. Additional aerospace applications will be discussed in avionics and insulation blankets. 1981 SA E Transactions 811093. Commercial Filament Wound Pressure Vessels for Military and Aerospace Applications. Edgar E. Morris, Structural Composites Industries, Azusa, CA. Light weight, low cost, composite pressure vessels, fabricated by overwrapping thin metal liners with con- tinuous high strength fibers embedded in resins, have been developed as a result of transferring aerospace technology to commercial products. Because the resulting filament wound tanks offer up to 50% reduction in weight and other advantages compared to homogeneous metal ves- sels, they have been successful in numerous commercial applications. With their advanced technology but lower cost, composite tanks are perfect for military and aerospace applications - as evidenced by the recent selection of commercial filament wound cylinders for the Manned Maneuvering Unit thruster for Space Shuttle astronauts. 811096. Fighter Issues - 2000. D. R. Kozłowski, McDon- nell Douglas Corporation, St. Louis, MO. The characteristics of an advanced air superiority fighter for the year 2000 are described. New features of the fighter include improvements in SPEED, STEALTH, STOL and SUPPORT, concurrent with credible weapon system capabilities. Preliminary findings of the 1995 Fighter Technology Study are described. Typical per- formance and capability goals are presented as a sug- gested starting point for further work. 811097. Quality, Quantity, and Technology - A Perspec- tive on Fighter Development. S. Keith Jackson, Jr., General Dynamics, Fort Worth Div. There is a growing controversy in the defense industry as to whether or not new weapons systems are becoming too complex, sophisticated, and costly to be effective. To the extent that they are, the problem is often attributed to the growth of technology. This paper reviews some of the effects of the growth of technology as exemplified by a comparison of the B-17 and the F- 16 in a historical context. It then looks at some of the implications of quality /quantity trades for new fighter aircraft. The conclusion is that intensive efforts to improve technology are justified. 1 981 SA E Transactions 151</page><page sequence="133">811098-811180 811098. Tactical Air-to-Surface Requirements for the 1990s. A. L. Caldwell, Advanced Airplane Branch, Boeing Military Airplane Co. Projections of requirements for manned, tactical air- to-surface systems in the 1990's must consider a number of complex issues involving future scenarios; threat environment; force mix; emerging technology in weapons, avionics, and airplane design; and operational concepts. The purpose of this paper is to provide a brief overview of some of the future requirements that may change current design approaches and concepts of operation. Parametric trades and design considerations on such issues as range-payload, short takeoff and landing (STOL) re- quirements, autonomous versus nonautonomous systems, and air-to-air versus air-to-ground requirements are summarized. Airplane design and technology require- ments having application to the resulting requirements are identified, and an example of a possible future tactical air-to-surface fighter is described. 811099. Future Strike Fighter Options ... Concepts and Technologies. Paul C. Bavitz, Advanced Air Force Programs, Grumman Aerospace Corp., Bethpage, NY 11714. Numerous recent studies have identified critical capability and technology needs for the next generation of manned tactical attack fighters. Weapon system concepts evolved in these studies postulated improved survivability and cost effectiveness over current operational systems in the severe Central European scenarios of the 1990s. However, cost effectiveness gains of these concepts were strongly influenced by forecasted capability and cost improve- ments in advanced conceptual weapons. Even if the appropriate weapon technology were developed, highly advanced weapons would likely constitute only a small portion of the available weapon inventory in that time frame. Consequently, the Tactical Fighter Technology Alternatives (TAFTA) Investigation was formulated by AFWAL to identify technologies and capabilities that promote survivable, effective, and affordable weapon systems while acknowledging tactical weapons inventories realistically projected to be available in the early 1990s. This paper highlights results from Grumman's effort on that program, focusing on concepts of operation and their attendant technologies for the air interdiction of second echelon armor. Five distinct concept options emerged for this mission area, differentiated by fun- damental issues including penetration mode, weapon delivery requirements, and threat state. Low threat state "seed" concepts - dedicated simply to efficient weapon delivery in a benign environment - provided "afforda- bility" benchmarks for more complex and capable weapon systems. This study feature, in concert with numerous parametric investigations driven by surviva- bility and effectiveness issues, provided quantitative insight into the cost of introducing various weapon system capability levels. While no single concept option proved to be uniformly optimum, mandates for technology devel- opment and integration which support quantum improve- ments in mission effectiveness were clearly identified. 1981 SA E Transactions 811100. Technology for Quality and Quantity in a New Fighter. W. E. Maillard, Northrop Corp. Trends in fighter development and threat capabilities suggest a growing crisis in operational numbers of NATO forces, increasing the significance of the Quality vs Quantity issue. Technology application is shown to be the key to producing quality and quantity in a new fighter. Primary forces in the cost escalation mechanism are identified. A design approach to lower-cost fighter concepts is introduced and quantitative rationale are presented to illustrate potential improvements in opera- tional capability. 811101. The Effect of Primer Thickness and Cure on the Bond Strength of a Nitrile-Phenolic Adhesive System. Nicholas A. DePalo, Jr., Surya P. Kodali and Robert C. Curley, Martin Marietta Aerospace, Baltimore Division. The growing application of bonded structure in aircraft, aerospace, and other industries emphasizes the impor- tance of achieving reliable, high-strength bondments, particularly in multiple-stage bonding. As the result of variations in the bond strength and failure mode of quality control coupons representing production parts that undergo multiple cure cycles using a nitrile-phenolic adhesive system, an investigation was conducted to determine possible causes. Results were twofold. First, the optimum blending of primer thickness and cure time increases bond strength and reliability. As primer thick- ness is increased and the primer is subjected to extended cures, bond strength decreases. Second, the most accurate method of measurement is the beta backscatter method, measuring the thickness of primer layers as thin as 0.00001 inch. 811180. Fuel and Fuel System Effects on Low Temper- ature Operation of Diesel Vehicles. M. L. McMillan and S. R. Reddy, General Motors Research Labs. Fuel and fuel system effects on low-temperature operation of 1980 and 1981 GM diesels were determined for fuels both with and without flow improver additives. Without flow improvers, the 1981 vehicle, containing a bypass in-tank fuel filter and an electric fuel line heater, could be operated at temperatures about 5°C lower than the 1980 vehicle, at which point the fuel reached its pour point and would not flow. With flow-improved fuels, the 1981 system could be operated at temperatures 10-15°C lower than those achieved in the 1980 vehicle. These data confirm the effectiveness of fuel system changes, and 152</page><page sequence="134">811181-811186 demonstrate the need to include effective flow improvers in diesel fuel to maximize the effectiveness. 811181. Understanding the Effectiveness of Diesel Fuel Flow Improvers. S. R. Reddy and M. L. McMil- lan, General Motors Corp. A new laboratory test, the Diesel Fuel Cold Filterability Test (DIFCOFIT), has been developed to predict fuel filter plugging by diesel fuels containing flow improver additives, and to understand how flow improvers interact with diesel fuels to affect low-temperature operation of diesel vehicles. In the test, a sample of diesel fuel is cooled at a rate of 2°C/h and filtered at 1°C decrements below its cloud point through 37, 125, and 420 /¿m screens to determine filter plugging temperatures. Flow improver effectiveness was found to depend on additive concen- tration as well as fuel n-paraffin concentration and distribution. Mechanisms are proposed to explain the effectiveness of flow improvers on the basis of these factors. 1981 SA E Transactions 811182. Broad Cut Fuels for Automotive Diesels. T. Currie, Davis Engineering Ltd., Ottawa, Can- ada; and R. B. Why te, National Research Council, Ottawa, Canada. There are problems predicted in meeting the future demands for diesel fuel of conventional quality in Canada. One possibility for extending supplies is to add virgin naphthas to the normal diesel fuel blends. Broad-cut fuels of different volatilities have been evaluated in two passenger car diesel engines in chassis dynamometer and road tests and also checked for cold-starting capability and exhaust emissions. With some restrictions on volatility for high-temperature operation and in cetane number for low-temperature driveability and prevention of white smoke this approach appears feasible. Some areas re- quiring further research are outlined. 811183. Determination of a Reliable and Efficient Diesel Particulate Hydrocarbon Extraction Process. Shirish A. Shimpi and Ming-Li Yu, Cummins Engine Company, Inc. Since the particulate mass emission standard has been proposed by EPA for diesel engines, particulate control technology and particulate measurement have become increasingly important. The main constituents of partic- ulates are carbon and hydrocarbons, their relative content in the particulates varies with different engine configu- rations as well as sampling systems. The percentage of hydrocarbon in particulate is considered to be important due to the suspected health hazard of polyaromatic hydrocarbons; also due to the mass contribution to the total particulate weight. At present, only total particulates legislation has been considered, therefore, knowing the contribution of hydrocarbon to total particulate is important. In this work, a series of controlled standard experiments was conducted to study the accuracy of solvent extraction and vacuum sublimation processes for the determination of percentage extractable of particu- lates. Comparison of both techniques was also performed on real particulate samples collected from various engine operating conditions. The results indicate that vacuum sublimation is a reliable technique. 1981 SA E Transactions 811184. Real-Time Measurements of Diesel Vehicle Ex- haust Particulate Using Photoacoustic Spectros- copy and Total Light Extinction. Steven M. J apar and Ann Cuneo Szkarłat, Ford Motor Co. There is a clearly demonstrated need to develop "real- time" methods for the measurement of diesel vehicle particulate emissions. Optical techniques provide one alternative for such methodology because of the rapid data acquisition times involved and the relatively simple sampling methods that can be used. This report describes two different approaches to this problem. The first, the spectrophone, measures light absorption by the diluted exhaust plume using photoacoustic spectroscopy, and the second, the long pathlength smokemeter, determines total light extinction across the diluted exhaust plume. For the measurement of total mass emissions, both techniques show estimated errors of ±15% for specific vehicles, while for a multi-vehicle diesel fleet the estimated errors are ± 20% and ± 30% for the long pathlength smokemeter and the spectrophone, respectively. For the measurement of the "elemental" carbon content of the exhaust particulate, both instruments have estimated errors of ± 10% for specific vehicles, while for the vehicle fleet the estimated errors are ±10% for the spectrophone and ±20% for the long pathlength smokemeter. 1981 SA E Transactions 811185. A Computer-Controlled, Real-Time Automobile Emissions Monitoring System. Peter Gabele and John Colotta, Mobile Source Emissions Re- search Branch, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, N.C. A minicomputer controlled automotive emissions sam- pling and analysis system (the Real-Time System) was developed to determine vehicular modal emissions over various test cycles. This data acquisition system can sample real-time emissions at a rate of 10 samples/s. A buffer utilization program enables incoming digital data from an entire test sequence to be logged rapidly and stored on disc, this permitting the user to reaccess the data at later dates for processing in accordance with modal schemes. 811186. Characterization of Particulate Emissions from In-Use Gasoline-Fueled Motor Vehicles. John M. Lang, Linda Snow and Roy Carlson, Nor- 153</page><page sequence="135">811187-811191 throp Services, Inc., Research Triangle Park, NC; and Frank Black, Roy Zweidinger and Silvestre Tejada, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, NC. Particulate emissions from 20 light-duty gasoline pas- senger cars and trucks were characterized using the Federal Test Procedure and Highway Fuel Economy Test driving cycles. Emission patterns were examined with 4 of the vehicles using three additional driving cycles, the hot start Federal Test Procedure, the Congested Urban Expressway and the New York City. The test fleet consisted of 4 noncatalyst vehicles operated with leaded gasoline and 16 catalyst-equipped vehicles operated with unleaded gasoline. The vehicles, obtained from local rental agencies, dealers, and residents, ranged in age from model year 1970 through 1981 and in mileage accumu- lation from about 300 to 81,000 miles. Particulate characterization included determination of total particulate emission rates, Ames bioassay of the dichloromethane soluble organic fraction, and analysis of the nitropyrene, pyrene, benzo-a-pyrene, and trace ele- ments content. Hydrocarbon, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen oxides emission rates, as well as fuel economy were also determined. The gasoline vehicle results were contrasted with the results from a similar diesel program previously reported. Generally, hydrocarbon, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen oxides emission rates were lower from the in-use diesels than the in-use gasoline vehicles tested, and total particulate emission rates higher from the in-use diesels. The mutagenic activities, as indicated by Ames Salmonella strain TA-98 bioassay, of the particulate organics emitted from the gasoline vehicles were higher than from the diesels. However, the higher activities were compensated by lower particulate organic emission rates, especially so for catalyst-equipped vehicles. 1981 SA E Transactions 811187. The Effect of Molybdenum-Containing, Oil- Soluble Friction Modifiers on Engine Fuel Econ- omy and Gear Oil Efficiency. A. B. Greene, Department of Transport Technology, Univer- sity of Technology, Loughborough (U.K.); and T. J. Risdon, Climax Molybdenum Co. of Michigan. A selection of molybdenum-containing, oil-soluble fric- tion modifier additives were tested comparatively in engine dynamometer tests on gasoline and diesel engines; the tests measured variations in brake specific fuel consumption with speed. The results indicate improve- ments ranging from 3% to 5%. A similar selection of molybdenum-containing addi- tives were evaluated in terms of transmission efficiency in a hypoid-gear, rear-axle test rig; the baseline oil was a formulated SAE-75W gear oil. Improvements in efficiency averaged 1-3%. Bench-scale friction tests utilizing the Press-Fit, Timken and Four-Ball test devices were employed to establish a correlation between small-scale rigs and full-scale engine tests. 811188. The Relationship Between Multigrade Engine Oil Characteristics and Fuel Consumption in Engine Dynamometer Tests. R. A. Galluccio and R. Dē Koller, Rohm and Haas Company. A fired multi-cylinder laboratory dynamometer engine test has been developed for measuring the effect of engine oil on fuel consumption with high statistical confidence. The range of test conditions employed encompasses both the hydrodynamic and boundary lubrication regimes so that frictional, as well as viscometric effects can be detected. The effects of viscosity and SAE viscosity grade for Newtonian and non-Newtonian test lubricants, and the effect of viscosity index improver molecular weight within an SAE grade have been studied. The results obtained are largely explained by the Theological prop- erties of the test fluids. The relationship between the performance of non-Newtonian and Newtonian oils has been found to be dependent on engine type, presumably due to engineering characteristics which affect the shear stresses and temperatures imposed upon the lubricant. 1981 SAE Transactions 811191. (SP-502) Light Duty Diesel Particulate Emis- sions - Fuel and Vehicle Effects. R. A. Bouffard and M. Beltzer, Exxon Research and Engi- neering Co. The potential effect of fuel composition on total partic- ulates and particulate character were measured on a variety of production vehicles, which are representative of different combustion system types, using commercial and laboratory fuel blends. Tests were made with a CVS dilution tunnel, primarily using the EPA CVS-CH test procedure. Particulate emissions were found to be a function of both fuel and vehicle parameters. Both the particle bound organic and the carbonaceous fractions of diesel particulates showed linear relationships with the fuel's aromatic content and backend volatility (as meas- ured by the fraction of the fuel boiling above 640° F). Emission rates were strongly affected by vehicle type. The regression models for each car indicated that the backend volatility contributed primarily to the particle bound organic fraction, while the aromatic content of the fuel influenced the carbonaceous fraction. Very large differences were found in the intrinsic capability of different vehicles to limit the emissions of extractable or sooty fraction of particulates. One vehicle emitted very low levels of extractables but high levels of soot. Another emitted high levels of extractables, but low levels of soot. This suggests the possibility for improved particulate control by combination of the vehicle design changes minimizing both particulate fractions. 1981 SAE Transactions 154</page><page sequence="136">811192-811197 811192. (SP-502) The Effects of Fuels on Diesel Oxi- dation Catalyst Performance and the Physical, Chemical, and Biological Character of Diesel Particulate Emissions. G. Hunter, J. Scholl, F. Hibbler, S. Bagley, D. Leddy, D. Abata and J. Johnson, Michigan Technological Univ. The effect of fuel changes on diesel oxidation catalyst performance was studied by comparing the physical, chemical and biological character of the particulate emissions using three different fuels. Baseline (uncata- lyzed) emissions were also compared for these same fuels. The fuels used for this study were: a typical No. 2 fuel, a No. 1 fuel, and a shale oil-derived diesel fuel. Compar- isons of NOx, NO, N02, HC and particulate mass emissions using each fuel were made using selected modes from the EPA 13 mode cycle. Changes in the chemical and biological character of the soluble organic fraction (SOF) were also studied. Fuel properties, most notably fuel sulfur content, were found to affect the performance of the oxidation catalyst used. Fuel sulfur content should be kept as low as possible if catalytic converters are used on diesel powered equipment. 1981 SA E Transactions 811193. (SP-502) Effects of a Narrow-Cut No. 1 Fuel, and Variation in Its Properties, on Light-Duty Diesel Emissions. Bruce B.Bykowski and Charles T. Hare, Southwest Research Institute, San Antonio, TX; and Thomas M. Baines, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Ann Arbor, MI. Several properties of a refinery "straight-run kerosene", which had a narrow boiling range approximating the middle of a No. 1 diesel fuel, were altered to study their effects on regulated and unregulated exhaust emissions. Eleven fuel blends, representing changes in nitrogen content, aromatic level, boiling point distribution, olefin content, and cetane number, were evaluated in a 1975 Mercedes-Benz 240D. Statistical analysis, including re- gression, was performed using selected fuel properties as independent variables. Higher aromatic levels were gen- erally associated with increased emissions, while increased olefin levels were generally associated with decreased emissions. 1981 SA E Transactions 811194. (SP-502) Testing the Smoke Formation Prop- erties of Compression Ignition Engine Fuels in Premixed Open Flames - A Promising Approach. H. O. Hardenberg, Daimler-Benz AG, (Stutt- gart, Germany). The black smoke emission from diesel engines is deter- mined to a great extent by the smoke formation properties of the fuels used. For various reasons, a test method would be desirable enabling the smoke formation tendency of a fuel to be ascertained outside the diesel engine where other fuel properties do not affect the result. It is shown that the smoke formation properties of pure hydrocarbons and practical engine fuels in premixed open flames appear to be representative of the black smoke emission from diesel engines. This represents a starting point in the development of a method enabling the direct determination of the smoke formation prop- erties of compression ignition engine fuels and fuel components. 1981 SA E Transactions 811195. (SP-502) Flame Temperature Correlation for the Effects of Exhaust Gas Recirculation on Diesel Particulate and NOx Emissions. S. L. Plee, J. P. Myers and T. Ahmad, Engine Research Dept., General Motors Research Laboratories. Effects of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) on paticulate carbon and NOx emissions have been examined using a single-cylinder, divided-chamber diesel engine operating at several loads and speeds. For a fixed start-of- combustion timing, EGR reduced NOx emissions while simultaneously increasing particulate carbon emissions. Results of this study indicate that the effects of EGR on both of these pollutants could be explained by variations in the stoichiometric flame temperature (Tf), which is the characteristic temperature of a diffusion-controlled com- bustion process. These results are consistent with an earlier study in which 02 and N2 were added to the intake air of a diesel engine. 1981 SA E Transactions 811196. (SP-502) Effect of Intake- Air Composition on Gas-Phase and Particulate-Bound HC Emissions from Diesel Engines. T. Ahmad, S. L. Plee and J. P. Myers, General Motors Research Labo- ratories. The effects of changing the intake-02 mole fraction on the emissions of gaseous and particulate-bound hydrocarbons (HC and volatiles, respectively) have been examined using low- and high-swirl prechamber diesel engines. HC and volatile emissions indices increased with decreasing 02 mole fraction. For most of the test conditions, the effect of intake-air composition on both of these emissions could be explained by variations in the calculated stoichiometric flame temperature, implyng that the combustion process in the engines considered was mainly diffusion-controlled. The results also indicated that, at certain operating conditions, a significant fraction of the volatile matter was contributed by sources unrelated to the main combustion event. 1981 SA E Transactions 811197.

Serageldin, Dept. of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Michigan Techno- logical Univ., Houghton, MI. 155</page><page sequence="137">811198-811202 This review broadly covers soot formation and its oxidation. Several physical and microstructural aspects are present which are linked to theories attempting to explain soot particle nucleation and growth stages. Chemical reaction and nucleation, being extremely rapid, make it difficult to provide a detailed mechanism of formation; however, a number of suggestions are made to explain the reaction path by which a hydrocarbon molecule may increase in size and mass. The nature of the soot nucleus is treated at some length illustrating the evidence to favour the droplet theory in the case of pyrolysis. Correlations regarding particle growth by agglomeration are also presented. Particle oxidation in small flames is discussed together with applicability of a number of soot oxidation equations. 1981 SA E Transactions 811198. (SP-502) Application of a Mini-Dilution Tube in the Study of Fuel Effects on Stratified Charge Engine Emissions and Combustion. J. A. Har- rington and R. A. Yetter, Ford Motor Co. A mini-dilution tube to measure particulate emissions is described and results obtained in an application are presented. The application selected is a study of fuel effects on stratified charge engine emission and combus- tion characteristics. The mini-dilution tube was developed to provide a capability for particulate measurements with dynamom- eter engines. The device has been demonstrated to yield particulate mass results agreeing to within 10 percent of those with a full scale tunnel in steady state tests with diesel powered vehicles. A PROCO engine modified by incorporation of Torch Ignition was used in the study. Fuels were a wide cut gasoline, methanol and Indolene Clear gasoline. The engine was operated at a speed of 1250 rpm with an indicated mean effective pressure of 390 kPa. Spark timing, injection timing, EGR and equivalence ratio were varied. Gaseous and particulate emissions and combus- tion characteristics of the wide cut gasoline and Indolene Clear were found to be nearly identical. With methanol the HC, NOx and particulate emissions were lower than with the gasolines but CO was higher. Combustion rates with methanol were higher than with the gasolines. 811199. The Effects of alcohol Fuels and Fully Formu- lated Lubricants on Engine Wear. H. W. Mar- bach, Jr., E. A. Frame, E. C. Owens and D. W. Naegeli, U.S. Army Fuels and Lubricants Re- search Lab., Southwest Research Institute, San Antonio, TX. An investigation of the effects of alcohol fuels and lubricant formulations on spark ignition engine wear and deposition was jointly sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy and the U.S. Army Mobility Equipment Research and Development Command. Tests were con- ducted using neat methanol, anhydrous ethanol, and alcohol blends as fuel in a 2.3-liter engine using a modified ASTM Sequence V-D test procedure. This dynamometer testing indicates that alcohol fuels reduce the buildup of engine deposits. Also, it was found that neat methanol greatly increases engine wear rates while anhydrous ethanol and alcohol-gasoline blends do not increase wear rates over that of unleaded gasoline. A 20-hour steady- state test was developed which shows that engine wear is inversely related to engine oil temperature when using methanol as fuel. The study shows that one lubricant appears to best control methanol-related engine wear, but still not to acceptable levels. 811200. The Mechanisms Leading to Increased Cylinder Bore and Ring Wear in Methanol-Fueled S.l. Engines. T. W. Ryan, III, D. W. Naegeli, E. C. Owens, H. W. Marbach and J. G. Barbee, U.S. Army Fuels and Lubricants Research Labora- tory, Southwest Research Institute, San Antonio, TX. It is now a fairly well established fact that excessive ring and cylinder bore wear can result from the operation of an S.I. engine on neat methanol. The mechanisms leading to the excessive wear were investigated using both engine and bench tests. Engine tests using prevaporized superheated methanol indicated that the wear results from reactions between the combustion products and the cast iron cylinder liner, where the presence of liquid methanol in the combustion chamber appears to be an important part of the mecha- nism. These reactions were investigated using a spinning disc combustor. The spinning disc combustor was used to provide a source of burning methanol droplets which were sub- sequently quenched on a water-cooled cast iron surface. The condensate formed on the case iron surface was collected and analyzed for chemical composition. Infrared analysis indicated the presence of large quantities of iron formate, a reaction product of iron and formic acid. Additional spinning disc tests were performed to inves- tigate the effects of surface material on the formation of formic acid. 811202. Wear Characteristics of Fleet Vehicles Operating on Methyl Alcohol. W. H. Baisley, Univ. of Auckland, (New Zealand); and C. F. Edwards, Univ. of Santa Clara. Three 1978 Ford Pinto 2300 cc vehicles were retrofitted to operate on neat methanol and driven for an 18-month period. The modification package included carburetor rejetting, upgraded fuel filtration and electric cold start assistance. Internal engine components (excepting cam- shafts) and the engine lubrication system were not modified. A conventional motor oil was used in all vehicles. 156</page><page sequence="138">811203-811208 Over 30,000 vehicle miles were accumulated in the test period. Wear metal samples were taken at 1000-mile intervals and analyzed for 16 metallic constituents using Direct Reading Emission Spectroscopy (DRES). Per- centage fuel and water dilution were also measured. All oil samples showed abnormally high concentrations of lead and tin. Iron accumulation rates over the entire test were similar to those reported for gasoline engines. Maximum fuel or water dilution in any sample was 0.5%. A deterioration in performance and increased oil consumption in all vehicles was noted after 10,000 to 12,000 miles of operation. Measurement of internal engine parts at the end of the test period revealed extreme upper cylinder and bearing wear. 811203. Development and Testing of Crankcase Lubri- cants for Alcohol Fueled Engines. G. K. Chui, Research, Ford Motor Co.; and D. H. T. Millard, PARAMINS Technology Div., Exxon Chemical Co. The 1979 decision by the Brazilian government to confirm their plans for widespread distribution of neat ethanol fuel (100%) to reduce petroleum imports prompted many investigations of the effect of the ethanol on passenger car durability. This paper describes results of a program to develop crankcase lubricants suitable for service with ethanol fuel over a wide temperature range. Engine wear at low temperatures was found to be the major problem. A low temperature Sequence V-D (PV-1) test previously developed, provided a suitable environ- ment for lubricant evaluation. Service station oils at the API SE and SF quality levels were developed based on consideration of their wear and corrosion inhibition when emulsified with ethanol. They were found to reduce critical wear parameters in the low temperature V-D test. Although vehicles operating in the warm climate of Brazil do not require all of the protection needed to pass the low temperature test, this work provides a useful start for the development of lubricants formulated for other oxygen- ated fuels such as methanol. Interest in the latter is growing in several areas of the world where temperatures below freezing are prevalent in the winter. 811204. Canadian Experience with Multigrade Gear Oils. N. W. Moat, Gulf Canada, Ltd. Testing of polymer- thickened multigrade gear lubricants, formulated with hydrotreated basestock, is describd. SAE 75W90 lubricants are identified as particularly suitable for Canadian conditions. Shear-stability data and the rela- tionship between viscosity and wear are used to show that good wear control should be expected using either mineral or synthetic based SAE 75W90 lubricants. Increased severity bench tests and extensive field trials support this. Data are given to relate axle efficiency to lubricant viscometric properties, with several multigrade lubricants compared. In a truck road test, an SAE 75W90 lubricant exhibited better fuel economy than a typical SAE 85W90 nil 811205. Effective Viscosity of Polymer Thickened Oils in Gear Lubrication. M. Hoshino and T. Naka- yama, Research Laboratory, Mitsubishi Oil Co. Ltd. (Kawasaki, Japan). Some new insights on the special features of gear lubrication in relation to the effective viscosity of polymer thickened oils were obtained by experiments using an IAE gear tester. It was found that the load carrying capacity of multigrade oils correlates with the viscosity after a 60 min sonic shear stability test and the change of bulk viscosity during operation of a gear system can be calculated from the EHL film thickness and the assumed extent of viscosity loss in sheared area. 811206. The Relationship Between Laboratory Axle Ef- ficiency and Vehicle Fuel Consumption. B. M. O'Connor, R. L. Johnson and L. F. Schiemann, The Lubrizol Corp. This paper discusses correlation data between laboratory and vehicle tests, both passenger car and heavy truck. The passenger car comparison relates to the EPA 55/45 Fuel Economy Test (FET) while the heavy truck comparison relates to the commonly used two-truck procedure. Further, the effect of speed, load, and temperature will be discussed as applied to heavy truck operation in the field and the consequences of understanding a broader picture of the lubricant's performance capabilities will be con- sidered. 811207. Performance Advantages of Multigrade Manual Transmission Oil. Yuji Ikemoto, Nippon Oil Co., Ltd. To obtain better performance at both low and high temperatures and to improve fuel economy, the per- formance of an SAE 75W-90 manual transmission gear oil was evaluated in comparison with conventional SAE 90 and SAE 80W gear oils. Good shift characteristics at low temperatures and reduction of gear noise at high temperatures were obtained with the SAE 75W-90 gear oil. About 4% improvement in fuel economy can be achieved by using the SAE 75W-90 gear oil compared with an SAE 90 gear oil based on the results of the 10 mode cold-start test. Tests with a friction-modified oil indicate that further improvement in fuel economy of the multigrade oil can be obtained by the addition of friction modifiers. 811208. (SP-503) Aqueous Alcohol Fumigation of a Single-Cylinder DI Diesel Engine. J. B. Heisey and S. S. Lestz, Dept. of Mechanical Engi- neering, The Pennsylvania State University. A single-cylinder DI Diesel engine was fumigated with ethanol and methanol in amounts up to 55% of the total fuel energy. The primary objectives of this work were to determine the effects of aqueous alcohol fumigation on engine thermal efficiency, combustion intensity and 157</page><page sequence="139">811209-811214 gaseous exhaust emissions. Assessment of changes in the biological activity of raw particulate and its soluble organic fraction were also made using the Ames Sal- monella typhimurium test. Alcohol fumigation improved thermal efficiency slightly at moderate and heavy loads, but increased ignition delay at all operating conditions. Carbon mon- oxide emission generally increased with alcohol fumiga- tion and showed no dependence on alcohol type or quality. Oxides of nitrogen emission showed a strong dependence on alcohol quality; relative NOx levels decreased with increasing water content of the fumigant. Particulate mass loading rates were lower for ethanol- fueled conditions. However, the biological activity of both the raw particulate and its soluble organic fraction was enhanced by ethanol fumigation at most operating conditions. 811209. (SP-503) Ethanol Fumigation of a Light Duty Automotive Diesel Engine. E. M. H. Broukhiyan and S. S. Lestz, Dept. of Mechanical Engi- neering, The Pennsylvania State University. A light-duty automotive Diesel engine was fumigated with ethanol in amounts up to 50% of the total fuel energy. The main purpose of this study was to determine the effect of ethanol fumigation on engine performance at various operating conditions. Engine fuel efficiency, emissions, smoke, and the occurrence of severe knock were the parameters used to evaluate performance. Raw particulate and its soluble organic extract were screened for biological activity using the Ames Salmonella typhimurium assay. Results are given for a test matrix made up of twelve steady-state operating conditions. For all conditions except the 1/4 rack (light load) condition, modest thermal efficiency gains were noted upon fumigation. However, engine roughness or the occurrence of severe knock limited the maximum amount of ethanol that could be fumigated. Brake specific NOx concentrations were found to decrease for all conditions tested. Based on the limited particulate data analyzed, it appears as though ethanol fumigation, while lowering the mass of particulate emit- ted, does enhance the biological activity of that partic- ulate. 811210. (SP-503) Performance and Emission Character- istics of a Diesel Engine Burning Unstabilized Emulsions of Diesel Fuel with Water, Methanol, and Ethanol. N. Khan and S. R. Gollahalli, Combustion and Propulsion Laboratory, School of Aerospace, Mechanical and Nuclear Engrg., The University of Oklahoma. This study was performed to compare the effects of water, methanol, and ethanol as internal phases in the un- stabilized emulsions of diesel fuel formed in the injection line on the performance and exhaust emission charac- teristics of a compression-ignition engine. The experi- ments were performed with a single cylinder, direct injection, air-cooled engine and the various emulsions were tested under practically identical operational con- ditions. The results indicate that (a) thermal efficiency decreases when diesel fuel is emulsified with water or ethanol and slightly increases when it is emulsified with methanol and (b) among the liquids tried, water is the most suitable internal-phase for curtailing particulates and CO in the exhaust, whereas ethanol is the best internal- phase for decreasing the emissions of NOx and UBHC. 811211. (SP-503) The Use of Ethanol as a Fuel for Compression Ignition Engines. H. O. Hardenberg and A. J. Schaefer, Daimler-Benz AG, Stuttgart, Germany. The combustion of ethanol in compression ignition engines reveals some attractive properties of this fuel, e.g. low black smoke, NOx, and hydrocarbon emissions. These results are confirmed by theoretical examination of the diesel combustion process. The direct use of ethanol in CI engines is enabled by ignition improvers, a variety of which is discussed in terms of their effectiveness, working mechanism, exhaust emissions, and economy. Vehicle tests over more than 1 million kilometers showed, among other favourable results, good fuel economy and low engine wear, but also ethanol-fuel-caused corrosion problems. Future development work will enable a further rise in specific power output and a reduction in fuel costs and could also open up possibilities of using ethanol derivatives as fuels for diesel engines. 811212. (SP-503) Ignition Quality Determination Prob- lems with Alternative Fuels for Compression Ignition Engines. H. O. Hardenberg and E. R. Ehnert, Daimler-Benz AG, Stuttgart, Germany. Using ce tane numbers to describe the ignition charac- teristics of fuels has proved to be most unsatisfactory when testing alternative fuels for diesel engines. Selected test results show that existing methods of determining cetane numbers, not only below the measurement range of standardized cetane rating engines, produce very dubious results, and that cetane numbers fail to achieve their original purpose in that they need by no means be representative of the ignition characteristics of a fuel in the practical diesel engine. The partly extreme discrep- ancies demonstrate the need to develop and standardize new or modified test procedures suitable for the whole range of potential diesel fuels. 1981 SA E Transactions 811214. (SP-503) Experimental Investigation of Vegeta- ble Oils Utilization in a Direct Injection Diesel Engine. Robert Forgiel and K. S. Varde, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, University of Mich- igan - Dearborn. An experimental study is conducted to evaluate diesel 158</page><page sequence="140">811215-811220 engine performance when fuelled by vegetable oils. A single cylinder, naturally aspirated diesel engine was used in this investigation. The effects of injection nozzle orifice size on engine performance was evaluated. It was found that operation with vegetable oils can limit maximum power output of engine but it can be increased to baseline value by increasing nozzle orifice sizes. Except for limitation on power, engine performance with peanut oil was found to be comparable to performance with diesel fuel for a given nozzle. Larger orifice sizes resulted in increased smoke and unburned hydrocarbon emissions. 811215. (SP-503) Service Trial of Waste Vegetable Oil as a Diesel Fuel Supplement. Mary Kay Cardis Fishinger, Helmuth W. Engelman and Dennis A. Guenther, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, The Ohio State University. This paper presents the results of actual in service testing of a diesel fuel supplement, specifically a 20-80% blend of waste vegetable oil and diesel No. 1. Tests are presented illustrating the effects of smoke readings, viscosity, specific gravity, and mileage with the 20-80 blend. Coupled with these results was the actual diesel engine tear down. The bus engine inspection included the head, piston heads, injectors, rings, and intake ports. The results of this in service test indicate that a diesel engine without any modification will run successfully on a blend of 20% waste vegetable oil and 80% diesel fuel without damage to the engine parts. Additionally only a diesel No. 1 blend was found to be satisfactory in cold weather unless measures are taken to prevent filter plugging. Finally, the results of this study indicate that the use of waste soybean oil as a diesel fuel extender is a viable short term energy solution based on economics as well as engine per- formance. 811216. (SP-501) Statistical Successes and Challenges in Fuels and Lubricants. Charles G. Pfeifer, Engi- neering Department, E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company, Inc., Wilmington, DE 19898. The fuels and lubricants industries currently are faced with many new challenges, owing in large part to the rising costs of energy and vehicle emission controls. The intent of this paper is to discuss a cross section of some key problem areas in fuels and lubricants and demonstrate how statistical methods can impact on them. Problem areas discussed include models for gasoline blending, predictions and misinterpretations of customer octane satisfaction, data base quality illustrated through use of an example on blood lead, and evaluation of automotive emissions surveillance data. 811217. (SP-501) Statistical Aspects of Testing Fuels and Lubricants. E. R. Jones, Chevron Research Company, Richmond, California. Recent changes in petroleum supplies have sharpened interest in developing fuel-saving lubricants, alternate fuels, and fuel-efficient vehicles. These problems typically require engineers to identify and measure small changes in fuel economy and vehicle performance in the presence of considerable noise. This poses new challenges for both engineers and statisticians. Now more than ever, they must work together in all aspects of these problems: from developing quantitative models and designing experiments to analyz- ing and interpreting test results. Using examples from actual fuel-saving engine oil tests, this paper discusses statistical aspects of the productive collaboration that should occur between engineers and statisticians. 811218. (SP-501) Developing Prediction Equations for Fuels and Lubricants. Robert L. Mason, Energy Systems Research Division, Southwest Research Institute, San Antonio, Texas 78284. Many challenging statistical problems arise in the research and development of fuels and lubricants. These occur as a result of both economic and environmental constraints since fuels and lubricants are very costly to engine test and must be blended in such a way as to achieve maximum energy efficiency. Engineers are continually faced with devising statistical experiments and analyzing the resultant data to determine how fuel economy or engine performance is affected by changes in fuels and lubricants. Examples of such efforts include predicting how alternative fuels improve mileage, determining the effect of fuel additives on engine performance, and determining the fuel efficiency encountered when using multi-viscosity oils. In this paper some of the statistical techniques that are useful in designing such experiments are in developing useful prediction equations are pre- sented. Specific emphasis is placed on the benefits of productive collaboration between fuels and lubricants engineers and professional statisticians. 811219. (SP-501) Discussion. J. W.

Pfeifer, "Statistical Aspects of Testing Fuels and Lubricants" by Edward R. Jones, and "Developing Prediction Equations for Fuels and Lubricants" by Robert L.

This discussion provides some historical notes on the interaction and some brief comments on some of the authors' specific examples. 811220. Formation and Control of Aldehydes in Alcohol Fueled Engines. R. Ayyasamy, B. Nagalingam, V. Ganesan, K. V. Gopalakrishnan and B. S. Murthy, Indian Institute of Technology (Ma- dras, India). 159</page><page sequence="141">811221-811224 Aldehyde formation and emissions from alcohol fueled engines are studied and presented in this paper. Several chemical kinetic models on the mechanism leading to aldehyde formation have been examined to explore the appropriate control methods to reduce exhaust aldehyde emissions. Control of aldehydes in exhaust emissions by suitable alteration of engine operating parameters, by in cylinder treatment with additives like aniline and water, by external treatment like airpreheating, secondary air injection cooling water rate and exhaust treatment are examined. The concept of surface ignition for alcohol fuels is briefly presented as a long range objective for using alcohols with minimal aldehyde emissions. 811221. Emission Characteristics of Methanol Fueled Vehicles Using Feedback Carburetion and Three Way Catalysts. C. F. Edwards and W. H. Baisley, Mechanical Engineering Dept., Univ. of Santa Clara, Santa Clara, CA. Alcohols (both ethanol and methanol) have been rec- ognized as alternative fuels to replace dwindling gasoline supplies. In previous studies, the alcohols have shown a potential for lowering the emissions of regulated species (hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen.) In order to assess three-way catalyst performance on alcohol fuels, three 1978 Ford Pintos have been retrofitted to run on neat methanol fuel. Over 30,000 vehicle miles have been accumulated during an 18-month period. Driveability, fuel economy and emission histories (CVS-78) have been obtained. Regulated emissions levels of all vehicles were below 1983 United States Federal standards throughout 10,000 miles of operation on each vehicle. Aldehyde emissions were a factor of three higher for methanol operation than gasoline. The energy economies for highway and urban driving cycles on the two fuels were comparable. Catalytic system efficiency for both fuels were eval- uated. Conversion efficiency for the regulated pollutants were similar. Aldehyde conversion efficiencies were found to be of the order of 90%. 811222. Case History Evaluation of Methane-Fueled Vehicles. D. J. Lafrenz, J. C. Glaub and D. B. Jones, Cal Recovery Systems, Inc., Richmond, CA. The results of an extensive case history evaluation of methane-fueled vehicles are presented. A total of 67 methane-fueled fleet operators throughout the United States were contacted. The questionnaire sent to the operators was designed to procure: (1) general infor- mation regarding the fleet (length of time the methane- fueled fleet has been operating and types and number of vehicles converted); (2) information on the fuel and vehicle fuel system (souce of methane, heating value of gas, and vehicle fuel tank capacity); (3) vehicle fuel consumption and mileage information; (4) cost infor- mation; and (5) information regarding operational dif- ficulties attributable to conversion for operation on methane. A total of 28 responses were obtained, encom- passing nearly 3,500 vehicles. Data from the study have been compiled into several comprehensive tables. The ranges of various parameters are discussed as well as the operation difficulties that were reported. 811223. Evaluation of Coal Liquids in a Single Cylinder Direct-Injection, Stratified-Charge Engine. Richard J. Roby, Lois E. Freeman, Joseph A. Harrington, Granger K. Chui and Wallace D. Tallent, Research, Ford Motor Co. Indicated specific energy consumption and exhaust emissions were measured for three coal-derived liquids in a direct injection, stratified-charge (PROCO) engine. The three fuels were obtained from different coal refining processes. One of the fuels met current gasoline speci- fications while the other two had volatilities somewhat below the specification and were more typical of some current gasoline blending components. A comparison of test results from these fuels was made with Indolene Clear, a petroleum-derived reference fuel. Little difference in indicated specific energy consumption or NOx emissions was observed between the coal liquids and Indolene Clear. The two fuels which had low front end volatility showed higher hydrocarbon and CO emissions at low speeds and loads than the reference fuel but performed well overall. On the basis of the tests, all three fuels appear to be potentially satisfactory in a direct-injection, stratified- charge engine. No characteristics attributable to their coal origin caused any significant problems in operation in such an engine. 811224. The Effects of Engine Oil Viscosity and Com- position on Bearing Wear. R. B. Rhodes and B. M. Henderson, Shell Development Co., Westhollow Research Center, Houston, TX. The effects of engine oil viscosity and chemical compo- sition on connecting rod bearing wear have been studied using single cylinder CLR engine tests. Two procedures were followed. One procedure, developed by Automotive Research Laboratories, Inc. (ALI), was used to evaluate both single grade, Newtonian oils and multigrade, non- Newtonian oils. The results indicated that there was no relationship between the high temperature, high shear rate viscosity of multigrade oils and bearing demerits. The chemical composition of the engine lubricants appeared as a primary variable which overshadowed the viscometric considerations. A more severe test procedure was developed using the single cylinder CLR engine. The results from this procedure were found to correlate with those from the ALI test programs. Chemical composition was again found to have a dominant effect on bearing wear. It was 160</page><page sequence="142">811226-811230 possible to reduce the bearing protection provided by an SAE 30 oil to less than that of an SAE 5W oil by the selective substitution of elimination of the additive components. Additive components, or materials derived from them, were found to be present on the inner surfaces of the used bearings. Such films may affect wear when the bearings are subjected to mixed and boundary lubrication. 1981 SAE Transactions 811226. Engine Valve Train Wear: Performance of Syn- thetic and Mineral Oils. M. Miorali, Assoreni; and A. Chiarottino, Agip Petroli. Synthetic and mineral base lubricants have been tested in an overhead camshaft (O.H.C.) Daimler Benz diesel engine. In order to explain the results, the wear of the whole cam lobe (nose and flanks) has been related to the entrainment and sliding velocities, the contact stress and the calculated oil film thickness. A solution to a corrosive wear phenomenon taking place in this Daimler Benz diesel engine has been found. The base oils evaluation has been extended for the overhead valve (O.H.V.) Volvo B20 and the O.H.C. Lancia Gamma gasoline engines. The Volvo B20 metal- lurgy has confirmed to be prone to the pitting damage and this engine has been adopted for the evaluation of the antipitting oil properties. The Lancia Gamma engine has been made suitable for the evaluation of the lubricants efficiency against the adhesive wear phenomenon. 1981 SAE Transactions 811227. Optimized Lubricants for Turbocharged Passen- ger Car Engines. A. L. Burrows, R. B. Dawson, I. R. Knowles and J. K. Woollard, Edwin Cooper Division, Ethyl Corporation. The adoption of exhaust turbocharging to boost auto- mobile engine performance is increasing. Many leading automobile manufacturers now offer or are developing turbocharged versions of their standard models. However, turbocharging an engine imposes specific thermal stresses on the lubricant that can influence both turbocharger life and lubricant service life. After quantifying these thermal effects, screening tests have been devised to reproduce service conditions in the laboratory by which lubricant base fluids, additive components, and viscosity index improvers have been appraised and fully formulated oils evaluated. It has been demonstrated that, by exploiting the properties of the lubricant components and their synergisms, lubricating oils can be formulated to meet the needs of high-performance passenger cars with added benefits for turbocharger life. 811228. Fuel Sulfur Effects on the Performance of Automotive Three-Way Catalysts during Vehicle Emissions Tests. Robert L. Furey and David R. Monroe, General Motors Research Laborato- ries, Warren, MI. Vehicle exhaust emissions tests, using the Federal Test Procedure, were conducted to determine the effect of gasoline sulfur content on the performance of three-way catalysts. The test fuels had sulfur concentrations of 0.01, 0.03, and 0.09 percent. An increase in the fuel sulfur content from 0.01 to 0.09 percent reduced the conversion of hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and oxides of nitrogen, resulting in higher tailpipe emissions. The effects were generally small, but statistically significant. The lower conversion was due to poisoning of the catalyst by sulfur species in the exhaust. The poisoning was reversible. 811229. Hot Weather Fuel Requirements of 1975-1980 Model Year Cars. P. J. Clarke, Exxon Research &amp; Engineering Company, Linden, N.J. The response of late model year vehicles to front-end fuel volatility was measured in a consumer survey carried out in Houston, Texas in the summer of 1980. About one hundred ninety customers were given gasoline of varying front-end volatility on a weekly basis. Responses to these changes in volatility were measured by weekly telephone interviews with each customer. Results show that Vola- tility Class C of ASTM D 439 provides high temperature driveability protection at 96°F (35.6°C), its highest vapor lock protection temperature. Most of the time Class C is overprotective, however, because the protection temper- ature must drop below 85°F (29.4°C) before a more volatile fuel, Class D, is permitted. Problems observed by participants on highly volatile fuels were sluggish per- formance, occasional stalling, and poorer start-up when hot. There were no cases of "vapor lock" (disabling of the vehicle because of fuel pump starvation) during the survey. 1981 SAE Transactions 811230. The Development of CEC Driveability Test Procedures for European Vehicles and Fuels. F. H. Palmer, The British Petroleum Co. Ltd., (Middlesex, England). As vehicle design and fuel quality trends continue to move into a regime where driveability malfunctions become exacerbated, hot and cold weather and intake system icing test procedures are being developed under the auspices of the Coordination European Council (CEC) to evaluate those aspects of driveability performance of common interest to both motor and oil industries in Europe. Following extensive road and dynamometer trials, development of hot weather procedure is nearing com- pletion and a draft cold weather test method has been prepared in readiness for road proving trials. The intake system icing procedure has yet to be studied. Reference fuel properties have been nominated for each of the three aspects of performance. 161</page><page sequence="143">811231-811235 811231. Combustion Chamber Layout for Modern Otto Engines. Dušan O. Gruden, Research and De- velopment Center, Dr.-Ing.h.c.F.Porsche AG, (Weissach, Germany). When trying to comply with the great number of increasingly severe requirements to be fulfilled by a passenger car engine, special importance has to be attributed to the design of the combustion chamber. The most efficient way to improve the fuel economy in the part-load range being to increase the compression ratio, emphasis will be laid on combustion chambers allowing high compression ratios combined with low octane requirements. According to Porsche experience, many demands can be complied with in the simplest manner by locating the combustion chamber in the piston crown. This configuration offers various advantages over its counterpart installed in the cylinder head. 811232. The California Vehicle Emission Control Pro- gram - Past, Present and Future. Thomas C. Austin, Robert H. Cross and Patty Heinen, California Air Resources Board. Programs to control motor vehicle emissions originated in California as a result of Professor A. J. Haagen-Smit of the California Institute of Technology discovering that two invisible automobile emissions, hydrocarbons and oxides of nitrogen, react together in the presence of sunlight to form oxidants such as ozone, a principal ingredient of the infamous Los Angeles area "smog". The State of California became the first government to regulate the emissions of new automobiles when it adopted requirements for the use of positive crankcase ventilation (PCV) valves beginning with the 1963 model year. The program has now progressed to the point where 1980 model year California passenger cars are certified to standards which represent 95 percent less hydrocarbons, 89 percent less carbon monoxide and 72 percent less oxides of nitrogen in their exhaust than the uncontrolled cars in the early 1960's. In actual customer service these vehicles are expected to achieve reductions of 82 percent, 88 percent and 65 percent for the respective pollutants. This level of control will occur despite the fact that cars in customer service are often improperly maintained. Although the degree of vehicle and industrial pollution control which has already been achieved might have been sufficient to solve the air pollution problems that existed when the program began, further controls of both motor vehicle and industrial sources are still needed. The tremendous growth that has occurred in motor vehicle traffic and industrial sources has substantially reduced the rate of progress toward the achievement of clean air for California. Motor vehicles are projected to remain a very significant contributor to California's air problems unless further control is achieved. 1981 SAE Transactions 811233. Statistical Analysis of Six- and Eight-Cylinder Passenger Car Engine Quality. Orron E. Kee and William M. Basham, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, U.S. Department of Transportation; William E. Hatch and Dorothy LaRusso, Automated Sciences Group, Inc. The methodology developed in an earlier SAE paper prepared by two of the authors for estimating the relative fuel efficiency of four-cylinder spark ignition engines from EPA vehicle certification data was extended to six- and eight-cylinder engines for 1978, 1979, and 1980 model years. The empirical model expresses variations in vehicle weight specific fuel consumption resulting from variations in the vehicle parameters. The model coefficients were estimated by regression analysis and used to normalize vehicle weight specific fuel consumption by minimizing differences among vehicles. Engine quality indicators were derived from ranking individual engine types. 811234. Effects of Injection Timing and Exhaust Gas Recirculation on Emissions from a D.I. Diesel Engine. Robert C. Yu and Syed M. Shahed, Cummins Engine Co., Inc. Some results of a systematic study on the effects of injection timing retard and exhaust gas recirculation on emissions from a D.I. diesel engine are presented. The factors investigated include engine speed, fuel rate, injection timing, injection pressure, intake charge oxygen concentration, and type of diluent. The detailed mecha- nisms governing the formation and control of nitric oxide are studied analytically, using a previously developed diesel combustion model based on transient fuel-air mixing and Zeldovich nitric oxide reaction mechanisms. The results show that exhaust gas recirculation and injection timing retard are both effective in reducing nitric oxide emissions at the expense of increasing smoke. The reduction of nitric oxide with exhaust gas recirculation and injection timing retard is mainly related to the decrease of local temperature and local atomic oxygen concentration. The local atomic oxygen concentration is a function of the local temperature and local molecular oxygen concentration. The results also indicate that the smoke-nitric oxide trade-off at constant charge-fuel ratio for the engine tested is fairly independent of exhaust gas recirculation rate, injection timing, injection pressure, engine speed and fuel rate. 1981 SAE Transactions 811235.

A Concept for Catalyzed Ignition of Diesel Soot. L. J. Hillenbrand and D. A. Trayser, Battelle, Columbus Laboratories, Columbus, Ohio. This paper discusses the technology for disposal of diesel particulate by catalytic ignition and combustion. Using the trap-oxidizer concept, the collected soot was catalytically treated to make ignition and combustion more practical under diesel engine exhaust conditions. The catalyzed ignition was examined in a laboratory hot-tube reactor and the information thus obtained was used to design trials under engine exhaust conditions. Solutions of metal salts such as copper, manganese, or cobalt chlorides, or the corresponding nitrates, have been shown to be effective; most of this study was carried out using solutions of mixtures of copper chloride and sodium chloride. Suitable solvents included methanol, glycol- water mixtures, and distilled water. Soot-related parameters such as the soluble organic content, degree of compaction, graphitization, and surface area have been examined briefly during the course of the study. To minimize the possibilities of a secondary pollution hazard, most of the tests were conducted using low concentrations of catalytic salts. Thus, 1.18 x lO^4 moles of Cu per gram of soot, added from solution, was found sufficient to lower the ignition temperature of diesel soot as much as 200 C, and reductions of 250 C were obtained when sodium or ammonium salts were included. Higher concentrations of catalytic salts can lower the ignition temperature still further. In the exhaust pipe, repeated ignition and combustion of trapped soot was found to regenerate normal operating back pressure in a porous ceramic trap. 811250. (SP-505) Microcomputer Technology for Truck and Vehicle Applications. Lionel Smith, Intel Corp. The decision to use a microcomputer in an automotive application is often far easier than the choice of which particular microcomputer to use. The wide range of applications places an equally wide range of demands on the microcomputer. Three application examples (engine control, antiskid braking, and dashboard control) will be used to demonstrate how a microcomputer can be selected for a given application by a combination of classical benchmarking techniques and key feature extraction. 811252.

Recent growth in automotive applications of electronic instrumentation systems has been accompanied by only limited application of similar electronic products in the light truck industry. This paper offers a brief overview of currently used automotive electronic display information systems and discusses the potential adoption of these systems into the light truck/recreational product area.

(SP-505) Microprocessor Controls for Truck and Bus Transmissions. G. W. Schaefer, Detroit Diesel Allison, Div. of General Motors Corp. Controls are the key to meeting increasing transmission and diesel engine performance needs. Customer demands for optimum vehicle performance and rapidly increasing number of differing heavy duty transmission applications are pushing present hydraulic controls to their limits, and require the current controls to be specifically calibrated for the various applications. A microcomputer-based control system can overcome these limitations and also provide performance improvements. Application of the microcomputer for truck and bus transmissions is of considerable interest at this time as it has already been developed for the automobile industry, thus assuring high reliability and a large production base to minimize cost. 811256.

With the increased flexibility in timing it is possible to achieve a better fuel consumption vs. exhaust emissions strategy. With increased timing accuracy the engine is kept closer to the design optimum throughout its life. Through reprogramming at the engine factory, many specifications can be handled with one type of system and inventory. Field testing of the American Bosch microprocessor controlled governors has proven a number of convenient operation and driveability features as well. 811259. Using an Over-the-Road Dynamometer to Test Tractors Equipped with Retarders. Christopher B. Winkler and Paul S. Fancher, Highway Safety Research Institute, The University of Michigan. A mobile dynamometer for measuring the longitudinal force acting at the fifth wheel connection between a tractor and a semitrailer has been developed. The use of this dynamometer for testing retarders installed in tractors is described and example results are presented. Compu- tational methods for predicting total retardation of various vehicles equipped with retarders are discussed. 811260. Safety and Economic Benefits of Heavy Truck Retarder Use. James O'Day and Howard M. Bunch, Highway Safety Research Institute, The Univ. of Michigan. Retarders of various kinds to augment the braking system for trucks and buses can lead to three economic benefits: brake wear may be reduced, so that long-term main- tenance costs will be lower; speed of travel on long downgrades may be increased, leading to shorter total trip time; and the probability of a runaway accident may be reduced, with consequent savings in damage and injury. All of these potential savings depend on the typical trip profile for the vehicle in question. In this paper the likely benefits in reduced brake maintenance, produc- tivity, and accident reduction are computed for a variety of trucking operations, and data are furnished in enough detail to permit a particular user to estimate the value of adding retarders to his vehicles. 811261. Stretching Dollars - The Quantification of Re- tarder Contributions to Truck Productivity. Ge- rald M. Bloom, Chicago Pneumatic Holdings, Ltd.; and William C. Clouspy, The Jacobs Manufacturing Co. Retarders have traditionally been credited with reducing brake maintenance costs of large trucks and lowering trip times. This paper presents methods for quantifying the resulting productivity increases. A Brake Life Extension Factor is developed and shown to increase as retarder horsepower increases. Four common retarder technologies are discussed (exhaust brakes, engine brakes, electric retarders and hydraulic retarders). A method is shown for computing the return on investment in a retarder, based on only the brake maintenance savings, using a dis- counted cash flow analysis. The impact on capital of faster trip times is examined. 811262. Runaway Trucks in Pennsylvania. Roger E. Carrier, Dept. of Transportation, Pittsburgh, PA; and John A. Pachuta, Bureau of Traffic Safety Operations, Department of Transporta- tion, Harrisburg, PA. This paper addresses the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation's efforts to develop runaway truck coun- termeasure programs and facilities. A system has been developed to allocate Pennsylvania's limited highway funding to the most serious problem areas. A summary of Pennsylvania's truck accident experience and a brief analysis of the driver-roadway-vehicle interaction is given. This program is described as it is being implemented in one highway district which has severe grade problems. A specific example of a runaway truck escape facility is described in detail. The design, construction meth- odology, costs, and annual maintenance requirements for this sandpile-type facility are detailed. A full scale trial using a loaded tandem dump truck is described, including films of the trial. Additionally, the field performance of an actual runaway truck facility is given, including details such as the truck penetration into a pile, estimated speed at entry, deceleration performance, truck removal and clean up and reshaping experience. 1981 SA E Transactions 811263. A Downhill Grade Severity Rating System. Walter A. Johnson, Thomas T. Myers, Richard J. DiMarco and R. Wade Allen, Systems Tech- nology, Inc., Hawthorne, CA. A Grade Severity Rating System (GSRS) was developed as a means for reducing the incidence and severity of truck accidents on down-grades. The ultimate result is a roadside sign at the top of each hill. The sign is tailored to the individual hill and gives a recommended maximum speed (to be held constant for the entire grade descent) for each of several truck weight ranges. This concept represents a major step forward in terms of grade descent safety because it tells the driver what to do directly, rather than giving him information which still requires evalu- ation under different loading conditions. 1981 SA E Transactions 811264.

The Ford Ranger will be a domestically built, small pickup truck engineered to many design objectives typical of a fullsize pickup, yet with four cylinder engine fuel efficiency. Ranger is a full-function on-and-off road pickup truck with a uniquely smooth ride and a capacity to carry up to a 725.7 kg. (1600 lb.) payload.

The Isuzu P'UP - Fully Remodeled Small Pickup Truck. Eiichi Yoshihashi, Tokuro Yamamura and Mutsuaki Hagi, Isuzu Motors Ltd. The P'UP has been on the markets world-wide since 1972, both in Japan and overseas, including for the U.S., in which case, with model designation as the Chevrolet LUV. In 1980, for the first time since its market introduction, it was fully remodeled with detail improvements reflected thereon in every aspect. This new model continues to be on the U.S. market as the Chevrolet LUV as it has been, but, beginning from spring of 1981, the similar model has been introduced to the market by the American Isuzu Motors Inc. (AIMI) as the Isuzu P'UP. Taking this opportunity, a diesel version has been added to its model lineup. The diesel engine mounted on this version features its 20 to 30% better fuel efficiency over its gasoline counterpart. In the first half of this paper, the engineering concepts of its full remodeling and their on-vehicle reflection will be introduced. In the last half, we will introduce the specifications and performance of a diesel version which has been developed with its engineering concepts of the attainment of any easy handling and performance well comparable to a gasoline version. 811272. (SP-504) Bus Design Trends in the U.K. A Plea for Simplicity. Alan Townsin, Basingstoke, Hants, U.K. Whole-life costing techniques are underlining the virtues of heavier-duty vehicles and components. The double- decker, still representing over 60% of the annual intake of vehicles for multi-stop service, seems likely to remain dominant despite recent challenges. Trends in legislation, especially that of international origin, tend to increase complexity and hence both cost and weight, but there is a strong case for a revival of the traditional virtues of simplicity, efficiency - especially in regard to fuel consumption - and weight-saving. 811273. (SP-504) A Transit Bus for the 90's. H. H. Buckel and J. H. Steffen, Booz, Allen &amp; Hamilton, Transportation Consulting Div., Be- thesda, MD. Since the motor bus evolved from the automobile as a public transit vehicle the design has tended toward larger, more efficient, more productive and thus less costly buses. This trend was suspended in the 1960's and reversed in the 1970's by new model introductions that heavily stressed passenger amenities and the aesthetic value of the bus. These buses were the result of not only a perceived market change but Federal Government regulation and involve- ment in bus design. Procurement and operating costs increased on these buses while availability and produc- tivity decreased. The inherent cost increase and ineffi- ciencies of these vehicles were amplified by the extraor- dinary inflation and fuel price increases of the 1970's. The Government is now freeing the transit industry of many regulatory burdens and reducing monetary sub- sidies at a time when the competition in the manufac- turing industry is reaching an unparalleled level. These conditions will require and allow transit operators to procure less costly, more fuel efficient, more productive vehicles. Productivity of the driver and bus will be improved by reconfiguration of the vehicle to increase passenger capacity and the speed of transit. The fuel efficiency of buses will improve by elimination of many passenger amenities as standard equipment, a substantial reduction of vehicle weight and use of more efficient power plants. Production and operating costs reductions will be attained by increased use of proven truck systems and improved reliability and access of components. 1981 SA E Transactions 811274. (SP-504) Articulated Scania Bus Built on the Standard BRI 12 Chassis. Bengt Palmér, Scania- Bussar AB, Katrineholm, Sweden. 165</page><page sequence="147">811275-811283 In the articulated Scania bus built on the standard BRI 12 chassis, the engine is transversely mounted at the extreme rear. The bus is of the "pusher" type and the power unit drives the rigid rear axle. The articulated joint is designed so that no special actuating system is necessary under normal conditions. However, a control system is provided for coping with abnormal situations. In view of the fact that the same chassis is used for two-axle buses, double- deckers and articulated buses, it has been possible to apply a high degree of standardisation to the components and the service work has been appreciably simplified. It is also easier for the drivers to handle the different types of buses. 1981 SA E Transactions 811275. (SP-504) Application of Engineered Materials for Innovative Bus Design. Deane N. Aboudara and Michael Krieg, Plastics Business Operations, General Electric Co. This paper will discuss several approaches one firm has successfully used in the application of engineered mate- rials to meet objectives set forth by the user industry to provide equipment responsive to rider demands and operator requirements. The contents are not exhaustive because the technology is one of rapid growth, but the intent is to show where, given an opportunity, innovation can be rewarding to the supply industry, the manufac- turer, the operator and the rider. 811276. (SP-504) The M.A.N. Articulated Bus. Joseph R. Karner and George E. Pickett, M.A.N. Truck &amp; Bus Corp. Sharp increases in operating costs in recent years have caused transit authorities to look for relief through higher bus driver productivity. Use of high-capacity buses can result in increased driver productivity. An important evaluation of nearly 400 high-capacity articulated buses has been underway in cities across the United States since 1978. Some results of that evaluation are now available, and a significant expansion of the nation's articulated bus fleet is underway. This paper discusses the history of the articulated bus, the results of the evaluation of M.A.N. articulated buses in the U.S., and the M.A.N. program for expansion of articulated bus service in the U.S. 811277. (SP-504) Bus Transmission Design for Optimum Fuel Economy. Gavin Martin, Martin Trans- mission Developments Ltd., Alcester, Warwick- shire, England. Controlled tests undertaken by the Scottish Bus Group show that under the same conditions of service one model of diesel-engined bus may use 25 per cent more than another of the same weight and passenger capacity. One bus may use 17 per cent more than another having the same engine but a different type of transmission. This paper discusses aspects of power train design which can produce such variations in fuel usage. These include the transmission efficiency of driveline components, the working regime presented to the engine, standstill and parasitic losses and the kinetic energy entrained in rotating components. Differences observed between serv- ice and test bed (i.e. steady state) results with turbo- charged engines are referred to and brief reference is made to systems which aim to recover and conserve the kinetic energy of the vehicle when it stops. 811278. (SP-504) Bus Rebuilding Defined and Cost Justified. J. Bass Dyer, Pacific Bus Rebuilders, Inc. Bus rebuilding, as a specific business, has matured quickly. There are many definitions, or interpretations, of the meaning of bus rebuilding. It is a cost effective alternative to avoiding delays in obtaining new buses and for reducing capital expenditures. Future bus design can be improved by reviewing the findings and repairs of bus rebuilders. 811280. (SP-504) A Bus for Denver's Mall. William A.

The bus is designed for frequent stop, low speed service in a downtown pedestrian environment. It features a very low floor and multiple wide doors for rapid passenger boarding and deboarding. Two versions will be supplied for comparative evaluation, a low noise diesel configuration and a battery-electric configuration. Either version can subsequently be converted to the alternative propulsion system. 811281. (SP-504) The FFG Telebus II- Specially De- signed to Give Greater Mobility to the Disabled. O. W. O.

Its design allows for all kind of problems in connection with wheel chair drivers. The main charac- teristics being a vehicle body which can be lowered to road level so that disabled passengers can enter the car via a front resp. lateral right hand door without outside help. Special restraint systems for wheel chairs as well as special purpose seats for the disabled are standard equipment. The vehicle has a self-supporting superstructure, inde- pendent air suspension and is powered by a transverse rear 65 kW Diesel engine with automatic transmission. 811283.

Kessler, Grumman Olson, A Division of Grum- man Allied Industries, Inc.; and Saul Ferdman, 166</page><page sequence="148">811284-811301 Grumman Allied Industries, Inc. An electric truck development was undertaken by Grum- man Allied Industries to prepare for the markets of the 1980's. Grumman has built 150,000 aluminum truck bodies and is using this technology to create a light weight vehicle to assist in the national goal of reducing foreign oil imports. The first year's experience produced the lesson of what not to do. A redesigned unitized, all aluminum body and a new propulsion system resulted in the desired vehicle. The vehicle meets the requirements of the U.S. Postal Service and the DOE Demonstration program. This paper describes the development program to meet Grumman's goal of placing a truly utilitarian and serviceable vehicle that will readily meet customer acceptance. The unitized chassisless structure is designed to take major driving loads. Design features and performance characteristics are enumerated. Safety and service con- siderations have been incorporated into the vehicle. 811284. Four Wheel Drive Mobility for New Class of Light Trucks. Dennis W. Shea, Dana Corp., Vehicular Technical Center. Anticipating that population growth during the next decade will continue to spread into suburban areas strengthens the belief that there will be an increasing need for a significant portion of that population to rely on personal and commercial transportation to maintain a high level of mobility. The now recognized trend toward lighter fuel efficient vehicles mandates that such an automotive market be served by improving on-road mobility of such vehicles particularly during construction periods and/or in in- clement weather. This paper will discuss one method of achieving that mobility. 811285. A Fuel Efficient Automatic Four-Speed Trans- mission for Light Trucks. R. J. Green, Chevrolet Engineering Dept. One phase of the broad General Motors program to improve fuel economy has been the design of an integral 4-speed automatic transmission that improves mileage in light trucks. This new overdrive unit features wide ratio gearing with 4-speeds and reverse from 2 planetary gear sets, a converter clutch assembly, a variable capacity oil pump and extensive use of aluminum. Unique construc- tion of several components produces a compact trans- mission that weighs only two pounds more than the 3-speed unit is replaces. 1981 SAE Transactions 811286. Driver Eye Height and Sight Distance on Vertical Curves. Eugene I. Farber, Ford Motor Co. Analyses were performed to determine the sensitivity of stopping sight distance on vertical curves to driver eye height and other parameters entering into the stopping sight-distance equations. Sight distance was found to be relatively insensitive to eye height. On a given hill crest, sight distance for a driver whose eye height is 6-inches lower than the design eye height (3.75 ft) is only 5% less than the design sight distance. On the other hand, stopping distance is very sensitive to travel speed, pavement friction and reaction time. For example, a 1.8 mph decrease in speed reduces stopping distance by the same amount that a 6-inch decrease in eye height reduces sight distance. Also, sight distance is about 2.5 times more sensitive to obstacle height than eye height. It is argued that reductions in travel speed since the introduction of the 55-mph speed limit compensate for any recent or projected decreases in driver eye height. In addition, because the hazard posed by a 6-inch high obstacle is dubious, it is suggested that vertical curves designed for that obstacle height probably incorporate a considerable safety factor. 811288. Wet Disc Brakes for Off-Highway Vehicles. Vincent M. Stempien, Rockwell International. Many of the brake applications for off-highway vehicles require the brake to operate in a hostile environment such as mud slurries or abrasive dust. While the drum and disc type brakes available today can perform the stopping function of a brake, they may not provide the low maintenance or long life required in some environmental extremes. A wet disc brake, however, can perform the stopping function as well as provide the required life because it is completely sealed from the operating environment. This paper describes the major design features and the development of the Rockwell wet disc brake. 811301. (P-99) Research and Development Challenges in the Automobile Industry. Paul F. Chenea, The General Motors Research Laboratories, Warren, MI. Scientists and engineers engaged in automotive research and development face more challenges today than ever before in making vehicles lighter and more fuel efficient while maintaining safety and comfort. Vehicle structural mechanics plays a vital part in these efforts. Researchers are challenged to improve existing materials and develop new stronger and lighter materials. Computer-aided design techniques assist in downsizing and redesigning vehicles. Research is aimed at making gasoline and diesel engines even more fuel efficient and at developing alternate engines. In manufacturing, increasingly sophis- ticated robots and automation are improving productivity and quality. In all of these efforts research management is challenged to establish the appropriate balance between short-term and long-term corporate research strategies. 167</page><page sequence="149">811302-811306 811302. (P-99) Design of Thin Walled Columns for Crash Energy Management - Their Strength and Mode of Collapse. H. F. Mahmood and A. Paluszny, Ford Motor Co. The problem of determining the theoretical load capacity or strength limits of a thin wall, axially compressed column is mathematically complex. Local instability phenomena that precede structural collapse and the mechanism of collapse add to the complexity. In this paper, a semi-empirical approach is considered in devel- oping design aids for sheet metal box column subjected to axial crush. Various stages of collapse are identified and crush characteristics pertinent to column design are quantified. Both are related to section geometry, column length and the material properties. The size of wave length (fold) is determined and its influence on the folding behavior of rectangular column is discussed. Design equations and charts for sizing thin wall structural elements for crush are presented. Those design aids can be implemented into finite element beam-column codes for study of crash behavior of structural systems. 1981 SA E Transactions 811303. (P-99) Energy Absorption of Channel Beams during Gross Deformation. P. W. Sharman, Dept. of Transport Technology, Loughborough Univ. of Technology (U.K.). The results of experiments to determine the energy absorbed by aluminium alloy channel sections when loaded with combined compression and bending causing gross deformation, plasticity and fracture are described. The lateral-torsional mode of buckling caused a radical redistribution of stress leading to large tensile strains developing in the initially compressed flange. Provided the material is able to flow, the energy absorbed showed a smooth monotonie increase with increasing deformation, therefore suitable for crashworthy struc- tures. A predictive method is outlined based on a coarse finite element division used in a non-linear program accounting for the finite rotations and plasticity. 811304. (P-99) A General Purpose Analytical Technique for Nonlinear Dynamic Response of Integrated Structures. C. M. Ni, Engineering Mechanics Dept., General Motors Research Labs. This paper is concerned with a general purpose analytical technique and an associated computer program, "NONDRIS," for analyzing the nonlinear dynamic response of integrated structures. The "NONDRIS" program includes beam, plate, spring (or truss), and rigid-body elements in its element library. This analytical technique has been developed for dealing with the linear and nonlinear dynamic response of both a single struc- tural component and a multiple-member structural sys- tem, with special emphasis on the crash response of vehicle structures. An effective finite difference scheme modified for irregular mesh has been applied for developing the beam and plate elements. Geometric and material nonlinearities like strain-rate sensitivity and strain-hardening are in- cluded. A nonlinear spring element and a rigid-body element with six degrees of freedom are also included to form this general purpose analytical technique. The validity of this analytical technique is illustrated in three example problems analyzed with the "NONDRIS" program. The three example problems include: 1) the vehicle barrier impact response at 48 km/h; 2) the oblique impact response of a two-dimen- sional framed structural system; and 3) the in-plane crush response of an integrated beam and plate structure. In all three problems, very reasonable correlations between analysis and experiment have been observed. 811305. (P-99) Evaluation of Structural Strength Capac- ity of Bus Body Structures. Frank Monasa and Timothy Chipman, Dept. of Civil Engineering, Michigan Technological Univ., Houghton, MI. For severe frontal and side impact loads, the passenger compartment of small buses does not retain its initial geometry, and plastic deformations are inevitable. There- fore, linear analysis alone is insufficient for the analysis and an elasto-plastic analysis technique for evaluating the structural strength capacity and the inelastic deformation characteristics must be considered. A three-dimensional mathematical model of the passenger compartment was prepared using the finite element simulation method. A three-dimensional elasto-plastic structural analysis was developed along with a computer program, named EPSAP, to evaluate the structural strength capacity of the passenger compartment under quasi-static loading con- ditions. The procedure provides a technique for: (1) tracing the load-displacement history of a space frame structure, (2) determining the collapse or the ultimate load, (3) predicting the collapse mode, and (4) evaluating the energy absorption capacity. 811306. (P-99) Finite Element Crash Analysis of a Rear-Engine Automobile. Robert Winter, Morton Mantus and Allan B. Pifko, Grumman Aerospace Corp., Bethpage, NY. A finite element model of a rear-engine automobile having a fiberglass-reinforced resin body, was created and examined in a 30 mph frontal barrier impact analysis using the DYCAST nonlinear structural dynamic finite element computer code. Detailed results were produced, including load paths, material failures, and behavior of individual components, permitting an assessment of vehicle crash performance. A proposed energy-absorbing concept was evaluated and recommendations were made for specific structural improvements. 168</page><page sequence="150">811307-811312 811307. (P-99) Dynamic Loads on Suspension Compo- nents Using Mechanisms Programs. Fanis Giannopoulos and Anantha K. Rao, Structural Analysis Dept., Ford Motor Co. A method is described for employing general purpose mechanisms programs to predict the loads induced in the suspension systems of ground vehicles traversing rough terrains. The mechanisms representation employed ac- counts for geometric non-linearities of the kinematics as well as the material non-linearities of the tire, shock absorbers, and rubber bushings, but neglecting the compliance of the body structure which is treated as a rigid link. Dynamic loads obtained using this procedure can serve as input to detailed finite element models of vehicle components for stress analysis. 811308. (P-99) Large Deflection and Impact Performance of Reinforced Polyurethane Foam Beams. M. L. A. Gaafar and G. H. Tidbury, School of Automotive Studies, Cranfield Institute of Tech- nology (Cranfield, Bedford, England). The theoretical and experimental bending performance of rigid skin polyurethane foam beams, reinforced with thin walled steel sections, was investigated. The aim was to provide design data for the prediction of vehicle structures made of this composite material during accidents. The theoretical treatment assumes an interfacial shear between the core and the faces of the reinforcement. This method gave good agreement with experimental results when the errors due to cantilever support movements were quantified. It also represents a good basis for an inelastic analysis beyond the yield point of the reinforcement which was also developed. The inelastic analysis also showed good agreement with experimental results. A simple optimisation of the reinforcement geometry based on the experimental data was made. This showed that, for uniaxial bending, the composite beams can be made lighter than the lightest rectangular tube made of the same steel and with the same width to depth ratio. Impact tests showed that the behaviour of composite beams is similar for both static and dynamic loading up to the maximum impact speed tested (10 m/secs). 1981 SAE Transactions 811309. (P-99) Finite Element Analysis of Viscoelastic Elastomeric Structures Vibrating about Non- Linear Statically Stressed Configurations. K. N. Morman, Jr. and B. G. Kao, Ford Motor Co.; and J. C. Nagtegaal, MARC Analysis Research Corp. This paper concerns the finite element method as applied to the analysis of small oscillations about the non-linear equilibrium position in elastomeric components. The capability, which was developed at Ford, has been implemented in the general-purpose finite element pro- gram, MARC. The material behavior is treated by use of a modified form of the constitutive equations derived by Lianis [Proc. Fourth International Congress on Rheology, Pt. 2, 109 (1965)] using the finite linear viscoelasticity theory of Coleman and Noll [Rev. Mod. Phys., 33 239 (1961)]. In order to establish numerical accuracy, program predictions are compared with a closed form solution for the torsional and axial vibrations in a cylinder under axial and twisting pre-loads: differences between the finite element solutions and exact results are less than two (2) percent. The measured static force deflection response and dynamic stiffness k*( = k, + jk^ of two automotive components used for vibration attenuation and isolation purposes is shown to be in good agreement with the theoretical predictions. 811311. (P-99) Computer Study of Material and Prestrain Effects on Bumper Damageability. S. C. Tang and P. Beardmore, Ford Motor Co. An analytical procedure has been developed to evaluate the relative damageability of a bumper with respect to the geometrical and material properties by means of a nonlinear thin shell computer program as reported at the last VSM conference. The analysis has been extended to determine the effects of various high strength steels with different prestrains on bumper damageability since the fabrication procedure will induce varying degrees of prestrain in the finished bumper. The effect of prestrain is particularly important for dual phase steels because of the lower initial yield to tensile strength ratio of these materials. The analysis was carried out for three types of steels of potential use for bumpers, namely SAE 950X, SAE 980X and DP 980. The relative damageability of bumpers in these steels was evaluated analytically for various levels of prestrains. These computer results can furnish some guidelines to designers selecting high strength steels for bumper material where weight reduc- tion is an important criterion. 811312. (P-99) Program "West" for Optimization of Rectangular and Square Section Tubes from the Safety Point of View. Dušan Kecman, Motor Vehicles Dept., Faculty of Mechanical Engi- neering (Belgrade, Yugoslavia). A desk top computer program has been developed to enable selection of the lightest or cheapest standard or non-standard section tubes meeting the following safety criteria: maximum bending strength, energy absorbed and remaining strength after a given hinge rotation angle. It also enables selection of minimum material properties if section dimensions and the target safety performance are specified. The program can also produce bending collapse properties of given sections which may be further used either directly in design, or as input data to finite element programs for collapse analysis. The theory on which the program is based was verified by an extensive experi- mental work on tubes and complete structures. 1981 SAE Transactions 169</page><page sequence="151">811313-811318 811313. (P-99) Application of Modal Modeling and Mount System Optimization to Light Duty Truck Ride Analysis. Alan E. Duncan, Chevrolet Motor Div., General Motors Corp. A basic review of vehicle modal modeling techniques is presented and applied to determine the vibrational shake characteristics of a light duty pickup truck subjected to tire force variation and random road surface dynamic loads. Comparisons of natural vibration frequencies and random road response between a prototype pickup and the vehicle model are presented to establish the level of correlation. A computer optimization technique is applied to tune the body, engine, and transmission mount system of the vehicle model until the vibration levels are minimized. Simultaneous reduction in road and tire induced vibration response of the model is achieved. 1981 SA E Transactions 811314. (P-99) Shape Optimization of Sheet Metal Structures against Crash. Ture Äkerström and Cias Jernström, Volvo Car Corp. (Göteborg, Sweden); and Tomasz Wierzbicki, Institute of Fundamental Technological Research (Warsaw, Poland). The crushing behavior of axially compressed short thin-walled open-section columns was studied. Results of model tests on 0.1 mm thick aluminum foil specimens have shown that the panels collapsing in the symmetric and asymmetric deformation mode provide respectively, upper and lower bound for the energy absorbed in any other buckling mode. In both cases, the crush response of the panel was predicted theoretically with a reasonable accuracy. Attempts were made to introduce beneficial geometric imperfections of a specified magnitude so that the structure will be forced to collapse in the most energy efficient deformation mode. 1981 SA E Transactions 811315. (P-99) Some Considerations in Efficient Design of Light Weight Structures. B. Prasad, Ford Motor Co. Digital computers are being used in many engineering activities to support design work. The process is complex and direct use of the design and analysis programs often results in large design costs and time. The paper provides some potentially useful schemes for reducing such cost in designing structures. The schemes are based on the concepts of element and cross-section idealizations while maintaining the characteristics of the load path. An example of a double layer reinforced panel is given and it is shown how these schemes can lead to increased flexibility and reduced cost in obtaining minimum weight designs. 811316. (P-99) OPUS: A Programming System Approach to Structural Optimization. Michael L. Adel- berg, Richard I. DeVries, Zissis A. Moschovidis and Leo Razgunas, Structural Analysis Dept., Ford Motor Co. OPUS (Optimization Process Utility System) is a general purpose structural design optimization program suitable for application to an extended range of problems common to vehicle design. OPUS, based on a programming system concept, interfaces several optimization algorithms with a variety of both in-house and proprietary structural analysis code, including MSC/NASTRAN, ADAMS, SAP3, and MOTRAN. OPUS permits a completely arbitrary objective function and constraints; moreover, any parameter governing the definition of a structural model can be used as a design variable. Applications of OPUS, including a geometric optimization for minimum deflection of a torque converter cover, are described. 811317. (P-99) Integrated Panel and Skeleton Automo- tive Structural Optimization. H. Miura, NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA; R. V. Lust and J. A. Bennett, Engineering Me- chanics Dept., General Motors Research Labs. Previous work in structural optimization for the auto- motive structure has been limited to beam models of the major load-carrying structure. This was primarily done to reduce the amount of computer resources required to minimize the mass. In this study, techniques necessary to include a moderately complex representation of the panels are developed in which some compromises between model fidelity and solution time must be accepted. As an example, plate elements have been included in a vehicle structural optimization model to represent the roof, floor, dash, motor compartment, and rear quarter. Minimum mass designs subjected to stress, displacement, and frequency constraints are obtained by structural optimization. It was found that most panels were at minimum gage in the optimum design. This suggests that these panels are designed by local criteria as opposed to being controlled by global load and stiffness criteria. A few panels in the highly stressed areas are affected by the global load conditions and should be included in this portion of the optimization. 811318. (P-99) Structural Optimization in the Design Environment. R. V. Lust and J. A. Bennett, Engineering Mechanics Dept., General Motors Research Labs. Since the introduction of structural optimization as a tool in the automotive structural design process, a considerable body of experience has been obtained in its practical application to automotive design. It is the purpose of this paper to illustrate this experience by means of several structural optimization examples of the basic load- carrying skeleton and a more detailed model of a panel 170</page><page sequence="152">811319-811323 structure. A complex comparative configuration study will be presented which considers several alternative config- urations for front structures. The results of this study indicate that the redundancy of load paths in the automotive structure will allow reduced load capacity in one part of the structure to be compensated for in some other load path. In many cases, alternative configurations may produce approximately equal optimum mass struc- tures. It is concluded that structural optimization offers a unique ability to give high-quality design direction in the early phases of the structural design. 811319.

A study of the cost effectiveness of minicomputers vs. main frames for structural analysis programs is described. The study compares the performance of several finite element programs including SAP IV and SPAR. Most of the runs were performed with the Illinois Institute of Technology PRIME 400 minicomputer and the United Computing System UNIVAC 1100/81 main frame. Other computers were used selectively. The matrix of structural problems included beam, plate and shell problems and static, dynamic and nonlinear analysis. 811320. (P-99) Generic Modeling Procedure for Complex Component Design. H. T. Kulkami and B. Prasad, Research, Ford Motor Co.; and J. F. Emerson, Information Systems Design, Santa Clara, CA. The generation and modification of detailed finite element models necessary to examine the effects of component shape on stresses and/or deflections, is expensive and time consuming. Alternatively, generic modeling techniques offer the potential advantage of substantially reducing the model modification time by controlling the geometry through a finite set of design parameters. This paper describes a systematic generic modeling procedure for creating such models that can be linked with an analysis runstream. Engineering Analysis Language features are used to develop this procedure. The technique is applied to the evaluation of: (i) a wheel with variation in the spider design (spokes, no-spokes, bolt radius, etc.); and (ii) different roof designs for a vehicle. The results of these numerical experiments are discussed to demonstrate the importance of the technique in the design evaluation of similar components. 811321.

Kline, Mechanical Engineering Dept., Wayne State Univ., Detroit, MI; and R. B. Katnik, J. K. Partyka and M. F. Kowalski, Chevrolet Engi- neering Center, Warren, MI. An enhanced version of a BIEM computer code was evaluated and applied to analyses of automotive structural components. The code was improved to provide a check on the geometry of individual segments, allow double precision calculations and include such "user friendly features" as simplified I/O, calculation of principal and von Mises stresses, and a check on the accuracy of solution. Construction of BIE models was facilitiated by developing an interface with IMAGE (Chevrolet Engi- neering's interactive graphics program). Stress output data was made more manageable by utilizing the MOVIE.BYU graphics package to allow presentation of stress contours. Most importantly, spill logic was used to add an out-of-core solution capability and thus allow treatment of complex models. In addition to discussion of numerical results relating to questions of transition elements, aspect ratios, CPU time and accuracy, the paper presents analysis of a bearing cap based on a 713 node model and a refined 948 node model. 811322.

Algorithms are presented that utilize isoparametric shape functions to express the refined mesh boundary dis- placements as a function of the coarse mesh displace- ments. Stress concentration factors for two common stress raisers are calculated, using both methods, and compared to accepted values. 1981 SA E Transactions 811323. (P-99) Viscoelastic Loss Characteristics of Cord Rubber Composites. Farhad Tabaddor, BF Goodrich Co., Akron, OH; and Samuel K. Clark, Univ. of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI. Mechanical energy loss, in automobile tires, as well as other products made of cord reinforced rubber compos- ites, is a major source of energy consumption. To minimize the energy loss, it is essential to increase the understanding of the way in which internal losses in a composite depend on the loss characteristics of the constituents used to fabricate it. In this paper, the application of the viscoelasticity theory in predicting the loss characteristics is discussed in detail. The scope and the limitations of the linear theory, the relations between the effective loss characteristics and constituents' prop- erties, and the numerical methods for predicting the loss moduli are discussed. Some numerical results are pre- sented. 171</page><page sequence="153">811324-811328 811324. (P-99) Mechanical Integrity of Ceramic Mono- lithic Converters. Suresh T. Gulati and Vimal K.

The process to effect this assembly is rather dynamic and introduces directional loads onto the monolith in view of the anisotropic stiffness of the can. If these loads exceed certain values, they may cause failure of the monolith either by crushing it or by shearing it. In this paper we analyze the stiffness of various components of converter assembly, determine the load distribution around the monolith, and modify the design of can and monolith to make the load distribution more favorable. It is concluded that the converter assembly can be optimized and the failure of monoliths, if any, eliminated during closure. The present monoliths do not suffer from such failure. 811325. (P-99) Kinematic Analysis of Tripode Joint. Junzo Hasegawa, Fumio Matsunari and Toshiaki Ikeda, Toyota Central Research &amp; Development Labs., Inc.; and Yoshisumi Futamura, Toyota Motor Company Ltd. (Ja- pan). Tripode Joints are said to be Constant Velocity Joints, but in actual employment, they have some velocity fluctu- ation. Analysis was made of the effects of the twist of the intersecting planes, 120° dividing errors and deviation of the pitch radius on the velocity fluctuation and the joint design. Instead of the conventional tripode joints with half side variable pitch radius (HVPR) profile, the tripode joints with both side variable pitch radius (BVPR) profile have been proposed, which remarkably reduce velocity fluctuation and provide more design freedom. 811326. (P-99) A Structural Analysis Design Procedure for Truck Mounted Refrigeration Unit Frame Assemblies. Herman H. Viegas, Thermo King Corp., Minneapolis, MN; and David L. Peder- son, Environmental Services, Inc., Minneapolis, MN. A structural analysis procedure using shock spectra loading has been used as a design tool for truck and trailer mounted refrigeration unit frames. The units experience shock and vibration from highway, rail and ship trans- portation. The loading information has been obtained from a thorough investigation by NASA of transportation loading in cargo areas. The procedure consists of com- puting stresses in the frames with a finite element model. Both the static equivalent load method and the response spectrum method have been used. The static equivalent load method consists of using the peak acceleration value multiplied by 1.5 to account for dynamic amplification. The response spectrum method selects the acceleration load according to the frequency domain and combines stresses based on the square root of the sum of the squares (SRSS) rule for modes and directional components. 811327. (P-99) Theoretical and Practical Analysis of the Failure of the Chinese Bus Bodies. Tien-Tzai Hwang, Jilin Univ. of Technology (Changchun, Jilin, PRC). Based upon the analysis results of static and dynamic tests about the bus bodies, simple and practical calculating methods are suggested by the author for estimating the posts design criteria~the minimum section modulus (Wmin) of side window posts and the minimum moment of inertia (Imin) of the passenger door posts. After calculating several kinds of buses according to the above-mentioned methods, we can find out that the section modulus and the moment of inertia of most bus body posts all satisfy the ability of the posts to withstand its load. The phenomena of premature cracking of the bus body posts shows that the action of the torsional rigidity of chassis frames must be taken into account. 811328. (P-99) Thermal Transient Analysis of Disk Brake Problems Concerning a Mathematical Model. A. Garro, E. Gavello and F. Rossi, FIAT AUTO S.p.A., Direzione Tecnica, Sviluppo Progetti. Thermal transient analysis is considered, in the present paper, as a favourable approach for a better understand- ing of the phenomena related to thermal exchange into a disk brake: the definition of transient thermal fields is supposed to allow, through iterative methods, a more precise definition of the heat affected physical properties of the materials involved in the component. Both experimental test, or mathematical modelling were used and found suitable to define the evolving boundary conditions along a full braking cycle. The choice of the actual approach appeared anyway linked to the possibility of a precise scanning of the thermal behaviour of the surface of the disk, its deformation and of the instability conditions occuring at the pad-disk interface. Moreover the boundary conditions, in continuous evolution with the vehicle speed, depend on the sur- rounding environment and on the wheel geometry and cannot be considered as steady ones. The mathematical model was consequently set up gathering all the variables and assuring their evolution with the heat generation of the disk and the heat-exchange to the environment; the model was also allowed to modify, at each integration step, the pad-disk interface conditions and consequently rearrange heat generation data. The large size of this mathematical model is affecting its operation cost to the point of avoiding its routinary use, but its accuracy justifies its application in phenomeno- logical studies. 172</page><page sequence="154">811340-811349 811340. (P-100) The Effects of Absorbed Water Upon the Properties of a Sheet Molding Compound. C. David Shirrell, General Motors Research Lab- oratories. The Static mechanical properties of a R25 SMC at 21 °C were observed to increase as the moisture content increases from 0 to 0.2%. Above this moisture content, the static mechanical properties began to decrease slightly. Water immersion caused other effects to R25 SMC than just those observed with exposure to high relative humidity environments. The moisture sorption process can best be described by Fickian diffusion theory. However, non-Fickian anomalies were observed in high humidity environments. The relationship between equilibrium moisture content and relative humidity can be described by an exponental function. The absorbed moisture induces a slight swelling in SMC. 1981 SA E Transactions 811342. (P-100) Durability of Rubber Modified SMC. Roy W. Siedenstrang, Phillips Chemical Co., Stow, OH. A carboxylated butadiene-styrene elastomer has been developed as a low profile modifier for polyester resins used in sheet molding compounds. The elastomeric modifier will provide Class A surfaces with low long-term waviness, energy absorbing characteristics and zero shrinkage. Especially outstanding results are obtained when molding large, thin, flat panels such as roof, door, hood and tailgate panels from rubber modified SMC. Surface appearance properties are subjective, but prop- erties such as radial bend, tension testing, high impact and reverse impact tests are shown to demonstrate the energy absorbing and toughening characteristics imparted by the modifier. 811344. (P-100) Viscoelastic Properties of SMC Com- posites. Frederick A. Myers, Armco Research Center, Middle town, OH. The subject of the viscoelastic response of SMC type composites is discussed. Examples are presented illus- trating the influence of material composition on the dynamic mechanical shear moduli, G' and G"", and tan o = G ~"/G' . The concept of time/temperature super- position is applied to the dynamic mechanical data and master curves constructed. Torque retention problems on bolt attached SMC components are shown to be asso- ciated with the viscoelastic behavior of the materials. 811345. (P-100) Effect of Heat, Loading, and Moisture on the Durability of Fiber Composites. Richard E. Robertson, Ford Motor Co., Dearborn, MI. The purpose of this report is to describe the results of a program to determine how fiber composite materials behave when subjected to a combination of heat, mois- ture, and shear loads. A feature of the program was the design of a relatively simple fixture for uniformly applying a shear stress to fiber composite specimens by short beam flexure. In the current program, various fiber composites have been subjected to the temperature of 50-55°C, immersion in deionized water, and a load initially equal to roughly one-half the load that would cause shear failure at room temperature. Heat, loading, and moisture each have a deleterious effect on the durability of fiber composites. But no synergism of moisture and load was found in which the degradation of strength was greater than the sum of the individual effects. 811347. (P-100) Structure Characterization of Sheet Molding Compound Composites. Han Nyo and F. A. Myers, Armco Research Center, Middle- town, OH. The morphological properties of SMC, BMC and cast polyester sheets (CPS) have been investigated with the intent of characterizing the major components affecting properties. Scanning electron microscopy shows that SMC, BMC and CPS have a complex microstructure that are strongly dependent on the formulation, and the type, size, shape and distribution of additives. Dynamic mechanical data was obtained by employing a Rheo- metrics Dynamic Spectrometer. Polarized light micro- scopy techniques were also utilized to examine the structure of the carbon fibers and crystalline polymers. 811348. (P-100) Improving Polyolefin Properties with Butyl. Kish J. Kumbhani and Eric G. Kent, Technical Development Div., Polysar Ltd., Sarnia, Ontario, Canada. Adding small amounts of butyl rubber to polyolefin compositions results in a number of performance im- provements. Polyethylenes containing butyl show im- proved ESCR (environmental stress-cracking resistance) and increased resistance to impact, puncture and tear. In polypropylene, butyl provides improved impact strength at low temperatures. In both types, the butyl rubber improves vapour barrier capabilities, chemical resistance and energy absorptivity. Butyl can also be used with mineral fillers to extend polyolefins without reducing their impact strength or flexibility. Present and potential automotive applications for butyl modified plastics in- clude battery boxes; bumper strips; sponge components; tapes; and protective films. The paper illustrates the improvements gained in the properties of polyolefin compositions through the use of butyl rubber, and presents an evaluation of several mineral fillers (alumina, mica, whiting, talc) in polyolefin compositions. 811349. (P-100) Fatigue Life Prediction for Structural Composites by Acoustic Emission. Lie K. Djiauw and Donald G. Fesko, Plastics Development 173</page><page sequence="155">811350-811359 and Application Office, Ford Motor Co., De- troit, MI. Computer-linked acoustic emission (AE) monitoring instrumentation can record noises associated with crack growth in an FRP component when it is proof tested. Since defects in the part will cause additional noise and noise concentrations, AE data will relate to the structural performance of the part, particularly to the onset of visible damage and to the fatigue life. To obtain good results, AE data collection must be tailored to the geometry of the part and the FRP material, which exhibits high AE signal attenuation characteristics. However, after undergoing sophisticated analysis utilizing source location and atten- uation corrections, acoustic emission of a part can be correlated with fatigue life. 1981 SA E Transactions 811350. (P-100) Relation of Composite Part Strength to Ultrasonic Inspection. Lie K. Djiauw, Plastics Development &amp; Application Office, Ford Motor Co., Dearborn, MI. Although standard conventional ultrasonic testing is capable of indicating defects in composite parts, the lack of quantitative indication of the mechanical strength of the parts and the need to use liquid coupling limits its use in the non-destructive testing of automotive composites. By utilizing soft-tip dry transducers, the efficiency of ultrasonic scanning is greatly improved and ultrasonic measurement can be conducted on composite parts where the use of a liquid coupling medium is objectionable. The through-transmission ultrasonic signal amplitude meas- ured in several automotive FRP samples (SMC) was found to correlate well with the tensile and short-beam shear strength of the samples at the location of failure. Another use of ultrasonic inspection is to determine the critical flaw size for a particular application. The as- sessment of critical flaw size in composites and the merit of using this novel technique for the strength evaluation of FRP composites is discussed. 811352. (P-100) Designing to Avoid Fatigue Failure in Engineering Polymers. M. T. Takemori and T. A. Morelli, General Electric Co., Corporate Research and Development Center. In designing to avoid fatigue failure in polymers, the design engineer is often faced with a Herculean task. For engineering, aesthetic and economic reasons, polymers are marketed in a multitude of compositional and structural variations. Unfortunately, complete (or even partial) fatigue data is seldom available. The design engineer must thus rely on an understanding of the fatigue mechanisms in order to establish meaningful measures of fatigue resistance. An on-going research program on the fatigue behavior of polymers has been conducted in our Labo- ratory. Two examples are discussed in this paper. 811356. (P-100) Resistance of 40% Glass-Reinforced PPS to Automotive Underhood Fluids. J. R. Miller, Cummins Engine Co.; J. S. Dix and V. C. Vives, Phillips Petroleum Co. Laboratory tests have shown that 40% glass-reinforced PPS is suitable for automotive underhood use where it comes into contact with used engine oil, gasoline/alcohol, gasoline/MTBE, water, water/ethylene glycol, hydraulic fluid, and transmission fluid at elevated temperatures. On exposure to water or water/ethylene glycol at 248° F (120°C) and 257°F (125°C), respectively, there is a sharp decline in mechanical strength in the first few weeks with little change thereafter. The residual strength of the 40% glass-reinforced PPS is comparable to, or better than other materials, such as phenolics, which have proved satis- factory in such usage. These results have been translated to successful applications in heavy duty diesel engines. Piston cooling nozzles and water pump impellers made of 40% glass- reinforced PPS have undergone successful engine com- ponent evaluations. 811357. (P-100) Ductile - Brittle Impact Behavior of High Impact ABS. Raymond C. Turner, Borg- Warner Chemicals, Inc., Technical Centre, Washington, WV. The impact behavior of plastic materials can be inves- tigated using a number of test procedures. Falling dart and notched Izod are the two most commonly used tests€ Each has certain limitations. The Notch Bend test utilizes a load cell feeding an oscilloscope to generate a load- deflection curve. From this curve and visual examination of the broken test specimens, it is possible to define the conditions that cause a transition from ductile to brittle impact behavior. Environmental tests performed on a passenger car illustrate the reheat times of an instrument panel from -20° F. The combination of impact testing and reheat data support the use of high impact ABS for critical interior automotive applications. 811359. (P-100) Radial Lip Shaft Seals: Extending Life by Reducing Wear. Douglas A. Cather, Garlock Precision Seal Div., Colt Industries, Inc., Gas- tonia, NC. By applying a P.T.F.E. bearing material to the sealing lip, the life and capabilities of a radial lip shaft seal can be significantly improved. Puddles of oil on driveways, helicopter pads, and shop floors are unattractive and bothersome to consumers, maintenance experts, and design engineers of virtually every mechanical device produced today. To the under- standing observer, this can indicate that a seal's useful life has expired, thus requiring machine shutdown and seal replacement. The scope of this article is limited to radial lip shaft seals. A discussion of the major reasons for seal failure 174</page><page sequence="156">811360-811372 due to excessive lip wear is followed by recommendations to aid the engineer in deciding when P.T.F.E.-lined seals can be beneficial. 811360. (P-100) Short and Long Term Properties of an Impact-Modified Polycarbonate Resin. Mark W. Witman and Kira L. Kamsky, Mobay Chemical Corp., New Martinsville, WV. The low temperature impact performance of an impact- modified polycarbonate was found to be superior to unmodified bisphenol - A polycarbonate in notched Izod and dart impact tests. High strength and ductile failures were observed for the modified grade. Good ductility was maintained after exposure to a variety of potentially hostile environmental parameters such as elevated tem- peratures, humidity and interior and exterior commercial paint systems. The effect of direct Florida exposure on paint adhesion and impact performance was also eval- uated. 811361. (P-100) Structuring Trucks Today and Tomor- row. John M. Jula, General Electric Co., Plastics Operations, Structural Foam Resins Section. The pressure is on for trucks to perform more efficiently, more economically and more safely. Truck design and technology, consequently, must keep pace with today's needs and anticipate future pressures. To do this, many challenges must be faced. Challenges include energy because of high fuel costs, durability because no one can afford downtime caused by vulnerable materials, and new safety standards. Structural foam molding of engineering plastics offers an efficient, economical way to meet these challenges through strong, rigid, large molded parts. 811363. (P-100) HYTREL® Polyester Elastomer for High Performance Flexible Boots. G. L. Zaiser, E. I. Du Pont De Nemours &amp; Co., Inc. The development of a blow-moldable grade of copolyester elastomer and new blow molding techniques has made possible the manufacture of an improved boot seal for rack and pinion steering gears. These blow molded boots offer significant improvement in durability over the rubber material they replace. 811364. (P-100) Surface Quality and Florida Exposure Studies of "RIM" and "RRIM" Materials for Exterior Automotive Applications. B. F. James and R. M. Gerkin, Union Carbide Corp., South Charleston, WV. Surface appearance and long-term durability of coated materials used for exterior automotive applications are key features of their acceptance by the industry. This paper presents data describing the performance of RIM and RRIM urethane elastomers as it relates to both of these important areas. Surface quality of steel, glass and molded SMC were compared with filled and unfilled RIM polymers using an instrument capable of measuring surface profile. Long- term durability was measured by observing the per- formance of panels of RIM and RRIM materials coated with currently acceptable primers and topcoats on exposure for two years in South Florida. Analysis of the data shows that RIM and RRIM materials can be prepared with a surface quality better than that of steel. The data also confirm that coatings applied to these substrates perform very well on long-term exposure in Florida. 811370. (P-98) Australian Auto Industry "New Direction in the 80s", Keynote Address. Lloyd E. Beck, President, SAE Australasia. Even though the population of Australia falls short of the 15 million mark, a startlingly small number when considering its land mass of three million square miles, it supports five car manufacturers and 23 importers of built up vehicles whose combined annual sales volume does not quite reach 500,000 passenger vehicles. This industry is currently controlled and protected by the Australian Government's "Passenger Motor Vehicle Manufacturing Plan" which assures the five manufacturers 80% of the market on the basis that they achieve 85% local content, by value, on a company average basis. From March 1982, a modified plan will introduce a local content complementation scheme which will permit the use of export credits, earned by vehicle and com- ponent manufacturers, to offset the cost of imports. The effects of this scheme are far-reaching and will benefit both the consumer and auto industry by permitting the importation of vehicle components featuring the latest technological advances at economic costs. 811371. (P-98) Achieving Better Solution by Strengthen- ing Communication, Keynote Address. Wiranto Arismunandar, President, IATO (SAE-Indone- sia). The International Pacific Conference on Automotive Engineering may be viewed as reflecting the results of concerted and cooperative efforts and should be noted in the annals of the development of professional organiza- tions. It represents a very encouraging event because it obviously reflects a spirit of friendship and provides excellent opportunity for getting acquainted. Many challenges are to be faced by automotive engineers, researchers, and designers. 811372. (P-98) Social Needs and Automotive Design, Keynote Address. Hiroshi Takahashi, President, SAE of Japan, Inc. Viewing the development of automotive technology historically, we find its beginnings in the spontaneous, original invention of engineers. However, with the 175</page><page sequence="157">811373-811377 progress of motorization, market demand, i.e., consumer needs and preferences, has become steadily more impor- tant. Additionally, social needs, in the form of government regulations on safety and pollution have also become vital elements. In the years since the oil crisis, the growing demand for greater energy conservation and the development of alternative energy sources for the future have become key problems for automotive engineers not only in Japan, but throughout the world. Thus, the demands the times are making upon us are becoming increasingly more diversified. Successfully meeting this challenge will require a far higher level of pooling and sharing from the world's automotive engi- neers. 811373. (P-98) The International Challenge, Keynote Address. Philip J. Mazziotti, President, SAE- USA. The information presented herein deals with four general areas including: (1) Trends in vehicle design as influenced by government regulations, fuel economy, and consumer preference; (2) Critical issues which will impact on vehicle industry in this decade; (3) International implications of technology development; and (4) Local or regional problems that might benefit from international consid- erations. Each is discussed in detail in addition to concluding remarks dealing with the present-day challenges facing the engineer. 811374. (P-98) Which Would be Better, the S.I or C.I Engine, from the View Point of Fuel Consump- tion? Shin Matsuoka and Hidenori Tasaka, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan. First, by means of the cycle theory the comparison study was made on the basic concept of fuel consumption in pre-mixed-homogeneous cycle and stratified-charge-het- erogeneous cycle. In the next, the practical data of efficiency in both engines are compared and the differ- ences arising on efficiency and that causing reasons discussed basically on the view point of theory of cycle and combustion. Some suggestive conclusions were introduced as follows. 1. Specific heat of gas during combustion is one of the most influenciai factors on efficiency. 2. The efficiency at low load in pre-mixed cycle is higher theoretically and practically lower than that operated at full load. 3. If the lean homogeneous rapid combustion is attained, the efficiency will be dramatically high. 4. The efficiency at low load in stratified charge cycle is higher theoretically and practically than that operated at full load. 5. Stratified charge or C • I cycle has advantage in efficiency if pre-mixed-lean-mixture rapid combustion is unattainable in practice. 6. A new hybrid concept of S • I and C • I engines is proposed as a total conclusion of this discussion. 1981 SA E Transactions 811375. (P-98) Smokeless, Low NOx, and Low Noise Diesel Combustion with Methanol as a Main Fuel. Takemi Chikahisa, Noboru Miyamoto and Tadashi Murayama, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, Hokkaido Univ., Sapporo, Japan. In order to obtain improved combustion of methanol in a dual fuel diesel engine, both methanol and gas oil as an auxiliary fuel were injected into a pre-combustion cham- ber. The effects of proportion and timing of the auxiliary fuel injection, and the main injection timing on the engine performance and on emissions were investigated. As a result, with methanol 95% of total energy input, combustion took place without misfiring or knocking. The combustion was smokeless, smoother, with lower NOx, and lower noise than for usual combustion with gas oil. The thermal efficiency was maintained at the same level as in conventional diesel operation. 1981 SA E Transactions 811376. (P-98) Emissions Projections and Their Rele- vance to Power Plant Design. H. C. Watson, Mechanical Engineering Dept., Univ. of Mel- bourne, Australia; J. Mole, Product Engineer- ing, Ford Motor Co., Geelong, Australia; and R. B. Hamilton, Environmental Affairs, Shell Aus- tralia, Melbourne, Australia. The gross emissions for the Australian vehicle fleet are forecast from estimates of population growth, vehicle ownership and vehicle in-service performance. These estimates are coupled with sensitivity analyses, to emis- sions deterioration and on-road performance and the impact of alternative fuels. It is concluded that more data on pre-control and high mileage controlled vehicles is needed to remove uncer- tainties in the projections. The results indicate that existing vehicle emission control standards will continue to give beneficial reductions in hydrocarbon emission levels through to 1995 and present levels will not be exceeded this century. Ambient ozone trends have fallen and are qualita- tively in accord with reducing vehicle emissions. This suggests that power plants should continue to be designed to present U.S. 73 (ADR27A) emissions standards and implementation of catalyst/lead free gasoline technology deferred beyond the proposed 1986 implementation date unless present air quality trends are not maintained. 811377.

The impact of a variety of alternate fuels on candidate engine thermal efficiency is also presented. A family of contin- uously variable transmissions, having different levels of efficiency, are then used to project the overall efficiency of these engine candidates and fuels on the U.S. Metro Route in the 1990+ time frame. The direction of engine design, material and control trends during this time interval are also discussed. 811378. (P-98) The Changing Automotive Industry and the Roles of Its Suppliers. Philip G. Gott and Donald A. Hurter, Automotive Technology Unit, Arthur D. Little, Inc., Cambridge, MA. Factors that are affecting the automotive industry world- wide and the roles of its suppliers are described, and those forces that will dictate change in the basis of competition for both OEMs and suppliers are discussed. Motivating factors of the automotive industry worldwide are dis- cussed, including regulations, fuel economy, life styles, balance of trade, purchasing power, personal mobility, national product loyalty, and Third World growth. U.S. automobile market and technological trends are de- scribed, with major emphasis on fuel economy projections and technological changes. CAFE's for cars and light trucks are projected. A total concept approach to building a "world car" that will achieve sensible levels of safety, cleanliness, and efficiency, while meeting the worldwide demand for a cost-effective, utilitarian, fun-to-drive vehicle is outlined. The implications of technological and market trends to suppliers are described, and the neces- sary insights into product engineering for the automobile OEMs are discussed. 811380. (P-98) The 1980's and the Company Car Fleet. Jack M. Joel, JMJ Fleet Management Pty. Ltd. JMJ Fleet Management in Australia has helped its Corporate clients to maintain contemporary fleet policies throughout the seventies, and explains here how that experience will be applied in the eighties. Professional fleet management has increased in im- portance as companies seek ways to improve their fleet selection techniques, and to control their fleet operations. The Australian fleet operator is faced with unique challenges within the highly protected motor vehicle market, and the vast sparsely populated areas of the country. Correct vehicle selection and tight control of operations are critical in this environment, and the lessons from this Australian experience provide useful informa- tion for fleet operators throughout the Pacific region. 811381. (P-98) Outline of Ultra Light Weight Vehicle and Its Body Design. A. Furukawa and M. Ishikawa, Suzuki Motor Co., Ltd. This paper presents the evolution of the unique Japanese mini-car (K class vehicle), starting from the social needs and early legal requirements, and the features of the vehicle combined with prospective subjects to be an international commodity. This paper also describes the body design process of the Suzuki Alto/Fronte to illustrate the design of a modern K class vehicle. 811382. (P-98) Application Technology of Plastics to Automotive Components. Hiroshi Nohsho, Takashi Seino, Yoshihiro Kajio and Yasuo Sasakura, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd., Yokosuka, Japan. Presently, plastics are widely used for car interior trims; however, with the growing importance of reducing vehicle weight, plastics application to body and chassis parts is ever on the increase. This tendency results from both the development of new plastics which are applicable to structural components, and the new manufacturing processes which have shortened cycle times. We can find many practical uses for plastics in automobile body parts. Plastic bumpers, including RIM fascia, are not only lighter, they are also less susceptible to damage. This is because they soften the car front and rear ends. Glass fiber reinforced RIM has been applied to exterior panels. Experiments with ure thane injections have been con- ducted in an attempt to improve member strength and stiffness. In addition, composite materials reinforced with carbon or glass fiber have been used, on a trial basis, for such chassis parts as leaf springs, wheels, propeller shafts and engine mounting members. This paper deals with the weight reduction, the functional improvements, and the integration and simplification of components which can be realized through the application of plastic technology to automotive components. 811383. (P-98) Performance of a Methanol Fueled Car. Sumio Ito, Akira Sato and Touru Ichimiya, Toyota Motor Co., Ltd., Japan. Fundamental subjects on application of pure methanol to conventional spark ignition engines were investigated. Thermal efficiency increased. The reason is that the combustion pressure does not decrease while the tem- perature of the combustion gas decreases, because the moles of the methanol burned gas increase compared to those of gasoline. Having an anti-knock property, com- pression ratio can be raised, however, preignition easily occurs. Unburned fuel and aldehyde sampling methods were examined. These emissions were exhausted to a greater degree than in the case of gasoline. Low evapo- rative emission was emitted with EFI system. Cold startability is acceptable using a dual fuel system. There was no trouble in driveability in hot weather, and 177</page><page sequence="159">811384-811388 materials used in the tests were shown. Methanol would be an attractive alternative fuel for automotive use, however, problems are still remaining. 811384. (P-98) Combustion Characteristics of Various Alternative Fuels in SI Engine. Kosei Andoh, Kenshin Yonemochi, Hiroki Kawajiri, Kiyotoshi Sakuma, Hideaki Tanabe and G. Takeshi Sato, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, Keio Univ., Japan. This paper presents the effect of properties of fuels, such as gasoline, methanol, ethanol and propane, on the engine performance and on the combustion characteristics in a four-stroke SI engine under the similar operating condi- tions. From analysis of indicator diagram and the ionization probe measurement, the values of combustion characteristics, for instance, the ignition delay rf, the 10% heat release point Thr, the main combustion period Tm and so on were obtained. These values are useful to predict the combustion characteristics of each fuel. This information may be useable to develop the alternative fuel engine. 1981 SA E Transactions 811385. (P-98) Future Engine Designs for Minimum Fuel Consumption and Exhaust Emissions. P. L. Dartnell, The Associated Octel Co. Ltd., Engine Laboratory. Gasoline engines specifically designed to achieve im- proved fuel consumption and lower exhaust emissions are reviewed. The high compression ratio, lean burn approach is considered and contrasted with other solutions such as stratified charge and diesel engines. In the interests of energy conservation, the reasons for excessively stringent exhaust emission control regulations are challenged and compared with the moderate approach apparent in Europe. On the basis that the spark-ignition engine will continue to predominate as the means of powering passenger cars over the next 10-20 years, the relationship of the engine and fuel production for maximum energy utilisation is examined, emphasizing the importance of octane quality in preventing engine dam- age, and its significance in extending the energy in the barrel of crude oil. 811386. (P-98) Keeping the Vehicle Moving - A Practical Study of Identical Vehicles Using Alternative Fuels. M. A. Freshwater and D. Turner, Public Works Dept., Victoria, Australia; and E. E. Milkins, Univ. of Melbourne. A comparison is being undertaken of the performance of five identical vehicles, using alternative fuels, by the Public Works Department of Victoria. The comparison is being made in normal vehicle duty in service, over 60,000 km, and by laboratory testing. Problems encountered in vehicle conversion to alternative fuels, and in installing instrumentation, and in normal operation are described. Laboratory test results of vehicle efficiency and emissions are presented and compared. The fuels considered are petrol, diesel fuel, Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG), and Compressed Natural Gas (CNG). An electric powered vehicle is proposed for this trial and is described. Initial conclusions indicate favour- able cost reduction in using LPG or diesel fuel compared with Petrol and CNG. 811387. (P-98) Future Fuels for Future Engines. T. O. Wagner, Amoco Oil Co., Research and Devel- opment Dept., Naperville, IL. Future U.S. demand for motor fuel used by passenger cars and light trucks will be met with unleaded gasoline and automotive diesel fuel. Long term, new raw materials - shale oils, tar sands and coal liquids, or methanol - may become available but, at least to the year 2000, conven- tional crude oil will predominate. If crude oil supply is not interrupted, the U.S. refining industry will be able to meet expected motor fuel demand with processing technology available now, and largely with facilities already installed. However, proper matching of future vehicles and fuels can significantly increase the efficiency with which crude oil is utilized. The refinery gasoline pool should be proportional among at least two octane grades, but gasoline-powered vehicles should be designed to a single octane target near the economic optimum of about 89 (Research + Mo- tor)/2 octane number to achieve maximum vehicle-miles per barrel of crude oil. Because diesel vehicles attain higher miles per gallon, adding them to the vehicle inventory - within certain limits - further increases overall efficiency of crude oil utilization for transportation. However, availability of kerosene for winterizing auto- motive diesel fuel is limited, and fuel systems of these vehicles should be designed so that they can operate effectively in cold climates on fuels treated with wax- modifier additives for best utilization of light distillate components. 1981 SA E Transactions 811388. (P-98) Crash Repairs - Designing in Cost Sav- ings Over the Next Decade. Lance Taylor and Desmond T. Liddy, N.R.M.A. Insurance Ltd., Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. This paper deals with the directions we can foresee in the next decade for mitigating the cost of repair of passenger vehicles after they suffer crash damage. It examines some characteristics of the damage processes and the nature of the present repair industry. The effects of present trends in vehicle design on crash damage and the repair process are discussed. Prevention by design rather than changes in tools or techniques seems to be the most significant chance of reducing the social cost of physical damage to autos. 178</page><page sequence="160">811389-811395 811389. (P-98) Mechanical Repairability and Servicea- bility of Motor Vehicles - A Repairer's View. Joe Shneider, Fluidrive Automatic Transmissions Pty. Ltd. Rapid technical changes to cars during the next decade pose difficult problems to the vehicle servicing industry. An independent repairer reviews the situation at present and suggests areas where vehicle maintenance and sevicing can be improved in the next decade. Particular emphasis is given to greater co-operation between the repair and manufacturing industries and a greater use of diagnostic electronics is forecast. 811390. (P-98) Analysis in the 1980's: Technical Ad- vances and Management Challenges. Joseph F. Gloudeman, The MacNeal-Schwendler Corp., Los Angeles, CA. This paper addresses the main thrusts anticipated in computer-based analysis, the expected breakthroughs in computer technology and critical challenges facing man- agement in the motor vehicle industry because of these advances. Analysis requirements are both exploiting and causing breakthroughs in computer technology to cope with the increasing role of analysis in the overall design process. Improvements are continuing in such key areas as nonlinear response. This dynamic interaction between analysis and computer science is introducing challenges in such areas as organizational interfaces and the man- agement of large data volumes. A Work Station Concept based on microcomputers has been developed to help meet some of these management challenges at reasonable costs. 811391. (P-98) Approach to Vehicle Body Weight Reduc- tion by Fatigue Strength Analysis. Nobuo Hon- da, Yukio Tanaka and Mikio Sasanabe, Toyota Auto Body Corp., Japan. By utilizing the FEM analysis and the data statistically treated, we developed an analytical method, by which we can estimate accurately the fatigue life of each part of the vehicle body during the design stage. By this method, which we call "S-L(Stress-Life) analysis", a 10% reduction of body weight has been made possible through structural changes, i.e., the reduction of sheet metal thickness and the increase in number of lightening holes. In order to realize the lighter body we have introduced so-called optimum method into the above-stated analytical method and have developed this new analytical method for the research of body weight reduction with design modifi- cations. 1981 SA E Transactions 811392.

(P-98) The Potential Dangers of Applying Pas- senger Car Technology and Methodology to Achieve Similar Goals in Commercial Vehicles. Robert E. Fritts, Purolator Courier Corp. The "Fleet Administrator" or "Director of Maintenance" of the light and medium duty truck fleet in the United States is being subjected to many changes to his historical methods of doing business and to the vehicles he purchases. Federal legislation, which has had such profound effects upon the passenger car industry in the past, is now being directed toward the light and medium truck. The carry over effects of the passenger car regulations are compounded by the direct effects of light truck fuel economy and emissions standards. This paper attempts to address the changes in the Automotive Industries brought on by federal legislation and the effects upon the commercial fleet user. 811394. (P-98) Truck Performance and Fuel Economy. Toshiyuki Matsuzaki, Heavy Duty Truck and Bus Research and Experiment Dept., Isuzu Motors Ltd., Japan; and Yasuhiko Shinagawa, Export Service Dept., Isuzu Motors Ltd., Japan. In Japan, fuel consumption accounts for 30% of truck operating cost, or more. As energy cost is rising, reduction of fuel consumption is of most vital importance. Among many elements which affect fuel economy of truck, there are, characteristics of engine, vehicle operating conditions, vehicle performance, and aerodynamics, and etc. In this paper, from standpoint of "vehicle performance", con- siderations are given to the fuel economy, and to the vehicle operating conditions in typical Asian countries, Japan and Thailand. Some interesting results were obtained, about relations between G.V.W. and vehicle performance. And strong clues were identified for reduc- tion of fuel consumption, and instructions to drivers. 811395. (P-98) The Development of Specifications and Control Conditions for Road Trains in Australia. J. D. A. Widdup and T. A. Pedersen, National Association of Australian State Road Author- ities (NAASRA). Road trains (articulated vehicles hauling one or two trailers, or rigid trucks hauling two or three trailers) provide significant economies in road transport. With over 30 years of experience, road trains are an integral part of road transport in Australia. A recent Study defining the dimensional and mass limitations, mechanical require- ments, operating conditions and other general require- ments that should apply to road trains is discussed. Topics 179</page><page sequence="161">811396-811403 covered include: development and use of road trains; conduct of the Study; concepts used in determining what should and should not be required; pavement damage; and fuel consumption. 811396. (P-98) Australian Road Transport and Energy - A Truck Manufacturer's Viewpoint. J. McD. Paterson, International Harvester Australia Ltd. The future shortages of energy, real energy price rises and inflation are seen as some of the most pressing problems facing the world economy. The recognition of these concerns in Australia will result in pressure to maximise the efficient use of transport fuels. Efforts to optimise the Refinery/Vehicle Engine/Fuel System will lead to changes in petroleum product mix and fuel specification. A principal area for development to improve com- mercial vehicle fuel efficiency is aerodynamic drag reduction. The benefits of medium truck aerodynamics are demonstrated. There is also a case to argue for transport efficiency improvements through increased loadings. 811398. (P-98) Development of the Motor Vehicle Indus- try in Indonesia. H. Sidabutar, IATO, Indonesia. Materials presented in the paper deal with the problem of the automotive industrialization in Indonesia and the factors affecting its process, within the last ten years. The main engineering problem is that of the auto- motive components industry and the standardization of components. The author expects that the engineers of the inter- national manufacturers exporting motor vehicles to Indonesia, will play an important role in contributing to solve the problems which in turn will enhance mutual cooperation. 811399. (P-98) A Study on Drum-Brake Noise of Heavy Duty Vehicle. Yuuji Suzuki and Hideo Ohno, Hino Motors, Ltd., Japan. This paper presents an experimental study on the brake noise having a main frequency of about 500 Hz. From the vibration modes of the brake components during the brake noise occurrence, some resonance systems which might be the cause of the noise were considered. As a result of investigating these resonance systems experimentally, the resonance system which concerns the noise was found out. From the resulting evaluation of the noise by changing the vibration characteristics of the resonance system through modification of the brake components, it was found that the spring constant and the damping coef- ficient of the wheel brake component correlate well to the brake noise level. Using these correlations have made it easier to improve the brake noise. 811400. (P-98) Recent Progress in Research and Devel- opment on Automotive Fuels in Japan. Hiroo Chiba and Hiroshi Minamitani, Maruzen Oil Co., Ltd. Future demand for lighter petroleum products, especially midbarrel, is expected to be higher than for residual fuel oil. Further, since the quality of crude oil imported into Japan will change from light to heavy, it is doubtful whether the supply of lighter products can meet demand. In order to balance supply and demand of lighter products and to secure a stable supply of automotive fuels for the unique Japanese market structure, several measures increasing the yield of lighter products from refineries and the development of alternate fuels are in progress in cooperation with the Japanese government and the private sector. 811401. (P-98) Power Plant - Refinery Optimisation in Australia. R. B. Hamilton, Shell Australia, Melbourne. The cost effectiveness of changes to the power plant are examined. In 1979 diesel fuel represented 12.5% of the fuel consumed by road vehicles and 98% of light vehicles used petrol. The petrol/distillate ratio was 1.33 in 1979/80. A petrol/distillate ratio change is not a cost-effective energy conservation strategy unless crude oil has a real value greater than $35/bbl for commercial vehicles. The value for cars is $100/bbl or the additional capital costs of $1000 must be equivalent to less than 9$/L of the fuel used per year. Some minor changes in fleet composition are indicated. The use of LPG fuel from indigenous sources is more cost effective than conversion to diesel power plants. 811402. (P-98) Transportation Fuels - The U.S. Outlook. R. G. Anderson, R. L. Courtney and H. K. Newhall, Chevron Research Co.; and D. W. Houser, Standard Oil Co. of California. Until the Arab oil embargo in 1973, the use of petroleum in the U.S. for transportation had been fairly predictable. Since that time, forecasts of oil consumption in the U.S. have varied widely. Most have been lowered dramatically during the past few years. This paper presents Chevron's current projections of transportation fuel use for the U.S. and comparisons with several other countries bordering the Pacific Ocean. 1981 SAE Transactions 811403. (P-98) Methanol-to-Gasoline, An Alternative Route to High Quality Gasoline. F. B. Fitch and W. Lee, Mobil Research and Development Corp. Methanol produced from coal or natural gas can be converted over ZSM-5 class zeolite catalyst to high quality gasoline. Process reactions and yields are shown to be viable, thus providing a unique way to manufacture liquid 180</page><page sequence="162">811404-811408 transportation fuels from solid or gaseous energy souces. The hydrocarbon composition and physical properties of the gasoline are very similar to those of conventional petroleum-derived gasolines. No engine or vehicle modi- fication are required to use it. Laboratory and vehicle tests show the performance characteristics of the finished gasoline to compare very favorably in all aspects with commercial premium gasolines. 1981 SAE Transactions 811404. (P-98) Implementation of CNG in New Zealand - August 1981. Garth S. Harris, New Zealand Energy Research and Development Committee, Univ. of Auckland, New Zealand. More than 1 1,000 vehicles have been converted to CNG in the North Island of New Zealand. After setting a target for conversion of 150,000 vehicles by the end of 1985, the Government promulgated a variety of policies including financial incentives to assist the achievement of the target. The paper describes various aspects of the CNG pro- gramme, and the difficulties and successes over a two-year period. 811405. (P-98) California Alcohol Fleet Vehicle Program. R. K. Pefley, Mechanical Engineering Dept., Univ. of Santa Clara, Santa Clara, CA; R. J. Ernst and J. A. Bailey, Alcohol Energy Systems, Sunnyvale, CA. During the past decade, methanol and ethanol have received growing attention as supplements and replace- ments for petroleum based fuels. The alcohols can increase power and thermal efficiency over gasoline while reducing oxides of nitrogen emissions. This evidence has resulted in the State of California initiating fleet exper- iments using pure alcohols. The purposes of these experiments and early evidence from these fleets are incorporated with other engine and vehicle evidence in this paper to indicate a possible evolutionary path for alcohol use as a transportation fuel in the United States. 811406. (P-98) Development of an Aluminium Alloy for Cast Automotive Cylinder Heads. David M. Smith, John A. Eady and Graeme D. Bennett, Comalco Research Centre, Thomastown, Vic- toria, Australia. In-service conditions in aluminium automotive cylinder heads and, particularly the wear mechanisms which pertain during their operation, were studied and an alloy designed to best withstand these conditions. The alloy is basically a hypereutectic A/-Si-Ni-Cu alloy but solidified in such a way as to obtain a fully eutectic microstructure. Other elements are also included in the composition in order to dispersion harden the alpha-aluminium phase. The alloy can be used in the as-cast or heat-treated condition and is shown to have excellent wear and strength properties, at ambient and elevated temperatures. It also has other enhanced properties, including castability, machinability and corrosion resistance, which make the alloy potentially suitable for a number of automotive applications. 1981 SAE Transactions 811407. (P-98) Australian Steel Development Programme for the Automotive Industry. B. J. Clarsen, Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd., Australia; A. Blatherwick, John Lysaght (Aust.) Ltd., Aus- tralia; and J. G. Williams, Australian Iron &amp; Steel Pty. Ltd., Australia. An intensive steel development programme for the Australian automotive industry has been in progress since 1976. To co-ordinate the developments and to gain greater understanding of the utilisation of the new steels, inter-company task groups were established. Steels devel- oped included hot and cold rolled high strength low alloy grades, recovery annealed grades, as well as a rephos- phorised steel for panel applications. Additionally, highly formable non ageing hot rolled and cold rolled low strength steels were also developed. The role of vacuum degassing, slab casting and low sulphur steel technology in achieving the required properties is emphasised. Current and future developments are outlined. Of particular interest are the sound deadening and coated steels. 811408. (P-98) Trends of Auto Materials in Japan. Makoto Ohsawa and Mitsuru Noguchi, Honda R&amp;D, Saitama, Japan. Considerable progress has been made for the past ten years on various kinds of the materials used for auto- manufacturing particularly in Japan in order to comply with the so-called "social needs". For instance, there have been countermeasures for emission, safety regulations, safeguards, savings for energy, upgrading, etc. Above all, in order to meet recent requirements towards weight saving, energetic efforts have been made by not only car-manufacturers but also other materials producers for the development of new substitute materials such as high strength steel sheets, aluminum alloys, plastic products and so forth. Today, these newly developed materials are widely applied to every model of new automobiles. However, the price increases of crude petroleum since the second petroleum crisis, have become a serious problem which affects the cost-increase for aluminum alloys and petroleum chemical products. Accordingly, for the automobile industry facing such severe cost price problems, it will take a while to reconsider these materials. We, the writers, will explain our technical and engineering comments on the recent tendency of iron and steel, light metals, sintered metals and plastics prevailing for Japanese cars. 181</page><page sequence="163">811409-811415 811409.

The steel makers in Japan are improving the steel making technology in order to control the chemical composition of steel finely in narrow range. Advancements in out-of-furnace refining technologies such as ladle refining and R-H vacuum degassing process, composition control by computers, and hardenability controlling technique have greatly contributed to the improvement of material characteristics of steels. New materials have been developed by these tech- niques, and these materials are greatly helping save cost in manufacturing process of automotive parts. Improvements in manufacturing technologies by the steel makers have brought about enormous merits to the automobile manufacturers. 811410. (P-98) The 1980's- A Decade of Challenge for Engine Oils. C. C. Colyer and K. J. Harding, Amoco Chemicals Corp. The 1980's will be a decade of challenge toward further development of both engine oils and evaluation tech- niques to measure their performance properties. Passenger car engine oils will be developed to provide (1) less engine friction, (2) exhaust emission catalyst protection, (3) better engine cold starting, (4) extended oil drain intervals, (5) light-duty diesel performance, (6) more realistic high- temperature viscometrics, (7) compatibility with alternate base oils, fuels and new seal materials and (8) minimum toxic substances. Heavy duty diesel engine oil devel- opment will include most of these same performance properties with specific emphasis on the minimization of (1) top land/piston groove deposits, (2) cylinder bore polishing, (3) engine wear, (4) oil consumption, (5) oil thickening, and (6) oil shear loss. New, more precise engine test techniques will be developed to measure the required engine oil performance parameters through worldwide cooperation leading to- ward an international engine oil classification system. 811411. (P-98) Trends in Automotive Lubrication in Australasia. W. G. Dyer, Amoco Chemicals Pty. Ltd., Australia. The need for special lubricants to meet the particular requirements of the Australasian vehicle population, has already been raised within the SAE. This paper discusses possible future automotive engine oil requirements which could be required to meet the anticipated trends in vehicle registration patterns in Australia and New Zealand. In projecting future needs, the effects of fuel quality and availability, possible alternative fuels, and changes in environmental legislation are also considered. Although the requirements of 'off highway' mining and earthmoving equipment need to be taken into account in setting targets for lubricating oil performance, no attempt has been made in this paper to analyse the sales of this type of equipment. 811412.

This paper summarizes the study of the effects of oil formulation on fuel consumption using Japanese diesel engines and vehicles. Several test techniques are described for screening fuel-efficient diesel engine oils. A diesel engine oil formulated with the optimized combination of detergent-inhibitor package and friction modifier (borate), and multigraded to 10W-30, proved to exhibit the maximum fuel economy and to pass requirements for CD quality. The improvements demonstrated in dynamometer engine tests have been confirmed in extensive field testing. 1981 SAE Transactions 811413. (P-98) Advantages of Synthetic Automotive Engine Lubricants. D.

(P-98) Recent Die Casting Technology and Product Quality in Japan. Muneo Suzuki, Re- search Laboratory, Fuso Light Alloys Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan. The mechanical strength of aluminum alloy die castings produced by the ordinary die casting process can be increased by fining the casting structure. However, 182</page><page sequence="164">811416-811420 strength which is still higher than obtained by this method, as well as higher reliability, are often demanded for automobile components. To satisfy these require- ments, new processes in which molten metal does not entrap the air when injected under pressure have been developed and are used in Japan. Representative pro- cesses are Oxygen Atmosphere Die Casting, Low Speed Filling Die Casting and High Pressure Die Casting. Any of these processes reduces the gas in the castings to only about 5 cc/100gAl, making solution heat treatment possible to obtain higher strength. 811416. (P-98) Recent Technology of Sintered Metals for Automotive Use. Nobuhito Kuroishi, Sumitomo Electric Industries Ltd. Some recent P/M technologies for automotive use in Japan were discussed. Several years ago, P/M replaced cast materials for exhaust valve seat in gasoline engine when unleaded gasoline was introduced, and today new P/M materials which can be used for diesel engine have been developed. P/M forging is not so grown-up in Japan because of its economical problems. Instead of such a conventional P/M forging, low cost new powder forging process using swarf powder from cast turnings has been developed. On the other hand, new type of high strength and high ductility sintered steels based on newly devel- oped sintering and alloying techniques have come into practical use as heavy duty structural components. 811417.

Performance capabilities of an electronic digital speed- ometer are studied. Various investigations are made for setting specifications on visual recognition time, response time, character size, visual angle, luminance, color, property of optical filter transmission, control method, stability, and the number of pulses of a speed sensor, using both experimental apparatuses and test vehicles. As a result, followings are clarified. There is an optimum range of character sizes for a digital speedometer. Response time and stability play the most important parts in the readability. However, it is very difficult for a digital speedometer to satisfy both the stability under a constant vehicle speed and the rapid response during acceleration or deceleration, so far as a conventional control method is employed. With the introduction of a new control method which varies the refresh cycle of display, the performances of both the stability and the rapid response are improved. 1981 SA E Transactions 811420.

The quality level of automotive electronic products produced in NIPPONDENSO CO., LTD. is such a good level as we evaluate warranty claims by p.p.m level and not by percent level. We have carried out exhaustive failure analysis on warranty returns, qualification tests on newly purchased parts, and precise data analysis on warranty claims for many years so that we attain such a good quality level. We offered those data obtained from above results to the sections concerned. It was remarkably successful that we put improvements for failure causes of semiconductor devices in co-operation with manufacturers of semicon- ductor devices. In this report, I would like to present the improving processes of semiconductor devices' failures which are majority of failures of automotive electronic products by indicating some of the failure modes and analized results obtained by using Weibull probability papers. 1981 SA E Transactions 183</page><page sequence="165">811421-811427 811421.

The status of automotive electronic applications world- wide is briefly reviewed, and the common motivating factors as well as future trends are discussed. In order to realize the full potential of electronics on the automobile, a number of issues must be successfully addressed in the 1980's. Eight issues are identified and discussed in this paper: The cost of electronic systems; the reliability of systems, semi-conductors and other parts; service of complex electronic systems; the proliferation of electronic hardware and software; electro-magnetic interference; centralized versus discrete modules; the fine line between an appropriate level of design evolution and pushing the state of the art too far; the need for a systems engineering approach although considerable work remains to be done on each of these eight issues, none of them appears to be insurmountable; and in fact, the eighth challenge, appli- cation of systems engineering concepts promises to be significantly beneficial in resolving the other seven problem areas. 811423.

The newly mass-produced EQ 140 truck is designed for difficult service conditions existing in China. The policy of material selection is to ensure good quality of the truck and to make full use of resources rich in the country. In order to beneficially exploit the full value of cast iron, RE-Mg treated irons are employed. Wide application of high strength steels makes the truck more durable and lighter. For good hardenability, a series of boron steels is developed to save large amount of precious alloys. The success of the truck proves that the policy of selection and development of materials is well-based both technically and economically. 811425. (P-98) Aerodynamic Effects to a Bicycle Caused by a Passing Vehicle. Yoshikazu Kato, Tetsuo Iwasa, Mitsuo Matsudo and Yoshihiro Miyai, Dept. of Transportation Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Osaka Industrial Univ. (Japan). There are many reasons why a bicycle is caused to wobble by a passing vehicle, for example, human engineering factors, riding techniques, the conditions of the road, aerodynamic effects, etc. In this report, aerodynamic effects to a bicycle by a passing vehicle have been investigated experimentally and theoretically. Experiments were made by driving the 1/6-scale vehicle model with a catapult arrangement near the 1/6-scale bicycle model which was at rest. Aerodynamic forces acting on the bicycle model were measured with the aerodynamic balance mounted under the bicycle and the flow patterns around the bicycle caused by the vehicle were examined using visualization techniques. To compare with the experimental results, numerical calculations were carried out on the passing motion of two bodies in an ideal fluid. 811426. (P-98) Accident Prevention of Mixed Automo- bile-Bicycle Traffic on Narrow Roads. Yuzuru Matsuura, Hiroshi Hattori, Kazuo Araki, Hidefumi Ohnaka and Kikuo Narumiya, Osaka Industrial Univ. (Japan). In districts of Japan and other Asian countries where roads are not well developed, densely mixed automobile- bicycle traffic on old narrow roads is usual. According to Japanese statistics 1980, the number of fatalities in traffic accidents between bicycles and automobiles surpasses 10 percent of the total and certain measures to decrease this count are requested. In the present report, the authors paid attention to automobiles approaching bicycles from behind and passing by. At first, actual traffic states on narrow roads were recorded by VTR and many dangerous scenes were observed. Then simulative experiments were performed as follows; A narrow road was set with various obstacles e.g. power pole on one side. Several types of bicycles were operated there by subjects under various conditions e.g. passing automobile on the other side. It was found that the bicycle rider was subject to physiological and psychological pressures by the restric- tions from both sides and was forced to run wobbly. Therefore automobile drivers should recognize these dangerous facts and operate automobiles carefully and it is needless to say that it is necessary to improve the road conditions. 1981 SA E Transactions 811427.

Short of capital and production volume, but with skilled handicraftmen abounding, most body builders in Indonesia find their positions to be between machine intensive and labor intensive ones. Low buying power versus fanciful demands on means of transportation appearance often force body builders to compromise on some safety matters. Finding compromises leads one to believe that standardization may well be a forgotten thing, but IATO (the Indonesian Society of Automotive Engineers) to- gether with the Government, is aiming at guiding the automotive industry to a more rationalized activity by adopting standards that are suited to Indonesia's condi- tions. 811428.

The current status of automotive electronics in Japan and the prospects for the '80s are described in this paper. Semiconductor technologies are focused on first. Such technologies have been the greatest driving force for progress in automotive electronics, and will undoubtedly continue to be so in the future. The cost-performance ratio of semiconductor systems will increase several this decade. Highly integrated CMOS LSIs will replace other LSIs in automobiles, because they are better suited to the severe conditions found in automotive systems. New solid-state sensors and actuators using new materials and technol- ogies will be developed in this decade. Microprocessor control systems will spread to most makes and models of cars in this decade. Control technology will become more sophisticated.

In the field of automotive industry the initiative was undertaken by the A.A.F. (Asean Automotive Federa- tion). Several obstacles were met, for some difficulties certain solutions were to be formulated. Joint proposals from the private sector were discussed and endorsed by government agencies concerned. At present the waiting is for the first and second "package for complementation", how to facilitate and how to put into effect, how to implement in detail. 811433. (P-98) Prospect on Near Future Development of China's Motor Industry. Chang Xian Zeng, The First Motor Works, Changchun, PRC; and Sun Kai Nan, General Bureau of Public Transport, 185</page><page sequence="167">811434-811437 Beijing, PRC. China had developed her motor industry, relying on own effort primarily. We have several models of trucks, passenger cars, dumpers and buses, and new models are under consideration. Geographical, ambient, road and traffic conditions are briefly described. The marketing perspectives, status of energy resources, and policies for further progress are mentioned. Since the motor industry is a world wide industry, China will welcome all corporations of good will. 811434. (P-98) Development of the Automotive Parts, Components, and Supplier Industry in Indonesia. Ir. Sabransjah, Ir. Yan Pieter Simorangkir and Ir. Soejoso Soekandar, BPP-Teknologi (Agency for the Development and Application of Tech- nology) Jakarta, Indonesia. It is hoped that the growth of the automotive industry in Indonesia will in turn stimulate the growth of producers of intermediate products for that industry. Therefore, a topdown development is envisioned in which foreign technology is transferred or imported to few large-scale local manufacturing firms, mostly susidiaries of foreign companies or their joint ventures with local firms. Technology is then diffused to a growing number of small-scale local plants and workshops which act as subcontractors. Eventually, many of these small-scale firms hopefully grow into modern and independent companies, specialized in the manufacture of specific parts and components. This report examines the growth, status and outlook for the automotive industry in Indonesia. Specific examples and data are provided, and technological needs and resources for the 1980's iden- tified. 811437. (P-98) Export Facilitation and the Australian Automotive Industry. Graeme J. Longbottom, Christopher G. M. Coxon and Andrew J. Storer, Mitsubishi Motors Australia Ltd. Australian automobile manufacture has been linked to Government policy directives for over 50 years. This has encouraged the growth and development of secondary manufacturing industry within Australia. The most recent changes to the protection of the local manufacturers is the Complementation or Export Facilitiation scheme that allows credits for manufacturers who export components. These export credits are used by manufacturers to import parts without tariff penalties. Aims of the Export Facil- itation scheme are to improve the productivity and cost structure of the Australian automobile industry by allowing world volume manufacture of parts that can be produced economically in Australia. Automotive engi- neers must now review their role within a new inter- national manufacturing arena and ensure that component design and production technology meet these challenges. 186</page></plain_text>
