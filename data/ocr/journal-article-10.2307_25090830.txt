<plain_text><page sequence="1">Ekwueme Michael Thelwell "He Coulda Bin A Contendah": The Curious, Unprecedented, Enigmatic Political Career of General Colin L. Powell, U.S.A. Ret. "He tested the waters. The waters rose up and kissed him . . . and . . . and . . . he just walked away?" Former Sen. Paul Tsongas Nov. 8, 1995 IT TAKES NO IMAGINATION AT ALL TO HEAR the implied "God damn" at the end of that sentence. Or the eyes glazed with shock, exasperation and disbelief. "He walked away?" That was the public response of Paul Tsongas, former Democrat, former U.S. Senator, unsuccessful candidate in 1992 for his party's nom ination and an early and vigorous advocate of a Colin Powell presidential candidacy, on learning of General Powell's declin ing to run. Paul Tsongas, as serious, decent and thoughtful as recent American politicians go; one demonstrably with the requisite "fire in the belly," sounded both forlorn and ineffably baffled. And why not, no prospective candidate in living memory had ever begun with preliminary indications of popular support and respect of the volume and intensity that Powell had been showing. "General Powell is so popular," opined the New York Times somewhat wishfully on November 5, "that opponents may be hard pressed to attack him. That could bring about a new political civility." So there was more hidden in Paul Tsongas's words than rue ful amazement and sorrow. There was also a clear, cold under current of anger. The outrage from a rejection at once personal and professional. "He walked away." How could he? How dare he? It had all been there, hadn't it? Clearly within his reach, 581</page><page sequence="2">The Massachusetts Review and he walks away? From a better than even shot at The Ameri can Presidency? To any American of the political class this was beyond unthinkable, it was downright unnatural. In a direct way, it was an insult, a betrayal of their profession, and a rejec tion of its most automatic and unexamined assumption?the impulse to power. Because Tsongas had obviously come to believe, even as I had, although slowly and with considerable resistance, that the po litically impossible, the heretofore unimaginable in race-biased America, was indeed upon us: that this visibly and undeniably black soldier had indeed been presented with (and turned his back on) a better than even chance at the American presidency. It was difficult to say which was the more improbable?that pos sibility or its rejection. For was this not the ultimate American prize? That, for which countless white men spend much of their lives scheming and plotting; lusting after, working for, build ing towards, dreaming about and salivating over, that prize had seemed to have been offered to a black man, and one who claimed not even to have been seeking it? To what extent had any of it been real? To what extent merely media generated illusion; or the masterly orchestration of a can ny, ambitious, media-sawy old political general, Washington insider and bureaucratic politician par excellence, his publish ers and political advisors? Clearly a little of both had been present. But what seems a genuine groundswell of spontaneous popular support had al so undeniably been present. Certainly the 3500 Texans or 2500 Californians patiently standing in line for hours for the privi lege of handing over 25 bucks for a book, a signature and a hand shake were more than illusion. Nor were the nine out of ten Floridians lighting up the switchboard of a Ft. Lauderdale radio station to demand the continuation of marathon, three hour nightly readings from the Powell memoir (hardly riveting reading, by the way), what we have come to expect from the talk show audiences we know and love. More substantial were the up-surge of independent committees volunteering to work gratis for the drafting of the general, apparently without the slightest gesture of encouragement from their principal. Free help, and in this age of highly paid campaign "professionals!" What weight to give to opinion polls? Do they really mean anything except in the fevered imagination of politicians and 582</page><page sequence="3">"He Coulda Bin A Contendah their hired experts? Whatever their importance, during Sep tember and October the polls, whether commissioned by the incumbent President, his aspiring Republican replacements or by independents, all agreed. They showed an undeclared Powell defeating both Dole and Clinton head to head, or all three together. Then there was of course the good ol' omnipresent race card. But even that reflected the odd inversion of reality that marked this curious affair. Ever since Nixon's highly successful and cyn ical "Southern strategy" in 1968, the old confederacy has been the graveyard of Democratic presidential hopes. So much so that during this period the only Democrats to carry the white South ern vote?or gain the White House?have been two Southern white men, Carter and Clinton. This is correctly understood to be the classic expression of American racial politics?the greatly to be appeased power of the "bubba" vote. Which is why?at first glance?it was alto gether astonishing to have pollsters report that although the General's support cut across all demographic (read racial) groupings, the group reporting the highest level of approval and support was Southern white men. Much more could be said of the varied manifestations of this "popular" support. It was swift, sudden, seemed truly spontane ous and completely eclipsed that of all the declared candidates and the incumbent president. Also, it crossed party lines as easily as ethnic ones. Supporters were identified among Reagan Dem ocrats, Perot Independents, and allegedly extinct species such as moderate Republicans and, though less so, liberal Democrats. All of which, though defying conventional political logic, might perhaps be explained by examining the perceived quality or lack thereof in the opposition. But who could have anticipated, much less explain, the rank breaking effect among numbers of Republican insiders: office holders (Guiliani of New York, for instance) or some highly visi ble ideologues within the hard-core conservative monolith held to anchor the center of the "new" Republican Party? Nonethe less, Mr. Guiliani and other elected Republicans emerged, along with hardline conservative activists like Jack Kemp, William Bennett and Bill Kristol, all either urging his candidacy, or more likely, assuming it and imploring the General to kindly please do so as a Republican. Which is all the more puzzling because 583</page><page sequence="4">The Massachusetts Review these conservative overtures became public and continued even after Powell had openly rejected the web of ideological litmus test issues considered essential for nomination in a Republican Party widely seen to be totally captive to the religious right. After Powell had declared his support in principle for a woman's right to choose, domestic arms control and affirmative action. More predictably, not all conservative hardliners were so wel coming nor so sanguine. Some saw nothing but potential disas ter in these invitations to Powell. "It is," they fumed in horror, "as though Ronald Reagan never lived and Nelson Rockefeller never died." Their hastily organized opposition and dire warn ings of the destruction of the Party were Powell to secure the nomination ["You will see a mass exodus of people"], exposed their own sense of the tenuousness and insecurity of right wing pretensions to dominance of the party and the loyalty of its rank and file. It also demonstrated just how serious a challenge to conservative hegemony they took this black man to be. Among black folk, and particularly those of the Civil Rights generation, all this carried, inevitably, an aura of pervasive un reality. It seemed more than illusory. How and why could one figure so transcend that many time-honored boundaries? It ran counter not simply to expectation, but to the hard conditioning of our political experience. To most of us it reeked suspiciously of media gamesmanship and white folks' fantasy, contradicting everything we know?or thought we did?of the intractable, ob durate, corrupting presence of race and racism in the political culture and collective psyche of white Americans. Shit, remem ber Willie Horton. But what exactly was the game being run? By whom, on whom and to what end? And yet (keep hope alive?) something persisted. Half seen and dimly perceived, that something was tantalizing and seductive in its suggestion of real change. Could some mysterious pro cesses be unfolding within the racial-psychic synapses of so many of our fellow white citizens, powerful enough to create this inversion of reality? So utter a reversal of form must bespeak deep crisis? "When you see a toad hopping in broad daylight you can be sure something is after its life," says the Igbo proverb. Or was it simply a long overdue racial maturity? What was even more counter-intuitive was that back-to-back racially "divi sive" media events during October, such as the O.J. verdict and 584</page><page sequence="5">"He Coulda Bin A Contendah" Farrakhan's march, did not appear to diminish Powell's white support. They seemed, instead, to energize and intensify it: the greater the evidence of America's intractable racial division the greater the need for the vague "healing promise" symbolized by a Powell Presidency. Derrick Jackson, a black journalist for the Boston Globe, had an unsentimental and unforgiving take on the response to the Powell decision. "White America," he announced, "has to find itself another Great Black Hope." Writing earlier in the Times, Richard Berke, in capturing fairly the mood and magnitude of the media speculation had illustrated, however unwittingly, Jackson's "Great Black Hope" insight. "With such extravagant attention comes extravagant expec tations of a man unlike anyone else on the modern political scene. He served three Presidents but is a non-politician whose ideas, so far as they are known, defy ideological categorization. He is a black man whose appeal cuts across demographic groups. He is a true believer in Ronald Reagan who refuses to stoke the culture wars. And, as faith in government seems to have all but vanished, he is the product of an American insti tution that is still trusted: the military. And so the talk about General Powell's potential impact pushes at the edges of hype?no mere candidate is he, but a transformative historical figure. His candidacy could alter the composition?and even threat en the very existence?of the Republican and Democratic par ties as we know them (emphasis added). In this era of political disaffection, General Powell could restore faith in the system and usher in more high-toned political discourse. But a Powell candidacy could also be one colossal flop, not only for the General but for the nation. The greater the expec tations, the greater the risk that it could devastate an already fragile political system." So what have we here? A "transformative historical figure" in a "fragile political system" disintegrating at its center and who "threatens the existence of the Democratic and Republican Parties," the two pillars (they are something less than poles), of electoral politics in this country? Powerful stuff this. In any context this language would appear to lend new levels of mean ing to the word hyperbole. The next sound you hear, folks, will 585</page><page sequence="6">The Massachusetts Review be the clang and clatter of the wheels falling off the two party bandwagon and the political system grinding to a halt. But and still, you know ... "when you see a toad hopping in broad day light . . ." This aura of utter unreality is only compounded if we step back to remind ourselves of the real credentials?political and biographical?of this "transformative" figure, the putative cat alyst and vehicle for such cataclysmic change. Bro General Powell remains a black, second generation Ja maican immigrant of classically working class antecedents. His was a family of strivers, working people and union members, the down payment of whose first home (the initial way station of the American dream) came not out of family trust funds or frugally saved "disposable" income, but from the lucky chance of a numbers "hit." His route into the officer class came not by way of an elite service academy but by the low road: the more plebeian ROTC at the proletarian and polyglot City College of New York. Had his family migrated to the very same community just fifty years later, during let us say, the first Republican administration in which their son rose to prominence, what would they have found? Their entry jobs will have long since migrated, their unions weakened, the schools decayed, the community despair ing and demoralized and opportunity for youth criminally di minished. Today young Colin's chances of ending up a gang banger would be infinitely greater than ending up Chairman of the Joint Chiefs. It would be instructive to learn whether Sickser's Toy and Baby furnishings where young Colin loaded merchandise and picked up a smattering of Yiddish; the Harlem furniture plant where as a member of Teamster Local 812, he screwed on hinges; or the Pepsi-Cola bottling plant where?like Booker T. Wash ington before him?he brought excellence to the mopping of floors, all still exist. And if not, what replaces them as points of early economic access for this generation of youthful immi grants? The venture capitalism of the crack industry? Because in most real terms except age?race, gender, class? this transcendent American hero is representative of the only group in the American census whose life expectancy is today declining. The only category, one third of which finds itself, on any given day, in the clutches of one aspect or another?jail, 586</page><page sequence="7">He Coulda Bin A Contendah probation, parole, juvenile detention?of what is called, with out irony, the Criminal Justice (sic) System. The only group of U.S. citizens represented in greater numbers in institutions of correction rather than those of higher learning. A group rou tinely and blithely proclaimed by the media to be "in crisis" or like some anthropomorphic spotted owl, "endangered." The proof of the distressing truth-beneath-hyperbole being the alienation and sheer desperation that could drive nearly a million of them to the nation's capitol in answer to a call of truly amazing political incoherence, issued by a "leader" who is given to going up in space ships to receive divine revelation, then returning to earth to call press conferences announcing these travels to white folk. Minister Farrakhan's Man March: religious revival, political protest, male bonding ritual, what? "When you see a toad hopping . . " For a perceived agent of sweeping change, the political biog raphy (or professional life) appears even more improbable. Until one remembers that the kind of change supporters pro jected into a Powell candidacy was never social change. It was always and only a change in the processes and configuration of American electoral politics. This is an important distinction. In fact, to his supporters he never represented the possibility of radical social change but its opposite. They tended to see him as an anchor of stability, good sense and old fashioned values, "integrity" and "leadership" being prominent among these. The professional Colin Powell, as opposed to the hero of pop ular imagination, is almost totally the creature of bureaucracy. He is the issue of not one but two of the modern world's most artificial, arbitrary, serpentine and conformist bureaucratic cultures west of the old Soviet-era Kremlin. (Though the French and the Germans are said to have uncommon talent for nation al bureaucracies also.) Powell's nursery school was the rigid, authoritarian, proto col-ridden culture of the U.S. military which formed him, and with which to this day, he fully identifies. His finishing school was the Byzantine world of Pentagon and White House politics of official Washington, "inside the beltway." His extraordinary fast-track-for-promotion career?youngest ever, only black or ROTC-produced Chairman of the Joint Chiefs?has to be seen as a truly triumphant political accom plishment. But does an obvious mastery of the skills, values and 587</page><page sequence="8">The Massachusetts Review career-manship necessary to advancement within these peculiar cultures really translate to "leadership" in the sense of that word for which the public was clamoring? Advancement in these cultures requires talent, of course. Intelligence and competence, certainly. Assume that one is extremely smart, very competent, dedicated and like Caesar of old, ambitious. That's not quite enough, friends. To survive much less advance in the essentially totalitarian culture of the military requires the qualities one needs under fire. Caution above all, playing it safe, by the book, keeping one's head down, one's ass covered, one's powder dry. It requires unquestioning obedience. Never obviously challenging author ity, "the Brass," whose power over careers is total and arbitrary; playing by the rules, ever the good soldier; strategically balanc ing and padding the r?sum? while being ultra-sensitive but not conspicuously so, to the smallest nuances in the shifting tides of influence and preferment; watching for the main chance to be "noticed," but never in the wrong way or for the wrong rea sons. It requires a disciplined self-control and an almost second nature diplomatic instinct bordering on sycophancy. Make few enemies, but when you must, make the right ones. It all requires great concentration, careful calculation and a near total accep tance?or the appearance of acceptance?of the spit and polish values and assumptions of this extraordinary world. It is a world in which the brother thrived. And the insider culture of Washington bureaucratic politics lies not far from that first world. In fact, they are adjoining neighborhoods, the second being only a little more upscale, tonier?larger salaries, more imposing mansions?than the first. But they are congruent. So it is ironic, but in no way surprising, to discover that Bro Powell, our newest Republican's meteoric ascent in one bu reaucracy was not untouched by the "crude" racial calculus of Democratic Party insider politics in the other. In 1976, when James Earl Carter was elected president, his cabinet had to be "balanced" to reflect the party constituencies which had elected him. Thus Clifford Alexander, a bluff, blunt talking black Democratic Party insider became Secretary of the Army. Alexander understood bureaucratic power, saw his duty clear and did it. By the end of his term he had tripled the number of the Army's black generals. 588</page><page sequence="9">He Coulda Bin A Contendah "My method was simplicity itself," Alexander remembers. "I just told everyone that I wouldn't sign the [Army's] goddamn promotion lists unless they were fair." Which meant that the Brass had in turn to balance their tick ets. So the search was on for deserving?or at least acceptable? black candidates. Bro Powell, then a colonel, was serving his first term?a mili tary aide to a deputy assistant?somewhere in the bowels of the Pentagon. He was well-placed therefore to become one of the early beneficiaries of Secretary Alexander's conscientious, no nonsense exercise of black power and who became, at age 42, the Army's youngest brigadier general. "What you need in this town is a Godfather," Courtland Cox, an old movement friend turned Beltway insider, once told me wistfully. "More than anything else in this town, you gotta have a Godfather." Seven years earlier, during the ill-fated Nixon administration, Bro Powell, even then a fast-tracking 35-year-old lieutenant col onel, had been selected a White House fellow. With fine instinct ("I knew," he explained, "It had its hands on every department's jugular") he opted for the Office of Management and Budget ("Follow the monay," as Deep Throat would croak just a few years later). At OMB he had found not one, but a formidable pair of godfathers, in the persons of "rising star" Frank Carlucci and the already orbiting planet, Caspar Weinberger. The Godfather Syndrome in Beltway insider politics contains much of the ethos of military organizational culture, but there are subtle and important differences. One must learn to recog nize where the "real" power resides in a meeting and an unerring judgement for whose career is on the rise. The Godfather must be either already established?nice work if you can get it?or more usually, a figure only slightly more senior. But one whose star being ascendant, exerts a gravitational pull within whose wake your own might be lifted into orbit. Here, as in the military, competence is a given: one must exe cute assignments intelligently, carefully, uncritically and well. Beyond that, the preferred qualities are near total loyalty, discre tion, caution and humility, in Powell's phrase, the "subordi nation of self." This means, never embarrass or upstage the God father, he who at all costs is to be protected. You anticipate and defuse possible criticism; if it occurs, note the source. The taint 589</page><page sequence="10">The Massachusetts Review of failure is fatal. That, you learn to anticipate and deflect away if possible to a rival. But if it cannot be avoided, your chest takes the spear. Be prudent and reasoned with advice, and only when asked. Never volunteer unsolicited opinions unless absolutely certain of its importance and that you are right. In the event of success, avoid even the appearance of seeking credit?that goes, at least publicly?to the Godfather. Two things, above all, absolute discretion and trustworthi ness. Guard whatever dirty little secrets come your way. Never, never run to the media except to protect, stroke or polish the Godfather's all important "image." And trust: a world governed largely by ego and ambition, in which the expansion of turf, clout and image is a constant preoccupation is a culture in which jealousy and mistrust breeds. ("Nixon never trusted Kis singer and Kissinger never trusted anyone.") Trust, therefore, and the ability to inspire it, are the subaltern's most valuable asset. They are precious political capital, hard to earn, never to be squandered. The brother seems to have been trusted. Only do these things, my son, and the Godfather will instruct you in the arcane ways of power, then he will see to your ad vancement. Be patient, your turn will come. "Well done, you good and faithful servant. Because you have been faithful in small things, I shall give you dominion over greater." It was ever thus. So, when the Republican revolution of Ronald Reagan swept into office in 1980, the newly minted Brigadier General Powell was already in the Pentagon. Who should come riding back in on the waves of the Reagan "Revolution" but his former Office of Management and Budget messmates, Mssrs. Weinberger and Carlucci as Secretary and Under-Secretary of Defense, respec tively. Serendipity. The rest is history. Secretary Alexander, then being swept out of office with the other Democratic appointments, is reported musing contempla tively in the New Yorker Magazine as follows: Surprisingly, Clifford Alexander, whose term as Secretary of the Army makes him as responsible as anyone for Powell's career trajectory, seems less than pleased with the result: "Was Colin Powell exceptional? No. There were a number of black generals who were equally as good as Colin Powell. But the 590</page><page sequence="11">He Coulda Bin A Contendah breaks were with Powell. By working in the Pentagon, he was visible to the Republican leadership. And Colin, who is smart and competent, did quite well in part because of the proximity. Well, yeah . . . but with due respect to Bro Alexander, "visi bility," "proximity," the "breaks," a Godfather or two, and even the desperate need for a few dependably presentable black faces to showcase prominently in an embarrassingly pale-skinned Republican administration hardly does justice to this career. While those may very well explain Clarence Thomas (and, Bro Chairman Powell, whatever else he might turn out to be, is no Clarence Thomas), they come nowhere close to explaining Powell's remarkable trajectory. No more than does the "aw shucks," regular guy earnestness, patriotic devotion, and sterling character so heavily foreground ed in the autobiography. To give the general his due, you know there had to be much more: qualities, which while perhaps not discussable in polite society, are essential to the game of real politic as it is played inside the Beltway. There had to be driving ambition attended by the cold, delib erate, careful calculation necessary to promote it. Sharp elbows and the cunning to disguise them; that ego-effacing charm that disguises self-promotion even as it advances it; a long memory and an instinct for payback. Also discipline, patience and the deft, unerring sure-footedness necessary to traverse the mine fields and pitfalls along the corridors of power without appar ently even a serious misstep, much less a fatal one. These are uncommon talents in a game that very few play successfully and infinitely fewer with anything like the mastery which the General thus far has shown. In these terms, our gen eral is obviously a very formidable player indeed. How formidable a player? Well, once raised from the ranks of supporting actor he was to demonstrate repeatedly just how thoroughly he had mastered the complex rules governing the acquisition and effective use of power in bureaucratic Washing ton. However vague and imprecise the Powell image may be in the general public's perception, to insider Washington it is sharp and very clear. As Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, he is regarded as simply the most independent, powerful and influential of recent military chieftains. Nobody's patsy, when necessary a hard-ball politi 591</page><page sequence="12">The Massachusetts Review cian but skillfully so. Adept at mobilizing support, picking his spots, covering his tracks, he was uncommonly successful in having his way in matters of policy during two administrations beginning with that of the "elder brother" who had initially appointed him. And something else quite rare, an old-fashioned core of in tegrity, a consistency which however arguable the political re sult, looked suspiciously like honor. For beneath that patina of subaltern pragmatism where "the king must have his shilling," which had served the career so well, there apparently lurked a bedrock of abiding commitments and values which were not to be compromised. There was above all others, one constituency whose trust he cherished, whose interests he saw himself repre senting, and in the advancement of which?as he saw them? he was prepared to go head to head with two presidents. That constituency was, of course, the American military, the brother hood of the ranks. What first emerged as a personal conviction forged in the bit ter experience of Vietnam, he would now elevate to the level of unofficial "doctrine." Never again, if he could help it, would the American soldier be deployed in the absence of a vital na tional interest, clearly understood and popularly supported. And then only when armed with a well-defined, achievable mil itary objective and the commitment of forces overwhelmingly sufficient to the mission. After which, hoohaw, politicians get the hell out of the way! So that when Bro' President Bush reportedly captivated by the notion that the only foolproof, time-tested route to presiden tial greatness was through war-time leadership and America's erstwhile surrogate Saddam presented an irresistible oppor tunity, the Chairman demurred. He counseled restraint and strongly urged punitive sanctions and an embargo instead of war and, quite significantly and uncharacteristically, allowed himself to be publicly associated with that advice, thus not only affecting the public debate, but being seen to do so. Perhaps like that other great populist Ross Perot, the Chair man was reluctant to go to the parents of America asking to "borrow their son to go to the Middle East so that this dude with seventy wives, who's got a Minister of Sex to find him a virgin every Thursday, can have his throne back ..." Reluctantly acceding to the combined momentum of presi 592</page><page sequence="13">He Coulda Bin A Contendah dential aspiration to greatness, a dramatic and public Congres sional vote and the blessing of the U.N. Security Council, the Chairman undertook for almost a month a mobilization so care ful, massive and deliberate it began to look remarkably like a flat-out stall. In what seemed an unceasing, constantly escalat ing demand for ever more forces it evoked acid references to Lin coln's Civil War General McClennan with his Army of the Poto mac. (That General, also popular with his troops, went on to run against the President who fired him.) Then having ensured so far as humanly and bureaucratically possible the military superiority of his troops, his attention went to the matter of their "honor." He called a halt, with the Presi dent's agreement, to the shameful spectacle of human carnage on the road to Baghdad which was unfolding live, in full color and gory detail, on CNN. Whether public relations or belated humanitarianism, both players have been belabored with the burden of that decision?"Who left Saddam in power?" Back in '88, again in '92, the Brother had been prominently mentioned as a possible GOP Vice Presidential nominee. Not wishing, his friends say, to be showcased as a token Republi can Black, the General declined to be so used. Naturally, this reluctance prompted considerable and lasting speculation in Republican circles as to whether the General might not indeed be a closet Democrat, and worse even, a liberal. A possibility that apparently occurred also to the Clinton Transition Team led by the redoubtable Vernon Jordan, the black Washington "power broker" who has managed to be described simultaneous ly as "best friend" both to Clinton and Powell. Thus for a moment in '92, it was widely rumored in D.C. that Powell's appointment to lead the State Department was only hours away. One Powell observer told Washington Post reporter Juan Williams, that he had believed the Powell nomination to have been "a done deal." So apparently the General was not un willing so far as that job was concerned, even from a democrat. "I know the Transition Team pushed that at the highest levels," the source continued. "It would have been a grand slam. Talk about a cabinet that looked like America; here you have a guy who really knows what he is doing and how to do it. He has what it takes to reassure the allies. And he really knows how the government works." However, that appointment was not made, a decision Clinton 593</page><page sequence="14">The Massachusetts Review may well have come to regret, because as he was to discover, Bro Powell does indeed know "how the government works," and as LBJ was fond of saying, "It's better to have them inside the tent pissing out, than outside pissing in." As Williams reported: "Several sources high in the Clinton Administration confirm that Powell was on the shortest short list to run the State Department. They say that he was ultimately vetoed by Clinton's political people who believed that in a crisis Powell's loyalty would not be to Clinton ..." One Clinton aide put it this way: "Colin Powell is Clinton's worst political night mare, a black war hero more moderate than he is." The first source went on to speculate that ultimately Clinton saw Powell as a rival and "Clinton doesn't know how to handle Powell because he is such a dominant guy." One can debate whether as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs and architect of victory in the Gulf, Powell was ever completely "inside" or "outside" the new administration's tent and hence the actual direction of the flow. What is indisputable, however, is that he was a 500-pound gorilla who indeed "knew how the government works," and that he was indeed, pissing. There were two instances where positions deeply held by Powell on his beloved military ran counter to the Administra tion's political imperatives: the use of force against Serb aggres sion and atrocity in Bosnia and Clinton's campaign pledge to lift the ban on gays in the military. In both cases Powell's judge ment is open to legitimate question, but in neither case does his behavior seem partisan in the usual sense. He had earlier convinced Bush that conditions in Bosnia reeked too much of Vietnam for U.S. force to be an option. That opinion did not change in a new administration that desperately wanted to dem onstrate its own decisive toughness and American leadership against large scale criminal atrocity in Central Europe. With Bosnia he apparently marshalled technical and cultural argu ments?inhospitable terrain, ethnic hatreds, warrior traditions, unclear interest?evoking dire, if unspoken political, images of a quagmire spewing out young Americans in body bags sent there by a Commander-in-Chief who never served. It worked. On the gay ban, Williams reports, "Powell thought he had Clinton's agreement to work with him on the issue. But a few weeks later Powell picked up the news papers to learn that Clinton was going ahead with his plan 594</page><page sequence="15">"He Coulda Bin A Contendah to lift the ban and would consult the military only on how and when it should be done. A defiant Powell then mounted a po litical response inside the military and among power brokers in Congress that sent a panicked White House back to Powell for help to avoid complete defeat on the Hill. Powell then engaged support in Congress and the Pentagon for the 'Don't Tell, Don't Ask, Don't Pursue' policy, a minor modification of the status quo that outraged Clinton's gay sup porters who had been promised total removal of the ban." Quite clearly, what in the General's view is best for the military is best for the country. Debatable, but not dishonorable. As Williams reports it got quietly hairy, as hairy as things get at that level. In both cases, Powell prevailed with his position becoming Clinton's position. The ban remains essentially in place and the U.S. has not used armed force against the Serbs. And in both cases the President has been left with political wounds, notably on the gay ban. As Clinton was going down in that fight, his political aides began to leak word to reporters that Powell's behavior amounted to "insubordination." The whis pered wisdom of the first few months of the Clinton admin istration was that in order to show that he could be tough, the President should fire Powell. [A reprise of the Truman/ McArthur unpleasantness.] That idea died a quick death. Powell's friends say the General initiated a quick tactical strike of his own. He spread the word that he might leave early. That move would have added to Clinton's troubles with the military, with Congress, and with black Americans. The charges of in subordination were quickly hushed up at the White House. So, as we say in the school yard, "ol' Colin ate their lunch. Yes he did." Which only caused the Democrats as early as '92 to have anxieties of their own about the Brother's politics and inten tions. To Democrats he was a Republican; to Republicans, a Democrat. Williams reports, A cabinet officer starkly warns, "He's going to be savaged if he gets into politics," adding that Powell is not accustomed to defending his integrity. According to this Clintonite, there is "only one thing to do if you're running against him and that's get him off the pedestal, quick. You don't have to talk to those high priced campaign consultants to figure that out. 595</page><page sequence="16">The Massachusetts Review Hammer at him, his integrity, find something in his past." All of which suggests that the General will fight. That he under stands the game not only of getting, but of using power. That he can count the votes and the odds. That he is fearless, clever, persistent and effective in honoring the trust?as he sees it?of those he leads. Perhaps that is what the multitudes flocking to his banner want in a leader and hope and imagine they see in him. But speaking for and representing the interests of the Ameri can soldier is one thing. Doing the same for the American people is quite another. That same deeply held, principled sense of loy alty to his troops?expanded to embrace all the people?would be unusual and refreshing, but infinitely more complicated. Just where would this black man lead or try to lead this country? Who would follow and who rebel? This is a prospect endlessly fascinating to contemplate; it would have been much more so to observe. Which is why his "American Journey" while predictably dis appointing in its reticence, is for that same reason very revealing. This is no post-modernist confessional, being less the story of a life, than a purposeful, public, triumphal account of a career in progress. It is no summing up, no clear the books, settle old scores, get it off my chest closing statement, but more of an in stallment on an unfinished narrative, the final pages of which are yet to be written. In this opera, the fat lady has yet to sing. The book subsumes within itself three genres of classic Ameri cana. Overall it is Algerian (Horatio that is, not Ben Bella): the rise to power and fame through simple virtues?hard work, honesty, patriotism?of a highminded youth of humble origins. Also it is Washingtonian in two distinctly different genres. In its resolute inoffensiveness to old patrons, in its uncritical ac ceptance, in their preferred terms, of a world constructed and managed by whites, it is classic Booker T. But ultimately, it is a contemporary Washington campaign biography: the carefully controlled advertisement for himself of an American politician seeking higher office. With malice towards none, it is addressed to the largest common denomination of the electorate. It offends no important group or interests; burns no political bridges; makes no hurtful judgements and maintains a tone of unre lieved charitableness and ineffable goodwill which is almost 596</page><page sequence="17">"He Coulda Bin A Contendah Forrest Gumpian in its quintessential^ American tone of willed innocence. The only exceptions coming, conspicuously enough in the references to America's villains, folks like Khaddafi, Sad dam Hussein, the Haitian generals, Manuel Noriega and the Nigerian people, Kipling's "lesser breeds without the Law." Given this pervasive guardedness and correctness of tone, the reader realizes early on to be alert to what is not there, that prom ising as great if not greater interest than what is. In its 612 closely set pages the author proves himself loyal and certainly no ingrate. He reveals that he thinks of Ronald Reagan as a kindly, if somewhat abstracted, "father figure." George Her bert Walker Bush, an affectionate "older brother." Which must be why, if the National Security Advisor had any personal or professional disagreement with his Father-Presi dent's unequivocal embrace and international defense of P.W. Botha's version of South African apartheid, we do not hear them. Reagan not only vetoed Congressional sanctions, but during this period Pretoria's diplomats were gleefully distributing tapes of a shameful speech by the American President which could have been and probably was, written in the Johannesburg BOSS (Bureau of State Security) office. Closer to his heart, given the Powell doctrine against the squandering of young American lives in the absence of vital national interests and clear and achievable military objectives, one looked eagerly for the commentary on the massacre of 247 Marines in Beirut and the cover-up invasion of tiny Grenada the next day. These are restrained to the point of evasiveness. A decently filial restraint? One does not, like the sons of Noah, discover a father's nakedness? Or a calculated unwillingness to alienate Reagan's many admirers who still vote? Or both deli cacy and policy? With Older Brother George, the same. Having served in the White House during the '88 campaign famous for the Willie Horton ad, the general was sometimes asked about his feel ings. "Was the ad racist? Of course. Did it bother me? Certainly ... it was a political cheap shot." Had he therefore lodged prin cipled objections? That we are not told, but the author quickly explains how he kept things in "perspective." "I had been given responsibility at the highest level in a Re publican administration. National Security Advisors to Presi 597</page><page sequence="18">The Massachusetts Review dent are not chosen as tokens. The job is real, demanding and critical. Never in the two years I worked with Ronald Reagan and George Bush did I detect the slightest trace of racial preju dice in their behavior. They had a party, however, whose prin cipal message to black Americans seemed to be: lift yourself by your bootstraps. All did not have bootstraps; some did not have boots. I wished Reagan and Bush had shown more sensitivity on this point. I took consolation, nevertheless, that their confi dence in me represented a commitment to the American ideal of advancement by merit." I know graduate students who would have a blast as they say, "decoding" that, particularly its last sentence. In this racially reflective mode he goes on to wish that "my career should serve as a model to fellow blacks ... of the possi bilities of American life ..." and ". . . that my rise might cause prejudiced whites to question their prejudices ... so that the next qualified African Americans ... would be judged by merit alone." While realizing that "over the years my career may have given bigots a safe black to hide behind: 'What, me prejudiced? I served with/over/under Colin Powell,' I have swallowed hard over racial provocations, determined to succeed by surpassing. Had I been more militant, would I have been branded a trouble maker rather than a promotable black? One can never be sure." Again, infinitely decodable, what? Certainly would have been more in teresting had the Brother continued on "to give bigots a safe black" not "to hide behind," but for which to vote in '96. The two pages from which the above is drawn is as direct an engagement of the issue of race, career and the Republicans as the 600 pages offer. Of the other dark star ascendant in that Re publican firmament, there is a yawning lacuna in the book. (A black hole from which no light escapes might be more apt an image.) One must believe, therefore, that in those close circles their orbits never intersected so that Bro General Powell never met Bro Justice Clarence Thomas or reflected on the lessons of that dark career. His thoughts, if any, on "elder Brother" George's utterly cynical nomination of Thomas to the Supreme Court seat formerly filled by Thurgood Marshall are not in this book. The book's concluding section is replete with the tradition al evocations of candidacy, except that here tney are artfully 598</page><page sequence="19">"He Coulda Bin A Contendah" couched in the future hypothetical. There is, while disclaim ing it, the marshalling of the popular demand. He is "flattered by my standing in the polls . . . moved by the encouragement . . . honored by the grassroots drafts ..." etc. We are disabused of the negatives "if I were to decide to enter politics it would not... be because I saw myself as a great black hope," nor "to provide a role model to black Americans or a symbol to whites of racism overcome." And instructed in the right?but because "I had a vision for this country... for solving the nation's problems" in which case there would be resolution and belly-fire enough. "I would not expect or desire to have anything handed me; I would fight for the right to lead. And I would enter not to make a statement but to win. I understand the battlefield. I know what winning takes." Whoie, I thought, on encountering the above: the brother am be running. Yasuh, he be running like a big dowg. Nor was I disabused on reaching the highminded Jeffersonism on which the book closed, "There is a debt of service due from every man to his country, proportioned to the bounty which nature and fortune have measured to him. As one who has received so much from his country, I feel that debt heavily, and I can never be entirely free of it. My responsibility, our responsibility as lucky Americans, is to try to give back to this country as much as it has given us, as we continue together our American journey." Let the church say ahmen! All of which, the structure, tone and language of the book, the timely national tour, the tantalizing public musings, seemed entirely too strategic. If the Old Soldier were not yet technically running, he certainly was, in accordance with military practice, setting up supply lines, mobilizing and inspiring the troops, selecting the terrain, scouting the enemy, disguising his strategy, in short all the functions involved in launching a campaign. Including the first law of military tactics: avoid encirclement, keep open the lines for strategic retreat should that be indicated. So in all but name the General was a candidate. To quote the late Everett Dirkson, "If it looks like a duck, walks like a duck, quacks like a duck, then by God, I call it a duck." 599</page><page sequence="20">The Massachusetts Review But even before seeing the book, I'd become convinced that our General was as susceptible as any of his Washington peers to the call to ever higher service. That was a given, a cultural reflex that went with the territory, onward and upward. Any thing else was positively unnatural. And why not? He had retired young and in triumph from offices higher than any his race had attained in this nation's history, with?so far as anyone knew?clean hands, an unsul lied reputation and a generous measure of celebrity. In Beltway talk, the "image" was "golden." Media exposure from the Gulf War had rendered him rich and famous. Before countless millions worldwide he had pronounced it and performed it. "We shall cut it (Saddam's Army) off, then we shall kill it." It had proved no idle boast but a calm, confi dent promise. Talking the talk and walking the walk, he was "Duke" Wayne at his cinematic best: the quintessential Amer ican soldier of popular cultural imagination. Thanks to CNN he'd had vastly more than his allotted fifteen minutes of fame and America its "honor" restored. Fate, a grateful nation and an ill-trained, poorly maintained, incompetently lead Third World army, had dealt him wonderful cards. Almost straight aces except perhaps for one black joker in the hand, dat rascally oV race card. But surely if anyone could, he could play over that. For it was otherwise a great hand. Widely perceived as symbol and architect of America's re stored military power and national honor, he was a "leader." His "negatives" were low, his visibility high and his "credi bility" a commodity increasingly rare and valuable, even high er. While it lasted, a great hand and a pocket full of chips. Not to be wasted by cashing in and quitting while ahead . . . but to be parlayed into fortune. "There is a tide in the affairs of man, dear Brutus, which if taken at the flood leads on to for tune . . ." Indeed, but in whose game, at which table and for what stakes? Already even the very highest rollers were inviting him into the big game, clearing him a seat at the high stakes table. Had not emissaries from the Democrats made discreet inquiries in '92? Clinton's running mate, or perhaps Secretary of State? Now on his own account, he appeared to be anteing up into the biggest game of all, the one for all the marbles, the whole hog! [Could I have been wrong all along, I wondered last fall. 600</page><page sequence="21">"He Coulda Bin A Contendah Could that mask of inscrutable apparatchik impassivity have all this time been concealing the passionate audacity of Jamai can rude-bwai defiance? "Go deh dreadie, go fe it yardie!" Music, lights: "for is a buf falo soljah, in the heart of America."] The foregoing are, of course, the terms in which Powell's prospects would have been expressed in the language of estab lishment political calculation. Like so much else in contem porary political discourse at that level, it was all image, which is to say perception. To the public the Powell presence was pure ephemera, a formless mist within whose unsubstantiality which any desire might be perceived. It had little to do with any of the concrete problems besetting the American people. For, at this point no one knew a damned thing about Powell's politics: liberal, moderate or conservative? Or even his party: Republican or Democrat? Yet the populace, or, at any rate, sections of it, without knowing where he stood on any of the contentious issues which so divided them, seemed quite prepared to pay attention and perhaps offer support. "When you see a toad hopping That apparent irrationality is a reflection of the un-centering of American politics. There is less of a clearly defined, stable core of values, will or shared vision at the center of national life than at any time in living memory. Indeed, the tone and level of political debate is more strident, superficial, debased and mean-spirited than I have ever seen it. The air [literally] is filled with rancorous, apparently irreconcilable arguments over the role of government, public policy, class warfare, racial division and preference, cultural diversity, moral standards and values, crime, violence and social disintegration. For many citizens it is a confusing and distressing time. Although this media-borne rhetorical onslaught is the cause of confusion and division, the deeply felt anxiety and alienation felt by so many does not originate there, that is well founded, as they say, "reality based." In almost every measurable category over the last thirty or so years the material circumstances of most citizens have deterio rated. For working Americans on all levels the technological revolution has not resulted in the promised prosperity or eco nomic security but in its opposite: a decline in their real incomes and their life prospects. Worse, these developments seem neither accidental, aberrant 601</page><page sequence="22">The Massachusetts Review nor temporary. They are the consequences of policy: the tri umph of an economic Darwinism whose effects are being so entrenched as to appear nearly irreversible. "Tomorrow will on ly be worse." So much so, that a people once characterized by ineffable optimism now regard the future with apprehension and dread. They fear that they are witnessing the gradual dis solution of the social contract by which their social identity, a civil society and a decent future for their children was suppos edly guaranteed. In this new world order there is a refurbished quasi-religious dogma?the Market Triumphant?like some primordial, god like force of the universe, irresistible and utterly beyond human intervention or control. It is an age of transnational corpora tions, many of them richer and more powerful than many na tions. Americans see themselves at the mercy of an unregulated capitalism which unchallenged, enables vast accumulations of private wealth while corporate avarice openly corrupts the democratic process. Both major parties, and all elected offices including the presidency are quite simply up for sale. In 1995, politicians spent $74 million contesting one-third of the Con gressional seats. In Massachusetts the contest for a single Senate seat cost the two candidates $17 million. Where does it all come from? Given the politicians' dependence on corporate bagmen, who in such an arrangement, represents the public interest? The public's impression of both parties as wholly owned sub sidiaries of corporate interests is compounded by the daily spec tacle of elected politicians scrambling to cripple the government they presumably serve, in its ability to regulate or tax private wealth. The proper term?I believe it is Chomsky's?for such an arrangement is kleptocracy?government by thieves. One result of this is the profound cynicism and defection from the political process by large segments of the public. Another is the Powell paradox: the desperate haste to embrace a political mystery not because of what they knew him to be, but because of what they hoped he was not. Not a "politician," but the un candidate, vaguely in but not of this hopelessly compromised world. As the people themselves said, his attraction was not political in the usual sense of issues, interests or stated policies for he had then expressed none. It was more vague, illusive, having to do with honor, decency and something called "character." "I think he is a fine upstanding man, it's hard to put into 602</page><page sequence="23">He Coulda Bin A Contendah words what he exemplifies." "He isn't as conservative as I, but the fact that he is an ethical man and a moral man goes a long way with me." "He is a very independent thinker, no one is go ing to push him around." "Colin Powell is a very good man." And the summarizing. "I just have more respect for Colin Powell than for other political figures." The comments are those of white Virginians, self-identified Republicans, at a Powell book signing. This perception of vir tue is at once his strength and his worst tactical affliction. Virtue may indeed be its own reward, but it does not fare well nor live long in the toxic mudpit that is a contemporary presidential campaign. One was not surprised, therefore, to read that both parties had been deploying "negative research" in a desperate search for anything ugly or damaging they might unearth in his personal history. ["Whadda mean you can't find anything? Dammit, the man's a soldier and a Jamaican. There must at least be women." "Yes, Sir, Mr. President, we'll keep looking."] "When you see a toad The impressions driving his popularity were based again on appearance, his media presence. People liked what they saw in the general's public persona. He managed always to look com posed, unpretentious, consummately in control both of him self, and the situation. He exuded a reassuring confidence that seemed entirely without arrogance. He was thoughtful, seeming always to weigh his words and opinions carefully, but not ap parently so as to evade anything, but to tell you more accurate ly what he actually thought and believed. And he spoke not in sound bytes or slogans but in clear, complete sentences. In his manner, a faint patina of the military?that understated author ity of command, that seriousness of purpose which the Romans called "gravitas." In a word, he looked to Americans "presi dential." No small thing in an age of media. Either you have it or you don't. (Poor Bob Dole.) Powell had it, especially in juxtaposition. On the one hand poor bedraggled Bill Clinton, in presence as "unpresidential" as one could imagine, dogged, however un fairly by the "character" issue, his non-service in Vietnam, and who could not quite escape the appearance of never having met a principle he could not finesse, compromise or flat out betray. (Who then could have anticipated his remarkable reinvention 603</page><page sequence="24">The Massachusetts Review only six months later as the people's last unwavering line of defense against iniquitous Republican designs on the "Amer ican Dream.") On the other side, the hardly more presidential stridency of a Gramm or Buchanan. Or the shameless self-reinvention of Dole or Wilson, cravenly abandoning lifetimes of principles at the dictate of focus group and poll results. By comparison they all seemed tawdry, expedient, so very "unpresidential." So that in September when the general casually let slip that he did not find "a comfortable fit in either party," he spoke to most Americans. But from him it did not seem at all self-serving, merely further evidence of his independence and candor. So too, when a few political positions began to filter out in conversa tions with journalists. These too appeared unrehearsed, refresh ingly free of calculation, a random selection of the General's independent views pandering to no group or special interest. As we saw, his positions on abortion, gun control and affir mative action incensed the far right. But so would his support for the death penalty, free market capitalism, reduction of gov ernment and the capital gains tax be anathema to liberals. This selection of issues seems so random that it was easy to miss the only important unifying element they shared. However poorly each might fare on either partisan fringe, they all com manded majority support in the middle of the political spec trum. Sheer unselective coincidence? Perhaps. Further reflection of the General's natural empathy with the feelings of the vast majority of his fellow citizens? Maybe. To me the package seemed rather more selective and strategic. In fact it seemed the outline of a very audacious and creative strategy based on astute reading of the popular mood. A strategy which went completely against received political wisdom and for which reason was completely out of character with the me thodical, cautious strategist of the early career. But even so. The only explanation consistent with all he was saying and doing pointed to one conclusion. The general was thinking the unthinkable, was exploring and seriously contem plating a realistic strategy to run for and win the American Presidency as an independent, whoi yoi! Obviously he was read ing the voter registration trends where for the first time voters registering as "independent" outnumbered those claiming ei ther party. And responding to the massive public disaffection 604</page><page sequence="25">"He Coulda Bin A Contendah with both parties and "politicians" as a species. It is a truism that no third party candidate had ever even come close to capturing the Presidency. But these were times without historical precedent. Besides which, third party candidates tra ditionally ran either on single issues or as the standard bearers of passionate minorities from either pole of the ideological spec trum. The general, on the other hand, was clearly intending to run from the extreme center, so to say, out of the very fundament of the establishment, and on a platform rabidly radical only in its moderation. Everything he did or said was consistent with such an in tention. The thoughtful public deliberation and refusal to be pushed into any premature declaration?yea or nay?was en tirely in character. But even in that, one could see a version of the masterly Jacksonian strategy of '80. Without declaring but trailed by cheering multitudes chanting "Run, Jesse, Run," Jackson had commanded unprecedented free media attention. For nearly a month it was "Will he, Won't he? What if he do? What if he don't?" while the declared candidates fumed and swore in New Hampshire's snow swept wastes and the media's comparative indifference. Powell's refusal to confirm or deny sure seemed to be history repeating itself. At this point I thought the odds 60:40 against his running. I was also convinced that the independent posture was the only one compatible with the cloak of virtue in which his supporters had bedecked him, and that if he did run he would win?at least a plurality of the popular vote. In my own informal poll more than three-quarters of the people who said they would vote for him, surprised me by qualifying "but only if he runs as an in dependent." (Obviously I don't know any Republicans.) Every thing about his career suggested that he would run only after being assured by the most reliable intelligence available that the numbers really were there; that the logistics of getting on the ballot were manageable and that financing was attainable. Which as it turns out was indeed being investigated. His advisors calculated that a successful primary campaign would require raising $12 million, which they assured him was "uphill but doable." By then there were "Draft Powell" committees working in thirty-eight states. They were reported "already doing the grass roots chores: recruiting volunteers, re searching filing requirements, making lists of potential con 605</page><page sequence="26">The Massachusetts Review tributors and supportive voters." This all had the appearance of a popular crusade, and unlike Ross Perot, the general was no flake. Gravitas, and Presidentiality. Clearly, the unemployed campaign professionals who began to flood his office with r?sum?s thought he was a viable candidate. So I too became a Powell watcher. If one item were missing there would be no declaration. But if it did come . . . help us, Jesus! This serious, careful man was not interested in symbolic gestures, "And I would enter not to make a statement but to win ... I understand the battlefield. I know what winning takes." I didn't much agree with his politics which only appeared "moderate" in context. At no previous time would they have been considered anything other than ultra-conservative, hard ly an improvement on the dismal status quo, yet I found my self hoping for a declaration. Why? A number of reasons. First among them, race. The General says that the issue never was broached on his book tour and I believe that. But this is America and "race never do not matter." It is therefore inconceivable, were the General to be in the race and with a real shot, that blacks?regardless of their politics and present "coolness" to his candidacy?could resist the impulse to register and vote for him in unprecedented numbers. Since this opportunity almost cer tainly would never occur again in this lifetime, anything less would defy the weight and conditioning of our history. Then again, the prospect of this candidacy held at least two intriguing questions. Were the General to win as an indepen dent, how would he govern? (He was not then a declared Republican.) Probably, I thought, not much differently than the present incumbent. But even the prospect of paralysis appealed to my anarchist instincts, a thoroughly paralyzed federal gov ernment being infinitely more interesting and desirable than the status quo. And, the most interesting and likely result: suppose he were to win the popular vote but not achieve a majority in the elec toral college? How would the Republican controlled House? if they still controlled it?dispose of the matter, especially if, as was very likely, the Republican nominee were third in the vot ing? And the Democrats, what if they had a majority? Would the vote be along partisan lines? Would they dare? How would the country, the Powell supporters with military backgrounds 606</page><page sequence="27">He Coulda Bin A Contendah" and especially the black communities respond? I have to confess that I contemplated this development with great if perverse glee. These wonderfully disruptive possibilities must have looked very different to the professional insiders advising the general. More the pity. But after still another pensive Powell hypothet ical, "If I were to run, it would probably be easiest as a Repub lican," my heart leapt down. "Say it ain't so, Colin, please say it ain't so," cried the small boy in me. But I feared it probably was. Certainly, it would be easier logistically and organizationally to run within the framework of an existing party apparatus. Also, the family thing?elder brother George's stern advice would certainly have been to keep it all in the family. And the fat-cat community's interest? That "doable" twelve million was for the presumably Republican primaries, would they be as gen erous to some maverick campaign outside the party that had been so exceedingly receptive to their pillaging of the nation? Clearly, the General had some very heavy options to weigh. To the Republican heavies Powell as independent was the Negro from Hell, Willie Horton's revenge. But safely domesti cated within the party he became Dr. Huxtable. If he promised to add the White House to the Congress they now controlled, and make real inroads into the Democrats' maddening monop oly of the black vote, what the hell, they could overlook the three apostasies. An editorial in the New York Times of October 31, captures that new pragmatism neatly. "In the 46 days since Mr. Powell announced moderate po sitions on abortion, affirmative action and gun control, the Republican Party has been in a turmoil of change. He's now exposed the secret that the fundamentalist right had been guarding . . . Mr. Powell's refusal to toe the Buchanan line has threatened the hold of the activist minority on the party's phi losophy and purse strings. If Mr. Powell can resist the pres sure to pander to the Buchanan-Falwell wing, he can realign the party around the fiscal conservatism and more libertarian social views . . . The shift has already had some remarkable impact on the GOP's moral authoritarians. Bill Bennett now says Republican voters are more interested in character and leadership than a perfect score on the litmus test issues. Bill Kristol, a model of 607</page><page sequence="28">The Massachusetts Review "ideological rigidity back when he was serving as Dan Quayle's brain . . . [now] thinks it's a terrible thing to have a chance to win the White House and blow it on Bob Dole or Phil Gramm. Already Mr. Powell's quasi-candidacy has . . . given a center to a party that only had a wing." May God forgive him. But on or about the 49th day, when the General upon calmer reflection, confided that, well, actually, he "shared many values with the religious right," he was almost certainly telling the truth. But could it also have been the first acknowledgment of "the pressure to pander"? The first small step down that slippery slope? If so, the bloom would quickly flee the rose, and Colin the Pure would quickly end up just another opportunistic polit ical hack?the proverbial "faded rose from days gone by." But even assuming the previously unthinkable: the General's success in the Republican primaries and the election? What would have really been accomplished? One of history's colossal ironies. America's first black president giving aid, comfort, re spectability and political cover to a party whose callous indif ference to the suffering of the poor; implacable hostility to the interests of the working class; and whose cynical exploitation of white racist impulses had so grievously impoverished the soci ety's spirit and damaged the hopes and prospects of the people who produced him. One hopes that it was this consideration, as much as any other, that contributed to the General's strategic withdrawal. October 1996. Pelham, MA. P.S.

Yet 608</page><page sequence="29">"He Coulda Bin A Contendah" when the Brother announced that having searched his soul and "listened to his heart," he had "failed to hear the call" and would thus "not be a candidate for elective office in 1996," there was an audible gasp of professional disappointment; their jobs hav ing been suddenly rendered immeasurably less interesting for the next nine months. But it was a decision one could understand. Like an earlier great black general, he too "had done the state some service." And they knew it. He had risen high, earned respect and its re wards?a fine house, generous pension and major monies in his purse. There was a wife to cherish, family to enjoy and old Volvos to restore. There are many compelling reasons why no normal, reason ably balanced human being not unhinged by blind ambition, would submit themself to what this country's presidential pro cess has become. To this private, dignified man they would have been overwhelming: the relentless invasion of your and your family's privacy; the near certain assassination of character and reputation by attack ads and attack press; the unceasing assault on integrity by manipulative handlers with their vocabulary of pander, spin, dissemble, and their quick willingness to casually and publicly "make-over" or "reinvent" your image and char acter at the drop of a poll. The daily indignity of having to beg money: premature peddling of influence or power you only hope to one day have. Collectively, an altogether dismaying and distasteful prospect. But even so, what about the demand? The enthusiasm, adula tion, the fervent importuning of the supporters? All very flatter ing, but an old story in politics. They all simply wanted their piece of the action he could deliver. Kemp, Bennett, et al. wanted it for the Republicans. Tsongas, Bradley, and Rudman for some ephemeral Third Party. The resume sending professionals wanted career opportunity and maybe later, a White House job. Even the committees of ordi nary, honest citizens wanted a standard-bearer and hero in their own particular image. But what did he want? And what did he really owe this col lection of strangers? If he weren't careful he could end up noth ing but a big black mule hauling the burden of other people's agendas and ambitions on his broad, willing back.

But also the nation, let us not forget, of Lincoln and Kennedy. The very same nation where only a few short years ago, a black athlete required round the clock, armed security just because he was fixing to break a white hero's record in a boys' game? The nation where in his wife's words, there were "too many nuts running around with guns"? And at issue here is no home-run record, but history itself. I suppose that this must be seen as evidence of heartening progress in the terms of debate. The question no longer being whether a black man could realistically hope to be elected Presi dent; but only whether having been so honored, he might rea sonably hope to escape with his life. It cannot have been an easy time. An unimaginably weary and wrenching time. "He just . . . walked . . . away?" Yes, he did and excitement left the room.

A week before his announcement the unctuously, always available George Will had, as his contribution to an orchestrated right-wing offensive, produced 22 snide, public questions for the General. Among them this: "Your friend Bob Woodward writes that after watching the Conservative Political Action Conference on CNN, you turned to a friend and asked, 'Can you imagine me, standing up and talking to these people?'" "What is it," shifted Will, "about 'these people' that makes talking to them so hard for you to imagine?" Well. . . Ten months later in San Diego Will got an answer of sorts. But when the General first looked down on the un broken sea of white that was the Republican Convention even my own imagination was challenged. What was he doing in that place? At the most nativist, fundamentalist, anti-immigrant, anti-labor, anti-government gathering of Americans since the Klan's decline as an organizational force in national life? In an assemblage reported to have officially proscribed the words "tolerance" and "compromise" from appearing in their plat 610</page><page sequence="31">"He Coulda Bin A Contendah" form; a gathering so representative that two-fifths of those in attendance reported annual incomes in excess of half a million dollars? What on earth would he, could he, say to them? What the leadership needed from him was clear enough and, as I thought, a little insulting. No longer a political threat, his dignified, defanged black presence could now safely be trotted out to project the diversity and inclusiveness which was other wise so conspicuously absent in the hall, the rank and file, or the leadership of the party. It all reeked of charade, but. . . "When you see a toad . . ." However, emissaries had been exchanged, lengthy negotia tions conducted and here he was. Had promises also been made, pledges given, deals struck? Why indeed was the brother stand ing there confronting, as it were, the hitherfore unimaginable? What, in fact, was in it for him? Quite simply a stage and a platform. Something very like an audition, our most recent Republican's first major political address to a national audience. In fact, two audiences and two distinctly separate agendas. On the one hand to pledge support ?pump up, if possible?public enthusiasm for a terminally weak Republican ticket. On the other hand and at the same time, an act of political self-definition: the graceful selling of himself to a curious nation. Inquiring minds, as they say, wanted to know . . . and he did not disappoint. It was indeed a redoubtable performance. Garnering, in a con vention week entirely made for television, not only the highest Neilsons, but also producing, hands down, the most impressive display of rhetorical virtuosity and nimble ideological dexterity of the entire political season. One looked in vain for the blue smoke, mirrors and snake oil we have come to expect, but if present, they were skilfully dis guised. It seemed all so sincere, courageous, responsible, even persuasive, smoothly combining as it did the artful artlessness of Reaganesque delivery with the firm and highminded vision of a Cuomo convention keynoter. All in all, as it skittered across the mined ideological landscape touching lightly down on all the high holy places of conservative orthodoxy, it came mighty damn close to the unimaginable: rendering hard line conserva tism with a human face. From their frequent and sustained bursts of applause, he ap parently made the faithful feel real good about themselves, their 611</page><page sequence="32">The Massachusetts Review vision and their party. About the fundamental Tightness and decency, as he presented it, of their standard political prescrip tions for the nation's ills, social and spiritual. More manifesto than blueprint, it was, like his book, irreproachable in the essen tial goodheartedness of its mainstream Americanism. It was again, "the American Dream," of which this "fellow citizen and retired soldier" was living, breathing embodiment; as it were, the metaphor become flesh. This being so it was in no way presumptuous or immodest that his primary subject was himself: his origins and "American Journey." A narrative of an American dream, as dreamt by a black immigrant family and lived by their son. "My parents came to this country more than seventy years ago . . . with nothing but hope and a willingness to work land ..." The work they found enabled a family and "allowed them to come home every Friday with the fruit of their labor, a decent wage bringing not only sustenance but dignity to the home." They, though "black and treated as second class citizens," were greatly strengthened by family values: "integrity, kindness, godliness ... a belief in the Almighty" and "in the promise of the Founding Fathers that in America justice will eventually triumph." A belief perhaps reinforced because in America "they found a compassionate land ..." and "a government that pro tected their labor, educated their children and provided help to their fellow citizens who were in need." This to folk who appear fully convinced that government is the enemy, public schools a waste of money and welfare the ruin ation of the poor. "Tell the Truth, Bro, and Shame the Devil!" However, that was then, seventy years ago. This is now. Today "in this richest nation on earth . . . the problems of poverty, of hunger, of poor health care, of inadequate housing ... tear at the roots of strong families. And for which government assistance is a poor substitute for good jobs." And "better jobs, wages and living standards for all Americans" requires eco nomic growth which can only be produced by "lessening the burden of taxes, cutting government regulations and reducing government spending." "Oh, Lord, when you see a Toad hopping . . ." A text, the inexorable logic of which, leads to the Republican fold. 612</page><page sequence="33">"He Coulda Bin A Contendah "I became a Republican because I believe, like you, that the federal government has become too large and too intrusive in our lives. We can no longer afford solutions that result in more entitlements, higher taxes to pay for them, more bureaucracies to run them and fewer results to show for them ..." But as the General cautioned, the cutting must be careful and ' 'compassionate. ' ' "We must convey to the American people . . . that we fight for welfare reform and other reforms not just to save money? but because we believe there are better ways to help Americans in need than the exhausted programs of the past." "We must," he enjoined sternly, "be firm but we must always be fair. We have to ensure that reduced government spending does not single out the poor and the middle class. Corporate welfare and welfare for the rich must be first in line for elimi nation." "We need to understand that it is the entitlement state not just the welfare state that must be reformed . . . and we must do it in a way that does not paint all government as the enemy. Ineffective government, wasteful government, excessive gov ernment is what we Republicans need to defeat." Let the church say ahmen! But Even the great engine driving these reforms must need itself be reborn or, at the very least, return to its origins: "as the party of Lincoln that must lead the crusade not only to cut off and kill discrimination but to open every avenue of edu cation and educational opportunity to all those still denied access ..." ". . . And where discrimination still exists, or where the scars of past discrimination still contaminate and disfigure the present, we must not close our eyes, declare a level playing field and hope it will go away ... It did not in the past and it will not in the future . . . We, the party of Lincoln, must rip it out branch and root." And, an inclusiveness that must begin with the party itself and to which his presence was testimony. "You all know," he declared resolutely, "that I believe in a woman's right to choose and that I strongly support affirmative action. And I was invited here by my party, because we are a big enough party?and big enough people?to disagree on individual issues and still work together for our common goal..." 613</page><page sequence="34">The Massachusetts Review "The Republican Party must always be the party of inclusion. The Hispanic emigrant who became a citizen yesterday must be as precious to us as a Mayflower descendant. The descendant of a slave or a struggling miner in Appalachia must be as wel come . . ." The Brother has retained a smattering of Yiddish so he is un doubtedly familiar with the word chutzpah. Which in that con text and to that audience is what it can only have been?the pur est chutzpah. But, apparently, the delegates ate it up, "root and branch." Unless of course, blindly obedient to the coaching-for the-camera to which we are told they were rigorously subjected, the enthusiasm was pure theatrics. But I did not think so. It all had been?speech and response?not at all what I had expected. Then I realized that I had had, in truth, no idea at all what to expect. But it patently was not what I had seen. "They sho aint," I mused, "no Clarence Thomas in that Brother. Nahsuh, he sho aint grown 'way from his raising." And I felt?as I suspect many in the audience must have?my first real, visceral rush of regret at his self-imposed absence. For, high drama though the moment had been, there also had been despite the shouting and the stomping, an element of the wistful, the what might have been, hovering about it all. "Those people" (Mr. Will?) cannot really have wanted or expected to have heard all that? Or could they? What?absent the all-seeing, all-revealing cameras?might their response have been? The General, proud and dignified black man that he is, must surely have been concerned with the prospect of rejection and public humiliation. Unless, of course, that possibility had previously been negotiated, with even the Buchanan delegates among them having been sternly reminded of the fiasco of '92. Except, of course, that the General had not really been talking to "those people" at all. Everything else issuing from that plat form was contrived and addressed to Mr. and Mrs. America, if not the ships at sea. So why not the General's star turn? The wistfulness and the purpose lay in his appealing not to the convention that was, but to the convention that might, per haps could, have been. The convention of a party of the imag ination: that collection of delegates?independents and moder ates of both parties?that his candidacy might have gathered together en route to the nomination of the imaginary party he had so eloquently just described. 614</page><page sequence="35">He Coulda Bin A Contendah" The audition played very well in Peoria, being better received (?how can they tell??) in television land than was the nomi nee two days later. He had his say and walked away . . . again. But he must have spent the last two months following with particular interest as the merciless polls map a campaign tra jectory which is sweeping the ticket completely off the radar screen. What went through his mind as he watched the candidate jettison a career-long commitment to fiscal responsibility in favor of a trickle-down fantasy that convinced no one but Steve Forbes? As he watches him pitch other long held principled positions over the side, while loudly and piously proclaiming that the candidates be judged on "character." It all seems to be making a prophet of Kristol, "it's a shame to have a chance at the White House and blow it. . ." All of which must seem very minor irony compared to the performance of the incumbent who seems to be successfully "dumbing down" the election. What can pass through the Gen eral's mind as he watches the President call off all bets, cancel all previous commitments, to scurry to occupy every single one of the positions with which Powell had identified himself a year earlier. The Democrat President running, and apparently suc cessfully so, as a Powell Republican? Though in fairness, much of the credit for this strategy's success must go to Dole's spec tacular ineptitude. Will he reflect that what, in a minimally responsible political climate, would be seen as transparently cynical, and failed expe dience, seems to be working. In which case it is much more likely to become in the debased political culture of the times, a veri table model for future campaigns? What will the General learn from this? "When you see a toad hopping . . ." Nor will he have missed the reports of the public's growing disaffection. The piteous refrain "there's no one to vote for, only against. " And the uneasy downsizing of the projected voter turn out as history's most expensive election draws near. What if they gave an election and nobody won? Whatever the result on November 5th, one suspects that the General will be revisiting his decision of last October. The tide not taken at the flood, will it rise again? Four years is a long time, and how true it is, figuratively speaking, that "old sol diers never die?" 615</page></plain_text>
