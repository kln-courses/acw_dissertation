<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS. Religion. Frazer. 15 Spirits of the Corn and of the Wild. By J. G. Frazer, D.C.L., LL.D., Litt. D. Two vols. London: Macmillan, 1912. The new edition of The Golden Bough grows apace. The last part reviewed in these pages was The Dying God. Adonis, Attis, Osiris, the next in order, had been published in 1906. It was, as its title intimates, an expansion of the fourth, fifth, and sixth sections of the third chapter of the second edition, amounting to a re-writing of those sections. The two new volumes represent the remainder of the third chapter and second volume of that edition. The greater part of them is occupied with agricultural rites; but with the corn-spirit conceived as an animal the author passes to the more general discussion of the propitiation of wild animals and other relations of mankind to them. Having in Adonis considered the divinities of the Near East, Professor Frazer turns to Dionysus and Demeter He carefully traces their legends and rites over the Greek world. The additional evidence abundantly confirms his previous conclusions as to their real character; and he adduces reasons for holding that Dionysus was originally "a deity of agriculture and the corn," or "of fertility in general, animal as "well as vegetable." In the case of Demeter, a difficulty as to the date of the offering of first-fruits arises upon the seventh idyl of Theocritus. The poet describes it as taking place in the island of Cos on an autumnal day. Professor Frazer suggests that it was performed immediately before the ploughing, and in view of the renewed agricultural operations suspended during summer. Greek gratitude may have been emphatically a sense of favours to come. But a festival of first-fruits implies that the harvested grain has not hitherto been utilised. The first-fruits are literally offered to the god. In an earlier state of society, as the author points out, the crop is often looked upon as itself an uncanny being, mysterious, sacred, that requires desacralising; though it is perhaps going too far to describe it as a divinity. Hence a solemn ceremonial meal- a sacrament-is necessary, sometimes partaken of by the whole community, sometimes by the chief or the priest as its representative. Whatever form it may take, this ceremony it is that liberates the bulk of the crop for the use of mankind. Can we really suppose that the Greeks forbore to eat of the new harvest (which was doubtless reaped then as now in April and May) until September or October ? Of course, if Demeter were identified, as Dr. Frazer suggests, with the seed-corn, and Persephone with' the ripe ears, the first-fruits may have been offered to the latter upon the conclusion of the harvest, and a further ceremony addressed to Demeter may have taken place before the ploughing: Indeed we know that such a ceremony called expressly Proerosia, was held at Eleusis, and that the Sicilians celebrated the maiden when the corn was ripe and Demeter at the time of sowing. It would seem, therefore, that the festival described by Theocritus was not strictly a feast of first-fruits, but that the tribute of first-fruits from far countries to Eleusis in view of the Proerosia had influenced its character, even in the island of Cos, by the [ 25 ]</page><page sequence="2">No. 15.] MAN. [1913. time of Theocritus. At any rate there is something to be explained, and the meagreness of our information does not enable us to do so at present. Coming to the modern harvest customs in the west of Europe, may I first of all suggest that the title, de greaute meaur, conferred at Unna in Westphalia on the last sheaf, is the dialect form of die grosse Mutter, or die Grossmutter, not the Grey iMother? This would account for the t, and would bring the name inito line with others noted by Manuhardt. On looking at Mannhardt's Forschungen, p. 319, I see that he does in fact so interpret the expression. Professor Frazer has doubtless overlooked the passage. Another point, but again a very small one, is that Kuhn, who reports it, limits the custom to the rye harvest. The best corn in Kent was (according to the testimony of the Rev. Mr. Walter, Fellow of Christ's College, Cambridge, given to Brand) made up into a figure called, somewhat strangely, the Ivy Girl. It was brought home with the last load of corn; but Dr. Frazer does not tell uls what was done with it. Another passage in Brand seems to throw some light on the question. Under the head of "Shrove Tuesday," a communication to the Gentleman's Magazine, dated in 1779, is quoted, in which the writer, a lady, says: "Being on a visit on Tuesday [Shrove Tuesday] " in a little obscure village in this county [east Kent], I found an odd kind of sport going forward; the girls from eighteen to five or six years old were assembled in a crowd, and burning an uncouth effigy, which they called a Holly Boy, and which, " it seems they had stolen from the boys, who in another part of the village were assembled together and burning what they called an Ivy Girl, which they had stolen " from the girls. All this ceremony was accompanied with loud huzzas, noise and " acclamations. What it all means I cannot tell, although I inquired of several of * the oldest people in the place, who couild only answer that it had always been a sport at this season of the year." Evidently the custom was in a late stage of decay. But assuming the Ivy Girl to be identical with the best sheaf at Harvest Home, as seems probable, we have another illustration to add to Professor Frazer's list of the close connection between the agricultural rites of autumn and spring. It is interesting that the sheaf is neither given to the cattle, nor its seeds mixed with the sowing corn, but it is burnt. Has the ceremony been contaminated with that of carrying out Death ? The old witch is burnt in the East Riding, but that rite is performed on the last day of harvest. To discuss the questions that arise on consideration of this Kentish rite would, however, take too much space to be attempted here. Iu enumerating the marks of a primitive ritual in harvest customs the author includes as one of them that "spirits, not gods, are recognised." The paragraphs of enumeration are taken from the second edition, and I regret he has not availed hVmself of the opportunity to reconsider the wording at least of this item. Nowhere, I think, is the corn-maiden, or whatever it may be called, and whether male or female, whether in human or animal form, spoken of by the peasant as a spirit. The peasant is probably by no means clear in his own mind what it is, even where he really believes in its objective existence. It is not to be wondered at, therefore, if we are at some loss for a term for it. It may be convenient to generalise it under the term spirit. But I venture to think we should never lose sight of the fact that this cannot be asserted to be the peasant's view. Here it would have been quite sufficient to lay down the negative proposition that the corn-maiden and similar beings of the popular imagination are not gods, without going on to say what they are, especially as the definition of a spirit given in the text lies open to one or two objections. When Professor Frazer comes to write that further work on Com- parative Religion, which he has promised, and to which he alludes in the preface to these volumes, be may have to find a new definition not entirely compatible [ 26 J</page><page sequence="3">1913.] MAN. [No. 15. with the one here given. It is clear, too, that if he be right in his main conten- tion, the beings in question may become gods, a possibility not alluded to in this paragraph, and this possibility may further affect the definition of a spirit. He is a little exercised to account for the double personification of the corn as Demeter and Persephone. But if once the corn (or barley) be regarded as a corn- mother, as the name of Demeter would seem to show, is not a corn-child suggested by antithesis ? One would think it inevitable. The puzzle, indeed, is rather why the personification was not oftener double. It is quite certain that the process would have been accelerated, though perlhaps not (as Dr. Frazer thinks) caused, by the growth of anthropomorphism. Here and elsewhere he is, I submit, hardly enough inclined to allow for the vagueness and fluidity of savage ideas. There is but little correlation in this respect between belief and ritual. The latter is often fully developed, and comparatively permanent, while the former is uncertain and even contradictory. The theory of the growth of story out of rite is built upon this proposition. All this part of the subject is closed by a masterly summary of the analogies between the savage rites and those of the European peasantry, taken with a few additions from the second edition. Dr. Frazer's method has often been criticised. There may be-there is-force in the contention of the new Germanl anthropological school tbat, until you know the culture of any area or people from top to bottom, you cannot be quite sure that you interpret a given rite correctly. The point cannot be discussed now. But at least we may say that when an interpretation is founded on an induction so wide as Dr. Frazer's, there is a presumption of its accuracy. Moreover, he has not been insensible of the necessity of showing the relations between cultiure and rite, and of putting the reader in a position to judge of the interpretation proposed. In Adonis he brought before us with singular vividness the civilisation and environment of the peoples with which he was dealing. He was enabled to do so because he was chiefly concerned with historical investigations, and he dealt with a very few examples. In these volumes it has been different; he has thrown his net widely. Even here, however, he has been anxious to give us the whole of the evidence, and generally the very words of his authorities. It is doubtful whether he has not been too liberal in his quotations and in his digressions. The danger is lest his readers should not see the woo(l for the trees. The summaries from time to time do something to avert that danger. Nor can he be fairly accused of shirking the weak points of his evidence, or of slurring over its occasional slenderness. Leaving anthropomorphic representations of the corn-spirit, the discussion pro- ceeds to the lower animals. First, they are treated as representations of the corn-spirit, or the spirit of vegetation in general. I am doubtful, in spite of the name Bouphonia, whether the ox offered at that festival can be shown to have been slain in such a capacity. The choice of the animal to be sacrificed fell on that one out of the herd, which, when driven round the altar of Zeus Polieus, ate the barley anid wheat previously laid before the god. Was this anything more than ain ordinary case of divination which animal would be acceptable ? The ceremonial connected with first-fruits is then considered, both sacramient and sacrifice. Afterwards, with an interesting clhapter on killing the divine animal we approach the general subject of the relations between men and the lower animals, including their propitiation, the transmigration of souls, and types of animal sacrament. Is Professor Frazer correct in construing a verse of the prophet Habbakuk to mean that the Hebrew fisherman sacrificed to his net ? The passage in which it occurs is, at least in our translation, obscure and confused; but it seems to me that the imagery is taken from a Chaldean, not from a Hebrew, custom. The prohibition to break the bones of animals killed for sacrifice or food is illustrated by custom and [ 27 ]</page><page sequence="4">Nos. 15-16.] MAN. [1913. also by story. Among the stories we miss that of Thor, who on a journey slew one night for food the goats that drew his chariot, and commanded his host, a peasant, to put the bones together in the. goat-skins. But the peasant's son broke one of the bones to get at the marrow; and in the morning, when Thor by means of his hammer, Mjolnir, restored the goats to life, one of them limped. The god was wroth, divining what had been done, and was only mollified by compensation in the persons of the countryman's son and daughter, who became his slaves. This tale, exhibiting as it does the god's anger for the trespass and the compensation exacted, would have been even more to the point than those to wbich reference is actually, made. The singing rite performed by Kaffir girls, as related by Mr. Kidd, does not seem to be in honour of the insect pests of the fields, but an appeal to ancestors for aid against them. It would have been well to note, in describing the Toda sacrament from Marshall, that Dr. Rivers did not find a trace of it, and so far as this negative evidence goes the ceremony requires confirmation. In the Bulgarian carnival rites mentioned, Vol. II, p. 332, it may be suggested that the dressing up by youths as girls and by girls as youths, and the striking of passers-by with clubs by certain of the masqueraders are fertility charms not intended to influence the ground, but the persons themselves. There is another rite mentioned in Dr. Frazer's authority, but the mention of which he has not reproduced, namely, that on the Monday ("Cheese-Monday ") marriageable girls do not dare to allow themselves to be seen alone in the street, for the Kukeri (pl. of Kuker) are going round individually armed with hooked sticks called Kliink, with which they strike any girl they meet (Arch. Religionswiss. xi, 409). Mannhardt has collected many similar instances, and there can be little doubt the interpretation is the same. Similarly the belief in several cases referred to in the first volume, that the person who takes a certain part in the harvest ceremonies will soon be married, seems really to mean that she (or he) will sooIi be blessed with children, and is perhaps a case of a fertility charm degenerating into augury. Compare with this belief the rites at prehistoric rude stone monuments, especially in France, performed indiscriminately by women who wish for children and by girls who desire husbands; and the carnival custom of playing at football, the married on one side and the single on the other, in which the victory of the married is prearranged. I will only add to these observations, for the length of which I apologize, that, in view of the fact that Prof. Frazer's position with regard to the origin and content of religion has been so often misunderstood, the disclaimer in the preface is timely. Religion has, and has always had, other sources than anxiety about the food supply; and important as are the rites concerned with food, there are others equally importanlt. The study of them will perhaps take us still deeper down into the hidden springs of human belief and action. E. SIDNEY HARTLAND.</page></plain_text>
