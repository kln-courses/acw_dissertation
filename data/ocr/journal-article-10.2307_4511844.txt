In the about 70 pages devoted to the 154 species discussed here, it is evident that as in other areas, some species have retreated from urban life whereas others have adapted to and even flourished in it. Here, based on 60 years of observations, the breeding species, including two falcons and two owls, number 41: migrants, 118; winter residents, 49; permanent residents, 12; and irregular visitors, 10.-Leon Kelso. 82. Mimicry in Plants and Animals. Wolfgang Wickler. 1968. World University Library, London. 255 pp. $2.45, paperback. (Translated from the German by R. D. Martin.)-Mimicry can be loosely defined as the evolution of a morphological or behavioral pattern that resembles the pattern of another organ- ism or thing. It is often brought about by realizing gain through confusing some third organism. The classical case, of course, is that of certain tasty (to birds) butterflies that have come to resemble certain distasteful butterflies, and are thus avoided by the avian predator. However, Wickler leads us through a world of all kinds of other mimicry in all kinds of animals, some examples being so fantastic that they are difficult to believe. This is an exciting book of scientific exploration into natural history, delivered in an excellent translation and sprinkled with fas- cinating pictures, many of which are in color. At this bargain price the book should be in the collection of anyone who has even a passing interest in wild things. -Jack P. Hailman. 83. Numerical Taxonomy. A. J. Cole, editor. 1969.

They are indicative of the invasion of biology by the prac- titioners of mathematical science. Chemists and physicists are likewise exploiting it as evidenced by many articles of bird interest appearing in their journals.- Leon Kelso. 86. Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story. Richard Bach. 1970. Macmillian, N. Y. 93 pp. $4.95.-There are two kinds of anthropomorphism, I've decided: one kind uses us, as we think we are, to explain animals that we don't understand; the other uses animals to understand ourselves better. Jonathan wanted to fly well: "Seagulls, as you know, never falter, never stall. To stall in the air is for them disgrace and it is dishonor." To compare Richard Bach with Poe is unduly strained, but there are touches of prose that do border on poetry. The story, such as it is, I must leave for you, with only the note that Russell Munson's fine photographic studies in black-and-white in no way detract from this surprisingly delightful little book.-Jack P. Hailman. SPECIAL REVIEW ON "PETERSON" FIELD GUIDES 87. A Field Guide to the Insects of America North of Mexico. Donald J. Borror and Richard E. White. 1970. Houghton Mifflin Co., Boston. x + 404 pp. $5.95.-The ornithologist's reaction might well be "it's high time someone wrote a field guide to bird food." Field Guide no. 19 of the "Peterson"} series is destined to wind up in the library of most of us interested in avian ecology as well as the pockets of those who merely love creepy-crawly things. And yes, this is the same Borror whose fine work on bird song is well known. Whereas the ultimate proof of a field guide is in the using, this one has all the earmarks of being a truly fine one. Used properly, it should allow the rankest of amateurs to identify any American insect to family. What? Not to species? Well, consider the magnitude of the problem: for every bird species there are more than</page></plain_text>
