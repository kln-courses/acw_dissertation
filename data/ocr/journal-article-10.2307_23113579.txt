<plain_text><page sequence="1">JAMES O'ROURKE Death and Error in "Shelley Disfigured" "Shelley Disfigured" occupies a curious position in Paul de Man's work. This is an essay for which de Man makes both an uncharacter istically extravagant claim and even more extravagant disclaimers. The claim, found in the Preface to The Rhetoric of Romanticism, is that in contrast to the "failure" of the other essays in this collection to "coalesce ... in a manner that easily allows for dialectical progress, or ultimately, historical totalization," "The only place where I come close to facing some of these questions about history and fragmenta tion is in the essay on Shelley's "'The Triumph of Life.'"1 But within "Shelley Disfigured," de Man repudiates the essay even as he writes it, telling us that any interpretive strategy based on the belief that language "can be a source of value and has to be celebrated or de nounced accordingly" inevitably "functions along monotonously pre dictable lines, by the historicization and the aesthetification of texts, as well as by their use, as in this essay, for the assertion of methodo logical claims made all the more pious for their denial of piety." (RR 122; my emphasis). The phrase "as in this essay" brings the character istically de Manian theme of the inevitability of error within the bor ders of an essay that significantly revises some of de Man's well known earlier essays on Romanticism, particularly "Time and History in Wordsworth," "The Intentional Structure of the Romantic Image" and "The Rhetoric of Temporality." The difficulty of placing "Shelley Disfigured" within de Man's canon is exacerbated by the degree to which it diverges from, and in some cases seems to contradict, other essays, such as "Anthromporphism and Trope in Lyric," "Aesthetic Formalization in Kleist," "Excuses (Confessions)" and "Phenomenality and Materiality in Kant" that are often thought of as de Man's last words. To play along with de Man's pun on figure and face, I will suggest that the conclusion of "Shelley Disfigured" is primarily about what we are willing to face up to, and that de Man's readers have been unwilling to follow the most obvious direction that "Shelley Disfigured" offers to its interpreters. When de Man insists that Shel ley's "defaced body is present in the margin of the last manuscript page and has become an inseparable part of the poem" (RR 120), he is first of all making a somewhat macabre joke at the expense of Don Criticism, Winter 1992, Vol. XXXIV, No. 1, pp. 1-25 Copyright ® 1992 Wayne State University Press, Detroit, Michigan 48202 1</page><page sequence="2">2 James O'Rourke aid Reiman and G. M. Matthews, who engaged in a critical contro versy over whether a handwritten phrase in the margin of the final manuscript page of "The Triumph of Life" reads "Thus I kiss you Jane" or "Thus I kiss you Julie," and over whether this notation tells us that Shelley did, or didn't, have an affair with Jane Williams.2 But for a reader who knows that "Shelley Disfigured" is an essay written late in his career by a man who died four years later of cancer, there is a clear suggestion of another body inhabiting the margins of "Shelley Disfigured." When de Man concludes that "The final test of reading, in The Triumph of Life,' depends on how . . . one disposes of Shelley's body" (RR 121), he poses a grim challenge to the readers of "Shelley Disfigured." It is this figure of de Man, the dead de Man, that makes "Shelley Disfigured" truly "anti-human," and makes the self-critique of "as in this essay" more than an interpretive parlor trick. "Shelley Disfigured" both participates in and resists (in de Man's terms, celebrates and denounces) ideas that are pervasive in de Man's work, though more often as targets than as causes; romanticism, liter ary history, dialectical progress, and aesthetic ideology could serve as a short list. De Man's claim for "Shelley Disfigured," that this essay might "come close to facing" questions evaded in his earlier essays on romanticism suggests some hermeneutic progress, and a comparison of passages from "Shelley Disfigured" and some of de Man's earlier essays, most notably "The Rhetoric of Temporality," shows that this progress is indeed dialectical; it depends upon the commission and rectification of a previous error. In "Shelley Disfigured," de Man po lemicizes that "what we have done with the dead Shelley, and with all the other dead bodies that appear in romantic literature ... is sim ply to bury them, to bury them in their own texts made into epitaphs and monumental graves" (RR 121). This is not simply a rhetorical "we"; "we" is meant to include de Man himself, since he performed such a monumentalizing burial for Wordsworth at least twice, first in "Time and History in Wordsworth" and then in "The Rhetoric of Temporality." In his discussion of the Boy of Winander passage from The Prelude in "Time and History in Wordsworth," de Man notes the revision in which the passage is transposed from first to third person and calls the final version "the autobiography of someone who no longer lives written by someone who is speaking, in a sense, from beyond the grave," and an "epitaph written by the poet for himself, from a perspective that stems, so to speak, from beyond the grave."3 Both the "beyond the grave" theme and the qualifying aside ("in a</page><page sequence="3">"Shelley Disfigured" 3 sense," "so to speak") recur in "The Rhetoric of Temporality," where a similar qualifier ("as it were") will support a central theme of that es say, the distinction between the linguistic self and the empirical self. In "The Rhetoric of Temporality," de Man arrives at the same con clusion as in "Time and History in Wordsworth" after a more elabo rate argument dealing with the role of death in Wordsworth's poetry. De Man first identifies two potential "negative moments" in Words worth's poetry, "the loss of self in death or in error."4 But in his sub sequent reading of "A Slumber Did My Spirit Seal," de Man describes Wordsworth surmounting error, "the mystified world of the past" rep resented in the poem's first stanza, through "the de-mystifying power of death." This allows Wordsworth, according to de Man, to assume "a stance of wisdom," in which he "sees things as they actually are" (B1 224). Such positivistic language indicates that the problems of "The Rhetoric of Temporality" go far deeper than the residual appear ance of "the thematic vocabulary of consciousness and temporality" (xii) that de Man noted in his Foreword to the second edition of Blindness and Insight. The distinction made in "The Rhetoric of Temporality" between an intelligible or linguistic self and an empiri cal self depends upon exempting Wordsworth the poet from the neg ative moment of death, and de Man continues to grant this exemp tion quite emphatically in Wordsworth's case. De Man insists that if we ask "whether Wordsworth could have written in the same manner about his own death ... for the informed reader of Wordsworth, the answer is affirmative. Wordsworth is one of the few poets who could write proleptically about their own deaths, and speak, as it were, from beyond their own graves" (BI 225). The casual qualifiers—"as it were," "in a sense," "so to speak"—that blur the line between the lit eral and the figurative and allow a purely linguistic reality to exert power over empirical circumstances are what de Man no longer al lows in "Shelley Disfigured." He offers the first hint that such eva sions have become unbelievable in "Autobiography as De-Facement," where he comments on Wordsworth's "Essays Upon Epitaphs" that "The dominant figure of the epitaphic or autobiographical discourse is, as we saw, the prosopopoeia, the fiction of the voice-from beyond-the-grave" (RR 77). The figurative nature of "as it were" is no longer hidden in a seemingly insignificant qualifier; that figuration is now foregrounded by being given a precise rhetorical name: prosopo poeia. The rejection of this fiction becomes far more violent in "Shelley Disfigured" when Shelley's drowned body, the "empirical self" of the</page><page sequence="4">4 James O'Rourke "Rhetorical of Temporality," becomes the governing term in "The Triumph of Life." In "Shelley Disfigured," interpretation can no longer end in figures of speech; rather, "figuration and cognition are actually interrupted by an event which shapes the text" (RR 120). The priorities accorded the terms "actually" and "event" deny the power of figures of speech to subsume material realities, and this represents an emphatic rejection of the "rhetorical terminology" of "The Rhetoric of Temporality" that, in the Foreword to the second edition of Blind ness and Insight, was offered by de Man as a "productive" event in his career. One meaning of "disfigure" in "Shelley Disfigured" is the de lusory imposition of meaning on randomness, but de Man posits Shelley's death as having finally overcome these impositions of "figuration and cognition." The actual event is beyond the power of language to disfigure into meaning, and hence "The Triumph of Life" is said to perform an exemplary function as, de Man says, it "warns us that nothing, whether deed, word, thought or text, ever happens in relation, positive or negative, to anything that precedes, follows or exists elsewhere, but only as a random event whose power, like the power of death, is due to the randomness of its occurrence" (RR 122). Even as de Man warns against believing in relations, he constructs a simile ("like the power of death") that stands as a master trope, but one whose power resides in its ability to put an end to tropes. Shel ley's drowning and its exemplary message stand in a curious relation of tenor and vehicle; the text shaped by the actual, random event of Shelley's drowning is the material signifier, the tenor, that stands in a "like" relationship to only one conceptual vehicle: death. Any other transposition from the material to the conceptual level is dismissed as sheer evasion. De Man abjures "the metaphorical substitution of a first person subject by a third person subject, 'the boy' for that, in de Man's account, rescued Wordsworth from the figurative drown ing of the Boy of Winander. Much of the force of de Man's condemnation of such monumental izing burial must derive from his embarrassment at the banality of the conventional theme of poetic immortality (ars longa, vita brevis) that he endorsed in "The Rhetoric of Temporality" and "Time and History in Wordsworth." Wordsworth was not the only poet so im mortalized by de Man at that time; in "Lyric and Modernity," also published in 1969, de Man says of Mallarme's "Tombeau de Verlaine" that "Like all true poets, Verlaine is a poet of death, but death for Mallarme means precisely the discontinuity between the personal self and the voice that speaks in the poetry from the other</page><page sequence="5">"Shelley Disfigured" 5 bank of the river, beyond death" (BI 181). This "voice that speaks in the poetry" is repeatedly uncovered in de Man's later work as a mere critical figure, a metaphor in "Semiology and Rhetoric," where de Man describes "the term voice" (de Man's italics) as "a metaphor in ferring by analogy the intent of the subject from the structure of the predicate,"5 or a prosopopoeia in "Autobiography as De-Facement," "that "posit[s] voice or face by way of language" (RR 81). This is the trope that is most decisively undone in "Shelley Disfigured" when de Man identifies the faceless ("defigure") Rousseau with the "trajectory" of "The Triumph of Life" "from erased self-knowledge to disfigur ation" (RR 100) and denounces the "endless prosopopoeia by which the dead are made to have a face and a voice" as an effect of "the madness of words" (RR 122). The distrust of "words" in "Shelley Disfigured" is not a consistent position for a critic who described the adoption of a rhetorical termi nology as a productive turning point in his own career, and this in consistency is not simply a matter of de Man's views evolving over time. In an even later essay than "Shelley Disfigured," the title essay of The Resistance to Theory, de Man makes the bemusing claim on behalf of his critical practice that "Technically correct rhetorical read ings may be boring, monotonous, predictable and unpleasant, but they are irrefutable."6 In an interview conducted in 1983 and pub lished in that same volume, he suggested that he might be at the end of his reticence on questions of politics and ideology because he felt he now had some degree of control over "technical problems of language" (RT 121). A belief in the reliability of rhetoric is at the core of "The Rhetoric of Temporality," but this belief is the most vulnera ble (in de Man's terms, the blindest) part of that essay. De Man be gins the essay by promising to disentangle "the association of rhetori cal terms with value judgments that blur distinctions and hide the real structures" (BI 188). After deconstructing the poetics of the sym bol as a "tenacious self-mystification" (BI 208), de Man grants a prior ity to allegory not on rhetorical grounds (as, for example, metonymy subsumes metaphor in "Reading [Proust]") but because allegory sup posedly "corresponds to the unveiling of an authentically temporal destiny" (BI 206) that finally reveals "the de-mystifying power of death" (BI 224). "The Rhetoric of Temporality" not only fails to pur sue its arguments in rhetorical terms rather than in "value judg ments," since de Man's insistence that "an eternal insight into the rocky barrenness of the human predicament" (BI 224) shows "things as they actually are" (BI 223) is not a premise that can be argued in</page><page sequence="6">James O'Rourke linguistic terms, but the essay does not even live up to its own criteria for distinguishing mystification from demystification. One page after de Man asserts "the de-mystifying power of death," he forgets the distinction between fact and fiction and gives even this barren insight a redemptive spin as it becomes the knowledge that allows Words worth to speak "as it were, from beyond [his] own grave" (BI 225). "The Rhetoric of Temporality" becomes vulnerable to deconstruc tion in its turn as it moves beyond the deconstruction of the poetics of the symbol and attempts to define what sort of wisdom can take the place of that mystification. But "Shelley Disfigured" is far less willing to offer any "wisdom," or any coherent direction, for criticism. The displacement in "Shelley Disfigured" from "rhetoric" to "disfig urement" as the most rigorous term for language poses severe prob lems for de Man's readers. De Man seems to defy anyone to say any thing about "Shelley Disfigured" when he denies the possibility of re lation in the most emphatic terms possible, contending that "nothing, whether deed, word, thought or text, ever happens in relation, posi tive or negative, to anything that precedes, follows or exists else where" (RR 122). "Shelley Disfigured" says, in effect, that any essay that claims to be about "Shelley Disfigured" cannot possibly achieve such a relation. Deborah Esch draws out the oxymoronic character of this challenge when she writes that "the theory of language (and the concomitant theory of reading) that de Man generates out of "The Triumph of Life" stands in a position of instructive interrelation to Shelley's own explicit theorizing ... on the nature and function of poetic language."7 Although Esch does not address the question of how her own essay can claim a critical interrelation with a text that repudiates that possibility, she does, indirectly, raise the question of the status of "Shelley Disfigured." Only if Esch's claim that "Shelley Disfigured" says something important about Shelley is true is there any point to the fanatically detailed close reading of "The Triumph of Life" in "Shelley Disfigured." But if Esch's claim is true, then de Man's conclusion to that reading is untrue, since de Man's reading it self would construct a relation between "Shelley Disfigured" and "The Triumph of Life." This paradox brings us to the core of de Man's contradictory valorizations of rhetoric and randomness. In practical terms, we can ask how and why an essay that invests so much en ergy into the close reading of Shelley can then deny that it is possible for one text, or one thought, to approximate another. The directions that "Shelley Disfigured" takes in response to this inevitable self-questioning are duplicitous and dense. De Man con</page><page sequence="7">"Shelley Disfigured" 7 denses the claims for and against his own essay in its penultimate sentence: "Reading as disfiguration, to the very extent that it resists historicism, turns out to be historically more reliable than the prod ucts of historical archeology" (RR 123). This sentence takes some un packing. "Historicism" and "historical archeology" refer most directly to the work of Donald Reiman as the editor and orthodox interpreter of "The Triumph of Life." While the immediate antecedent for "read ing as disfiguration" is Shelley's interpretation of Rousseau (from de Man's previous sentence, where he says that "the way in which Rousseau is read and disfigured in 'The Triumph of Life' puts Shelley among the few readers who 'guessed whose statue those fragments had composed'"), de Man too takes up the antihistoricist position of the disfiguring reader as his deconstructive reading of Shelley op poses Reiman's interpretation. To claim that this approach to Shelley is "more reliable" than Reiman's, or that any reading can be "more reliable" than any other, obviously cuts against the essay's previous denial of the possibility of relation. Although de Man claims to see clearly that Reiman's optimistic reading of "The Triumph of Life" is a misreading that disfigures Shelley's poem, "Shelley Disfigured" ques tions its own reliability through the evolution of the term "error" in "The Rhetoric of Temporality" to "madness" in "Shelley Disfigured." This questioning can only take place, however, after the reasons for the assertions on behalf of "Shelley Disfigured" are fully realized. The power of this claim for the superiority of "reading as disfiguration" over historicism is based upon the role of death in "Shelley Disfig ured." The elaboration of this claim may well be the most lurid of what Neil Hertz calls de Man's "lurid figures."8 De Man cites only one passage from Reiman in "Shelley Disfig ured," but he gives it a paradigmatic status as the most "straight forward statement" of the critical tradition on "The Triumph of Life," a tradition that places Shelley's poem within a "genetic and historical metaphor" that invests romanticism with a "negative but exemplary knowledge" (RR 96). Reiman's reading of Shelley sets out not only to identify that knowledge but to assert its utility, and Reiman accom plishes this, in the passage cited by de Man, by constructing a figure of Shelley that can be instructive for us: "Shelley's generation, repre senting the full mastery of the new age that dawned in the French Revolution, can learn from the mistakes of that age's earlier genera tions (those of Rousseau and Voltaire and Wordsworth)."9 As de Man glosses Reiman's reading, "Rousseau lacked power"—the power to avoid mistakes—"but because he can consciously articulate the</page><page sequence="8">8 James O'Rourke causes of his weakness in words, the energy is preserved and re covered in the following generation" (RR 96). As Reiman reads "The Triumph of Life," the figure of Rousseau sees his own mistake to have been a too radical investment in idealism, followed by an exces sive despair when reality did not live up to his expectations. Shelley, on the other hand, supposedly learned from Rousseau's errors and, according to Reiman, "saw the need for a golden mean of accommo dation between the individual's ideals and the recalcitrant facts of ex perience."10 Both Reiman's PMLA essay on "The Triumph" and his in terpretive essay, "A Reading Of 'The Triumph of Life,'" in his edition of the poem conclude with descriptions of Shelley living at Casa Magni with the Williamses, in a state of "peace and tranquility"11 that has followed upon his renunciation of excessive idealism. When de Man insists that the "final test of reading, in 'The Triumph of Life,' depends ... on how one disposes of Shelley's body" (RR 121) and then asserts the greater reliability of his own "reading as disfigura tion" to Reiman's "historicism" (RR 123), he suggests that Reiman has failed this test. Reiman's central interpretive error has been to imag ine that a distinction can be drawn between the hopelessness of Rousseau's position and the redemptive function that knowledge can play for Shelley because, if the time of the writing of "The Triumph of Life" is construed as the present, Rousseau is dead and Shelley is alive. Having made this distinction, Reiman can then identify himself with the values—"maturity" and "sanity"12—that have the power to bring Shelley to a state of "peace and tranquility." As de Man's "final test" points out, there is one thing wrong with this picture. Shelley is not alive. The critical convention through which we identify the voice in every text as speaking in the present, the convention by which we say "Shelley says," rather than "Shelley said," leads historicizing crit ics to believe that a poet's voice speaks an immutable presence, but de Man identifies Shelley with Rousseau, and himself with Shelley, as those who have truly understood the demystifying power of death. The figure of the dead de Man in the margins of "Shelley Disfigured" is not simply a lurid figure for its own sake, but is part of de Man's interpretation of the poem, and it lies at the heart of his claim for the greater reliability of his reading. The figure of the dead critic identi fies poet and critic in their tragic knowledge, and gives a very differ ent cast to the figure who speaks "as it were, from beyond the grave." Anyone who finds a reassuring image of an immortal linguistic self in such a figure cannot be identified with the ghostly figures of Rous seau, Shelley and de Man.</page><page sequence="9">"Shelley Disfigured" 9 Shelley was, in de Man's terms, a thoroughgoing Romantic when he wrote "The Triumph of Life," and the implicit narrative strategy of "Shelley Disfigured" is to make de Man, and not Reiman, the one who "establishes] a relation to Shelley and to romanticism in general" (RR 95). The only definition de Man ever gave of romanti cism was in "The Intentional Structure of the Romantic Image," where he wrote that "the affinity of later poets with Rousseau . . . can well be considered to be a valid definition of romanticism as a whole" (RR 10). There is no time limit set on how much "later" these poets can write and still be romantics, and de Man went on to write about "romanticism" even as he challenged it as a period definition. Thus, he could write interchangeably of nineteenth- and twentieth-century poets in "Lyric and Modernity," saying that The less we understand a poet, the more he is compulsively misinterpreted and oversimplified and made to say the oppo site of what he actually said, the better the chances are that he is truly modern; that is, different from what we—mistak enly—think we are ourselves. This would make Baudelaire into a truly modern French poet, Holderlin into a truly mod ern German poet, and Wordsworth and Yeats into truly mod ern English poets. (BI 186) Creating "romantic" poets who are different from what we believe ourselves to be is the historical method that, as de Man puts it, allows 'Reiman to "complete" a romanticism which exists as "a fragment, or a moment, in a process that now includes us within its horizon" (RR 94). Reiman circumscribes romantici^n within a definable set of be liefs which then become available, in their entirety, for the scrutiny of the modern critical consciousness. For de Man, the belief that roman ticism can be subsumed within our critical wisdom is the central his toricist fallacy, and the teleological metaphor which demands a name for the period that follows the modernism of the early part of the twentieth century collapses into parody; the "notion of postmodernity becomes a parody of the notion of modernity," a fallacy generated by a "naive" model "where history is seen as a succession" (RT 120). De Man sees all "modern" poets, whatever their era, recreating romanti cism all over again, and differing from the non-poetic "we" or "ourselves" in their clear-sightedness; they are not subject to the ordi nary mistakes in our own self-images. Although Rousseau is not on the list in "Lyric and Modernity," de Man's according of such status to Rousseau was the basis of his well known controversy with Der rida over Rousseau's "Essay on the Origin of Languages."</page><page sequence="10">10 James O'Rourke If "an affinity with Rousseau" is the only definition of romanticism, and if clarity of vision, particularly about oneself, is the criteria of modernism, then de Man can be said to aspire to both romanticism and modernism. De Man's model of history does not privilege the critic who would complete the fragmentary knowledge of the roman tic poet, but it does imply the genetic continuity of a specifically liter ary history based on a special form of consciousness that can arise in any period in those writers who earn the name of poet, whether or not their writings are in verse. This is, of course, precisely the status that Shelley confers on Rousseau in the "Defence" when he distin guishes Rousseau from the other philosophers praised by Peacock: "Rousseau was essentially a poet. The others [Locke, Hume, Gibbon, Voltaire], even Voltaire, were mere reasoners."13 Since de Man's own affinity with Rousseau takes place (it it does) in "Shelley Disfigured" by way of Shelley, it would be worthwhile to point out just how fun damentally de Man's collapsing of the categories of the romantic and the modern depends on a specifically Shelleyan poetics. In "Literary History and Literary Modernity," de Man defined "the radical impulse that stands behind all genuine modernity" thus: Fashion can sometimes be only what remains of modernity after the impulse has subsided, as soon—and this can be al most at once—as it has changed from being an incandescent point in time into a reproducible cliche, all that remains of an invention that has lost the desire that produced it. Fashion is like the ashes left behind by the uniquely shaped flames of the fire, the trace alone revealing that a fire actually took place. (BI 147) In tenor and vehicle, this a paraphrase of Shelley's image of the fad ing coal with its "transitory brightness" and the consequent entropy of figurative language. As Shelley realized in the course of writing "A Defence of Poetry," such an evanescent power is not capable of sus taining a teleological narrative of continual progress. The best it can do is to suggest the repetitive flaring of poetic consciousness. The traditional critical method for sustaining a narrative of progress is prosopopoeia, which overlooks dead bodies in order to commit what Derrida, in looking for the words to mourn de Man, calls "the most deadly infidelity . . . which would interiorize within us the im age, idol, or ideal of the other who is dead and only lives in us," so that one might "delude onself into believing that the other living in us is living in himself."14 The same point is made even more emphati</page><page sequence="11">"Shelley Disfigured" 11 cally by de Man in his denunciation that "what we have done with the dead Shelley, and with all of the other dead bodies in romantic literature ... is simply to bury them, to bury them in their own texts made into epitaphs and monumental graves" (121). De Man forsakes this traditional prosopopoeia when he identifies himself not with an image of the speaking Shelley but with the body of the dead Shelley. This is a complete reversal of his treatment of the "theme of poetic impersonality" expressed in "Lyric and Modernity," where de Man espoused the belief in "authentic poetic immortality that is entirely devoid of any personal circumstances" (BI 180). That belief was grounded on de Man's willingness to use the standard prosopopoeia; the text under discussion is Mallarme's "Tombeau de Verlaine," where de Man finds in Mallarme the "self-conscious" discovery of "the discontinuity between the personal self and the voice that speaks in the poetry from the other bank of the river, beyond death" (BI 181). In de Man's last letter to Derrida (quoted in Memoires), de Man returns to this text to say, "I always knew it, but it proves to be so: Death repays, as they say, closer acquaintance—'this shallow calum niated stream called death.'" As Derrida points out, this is the final line of "Tombeau de Verlaine."15 The syntactic twist in de Man's sentence ("I always knew it, but it proves to be so") distributes truth onto both sides of the conjunction ("but") that should separate truth and error. The twist in the sentence allows the second clause simultaneously to reinforce and to under mine the truth of the first, and raises the question of what is true and what is open to correction in the initial understanding of death in the essays of 1969. Both in the essays of 1969 ("Lyric and Modernity" and "The Rhetoric of Temporality") and in "Shelley Disfigured," death performs a demystifying function. In the earlier essays, the poet is said to achieve "a conception of the self seen in its authenti cally temporal destiny" and to overcome the "tenacious self-mystifi cation" of "a defensive strategy that tries to hide from this negative knowledge" (BI 208); as we saw, Wordsworth is said to accomplish this passage from error to wisdom precisely through the "de-mystify ing power of death" (BI 224). In "Shelley Disfigured," de Man's recog nition of his own death allows him to identify himself with the dead Shelley, and to poduce a criticism which is "historically more reliable" than the historicism of Reiman. But death teaches an entirely differ ent lesson in "Shelley Disfigured" than what de Man understood it to teach in the essays of 1969; there is no longer the sublation of the empirical into the linguistic self, but the resistant materiality of "Shelley's body."</page><page sequence="12">12 James O'Rourke The difference between these two effects of the demystifying power of death shifts the rhetoric of authority into a wilder register in "Shelley Disfigured"; the evolution of error into madness, and the consequent inability clearly to distinguish truth from error, is the pri mary difference between "Shelley Disfigured" and "The Rhetoric of Temporality." Where Wordsworth is said to pass from error to wis dom in the earlier essay, the figure who recognizes the inescapability of death in "Shelley Disfigured" is delivered only into madness, "the madness of words." "Shelley Disfigured" is relentless in its self-ques tioning; if de Man had written before as though he "always knew" the demystifying lesson of death, and yet, from this later perspective, he discovers that he knew the opposite of what he knows now, how reliable is what he knows in "Shelley Disfigured"? The identification with Rousseau and Shelley through death on the part of one who is dying—is this all a projection, a pathetic embodiment of the parody of the literary critic in Pale Fire, one who can see in any poem only an allegory of his own obsession? Is it, in short, a product of aesthetic ideology, where a personal intuition has elevated itself to the level of a universal cognition? De Man blocked that question in 1969 with the term "rhetoric"; he proposed to distinguish his own criticism from work in which there is an "association of rhetorical terms with value judgments that blur distinctions and hide the real structures" (B1 188). From the perspective of "Shelley Disfigured," the very askesis that divides the personal from the authentically discursive, both literary and critical, is seen, as the central delusion of "Lyric and Modernity" and "The Rhetoric of Temporality." The purity of disembodied "rhet oric" was simply a conventional repression of the fact of materiality. The challenge posed by "Shelley Disfigured" is whether any writ ing escapes the trap of aeshtetic ideology, the seductive mutual rein forcement of the learned and the conceptual with the natural and the intuitive. De Man's close reading of Shelley, in which the traditional academic rules of evidence are followed with a rigor that far exceeds usual standards, produces a reading that conforms to the overwhelm ingly central event of de Man's own life. The pursuit of a discourse, called disfigurement, which is said to be "historically more reliable" than conventional historicism does not strive for impersonality, but it does aspire to a mourning of Shelley that would be utterly unlike a traditional historicizing of Shelley. De Man's insistence that "The Triumph of Life" is neither a quest nor an elegy but "something quite different for which we have no name readily available among the familiar props of literary history" can serve as an entry into de Man's own definition of "true mourning":</page><page sequence="13">"Shelley Disfigured" 13 Generic terms such as "lyric" (or its various subspecies, "ode," "idyll," or "elegy") as well as pseudo-historical period terms such as "romanticism" or "classicism" are always terms of re sistance or nostalgia, at the furthest remove from the materi ality of actual history. If mourning is called a "chambre d'eternal deuil ou vibrent de vieux rales," then this pathos of terror states in fact the desired consciousness of eternity and of temporal harmony as voice and as song. True "mourning" is less deluded. The most it can do is to allow for non comprehension and enumerate non-anthropomorphic, non elegaic, non-celebratory, non-lyrical, non-poetic, that is to say, prosaic, or, better, historical modes of language power. (RR 262, de Man's emphases) The "non-anthropomorphic" does not necessarily preclude an affinity between one writer and another, the sort of affinity that allows Shel ley to continue a Rousseauean romanticism. De Man can claim such an affinity with Shelley even in the passage that insists most strongly on the impossibility of relation; where de Man tells us that "noth ing, whether deed, word, thought or text, ever happens in relation, positive or negative, to anything that precedes, follows or exists elsewhere," and that this randomness can only be disfigured by "figuration and cognition," Shelley could warn us, in his "Essay on Christianity," that "Where indefiniteness ends idolatry and anthropo morphism begin."16 As de Man's work is so often directed towards the evasions and defenses that are constructed to avoid "indefinite ness," it is no wonder that he would find Shelley's work "exemplary precisely because it refuses to be generalized into a system" (RR 123). Although the discovery of corollaries between de Man and Shelley can easily be adduced, neither de Man nor Shelley make it easy for readers to trust their discoveries of such affinities. If de Man could be sure that he had reliably read Shelley's poem in Shelley's own terms, he would not need to describe its "use, as in this essay, for the asser tion of methodological claims made all the more pious by their denial of piety." And I have to admit an uneasiness with the fact that my own reading of de Man, although I have tried to follow the usual aca demic rules of evidence, hinges on a figure that is both speculative and unacademically lurid, de Man's foreshadowing of his own death in "Shelley Disfigured" in a deliberate analogy to the body of Shelley in "The Triumph of Life." But, as de Man suggests, "The Triumph of Life" does not lend itself to ordinary reading. The trajectory from er ror to wisdom by way of the properly impersonal use of rhetoric, as</page><page sequence="14">14 James O'Rourke advocated in "The Rhetoric of Temporality," gives way in "Shelley Disfigured" to a passage into the "madness of words," where all read ing is disfiguration. A reading that produces madness rather than truth is not a matter of early and late de Man, but is the effect of con fronting Rousseau. An earlier letter from de Man to Derrida, written in 1971 and quoted in Memoires, addresses their differences over Rousseau and shows the progression in which rhetoric (also called "literariness," an equation to which de Man returned in "Semiology and Rhetoric"), is capable of overcoming the ordinary blindness of er ror but leads only into madness: I did not wish to exempt Rousseau from blindness but only wished to show that, on the specific question of the rhetoric - ity of his writing, he was not blinded. This is what gives to his text the particular status that we would both agree, I be lieve, to call "literary." That this insight is accompanied by a perhaps more redoubtable blindness—and which could be, for example, madness—I didn't feel obligated to say about this latter text, but I would say it in regard to the Dialogues and especially in regard to Emile, which seems to me one of the most demented texts there is.17 Derrida cites this letter in order to connect three of de Man's central figures—Rousseau, Nietzsche and Holderlin—as "the three madmen of Western modernity." While de Man consistently describes Words worth at the level of clarity of vision, Shelley's ability to forgo "idolatry and anthropomorphism" connects him to Rousseau and leads him into this "more redoubtable blindness." There is no final triumph over error in "The Triumph of Life"; having seen the errors of idolatry and anthropomorphism, Shelley's return to indefiniteness does not distinguish between wisdom and madness. If "true mourning" would engage the "materiality of actual history," the difficulty of engaging that materiality in language drives de Man into a highly allusive and oblique style in "Shelley Disfigured." The lurid figure of the drowned Shelley marks an important shift in de Man's iconoclastic attack, begun in "The Intentional Structure of the Romantic Image," on the notion of romantic poetry as nature poetry. In "The Intentional Structure of the Romantic Image," the image for leaving the ground was an image of "levitation." The language of the romantic poets, de Man contends there, "has itself become a celestial entity, an inhabitant of the sky" (RR 15). In "Shelley Disfigured," the image for leaving the earth is not a visionary levitation but a drown</page><page sequence="15">"Shelley Disfigured" 15 ing that takes the linguistic self with the empirical. Instead of liberat ing the former, it engulfs both. The theme of monumentalization res onates in "Shelley Disfigured" in the essay's citations, in an opening epigraph and in its antepenultimate sentence, to the Hardy story "Barbara of the House of Grebes," where a statue meets a particularly interesting fate. First de Man's sentence; then the plot of "Barbara of the House of Grebes." "If it is true and unavoidable that any reading is a monumentalization of sorts, the way in which Rousseau is read and disfigured in "The Triumph of Life" puts Shelley among the few readers who 'guessed whose statue those fragments had composed'" (RR 122-23; the quote is from Hardy). In Hardy's story, a wealthy young woman elopes with an extremely handsome man of no prop erty. Her parents oppose the match, and a compromise is reached; he is to travel on the Continent for a year with a tutor, and upon his re turn her parents will accept the marriage and reinstate her as their heir. Unfortunately, he is severely disfigured in a fire while traveling, and, after a brief visit home and appropriate plot complications, he returns alone to the Continent and dies soon afterwards. Barbara then remarries an older man of her own rank. One day a messenger comes to tell her that her first husband had had a sculpture done of himself before his accident, and the sculptor would like to get something for his work; would she like to buy the sculpture? She not only buys it, she has a shrine built around it in a closet in her room. When her second husband connects her increasing disaffection for him with the arrival of the statue, he spies on her, sees her clinging to the statue when alone in her room, and, as you have no doubt guessed by now, mutilates the statue. The epigraph for "Shelley Disfigured" that de Man takes from Hardy's story comes from long after the action described above: while digging in the grounds for the new foundations, the broken fragments of a marble statue were unearthed. They were submitted to various antiquaries, who said that, so far as the damaged pieces would allow them to form an opinion, the statue seemed to be that of a mutilated Roman satyr; or, if not, an allegorical figure of Death. Only one or two old in habitants guessed whose statue those fragments had com posed. (RR 93) The relations between poet, reader and critic (Rousseau to Shelley to de Man) are compounded of several gestures; one makes an icon of one's predecessor, one disfigures that icon (''as in this essay"), and, if</page><page sequence="16">16 James O'Rourke one is sufficiently clear-sighted, one recognizes that the best one can hope for is to take one's place in what Shelley describes as the pro cession of life. As Rousseau says to Shelley in "The Triumph of Life," follow thou, and from spectator turn Actor or victim in this wretchedness, And what thou wouldst be taught I then may learn From thee. (305-08) While the "various antiquaries" efface the violence of material history through "the historicization and the aesthetification of texts," de Man proposes that the disfigured image of Rousseau in "The Triumph of Life" shows us that all discourse is warfare, and that the compulsive critical misunderstanding and oversimplification of a figure like Rous seau is the mutilating gesture of the second husband in "Barbara of the House of Grebes." To read Rousseau, it is necessary to reduce him to one's own scale; otherwise, one would be driven mad by his persuasive incoherencies. To reintroduce the importance of death in this equation, either one collaborates with death's mutilation of Rous seau through the assumption of a critical wisdom safely and sanely removed from Rousseau's errors, or one sees oneself "turn actor or victim in this wretchedness." De Man's rhetorical self-consciousness seems sometimes to situate his own discourse at the hinge, the Derridean brisure, from which this "or" is produced. There is a thread in de Man's work that encourages this move to avoid the personal pathos of "Shelley Disfigured" by speaking of "formal materialism"18 so that it might be possible to pro duce one's discourse at the level where the linguistic machine—of which it is said at one point in "Shelley Disfigured" that "we are its product rather than its agent" (RR 122)—is actually performing its differentiation and production. The most sweeping claims for this machinery occur near the end of de Man's treatment of Rousseau in Allegories of Reading, where De Man proposes that "Far from seeing language as an instrument in the service of a psychic energy, the pos sibility now arises that the entire construction of drives, substitutions, repressions, and representations is the aberrant, metaphorical correla tive of the absolute randomness of language, prior to any figuration or meaning" (AR 299). Some of de Man's last essays seem to speak from this non-anthropomorphic level before language appears as fig uration or meaning; "Anthropomorphism and Trope in Lyric," "Aes thetic Formalization in Kleist," "Excuses (Confessions)" and "Phenom enality and Materiality in Kant" would fall into this category.</page><page sequence="17">"Shelley Disfigured" 17 Taking these essays as an alternative culmination to de Man's writ ing career seems to promise not only a hermeneutic but an ethical profit; at the prephenomenal level of linguistic materialism, discourse does not fall into the "obfuscation or ideology" of the aesthetic (PMK 144) nor does it claim the pseudoethical, sadistic authority of the pro fessors of "aesthetic education" (RR 270-79). Thus Marc Redfield's account of " 'the reality of history' as material" in de Man is that The materiality—the (potential) randomness or singularity— of every meaning-event is what the aesthetic seeks to efface. . . . Such naturalization can occur only as a violent, obsessive gesture; and, while an initial naturalizing aberrancy ... is built into language, as the principle of language's (impos sibility, the systematic valorization of the aesthetic, de Man suggests, is potentially totalitarian in its implications.19 While this is an accurate paraphrase of the main arguments of de Man's essays on Kant and Kleist, Redfield's argument pursues differ ent consequences of randomness than does "Shelley Disfigured." Much of Redfield's review essay is devoted to chiding Christopher Norris for lapsing into "aesthetic consolations" even as Norris de scribes de Man's critique of aesthetic ideology. Redfield rightly ad duces "Phenomenality and Materiality in Kant" as the essay that con structs an uncompromising polarity between the material and the aesthetic in order to confer absolute priority on the material and to show "the undoing of the aesthetic as a valid category" (PMK 143). "Phenomenality and Materiality in Kant" ends with the assertion that "The bottom line, in Kant as well as in Hegel, is the prosaic material ity of the letter and no degree of obfuscation or ideology can trans form this materiality into the phenomenal cognition of aesthetic judgment" (PMK 144). But this ability to distinguish clearly between truth and error is the same distinction that was made in "The Rheto ric of Temporality," and it is purchased in "Phenomenality and Mate riality in Kant" in the same manner: through the creation of an im personality that is hierarchized above and then severed from the empirical. To summarize de Man's argument very quickly, he warns at the outset of the essay that "Ideological and critical thought are interde pendent and any attempt to separate them collapses ideology into mere error and critical thought into idealism" (PMK 122). He then follows Kant, however, in giving priority to purely critical, or tran scendental, principles ("It is the transcendental system . . . that deter</page><page sequence="18">18 James O'Rourke mines the ideology and not the reverse" [PMK 123]) over the empiri cal (identified with the ideological and the aesthetic). The essay will end with the constitution and subversion of the transcendental by "the prosaic materiality of the letter" (PMK 144), but this occurs only after the transcendental has been given power over the aeshtetic and the empirical. De Man reproduces Kant's argument on this point in a dispassionate description of its "quasi-theological necessity" in "our fallen condition": "The need for aesthetic judgment and activity, al though it defines man, is the expression of a shortcoming. . . . There would be no need for it 'if we were creatures of pure intellect or even capable of displacing ourselves mentally in such a condition'" (PMK 137; the quote is from Kant). Although de Man quotes Kant on this point without comment, a de Manian reader will inevitably find more irony in the idea of becoming a "creature of pure intellect" than Kant intends. The resistance to materiality here is pure wistfulness, but, as de Man reads the Critique of Judgment, it is not a text written by one angel to another. In de Man's reading, it is the "prosaic materiality of the letter" that gives Kant's notion of the transcendental its persua sive power, in an economy of discursive imposition; it is, de Man contends, the phonetic proximity of Verwunderung and Bewunderung that carries one crucial passage in the Critique, and "a constant, and finally bewildering alternation" of "Angemessen(heit) and Unangemes sen(heit), to the point where one can no longer tell them apart" that establishes another point. In each case, de Man asks rhetorically, "are we not made to assent," not by the force of logical argument but by "the play of the letter and of the syllable" (PMK 144). In de Man's reading, Kant claims not agreement but surrender. As de Man makes clear, totalitarian implications reside just as much at the material as at the aesthetic level of language. De Man does not, however, always grant a totalizing power even to the mate riality of the letter, despite its considerable critical force. The beliefs that one can, through rhetorical askesis, describe "things as they ac tually are" (BI 224), and that this is not in itself a violent, obsessive, totalitarian act are highly productive for criticism, and especially for the impersonal generalizing characteristic of theoretical discourse. De Man comments in "Phenomenality and Materiality in Kant" on the "gain in critical freedom that characterizes rational and transcendental principles" (140) compared to the discourse that can be produced at the level of the empirical and natural. This "gain in critical freedom" is characterized in "Semiology and Rhetoric," an essay that is closer to "Shelley Disfigured" than it is to "Phenomenality and Materiality</page><page sequence="19">"Shelley Disfigured" 19 in Kant," as a "mood of negative assurance that is highly productive of critical discourse"; in this "grammatization of rhetoric," an inter preter who pursues the necessarily systematic grounds of comprehen sibility of a text "seems to reach a truth, albeit by the negative road of exposing an error, a false pretense" (AR 16). The ground of interpre tive certainty is not, however, grammar itself but the entirely per sonal "mood" in which the critical writer is able to identify himself with the categorical necessities of language as an impersonal ma chine. "Semiology and Rhetoric" offers another mode of reading, one which equates rhetoric with literariness, rhetorizes grammar and ends in "suspended uncertainty" (16) or "suspended ignorance" (19). This radically formalist mode of reading does not, however, prepare the ground for "technically correct rhetorical readings." It cuts in precisely the opposite direction, and subverts the positivistic strain that persists even in de Man's later essays. Though de Manian deconstruction of ten acquires its force by exposing the machinery by which "inscribing the particular in the general ... is the purpose of any cognition" (RR 276), this does not describe any level of intention of "The Triumph of Life" in "Shelley Disfigured." While de Man sees the process of sys tematic inscription problematized by "literary texts" (RR 276) in "Aesthetic Formalization in Kleist," in the last sentence of "Shelley Disfigured" de Man goes all the way and uses the name of "Shelley" to describe the force that resists systematization ("the rigor exhibited by Shelley ... is exemplary precisely because it refuses to be general ized into a system.") The conclusion of "Semiology and Rhetoric" joins an anthropomorphic vehicle of agency to the rhetorical structure of "suspended ignorance" in a closing sentence that does not sub scribe to the categorical assertion that there is any such thing in his tory as a "bottom line": "Literature as well as criticism—the difference between them being delusive—is condemned (or privileged) to be forever the most rigorous and, consequently, the most unreliable lan guage in terms of which man names and transforms himself" (AR 19). The potential chiasmic reversals, as the most rigorous becomes the most unreliable in a linguistic system in which "difference" is the only principle of meaning, make the clear separation of truth and er ror impossible. And the anthropomorphic vehicle "man" becomes the agent, and not the "product" (as the methodology of "Shelley Disfig ured" insists) of discourse. The "fragmentation" de Man speaks of in "Shelley Disfigured" in volves the incompatible presence of systematic and anthropomorphic interpretive conclusions. The assertion that "we are [the] product</page><page sequence="20">20 James O'Rourke rather than [the] agent" of language is a cliche of poststructuralist crit ical discourse that is flatly contradicted by de Man's description of "Shelley" as a privileged agent of discourse, capable of transcending a systematic grammatization. The most famous assertion that "man" is the product rather than the agent of discourse is Foucault's conclu sion to The Order of Things, where Foucault imagines the passing of this construct ("man would be erased, like a face drawn in sand at the edge of the sea.").20 De Man's description in "Semiology and Rhetoric" of "man" naming and transforming himself in a response to the one-sidedness of Foucault's account, but "Shelley Disfigured" be comes a far less serene essay as language becomes "the madness of words" and the opposition between human agency and the forces that constitute and threaten it are internalized within the essay. "Shelley Disfigured" swings from the impersonal Foucauldian mo ment ("we are its product") to a denunciation of its own betrayal of Shelley's text ("as in this essay") to support this cliche. Shelley's text is then confronted with even more redoubtable forces than methods and systems. The randomness that is "like the power of death" does not produce a meta-transcendental "bottom line" but a surfeit of ma teriality, an identifiable dead man. If de Man's assertion that "Death is a displaced name for a linguistic predicament" (RR 81) is itself a substitutive structure, there is no reason why these terms cannot be reversed. Death can be tenor as easily as vehicle, and it shifts into the prefigurative mode of the tenor in "Shelley Disfigured" as de Man in sists that the "defaced body" of Shelley creates the fragmented struc ture of "rhythmical interruptions" in "The Triumph of Life" (RR 120 21). Death and madness become more than figures of speech in "Shelley Disfigured" as they forge the anthropomorphic links be tween the disfigured and disfiguring poet and critic. The contradic tions in de Man's essays describe affinities with different moods and different traditions: "Phenomenality and Materiality in Kant" with the pursuit of a "bottom line," "Semiology and Rhetoric" with the free dom of the undetermined human being amidst an army of seduc tively empowering metaphors, and "Shelley Disfigured" with the vic tim of circumstances; in anthropomorphic terms, the first to Kant, the second to Nietzsche, the last to Rousseau. In the confrontation with Rousseau and romanticism, de Man pro duced a body of work that stands, in his own word, in a highly "ambivalent" relation (BI 111) to his more systematic essays. De Man's defense of Rousseau's anthropology as deliberately fictional and pseudo-historical suggests that we should take the Essay on the</page><page sequence="21">"Shelley Disfigured" 21 Origin of Languages to describe not a moment in history but the man ner in which language repeatedly originates as a "free presence to the mind" (RR 6). The existence of a language which has "no literal referent" (BI 135) cannot be brought within the terms of a project that can substitute for Being another "bottom line." The possibility of ori gination in a manner that evades the constraints of the Idea and of Being was de Man's central concern in "The Intentional Structure of the Romantic Image" (RR 4-5), an essay that defined origination as difference, and imagined a benign opposition between poetic con sciousness and the natural world, so that "imagination" could exist "independently of all relationship with the outside world, without being moved by an intent aimed at part of that world" (RR 16-17). The hopeful ending of "The Intentional Structure of the Romantic Image" describes a collective poetic subject tracing a progress away from nature and from primitivist and pantheist delusions; the roman tic poets are said to have been "underway towards . . . insights" in that direction, while "the poetry of today" is given the task of advanc ing Wordsworth's image of thought as its "own perfection and re ward." The collective and teleological metaphors of "The Intentional Structure" are replaced in "Shelley Disfigured" with an apocalyptic story about individuals, as the latter essay defines the material world not as nature but as death, and discovers more than an intellectual investment in keeping consciousness apart from the "identities of physics" (BI 128). If the alternative to "humanizing de Man," as Red field puts it, is to center his work on his engagement with Kant, the antithetical error would be to systematize de Man by privileging his most totalizing themes. De Man's critique in "The Rhetoric of Temporality" of a mystified romanticism based on a Coleridgean poetics of the symbol was that, by anthropomorphizing nature, it col lapsed into an idealism that described the relation between con sciousness and nature as an "intersubjective, interpersonal relation ship" (BI 196) and not as a confrontation of oppositional terms. Col lapsing the subjective pole of this opposition into a site of disinterested, comprehensive mastery capable of defining a "bottom line" has been the dream of philosophy ever since Plato. De Man's engagement with romanticism, as it culminates in "Shelley Disfig ured," attacks that fallacy just as emphatically as it initially chal lenged the anthropomorphization of the object. Although "Phenomenality and Materiality in Kant" begins with a warning that separating "critical thought" from ideology means a col lapse into idealism, that essay goes ahead to run that risk, unless one</page><page sequence="22">22 James O'Rourke is willing to read the essay's image of the "disarticulation ... of the body" (PMK 143) as something more than "formal materialism." Readings of de Man that follow that essay's Kantian assertion of the priority of critical thought as the true engagement with the material ity of history run the risk of doing to de Man what a traditional mon umentalizing does to Shelley, of overlooking his aberrancies and his death in order to take over his knowledge as pure power. "Shelley Disfigured" identifies the threat of randomness when it asserts that "nothing, whether deed, word, thought or text, ever happens in rela tion, positive or negative, to anything that precedes, follows or exists elsewhere," but it goes on to offer a reading of Shelley that aspires to the rigor of literature and so exposes itself to the truly material dan gers of madness and proximity to death. De Man's readers should heed his reflection that "Shelley Disfigured" is the "only place where [he] come[s] close to facing some of these questions about history and fragmentation" (RR ix). Following de Man's assertion that "'The Triumph of Life' can be said to reduce all of Shelley's previous work to nought," one has to face the possibility that "Shelley Disfigured" could have the same effect on the de Manian canon. True mourning would have to confront the body, and not just the spirit, or linguistic self, of de Man, just as de Man confronted Shelley's dead body and the "repeated frustration [of] a persistent attempt to write as if a dia lectical summation were possible beyond the breaks and interrup tions that the readings disclose," a frustration which could only be addressed by a delusive "discursive elegance" or "the burden of con stantly falling back to nought" (RR ix). De Man's persistently negative dialectic confronted theories of parole, such as Rousseau's s'entendre parler, with langue, the assertion that "drives, substitutions, repres sions, and representations" are "the aberrant, metaphorical correlative of the absolute randomness of language" (AR 299), and theorists of the omnideterminism of langue, such as Jakobson or Saussure, with the literary resistance of a Rousseau or a Shelley who were able to name and transform themselves. "Any speech act produces an excess of cognition, but it can never hope to know the process of its own production" (AR 300); "Rousseau's text has no blind spots; it accounts at all moments for its own rhetorical mode" (B1 139). This dialectic finds its end not in the discovery of an identity that contains this dif ference but in a random, meaningless interruption. The only principle that contains these poles of de Man's work is what he called, in writing of the compulsive misreading of Rousseau, "ambivalence." The one consistency de Man identifies in the critical</page><page sequence="23">"Shelley Disfigured" 23 misreadings that overcome the fundamental "ambivalence" of Rous seau's writing is their capacity for "blotting out the disturbing parts of the work"; the methods for doing so, however, range from making Rousseau coherent by constructing a "convergence . . . towards a def inite configuration of meanings" to exposing Rousseau's mistakes by "reducing [his ambivalencies] to contradictions" (BI 111-12). In either case, what is identified as Rousseau's knowledge can be taken over by his reader, but this occurs, de Man insists, only through the muti lation of Rousseau's own texts. The most productive way of reading de Man is undoubtedly to learn from the rigor of his more systematic essays some means of seeing through the most common and persua sive errors in our literary and cultural heritage. This is a project that de Man consistently endorsed from at least the opening of Allegories of Reading, where he commended the "highly respectable moral imperative" of the beginnings of New Historicism (AR 3), to his ex pressed admiration for Bakhtin's attempt to move from poetics to "the power of a hermeneutics" (RT 113), to his assertion in "The Resis tance to Theory" that "the linguistics of literariness is a powerful and indispensable tool in the unmasking of ideological aberrations" (RT 11). But the very consideration of political questions constructs a po sition for the self, from which one attempts to operate as "pure intellect" and find an objective truth about human beings considered as a collectivity, and that is never the position of the subject in de Man's writings on Romanticism. In the early writings, Wordsworth's solitary trips to mountaintops are described as exemplary, even if the lessons with which Wordsworth returns ("thoughts / That are their own perfection and reward," Prelude VI, 546-47, cited in "Intentional Structure," RR 16, or "the sky was not a sky of earth," Prelude I, 339, cited in "Time and History in Wordsworth," 7) are ambivalent at best. As Shelley displaces Wordsworth as the exemplary figure of British Romanticism in "Shelley Disfigured," de Man chooses a poem in which Shelley begins in a Wordsworthian position, alone on a hill side at sunrise, but then Shelley's relation to the landscape evolves. As the procession of "life" forms in his imagination, he finds himself at first in the "political" position of meditating on the fate of the mass of humanity; in the poem's next stage, he identifies a single figure in that mass in the tree root that becomes Rousseau. As de Man's medi tation on the drowned Shelley recapitulates Shelley's encounter with the disfigured Rousseau, de Man offers his own lurid figure as a truth that neither contradicts, explains, nor is explained by the rigors of rhetoric. To the reader who would become the Shelley to his Rous</page><page sequence="24">24 James O'Rourke seau, de Man offers the unmasking of the transformations by which the material self is aestheticized or historicized into a monument or a part of a larger whole. This unmasking is a knowledge without power, a truly demonic bargain that is described in different contexts in de Man's work as literature, authenticity or madness. Language is then the salutary error that differs and defers, differentiating and dis tancing itself from this morbidity.21 Florida State University 1.
