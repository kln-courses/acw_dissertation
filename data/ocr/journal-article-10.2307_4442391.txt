<plain_text><page sequence="1">PREHISTORIC MAN, John Bailey, 96 pp., $4.95, Hawthorne Books, Inc., New York, 1968. The purpose of this volume for chil- dren is to present some information about man's origin and to support the author's hypotheses about this. In so doing he points out the limitations of our knowledge, he illustrates how sci- entists draw hypotheses from limited evidence, how experts may disagree, and how further knowledge is obtained. These are strong positive features of the presentation. Unfortunately, the book's negative features outweigh these, and so the book is not recommended. Given the simplicity of much of the approach, some of the language is need- lessly complex; e.g., "Teeth are special modifications of bony structure found in the external skin of some of the lower vertebrates" (p. 9). Illustrations are not adequately used for the purpose of clarifying text; e.g., the description of the development of teeth (pp. 9-10) would have been simplified by illustra- tions of teeth rather than of skulls. There are inaccurate overstatements; e.g., "Cro-Magnon man was like us in all details" (p. 58). There are obscure references; e.g., he mentions the moa (p. 10), with no explanation of what a moa is. There are anthropomorphic statements; e.g., "The Dryopithecines . . .were beside themselves with rage and horror" (p. 18). There are mis- leading statements; e.g., "Were the two populations fertile?" when he means "Were the two populations interfertile?" And "We cannot reconstruct the precise savagery of that ancient world. There is considerable evidence that it is beyond our imaginations." (p. 80). Certainly most children know the term "savage" as referring to cruelty and brutality rather than to uncultivated and rugged. H.G.</page></plain_text>
