XVI JULY, 1935 No. 3 HENRY CHANDLER COWLES Science, in its historical aspect, may be likened to a tree, constantly branching as the sum total of knowledge grows steadily greater and sub- division of the field becomes necessary. Occasionally a bud of special vigor makes its appearance and gives rise to a branch so dominating that it changes profoundly the contour of the whole organic body. In the science of vegeta- tion, this happened when Humboldt first stressed climate as a causative fac- tor, and again when Grisebach formulated the concept of the plant commu- nity. Quite recently-within the memory of the older ones among us-a particularly vigorous branch has appeared-the dynamic viewpoint. For many decades the bud that produced it had lain dormant. Several times, under the ever increasing environmental influence of Darwinian thought, it tried to break through; with Warming and Schimper it almost succeeded. Finally, in the late nineties, it penetrated the overcrusting bark and shot up into a lusty limb, which today gives abundant promise that it will in time determine the whole form of the tree. The most potent influence-enzyme, hormone, or what you will-that brought about this sudden burgeoning was the early work of Henry Chandler Cowles. He was not, however, from the beginning a botanist. His first work at the University of Chicago was in geology, in the prosecution of which he came under the potent influence of Thomas C. Chamberlin and Rollin D. Salisbury, energetic exponents of the dynamic point of view. In the De- partment of Botany, under John M. Coulter, he became acquainted with the pioneer plant-ecological work of Warming. From the union of botany and physiography, fertilized by the dynamic viewpoint, came a new field for scientific exploration. Ideal materials for study-the dunes of Lake Michi- gan-lay close at hand. In due time emerged a classic-" The Ecological Relations of the Vegetation on the Sand Dunes of Lake Michigan." This was the first comprehensive study of dune phenomena produced in America, and in it the close relations in general between physiography and vegetation were for the first time pointed out. As for its style, would that every candi- date for the doctorate, before beginning to write, might be required to make a careful study of this paper! 28i</page><page sequence="4">282 WILLIAM S. COOPER Ecology, Vol. 16, No. 3 The pioneer work on the dunes was necessarily limited in scope, and Cowles accordingly undertook a more comprehensive study, in an attempt to determine to what extent the viewpoint and method introduced in the study of the dunes were generally applicable. The resulting publication, " The Physiographic Ecology of Chicago and Vicinity," formulates a philosophy of vegetation in which the central principle is that " a classification to be true must be genetic and dynamic." In this paper the concepts of succession and climax find their first adequate expression. The principles here enunciated, to a remarkable degree, have stood the test of time. The promulgator of new ideas is frequently tempted to go too far, to erect a " system" that is rigid and not easily modifiable when new facts appear, and which must later be partially demolished in order that a firm foundation for future construction may be assured. This pitfall Cowles avoided. He was always cautious, never dogmatic. For example, in formu- lating the concept of the climax, he entertained for that state no illusion of permanency: " The condition of equilibrium is never reached, and when we say that there is an approach to the mesophytic forest, we speak only roughly and approximately. As a matter of fact we have a variable approaching a variable rather than a constant." It is no detraction from the credit due to Cowles to recognize the fact that other men, at the same time, were thinking toward similar conclusions. The influence of Darwin's work was slowly permeating the entire body of man's thought, and its transforming effects upon the science of vegetation could not have been much longer delayed. In particular we must pay tribute to Clements, to whom had come, quite independently, the same realization of the fundamental importance of the dynamic viewpoint that had been an inspiration to Cowles. In another and quite distant portion of the field, ecological philosophy owes much to the sane thinking of Cowles. The problem of adaptation has long been, and continues to be, one of the most difficult, and, at the same time, one of the most appealing, in all biology. During the latter half of the nine- teenth century, due to the work of Kerner and others, interest in this field was widespread. The general viewpoint, however, was unfortunate. Tele- ology and anthropomorphism were rampant. At the turn of the century a saner attitude began to make way, but the older viewpoint was too romanti- cally attractive to be easily displaced. As a matter of fact, it still persists in many quarters. In 1911 appeared the " Chicago Text Book of Botany," to which Cowles contributed the second volume, dealing with ecology. Only a portion of the field was covered, namely, the branch commonly known as autecology. It was the first general treatment of this subject in America, its only predeces- sor in the field being the great work by Haberlandt. It differed from the latter in being fitted for the use of beginning students; at the same time it</page><page sequence="5">July, 1935 HENRY CHANDLER COWLES 283 was comprehensive in scope and contained much that was new. Most sig- nificant was the basic viewpoint, which was " that of mechanical causation rather than of teleology and adaptation "-an emphasis salutary and much needed. An attempt was made to exclude every term having in it the slightest tinge of teleology-actually an impossible task, considering the thorough way in which the language is shot through with imagery. As an endeavor toward an ideal, however, the effort was well worth while. Fully as important as his own research has been the influence of Cowles in inspiring research by others. This became evident very early in his career, when there gathered about him a group of men scarcely younger than himself, who enthusiastically entered with him the fresh field of dynamic ecology and applied the principles he was formulating to new regions. Not all of these continued to specialize in ecology, but all gladly acknowledge the influence of his infectious enthusiasm. Since those early days many scores of graduate students have served their research apprenticeship under his direction, and have acquired from him a new ardor in creative work and a sanely progressive outlook upon the problems of science. Even greater is the number of teachers who have learned from him how to use the out-of-doors, how to bring their pupils directly to nature, and, above all, how to unfold to them the myriad mysteries of biology without re- course to the cheap and easy fallacies of anthropomorphism. A man may be a great scientist and a great teacher and yet inspire in his colleagues and students little affection or none at all. With Cowles it is far otherwise. Something more than mere respect for high scientific attainment is necessary to account for the fact that, when the plan for this special number of ECOLOGY was made public, more than three hundred persons responded. With almost every contribution came a letter expressing admiration for Cowles as a scientist, as a teacher, and, above all, as a man. These facts speak for themselves; formal tribute is superfluous. And yet, merely because it is a joy to do so, we make mention of a few of his many lovable traits-his unfailing good humor, his far-famed ability in the telling of a story, his readi- ness to give ungrudgingly of time and effort in the service of students and friends, his eagerness to discover and commend whatever is meritorious in the work of a fellow scientist or admirable in the man himself. He may relinquish his active labors secure in the consciousness of work well done, confident of achievement beyond the ordinary lot. He has laid the foundation for a new and useful branch of science, he has constructively influenced the thought of hundreds of investigators and teachers, and in his professional and personal contacts he has made for himself a multitude of devoted friends. Fortunate and happy is the man with a record of accom- plishment so thoroughly satisfying. Such good fortune and such happiness are the undoubted right and privilege of Henry Chandler Cowles.
