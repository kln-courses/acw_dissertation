University of California Press, Berkeley, 1988. 247 pp., illus. $19.95 (cloth). Few issues have generated as much emotion and fervor on a sustained basis as has the use of animals for experimentation. Although such con- cerns have existed in the United States since the end of the nineteenth cen- tury, only recently have two disparate groups, scientists and animal rights activists, come to face each other across an almost unbridgeable abyss layered with passionate convictions. According to Susan Sperling, the ani- mal rights movement has strong par- allels with the nineteenth-century British antivivisection movement. This is the theme of Animal Libera- tors, an analysis of the emergence of animal rights. In her introduction, Sperling says there are elements of the movement November 1989 741</page><page sequence="2">with which she agrees, that " 'animal rights' groups have focused public attention on the treatment of labora- tory animals; and that they have been-and continue to be successful in bringing about much needed regu- lation of research practices." Unfor- tunately, Sperling attributes these achievements solely to animal rights groups without also recognizing the contributions of many animal welfare organizations that have been involved in such efforts at least since the enact- ment of the Animal Welfare Act in 1966, if not earlier. However, Sperling has reservations about certain key aspects of animal rights ideology: the "disturbing com- parison of 'animal rights' to aboli- tionism and the conflation [or blend- ing together] of the human race and animal species; and that animals and humans share equal moral status, [which] glosses over the complexity of human relationships to animals worldwide." For Sperling, the move- ment holds too ethnocentric and nar- row a view of the human-animal re- lationship. As the animal rights movement grew, Sperling became fascinated by its anthropological and culture- specific issues about the dividing line between humans and animals and about the relationship of humans to nature. She examines the movement in the context of beliefs about animals and their symbolic meaning during the Victorian and Modern periods. She asks why antivivisectionism arose in Victorian times, why the animal rights movement has arisen in the present time, and if there are parallels between the two. To address the first question, Sper- ling describes the development of nineteenth-century antivivisection- ism. She constructs a picture of anti- vivisectionism in England as a "move- ment addressing trends in society richly symbolized by the act of dis- secting an animal; that this single issue was an identification by the working class and women who felt that they were treated like animals by physicians whose callousness .. was related to their training as vivisectors; that animals became the carriers of anthropomorphic projections specific to the new urban, industrial society; and that the border between orga- nism and machine was threatened by 'instrumental violations,' e.g., incur- sions by vivisectors into animals and by physicians into human beings." Sperling quotes, as so many have, from the now-classic volume of Rich- ard French (1975): "Antivivisection foresaw the cold, barren alienation of a future dominated by imperatives of technique and expertise. It was not experiments on animals they were protesting, it was the shape of the century to come." To address the question of why the animal rights movement arose in the last 10 years, Sperling provides details of her 1984 interviews with nine members of such organizations in the San Francisco Bay area. None of her informants was officially designated to speak for their organizations, and one can question the representative- ness of the group. Yet Sperling be- lieves they were able to describe quite clearly not only their own goals, ob- jectives, and attitudes, but also those of their groups. All were educated and from urban backgrounds and all appeared to challenge the norms of Western culture, particularly as they relate to animals. Sperling is critical of their belief in the concept of speciesism; they be- lieve that human treatment of animals is, like racism, a form of immoral oppression. They viewed technologi- cal medicine as an expression of the violence of our society and of destruc- tion in the world and linked animal experimentation with ecological cri- ses. It would seem that for these groups the abolition of animal exper- imentation will restore the natural environment and return us to an Eden in which humans and animals will share a peaceable kingdom. Sperling compares these antiscience and anti-intellectual attitudes with those of the British antivivisection movement. Although her sample is small and taken from a specific re- gion, Sperling says that there are strong parallels between the attitudes of the two groups and that their sym- bolism of the use of animals for ex- perimentation is the same. She refers, for example, to the activities and stated aims of the Animal Liberation Front (ALF) and the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA). In a press release, ALF said it con- ducted a recent break-in at the Uni- versity of Arizona "as an act of mercy and compassion for the individual animal victims, and also as part of a larger international campaign against the scientific/medical industry's mis- guided, anti-human, anti-earth, prof- it-oriented practices of vivisection, biotechnology and synthetic pharma- ceutical research" (NABR Update 1989). Although Sperling does make some ideologic division within the move- ment, one cannot help but come away with the impression that it is the difference in degree of activities (e.g., violent versus nonviolent) not in ide- ology that determines the distinction between radical and moderate. Sper- ling reminds us that "In 1984, many researchers were uncertain about whether adherents [to animal rights organizations] really sought reform in the treatment of laboratory animals or the total abolition of research," and that, "It was clear to me from my discussions with animal rights activ- ists that for most, the ultimate goal was total abolition and the issue of reform merely a stepping stone to this end." She says that although it is widely recognized that these groups are committed to antivivisection, for political reaons they hesitate to refer to themselves as antivivisectionists, because the term is evocative of fanat- ics to many people. One of the most important themes of this book is the concept of bound- aries. As an anthropologist, one of Sperling's concerns is with natural cosmology, or the boundaries that exist between humans and animals within nature. The antispeciesist ide- ology of animal rights groups, that to the activists there are no differences in moral status between animals and hu- mans, indicates to Sperling that those boundaries have been abolished. Whether all these groups believe that boundaries have been invalidated for every animal species is not known, but it indeed seems to be the case for companion animals and certain pri- mates. If these particular species are considered equal in status with hu- mans, what of their use as subjects for research and what sort of protection would they receive? The 1978 Belmont Report on the use of human subjects for research involves the concept of beneficence, justice, and autonomy and defines an autonomous person as "an individual 742 BioScience Vol. 39 No. 10</page><page sequence="3">capable of deliberation about per- sonal goals and of acting under the direction of such deliberation." Such persons can function as their own moral agents. However, persons with diminished autonomy (e.g., those who are mentally or physically im- paired) or, in the case of children, with immature autonomy, would re- quire more protection than those with full autonomy. In the case of infants and fetuses, with potential but unde- veloped autonomy, they would re- quire even more protection. If, as asserted by animal rights organiza- tions, certain species (perhaps ulti- mately all species) of animals are con- sidered equal to humans in moral status and consideration, but lack au- tonomy or moral agency, would it follow that they would need still more protection in research than even in- fants and fetuses? The word boundaries, in relation to humans and animals, has appeared again more recently. In the 1989 Office of Technology Assessment report, New Developments in Biotech- nology: Patenting Life, ethical con- cerns are evinced about the implanta- tion of human genetic material into animals. In that report, a question is raised about how much human genetic material must be implanted into an animal before the boundary between human and animal is abolished. The report continues with additional con- cerns about the blurring of the distinc- tion between human and animal spe- cies. It seems likely that we shall hear more about this concept in the future. Animal Liberators is unlikely to con- vince scientists of the justification or virtue of the animal rights movement. However, it should serve as an impor- tant base of information for the general public who, concerned about the use of animals for experimentation, may be considering joining animal rights orga- nizations. If Sperling is correct, and the ideology of her sample is indeed more or less that of the majority of the ani- mal rights organizations in this country today and should their cause succeed, progress in science and medicine will certainly be curtailed. A detrimental effect on the life and health of both humans and animals will result. The public must understand and be willing to accept this loss. JERI A. SECHZER E. W.
