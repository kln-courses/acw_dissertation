<plain_text><page sequence="1">SACRED SUBJECTS AND THE AVERSIVE METAPHYSICAL CONCEIT: CRASHAW, SERRANO, OFILI BY RICHARD RAMBUSS I. Richard Crashaw's place within the canons of taste, to the extent that he still retains one, is as an author critics have loved to hate. In his own time, however, this seventeenth-century metaphysical poet was (apart from the ire of some radical Puritan iconoclasts) mostly well regarded. In the succeeding centuries, as we shall see, the critical estimation of Crashaw turns wildly various. But then even the poet's detractors tend to deem him one of the most ingenious of the metaphysicals: that is, one of the most metaphysical of the metaphysicals, a group of writers known for their startling poetic conceits and their flair for juxtaposing seemingly discordant domains of meaning to acute sensate effect. The late-Victorian poet and essayist Francis Thompson thus declares that Crashaw (and not John Donne) stands as "the highest product of the Metaphysical School."' Although now little read and even less taught, Crashaw was also not without his modern admirers. Notable among them was William Empson, whose Seven Types of Ambiguity selects passages from Crashaw's sacred epigrams and hymns as representative of its seventh and ultimate form of ambiguity, whereby opposed affective reactions are simultaneously triggered by the same passage of text or image.2 T. S. Eliot, whose critical protocols and cultural investments could hardly be more different from Empson's, also writes admiringly of Crashaw, placing him, along with Donne, at the center of his account of the expressive workings of the metaphysical style.3 But in differen- tiating Crashaw from Donne, Eliot also influentially emphasizes what he sees as the Roman Catholic and Continental features of Crashaw's work, determining that "[h]ad he lived today he could only have dwelt in Florence or in Rome." Remarkably, Eliot goes so far as to hail this English metaphysical as the greatest baroque poet of all, as "more baroque than the baroque."4 ELH 71 (2004) 497-530 @ 2004 by The Johns Hopkins University Press 497</page><page sequence="2">Crashaw regularly serves as an exemplary poet, no matter that what he is shown to be a prime example of has varied dramatically. Indeed, it is the other line of Crashaw criticism-the more pronouncedly phobic one-that will be my first concern here, in an essay whose ultimate subject is aversion for religious representations in the metaphysical mode, both early modern and postmodern. Crashaw criticism is an annals of such distaste. In it, we find his poetry (or at least certain notorious passages) adduced as a bench- mark of bad taste and indecorum. Crashaw serves as the signal illustration of metaphysical excess, particularly as it took up with what is seen to be a too sensuous, too erotic mode of religious devotion, "a kind of introversion of the sensual into the spiritual," as one critic would disapprovingly put it.5 Readers have thus been affronted by Crashaw's "spiritualized voluptuousness" and "his hysterical inten- sity"; by his incorrigible conceit-making, which has been branded as "intolerable," "silly," and "excruciatingly insistent"; by "the utterness of his sentiment, the intensity of his emotion, the cheap glitter of his diction.'"6 Although Eliot apparently found something to relish in Crashaw's Catholic bent, critics have more typically seen this poet's religious apostasy as of a piece with his aesthetic improprieties. "If [George] Herbert with his restrained passion represents the spirit of the Anglican communion," notes one Victorian miscellany of sacred verse, "Crashaw with his fervor and want of taste may well stand for Rome."'7 William Hazlitt paradoxically describes Crashaw as a reli- gious poet "without much religion," one who nonetheless-or just so-becomes "fascinated by the glittering bait of Popery."s Crashaw, for Hazlitt, is "a hectic enthusiast in religion and in poetry, and erroneous in both."9 Even A. C. Swinburne, whose own decadent writings have more than once drawn comparison to Crashavian excess, finds this poetry "steeped in Catholic sentiment and de- formed by fantastic devotion."10 Henry Southern, writing in the inaugural issue of The Retrospective Review, an early nineteenth- century periodical devoted to the reappraisal of neglected poets from the past, does think to include Crashaw among those who merit some critical reconsideration. But he too complains that Crashaw "dresses up a sacred topic in a painted vest so gaudy and flowery, as to be disgusting to the simpler taste of a good protestant." "No one," Southern continues, "ought to write poems 'on the bleeding wounds of our crucified Lord,' or 'on our Lord, naked and bloody,'" referring here by title to two of the poet's many lyric rhapsodies on what we 498 Sacred Subjects</page><page sequence="3">suggestively term Christ's Passion." A bad faith apparently makes for bad taste. We do not know whether all the Passion poems that Southern finds so decidedly unpalatable to English Protestant tastes were composed before or after Crashaw, near the end of his relatively brief life, forsook the Church of England and fled the English Revolution for the Continent. Most likely, many were written before. Indeed, Anthony h Wood's biographical entry on Crashaw in his 1689 history of Oxford University (where in 1644 the poet briefly had sought refuge within the Catholic court-in-exile of Henrietta Maria) suggests that the High Churchman Crashaw would never have "changed his religion," apart from his "infallible foresight that the Church of England would be quite ruined by the unlimited fury of the Presby- terians."'2 Even so, the reflexive tendency of most critics has been to place all of Crashaw's religious works aside the bona fide line of English literature. Barbara Kiefer Lewalski, for instance, summarily excludes Crashaw from the purview of her influential book on Protestant Poetics by treating him as always already a Roman Catholic convert. "Crashaw writes out of a very different aesthetics emanating from Trent and the continental Counter Reformation," she main- tains, in terms that I find to be overly schematic, both religiously and aesthetically.13 But even George Walton Williams, editor of the most recent edition of Crashaw's complete works (now long gone out of print), begins the introductory essay to his volume by suggesting that "Crashaw may be considered the most un-English of all the English poets." And Williams concludes his introduction by conceding that Crashaw's "is a small voice, and among discriminating critics, few are sympathetic to it."'4 It gets worse. Various Crashaw poems-though, interestingly, always the religious ones-have been cited by an array of critics as exemplifying what Southern, writing in 1820, flatly deems to be "perverted taste."5 Here is "[t]he extreme of the grotesque and repulsive," Elisha Kane likewise asserts one hundred years later, with reference to an epigram on the Christ Child's Circumcision, the actual terms of which, Kane finds, "are really beyond citation."'16 Joan Bennett notes that "Crashaw loves to elaborate sensations," but, she continues, "his sensations are peculiar and sometimes repellent." "Where Herbert seems simple and austere," remarks Eliot, "Crashaw seems almost vulgarly opulent and decorated." "Reprehensible as theology and intolerable as poetry," charges C. A. Patrides. "[I]n the worst possible taste," declares Robert Martin Adams. Crashaw, Richard Rambuss 499</page><page sequence="4">laments an otherwise sympathetic Ruth Wallerstein, can be "the very model of bad taste in poetry"; indeed, his poems, Wallerstein concedes, "comprehend passages of the worst taste, not merely in rhetoric, but in spirit, to be found in the whole range of English poetry.""17 The charge that Crashaw is liable for the worst bits in the canon seems first to have been advanced by Edmund Gosse in an influential (and not entirely dismissive) 1883 essay for Cornhill Magazine. The most outrageous passage of all according to Gosse (and no few critics after him) appears in the poem "The Weeper," the work that (whether by Crashaw's own design or his printer's) has first place in Steps to the Temple, the volume of Crashaw's English religious verse published in 1646. Eventually swelling to thirty-one stanzas in the revised version that appears in both the expanded 1648 Steps and then again in the posthumous Carmen Deo Nostro of 1652, "The Weeper" is an outpouring of fantastic metaphysical conceits on the prodigiously tearful eyes of that exemplar of contrition, Mary Magdalene: Hail, sister springs! Parents of silver-footed rills! Ever bubbling things! Thawing crystal! snowy hills, Still spending, never spent! I mean Thy fair eyes, sweet Magdalene!'8 Two-thirds of the way into the revised version of "The Weeper," at stanza 19, Crashaw contrives and then relentlessly dilates a conceit that beggars our powers of imagination when the Magdalene's plethoric penitential tears suddenly pool and take aqueous shape as "Two walking baths; two weeping motions; / Portable, and compendi- ous oceans" (113-14). These ambulatory sister seas, we are told, will follow Christ "where'er he strays" (109). "If language be ever liable to abuse in the hands of a clever poet," declares Gosse, "it is surely outraged here." "These are," he contin- ues, "the worst lines in Crashaw. They are perhaps the worst in all English poetry." But having just maligned them as establishing the very nadir of all English poetry, Gosse then goes on to insist that the lines "must not be omitted" from critical consideration, "since they indicate to us the principal danger to which not he only but most of his compeers were liable."'19 Indeed, for a long time "The Weeper" had the curious distinction of being both Crashaw's most reviled and most anthologized poem. 500 Sacred Subjects</page><page sequence="5">Crashaw's small fame as the author of the canon's worst poetry- that is, the worst of our best poetry-raises important questions about shifting notions of taste (in literature, in devotion), but also about the critical utility of the placeholder of "the worst," of that which can be or even must be scorned. What kinds of cultural work can this devaluation-which is more complex than mere critical dismissal-be made to perform? Specifically with regard to the case at hand, we might ask what infelicities of style, what excesses of affect, what improprieties of devotion can thereby be displaced from other, now more esteemed religious writers of the time onto Crashaw, an author who probably has accumulated more detractors than any other early modern poet and certainly some of the most florid critical censure. Crashaw-the bad taste poet, the religious apostate, the least English of English authors-is thus set at the far margins of the canons of taste, admonishingly positioned there, inside and outside at once, to mark what transgresses the parameters of acceptable literary and religious expression. Yet with Crashaw's collected works out of print for decades and his allotted anthological space becoming ever slimmer, even that marginal position now appears to be eroding.20 Why should this be so? Past generations of readers were wont to rail against Crashaw's improprieties (often matching in their criticism his excesses with their own), but they at least read and wrote about him.21 How is it that now this poet all but goes without mention?22 II. Crashaw is an Incarnationalist, prone to converting operations of the soul into spectacles of the body, to metaphorizing spiritual processes and truths into viscerally charged somatic displays or emblems. In "The Weeper," Mary Magdalene's contrition is drained of its interior content-of the spiritual psychology of penance-and is stylized, as we have seen, in the form of a gushingly porous body. Indeed, the penitent herself is all but dissolved into a superflux of fluids, into an inconceivable hyperbole of liquefacient conceits, into oceans of penitential tears.23 The poem's other hydraulics are hardly less spectacular. Consider the central conceit of stanzas 4 and 5, another favorite whipping boy of the critics. Here, instead of splash- ing onto the earth, Mary's tears waft upwards, feeding into the celestial stream of the Milky Way, into what Crashaw, in another of his incarnalizing figurations, terms "Heav'n's bosom": Richard Rambuss 501</page><page sequence="6">Upwards thou dost weep. Heav'n's bosom drinks the gentle stream. Where th' milky rivers creep, Thine floats above; and is the cream. Waters above th' heav'ns, what they be We're taught best by thy tears and thee. Every morn from hence A brisk cherub something sips Whose sacred influence Adds sweetness to his sweetest lips. Then to his music. And his song Tastes of this breakfast all day long. (19-30) The gravity-defying, heavenward trajectory of the true penitent's tears (too precious to be spilt) was something of a devotional commonplace. But Crashaw characteristically cannot stop there. Instead, he adds to the scene an efficient angel who, before he takes to his music, makes a brisk breakfast out of these tears reconcocted to cream so that they can be lapped from the surface of the Milky Way.24 Notwithstanding such outlandish flights of fancy, Crashaw para- doxically also turns out to be the most domestic and the most utilitarian of the metaphysicals. We saw this in the infamous nine- teenth stanza of "The Weeper," which juxtaposes the extravagance of teardrops so abundant as to comprise dual oceans with the utility of portable footbaths. The same domesticating utilitarianism is also evident here in stanza 5 as its final, gustatory turn makes Crashaw's confectionery conceit suddenly serviceable to a rather practical end: that of provisioning heaven's inhabitants, or at least one of them. (As in Milton's Paradise Lost, Crashaw's angels eat-or rather drink.) Indeed, as Crashaw tropes from the Magdalene's salt tears of remorse to sweetened breakfast cream to lip-smacking angelic aftertaste, his fluid string of conceits effectively manages to imbue this exceedingly strange religious tableau, at once lachrymose and winsome, with a familiar, even homely intimacy: with the milk of human kindness, or better kinship, which, in this poet's conception, remarkably can be brokered even between a repentant prostitute and a dulcet cherub. And yet at the same time, as Robert Martin Adams points out in a tart essay from the 1950s called "Taste and Bad Taste in Metaphysical Poetry," there remains "something slightly nauseating" about all this.25 In her 1935, selectively appreciative book on Crashaw, Ruth Wallerstein likewise recoils at "the grotesque physicality" of what 502 Sacred Subjects</page><page sequence="7">"The Weeper" forces upon us.26 William Miller's recent foray through the repulsive, The Anatomy of Disgust, finds the world to be a dangerously charged minefield of revulsion, one in which nearly every biological process and substance makes its own case for being the vilest of all. Miller nonetheless posits that "[s]ome things seem almost incapable of eliciting disgust." "How low," he speculates, "are the odds that tears will be?" The eyes, Miller later expounds, are "the only orifice from which a non-disgusting secretion flows: tears, which owe their privileged position," he continues "to their source, their clarity, their liquidity, their non-adhering nature, their lack of odor, and their clean taste."27 Yet one wonders whether Miller would have been moved to wager otherwise about even the crystalline teardrop in view of "The Weeper" and the highly aversive body of criticism that the poem has accrued over the past two centuries. That sense of revulsion, as we already have been considering, is triggered as much by the sheer prodigiousness of the Weeper's lachrymal outpouring as it is a function of her tears' ever protean capacity to take on the properties of other substances, including several that might have their place in Miller's taxonomy of disgust. Thus, in addition to sugared milk cream and cleansing bath water, the Weeper's tears are, over the course of the poem, found to be like liquid astral seed or semen in stanza 2; bottled drinking water for God, but wine for his angels in stanza 12; molten silver coinage in stanza 21; alchemical elixir in stanza 25; and the perfumed sweat wrung from tortured roses in stanza 27-among many other things. At the beginning of the poem, the Magdalene's tears are so buoyant as to float heavenward. A few stanzas later, they have hardened into beautiful pearls that can be worn as jewelry around Sorrow's regal neck (stanza 7). A few stanzas more and the tears have suddenly turned liquescent again, but this time as an effluvium thickened and congealed enough to "creep" (57) along the "sordid earth" (170) toward "our Lord's feet" (186): the ultimate destination for what, in yet one more transmogrification, becomes a teeming brood of "bright brothers, / The fugitive sons of those fair eyes / Your fruitful mothers!" (153-55). "The Weeper," we are told, will faithfully follow Christ "where'er he strays." In the epigram "On the wounds of our crucified Lord" that trail ends up at the foot of the cross. In this dramatically chromatic Passion poem, designated by one critic as "the purest example of Crashaw's metaphysical style," the overflow of Mary Magdalene's "still spending, never spent" tears finds its match in the stream of Richard Rambuss 503</page><page sequence="8">blood that issues from Christ's open or "wakeful" wounds.28 Crashaw writes: O these wakeful wounds of thine! Are they mouths? or are they eyes? Be they mouths, or be they eyne, Each bleeding part some one supplies. Lo! a mouth, whose full-bloomed lips At too dear a rate are roses. Lo! a bloodshot eye! that weeps And many a cruel tear discloses. O thou that on this foot hast laid Many a kiss, and many a tear, Now thou shalt have all repaid. Whatsoe'er thy charges were. This foot hath got a mouth and lips, To pay the sweet sum of thy kisses: To pay thy tears, an eye that weeps Instead of tears such gems as this is. The difference only this appears, (Nor can the change offend) The debt is paid in ruby-tears, Which thou in pearls didst lend.29 This is surrealism avant la lettre. Crashaw amorously blazons Christ's hemorrhaging wounds as so many lovely mouths, all with "full- bloomed lips": a conceit that is simultaneously farfetched and techni- cally precise, "lips" being, then as now, a medical term for the margins of a wound. Or, ponders Crashaw, are these orifices more like eyes, bloodshot ones? His feet thus scored by wounds that are mouths that are eyes, the Savior can recompense the Weeper salvific blood for sorrowing tears, but also loving kiss for loving kiss. The poem thus recasts the Christian doctrine of the atonement as a form of purchased love, one that none too decorously at once recalls and redeems what was seen to be (according to several traditions) the Magdalene's former profession. "Now thou shalt have all repaid. / Whatsoe'er thy charges were," this Venus in sackcloth is told, as Christ purchases her love, her kisses for himself, paying for them with his own store of ruby gems. Here, as in "The Weeper," we find that the mutability of the body's openings is matched by the convertibility of its fluids. In "On the 504 Sacred Subjects</page><page sequence="9">wounds," blood turns into tears and tears into blood, into "ruby-tears" secreted from "bloodshot" eyes that are also "full-bloomed lips." In another of his many epigrams on Jesus' wounds in Steps to the Temple, Crashaw figures Christ's blood as ink: "Once I did spell / Every red letter / A wound of thine."30 In his "Sancta Maria Dolorum," the Blessed Virgin's "eyes bleed tears, [Christ's] wounds weep blood" (20). In "A Hymn to the Honor and Name of the Admirable Saint Teresa," the saint's mystic wounds "weep / Balsam to heal themselves with" (108-9). A still more unsettling confluence of bodily fluids occurs in "Luke 11: Blessed be the paps which Thou hast sucked," which Adams memorably dubs "a little gem of en- crusted grotesquerie."31 Here blood is served for milk, as Christ's wounded side is transmogrified into a male mammary gland from which his own mother-from which all mothers-must nurse: Suppose he had been tabled at thy teats, Thy hunger feels not what he eats: He'll have his teat ere long (a bloody one) The mother then must suck the son.32 I began by remarking that Crashaw was fairly well regarded, not widely hated or derided, in his own time. As a twenty-year-old undergraduate at Pembroke College, Cambridge, he was selected to pen tributary verses to Lancelot Andrewes for inclusion in the 1632 publication of that renowned Anglican preacher's sermons. Two years later, Crashaw published a celebrated volume of Latin religious epigrams, Epigrammatum Sacrorum Liber. Selections from it show up on a 1637 list of recommended readings for undergraduates at Emmanuel College, Cambridge-an institution famous, not for the High Church sacramentalism with which Crashaw is usually associ- ated, but rather for its Puritan reformatory zeal. David Lloyd, in a biographical note from 1668, praises Crashaw's "divine fancy," which, he reports, was "so famous" both at Pembroke and at Peterhouse, where he later held a fellowship. "What nation can show more refined witts then those of our Ben [Jonson], our Shakespeare, our Beaumont, our Fletcher, ... our Crashaw, ... our Sidney, our Bacon?" exults Henry Belasyse in his 1657 appreciation of English literary culture.33 Milton's nephew Edward Phillips likewise places Crashaw in a select company of eminent contemporary English authors in his 1675 Theatrum Poetarum. Similarly, John Dunton hails Crashaw as one of England's nineteen best poets in his 1692 Young- Students-Library.34 In the next century, Alexander Pope would Richard Rambuss 505</page><page sequence="10">provide the first real piece of Crashaw criticism, noting that while his thoughts are "oftentimes far fetch'd and too often strain'd," Crashaw is "one of those whose works may just deserve reading." Although Pope's appraisal is not wholly laudatory, he does rank Crashaw above Herbert.35 The very title of Crashaw's book, Steps to the Temple, styles him Herbert's disciple. Accordingly, Crashaw is repeatedly heralded as "the second Herbert" over the centuries and on occasion, though seemingly never now, even Herbert's better.36 Nonetheless, Crashaw is not another Herbert. Nor is it my design in endeavoring to recall attention to this maligned, now almost forgotten, metaphysical to discount his extravagances or to dampen the force of the metaphysical shudder they can still deliver. Doing so would make Crashaw a far less compelling devotional poet than I believe him to be. What I do want to argue is that the qualities for which his verse has been assailed-the opulence of his conceit- making; his indecorous commingling of disparate fields of reference or meaning; his extreme physical, often erotic renderings of spiritual states and events; the disconcerting melange of affects that all this induces in even the most sympathetic reader-are derived from within and not apart from the signifying systems available to a seventeenth-century English Christian poet. Indeed, analogues can be found in other of the period's devotional texts for many of the most seemingly eccentric passages in Crashaw, even those "Two walking baths" from "The Weeper," those "portable, and compendious oceans" of penitential tears. In fact, those lines may be echoing (and of course hyperbolizing) a conceit framed by Andrewes, who, in one of the sermons published in the very volume to which Crashaw contributed a commendatory opening poem, preaches that "Mary Magdalene wept enough to have made a bath.""37 This is to say that Crashaw less represents outright literary or religious deviancy than he does an intensely amplified strain of affective piety, especially as it is set to music in a poetics ascribed to those who "endeavoured to be singular in their thoughts" and whose "wish was only to say what they hoped had been never said before." A poetics known for its "slender conceits and laboured particularities," its "perverseness of industry" and "grossness of expression"; a poetics in which "dissimilar images" and the "most heterogeneous ideas are yoked by violence together" with "nature and art . .. ransacked for illustrations, comparisons and allusions." This, of course, is a recitation of the defining traits, not of an idiosyncratic Crashaw alone, but of the entire metaphysical "race of writers," as Samuel Johnson pejoratively inventories their practices 506 Sacred Subjects</page><page sequence="11">in his Lives of the Poets.38 The author of a seriously sensationalist body of poetry, Crashaw seems always to be aiming to render just such metaphysical special effects in a surfeit of figuration, to transume this linguistic excess into religious ecstasy. The aim here ever being, as Eliot admiringly recognizes, "to stimulate, to over-stimulate feel- ing lest it should flag."39 Yet it should also be said that Crashaw's tenuous marginalization to the outskirts of the seventeenth-century canon-"an idiosyncratic extreme" Janel Mueller dubs him-serves a scapegoat function.40 It is a way of affording latitude to the other, now more esteemed metaphysicals in their own less frequent lapses into the excessively sentimental, the sensational, even the aversive. Their devotional expression might fall off in the direction of tastelessness now and again-say in Herbert's own Magdalene poem, which opens with the scene of "blessed Mary" donning Christ's dusty feet "for a jewel on her head," having just rinsed them in a flood of her tears and then toweled them dry with her hair.41 Or in Robert Herrick's piece "To his Saviour. The New yeers gift," where the poet claims Jesus' freshly circumcised foreskin as his own holiday present: "That little prettie bleeding part / Of Foreskin send to me," he writes.42 Or in Donne's heavily anthologized Holy Sonnet 14, "Batter my heart, three- personed God," which stunningly metaphorizes divine election as violent ravishment, as rape: a consummation devoutly to be wished. Yet whatever their occasional lapses of decorum, at least these other metaphysicals (so we are told) are not like Crashaw, who somehow manages to be so tasteless nearly all the time. Hence we find William Kerrigan, for instance, gratuitously pausing in the midst of his discussion of the most unnerving aspects of the Holy Sonnets' divine anthropomorphism to sigh in relief that "Donne, thankfully, was not Crashaw."43 I would instead say that Crashaw is like Donne, at least to the extent that both poets sensationalize the most fundamental tenets of the Incarnational Christianity they espoused to such palpable effect that we are jolted into experiencing anew (or perhaps even for the first time) the expressive strangeness of the religion's conven- tions. Such an effect, I would further say, is nothing short of the very aim of metaphysical wit. Richard Rambuss 507</page><page sequence="12">III. Having endeavored to reincorporate Crashaw into the canon of seventeenth-century metaphysicals, I want now to align him with two contemporary ones. The first is the photographer Andres Serrano, whose provocative juxtapositions and admixtures of the sacred and the profane, the luminously otherworldly and trenchantly this worldly, have triggered their own version of the infamous metaphysical shudder.44 The metaphysical poetics underlying Serrano's photogra- phy are most evident in the work for which he is most notorious, his body fluids series from the late 1980s. In these large-scale, glossy Cibachrome prints, Serrano makes use of various vital liquids to produce images that are at once coolly abstract and, when we grasp the material means of their production (typically signaled in Serrano's bluntly confrontational titles), highly visceral. The photograph Un- titled VII (Ejaculate in Trajectory) (figure 1) looks like an action painting. Milk, Blood (figure 2), a double color-field diptych, suggests the abstract rectangles of Mondrian, even as it induces queasiness by counterposing body fluids that we tend to want to see kept separate. "Blood is a sensuous material, like pigment," Serrano has explained; his use of urine, he added, meant no more than a third hue for his palette (figure 3).45 For Serrano to proffer milk, blood, urine, and semen so formalistically as no more than color is, of course, itself a conceit. The metaphysically expressive mismatch between form and content, stylization and figuration, is hyperbolized in the more representational of Serrano's immersion photographs, particularly the religious ones, such as Milk Cross (figure 4), which also evokes the monumental, eerily beautiful series of "Crosses" that Andy Warhol produced just a few years earlier (figure 5). While Serrano aimed to render painterly effects with his palette of vital fluids, Warhol, who in the last five years of his life had increasingly turned to the representation of religious subjects, based his duochrome paint- ings on a photograph of a plain wooden cross, the kind sold in religious supply houses.46 Like the silk-screened smudging of colors at the borders of Warhol's Cross (Yellow), the bodily fluids that were set side by side, but still kept separate, in Milk, Blood now inter- mingle around the cross's breached borders. Serrano's photograph might thus be contextualized as a pop art abstraction, via Warhol, of the medieval and Renaissance iconographic tradition that depicts the Crucified Christ as a male mother or wet nurse, one who provides his blood as spiritual food and drink, as milk-much like what we find in 508 Sacred Subjects</page><page sequence="13">Figure 1.

Milk, after all, was long thought to be derived from menstrual blood.47 Even so, blood and milk are not to be mingled-Levitical interdic- tion renders this taboo-but mingle here they do, as they do yet more profusely in Crashaw's poetry, where the confluence of milk and blood marks a kind of primal scene of martyrdom and redemption. Consider his epigram on the slaughter of the Holy Innocents, plucked sucking from their mothers' breasts: To see both blended in one flood The mothers' milk, the children's blood, Makes me doubt if heaven will gather, Roses hence, or lilies rather.48 The massacre of these sinless male virgins was read typologically as a prefigurement of the crucifixion of Jesus, another chaste male innocent. As so many Christian writers have rendered it, that sacrifice-the sacrifice to end all sacrifices-amounted to a blood- bath. Christ "has washed us from our sins in his own blood," the Book of Revelation declares (1:5): a commonplace of the faith that Serrano revitalizes with a heightened visceral charge in Blood Cross (figure 6), Richard Rambuss 511</page><page sequence="16">Figure 6.

It is full tide. From thy head and from thy feet, From thy hands and from thy side All purple rivers meet. Thy restless feet now cannot go For us and our eternal good, As they were ever wont. What though? They swim. Alas, in their own flood. (1-4, 9-12) Both Crashaw and Serrano render sacred forms that have sprung leaks in ecstatic, defiling, redemptive, disgusting ways, producing "combinations of confused magnificence" of the sort that had so provoked Johnson in his account of metaphysical poetics.50 512 Sacred Subjects</page><page sequence="17">Figure 7.

"Inter faeces et urinam nascimur." If this is what it means to be born human, to have a body, then so too for the Incarnate Christ, who, as one early Church creed expresses it, is "truly God and truly man, ... of one substance with us as regards his manhood; like us in all respects, apart from sin."51 Considered in this context, Serrano's most notorious and most metaphysical work, Piss Christ (figure 8), can be received as an assertion of doctrine, as an unusually intrepid affirmation of Christianity's central tenet: the Incarnation. Orthodox Christology has it that Jesus can redeem us not because he is God, but because he is both God and man---because he is God in human form, fully human form. Serrano's numinously beautiful, soft-focus image of a cheap wooden and plastic crucifix, shimmering in a red- gold haze again recalls Warhol's glowing Crosses, as though Serrano had superimposed Warhol's Cross (Red) upon his Cross (Yellow). But Serrano's use in Piss Christ of a defiling-or is it purifying?-bodily fluid to supply that aura (as well as his replacement of Warhol's cross with a crucifix) also has the effect of dramatically recarnalizing the fundamentals of Christian dogma. So too does Andrew Hudgins's poem on Serrano's photograph and the cultural controversy it gener- Richard Rambuss 513</page><page sequence="18">Figure 8. Andres Serrano, Piss Christ, 1987.

Hudgins presses the point of Christ's full, vulnerable human physicality even harder than Serrano, as he imagines Christ's suffer- ing on the cross: He peed, ejaculated, shat, wept, bled- bled under Pontius Pilate, and I assume the mutilated god, the criminal, humiliated god, voided himself on the cross, and blood and urine smeared his legs- the Piss Christ thrown in glowing blood, the whole and irreducible point of his descent: God plunged in human waste, and radiant.52 Of course, my theologizing Serrano's Piss Christ hardly exhausts the meanings of this meaning-intensive icon, which is no doubt 514 Sacred Subjects</page><page sequence="19">Figure 9.

Is it the denigration of the sacred in a commercial world? "Abstraction, religious art, and kitsch become indistinguishable," Wendy Steiner ascertains of Serrano, "when we do not know whether to read formally, piously, or ironically."53) What I want to emphasize in this discussion is how Serrano's photograph recalls for us that Jesus' body was a real body, a functioning human body, and that it was Christianity's own code of atonement that required that his body be physically degraded on the cross. "For [God] hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God" (Romans 5:21). Jesus became sin, became defilement itself. Even God the Father, the Gospels tell us, had to turn away in disgust from this ignominious sight. The spectacular debasement of a sacred body that works our redemption and is therefore viewed as both horrifying and lovely, shameful and hallowed: this is Christianity's own metaphysical paradox. Contem- plating Christ's broken, bloody, defiled body on the cross, Herbert is thus moved to declare: "Thou art my loveliness, my life, my light, / Beauty alone to me."54 Richard Rambuss 515</page><page sequence="20">Miller's Anatomy of Disgust maps the world as "a dangerous place in which the polluting powers of the low are usually stronger than the purifying powers of the high."55 The play on beauty and bodily waste in Piss Christ, however, puts that matter to debate. Or, rather, we find here that the full immersion of the divine into the human, into the messy conditions of embodiment, is simultaneously polluting and elevating-and this equally so for both the divine and the human, even with respect to the basest workings of the latter. "I don't really feel that I destroy icons. I feel that I create new ones," maintains Serrano, who had himself confirmed in the Catholic Church at age thirteen. He has also said that the ideal venue for Piss Christ is a church, not a gallery.56 While I am not aware of any church that has yet taken up Serrano's dare, in 2001 New York's Cathedral of St. John the Divine did exhibit some of his work as part of a Lenten meditation. These works were chosen from two later Serrano series: The Church (1991), comprised of portraits of ecclesiastical persons and things, and The Morgue (Causes of Death) (1992), perhaps the photographer's most challenging work yet, featuring images of anony- mous corpses in close-up-faces, limbs, torsos, skeins of charred and semiliquid skin-here doing the work of momento mori (figure 9). Crashaw, it could be said, ends up where Serrano began, which is within the compass of Roman Catholicism. But the early modern metaphysical was no more inclined than the provocateur of Piss Christ to shy away from what may appear to some to be the-unseemly dimensions of a deep Incarnationalism, of what another early church creed, the Creed of St. Athanasius, describes as "the taking of the Manhood into God." The following stanza, which Crashaw adds in the course of his English rendering of the Dies Irae, is indicative of just how thoroughgoing his Incarnationalism was. Like Hudgins, Crashaw here directs us to the lower zone of Christ's body as he hangs upon the cross: O let thine own soft bowels pay Thyself; and so discharge that day. If sin can sigh, love can forgive. O say the word my soul shall live. (45-48) The Bible makes the bowels the seat of our passions. "My beloved put his hand by the hole of the door," declares the lover in the Song of Songs, "and my bowels were moved for him" (5:4). Similarly, St. Paul enjoins his own beloved disciple Philemon, "Yeah, brother, let 516 Sacred Subjects</page><page sequence="21">me have joy of thee in the Lord; refresh my bowels in the Lord" (Philemon 20). But the proximity between "discharge" and "soft bowels" that punningly structures Crashaw's conceit allows us to conceive-if only for a moment, before we banish the notion as vulgar, even unthinkable-how even scatology might be incorporated into soteriology, into the representational economy ("pay / Thyself") of the redemption of mankind, into the "taking of the Manhood into God," as wrought by Christ's fully realized Incarnation.57 By way of contrast, we might here consider one more image from Serrano's body fluid series, his anodyne White Christ (figure 10), offered as a response to the outcry over Piss Christ and, as I read it, a banal image about the banality of religious purity. The conceptual distance between the purgative, saving discharge of Christ's tender bowels of mercy in Crashaw's "Dies Irae" and Serrano's Piss Christ is not all that vast. Nor, to add another contemporary metaphysical conceit-maker to the mix, is it from these works to Chris Ofili's The Holy Virgin Mary, a collage painting of a Black Madonna (figure 11). This is the image whose inclusion in the Brooklyn Museum's 1999 Sensation show provoked such indignation in certain quarters. Like so many Renaissance Madonnas, Ofili's painting depicts Mary with an exposed breast. Here, however, that breast is stylized in the form of an applied clump of shellacked and decoratively beaded elephant dung: a most material signifier of the material world. Ofili, who was born in England to Nigerian parents, has said that the use of elephant dung in his work functions, among other ways, as a cultural reference to Africa and, in this case, specifically as an organic African symbol of fertility. Two other clumps of dung, one with beads spelling out "Virgin" and the other "Mary," serve as supports for this imposing, glitter-bejeweled, gold and black and azure canvas. These dung balls are, Ofili has explained, "a way of raising the paintings up from the ground and giving them a feeling that they've come from the earth rather than simply being hung on a wall.""58 Dung, of course, is also the color of the earth, and its signature use throughout Ofili's work invites comparisons with Serrano's palette of chromatic vital fluids. Hovering about Ofili's Madonna are numerous putti-like shapes, which a closer inspection of the canvas reveals to be butterflied clippings of rear-view female meat shots from sex magazines. Inter- estingly, this overtly pornographic component of The Holy Virgin Mary, though it arguably makes for a yet more scandalous juxtaposi- tion of sacred and profane, received far less play than did the dung in Richard Rambuss 517</page><page sequence="22">Figure 10.

These decorative sexual flourishes, like Ofili's application of the elephant droppings, provocatively materialize Mary, a religious icon typically imbued with an otherworldly purity. Yet after all it was the body of this woman that served as the matrix for Christ's flesh ("he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary, and was made man"), the full humanity of which, as we have seen, is germane to the entire Christian redemptive scheme. Simply put, Jesus gets his body from Mother Mary, who, in Ofili's rendering, though nearly fully clothed, paradoxically bespeaks only body. Just as Crashaw's hypercorporealization of Mary Magdalene in "The Weeper" in effect washes away the psychological (though not, I hope I have shown, all the spiritual) dimensions of contrition, Ofili flattens out the inner life of the Blessed Virgin, leaving his represen- tation devoid of all the usual Marian subjectivity effects (wonder, nurturance, foreboding of sorrows to come). Here even Mary's hair and dress are figured, the artist himself informs us, as a composite of "vaginal shapes."59 The surrealist stylization of the Madonna's body into an assemblage of labial parts makes for an interesting counter- point to the confrontational naturalism of the dung, even as these vaginal shapes provide a painterly echo of the crotch-shot magazine cut-outs angelically fluttering about the canvas. Although then New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani seems to have missed these details, having eyes only for the excremental, he immediately branded the work an act of "Catholic bashing." Notwithstanding Ofili's declara- tions of his own Catholicism, this former altar boy's painting was similarly received in many quarters not merely as provocative or tasteless, but as a religious hate crime.60 Like Serrano's immersion photographs, Ofili's icon-like Holy Vir- gin Mary stages a brash counterpoint between the sublimity of the artist's subject and the baseness of his raw representational materials. In both cases, the ultimate rendering of the sacred subject turns out to be disarmingly beautiful, this despite-or really, one has to say, because of-those materials, whether dung, smut, blood, or piss. Even so, why should religious art always be beautiful, or be simply beautiful? Georges Bataille's Erotism, an ecstatic meditation on the multiple cross-affiliations of religion and eroticism in their most heightened registers-"sacred eroticism" he calls it-treats a host of aversive devotional affects, including embarrassment, abjection, and nausea. Recognizing that "the realm of sacred things is composed of the pure and the impure," Bataille conceives of a devotion that encompasses veneration and repugnance, dread and desire, shock Richard Rambuss 519</page><page sequence="24">and bliss, in ever shifting and unequal measures.6' There are places within the sacred, he implies, that beauty, serenity, and pacific reverence will never get us. Indeed, it seems in Bataille that the longed-for swoon comes most often by way of dread and sometimes even disgust. In Christianity, he finds, "terror and nausea are a prelude to bursts of burning spiritual activity." "Ecstasy begins," he continues, "where horror is sloughed off."62 It is as though Bataille had been reading the metaphysicals. IV. In reading Crashaw, Serrano, and Ofili within Christianity's own theological and aesthetic canons, I am not seeking to tame their improprieties, or to reduce their hypersemantic religious representa- tions to a single, devout meaning. Critics have been right, I think, to perceive Crashaw's conceits as an affront to decorum. Nor is the response of those viewers who find Piss Christ shocking, abhorrent, or sacrilegious wholly indefensible. If Serrano did not mean to provoke, he would not have titled the image as he did. Giuliani may even be correct in ascertaining an element of religious satire in The Holy Virgin Mary, given Ofili's claim that his pornographicized Virgin is, among other things, an exaggerated send-up of how Renaissance Madonnas served as "an excuse for pornography in the homes of these holy priests and Godfearers"-a burlesque, that is, of what Deborah Shuger, in a very different context, has dubbed "hagioporn."63 Indeed, Ofili's painting, with its bared female breast signifying both erotically and maternally, is no less polysemous than Serrano's Piss Christ. How, for instance, does blackness function in The Holy Virgin Mary? Although this matter has been left mostly unspoken in debate about the work, no doubt the controversy is heightened by its racial context. Does Ofili's painting appropriate Mary (and by extension Christianity) for a multicultural aesthetic? Is Ofili's Black Madonna an attempt to conjoin the artist's Anglo-Catholic and African identi- ties in an act of cultural translation? Or does this iconic image exist in a more ambivalent and irreverent relation to identity politics and the aesthetics it demands?64 Subtending these questions, of course, are the overlapping discourses of race and sexuality and how we see Ofili here exploiting them. Is Ofili's pornographic Madonna a parodic hyperbolization of mythologies of exaggerated black sexuality? And if so-that is, if this is yet another texture of this image-from whence in this particular case is the artist deriving those myths? Given that 520 Sacred Subjects</page><page sequence="25">Olifi has cited "the way black females are talked about in contempo- rary gansta rap" as a "starting point" for The Holy Virgin Mary, the work's satiric purview may in fact encompass more than just religious hypocrisy.65 It should be clear, then, that it is not my aim here to diminish the shock value of these religious representations, or any of the value of shock value. I am also not suggesting that the metaphysical conceits of each of these metaphysicals are metaphysical in precisely the same way or to all the same ends. In so saying, I mean to recognize more than the historical and formal differences between seventeenth- century lyric poetry and late twentieth-century photography and painting. I also mean that there is little discernible irony in the passionate exorbitance of Crashaw's rococo devotion. That is one reason, I suspect, why those who would champion, or at least defend, the shock art of Serrano and Ofili might still recoil from an encounter with this early modern metaphysical. Perhaps there is something so discomfiting, even offensive about the sacred that we can now find it palatable only when its invocation comes at least partially diluted, whether by irony, satire, or ambivalence. Crashaw's devotional ex- pression lacks such qualifiers and, even though it is not literally derived from piss and dung, it may be too much for us to stomach. What Crashaw, Serrano, and Ofili do share in common is that much of the censure they each have been accorded derives from the sense that that there is simply too much of the body and the bodily, figuratively or literally, in their sacred subjects. (Or, conversely, perhaps not enough body, not enough membrane or skin to cover over and seal in what, as it passes outward from the body's inside, defiles.) Yet the perverseness of their excremental renderings of Christ and Mary, of the divine, needs to be contextualized, I believe, in terms of Christianity's own (orthodox) perversities. The prospect of Jesus defecating may have convulsed Freud's neurotic Wolf Man, but the Savior himself said, "Whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly, and is cast out into draught" (Matthew 15:17).66 Everything that is eaten will pass through the body's sewers. Again, if so for us, then so too for him. Here we might look to Aquinas, whose "Treatise on the Incarnation" in his Summa Theologica emphatically insists that Christ assumed "a real body," "not a heavenly, but a carnal and earthly body," one that is "subject to human infirmities and defects ... to wit, death, hunger, thirst, and the like."'67 Aquinas's "and the like" does not specify what afterwards naturally followed every time that Christ ate and drank, but it may be surmised by inference Richard Rambuss 521</page><page sequence="26">from the belief that the body of Jesus essentially functioned like the body of Adam did before the fall. (Jesus, 1 Corinthians 15:45-47 tells us, is the Second Adam.) Elsewhere in the Summa, Aquinas rejects the claim that in the state of innocence humans would have con- sumed only what they needed, without superfluity, "as implying that there would have been no fecal matter" in Eden. According to Aquinas, the prelapsarian Adam did indeed defecate, but he (and presumably Christ as well) did so without indecency, in a way "so disposed by God as to be decorous and suitable to the state." 68 Aquinas likewise implies that the spotless Virgin Mary must have menstruated, if only to have been able to supply the female "seed," the menstruum, necessary for the conception of the Christ Child, for the fabrication of his human form, which derived, he asserts, "from her purest blood.'"69 Crashaw's Passion epigrams, Serrano's Piss Christ, and Ofili's The Holy Virgin Mary circumfuse the sacred-just as does Christianity's pivotal doctrinal tenet, the Incarnation-with the human, marking a place where dung and the divine are and are not opposites. God's "all-embracing birth" as human, proclaims Crashaw, "Lifts earth to heaven, stoops heav'n to earth."70 Finally, I would say that that these works show us that the signal events of an Incarnational Christianity-events like the Nativity, Christ's Circumcision, and the Passion-demand a metaphysical poetics for their rendering, for their entrance into representation, whether as text or image. I suspect that this may be why Milton, whom Johnson treats as trying on the metaphysical style early in his career and then thereafter disdaining it, cannot compose a poem on Jesus' Crucifixion.71 Milton endeavors to do so in "The Passion," but the work breaks off before the poet has to bring the Son of God to the cross. Remarkably, Milton publishes "The Passion" in his 1645 Poems as unfinished. And seemingly unfinishable, since his poetry never fully returns to the scene of the Passion, a palpably corporeal spectacle that was ever so stimulative-devotionally, poetically, even amorously-to the metaphysicals and to Crashaw especially. Rendering the Passion, as the metaphysicals teach us, is an expressive exercise in paradox, even contradiction, one which, like Empson's seventh and highest form of ambiguity, forces together the incompatible. The scene of the one who is both the Son of God and the Son of Man naked and wounded on the cross is a switch point in the traffic between the sacred and the profane, between reverence and repugnance. Indeed, disgust may be the most significant of all metaphysical affects. Finally, I would surmise that what lies at the 522 Sacred Subjects</page><page sequence="27">core of the hatred accorded Crashaw, Serrano, and Ofili is an unacknowledged, or rarely acknowledged, phobia-fear and loathing both-for the matter of the Incarnation itself. This would be the fear of confronting the Other-that is, the ultimate Other, God-and finding this Other altogether not other enough from us. Ecce homo.

Crashaw is similarly excluded from Michael Payne's and John Hunter's Renaissance Literature: An Anthology (Malden, MA: Blackwell, 2003). 21 Swinburne, for instance, notwithstanding his protests about Crashaw's extreme perversity of style and spirit, still ranks the poet among the authors whom he maintains should continue to be read. See Swinburne's 24 January 1886 "Letter to Editor," in Pall Mall Gazette, 2, as quoted from Roberts and Roberts, "Crashavian Criticism," 14. 22 There have been a few notable, if brief, exceptions. See, in particular, the luminous account of Crashaw's haptic poetics in Susan Stewart's Poetry and the Fate of the Senses (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Press, 2002), 181-90. See also Jonathan Sawday's The Body Emblazoned: Dissection and the Human Body in Renaissance Culture (London: Routledge, 1995), which considers Crashaw's orificial Christ as "a quiveringly vulnerable locus of quasi-erotic metamorphosis" (119-20). Sadway's treatment of Crashaw (as well as the other metaphysicals) tends, however, to reduce their metaphysicality to mere physicality, to a discourse on the body: "[W]hat literary critics used to term 'metaphysical' writing," he proposes "should, more properly, be termed simply the writing of physicality" (86-87). This strikes me as little more than a revalencing of the charge levied against Crashaw by those critics who have been most hostile to him; that is, there is too much body in Crashaw's religious writing, too much body and not enough soul. Once that was a bad thing, but now, in the midst of an efflorescence of critical interest in the body, Sadway points to the heightened corporeality of Crashaw's verse as a matter of interest. 23 Austin Warren thus complains: "From his poem, Crashaw has excluded the story, the character, the psychology, and the moral. Mary has no part in her poem; it should not be called 'The Weeper,' but 'Tears."' See Richard Crashaw: A Study in Baroque Sensibility (Ann Arbor: Univ. of Michigan Press, 1939), 127. 24 Crashaw expounds a similarly visceral conceit on the Milky Way as the path into God's presence in one of his several epigrams on the Holy Innocents in Steps to the Temple (London, 1646), titled "To the Infant Martyrs": Go smiling souls, your new built cages break, In heav'n you'll learn to sing ere here to speak, Nor let the milky fonts that bathe your thirst, Be your delay; The place that calls you hence, is at the worst Milk all the way. 25 Adams, 66-67. Adams, whose reading of these stanzas provides a launching point for my own, is worth citing at length here: "Crashaw seems to be trying to convey the idea of intimacy in the most intimate terms available to earthly creatures. The underlying metaphor is perhaps that which calls tears the milk of human kindness; the edible aspects of the image are extended from its center, not imposed from without. The fact that there is something slightly nauseating about the terms of this extension is not wholly apart from Crashaw's intent; for it is precisely human kindness he is describing, hence incommensurate with the divine nature" (66-67). On this last point, however, I part company with Adams. As I will later be arguing at length here, the Incarnation, the doctrinal core of Christianity, enacts just such a sympathetic commensurability between human nature and the divine. 26 Wallerstein, 103.

This is the effect that Herbert plays with and then deliberately forestalls .... [Herbert] never betrayed his own assertion that to weep 'a floud of tears' is not essential to repentance, nor did he ever suggest that God esteems us on account of our tears or our contrition" (ELH 46 [1979]: 244-45).

But evidently the main meaning, sustained by the pun, is 'and so discharge thy soft bowels'; it is a brave use of that Biblical metaphor or physiological truth, according to which the bowels are made active by sympathy and are the seat of compassion" (223).

All the shapes of her dress and her hair are vaginal shapes, flowery. I was going to the National Gallery Sainsbury Wing and looking at Van Eyck's paintings of mother and child. I just wanted the image of the breast really. The exposed breast is hinting at motherhood but those images are very sexually charged" (87). 60 Arthur C.

It's quite important that it's a Black Madonna. I concentrated more on bumshots and rear crotch shots in a way, playing with the sexuality of the Holy Virgin Mary, wanting to really pull it right up to the forefront. Actually, what I noticed in a lot of black porn mags is that there were quite a lot of rear shots. Everything's really on display" (quoted from Eshun, 87). 66 Sigmund Freud, "From the History of an Infantile Neurosis," The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud, ed. James Strachey, 24 vols. (London: Hogarth Press, 1955), 17:7-122. As Freud narrates it, one of the first questions that the Wolf Man, who shared the same birthday with Christ, asked his religiously devout nanny was "whether Christ had had a behind too." 528 Sacred Subjects</page><page sequence="33">His Nanya informed him that he had been a god and also a man. As a man he had had and done all the same things as other men. This did not satisfy him at all, but he succeeded in finding consolation of his own by saying to himself that the behind is really only a continuation of the legs. But hardly had he pacified his dread of having to humiliate the sacred figure, when it flared up again as the further question arose whether Christ used to shit too. He did not venture to put this question to his pious Nanya, but he himself found a way out, and she could not have shown him a better. Since Christ had made wine out of nothing, he could have made food into nothing and in this way have avoided defaecating.

Aquinas's account of the bowel movements of prelapsarian Adam invites comparison with Augustine's discursus on the mechanics of prelapsarian Adam's erections and what sexuality would have been like if it were not for the Fall. In book 14 of The City of God (ed. David Knowles [Penguin: Harmondsworth, 1972]), Augustine adamantly disavows the notion that there would have been no sexual congress between the first couple had they not sinned. Adam and Eve were from the beginning sexed-and sexual. The difference is that before the Fall, Adam's erections were fully subject to the bidding of his will: We move our hands and feet to perform their special functions, when we so will; this involves no reluctance on their part, and the movements are performed with all the ease we observe in our own case and in that of others. ... Then why should we not believe that the sexual organs could have been the obedient servants of mankind, at the bidding of the will, in the same way as the other, if there had been no lust, which came in as the retribution for the sin of disobedience? (The City of God, 585 [book 14, chapter 23]) With erectility firmly under conscious control and not subject to seizures of desire and lust, Adamic sexuality would no more be a matter for shame than were (as Aquinas has it) the "decorous" movements of the first man's bowels. And again as was the case for the unfallen Adam, so too for the Second Adam, Christ-whose sexual member, as illustrated by the picture gallery of Leo Steinberg's still shocking The Sexuality of Christ, was in fact fully functioning in the Renaissance religious imagination. See 231-34 of the revised second edition of Steinberg's book (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Press, 1996), for his consideration of Augustine and Edenic sexuality. See also Michel Foucault's "Sexuality and Solitude," in Foucault, Religion and Culture, ed. Jeremy R. Carrette (New York: Routledge, 1999), esp.185-86. "The famous gesture of Adam covering his genitals with a fig leaf," writes Foucault, "is, according to Augustine, due not to the simple fact that Adam was ashamed of their presence but to the fact that his sexual organs were moving by themselves without his consent" (186).

Milton does, of course, compose a hymn on the Nativity. But, as I have argued elsewhere (Closet Devotions, 134), that poem consistently eschews the more corporeal dimensions of the event, even to the point of omitting any scene of the Christchild at his mother's breast, a staple of Nativity iconography. 530 Sacred Subjects</page></plain_text>
