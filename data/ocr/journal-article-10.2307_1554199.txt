<plain_text><page sequence="1">and elsewhere, and their own inheritance from De Wint and Cox, surely led them in this direction, even if the inherent dynamic of the medium itself did not. There are moments in this survey when we are tempted to dismiss large areas of the subject as lifeless and deriv- ative-moments like William Leighton Leitch's Kil- churn Castle of 1865 (no. 56) andJames Aumonier's In a Gloucestershire Wood of 1883 (no. Ioo)-and there is a tendency to think that any fairly crisply finished work of the later decades of the century is aesthetically inter- esting; Joseph Knight's Conway, also of 1883 (no. IoI), for instance, is railway-carriage art, as are several others of the later items in the show. Yet at the very end of the survey, a remarkable point is well made by the inclusion of William Callow's Pere Lachaise Cemetery (no. 125) done in 1905 when the artist was ninety-three: this, as the catalogue entry states, "recalls the watercolor sketches of Bonington and Muller, watercolor as it was practised in the days when Callow was starting his ca- reer, yet it did not seem out of place with contempo- rary watercolors by John Singer Sargent or Philip Wil- son Steer." If such is the all-encompassing potential of the medium, it is hardly possible to speak of a clear de- velopment; only of a number of technical possibilities pushed, at different times, to their limits. Often they merge into one another, coexist in the same work, and recreate anew the forms of earlier epochs. Because it has been practiced so universally, water- color has always been liable to be judged by its weaker exponents. The later nineteenth century was particu- larly rich in bad or mediocre professionals, for whom the old romantic subject matter was no longer valid, but who could not replace it with anything more stimulat- ing. For the most part, the cottage gardens and shady woodland dells were selected with considerable care, and the result is that they retain their conviction and their dignity as art. The Thatched Cottage with Barn of I88I byJohn Fulleylove (no. 96) almost prompts an ob- jection, it is so unimaginatively the same sort of subject that Hills and De Wint studied in the I820S. But a beach scene of I882 by William Fettes Douglas (no. 97) recalls Linnell with complete confidence in its own distinctive merit. There is then a series of underlying antitheses-be- tween old and new, between tight and free, between Pre-Raphaelite and "atmospheric"-which are reflected to some extent in the way the two authors of the book have divided their work: Wilcox on the "old masters" of the school, and on those bastions of the establish- ment, the Watercolour Societies; Newall on Ruskin and his influence, and on the changes in the later part of the century. The counterbalancing effect of these two approaches helps to impose a sense of form on the period that otherwise it would certainly lack: the suc- cession of works (on the whole, fairly well reproduced in this volume) reflects the very heterogeneous nature of watercolor in these decades and runs the risk of look- ing like a mere sequence of illustrations of the styles of the different artists and the aesthetic points of view they embraced. All these details are admirably explained in the essays, and in the end it has to be said that, whether or not they coalesce as a coherent and comprehensible argument, the watercolors themselves are for the most part splendid, and bear witness to the extraordinary, vivid, and vital recrudescence of a noble tradition.

The recent nod of approval by the Clinton administra- tion to designate the former home and studio of Tho- mas Cole (I80I-I848) in Catskill, New York, as a his- toric site administered by the National Park Service is icing on the cake for the rehabilitation of the reputation of the Hudson River School of American landscape painting. Exhibitions and books devoted to the works [ 74 ]</page><page sequence="2">of this school, as well as the prices that these works now command, are tangible evidence of the revival of inter- est in Cole and his followers that has gathered steam in the last few decades. The two exhibitions under review bear witness to the "coattails effect" (albeit a delayed one), in which the drawings of a certain period or artist are brought into the scholarly discourse and public eye in the wake of growing attention to the paintings. The first of these exhibitions, Thomas Cole. Drawn to Nature, was held at the Albany Institute of History &amp; Art, an institution that has itself undergone somewhat of a resurrection in recent memory. After a relatively dormant period during which the museum was best known by the locals for its possession of two musty Egyptian mummies rather than for its comprehensive collection of regional art, artifacts, and historical docu- ments, the Institute is now a strong cultural and educa- tional force in the state capital. The exhibition of over 100 items was a departure from the usual monographic show in that it provided a glimpse of the artist as a bearer and reflector of culture, rather than presenting a selection of his most attractive productions. The mu- seum drew primarily from its own extensive holdings of Cole works and memorabilia. (Of the lenders, the De- troit Institute of Arts has the largest group of works on paper.) In addition to the drawings and sketchbooks, on display were paintings, a marble bust of the artist, pho- tographs, letters, lectures, as well as botanical, fossil, and rock specimens collected by Cole, a phrenological chart, and even a phrenology head. The accompanying catalogue is generously illustrated and includes a useful annotated checklist of the Thomas Cole Collections at the Institute. In keeping with the exhibition's aim to present Cole as imbedded in a certain time and place, the material was arranged thematically rather than chronologically; for example, the first two sections had the ambitious ti- tles "The Course of the American Empire" and "Sci- ence, Social Order, and Nature; the Shape of Progress." The guest curator, Christine Robinson, wrote brief in- troductions to the corresponding sections in the cata- logue that are designed to situate the objects within a historical and/or intellectual framework. Cole's letters, essays, and lectures yield some interesting insights; while many articulate the aesthetic ideals for which he is known, others disclose his alarming, but not surpris- ing views on larger social issues that would be consid- ered "politically incorrect" today. For instance, an un- dated essay (no. 63) reveals that he subscribed to the phrenological theories that were generally used by whites of European descent to justify slavery. The three essays preceding the catalogue proper re- lated Cole to American nineteenth-century social, eco- nomic, and intellectual currents as well, and showed "the father of the Hudson River School of painting" to be a more complex figure than he has previously been portrayed. John R. Stilgoe's essay "Walking Seer: Cole as Pedestrian Spectator" emphasizes Cole's particular way of seeing; the artist took his sketchbook or paint- box (examples of both are in the exhibition) and ven- tured into the wilderness, on foot, braving the ele- ments, and in so doing, becoming a nonintrusive part of the landscape he revered-this, at a time when most traveled on horseback and railroads were under con- struction. The artist is quoted in Stilgoe's essay: "I took a walk, last evening, up the valley of the Catskill, where they are now constructing the railroad . . . This was once my favourite walk; but now the charm of solitude and quietness is gone. It is, however, still lovely: man cannot remove its craggy hills, or well destroy all its rock-rooted trees: the rapid stream will also have its course" (p. I7). Stilgoe places Cole in the same ambi- ent as Thoreau, who warned against man's intervention with nature, and suggests that, like Thoreau, Cole be- lieved that.the act of walking in the American landscape was an experience that bestowed a certain nobility on its practitioners. However, despite his predominantly critical attitude toward progress expressed in his writings and in his paintings, such as The Course of the Empire series, Cole was not above sacrificing his principles to obtain an im- portant commission, as Robinson points out in the cat- alogue. Several small sketches (nos. I9-22), first ideas for the new decoration of the Merchant's Exchange in New York City, are (naturally) on the subject of Com- merce; the artist's notes on the proposed paintings in- cluded the themes of "Commerce Clothing the Naked Savage &amp; Introducing Agricultural Implements," "Com- merce Introducing Literature," and "Commerce Lead- ing the Four Quarters of the World to the Temple of [75 ]</page><page sequence="3">ii ~~~~~~~~~~~~~?* frE * . . ??

Albany Institute of History &amp; Art. Peace." The irony of this bow to economic expediency is that Cole did not receive the commission (p. 87, n. 20). Cole's close-up, "pedestrian" way of experiencing nature shows through more clearly in his drawings than in the paintings, many of which are overlaid with ro- mantic, didactic, or allegorical overtones.1 His trees are a case in point. Trees resembling an early (I823) pencil study of a dead chestnut tree (no. 25; Fig. i) figure in numerous painted compositions, such as Sunny Morning on the Hudson River of 1827 (Museum of Fine Arts, Boston).2 In the final works, the chestnut has been in- fused with a dramatic aspect, a la Salvator Rosa. For ex- ample, in the Boston landscape, this tree, at the far left, has been tilted on a forty-five degree angle, has had its branches reduced in number and one limb painted to look as if a strong wind had ripped it open, exposing the raw pink wood. In the other paintings, the same lean- ing tree, with its peeling bark and bare branches, usu- ally appears prominently at the left or near the center and is depicted in various states of decay. Thus Cole took this sketch of an innocuous chestnut tree and transformed it into a vanitas motif.3 In the catalogue, Robinson was able to connect many of the Institute's drawn landscape views to Cole's paint- ings, or to identify the Hudson River locale depicted. Although the tree studies, such as the Chestnut cited above, do not always have a one-to-one relationship with the finished works, a similar investigation of their role in the final product might yield interesting results. For example, it would be useful to know the species of the trees depicted, since their identity can add to the iconography of the paintings in which they appear. Take the early pencil drawing of an old oak tree with bare branches-probably done in the same year as the Chestnut study-that is simply entitled "Tree" (no. 97; Fig. 2). Oaks appear in many of the artist's works, in- cluding two religious subjects; at left in the Landscape, The Vesper Hymn; An Italian Twilight of 1841 (Toledo Museum of Art) and in the Angels Ministering to Christ in the Wilderness of 1843 (Worcester Art Museum), where Christ leans against the tree for support. This tree species also figures in the earlier, pendant paintings in the Corcoran Gallery of Art, Washington, The Depar- ture and The Return of 1837. Closest to the pencil study, with its solid trunk and gnarled, twisting branches, is the central tree in The Return, although the left half of the tree looks as if it had been shorn off during a storm. (Significantly, in The Departure, which thematically pre- cedes its pendant, the trees are intact.) The oak as a symbol of strength or of spiritual conversion-here, perhaps, of those who spoil nature in the name of progress-cannot have escaped Cole, as he accorded it such a prominent position; along with the conspicuous torn limb on the tree at the right framing the same composition, the maimed oak in The Return should be [76 ]</page><page sequence="4">interpreted as another reminder of the transiency of human life.4 On another level, the use and reuse of these two early tree studies, and of the hundreds of oth- ers that survive, reveal the artist's method of preparing a picture; as Howard Merritt has observed, these nature drawings "formed a sort of pictorial diary,"5 to which Cole turned again and again for his finished works. In his essay, "On the Outside Looking In: Thomas Cole as a Critic of American Culture," Ellwood C. Parry III sought to dispel myths that have obscured Cole's actual contribution to the Hudson River school of painting. The author challenges the iconic image of Cole as the principal founder of the new landscape style who expressed in images and words the inchoate yearn- ing of his countrymen for an American Arcadia, and suggests that Cole's American-ness has been overesti- mated. Besides the obvious facts that the artist was born in England, emigrated to America at the age of eigh- teen, only took out naturalization papers sixteen years after his arrival, and had little formal art training, the au- thor cites as evidence of his "outsider status" Cole's re- current financial problems that, contrary to the widely held belief, did not allow him to bask in his early recog- nition in 1825 as an exponent of a new style from that time up until the end of his career. Moreover, Cole's private letters and behavior reveal that the artist never felt completely at ease in social situations in which his talents might be measured against those of others; he seems to have avoided contact with New York artists and other more famous contemporaries, such as James Fenimore Cooper, even though the latter had commis- sioned a painting from him. Cole had a distaste for ur- ban life and often asked Asher Durand to run errands for him in New York City. Drawings that depict soli- tary figures atop rocky precipices reinforce this inter- pretation (no. 72; and figs. I, 2 on p. 29; Detroit Insti- tute of Arts and New-York Historical Society). Parry also discredits the notion that Cole was a ma- jor player in the establishment of the National Academy of Design in 1826 (only one year after his "discovery"), since this role would have required a resourcefulness and confidence that does not square with what is now known of Cole's activities and thoughts at that time.6 Of his famous lecture "Essay on American Scenery" at the American Lyceum Society in New York City on 8 Figure 2 THOMAS COLE. Study of an Oak Tree. Albany Institute of History &amp; Art. May 835, Cole lamented in his journal that "in conse- quence of embarrassment I read very badly" (p. 32). On the other hand, Parry proposes that Cole's ten- dency to seek solitude may actually have contributed to his introducing and pursuing a "new category of aes- thetic experience and enjoyment in America," and that, as a foreigner, he did not take the American wilderness for granted. At a time when his neighbors were culti- vating gardens, he had more in common with botanists, ornithologists, and geologists who were avidly record- ing the indigenous flora and fauna, as evidenced by his herbarium book (no. 42), finished by Frederick E. Church, and a fossil and rock collection (no. 46). Of course, Cole's specimens were collected mostly in the form of drawings, such as the tree studies cited above, which he later incorporated into his finished composi- tions. Frances F. Dunwell, in her essay "Thomas Cole: In- spiration for the Environmental Movement," charac- terizes Cole as a pioneer in the nascent preservationist movement in this country. In keeping with Romantic philosophy of the early nineteenth century, as espoused by European writers Sir Walter Scott and Jean-Jacques Rousseau and expressed visually by artists such as Turner in England and Friedrich in Germany, Cole as- [77]</page><page sequence="5">sociated unspoiled nature with virtue. Authors James Fenimore Cooper and Washington Irving adapted this aesthetic to the American scene. Books like the Home Book of the Picturesque, which consisted of engravings based on paintings by Cole, Durand, Cropsey, Church, and others, not only contributed to the fame of the artists, but also popularized the taste for American scenery. This was the age of the public park movement, when towns planted maples and elms along their main thoroughfares, and homes were built out of local mate- rials in order to blend into their surroundings. Yellow- stone, America's first national park, was created in 1872 as a result of this movement. (One cannot help think- ing that Cole would have been gratified to see his Catskill homestead thus honored as a historic land- mark.) Master Drawings of the Hudson River School, a joint venture of The Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Gallery Association of New York State, traveled to sev- eral museums in the New York area from 1993 to 1995. The organizers drew mostly on the Metropolitan Mu- seum's extensive holdings of American drawings, which are shown on an informal, rotating basis in the Luce Gallery of the American Wing. The goal of the present exhibition was to amplify and give greater exposure to this important part of the collection, as well as to sup- plement it with loans from regional museums, when possible.7 Since the show was on tour for two years, dif- ferent works were necessarily chosen for different venues. Accompanying the exhibition is a modest pam- phlet with an essay by Tracie Felker that surveys the School's achievements in drawing. This reviewer saw the drawings at The Hyde Col- lection, Glens Falls-an appropriate venue as the mu- seum is in the heart of the landscape from which these artists drew their inspiration. (The Hyde is unusual among collections formed by nineteenth-century in- dustrialists in that The Hyde mansion is directly adja- cent to the still-operating paper company.) In addition to those from the Metropolitan, loans came from the Albany Institute of History &amp; Art, including the magnificent anthropomorphic pen-and-ink tree study by Thomas Cole, From Nature / May 20th 1823 (on the cover of the Drawn to Nature catalogue); the New-York Historical Society, with works by Cole's successor as leader of the new style, Asher B. Durand (the Society owns most of his surviving drawings); and Vassar, with a Sanford Gifford sketchbook and a landscape by William M. Hart in graphite with white bodycolor on brown paper-looking somewhat inferior to Frederick E. Church's splendid examples in this technique. (The Churches from the Cooper-Hewitt Museum, while il- lustrated in the pamphlet, were unfortunately not lent to The Hyde.) From the Metropolitan Museum, where the exhibi- tion opened in October of 1993, there were highly finished watercolors by William Guy Wall, Samuel Coleman (a panoramic view), John William Hill, and William Trost Richards, whose Moonlight on Mount Lafayette, New Hampshire of 1873 executed in his char- acteristically tight, almost miniaturist style was quite evocative. The handling ofJasper Cropsey's earlier wa- tercolor of Niagara Falls (I856) looked freer in compar- ison. Among the lesser-known landscapists of the period, Johann Herman Carmiencke was represented with a quintessential Hudson river scene, with the land slop- ing down to the water's edge, boats on the river, and distant mountains. The artist's inscription, Hyde Park Aug. 1856 / Northern view from the property of Langdon Esq, reflects the American preoccupation with depict- ing specific sites, which stems from the eighteenth-cen- tury tradition of topographical drawings and of early American portraiture, examples of which often include a view of the sitter's property. This penchant for geo- graphical accuracy coexisted with the landscape trend exemplified by Cole (in some but not all of his paint- ings) and Church, who infused their more universalis- tic works with metaphorical meaning in order to ele- vate the genre to heights hitherto reserved for history painting. Inevitably, the freshest examples in a show of land- scape drawings are the studies done from life, since they carry the least baggage from a time gone by. Close scrutiny of John W. Casilear's Study of Rocks, Aaron Draper Shattuck's tiny studies of woodland plants, and the five sketchbooks did not go unrewarded. But in this reviewer's opinion, the tree studies won hands down. This is not surprising given that trees were to the Hud- son River School artists what faces and hands are to the [ 78 ]</page><page sequence="6">portraitist. In addition to several of Cole's best sheets from Albany, such as the above-mentioned From Nature and the Button Wood Tree (also in pen and ink), there was from the Metropolitan Museum a superb study of tree roots by Durand in graphite. It was Durand, in fact, who codified many of the practices begun by Cole, in his articles in the New York art journal, The Crayon. He stressed the importance of drawing from nature, prefer- ably in pencil, and suggested the tree as the basic form of nature; if the student learned to draw all the varieties of trees, all other elements of the landscape could be mastered.8 These principles were adhered to by later artists, such as John F. Kensett in his almost calligraphic Birch Tree, Niagara of 185o and Jervis McEntee in his Study of Trees on gray paper of I869 (both in the Met- ropolitan Museum). Although the relatively unfamiliar Paul Weber, David Johnson, James David Smillie, and William Rickarby Miller of the generation following Cole were represented in the exhibition, one major artist who is generally claimed for the School was not; namely, George Inness. Inness seems to have made (or kept) fewer preliminary sketches for his paintings, although there are by his hand several finished charcoal drawings and watercolors.9 The success and varied approaches of these two shows-the first providing an in-depth examination of a major figure of the Hudson River School and the sec- ond giving greater exposure to fine works on paper by the many artists associated with this indigenous style of landscape painting--should encourage curators of the major and regional collections to go through their solander boxes of American drawings in order to mount exhibitions that would explore the role of drawing in artistic developments of the United States. Among the topics that beg further investigation are: the topograph- ical and naturalist traditions; early portrait drawings, es- pecially in pastel; and American drawing academies and sketch clubs, particularly those for women.

Other works in which this tree appears in various guises are: Lake with Dead Trees (Catskill) of I825 (Allen Memorial Art Museum, Oberlin College); View of the Featherstonhaugh Es- tate near Duanesburg, New York of 1826 (private collection); The Woodchopper, Lake Featherstonhaugh of 1826 (Elizabeth Holmes Fisher Gallery, University of Southern California, Los Angeles); St. John in the Wilderness of 1827 (Wadsworth Atheneum, Hartford); Autumn Landscape of 1827 (private collection); Landscape with Tree Trunks of 1828 (Rhode Island School of Design); and the Tornado of 1835 (Corcoran Gallery of Art, Washington). 3. Perhaps it is no accident that Cole chose to depict the chest- nut over and over again in his paintings as it symbolizes in- dependence-a trait that the artist exhibited himself. Could the inclusion of this tree have been intended to indicate his own presence in the landscape? It is significant that such a tree is the most prominent feature on the illusionistic canvas in the background of Cole's portrait by Thomas Seir Cum- mings of about 1826-28, also in Albany (no. 70; repr. on back cover). Moreover, the choice of a dead chestnut as a symbol of decay was inadvertently prophetic since that species was virtually wiped out by a blight after the turn of the century. 4.

The presence in both paintings of the sacred oak, which was the celestial tree of the Druids and whose fruit, the acorn, was a symbol of fecundity and im- mortality, further emphasizes the series' theme of the cycle of life and death. 5.

As Parry notes, the artist's name is absent from the list of those attending the early organizational meetings in New York City, and he was only later elected to the Academy's advisory council. He was, however, more active in the less politically charged New-York Sketch Club. 7.

Exhibition catalogue by Elizabeth Llewellyn and Cristiana Romalli, with an introduction by Mario Di Giampaolo, 1992 (London, Courtauld Institute Galleries). Unpag- inated, 89 black and white illus. A collaborative effort between Sotheby's and the Cour- tauld Institute Galleries, Drawing in Bologna was appropri- ately dedicated to Philip Pouncey, who had himself sug- gested a number of the attributions for the drawings on view, and who had, with unassailable integrity, navigated the sometimes treacherous currents that flow between scholarship and the art market. The sheets were culled predominantly from private collections; some have been floating through the art market, some are in private hands, and others are in collections of near public status, such as the Queen's at Windsor Castle, or that in Christ Church, Oxford. For the most part, the drawings were by artists who worked for a substantial part of their careers in Bologna, although the chance example might have been produced elsewhere, as in the case of Primaticcio's Alexan- der and Campaspe in the Studio of Apelles (no. 45), a modello for Fontainebleau. Mario Di Giampaolo provided a two-page introduction to the modest catalogue in which he describes the pictor- ial culture of Bologna; regrettably, his essay was translated with some sacrifice of precision ("cultura figurativa emil- iana" became "Emilian painting," for example). As he points out, during the sixteenth century, Bologna was a crossroads of artistic "influences," a word that is so fre- quently employed in the entries by Elizabeth Llewellyn and Cristiana Romalli that it seems to drive the intellectual apparatus of the entire catalogue. It is questionable whether the nexus of influences is the most intriguing story these drawings have to tell, or what insight is gained via the convention of chopping art history into neat blocks of one century. Reducing the message of the catalogue to its essence, artists in Bologna were, with rare exceptions, "influenced" until late in the century, when, with the suc- cess of the Carracci, they became "influential" themselves. Most of the drawings are known to specialists, although a handful had not been published. Among these, the most important are Niccolo dell'Abate's Hercules and the Nemean Lion (no. I), preparatory for the Sala dei Concerti in the Palazzo Poggi, and Annibale Carracci's pair of costumed figures, probably saints (no. 13), sketched for a painting not yet recognized but clearly from the early I58os and contemporary with his work in the Palazzo Fava (not Palazzo Poggi, as the entry states). Little known is the rare Nosadella study for the Annunciation in The Art Museum, Princeton University (no. 37). Several artists are gener- ously represented with groups of four or five drawings: Denys Calvaert, Annibale Carracci, Bartolomeo Cesi, Pietro Faccini, Bartolomeo Passerotti, and Orazio Sam- machini. Other names are curiously absent: Amico Asper- tini, Francesco Francia, Ercole Procaccini, and the elusive Bernardino Baldi, who opened a life-drawing academy frequented by, among others, the young Carracci. The examples range from spectacular and well-known sheets such as Pellegrino Tibaldi's study for the Poggi chapel (no. 60) to tenuous attributions such as the Polyphe- mus (no. 59) given to the same master; the latter has the stiff mechanical look of a copy, and is lacking the bold pro- jection and feeling of volume characteristic of Tibaldi. One can also quibble with a few perhaps hasty observa- tions recorded by the authors, as those for Calvaert's figure study (no. 7), said to have been drawn from a "studio model posed so that the artist could study the fall of drap- ery and the foreshortening of a figure intended to be seen from below." It is difficult to imagine how, in a Newton- ian universe, drapery could fall as it does in Calvaert's de- piction, or how a model could balance himself for more than a few seconds with only the back of his heel on the ground. More likely, the figure was adapted from a [ 80 ]</page></plain_text>
