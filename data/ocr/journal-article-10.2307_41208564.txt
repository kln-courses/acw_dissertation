<plain_text><page sequence="1">The New Nature Poetry ROBERT LANGBAUM HAS HAPPENED TO NATURE POETRY? Ask this question of your up-to-date kind of poetry reader, and you will get a stare of blank amazement. There isn't any, he will mutter, although he will soon concede that there is Robert Frost. If he admires Frost, he will probably assure you that Frost is no mere nature poet, the im- plication being that nature poetry can no longer have serious rele- vance. He will have behind him the authority of critical opinion, of even Joseph Warren Beach, who, in The Concept of Nature in Nineteenth-Century English Poetry, the most thorough study of the subject, says that the very name and concept of nature have virtually disappeared from twentieth-century poetry. Frost himself is not a nature poet, says Beach, since he writes not about nature but about this, that and the other thing in the country. Beach has in mind the philosophical and protoreligious con- cept of nature that flourished in the eighteenth century and was al- ready on its way out in the nineteenth. The religion of nature de- rived from Newton's demonstration that everything from the fall of an apple to the movement of planets is governed by a single law. To people whose Christianity was waning, a nature so orderly seemed to offer new evidence of God's existence and a new source of religious emotion. But the religion of nature was threatened, first, by early nineteenth-century geology, which found in the rocks evi- dence of catastrophes that had wiped out whole species, and finally by Darwin's theory that the evolution of species is governed by a mindless force called natural selection. Under these assaults, nature poetry declined. Swinburne tried to be optimistic about post-Dar- winian nature, and Hardy was definitely pessimistic about it. But О ROBERT LANGBAUM, assistant professor of English at Cornell University, is the author of The Poetry of Experience and many articles on political and lit- erary subjects. His essay-review "The Cry for Culture" appeared in the Winter, 1957-58, issue of The American Scholar. 323</page><page sequence="2">THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR both were being anthropomorphic still, ajt a time when the exciting new concept, the only one that could inspire conviction, was that of the mindlessness of nature, its nonhuman otherness: a concept hav- ing nothing to do with optimism or pessimism. Now it is just this sense of nature that a number of contempo- rary American poets render superbly; so that far from being extinct, nature poetry has enjoyed a revival. It is better than it has been in a long time. I would like, through a few examples from con- temporary American poets, to call attention to the existence and relevance of this new nature poetry. (There has been less of it in England, although there one would talk about Lawrence and Dylan Thomas.) But why, if this poetry is so good, should it be necessary to point out its existence? Because, I think, the term nature poetry has fallen into such disrepute that no one wants to apply it to poems he likes; and because critics who are looking for the eighteenth-century concept of nature will not find it in poems that are precisely trying to rescue nature, as it is in itself, from the outmoded concept. Take as an example of the new sense of nature Wallace Stevens' "The Snow Man," which contrasts the inevitably anthropomorphic human apprehension of a winter landscape with the landscape as it might be apprehended by the mindless "mind" of a snow man. "One must have a mind of winter/. . . And have been cold a long time" not to think Of any misery in the sound of the wind, In the sound of a few leaves, Which is the sound of the land Full of the same wind That is blowing in the same bare place For the listener, who listens in the snow, And, nothing himself, beholds Nothing that is not there and the nothing that is. Or take Marianne Moore's poem about the sea, which she calls "A Grave" to suggest, as I understand it, the unmeaning nullity of the 324</page><page sequence="3">THE NEW NATURE POETRY sea. She tells us in the opening lines that she will render the sea not from the human point of view, but as it is in itself: Man looking into the sea, taking the view from those who have as much right to it as you have to it yourself, it is human nature to stand in the middle of a thing, but you cannot stand in the middle of this; the sea has nothing to give but a well excavated grave. And the poem ends: The wrinkles progress among themselves in a phalanx- beautiful under networks of foam, and fade breathlessly while the sea rustles in and out of the seaweed; the birds swim through the air at top speed, emitting cat- calls as heretofore- the tortoise-shell scourges about the feet of the cliffs, in motion beneath them; and the ocean, under the pulsation of lighthouses and noise of bell-buoys, advances as usual, looking as if it were not that ocean in which dropped things are bound to sink- in which if they turn and twist, it is neither with volition nor consciousness. One might almost suppose for a moment that the ocean has volition and consciousness, but this is a delusion. In the middle of the last century, Ruskin coined the phrase, "pathetic fallacy," which defines among other things the modern reaction against the eighteenth-century style of nature poetry. The pathetic fallacy is the false description that occurs when, under the pressure of strong emotion, the poet projects human feelings into natural objects (Kingsley's "cruel, crawling foam"). Ruskin con- siders the pathetic fallacy justified as long as the distortion is psychologically valid, appropriate to the observer's emotion. Such poetry, in which the emotions are "strong enough to vanquish, partly, the intellect, and make it believe what they choose," can be good poetry of the second order. But in poetry of the first order, like Dante's, "the intellect also rises, till it is strong enough to assert its rule against, or together with, the utmost efforts of the 325</page><page sequence="4">THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR passions; and the whole man stands in an iron glow, white hot, per- haps, but still strong, and in no wise evaporating/' Poetry of the first order retains the "plain and leafy fact" of the primrose, "what- ever and how many soever the associations and passions may be that crowd around it." Not only does Ruskin anticipate Eliot's attack on the "dissociation of sensibility" from thought, but he sets forth the program of the best twentieth-century nature poetry, which de- fines itself precisely by opposing the pathetic fallacy. That is the point of the Stevens and Marianne Moore lines I have quoted. It is the point of Frost's poem, "The Need of Being Versed in Country Things," about a burnt-down farmhouse. The birds fly in and out of the abandoned barn, "Their murmur more like the sigh we sigh/ From too much dwelling on what has been," but their sympathetic response is illusory. "Yet for them the lilac renewed its leaf," we are told, For them there was really nothing sad. But though they rejoiced in the nest they kept, One had to be versed in country things Not to believe the phoebes wept - not to commit the pathetic fallacy. The strategy of the last two lines is like the strategy of Marianne Moore's last two lines; only Frost lets us down so much more gently. In both poems, the in- clination to commit the pathetic fallacy is a sign that the object is loved, as is Stevens' projection into the snow man. But in Stevens and Marianne Moore, the difference between man and nature is wider, more irreconcilable, more dangerous than in Frost. In Frost the life of man weaves so inextricably in and out of nature that it always comes as a surprise to the speaker to discover that they are not identical. And the difference poses no real threat. The percep- tion of it is simply salutary. This makes Frost less radically twen- tieth-century in his sense of nature than Stevens and Marianne Moore. The difference in Frost often defines itself against such domestic considerations as that of utility and ownership. In "Going for Water," the speaker gains an insight into water not as something to be used or owned but as it is in itself; and in "The Wood-Pile," the 3*6</page><page sequence="5">THE NEW NATURE POETRY speaker realizes that the precisely cut and measured cord of fire- wood, unaccountably abandoned "far from a useful fireplace/1 has another use: "To warm the frozen swamp as best it could/ With the slow smokeless burning of decay/' There is a suggestion of danger in the famous "Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening/' where the speaker, who has interrupted his journey homeward and trespassed on another's property to watch the woods fill up with snow, pulls himself away reluctantly: The woods are lovely, dark and deep, But I have promises to keep, And miles to go before I sleep, And miles to go before I sleep. The momentary insight into the nonhuman otherness of nature is salutary, but to prolong it is to seek unconsciousness, individual ex- tinction, before your time. In "Come In/1 the speaker, who comes at evening to the edge of a dark wood, hears thrush music inside, Almost like a call to come in To the dark and lament. But no, I was out for stars: I would not come in. I meant not even if asked, And I hadn't been. To consider nature purposively dangerous is also to commit the pathetic fallacy. Besides, nature in Frost never is so dangerous that his speakers cannot protect themselves against it. Frost takes into account nature's destructiveness, but his ex- amples of it are seldom very frightening. The whispering scythe of "Mowing" must in performing its useful labor cut down the pale orchises and scare a bright green snake. Before they "can mount again," the leaves of "In Hardwood Groves" must "go down into the dark decayed." But the scythe is whispering in effect that all is well; while toward the natural cycle, the theme that gave birth to tragedy and religion, Frost takes a merely commonsense atti- tude: "However it is in some other world/ I know that this is the way in ours." In "Storm Fear," the speaker, waking to hear the wind and snow seem to challenge him to come out and fight, is 3*7</page><page sequence="6">THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR glad not to accept the challenge and wonders in despair whether he and his family will have the strength to save themselves in the morning. But even in this poem, we know that the despair is a passing mood, that in the morning they will have the strength. Death itself is adumbrated as a sleep in two perfect poems, "After Apple-Picking ' and "An Old Man's Winter Night." In both poems, the man falls asleep when his work is almost but not quite finished, his sleep corresponds to the sleep of nature in winter, and the natural process takes over his unfinished work. Forgetting what he came to do in a roomful of barrels, the old man of the lat- ter poem consigns to the moon his snow upon the roof, his icicles, and sleeps. One aged man - one man - can't keep a house, A farm, a countryside, or if he can, It's thus he does it of a winter night. This shows harmony with nature - except that the old man's "clomping" in and out of the room makes an almost supernatural disturbance, scaring the cellar and the outer night; while the lamp he carries keeps him from seeing out-of-doors, it lights only him- self with his own thoughts. The noise and the thoughts suggest the slightest disharmony with nature. In "After Apple-Picking," it is also thoughts of the day's and season's apple-picking, of the unpicked apples and of "magnified apples" better than any on the boughs that will "trouble" the speaker's oncoming sleep, "whatever sleep it is." Is it a night's or winter's dream of the day's or autumn's activity; and is such a troubled slumber natural or supernatural? The woodchuck could say whether it's like his Long sleep, as I describe its coming on, Or just some human sleep. "Just," of course, from the woodchuck 's point of view, for the speculation reminds me at least of Keats 's fancy that our next life will be a spiritual repetition of this one "in a finer tone." It is not to quarrel with these poems - who could be anything but grateful for perfection? - to say that they are idyls. For there is a harmony even in the disharmony; they leave out the agony of 328</page><page sequence="7">THE NEW NATURE POETRY dying. Here as elsewhere Frost's acceptances are won without an- guish - partly because the danger is not dangerous enough, partly because of Frost's personal strength, which is always at least equal to the danger. His darkest nature poem is "Desert Places," where the snow and the dark wood are unambiguously desolate: "Snow falling and night falling, fast, oh, fast/ . . . The woods around it have it - it is theirs." The loneliness includes me unawares. And lonely as it is that loneliness Will be more lonely ere it will be less- A blanker whiteness of benighted snow With no expression, nothing to express. They cannot scare me with their empty spaces Between stars- on stars where no human race is. I have it in me so much nearer home To scare myself with my own desert places. But even here, where Frost sees nature as a void and takes into ac- count the implications of science (rare for Frost), he turns into a kind of consolation that perception of an internal void which would be for another poet the most terrifying perception of all. "Loneliness . . . will be less" together with "scare myself" suggest that the scare is the illusory thing, almost a game (scaring one's self and others) of spooks. Such resistance comes of sheer biological vitality, a self- preserving common sense, which Reginald Cook in a recent book on Frost calls his sabiduría - a Spanish word meaning "the wisdom of a people welling up in any one of its articulate members." It is sabiduría that keeps Frost at the edge of the "dark wood," keeps him from following his insights through to their logical implica- tions, from risking the destructiveness of abstract thought. "The world's one globe," he says in "Build Soil," human society Another softer globe that slightly flattened Rests on the world, and clinging slowly rolls. We have our own round shape to keep unbroken. The worlďs size has no more to do with us Than has the universe's. З29</page><page sequence="8">THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR He is able to shrug off those conflicts between man and nature, thought and reality, head and heart, science and religion, which since the romantic period have torn other poets apart. The result is a poetry that delivers us from the poignancy of the historical moment to place us in contact with a survival-making eternal folk wisdom. We can live by Frost's poetry as we could not by Yeats's or Pound's. Yet his poetry, although it must rank high in our affections, is not likely to be the favorite poetry of the most serious readers, just because Frost does not call into play all our faculties; he does not make poetry of our ideas, which in modern times have mainly to do with our sense of the age. The poets who have since the romantic period made the greatest impact are pre- cisely those poets who have made us most aware of the historical moment, having themselves not merely known about but felt the conflicts of their age. That is the difference between Wordsworth's nature poetry and Frost's. To talk about nature in Wordsworth's way was at the turn of the nineteenth century to be at the forefront of thought, to take into account the science, philosophy and psychology of the age, its religious skepticism, the French Revolution, the problem of the modern analytic intellect as the destroyer of feeling. If nature was orderly and the self an association of external impressions, then a life in the country would insure you the most favorable impres- sions. It would afford evidence of God's existence, an alternative or supplement to revolution and political reform for man's improve- ment, and an object that could still inspire feelings, even super- natural apprehensions. The deliberate return to nature went with the deliberate cultivation of the feelings as the necessary antidote to the conditions of modern life. No nineteenth-century reader could share in one of Wordsworth's epiphanies - one of his revela- tions through visible nature of "the life of things" - without a very poignant awareness of victory over the age. That is what John Stuart Mill meant when he called Wordsworth "the poet of unpoetical [distinctively modern] natures"; it is what Matthew Arnold meant when he said that in "this iron time" Wordsworth taught us to feel again. Now Frost's sense of nature as manageable is very like Words- 33°</page><page sequence="9">THE NEW NATURE POETRY worth's, as is his method of conveying that sense. For Frost, too, gives us little dramatic actions that culminate in epiphanies. But Frost's are timid epiphanies, for they deliberately stop short of, where they do not explicitly repudiate, philosophical implications; and they do not arise, as they often do in Wordsworth, from an impasse in thought, thought grounded in the age. Frost's moments of awareness are accidents that could happen to any one in any age. The sign of this is that they do not change the speaker who simply goes back to his business; whereas Wordsworth's speakers undergo a measure of conversion. That is why his poems can be read in sequence as an evolution from eighteenth-century doubt through romantic transcendentalism to Christian orthodoxy. In the sheer power to render nature, Frost may well be our best nature poet since Wordsworth. Yet it is because Frost's sense of nature is so like Wordsworth's that he does not play in our time the role Wordsworth played in his, that he leads us away from rather than to the center of the preoccupations of the time. For Frost cannot embrace the transcendentalism that his sense of nature suggests; but neither does he have the so much wilder sense of nature that our latest nature philosophy requires. Our nature philosophy has been made not only by Darwin but by Freud and Frazer. It connects not only man's body but his mind and culture to the primeval ooze; and you cannot convey that sense of nature in poems about the cultivated countryside of England or New England. It is about the tropics or the sea, the primeval sources of life, that contemporary poets are apt to write when they do in our age what Wordsworth did in his: when they convey in their sense of nature their sense of the age. Wallace Stevens is fond of seascapes, Florida settings and tropical birds. Marianne Moore goes farther afield with her tropical lizards, her fish and mollusks, her frigate pelican, her small Sahara field-mouse, her mongoose and cobra. One of the reasons the new nature poetry is not recognizable as such is that it is so often about animals rather than landscapes. The poet is less likely to commit the pathetic fallacy with animals, for they have a consciousness of their own. Then animals do for the landscape what the older kind of nature poet had to do himself - ЗЗ1</page><page sequence="10">THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR they bring it to life. They are the landscape crystallized into move- ment and consciousness; so that Marianne Moore begins "The Plumet Basilisk" by distinguishing this Costa Rican lizard from the landscape we take him for at first: In blazing driftwood the green keeps showing at the same place- as, intermittently, the fire-opal shows blue and green. The new nature poetry deals often with the line between nonliving and living unconsciousness - as its way of evoking "the life of things." For the new nature poetry is really about that concept by which living unconsciousness has come to be understood as a form of consciousness and, paradoxically, the most vital form of it. Nature poetry, which must always be about the living principle in nature, declined as it became more and more difficult to assert that principle, especially after Darwin seemed to remove mind from even the higher forms of life. The new concept of the uncon- scious, instead, has extended mind to the very borderline between animate and inanimate nature. For it has connected the substratum of our minds with the minds of the very lowest reaches of animal life, thus reanimating all of nature and making nature poetry pos- sible again. We have already seen how, by emphasizing the dead- ness of the dynamic and life-giving sea, Marianne Moore makes us feel how nearly alive the sea is, thus enhancing our sense of what it is to be alive. She starts higher up the scale in The Fish wade through black jade. Of the crow-blue mussel-shells, one keeps adjusting the ash-heaps; opening and shutting itself like an injured fan to move down, through the equivocally living mussel-shells, to barnacles stirred into life, and only thus distinguished from the sea, by "submerged shafts of the/ sun," moving 33*</page><page sequence="11">THE NEW NATURE POETRY themselves with spotlight swiftness into the crevices- in and out, illuminating the turquoise sea of bodies to the unalive erosive action of the sea against the cliff. This in- organic process is more dynamic than the jelly-fish, crabs and toad- stools that "slide" under its impetus "each on the other." Yet the emphasis in the end on its deadness and lack of reproductive capa- city reminds us of the mysterious point where inorganic turns into organic process. The "chasm-side" of the cliff is dead. Repeated evidence has proved that it can live on what can not revive its youth. The sea grows old in it. Light is the vivifying principle in Wallace Stevens' "Tattoo," where the light, crawling "like a spider" over the landscape and under your eyelids, brings both your eyes and the landscape to life: There are filaments of your eyes On the surface of the water And in the edges of the snow. Along with the sense of nature's otherness goes the sense that it cannot be known in itself, that we can know only our own percep- tion of it - not only our individual perception but also (and this is where the new nature poetry goes beyond that of the nineteenth century and of Frost with his "dark wood") the perception our civi- lization, our style of art, gives us. Thus Stevens gives "Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird," and tells us how the round jar he placed on a hill in Tennessee gave a shape to nature, "made the slovenly wilderness/Surround that hill." The jar made nature see- able. There is a dispute as to whether Stevens in "Anecdote of the Jar" is praising art or nature. I would say both, on the evidence of his other poems. Art is not the same as nature, but our perception of even natural beauty depends on an aesthetic - an aesthetic which, 333</page><page sequence="12">THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR like consciousness itself, is a crystallization of the landscape but with an even more inexplicable difference. The rendition of nature through an art style calls attention to the fact that nature can be known only through an aesthetic. Thus it enhances our sense of nature's otherness and unknowability. It is no accident that Stevens and Marianne Moore are concerned not only with nature but also with styles of art and civilization - that they are known even for a certain preciosity. For there seems to be a direct proportion be- tween our sense of nature as wild and nonhuman, and our appre- ciation of just the artificial surface, the distinctively * 'aesthetic1 ' quality, of art and civilization. Marianne Moore, who can render the sea naturalistically, gives us the same sense of its dynamics when she renders it in the static style of Dürer: "water etched/ with waves as formal as the scales/ on a fish." To render the jerboa or Sahara field-mouse, she starts "The Jerboa" with an almost suffocating evocation of the highly artificial and excessively opulent beauty of the oppressive civiliza- tion of the Pharaohs; and she does this largely by cataloguing the multitude (the section is called "Too Much") of African animals they tamed, carved, worshipped: took as models for and forced into their art style. After tightening the spring for fifteen such stanzas, she releases it in two stanzas where she evokes by contrast the happiness, beauty, freedom of the jerboa, who "lives without water," in the midst of nothingness, and without reference to men: "but one would not be he/ who has nothing but plenty." In "The Plumet Basilisk," she no sooner brings the lizard to life from the "blazing driftwood" we take him for at first, than she says: "In Costa Rica the true Chinese lizard face/ is found, of the amphibious falling dragon, the living fire-/ work" - reminding us that the lizard was the dragon of art and mythology, even a god. Alarmed, he "dives to the stream-bed, hiding as the chieftain with gold/ body hid in/ Guatavita Lake" - a reference, the Notes tell us, to the yearly ceremony in which the king, "powdered with gold- dust as symbolic of the sun," plunged into the lake. Recalling Frazer, we may infer that the king renewed his vitality or godhead by returning to the source of it, just as the lizard at this moment returns to his underwater "basilica." "The plumet portrays/," we are told later on, "mythology's wish/ to be interchangeably man 334</page><page sequence="13">THE NEW NATURE POETRY and fish." And the basilisk is rendered in its relation to other liz- ards - and to the whole of evolution, from water, through the Rep- tilian Age (the birds toddle in and out among sea lizards' tails "laid criss-cross, alligator-style"), to the dragons carved over the door of the bourse in Copenhagen. His retreat in the end from the observer is a return in consciousness to the legendary past of treasures guarded by dragons (' 'Thinking himself hid among the yet un- found jade axe-/ heads") and a physical return to the water ("his basilisk cocoon"). The regression is the climactic manifestation of his vitality: he is alive there in his basilisk cocoon beneath the one of living green; his quicksilver ferocity quenched in the rustle of his fall into the sheath which is the shattering sudden splash that marks his temporary loss. There is a similar regression in Richard Wilbur's "The Death of a Toad," where the toad who has been caught in a power mower pours his "rare original heartsblood" back into the earth, lying "still as if he would return to stone," dying Toward misted and ebullient seas And cooling shores, toward lost Amphibia's emperies. We not only retrace the course of evolution back to inanimate nature, but we are reminded of antique statues ("The gutters of the banked and staring eyes," "the wide and antique eyes") and the death of gods. In Richard Eberhart's "The Groundhog," the speaker sees in the decaying corpse of a groundhog dead "In June, amid the golden fields," first the ferocity of the natural process, of the sun's "immense energy," and finally the pathos of the whole history of civilization which the speaker has recapitulated in his successive responses to the fact of death: I stood there in the whirling summer, My hand capped a withered heart, And thought of China and of Greece, Of Alexander in his tent; Of Montaigne in his tower, Of Saint Theresa in her wild lament. 335</page><page sequence="14">THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR The associations in these two poems are a bit literary, a bit forced, but they illustrate all the better the climate of ideas behind the new nature poetry. They also show how animals operate in that poetry to connect inanimate nature with civilization through our current ideas about the vitality of the unconscious life and the origins of culture in the worship of animals, the contemplation of the vege- tation cycle, and the killing of gods to renew the fertility of the soil. The same psychological and anthropological knowledge can be applied to landscape. In a remarkable poem called "The Moun- tain/' W. S. Merwin evokes the divinity of a mountain through the dispassionate accents of a modern, scientifically minded speaker who inhabits the lower slopes. "Only on the rarest occasions," the poem begins, "can one trace the rising/ Slopes high enough to call them contours." Then It is with almost a shock that one recognizes What supposedly one had known always: That it is, in fact, a mountain; not merely This restrictive sense of nothing level, of never Being able to go anywhere But up or down, until it seems probable Sometimes that the slopes, to be so elusive And yet so inescapable, must be nothing But ourselves: that we have grown with one Foot shorter than the other, and would deform The levellest habitat to our misshapen Condition, as is said of certain hill creatures. No one has seen the summit, although the attempt was at one time "a kind of holy maelstrom, Mecca/ For fanatics and madmen," and there have been recent expeditions with "expensive equipment." Very few Who set out at all seriously have Come back. At a relatively slight distance Above us, apparently the whole aspect and condition Of the mountain changes completely; there is ceaseless wind With a noise like thunder and the beating of wings. Of those who came back, some were deaf, some blind, all "dazzled, as by a great light," those who perhaps went farthest lost the use of ЗЗ6</page><page sequence="15">THE NEW NATURE POETRY language and the sense of time - all of which seems "from earliest/ Antiquity to have excited speculation." One legend has it that a remote king-priest figure Once gained the summit, spent some-to him non-sequent But to them significant- time there, and returned "Shining," bearing ciphers of the arcane (which, Translated into the common parlance, proved To be a list of tribal taboos) like clastic Specimens, and behaved with a glacial violence Later construed as wisdom. This, though Charming, does not, in the light of current endeavor, Seem possible, even though so long ago. Yet To corroborate this story, in the torrent Gold has been found which even at this Late date appears to have been powdered by hand, And (further to confuse inquiry) several Pediments besides, each with four sockets shaped As though to receive the hoof of a giant statue Of some two-toed ungulate. Legend being What it is, there are those who still insist He will come down again some day from the mountain. As there are those - and here the tension between the accumulating conviction and the skeptical language is resolved through a transformation of the discussion into psychological terms (myth is what happens when- ever mind meets nature) - who say it will fall on us. It Will fall. And those who say it has already Fallen. It has already fallen. Have we not Seen it fall in shadow, evening after evening, Across everything we can touch; do we not build Our houses out of the great hard monoliths That have crashed down from far above us? Shadows Are not without substance, remind and predict; And we know we live between greater commotions Than any we can describe. But, most important: Since this, though we know so little of it, is All we know, is it not whatever it makes us Believe of it- even the old woman Who laughs, pointing, and says that the clouds across Its face are wings of seraphim? Even the young 337</page><page sequence="16">THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR Man who, standing on it, declares it is not There at all. He stands with one leg habitually Bent, to keep from falling, as though he had grown That way, as is said of certain hill creatures. The mountain is divine in the same sense as Marianne Moore's cobra in "Snakes, Mongooses." Whatever we think the mountain is, its irreducible otherness remains; and the cobra's perfect single- ness of line, as it stands up from the snake-charmer's basket, annihi- lates distinctions, showing "that when intelligence in its pure form/ has embarked on a train of thought which is unproductive,/ it will come back" - back to the otherness of reality. These intui- tions of reality are like Frost's "dark wood," except that they in- volve, too, a distinct sense of the past, and therefore of the present. Since they stimulate us to apply all we know of current ideas, they bring out into the open what must be, I suppose, the ultimate sub- ject of nature poetry - the divinity in nature. The history of nature poetry is in a sense recapitulated in Wal- lace Stevens' "Sunday Morning," a lovely meditation arising, like the meditations of Wordsworth, in response to a landscape. The consistent water imagery suggests that the modern cosmopolitan lady is looking out over water as she lounges late of a sunny Sunday morning, aware that she is not, after all, in church. Certain tropical accouterments, "coffee and oranges," And the green freedom of a cockatoo Upon a rug mingle to dissipate The holy hush of ancient sacrifice but remind her, too, of sacrifices more ancient still than Christ's: The pungent oranges and bright, green wings Seem things in some procession of the dead, Winding across the wide water, without sound. "Why should she give her bounty to the dead?" she asks. "Divinity must live within herself:/ Passions of rain, or moods in falling snow." Thus she comes past the rejection of Christianity to the transcendentalism of romantic nature poetry with its moments of private insight. She remembers the alienation of religion from na- ture with sky-gods like Jove, and how Christianity brought God З38</page><page sequence="17">THE NEW NATURE POETRY back to earth again - although it bequeathed the uneasy question whether earth was to be brought to heaven or heaven to earth. Nature is her paradise; no, better than paradise. For death makes the difference, "is the mother of beauty/' gives the outlet to imagi- nation, the savor to life. Awareness of death leads to a vision of communal nature wor- ship reminiscent of the old vegetation rites: Supple and turbulent, a ring of men Shall chant in orgy on a summer morn Their boisterous devotion to the sun, Not as a god, but as a god might be, Naked among them, like a savage source. It is when we see nature as a source of both life and death that appreciation turns into worship. The natural cycle is the source of all religions: They shall know well the heavenly fellowship Of men that perish and of summer morn. And whence they came and whither they shall go The dew upon their feet shall manifest. The poem ended here originally; but in adding the final sec- tion, Stevens not only completed his poem by returning us to the water and answering the question he raised about Christianity, he also completed his history of nature poetry. She hears, upon that water without sound, A voice that cries, "The tomb in Palestine Is not the porch of spirits lingering. It is the grave of Jesus, where he lay." In terms of its own supernatural claims, Christianity is dead; but after all that has been said in the poem we must understand, too, that as the worship of the dead god, of the natural cycle, Chris- tianity is part of an inherent religion that always has lived and al- ways will live. The poem ends with one of the very best passages of modern American nature poetry, a passage which, deriving its poignancy from the strength of its resistance to the pathetic fallacy, expresses perfectly the sense in which, with what we now know 339</page><page sequence="18">THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR about the unconscious life of man and nature, we can feel that the world both is and is not God-abandoned. We live in an old chaos of the sun, Or old dependency of day and night, Or island solitude, unsponsored, free, Of that wide water, inescapable. Deer walk upon our mountains, and the quail Whistle about us their spontaneous cries; Sweet berries ripen in the wilderness; And, in the isolation of the sky, At evening, casual flocks of pigeons make Ambiguous undulations as they sink, Downward to darkness, on extended wings. Those "ambiguous undulations" are the point where nature poetry comes full circle from the rejection of the old religion of nature to the discovery of an inevitably re-emerging religion of nature at the source of things.
