BURGESS Assistant Professor of Religion, Case Western Reserve University IRREDUCIBLE RELIGIOUS METAPHORS A characteristic feature of religious discourse is its tendency to use expressions which are not only metaphorical but 'irreducibly metaphorical', that is to say, which have no literal equivalent. Sophisticated believers freely point out theology's tendency toward the 'symbolical', 'analogical', or 'mysterious'; while equally sophisticated sceptics complain that faith is 'anthropomorphic' or 'merely poetic'. When this discussion between believers and seeptics is confronted with what we may call the 'reducibility thesis', that metaphors should be reducible to literal statements, a philosophical puzzle results: religious metaphors should be reducible, but they are not. In this paper I shall examine a recent discussion among philosophers and literary critics about some problems concerning one type of irreducibility in metaphor. Particular attention will be paid to the work of Paul Henle on metaphor and of William Alston on religious metaphor. At stake is the semantic status not only of many key religious expressions but also of common psychological and philosophical terms. I shall argue that the highly paradoxical conclusions to which Henle and Alston lead us derive from their overlooking of the logical force of some aspects of the language speaking situation. REDUCIBILITY AND IRREDUCIBILITY The works of Paul Henle and William Alston on metaphor draw upon two different traditions of theory concerning the operation of metaphor: i. The reducibility thesis A good example of the strict 'reducibility thesis' is to be found in Ogden and Richards' classic The Meaning of Meaning. Within their triangular schema a 'sign' normally refers to an 'object' via a 'thought', thus producing a literal statement. A metaphor is a sign which makes this same reference in an oblique, inexplicit fashion, by way of a thought of something which is only similar to the object in some striking way. As far as the cognitive sense of the statement is concerned, then, the metaphor is best replaced by an explicit, literal paraphrase.' Since religious metaphors frequently do not have a referent which can 1 C. K. Ogden and I. A. Richards, The Meaning of Meaning (New York, 1923), esp. pp. 212-13.</page><page sequence="2">356 ANDREW J. BURGESS be pointed out, not in any obvious way at least, their meaningfulness has been called into question by some proponents of this viewpoint. In his critique of Paul Tillich, for example, Paul Edwards argues as follows: 'When a sentence contains an irreducible metaphor, it follows at once that the sentence is devoid of cognitive meaning, that it is unintelligible, that it fails to make a genuine assertion. For what has happened is that the sentence has been deprived of the referent it would have had, assuming that certain other con ditions had also been fulfilled, if the expression in question had been used in its literal sense. To say that the metaphor is irreducible is to say in effect that no new referent can be supplied'.' The referential theory of meaning upon which this form of the reducibility thesis depends, however, has well-known difficulties of its own, which deprive this critique of religious metaphors of some of its force. Many philosophers reject the view that words in general mean by referring to objects, directly or indirectly; and among these philosophers is William Alston,2 the man with whom we are here chiefly concerned. 2. The irreducibility thesis Over against the Ogden-Richards type of theory there is a kind of 'ir reducibility thesis', which insists that metaphors cannot be given an adequate literal paraphrase. Often the chief support of this side has been from poets and literary critics. Among philosophers the late work of I. A. Richards, of the Ogden-Richards tandem just mentioned, has been an important influence also on this side of the reducibility/irreducibility question. In his The Philosophy of Rhetoric Richards comes out against what he calls the 'Proper Meaning Superstition' that each word 'has a meaning of its own (ideally only one) independent of and controlling its use and the purpose for which it is uttered'.3 Instead he stresses the ways in which words 'interact', 'cooperate', and 'inter-illuminate' each other; they become known by the contexts in which they typically appear, by the company they keep. Meta phor, then, is the abrupt modification of the sense of one word or phrase (called the 'tenor') by another (called the 'vehicle').4 Continuing the investigation of metaphor along these lines, other theorists have tried to find ways of explaining its function more in terms of the connotations of words than in the ways in which words refer to objects or situations. Monroe Beardsley suggests that instead of the substitution of one referent for another we begin our explanation by speaking of a logical 1 Paul Edwards, 'Professor Tillich's Confusions', Mind, LXXIV (April, I965), pp. I99-200. 2 William Alston, Philosophy of Language (Englewood Cliffs, N.J., I964), pp. 12-22. 3 I. A. Richards, The Philosophy of Rhetoric (New York, I965), p. I I. 4 Max Black, in an essay in Models and Metaphors (Ithaca, N.Y., I962), p. 28, improves on this terminology with the pair 'focus' and 'linguistic frame'.</page><page sequence="3">IRREDUCIBLE RELIGIOUS METAPHORS 357 opposition exhibited between the central connotations of the 'tenor' and those of the 'vehicle'. This implies a (very loose) distinction between 'two sets of properties in the intension, or signification of a general term: first, those properties that (at least in a given sort of context) are taken to be necessary conditions for applying the term correctly in a particular sense . . . second, those properties that belong to the marginal meaning of the term . . . properties that a speaker can, in appropriate contexts, show that he attributes to an object without claiming to follow a rule that he would apply the term to that kind of object if it did not have that property'.' The metaphorical shift of the sense of a word occurs when there is a conflict between the sense of the vehicle and the first set of properties described above, the central meaning of the tenor. For example, in the metaphor 'inconstant moon' there is a conflict between the tenor 'moon' and the human connotations of the vehicle 'inconstant' which drives us to more remote connotations of the tenor, such as 'often changing'. With respect to religious metaphors, the most prominent figure among the analytic group holding the 'irreducibility thesis' has been I. T. Ramsey.2 Taking his cue from a pair of articles by Max Black,3 Ramsey interprets religious metaphors in terms of the interaction between a model and its qualifier. With regard to the sentence 'God is our Father', for example, he says: '"Father" is now the model: a word we know specifying situations with which we are familiar. If we have had a good home, already some picture is before our minds.... On the other hand, human fathers are limited ... Here is one part of the significance of words like "incomprehensible," "uncreated", "eternal." These are stimulants to move us in the right direction along a series of father situations. They are directives so that we shall think away the inappropriate features'.4 Here 'Father' is the human model and 'incomprehensible', 'uncreated' 'eternal' are qualifiers which help to keep us from using the father model in the wrong way. But such qualifiers do not specify what sort of human father situation should be employed. Rather they serve to evoke an 'insight' (Ramsey's frequent term) so that we will grasp a quite different father situation in a different 'language stratum'. What makes some philosophers uneasy about a proposal such as Ramsey's is that it seems to make both the meaningfulness and truth of the religious 1 Monroe C. Beardsley, 'The Metaphorical Twist', Philosophy and Phenomenological Research XXII (March, I962), p. 299. Cf.

These philosophers want to insist that there are some metaphors which are simply nonsense, no matter who claims to have a disclosure from them.' HENLE AND ALSTON From the start of Paul Henle's work on metaphor to William Alston's application of the theory to religious and psychological metaphors there is a certain persistent but unannounced ambiguity. The operation of metaphor is characterised in two supposedly complementary ways; and when in the end the two paths diverge, the reader is left with a puzzle. i. Paul Henle Henle's essay starts with two characterisations of metaphor. The first and more common is simple enough: (i) 'Some object of thought is referred to by means of the sign for some other such object.'2 Then he continues: 'This will do well enough, but it is a little more convenient to say essentially the same thing from the side of the sign rather than from the object signified. Thus we may say that in a metaphor a sign having a conventional sense is used in a different sense'.3 But this second definition, (2) 'a sign having a conventional sense is used in a different sense', is not at all the same as the first; it does not 'say essentially the same thing from the side of the sign rather than from the object signified', not at least unless one equates giving the linguistic conventions for a sign with giving its referent. And this Henle does not do. Here he parts with the Ogden Richards pattern in a significant way, in that he identifies the meaning of a term not with its referent but with, for example, its use as stated in a dictionary. In the paragraph just following he writes: 'In any case, the literal sense most often would be the meaning of a term given by a dictionary or, if there is more than one dictionary meaning, the meaning which is appropriate in context. There may be cases, however, in which an author gives terms a special sense, either implicitly or by explicit convention, and this may serve as the literal sense'.4 1 Ronald Hepburn cites an example of such a model in the phrase from the Nicene Creed 'before all worlds'. This, he says, could be explicated as 'Back, back in time, before X, before Y, before Z ... before anything', but it would still be only 'disguised nonsense'.

I74. 4 Ibid.</page><page sequence="5">IRREDUCIBLE RELIGIOUS METAPHORS 359 Unless Henle's dictionary differs from the usual one, which defines words by synonymous expressions and not by referents, his second description of metaphor is different from the first. Despite the fact that many of the definitions from which he proceeds follow the second ('conventional') approach to the elucidation of a metaphor,' the main argument of the article depends clearly upon the first (referential) approach. He proceeds through the use of Peirce's term 'icon' (a sign which 'signifies in virtue of similarity'),2 and he sums up the argument by saying: 'Metaphor, then, is analysable into a double sort of semantic relationship. First, using symbols in Peirce's sense, directions are given for finding an object or situation. This use of language3 is quite ordinary. Second, it is implied that any object or situation fitting the direction may serve as an icon of what one wishes to describe. The icon is never actually present; rather, through the rule, one understands what it must be and, through this understanding, what it signifies'.4 Take, for example, the now dead metaphor 'the hood of a car'. When that expression was first used it worked as a metaphor in the following way: First, an object was specified, in this case a hood (of a coat). Second, by placing the name for the object specified in the grammatical construction 'of a car' it was implied that the hood of a coat was somehow similar to the 'hood' of a car. Whether anyone ever managed to identify the 'hood' on a car by using this metaphor is hard to say, since people quickly learned more direct ways for recognizing car hoods, and the metaphor died. What Henle does not explain is that he is using two conflicting methods for handling metaphor, one of them in terms of denotation and one in terms of connotation. Where the two ways are the same, of course, there may not be any confusion from treating them together. One might say that the expression 'the hood of a car' became literal by becoming the name for something which was easy to point at, or one might say it did so by finding its way into the dictionary. The two procedures for metaphor are the same here because the linguistic conventions for such an expression are simply directions for making the reference correctly. But the identification runs into difficulties with other cases, as Henle himself notes. The word 'cosmos' in Homeric Greek originally referred to any sort of pleasing array, such as a woman's headdress; later this was extended metaphorically to apply to the ranks of an army, and still later extended again to cover the universe as a whole. By the one account the term became literal each time it was lexically established. But with the other sort of explanation which was just used on the 'hood' metaphor we run into a difficulty at the last Paul Henle, 'Metaphor', Language, Thought, and Culture, (Ann Arbor, 1958), pp. 174-7. 2 Ibid., p.

BURGESS state of the term, where it applies to the universe. We know how we recognise and identify the hood of a car, or we can learn; but what does it mean to do this with the universe as a whole? 'A world order may equally be there, but it certainly cannot be pointed at in the same way. The only means of thinking about it may be the metaphor. Perhaps the new idea is inconceivable apart from the metaphor'.' 3. William Alston The account of metaphor in Alston's The Philosophy of Language follows closely the treatment by Henle which has just been discussed, with only minor differences in example and emphasis. Like Henle, Alston starts by speaking of the conventional meanings of an expression, that is, the senses which might find their way into a dictionary or at least be commonly recognised in conversation. These senses of an expression Alston calls the 'established' senses, as opposed to the metaphorical or derived senses.2 At the same time Alston also accepts Henle's procedure of dealing with meta phors as 'icons', with the referential scheme which this approach implies. Not surprisingly Alston's results are similar to Henle's. Besides the usual metaphors which are born and die, Alston tells us, there are two sorts of metaphors which are 'irreducible'.3 These are religious metaphors (e.g. 'God is punishing me') and metaphors relating to personal feelings and sensations (e.g. 'I feel constricted' or 'I feel a stabbing pain'). They occupy a peculiar intermediate position between established and metaphorical expressions. (i) In one sense they are like other metaphors which can become established by the usual lexicographical criteria. (2) But in another respect they are a class peculiar to themselves; they are 'irreducibly meta phorical', because they can only be taught by reference to another expression which has a sense established referentially. This last point is already familiar to us, having been made by Henle concerning the term 'cosmos'. Alston writes of the pair of sentences 'God has punished me' and 'My father has punished me' 'Although the latter can, in principle, be explained by directing the learner's attention to certain observable transactions, the former can be explained only by directing the learner to take cases of one man punishing another as models (or icons) of what is meant, much as a clearly metaphorical statement directs the 1 Henle, Language, Thought, and Culture, p. I89. 2 William Alston, Philosophy of Language, pp. 96-I02. On p. I02 he suggests that the contrast 'metaphorical' 'established' is a less misleading way of speaking than the usual 'metaphorical' 'literal'. In this way, he apparently is correcting his own usage in an article printed at the same time entitled 'Elucidation of Religious Statements', in Process and Divinity: Philosophical Essays Presented to Charles Hartshorne, ed. by William L. Reese and Eugene Freeman (La Salle, Illinois, I964), pp. 429-43. 3 Alston, Philosophy of Language, pp. 103-6.</page><page sequence="7">IRREDUCIBLE RELIGIOUS METAPHORS 36I listener to take a certain kind of situation as a model of something else. This priority is necessary and irreversible'.' What is the basis of this necessity? Is it a matter of fact or of logic? Alston carefully weighs this issue and concludes that it is the latter; 'We cannot point to cases of God punishing someone .. . ;2 there is no ostensive teaching device, and 'nothing analogous to the publicly observable direction of visual attention that shows the teacher when the learner is paying atten tion to an act of human punishment'.3 Likewise with statements of personal feelings such as 'I feel constricted' there 'is no publicly observable situational feature, facial expression, or behaviour that is specially tied to feeling constricted, as contrasted with feeling embarrassed, apprehensive, or out of place'.4 Hence with both theological discourse and talk about personal feelings and sensations, we are irresistibly forced to express ourselves in metaphorical terms. Alston's conclusions about religious and psychological metaphors bring out sharply the consequences of Henle's starting-point. Both men hover between the two theses about metaphor. The predictable result is that a set of cases are discovered about which the reducibility and irreducibility theses do not agree, and in which we do not know whether the metaphors are reducible or irreducible. Edwards would have no particular problem with Henle's 'cosmos' example nor with Alston's psychological or religious metaphors; he would say that they were either reducible or else nonsensical. Likewise, Beardsley would find no difficulty in accounting for such cases; since from his standpoint any metaphor worthy of the name is 'irreducible', cosmological, psychological, and religious metaphors are in this respect members in good standing within a numerous and glorious company. On the other hand, since Henle and Alston move back and forth between the reducibility and the irreducibility theses without taking account of the incompatibility, the problems they encounter in analysing metaphors should come as no surprise at all. Henle and Alston differ in the way in which they assess the problematic metaphors. While Henle seems simply intrigued by the logical peculiarities, of these expressions, Alston hints that such metaphors are somehow question able and need to be isolated for now into a separate class, which he calls the 'quasi-metaphorical'.5 Such 'quasi-metaphors' have not fully qualified as metaphors. They have been established so that they have a place in the dictionary and they may very well be understood in discourse. But they have not been fully established as expressions designating publicly observable I Alston, Philosophy of Language, p. I04. 2 Ibid., p. I05. 3 Ibid., p. 104. 4 Ibid., p. 105. 5 Ibid., pp. 103-8.</page><page sequence="8">362 ANDREW J. BURGESS situations. Accordingly they are relegated to probationary status until their philosophical status can be clarified. Can their deficiency be supplied? That which in Henle is simply an illustration of the rich diversity of meta phorical expression becomes in Alston a predicament from which philo sophers of religion and philosophers of mind are called upon to extricate themselves, if they can. A CONTEXTUAL DESCRIPTION OF METAPHOR World, God, and self-these were the centres of classical metaphysics and the transcendental Ideas of Kant; now they return as the leading examples of 'quasi-metaphor' offered by Henle and Alston. It is perhaps not sur prising that a theory of language which depends partly on the ostensive teaching of expressions should sooner or later run afoul of such perennial philosophical hazards as the concepts of cosmos, God, and mental states. Indeed, the class of 'quasi-metaphors' seems likely to prove a large one, including not only a number of philosophical concepts, such as 'substance' and 'ego',' but also many concepts from other disciplines. I. The teaching of metaphor The best way to examine this cross-breed, the 'quasi-metaphor', may be to isolate the kinds of language situation in which such expressions are sup posed to be taught, and to look particularly at the kinds of pupil to whom they are taught. But since there are two theories being used there are also at least two kinds of pupil involved. In what follows, the points at which Alston follows the 'reducibility thesis' are represented by a pupil whom we shall call 'Mr A', while Alston's procedures for understanding metaphor which follow a form of the 'irreducibility thesis' are ascribed to another imaginary pupil called 'Mr B'. (a) Consider first Mr A, the pupil who needs some sort of ostensive explanation of terms. Mr A knows names for typical human situations and their properties. His procedure for understanding a new expression is to take the terms and compare them with the names of situations with which he is familiar, much as one might compare colours and their names which stand on a chart. Apart from this lone talent, Mr A has to make up with dogged persistence what he lacks in the upper story. He can handle meta phors such as 'hood of a car', but he is at a loss when he cannot point. Small wonder, then, that he has trouble making much sense out of the Revelation of John, for example, and that he flounders about in Euclid's Elements or Plato's Parmenides. Parts of these books must be nearly unintel ligible to him. And his sad state is not just a matter of fact but of logic; 1 Henle, 'Metaphor', Language, Thought, and Culture, p. I92.</page><page sequence="9">IRREDUCIBLE RELIGIOUS METAPHORS 363 given his restricted capacities there is no conceivable way in which any teacher could impart more than a rudimentary understanding of the books to him. (b) After dealing with Mr A, it is a pleasure to turn to teaching Mr B, 'a fairly sensitive person with a command of the language'.' Although Mr B knows his way about the English language (and not just Webster's dictionary) he, too, has his limitations. If he is to serve as nothing more than the prototype for the 'fairly sensitive' language-user as such he must be given only characteristics which all such people can be counted on to share. This means that his experience will have to be extremely limited, no greater than the experiences which all men have in common; and his convictions likewise can be only those on which all men agree, that is to say, practically none at all. Despite these limitations, however, Mr B will still be able to be far better at understanding metaphors than poor Mr A. Although there is no ostensive definition of 'god', there is a sense for the term in common usage and a definition in the dictionary, and that is enough to establish the term for Mr B. But where, in either of these learning situations, do we come- across 'quasi-metaphors'? Not in teaching Mr A, for whom metaphorical expres sions are unintelligible from the start, or else quickly become dead metaphors. Nor in teaching Mr B, for whom metaphors can be established by lexical aids. 'Quasi-metaphors' do not arise until one takes expressions-such as 'cosmos' and 'God'-and then, after deciding that they could not be taught to Mr A, turns around and demands that it must be possible to teach them to Mr A, because one can teach them to Mr B. What makes the discussion of teaching metaphor to A and B even more unconvincing is that neither of these gentlemen is a very good example of intellectual prowess. Any one of us could put on airs when comparing himself to the dogged but dimwitted Mr A. Nor is Mr B, the 'fairly sensitive' language-user, much more impressive. True, people in general cannot be expected to share a linguistic capacity greater than that of Mr B; this follows by definition. But each person or group of people can be counted on to possess a great many capacities which are not part of the common store, but which have been developed through conditioning in a certain culture, perhaps, or through particular experiences or special training. Often the understanding of expressions requires capacities which are rare and skills which are hard to achieve. Special qualities of maturity may be called for, for example, or a special pattern of behaviour understood. (The 1 Alston, Philosophy of Language, p. 97. In what follows this phrase will be understood not only to characterise the person to whom Alston is explaining metaphors, but also to define the limits of such a person's capacity to grasp metaphors. Whether Alston would in fact be happy with these limits is uncertain; very likely he would not, but he does not make clear what additional capacities the person should have. By defining 'Mr B' narrowly, as we do here, we put ourselves in a position to ask Alston just what other capacities might be helpful for the understanding of a metaphor besides those indicated by this phrase.</page><page sequence="10">364 ANDREW J. BURGESS former causes problems in the understanding of some poetry, while the latter accounts for the difficulty a person may have in understanding a joke in a foreign language.) Religious discussion frequently calls upon these extra resources in a particularly urgent way. It demands a degree of discernment and maturity, a familiarity with a pattern of life and hope, and a knowledge of historical detail-to say nothing of convictions-which cannot be assumed in the hearer unless he is a member of that faith and often not even then. All of this means, of course, that many expressions which require special capacities are going to be frequently misunderstood, or at least very in completely understood. Some poetic images may yield us a mere glimmer of insight; expressions reflecting cultural differences frustrate us in un expected ways; religious disagreements continue to baffle us by the way the disputants talk past each other. We do not need to rest easily with these misunderstandings; rather we should look for ways to overcome them. But only confusion results when we try to get around these misunder standings by postulating a minimum intellect (a 'Mr A') who has only those resources for understanding which practically everyone shares. People differ, and the kinds of explanations which help them differ as well. 2. The logic of metaphor The issues at stake here have to do not just with difficulties in under standing this metaphor or that, but with the logic of the literal/metaphorical distinction itself. Both Henle and Alston provide helpful remarks at several points about the conditions for understanding metaphors, especially poetic metaphors. The problem is that their theory of metaphor slights the logical significance of variations from person to person in the conditions under which metaphors are understood. What is proposed here instead is that wherever there is the danger of conceptual confusion we be reminded that a metaphor includes a reference to the person for whom it is a metaphor. (This reminder might take the form, for example, of saying that the expres sion is 'metaphorical, for Mr A. under circumstances x, y, z'.) Such a reminder would be trivial when describing a dead metaphor such as 'hood of a car', but it might be critically important when dealing with the logic of many puzzling expressions in philosophy and theology. Unless the varia tion in conditions is noticed, it is hard to see how it comes to be that an expression which is 'metaphorical' in the context of one discussion may be 'established' in another. The mistake in isolating a metaphor from its context can perhaps be illuminated by looking at a parallel discussion by J. R. Lucas on the concept of fact.' Lucas begins by an imaginary situation in which people are engaged I J. R. Lucas, 'On not Worshipping Facts', Philosophical Quarterly, VIII (1958), pp. 144-56.</page><page sequence="11">IRREDUCIBLE RELIGIOUS METAPHORS 365 in dialogue on some topic. The 'facts' to which they make appeal, and on which they do not find any reason to dispute, are those matters which can simply be taken for granted in this situation, on this topic, and with the purpose for which the discussion is being carried on. For example, when groups of historians are discussing Greek history some of them may appeal to the 'fact' of the date of Salamis. This does not mean that the date of this battle cannot be disputed, but merely that it is not to the point to dispute it in the particular discussion at hand. Another discussion may subsequently be held in which the date of Salamis is cast into question and other 'facts' are brought to bear to decide it. The mistake in a fruitless search for 'bare facts' may lie in a misunder standing of the function of a fact in an argument. To call some statement a 'fact' is often to draw attention to the way in which in a particular context it can be assumed. When someone tries to expand the concept of fact and demands 'facts' which will hold good for any discussion between any parti cipants on any topic for any purpose, the grammar of one of the main senses of the term 'fact' is twisted all out of shape. What Lucas is saying here about the context-relatedness of the concept of fact applies also to the concept of literal discourse. Which expressions have 'literal' meaning-that is, 'established sense'-depends often upon who is using the expression, where, and why. Disregarding this interpersonal context for metaphors easily leads one to demand that metaphors be understandable by anyone in any discussion. This means that the explanation for a metaphor must make sense to the lowest common denominator in intellects-the man whom we have dubbed 'Mr A'. I do not know whether it is possible to explain the sense of 'God is punishing me' to this person. If one ever met such a person, it would be challenging to try. But it does not seem very profitable as a general rule to gear one's explanations of theological expressions to someone of such a restricted mentality. Historians must experience a similar sense of frustration to that of theo logians in such a discussion when they meet with someone who will not take as a fact any event which might be questioned by another historian. If it should turn out that he is not just prejudiced or naive, but that he is so curiously constituted as to be quite unable to be certain of an event which any historian would ever question, then he would be a menace and a bore in historical discussions. There may be a connexion between unquestionable historical data and the date of Salamis, but it is not a very obvious one. If this person cannot accept the date of Salamis without having that connexion made explicit to him, his future as an historian looks so dim that it hardly seems worthwhile to try talking to him much further. And the fact that historians may not see their way to trace such a connexion need not make them worry about the 'quasi-unfactual' status of their subject matter.</page><page sequence="12">366 ANDREW J. BURGESS 3. Conclusion The moral of the preceding reflections is a warning against the dangers of insisting on explanations of expressions of religious faith which will work equally well for any person-or for any sensitive language-user-or (following a long-standing philosophical tradition) for 'the reasonable man.' Such a moral may appear to be the height of irrationality. How can an explanation which does not work for every man really be an explanation for anyone? Perhaps here is to be found one of the underlying reasons for the age-old distrust of metaphorical language by many philosophers; good metaphors are seldom appropriated in the same manner and depth by all men or even all equally intelligent men. On this account of religious metaphor, however, the task of explanation does not become easier than before but rather far more formidable. Neither an analysis which demands that all respectable metaphors be universally explicable, nor one which defends metaphors in terms of flashes of insight, can do justice to the complexity of the situation. Somehow one has to fit the explanation of the religious metaphors to the particular capacities, community traditions, and experiences of the questioners. There is no guarantee that the project will be successful; instead, there is the certainty of a high percentage of failure. But once one has recognised the need to take the others' condition into account one has at least placed the logical difficulty in the proper place.</page></plain_text>
