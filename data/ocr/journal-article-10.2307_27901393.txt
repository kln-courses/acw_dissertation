<plain_text><page sequence="1">IMPLICATION, MODALITY AND INTENSION IN SYMBOLIC LOGIC1 AN IMPORTANT focus of dissension in the more logi cal portions of modern mathematical logic has un doubtedly been the notion of implication. The term is one which has always been used by philosophers to stand for the fundamental connective tissue in all systematic thought, but with few exceptions it has remained a logical simple withstanding all formal analysis.2 However, therefore, we regard Mr. Russell's attempt in Principia Mathematica to define implication, it can hardly be doubted that, taken with the numerous logical repercussions his effort has in spired,3 it has had the prime philosophic significance of re vealing several larger problems involved in its analysis and of furnishing the crucial test in their solution. More particularly, the status of modality and intension in formal logic has been found to be intimately associated with the question of implication, and the ultimate metaphysical af finities of these notions have been transferred to symbolic iRead before the Charles Sanders Peirce Mathematical Logic Society of Baltimore. The author is especially indebted to Dr. Albert E. Blumberg for valuable criticisms and suggestions, 2Even as late as the Principles of Mathematics (1903) Mr. Russell states: "A definition of implication is quite impossible. If p implies q, then if p is true, q is true, i.e., p's truth implies q's truth ; also if q is false, p is false, i.e., q's falsehood implies p's falsehood" (p. 14). 3Perhaps the more important of these are the following: A series of articles by Prof. C.

Now it appears to me that while neither Mr. Russell nor his intensionalist opposition has adequately treated the issues concerning implication, so that many of the fun damentals have been clouded by essentially verbal con fusions, the odium of this controversy rests largely with the opponents of Principia Mathematica. The immediately ob vious departure from the ordinary use of words in Mr. Russell's formulation of material implication has all too hastily been taken to be an oversight warranting the con struction of "alternative" intensional systems supposedly more applicable to common usage. The reasons for this departure, and the possibility that traditional prescription might be provided for by various additional notions which Mr. Russell employs, have not generally been given full consideration. The purpose of this paper is to suggest a theory of im plication, based essentially on Principia Mathematica, which, by clarifying the relevance of intension and modal ity to implication, will comply both with the requirements of mathematical logistic and the demands of "ordinary" inference. I The usual procedure of opponents of the use of impli cation in Principia Mathematica is first to remark the radi cal divergence in chapters *i -*5 from the common mean ing of "implies," then to assume that since the same horse shoe sign is employed throughout, the whole Principia is constructed on the basis of material implication alone, and finally to conclude that while all this may be perfectly un objectionable on its own grounds, those of a calculus not relevant to the usual trains of valid thought, it is not de</page><page sequence="3">IMPLICATION, MODALITY AND INTENSION 121 monstrated, in the accepted sense of that word, that the theorems of Principia Mathematica have been deduced from the primitive propositions.4 A necessary consequence of this is that the Principia is neither logical nor a work of logic.5 It is of course clear that material implication alone does not validate ordinary inference. The interminable bicker ing on this point can be settled by pointing to the simple but amazingly overlooked fact that it is a first principle of the classical logic that no inference is possible without universal propositions.6 Universal propositions embody formal implications, and are treated in chapters *8, *9 and *io of the Principia. Hence the question of the agreement of that work with ordinary usage cannot be decided by confining one's attention to chapters *i-*5, as many philo sophic critics of that work seem to do. I wish to show that when attention is directed to later portions of the Princi pia, ordinary usage is amply provided for, and that con sequently supposedly alternative intensional logics are both formally superfluous and, when the liberty is taken to an alyze their indefinables, reducible to the logic of Principia Mathematica. I shall use the system of Professor C. I. Lewis, perhaps the leading American exponent of both in tension and relativity in formal logic, to illustrate this the sis.7 It is possible to simplify that system in a fashion similar to that of the Sheffer-Nicod simplification of the Prin 4E.g" Lewis, 1917 Jour. Phil, p. 253. 5 This is plainly suggested by Smart, 1932 Phil. Rev., p. 61. ^Certainly this is the case with all syllogism, since the first rule of the first figure, to which all the other figures may be reduced, is that the major premise must be universal. Whatever exceptions have been adduced to this principle, such as arguments a fortiori or those containing only singular propositions, are either readily disposed of or are treated in later portions of Principia Mathematica.

Professor Sheffer sub stituted the single notion of incompatibility for the two in definables of the first edition of the Principia, negation and disjunction. This may be called material incompatibility. Similarly, what I shall name strict incompatibility can sub stitute in Lewis' system for his two additional indefinables, impossibility and conjunction. Using both simplifications, the definitions of the eight truth and modal functions in that system may be expressed entirely in terms of the two sorts of incompatibility. With the stroke, | , representing material incompatibility, and the arrow, strict incom functions they are: Strict Impossibility Strict Implication Relations : ^p . = .p ^ p p&lt;^q-.p + (q\q) Material Negation Material Implication Relations : -p.=.p j p pc q.=.p\(q\q) Strict Logical sum Consistency Relations: pAq.=.(p\p) +(q\q) poq.=.(p fq)\(p+q) Material Logical sum Logical Product Relations: P+q.=.(p\p)\(q\q) P q.=-(p\q)\(P\q) 9 The distribution of the strokes and arrows in these formulae shows clearly that what makes Lewis' system relevant to what is usually known as inference, and Rus sell's calculus of elementary propositions not so applicable, is either the notion of modality which the former introduces or some equivalent of that notion. What this equivalent 8C/. Principia Mathematica, second edition, pp. xvi ff. This work will hereafter be indicated by P. M.

A similar reduction of the primitive propositions of Lewis' system to one, corresponding to M. Nicod's for P.M. is of course pos sible. But such simplifications are not as important as Mr. Russell takes them to be (cf. Wittgenstein, Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, 6.1271).</page><page sequence="5">IMPLICATION, MODALITY AND INTENSION I2 is could be discovered by analyzing the possible uses of impossibility and necessity in the system of strict implica tion ; but such analysis is rendered superfluous by the most recent statement of Professor Lewis. He says explicitly that "formal implication, (x).^xr&gt;^x, would coincide in its general deductive significance with strict implication" if formal implication is interpreted, as Lewis does not believe Principia Mathematica to interpret it, as dealing with "all possible or conceivable x."10 Accordingly, "p strictly im plies q" should be rendered X:(X).4&gt;XZD$X:'Z&gt; Ax.11 If this be granted, it is only consistent and unambiguous to treat all modal propositions or relations in Lewis' system in the same fashion, since they have formally been shown to de pend on the single notion of strict incompatibility. And when this is done, it is possible to show how every theorem of Lewis' system can be converted into an actual or pos sible theorem of Principia Mathematica, much as every theorem in two-dimensional Lobachevskian or Riemannian geometry can be converted into a theorem in three-dimen sional Euclidean geometry. The transformation formulae required are the following: (1) p=&lt;l&gt;x; q=tx; not-/&gt;=~&lt;kr; not-q-^x. (2) &lt;( asserted )=z&gt; (asserted). (3) p is impossible =$x:(X).$XZD^&lt;bx: =&gt;Ax.

The problem of the range of x will be con sidered in part II of this paper. HThis further transition is justified by a remark of Lewis in the Survey, p. 332, that a formal implication, though it cannot state a strict implication, does nevertheless "lie behind" and "support" such an implication. (Cf. also pp. 321 and 335.) The asserted implication is material, for the reason that if it were another strict implication an infinite regress of formal implications would necessarily occur. For if a formal implication "lies behind" one strict implication, it should consistently "lie behind" every strict implication.</page><page sequence="6">124 THE MONIST (8) pis consistent with q =4&gt;x : ( 3 x) .4&gt;XZD^X : ID .tx.12 Thus are redefined the five truth and modal values of Lewis' system and all the dyadic relations involving no tions of modality. All the remaining primitive ideas and definitions are to be found in the system of material impli cation. This transformation has significant bearings on two important questions, those of relativity and intension in logic. The vast majority of the theorems converted by means of these formulae do not actually appear in Principia Mathematica. They are as unnecessary for the authors' purposes as they are practically unimportant. This part of Lewis' system can best be viewed as an extension of the system of the Principia by means of the familiar mathe matical process of substituting a single symbol for a com plex. This substitution makes manipulation and the de duction of new theorems much simpler, and the possibility of an indefinite extension of this sort is theoretically sig nificant, but in no strictly logical sense can the system of Professor Lewis be viewed as an "alternative" system il lustrating the relativity or "pragmatism" of formal logic. Within pure mathematics, it is unmeaning to speak of al ternative geometries ; it is only in their application to the physical world that one chooses, for extra-mathematical l2Formulae 7 and 8 may perhaps be clearer if it is remembered that theorem 4.22 in Lewis' system defines "either p or q must be true" as "not-/&gt; strictly implies q"; and that theorem 4.26 in his system defines "p is consistent with q" as "it is false that p strictly implies not-g," which universal nega tive becomes by definition (P.M. *10.01) the particular affirmative. It should be pointed out that this last step, like formula 5, is legitimate only if "There exists an x such that" refers to logical, and not physical or men tal, existence. Whether this is what P.M. does mean by ( 3x) is a somewhat complicated question, and will receive consideration in another study on the meaning of mathematical existence. It should also be noticed that in reason ing about entities which have logical but not physical or mental existence the ordinary meanings of "true" and "false" are radically altered. Cf. below, part III of this paper.</page><page sequence="7">IMPLICATION, MODALITY AND INTENSION 125 reasons, one or the other formulation.13 Similarly, it is not in formal logic that systems are relative, but in the selec tion, for extra-logical reasons, of some phase of formal logic to apply to human thinking or some other aspect of existence. But while Einstein at least has found it conveni ent in his physics to employ non-Euclidean geometry, there is not likely to arise, because of an inherent ambiguity in the system which I shall later indicate, any occasion in pure or applied logic which will necessitate the employment of Lewis' formulation. These remarks can be generalized by considering an associated attempt to establish a reign of relativity within logic. Following Mr. Lewis' conception of a number of al ternative formal systems, self-consistent but inconsistent with each other, Professor Weiss has indicated the true nature of fourteen such systems. Their "relativity" con sists in a different definition of "implication" for each of them. Thus, by applying the name implication to what is usually called incompatibility, a true proposition will "im ply" a false proposition, and two true propositions will be "incompatible." But that the nature of these logical opera tions will be one whit changed by such linguistic realloca tion would be an utterly amazing contention.14 The sole logical significance of such procedure is that it may indicate that Principia Mathematica is not theorem atically complete. This is partly because the Principia has concerned itself chiefly with certain truth-functions like 13Poincar , Science and Hypothesis, ch. 3; Cohen, Reason and Nature, pp. 176-77. l*Cf. Weiss, "Relativity in Logic," 1928 Monist, pp. 536 ff. Mr. Weiss does suggest that this relativity is purely verbal and that his fourteen "alter native" systems are intertranslatable. But why call such systems either al ternative or systems of logic? In the same fashion, by interchanging the basic physical units like "mass," "length," and "time," a striking array of "al ternative" physics could easily be manufactured. Precisely these considera tions apply to the recent article of Professor Lewis ("Alternative Systems of Logic," 1932 Monist, pp. 481 ff.), in which verbal ambiguity is very sys tematically treated as logical "relativity."</page><page sequence="8">126 THE MONIST material implication and equivalence to the neglect of others like incompatibility and rejection, and partly because before Wittgenstein's simplification of the logic of material implication there had been no way of approximating the number of possible theorems a material logic with a given number of terms could possess.15 Chapters *i-*5 of Prin cipia Mathematica contain about two hundred theorems. "Alternative" material logics simply supply part of the many remaining possible theorems under their wrong names. Thus, p \ q. \.p.q (p's incompatibility with q is incompatible with p's compatibility with q) is a valid tau tology which does not appear in the first edition of the Principia. Following Professor Weiss and calling incom patibility implication we obtain pZDq.zD .p.q, which of course is false if implication means what it does in the Principia, but obviously quite true and identical with our original theorem if, as is the case, what is meant by im plication is incompatibility. Similarly, the paradoxical sys tems of Professor Lewis16 depend on some such postulate, as the following: p^q.zi .^pzD^q. Here the minor implication signs are employed as they are in Mr. Lewis' remaining postulates, to stand for material implication. The asserted implication, however, is really a disjunction. By using the same sign for disjunction and implication, 15Wittgenstein has indicated that the logic of material implication con sists in the tautological combination of truth-functions. There are 2* com binations, /, of the two truth values of k propositions. Excluding tautology and contradiction, there are 2'-2 truth-functions, m, defined by the rn* pos sible truth operations upon /. The theorems of logic are constructed by means of operations tautologically combining these m truth-functions with each other. Since any truth operation can be indefinitely repeated, there is no limit to the number of possible tautologies which can be produced. Restricting our selves to the simplest case, that of a single operation, each of the m truth functions can be combined with any other by m' truth operations, i.e. M-m^m' or M=w3. Of these M combinations, however, only the tautological combin ations can be theorems of logic. For two propositions and one operation, M is 2744 and the number of tautologies 228. The latter figure is empirically established. To determine a formula whereby the number of tautologies for any number of propositions and operations could be derived would be an interesting field for mathematical study. IGMind and the World Order, p. 209.</page><page sequence="9">IMPLICATION, MODALITY AND INTENSION I2J Professor Lewis manages to obtain a queer aggregation of "logics," but these would no more be alternative logics than the arithmetic generated by the stipulation that two and two are five would be an alternative arithmetic. Any vari ation of a truth-function is another truth-function. The manipulation of one as if it were the other may indeed be a pleasant occupation, but the confusion in which it throws the logical structure is entirely apparent. Alternative formal logics are the imaginary echoes of purely verbal whims. Similar considerations hold with respect to intension. Of the latter's role in logic I shall treat below ; but it is per tinent here to indicate that either Professor Lewis' system is no more intensional than the Principia or else my trans formation is illegitimate. Accepting for the moment the position that the practical test of intension in a formal sys tem is its applicability to ordinary inference,17 I should like to affirm the first alternative by showing that the system of strict implication fails to conform to ordinary usage only insofar as it cannot be translated into the logic of Principia Mathematica. The crucial tests of Lewis' system so to conform are the two propositions 3.52 and 3.55:18 (1) 3.52. ^/&gt;&lt;(/&gt;&lt;#). "If p is impossible, then p strictly implies any prop osition g." (2) 3.55. ^-/&gt;&lt;(?&lt;/0-"If P ls necessarily true, then p is strictly implied by any proposition g." By the transformation formulae, these become, in the sym bolism of the Principia : (3) 3-52- xl/x:(x).txzD^&lt;f&gt;x:zD&lt;l&gt;x:.zD :&lt;l&gt;x.(x) AXZD^X:ZD^X (4) 3-55- tx:(x) .tx ID tx: ZD tx:.ID :tx.

Eaton, General Logic, pp. 231-34; Baylis, oe. cit.</page><page sequence="10">128 THE MONIST Now all (3) and (4) assert is that a contradiction mater ially implies a necessary truth, and that a necessary truth materially implies a necessary truth, which is not in the least paradoxical. It might accordingly be maintained that my transformation formulae are illegitimate. But that they are based on a consistent interpretation of Professor Lewis' system can be indicated by an analysis of his peculiar in definable, impossibility. If one is so presumptuous as to seek to interpret the primitive ideas of the system of strict implication, one will find there five possible distinct ways in which Profes sor Lewis can use the notions of impossibility and neces ity, of which he employs at least four. ( 1 ) Absolutely, as applying to all propositions independently of their impli cative relations to other propositions, in which case a direct insight into apodicticity on the part of the reader must be assumed. Thus, Descartes' "I am" would be necessary.19 (2)Relatively, as applying to propositions in certain part part implicative relations to other propositions, so that, e.g., the conclusion of a syllogism is necessary and its con tradictory impossible. (3) Absolutely, but applying to the implicative relation between parts in certain prepositional wholes. This use of necessity would correspond most close ly to Moore's indefinable relation of entailment.20 (4) Ab solutely, applying to the prepositional whole of which some part may be affirmed to be relatively necessary or impossible. Thus, an entire hypothetical syllogism can be deemed necessary. (5) Absolutely, referring to the ex haustive disjunction (necessity) or the contradictory con junction (impossibility) of propositions of any order. 19So, indeed, Mr. Lewis seems to think (Survey, p. 304). But clearly, not even in a metaphysics of absolute physical determinism, is this oroposi tion by itself logically necessary. What is so necessary is that "if I think, and if whoever thinks is, then I am"; or better, since one can similarly in fer one's existence from one's much more common failure to think, "I am, and I sometimes think: therefore I am." I shall not consider this use seriously. 20C7. Moore, loc. cit.</page><page sequence="11">IMPLICATION, MODALITY AND INTENSION I2g Evidence for the second use is found in the deliberate analogy of Lewis' system with the logic of elementary prop ositions in the Principia, so that, e.g., "p is false" is the analogue of "p is impossible." Since no uncompounded ele mentary proposition, if the first use is rejected, can be either necessary or impossible by and in itself, the treat ment of such propositions as necessary or impossible must clearly be done relative to a set of other propositions. The third interpretation is employed in the definition of strict implication, which becomes a necessary connection the op posite of which is impossible. Finally, since any compound of propositions is itself a proposition, uses four and five are readily seen to be also involved in the notions of neces sary and impossible propositions. Now under any of these uses except the first, the propo sitions "p is necessary" and "p is impossible" are of a dif ferent order (i.e. involve additional propositions) than any single proposition p. The proposition "p is necessary," treated formally, is itself a theorem of logic; it can stand on its own feet. The proposition "p is impossible," treated formally, can be seen to be impossible because it contra dicts that theorem of logic. This difference of order is shown in the transformation ; it is not indicated in Lewis* system. If this difference of order be granted, theorems 3.52 and 3.55 cannot be interpreted as Lewis interprets them. To indicate this difference they must be rendered (in terms of strict implication) as "If the proposition cp is impossi ble' is true, then some other proposition p strictly implies q"; and "If the proposition ?p is necessary' is true, then some proposition q will strictly imply some other propo sition p." This is, in fact, just what the transformed the orems do show when interpreted as in use two. It was following Mr. Lewis' own suggestion that I</page><page sequence="12">130 THE MONIST chose that use as the fundamental one in his logic, and the consequent incorporation of the system of strict implica tion into the logic of Principia Mathematica serves not only to indicate the unity of all formal logic but also in cidentally to eliminate the peculiar features of that sys tem which have been held to make it inapplicable to ordi nary usage. II In the transformation of Professor Lewis' system to that of the Principia it is significant to notice that the role of modality has shifted from an original emphasis upon impossibility and necessity to one upon the notion of pos sibility. The validity of my reduction would thus depend for Mr. Lewis on the stipulation that the range of the ar guments in a formal implication shall not be restricted to actuality. With this I should agree, but I cannot follow Professor Lewis in his opinion that Principia Mathematica does so restrict the range of such arguments-although it is quite clear that Mr. Russell does not care to mention the fact any more than he can possibly help.21 In any case, 21 Mr. Russell's attitude toward possibility is perhaps typical of his meta physical variations. In the Principles of Mathematics (1903) he declares, "In every proposition of pure mathematics, when fully stated, the variables have an absolutely unrestricted field; any conceivable entity may be substituted for any one of our variables without impairing the truth of our proposi tions" (p. 7). This clearly reflects the Platonic realism of Mr. G. E. Moore, which furnished the philosophic inspiration for the Principles (cf. the pre face). Later in that work, however, Mr. Russell is found saying: "There seems to be no true proposition of which there is any sense in saying that it might have been false. What is true, is true; what is false, is false; and concerning fundamentals, there is nothing more to be said" (p. 454). In P.M. _( 1910) Mr. Russell affirms in the Introduction that "a formal implica tion states that, for all possible values of x, if the hypothesis &lt;t&gt;x is true, the conclusion \J/X is true" (pp. 15, 21). Yet in the body of that work the primi tive idea taken for a prepositional function is *%x always" (p. 127) and no specific mention is made of possibility. That notion is mentioned, however, in the primitive proposition *9.13; but in the second edition (1925) that primi tive proposition is dropped. In Our Knowledge of the External World ( 1914) Mr. Russell states that a general truth of logic "is wholly independent of the accidental facts of the existent world" (p. 61). Similarly, in the Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy (1919) Mr. Russell observes that "pure logic aims at being true, in Leibnizian terminology, in all possible worlds, not only in this higgledy-piggledy job-lot of a world in which chance has imprisoned us" (p. 192). Yet this hardly jibes with the oft-repeated remark some twenty</page><page sequence="13">IMPLICATION, MODALITY AND INTENSION I3I I believe that this notion of what I shall call extensive pos sibility is indispensable for formal logic I wish according ly to analyze its nature, and more especially its relation to implication. It is desirable at the outset to make some required ter minological distinctions. We must distinguish between extensive, exhaustive, and particular possibility. I know of no philosophically satisfactory definition of extensive possibility, but it is the notion involved when we speak of "all possible values of x" Exhaustive possibility is the notion involved in such statements as "There are n possi bilities," and is logically expressible in a complete disjunc tion; e.g. the expression " 'p and q' or 'not-/? and q' or (p and not-q' or 'not-p and not-g' " states the possible com binations of negation and conjunction in two propositions. A particular possibility is any term or terms of such an exhaustive disjunction. From this it follows that any prop osition or propositional function not containing a contra diction is possible, since all such propositions or proposi tional functions can be instances of a term (or terms) of the principle of excluded middle, (p) -py^p. This more or less classical view is in opposition to Mr. Russell's account of possibility, which declares possibility to be a character istic of a propositional function which is sometimes true.23 According to such a view, "x will fly around the world in six days" would be impossible, since it has never been true ; and if Mr. Russell were to say that it might be true, he pages back: "Logic, I should maintain, must no more admit a unicorn than zoology can; for logic is concerned with the real world just as truly as zoology, though with its more abstract and general features" (p. 169). The recurrent modification of Mr. Russell's initial Platonism can be traced to his difficulties with the theory of types, the theory of descriptions, and to an increasing positivistic strain in his metaphysical thought. Our analysis of possibility in symbolic logic must clearly proceed without reference to Mr. Russell's immediate opinions. 22(7/. 1908 Amer. J. Math., p. 230; Introduction to Mathematical Philoso phy, p. 166.</page><page sequence="14">132 THE MONIST would be employing the very notion of possibility he is here denying.23 Now any concrete exhaustive possibility is of the same form as some formal disjunction which holds for all pos sible values of its constituent variables. This is formally expressed in the statement that an exhaustive possibility of n terms is an instance of the general law of excluded -fi. Thus, "a proposition is either true or false" is it self but an instance of the more general law of excluded third. Any principle of logic is the fusion of an extensive and an exhaustive possibility ; and while the principle may be extensive because it is exhaustive, i.e. excludes no pos sibilities, the fact that it is so is an additional fact not stat able in terms of exhaustive possibility. It is this very fact, indeed, which constitutes the fundamental metaphysical significance and practical applicability of formal logic. We have now to inquire into the logical indispensabil ity of the notion which I hope I have distinguished from others bearing the same name. For formal logic it is, I should say, absurd to inquire whether the values of any variable in a logical formula are all the actual values or all the possible ones. Certainly it is an arbitrary linguis tic resolution to speak of all the actual values of (x,y) .x-\-y=yj-x. Mr. Russell, however, at times seems clearly to suggest that it is the business of formal logic to deal with propositions of the form &lt; a, where a is de fined to be an individual, something given in sensation, or, more generally, anything which can be the subject of an 23This treatment of logical possibility points to a more significant practi cal meaning of particular possibility and impossibility. Practically, possibil ity and impossibility are relative to a given context. Any proposition not counter to the general rules or leading principles of a sphere of discourse is possible in that context. Thus, certain propositions logically possible are physically impossible; numerous of our everyday opinions are found to be impossible if certain facts are true; and the impossibility of certain people is-alas!-too frequently impressed upon us. But the complete statement of the conditions of this practical possibility must always conform to the logical definition of particular possibility.</page><page sequence="15">IMPLICATION, MODALITY AND INTENSION 133 elementary proposition.24 Here, assuredly, it seems some what more cogent to speak of all the actual values of an x. But as we have seen Mr. Russell himself to assert, the statement that there is a world is not a part of formal logic. The hierarchy of types which Principia Mathe matica formulates is for logic only a relative hierarchy, as Mr. Russell very frequently realizes.25 Even to start with the world of atomic facts, in Wittgenstein's sense, is to be motivated by metaphysical and epistemological con siderations which are strictly speaking irrelevant to formal logic. With this, the case for extensive possibility in formal logic should rest. But we have yet to consider Mr. Lewis' problem regarding the range of the arguments in formal implications, which are not logical formulae but general propositions about fact. The first thing to remark is that a collective enumeration is not a formal implication; it is best treated as the logical product of a series of elemen tary propositions. On the other hand, it is the essence of a formal implication to transcend the given data. Such are the empirical laws of science. The question regarding the range of the arguments in a formal implication, therefore, is whether by possible arguments is meant only such en tities as exist, have existed, and will exist, or what might be called the total actual, or whether what is meant is something more. It should be observed that if "exist" here refers to tem poral existence, non-temporal entities are excluded from formal implications. Hence such statements as "All formal implications which can be used in inference involve elements of identity" are themselves not formal implica tions, and some other classification will be necessary to in clude them. Similarly, any restriction upon the range of 24p.Afv pp. xix, 91. 25cy. 1908 Amer. J. Math., p. 237; P.M., pp. 163-65.</page><page sequence="16">134 THE MONIST the arguments in a formal implication will automatically generate another type of formal implication. The formal implication defined to hold for all possible values of its ar guments would be the prototype of all of these. If the meaning of existence, on the other hand, is not so re stricted, it then coincides with what is here meant by the possible. The chimerical belief that the concept "total ac tuar' or "existence for every moment of time"26 is a clearer notion than that of extensive possibility is based on the unfortunate reification of possibility by metaphoric ration alists and their too literal interpreters into a "realm" with pseudo-spatial dimensions. Once this is foregone, and pos sibility is treated logically rather than cosmologically, much of the weight of the pragmatic and empiricist argu ment is lost. Accordingly, I shall accept the notion of extensive pos sibility as indefinable and ultimate for logic. Every ap pearance of the generality parenthesis in the remainder of this paper should therefore be interpreted as referring to all (or some) possible values of the variable in ques tion.27 III The importance of the notion of extensive possibility is best indicated in practice. I propose to show how the va rious types of implication to be found in Principia Mathe matica can be interpreted in terms of material implication and extensive possibility, and how such an interpretation provides for traditional and practical usage without ap peal to some mysterious intensional connection of mean ing. 26S. Hook, The Metaphysics of Pragmatism, p. 121. 27This formulation suggests the difficulties connected with the theory of types; but since it neither increases nor diminishes them, I shall ignore this aspect of the subject. For attempts to eliminate the need for the theory, however, cf. H. C. Brown, 1911 Jour. Phil., pp. 85 ff; Wittgenstein, Tracta tes, 3.331-3.333; Ramsey, Foundations of Mathematics, pp. 20-21, 40-49; P. Weiss, 1928 Mind, pp. 338 ff.</page><page sequence="17">IMPLICATION, MODALITY AND INTENSION 135 Following Mr. Russell, material implication is the rela tion between any two propositions of any order such that at least one of them (the implicans) is false or at least one of them (the implicate) is true. My thesis with regard to material implication is that while it is by itself insufficient for inference, it is nevertheless, strictly speaking, the only implicative relation between propositions. To justify this position it is essential to examine the other forms of im plication. For inference, furthermore, containing as it does a psychologic element, it is sufficient that propositions be taken to be true or false, as the case may be. Some such distinction between actual material implication and men tally entertained material implication is clearly necessary for the theory of inference, since a proposition may be as serted to be true or false regardless of which of these al ternatives holds in fact. Not only are error and mendacity entirely human attributes-not to speak of higher politics and international diplomacy-but in addition science as we know it would be impossible were it not able to test the conclusions of materially false hypotheses as if they were true.28 Similarly, it is this ability of man to treat propositions and their functions as if they were what they are not which we have seen to be at the basis of the sup posed relativity in logic. Finally, it is this distinction be tween logical relations which hold whether we wish them to or not and logical relations which hold in fancy as if they held in fact that enables us to provide a satisfactory solution to the problem of intension in logic. That problem has rarely, to my knowledge, been clearly 28The formal validity of such procedure rests on the fact that for formal logic it is irrelevant what constitutes truth or falsity (cf. P. M., Ap pendix C, pp. 660-61). Any pair of exclusive alternatives would do just as well as "true" and "false," and "taken to be true" and "taken to be false" are-or for valid reasoning have to be-just such a pair. For the psychologic necessity of this particular pair, cf. a note by Frege in 1912 Quar. Jour. Pure and App. Math., pp. 240-41.</page><page sequence="18">136 THE MONIST stated. The question, What is the role of intension in formal logic ? is not the same as the question, What is the function of intension in reasoning and judgment? If "in tension" is to stand for the signification of a term, it has long been a truism that intension and extension are inex tricably associated in judgment.29 But if the term inten sion is itself to have any constant signification, it is not applicable to formal logic. The latter, while it must, to be at all relevant to human thought, provide for the pos sibility of intension in its application, has otherwise nothing whatever to do with it. Intension, like pragma tism and relativity in logic, is confined to the realm of the "taken to be," to the sphere of logical reasoning, not to the objective logical structure which is the validation of that reasoning. Within a logic the range of whose va riables is construed in terms of extensive possibility, the distinction between extension and intension is a trivial one ;30 while in the application of that logic the unrestricted 29(7/. Bradley, Principles of Logic, Bk. I, Ch. 6, and (second edition) Terminal Essay III. For an excellent epistemological approach, cf. Mind and the World Order, esp. ch. 3 and 9. 30To indicate this, consider the following use of "intension" by Mr. H. N. Lee: "The notation of mathematics and logic has meaning, but this meaning is pure intension; it is intrasystemare" (1931 Monist, p. 605). Thus, it would be the necessary intensional meaning of not-p to be the contradictory of p, etc. By this is meant, I suppose, that since (p). p=,-O^p), and since this holds universally, there is a necessary intensional connection between antecedent and consequent in this proposition; and simi larly in all the other propositions of logic. This is extensionally expressed by the statement that such propositions hold for all possible values of their variables. To call this state of affairs "pure intension" or "sheer extension" is therefore equally significant. There is a common view that associates extension in logic with empiri cal extensionality. Thus Mr. Joseph (Aristotelean Society, etc., lo c. cit.) would confine extensional logic to enumerated classes or values. But it is difficult to see how such a definition could be either significant or useful in formal logic. Such usage could only be relevant in considering the ex tension of some particular judgment or of the classes employed therein. In formal logic, extension means simply the treatment of a function or variable in terms of its possible values. An examination of the multitudes of mean ings of the terms "intension" and "extension" substantiates the confine ment of the relevance of their distinction to judgment and not formal logic. Cf. C. S. Peirce, "Upon Logical Comprehension and Extension," Pr oe. Amer. A cad. Arts and Sciences, 1867, pp. 412 ff. It should also be remarked that Mr. Russell is himself not altogether consistent on this point. Thus, cf. P.M. p. 59 n. and pp. 72-74.</page><page sequence="19">IMPLICATION, MODALITY AND INTENSION 137 nature of possibility provides for whatever intensional connection of meaning is in fact postulated. The problem of intension in formal implication is some what different. Here n properties may either be defined to be invariably associated, in which event the formal impli cation ceases to be a proposition which can be true or false and becomes a resolution about the use of words ; or the properties may be declared to be invariably associated. In actual thought these two procedures are combined. Clear ly, by no empirical means can we establish the truth of a formal implication ; yet the high probability or plausibility of some such implications imparts a psychologic bond of a priori necessity between antecedent and consequent which makes us prefer, to give James' words a somewhat different context, "to risk the loss of truth than chance of error." Now the intensional and pragmatic resolution to employ in reasoning words with certain significations and to shun the chance of error is not within the scope of formal logic either to describe or prescribe. Its task is solely to indicate the objective relations between prepo sitional forms which serve to validate such reasoning. And whether it is by intensional formal definition or ex tensional empirical generalization that a universal state ment is made, the logical form of that statement is the same in both cases. The difference between them is in a psychologic attitude, not in formal logic. It is the orig inal failure to distinguish between "implication" as a men tal process, and implication as an invariant relation be tween propositions logically validating that process, which is at the root of the difficulties concerning this subject. In tensionally, pragmatically, subjectively, a logical ante cedent is the sufficient condition of its consequent, and a logical consequent the necessary condition of its antece dent, if the formal implication in which they occur is taken</page><page sequence="20">138 THE MONIST to be true. Extensionally, objectively, formally, these necessary and sufficient conditions hold when the impli cation in question is true. And in this sense, for mortal man, there is no such necessity. As Hobbes long ago pointed out, "no discourse whatsoever can end in absolute knowledge of [experiential] fact."31 A more detailed analysis of formal implication is, how ever, necessary to determine whether it can in fact pro vide for intensional connection in judgment. Formal im plication is the relation between two prepositional func tions such that a material implication holds for every pos sible value of their arguments. It is desirable to distin guish among a propositional variable, a differentiated propositional variable, and a propositional function. A propositional variable (p, q, etc.) is any variable appearing in a logical formula whose values are propositions ; a dif ferentiated propositional variable (4&gt;x, ty, etc.) is a propo sitional variable in which subject and qualifier are distin guished ; a propositional function is a differentiated propo sitional variable in which only the subject is used as argu ment. It is a common objection to Mr. Russell's employment of the propositional function that it is also perfectly sig nificant philosophically to vary the qualifier instead.32 While this amendment is valid for certain logical uses, it is superfluous for the purposes of formal implication. An examination of the sixteen possible arrangements varying either or both subject and qualifier of two differentiated propositional variables indicates that only two of the forms can significantly be ormal implications, (x) Ax*z&gt;$x and (&lt;A) .&lt;t&gt;xzD&lt;l&gt;y. The latter is to be found in Principia Mathe 31A distinction between absolute theoretic truth and practical certainty is here essential. Common sense and common sense philosophies like that of Mr. Moore frequently overlook this distinction (cf. Moore, Contemporary British Philosophy, second series, pp. 193 ff.). 32johnson, Logic, Pt.

Weiss, 1932 Monist, pp. 112 ff.</page><page sequence="21">IMPLICATION, MODALITY AND INTENSION 139 matica as a consequence of the definition of identity; and if the axiom of reducibility is rejected, it becomes part of that definition.33 In either case, it is fully treated in later portions of the Principia and need not be considered in our analysis of formal implication.34 Examination of the restrictions imposed by the defin ition of formal implication furnishes two significant re sults. First, as against complete empiricists, a formal im plication is not simply a summation of a class or series of material implications. For if one were to ask, What is the class of material implications which constitute a formal implication? the answer would have to be, Those which are instances of that formal implication.35 In the second place, as against intensionalists, all instances of formal implications, with one class of exceptions, fulfill complete ly all the traditional requirements of connectedness of meaning or intension. The exceptions deal with terms in volving the null class. For the rest, the stipulation that a material implication must hold for all the possible argu ments of a formal implication clearly permits as instances of that implication only such subjects and qualifiers as are invariably associated or taken to be associated. More pre cisely, every formal implication not involving the null class must have identical arguments in antecedent and conse quent. For if they were different, an instance could al ways be found such that the consequent would be fals when the antecedent was true, which would invalidate the formal implication. When terms involving the null class are introduced in to formal implications, paradoxes apparently arise. But they are all eliminable when attention is directed to the 33P.M., *13.101; Carnap, Abriss der Logistik, p. 15; Ramsey, op. cit, p. 53. 34A form of it will be employed below, however, in a discussion of generalization. Russell, Principles, pp. 39-40.</page><page sequence="22">140 THE MONIST needs of inference. "For all x,y, 'x is a griffin' implies 'y is a member of the House of Lords' " is a proper example of a formal implication, since (x is a griffin' is presumably false for all values and consequently any value of it will materially imply any other proposition whatsoever. That this is a departure from the common use of words is ob vious ; but from this it by no means follows that the com mon varieties of inference are not provided for by the logic of Principia Mathematica. For it should be noticed that a formal implication by itself is not a validating form of inference. Applicatively, what does validate an infer ence containing a formal implication is some theorem of the form &lt;t&gt;x. ( x ). 4&gt;x 3 tx : ZD tx. In such theorems no "paradoxical" formal implication is permissible. For if 'x is a griffin' is false for all values of x, no instance of it can be entertained as true, as the theorem requires; and if an instance of it is taken to be true, the formal implica tion of which it is a part no longer holds. Implicatively, what validates inferences containing formal implications is some theorem of the form (x) .&lt;t&gt;xzDtx\(x) .txz^xx: ZD(X) . XZDXX. In this case, "paradoxical" formal impli cations may still be present. Thus, our previous example, in conjunction with the formal implication " sy is a mem ber of the House of Lords' implies sy has been knighted' " will allow an inference to the formal implication " (x is a griffin' implies 'y has been knighted'." But apart from the triviality of such an inference, it should again be noted that, as in the previous case, the implication in virtue of which the inference can be drawn is not paradoxical. It is to such implications-frequently with one or more of the formal implications in the antecedent suppressed that the common usage of "implies" refers. Accordingly, let us turn our attention to implications of this form. Let us also nominally follow Professor Lewis and call</page><page sequence="23">IMPLICATION, MODALITY AND INTENSION I4I the main implication in such formulae a strict implication. What is its nature ? To answer this question satisfactorily, two preliminary distinctions are necessary. First we must distinguish between a theorem of logic and any instance of it. The propositions of logic and pure mathematics are formal, containing only pure variables and only logical constants. Any instances of the propositions of logic are either particular or general. The assumption that the im plicative relation which holds in theorems of logic is the same as that which holds in instances of those theorems is completely unwarranted and at the basis of much of the confusion regarding the nature of implication. This as sumption, in turn, can partially be attributed to the failure to make an associated distinction, that between a symbol which is a true variable and one which is merely a short hand convenience. That the theorems of logic are frequent ly interpreted in the latter fashion is due to the refusal of the authors of Principia Mathematica in the first edition to treat their theorems as apparent variables or universal formal propositions.36 I shall distinguish between a theo rem of logic and the symbolic representation of its instances by employing the generality parenthesis for the former. Strict implication is apparently an implication whose antecedent contains at least one formal implication. But the theorems of logic contain no formal implications, since by definition the qualifiers in the latter are constant. I wish, for reasons which will be clear later, to restrict the term "strict implication" to the sphere of formal logic. Accord ingly, strict implication is the relation between two differ entiated propositional variables such that a formal implica tion holds for every possible value of the qualifiers, and a material implication for every possible value of the sub jects and qualifiers, of the variables. (Any combination of 36P.M., pp, xii-xiv.</page><page sequence="24">142 THE MONIST propositional variables is itself a propositional variable.) Though strict implication is thus a generalization of formal implication, the requirement that a material implication hold for all possible values of subjects and qualifiers neces sitates a change of form in its expression. The form (x9^,t) .&lt;t&gt;xiDtx would no more be a theorem of logic than the form (x) AXZD^X could be. Before considering why a form such as (x9&lt;f&gt; l&gt;) :$x. &lt;l&gt;xzDtx:zDtx holds for all possible values, it is necessary to justify the difference of our notation from that of Princi pia Mathematica. The above theorem appears in the Prin cipia as ^ :. (z) .&lt;t&gt;zzDtz:&lt;i&gt;x\ZDtx (* 10.26). As Wittgen stein has pointed out, the assertion sign is relevant to the authors' state of mind, not to formal logic.37 Clearly, fur thermore, 4&gt;, t, and x are also variables in the logical for mula, though in any application they are constant. Accord ingly, the theorem should now be written (x,4&gt;9t) :.&lt;t&gt;x:(z). 4&gt;zzDtz:zDtx. This theorem is proved in the Principia by means of the applicational principle, (x) .&lt;t&gt;x:zD&lt;t&gt;y ("What holds for all holds for any").38 As a principle of logic, this theorem should hold whatever &lt;t&gt;, x and y may be, i.e. (x,y,4&gt;) :4&gt;xzD&lt;i&gt;y ,39 But the latter theorem can be true only if x=y (by the axiom of reducibility, *i2.i, or if that is rejected, by any definition of identity). Hence z in * 10.26 should be replaced by x, and the theorem stands as I have written it. The point of this change is that principles like the applicative and counter-applicative (*9-i3, *io.n) be long to the epistemic branch of logic, not to its strictly formal portion. For the constitutive validation of these principles is simply the law of identity. The fact that we STTractatus, 4.442. 38P.M., *9.2, *10.1, *8.11. 39This transformation is also legitimized by Mr. Russell's convention regarding the scope of an apparent variable. "The true scope of an appar ent variable is always the whole of the asserted proposition in which it oc curs, even when typographically, its scope appears to be only part of the asserted proposition" (P.M., p. 130).</page><page sequence="25">IMPLICATION, MODALITY AND INTENSION I43 may know something holds for all permits us to infer that it also holds for any, but the objective validity of that in ference depends on the fact that the "something" already holds for the "any." The question, What determines a logical form to hold for all possible values? is answered in Principia Mathe matica by the deduction of all its logical forms from an assumed initial few. The latter are then justified pragma tically, i.e. they are held valid because they enable us to deduce theorems such as those of pure mathematics, the entirety of which it is humanly impossible to doubt. More traditional formal logicians have generally assumed that these fundamental theorems, frequently euphemistically called the laws of thought, are presented immediately as self-evident in their absolutely universal form.40 But while this is undoubtedly correct with respect to the determina tion of our belief in such theorems, like Principia Mathe matica it says nothing whatever about the objective char acter of those forms which we come to believe do hold uni versally. On the other hand, belittlers of formal logic since at least the time of Pyrrho and Sextus Empiricus have labelled strict logical reasoning as tautological in nature, and maintained that the sole necessity of logical principles resides in the fact that they assert nothing whatever. The well-counselled distinction between what Mr. Johnson has called the epistemic and constitutive elements in logic en ables us to do justice to both these claims. Epistemically, it is clear that the principles of logic are significant to a high degree and that the whole advance of scientific knowledge is based on their continuous employ ment.41 But constitutively, this epistemic significance 40C7. Johnson, Logic, Pt. II, p. 27. Mr. Johnson himself appeals to an intuitive "induction" for the establishment of formal axioms. 41 Perhaps the ablest contemporary vindication of reason in this sense of logical inference is to be found in Cohen, Reason and Nature.</page><page sequence="26">144 THE MONIST would be utterly miraculous if the formulae of logic were not tautological in character. This distinction is best pre served by confining the term petitio principii to the epis temic branch of logic and tautology to the constitutive por tion. Accordingly, while valid logical inference is not pe titio principii, the logical principles by which such inference proceeds are all tautologies. Practically, the presence of a tautology can best be determined extra-logically by some form of Wittgenstein's truth-tables.42 For formal logic, tautological implication is the relation between two propositional variables such that a material im plication holds for all possible values of the variables. The transition from strict to tautological implication is as fol lows: (x,&lt;t&gt;,t) :4&gt;x.&lt;t&gt;xz^tx:zDtx is a particular case of the formula (x, y,&lt;t&gt;jl') '.^xAxzDty.^ty, where x-=y. The lat ter is merely a differentiation of the general form (p,q) : p,pZDq:-z&gt;q, which is readily shown to be a tautology. Strict implications are thus a special kind of tautological implication. But while every strict implication is a tauto logical implication, the converse statement would not be correct. The difference between the two arises from the requirement that a formal implication must hold in any ap plication of a strict implication. There is no such restric tion upon tautological implication. Now the vast majority of the theorems of Principia Mathematica after chapter *5 are strict implications. This is indicated by Mr. Russell's definition of pure mathematics in the Principles of Mathematics: "Pure mathematics is the class of all propositions of the form fp implies q' where p and q are propositions containing one or more variables, the same in the two propositions, and neither p nor q con 42CY. Tractatus, sections 5 and 6. For an improvement of the method cf. Carnap, Erkenntnis, Band I, Heft I, pp. 21-23.</page><page sequence="27">IMPLICATION, MODALITY AND INTENSION I45 tains any constants except logical constants."43 The stipu lation that the variables be the same in both propositions is superfluous if the notion of extensive possibility is em ployed in conjunction with that of material implication, as has been done in this paper. However accurate as a de scription of most of the propositions of logic and pure mathematics after chapter *5 of the Principia, Mr. Rus sell's statement is formally redundant. A sufficient char acterization of the pure mathematics thus described would simply be: Pure mathematics is the class of all proposi tions of the form (p implies q' where sp implies q' is a strict implication.44 But strict implication is not an ultimate logical form. We have found it to be a special case of tautological im plication. The logic of tautological implication is developed in the first five chapters of the Principia. The vast ma jority of the propositions of these chapters can be described as the class of propositions of the form ep implies q' where 'p implies q' is a tautological implication. These chapters are thus not the material groundwork of the Principia, as the hierarchical development of that work might lead their 43P.3. Italics mine. This point is perhaps better indicated by another statement of Russell: "The typical proposition of mathematics is of the form &lt;fy(x,y ) implies \b(x,y ), whatever values x, y and z may have" (p. 6). While this seems to be a formal implication, and Mr. Russell does so call it (p. 16), we have seen above that the form of the expression must be changed to that of a strict implication (cf. n. 44 ). It will also be noticed that I employ the term "propositionl variable" instead of "proposition contain ing one or more variables." 44Mr. Ramsey and his followers object to Mr. Russell's definition on the ground that it fails to indicate the tautological form of mathematical propo sitions (Foundations of Mathematics, p. 4). This correction is itself incom plete in that it fails to indicate what Mr. Russell's defintion suggests, that a majority of the propositions of logic and pure mathematics are a special type of tautology. The more important objection, also suggested by Ram sey, is that Mr. Russell's definition seems to restrict pure mathematics to the implicative function, which is theoretically unnecessary (cf. below, n. 52). In any case, it appears that at least two definitions of logic and pure mathe matics are required, one for chapters *l-*5 of the P.M. and the other (or pos sibly others) for the remainder.</page><page sequence="28">146 THE MONIST reader to suspect, but its formal apex, the logical valida tion of the entire substructure which follows. This treatment of Principia Mathematica departs from that of Wittgenstein, and more especially that of Ramsey, in one chief respect. For them, the propositions of logic and pure mathematics (at least in part) are simply tautolo gies ; this paper regards the majority of them after chapte** *5 of the Principia as a special kind of tautology called strict implication. The difference can be indicated by an example. An instance of a strict implication is a typical syllogism in Barbara: "All English symbolic logicians treat logic extensionally; all who treat logic extensionally neglect psychology; hence English symbolic logicians ne glect psychology." An instance of a tautological implica tion which is not an instance of a strict implication is the following : "Either William James was an Absolute Ideal ist or Protagoras was a Sophist ; and either Protagoras was not a Sophist or Kant is difficult reading ; hence either Wil liam James was an Absolute Idealist or Kant is difficult reading." The maintenance of this difference is important, for the reason that it, and it alone, relates the logic of Prin cipia Mathematica to the logic of valid thought. Reasoning would be impossible without formal implication, and while for formal logic this may be a psychological accident, no such logic would be complete without taking full account of it. Correct thought is intensional, and formal implica tion is the only type of implication in Principia Mathe matica which can represent its immediate logical struc ture. And while ultimately the formal validity of such thought depends on a tautology, no mere tautology can serve as its sufficient validating condition. To maintain its relevance to human thought, the form of the tautologies of logic must be such as to allow in application the possi</page><page sequence="29">IMPLICATION, MODALITY AND INTENSION I47 bility of intensional connection. But to verify in the logi cally accidental structure of the human mind the necessary type of order of all system would be simply a lingering vestige of philosophic anthropomorphism. IV Four types of implication have been distinguished, and each defined in terms of material implication and exten sive possibility. But only one of them has been designated the implicative relation between propositions-material implication. It is necessary, therefore, to indicate how this theory answers the natural protest that there are clear ly differences among the implication in a random correla tion of true propositions, the implication in an instance of a formal or strict implication, and the implication in an instance of a tautological implication. These differences, the theory would suggest, are not in the implication, but in the form of the expression in which the implication oc curs. All implication between propositions is material; but some implications appear in expressions which have a corresponding form in formal logic, and it is such ex pressions which satisfy the illative sense for intensional connection of meaning. To take the simplest example: " 'Socrates is in Paris' implies 'You are reading this' " is a material implication ; and " 'Socrates is in Paris' implies 'Socrates is in Paris' " is also a material implication. The form of the first is pzDq; for this there is no corresponding logical theorem. The form of the second is p^p; to this there corresponds the law of identity, (p) .pzDp. The dif ference is thus explained, and there are to my knowledge no exceptions to the possibility of such explanation. The appeal to some element over and above such differences of form is hence methodologically superfluous. That this theory, furthermore, is not paradoxical, I</page><page sequence="30">148 THE MONIST should like to indicate by a brief analysis of the formal ele ments of valid thought. This analysis will not be an attempt to show how any one in fact thinks, nor even how any one ought to think; little, I fear, would ever be accomplished intellectually if many people learned to think this way. It merely attempts to disentangle the pattern of order upon which the constitutive validity of all thought depends. It could most accurately be described as a hierarchy of cer tification. Six stages can be distinguished in such an hierarchy. The first is the level of empirical correlation. Thus, two objects may be found to have the same property. The propositional expression of this is symbolized as I, i &lt;l&gt;xzD&lt;l&gt;y. Or, one property is found to be associated with another in the same object: I, 2 &lt;t&gt;XZjfX. Or, most loosely, any two phenomena can be observed to occur and their joint occurrence indicated by a material im plication : I, 3 $x=&gt;*l&gt;y. It should be noticed that the direction of the implication sign is irrelevant at this stage. The second stage may be called the level of empirical generalization and formal definition. Two objects may be observed to have a few, some, or a great many properties in common : II, I, a (3 4&gt;) .$xz)&lt;t&gt;y. Or, two such objects may be observed to have all of a certain set of properties in common. It is, of course, methodologically meaningless to speak of two objects hav ing all properties in common. It should also be observed that this is not a formal implication. II, i, b (\) .&lt;}&gt;xz&gt;&lt;i&gt;y.</page><page sequence="31">IMPLICATION, MODALITY AND INTENSION I49 Again, one property may be observed to be sometimes (oc casionally, frequently, usually) associated in some object with another : II, 2 a ( 3 x) AxzDtx. As has been indicated above, the universalization of this proposition occurs in some combination of tw ways, in tensional formal definition and extensional empirical gen eralization. In either case the constitutive nature of the expression is the same. II, 2 b (x) AxzDfx. The impossibility of generalizing I, 3 should be noticed for its significance in any theory of the form of causal laws. At best, II, 3 (3x y,3&lt;l&gt;,3t) AxiDty.

It is a not uncommon contention that if inference is thus made to depend for its validation upon some exterior prin ciple of logic rather than on some intrinsic necessity in the actual implicative relation, it becomes impossible because of an infinite regress.45 If an inference depends for its validation upon a logical formula, does not that also have to depend on another logical form for its certification, and so on, ad infinitum? The answer to this objection is that the infinite regress simply does not occur. For the validat ing form of a logical formula which validates an actual in ference is that self-same logical formula. This can be tested by writing out the hypothesis of the inference in conjunction with its validating form as an antecedent and the conclusion of the inference as consequent. The form of the entire argument will then be the form of the logi cal formula in the antecedent. Thus, an instance of a tautological implication has the form p.pz&gt;q:uq. Its validating form is (p,q) :.p,pZDq:z&gt;q. Combine them in one proposition, and we obtain 45This is a modification of Lewis Carroll's original paradox of "What the Tortoise Said to Achilles," 1895 Mind, pp. 278-80. Cf. Russell, Principles, p. 35 ; and Johnson, Logic, Pt. II, pp. 24-26.</page><page sequence="33">IMPLICATION, MODALITY AND INTENSION 151 p.pz&gt;q::(p,q):.p.p=&gt;q: Dg::.Dg. But this is of the form X .XZDY:DF, where X = pzDqiDq and Y-q, and this is of the same form as the validating principle. The reason for this is simple ; the first validating form already applies to all possible propositions, so that the supposed infinite regress would be but an infinite re petition of the same form. The paradox is therefore verbal. Constitutively, the infinite regress cannot occur; epistemi cally, the infinite repetition does not occur. In the formulae employed above, p, q and r refer to propositions and the remainder of the notation to truth operations or logical constants. But it is evident that the logical relations which hold between propositions can be regarded as special cases of absolutely general relations holding between all possible entities.46 Thus, let p, q, r, etc. be college graduates, who just as propositions are either true or false, are either members of Phi Beta Kappa or not. We have seen the logic of material implication to be a calculus reducible to n terms and one operation, the stroke. Let the stroke, instead of being interpreted as "not both true/' stand for "not both Phi Beta Kappa/' Then the whole of chapters *i-*5 of Principia Mathematica be comes the logic of the repetitious distribution of college graduates. Similarly, Josiah Royce once constructed a "calculus of modes of action/'47 and S. K. Langer has re 46C7. M. R. Cohen, "The Subject Matter of Formal Logic," 1918 Jour. Phil., pp. 677-78: "The rules of logic are the rules of operation and trans formation according to which all possible objects, physical, psychical, neu tral or complexes, can be combined." The practical primacy, however, of a propositional logic is apparent, since for any possible state of affairs there are at least two possible propositions, one affirming it, the other denying it. But the metaphysical primacy of things or of facts is no concern of formal logic, and its most abstract phase must provide for both. 47"The Principles of Logic," Encyclopedia of the Philosophical Sciences (1912), v. 1, p. 133: "For any rational being who is able to reflect upon and record his own modes of action, if there be given any two modes of</page><page sequence="34">152 THE MONIST cently furnished an example of the application of logistic order to music.48 The ultimate validity of human reason ing is thus seen to depend on the ultimate metaphysical validity of logical order. This may be considered as the sixth and final level of our validational hierarchy. To sum up, the appeal to more and more general form ulae for the logical force of implication and inference is not only not paradoxical, but the only way of explaining it.49 To take entailment as an indefinable idea50 is hard ly a means of answering the question, Why is logical de monstration necessary? To turn to the psychology of the human mind to explain it is as absurd as applying the his torico-genetic method to the formulation of the multipli cation table.51 Finally, to introduce indeterminate notions of intensional connection of meaning is to abandon the rigorous path of formal logic for the more devious and perhaps more pleasant one of psychology and epistemology. action such that one of them implies the other, there always exists at least one determinate mode of action which is implied by the first of these modes of action and which implies the second, and which is yet distinct from both of them." 48"A Set of Postulates for the Logical Structure of Music," 1929 Monist, pp. 561 ff. 49The affinity of such procedure to Peirce's doctrine of leading prin ciples is marked. Cf., for instance, "Some Consequences of Four Incapacities," 1868 Jour. Speculative Phil., p. 146: "Every argument implies the truth of a general principle of inferential procedure (whether involving some mat ter of fact concerning the subject of argument or merely a maxim relating to a system of signs) according to which it is a valid argument." SOMoore, Philosophical Studies, pp. 276 ff.; Stebbing, A Modern In troduction to Logic, pp. 220-22. In the terminology of this paper, an en tailment is simply the material implication in any instance of a strict or tautological implication. The word "entail" is recommended as a linguistic convenience only if this relationship with material implication is fully re cognized. 51C7. P. E. B.

Thus, four types of incompatibility, equivalence, rejection, conjunction, disjunction, etc., are also distinguishable to correspond to the distinctions here drawn. Attention has been directed to implication for the reason that it is traditionally viewed as the paramount operation between propositions, and inference normally pro ceeds under its aegis. That is not, however, a strictly logical consideration. Formal logic seeks to flee from every particular fact and existence; but if it were divorced from all possible being it would simply become a series of unmeaning scratches. LEO ABRAHAM.
