Tamiami Trail Sarasota, FL, U.S.A. 34243 Abstract: Aldo Leopold's approach to environmental man- agement changed drastically between the early 1920s, when he advocated predator eradication, and 1944, when he drafted "Thinking Like a Mountain. " How are we to under- stand these changes? It is shown that, early in his career, Leopold developed the basic elements of a conservation ethic, borrowing key ele- mentsfrom the Russian organicistP. D. Ouspensky andfrom A T Hadley, an American pragmatist who was president of Yale University when Leopold was a student there. Hadley's pragmatism counseled that we act on the wisdom embodied in the intuitive perceptions of our forefathers. While Leopold changed the presentation of his conservation ethic over the years, he never gave up these key ideas, traces of which re- main in the final version of "The Land Ethic." The changes in Leopold's management strategies were not due to a change in metaphysical or moral views, but to his evolving experience as a forester and game manager. Leopold learned that "violent" strategies, such as monocul- tural planting of trees, pervasive agricultural management of fragile ecosystems and, above all, predator eradication, led to unforeseen and unwelcome results. Leopold recog- nized that we may never have adequate information to ma- nipulate natural systems for maximal human utility with- out diminishing their vitality. He therefore lost faith in "economic biology" as a guide to environmental man- agement. Leopold's changing views on management resulted from his experience as an environmental manager, not from a conversion from utilitarian anthropocentrism to biocentric nonanthropocentrism. While Leopold was drawn to Ouspen- sky's organicism, and he hoped Americans would, through a profound change in their perceptions of nature adopt such a view eventually, he believed throughout his career that long- Paper submitted 5/28/87; revised manu-script accepted 8/19/87.

Los cambios ocurridos en las estategias de manejo de Leopold no fueron debidos a un cambio de punto de vista metafisico o moral, sino a su experiencia evolutiva como forestal y manejador de fauna Leopold aprendio que las estrategias "violentas' tales como el monocultivo de arbo- les, el manejo agricola extenso en ecositemasfragilesy, sobre todo, la erradicacion de animales depredadores, conduci'an a resultados imprevistos e inoportunos.

In 1920 Aldo Leopold enthusiastically described his predator eradication program. He had formed a coali- tion of sportsmen and stockmen to eliminate wolves, mountain lions, and other large predators from Arizona and New Mexico: "But the last one must be caught be- fore the job can be called fully successful," he said (Flader 1974: 3). Twenty-four years later Leopold re- pented his war on wolves in a graceful and humble es- say, "Thinking Like a Mountain," which was drafted in 1944 and published in A sand County Almanac and Sketches Here and There. What happened in the mean- time? It is tempting to believe that, during this period, Leopold discovered his revolutionary land ethic, that his thinking underwent a profound religious-metaphys- ical-moral change, and that his about-face on predator control programs was a direct result of this profound philosophical conversion. Since Leopold was acting, in 1920, as a representative of the U.S. Forest Service, which remained under the philosophical domination of Gifford Pinchot's humanistic utilitarianism, this inter- pretation sees Leopold as later rejecting utilitarian man- agement because he came to espouse "a right to exist" for all members of the land community (see, for exam- ple, Petulla 1980: 16, 20). This essay seeks to show that Leopold's intellectual odyssey during this period was more complex than this straightforward account would suggest. In particular, Leopold had embraced the main philosophical elements of his land ethic early in his career, even while he was advocating predator eradication. These main elements include important influences, hitherto unnoticed, de- rived from American pragmatism, a philosophical ap- proach that Leopold borrowed from Arthur Twining Hadley who was president of Yale University when Leopold was a student there. Leopold never abandoned the main elements of his early philosophy, and I will argue that his shift from predator eradication to preda- tor protection was motivated, not by a shift in religious, metaphysical, or moral views, but rather by a recogni- tion that scientific knowledge is inadequate to guide gross manipulations of ecosystems and by an increasing- ly pessimistic view of the prospects of environmental management. I conclude that, while Leopold was fasci- nated by organicism and its metaphysical and moral im- plications, these abstract views had little direct impact on his managerial style. adoptaran eventualmente dichas ideas, el crey6, a lo largo detoda su carrera que el antropocentrismo de larga vision provee una base adecuada para las praccticas conservacion- istas. In 1923 Leopold drafted an essay, "Some Fundamentals of Conservation in the Southwest" (Leopold 1979). He included, as a final section, some brief remarks that he called, "Conservation as a Moral Issue." This essay re- mained unpublished until 30 years after Leopold's death; commentators have treated the final section as an immature draft of Leopold's conservation ethic, and some have suggested that Leopold later abandoned sig- nificant elements of the philosophy expressed there (Flader 1979: 143-144, Callicott 1987, Rolston 1987, note 3). It cannot be denied that Leopold's brief 1923 discus- sion of conservation morality is confusing. In only three pages Leopold stated that "economic determinism" is insufficient to understand land conservation; invoked the prophet Ezekiel; considered the Russian organicist philosopher P. D. Ouspensky's view that the world is a "living thing" with "a soul, or consciousness"; ques- tioned whether the world "was made for man's use, or has man merely the privilege of temporarily possessing an earth made for inscrutable purposes"; approvingly quoted John Muir on the rights of rattlesnakes but de- cided "I will not dispute the point"; and finally con- cluded that we have an obligation to future generations to prove ourselves "capable of inhabiting the earth with- out defiling it." Along the way, he admitted that most scientists and laymen hold "anthropomorphic" views.' He also considered the effect that Ouspensky's organi- cism would have on "most men of affairs," and observed that for them "this reason is too intangible to either accept or reject as a guide to human conduct" (Leopold 1979: 138-141). It is difficult to see, at first glance, a unifying principle in this densely packed presentation of so many grand ideas. It seems clear that, after introducing nonanthro- pocentric ideas, Leopold opted in the end for a conser- vation ethic based on our obligations to future genera- tions of humans-a forward-looking anthropocentrism. But the reasoning by which he shifted from his prior discussion of organicism and nonanthropocentrism to longsighted anthropocentrism is so compact as to nearly defy understanding. Fortunately, a clue to Leopold's thinking appears in a parenthetical comment, which is embedded in his discussion of our obligations to future generations: "How happy a definition is that one of Had- Conservation Biology Volume 2, No. 1, March 1988</page><page sequence="3">Norton Constancy of Leopold's Land Ethic 95 ley's which states, 'Truth is that which prevails in the long run.'" Since the essay was never published, Leopold pre- pared no notes or list of references. This definition, however, clearly derives from the American pragmatists. (see, for example, Peirce 1978: 288). Arthur Twining Hadley, a child prodigy in Greek, graduated at the head of his class at Yale in 1876. He studied political econ- omy at the University of Berlin and returned to become a tutor and later a professor at his undergraduate insti- tution. Noted for the breadth of his knowledge, his classes on economics and political ethics were extreme- ly popular. Hadley became the first lay president of Yale in 1899 (M. Hadley 1948). He described himself as a "thoroughgoing pragmatist" (M. Hadley 1948: 197) and generally quoted William James's work as representative of modern philosophical thinking. In his most thoroughly philosophical book, Some In- fluences in Modern Philosophic Thought, Hadley said: "The criterion which shows whether a thing is right or wrong is its permanence. Survival is not merely the characteristic of right; it is the test of right."2 These views he characterized as the views of pragmatists and in the next paragraph he discussed James's view, which he stated as "We hold the beliefs which have preserved our fathers" and accepted this view while changing its emphasis somewhat: I do not mean that we should consciously adopt a belief because it is useful to us, as James seems to imply. I would rather take the ground that we hold the belief that has preserved our fathers as an intuition and act on it as an instinct (A. T. Hadley 1913: 73) Leopold began "Conservation as a Moral Issue" with a quotation from Ezekiel: Seemeth it a small thing unto you to have fed upon good pasture, but you must tread down the residue of your pasture? And to have drunk of the clear water, but ye must foul the residue with your feet? (Leopold, 1979; 138). When Leopold invoked Ezekiel, he was invoking the "beliefs that have preserved our fathers." As understood by Hadley, the pragmatists' notion of truth amounted to a recommendation that we respect the wisdom of our ancestors. Hadley said: The moral and religious instincts that bind the group together, which some men, not so many years ago, were condemning as outworn prejudices, count for even more than individual intelligence. In our practical phi- losophy, of politics and of life, we are reverting to the words of Edmund Burke: "We are afraid to put men to live and trade each on his own private stock of reason, because we suspect that this stock in each man is small, and that the individuals would do better to avail them- selves of the general bank and capital of nations and of ages." (Hadley 1913: 75) These ideas, due to Hadley and the pragmatists, provide the key to understanding an important passage in Leopold's "Conservation as a Moral Issue." Leopold said, "Possibly, in our intuitive perceptions, which may be truer than our science and less impeded by our words than our philosophies, we realize the indivisibility of the earth." This brief passage shows a connection between three important and related ideas in Leopold's thought. He was referring to Hadley's conception of "truth" or "rightness" of social practices interpreted as the "intu- itive perceptions" we have inherited from Ezekiel and others who have counseled protection of resources. Second, he implied that our science is fallible, and per- haps less reliable than these intuitive perceptions. Final- ly, he suggested that our intuitions are more helpful than philosophies, because the latter are "impeded by language." In a discussion of Darwin's influence on history and political science, Hadley explained that Darwin's idea of survival of the fittest was readily accepted by historians, who had long recognized that survival of a culture de- pended on the adaptability of its institutions to situation (Hadley 1913: 121-126). He criticized Herbert Spencer and others for trying to apply the Darwinian criterion over too brief time periods and to individual behaviors (Hadley 1913: 130). Hadley concluded: "It is the insti- tution even more than the man that has been marked out for survival by the process of natural selection" (Hadley 1913: 127). I have found no evidence that Leopold read or studied the American pragmatists in detail, although he no doubt knew about the publication of Hadley's book, as it was given a major review in the Yale Review (Sherman 1913). Apparently, Leopold read this magazine regularly.3 Further, Leopold was clearly familiar with, and impressed by, Hadley's conception of truth, because he referred to it on several occasions in the journals he kept during this early period of his career.4 It may, at this point, be impossible to determine the extent of Leopold's study of Hadley, but it is clear that Leopold absorbed and applied the basic elements of Hadley's approach to evaluating cultures. When Leopold mentioned intuitive perceptions, Ezekiel's admonition to treat the land with respect, he was invoking Hadley's intuitions of our fathers. In this same passage Leopold compared this intuition favorably with both science and philosophy. Since Leopold was here striving for a very large-scale understanding, a kind of worldview, to support his conservation goals, it is important to examine the treatment he gave both phi- losophy and science in this large perspective. Leopold is obviously wary of philosophical pro- nouncements. In only three pages "Conservation as a Moral Issue" contains no less than five cautions against the "pitfalls of language," and three of them are related Conservation Biology Volume 2. No. 1. March 1988</page><page sequence="4">96 Constancy of Leopold's Land Ethic Norton to doubts about the efficacy of philosophical ideas. While on first reading these passages may appear as ex- pressions of humility and little more, I believe they also provide a clue to the philosophical approach underlying Leopold's conservation ethic. These references to lan- guage derive from the linguistic pluralism of Ouspen- sky's Tertium Organum, which Leopold here blended with American pragmatism as a justification for a long- sighted anthropocentrism to support his conservation ethic. In his discussion of Ouspensky, Leopold characterized two "conceptions of the earth." There is a "mechanistic conception of the earth as our physical provider and abiding place." This conception was opposed to an- other: the world is a living organism and the "soil, mountains, rivers, atmosphere, etc.-[are] organs, or parts of organs, of a coordinated whole, each part with a definite function." On this view of the world, which "many of the world's most penetrating minds" (he cited Ouspensky) have found compelling, the earth has "a soul or consciousness." It begins even to make sense to respect it as a living thing and to relate to it morally. In this context of competing worldviews, Leopold's refer- ences to the importance of language appear more sig- nificant: There is not much discrepancy, except in language, be- tween this conception of a living earth, and the concep- tion of a dead earth, with enormously slow, intricate, and interrelated functions among its parts, as given by physics, chemistry, and geology" (Leopold 1979; 139- 140) A similar form of conceptual pluralism, also linked with cautions about the inadequacy of language, is a major theme of Ouspensky's Tertium Organum (Ouspensky 1968: 222f). I am suggesting that, in "Conservation as a Moral Issue," Leopold amalgamated ideas from the American pragmatists with the organicism of Ouspensky, conclud- ing that the most effective conservation ethic represents a concern that we pass on, to future generations, a world not despoiled by our current activities. The relation- ships between these ideas become more explicit if one distinguishes several levels of discourse. When Leopold compared different conceptions of the earth, he was speaking of what might be called second-order beliefs. The facts about the world around us, the facts of physics, chemistry, and geology, are first-order beliefs about the way the world is. Organicism and mechanism, two al- ternative conceptions of the world in Leopold's termi- nology, are second-order beliefs about how to interpret the first-order facts of the particular sciences. Leopold was arguing that organicism and mechanism can accept the same first-order facts about the world and that the choice between these two interpretations is mainly a difference of language. "The essential thing for present purposes is that both admit the interdependent func- tions of the elements" (Leopold 1979: 139-140). Thus, the choice of a second-order interpretation of scientific facts, the choice between organicism and mechanism as alternative conceptions of the world is essentially a lin- guistic choice of how to conceptualize this interrelat- edness. Leopold placed so much emphasis on the pitfalls of language because he believed that empirical data from the natural sciences will never determine our second- order, linguistic choices as to how to conceptualize that data. These questions depend on human perception, not reality: "The very words living thing have an inherited and arbitrary meaning derived not from reality, but from human perceptions of human affairs" (Leopold 1979: 139). Further, he recognized that the choice of a con- ception of the world, an interpretation of the data, will be closely related to the way we think and act. Here we see the amalgamation of Ouspensky's organicism with Hadley's pragmatism. It is a central idea of American pragmatism that linguistic forms depend upon percep- tion and perception depends in turn upon human af- fairs. What we do determines what we say and think as much as vice versa. Leopold combined pragmatism with Ouspensky's organicism and arrived at a form of home- grown perspectivism, a view that metaphysical concep- tions of the world are projections of human perceptions which depend, in turn, upon cultural practices. From this amalgamation, Leopold concluded that dif- ferent cultures with radically different practices will have different characteristic vocabularies and therefore different conceptions of the world. But since these dif- ferent conceptions amount only to different conceptu- alizations of the same hard, scientific data, Leopold was cautious whenever he compared ideas from one con- ception with those from another. Leopold thus shied away from metaphysical and theological pronounce- ments: "It is just barely possible that God himself likes to hear birds sing and see flowers grow. But here again we encounter the insufficiency of words as symbols for reality." Similarly, his concern that philosophical and theological ideas are artifacts of conceptions of the world led Leopold to express a deep distrust of pro- nouncements about the "truth" of anthropocentrism or nonanthropocentrism: Probably many of us who have neither the time nor the ability to reason out conclusions on such matters by logical processes have felt intuitively that there existed between man and the earth a closer and deeper relation than would follow the mechanistic conception of the earth..... Of course, in discussing such matters we are beset on all sides with the pitfalls of language. (Leopold 1979: 139) So far, we have seen that Leopold understood Ouspen- sky's organicism and modern, atomistic science as two alternative conceptions of the world, the choice be- tween which is a second-order choice among vocabu- Conservation Biology Volume 2, No. 1, March 1988</page><page sequence="5">Norton Constancy of Leopold's Land Ethic 97 laries for presenting first-order data, and unlikely to be fully decided by that data. At the same time, he recog- nized that the choice between these conceptions has profound consequences for the way we treat the earth. On a mechanistic worldview, the earth is dead and we would have no moral concern for it. This viewpoint has led to "economic determinism," which Leopold dispar- agingly characterized as the "language of compound interest." On the organicist view, the earth is alive and worthy of our respect and moral concern. But the choice between the two conceptions of the world is mainly a linguistic choice, underdetermined by the sci- entific data available. This combination of views, without supplementation, would result in a radical relativism: we either speak as mechanistic scientists or as organicists and, depending on this arbitrary choice, we will either be economic determinists or we will react morally to the land. It is at this crucial juncture that Leopold introduced Hadley's definition of truth as that which prevails in the long run. Following Hadley, Leopold chose not to dispute the metaphysical and theological issues of anthropocen- trism, but rather to rely on the intuitive perceptions of the tradition-Ezekiel. Or, to put the point in more Hadleian terms, the test of rightness of cultural practices is their long-term survivability. Hadley's pragmatic def- inition of truth therefore functioned, in Leopold's early philosophy, as a third-order principle, as a means to judge second-order conceptions of the world and to provide a criterion for distinguishing acceptable cultur- al practices from unacceptable ones. This was surely an attractive idea to Leopold for sev- eral reasons. First, it provided a unification of his phil- osophical thought with his biological belief in the Dar- winian principle of "survival of the fittest." Second, it allowed him to relate, in a larger perspective, scientific knowledge with his speculations about Ouspensky's or- ganicism-these are two differing linguistic approaches to the same "earth." Third, it provided him an ideal platform from which to denounce the practices, de- scribed in detail in the first two sections of "Some Fun- damentals of Conservation in the Southwest," which he believed were destroying the land. Our treatment of the land is wrong because it is not sustainable, as Ezekiel said. Immediately after he decided not to dispute anthro- pocentrism, Leopold granted "that the earth is for man." He then said, "there is still a question: what man? The cliff dwellers, the Pueblos, the Spaniards, and now the Americans all believed the earth was their possession." But the prior cultures "left the earth alive, undamaged." If we are "logically anthropomorphic," he said, we must consider what the next civilization will say of us. If there is, indeed, "a special nobility inherent in the human race-a special cosmic value, distinctive from and supe- rior to all other life," then it must manifest itself in "a society decently respectful of its own and all other life, capable of inhabiting the earth without defiling it." If we do not manifest that nobility, we shall "be judged in the derisive silence of eternity" (Leopold 1979: 141). Leopold was, ultimately, basing his argument for con- servation on the fact that the land in the Southwest was going through a series of less and less productive cycles owing mainly to overgrazing. This factual basis, outlined in detail in earlier sections of the draft article, seemed to him an adequate basis for conservation when combined with Hadley's pragmatic definition of truth as survivabil- ity. This argument could be made independent of ap- peals to nonanthropocentrism, which is a second-order belief not possible to establish conclusively. By applying Hadley's definition of truth to the cultural practices that were causing deterioration of the land in the Southwest, Leopold could sidestep the issue of anthropocentrism and declare those practices "false." He relied not upon Ouspensky (in spite of his obviously deep attraction to organicism) but upon Ezekiel buttressed by Hadley's definition of truth. Leopold's philosophical pragmatism also provides an explanation of his comment that "most men of affairs" will find organicism and other forms of nonanthropo- centrism "too intangible to either accept or reject as a guide to human conduct" (Leopold 1979: 138-141). Leopold recognized that both modern science and tra- ditionalJudaeo-Christian religion are anthropocentric in their conception of the world and, given his admission that conceptions of the world involve unresolvable dif- ferences in linguistic forms, he recognized that he would be unsuccessful in preaching nonanthropocen- trism to them, at least in the short run. He resolved, instead, to argue for a longsighted anthropocentrism based on the intuitive perceptions of Ezekiel: we ought not to "tread down the residue of [our] pasture." Leopold therefore resolved, early in his career, to enter the policy arena armed only with arguments based on longsighted anthropocentrism, rather than basing his moral strictures on nonanthropocentrism. II Leopold's approach to environmental management un- derwent a profound change between 1920 and 1944. The question I am posing is whether this change re- sulted from a change in his religious-metaphysical-moral views, or whether the change was motivated by expand- ing scientific information and hands-on management ex- perience. Having sketched a unified philosophy under- lying Leopold's thinking in 1923, it is now possible to ask whether he changed this philosophy in subsequent years. How significantly do Leopold's views, as ex- pressed in the final version of "The Land Ethic" (which dates from 1947), differ from his early views as stated in "Conservation as a Moral Issue"? Conservation Biology Volume 2, No. 1, March 1988</page><page sequence="6">98 Constancy of Leopold's Land Ethic Norton "The Land Ethic" begins with the story of Odysseus' arbitrary hanging of a dozen slave-girls on mere suspi- cion of misbehavior, a historical example of the chang- ing nature of moral judgments. This example, which was first introduced in 1933 (Leopold 1933a), evokes his earlier view that moral ideas are tied closely to changing patterns of behavior and to the conceptions of thought associated with them. These, in turn, are likely to differ across epochs. Subsequent developments have seen the extension of moral concepts to human individuals pre- viously treated as mere property. This much-discussed example stands as an analogy for the eventual emer- gence of a full-blown land ethic: "The land-relation is still strictly economic, entailing privileges but not obligations" (Leopold 1949: 201-203). The emergence of a land ethic is actually a process in ecological evolution.... An ethic, ecologically, is a limitation on freedom of action in the struggle for existence. An ethic, philosophically, is a dif- ferentiation of social from anti-social conduct. These are two definitions of the same thing. Here we see a later representation of Leopold's view that there are multiple conceptions of the world (here represented as two different fields of study, philosophy and ecology) and that these conceptions, which are as- sociated with differing practices, are winnowed by the forces of competition and evolution. An ethic "has its origin in the tendency of interdependent individuals or groups to evolve modes of cooperation.... [T]he origi- nal free-for-all competition has been replaced, in part, by cooperative mechanisms with an ethical content" (Leopold 1949: 202). In 1923 Leopold was drawn to organicism and the ethic associated with it, but he was wary of trying to establish these views rationally because an ethic is so tied up with its characteristic vocabulary and world conceptions. An ecologically sensitive conception of the world will emerge only gradually as we learn, in prac- tice, the extent of our interdependence. In the mean- time we must rely on the intuitive wisdom of Ezekiel and our forefathers. In the 1947 version, Leopold was looking forward, predicting that, in the face of greater recognition of our mutual dependencies with other spe- cies, we will eventually develop an ethic consonant with the ecological conception of the world. Assuming we survive at all, we will have discovered a worldview that is adapted to the modern world, a new set of Hadleian intuitions that will promote survival: "Ethics are possi- bly a kind of community instinct-in-the making" (Leopold 1949: 203). Leopold's temporary reliance on the traditional strictures of Ezekiel, as well as his faith that a new ethical age will dawn (if we do not destroy ourselves first) are both manifestations of the pluralistic view of world conceptions and the pragmatic concep- tion of truth as survivability. Near the end of "The Land Ethic" Leopold discussed "Land-Health and the A-B Cleavage": Conservationists are notorious for their dissensions. Su- perficially these seem to add up to mere confusion but a more careful scrutiny reveals a single plane of cleavage common to many specialized fields. In each field one group (A) regards the land as soil, and its function as commodity-production; another group (B) regards the land as a biota, and its function as something broader. Here, again, we see the conception of a "dead earth" contrasted with that of a "living earth," and Leopold understood the dissensions among conservationists as based, ultimately, on the acceptance of one or the other of these conceptions. References to Ouspensky do not occur, but Leopold's words indicate that he was still fascinated with second-order systems that he called in 1923 "conceptions of the earth." "In all of these cleav- ages, we see repeated the same basic paradoxes: man the conqueror versus man the biotic citizen; science the sharpener of his sword versus science the search-light on his universe; land the slave and servant versus land the collective organism" (Leopold 1949: 221-223). "The Land Ethic" differs from "Conservation as a Moral Issue" in lacking the latter's numerous cautions about language and its pitfalls. This is indicative of a deeper shift in Leopold's strategy-he apparently de- cided not to emphasize philosophical theory (which he saw as raising issues that can be settled only in the slow- heating crucible of evolutionary selection), but to rely instead on his vast experience as an environmental man- ager. But the pragmatism and conceptual relativity are still there in muted form, as evidenced by the refer- ences, quoted above, to different fields (ethics and ecol- ogy) as using alternative vocabularies to describe simi- lar processes and in the discussion of the A-B cleavage. Thus, while Leopold's philosophical scaffolding is less explicit in his later work, traces of his theoretical com- mitments remain. The strategic decision to emphasize his experiences as a forester and wildlife manager is deeply pragmatic in spirit. Theory, according to the pragmatist, must ultimately be tested against experi- ence. Leopold was admittedly tentative in his 1923 pro- nouncements, perhaps because he had to rely on the philosophical and linguistically relative concepts that he cautioned against. As he matured, gaining experience and replacing philosophical speculation with knowl- edge of ecological science and the consequences of management strategies, he relied more confidently on his managerial experience (Flader 1974: 18). If, there- fore, we use the term "philosophy" to refer to a basic worldview including a metaphysics and value system, we can conclude that Leopold acted, throughout this period, against the backdrop of a consistent and unified philosophical approach. Conservation Biology Volume 2, No. 1, March 1988</page><page sequence="7">Norton Constancy of Leopold's Land Ethic 99 III If, however, we use the term "philosophy" more broadly, in a sense in which one might say that Leopold had a "philosophy of environmental management," his philosophy did indeed change. Why did Leopold, acting against a backdrop of unchanging metaphysical and moral worldviews, change his approach to predator control and other management strategies? How could Leopold, in the early twenties, have approved organi- cism while eradicating wolves and mountain lions? There is a ready explanation for Leopold's early at- tempts at predator eradication: trained in the Pinchot mold of utilitarian forestry, Leopold set out to maximize resources for human use (Flader 1974: 25). When he became interested in game management in 1915, he simply transferred forestry management practices to a new resource, fish and game. If a little game is valuable, more is correspondingly so. Predators compete for game, so he set out to eliminate them, as well as to enforce hunting laws and to stock streams-all were management methodologies designed to maximize sport resources. What requires an explanation is not Leopold's use of these management practices (which were assumed as part of his job), but his doing so while approving organicism and questioning the adequacy of "economic determinism." Leopold already believed in this early stage of his career that the health of the land community is important; but he had not yet realized that all species are necessary to promote that health. He be- lieved that resource managers, provided they are scien- tific in their management practices, can manipulate pop- ulations and he seems to have believed that predator control would enhance the overall health and produc- tivity of biological systems. With this view as a starting point, Leopold's views of management began a slow evolution toward less radical interventions. By 1925 he believed that wolves and mountain lions contributed to the diversity of an area and he retreated from a goal of eradication to one of control (Flader 1974: 154). When Leopold met Charles Elton, who had initiated the transformation of ecology from a purely descriptive to a more functionally orient- ed science with the publication of Animal Ecology in 1927, he integrated these ideas into his own 1933 text, Game Management (Flader 1974: 24-25). Defining "management" as "the coordination of science and use," Leopold stated that "the central thesis of game manage- ment is this: game can be restored by the creative use of the same tools which have heretofore destroyed it- axe, plow, cow, fire, and gun" (Flader 1974: 25, quoted from Leopold 1933b). In the 1933 essay "The Conservation Ethic" Leopold noted that there was emerging a new and more positive approach to conservation of the land and living things. The means to the goal of protection was biological re- search: The duty of the individual is to apply its findings to the land ... [because] the soil and plant succession are rec- ognized as the basic variables which determine plant and animal life ... and likewise the quality of human satisfactions.... Leopold 1933a 641) Leopold applied this strategy to species preservation, arguing that species become rare and extinct because their habitats have shrunk. He asks: Can such shrinkage be controlled? Yes, once the speci- fications are known. How known? Through ecological research. How controlled? By modifying the environ- ment with those same tools and skills already used in agriculture and forestry. (Leopold 1933a 641) In 1933, then, Leopold optimistically believed that eco- logical research would usher in a new era of plenty based on a positive program of environmental manage- ment: Given, then, the knowledge and the desire, this idea of controlled wild culture or 'management' can be applied not only to quail and trout, but to any living thing from bloodroots to Bell's vireos" (Leopold 1933a 641) He as yet saw no inherent contradiction between con- servation and intense management for production of re- sources. Given ecological knowledge, populations could be managed for the good of humans. The reduction of predators would be unproblematic: human hunters would simply absorb the ecological function of wolves and mountain lions. While accepting organicism, he did not yet see that organicism implied a goal of saving all species. He believed that, given sufficient knowledge and sensitivity in management, the living organism (the land) could be kept thriving, while some of its less de- sirable organs were removed. Faith in ecological tech- nique, therefore, shielded him from the conclusion that destruction of wolves and mountain lions would cause serious illness in the organic system of nature. By 1939, however, Leopold's view of the role of ecol- ogy had changed drastically. He still believed that ecol- ogy "is the new fusion point for all the natural sciences," but its results were not those he had hoped for: The emergence of ecology has placed the economic biologist in a peculiar dilemma: with one hand he points to the accumulated findings of his search for utility, or lack of utility, in this or that species; with the other he lifts the veil from a biota so complex, so conditioned by interwoven cooperations and competitions, that no man can say where utility begins or ends ... the old catego- ries of 'useful' and 'harmful' have validity only as condi- tioned by time, place, circumstance. The only sure con- clusion is that the biota as a whole is useful, and biota includes not only plants and animals, but soils and wa- ters as well. (Leopold 1939: 727) Leopold concluded that human management activities Conservation Biology Volume 2, No. 1, March 1988</page><page sequence="8">100 Constancy of Leopold's Land Ethic Norton do not successfully mimic nature in the creation of hab- itats because "evolutionary changes are slow and local," while human use of tools "has enabled him to make changes of unprecedented violence, rapidity, and scope." Unforeseen changes in species composition re- sult as "larger predators are lopped off the cap of the pyramid." The effects of such changes "are seldom fore- seen; they represent unpredicted and often untraceable readjustments in the structure" (Leopold 1939: 728). Leopold was now regretting his war on wolves. His predator control program and the restrictions on hunt- ing he began to enforce in 1915 in the Southwest had resulted in huge, but starving, herds of deer. The deer overbrowsed the land and caused yet one more down- ward turn in the cycle of succession. Weedy, brushy species replaced more useful trees and shrubs, and the diversity of the area diminished (Flader 1974: 117). The 1939 essay "A Biotic View of Land" was in effect a retrospective view of what Leopold had learned as a forester and wildlife manager. He referred to the Ger- man experience in tree farming: "Thus the Germans, who taught the world to plant trees like cabbages, have scrapped their own teachings and gone back to mixed woods of native species...." (Leopold 1939: 730, see also Flader 1974: 139f). Similarly, he came out defini- tively against predator control as a "highly artificial (i.e., violent)" method of management (Leopold 1939: 729). Additionally, he had observed the extent and serious- ness of the dust bowl phenomenon, of what pervasive "economic management" could do to fragile ecosys- tems. Leopold therefore changed his views of management because: In short, economic biology assumed that the biotic func- tion and economic utility of a species was partly known and the rest could shortly be found out. That assump- tion no longer holds good; the process of finding out added new questions faster than new answers. The func- tion of species is largely inscrutable, and may remain so. (Leopold 1939: 727) We need not posit any shift in Leopold's metaphysical or moral views to explain the changes in his views on wild- life management. He learned through practice that "violent" methods of management and control are inap- propriate because they also cause unforeseen effects and damage the biotic community. This is an insight that was implicit in his belief in the importance of ecology; but it was obscured by his initial faith that ecology would teach us enough about ecological interactions among species to allow manipulation of populations for utilitarian purposes. He underestimated the complexity of systems and overestimated our ability to control them; he consequently failed to see that predator pro- tection was one of the principles implied by the holistic approach that he advocated in opposition to the eco- nomic determinism he rejected. In the face of practical evidence, the pest problems of monocultural forestry, and deer starving on overgrazed reserves, Leopold even- tually adopted a less violent and disruptive approach toward management. IV Should Leopold be classed as an anthropocentrist? Yes and No. Yes, in the sense that he believed that, for better or worse, humans must and should manage the natural world. Given that, and current attitudes in society, ar- guments based on the good of the human species will carry more weight in policy debates. After summarizing the structure of the land pyramid and describing the land as an "energy circuit," Leopold summarized his land ethic in three basic ideas: "(1) That land is not merely soil. (2) That the native plants and animals kept the energy circuit open; others may not. (3) That man- made changes are of a different order than evolutionary changes, and have effects more comprehensive than is intended or foreseen. These ideas, collectively, raise two basic issues: Can the land adjust itself to the new order? Can the desired alterations be accomplished with less violence?" (Leopold 1949: 218). This is anthropo- centrism of sorts. Leopold accepted that humans will alter the biota. Their management will be successful if they protect life and if the human race survives. It will be a failure if the human race, "like ... John Burrough's potato bug, which exterminated the potato, ... exter- minates itself" (Leopold 1979: 141). Leopold never questioned the right of humans to alter nature, provided these alterations were consistent with ecological knowl- edge and would protect, in the long run, human life and the living land on which it depends. But Leopold regarded both anthropocentrism and its denial as representing only human conceptions, as arti- facts of human perceptions rather than reality. To try to determine the truth of these speculative pronounce- ments without reference to the systems in which they are embodied is to go beyond the possibilities of lan- guage. And yet there is a legitimate sense in which Leopold was a nonanthropocentrist. He saw organicism as an alternative to mechanism, one that would carry with it a deeper, even moral, reaction to the land. This view, while it can hardly be expressed in our current vocabulary, is true in the pragmatic sense-it has sur- vival value. Leopold's dream that someday our culture will evolve a more sensitive reaction to the land ex- plains the central role he always placed, as an environ- mental professional, on developing public perception. He believed that, as Americans become more aware of their interdependence with the rest of the biotic world, they will gradually develop a new conception of the world, including a moral reaction to the community of Conservation Biology Volume 2, No. 1, March 1988</page><page sequence="9">Norton Constancy of Leopold's Land Ethic 101 life. This development will, he thought, improve the survival chances of our culture and he therefore de- voted his career to improving the perception of the American public.5 Leopold's actual target was not anthropocentrism, however. He concluded that nonanthropocentrism raises issues too intractable to make it useful in manage- ment discussions. Instead, he attacked shortsighted eco- nomic reasoning that ignores the scientific evidence that intense management often leads to gradual decline in productive systems.6 Leopold recognized, in the de- generation of vegetative systems in the Southwest, in German forestry, and in the dust bowl phenomenon, the inadequacy of management practices based solely on Pinchot's utilitarian criterion. The search for profit, "economic determinism," leads inevitably to an under- valuing of future resources. But shortsighted, destruc- tive practices are wrong even if we are "logically" an- thropocentric. Anthropocentrism itself should imply a concern for future generations. Leopold acted upon what I call the "convergence hypothesis" (Norton, in press). According to that hy- pothesis, the interests of humans and the interests of nature differ only in the short run. If we recognize the extent to which the human species is an integral part of the community of life, long-term human interests coin- cide with the "interests" of nature. To protect the full- ness of life is to protect the far-distant future of the human species and its evolutionary successors; and vice versa. Since the survival of our culture depends upon the survival of the ecosystems on which we, in turn, depend, the conception of the world one adopts is less important than the longsightedness with which it is ap- plied in environmental management. Notes 1. Leopold used the term "anthropomorphic" as we currently use "anthropocentric"-to refer to a value system that bases all value in human motives. Except in quotations of Leopold, I will follow current prac- tice and use "anthropocentric." 2. Pragmatists described their conception of truth in several ways. James tended to emphasize the "effec- tiveness" of true ideas (see, for example, James 1948: 162). Peirce emphasized that truth is that which will last through an indefinite number of experiments and actions. He said that truth is "the predestined result to which sufficient inquiry would lead" (Peirce 1978: 288). The reader should not be disconcerted by Leopold's shift from Hadley's discussion of "right" to a definition of "truth"-the pragmatists drew no sharp distinction between facts and values and there- fore treated "true" and "right" as largely interchange- able. Leopold's application of "truth" to cultural prac- tices would be acceptable to pragmatists such as Hadley. 3. Curt Meine, who has just completed a biography of Leopold based on the collection of Leopold's papers, informs me that he found evidence that Leopold read the Yale Review regularly. 4. Again, Meine is my source of information here. 5. For a fuller discussion of the central role of "trans- formative values" in environmental ethics, see Norton 1987, Chapter 10. 6.
