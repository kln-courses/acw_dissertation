Ghiselin Center for the History and Philosophy of Science California Academy of Sciences Golden Gate Park, San Francisco, CA 94118, USA Ayala (1999, 27) accuses various persons of having 'failed to recognize the various meanings that the term "teleology" may have', and using teleological explanations in their work, but failing to recognize them as such. I find it hard to imagine why he chose a book of mine (Ghiselin 1974) as an example. In fact there is a chapter entitled 'The Legacy of the Stagirite, or, Teleology Old and New', in which I classify the various senses of 'teleology' under four broad headings: instrumentality, conditional necessity, terminating orientation, and intelligible orderliness. One might argue whether my list encompassed everything that Ayala might wish for, but then again his own treatment is far from exhaustive. Neither, to be sure, is that of Mayr (1998), and one wonders how thorough a treatment should be expected. But perhaps I did not make myself clear enough, even in a book the basic point of which was not only why biologists should get rid of teleology, but how they might do so. Subsequendy I have discussed the same issue in the context of the new evolutionary ontology (Ghiselin 1997). Ayala's (1999) essay is largely a reiteration of what he has said in earlier publications. One of these (Ayala 1970) has been reissued in an anthology (Allen, Bekoff and Lauder 1998) that provides an excellent sample of recent discussions on teleology. Another (Ayala 1998) is a rebuttal of an attempt by Mayr (1998) to answer criticisms by Krieger (1998) based upon the views of Ayala. In reading those publications I noted some assertions that were obviously not correct, but at first was not quite sure whether it was just a matter of literary infelicity, for Ayala did not express his views consistently. A closer look convinces me that if Ayala really means what he says, he has committed a serious blunder. If he did not mean what he said, I hope he will clarify his position. We read statements like the following (Ayala 1999,18): 0308-7298/90 $ 3.00 © 2002 Taylor and Francis Ltd</page><page sequence="2">488 NOTES AND COMMENTS - Hist. Phil. Life Sci., 24 (2002), 487-491 There is also an ultimate goal to which all features contribute or have contributed in the past-reproductive success. The general or ultimate end to which all features and their functions contribute is increased reproductive efficiency. The presence of the functions themselves - and therefore the features which serve them - is ultimately explained by their contribution to the reproductive fitness of the organisms in which they exist. What Ayala says here simply is not true. In Darwinian biology, organisms do whatever it was that contributed to their ancestors' reproductive success, irrespective of how this may affect their own reproductive success. Most individual organisms do not reproduce at all, in spite of having all sorts of features that exist as a consequence of differential reproduction by their ancestors. So although an organism may be in the process of succeeding reproductively, its doing so will affect its descendant's properties, not its own. The situation is somewhat like that in learning theory. The response is given because of the history of reinforcement, and that explains everything that needs to be explained. The mistake in question is intelligible as a consequence of leaving evolutionary history out of Darwinism. Ayala has confused historical narrative explanations with the sort of timeless relationships that one finds in the purely nomothetic disciplines. Much of biology is ahistorical and insofar non-evolutionary, and can even become downright anti-evolutionary. This is true of much population genetics, which attempts to find equilibrium solutions and focuses upon synchronic circumstances. A similar situation exists in other disciplines, notably economics. One can find arguments for not taking a diachronic approach when dealing with certain kinds of problems. But that does not justify a metaphysics in which what has happened to particular things gets eliminated from consideration. The tradition of not taking the historical sciences seriously, indeed of not considering them sciences at all, has had a pernicious effect, not only upon the philosophy of biology, but upon the philosophy of science in general. The situation has been exacerbated by the fact that many biologists have little if any experience in historical thinking. Be that as it may, when an evolutionist speaks of adaptation, it is not just the state, but the process and the product of the process (Ghiselin 1966). Lately it has become increasingly popular, even among philosophers, to recognize that adaptation statements entail, at least implicitly, historical narratives. Some authors, notably Godfrey-Smith (1994), have attempted to make function statements have the same historical character, but there are serious objections to that maneuver (Amundson and Lauder 1994; Ghiselin 1997). Not the least of these is that adaptation often involves</page><page sequence="3">NOTES AND COMMENTS - Hist. Phil. Life Sci., 24 (2002), 487-491 489 change in function (Dohrn 1875; translation by Ghiselin 1994). Treating function as if it were the same as adaptation amounts to redefining the term, and not everybody wants to do that. Persons who advocate Darwinism minus evolution are apt to go along with the old fashioned notion that science deals only with laws of nature and any discipline that deals with particular things is by definition something other than science. But this is a value judgment founded on intellectual taste, not a description of science as it now exists and has long been practiced. If science is rather defined as the pursuit of truth about the material and processual universe, then the questions may be such that there is no other way of answering them properly except to frame them in terms of history. That very point was basic to my proposal for how we should deal with teleology (Ghiselin 1974, 27). We must ask a different sort of question. We no longer ask for whose sake, to what purpose, toward what goal, a thing is or acts. We do not presuppose that ours is the best of all possible worlds, or treat the universe as if it had been constructed by God. We opt for another approach, not because the old modes of thought were altogether useless, for they did well enough in their time, but because the new ones work so much better. A single question does the trick: 'What has happened?' Perhaps I have been guilty of slipping into teleological modes of thought myself, just as I may have slipped into anthropomorphism. But in my work on reproductive strategies I have always tried to ask the question of how a given set of circumstances might affect the reproductive success of conspecifics and then sought to find evidence that such has, as a matter of historical fact, taken place. Ayala admits that many have botched the job when dealing with questions of adaptive significance. But preaching about such matters is not enough. One has to show how to do the job right by means of concrete examples, with real scientific data. Likewise it seems to me that if we are to understand the historical background, more is called for than a few anecdotes, especially without due regard for historical context. In reply to my critics, I can only protest that I base my interpretations of Darwin and Aristotle from having read the opera omnia of those fine intellects. Ayala's claim that Darwin believed in design without a designer is taken from the testimony of someone who wrote a paraphrase of Darwin's book on orchids without mentioning that work in the text (see Ghiselin 1986). There is no dearth of evidence that Darwin was rejecting design at a deep metaphysical level, and came down hard on Asa</page><page sequence="4">490 NOTES AND COMMENTS - Hist. Phil. Life Sci., 24 (2002), 487-491 Gray and others after much reflection (see Ghiselin 1969). And his contemporaries understood that. A good illustration is provided by a recent paper by Gotthelf (1999), commenting upon how Darwin much admired Aristotle, but the translator, Ogle, believed that Darwin had done away with teleology in biology. And of course he had. When dealing with adaptation Darwin reasoned like the geologist that he was, providing explanatory narratives that incorporated laws and principles as well as historical facts. Many of Darwin's critics, such as von Baer (1876) objected to his theory precisely because it did not invoke Zweckmàssigkeit. Teleology therefore needs to be recognized as an epistemological problem, not just an ontological one. It is a matter of right thinking. Ayala says that he would not mind if 'teleology' were abandoned as a term. It seems to me that there are compelling reasons for restricting it to: 1) ontological claims for the existence of intentions upon the part of some foresightful being, and 2) the epistemological error that results from gratuitously presupposing such intention. In an eternal world like Aristode's to be sure, these criteria do not apply in a straight-forward manner. But worlds populated by perpetual motion machines are not an important topic for scientific investigation these days. At issue is not how arcane academic discourse is to be carried out. Rather it is that so far as ontology goes, most people still live in the middle ages. A proper appreciation of Darwin's contribution and its implications depends upon understanding Darwinian thinking. That means getting rid of the kind of thinking that it has replaced. Biologists have the unteaching of teleology as one of their major professional responsibilities, and this task must not be left to the graduate seminar. Everybody who receives an education should know what is wrong with it, just as everybody should know what is wrong with astrology and the gambler's fallacy. Nor is it just a majority of the general public who really believe that life has a purpose and that organisms are designed. There are all sorts of clever people out there who believe or profess to believe such things, and they have agendas. There is still quite a market for works in which, one way or another, Darwin is reconciled with traditional beliefs. The unfortunate quotations from eminent biologists that Ayala provides show that there has been a serious lapse of discipline on the part of scientists. Of course, one can use 'design' as a figure of speech, but one has a responsibility not to let one's words get misinterpreted. Wherever such misunderstanding is apt to arise, there is no legitimate excuse for a scientist to give even the appearance of condoning a metaphysical delusion or a pernicious manner of reasoning. Any use of</page><page sequence="5">NOTES AND COMMENTS - Hist. Phil. Life Sci., 24 (2002), 487-491 491 the term 'design' should be done with clear and explicit disclaimers. Even scare-quotes may not be enough. As to our colleagues in other departments, I hope that they too will exercise proper discretion.
