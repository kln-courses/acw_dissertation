<plain_text><page sequence="1">ANTE-MORTEM OSTEOPATHOLOGY AT CROW CREEK by John B. Gregg Larry J. Zimmerman James P. Steele Helen Ferwerda Pauline S. Gregg ABSTRACT In the mid-fourteenth century/ over 486 individuals apparently were massacred at the Crow Creek Site (39 BF 11), located on the east bank of the Missouri River in South Dakota. During the analysis of the skeletons, a search was made for evidence of diseases, anomalies, and abnormalities which had affected these people during life and had left an imprint upon their bones. The salient pathology is tabulated here, discussed briefly, and illustrated. Because these people had apparently lived and died together in a pre-White contact Initial Coalescent variant village and were probably ancestral to the Arikara, data obtained from this study could provide valuable baseline information for comparison with other studies in paleopathology from the Dakotas. INTRODUCTION The Crow Creek Site (39 BF 11) was first excavated as a part of the Missouri River salvage archeology program by the Nebraska State Historical Society in the mid-1950s (Kivett and Jensen 1976). It is situated on the bluffs overlooking the river, 13 miles due north of Chamberlain, South Dakota. The village site, which is a National Historical Landmark, was protected on its northern boundary by a fortification ditch about 3 meters wide and 375 meters (1250 feet) long. Radiocarbon datings to the years A.D. 1390 and 1325 indicate that the occupants of the village were culturally part of the Initial Coalescent variant, ancestral to the Arikara. They had their origin in groups that had been forced out of the Central Plains by drought and had blended with the people already living along the Missouri River. They were farmers (corn, beans, squash) and hunters, primarily of the bison, on the nearby plains. Similar villages dot the east bank of the Missouri River for many miles upstream from the Crow Creek site. By virtue of accessibility to pot-hunters and the erosion which had increased when the reservoir had filled, the Crow Creek site had been subject to continual destruction. Plans were made by the Corps of Engineers to stabilize the bluffs along the west edge of Crow Creek to control the erosion. In late May, 1978, while members of the South Dakota Archeological Society were inspecting the site, a few human bones were observed to be protruding from the ground near the west end of the fortification ditch, at the place where the soil erosion had caused a deep crevice in the bank. Removal of the bones and engineering work were scheduled. Problems in logistics delayed the arche ological and engineering work at Crow Creek until after July 4th. Before the excavation could start, the bone bed was vandalized by a looter(s) apparently in search of salable artifacts. This person(s) discarded the rem nants of at least 44 people into the deep gully at the west end of the fortification ditch. Because the looter(s)' incursion had very definitely weakened the bank even further, immediate intensive excavation became 287</page><page sequence="2">necessary. To protect the excavators from bank slippage and to make stabilization easier, the excavation was "stepped" back into the bank. When the level of the bones was reached, the magnitude of the total situation became apparent. An area nearly 7 meters square by 1 meter thick was covered with human bones. Men, women, and children were represented in the pile of bones. Remains of very young children were notably few in number. Nearly every skull showed evidence of scalping; many were fractured, the type of fracture indicating the probable type of weapon which had produced the break. Most of the hands were missing, and many feet had been amputated. Many bones showed evidence of molestation by carni vores. Although there were more than 700 articulations of two or more bones, for the most part the skeletons had been extensively dismembered. There was considerable disparity in the numbers of the different bones in the mass burial, suggesting that some of them had not been buried, had been carried off by carnivores, or were not in this "grave" (Table 1). The temporal bone count (right-486, left-477) provided the most accurate assay for the total number of individuals whose skeletons had been exhumed from the common burial. Because the excavation was closed down by inclement December weather and the limits of excavation agreed upon had been reached, it was necessary to leave a conservatively estimated 50 more skeletons in the ground. Because of the dismembered condition of the skeletons and the fragmented condition of many bones, it has not been possible to determine as much about these people, especially the actual frequency of diseases, anomalies, and abnormalities in the skeletons, as had been desired. Although the exact circumstances of this massacre will have to remain enigmatic and conjectural, it seems most likely that the perpetrators of the catastrophe were inhab itants of a nearby village and probably of the same culture. There were undoubtedly a large number of people in the group who attacked the Crow Creek village. It is entirely feasible Table 1.

FROM: Zimmerman et al. 1980:77, 112. 288</page><page sequence="3">that the massacre was made possible by a nighttime attack or by some communal illness which impaired the Crow Creek peoples' ability to fight or flee. Because many of the Crow Creek victims' skulls showed findings suggesting those often attributed to iron deficiency anemia and many of their long bones showed variable numbers of transverse lines, it might be hypothesized that warfare in the region had been precipitated by an interruption in the food supply for the area. METHOD OF ANALYSIS After cleansing, all bones were examined as received by direct evaluation and, when indicated, with some magnification. Articula tions were assessed as a unit and, whenever possible, fragmented bones were glued and then reevaluated. Pathology was located and recorded; anthropomorphic measurements and demographic data were compiled. All abnormal bones and articulations were photo graphed in color and in black-and-white. X Rays were taken of all mastoids, as much as possible of the distal ends of all the long bones, and the majority of the exemplary pathology. Because of the very rigid time constraints, it was necessary that the evalu ation for pathology be done expeditiously, but carefully. Despite the less than optimum working conditions, it is considered very unlikely that any significant pathology was missed in this survey. To facilitate this presentation, ante mortem pathological processes have been categorized: Fig. 1-A. An old, well healed fracture of the proximal femur of an adult male. Note the angulation of the bone and evidence of foreshortening. There is nothing to suggest superimposed infection. I. traumatic lesions II. inflammatory and infectious processes Ml. tumors and cyst-like lesions IV. metabolic and nutritional disturbances V. degenerative processes VI. congenital and developmental anomalies. A tabulation of the total number of instances in each category and exemplary examples will be shown. Because of the disrupted condition of the skeletons and the individual bones, many findings have had to be recorded as the frequency in the total bone pile rather than as the really desirable incidence or prevalence in the population. OSTEOPATHOLOGY FINDINGS I. Physical trauma (Table 2). The findings relating to the paramortem injuries and mutilations are beyond the scope of this study. They will be reported later by Willey and Swegle. The types and numbers of traumatic processes indentifiable in bone were quite similar to those which have been seen previously in the Upper Missouri River Basin (UMRB) and elsewhere. In Figures 1, 2, 3, severe old fractures are seen. The magnitude of these injuries and the apparent longtime survival give evidence of life-support measures available to the injured. Two calvaria had evidence of severe periostitis and osteomyelitis on their outer surfaces, the pattern of which strongly suggested non lethal scalping which long ante-dated death (Fig. 4). A fragment of stone, probably the embedded tip of a projectile point, was lodged in the lateral surface of one innominate bone, Fig. 1-B. X Rays of the femur seen in Figure 1-A. Note the excellent callus formation and good healing, indicating that the affected individual must have lived at least 6-8 months after the injury. 289</page><page sequence="4">Table 2.

Reaction in the bone surrounding this one point suggested that it had been in situ for some time. Fragmentation of the facial bones precluded assay for nasal septal deformities for comparison with previous studies (Steele et al. 1965). II. Inflammatory and infectious processes (Table 3). The external surfaces of two adult calvaria, previously noted under traumatic processes, bore evidence of severe periostitis and osteomyelitis in a pattern indicating probable nonlethal long ante-mortem scalp ing. On the medial surfaces of the calvaria there were many dilated small vascular channels, suggesting reparative response to the peri-cranial injury. Two subadult tibias and fibulas had evidence of subacute or chronic osteomyelitis. Accentuated periostial mark ings were found in 167 bones. Some of the periostitis in tibias was quite suggestive of that associated with treponematosis (Fig. 5). One instance of maxillary sinusitis and four other specimens which had evidence of sinusitis and antraloral fistulae were found (Fig. 6). In the entire Crow Creek bone survey, nothing to suggest the presence of tuberculosis was found. The findings in the mastoid X Rays of the Crow Creek skulls are in Table 4. The development of the mastoid air cell system takes place primarily in about the first four years of life, but does not stop until in the mid-teens. Upper respiratory infections and middle ear infections (otitis media) during the time of the air cell development may obstruct or alter the air cell development. Alterations which occur during this development can be 290</page><page sequence="5">Fig. 2-A. An old, well healed, severely depressed fracture in the left frontal region of an adult male. No other defect was present in the fragmented skull. seen on X Rays as long as the temporal bones are preserved. The Crow Creek mastoids were interpreted according to the classification of Trimble (1934) as pneumatic (normal), sclero tic (definitely abnormal), mixed (probably indicative of otitis media during develop ment), and atypical (air cell patterns which are unusual and may or may not indicate otitis media during development). Five hundred sixteen of the 837 Crow Creek temporal bones upon which mastoid X Rays were taken (61 %) were pneumatic; 26 (3%) were sclerotic) 242 (29%) showed mixed type air cell develop ment; and 53 (7%) had diploic or large and unusual shaped air cells. Two mastoids had changes indicating the presence of cholestea toma, a serious and potentially lethal com plication of chronic otitis media. The findings in the Crow Creek temporal bones will be compared with other mastoid studies which have been made in the UMRB. III. Tumors and cyst-like lesions (Table 5). Two localized neoplasms which were invading Fig. 2-B. X Rays of the skull seen in Figure 2-A. Arrows indicate the fracture which is well healed, markedly displaced medially. and replacing bone were discovered in Crow Creek bones, one in the proximal humerus and the other in the distal tibia (Figs. 7, 8). X Rays and "clinical data" relating to these specimens were referred to the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, and there were reviewed by Doctor Lent Johnson. He interpreted the tumor in the humerus as an osteochondoma and the tibial lesion as probably representing old, late stage fibrous dysplasia (Johnson 1980, personal communi cation). Exostoses were found in 45 (4.7%) of the external auditory canals. Other osteomas were present in the femur (3), tibia (1), parietal bone (2), temporal bone (1), and there were three torus palatinus changes. Two osteoid osteomas were found in the tibia and humerus. Bone spurs were present in the tibia (4), clavicle (1), fibula (1), and femur (1). Fig. 3. A lesion in an adult right parietal bone characterized by bone loss, smooth, irregular bone replacement, apparent cyst formation, and accentua tion of the points of attachment of the temporalis fascia. The medial surface of the bone was not abnormal. This is interpreted as probably the residua of a skull fracture, avascular necrosis of bone, incomplete repair of the defect, and cyst formation. 291</page><page sequence="6">Table 3.

Cyst-like changes in bone were seen in 12 instances in bones from various portions of the skeletons. Nothing to suggest the effect of cancer, primary in bone or metastatic to bone, was seen in the Crow Creek specimens. IV. Metabolic and nutritional disturbances (Table 6). Findings suggesting the effects of iron deficiency anemia as manifested by cribra orbitalia and porotic hyperostosis were present in 28 children and subadult skulls. Because many of the supraorbital plates were absent or fragmented, it was not possible to obtain any more accurate information (Table 7). Transverse lines were present in many long bone X Rays, most notably in the distal tibias. An unusual type of transverse line, one we had not noted before, was seen almost universally in the distal humeri. These lines resembled the stripes of a master sergeant. Because they were very common in the Crow Creek bones but are uncommon in clinical X Rays today and in other X Rays of humeri which we have seen, it is intended to pursue the matter to determine their actual signifi cance (Fig. 9). Data relating to transverse lines in the Crow Creek long bones will be reported later._ Fig. 5. An adult tibia and fibula showing evidence of severe, atypical periostitis and osteitis, primarily in the tibia. X Rays of the tibia showed almost complete obliteration of the marrow space. Several other similar bones were found in the Crow Creek skeletons. These findings are highly suspicious for those of trepone matosis. Dental disease, which included tooth wear and attrition, dental abscesses, and antral-oral fistulae, were common in the Crow Creek skulls. Because of the fragmentation of bones it was most difficult to determine the actual statistical frequency of individual dental abnormalities. An interesting and unusual finding in the proximal tibias, the distal and proximal femurs, and in the proximal portions of the humeri of children in the 7-11 and the 13-16 year age brackets, was extremely variable vascular markings upon the bone surface in the region near the epiphyseal plates. There was marked disproportion in the amount and the extent of the vascular changes in individuals who probably were about the same age at the time of death (Fig. 10). Similar changes, but less intense and variable, are present in other skeletons from the UMRB. The question is raised as to whether these vascular changes at the ends of growing long bones could be a manifestation of disturbed metabolism or nutrition. Although seen occasionally, the changes were not as notable in other long bones. V. Degenerative processes (Table 8). Definite changes suggesting the effects of osteoporosis were found in 276 bones.

The knees and the temporomand ibulars were the diarthrodial joints most commonly involved by degenerative changes. VI. Congenital and developmental anom alies (Table 9). Eighty-one anomalies oc curred in the cranio-facial area, and 278 were found elsewhere. Most were of minor propor tion and would have caused little or no diffi culty to the individual during life. Unusual anomalies in the cranio-facial area included one mandible which showed evidence of probable hemifacial microsomia, and as such had an 86% chance of having had a deformity of the ossicles (malleus/incus) and a 90.7% chance of a deformed external ear during life (Caldarelli et al. 1980). Unfortunately, this mandible was not articulated or articulatable with the remainder of a skull (Fig. 11). The neck and head of another mandible were 2.5 cm longer on the right side. Here also, it was not possible to match the mandible and a skull, so no further information is forthcoming relating to the total person. The atlas was fused to the occiput of one adult skull and 294</page><page sequence="9">Fig. 7. The proximal portion of an adult humerus with a bony tumor projecting laterally. The X Ray shows the internal structure of the tumor. This was interpreted as an osteochondroma. paracondyloid processes were observed in 49 adult and subadult occipital bones. Proximal congenital radius-ulna synostosis was found in two adult specimens which were located about .75 meters apart in the Crow Creek communal burial. It was not possible to establish whether they were from the same individual. Many defects were found in the spine. These included bifid, absent, fused, and defective vertebral arches; single and multiple defects involving the arches and the vertebral bodies; and assimilations with and without associated arch defects (Fig. 12).

Inflammatory and infectious processes dis covered in the Crow Creek bones included two calvaria into which was etched inflam matory response strongly suggesting the effects of nonlethal scalping which long ante-dated death. These confirmed that scalping per se was not lethal, that it ante-dated the European contact, and that it represented a part of the extant culture. Osteomyelitis was found in these people; periostitis due to several causes was not unusual; periostial reaction which was very suspicious for that associated with tre ponematosis was encountered on several occasions.

Similar lines were found very commonly in the Crow Creek X Rays. infections were found very frequently in the realm of dentistry, less commonly in the sinuses, and quite frequently in the middle ear-mastoid areas of the Crow Creek skulls. Nothing to suggest the effects of tuber culosis was seen in the Crow Creek skeletons. A probable osteochondroma in the proxi mal humerus and an example of probable late stage fibrous dysplasia in the distal tibia were present in two adult skeletons. Two lesions which were very suggestive of osteoid osteomas were seen in adult bones, one in a tibia and one in a humerus.

Transverse lines were present in a majority of tibias and some other long bones, reflecting the possibility of metabolic and nutritional deficiencies during the period of growth. Preliminary evaluation suggests that both these changes were more common at Crow Creek than they have been in other UMRB skeletal collections. Bony changes reflecting those of osteo porosis, vertebral lipping, and degenerative alterations in diarthrodial joints were found in a very significant number of instances, commensurate with the findings in other UMRB skeletons.

One instance of probable hemifacial microsomia was found in a mandible, and another mandible had 2.5 cm asymmetry in the height of the heads. Two instances of synostosis of the proximal radius and ulna, one the right and one the left side, were in the common grave. It was not possible to determine whether these represented one or two individuals. Many occult congenital anom alies, primarily in the spine, were scattered throughout the Crow Creek skeletons. The locations, types, and degrees of these anomalies were very similar to the findings in other skeletal populations and in the general population of the United States today. Comparative analysis of the Crow Creek congenital anomalies and other skeletal groups will be made and reported later. In summary, it can be stated that in general the findings of osteopathology in the Crow Creek massacre victims' bones were quite similar in almost all respects to those in other UMRB skeletal populations. This is despite the fact that the skeletons and individual bones were quite disrupted. Because of the large disparity in the representation of individual bones, e.g., hands and feet, it was not possible to do some of the comparative studies which were envisioned when the Crow Creek project was begun.

The analysis of the Crow Creek massacre victims' skeletons for evidence of diseases, anomalies, and abnormalities will provide some excellent baseline information for comparison with other UMRB skeletal populations and with skeletal populations from elsewhere.
