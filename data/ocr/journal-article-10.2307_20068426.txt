Grasset, Paris, 1954 (artwork ? 2005 Estate of Yves Klein/ADAGP (Paris)/ SODRAC (Montr?al), photograph provided by Archives Klein, Paris) Recent abstract art actively works against the paradigms of purity and autonomy ' A self-conscious revision of its heritage is a striking feature of its renewed vital ity Commentators have recognized the import of impurities within the founding practices of the field. Briony Fer has revealed the aberrations integral to Piet Mondrian's paintings, for example, as Allan Kaprow did in the 1960s when he wrote that "the impure aspect of pure painting like Mondrian's is not some hid den compositional flaw but rather the psychological setting which must be impure for the notion of purity to make any sense at all."2 Here I will develop and exam ine a paradigm of mid-twentieth-century I Features I abstraction's resistance to the norms of purity and autonomy in Yves Klein's agonistic reception of the monochrome, that com pressed but not so rarefied Russian doll that sits inside abstract painting just as abstraction inhabits the core of modernism.3 Klein systematically took the avant-garde monochrome beyond the frame of painting. Seeing his work as a precedent in this regard underscores Klein's historical importance and connects recent work not usually regarded as monochromatic or abstract to a genealogy in which he is pivotal. Klein scholars and supporters?especially Thomas McEvilley, Pierre Restany, and Sidra Stich? document his legacy for recent and contemporary art, including abstraction. Others are at best ambivalent about the artist and his patrimony. Benjamin Buchloh claims that Klein, in company with Joseph Beuys, has been "overesti mated in U.S. reception."4 Thierry de Duve's writing in this context seems pulled in two irreconcilable directions. On the one hand, he asserts that Klein's "only tangible contribution to the history of painting is the chemical formula that allowed him to fix powdered pigment without diminishing its glow," yet in an instructive endnote about his reception in the United States, de Duve struggles with the tension between Klein's alleged "failure" and the fact that he "is not a negligible artist."5 More serious questions about the neo-avant-garde notwith standing, a (usually) unspoken discomfort with Klein the provocateur and supposedly right-wing sympathizer colors the interpretation of his work.6 The phrase "matting the monochrome" refers simultaneously to the intrin sic and extrinsic contexts in which we might reconsider this type of abstraction today. One "mats" a work of art as a way of presenting it against something that it is not, a practice that applies to the installation of the work as well as to its internal composition and reception. As Klein showed in his struggle with Kazimir Malevich's reputation, matting in these senses is not a trivial concern. The other abiding passion of "Yves le monochrome" was judo. Here again, mats are not merely supplemental but necessary support planes, limits, and frames for the martial arts. I will argue that the specific Zen attributes of the judo form Klein studied in Japan and promoted in Spain and France with his teaching and writ ing informed his innovations and excesses in abstract art throughout his short but prolific career and are exemplary of his holistic, as opposed to pure or autonomous, sense of art practice. The two types of matting, one intimate to art making and viewing, the other apparently extraneous to the aesthetic, come together in a way that is typical not only of Klein's work but of the productive theatricality of much abstract art since the 1960s, practices that I will contrast with Michael Frieds theory of absorption. 95 art journal Elements of this article were presented in 2004 at the CAA Annual Conference in Seattle and as part of the 2004 Teetzel Lectures at University College, University of Toronto.

Mus?e national d'art moderne, Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris (artwork ? 2005 Estate of Yves Klein/ADAGP (Paris)/SODRAC (Montr?al), photograph provided by Archives Klein, Paris) Matted Monochromes Monochromes were Klein's first and omnipresent aesthetic obsession. He notor iously appropriated the unmarred back of the blue sky as his work in 1946, painted blue the vault of a basement room where he and his youthful comrades hung out, printed reproductions of putatively earlier monochromes in his book let Yves Peintures of 19^4, and conceived a film in that year in which the opening scenes moved from monochrome white, through yellow and red, to ultramarine blue. The list of his innovations is much longer; he foretold and inspired many of the moves abstraction would make after World War II, not to mention an array of the directions to be taken by other art forms, from kinetic to performance to Conceptual art.7 In 195s? a large orange monochrome Klein submitted to the Salon des R?alit?s Nouvelles was rejected, sparking the first in a long and profes sionally productive series of public scandals around his work when his friends toured the exhibition, demanding to know where the work was displayed. When he exhibited monochromes in Paris in 1956, comparisons with Malevich's vin tage monochromes were made by Pierre Restany in his catalogue essay. Klein later responded with genealogical mappings that will concern us here.8 In texts and several versions of a cartoon about the Ukrainian artist, Klein outrageously positioned his work as prior to Malevich's. Mal?vitch ou l'espace vu de loin ("Malevich or Space from a Distance," also titled in another version "The True Position of Malevich in Relation to Me") of circa 19^8 shows Malevich anachronistically copying a Klein monochrome. Kandinsky's reputation seems also to be at stake in this struggle for priority: like a mouse, he is about to disappear into the wall.9 In his extensive writing project, the "Monochrome Adventure," Klein quotes Malevich's exhortation to the "aviators" of the future: "Fly! White, free, and end less, infinity is before you" (Stich 74). But Malevich remains the earthbound copyist in this caricature, painting only a lowly portrait or still-life "after" Klein. Klein wrote: "I can say at thirty years of age in 19^8, that when Malevich burst into space like a tourist around 1915" or 1916,1 welcomed him and he visited me because I was already, since always, owner, inhabitant . . ." (quoted in Stich 74). Jean Tinguely suggested that Klein had thus "dematerialized the fact that Malevich had preceded him" (MJT 53). McEvilley takes the pessimistic view that Klein is here suffering from the anxiety of influence, as he did in relation to Marcel Duchamp and indeed his own parents, both of whom were artists. Much of Klein's "own achievement paralleled works and attitudes that [these] two artists had expressed in the teens of the century. Sensitive to questions of prior ity, obsessed with the modernist idea of the artist as innovator, and at the same time willing to play the fool, Klein argued that by a proper understanding of time he in fact preceded Malevich" (MJT 7). There is parodie humor in the cartoon as well as a need for priority, but the more acute aspects of Klein's gesture toward Malevich make McEvilley's neg ative judgment seem hasty Klein's claim to be the first to have manifested the true monochrome, that which partook of what he would call pure sensibility rather than merely art, is not without foundation. His monochromes were not framed by an atmospheric "background" or three-dimensional space, as Malevich's were. White on White (1918) addressed this issue of image against ground but did not eradicate the dialectic. Large White Cross of 1920 exploits the 96 WINTER 200S 6. See for example Hal Foster's complaint that Klein's supposedly "Dadaist provocation was turned into bourgeois spectacle," a view that mis understands and shortchanges Klein's relationship to Malevich and the avant-garde generally. Klein repeatedly denied any simple connection between his work and Dada. I would argue that in his rela tionship with Malevich's black square, discussed below, Klein performed what Foster hopes to achieve with his own laudable study, "a temporal exchange between historical and neo-avant gardes, a complex relation of anticipation and reconstruction." Foster, The Return of the Real: The Avant-Garde at the End of the Century (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1996), 11,13 (italics removed in latter passage). My claims for Klein here would, if plausible, imply a revision of both Buchloh's and Foster's assessment of Klein's place in the neo-avantgarde. 7.

As Fer reminds us, Donald Judd recognized what was new about Klein's monochromes, that they are not "spatial." They do not create the illusion or reality of space in the way that Cubism or collage did.IO Indeed, from Judd's perspective, Klein emphasized the object status, not the illusory space, of his monochromes by hanging them well away from the wall and rounding their corners in 1957 exhibitions in Milan and D?sseldorf (MJT 21). Klein actively sought to displace and even destroy the easel picture, both by removing the usual viewing coordinates of the image and with his fire paint ings. His "studio" was life itself. Later, he produced a great variety of three dimensional 1KB (International Klein Blue) works. But we need to remember too that Klein's monochromes were not "specific objects." "Pure sensibility" for Klein was more a mystical than a perceptual category, one drawn from his inter ests in Zen Buddhism, Gaston Bachelard's writings on space, and Rosicrucian ism." He thought of his monochromes, and color itself, as living presences, not fully belonging to the material world. Yet radical as Klein's revisions of him were, Malevich was not the easel painter Klein needed him to be. The black monochrome was a quasi-religious and social icon, whether in the 1915 o. 10 exhibition, where one version proclaimed its icon status from high in a corner of the room, or in agitprop excursions. Malevich was the first to be so com pletely identified with the monochrome, as pictures of his deathbed, funeral (the black square was the hood ornament on his hearse), and grave site attest. Matted Judoka How did Klein's lifelong commitment to judo interact with his "monochrome adventure"?The martial art was Klein's first infatuation. In the early 1950s he envisioned a career as a high-ranking judoka, a champion and teacher. Despite set backs and constant battles with the judo association in France, he realized many of these goals. Historians have commented on Klein's early promotion to black belt in Nice, where he studied judo 1947-52, and his training at the Kodokan Institute in Tokyo in 1952-53. The scholarly literature duly notes that Klein made a film in Japan in 1953 (Stich 34) about the correct performance of judo kata? the formal exercises that form the grammar of the discipline?and that stills were used to illustrate his book les Fondements du judo, published in France in 1954, which brought the "true" Japanese style of Kodokan to France. Klein supple mented the physical skills taught in the do jo in France with readings in Zen and Buddhist thought, and he deepened his understanding of these underpinnings of Kodokan judo in Japan. "Judo," he wrote early in his training, is "the discovery by the human body of a spiritual space" (quoted in Stich 17). There was a clear connection in Klein's experience between the momentary weightlessness of a judo throw and his notorious Leap into the Void of i960. He extolled the judo inspi ration of the Leap in a gloss on the famous photo published in a section of his mock newspaper, Dimanche, of i960: "The monochrome, who is also a judo champion, black belt, 4th dan, trains regularly in dynamic l?vitation! (with or without a net, at great risk to his life) . . ." "Let's be honest," Klein continued, "in order to paint space, I must put myself on the spot, in space itself" (quoted in Stich 217 and McE 235).Though his theoretical interest in l?vitation also came from Max Heindel's Rosierucianism texts (McE 41), the practice was pure judo. 98 WINTER 2005 10.

October 1960, artistic action of Yves Klein, photography by Shunk-Kunder (artwork ? 2005 Estate ofYves Klein/ ADAGP (Paris)/SODRAC (Montr?al), pho tograph provided by Archives Klein, Paris) Klein wrote that judo was "always abstract and spiritual" (quoted in Stich 33). Anticipating his .Anthropom?trie performances, he had thought early on of pigment ing judoka so that the imprints of their bodies could be preserved and contem plated during judo exercises (Arman in Stich 269 n. 4). It is notable that Klein partially distanced himself from both performances, first by assuming the role of cameraman and later by conducting the anthropometries in a tuxedo. He famously described the first .Anthropom?trie as follows: "The time of the brush had ended and finally my knowledge of judo was going to be useful. My models were my brushes ... [I] devised a sort of ballet of girls smeared on a grand can vas which resembled the white mat of judo contests" (quoted in Stich 171-72). Not only did his judo pupils of the time catch Klein in a tarpaulin on one of his attempts to fly?after the master landed unassisted on the first attempt and twisted his ankle (Stich 213-14)?but, as McEvilley has suggested, the personal risk of this embodied conceptual performance initiated the "self-endangerment" work of Beuys, Carolee Schneemann, and Paul McCarthy, who himself attempted Klein's leap (MJT 11). Here then is the other sense of "matting the monochrome" crucial to Klein and typical of his spongelike penchant for finding inspiration beyond a narrowly 99 art journal</page><page sequence="7">artistic context. Ultimately, for Klein such a separation simply did not exist, which is why his martial- and fine-art activities should not be sequestered in our attempt to understand him. Buchloh expresses the standard view, one infused with (warranted) suspicion: "Klein's aspiration to be perceived as a judoka/artist made him the neo-avantgarde's first japoniste, one situated between the ancient culture of judo as a ritualistic performance of war and the contemporary condi tion after Hiroshima.",2 But the evidence suggests that judo was much more than another of Klein's publicity stunts. It was continuous with the Leap into the Void and Anthropometries. The prototype for the still-controversial Anthropom?trie perfor mance in March i960 took place in June 1958 in the home of the prominent judoka Robert J. Godet (Stich 172). Although Klein's intention was to have the pigmented models cover a white paper sheet on the floor to produce a blue monochrome?as he had envisioned judoka doing?the event degenerated into an erotic spectacle displeasing to Klein, if not Godet.'3 In certain ways the canvas and judo mat were interchangeable, or indeed one, for Klein, as were his art and his life. Frequently these mats of one color shared the same surrounding space and defined their internal space in the same ways, that is, as irrefrag ably material entities that nonetheless promised transcendence. His judo school in Madrid had monochromes on the walls in 1953?54 (McE 40), as did his Judo Acad?mie de Paris, each seven to eight meters long?one blue, one white, one rose? along with the orange monochrome that Klein tried to exhibit in 1955 (Stich 257 n. 11 ; 56?57). Klein's private school in Paris was open for less than a year, but he was able to consolidate there the active meditation common to judo and the monochromes. Both were sources of "sensibility" in the important sense that with each type of monochrome one could move from the embodied, material presentations on a defined surface to a sense of Zen limitlessness and oneness of spirit and form. His collaborator Tinguely recalled perhaps the most significant relationship between judo and art for Klein: balance as a goal if not a starting point. "He didn't do it as an athlete. Just as he didn't do monochromes as a 'space.' He didn't have . . . the balance within himself. He did monochromes in a panic ... He had none of what it'd be normal to have to do monochromes . . . an equilibrium. He was the most unbalanced man?totally unbalanced. He did monochromes as an iconoclastic anti-painter" (quoted in MJT 49). Klein took his judo studies extremely seriously and derived some sense of balance from his high achievements. His partner in the late 1950s, fellow judoka and architect Bernadette Allain, said that "on the judo mats he was serene, strong, and inwardly at peace. He had learned in Japan the true judo, which was nonexistent in the French schools?judo as intensive discipline and ascesis, which confers on the body itself a knowledge that has never passed through the intellectual mind" (quoted in McE 39). What we might call the preliminary or provisional space of the judo mat and of the monochrome surface equally required equilibrium on the part of the judoka/artist. By bringing these spaces together in practice, Klein was able to perform successfully in both. Success in these areas meant the effec tive elimination of the boundaries of the body, painterly materials, color, and even space itself, a goal reached most dramatically in Klein's notorious leaps into the void. We know all this and much more about Klein and judo. It is therefore all the more surprising that McEvilley initiated an abiding "moving on from judo" 100 WINTER 200? 12. Benjamin H. D. Buchloh, "Into the Blue: Klein and Poses," Artforum 33, no. 10 (1995): 92. 13. Klein's friendship with Godet exemplifies again the artist's inability to acknowledge his sources, whether in art or elsewhere. In 1952, Godet, a black belt judoka, published Tout le Judo: Son his toire, sa technique, sa philosophie, which was in important ways the book Klein sought to write but never fully realized. Godet 's elegant text expounds fully the connections between judo and Zen that remained integral to Klein's practice from his time in Japan but also stayed mostly in his notes for never-realized publications. As Klein did in Les Fondements du Judo two years later, Godet underlined the importance of kata, the fundamen tal distinctions between the martial arts and sport, and of the integration of judo and life. There was little in Godet 's book that Klein would have dis agreed with. Yet Klein did have reason to bring out his own work and to make large claims for it: he had studied at the Kodokan and was legiti mately part of the Kano heritage. He also had his film stills, which in his book illustrated the accred ited kata techniques.</page><page sequence="8">Advertisement for Yves Klein's Paris judo school, 1955, 14/ x 11y8 in.

This point marks the real beginning of his career as an artist" (McE 97). McEvilley suggests that Klein moved from a "'king dom of judo" in Spain to a "kingdom of art in Paris" (McE 41). Stich concurs but dates the transition later, after he stopped teaching. Because he was traveling frequently to Gelsenkirchen, Germany, for a major commission to decorate the new theater there, Klein had trouble fulfilling his commitments at the American Students and Artists Center, where he had taught since 195s? and did not have his contract renewed in 1959. He did not teach formally after this time. To suggest, as Stich and McEvilley do, that Klein "clearly had reached the point where his identity as an artist had surpassed his identity as a judoka," and that this and other difficulties conspired to bring an "end to his active involvement with judo" (Stich 257 n. 16), however, is to overstate the case in a way that both flies in the face of Klein's activities before his premature death in 1962 and misses an important dimension of his devotion to the plastic and martial arts. Stich warrants that Klein's early monochromes "are conceptually more in tune with an Eastern, Zen approach to life ..." (67), but largely discusses Zen as 101 art journal</page><page sequence="9">a sensibility without its connection to judo practice. McEvilley notes that Klein's artistic alchemy combined Rosierucianism and Zen, but he is quick to leave judo out of the picture (McE 243).There is ample evidence that Klein continued to "practice" judo after his formal teaching ended in 1959: pictures from October i960 show him executing throws; Dimanche, with its illustrations of and refer ences to judo, went on sale on November 27, i960. Stich also records that Klein's long battle for recognition by the French Judo Federation, the strongest such organization outside Japan, ended belatedly in success on April 24, 1961 (Stich 157 n. 16), and that he felt vindicated. During his disastrous exhibition at the Castelli Gallery in New York in 1961, he apparently annoyed everyone by boast ing about his judo achievements (Stich 232). For Klein, as a Kodokan student, judo was emphatically not a sport. He wrote his book and taught his classes to establish a fuller sense of the martial art in France. What Klein believed about judo and brought home both personally and professionally is summed up in the following undated note: "The ordinary judoka does not practice spiritually but physically and emotionally. The true judoka practices spiritually and with a pure sensibility" (Stich 25-6 n. 40). Klein refused to separate the spiritual from the physical. We should be wary of the Hegelian drumbeat that claims Klein's art overtook his incarnation of judo principles. Artists and art do not need to be seen to progress, especially not from an external interest to a concentration on art. The monochrome, Rosier ucianism, and judo, plus the many other initiatives that preoccupied Klein, mixed to form a somehow consistent life as artwork. Klein believed that "painting is no longer a function of the eye today; it is a function of the only thing that is in us that does not belong to us: our LIFE."'4 The elements of space, duration, and touch crucial to his sense of judo in part led to Klein's holistic aesthetic. "Art does not depend on vision," he wrote, "but on the sensibility that affects us, on affectivity therefore, and on that much more than all that touches our five senses" (quoted Stich 142). Kodokan judo stressed the integration of body and spirit in the service of more than the self. Jigoro Kano, the founder of judo and the Kodokan school, wrote: "The aim of judo is to utilize physical and mental strength most effectively. Its training is to understand the true meaning of life through the mental and physical training of attack and defense. You must develop yourself as a person and become a useful citizen to society."ls Klein's Fondements du judo is in one sense his second genealog ical exercise and is more linear than his treatment of Malevich. Here he actively shaped his identity as an inheritor of the tradition of judo founded in 1882 by Kano, whose stern image is on the frontispiece. We read the founder's statement that "the katas are the aesthetic of judo." On the next page is a photograph of Risei Kano, son of the founder, and the president of the Kodokan and of the Japan Judo Federation when Klein studied in Japan. Following this introduc tion?and adopting a traditional chronological sequence eschewed with respect to Malevich?Klein further establishes his lineage and legitimacy with photos of his fourth-dan certificate and a picture of himself with Risei Kano and other ranking judoka at the Institute. Risei Kano wrote to Klein in 1953 on his achieve ment of the fourth dan: "Judo of the Kodokan, as you already know . . . [is] a moral ideal: it is the accomplishment of the perfect personality" (quoted in Stich 37). No one would hold that Klein went very far in perfecting his immensely difficult personality, but neither did he give up the attempt. Judo was one of his 102 WINTER 2005 14.

Klein's work is a sensible reminder or remainder of this belief. He did not want his monochromes to be a specialty within an artistic arsenal but rather to lead beyond the genre abstrac tion, and especially beyond the gestural work of his famous mother, Marie Raymond. Klein worked on a larger "canvas" as his "Blue Revolution" sought to "impregnate" the world with pure sensibility. He sought to defeat the autonomy of the individual senses, the art media, and the art object. Unwittingly but prophetically, he provided potent alternatives to Greenberg's theory of media "competence"16 and Frieds notion of "absorption." The Theatricality of Absorption In Art and Objecthood, Michael Fried claims that he "described the emergence of a basic opposition between the radically abstract painting and sculpture I most admired and what I characterized, pejoratively, as the 'literalist' and 'theatrical' work of a group of artists usually called the Minimalists." '7 Theatricality is defined by a particular relationship between viewer and work, one that "solicited and included the beholder in a way that was fundamentally antithetical to the expressive and presentational mode of the recent painting and sculpture I most admired" (Fried 41). While Fried cautions us against drawing easy connections between his art criticism and his subsequent art-historical project of tracing the history of what he came, by 1980, to call "Absorption and Theatricality" in the tradition of French art and criticism from about 17^0 to about 1870, the opposi tion of these terms in his thinking is important to my argument about recent abstract art. Fried wrote recently that "no one with even the sketchiest awareness of recent history needs to be told that 'theatricality' . . . went on to flourish spectacularly while abstraction in my sense of the term became more and more beleaguered" (Fried 14). He stopped writing art criticism largely for this reason. My claim is not simply that theatrical art forms won the day but rather that the interactive, social, and impure paradigms that they presented offered a compet ing and substantial view of what abstraction could be. A different relationship between absorption and theatricality functions in significant abstract work from the 1960s to the present, especially in Klein. For Fried, absorption in the French modernist tradition, which to some extent figures as the genealogy of the mid-twentieth-century abstraction that he championed (Fried 51), required that the painter "negate or neutralize . . . the primordial convention that paintings are made to be beheld" (Fried 47-48). Artists show figures completely absorbed in their activities?in a Chardin or Greuze or David, for example?to the extent that, Fried continues, "the painting appeared self-sufficient, autonomous, a closed system independent of, in that sense blind to, the world of the beholder" (Fried 48). That this grand fiction of the beholder's absence drove much of modernism is clear. But there were and are many competing models of reception, opposed to the absorptive in Fried's pro phylactic sense, where viewer and work are held apart. In Klein's work there is a crucial recognition of the positive force of sensibility as it is absorbed. This model is indeed more literal in the sense that it acknowledges as a positive element the participation of the audience in the work. His memorable sponge sculptures, for example, were anthropomorphic bearers of "absorption" in a 103 art journal 16. "It quickly emerged that the unique and proper area of competence of each art coincided with all that was unique in the nature of its medi um. The task of self-criticism became to eliminate from the specific effects of each art any and every effect that might conceivably be borrowed from or by the medium of any other art. Thus would each art be rendered 'pure,' and in its purity find the guarantee of its standards of quality as well as of its independence."

He referred to the many examples of this type as "portraits" and celebrated these "readers of my monochromes who, after having seen, after having traveled in the blue of my paintings, come back totally impregnated in sensibility like the sponges" (quoted in Stich 16^). Recent Adjustments of Impurity In living an expansive aesthetic life to the extreme, Klein embodied what has become the hallmark of many acclaimed artists since his time: a protean creativity that refuses to respect modernist boundaries of medium or method (McE 12). Abstraction and especially the monochrome became for many of these artists, as they were for Klein, not special areas of competence but rather experiments, infections, contagions. This expansion of the purview of "abstraction" accords with Philip Guston's prophetic vision of the changes in abstract art that would arise in part as a reaction against purist formalism. "There is something ridicu lous and miserly," he claimed in i960, "in the myth we inherit from abstract art. That painting is autonomous, pure and for itself, and therefore we habitually analyze its ingredients and define its limits. But painting is 'impure.' It is the adjustment of'impurities' which forces painting's continuities."l8 The radicality of recent abstraction is not found in the self-criticality and containment of the visual language. While this may have been the case in the mid-twentieth century, as Greenberg, Fried, and others argued so vigorously, assertions of aesthetic autonomy seem dated now, as much in abstract art as in the many forms that would replace its hegemonic mid-century paradigms. Rather than a survey of these recent developments, I will instead present two final case studies. The group General Idea extended the genealogy of abstraction that I have traced from Malevich to Klein. GI's debts to the Klein of monochromatic blue impregnations were much greater than has been articulated in the scholarly liter ature on the group; this said, it would be difficult to imagine a more political redeployment of Klein's art, which in its original social contexts-was allegedly right-wing and at the least quietistic.'9 As early as their film Test Tube in 1979? with its "blue moment"?and up to the dissolution of the group more than a decade ago, its members engaged in "monochrome research" inspired by Yves le monochrome himself.20 Happily borrowing the "chroma key blue" used in this film, they mirrored Klein's 1KB and inaugurated a "blue period" as Klein had done, garnering an outrageous reference not only to Pablo Picasso but to the later artist as well. In a parodie homage to Klein's Anthropometries, the three GI artists deployed poodles?their canine alter egos at the time?as nonhuman brushes to inscribe "XXX Blue."21 Blue shards of a collapsed structure and a com memorative blue pamphlet issued from the 1985 exhibition in Middelburg, Holland: Khroma Key Klub:The Blue Ruins from the 1984 Miss General Idea Pavilion. GI's AIDS Stamps invoke not only Robert Indiana's LOVE logo but also Klein's 1KB stamps in their format as well as hue. Latterly, the group took on the guise of doctors, medical researchers not only attending to their own health but prescribing aes thetic antidotes to the viral outbreak of AIDS. The artists' deference to Klein takes 105 art journal 18. Philip Guston, "The Philadelphia Panel," ed. P. G. Pavia and Irving Sandler, It Is 5 (Spring I960): 38. 19. I would like to thank Serge Guilbaut for insist ing on this point. Here again there is a connection with judo. During his second stay in Madrid as an instructor, Klein bragged about having the chief of police as a pupil. Restany claims that Klein actually trained military personnel in Franco's Spain. But as Stich argues, this does not make Klein or his work fascist. His comrade Arman underlines the irony of the situation: "Yves is often accused of being fascist, but if you knew Yves it is ridiculous to say this because Yves wouldn't abide by anything but his own fascism or imperialism" (quoted in Stich 41-42). Even if we deny the validity of Klein's work on these grounds, can we rightly condemn his reception by shooting the messenger again, a reception that includes the overtly and arguably redemptive adoption of his blue revolution by General Idea? 20.

Quoting Klein, they fastened on artistic borrowing as what he called "'seizing'... through impregnation in sensibility" (Gl 60). For ideas to be "in the air" was, for Klein, a sign of their immateriality and sophistication. Punning on the metaphors so important to Klein's "urbanism of the air," Gl enthused that "inspi ration from other artists continued to arrive out of the blue." The text concludes with a section (later made into an artist's book) titled "XXX Voto," a reference to Klein's devotion to Saint Rita (c. 1381-c. 1456), patron saint of lost causes and impossible projects, whose shrine in Cascia, Italy, Klein visited many times, finally leaving an elaborate ex-voto there in 1958. For the saint, Gl substituted its fictive muse, Miss General Idea, and thanked her for her "aeration of the breath lessness of ultramarine" (Gl 63). In their prayers to the "XXX" patron of their lives, the artists ask that she might prevent enemies "from infecting us with anything that contaminates us, ever; please make us, and all your works, totally invulnerable" (Gl 64). But this prayer was the ultimate impossibility. The group's fantasy of playing doctor was dystopian, as were some of their final collabora tions, the "infected abstracts" of Mondrian, Gerrit Rietveldt, and Ad Reinhardt. Two of GI's members died of AIDS soon after, and the group was disbanded. Not all recent monochromes are paintings. Klein experimented with "pure" space and light in an emptied room at the home of Colette Allendy that was part of a May 1957 exhibition. He titled this zone of sensibility Les Surfaces et blocs de 106 WINTER 200S</page><page sequence="14">General Idea, AIDS Stamps, 1988, offset on perforated paper, 10x8'/ in.

The nascent concept of the void as a palpably present absence would structure his most notorious exhibition and performance, that of Le Vide in 1958. His Zen and mystical leanings were driving a dematerialization in his art, which became more spiritual as the monochrome transmuted from pigment on canvas to light in space. As McEvilley has emphasized, Klein painstakingly orchestrated the inter actions of his monochrome paintings and monochrome spaces. In a text from Dimanche, for example, in which he described many aspects of his own work, both extant and projected, Klein imagined an installation called Les Cinq S?lles: "In order to promote the direct experience of feeling and matter without the inter mediary of energy, spectators pass through five rooms, their feet bound by ball and chain. Nine monochrome blue paintings of the same format are in the first room; the second room is empty and entirely white; nine monogold paintings of the same format are in the third room; the fourth room is empty and dark, almost black; nine monopink paintings of the same format are in the fifth room" (quoted in Stich 213). Whether purposefully or not, in the 1997 Room for One Color, Olafur Eliasson modified and extended Klein's monochrome theater. Eliasson states, "By putting this yellow filter on top of everything [the room] becomes like a picture. But since we are in the picture and in fact experiencing it... it becomes real again. By making it hyper-representational, we have a real experi ence^?so that you see something that you don't normally see. The eyes have bet ter vision when you have less color."22 For Klein as for Eliasson, "abstract" in the 107 art journal 22. Olafur Eliasson: Your only real thing is time, exh. cat.

The questions their analo gous five-part installations pose is "better vision" of what, and in what sense? The ambient world or the constituents of vision itself? Would vision itself be "perception," do we have access to such a precultural operation, and if we do, what do we do with this knowledge within an art context? If, as I am suggesting, we think of both works under the art-historical rubric of the monochrome?to which they clearly, if not exclusively, refer?we operate on the plane of culture's uses of color, perception, and Klein's sensibility, which is where these artists make their contributions.
