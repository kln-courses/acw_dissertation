<plain_text><page sequence="1">AT THE ORIGIN OF CANAANITE CULT AND RELIGION: THE EARLY BRONZE AGE FERTILITY RITUAL IN PALESTINE Pierre de Miroschedji Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, UMR 7041 (HAROC), Nanterre, France Introduction Early Bronze Age cult and religion remain largely shrouded in obscurity. In contrast to the preceding Late Chalcolithic period, which has attracted more attention because it has yielded a large number of art objects, and the subsequent Middle Bronze Age, when the Canaanite religion is considered to have taken shape, the cult and religion of the Early Bronze Age have generated relatively few studies, mainly because the data are scanty and their inter pretation hazardous.1 This is a field to be trodden with caution. Nevertheless, this field deserves careful exami nation because drastic changes took place with the advent of the Early Bronze Age at the end of the fourth millennium bce: it is the time when the first urbanization of the southern Levant took place, a transformation involving major societal and ideological changes. Actually, several cultic and religious manifestations witnessed in the second millennium can be traced back, albeit discretely, to the third millennium. This observation alone justi lies that the data of the Early Bronze Age, how ever obscure and polysemic, be subject to thorough scrutiny. After all, to learn about religious beliefs and cultic practices is no less important than to understand pottery typology, development of archi tectural plans or changes in dietary habits. The aim of the present paper is to review the evi dence for cult and religion during the Early Bronze Age in the hope of throwing additional light on this question. I will not examine the architectural remains regarded as belonging to temples because their interpretation is complex and because they do not provide specific information on cultic practices (for a recent, thorough, treatment of the cultic architecture of the Early Bronze Age, see Sala 2007). Instead, I will concentrate on the data derived from certain archaeological artifacts, first and foremost cylinder seal impressions. The latter have been extensively studied by Amnon Ben-Tor whose pioneering work has paved the way for all subsequent studies and interpretation of the Pal estinian glyptic of the Early Bronze Age. In this respect and several others, my intellectual, schol arly and personal debts to him are considerable, and the following pages are a modest token of gratitude and friendship. I. Cult Scenes on Early Bronze Age cylin der seal impressions In his pioneering study of the Palestinian glyptic of the Early Bronze Age, Ben-Tor distinguished a particular group of imprints which he considered as "cult scenes" (Ben-Tor 1978: 57-61, 79-83; see also Ben-Tor 1977, 1992). It is with their analysis that this inquiry will begin. All the impressions belonging to this group appear on "Metallic Ware" jars. The latter were generally dated to the EB III exclusively, but exca vations and research during the last two decades have shown that these "Metallic Ware" vessels date to the EB II and III (Greenberg and Porat 1996; Greenberg 2000). It is, however, probable that many of these impressions should be ascribed to the EB III since this is the date of the specimens found in stratigraphic context. It is difficult to estimate how many impressions 74*</page><page sequence="2">AT THE ORIGIN OF CANAANITE CULT AND RELIGION 75* with cult scenes are known at present, as quite a few may be yet unpublished. It can be safely estimated that about thirty impressions of this category are known presently (Ben-Tor 1978,1992). They show a strictly northern distribution, with the exception of a specimen from Bab edh-Dhra' located on the eastern shore of the Dead Sea (Miroschedji 1997: fig. 7; Lapp 1989,1994). As a group, these impressions display marked stylistic similarities, especially the absence of relief, a common feature of the Palestinian glyp tic of the Early Bronze Age. This is probably due to the use of wooden cylinder seals.2 Another common feature is that they are the only ones that depict human beings. According to subject, they can be subdivided into three sub-groups that illus trate various moments or aspects of what I interpret as a single cultic ceremony. They are discussed below in what is a plausible (but by no means a certain) order of events: the meeting of a man and a woman, i.e., the two protagonists of this ceremony; their marriage (hieros gamos); the festivities surrounding the ceremony. The Meeting The cylinder seal impressions illustrating what I understand as marking the beginning of the cer emony were initially grouped by Ben-Tor in his Category IIIB "Human Figures and Structure" and IIIC "Human Figures, Animals, and Structure" (Ben-Tor 1978: 11-12, 57-61, 79-87). They prob ably include more than a dozen specimens found at various sites in northern Palestine, northern Trans jordan and the Golan (Ben-Tor 1992). Although each of these impressions was made by a differ ent cylinder seal, as a group they show such close stylistic similarities that it is difficult to escape the conclusion that these seals were produced in a single workshop located somewhere in northern Palestine. Description of the Scene The impressions illustrated in Figs. 1 and 2 were published by A. Ben-Tor, who has restored the incomplete ones on the basis of the more complete examples from Jebel el-Am and Tel Qashish (Fig. 1:1-2) (Ben-Tor 1992). These impressions show two figures near a motif evoking a building. Their stylistic similarities are evident in the rendering of the human body. The figure on the left (or excep tionally on the right: Fig. 2:4) is probably mas culine as it is represented in the same way as the dancers on a group of impressions to be discussed below (Fig. 7) and on a fragmentary shrine model from Tel Yarmouth (Fig. 15): the head is round, oval or flattened, the body elongated, and the legs very short and stump-like. On some impressions, for example on those from Jebel el-Αϊη, Tel Qash ish and Beth Yerah (Figs. 1:1-2, 2:1), the arms widen at their extremities, as if the man is holding a twig of foliage in each hand. The figure facing him and toward whom he seems to be advancing is sitting on a stool (cf. Fig. 1:1-2) and raises its arms in a gesture of welcome. It is a priori difficult to determine whether this figure wears its hair in plaits, or whether it wears a headdress with two long horns of an ibex, in which case it would have the appearance either of an animal in human attitude, or of a human being disguised as an animal. Behind the seated figure is a rectangular and vertical motif, usually filled with three rows of small squares, displaying two protuberances on top of the lateral sides (Figs. 1:1-3,2:2,4); occasionally these two protuberances are lacking (Fig. 2:1) and the filling squares are oriented obliquely instead of vertically (Fig. 2:2). This motif is usually inter preted as the image, or evocation, of a building (Ben-Tor 1992,passim). Finally, in the field there may be a rather indis tinct motif, oval or rhomboid, which can be filled with a horizontal line (cf. Figs. 1:1, 2:1). This rather stereotyped scene has no precise parallel outside of Palestine. Therefore, it can be considered an original creation of Palestinian seal cutters. However, an impression on pottery from Ebla could illustrate a comparable scene (Fig. 4:1): it shows a man on the left facing what seems to be an animal standing on its hind legs, in an almost human attitude and, behind him, a motif reminis cent of a building (Mazzoni 1992: A21; see also A10 et A16 and the comments on p. 253).

Ben Tor understood it as illustrating an iconographic theme attested on Mesopotamian cylinder seals of the Uruk and Jemdet-Nasr periods, namely "the feeding of the sacred herd" (Ben-Tor 1992: 161 64). With several variants, these Mesopotamian cylinder seals represent a man feeding a herd of caprids. The man is commonly identified by his rolled headband and net skirt as the "king-priest," because he is shown on many cylinder seals per forming both secular and religious activities (see Amiet 1980: 76-77, 87-88, 203-204; Schmandt Besserat 1993; Wilhelm 2001). The herd of caprids is usually qualified as "sacred herd" because it is frequently shown on contemporary cylinder seals associated with symbols of the goddess Inana, the great goddess of Uruk (for example, Amiet 1980: 78-83, figs. 618-41). However, on some cylinder seals showing the same theme, the "king-priest" is replaced by a homed animal in human posture feeding the herd (Ben-Tor 1992: fig. 7 = Amiet 1980: fig. 641). Conversely, according to A. Ben Tor, the herd can be replaced by a human being disguised as an animal (Ben-Tor 1992: 162).3 In his opinion, it is the latter situation which is illus trated by the Palestinian cylinder seal impressions we are dealing with: the man would be feeding a human being disguised as an animal in front of a building. I would suggest a different interpretation for this scene. It is, I believe, a simplified illustration of a theme well known in Mesopotamian art, espe cially glyptic, of the fourth and third millennia bce, namely the "meeting" of the king-priest and the queen-priestess (see Amiet 1980: 92-95). This actually elaborates on a hypothesis first suggested in 1990 at the Second International Congress of Biblical Archaeology in Jerusalem (Miroschedji 1993a: 216) and which can be argued now on much more solid grounds. It is based on an examination of the various elements comprising this scene. First, the building shown, or evoked by its door, can be understood as the image, not of an ordinary building, but of a temple, as suggested by numer ous parallels in Mesopotamian and Syrian glyptic (Amiet 1980: 89-90,164-65). The emphasis on the door reflects a widespread convention in ancient art, the pars pro toto, by which only the most characteristic element of an ensemble is illustrated in order to evoke the complete structure (cf. Figs. 4:3, 5:4-5, 6:3). This convention was commonly applied in Mesopotamia (see Amiet 1980: figs. 634, 807, 819, 841, 1106, 1107, 1158, 1164, 1218, 1337, etc.). If this building indeed represents a temple, then it is most improbable that the horned figure shown in front of it should be identified as an animal in human posture. Since this figure is shown sitting on a stool, in close association with the temple, as if to stress that it is the owner, it should rather be viewed as a human or divine figure. Other rep resentations, including a cylinder seal impression (Fig. 6:1) and a figurine (Fig. 11:6) which will be discussed below, demonstrate beyond doubt that it is actually a female figure. The fact that the latter is sitting on a stool in front of a temple indicates that she is a goddess, or at least a woman playing the role of a goddess. Whether this female figure was deliberately given the appearance of an animal remains a moot point, for it is uncertain whether she is wearing plaits (see below) or a horned headdress. As for the male figure approaching the lady sit ting on the threshold of her house, it is doubtful that it is holding a twig of foliage in each hand, as suggested prima facie by some impressions (e.g. Fig. 1:1-2; 2:1). It is more likely that what looks like a twig of foliage is actually a stylized represen tation of the hands (on this treatment of the hands, see Tessier 1987: 45-46). This suggestion is borne in mind by an impression from Khirbet ez-Zeraqon to be discussed later (Fig. 6:1), which shows the same treatment of the hands for an individual per forming a sexual act, i.e., represented in a context incompatible with holding twigs of foliage or the feeding of a sacred flock. To sum up, it is suggested that the cylinder seal impressions under consideration (Figs. 1-2) illus trate the meeting of a male figure with a female figure (human or divine) seated in front of what is probably her temple. Thus it can be compared with an iconographic theme frequently represented in Mesopotamia and in Syria from the late fourth mil lennium onward. Amiet (1980: 92-95) dubbed this theme le theme de la rencontre ("the theme of the meeting") between the king-priest and a goddess</page><page sequence="6">AT THE ORIGIN OF CANAANITE CULT AND RELIGION 79* (or a woman playing the role of the goddess) stand ing or sitting on the threshold of her temple. One of the oldest and archetypical representa tions of this theme appears on the three registers of the famous Uruk vase of the Berlin Museum (Fig. 3). At the location of the break on the upper register was the figure of the king-priest, recog nizable because of his net skirt whose long train is carried by an acolyte. He heads a long proces sion of offering bearers which is deployed on the register underneath and is himself preceded by another offering bearer. He advances towards the goddess (Inana), who wears a headdress that is an archaic version of a horned tiara, and who stands at the gate of her domain, symbolized by two looped poles. This "meeting" has also been depicted on many contemporary or later cylinder seals, usually in a simplified way, showing face to face the king priest and the goddess, probably the queen or a Fig. 3. Decoration of the "Uruk vase'5 in alabaster, Vorderasiatische Museum, Berlin (after Lindemeyer and Martin 1993: pi. 25)</page><page sequence="7">80* PIERRE DE MIROSCHEDJI priestess playing the role of the divinity (Cf. Amiet 1980: pis. 45-48, 61, 100). On the most ancient cylinder seals, dating to the Late Uruk and Jemdet Nasr periods, the latter is shown standing at the gate of her house, wearing a homed crown from which one or two long plaits (?) flow out (Fig. 4:2). On the most recent cylinder seals illustrating this theme in the Early Dynastic II-III periods, the queen-priestess is sometimes seated (Fig. 4:3-5), for example on two specimens from the former Marcopoli collection (Figs. 4:5, 8:4 on the right). The resemblances between these scenes are sig nificant enough to justify the conclusion that the Palestinian impressions under discussion (Figs. 1-2), the above-mentioned imprint from Ebla (Fig. 4:1) and the Mesopotamian cylinder seals (Fig. 4:2-5) represent the same scene and allude to the same ceremony, namely the meeting of the king-priest and the queen-priestess, the latter impersonating the goddess and shown in front of the entrance of her house, i.e., at the door of her temple. The Sacred Marriage Several Mesopotamian cylinder seals suggest that the meeting of the king-priest and the queen priestess was a prelude to the two next steps of the ceremony: the banquet and the sacred marriage, described in several Mesopotamian texts.4 The sacred banquet has been illustrated on numerous Mesopotamian cylinder seals which show two figures seating facing one another, a Fig. 4.

They are represented drinking, presumably alco holic beverages5 inside a temple (Fig. 5:3), or with the temple simply evoked by the image of its door (Fig. 5:4-5). Some cylinder seals show that the banquet took place in the framework of festivities with the participation of musicians and dancers, and sometimes with ambulating or leaping animals (cf. Amiet 1980: fig. 1154, 1164 [= our Fig. 5:4],</page><page sequence="9">82* PIERRE DE MIROSCHEDJI 1332, 1342). While the banquet is not yet attested in the Palestinian glyptic of the Early Bronze Age, we will discuss below a figurine (Fig. 5:1) that may evoke this stage of the ritual. Other Mesopotamian illustrations of the ban quet indicate that it was accompanied by sexual intercourse between the two participants (cf. Fig. 6:2, and see Assante 2000: pis. I-IV, XXVI: 16 [LB Cyprus],19 [ED I Ur]). The culminating point of the entire ceremony, and its raison d'etre, was indeed the sacred marriage, through which the fer tility of the world was symbolically achieved. Mes opotamian cylinder seals indicate that the union was consummated inside the temple, amid rejoic ing which brought together musicians and dancers (Fig. 6:2^4). I suggested in 1990 that in Palestine the sacred marriage was also the focus of the cer emony represented on cylinder seal impressions (Miroschedji 1993a: 216). This hypothesis has been dramatically confirmed by the subsequent discov ery of several cylinder seal impressions at Khirbet ez-Zeraqon which belong to a second group of impressions, as yet unrecorded: like their Meso potamian counterparts, these impressions illustrate the actual marriage of the two protagonists of the fertility cult.6 One of these impressions (Fig. 6:1) was recently published by Schroer and Keel (2005: 304-05, no. 209). It shows a coitus a tergo (sexual intercourse between a man standing behind a woman leaning forward). This scene leaves no doubt about the identification of the two protagonists: the woman is indeed the "horned" figure that we saw stand ing in front of a building, interpreted as a cultic building, welcoming the man apparently carrying a twig of foliage in his hands (Figs. 1-2). It is there fore doubtful that she is a woman disguised as an animal. It is possible that the so-called "horns" are actually long plaits depicted side by side, in accor dance with a common representational convention, as seen in a female figurine from Yarmuth (Fig. 11:6). It is also noteworthy that the hands of both the man and the woman have spread fingers; they resemble those of the man shown on the group of impressions illustrating the meeting of the couple (Figs. 1:1-2, 2:1), who is interpreted as carrying a twig of foliage (see above). A lyre and a caprid shown around the copulating couple suggest that their intercourse takes place amid festivities. The lyre reminds us that the fes tivities include music and dancing (cf. Fig. 6:4, and see below). Caprids are frequently shown in association with these fertility rituals (e.g., Fig. 6:3), not, of course, as participants stricto sensu, but rather as symbols of the fecundity generated by the sacred marriage. The Festivities Surrounding the Ceremony The meeting of the king-priest and the queen priestess was indeed accompanied by festivities. In Mesopotamia, the fertility ritual of the sacred mar riage was, in the words of G. Komoroczy (quoted by Cooper 1993: 81): "(...) a popular festival, more or less like carnival." The festivities surrounding the ritual in Early Bronze Age Palestine are illus trated or evoked by a group of more than half a dozen cylinder seal impressions initially classified by Ben-Tor in his Category IIIB under the heading "Human figures and structure" (Ben-Tor 1978: 11, 58-61). They show a row of human figures holding each other by the hand (Fig. 7:1-3) or by the shoul der (Fig. 7:4). The shape of their heads and the treatment of their bodies exhibit marked stylistic similarities with the cylinder seal impressions of the previous two groups. In front of the row of human figures, each impression shows a struc ture resembling a sort of balustrade; on the most detailed examples (Fig. 7:1,4), the latter is made of superimposed lines of small squares or vertical rectangles. This motif evokes the faqade of a build ing, a priori a temple. This scene can therefore be understood as repre senting a group of figures near a temple in a dance comparable to the Palestinian debka (see the com ments by Epstein 1972: 214-16; Beck 1976: 123 24; Ben-Tor 1978: 79-82). Hence, it would appear to be an evocation of festivities taking place in the immediate vicinity of a sanctuary on the occa sion of a cultic ceremony centered on the sacred marriage.7 Scenes involving dancers are frequent in the ancient Near East from Neolithic times onward (Garfinkel 2003). In particular, they are well attested in third millennium Mesopotamia and</page><page sequence="10">AT THE ORIGIN OF CANAANITE CULT AND RELIGION 83* Fig. 6.

An imprint from Hama (Fig. 8:1)—found in Stratum J5, perhaps somewhat later than the Pal estinian EB III—shows a row of dancers raising their arms and holding each other by the hand, as on the Bab edh-Dhra' imprint (Fig. 7:4), with caprids leaping around them. Two other impres sions from Ur dating to the beginning of the Early Dynastic period also show dancers, some holding each other by the shoulder (Fig. 8:2), others danc ing separately around a building in the center of the scene (Fig. 8:3), possibly the temple in which the sacred marriage takes place. One could also make a comparison with cylinder seal impressions from northern Syria which show a row of dancers near (or on top of?) a building, presumably cultic (Amiet 1980: 167-169 and fig. 1351-54); the most elaborate example of this series is a cylinder seal of the former Marcopoli collection (Fig. 8:4), which Amiet (1963: 73, 78, 81; 1980: 167) has interpreted as an illustration of a ritual practiced in northern Mesopotamia and in northern Syria, but which, I believe, was more widely performed. The glyptic evidence suggest that it was also observed in Early Bronze Age Palestine, and we shall see below that these festivities were also evoked in other media, such as a shrine model (Fig. 15) and graffiti on a stone pavement in front of the EB IB temple of Megiddo Stratum XIX (Fig. 7:4-5). m ־w® n jG JJJl m m xAAAAAAAA/WWWVAAAA/WVW jmrnrnxm^m wmmm mrnm mmmm ilffl mmmmmmmrn { 1 Sz&amp;Q 0&amp; [fl G Q. S. if Comments The cylinder seal impressions with cult scenes belonging to the three sub-groups discussed above should not be considered as illustrating separate and disconnected scenes. They more probably illustrate successive stages in the development of a fertility ritual, i.e., first, the meeting of a man and a woman, presumably the king-priest and the queen-priestess impersonating a god and a goddess, at the door of the latter's temple; then the actual coupling of the two protagonists; and finally (or concurrently?) the festivities surrounding the ceremony, accompa nied by music and dance. This sequence of events is hinted at by several Mesopotamian and Syrian cylinder seals, by the decorated vase of Uruk and by other works of art such as Early Dynastic deco rated plaques. These works of art, however, illus trate only one stage of the entire ceremony whose development can be restored only on the basis of texts.8 To the best of my knowledge, only the vase discovered in a cultic building at Inandik in central Anatolia, dating to the Old Hittite period, ca. 1600 bce (Ozguq 1988), depicts the entire ceremony in detail (Fig. 9). It shows the procession of offering bearers, the meeting of the couple, the banquet they have together (bottom register), their marriage on a ceremonial bed (third register right), the sacri fice taking place at the same time (second regis ter right) and the festivities surrounding the entire Fig. 9. Decoration of an Old Hittite cultic vase from Inandik. No scale. (After Ozgug 1988)</page><page sequence="13">86* PIERRE DE MIROSCHEDJI ceremony, with musicians, dancers, acrobats (two upper registers), and even individual excesses lead ing to sexual intercourse among the bystanders (a coitus a tergo on the upper register right), evoking "sacred" prostitution.9 The numerous iconographic and written attesta tions of this ritual indicate that it played a central role in the cultic activities. In Mesopotamia, the earliest iconographic hints of the emergence of this ritual may go back to as early as the late fifth-early fourth millennium bce, when banquet scenes (?) and copulating couples are shown on seals of Tepe Gawra XI (Hole 2010: 234-36, fig. 15.7:g,l-n). Although Mesopotamia offers the most detailed textual and iconographic information about this ritual (see above), it does not follow that the sacred marriage was an exclusively Mesopotamian ritual (contra Cholidis 1992: 182-83), even if some details of the ceremony might have been specific to the Mesopotamian cultural sphere. Present textual and iconographic data actually suggest that a ritual centered on the sacred marriage was practiced in a presumably comparable way in Mesopotamia, in Syria (see Lipifiski 1986 for Ugaritic texts), in Cyprus (Assante 2000: pi. XXVI:16) and in Pal estine during the third and second millennium bce (for Palestinian Middle Bronze Age examples, see Keel and Uehlinger 2001: figs. 30-31, 41-43), and in Central Anatolia in the second millennium (Fig. 9), thus, possibly, in the greater part of the ancient Near East. It may thus be considered that its icon ographic representations were to a large extent cross-cultural and rather comparable. Therefore, the occurrence of comparable scenes in different areas and cultures at different times does not neces sarily imply that they all derive from a prototype, in this case a Mesopotamian one dating back to the late fourth or the early third millennium bce. This was most probably not the case with the Old Hittite vases from Inandik and Bitik, whose decoration can hardly have been inspired by Mesopotamian examples. It is also doubtful that the scenes rep resented on the Palestinian impressions discussed above imitate Syrian and/or Mesopotamian models and it can therefore be assumed that they represent a local elaboration. If all these scenes share simi larities, it is because they depict (or rather allude to) a similar festival whose main stages involved the same participants in similar contexts on the basis of simple and rather spontaneous religious beliefs in the annual renewal of fertility following the hieros gamos. II. Other artifacts with cultic significance The cylinder seal impressions discussed above allow a reasonably detailed description of the fer tility cult practiced in Early Bronze Age Palestine, but they are not the only items of significance to illustrate this cult. Excavations have revealed vari ous other contemporary objects and images which should now be examined. Considered separately, most of them do not readily lend themselves to a specific cultic interpretation But seen in the light of the interpretation proposed above for the cult scenes shown on glyptic, they take a new meaning and shed additional light on the nature of the dei ties and on the cultic practices in Palestine of the third millennium bce. Images and Symbols of Deities The Divine Couple In accordance with the order of description fol lowed above for the cylinder seal impressions, the divine couple should be considered first. In addi tion to glyptic, there is archaeological evidence, albeit indirect, for its existence. It consists of the discovery of twin temples, clearly intended for the worship of a divine couple. Following a sugges tion by I. Dunayevski and A. Kempinski (1973), the earliest example of a twin temple was long believed to be that of the EB IB temple of Megiddo Stratum XIX, but the latest excavations suggest that it actually corresponds to two superimposed single temples, now ascribed to Strata J-2 and J-3 respectively (Finkelstein and Ussishkin 2000: 38-50). However, clear evidence of twin sanctu aries is provided by other sites: for the EB II, by the twin temples (?) of Arad III-II (Amiran et al. 1978: 38^11; Sala 2007: 163-75) (Fig. 10:1), and for the EB III, by the cultic compound of Khir bet ez-Zeraqon where two cultic structures appear to face one another (Mittmann 1994: 12-13; Sala 2007: 240-48) (Fig. 10:2) and, most convincingly, by the twin temples of Megiddo Stratum XV/J-7 (Fig. 10:3) (Finkelstein and Ussishkin 2000: 68-71;</page><page sequence="14">AT THE ORIGIN OF CANAANITE CULT AND RELIGION 87* Fig. 10.

Megiddo Stratum XV, EB III (After Loud 1948: fig. 394 and Kempinski 1989: 34, fig. 14). Sala 2007: 236-40).10 Hence, the worshiping of a divine couple in the Early Bronze Age can be considered an established fact, reflected in the con temporary glyptic and confirmed by archaeological discoveries. The Goddess The goddess was clearly preeminent in the divine couple. Most of the temples identified by archae ology are single temples that were probably dedi cated to a goddess, as suggested by the nature of the cubic paraphernalia originating, for example, from the EB II temple of Ai (Amiran 1972a).11 However, relatively few images or even sym bols of this female deity are known. Some figu rines discovered in Early Bronze Age contexts may represent, or simply evoke, the deities worshipped during this period. Female figurines are admittedly difficult to identify as images of deities because they lack a divine symbolic identifier—a typical situation in early periods (for Mesopotamia, see Amiet 1980: 161-162, 1995: 494) and which has persisted for a long time in the Levant. Some figu rines, however, exhibit significant features and warrant consideration. First should be mentioned a remarkable figurine (14.5 cm. high) acquired in Jordan on the antiq uities market, but probably originating from Bab edh-Dhra' or a related site (Amiran 1989a) (Fig. 11:3). It represents a naked woman with short, stump-like legs, raised arms and, instead of a head, a two-handled jar. The type of jar, with a raised band of beads on the neck, is typical of the pottery found at Bab edh-Dhra' in tombs ascribed to the EB IA (a local terminology, corresponding with the Palestinian EB IB) (e.g. Schaub and Rast 1989: figs. 12:2, 18:2, 29:5, 57:3, etc.). It is likely that this figurine represents a fertility goddess linked to sweet water. First formulated by Amiran (1989a), this proposal is based on several examples of figu rines or small statuettes showing a woman whose head is replaced by a vessel. An early example, from a period immediately preceding EB I, is the Late Chalcolithic terracotta statuette of a goddess discovered at Gilat (Amiran 1989a, Commenge 2006, with earlier bibliography); on her head the goddess carries a churn, i.e., a type of vessel that may be associated with the production of butter, but which is also more commonly associated with water, since the goat skin, which presumably inspired the shape of the vessel, is an ordinary water container.12 Much later, examples of a female deity carry ing a container were found in the Iron II Edomite sanctuary of 'En Hatseva in the Negev (Cohen and Yisrael 1995a, 1995b). Although the goddesses carry a vessel on their heads, instead of having a head in the shape of a vessel, it may be assumed that the symbolism of this representation is compa rable. It is reminiscent of other statuettes where the female body is replaced by the image of a temple, as in the case of a ritual vessel originating from Syria (Oman 1986: fig. 42; Muller 2002: 411-13, fig. 224) and of several Iranian objects discovered on the Iranian Plateau dating to the second half of the third millennium bce (Miroschedji 1973: fig. 12 and pi. V:a-b). In these examples the body of the goddess or the house of the goddess are</page><page sequence="15">88* PIERRE DE MIROSCHEDJI Fig. 11.

Photograph in Miroschedji 1999: 14 interchangeable, while the head of the goddess or the roof of the temple is replaced by a vessel.13 In all these cases it seems likely, as Amiran (1989a) had suggested, that the divinity is associated with sweet water and, more generally, with the fertility that the sweet water insures. Another figurine could possibly be interpreted as an image of a female deity (Fig. 11:6). Discov ered at Yarmuth in an EB II context (but unfortu nately in a fill), it shows a faceless, naked woman, with very short stump-like legs, steatopygous but tocks, an elongated neck, the right arm folded on the belly and the left arm raised and reaching her ear (?). The treatment of the legs is reminiscent of that seen on some contemporary cylinder seal impressions (e.g. Fig. 2:3). A significant detail is seen on the back of the figurine: two slightly raised vertical bands represent two long plaits falling on her back while two rows of finger-nail impressions are intended to evoke the long hair. These details make it quite possible that this figurine actually represents the same woman as the one appearing on the cylinder seal impressions illustrating the meeting of the king-priest and the queen-priestess or their sexual encounter (Figs. 1:1-2, 2:1,4, 6:1): in both cases, she is wearing long plaits falling on her back, but these are shown side by side, i.e., in a manner that gives the false impression that they are horns rather than plaits. The significance of other figurines portraying a naked female is more difficult to grasp. I am a priori inclined to ascribe a more or less diffuse religious significance to most of them because I regard these images as neither toys nor artistic representations nor erotic images (See Schroer in Keel and Schroer 2005: 22-43, 96-98). Nonethe less, their precise religious significance eludes us, beyond the general conclusion that they may have been fertility symbols. Such was probably the case with female figurines with raised arms found in EB IA tombs at Bab edh-Dhra' (Schaub and Rast 1989: 274-89, figs. 155-66) (Fig. 11:4) and at Ma'ale Eilat (Holzer and Avner 2000) (Fig. 11:5), all reminiscent of the above-mentioned figurine from Bab edh-Dhra' with a head in the shape of a jar (Fig. 11:3). A fragmentary female figurine from Yarmuth (Miroschedji etal. 1988: pis. 46:1, XXI:1) and another from Beth Yerah—the latter showing a lady holding an infant in her arm (Schroer and Keel 2005: no. 107) —also belong to this undefined cat egory. If these images are indeed fertility symbols, they are in harmony with the fertility cult evoked by the cylinder seal impressions discussed above. In this context, two objects discovered at EB II Tel Arad should also be mentioned, although they do not show a female figure stricto sensu. The first is a graffito (Fig. 11:2) (Amiran and Ilan 1992: Abb 88; Schroer and Keel 2005: no. 113) representing a bird, apparently a dove, which is a common symbol of the female fertility goddess</page><page sequence="16">AT THE ORIGIN OF CANAANITE CULT AND RELIGION 89* until Late Antiquity.14 Its occurrence may therefore be significant. The second item is a bone head of a lioness (Fig. 11:1), another common symbol of the fertility goddess in historical times (Amiran et al. 1978: 57 and pi. 120: 9; Miroschedji 1993b: 31-32 [erroneously considered as a bull's head, but see p. 31, n. 3]). The Male Partner In contrast with these images of a female figure possibly worshipped as a fertility goddess, her male partner is remarkably discrete in the icono graphic record. Male figurines are generally rare in the Neolithic and the Chalcolithic periods15 and exceptional in the Early Bronze Age. In fact, no figurine with an explicit male character is known for the southern Levant in the Early Bronze Age (see the catalogue by Schroer and Keel 2005). There are (presumably) male EB III figurines of a donkey rider from Khirbet ez-Zeraqon (Schroer and Keel 2005: no. 98) or of a worshipper from Yarmuth (Fig. 12), but none can be reasonably clas sified as representing a deity, or an individual play ing the role of a deity. Fig. 12. Figurine of an offering bearer from Tel Yarmouth (Drawing previously unpublished. Photograph in Miros chedji 1999: 14) However, in the same way that the graffito from Arad showing a dove may be significant because the dove is usually associated with a fertility god dess, several graffiti scratched on the pavement in front of the EB IB temple at Megiddo may be also meaningful since they include a ram (Fig. 13:1) and a bull (Fig. 13:2) (Loud 1948: pis. 275-79. See also Kempinski 1989: fig. 46 and Yekutieli 2008: fig. 9). These animals were apparently associated with the male partner of the fertility goddess. In the late Chalcolithic period, the nature and/or context of discovery of several rhytons or statuettes in the shape of a ram carrying containers16 suggest that the ram was then perceived as an animal attribute of a male deity, while the latter's more prominent female counterpart was symbolized by animals such as an ibex, and occasionally evoked by a snake and/or a bird (Miroschedji 1993a: 213-15). In the Early Bronze Age, this symbolic imagery may have persisted occasionally, as suggested by an EB 1 "cultic" bowl in basalt decorated with an ibex (Amiran 1989c)17 and by the above-mentioned graffito of a ram at Megiddo (Fig. 13:1). On the whole, however, it seems to have been replaced by images of lions and doves for the female deity, and images of bulls for her male partner. While bull figurines and images are exceptional in the Late Chalcolithic period (although cattle breeding was then widespread),18 they appear frequently in the Early Bronze Age as evidenced by the dis covery of several kernoi (see below), of a jar with an image in relief (Sussman 1980), and of several bull's heads in bone, ivory or stone (Fig. 13:3-4). Originally affixed on a staff or on a piece of furni ture, examples of the latter object are found in EB II (in bone) and in EB III (in ivory and stone) and present specific technical and stylistic details that suggest they were produced in a few workshops (Miroschedji 1993b). From the Middle Bronze Age onward the bull was commonly associated with a male deity, El or Baal (Green 2003: 207; Mazar 1982: 30-32). Images of Temples The So-Called Model of an "Arad House" Ever since its discovery and subsequent publica tion by the late Ruth Amiran, the architectural "model" of Arad (Fig. 14) has been considered as the image of an "Arad House", i.e., a type of EB II dwelling especially well represented at Tel Arad where it is characterized by a broadroom, a periph eral inner bench and a slightly sunken floor level.19 However, there are at least two reasons for which this conclusion cannot be sustained. Since the architectural details that character ize the "Arad house" (the peripheral inner bench and the sunken floor level) are necessarily absent from the architectural model, its only common feature with the "Arad house" is the plan of the</page><page sequence="17">Fig. 13.

The shrine model from Tel Arad (Amiran et al. 1978: pis. 66,115) dwelling, i.e., a broadroom. This plan, however, is not specific to the "Arad House"; it is a typi cal and common feature of all EB I-II temples, and of most of the EB III temples.20 Therefore, the architectural "model" of Arad could represent a domestic dwelling as well as a temple; the first option is not compelling and the second appears more likely in view of another observation. For, this object presents a peculiarity that has seldom been noticed: its door frame is represented in a special way, with a double frame, the first (outer) one showing two lateral extensions above the door lintel.21 It is noteworthy that the door of the temple on the cylinder seal impressions illustrating the meeting of the king-priest and the queen-priestess is depicted in exactly the same way (Figs. 1:1-3, 2:2,4).22 This similarity suggests that the architectural model from Arad represents a temple, and that it may have originally housed a figurine of a deity.23 It would be the earliest example of a shrine model, a type of cultic object that would continue to be produced far into the future (on shrine models, see Miroschedji 2001a: 66-78; Muller 2002; Katz 2005). At any rate, no house model stricto sensu, i.e. a model of a domestic dwelling, is known in the southern Levant, neither in the Early Bronze Age nor in later periods, and as such, the architectural model from Arad would be unique. On the other hand, at least one other shrine model is known from the Early Bronze Age, which implies that the Arad specimen was not unique in this period. The Fragmentary Shrine Model from Yarmuth This other shrine model was discovered at Tel Yar muth in an EB 111 context (Fig. 15) (Miroschedji 1982, 2001a: 67-70, 2011; Miroschedji et al. 1988: 84 and pi. XX). Although fragmentary, it is more elaborate than the one from Tel Arad. It had the shape of a building, possibly a broadroom, whose fagade was decorated in relief, presumably on both sides of the door. A complete reconstruction of this object appears in Fig. 15 (For another restoration, see Muller 2002: 365-66, fig. 159:d). The only surviving part of the building is the left corner of the fa9ade and the left door-jamb. The door has a raised threshold and a curved lintel. The left side of the facade is decorated with a human, apparently male, figure with raised arms; the head is missing but its outline is still visible with a rounded shape reminiscent of the male figures shown on contem porary cylinder seals (Figs. 1:1-2, 2:1-2,4, 7:1-3). At its feet, one can distinguish the hind legs of a leaping caprid. Above the human figure is an indis tinct triangular motif and three small protuberances recalling the extremity of wooden beams. This decoration represents in relief the scene illustrated on the above-mentioned cylinder seal impressions (Figs. 7-8); it is an evocation, on the fapade of the shrine-model, of the festivities bringing together musicians, dancers and caprids and taking place around the actual sanctuary on the occasion of a festival like the one marking the celebration of the sacred marriage (cf. Figs. 6-8). Conclusion These two remarkable shrine models from Tel Arad and Tel Yarmuth are so far the earliest examples of a category of cultic objects that have a long, abundant and varied posterity. The shrine-model from Yarmuth is a direct antecedent to the one from Gezer, which also has a fagade decorated in relief</page><page sequence="19">92* PIERRE DE MIROSCHEDJI :flllr w* WMm, m₪tk Fig. 15. The fragmentary shrine model from Tel Yarmuth (adapted from Miroschedji et al. 1988: pi. XX) (Miroschedji 1982: fig. 2; 2001a: fig. 17; Muller 2002: 342-43, fig. 145). It is also a distant fore runner of the Late Bronze and Iron Age examples; these were sometimes decorated on both sides of the door with images of a fertility goddess (Ash erah, Anat, or the like) and exhibited various sym bols (lions, doves, snakes, palm trees) usually associated with this deity (Miroschedji 2001a: figs. 18-22; Muller 2002; Katz 2005). The significance of these shrine-models has long been debated and there is probably no single explanation to account for them. On the one hand, the majority undoubtedly represent the temple of a fertility goddess and some, if not all of them, may have originally contained a figurine of the goddess. On the other hand, 1 have suggested (Miroschedji 2001a: 78, and especially 2011) that they may be compared to the kubba of pre-Islamic Arabs (see</page><page sequence="20">AT THE ORIGIN OF CANAANITE CULT AND RELIGION 93* de Vaux 1982: 125-26; Denzer 1990)—which housed a female deity and was movable since it was carried on the battlefield—and to the qubbah mentioned in Num. 25,1-8—which housed pros titutes close to major sanctuaries where religious festivals took place. Whatever the merit of this latter hypothesis, it brings us back to the concept of sexual intercourse practiced in the framework of fertility cults. Several other objects or decorations discovered in Early Bronze Age contexts support this proposal. Evocations of the sacred marriage ceremony An Evocation of the Banquet? In the fertility ritual culminating in the sacred mar riage, the banquet played an essential role. Actu ally, the Mesopotamian cylinder seals suggest that banquet and sexual intercourse were closely con nected (cf. Fig. 6:2,4). No cylinder seal impression showing a banquet is known in Palestine, unlike Mesopotamia where these scenes are frequently illustrated (see above). However, one Palestinian object possibly dealing with the same subject can be mentioned. It is a figurine discovered at Khir bet ez-Zeraqon and exhibited at the Irbid Museum (Fig. 5:1) (Mittmann 1994: 14; Schroer and Keel 2005: no. 224). It represents, on a four legged socle, a human figure standing in front of a table apparently laden with food(?). This standing figure wears a headdress with a pair of long "horns" or plaits; thus it is likely the same female figure as the one represented on the impressions of Figs. 1-2 and 6:1 and the figurine from Yarmuth (Fig. 11:6). This female figure, however, was not stand ing alone in front of the table: one can distinguish on the left the remains of another broken figurine, now missing. Thus, there were two standing fig ures around the table, one female, the other pre sumably male. It is admittedly possible that this object represents a scene of offering made to the goddess, as is the case on a cylinder of the Allard Pierson Museum (Fig. 5:2) and on the vase from Inandik (Fig. 9: second register left). But it is also possible that we are dealing here with a three dimensional representation of a banquet scene bringing together the king-priest and the queen priestess. An Evocation of the Sacred Marriage? In this connection the so-called stela from Tel Arad should also be mentioned (Fig. 16:1) (Amiran 1972b). It is a roughly hewn limestone block on which two human figures have been lightly incised in a very schematic way, both with raised arms and long spread fingers, one larger figure standing and a smaller one supine, the latter apparently within a rectangular frame. Because the two human figures are represented in a similar way, Ruth Amiran sug gested that they depict the same individual—the standing one alive and the supine one dead—which she identified with the god Dumuzi, a deity alter nately dead and revived according to the yearly cycle of vegetation. In Sumer, during the New Year festival, Dumuzi was impersonated by the king and performed the sacred marriage with Inana person ified by the high priestess in order to insure the annual revival of vegetation (Kramer 1983; Renger and Cooper 1975; Cooper 1993; Steinkeller 1999). Elsewhere, the vegetation deity had a name other than Dumuzi but essentially filled the same role and function. Although some aspects of Amiran's ingenious interpretation of this schematic scene are questionable, it may, on the whole, point in the right direction. Schroer and Keel (2005: 304, no. 208) suggest that the stela represents an "erotic scene" and call attention to the fact that "the figure in the back ground seems to lie on a bed." This proposition is far more convincing than Amiran's because it explains why the supine figure is represented within a frame. Furthermore, it is in harmony with the above interpretation of various scenes on cyl inder seal impressions illustrating the successive stages of a fertility ritual culminating in sexual intercourse between the two partners. Hence, it is possible that the graffito of Tel Arad illustrates the actual union of a man and a woman impersonating divinities of fertility and that it alludes to the sacred marriage ceremony. Bed Models The bed models attested during the Early Bronze Age can be understood in light of the same hypothesis, though their interpretation admit tedly involves greater uncertainty (Fig. 16:2-3). Over twenty such objects have been found to date</page><page sequence="21">94* PIERRE DE MIROSCHEDJI Fig. 16. An EB II stela from Tel Arad (1) and EB II—III bed models (2-3) 1. Amiran 1972b. 2. Gezer EB II (Schroer and Keel 2005: no. 210). 3. Tel Yarmuth EB III (previously unpublished) to EB II and (mostly) EB III contexts; none has yet been reported in earlier or later contexts (see Beck 1993, Schroer and Keel 2005: 306, no. 210, both with earlier bibliography). In terracotta or in limestone, rectangular or sometimes square, they have been found mainly in domestic contexts, and only exceptionally in a cultic one (Sanctuary A at Ai). Similar objects are well known elsewhere in the ancient Near East, especially in Mesopotamia during the second half of the third and the first quarter of the second millennium bce (Cholidis</page><page sequence="22">AT THE ORIGIN OF CANAANITE CULT AND RELIGION 95" 1992:123-183). During the Isin-Larsa period, these objects were frequent and many had explicit depic tions: some were decorated with a pubic triangle or with the image of naked woman, or even with that of a couple engaged in sexual intercourse (Cho lidis 1992: Tf. 21-42; Assante 2000: pis. X-XI, XXII-XXIII). The bed models have been connected with so called "sacred prostitution" or considered as images of "birth-stools" related to the worship of a "birth goddess" (Beck 1993: 37-39). The latter hypoth esis has been rightly rejected by Schroer and Keel (2005: 306, no. 210) who link the image of the bed with sex life and procreation. This straightforward symbolic meaning of the bed of course explains its prominent appearance in iconographic repre sentations of the hieros gamos. Cholidis (1992: 173-180) has linked the bed models specifically with the ritual of the sacred marriage related to the cult of Inana/Ishtar, which explains why these objects were especially numerous in Uruk, the city of the goddess. Since in Early Bronze Age Palestine these objects were mostly found in domestic contexts, there is a priori no reason to think that they were a direct allusion to the cultic rite of the sacred marriage. On the other hand, it is reasonable to assume that they had a symbolic meaning related to the concept of human fertility in general, and were therefore evocative of human activity permit ting this fertility, i.e., sexual life, and consequently of the divine activity enhancing this fertility, i.e., sexual intercourse between the two divine part ners during the ritual of the sacred marriage. In other words, the bed models can be considered as propitiatory objects destined to attract by homol ogy the benevolent power of a fertility deity to enhance the fecundity of the family. Their discov ery in Early Bronze Age contexts in the southern Levant is therefore consistent with the fertility ritual illustrated on the contemporary cylinder seal impressions. Although the bed models from Palestine have usually been considered as deriving from Mesopo tamian prototypes (references in Beck 1993: 34), Beck (ibid.) has rightly observed that they appear earlier in the southern Levant than in Mesopota mia and that their occurrence is not synchronous in both areas. This observation suggests that the appearance of the bed models in Palestine is not the result of an imitation of foreign prototypes; their spread is rather the consequence of the develop ment over vast areas of comparable fertility rituals. Image of Cultic Festivities We have seen above that the festivities surrounding the ritual of the sacred marriage involved musi cians and dancers. It is therefore significant that on the stone pavement of the courtyard in front of the EB IB temple of Megiddo Stratum XIX, there are graffiti which may allude to such festivi ties taking place in this very courtyard.24 At least one represents a dancer in connection with a lyre (Fig. 7:5). It is reminiscent of the musicians whose participation in the festivities is shown on the vase from Inandik (Fig. 9), or evoked on Palestinian and Syro-Mesopotamian cylinder seals by a lyre repre sented without musician (Fig. 6:1,4). Cultic Vessels Some cultic vessels can be immediately identified as such because their shape or decoration preclude their daily use in domestic contexts. But it is a priori impossible to distinguish between cultic vessels destined for a public cult addressed to a divinity common to the entire community, and cultic vessels intended for a private or commu nal cult offered to the ancestors of a family or a clan. Presumably, both share similarities in shape and perhaps also in decoration. The cultic vessels discovered in temples (e.g. in the Ai sanctuary) belong most probably to the first group, while those unearthed in tombs almost certainly belong to the second group. Cultic vessels appear in the Late Chalcolithic in funerary contexts (e.g. in the communal tomb of Peqi'in: see Gal, Smithline, and Shalem 1997) and are also well attested during the EB I in tombs, which have yielded stone vessels, high footed gob lets and kernoi (Amiran 1986; Greenberg 2001). For the EB II (?) and especially the EB III, cultic vessels were discovered in both domestic and cultic contexts. A fragmentary rhyton from Beth Yerah in the shape of a lion's head (Fig. 17:1) could possibly be associated with a fertility goddess. A fragmen tary platter from the same site is decorated with</page><page sequence="23">96* PIERRE DE MIROSCHEDJI pair(s) of bulls' heads (Fig. 17:2), while a fragment from a vessel (?) from Yarmuth also shows part of a bull's head (Fig. 17:3); both items could perhaps be associated with the male partner of the main female deity. Among the so-called cult stands, two major types are represented in the Early Bronze Age: the cult stands stricto sensu, whose fenestrated square bodies could evoke a building which, by comparison with later examples, may be viewed as symbolizing the temple (Fig. 17:4); and the offer ing stands, whose body has the same appearance and presumably the same symbolic meaning (Fig. 17:5). It is most significant that these two catego ries of cult stands already appear in the EB III, for they are the distant, but direct, forerunners of the Middle Bronze, Late Bronze and Iron Age examples that are usually considered typical of Canaanite cults (see Miroschedji 2001a: 47-66). This continuity also implies a certain measure of continuity in cultic practices. III. Conclusion The Palestinian cylinder seal impressions deco rated with cultic scenes and the related artifacts discussed above illustrate, directly or indirectly, a fertility ritual which, up to now, was documented only for Mesopotamia in the fourth and third mil lennium bce, and for central Anatolia in the second millennium bce. They suggest that this ritual was also practiced, in a very comparable way, in periph eral regions like Palestine during the late fourth and the third millennium bce. They evoke a ceremony that periodically assembled the community for the joyful accomplishment of a ritual centered on the sacred marriage of a divine couple personified by the king-priest and the queen-priestess. As a matter of fact, the emergence of such a ritual in Palestine at that time should come as no great surprise since it was in harmony with the social and economic development of this country in the Early Bronze Age. The preceding Late Chalcolithic period wit nessed the emergence of the first temples built according to a pre-determined plan, which were the direct forerunners of the Early Bronze Age temples (Miroschedji 1993a: 208-11; Sala 2007: 1-30). Indirect evidence suggests that these Late Chalcolithic temples and their third millennium successors were dedicated to a fertility goddess associated with the subterranean realm, from where the sweet water flows and where the dead are buried. The Early Bronze Age fertility goddess was a direct successor to this Chalcolithic deity, although her chthonian/mortuary aspect seems much less pronounced. She was in turn the proto type of the great fertility goddess who, in histori cal times in Canaan, was named Asherah, Anat or Astarte. In the Late Chalcolithic period this goddess was apparently the main deity, since her male partner can hardly be identified. A major change occurred in the Early Bronze Age with the discrete appear ance of a male deity alongside the female deity ven erated as a fertility goddess from time immemorial. In the Early Bronze Age this male god appears as a partner of the great goddess essentially in the framework of the fertility ritual of the sacred mar riage. Whether this male partner was a vegetation god comparable to Dumuzi, Dagan and the like is a moot point for which we lack evidence. If the images of bulls, which appear then with increasing frequency, should indeed be associated with this male deity, then he may have been a prototype of El or Baal. However, it is only during the second millennium that the male partner of the great god dess will attain a preeminent role. He will then, depending on the region, be called Hadad, Horon, Dagon or, allusively, Baal. The slow emergence of this male deity, and especially its role in the fertility ritual of the sacred marriage, should probably be understood as an expression in the religious sphere of the political development taking place in the EB II-III period, when city-states took shape and centralized politi cal powers emerged for the first time in the his tory of Palestine. Since socio-political evolution, religious developments and ritual transformation go hand in hand, the sacred marriage ritual was more likely to take shape and to correspond to a social and political need in an urbanized society, such as the one developing in Palestine with the transition from EB I to EB II. Hence, from a his torical and sociological point of view, the emer gence of a divine couple can be interpreted as a</page><page sequence="24">•V ץ / J^vv\S\SaKWSS5SS&lt;^ 11/ \ll I I -י CM. Fig. 17.

The cylinder seal impressions decorated with cultic scenes and the related artifacts analyzed in this paper bear witness to this crucial development. Notes Most of these studies were by Ruth Amiran: see Amiran 1970, 1972a, 1972b, 1980, 1981, 1986, 1989a, 1989b, 1989c. For other studies pursuing the same goal, see Ben-Tor 1977, 1978, 1992; Miroschedji 1993a, 1997, 2001a. The actual cylinder seals discovered up to now are made of stone, bone or terracotta and bear exclusively geo metric motifs: see Miroschedji 1997:192-193. Note, however, that the two cylinder seals from Tell Asmar and Khafadje illustrated by Ben-Tor (1992) in his figs. 9 and 10 actually do not represent "a human figure dressed as a homed animal" but a divinity wearing an archaic type of homed tiara (cf. for example Amiet 1980: fig. 1368) and dressed with a kaunakes. Hence, these two examples actually do not support Ben-Tor's view. For the iconography, see Amiet 1980: 95-98, 1995: 491-492. For the texts, see Kramer 1983, Renger and Cooper 1975, Cooper 1993, Steinkeller 1999. Cf. Joffe 1998; McGovem 2003; Jennings et al. 2005. On wine drinking during the New Year sacred marriage ritual in Ugarit, see Lipinski 1986: 212. My gratitude to S. Mittmann, the excavator of Khirbet ez-Zeraqon, for sending drawings of these as yet unpub fished impressions. See also Miroschedji 1997: 204. An impression from Tel Dan should be mentioned in this context because its composition is similar while its subject is different: in the foreground it shows a set of intersecting fines evoking a building and in the back ground a row of animals instead of a row of dancers (Greenberg 1992: 49, fig. 2). This scene is reminiscent of Mesopotamian and Syrian cylinder seal impressions which also show the juxtaposition of a herd of animals, usually caprids, and a building, a priori a temple (e.g., Amiet 1980: figs. 623, 625, 627-631, etc.). These ani mals are usually understood as representing "a sacred herd." This interpretation is questionable because the symbolic connotation of these images is bome in mind by the fact that these animals are shown being fed by the so-called "king-priest" (e.g., Amiet 1980: figs. 636-641), or represented leaping in the course of the meeting (Fig. 4:5), the banquet (cf. Amiet 1980: figs. 1154,1164 [= our Fig. 5:4], 1332, 1342) or the sacred marriage between the king-priest and the queen-priestess (Fig. 6:3). Since the meeting, the banquet and the sacred marriage are episodes of the same fertility cult, the representation of these herds of animals should rather be understood as symbolizing the animal kingdom whose fecundity is ensured by the union of the sacred couple. See esp. Renger 1975, Cooper 1993, Steinkeller 1999 and Assante 2000. Earlier bibliography is provided by Renger 1975 and Ozgiip 1988: 102, n. 110. Fragments of other contemporary vases bearing similar scenes were found at Bitik: see Ozgiif 1988. Some frag ments represent a wedding, with the groom unveiling the bride (a typical Oriental gesture), as on the vase from Inandik. They have been interpreted by Bittel (1976: 142-145, figs. 139-144) as illustrations of the sacred marriage. This has been questioned by Cholidis (1992:176-177) ά propos the vase from Inandik, on the grounds that the protagonists have no divine attributes and that the ritual of the sacred marriage is otherwise unattested in Anatolia. However, the main protagonists shown on the vase from Inandik are clearly no simple mortals since they are the focus of what appears to be a cultic ceremony; and the fact that they are depicted without divine attributes is no indication to the con trary, as this practice was not uncommon in Anatolia, the Levant and early Mesopotamia (for the latter, see Amiet 1980: 161-162,1995: 494). At Megiddo Stratum XV/J-7, the twin temples 5192+5269 were built after the single temple 4040, as shown by Dunayevsky and Kempinski (1973:162-167) and by Miroschedji (2001b: 483-485); hence we are not dealing here with three temples, but with one temple (presumably dedicated to a goddess) and then with twin temples (probably dedicated to a divine couple). It is uncertain whether a bowl decorated with an applied decoration of a snake from the cultic precinct of Khirbet ez-Zeraqon should be considered as a cultic object: see Genz 2002: 35, and comments by Sala 2007: 246-247. For a contemporary figurine from En־Gedi of a ram car rying two goat-skins, see Amiran 1989a: fig. 2. See also the goat-skin shaped alabaster vessel from the EB II temple at Ai: ibid., fig. 3. In this connection, it could be noted that in Mesopota mia the throne of the deities is sometimes represented like the fa9ade of a temple: see, e.g., Fig. 4:3-5 and the remarks by Miroschedji 1973: 35. See, for example, Van Loon 1990; Ziffer 1998; Pinnock 2000; Keel and Uehlinger 1998; Keel and Schroer 2005; Schroer and Keel 2005.</page><page sequence="26">AT THE ORIGIN OF CANAANITE CULT AND RELIGION 99* For Yarmukian examples, see Garfinkel 2004:188-189; for unique Chalcolithic statuettes, see Perrot 1978: fig. 60 and Milevski 2002: figs. 8-9. Note also the excep tional occurrence of male faces on ossuaries from Peqi'in: Gal, Smithline, and Shalem 1999: figs. 1, 3-4. Commenge 2006: 746-750 (pottery rhyton in the shape of a ram carrying cornets from Gilat); Amiran 1989a: fig. 2 (pottery rhyton in the shape of a ram carrying goat-skin containers from En-Gedi); Dollfus and Kafafi 1995: fig. 4:6 (pottery rhyton in the shape of a ram car rying containers, perhaps goat-skins, from Tell Abu Hamid); Epstein 1985: fig. 2a (basalt figure of a ram with a bowl on its back from Tell Turmus). In this connection, it should also be noted that if we admit that the queen-priestess shown on the cylinder seal impressions Figs. 1-2 indeed wears a horned head dress instead of two plaits, then these horns are those of an ibex—an observation which would be consistent with the suggestion made above. The only possible exception known to me is a statuette in basalt from Transjordan seemingly in the shape of a bull carrying a bowl on its back: see Ibrahim and Mitt mann 1998. Amiran et al. 1978: 52-53, pis. 66, 115; Muller 2002: 327-329 (no. 131) and fig. 131, with earlier bibliography. On the "Arad House", see Ilan 2001: 319-328. 20 See Miroschedji 1993a: 208-211; Sala 2007; add now the temple of Khirbet el-Batrawy: Nigro 2008: 276-293. The EB III exceptions to this plan are the temples (erroneously called "megara") of Megiddo XV and Khirbet ez-Zeraqon, whose layout derive from Syrian prototypes such as the temples of al-Rawda (Castel 2008: 8-12) and of Tell Khuera (Orthmann 1990). 21 To the best of my knowledge, only Epstein (1989: 24) noticed this detail, which she thought was inspired by Mesopotamian temples—although it is not attested in Mesopotamia (see below, n. 21). 22 The significance of these lateral extensions is uncertain. On a cylinder seal from Ur (Fig. 4:3) they are shown on one side of the door only, both at the top and at the bottom, and it is clear that they correspond to the hinge of the door. This is clearly not the case of the Palestinian cylinder seal impressions, unless it is supposed that they represent a double door. 23 This possibility was considered by Amiran et al. 1978: 53 and by Epstein 1989: 24. 24 Loud 1948: pis. 271-282; Kempinski 1989: fig. 46. For an up-to-date bibliography of these graffiti, see Yekutieli 2008 (whose interpretation appears rather unconvincing).
