<plain_text><page sequence="1">Padre Padrone and the Dialectics of Sound Mark Graham "Everything, in Padre Padrone the Taviani brothers have declared, "is linked to sound. "1 Not only is their treatment of sound (including speech, effects, and music) remarkable and emphatic throughout this film, but it is also a principal means of connecting the narrative with their thematic and ideological concerns. These, in turn, involve various ideas of connection and/or separation, and are them- selves dynamically interrelated, largely through the use of sound. We are first struck by the film's soundtrack in the early classroom sequence. Efisio, the padre padrone of the title, comes to take his son Gavino out of school in order to have him tend the family's sheep. Just before leaving, he threatens the schoolboys by saying, "Today it's Gavino 's turn. Tomorrow it will be your turn." Then, during a series of sustained closeups of four of the boys, who are clearly upset and dumbfounded, we unexpectedly hear them expressing in voice-over their fears that Efisio's threat may indeed be well-founded and that what has just happened to Gavino may shortly happen to them, too. From the outset, then, sound is employed to link Gavino's situation to that of other individuals and to emphasize their shared social, economic, and cultural circumstances. As this episode first suggests, Padre Padrone is not concerned merely with the amazing and altogether exceptional Odyssey of Gavino Ledda from illiterate Sardinian shepherd to professor of linguistics and author of the autobiographical book upon which this film is based. 2 It is also a politically oriented portrait of society and of the individual's relations with other individuals, with his family, with language, with nature, and with himself. While the Tavianis have stated that "life is made of particular cases, and the film deals with the particular case of Gavino Ledda, "3 they have also said that one of the film's themes involves "recounting the story of an isolated indi- vidual to prove that such a story does not exist, but that an indivi- dual's story can only be understood in relation to his social milieu."^ 21</page><page sequence="2">In stressing this intimate relationship, the film shows that the individ- ual is necessarily representative of his environment and that, there- fore, his particular situation, that of his specific social milieu and, by a further extension, that of society in general, are all mutually illustra- tive. The film makes numerous connections between the individual and society. We learn, for example, that the harshness of Gavino's existence is not unique but shared by other young shepherds. An- tonio, the boy with whom Gavino enjoys a few moments of intimacy, is similarly punished by his father for this forbidden act. In a later sequence, in which sound is again a primary factor, Gavino and two other young shepherds communicate-through accordian, flute, and weeping-the miseries of their forlorn lot. Gavino is also likened to the olive merchant's ragged, brutalized, and brutish servants, whom the merchant maliciously invites Gavino to join. And Gavino is clearly no better off than the other young shepherd-servants with whom he shoulders the patron saint's effigy in the procession se- quence. This sequence extends the frame of reference beyond Sardinia. By focusing on the phenomenon of emigration, it implicitly encom- passes the entire South, where economic hardships have made this phenomenon widespread. And when one young man remarks that even in Germany (and also, implicitly, in Turin or Milan), "You'll still end up under a padrone , " the Tavianis extend their notion of exploitation to include not only agricultural but also industrialized segments of Italian society, thereby providing a case for criticism of the whole nation's waste of human resources. Likewise, when com- municating in Latin from their separate tanks, Gavino tells his army friend, Cesare, "I am a shepherd and farmer, and therefore the servant of serfs," and Cesare replies, "I am educated but without work, and therefore the servant of serfs," the disenfranchisement of Italy's unlettered agricultural workers is linked to that of its numerous unemployed young university graduates. An important means the Tavianis employ of inscribing the individual situation within the collective one is through the use of communal or choral sound. During the last shot of the classroom sequence, for example, which shows the terrified speechless students sitting with their arms outstretched on their desks, we hear their asynchronous voices raised in an incomprehensible uproar, expressing their rebellious, outraged reaction to what has just happened. This sound continues into the following scene between Gavino and his mother, in which we see that Gavino shares their reaction. The next such instance occurs when Efisio, after beating his son senseless, cradles him in his arms. Efisio's lips then move as though producing the clearly superimposed sound of a mournful archaic Sardinian chant (the same one, in fact, as in the procession scene). This individual voice suddenly swells into a chorus, so that, as Ermanno Comuzio observes, The voice of individual sorrow becomes the voice of a collective sorrow, the voice of the people of the region, of everyone there, in order to link the actions of 22</page><page sequence="3">Gavino's father to the environment of which it is an expression. 5 The Tavianis themselves have stated that in the sequence involving "the panting of a collective copulation, "6 they wanted to show Gavino experiencing "a situation that was not his alone, but shared by others."? Finally, the voice-over sound of malicious whispering that we hear when Gavino returns to Sardinia to attend the university conveys the community's traditional resistance and hostility towards any break with custom, any attempt to escape the long-established confines of an oppressive way of life. Thus, when Efisio appears in this sequence, his similar response to his son's decision should be taken as an expression of prevalent cultural attitudes. The film's music helps bring out the representative character of particular events by placing them within a broader cultural context. The Strauss waltz that Gavino first hears while lying in his pit both evokes a continental culture the very antithesis of Gavino's own in- sular one, and also precipitates and expresses Gavino's joyous awak- ening to, and defiant eagerness for, that hitherto unsuspected culture. As Comuzio maintains, the commercialized popular song that we hear as the family harvests its olives expresses their drive to reap the fruits (as it were) of Western materialism. 8 In the procession scene, the juxtaposition of the German drinking song and the traditional Sardinian chant conveys the opposition between the younger and older generations and between the freer, more congenial culture the young men hope to enjoy by emigrating to the North and the harsh patriarchal oppression in the South they seek to escape. Shortly after the classroom sequence, the soundtrack draws our attention in the scene in which Gavino's father first takes him to the area where he will become a shepherd. A sequence of tracking shots advances along a road stretching far in the distance. Meanwhile, though there is no living creature in sight, we hear the sound of hooves and the voice of Efisio, describing some of the better points of a shepherd's life. In effect, this startling use of a subjective camera together with voice-over speech reveals Gavino's apprehension and sensibility -his visual and emotional point of view (he is presumably seeing this landscape for the first time and just after hearing his mother's frightening description of its desolation) as well as what might be termed his point of hearing (Efisio 's words are directed towards him). And so this sequence both discloses a landscape and posits an individual's response to that landscape. In fact, much of the film expresses Gavino's perspective, offering a dual emphasis on what he perceives and how he perceives it. Immediately following this scene, the primacy of Gavino's sensibility is again stressed in the beautiful initiation sequence in which Gavino's father teaches him to recognize the characteristic natural sounds of the region. Gavino's perception of these sounds-the rustling of the oak tree, the rushing of the stream, the pastoral sounds of dawn-changes their respective sources into magical images. The sounds of the Strauss waltz and of the death bell are similarly trans- 23</page><page sequence="4">muted into sounds of alchemy that awaken in the listening Gavino mute awe, joy, and fear. The bell and the gramophone are for Gavino, not just objects that produce gay or somber sounds but are gaiety and somberness personified. His brutalized intellect cannot yet distin- guish, at the shepherd stage, between reality and imagination. And, even later, when he is in the army, both when he is sitting high up on the tower of Pisa and when he is trying to study in the barracks latrine, his sense of isolation, his mental absorption in his own con- cerns, and his consequent inattention to his surroundings persist, causing the ambient sounds and voices to become intermittently silent. On the other hand, the early classroom sequence, in which we hear the voice-over thoughts of the schoolboys, presents the inner point of view of people other than Gavino. There are similar instances of voice-over being employed to give a sort of group relay of subjec- tivity. Admittedly, the episode, already mentioned, in which Gavino and two other young shepherds communicate through music and weeeping does not, strictly speaking, involve voice-over, but rather "title-over," since the boys' feelings, transmitted by sound, are translated into words through subtitles instead of speech. But this scene does initiate a sequence in which, after the shot of the weeping boy, first we see Efisio, who is listening to the boys' music, and hear him express in voice-over his concern that Gavino is growing away from him; then, when Efisio leaves the frame, we see Sebastiano, who, again in voice-over, expresses his well-grounded fears regarding the supposed reconciliation of the vendetta. Later, after Sebastiano has been murdered and is being laid out in his funeral clothing, we hear a series of voice-over speeches in which the members of Gavino 's family, including Gavino, each reflect on what they intend to do with their share of the proceeds from the olive grove. Such examples of voice-over might be accounted for by noting that, though Gavino might be absent when they occur (as in the classroom sequence), and even though he could not really penetrate to the inner workings of other consciousnesses, still this film is ostensibly his story, about his past; therefore, these instances could represent retrospective reconstructions and narratorial omniscience on the part of the real Gavino Ledda who appears at the beginning and end of the film. But these uses of voice-over are too emphatic, I feel, for such an interpretation to be valid. Rather than having Gavino's subjective point of view incorpo- rate authorially that of everyone else, the film incorporates his per- spective within a collective protrait of a world, presenting a kind of objective (because unconfined to any single sensibility) subjectivity. And so the film's use of the voice-over technique has a connective function, in effect, reinforcing Gavino 's representativeness and his participation in an inclusive communal framework. Other aural techniques besides voice-over serve to convey the organic fusion of inner and outer reality and to make manifest what would normally be merely latent and imperceptible-a function for which sound is eminently suited, since, like the wind that blows 24</page><page sequence="5">thoroughout the film, sound is at once immaterial and real. One such technique involves the unnatural emphasis of certain sounds: for instance, those made by the hooves, the tree, the stream, the milk splashing in Gavino's pail, the wind. What this tends to do is animate these sounds (as well as their visualized sources, in the case of the tree, stream, etc.), thereby conveying the inner vitality, the expressive voice, as it were, of these natural phenomena. The combined in- stances of such animation inevitably create a sense of an all-pervasive natural animism which only partly represents Gavino 's heightened perception of and response to them. Or, to refer to a somewhat different, though related, technique, even the seemingly unmotivated and artificial sound of the death bell that Gavino hears is the manifes- tation both of his subjective response to the isolating silence of his natural surroundings and, objectively, of the silence itself. That is, this knell is, in some sense, really "there" in the surroundings and situation (after all, Gavino 's father also hears this bell, and his mother refers to it by saying that, in the hills "Silence is never just silence. It is a powerful thing"). A somewhat special instance of sound linking inner and outer reality occurs when Gavino and the sheep that spitefully craps in the milk pail tell one another off in voice-over. Now this use of voice-over suggests not so much an anthropomorphic fantasy on Gavino's part as a shared reality, a vital correspondence between the animistic natural order on the one hand and the human/societal on the other. This intimate relationsip is further implied by Gavino's mistreating this sheep just as he himself is mistreated; by Sebastiano 's being slaugh- tered along with and in the same way as his enemy's lambs; and, of course, by the panting sequence, involving what Tom Lehrer once euphemistically referred to as "animal husbandry." All the connections that sound helps to make-between indi- vidual and society, inner and outer reality, the natural and human orders-together express the organic interrelation of phenomena in a world (and world view) governed entirely by the dialectic process. This is at once a natural, individual, and socio-political process and a ratiocinative one, the latter deriving its validity and structure from the others, of which it is a "natural" reflection, and which, in turn, it seeks to explain and direct. Clearly, for the Tavianis the dialectic political perspective is not an autonomous, artificial, merely intellec- tual construct to be overlaid on material phenomena. Rather, it is implicit in the fabric of things. In their view, politics is nothing less than "the awareness of the real , and action to modify it. "9 Gavino's struggle for self-definition is presented in terms of this comprehensive dialectic process. And since the process involves the close correspondence of the natural and individual/societal dimen- sions, Gavino's struggle can be considered naturally representative rather than merely symbolically analogous. Such an organic link is also emphasized through one of the Tavianis' thematic concerns, which is to show the relationship between what they call the "biolog- ical" (natural/human) development of the individual (that is, Gavino's adolescent drive towards liberation) and the historical development of society-a Marxian version of the theory that ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny.10 25</page><page sequence="6">Sound plays a key role in the depiction of Gavino's "revolu- tion,'' defined by the Tavianis as "the passage from one mode of life to another, superior one."H First, it helps relate his personal history to a larger framework. Second, it reflects the shifting relationships, the complex alignment of forces--in short, their varying mutual connections and separations-inherent in the dialectic process, under- stood as the contradiction of related opposites and their continual resolution in a new synthesis. And third, sound becomes both the means through which Gavino overcomes his isolation and maKes some sort of meaningful connection with the rest of humanity and also the means through which the directors convey Gavino 's initial separation from his fellow man. Gavino progresses from being a passive receiver to an active transmitter of sounds. In the first part of Padre Padrone , Gavino is engaged in a dual elemental struggle against his father and nature. He is surrounded by primitive, desolate sounds that, in effect, connect him to nature while separating him from any human contact and from any chance for self-expression. In so doing, these sounds duplicate the intentions and effects of the oppressive "education" that Gavino receives at the hands (literally) of his father. The connection between natural and paternal conditioning is stressed when Efisio instructs his son in the rudiments of his own aural code, involving the recognition of natural sounds in order to safeguard the inviolability--and isolating confinement-of the family's sheepfold. Having become nearly mute over the years, Gavino only begins to overcome his isolation when he communicates through his accordian playing. He thereafter becomes increasingly able to produce and manipulate his own sounds (he constructs a radio that plays the Strauss waltz; he communicates with Cesare from their respective tanks via microphone; he turns up the volume on the radio playing the Mozart clarinet concerto); and, with Cesare's aid, he gradually masters the linguistic code. This process is demonstrated in the sequence in which a verbal montage, consisting of Gavino's voice-over recitation of several series of words, is accompanied by a visual montage of associated images from his past life. Interestingly, the first verbal series is inspired by the officer's discussion of the significance of the flag--/¿z bandiera- and each of these words begins with "b", the same letter the students were learn- ing in the classroom sequence, when they were reciting the mnemonic ditty "B-a ba, b-e be, b-i bi...," and so on. Thus Gavino resumes his education (his socialization, in fact) where it was originally forcibly curtailed : at the beginning both of literacy and the alphabet. It is also interesting that in the first two series the words are linked only phonetically, by their initial letter ...barocco, basilico, barone ...": "... stalagmite, starnuto, statuto ..."): the words in the third and fourth series are linked either phonetically or semantically (" ...arcadico, pastorale, pastorizia, pastorizzazione, deportazione, separazione ..."); whereas in the final series, which begins after we see an image of Efisio, the linking is both and at once phonetic and semantic, at least etymologically ("Padre! patriarca, padrino, padrone, padreterno, patrono ..."). This progression of verbal series shows that Gavino, rather than passively learning the linguistic code, dialectically rede- fines it, adapting it to his own experience and needs. And the final 26</page><page sequence="7">series shows him achieving a personally significant fusion of linguistic sound and meaning. Structurally and thematically, this sequence is the counterpart of the earlier initiation sequence. In both, sounds evoke images of their visual referents. And in both cases, this results in a complex interplay between inner and outer reality. Moreover, just as in the initiation sequence, when Efisio teaches his son his aural code, Gavi- no, unable at first to perceive it, says "I don't hear anything" ("Non sento niente"), so later, when Gavino, having mastered the linguistic code, uses it to tell his father off, Efisio, feigning not to understand him (or perhaps really not understanding), cups his hand to his ear and says "I don't hear" ("Non sento"). This transfer of roles is one indication of the dialectic turning of the tables (another occurs when Efisio purposely cuts his lip, as Gavino earlier had twice done to himself). In the second half of the film Gavino amply makes up for his muteness in the first half. Language enables him not only to commu- nicate with others but also to understand his own situation and his place in a communal situation. Thus, when the real Gavino Ledda appears at the end of the film, he can say that the story we have just seen and which he relates in his book "is not mine alone. Some shepherds from this region say it is not I but they who have created this book with their li ves.... Because of this, I believe in the writer's craft." But he also suggests that, though he had returned to Sardinia to write his book, he is not altogether comfortable there ("I often want to escape from this place"). One thing that keeps him in Sardin- ia is "the fear that far from my lair, from my people, from my smells, I would again be mute...." Another is that "On the continent... I would use my new power as a privilege, just as my father used his. And this would be his final victory." This comment amounts to an admission that he has not yet overcome his conflict with his father because his actions are still defined by it. Gavino does gain a valid perspective on his situation through language. And because words are abstract, detachable from their significance and from the things they signify, language offers Gavino a perfect means for making contact with his reality while partly distanc- ing himself from it (even his study of Sardinian dialects serves this dual end, as is implied when Gavino defuses his father's Sardinian curse by asking him to repeat it). Such a tension between connection and separation, which characterizes Gavino throughout the film, is , of course, basic to the dialectic process. However, the conclusion shows that Gavino has not yet resolved this tension satisfactorily. Clearly, language in itself is inadequate, either to effect Gavino 's liberation or that of the oppressed classes. As the film implies, however, the awareness and the possibility for communication that language can confer are vital insofar as they can lead to the individual and collective action necessary to transform society. So, although the final shot shows the adult Gavino again rocking himself in the isolated Ledda sheepfold, with that desolating wind still blowing, the film nonethe- less leads us to feel that an authentic resolution may yet await both Gavino and all the other Gavinos in the world. 27</page><page sequence="8">The dialectic tension between separation and connection is expressed whenever the soundtrack, itself composed of several "lan- guages," calls attention to its detachment from the visual track, with which it is nonetheless thematically connected. The way the two tracks are related actually precipitates this tension. "For us," the directors have declared, "the sound is opposed to the image... and from the relation between the two the spark should arise that will set off the explosion. "12 While the visual track concerns itself with what is essential to the narrative, the soundtrack, by contrasting with or even contradicting the images, performs a synthetic thematic func- tion. Rather than merely an intellectual or artistic overlay, the film's treatment of sound is meant to be understood as being somehow organically implicit or latent in the inclusive dialectic framework of the world portrayed. One could even say that, in its interaction with the images, the soundtrack brings out what, in a film so intensely concerned with the nature of language, might aptly be called the linguistic "deep structure" of any given situation. The sequences involving the initiation; the communication through accordion, flute and weeping; the procession; the mastering of the linguistic code; the group relays of subjectivity-these are only some of the most promi- nent instances in which sound functions analogously to linguistic transformations in that it generates out of the underlying deep struc- ture a complex but coherent message, consisting of multiple, super- imposed, and complementary levels of expression and description (in linguistics: the semantic, syntactic, lexical, phonetic levels, etc.). Padre Padrone suggests a musical model as well as a linguistic one. 13 Not only in the use of music itself but of all sound, and also in the rhythm of images and of narrative events, the entire film seems orchestrated as though it were a dynamically integrated musical composition. The film's music fittingly plays an important structural role in this orchestration. For example, as Marco De Poli, the assis- tant director of Padre Padrone , has pointed out, "Every salient episode of the film has... its own specific musical theme; [and] it is precisely the recurrence of the same theme in various forms that underlines the connection between different moments and situa- tions. "14 All types of sound, musical and otherwise, contribute towards this orchestration, and they do so in two basic, often over- lapping, ways- horizontally and vertically. The first involves the use of sound to provide thematic bridges between separate sequences, images, places, times, and events. Examples are numerous and vari- ous: the voice-over sound of the students' uproar that continues, augmented, into the following scene; the sound of communal panting that unites the images in the copulation sequence; Gavino's voice-over verbal series which both provoke and unify the associated images; the Mozart concerto that we hear (when Efisio is returning home after saying he will kill Gavino) even before we discover, in the next se- quence, the real source of this music, Gavino's radio; and so forth. For examples of a vertical use of sound I could cite the same se- quences as in my discussion of sound in terms of deep structure. In a musical context, these instances operate polyphonically in the com- plex contrapuntal interplay between verbal and aural elements. In any case, as is true of the soundtrack in general, the orchestral use of 23</page><page sequence="9">sound reflects the vital interrelation of forces in a world that is determined, in all its aspects, by dialectic conflict. As the Tavianis have affirmed, in Padre Padrone , "the sound- track very often contradicts the image, with the result that the 'natu- ralistic' identification with what is happening on the screen is immedi- ately discouraged. "15 This Brechtian distantiation,as they refer to it, 16 is plainly meant to create a reflective critical stance in the audience, causing them to "complete" the film's communication dialectically, to realize it on their own and for themselves. It is also manifestly the directors' aim that the political awareness thereby gained should lead the public to take corrective political action. When the Tavianis state that "the sound is the protagonist" of their film, 17 they are referring not so much to the obvious promi- nence of their soundtrack as to its function as perhaps the primary connective force in this work. It is largely through sound that the individual is linked to the group and in such a way that the dual themes of communication and community are shown to be not merely associated but inseparable. And it is largely through the dialectic tension between sound and image that the film communi- cates its message to us, inviting us to recognize our own place in the social struggle, our own representativeness and, hopefully, our own capacity to effect meaningful change. For the Tavianis, clearly, the only real protagonist is the collectivity rather than the individual per se. Sound, in Padre Padrone , expresses the voice of that collectivity, of its struggle for liberation, its underlying solidarity, and even its promise of communion.
