<plain_text><page sequence="1">"DAZZLE GRADUALLY" The Poetry of Gerald Barrax by Michael McFee 1. Whos I'm Nobody! Who are you? Are you-Nobody-Too? Then there's a pair of us? Don't tell! they'd advertise-you know! How dreary-to be-Somebody! How public-like a Frog- To tell one's name-the livelong June- To an admiring Bog! This famous Emily Dickinson poem might well be spoken by poet Gerald Barrax, especially the second stanza. Whereas other poets (in the small and obscure bog that is poetry, in the larger ecosystem of contemporary literature) seem eager "to be- Somebody," to be as public as possible, croaking their names and poems to admirers, Barrax is quite the opposite. He has published his quietly excellent poems in four quietly excellent books over the past quarter of a century; and even though his last book was nominated for both the Pulitzer Prize and National Book Award, his name is rarely listed among the best contemporary poets, African-American or Southern or American or otherwise. Though I'm sure he'd like to be recognized for many years of fine writing, I'm also pretty sure he's forsaken pursuing (or being pursued by) such fame because it would involve a "livelong June" away from his home, his family, his work, the locus and focus of his world. And I suspect that he's happy to be (or seem) "Nobody" if it means that his words can reach a fellow mortal trying, like him, to answer the simplest but most difficult question, "Who are you?" So who is Gerald Barrax? He is an African American. (Though, as he notes in one poem, his skin is "an indifferent tan / Of African, Indian, and Dutch ancestry.") He is a Southerner, born in Attalla, Alabama, in 1933, where he lived until he was 10, and a resident of Raleigh, NC, from 1969 to 1997. (From age 10 to age 35, he lived mostly in Pittsburgh with his families, which renders him not particularly "Southern" Callaloo 20.2 (1997) 327-340</page><page sequence="2">CALLALOO at all; and he has recently retired to the Philadelphia area with his wife, a college administrator.) He is a husband and father, with three sons from his first marriage and two daughters from his second current one. He is a veteran, with four years in the Air Force as a radio mechanic (1953-1957). He is several times a college graduate, with a BA from Duquesne (1963) and an MA from Pitt (1967) and many hours toward a PhD he doesn't need. He is a teacher, an emeritus Professor of English at North Carolina State University, where he began as an Instructor in 1969 and where he was Poet-in-Residence for many years. (Though he has extensive non-academic work experience, which he once listed as "steel mill laborer, cab driver, mail carrier and postal clerk, substitute teacher in Pittsburgh Public Schools, encyclopedia salesman (sold: 0, none, zip), awning hang- er.") He is an editor, of Obsidian II: Black Literature in Review, as he has been since 1986. He is a writer, having published articles and reviews and poems in many maga- zines, and having published four full-length collections of poetry: Another Kind of Rain (University of Pittsburgh Press, 1970), An Audience of One (University of Georgia Press, 1980), The Deaths of Animals and Lesser Gods (Callaloo Poetry Series, 1984), and Leaning Against the Sun (University of Arkansas, 1992). -No: that's WHAT he is. WHO is he, really? That's exactly what his poetry is about: who he is. From his first book to his most recent, Barrax has been wrestling with the nature of his identity-who he is, why he is the way he is, what he should do about it, and how he should live in the world. His struggle is always an individual one, never sterotypically "male" or "African-Amer- ican" or "academic," whatever those labels (which could all be applied to him) may mean: each poem is a quietly radical encounter with whatever is, on its own terms. And yet that struggle is a representative and not a private one: he is addressing "the things that make us men," in the old-fashioned sense of that latter word, our collective human identity. What matters (or should matter) most to us mortals? Who are WE? Again, that is a simple question with a very complex answer. All I want to do, in this overview of Barrax's work, is explore some of the recurrent concerns in his poetry, as a way of beginning to figure out who he is, and (maybe) who we may be. 2. "Blackness" "To Gerald Barrax," says the back of his first book, "the central realities of life are Blackness and death." That emphasis may reflect the time of Another Kind of Rain's publication (1970), or the "central realities" of the young poet's life, but they are issues that he has addressed ever since. Barrax's approach to race is less rhetorical and explicitly political than understated, ironic, and precise. His early poem "For a Black 328</page><page sequence="3">C A L L A L OO Poet" rebukes one of the practitioners of a noisy revolutionary poetics, deaf to "a beauty you can not see / a sound you cannot hear / below the exploding level of your poems": "you Brother bring back up only upper cases / undigested at that / while beaten far below the level of your voice / your life's deepest meanings lie fallow." Like that poet, Barrax may write about Malcolm X or Martin Luther King, Jr., but he brings his own less INSISTENT though no less powerful voice and craft to the subject. In writing about the Ku Klux Klan in "Uniforms," for example, a birthday poem for King, Barrax says, For still, in places with familiar names hooded men shame their faith as Christian Knights of burning crosses, enhance with sheets the color of the faces that we often would die not to see, for just one day. The compression of those last two lines is remarkable: the white sheets "enhance" (what a delicate fashion term!) the white color of the Klansmen's faces that African Americans "often" (not "always") would die (a lethally ironic verb, in context) not to see, "for just one day"-as, it may be implied, white people can go without seeing black faces for a day. This is material that has been thoroughly "digested," to reverse Barrax's derogatory phrase above: it has been carefully thought-out and crafted, but is still quite potent without uppercasing its voice or offering us what he calls, elsewhere, "the comfort / of overstatement." This is not to say that Barrax can't (or doesn't) ever raise his voice. "In This Sign" is a bitter and vivid poem about Christianity and African Americans, how "the Word / reduce[d] / many pagans to the faith of Jesus": "Now this is the only true miracle ever witnessed: / Black people also worship and love this God, / Who has let them drown in their blood, / And his." And "Whose Children Are These?" insists, "We have not rescued [the children] altogether; / we moved them through one dimension, from one killing / field to another on history's flat page, / 1850s' slavery to 1980s' racism and murder." But look where Barrax goes with this incipient racial rage, in the subsequent concluding lines of the poem: Baraka has told us "They have made this star unsafe, and this age, primitive," and it is so. I have stood over each child sleeping and looked at each child and wanted to know who decides to break our hearts one by one by one. The Greeks named it Tyche and made a goddess of chance. Here they call it this god's mysterious Will. I have the children, but we have not saved them from this primitive star, and I am unable to forgive. Again, this is no simplistic ending. Rather than leaving the poem on the undeniably inequitable social level of slavery and racism and murder and our "primitive" age, 329</page><page sequence="4">CALLALOO Barrax pushes it further, personalizing and then universalizing the situation. He regards his sleeping children, then wants to know who decides to break their, and his, and our hearts, "one by one by one." Is it mere chance? Is it God's will? Can anything save them, or him, or us from such pain? The implied answer is "No," and so he is "unable to forgive"-again, an honest rather than an easy "undigested" superficial response. In matters of race, as in other matters, Barrax is as honest and direct as possible, even when that may cast him in a less-than-favorable light. He always asks the big questions behind the little or obvious ones, as in this wonderfully palpable, passion- ate, and witty poem about the heritage and resourcefulness and strength of African- American culture: BODY FOOD Oh my Brothers you who need it it is your right to turn to what you believe is the true God or any other but what do you think kept your great &amp; grand papas &amp; mamas alive long &amp; strong enough to give you the strength to make the choice?: to take a faith with roots which their spirit yearned back for while their blood hallowed the cradles out of which your flesh came into this wilderness? You their children know better than the masters who were ignorant of the strength it took to begin with to survive; what little they had was given grudgingly without the suspicion of what those strong men &amp; strong women could make of leavings. If then it is in the blood of some of us to lust after the ears the tails the snouts the feet the maws &amp; even the chitlins of the filthy beast forgive us: with these &amp; the greens cornbread &amp; molasses that transsubstantiated back into the bones 330</page><page sequence="5">CALLALOO brain &amp; flesh of the black household gods who brought us through the evil rooted in this land, we honor them in the heritage of their strength. Here, and elsewhere, Barrax tries to "Tell all the Truth but tell it slant," in Emily Dickinson's words. The effect of this poem on soul food, and of his work as a whole, is cumulative, a process of questioning and answering, an incremental revelation of strong details: "The Truth must dazzle gradually," as he and Dickinson know, "or every man be blind." 3. Love While "Blackness" may be a central reality in Gerald Barrax's poetry, "Body Food" suggests another: the body in its many parts, its appetites and lusts, its durable and ultimately holy beauty. One of the most attractive qualities of his work is its intelligent sensuality, its celebration of the physical, its interest in (indeed, obsession with) love and lovers and loving. "I have willingly drowned a little / in bodies of water &amp; women," he says in "Nude with Seaweed," "And I know that if she were the sea / she would be choked with suicides." His sexual poems, while frankly erotic, are not about conquests: they are about connections, about how a man and woman can make each other "whole again." And yet, they are also about how those connections can fail, if not at the time at least in the remembering. "This," he says in "Second Dance Poem"-following that one initial word with a rich 42-line parenthetical passage about "woman's animalness," a Song of Solomon-like appreciation of "the gesture of her knees" and other body parts, including "the triangle / that begins &amp; ends my / doom"-"ruins / me." Other poems about old lovers, while brimming with ripe lines, seem haunted by the distance between then and now, and by the price some of those affairs exacted. And even the lyrical "Adagio," one of Barrax's most gorgeous love poems, is shot through with darkness and loss and mortality, its slow verbal ecstasy interrupted by sentence fragments and stanzaic diminishment and convoluted negatives. ADAGIO That morning you found your lights on, battery dead, came back to the apartment, walked in wet and blinking rain at me, and we went back to the narrow bed where always I hear the short Ah! when I enter you. Twenty years, I'll never see you again. Barber's Adagio came six years later. 331</page><page sequence="6">CALLALOO It's what we wanted for those three months, for the days I'm going to live with, like the strings sinking, and sinking: each time you come back I think it will be the last time and I won't know it, like the last breath I don't remember taking. Despite any shortcomings, physical love is clearly one of life's glories to Barrax, and it showcases one of his greatest gifts as a poet: making the intimate cosmic and the cosmic intimate. Like John Donne, Barrax can make the lovers' bed much more than just that, as in "Universe": "But here, / here by chance and necessity / we can trust the wisdom of our bodies / if nothing else, as old as the first explosion, / as alike as to our common ancestor, / the first cell struck by lightning or radiation / from which all life here evolved." From the very personal to the universal; from this moment back to the first moment; from "here" to the remotest there-Barrax is always expanding the volume of the lyric poem, its depth and width and height, reaching back to ancestors and out to the widespread world and up toward God, interweaving incident, memory, history, imagination, desire, the whole mortal shebang, all of this starting with something simple as a hand on skin, stroking. 4. God Gerald Barrax is a serious religious poet. Don't misunderstand me. I don't mean that he is conventionally religious, writing poems that praise God or justify His ways to man. Barrax is neither believer nor atheist: instead, he is what used to be called a "seeker," one who is searching for God, or for a god or gods or mythology, that can give some larger meaning to his existence here, can make him "humanly whole." Throughout his poems, he is always looking for a valid image of the divine, one true not just to itself but also to human nature and experience. "What mythology can ever do us / Justice?" he asks in "Geminis." "I need a ritual to perform," he says in "Domestic Tranquility," "a formula to recite / free of mumbo jumbo and cant," a "myth to give my daughters ... / free of cruelty and lies." He does not find that myth in traditional Christianity. God the father seems inept, absent-minded, careless, even cruel; Jesus seems, well, a joke, as in the very funny "Portraits," where his picture is scotchtaped to a locker below a nude centerfold, "a longhaired man with the saddest / blue eyes, too much a gentleman to look up." The Deaths of Animals and Lesser Gods explores what the first poem calls "The Conception of Goddeath," the possibility that this Christian image of God was never right in the first place, and is not right now, and is-in fact-extinct. The first poem in Leaning Against the Sun laments the inadequacy of language to capture experience, especially its religious dimension, dismissing the verbal "boxes" we "put visions into / ... eagle tiger whale god" as "inert and seamless, / no desire to break in, not letting anything out." Other poems, written from the divine point of view, dismiss religious denom- 332</page><page sequence="7">CALLAL OO- inations and faiths as "amateurish" little theater productions: "The rivalry between them was killing-each / company with its prescribed repertory of roles, / masks, rituals-none of it adding / to his stature. It was all so wearying." God-if He or She or It exists-is much greater and more "deadly" and "dangerous" than our petty representations allow. And yet-in the truthful complication and tension characteristic of Barrax's poet- ry-he can't completely dismiss the power of traditional images of God or faith. "Nothing on earth can make me believe them," he says at the beginning of a poem about "Spirituals, Gospels": "I cringe before the weary forgiving / of that lord whose blood drowned our gods." "Yet," he concludes, "my own blood weakens, freezes / at their sound, the 'unearthly harmonies' / alone probing the faith in my doubt, / making me fear the joy that for the duration of the music / crushes resistance utterly, utterly." The echo of Tennyson here ("There lives more faith in honest doubt, / Believe me, than in half the creeds") is entirely appropriate: Barrax's doubt is genuine, not cynical, and he does not mock honest faith in others, in these singers or in his wife when-during a difficult birth-she "bargains" for her daughter "with the god she might as easily have cursed." Neither does he challenge his young daughters' charming images of a God who "can press a button on a machine / And make you grow, even when you're sleeping" ("God's Button") or who "was visible / when he created the world, / but that made him tired, / so he died, / and went to heaven, / then he became invisible" ("Theology"). But in the end, even in the face of various faith-challenging or -inducing disasters, Barrax declines to pray or praise in any traditional manner. His search for God remains unsettled, and he is left with uncer- tainty, chance, the modern god of entropy: Bewilderment follows through all fire, head-ons, hurricane, structural collapse with the "Why" after the prayer of thanks or rage against our choice of deities for the someone who didn't survive. Except for ego or some genetic or learned need to believe in the design of sparrows falling we might answer with the uncertainty of human events, stumbling around the nucleus of death like electrons in unpredictable orbits of probable place, speed, energy; like this leaf falling from autumn today before another. Why your race, color, nationality? Why born? in 1933 and not? when? When decay or catastrophe collapses all events into the waiting center, the single human stake is high enough 333</page><page sequence="8">CALLALOO to flush minds and hearts free of doubt, offering the final choice to pray or curse-if the last ironic flash shows that chance has played god with the universe. ("More and Less") "Poems will bring us to resurrection," he wrote early in his career: "write to bring back the dead." 5. Music Q: What bright sweet thread stitches together Gerald Barrax's poems about being an African American, about love, and about God? A: Music. "Other than writing," he once said, "music is the true passion of my life. I would be unfulfilled and unhappy if I couldn't write, but without music I couldn't live. I like everything except polkas and waltz music: popular music, blues, country, jazz, classical, opera." Barrax's poems resound with all of these kinds of music: he quotes them, echoes them, even (in a remarkable passage in "Haunted House") eats them. "At the piano or stereo I cram / Eighth notes into my mouth with both / Hands, delight in the bite of their comet / Tails; sprinkle black pepper Thirty- / Seconds on my grits, crunchy crouton / Sixteenths on salads, make perfect Martinis / With black olive Quarter notes; / The powerful head-clearing Half note mints / Like the day of creation, prepare me / For the Whole, the cosmic egg, / The singular state of Nommo . . . " If music be the food of love, indeed! Some poets may name-drop songs or compositions or composers in an effort to impart musicality to their own lines, but not Barrax: for him music is a means to, a sign of, something greater than the patterned notes. "I've mastered the cello," he says in the virtuosic "Cello Poem," "for this: to fester / With music, with praise I've found no One to give." What an edgy image, to "fester" with music and praise, like a blister about to burst! And then he pushes it immediately from the very physical to the spiritual: music is part of his ongoing search for God, his quest for the "One" he has yet to find, Who can receive Barrax's gift of song. In fact, as he says in another poem, music is the essence of the divine in the human: his flutist friend, in recital, both heard and played the music he made in us, and moved us in our private spheres to make us more like him, and the gods whose ruins we are- whose music is the purest thing left in us. It still haunts us sometimes from the woods and still defies imitation: but because he hears it and tries for us, he helps make us the best we'll ever be. 334</page><page sequence="9">CALLAL OO- Music is the residue of the gods in us, "whose ruins we are." If not the means to immortality, it is at least a way to stall mortality: "We have played time to a standstill in our room," he says during an amorous interlude in "Cello Poem." Music is a way of knowing without words, a shared emotional language. "I would feel better / if she sang," he writes: "I understand song and could enter / Uninvited into its world." As he says in the last words of his most recent book, "Any music at all is better than none." 6. Nature Q. What other deep sustained note grounds Gerald Barrax's songs about being African-American, about love, about God, and about music? A. Nature, the natural world, its flora and fauna, that intricate text we are all part of, which Barrax the poet tries to read and understand. "What does it mean / that there is a snake lying among the wild strawberries?" he asks in "Gift." "What does it matter where the snake hides: / I was out of place until a blue jay / in return for my seed / left that black banded feather from his wing / in my back yard." It matters, in part, because nature locates him, shows him his place; and in exchange for that gift, he must pay it proper attention-which, in many of these poems, involves the precise-as- possible naming of plants and animals. It also involves the not-always-gentle interaction of the human and the natural. Barrax has a number of poems about wounding or killing animals, in his car or in his yard: here is one of the most powerful and involved. WHAT MORE? My lawnmower has awakened the resident god of my yard who rubs its leafy hand in anticipation of troubling me again with one of its cruel koans, this one a small bird dropped from the sky, or thrown out, out of the sweetgum tree where I was cutting that long triangle of grass outside the back fence: put there when I wasn't looking, it lies on its back twitching half in and out of the swath I cut a minute before. I'm being tampered with again, like an electron whose orbit and momentum are displaced by the scientist's measurement 335</page><page sequence="10">CALLALOO and observation. If I'd found something already stiff and cold on the ground I'd have kicked or nudged it out of my path: but the just-dead, the thing still warm, just taken its last breath, made its last movement, has its own kind of horror. I leave the small patch of uncut grass around it. Back inside my enclosed yard I see a brown thrasher come and stand over the body, with some kind of food in its bill. (I was careful to say "bill" and not "mouth.") By the next time I cut myself around the yard, I see the thrasher sitting on the fence above the still dead, still holding whatever it has in its bill. I've described it all accurately. What more could anyone expect of me? The poem begins with a sort of joke-Barrax's genius loci rubbing its singular hand in anticipation of "troubling" him (perhaps with a Zen koan like "What is the sound of one hand clapping?")-but its tone quickly darkens when the poet discovers the just-mowed-over baby bird, precipitating questions (and images, like the displaced electron) similar to those posed earlier in "More and Less." Why this bird? Why me? Why now? What to do about it? What else can a poet do except "describe it all accurately," saying "bill" and not the anthropomorphic "mouth" when writing about the brown thrasher? And yet what could be more useless, for the birds, than such description? What more could anyone (the resident god; any onlooker; the poet himself) expect of the man in this situation? It seems that Barrax does expect more of himself, and feels that he has somehow violated the unity and beauty of nature, or at least of this local family-as he does in another poem, after killing a snake with a hoe to make the yard safe for his daughters. What more, then? It may be that Barrax longs to be part of a world where humans and nature would not be enemies, like his African ancestors were, who-if they'd seen the snake emerge to shed its skin-"considering its immortality, / Would've wel- comed it with food and drink / When it came as spirit of the living-dead from the forest / To visit their huts." Indeed, those ancestors may have achieved the unified worldview that Barrax seeks, the "humanly whole" existence foreign to most late 20th-century citizens, an existence with no divisions between the human and the natural and the divine at all: Black men building a Nation, My Brother said, have no leisure like them No right to waste at trees 336</page><page sequence="11">CALLALOO Inventing names for wrens and weeds. But it's when you don't care about the world That you begin owning and destroying it Like them. And how can you build Especially a Nation Without a soul? He forgot that we've built one already- In the cane, in the rice and cotton fields And unlike them, came out humanly whole Because our fathers, being African, Saw the sun and moon as God's right and left eye, Named Him Rain Maker and welcomed the blessings of his spit, Found in the rocks his stoney footprints, Heard him traveling the sky on the wind And speaking in the thunder That would trumpet in the soul of the slave. Forget this and let them make us deceive ourselves That seasons have no meaning for us And like them We are slaves again. ("To Waste at Trees") The closest approach Barrax has to this unified world comes during lovemaking: in one erotic metamorphosis, a sort of synesthesia of flora and fauna, he says, "I felt the quick surprise of our lovers' bodies / confused between desire and its transcendence / as buds unfolded from our nipples, / feathery willow began its slow growth / over your head and genitals, / and I was covered with peperomia, / in the crisp leaves of emerald ripple." 7. Death Death-the second of the "central realities of life" to Gerald Barrax, according to his first book's cover-is so pervasive in his work as to be almost impossible to extricate and analyze. His poems about Blackness and love and God and music and nature are all shadowed by death, by an awareness of mortality, by loss in its many degrees. "We are dying of loneliness / / in each other's arms," he says at the end of "Plot," a poignant double death. Animals die, people die, gods die; "life / Will go on as it will. Or it will not." What is a poet to make of all this passing-away? What's he to do? That's a crucial issue for Barrax, who doesn't want to deny the dark fact of so much death, but doesn't want to succumb to a fatalistic passivity either. In the ironically-titled "All My Live Ones," he writes about his childhood pets and how they died, then turns to the people in his life: 337</page><page sequence="12">CALLALOO Since nineteen thirty-three I've been the key to immortality: All it takes is loving me: Both parents, who had me When they were young; the brother Who left me there that morning Alone when that dog died; A wife who let me go With her life, our three sons; Another wife bringing Her hostages to fortune, Two daughters; all the lovers. What will I do? They are all here. At my age what will I do With only a bird and a dog long ago? I cried for days. For days and days. What starts off as a series of jolly rhymes turns into a litany of abandonment. Ironically, for a poet much obsessed by love, erotic and familial, "all it takes is loving me" to guarantee death, as if he were cursed with a negative Midas-touch. "What will I do?" he asks twice. What can he do, except describe it all accurately, and grieve, and get on with life? For now, at least, even if only in memory, "They are all here." Barrax has a number of striking poems about death in An Audience of One. "In the Restaurant" observes the vulnerable posture of people eating, and ends with a surprisingly tender and parental image: "Death holds us closer than hate / Feeding us mortality in such small portions." "King: April 4, 1968" links the squeamishness he felt after youthful hog-killing and bird-shooting to his feelings after King's assassina- tion: "when I learned that non / violence kills you anyway / I wished / I wished I could do it I wished I / could / do you know what it means to wish / you could kill, to / wish you were given that? // But I am / me." That "me" can't will himself to participate in the death of any living creature, and is haunted anytime he does, as in "The Passage of Shiva," when he hits a dog in the middle of the night in the middle of nowhere: Leaping into the lights somebody's dog after nobody's rabbit hit in midstride, one bite away. What apocalypse did I bring? Surely for the prey it was a visitation- a nova of deliverance: some passing god or Urban historian who saw and rendered immediate justice at 60 mph. 338</page><page sequence="13">C CALLALOO- For the dog, the death of a hunter, the Great Hunter's terrible swift wheel sending him to eternal good hunting where the scent was "for ever warm and still to be enjoyed." A rationalization, perhaps, but the road was mine anyway. Ours. Maybe that's the best this poet can do, in such a situation: offer a sympathetic imagination, a rationalization that alleviates some of his living guilt, and a single comprehensive word-"Ours"-to remind us that we all share the same dark road and will, one day, be "hit in midstride," frozen in mortality's high-beams. 8. "Dazzle gradually" Gerald Barrax is, finally, a domestic poet. Not domesticated, not tamed and trained: but domestic, centered on the home, the house and yard, the seat of self and family, the local that implies and embodies the universal. This is where all his concerns come to roost, to brood and hatch and fledge and fly. This is why he stays "so close to my domicile" and maintains such vigiliance toward his kin and his place and his days, the objects of his fierce love and attention. And this is why he writes them into his poems, to save the mingled joy and "sorrow we feel at the loss of days, / however they go," and to make some sense of them. -An experiment: If you substituted "Emily Dickinson" for "Gerald Barrax" in the preceding paragraph, and adjusted the gender of the pronouns accordingly, could that serve as a pretty fair description of her as well? I think so. And I think that's no accident: Barrax is a subtly allusive poet throughout his books, referencing many works of English and American literature, but Dickinson is clearly a soul-mate, surfacing in phrases and lines and titles (including Leaning Against the Sun, the last line of "I taste a liquor never brewed") and common lifelong poetic obsessions- death, love, God, nature, even music (however implicitly, as in her common meter hymn-stanzas). In fact, you could convert his four books' titles into an abcb ersatz Dickinsonian quatrain: He wrote-Another Kind of Rain- An Audience of One- Animals' deaths-and lesser Gods'- Leaning against the Sun- Less whimsically, both poets-from the perspective of their hardly-cozy domestic universes-are clearly passionate (is there a more subversively erotic poem than "Wild Nights-Wild Nights!"?), skeptical about religious orthodoxy (though God- 339</page><page sequence="14">CALLALOO haunted and -seeking), attentive to nature in all its ruthless detail, and firmly committed, again, to Tell all the Truth but tell it slant- Success in Circuit lies Too bright for our infirm Delight The Truth's superb surprise As Lightning to the Children eased With explanation kind The Truth must dazzle gradually Or every man be blind- That gradual bedazzlement is exactly the feeling I'm left with after reading Gerald Barrax three times now-first, when his books appeared individually, over the course of several decades; second, when making selections for my anthology of North Carolina poets four years ago, during which process he emerged as the poet whose work most surprised and pleased me upon rereading; and third, before writing this essay, over the past few weeks. Barrax eschews the easy razzle-dazzle, the rhinestone- in-the-sun flashes and flourishes that seem so cool when you first encounter them but don't age well at all: his approach is the sotto voce radiance of a diamond in a dim room, perfectly cut and lit. There have been times, in the past several decades, when I've wished that Barrax (like Dickinson?) weren't so enormously reticent, that he and his superbly surprising poems were heard more often and more loudly, here in the Triangle area of North Carolina where we've both long lived, and beyond: sometimes his profile has been so low as to be invisible! But as I've matured, and begun to appreciate the substantial achievement of his poetry (including its formal accom- plishment, its firm sense of the free-verse line and command of such traditional forms as blank verse, terza rima, sonnets, villanelles, and sestinas), I've realized how necessary this "slant" approach-to his life and his lines-is. Without it, he could not write with the gentle intensity, the measured rage and joy, and the quietly dazzling eloquence that makes his poetry so distinctive, in the often-murky literary din here at the end of the millenium. 340</page></plain_text>
