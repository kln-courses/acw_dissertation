<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARTICLES AUDITION IN THE OLD TESTAMENT1 The term 'audition' is intended to cover not only the hearing of a divine or heavenly voice, but also the hearing of any sound which mediated awareness of God. There is reason to think that audition was not uncommon in prophetic experience and that it may even have been the authenticating sign of the true prophet. This is not to be taken as denying the place of vision in prophetic experience or as distinguish ing vision sharply from audition, but as recognizing its greater rarity and therefore higher privilege. Vision was in any case a comparatively rare phenomenon. Audition, on the other hand, though still a thing of great privilege, seems to have been more widely spread. It was a recognized medium both for knowledge of or awareness of the presence of God and for the reception of His word. We must not, however, ascribe the auditory experiences of the modern mystics to the Hebrew prophets and men of God; just as Hebrew psychology rules out ecstasy as a suitable category to apply to their experience, so does it rule out mystical experience as a suitable field of comparison with Hebrew experience. The Hebrew Bible so frequently mentions the word of God and His speaking2 to men that we are bound to try to penetrate behind the metaphor and the symbol to their original literal meaning and usage. Three factors in Hebrew thought and experience have operated to make audition more frequent than any other (sensory) channel of awareness of God. (a)(a) Anthropomorphism. This first factor led to sense perceptions of God in general—sight, hearing, touch-—and not to hearing alone. God was conceived as having human form as well as human emotions. Lest the conception be thought to be earthbound we must set over against it the fact that' physical reference, for genuine Hebrew psycho logy, does not exclude reference to the psychical or spiritual qualities '.5 The form of God was never intruded and tended rather to fade gradually out of sight whilst other things such as speech and action together with the appropriate organs and limbs remain in the fore ground both of imagination and of recognition. Two factors may be said to have contributed to this shifting of emphasis from the static to 1 A paper read at the Summer Meeting of the Society for Old Testament Study, July 1947. י' e.g. d-b-r 646 times with men as subject, 443 God, and 37 an angel or spirit.

The one is the natural awe evoked by the majesty of God which compelled them to think of God's form as larger and grander than man's.1 The other receives classic expression in Isa. xxxi. 1-3 and is the growing belief that the substance of God must be as much opposed to the flesh which is man's proper substance as God's holiness is opposed to man's profaneness. God is spirit: God is dynamic. Fortunately these beliefs do not prevent a full and un ashamed anthropomorphism and personalization from bursting into blossom occasionally, as in the Tower of Babel story, or in the incident of Yahweh's meeting with Moses and seeking to kill him (Exod. iv. 24-6), or in the vivid picture of the bloodstained warrior coming from the field of Edom (Isa. lxiii. 1-6). They have a wealth of experience and spiritual perception behind them. With God thus personally conceived the experience of Him proper to such a conception was naturally both personal and physical/ The body was the basis of personality. On rare and privileged occasions men might see Him (Exod. xxiv, xxxiii). On less rare occasions, but with like privilege, He might be heard either as He spoke or as He went about pursuing His purpose. So powerful might the hearing of Him be that men's ears might well tingle at the sound.3 (b)(b) The second factor in determining the place occupied by audi tion in Hebrew experience is the belief that to hear God is fraught with less danger to the life of man than to see Him. The ancient Hebrews believed that man shall not see God and live; behind this belief there may have been fear of certain natural phenomena. Sight of God was therefore a special privilege. To hear God was still counted a privilege but it was not so sharply limited. 'Did ever people hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as thou hast heard, and live?': 'Ye heard the sound of words, but ye saw no form, only ye heard a voice.'4 (For a similar distinction between sight and sound one may compare the ancient practice of hiding the king's face, by veiling, from the sight of all but the most intimate of his subjects. 'The Sultan of Wadai always speaks from behind a curtain; no one sees his face except his intimates and a few favoured persons', Golden Bough, iii. 120. Frazer explains this as intended to ward off evil spirits.) (c) The third factor bringing audition into prominence was the characteristic Semitic conception of the dynamic objectivity of the 1 C. J. Montefiore, The Old Testament and After, p. 17. * See the article by the present writer in J.T.S., Jan.-Apr. 1946: 'The Hebrew Conception of Personality in Relation to the Knowledge of God.' 3 1 Sam. iii. 11; cf.

Prophetic, 1932, p. 13. 4 Deut. iv. 33, 12.</page><page sequence="3">ARTICLES 3 spoken word.1 Of the many sounds that may betray one's personal presence that of speaking is at once the most intimate and the most arresting and significant. Through it personality is expressed and influence and authority are exercised over others. The dynamic quality attributed by the Semites to speech is finely illustrated by the incident of the Arab who threw his son to the ground that the words of his enemy's curse might pass over his head and be harmless to him.2 Though by no means unique as a means of conveying personal power and influence,3 utterance by word, first spoken and later written, was more far-reaching in its effect than any other, and we need not wonder that, with the realism so characteristic of them, the Hebrews should expect to hear God giving effective utterance to His will. In finding their expectation realized they would be sharing in God's creative and redemptive work, some as agents, some as witnesses. It is clear that we cannot group together all references to the speech or word of God and all references to man's hearing God—His word or His activity—into a single category and dismiss them all as metaphor or symbol. We must interpret them differently according to the diver sity of intention and of spiritual outlook. First, as has already been made clear, we have to consider the possibility that the words mean what they say and that some actual auditory experience as of a ' voice from heaven' underlies them; secondly, there may be some occasions when it is not the speech of God that is heard but rather the sound of His presence; and thirdly, there is that large group of instances where the language remains but the reality has changed through change in the psychological and spiritual background. 1. 1. Direct Audition: The 'Voice from Heaven' In his discussion on the words of Jer. xxiii. 18 Dr. Skinner asks: ' Does this standing in the council of Yahwe denote a visionary experi ence, like the sublime scene described by Micaiah in 1 Kgs. xxii. 19-22, or a spiritual condition removed from every state of ecstasy? Is hearing the word of Yahwe to be understood as an audition which seemed to proceed from an external voice, or merely as an intuitive 1 L. Diirr, Die Wertung des Gottlichen Wortes im A. T. und im antiken Orient, 1938. נ Wellhausen, Reste arabischen Heidentums2, p. 139, n. 4, cited by Robinson, Inspiration Inspiration and Revelation in the Old Testament, 1946, p. 170. 3 Personal influence may also be mediated by the eye or the hands or by any other appropriate organ or limb, cf. the evil eye (Prov. xxiii. 6, xxviii. 22: Peder sen, Israel I-II, p. 175), the hand placed on the head for blessing (Gen. xlvsii. 14,17,18), or under the thigh for making an oath (Gen. xxiv. 2,9, xlvii. 29). The belief that personal power could be conveyed by things whether owned or previously handled by the person whose power was to be transmitted does not seem to have been strong among the Hebrews—Elisha's staff proved ineffective ( Kings iv. 29 ff.).</page><page sequence="4">4 THE .JOURNAL OF THEOLOGICAL STUDIES perception of what the mind of Yah we is?' (Prophecy and Religion, p. 194).1 He is not prepared to give direct answers to these questions. Is it because, like most of us, he was a stranger to the experience of audition? We examine the language without having the means to penetrate to the actual experience. The experience of Elijah on Horeb has a strongly marked auditory element. There, after the conventional signs of God's presence—wind, earthquake, fire—which failed to mediate Him, there was the sound of a thin demamah. The meaning silence silence is not natural in the context and it may be that the word should be derived from the root d-m-m found in Accadian (once in Heb., Isa. xxiii. 2) and meaning to make a low moaning sound. Such a sound as a light breeze might make would fit the context and is suggested by the LXX translation of the word in each of its occurrences-αυρα Job iv. 16, Ps. cvii. 29. (Bezold, Babylonisch-Assyrisches Glossar, gives the meanings for damamu as: jammern, bloken, wimmern, girren, wehklagen.)wehklagen.) The experience was at once both physical and spiritual in its effect on the prophet: physically he heard the sound and was constrained by fear of the unseen presence to wrap his face in his mantle ; spiritually he was strengthened for the tasks for which he was commissioned by God. In the canonical prophets we tend to find less reference to the physical element in the experience and more of the spiritual and moral. Amos iii. 7 f. reads: ' Surely the Lord God will do nothing but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets. The lion hath roared, who will not fear ? The Lord God hath spoken, who can but prophesy ?' Physical and spiritual are here again closely interwoven. The prophetic tradition is carried back and idealized in the experience attributed to Moses (Num. xii. 3), 'With him will I speak mouth to mouth . . . and the form of the Lord shall he behold In this tradition, as in the Deuteronomic account of Sinai (iv. 12), we notice the same tendency to set audition in the forefront, much as an artist will place his leading figure in the foreground with all else drawn towards it. Isaiah heard the voice of Yahweh saying: ,Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?' Jeremiah felt it to be the mark of the true prophet that he should stand in the council of Yahweh and hear His word (xxiii. 18). In Ezekiel the vision of the roll may be said 1 Cf. also Bevan, Sibyls and Seers, p. 104: 'Such experiences, in later centuries, suggest that the 'word of the Lord' which came to the Old Testa ment prophets may—in some cases at any rate—have been an audition, the voice from heaven seeming like the real voice of someone speaking close at hand.' H. W. Robinson, Inspiration and Revelation in the Old Testament, 1946, p. 178: . we may be confident that some abnormal experience, such as the arresting voice or vision, was essential to the call of a prophet, and that such experiences were renewed from time to time.' 1 Cf. also, without reference to vision, Num. vii. 89, Exod. xxv. 22, xxix. 42, xxxiv. 29-35.</page><page sequence="5">ARTICLES 5 to combine vision and audition, whilst in iii. 10 we read : ' Son of man, all my words that I shall speak unto thee receive in thine heart, and hear with thine ears.' Heart and ears are coupled in an exhaustive phrase for the whole man physical, psychical, and, as we would add, spiritual,1 and of the outer organs the ear is chosen as being that most concerned in the reception of God's word, while the heart is the inner organ responsible for its understanding and recording.1 So predomin ant is the auditory element in prophetic experience that two scholars, Jepson3 and Johnson,4 have put forward the view that the verb ch-z-h when it occurs in a prophetic context, in spite of the fact that it is ordinarily a synonym of ra'ah, denotes auditory rather than visionary experience. The significance of the word of God thus communicated to the prophet is seen in the injunction of Yahweh to Jeremiah—'Keep not back a word' (xxvi. 2; cf. xlii. 4). There must be no human hindrance to the full activity of Yahweh's creative power mediated through His word. As Dr. Wheeler Robinson said: an ' important aspect of the prophet's function consists in the liberation of a word of God, which becomes objectively powerful far beyond the range of the prophet's activity '.5 Two suggestions that have been put forward in recent years fit well into this pattern. The one is that of Mowinckel who replaces the con ception of the spirit of God in the pre-exilic reforming prophets by that of the word of God.6 He likens their reception of the word to that of ancient Arab seers who had their attendant 'whisperers'.7 The other is that the name Yahweh means 'He declares' or 'He speaks'. It is made by Bowman (Journal of Near Eastern Studies, Jan. 1944) and is based on the meaning of the root h-w-y from which Yahweh can be derived. The root meaning is to speak and is known both in 1 Cf. י The Hebrew Conception of Personality in Relation to the Knowledge of of God׳, J.T.S., 1946. * Cf. also Jer. xv. 16: י Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and thy words were unto me a joy and the rejoicing of mine heart.' In 1 Sam. iii. 1, 7, 21 the word of God is heard in a dream and is apparently induced in the manner technically known as 'incubation*. 3 Nabi, 1934, pp. 43 ff. 4 The Cultic Prophet in Ancient Israel, 1944, pp. 14 ff. 5 Inspiration and Revelatirn, p. 170. Dr. Martin Buber, in an informal talk in Mansfield College, recently said it was as if God deliberately refrained from doing what it was His prerogative to do in order that the prophet might do it for Him. 6 'The "Spirit" and the "Word" in the Pre-exilic Reforming Prophets', 1934. י Mohammed probably belonged to the same line of tradition although he dissociated himself from dependence on Jinns: Tor Andrae, Mahommed, the Man and his Faith.

His conclusion about the divine name is stated as follows: 'We have found a new meaning for the root h-w-y used in the Tetragrammaton. Its use gives us the meaning "He declares" or "He speaks" as the original meaning of the name of Yahweh' (p. 5). 2. Indirect Audition God's activity on earth is not and cannot be limited to His speech to and with man. He moved about the earth and men heard His move ments: Adam and Eve heard the sound of God walking in the garden (iii. 8). 'And it shall be, when thou hearest the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry trees, that then thou shalt bestir thyself: for then is the Lord gone before thee to smite the host of the Philistines' (2 Sam. v. 24): here the explanation of the audition is made patent. It is implied also in Ezek. i. 24: 'And when they went I heard the noise of their wings like the noise of great waters, like the noise of the Almighty, a noise of tumult like the noise of an host.' An instructive reference is Job xxxvii. 2-5 : Hearken ye unto the noise of His voice, And the sound that goeth forth out of His mouth. He sendeth it forth under the whole heaven And His lightning unto the ends of the earth. After it a voice roareth; He thundereth with the voice of His majesty: And He stayeth them not when His voice is heard. God thundereth marvellously with His voice; Great things doeth He, which we cannot comprehend. The mention of niphla'oth and gedoloth show that this passage refers to God's creative and conservative activity; later on in the same chapter (verse 16) Elihu instances the balancings of the clouds as amongst the supreme wonders of God. Ps. lxxvii. 18, 19 hints at hearing God at work in the Red Sea crossing—a factor in the making of history. Amos i. 2 and Jer. xxv. 30, which show the transforming power of God's judgement in storm and/or Sirocco, may take their origin in the spoken sentence of judgement—'The Lord shall roar from Zion, and utter his voice from Jerusalem.' ' Nature and History', wrote Dr. Robinson,1 'are simply different aspects of the continued activity of God, and miracles are the representative occasions on which that activity specially impresses human consciousness.' It is on such representative occasions that God is heard by men. Is it to be wondered at that men who believed that God's own Panirn, i.e. He Himself, could be amongst them doing His work should also believe ' Inspiration and Revelation, p. 39.</page><page sequence="7">ARTICLES 7 that they could become aware of Him ?* Moreover there is the strong tradition of the creation of the world by the fiat of God. This appears not only in direct statements like that of Ps. xxxiii. 9,1 but also in cases where the verb used in the Hebrew is that meaning to call, or where a name is given or uttered: to call by name may often imply bringing into existence whilst the giving of a new name involves a change of nature which is in itself a creative act. Not only in the realm of things but also in that of history the movements of men or of natural phenomena which control men's movements are determined by the call of God.3 The thunderstorm as the most obvious and awe-compelling instance of God's terror-striking power came to be closely associated with auditory awareness of God. ' Hast thou an arm like God, or canst thou thunder with a voice like his ?' Job xl. 9. Does the arm refer to the lightning, the connexion being the flashing sword held by it? The classic example of the association of thunder and the voice or sound of God is Ps. 29 where ' the recurrent phrase, Kol Yahweh, runs through the verses like clap after clap of thunder '.4 Chariot and storm are probably linked in Ps. lxviii. 33: 'To him that rideth upon the heavens of heavens, which are of old; lo, he uttereth his voice, and that a mighty voice.'5 If it be reasonable to suppose that the cherubim are symbols of the cloud masses it may not be fanciful to see in Num. vii. 89 a static representation of a theophanous thunderstorm: ' he heard the voice speaking unto him. . . from between the two cherubim'.6 3. The Development into Symbol In the last reference we have passed already from the real and actual to to the metaphorical and symbolic. Whatever a man may directly hear or apprehend of God must inevitably be but a small part of the fullness of of God's reality: ' Lo, these are but the outskirts of his ways: and how small a whisper do we hear of him ? But the thunder of his power, who can understand?' Job xxvi. 14. The actuality on earth is there fore also a symbol for the greater thing in God's realm. It may be claimed, moreover, that behind the symbols of speech and word we are able to see the reality and to appreciate that in God for which they stand.7 As Bevan suggests, such a figure may have a greater truth for the feeling than the more correct intellectual statement of it. Such figurative and symbolic use of words denoting speech and 1 Exod. xxxiii. 14, Deut. iv. 37 (cf. mention of voice in previous verse), Isa. lxiii. 9 (LXX). 1 Cf.

An instructive example is the verb '-n-h, to answer. Where God is its subject there remains no trace of an original realistic use. It is, on the other hand, a frequent synonym of the verb hoshia', to save. This usage arises, presumably, from the fact that although the initial response of God to man's call for help is vocal in conception, the ultimate answer lies in the actual help rendered. Of the many forms in which speech symbolism occurs, that of the quasi-independent word is the most significant. It belongs to the group of attempts1 to articulate such experiences of God as bridge the gap between God and the world, and is one of the tributaries which fed the New Testament logos conception. It is tempting to see the transition from actual to metaphorical taking place by noting that when Deutero-Isaiah wished to convey the sense of actual audition and external origin for his message he would say ' a voice crying' (or, ' Hark, one crying') instead of ' Thus saith the Lord' which, by his time, had been reduced to a formula.1 The transition was made within the realm of the personal so that we may say with Edwyn Bevan that 'the voice from heaven became, not a sound carried through space, but the speaking of Spirit to spirit within a man's heart'.3 L.
