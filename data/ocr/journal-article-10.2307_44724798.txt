ABSTRACT The timing of liver laceration in swine during the course of a blunt impact was investigated. The swine were impacted on the upper abdomen by the lower segment of a steering wheel at 6, 9 and 12 m/s. The degree of compression in each impact was controlled independently from 10 to 50%. By varying when "the punch of an impact was pulled," we reproduced progressive segments of a longer duration blunt impact. Autopsy of the subjects demonstrated that lacerations were initiated after 8 ms of loading at 9 m/s and 6 ms of loading at 12 m/s. The time of injury was concurrent with the time when the Viscous res- ponse exceeded a threshold of 1.2 m/s in our specimens. The Viscous injury criterion, de- fined as the peak Viscous response, was found to be the best predictor of liver laceration. We conclude that the Viscous response relates to the actual etiology of injury, in addition to being an excellent correlative measure. Our deduction of the timing of injury occurrence was confirmed by an analysis of published cadaver data where skeletal injuries can be observed. Field data of occupant injury in a side impact were re-examined in light of these findings to determine the optimal side impact protection. We found evidence that injury from both a high speed impact and from slower crushing is possi- ble in a side crash. Our computer simulations also suggest that an anthropomorphic test device (ATD) with human-like compliance is necessary if laboratory test results are to reflect field performance . INTRODUCTION Our previous studies have shown that reducing the viscous response of the abdomen by softening the tipping force of the steering wheel virtual- ly eliminated the risk of serious liver injury in our tests. Those studies were sufficiently conclusive to promote the introduction of the self aligning steering wheel. We have conducted a variety of studies to challenge our hypothe- ses, but we have felt the need for an additional study to pinpoint the mechanism and timing of liver injury by steering wheel impact. Our additional experiments indicated that the Vis- cous response is predictive of the underlying cause of impact injury, although there is a very narrow distribution of injury tolerance within a tightly controlled population of test specimens, and a much wider distribution for real world occupants . A sigmoidal relationship exists between the biomechanical cause, such as the Viscous res- ponse, and the probability of a particular se- verity of injury. In such a probabilistic rela- tionship between biomechanical response and injury risk, there are two regions of response where the risk of injury is either very low or very high, with a steep transition between the two extreme outcomes (Fig 1) . Within that tran- sitional zone, the injury risk increases rapidly from 25% to 75%. Since a majority within a population of specimen will traverse from non- injury to injury within those levels of res- ponse, we define that transitional zone as the threshold region. Those injured at the lower response levels are the weaker samples of the population, and conversely the high tolerance specimens, the stronger samples. In real-world crashes, the weaker specimens may be represented by the older, more frail occupants, and the stronger samples, the young, robust adults. 4.1138 0096-736X/89/9704-1 1 38$02.50 Copyright 1989 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">881714 Fig 1: Threshold region defined by the sigmoidal relationship between injury risk and biomechanical response. In our previous research we defined the biome- chanical response at a 25% probability of criti- cal injury outcome as the 'tolerance' for the population. This was selected recognizing the need to assure protection for the weaker occu- pants who were more than adequately represented in the cadaver data bases used to conduct the statistical analysis. In addition, we have standardized our analysis using the Logist func- tion in the Statistical Analysis System package. In a previous study of steering wheel induced liver injury (1 2), we demonstrated that the Viscous criterion, [VC] max, indicated the expo- sure severity for the upper abdomen in a sled test. The Viscous criterion (3 4 5) is defined as the peak Viscous response, which is a time function formed by multiplying the velocity of deformation and the compression of the torso. Using a programmable impactor, we then reproduc- ed the time course of the injurious impact up to [VC] max and abruptly stopped the loading (2) . Liver lacerations of similar severity as in the sled tests occurred in those impactor experi- ments. Additional experiments to be reported here demonstrated when injury was initiated between contact and [VC] max. Since visceral injury cannot be readily observed as it happens, the event must be timed indirect- ly. In this report, we describe experiments in which we controlled and monitored the time course of impacts to the abdomen at different assigned combinations of velocity and compres- sion, thereby reproducing selected segments of an impact event. By combining the results of the present tests with those from previous Fig 2: Hypothetical examples of the Viscous response in a non-injury pro- ducing versus an injury producing impact. tests, we were able to isolate the biomechanical cause of the injury and deduce its time of in- duction with a high level of confidence. In two very similar subjects, one Viscous res- ponse may have a peak value just below the threshold region, while another can rise above the the threshold region (Fig 2) . This is typi- cal of experiments in which injury did not occur in the first case, but did in the second. Our hypothesis would say that injury was initiated within the time when the response was in the transitional region. This study was set up to confirm or refute that hypothesis with regard to upper abdominal injury by steering wheel rim loading. In the process, we again challenged the predictiveness of the Viscous response by comparing it with other biomechanical responses against injury outcome, and by collating the timing of their peak amplitude. Application of the injury functions identified from cadaver and animal experiments in an anthropomorphic test device requires biofidelity in the force-deflection response to impact. This is paramount since injury is caused by deflections associated with a viscous or crush- ing mechanism and assessment of injury risk in a dummy can only be done from a force-deflection response that closely follows the human reaction to impact. Proper reproduction of the force- deflection and deflection-time response is re- quired to characterize ATD biofidelity. Ade- quate biofidelity is a prerequisite for real- istic injury assessment, even with the correct injury criterion. The human chest can be char- acterized by an initial stiffness followed by a force plateau to maximum deflection (Fig 3) . Such a response indicates that the impacted torso can be represented mechanically by an elastic spring and a viscous dashpot coupled between a front and a rear mass. A gradual 4.1139</page><page sequence="3">vO/V Deflection Time Fig 3: Biofidelity can be defined by Force-deflection and Deflection-time history . force build up also reflects a low mass between the impactor and the viscoelastic elements. Knowing the mechanism of injury and the instant of injury are an important prerequisite toward the design of an optimal countermeasure . Atten- tion can then be focused on the occupant's interaction with the car interior during or before that time to reduce the injury hazard. This study seeks to pinpoint the mechanism and the timing of injury induction in an impact environment which resembles that of the typical unrestrained occupant in a frontal or lateral crash . Given a valid injury criterion, a probabilistic risk function, and a test device with biofideli- ty, it is possible to conduct an assessment of safety design concepts. This effort is most realistic if laboratory performance of the con- cept is analyzed in relation to the real-world injury patterns it tries to prevent. The common link between the laboratory and real-world crashes is the severity of the exposure, most frequently reported as the change in velocity of the struck vehicle or the test velocity. This linkage is important because there are two com- peting effects in real-world crashes. First, the incidence of crashes decreases as the sever- ity increases, i e there are more low severity crashes. Second, in contrasting fashion, the risk of occupant injury increases with the severity of a crash. Another focus of the study was to apply the same principles to evaluate side impact protection. Previous studies (5 6) have shown that too stiff an ATD (7) could directly result in interior designs with negligible benefit in field acci- dents. Our data of lateral human impact res- ponse confirm that available ATDs are stiff er than and develop four times the plateau force of the human torso. A simulation study using the latest impact response data of the human and the ATDs demonstrates that a non-biof idelic ATD or a non-representative test severity can lead to designs that do not benefit the occupant in an impact, placing persons with low tolerance at particular risk. EXPERIMENTAL MATERIALS AND METHODS Nine swine, * weighing 46.7 * 2.0 Kg, were restrained without excitement by a spring assisted injection of ketamine (20 mg/Kg,IM) and acepromazine (200 ug/Kg,IM) followed by atropine (0.08 mg/Kg,IM). The swine were then induced to a surgical plane of anesthesia with a mixture of fentanyl (40 ug/Kg,IM) and droperidol (2mg/Kg,IM) and maintained on an equal mixture of oxygen and nitrous oxide with 1-1.5% halo- thane. They breathed spontaneously in a dorsal recumbency on a V-shaped support for preparatory surgery, which was the same as in previous tests (2).

Locations of the accelerometers relative to the principal direction of the impact is also shown. The swine were maintained vertically in a sling during the tests. Particular adaptational aids required for a quadruped to maintain basal phy- siologic functions during vertical suspension were discussed and published previously (2) . The test consisted of ą direct impact of the swine at the xyphoid, or 50 mm below it, using the lower arc of the wheel as the impacting interface (Fig 4) . A pneumatic impactor was programmed to strike at 6, 9 or 12 m/s for an assigned torso compression of 10 to 50X. The assigned compression may differ from the actual peak compression, since the back of the animal was free to move during the impact. To minimize the number of animals required, some of the swine were used in more than one test when we judged that injury had not occurred after a mild thump, consistent with the low injury risk ob- served in our previous experiments. A perito- neal lavage was always performed before the final, possibly injurious impact, which was applied only if the lavage was negative for blood in the peritoneum, confirming the absence of lacerative injury. We found no evidence for predisposition for lacerations in the milder impacts from petechias or bruising. Those ani- mals subjected to multiple impacts are identifi- ed in the results. In any given animal, only one injury producing impact was applied. High speed movies of the impact were taken at 1,000 frames per second. Frame-by-frame analysis of the impact event formed the basis for the ins- tantaneous deflection data of the torso. The instantaneous deflection data were processed to derive the compression response and the Yiscous response (Fig 5) based on an established algor- ithm (3) . Midsternal acceleration and spinal acceleration at T12 along the direction of the impact were monitored by accelerometers. Con- tact was indicated by a flash on a movie frame and a simultaneous tick mark on an electronic data channel, generated by the same contact switch closure, which defined time zero. The acceleration channels were processed by a Chan- nel Class 180 filter. The time of peak compres- sion and Viscous response, and peak sternal and spinal accelerations were recorded for each test. In the film analysis, interpolation was made between adjacent frames to establish time zero where necessary. A summary follows of the injury criteria and injury functions which were examined. They were used as the basis to deduce the time of injury induction, which was collated against our empirical observations.

Spinal Acceleration Criterion [Gspjmax - The peak spinal acceleration response. A thorough truncal necropsy for each of the animals followed established procedures (2) . The focus of the necropsy was the presence and the severity of liver lacerations. Those obser- vations were subdivided into three categories. When no tears were observed in the Glisson' s membrane and the parenchymal tissues, ie absence of bleeding, the category of no lacerations was assigned. Simple tears of the Glisson' s mem- brane no deeper than 5 mm anywhere in the paren- chymal tissues were designated as superficial lacerations. Such lacerations usually would not require surgical intervention in a human. Tears deeper than 5 mm at its deepest point, stellate shaped lacerations, and junctional tears between liver lobes were all considered deep and exten- sive lacerations. Deep and extensive lacera- tions usually resulted in severe hemorrhage and might require surgical intervention in a human. Such an injury could be considered to be a severe or critical threat to life. Results from the present experiments were combined with those from previous experiments to determine when and if liver lacerations occurred. A Logist analy- sis was performed on each of the criteria to determine its correlation with, and the threshold for liver lacerations. Previous experiments included in this data ana- lysis are four impactor tests at 9 m/s using the same setup, and six Hyge sled tests. The previ- ous tests are identified in the results section. The sled tests were performed at a velocity of 9 m/s, and were designed to evaluate the influence on abdominal injury of changing steering wheel stiffness. Abdominal impact of the swine in the sled test was also induced by the lower rim of the steering wheel. The sled would be traveling at test velocity by the time of the impact, and the unrestrained swine would interact freely with the steering system. Three liver injury producing sled tests using a stiff er wheel, and three non-injurious sled tests using a softer wheel (Table 1) were extracted from the complete sled data set (2) . The four previous impactor tests (Table 3) were designed to simulate the initial rapid phase of abdominal compression in the stiff er-wheel sled tests. The lower rim of the wheel impacted the swine on the upper abdo- men at 5 cm below the xyphoid in both the pre- vious sled and impactor tests. THE SLED TESTS An understanding of the biomechanics of injury in the previous sled tests is pertinent to the new impactor study. Abdominal compression in a sled test can be subdivided into time segments based on torso interaction with the steering system (Fig 6) . During the initial contact, the lower rim of the wheel compressed the abdomen at the highest rate encountered within the impact event. We are calling that period the rapid compression phase. [VC] max occurred at approxi- mately the end of the rapid compression phase. Abdominal compression slowed down when column compression was initiated by hub contact of the thorax. We are calling that period the gradual compression phase. Decompression of the torso began as it rebounded and expanded toward its original shape. The subject then gained suffi- cient velocity from the impact to travel down the test track at sled velocity. We are calling that period the decompression phase. The pivo- tal difference based on wheel parameters between the lacerative and the non-lacerative sled tests was steering wheel stiffness (Fig 7) . The stif- fer wheel compressed the abdomen at the test velocity of the sled, whereas the softer wheel deformed during the rapid compression phase to shorten the rapid compression phase and reduce the velocity of abdominal deformation. The lacerative and the non-lacerative sled tests were best discriminated by [VC] max among the injury criteria (Table 1) . THE IMPACTOR TESTS Among the injury criteria examined, [VC] max provided the most definitive laceration thres- hold (Fig 9). The level, or the effective dose of impact severity at which 50% of the subjects were injured, called [ED 5 0 ] , was 1.2 m/s. As [VC] max increased beyond the threshold, deep and extensive lacerations were produced. Whereas liver lacerations could be induced with a [C]max of less than 20% at 12 m/s (Table 4) , the tolerable [C]max exceeded 35% at 6 m/s (Table 2) . Although [Gst] max and [Gsp] max were higher when the impact was applied to the xyphoid than to 5 cm below it, liver injury did not appear to depend on the 5 cm variation of impacting site. Neither correlated with liver lacerations, even if the contact location was kept constant for the analysis (Fig 9). In a Logist analysis, the sharpness of the transitional zone defines the sensitivity of a biomechanical response, and the injury discrimination by the criterion. TIMING THE INITIATION OF INJURY Since the sled tests were performed at 9 m/s, abdominal impact by the lower rim of the stiff er wheel in the sled test could be simulated by impactor tests at the same speed. Previous impactor tests (Table 3) were designed to simu- late only the rapid compression phase and then retract abruptly (Fig 8) . Those tests showed 4.1142</page><page sequence="6">881714 Fig 6: Time segments of a sled-induced impact to the upper abdomen (Test 1075) based on torso interaction with the stiffer steering wheel.

Previous tests to simulate the initial rapid compression phase of the stiff er-wheel sled tests are designated by a P in the run number. that liver injury was of similar severity as long as the full rapid compression phase of the sled-induced impact by the stiff wheel was re- produced. The gradual compression phase was less significant in injury causation despite the higher compression because the velocity of de- formation was much slower. The time of injury initiation remains to be demonstrated by the new impactor experiments. By supposition, exposure severity increases as an injury criterion increases. Since injury criteria are simply peak values of their respec- tive time functions, injury potential is the highest at the peak of the injury functions. The demarcation between no-laceration and minor- laceration cases forms the most precise empiri- cal indication of an injury threshold, which was computed mathematically by Logist analysis for the respective criteria. In those cases of minor laceration, each criterion was suggesting that the injury was initiated at the peak of the respective injury function as it narrowly ex- ceeded the threshold. Therefore, one can pin- point the time of injury induction by comparing the injury functions of the no-laceration versus the minor-laceration cases. Based on impactor tests at 9 m/s (Fig 10a), one can establish that an impact to the abdominal viscera did not produce liver lacerations until [VC (t) ] had attained at least 1.2 m/s after about 8 ms. Our empirical observation of a tolerance of 1.2 m/s certainly lies within that threshold region between 1.17 and 1.31 m/s res- pectively (Fig 9) . Within the limitations of the test methodology, a subthreshold test at 9 m/s, by design, was the initial portion of an above-threshold test at the same speed, which in turn was the initial portion of the rapid com- pression phase in a sled test. In fact, the only difference among them was the amount of assigned stroke after contact, ie, when the punch was pulled. Therefore, the comparison between the subthreshold and above-threshold tests demonstrated that liver lacerations began after about 8 ms of loading for the 9 m/s impact as the Viscous response exceeded the lower boundary of the injury threshold. One can also deduce analogously that abdominal injury in the sled test was induced when and if the Viscous response exceeded threshold. [VC] max for the stiff and soft wheel tests were above and below the threshold region respectively (Fig 7) . At 6 m/s (Fig 11) , the Viscous response required over 20 ms to attain its peak value, which re- mained below the threshold of 1.2 m/s. No liver laceration was produced among those impacts. By contrast, at 12 m/s the Viscous response exceed- ed threshold 6 ms after contact. Autopsy showed that minor liver lacerations were induced by the much quicker loading within a shorter stroke and duration in that test. The logical deduction of the time of injury initiation can be extended to cases of extensive lacerations. One can conclude analogously that lacerations were initiated in those tests as the Viscous response exceeded threshold. Lacerations then became more extensive as the Viscous res- ponse continued to rise higher and stayed above the threshold. Those tests explained the ex- tensive lacerations observed in the sled tests with the stiff er wheel. 4.1146</page><page sequence="10">881714 Fig 10: The Viscous response (a) and Compression response (b) of se- lected minor-laceration (Test #5, #7) versus non-injury cases (Test #3, #8) at 9 m/s.

Considerations for Compression, Acceleration and Power Criteria Using [C]max as the basis to examine the same minor-laceration versus no-laceration cases at 9 m/s, one would have to conclude that laceration was initiated after about 12 ms of contact as a [C]max of 30% was attained (Fig 10b). Experi- ments at 6 m/s disproved that possibility be- cause no injury was observed for a [C]max of 30% or higher (Fig lib) . As the compression res- ponse approached [Cjmax, the rate of torso com- pression was always approaching sero, and im- pacts at 6 m/s or 9 m/s were compressing the torsos of very similar subjects quasi-statical - ly. Since injury was produced in one case but not the other, [C]max as an index of injury severity is only a correlative measurement with- in narrow ranges of impact velocity and cannot be used to determine the time of injury occur- rence in a moderate to high speed impact. Inju- ry by excessive compression alone in an impact remains possible. Those injuries, called crush- ing injuries, tend to be characterised by exten- sive rib fractures before soft tissues are in- volved in a chest impact (10). In our 6 m/s tests, the impactor could not induce sufficient torso compression to cause injury in the present experimental set up because whole body movement limited the actual abdominal compression to less than 40%. The magnitude of [Gstjmax and [Gspjmax depended on the load path between the impact site and the respective acce lerome ter. When impact was ap- plied to the xyphoid, the sternum provided a 4.1147</page><page sequence="11">Fig 12: The Viscous response1, compression response2 and V2 (t) 3 of a test from a study by Kroell et ai (9) . Initiation of fractures was properly indicated by the Viscous response but not by the compression response, nor by V2 (t) . direct load path from the contact point to the accelerometer resulting in a higher [Gst]max with a minimal time delay. Similarly, the force of an impact to the xyphoid was transmitted efficiently across the rib cage to the spine, which induced a higher [Gsp]max. By contrast, when the impact was applied only 5 cm lower to the abdominal viscera, soft tissues became an additional viscoelastic component of the load path, reducing the peak magnitude while inducing additional delay for both the sternal and the spinal accelerations. The 5 cm variation of impact site did not affect injury outcome be- cause the sites stayed within the perimeter of the liver mass. Peak spinal acceleration always followed peak sternal acceleration in a given impact, reflecting transmission of the impact force across the mechanical impedance between the frontal structures and the spine. The peak of the square of the instantaneous velocity of deformation, [V2(t)]max, has been suggested as a proxy of the peak instantaneous power dissipated by the torso (11) . Instanta- neous power, like skeletal acceleration, impact force, and torso compression, may correlate with injury due to their common link to the overall severity of an impact. By isolating the bio- mechanical cause and the time of injury induc- tion, one can determine that [V2(t)]max is also an inadequate injury criterion. In these impac- tor tests, energy continues to be fed into the impactor pneumatically within the course of an impact. Therefore, the time of [V2(t)]max is variably dependent on the assigned velocity of impact, the initiation of back movement, and the complex interaction between the torso and the impacting interface. However, [V2(t)]max always precedes [VC] max and the time of highest injury risk. In a pendulum impact, the initial contact velocity always equals the highest velocity of deformation (Fig 12). However, injury risk is never the highest and internal trauma does not occur at contact. Although our study has focused on liver lacera- tion, the arguments apply equally well for in- juries of other body regions. The basis of our contention follows that if an injury criterion is the peak value of an injury function, and if the function follows the causal impact response, injury is induced when the response, as well as the corresponding injury function, exceeds the tolerance of the subject synchronously. The Viscous response meets those requirements in frontal, side or oblique impacts (12 13). 4.1148</page><page sequence="12">881714 An Observable Empirical Example The study presented here is one of the first to investigate systematically the time of injury. We cannot find any other reference with its primary focus on the time of injury induction within a blunt impact. There is at least one paper in the literature that has followed the initiation of rib fractures anecdotally. Kroell et al (9) examined the dynamics of the human chest in a blunt impact. In a particular experiment, the fasciae were removed from a specimen, exposing the ribs. The subject was impacted at 7.2 m/s with a 23.1 Kg pendulum. In that test, rib fractures began at 9.2 ms after contact. Film data of the test were reanalyzed (Fig 12). [VC] max of 0^85 m/s in that test occurred at 8.3 ms. [C]max was at 20 ms, which confirmed the published data. Qnly two frac- tures were observed in that test. The exposure narrowly exceeded the subject's tolerance for rib fractures. In that test, the Viscous response properly indicated when fractures began; the compression response and [V2(t)] did not. In the larger cadaver data set (3), [VC] max of 0.85 m/s in a thoracic impact corresponds to only a 6% chance of acquiring an AIS4 injury and a 40% chance of acquiring an ÀIS3 injury. Injury of that particular specimen was an AIS2. Impactor versus Sled Test Environments In an impactor test, the subject is stationary before an impact. The impact induces only mini- mal whole body movement before it returns to rest. The subject in a Hyge sled test is also stationary before an impact. Within the course of the impact, and indifferent to injury causa- tion, the subject always accelerates to sled velocity. The difference between those test environments has profound influence on accelera- tion measurements and criteria, but minimal effects on injury criteria based on torso deformation. Since torso deformation is defined as displace- ment of the point of contact relative to the opposite side of the subject, whole body move- ment will not influence its interpretation. However, whole body acceleration in the sled environment, which does not affect injury out- come, can increase skeletal acceleration. Maxi- mum sternal acceleration is usually not affected because it peaks within the initial few milli- seconds before whole body acceleration begins (Fig 6) . However , peak spinal acceleration is generally increased and delayed because the largest component of the spinal acceleration is often attributable to the whole body accelera- tion of the subject as it seeks to attain sled velocity. The initial pulse of spinal accelera- tion, which corresponds to torso deformation within the rapid compression phase, is sometimes neglected because it can be lower than the pulse induced by whole body acceleration. The dispa- rity between those test environments explains 75 r Frontal Impact 50 - Spinal A VCmax -, 2 _ ■K-a E=3 _ ^ bü M II ^ = = a. 25 - = = - 1 g IIIIIIHI = 0 == = ^ ° g m/s ° Side Impact 75 TTl(d) 1 i ~ === f ļ| Pendulum Test bo 25 - ==[]1W o -L ^^3 - LL g Fig 13: Spinal acceleration and [VC] max from impactor tests and sled tests in a frontal upper abdominal impact of swine by a steering wheel rim at 9 m/s (3) .

Since the Viscous criterion follows the causal injury response, it indicates injury potential independently of the impact environment. Similar characteristics of the respective test environment are also evident in side impact based on data published by the NHTSÀ (14) . TTI, a side impact injury criterion proposed by the NHTSA, is the sum of two components: a ske- letal acceleration based portion, and a second component based on the subject's age. The two components accounts for 60 and 40% of TTI 's magnitude respectively in the original cadaver data set. Since age cannot be measured in a dummy, TTI has evolved into TTI(d) by omitting the age component of TTI. However, for similar injury severity (AIS Ì 3), the acceleration- based criterion TTI(d) is three times higher in a sled test than a pendulum test (Fig 13b) in the NHTSA data set, for the same reasons as in frontal tests.

Delta V of the struck car will significantly influence TTI(d) in a test, regardless of injury causation. INFLUENCE OF TEST VELOCITY AND ANTHROPOMORPHIC TEST DEVICE ON THE CHOICE OF COUNTERMEASURE Animal tests provide the most definitive model of occupant injury because of their physiologi- cal vitality. The imposed homogeneity of the test subjects, such as similar size and age, provides a group of specimens with very similar thresholds of injury. Animal tests, therefore, are an important and powerful safety research tool. However, animal tests must only be used judiciously when alternatives are unavailable. To minimize the number of swine needed for this study, some of them were subjected to multiple impacts of increasing severity. In a parameter study, the best approach is computer simulation. We simulated the force-deflection characteris- tics and the force-acceleration history of the J944 Blak Tuffy, the SID, the Hybrid III, and the human lateral thorax and abdomen by varying the parameter values of the original Lobdell model of the chest (Fig 14) . A matched dynamic force-deflection characteristics, along with a matched deflection-time history, is the best indicator that the proper impedance of the ATD or the human torso is mathematically reproduced. The models were impacted by a lOOKg mass, which would not underestimate the inertia of the sup- porting structures of the steering system in a frontal impact, or the struck door with the front end of the striking car in a side impact. With those models, we examined how changing the impact velocity and the ATD could affect the optimal choice for crushable EA structures or materials. The optimal choice was based on the most appropriate injury criterion associated with that ATD or the human. These hypothetical crushable EA structures or materials, with a 5 cm available stroke, was characterized by a constant crush force. Effect of Test Velocity The simulation indicated clearly that the opti- mal crush force of the EA structure or material increased as the impact speed increased, regard- less of the ATD or the choice of injury crite- rion (Figs 15, 16). Therefore, to optimize a countermeasure in a high speed test, an engineer would choose a high crush force structure or material. However, if the test speed were dri- ven much higher than the injury threshold region or the the speed at which most field accidents occurred, those countermeasures that performed well in the severe laboratory tests would be ineffective in reducing human injury risks appreciably in the field. Thus, it is most effective to design countermeasures in the steep, threshold region of the sigmoidal proba- bility function. Fig 17 shows such a sigmoidal function along with the test speed at which 1 v ó. Blak Tuffy ~20- / 2 ' / &lt;?.

The constant crush force on the abscissa is indica- tive of the material properties of the interface. Peak force is the crite- rion used here because it is specified in J211 to measure steering system performance . those criteria may be derived. Note that a 25% reduction at the high exposure region represents less than 10Ä in injury risk. In contrast, a 25% reduction in the steep region of the sigmoi- dal response results in a 50% reduction in inju- ry risk. In the plateau region of over expo- sure, reduction in the injury criterion can represent zero reduction in injury risk. Based on the Blak Tuffy test for a steering wheel, an engineer would design the steering system structure to yield at 8.5 kN or 16.0 kN if the test were at 6.7 m/s or 10 m/s respec- tively. However, he must also consider that the stiff er structure would provide no energy absorption even for the Blak Tuffy - a stiff, non-human like ATD, when the impact velocity was below 7 m/s (Fig 18). Therefore, in an accident of moderate severity, the occupant would derive no benefit from that countermeasure. The more susceptible occupants with lower injury thres- holds, such as children and the elderly, would be among the first to be injured. The Effects of ATP The dynamic stiffness of an ATD has an even more profound effect on the choice of countermeasure. Since the Hybrid III chest is much softer than the Blak Tuffy, the proper countermeasure indi- cated by the Hybrid III is also much softer than that indicated by the Blak Tuffy at the same speed (Fig 16). For example, the optimal steer- ing system for chest protection indicated by the 4.1151</page><page sequence="15">3-. 10m/s 3ļ Hybrid III Chest ' ' / / 'w ' / Human U &gt; « . » 10 m/s &lt;: ' v / Human U Abdomen &gt; « . &gt; .

[VC] max is the criterion used here because it is the most predictive criterion for impact exposure at those velocities. Fig 17: Interrelationship between inju- ry risk, injury criteria, and test speed. Zones 1 and 2 represent 25% reduction of biomechanical response, but 10% and 50% reduction of injury risk respectively. Hybrid III at 6.7 m/s yields at 2.5 kN, which is less than one third the crush force as that indicated by the Blak Tuffy. In fact, Hybrid III tests indicate that the optimal choices suggested by the Blak Tuffy tests at 6.7 m/s or 10 m/s have no effect on Hybrid III response and will not reduce human injury risk over the full range of impact velocity (Fig 19a) . Those EA structures simply behave like rigid ones in a Hybrid III test. Since the human abdomen in a lateral impact is even softer than the Hybrid III chest, countermeasures suggested by the Blak Tuffy are also irrelevant for abdominal protec- tion (Fig 19b) . APPLICATIONS IN STEERING SYSTEM DESIGN Based on the Viscous criterion, the sled and impactor experiments demonstrated that abdominal organ injury was induced within the rapid com- pression phase before the energy absorbing co- lumn began to compress. Since the upper abdomen was interacting with the steering wheel at that time, count erme asure must also be focused on the wheel, and not the column. In contrast, had peak chest compression or spinal acceleration been chosen as the criteria to guide the deve- lopment of a countermeasure, attention could have been focused on column compression charac- teristics. An opportunity to improve abdominal protection would have been missed. Changing the steering wheel characteristics was thus the appropriate countermeasure for abdomin- al injury. Softening the spokes to yield on impact could reduce the velocity of deformation, the abdominal Viscous response, hence the injury risk for the abdomen. However, that same design could concentrate the load on the thorax to an area no bigger than the hub of the wheel, as the wheel plane retreats behind the hub. Such a design could reduce chest protection in the more severe impacts. These understanding, in concert with the knowledge that injury was induced with- in the rapid compression phase, had lead to the introduction of the GM self aligning steering 4.1152</page><page sequence="16">881714 40- Blak Tuffy / 40- Blak Tuffy X // // ^ / / / ' ç z // z / ' z x // v / / J^// x » &lt;?*F/ ® *// § 20- / /F1 § 20- X/f2 LL / U. / / 0 ' 1 1 1 • o ^ ■ ' ' ' o 10 20 o 10 20 Velocity (m/s) Velocity (m/s) Fig 18: Comparison of Peak impact force in a Blak tuffy test over a range of impact velocity for a rigid impact, and impacts with pad- dings optimized for 6.7 m/s (Crush force Fj =8.5 kN) and 10 m/s (Crush force F2 = 16.0 kN) . i 31 Cadaver Abdomen - / Hybrid III - J ~ Side Impact &lt;¿%/ &gt; Frontal Impact ^ &lt;v // e 0 &lt;¿%/ / / w ' // w2 0 ' X ' 6'// * / / X p 6'// / 1 e // Ol. / /c ü &lt;Šřs ^4 &gt; .$/ / / 3 &gt;1- / 0 r 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 4 8 0 4 8 Velocity (m/s) Velocity (m/s) Fig 19: [VC] max for a rigid impact and the Fj and F2 (Fig 15) padded impacts are identical over the range of impact velocity for a frontal impact of the Hybrid III (a) or a side impact of the human abdomen (b) . However, padding optimized at 6.7 m/s for the Hybrid III (Crush force F3 = 2.5 kN) and the human abdomen (Crush force F4 = 1.8 kN) show substantial reduction of [VC] max in the critical range between 1 to 2 m/s. 4.1153</page><page sequence="17">Fig 20: Self Aligning steering wheel which conforms its wheel plane to the torso. The new design was developed based on the torso Viscous response . wheel, which aligns its wheel plane to the torso of an occupant, reducing abdominal injury risks in the initial phase of impact. And the wheel maintains its shape and load transfer to the chest and shoulder in a chest impact (Fig 20) . SIDE IMPACT The human chest and abdomen in a side impact are compliant structures. Unlike the spine of the SID, the human spine deforms readily upon impact along with the rest of the torso (Fig 21) . We examined the efficacy of a soft padding suitable for protection of the human thorax, and tested the padding on the SID (Fig 22a) . We also exa- mined the efficacy of a stiff padding effective in reducing TTI(d) in the SID, and tested the padding against the human thorax (Fig 22b) . Due to the high inertial forces generated by the SID rib mass, the soft padding crushed very early. From then on, rib acceleration in the padded test reversed to that of a rigid impact. TTI(d) was reduced only marginally. However, that same padding was most effective in mitigating human injury within the impact environment where the potential pay off was high (1 m/s &lt; [VC] max &lt; 2 m/s). Based on TTI(d) in a SID test, an engi- neer would choose the stiff pad, which reduces TTI(d) to below 80g over a wide range of impact velocity. Such a stiff pad performed well be- cause it could sustain the high, non-human like, inertial forces generated by the SID thorax. Peak rib acceleration was, therefore, reduced over a wide range of impact velocity. Unfortu- nately, the same pad would have zero benefit over a rigid impact at any velocity for an ac- tual occupant. The NHTSA explained that the SID was designed to be used with TTI(d) as the injury criterion, and within that context, the SID was an adequate ATD. The simulation here demonstrates that the Fig 21 : Deformation of the human spine in a side impact: Unlike the spine of the SID, the human spine is made of vertebrae linked by muscles and tendons, and it deforms freely upon impact . SID/TTI(d) combination might lead to ineffective designs. The claim to biofidelity for the SID was made on the basis of skeletal acceleration or force alone. However, reproducing the peak acceleration at some skeletal locations simply implies that the aggregate response to peak input force at those locations has been repro- duced. Those forces include variable components of whole body acceleration and torso deforma- tion. Furthermore, a non-human like, inertial chest might be tuned to provide similar peak acceleration for a few test conditions by pad- ding the dummy. An injury criterion alludes to a mechanism of injury by its physical meaning. We are concern- ed with the lack of physical basis of TTI, the predecessor of TTI(d).

Pelvic acceleration was found to be the single, strongest correlate with chest injury. When the analysis examined all possible combinations of independent variables within the data set, it found the combination of age. mass, age. pelvic acceleration, and pelvic accelera- tion, rib acceleration to be the best discrimina- tor of injury. That combination misclassif ied only twelve of the forty-one possible cases (29%) within the data set, whereas TTI misclas- sif ied twenty of the forty-seven possible cases (43%) . APPLICATIONS IN SIDE IMPACT Before contemplation of countermeasure designs, it is essential to determine which injury mecha- nisms are pertinent in side crashes. We examin- ed the injury pattern of the drivers in side crashes contained in the MIC files from 1981 to 1985. Both belted and unbelted drivers in left side crashes were included, but ejected drivers were excluded. We particularly examined the relationship between rib fractures and internal injuries of the thoracic and upper abdominal organs contained in the MIC files. As in any accident file, uninjured drivers accounted for the vast majority of the cases (Table 5). Among the drivers who were injured, the fifty- three cases of rib fractures only were the most com- mon. They were mostly minor. There were two fatalities - possibly massively crushed chest, and three other cases of severe injuries (AIS=4) . In eighteen other cases, internal injuries and rib fractures were observed in the MIC Case S 1972 1977 Chevy 55 mph Driver: Male, 47 years, 170 lb, 71 in.

In nine of the eighteen cases , the driver clearly incurred more severe internal injuries than skeletal injuries. There were eight cases of internal injuries with no rib fractures. In one of those eight cases, the driver had a fatal rupture of the heart, but no ribs were broken (Fig 23) . We conclude that flail chest, or even rib fractures, is not a prerequisite for internal injury. Contrary to the hypothesis of Walfisch and Tarriere et al (15) , we found in our studies that the severity of rib fractures were not an indicator of actual internal injuries. However, skeletal trauma remains to be an important indicator of the overall severity of trauma in cadaver tests. The lack of tissue function in cadaver subjects eliminates any patho-physiological trauma response and may also alter soft tissue injury response. The cases of rib fractures alone, or rib frac- tures with minor internal injuries might have been induced by a viscous mechanism, a crushing mechanism, or their combination. The cases of internal injury alone, or internal injuries with minor rib fractures, were typical of injury induced by a viscous mechanism. Safety evalua- tion of a side crash should, therefore, be based on the Viscous criterion, which indicates the potential for internal and skeletal injury from a high velocity impact, and the occupant should be protected concurrently against crushing inju- ry by a compression limit. Since the Viscous criterion and the compression criterion are based on the same chest deflection data, the countermeasures against the two mechanisms of injury are complimentary. As in the case of frontal impact protection, side impact protection can be optimized only after the instant of maximum injury risk is identified. Based on barrier tests using the NHTSA procedure (Fig 24) , the moving barrier impacts the struck car 20 - 30 ms before the door contacts the surrogate. Door velocity at contact is estimated to be 60 - 70 % of the coasting velocity of the barrier. Intrusion of the door into the passenger compartment contin- ues after the peak torso Viscous response. With reference to the struck car, the surrogate will appear to be struck by the door. Those observa- tions of a barrier test suggest that padding can potentially be an effective countermeasure for a given structure. Further stiffening of the side structure may effectively reduce the velocity of door contact on the occupant. However, a sys- tems engineering of the side structure is needed to assure that the occupant does not impact the stiffened structure at a the same severity. Those observations also suggest why injury may not correlate with maximum door intrusion since injury by a viscous mechanism will occur well before maximum door intrusion. Any relationship between maximum door crush and injury is also 60- 2 Striking Barrier I 45" o 30- ' ' 15- Door /' / Struck Car ^^s^Pe^vic^Acceleration J Lower Spinal Acceleration . - &gt;{j ' - - Rib Acceleration ±r v j - Chest Deflection 3 ' / &gt; VA / Ķ /M / - Dynamic Door Crush !q J ' ^ - Viscous Response i i « i « 0 15 30 45 60 75 t (ms) Fig 24: Composite representation of a parked car struck by a NHTSA barrier, a: Velocity of the barrier, the struck car, and the struck door. b: Impact of the pelvis and the rib cage. due to their common link to the overall crash severity, and no cause-and-eff ect relationship exists. Similar misunderstanding of the rela- tionship between steering system deformation and occupant injury was discussed elsewhere (16). 4.1156</page><page sequence="20">881714 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS: 1. Injury is induced in a blunt impact when the Viscous response of the subject exceeds its tolerance . 2. The Viscous response underlies the etiologi- cal injury event, and is highly correlative with injury outcome. 3. A valid injury criterion is most meaningful if it is applied to a biofidelic dummy. 4. Due to the SID's inertial properties, it will not lead to optimal side impact coun- termeasures. Additional development is needed. 5. In a side impact, the occupant needs to be protected against skeletal and internal injury by a high velocity impact and by a slow crushing impact. 6. A well-designed laboratory test should re- present the typical field accident.
