<plain_text><page sequence="1">Building I Dwelling I Dr Fting BY CHARLIE HAILEY Our truck headlights reveal a small section of the fence-blinding white to gray receding to black. The dash clock winks green as I reach to turn off the beams. 9:48 p.m. I don't think I necessarily changed at that precise moment, but in retrospect the numbers are comforting-a cool emerald reduction of the intricacies of our new life. We have set the last picket on our new fence. Moments before, our neighbor across the street stepped out on her front porch and asked squinting if we needed anything or if her outdoor lights might help. The next day we will stand with her in the street admiring our work and listening to her sing the completion of our fence-it's just dahling, oh y' all, now look. From a temporary woodshop on the front porch, my wife and I have worked within early spring's lengthening days for two weeks between university classes. Four hundred and fifty-three pickets attached to horizontal two by four rails line two hundred and fifty-six feet-just over half of the property's perimeter. That last picket marks the conclusion of setting forty-two posts; cutting, priming, and painting the wood components; and assembling all of the elements with thousands of deck screws and innumerable ten-penny galvanized nails. What remains in my mind however is a more subtle reading of the picket fence, one that circumscribes a tenuous condition-not unlike what the English philosopher John Ruskin has called "nothing but process." The question of how do you build bleeds into why do you dwell and that in turn becomes when do you leave and when should you stay. .</page><page sequence="2">Building /Dwelling /Drifting 689 i-Building Superstition rules the life of the cracker; hunting or fishing or planting-almost everything he undertakes-is done according to accepted formula. He would no more set fence posts in the light of the moon than he would plant potatoes or other crops that mature underground. -Federal Writers' Project, Florida: A Guide to the Southernmost State (1939). Maybe the picket fence came out of a need to create something obsessively new to surround our century-old dying house like a finely wrought police tape. For us, the fence's scenographic permanence indicated the recurring paradox of our daily attempts at historic resuscitation (from banal repair of iron pipe fittings to heroic preservation of counterweighted windows). And we hoped that the pickets' sheer whiteness might signify our good intentions and forecast to our adopted community the hidden but well intended renovation. This sequence of thoughts occupied me as I fastened the last horizontal rail at the corner of our property. The pickets were next, and in the background I could see the white opalescent boards leaning against the porch, their sixteen- foot lengths exaggerating the verticality of the five pickets held within each board. At a more pragmatic level, I had realized earlier that the fabrication of the fence was a possible excuse to buy the new compound miter saw-the money we saved building our own fence compensating easily for the tool's price. My wife and I were also trying to erect a permanent enclosure as quickly as possible to open up the frontier of our backyard for our three dogs, who could then redirect the colonizing efforts of the neighborhood's stray cat population. But these initial reasons for constructing the fence began to blur as the process of building played out, because for me built works collect meaning in direct proportion to the time and care lavished in their production. In this way, building, thinking, and now writing define the chronicle of the fence through an inward process of reflection. With each component, I build the story of the fence, which is both a small story and a grand narrative. For me, one aspect of building has always been this kind of accumulation. Building is also about community-a constructive conversation that includes but also transcends material in a constant negotiation between the unforgiving and the pliable. That is to say that building</page><page sequence="3">690 The Antioch Review always occurs in a milieu, a place between internal and external influences. We were outsiders moving into the locality of a small Southern town; and as it turned out, we did not need to introduce ourselves to the residents of the town of Madison, our newly adopted home, because the act of constructing the fence served as an unwitting overture, an involuntary bridge, to members of the community. At this public-private chiasma, building becomes a vulnerable condition. Between public scrutiny and private doubt. In construction, the incom- plete skeletal frame represents a baring, if not of metaphorical organs, then of the vital processes of existence. We have to build, just as we eat, love, and sleep. Making a fence positions you at the frontier of your semi-private life where public and private waves form eddies of conversation and whorls of silence-often blending these disparate tendencies. Paradoxically, by crafting a fence, we actually became closer to our neighbors and our community. Riding by as he did every day with his two dogs in the back of his truck, our neighbor concluded conversation on the weather and the difficulties of renovation projects with a final comment as he gestured to our fence-"appreciate ya." We met an elderly neighbor who complained that his wife was "bird- dogging" him and following him all around town. She drove by and waved after he had ambled into town. On his return later in the day, he said that he had made peace with God and that if it were his time to go he was ready-"I have worked hard every day of my life, and I told the minister I didn't want to go if there was no work for me up there. He told me the angels'll have plenty for me to do." Tears welled in his eyes. There was also the guy called Cowboy who lives two doors down and who told us that we had made a "big mistake" buying the house and his builder-friend had determined that the house was "falling down and can't be saved." As we neared completion of the fence, a woman jumped out of her idling Oldsmobile to ask us, "Where can I get me one of those?" Most visits were opportunities for introductions and discus- sions about who lives in the town, where we go to school, or where we're from. Sometimes we received business cards or religious pam- phlets, but most people showed a genuine interest in our project out where town space meets the domain of the self. If one circumstance of building a fence is this condition of exposure within the public eye, then its inverse could be an equally conditional allowance for anonymity. Just as the unfinished building project represents an open invitation (think of the open stud walls of houses under construction you have walked through), the incomplete structure</page><page sequence="4">Building /Dwelling /Drifting 691 permits an anonymous condition of pre-ownership bluffing the distinc- tion of owner, builder, and construction. I was working as a carpenter in Seaside, Florida, after graduating from college; David, a local craftsman in his fifties, was on my crew. Smiling through his thick graying beard shaded under a fishing hat, he would warn you not to fall off the roof and break your Christmas presents. He had lived his entire life in Black Creek fish camp less than ten miles from Seaside, and this was his second day building one of the town's famed picket fences. Usually constrained by his tight-fitting airman's jacket, David was, as a rule, slow on the job, but today it was because of the Italian models. With its world-renowned beaches and pastel architectural palette, Seaside had become the backdrop for photo-shoots by glitzy fashion magazines. As the swimsuit models flowed across the white sand paths and pink alleyways no more than ten feet away, David must have been just beyond the photographic frame, or maybe he was later cropped out back in some Milanese studio, because working on the picket fence in that forgettable and obscure middle ground, David somehow blended in and avoided the scrutiny that had halted other construction deemed too loud or too distracting-leaving the rest of the distant crew to ogle at an image captured in the myopic lens of a builder's level and wonder at their co-worker's luck. As a result of living in the Seaside area and my experiences there, the building of our picket fence is ideologically charged. In 1991 and 1992, I had worked in this new town at the epicenter of what is affectionately called the Redneck Riviera. Eschewing the region's grittier characteristics, the neotraditionalist coastal resort town was on the cusp of its ascendancy as the figurehead of Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk and Andres Duany's version of New Urbanism. Since its 1990 nomi- nation by Time magazine as "Best of the Decade" in design, Seaside has devolved into the movement's beleaguered poster child-its seasonal population far exceeding the number of permanent residents and undermining its "real town" designation. Seaside's tourist brochure ironically incorporates a utopic community of builders into its sell: "As a town, Seaside is being built by people who want to share in its vision, and many of them make their cottages available so you can enjoy this way of life." That was Seaside's original intention-to have housing for all socio-economic levels, including homes for those who actually built and maintained the town, but economic determinism reared its single- minded head and as the town's fame grew, so did its property values. Today the town's physical evolution can be read as a valorizing</page><page sequence="5">692 The Antioch Review histogram of taste, with the rise of property value registering in the increased dwelling size from the development's eastem end to its western edge, from cottage to mansion, from the scaled to the scaleless. My wife and I lived in a trailer park fifteen minutes down the road like most of the other workers and their families. Those early years were heady times, and the construction of picket fences registered many of the ironies of the town's fabrication. Contractors' woodshops were filled with intricately cut, planed, and joined fragments of unassembled fences-designs that pushed the limits of wood construction in order to simulate wrought iron tracery and to satisfy the planners' mandate that no two of the compulsory fences could be the same. But the sweet smell of pressure-treated sawdust could not hide the irony of the techniques or the forms that resulted from them, and the salt spray would eventu- ally wreak havoc on the new-growth #2 grade softwood of these pattern-book inspired creations protected only by layers of paint. It was said that the colors used for the houses were also mandated, in this case, by the developer's wife, known among the builders as the Queen of Color. One day as we passed rafters up for a cupola topping one of the houses, Svein, a master carpenter from Norway, stopped and matter-of- factly stated that when the bulk of the construction was done in Seaside he would become a painter-"You could retire on that-maintaining these houses, painting them over and over, that's money." Building is, in itself, an event. In its repetition, the serial and differential aspects of building become intertwined. Thinking about and making our picket fence, we participated in this type of woven event, which resulted not only in a blurring of public life with private existence but also in a rhetorical revisiting of Seaside's presence within this region of northern Florida. Thus did the fence's physical presence and its image converge in a process of construction that came to operate reflexively-the way the act of building reifies our existence. What Martin Heidegger has called dasein, the manifold of being. Registered in the building of the fence, two components of this convergence were corporeality and place. As a result, building becomes an accumulation: materially in terms of constructing and immaterially with respect to construing. This dialogic relationship played out in the fabrication, arrangement, and assemblage of the fence; anthropomorphism became the hinge between constructing and construing. When we make things, whispers of memory drift over exigencies of the present. Repeated cuts to fabricate the pickets were a mode of reflection. Across each picket's fifty-five degree cut, nine hundred and six in all, we understood,</page><page sequence="6">Building / Dwelling / Drifting 693 interpreted, and translated our bodies' role in the construction. The line of pickets was set at the height of my hip. When we realized that the gap between two pickets was the width of three fingers, we no longer needed the spacer block, and the distance from the picket's point to the top of the rail was my palm's width. Our system of assembling the pickets became a paired dance. Bodily memory fused with the rhythm of the pickets. Instrumentalizing the body served to bridge the specific- ity of the fence's construction and the ephemerality of our thinking about our regional situation, the qualities of place that both extended from and enfolded us. It makes sense that the words construct and construe share Latin derivations from a root meaning "to pile up together." Both syntactic operations occur in an event's "taking place," and their intersection marks the beginnings of art. Thus, we "pile up" and collect both bodily memory and remembrances of place and attempt to bring them "together" in an assemblage that is sensitive to the multiplicities of context. Following the work of Marco Frascari, it is my understanding that, as an anthropomorphic synthesis of construction and the act of construing, architecture seeks to harmonize the art of building with the art of living. ii-Dwelling ... I tell myself that a white picket fence would interfere with the feeling one has inside the house of being a part of the grove; that a new fence would mean tearing out the coral honeysuckle vines that cling passionately to the old wire. But the real objection is that an elegant fence would bring to the Creek a wanton orderliness that is out of place. -Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings, Cross Creek. The second night of our life confined by pickets I lay awake wondering what it really meant. Notions of home, domesticity, and permanence formed like beads of sweat on burning skin. You're an architect, you could have come up with a better solution, a less overt symbol, a better design for the fence. But now in retrospect it wasn't the picturesque implications of a "wanton orderliness" that haunted me. Nor was it an issue of potential misinterpretations of the subtle contextuality we had elicited from other fences in the town. (Even though, as it turned out,</page><page sequence="7">694 The Antioch Review we alienated our neighbors two blocks away whose existing picket fence informed aspects of our own fence design.) Instead, those thoughts before sleep succeeded by slight morning terror the next day were symptoms of a larger concern dealing with a newfound placefulness-a whitewashed inveteracy with which we had surrounded ourselves, after years of travel and planned impermanence, playing the roles of the itinerant student and carpenter. Over a period of seven years, we had inhabited fourteen abodes within eleven different towns from New Jersey to California. Our shelters had ranged from college dorm to inner-city house, from single-wide mobile home to kiakia hut in the Central Pacific, from spacious A-frame to a ten-foot Air Stream trailer called "Bambi." This notion of fixity was not something we had really contemplated before. "Every woman's dream is a white picket fence," our neighbor stated as she nodded over her shoulder at her chain link down the road, coyly eyeing our day's labors in the March sun. Was this an allusion to the intricacies of Southern gentility that I had somehow missed by avoiding so many times the threats from girlfriends, grandmothers, and acquaintances of my youth to watch Gone with the Wind? Did the fence articulate and recover a Southern domesticity that had been "lost" in the expansions and developments of the New South? Domestication, or in this case its representation, can provide the foothold for dwelling and the accommodation of tradition. And if you think about its Old English roots in dwellan, to dwell is really to delay. For our neighbor' s "every- woman," perhaps a picket fence serves to defer a coming to terms with the entanglements of the present, much less the possibilities of the future. Within the Southern tradition of domesticity, the appropriation of the picket fence' s symbolization results in an image that allows for the deferral of thinking about the meaning behind the representation. From the experience of building the fence, I have inferred that the picket fence often has not only a soporific effect but also often induces an oneiric reverie. The fence stands for all that is sentimental about dwelling in a small Southern town. Up to this point, romance for my wife and me was built around travel rather than the domestic symbolism of a picket fence. But we had set each fencepost in two feet of concrete; the pickets were not going anywhere. Melanie had traveled across her homeland of New Zealand, throughout India and Nepal; we had first met in the shadow of the Athenian Acropolis, taken the Orient Express from Istanbul to Vienna, been tossed off the train in Sofia, and later traveled to the Pacific nation</page><page sequence="8">Building / Dwelling /Drifting 695 of Kiribati with her mother and father who now live in Canada. Except when they start to decay, pickets are static. The ninety-year-old lady down the street remembers a picket fence along our very stretch of sidewalk. In her youth she would skate alongside with a stick and lose herself in the staccato rhythm. If I could somehow run alongside the fence at the level of the pickets, I think I could simulate this dyna- mism-visually rather than aurally. The alternation between solid- void-solid-void would be enough for a sense of movement, an episodic passage. If I then were to combine that sound from my neighbor's childhood with this visual cinematic flow, I think I could recover the ride on the train moments before our dusky bleary-eyed arrival in Vienna. What is the origin of the picket fence in America and how does that factor into a discussion of place, location, and the related act of dwelling? Some variations of the picket fence arise from an interpreta- tion of decorative wrought iron fences. Architectural pattern books from England portrayed ornamental ironwork that was too expensive and for the most part unavailable until the 1860's when the manufacture of cast iron became widespread in the United States. These wood adaptations of ironwork are often categorized within a picket fence typology. Such a designation however ignores the specific denotations of the term "picket." The uncomplicated, functional, and rhythmic beauty of a fence as a series of pickets, stakes nailed or screwed to a horizontal armature, results in the poetic reduction of a boundary to its essence. Picket fences, like ours with angled or "dog-eared" cuts at the top, originated with the colonists, who fabricated protective walls out of adjacent vertical timbers driven into the ground and sharpened at the top to an excruciating point. As a testimony to its expediency, the colonists shared this basic defensive method with the American Indi- ans. Depending on the scale of the barrier, the terms stockade and palisade also designate a series of pointed stakes that, though taller than typical pickets, serve to exclude danger and engender safety. In a new world, a foreign world, we often resort to defining the "other" as a potential hazard to our safety, to our identity. In palisade is lodged the wordpale, which metonymically identifies a picket, a component of the larger assemblage. But the Pale was also the early medieval dominion of the English in Ireland, and the phrase "beyond the pale" refers notjust to that which is outside the pickets but alludes to what is deemed unacceptable, even unreasonable, in a situation that is irrevocable. With this in mind, it seems to me that the structural and semantic origins of</page><page sequence="9">696 The Antioch Review the picket do not at all justify erecting a picket fence in a small Southern town. I remember looking back at an entry in my sketchbook marked 1/ 16/00, about a month before we began building the fence-"picket fence: what is its origin? . . . seems to fit real, small town that is a working village without self-consciousness-contradicting the self- referentiality that infects Seaside and its code." I was thinking that by attempting to simulate the home-like quality of living in small-town America, Seaside's Architectural and Urban Codes were actually manufacturing a finely tuned (though cursory) diversity-hermetically packaged for the townspeople's enjoyment. An image of home is consequently never far from the controlling grasp of the town planners and their re-centering of the traditional notion of identity-a reductive interpretation of Middle American identity. Interestingly, it is the picket fence that is most easily controlled and most easily consumed by a ravenous Middle America. Seaside's Architectural Code reads: "White painted wood picket fences are required at the street front and path front property lines ... Individual fence patterns shall not replicate another on the same street .... White paint shall be selected from one of the following manufacturers' stock numbers: Benjamin Moore 103 and 105; Sherwin-Williams 107-8070; Pittsburgh 7245,6-650...." We were re-building Disney, what the American people wanted, what the white nouveau riche Southern gentry wanted and would get whether it was here or somewhere else within a day's driving distance of the conurbations of Atlanta, Birmingham, or Memphis. I was not surprised when I learned that venerable Walt Disney himself had originally looked at land held by Edward Ball in Florida's Panhandle. I guess it was inevitable that Disney would get here. Built between 1903 and 1906 before Disney or Ball got here, the house at 200 Livingston Street, three blocks from Madison's court- house and seven miles from Interstate 10's 36th exit, was our first. We live on its second floor above the gutted remains of our renovation-in- progress on the first floor, and its restoration dominates our life. On the way to the closing, we talked about how wonderful it would be to pull together all of our possessions spread out over three states, two countries, and innumerable garages and sheds; and in my own desire to enter a phase of self-governed tenancy outside of a landlord's watchful eye, I think I had forgotten that home and dwelling are two different conditions. Our rationalization of the picket fence's construction fell somewhere within a gray area of linguistic tracery between these two</page><page sequence="10">Building / Dwelling /Drifting 697 notions. A week and a half after moving in, my wife's first entry in a journal kept to register the vagaries of home-ownership reads "New house. First house. Brokendown house. Old house. House on a corner. House whose insides have been disturbed.... House near the center of Madison, home of the Four Freedoms.... Home for seven of us, at least for the next several years." House, home, dwelling. Landscape archi- tect J.B. Jackson echoes this well-known difference when he explains home as an idea or essential understanding of a place and dwelling (with its origins in "delaying") as a temporary construct, in much the same way that abiding is rooted in the term abode. What often remains obscure is found in the slippage between notions of a physical and psychological home; what is homely and what is unhomely? Perhaps this is not the place for a Freudian analysis of unheimlich and the uncanny, but it does beg the question-was our fence a fetish to replace the disturbed interior of our house? Some might say the fence arose out of our desire to live for once outside the sublimity of a nomadic life. We had lived in so many houses that they all blended together into an uncanny assemblage, the individual pieces of which might direct us to a non-existent bathroom at the end of the hall or to a long forsaken clothes dresser imagined at the end of the bed. The suitability of such retrospective analysis is often suspect; and I think at the time we simply needed a break from such an itinerant life, our dogs needed an enclosed area to chase our cats, and it was time to let our minds instead of our bodies drift. iii-Drifting One time there was a picket fence with space to gaze from hence to thence. An architect who saw this sight approached it suddenly one night, removed the spaces from the fence and built of them a residence. -Christian Morgenstern, "Der Lattenzaun" (The Picket Fence), translated by Max Knight.</page><page sequence="11">698 The Antioch Review Can we think of "drift" as an active verb? To drift, like the French Situationists who departed on what they called a derive (literally "drifting"). Their intentioned wanderings sought to counter the banalities of the quotidian by placing themselves in slightly disorienting circumstances. That was the situation. Getting lost in your own city or having the surreal experience of being the foreigner-at-home is what Guy Debord and the other Situationists sought. Their physical and mental movement was not entirely random; it was a deliberate drifting, a transformative activity of forgetting and discovering. Memory is the lining of forgetting. Loaded as it has become with meaning, for me the fence symbolizes a passage, a crossing. Like the Situationists, we start out by being familiar with everything around us; and then, often methodically, we forget everything we have learned. Thinking about the fence is a device for my own process of remembering and forgetting across the folds of a crumpled time. It is as though I inhabit the space of the fence. Idiomatically, I don't feel so much as if I'm "on the fence"; perhaps it's more like I' m "in the fence." At that precarious moment of becoming- whether departure or arrival, I'm not sure. Along such a threshold, I could continue to camp out and not really be in one static place. Against permanence. You see, the fence surrounds and circumscribes (even delimits) my current dilemma: how to be at peace in that transition between itinerancy and domesticity, between the vagabond and the respectable, between the world and small-town Madison. The fence has come to represent all that is the fixity of our first house. I was aware that my wife's dilemma was further complicated by an international sensi- bility-a multinational status being compromised by the apparent insularity of the regimented, neurotic sameness of the pickets. With my own Southern birthright, landing behind a row of pickets in a small cotton town in the Florida Panhandle wouldn't seem too implausible; I guess I could have ended up in an Atlanta suburb where the PVC pickets weren't the only repeated element. Perhaps that was it-we both felt trapped, after years of peregrination, by having finally achieved what might be called the American Dream. But the practice of dreaming is so closely linked to drifting. I think of the contemporary American frontier as a mental landscape in which these conditions of dreaming, drifting, and dwelling can begin to coexist. Looking back at my sketchbook over the dated entries leading up to the start of fence construction, I'm struck by a section looking ahead to what it might be like to sit in our unmanicured backyard,</page><page sequence="12">Building /Dwelling/Drifting 699 behind a fence. On January 18, 1 wrote, "Overgrown backyard actually creates a 'frontier'-catch glimpses of the edge (boundary) through breaks in the thicket." Sounding the unknown means sending a line out and pulling it in across a vertiginous membrane. When knowledge is framed by naivete, or by nostalgia-the weight doesn't go far enough and we are left wondering what reach its plumb might have. The Greeks knew this, and it's Heidegger again who transmits this idea-bound- aries aren't where something ceases; instead they are the edges at which something begins its "unfolding." Our fence to me really symbolizes transmission. Not just holding something safely inside-a sort of phenomenological greenhouse effect, but more like a porous screen providing both net and frame through, around, and over which we view the world. A fence designates "home" and "dwelling" to those on either side of its lineaments and, in doing so, paradoxically provides a physical and metaphorical "ground" by which we can project our own frontiers (and illusions)-an extension of identity. Heidegger propi- tiously interrelates the triumvirate of building, dwelling, and think- ing-the concepts of each rely on those of the other two for the framing of their definitions. In an alienating modernity, he points out that we must constantly learn to dwell and that thinking about our inherent homelessness yields the essence of dwelling-an idea closely linked to what he meant by dasein-being. But I think the French thinkers of the 1 960s enhanced this insight when they translated dasein as "human reality"-implying more than a drive to a metaphysical essence by including the quotidian experience of life in their appropriation of the term. As we are increasingly enmeshed in an undeniable globality, I think we must learn to drift and to replace essences with allowances for indeterminacy-a rethinking of what we are not, learning tactics rather than strategies. It is in this mode of interpretation, of translation, that I have found a correspondence between constructing and construing-a metaphor for drifting that combines the practices of building and dwelling. Misconstruing the idea of place in a controlled framework, New Urbanism, as in the example of Seaside, collects rather than disperses-a fixity that naively tries to control the world in a fist rather than an open grasping. The code of New Urbanism (both implied and written) results in a political freezing, an appropriation and even commodification of a domestic life defined by control and closure rather than an unfolding, an efflorescing. It's not the picket fence that' s problematic; it's the image of the fence not just in the bastard villages</page><page sequence="13">700 The Antioch Review spawned from Seaside and coughed up along the Gulf of Mexico's coast, but also in the idea of the picket fence as all that is good, wholesome, and safe in America. Thinking about home, Bell Hooks maps a possible outlet for us to take as we stubbornly rest on this static domestic ideology. She writes that home is "that place which enables and promotes ever-changing perspectives, a place where one discovers new ways of seeing reality, frontiers of difference." That to me is the rich paradox of the fence: that by delimiting a boundary I was actually creating a contested middle ground by which to question my own thoughts about place and identity and to open up a multivalent frontier for a lifetime of purposeful drifting.</page></plain_text>
