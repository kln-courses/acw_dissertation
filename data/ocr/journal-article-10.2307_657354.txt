<plain_text><page sequence="1">263 Rethinking reification HANNA FENICHEL PITKIN Department of Political Science, University of California, Berkeley "Alas," said the mouse, "the world is growing smaller every day. At the beginning it was so big that I was afraid, I kept running and running, and I was glad when at last I saw walls far away to the right and left, but these long walls have narrowed so quickly that I am in the last chamber already, and there in the corner stands the trap that I must run into." "You only need to change your direction," said the cat, and ate it up. Franz Kafka, "A Little Fable"1 Kafka's nightmarish fable dwells in the same terrain of experience as the concept of reification. Both engage the mystery of how we, with our enormous scientific sophistication and technical capability have come to be so helplessly trapped by our own activity. Or should one say, have come to feel so helplessly trapped? Or to be trapped because we feel trapped? "Reification" is not a household word. Its investigation is complex and somewhat tedious, of interest only to specialists. If it nevertheless mat- ters, that is because of these larger and urgent issues. Ultimately the question is, are we going to blow up the world? Must we? Like other specialists, I used to suppose that I knew what reification is. Thus, in a recent publication I wrote, without having given the matter much thought, ".. . reification: a coming to take for granted as 'given' and in- evitable what in fact is the product of human action."2 Since then I have begun to give it some thought, with the result that I am no longer sure what reification is, or what I mean by "reification."

It derives from the Latin res, a noun of broad signification, variously translatable into English as "thing," "object," "matter," "concern," "affair," "business," "proper- ty," "case (in law)." To reify is to turn something into a res. But there the difficulties begin. What sort of something? And how? In puzzling out answers to these questions, I hope to do more than mere- ly share my confusion with others. In the process of discovering the in- ternal incoherencies of this obscure concept, one can learn a good deal about the social and political reality in which we live, about our ways of understanding that reality and ourselves, our powers and our helpless- ness. One learns what of importance the concept of reification is meant to address, and how it fails. Ultimately I shall argue that this concept, intended to diagnose our self-entrapment and thereby to empower us, fails because it suppresses instead of clarifying the real political prob- lems involved in effective public action. The discussion begins with Lukacs and Marx, moves on to sociology and, briefly, to the dictionary, and ends up with politics, theory, and ourselves. Reification in Lukacs Reification has received the greatest attention in Marxist thought, so that is the place to begin. But, with the exception of one casual passage, Marx himself never used the word; nor did Hegel.3 It was introduced into Marxism by Georg Lukaics's seminal essay, "Reification and the Con- sciousness of the Proletariat."4 Actually, Lukacs used the German word "Verdinglichung," which might more literally be translated into English as "thingification" (from Ding, thing). But the latinate word was availa- ble in English, and one should not cavil at the translator's decision to use it. Res is close enough in meaning to both Ding and thing. Though Marx scarcely used the term, Lukacs claims that the idea of reification is central to his thought. And Marx certainly did use a num- ber of terms in the same general conceptual region, such as "objectifica- tion," "estrangement," "alienation," "ideology," "mystification," and "fetishism." There is also what Engels - but not Marx - called "false consciousness."5 Lukacs concentrates on fetishism, claiming that the section near the beginning of Capital on the fetishism of commodities is the key to the book and to all of Marx's work, because "the riddle of commodity-structure... [is] the central, structural problem of capitalist society in all its aspects," and thus, "the necessary and immediate reality</page><page sequence="3">265 of every person living under capitalism."6 Lukacs equates commodity fetishism in this broad sense with reification, as indicated for instance by the title of the section in which he discusses it.7 Its essence, he says, is that a relationship among people is given the character of a thing and thus acquires a "phantom objectivity," whose strict, apparently altogether closed and rational autonomy conceals every trace of its fundamental nature: the rela- tionship among people.8 A relationship among people is regarded as a res.9 This implies, second, that something essential is concealed, is misapprehended as phantom. And this, in turn, implies further that human capacities remain un- realized; something actually within human power appears to be auto- nomous and to exercise power over people. What is primarily reified in commodity fetishism, according to Lukacs, is human productive labor or work (Arbeit).10 People's productive activity is real, "concrete," "definite," and it requires real working relationships. In commodity fetishism, those who do this work understand it and themselves only in distorted or "fantastic" form.1 They understand their own ac- tivity and power only as concealed in its material products, and under- stand those products only as commodities, subject to the impersonal forces of the market - inflation, depression, the law of supply and de- mand, and so on. Consequently the producers experience themselves as subject to such impersonal forces, powerless. But in advanced capital- ism, Lukacs argues, such fetishism extends beyond factory workers and bourgeois political economists into all aspects of everyone's life: people lose awareness of their capacity for agency. What is most important here, Lukacs says, is that in reification, "people's own activity, their own labor confronts them as something objective, independent of them, dominat- ing them through an autonomy alien to human beings."12 Reification, then, is a misapprehension of the world, an "ideological phenomenon," in which reality is "falsified" or hidden under a decep- tive "covering" (or "husk") that must be uncovered.13 Lukacs says that "the basic methodological thought" underlying Capital is the undoing of this reification, "the reconversion of economic objects from things back into concrete human relationships" that are capable of being trans- formed by human choice and action.14 Yet this is not the whole of Lukacs's concept. Reification cannot be simply a misapprehension of reality, for commodities and the market and its laws are "by no means merely forms of thought." Rather, "they are the forms in which contemporary bourgeois society is objectified," and their constraint is real.15 As capitalism develops,</page><page sequence="4">266 objectively ... a world of finished objects and of relationships among things comes into being (the world of commodities and their movement on the mar- ket), whose laws are gradually discovered by human beings but nevertheless confront them as inexorable, independently functioning powers.16 This world and its power are no phantoms, which is why the abolition of capitalism "cannot be a mere movement of thought, but must attain a practical abolition [Aufhebung] of its forms as life forms of socie- ty." 17 Evidently, then, the misapprehension of human relationship as res is only one side of Lukacs's reification, the other being the development of the real, functioning world of market capitalism. In a way, this is not sur- prising, because in Marxism social reality and its ideological representa- tion do, indeed, correspond, though in a distorted or inverted manner. Lukacs says explicitly that "the reification process of work itself and also that of the worker's consciousness progress" together.18 But what does "reification" mean at this point, and how are its two sides - if that's the right word - related? If it means misapprehending something as res, how can the actual development of market capitalism be reification? And if commodities and the market are not phantoms but have real pow- er, then how is perceiving them as real and powerful a misapprehension? Seeking answers to these puzzles, one is drawn to certain passages where Lukacs explicitly says that reification has two sides, one of them "objec- tive" and the other "subjective." But these passages are cryptic indeed, and turn out to be no help. The "fetish character" of commodities, one of these passages says, is both an "objectivity-form [form of objectivity? form in objectivity? Gegenstindlichkeitsform]" and a "manner of conduct [attitude?] of a subject [that is, of a person: Subjektsverhalten]." The latter "cor- responds to" the former.19 A second passage adds that when, in reifica- tion, people's own activity confronts them as an independent power, "this happens in both an objective and a subjective respect [regard]."20 The objective respect is the passage already cited, about the coming into being of a real world of commodities and market. The subjective respect seems to be that subjects - that is, persons - and their characteristic person-like activity become commodified too, are in fact bought and sold on the market. These passages, then, distinguish the objective side of reification not from reification as misapprehension of reality, but from people's real manner of conduct or their real commodification. So they do not help answer our questions.21</page><page sequence="5">267 As if all this were not confusing enough, Lukacs also sometimes men- tions a "reified mind," "reified consciousness," or "reified structure of consciousness" as characteristic of modern capitalism.22 In context, the passages clearly mean the sort of mind that tends to reify, to misappre- hend relationship as res. But Lukacs does not call it a reifying conscious- ness.23 His choice of verb form reveals his assumption - perfectly nor- mal in Marxism - that each socio-economic formation determines characteristic forms of consciousness. But reification characterizes capitalism, so Lukacs must be implying that this process is distinctive in capitalism, deserving a distinctive name. Clearly the word here cannot mean taking a relationship for a res, or any of the other senses of the word discussed so far. There are thus at least five aspects of Lukacs's concept of reification: 1) the misapprehension of relationship as res; 2) the coming into being of the capitalist world of commodities and a market whose laws have inex- orable power; 3) the manner of conduct of persons that "correspond to" 2); 4) the commodification of persons and of their characteristically hu- man activity; and 5) the forming of the kind of mind that tends to 1). Reification seems to mean something different in each of these aspects. Some of the meanings are relatively close to others and compatible with them, but some seem downright inconsistent, and with some it remains unclear why they should be called "reification" at all. Lukacs and Marx: Reification and objectification Was Lukacs merely confused? He himself later so maintained. In 1933, under pressure from the Communist Party, Lukacs recanted some of the views expressed in the essay. Then, toward the end of his life and under a less restrictive regime, he reviewed the whole matter again, in what be- came the preface to a collection including the original essay.24 At issue generally in the recantation was whether Lukacs had reintroduced Hegelian idealism into Marxian thought. Specifically with respect to reification, Lukacs judged in retrospect that he had confused it with both what Marx called objectification and what Marx and Hegel called estrangement (Entfremdung, sometimes, but not always, translated as al- ienation).25 The latter confusion Lukacs treats as a minor sin, because the terms are closely related, though "neither socially nor conceptually identical."26 But confusing reification with Marx's objectification he thinks more serious. For it suggests that after the communist revolution, work and the need to produce our livelihood will vanish along with class</page><page sequence="6">268 exploitation, as all opposition between mind and matter proves illuso- ry.27 That is indeed a Hegelian rather than a Marxist idea, and surely not what Lukacs intended. Even in retrospect, however, Lukacs never abandoned the idea of reifica- tion. Perhaps, then, his real meaning would emerge if one could undo his youthful confusion and substract away Marxian objectification. What would this entail? Human beings are distinguished from other animals, Marx says, by the fact that we work on the physical world to produce what we need to live; and we do so not in invariant, instinctually prescribed ways, as bees build hives and birds build nests, but creatively, inventively. "Free, conscious activity is the species character of human beings."28 Because work is our natural form of self-expression, we work even beyond the press of neces- sity, so that some of what we produce is not immediately consumed. Among the lasting objects that humans produce, the most important are tools and other means of production, for they become part of the work environment for later human beings, and so condition the species. This is what Marx calls objectification. Etymologically speaking, one might be tempted to call it a kind of reifi- cation, in the relatively literal sense that human beings are the artificers, the res-making species. Hannah Arendt - though surely no Marxist - uses the word in precisely this way. Reification, she says, means "fabrica- tion, the work of homo faber."29 A carpenter, for example, makes a ta- ble. Of course, he does not create that res out of nothing; he uses objects and materials that already existed. What the carpenter reifies, according to Arendt, is not his materials, which were already res, but his idea of a table, his intention, his "mental image."30 Animals and even plants transform physical objects. What makes the transformation of wood into a table an instance of reification rather than some natural process of growth or decay is the involvement of intentional human activity. Reification is the realization in the physical world of a human inten- tion.31 Manifested in the physical world, such reification is by no means the highest faculty for Arendt. While superior to labor - the producing and consuming of what is necessary to sustain life - it is inferior to action, which alters not physical objects but human relationships. Marx, howev- er, saw the latter as an inseparable correlate of material production, so that in working on the world we produce far more than objects. People</page><page sequence="7">269 produce their means of production, but they also produce new forms of social organization to suit those means of production, new forms of character and symbolic expression to suit the new social forms and tools. Human beings are shaped by the conditions in which they must produce in order to live, but they themselves produce some of those conditions. In short, the human species produces technology, science, art, morality, civilization, itself.32 For Marx, this process is (dialectically) cumulative. In developed capital- ism, the environment in which people must produce their livelihood is highly artificial, with an enormously complex technology and division of labor. We are almost entirely independent of raw nature, particularly compared to primitive hunter-gatherers or agricultural societies. And yet, in a way, we are more dependent than any previous society, though less aware of our dependencies. The residents of, say, Manhattan would be more helpless if their water-supply failed, if food deliveries into the city stopped, if money ceased to function as legal tender, than a primitive tribe facing any but the most cataclysmic natural disaster. We are more dependent - but not on nature. We are dependent on our humanly made and sustained environment, on each other. More and more, our problems are of our own making. Now, if such self-fashioning of the human species is what Marx meant by objectification, how might the young Lukacs have confused it with what he otherwise meant by reification? Arendt shows how something like Marxian objectification might be called reification, in the literal sense of res-making. Did some such idea confuse Lukacs, mixing the real production of objects and relationships into his concept of reification as misapprehension? The former would then become the objective side of his concept. It is tempting to think so, for then undoing Lukacs's confu- sion would require only subtracting away objective reification, thereby removing the vexing puzzle of how one can misapprehend as objective what is in fact objective. Unfortunately, this won't do. For one thing, Lukacs's objective reifica- tion is supposed to end with capitalism, while Marxian objectification of course continues triumphant. The real world of capitalism is at best one product of, not the equivalent of, Marxian objectification.33 But perhaps that discrepancy was part of Lukacs's confusion. More trouble- some is the fact that even if he no longer called the market and com- modities objective reification, Lukacs would still want to insist that they and their power are objectively real. So the puzzle would remain.</page><page sequence="8">270 No, despite Lukacs own retrospective judgment, the difficulties encoun- tered in his concept of reification do not result from his having been somehow untrue to Marx. They originate, or at least have close parallels, in Marx's own thought.34 For though Marx uses terms like "mystifica- tion" and "fetishism" that imply a misapprehension of reality, to be criticized as Feuerbach criticized religious belief, he also stresses how his work differs from Feuerbach's, and how the critique of political econo- my differs from that of religion, in just this way: gods are unreal but the market is not. So Marx seems as deeply committed as Lukacs simultane- ously to both the real power and the delusional nature of commodity structure.35 But in Marx the apparent paradox is easier to investigate. If commodities and the market exist objectively and have actual power to constrain our lives, what does Marx think is fetishized or mystified by bourgeois political economists? Marx says the mystification lies in their taking their concepts and categories as timeless and universal, rath- er than characteristic specifically of capitalism. The misapprehension is not that commodities and the market exist objectively or that they have power, but that they will and must always exist, that they cannot be changed, that we cannot change them. To the bourgeois political economist, Marx says, his concepts and formulae appear "as much a self-evident necessity imposed by nature as productive labor itself."36 Taking commodity exchange to be eternal is a misapprehension. Taking it to be unchangeable by human action becomes a misapprehension at some specific time in history, when the capitalist economy is sufficiently developed to make a successful communist revolution possible. Before that time, ending capitalism is not yet within human power, so seeing it as humanly unchangeable is simple realism.37 Perhaps, then, the misapprehension involved in Lukacs's primary sense of reification is like that in Marx's fetishism: not the reality of commodi- ty structure nor its power, but its eternal inevitability. That does not fully explain Lukacs's reification, however, both because mistaking something changeable as eternal is not mistaking anything for res, and because his other senses of reification still remain obscure. On this reading, Lukacs's reification as misapprehension would be a short-lived phenomenon. Seeing commodity structure as humanly un- changeable only becomes a misapprehension fairly late in the develop- ment of capitalism. Also, Lukacs's reification only makes sense where Marx's objectification is far advanced. It means the mystification of hu- man powers. Earlier societies may have mystified various aspects of their</page><page sequence="9">271 activity, but they could not mystify human powers very extensively be- cause human powers were not yet very extensive. Only where human powers and options are fully developed is there anything much to reify. Reification resides in the discrepancy between our real powers and our conception of them. That is why Lukacs insists that it is a condition "specific" to advanced capitalism, arising only when commodity ex- change has become the "constitutive form" or "universal structuring principle" of society, the "universal category of social being as a whole."38 Some exchange of commodities and quite a lot of human ex- ploitation already existed in primitive societies, Lukacs says, but they re- mained occasional, peripheral, or isolated phenomena. Only when they become central and pervasive in advanced capitalism do they turn into a kind of "second nature" to which we are in "servitude."39 Whether because it presupposes pervasive commodity structure, then, or because it presupposes objectification that is far advanced, reification is a phenomenon only of advanced capitalism for Lukacs. Almost the op- posite view is held, however, by the sociological theorists of reification, to whom this essay must therefore turn next. Berger and Luckmann: Reification in sociology For the sociological version of reification, the classical source is Peter L. Berger and Thomas Luckmann's The Social Construction of Reality. Their definition of the term is much like Lukacs's initial formulation: a misapprehension of human activity as res. Reification, they say, means "the apprehension of human phenomena as if they were things," or - putting it into the jargon - "as a non-human facticity."40 But Berger and Luckmann's concept remains essentially unitary, and has no coun- terpart to Lukacs's "objective" reification, let alone Arendtian reifica- tion. Reification is always and only "a modality of consciousness."41 The sociologists do discuss something they call "objectivation" that seems close to at least some features of Marxian objectification, but they stress that it must not be confused with reification. The latter is a misap- prehension of reality; objectivation is a sociological fact about our spe- cies, "by which the externalized products of human activity attain the character of objectivity."42 Some of our activity results in products that remain perceptible to ourselves and others "as elements of a common world."43 This includes not only physical objects, but also language and social institutions. Indeed, the entire "social order is a human product, or more precisely, an ongoing human production."44</page><page sequence="10">272 Reification is the failure to recognize these products as humanly engen- dered. The decisive question [that identifies reification] is whether [one] still retains awareness that, however objectivated, the social world was made by men - and, therefore, can be remade by them.45 The example Berger and Luckmann adduce is the institution of mar- riage, which they say can be reified variously, as an imitation of divine acts of creativity, as a universal mandate of natural law, as the necessary consequence of biological or psychological forces, or, for that matter, as a functional imperative of the social system.46 What identifies all of these as reifications is the denial of human choice and agency in fashioning the institution.47 The sociologists not only exclude Lukacs's "objective" reification, but also omit from their concept anything like the fifth aspect of his concept, the producing of a "reified consciousness." They do, however, discuss something akin to Lukacs's "subjective" reification, mostly in his third aspect (the attitude or manner of conduct of a "subject") but possibly also in the fourth aspect (the commodification of "subjects"). They call it the "reification of identity" or "of the total self." This they define as the total or excessive identification of a person with one particular role or stereotypical category. It includes both the stereotyping of others, as in anti-semitism, and what existentialists call "inauthenticity," in which one denies one's own options and responsibilities by reference to a role: "I have no choice in the matter, I have to act this way because of my position" - as husband, father, general, archbishop, chairman of the board, gangster, or hangman, as the case may be.48 Despite their basically similar definitions, Berger and Luckmann differ profoundly from Lukacs on both the causes of reification and the prospects for its cure. Lukacs describes a number of features of capitalist society that promote reification. Most fundamental is the mechanization of work.49 Required to work with machines and on assembly lines, workers must subordinate their impulses and natural rhythms and be- come themselves machine-like. They develop what Lukacs calls (in an un- fortunate choice of word) a "contemplative attitude," meaning that they lose all independence, creativity, sense of agency - the very capacities that distinguish them as human beings.50 But as more and more institu-</page><page sequence="11">273 tions are bureaucratized, formalized, "rationalized" in Max Weber's sense of the word, to fit in with factory production, reification spreads to all classes, so that a "worker faced with a particular machine" has much the same experience as, the entrepreneur faced with a given type of mechanical development, the tech- nologist faced with the state of science and the profitability of its application to technology.51 As the capitalist economy becomes a single, unified structure, it also produces a single, "formally unified structure of consciousness"; yet, at the very same time, the division of labor is becoming more elaborate, un- til everyone is a "specialist," aware only of his particular task.52 No one takes responsibility for the whole; no one can survey the whole; no one is in charge. Even those individuals still aware of personal choices con- strue them only in terms of their particular situation and interests.53 The large-scale, collective consequences of individual decisions and mass apathy thus confront everyone as an external force, and those conse- quences are very great. Almost everything that matters is by this time hu- manly produced or shaped. For Berger and Luckmann, the causes of reification are much simpler, and of little interest. Objectivation arises because it is psychologically and socially functional. People develop routines, both individually and interpersonally, because this makes life more predictable, decreases ten- sion, secures order and saves time and effort, leaving people free to deal with what is new.54 But objectivation is not reification. About whether reification is functional and what causes it, Berger and Luckmann have little to say. They suggest that it is biologically natural to the small child being initiated into a culture created by others. Adults may recall creat- ing or modifying some institutions by their own agency, but the child has no such experience. For it, the culture is "given," not humanly made, and it learns otherwise only as its thinking is "dereified" through in- creasing sophistication.55 Accordingly, for Berger and Luckmann, reification is not particularly a modern phenomenon, nor tied to any particular mode of production. It is a universal human tendency, a feature of social psychology in general: "as soon as an objective social world is established, the possibility of reification is never far away."56 They do recognize that reification will be more intense in some social circumstances than others, and that it can sometimes extend to an entire "institutional order as a whole." But their example of this is drawn from primitive society: a society that sees</page><page sequence="12">274 its entire culture as a microcosm "reflecting the macrocosm of the total universe as made by the gods." They do not have a historical theory like Lukacs's, in which reification is the culmination of a (dialectical) histori- cal process. On the contrary, Berger and Luckmann stress that, if any- thing, reification is at its height in the beginning, in isolated primitive societies. It would be a mistake to look at reification as a perversion of an originally non- reified apprehension of the social world, a sort of cognitive fall from grace.57 Reification is a function of naivete, they argue, both in the species and in the individual. Primitive tribes and small children assume that their way is the only possible way. Having encountered no alternative, they be- stow on their own institutions "an ontological status independent of hu- man activity and signification." Only with increasing sophistication is this assumption undone through "dereification of consciousness, which is a comparatively late development in history and in any individual bi- ography."58 Accordingly, Berger and Luckmann urge sociologists to study the social circumstances that favor dereification - such as the overall collapse of institutional orders, the contact between previously segregated societies, and the important phenomenon of social marginality.59 They make no comparable suggestion about the social circumstances that produce reification. Lukacs, by contrast, is far more detailed and explicit about the origins of reification than about its cure, though he is of course convinced that it will end in the communist revolution. Although all classes in advanced capitalism partake of it, they experience reification in different ways. The proletariat gradually becomes class-conscious as a result of factory or- ganization, economic crises, and political struggles over wages and working conditions, but the substantive content of its class- consciousness is radically different from that of the bourgeoisie. Because the proletarian is objectively both a commodity on the market and a hu- man being capable of agency, proletarian class-consciousness is "the self-consciousness of the commodity" and thus necessarily dialectical, closing the unbridgeable gap postulated by bourgeois thought between mind and matter, the realm of freedom and the realm of causation.60 Speaking less abstractly, bourgeois class-consciousness means awareness of a shared interest in maintaining capitalism, and thus in maintaining a competitive, fragmented, non-class orientation. Proletarian class-</page><page sequence="13">275 consciousness means awareness of a shared interest in cooperation, col- lectivity, and solidarity. Thus workers begin to "intend" the whole; being dialectical, their class-consciousness is able to "lead to a knowledge of totality."61 So they overcome the "contemplative" attitude and come to realize their collective power of agency as a class. For Berger and Luckmann, then, particular instances of reification are relatively easy to cure, but reification as such will never end. It arises anew with each infant. For Lukacs, by contrast, reification ends with the coming of communism, and it ends totally. Lukacs believes in (dialecti- cal) progress; Berger and Luckmann do not. Yet things are not so simple, the contrast between the two perspectives not as stark as it first seems. For one thing, Lukacs and Marx cannot have failed to know the sort of facts Berger and Luckmann stress about primitive peoples. Though an- thropology was in its infancy, they had studied the history of Greek phi- losophy, both directly and in its Hegelian version. They surely knew about the development from Homeric naive simplicity (in which dike - the root of the later word for justice or righteousness - simply meant "the way": the way things are, the way things are done) through the presocratics and Socrates and the Sophists to later Cynics and Stoics and Skeptics.62 When Lukacs says that reification is at its height in late capitalism, he certainly does not mean that the Homeric sort of naive ethnocentrism is at its height. On the contrary, he doubtless shares Marx's view that capitalism tears people out of their traditional roots in craft and community and forcibly sophisticates them in the melting pot of urban life and factory work. Furthermore, although Berger and Luckmann warn against regarding reification as "a sort of cognitive fall from grace," they themselves pro- ceed to do just that. "Man is capable of forgetting his authorship of the human world," they write. In reification, "the world loses its compre- hensibility as a human enterprise." And "the decisive question is wheth- er [one] still retains awareness" of human agency.63 Evidently in pas- sages like these, the sociologists are thinking not of primitive naivete but of phenomena like habituation and forgetfulness, the routinization of charisma, the transformation of sect into church and of mass movement into bureacracy. They note that abstract, theoretical thinking - surely a feature of modern sophistication - tends to reification.64 And they warn "against the distortive reifications of both sociologism and psy- chologism," as well as of the "structural analysis of social phenomena," all of which tend to make sociologists mistake the very nature of their</page><page sequence="14">276 proper subject matter: "society as part of a human world, made by men."65 Evidently two rather different kinds of phenomena fit within the defini- tion of reification that Lukacs and Berger and Luckmann share. James W. Woodard's Intellectual Realism and Cultural Change: A Preliminary Study of Reification is useful here, for Woodard makes the distinction explicit, though only with reference to individual psychology.66 Like Berger and Luckmann, he notes the reification involved in the naivete and "egocentrism" of small children, but points out that in another sense, children reify less than adults. For, the child has not yet been conditioned to the full battery of conventionalized hypocrisies, institutionalized absurdities, and sanctified fallacies which have be- come so integral a part of the mental world of the adult.67 It is the child who is able to see and say that the emperor wears no clothes. Thus one must distinguish the "reification of inhabituation" from the "reification of naivete."68 For Berger and Luckmann, all aspects of culture are equally relevant to reification. They do not give preference to material over non-material culture, nor to the means and mode of production over religion, philoso- phy, or art. Consequently, for them it is not obvious that there is more objectivation in modern than in primitive society. What might it mean, after all, to say that one society has more culture than another? So the sociologists have no reason to assume that the potential for reification is greater in modern capitalism than in a primitive tribe. Though they are in fact interested in both kinds of reification, failing to notice the distinc- tion Woodard draws, they discuss the cause and cure only of naive reifi- cation, and have no alternative to offer to Lukacs's account of modern, sophisticated reification. They are simply confused. Lukacs avoids this confusion, but only by ignoring naive reification altogether; he is interest- ed only in the situation where human powers are extensive, and where nothing but reification blocks their realization. To some extent, Lukacs and Berger and Luckmann talk past each other, but not entirely, and their basic definitions are close. Might social science be able to determine empirically which of them is right? But how would such a study proceed? How measure reification? Would the results of such a study not depend on the sense of reification with which it began? The conceptual problems cannot be escaped so easily. Perhaps, then, the dictionary can offer an authoritative resolution.</page><page sequence="15">277 Consulting the dictionary The Oxford English Dictionary says that reification means "the mental conversion of a person or an abstract concept into a thing," and, cor- respondingly, to reify is "to convert mentally into a thing; to material- ize." The earliest examples date from the mid-nineteenth century. The first thing to notice about the definition is the term "mental(ly)." Evidently the physical conversion of anything into a res is not acceptable as reification, though there seems no etymological reason for this limita- tion. But what does "mentally converting into a thing" mean? Does it, for instance, mean mentally producing some actual change in the world, or merely changing the apprehension of a world that itself remains un- changed? Physical conversion into a thing would presumably have to in- volve changing the world, but mental conversion is ambiguous. Psy- chokinesis aside, whether and how we can mentally change the physical world is a vexed question of philosophy. Some philosophers argue that the world is constituted as much by our concepts as by the merely physi- cal. Take Hannah Arendt's conception of reification already discussed: the realizing of a "mental image" in some physical object through fabri- cation. This would seem to qualify as converting some non-res into res, but was it done mentally or physically? Doesn't the answer have to be "both"? Most likely, however, what the dictionary means by "mentally converting into a thing" is changes in apprehension of the world, whether misappre- hensions that create illusions, or correct perceptions that remove them. The dictionary gives examples of both kinds. Next, notice that the dictionary allows only two kinds of entities to be reifiable: persons and abstract concepts. Reification turns out to mean something different in each case. First, what can it mean to convert a person into a res mentally? The dictionary example to illustrate this us- age is about how what people once regarded as Helios, the sun god, came to be recognized as an inanimate object, the sun. This is clearly a change in apprehension (even if a philosopher might want to call it also a change in the world), and in the direction of shedding rather than creating illusions. What would constitute the mental converting of a person into a res in the opposite direction, creating a misapprehension? Presumably it would mean something like depersonalization or dehumanization: regarding or</page><page sequence="16">278 mentally treating persons as if they were objects. This could mean deny- ing their moral status as humans, their membership in what Kant called the "kingdom of ends," of beings we may not use as mere means to our own ends, in the way that objects are used. Here reification would mean a failure to apply moral considerations in the (mental) treatment of peo- ple. Alternatively, dehumanizing a person could mean denying that per- son's capacity for agency - that is, for initiative, responsibility, creativi- ty, autonomous judgment. While the denial of moral status is done to others, the denial of agency can also, importantly, be done to the self, as in Berger and Luckmann's "reification of identity" ("I have to act this way because of my position...") or Lukacs's third aspect of reification (the manner of conduct of a "contemplative" subject). In literary criti- cism, reification is sometimes contrasted to animism or personification in just this sense: reification means that a person is presented as an inani- mate object, while animism or personification mean that an object is presented as alive, a person.69 The reification of "abstract concepts" is an altogether different kettle of fish. It has nothing to do with their dehumanization, or moral status, or agency. Instead it means something like hypostatization: mentally converting an abstract concept into something concrete, tangible, or - as the dictionary says - "materializing" it. It is not clear why the dic- tionary says "abstract concepts," given that all concepts are abstract, and other abstractions besides concepts can presumably be reified. Prob- ably the dictionary should simply have said "abstractions." All of the dictionary examples illustrating the reification of abstractions, by contrast with those for persons, imply a misapprehension, the errone- ous ascribing of materiality. Woodard glosses the meaning of this sense of reification as: conferring an overgreat concreteness or tangibility on what is only conceptual, relational, or functional... taking as factual, concrete, or perceptual that which is only conceptual;... taking as absolute that which is only relative, etc.70 Ultimately, he says, it means "any unwarranted extension of reality in the thing perceived or conceived," including projection, hallucination, delu- sion, wishful thinking, naivete, provincialism, anthropomorphism.71 He even introduces the category "negative reification" for cases where reali- ty is improperly constricted instead of extended.72 Woodard points out that the etymological root of "real" is also res; reification, he suggests, is realification.73 Woodard is a nominalist, and thinks the reification of abstractions is always a misapprehension. But one need not share his philosophical stance.</page><page sequence="17">279 Indeed, even though Woodard defines the word as any unwarranted ex- tension or contraction of reality, and even though the dictionary exam- ples are all of misapprehension, one might also include in the reification of abstractions the correct recognition as material of what had previous- ly been taken for merely abstract, the correct recognition of the real as real, whether concrete or abstract. The contemporary philosopher Wil- lard Van Orman Quine, for instance, uses the word "reification" in a manner entirely neutral between misapprehension and correct apprehen- sion. Recognizing all our categories and concepts as conventional, Quine uses "reification" to mean the selecting of what sorts of entities we will consider real and "admit to our ontology."74 Reification in this sense can be good or bad; it's a matter of getting reality right. Take commodities. Are they res? Are they real? Concrete or abstract? Here is an iron frying pan I bought this morning at the hardware store for $12.95. It is (or was this morning) a commodity. It is a real physical object, subject to natural laws like the law of gravity. It has practical use value; I bought it to cook with. It has a physical history, having been manufactured in some particular time and place by the actual productive activity of some particular person(s). But are these things true of it as a commodity? "Commodity" means an item of market exchange, to be bought and sold. Qua commodity, this pan has neither weight nor size, neither practical utility nor a physical history. It has only a price, and it is subject not to natural laws but to the laws of the market, such as supply and demand. Of course there would be no commodity exchange if there were not physical objects and living people to produce and use them. But commodities are also real in their own right, as commodities; for example, market fluctuations in their prices have direct, practical consequences in people's lives. So what do we mistake in reifying com- modities? How do Lukacs's and Berger and Luckmann's conceptions of reification fit into the dictionary definition? Are they reification of persons or of abstractions? Certainly parts of what the dictionary calls reification of persons are central to their concerns, but the sorts of entities that these theorists say are reified are not persons, but relationships, activities, processes, "human phenomena," "the social world," "externalized products of human activity," and so on. These certainly have to do with human beings, but they are not themselves human beings. Berger and Luckmann say that "the reified world is, by definition, a dehumanized world," but what is being reified in that sentence is not a person, but the world.75</page><page sequence="18">280 Perhaps, then, these theorists are mainly concerned with the reification of abstractions? But neither Lukacs nor Berger and Luckmann consider the entities that get reified to be abstractions. On the contrary, what typi- cally happens in their reification as misapprehension is almost the oppo- site. Some concrete, actual, (as Marx would say) sensual human activity, relationship, or product is mystified into an abstraction like the market or the gods. This seems more like improper abstractness than improper concreteness; why call it reification? The market, or the gods, are indeed taken to be real and even personified as exercising power over people. But Lukacs also insists that the market and its power are real. And surely if something is being improperly personified or demonized, that would be more like animism, the opposite of reification. Accordingly, in the one passage where Marx uses the word Verdinglichung, he contrasts the reifi- cation of productive relationships to the personification of things, though he says both occur together in political economy, as a ghostly "Monsieur le Capital and Madame la Terre do their haunting simultane- ously as social characters and as mere objects."76 Our argument, then, seems driven to the remarkable conclusion that neither Lukacs's nor Berger and Luckmann's concept of reification fits the dictionary definition at all. That need not be a fault. Dictionaries are sometimes wrong, and even when right they reflect usage, which - un- der conditions of reification - is more likely to disguise than to reveal reality. Poets, scientists, and theorists sometimes discover illuminating new ways with words. But it does signify that the dictionary cannot clari- fy what these theorists mean by reification. Can we? The complexities and confusions mount. It is time to get back to basics: what is really at stake in the idea of reification for these theorists? Review for a moment: Lukacs first defined reification as mistaking a hu- man relationship for res, but soon complicated things by introducing ob- jective reification and other senses of the word. Berger and Luckmann avoided these complications by confining the term to a failure to see the human origin of what is humanly made, so that "the world of institu- tions appears to merge with that world of nature."77 Marx, too, men- tioned confusing the formulas of bourgeois economics with "necessity imposed by nature"; Lukacs spoke of assigning to human things a "phantom objectivity"; and the Dictionary of Marxist Thought defines reified things as "man-produced things which have become independent</page><page sequence="19">281 (and which are imagined as originally independent) of man."78 So the issue becomes mistaking humanly made res for natural res. And why does that matter? Berger and Luckmann say it most explicitly: The decisive question is whether [one] still retains the awareness that, however objectivated, the social world was made by men - and, therefore, can be re- made by them.79 These theorists want to free and empower people. The real point of reifi- cation for them is that it blocks or cripples action because people fail to see their real options and capacities. The point is problems that might be solved, suffering that might be alleviated, disasters that might be averted if only people saw them as actionable, saw how they themselves were inadvertently causing the trouble by their own activity. So it is not so much that non-res is taken for res or even that humanly made res is taken for natural, as that troublesome conditions we could change are taken for unchangeable. But if that is the real point, then, first, "reification" does not seem a very good word for it. And, second, Lukacs's and Berger and Luckmann's treatment of reification rests on a crucial, hitherto only implicit assumption: that humanly made equals humanly changeable, while natural res equals humanly unchangeable. As soon as that assumption is explicit, its problematic character becomes evident. Whatever made anyone suppose such an equation to hold? Surely our most ordinary experience suggests otherwise. We shape and alter natural objects all the time; we are the artificers. And what can be more difficult than organizing people for significant social change - unless it be accomplishing a significant change in oneself? Hegel said it and Lukacs quotes him: "It is much harder to bring movement into fixed ideas than into sensuous existence."80 Indeed, Lukacs argues explicitly that the conception of nature as fixed and unchangeable is itself a bour- geois reification, and both he and Berger and Luckmann stress our ca- pacity to transform the natural. They do not in fact believe the assump- tion hidden in their concept. But perhaps the problematic assumption has not yet been given its most plausible formulation. Two modifications suggest themselves. Perhaps what is to be taken as humanly unchangeable is not natural objects, but the natural laws that govern such objects; and perhaps what is to be tak- en as humanly changeable is not whatever originated in human action, but whatever is - even now - sustained only by human activity. Both modifications are worth considering.</page><page sequence="20">282 Human beings change many natural objects, but always only in accord with the laws of physics, chemistry, and biology, which themselves are not humanly changeable. So mistaking human relationships or activities for res might mean taking them for the sort of entity that can be changed only in accord with unchangeable, eternal laws. This would fit with Marx's charge against the bourgeois political economists, that they took their formulae to be "as much a self-evident necessity imposed by nature as productive labor itself."81 But Marx certainly thought that even hu- man action was limited by inescapable necessities, including some - like the need to produce - that were natural and eternal. Berger and Luck- mann would surely agree, and it is hard to believe that Lukaics would not. Unless one defines the social world as what is humanly changeable, and the natural as what is not, both human and natural res are humanly changeable only within limits, some of which are conditional and tem- porary, others necessary and eternal. So the problem here is not taking human for natural res but mistaking conditional or temporary regulari- ties for necessary and eternal ones, an error that can occur in natural science as well as political economy, and which there is no reason to call reification. There is, however, another sense of "natural law" to be considered. Throughout most of European history, most people regarded nature, or the deity that created nature, as imposing not only necessary regularities on objects but also standards of right conduct on people - "natural laws" in the sense, say, in which they are invoked by the United States Declaration of Independence. People have a choice about obeying such laws, but not about their validity or content. Mistaking some local and temporary human convention for such a law can, indeed, prevent people from acting to change it, and both Lukacs and Berger and Luckmann appear to include this sort of mistake in their concepts of reification.82 But this kind of natural law has nothing to do with res; it applies only to human beings, so again the term "reification" seems inappropriate. The other possible modification in the problematic assumption that hu- manly made equals humanly changeable is that it refers not to origins but to maintenance. Surely much that is begun by human action is be- yond our power to undo, sometimes even to control or modify. Consider murder. Consider a forest fire. Consider a chain reaction. But maybe when Berger and Luckmann refer to what is "made by men - and, therefore, can be remade by them," they really mean what is, even now, sustained only by human activity. For they also say that "social order is a human product, or more precisely, an ongoing human production...</page><page sequence="21">283 [that] exists only and insofar as human activity continues to produce it."83 Lukacs, too, speaks of "the unbroken production and reproduc- tion of those relations among humans."84 Capitalism, racism, marriage, baseball, the criminal law, the university - such institutions consist in organized patterns of human activity and relationship (even if some of them also involve the use of certain physical objects). Insofar as an institution consists only in human activity, the proposition that it is changeable by human activity seems tautologically true: changed activity is a changed institution. That apparent tautological guarantee of success, left implicit and there- fore unchallenged, is one reason for the appeal of the idea of reification. Yet the philosophical security of the tautology only masks the real prac- tical and political problems. The issue is not, after all, whether our ac- tivities are likely to change in some way, but whether we can change them deliberately, in accord with our intentions, to achieve certain goals. And the answer to that question is thoroughly problematic, varying from case to case. We watch with horror the approach of nuclear war, of ecological disaster, of world famine. Yet these disasters are not approaching us; it is we who are approaching them by our continuing activities. To avert them we have only to stop doing what we do. Only! It sounds like the advice given to Kafka's mouse by the cat. The question is - can we? "Can" is a notoriously troublesome concept, vital to our daily function- ing but a philosophical nightmare.85 Its use always seems to presuppose an unlimited number of implicit "ifs," many of them involving further "can's" or "could's" that are themselves equally problematic. Given enough "ifs," including some that are wildly counterfactual, absolutely anything becomes feasible. Yet, in the event, only one of the possibilities actually happens. "Can" ranges about in the intervening terrain, shadowed by its even more elusive companion, "could." Their meaning always needs to be completed, and the "ifs" they presuppose limited, by the particular context of their use.86 The difficulties are great enough with respect to our individual lives. Suppose that I have a bad habit, or a character flaw, or an addiction. Can I stop? "You can if you want to enough," admonishes the reformer. "She can if she has sufficient ego strength," comments the psychologist. "She can if placed in a favorable social environment," adds the sociolo-</page><page sequence="22">284 gist. "God willing," murmurs the preacher. And we know that, in practi- cal terms, it all depends. If these matters are hard to think about with respect to an individual, they are even harder with respect to the large-scale social and political issues where the idea of reification is meant to apply. For there one must deal not merely with problematic "can's, " "could's, " and "ifs, " but also with the problematic "we." What "we" can do depends on who we are - how many, how determined, how powerful or skillful. And the mem- bership of that "we" will vary with the way we define our task and our means, for some will join and others withdraw with each change in direc- tion. All this further depends profoundly on how people understand themselves and their world. Change people's ideas, and their conduct will change; yet not just any new idea will be accepted. A new way of looking at things will be widely accepted only if it makes sense of peo- ple's actual experience, speaks to their needs and desires. And in politics, thinking is always divided, controversial. There will not be agreement even on goals or the identification of problems, let alone on the causes of problems or the means to their solution. So the cheerful claim that what we have made we can remake differently, masks the question of whether those two "we's" are the same. In the words of the famous 1960s joke, "Whadda ya mean, 'we,' White Man?"87 In addition, the feasibility of changing social institutions involves the problem of organization. Changing the habitual, institutionalized pat- terns of interaction of large numbers of people requires organizing or coordinating them in some new way. And every way of doing that has further consequences of its own. A bureaucracy produces different results than a commune; a Leninist revolution develops differently from an anarchist one. It may even be that some goals cannot be reached by means of deliberately organized action at all. Finally, some social institutions are particularly difficult to change be- cause their functioning is basic to our physical survival. They cannot be interrupted for long, or people will die. So if they are to be altered, pres- ent arrangements must promptly be replaced by some feasible alterna- tive. Even if many people can see the bad consequences of present insti- tutions of production, each of them still needs to make a living and all still need food, water, and shelter. In the absence of a feasible alternative, they cannot simply stop what they now do.88 Central to Lukacs's and Berger and Luckmann's intentions in discussing</page><page sequence="23">285 reification is the idea that people fail to solve problems or avert disasters because they lack awareness that they themselves are causing those prob- lems or disasters and could stop doing so. But what people can do, what options are really open at a particular time in a particular society, is al- ways politically problematic. The point is not action for its own sake, for we are already active; the point is action that will succeed in promoting justice or freedom or simply well-being. Sacrificing people and wasting resources in the pursuit of hopeless causes are not helpful. Does it all come down, then, to nothing more definite than good politi- cal judgment, and leave us with nothing more useful than some secular version of Reinhold Niebuhr's prayer: "God grant me the strength to en- dure with serenity what cannot be changed, the courage to change what can be changed, and the wisdom to tell the difference?" Conclusion By now this essay has accumulated over twenty alleged meanings, senses, or aspects of reification; there seems not much point in listing them.89 Some of them are mutually consistent, almost overlapping; others are in- compatible. Some are in accord with the dictionary definition, others not. With some, the sense in which some entity is being converted into a res is evident; with others, try as I might, I cannot find such a sense. The dictionary entry itself is rather slipshod, and interpreters have ex- panded the term's meaning almost indefinitely beyond it. The main ways in which Lukacs and Berger and Luckmann use the word do not fit into the dictionary definition at all. They make the meaning of reification de- pendent on concepts like "can" and "could" that are themselves heavily dependent on the particular context of their use. Lukacs's and Berger and Luckmann's discussions are confusing and very probably confused. The whole thing is a swamp. Can this concept be saved? And should it? Within the limits of the dictionary definition, the concept does its work well enough. When Stephen Gould, say, criticizes psychologists for reify- ing intelligence by assuming that the I.Q. test must be testing something, he and the concept perform a clear and useful function.90 But if the main concerns are those of Lukacs and Berger and Luckmann, in my opinion the term mystifies more than it reveals. Their concerns could be accommodated within the dictionary definition as reification of persons,</page><page sequence="24">286 in the sense of denying people's capacity for agency. But although Lukaics and Berger and Luckmann do occasionally use the word this way, for the most part they do not. So articulating their concerns within this sense of the word would require extensive rewriting of their arguments. Would political theorists who share those concerns not do better to abandon the concept? I would unhesitatingly advise it, except for one, crucial consideration. There really is something going on among us that we urgently need to think and talk about, and that Lukacs's and Berger and Luckmann's conceptions of reification were meant to address. People do feel trapped, in a way that makes Kafka's little fable so perfectly emblematic for our experience. Despite the prevalence in modern society of all of Berger and Luckmann's "social circumstances that favor dereification," very many people do feel helpless to influence the conditions that constrain their lives. Millions of Americans turn their backs on politics, judging that en- gagement in it would make no significant difference. Millions of mem- bers of the underclass feel worthless - though also filled with diffuse rage - because society seems to have no use for them. Almost all of us function in large organizational systems, whether as parts of the machin- ery or materials being processed, and have learned to take that condition for granted. We function within an economy that depends on a system of international banking and finance that everyone knows to be in con- stant danger of collapse. Almost all of us submit without question to the "technological imperative" that daily exhausts our resources, destroys our health, and poisons the earth. And we march like sleepwalkers down the road marked "deterrence" and "nonproliferation," toward nuclear doom.91 Experts and critics offer various diagnoses of our condition, but whatever measures are actually taken to treat it seem only to make it worse. This familiar litany of troubles suggests a malaise far too extensive and too grave for the powers of political prudence. When a society, or an en- tire civilization, .or even the whole human species seems bent on self- destruction, one suspects systematic, pervasive, fundamental derange- ment in people's patterns of both thought and conduct. Calling on polit- ical prudence here is almost bound to mean calling for "more of the same." Here what is needed is a more basic realignment of assumptions, of the sort that has traditionally been associated with great political the- ory. Wading through the dismal swamp of reification theory, as this essay</page><page sequence="25">287 does, can leave one feeling that such concepts, and political theory itself, are hopelessly abstracted from reality and of no practical use in relation to our urgent political problems, so that political prudence is the only hope. But political reality itself, and the prudence by which gifted actors know how to move within it, always presuppose and depend on theoreti- cal frameworks - if not self-conscious, deliberate theorizing, then unex- amined, inherited theory or, more likely, fragments of theories that may well be outdated or mutually inconsistent. So if we seem today bereft of political prudence and judgment, close to our wits' end, that may be be- cause our wits are operating out of such incoherent fragments of inherit- ed assumptions. The message to be derived from the familiar litany of our troubles and our sleepwalking, then, is not the familiar exhortation to, "For God's sake, do something before it is too late!" For while we may feel inert, we are already doing something - a lot of things - and they are the source of our troubles. Like Kafka's mouse, we run and run. Berger and Luck- mann's and Lukacs's concept of reification was meant to address precise- ly those troubles that are the large-scale outcome of our myriad activi- ties, sustained and enlarged by nothing more than what we do. The problem is how to stop, how to do something else, what else to do. That is a problem as much for thought as for action, a problem for ac- tion informed and empowered by new thought. Part of the value of Berg- er and Luckmann's - and even more of Lukacs's - discussion of reifi- cation is that they tried to provide a general theory of the nature and roots of our condition, orienting us to likely avenues for action, feasible ways and means, probable allies and opponents. Their efforts, this es- say has argued, were confused and deeply flawed. The concept of reifica- tion is probably not a good tool for the job, and bad tools mean sloppy work. But better sloppy work with a bad tool than no work at all. Those of us who persist in reaching for the word "reification" as a tool should probably employ greater care. We should require ourselves to specify in each case precisely what we mean, and attend to whether and how our various meanings in various contexts are interrelated. But whether we re- vise the concept of reification, or abandon it, or just let it continue to slop along in its present state of dishevelment doesn't much matter. What matters is that we continue to think - hard and critically, theoreti- cally and politically - about the conditions that Lukacs and Berger and Luckmann were trying to address. Our thinking here must be simultaneously theoretical and political: theo-</page><page sequence="26">288 retical in the sense of radical, cutting through conventions and cliches to the real roots of our troubles, seeing social arrangements large-scale and long-range, as if from the outside, which may be what Lukacs meant by "intending totality."92 Yet the thinking must also be political, in the sense of oriented to action, practical, speaking in a meaningful way to those capable of making the necessary changes, those Lukacs called "the 'we' of genesis."93 For Lukacs, of course, that meant the proletariat. But one need not be a Marxist to see the need for locating such a "we," and the point of seeking it among those with an objective interest in the right sort of change and the potential power to bring it about. The aim is not some new doctrine to save us from ourselves, but a transformed way of seeing what we already tacitly know and do, which restores us to our real world - the "concrete here and now," as Lukacs puts it - and our real, living selves, including our capacities for action. That would mean not some access to mysterious, infinite powers, but the appropria- tion of our actual powers, recognizing the present moment as "the mo- ment of decision, the moment of the birth of the new," as Lukacs says, out of which we jointly "make the future."94 That is no return to Hegelian idealism, but a recovery of the practical, political Marx. Thinking both theoretically and politically in this way is no easy task; indeed, it is almost a contradiction in terms. Yet it may well be our best hope, and the world is in a hurry. Despite all of the political and philosophical difficulties, unless we undertake this task we may well guarantee our own entrapment, assuring that we will end up like Kafka's mouse, rather than human and free.

Unfortunately for Lukacs's thesis, Marx says that this particular mystification (and thus Marx's only use of the word Verdinglichung) is "dissolved" rather than imposed or exemplified by "classical economics."</page><page sequence="27">289 4.

Occasionally Lukacs maintains, instead, that what is reified is a process, or he equates relationship and process, or he claims that only process is real, that all supposed ob- jects and facts are really only processes or "aspects of processes"; at other times he treats the idea of process itself as a reification of human activity.

Hannah Arendt has argued that Arbeit is rightly translated by "labor" rather than "work," and concluded accordingly that Marx saw human beings fundamentally as the animal laborans. This seems to me doubtful both with respect to the modern trans- lation of Arbeit (though it may be valid etymologically) and with respect to Marx's thought.

The deciphering of Lukacs's meaning here is made more difficult by his citing passages from Marx to the effect that labor power becomes a commodity to the worker himself, suggesting "subjective" in the sense of idiosyncratic, inaccurate because of personal bias. But this is not what Lukacs means by "subjective" here.

Georg Lukacs, "Vorwort (1967)" in Geschichte und Klassenbewusstsein, 25, 27; "Pref- ace to the New Edition (1967)" in History and Class Consciousness, xxiv-xxv. Actual- ly Lukacs is relating his own thought to that of both Marx and Hegel, and to not just two but three of their concepts: Entausserung, Entfremdung, and Vergegenstdnd- lichung. While the third of these is unproblematically translated by "objectification," the first two present translation problems. Some translators use "alienation" for the one German term, some for the other, and there is good reason for either decision. Entausserung is related to aussen, which means outside; so it means "outering," exter- nalization, projection. Entfremdung is related to fremd, meaning foreign or strange; so it means "foreignization," estrangement. But the former term is used in German for alienation of property, the latter for the alienation of affections. Both Hegel and Marx use all three words, and both sharply distinguish Entfremdung, a painful condi- tion, from the other two, which refer to human creative power. Hegel tends to juxta- pose Entfremdung mostly to Entausserung; Marx juxtaposes it mostly to Vergegen- stdndlichung. For a thoughtful treatment of these translation problems, see Karl Marx, Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844, translated by Martin Milli- gan (Moscow: Foreign Languages Publishing House, no date given), 10-13. 26.

Accordingly, only what can be "represented in the outside world" is "capable of [un- dergoing] reification," so that mental images can be reified but sensations cannot. Ibid., 141. 32. "Man [der Mensch, that is, the human being] produces man - himself and the other man," so that "the entire so-called history of the world is nothing but the begetting of man through human labor [Arbeit]." Marx, "Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts," in Tucker, editor, Marx-Engels Reader, 85, 92; see also The German Ideology in ibid., 157. 33. Lukacs's objective reification is confused also because it includes both material ob- jects, which surely would continue into a communist society unless destroyed in the revolution, and entities such as commodities and the market that disappear with capitalism. 34. Accordingly, Lukacs is able to adduce passages from Capital that closely parallel a number of his arguments; e.g. "Verdinglichung," 174-175; "Reification," 86. 35. Nor does the distinction between Schein, illusion, and Erscheinung, appearance, to which Andrew Arato calls attention (Andrew Arato, "Lukacs's Theory of Reifica- tion," Telos, No. 11 (Spring 1972) 25-60, at 32 n) help here, for then the question be- comes what Erscheinung, appearance, means: is the market objectively there or not? Do market regularities constrain people or not? And if so, just how is that appearance different from "essence," particularly for a Marxist? 36. Marx, Capital, I, in Tucker, ed., Marx-Engels Reader, 327. 37. Marx says: "The life-process of society, which is based on the process of material production, does not strip off its mystical veil until it is treated as production by freely associated men, and is consciously regulated by them in accordance with a settled plan. This, however, demands for society a certain material ground-work or set of con- ditions of existence which in their turn are the spontaneous product of a long and painful process of development."

For the most part, "exchange value... is still directly bound up with use value," and people can still perceive directly the actual, sensuous activity by which goods are produced. Similarly, even where there is great exploitation and even mechanical, stan- dardized labor, as in the building of the Egyptian pyramids, this was not the main basis of production; the slaves were regarded as exceptions, not even human. This seems to conflict with Lukacs's claim that in primitive society exploitation is not yet mystified: is the exclusion of slaves from the category of human beings not a mystification, then? Marx himself says about the construction of temples in ancient Egypt by slaves both that it was based "upon direct relations of subjection" visible to all, not mystified, and that it "appear[ed] to be in the service of the gods," thus mystified after all.

In an earlier article by Berger and Stanley Pullberg, objectivation is distin- guished from objectification in this way: "By objectivation we mean that process whereby human subjectivity embodies itself in products that are available to oneself and one's fellow men as elements of a common world.... By objectification we mean the moment in the process of objectivation in which man establishes distance from his producing and its product, such that he can take cognizance of it and make of it an object of his consciousness." Peter L. Berger and Stanley Pullberg, "Reification and the Sociological Critique of Consciousness," History and Theory, IV (1965) 196-211, 199-200. The latter concept, rather strange in its implication that while working we do not take cognizance of what we work on, does not appear in The Social Construc- tion of Reality. 43.

Berger and Pullberg say that reification "defines action without the actor, and praxis without the author." They add that it "converts action into process"; but Berger and Luckmann are as ambiguous as Lukacs (see note 9 above) about whether process is a reification, or the unreified reality of human life.

Lukacs remarks that reification played a role in ancient Greece (which seems inconsis- tent with his claim that it is a condition specific to advanced capitalism), but he locates it in that society's "maturity" - that is, in its period of greatest sophistication rather than primitive naivete.

For those who were too young to have heard it: the Lone Ranger and his faithful Indi- an side-kick, Tonto, are hopelessly trapped by hostile Indians. As the enemy warriors close in for the kill, the Lone Ranger says, "Tonto, what are we going to do?" To which Tonto responds, "Whadda ya mean, 'we,' White Man?" 88. This is one way of conceptualizing what is basic about Marx's "base." 89. Well, maybe, in a footnote: 1) Misapprehending a human relationship as a thing (Lukacs); 2) Recognizing what had been taken for a human relationship as a thing (im- plicit in O.E.D.); 3) The coming into being of a world of commodities and their move- ments on the market (Lukacs); 4) Realizing a "mental image" in an artifact (Arendt); 5) Forming a mind in such a way that it tends to take human relationships for things (Lukacs); 6) Misapprehending a person as a thing, in the sense of denying capacity for agency (O.E.D., Lukacs, Berger and Luckmann); 7) Misapprehending a person as a thing, in the sense of denying moral status (O.E.D., Lukacs, Berger and Luckmann); 8) Recognizing as a thing what had been mistaken for a person (OE.D.); 9) and 10) (Mis)apprehending an abstraction as a person (Lukacs, possibly Berger and Luck- mann); 11) Misapprehending an abstraction (abstract concept?) as a thing (O.E.D., Woodard, Quine); 12) Recognizing as a thing what had been mistaken for an abstrac- tion (abstract concept?) (implicit in O.E.D., Quine); 13) Misapprehending an abstrac- tion as real (Woodard); 14) Deciding what is real (Quine); 15) and 16) (Mis)apprehend- ing something humanly made as natural (Berger and Luckmann, probably Lukacs); 17) and 18) (Mis)apprehending temporary or contingent regularities as eternal, universal laws (Marx on fetishism, possibly Lukacs, possibly Berger and Luckmann); 19) and 20) (Mis)apprehending human conventions as sacred (Lukacs, Berger and Luckmann); 21) and 22) (Mis)apprehending what is humanly changeable as humanly unchangeable (Lukacs, Berger and Luckmann). If one further divides each of these categories be- tween the reification of inhabituation and that of naivete, their number will double. But perhaps that distinction will not actually fit all of them; I have not pursued the matter. 90. Stephen Gould, The Mismeasurement of Man (New York: W. W. Norton, 1981). 91. A few of these "dangers" might actually be blessings for those now exploited and op- pressed, but most would be clear and unmitigated disasters. Even Marxists must now take seriously the possibility that the owners of the earth might destroy it rather than give it up. 92. Lukacs, "Verdinglichung," 303, 297; "Reification," 174, 169. 93.
