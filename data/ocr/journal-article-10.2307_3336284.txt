<plain_text><page sequence="1">DUALITY IN TABWA ART ALLEN F. ROBERTS Is there such a thing as "Bantu art"? Several authors have raised this ques- tion recently, from different points of view. Jan Vansina has stated flatly that "there is no Bantu culture and there are no Bantu arts! It is a diffusion of lan- guages only" that so affected Africa from the Cross River to the southern tip of the continent 1,500 years or more ago (1984:10). Theophile Obenga, however, asserts that there is a Bantu aesthetic. Af- rican art is "art de raison," the product and perhaps, at the same time, the foun- dation, of reason and thought. Despite the superficial two-dimensional "car- toons" drawn by ethnographers, Obenga exhorts his readers to recognize the "deep, direct and immediate bonds" of African art with "la vie veritable"-real or true life-through "thought, wisdom, and an attempt to answer a radical ques- tioning." He uses comparative linguis- tics to delineate the logic by which such an aesthetic may eventually be ex- pressed in plastic form, through notions of "the 'beautiful,' the 'true' and the 'ugly' " among Bantu-speaking peoples (1984:61-67). At first, Vansina and Obenga seem to be working from similar perspectives, for Vansina states that artistic "style is like grammar: everything hangs together to a large extent by common rules"; and insofar as this is true, then "style. .. is a total phenomenon" (1984:82). The dif- ference between the two writers' posi- tions lies in the degree to which Vansina is using such terms figuratively. Bantu people may have a linguistic base in common, but that is all. The "grammar" to which Vansina alludes is a set of rules for the localized styles that are associated with ateliers and particular cultures or that cross cultural boundaries as "style areas." Vansina, then, refers most di- rectly to form, while Obenga refers to meaning. From an art historical point of view, the formal solutions taken by Bantu art- ists may be recognized as forming style areas, but these are of far smaller span than all of Bantu Africa. An approach identifying them might rely upon the morphological analysis of objects. Daniel Biebuyck (1985) has recently reviewed the work of Frans Olbrechts and his stu- dents working toward just such an un- derstanding of the arts of southwestern Zairian peoples. Obenga's points should not be lost, however. As Luc de Heusch has re- marked, "The notion of style extends beyond mere physical description." Art by Bantu peoples such as the Tabwa of southeastern Zaire and northeastern Zambia is articulated according to a "coherent plan," a "vast system of for- mal transformations... from a canoni- cal model which is, very precisely, at the origin of an overarching 'style' " that links the thought and art of people throughout Bantu Africa. De Heusch's own structuralist studies of Bantu myth demonstrate the fruitfulness of theory al- lowing one a wide view, over hundreds of kilometers and among scores of peoples, of a logic underlying languages held in common.1 Steps toward an un- derstanding of how such logic is repre- sented in plastic form, and of whether or not, then, there is a "Bantu art," might begin through case studies such as the following. The Tabwa (or Taabwa) are a Bantu- speaking people closely related linguisti- cally, culturally and historically to the Bemba cluster to their south, to the Luba-related peoples to their west and northwest, and to some lacustrine peoples along the eastern shores of Lake Tanganyika. Tabwa philosophy is based upon dialectic. At a first order, this can be perceived in elemental oppositions such as light and dark, up and down, right and left, hot and cold, wet and dry, male and female, and, ultimately, good and evil. These are established in Tabwa origin myths told by narrators portray- ing the universe. They describe a chaotic-or at least an inchoate-world to which change is introduced, leading to the universe as known by the audi- ence. Protagonists for such myths em- body one side or the other of the op- posed pairs, and are often in conflict with each other. De Heusch's well- known discussion of the Luba "drunken king" (1972/1982a) is an example of this, as Nkongolo Mwamba, the lord of every excess, is confronted and eventually de- feated by Mbidi Kiluwe and his son, avatars of balance, harmony, and good. Yet the dialectic is more complex, for each hero not only represents one side of the opposed pair, but also, as in the prin- ciple of yin-yang, embodies something of the opposite's characteristics. So it is with Nfwimina, the Tabwa ver- sion of Nkongolo Mwamba, the Luba "drunken king." Nfwimina, like Nkon- golo, is manifest in an immense serpent that breathes forth the rainbow, thus drying the rains and the lands upon which they fall; and in doing so is a solar serpent and hero of the dry season. As the dry season progresses and people reap what they will of the dried grasses and other available natural resources, they look forward to the communal hunting parties called kitumpa, when they will burn the bush. It is at such times that Nfwimina reappears. The fires, whipped by winds from the cardi- nal directions, burn toward a blazing center, trapping game animals there. As this circle closes, a column of smoke rises that is said to be Nfwimina standing on the tip of its tail. The horizontal phenomenon of contracting flames pro- duces and becomes a vertical shaft of smoke. In this transformative instant, life is interrupted, the wild is subjected to cultural process, beasts become meat, and the raw is cooked. Equally important are the changes of longer term. At this moment the smoke of the bushfires- Nfwimina, that is-is said to "cause the clouds to build" and to "clean the moon," allowing the first rains of the new season to fall. Nfwimina, then, is not a simple hero of the dry season, but 1. DOUBLE-FACED FIGURE, FRONT AND BACK VIEWS. WOOD, 76.8cm. BARRY KITNICK COLLECTION.

THE "FACE-OF-THE CROSS" SCARIFICATION PATTERNS ON THE FACES, THE ELABORATED BODY MIDLINE, CIRCLET AROUND THE WAIST, AND V-SHAPED DESIGNS ACROSS THE BREAST AND BACK, LEADING TO CIRCLES AROUND THE BICEPS, ARE SIMILAR TO SCARIFICATION ON MANY TABWA FIGURES (SEE ROBERTS &amp; MAURER 1986). TWO FEATURES OF SCARIFICATION ARE UN- USUAL: THE MARKING OF THE MULALAMBO BODY MID- LINE ON THE BACK OF THE SCROTUM AND PENIS, AND THE RING OF A SIMILAR CICATRIZATION DESIGN AROUND THE BASE. THE LINE ON THE SCROTUM, CALLED KISHONO (SEAM), CONTINUES THE THEME OF DUALITY REFLECTED IN THE BODY MIDLINE AND JANUS FACES.

THIS FIGURE WAS AMONG OBJECTS SEIZED BY EMILE STORMS'S MEN WHEN THEY SACKED TABWA CHIEF LUSINGA'S VIL- LAGES NEAR MPALA AT THE END OF 1884; IT WAS DAM- AGED WHEN LUSINGA'S KIN SET FIRE TO STORMS'S FORT THE FOLLOWING YEAR. THERE WAS A MEDICINE BUNDLE IN THE CAVITY IN THE TOP OF THE HEAD, AND BEADS AND AMULETS HUNG FROM THE ARMS. THE BLOCKY, ANGULAR FORM OF THE BODY, ACCEN- TUATED BY THE INCISED SCARIFICATION ON THE BELLY, AND THE ABSTRACT HIPS, LEGS, AND GENITALS, ARE UNUSUAL FOR TABWA SCULPTURE, BUT NOT UN- KNOWN. THE STYLE OF THE FACE IS RELATED TO THAT OF THE FAMOUS FIGURE OF CHIEF LUSINGA AT THE MRAC AND TO SEVERAL OTHERS COLLECTED BY STORMS OR BISCHOFF AMONG THE TONGWE ACROSS LAKE TANGANYIKA, WHO TRACE COMMON ORIGINS WITH THE TABWA. THE PROMINENT ALMOND-SHAPED EYES APPEAR ON SOME TABWA FIGURES MADE NOW (SEE ROBERTS &amp; MAURER 1986: 224, 230). rather an agent of change (see Roberts 1980:203-322). Tabwa have a generic term, mulalambo, that refers to the lines of demarcation that define the symmetry of the uni- verse. One example is Nfwimina, the serpent that connects earth and sky when it stands on its tail or breathes forth the rainbow. The Milky Way is another mulalambo; Tabwa say it "splits the sky in two." The watershed called Mwila that runs roughly north-south along the ridge of mountains paralleling Lake Tanganyika is a mulalambo too: it is said to be a "path that crosses no stream," and headwaters along Mwila flow eastward into the lake, or westward into the Luvua (tributary of the Zaire River). Yet another mulalambo is the human body midline, or linea nigra of Western biomedical jargon. This faint line can be seen on most people's bellies, especially below the navel, and is most obvious during preg- nancy, when the combination of a woman's abdominal stretching and hormonal changes makes the concentra- tion of melanin stand out like a virtual track leading from belly to vagina. Pre- colonial Tabwa perfected their bodies by elaborating the mulalambo body midline with scarification. It is a feature of many Tabwa ancestral figures (Fig. 1) as, with great economy (often a single line of raised cicatrices), reference is made to some of the most complex and perplex- ing conundra of the Tabwa physical and social universes.2 The mulalambo body midline defines the symmetry of the body, dividing right from left. Different cultural values are assigned these two, as is the case in most societies, our own included (e.g., "left," in Latin sinister, bears obvious cultural baggage). Tabwa associate the left with the west and death, and assign it female symbolism; the right is "right," east, birth, and male. The midline divides these, which are symmetrical but op- posed. The same line connects head and loins. Tabwa, like Fipa and other neighbors, associate the former with in- telligence, wisdom (or intelligence im- parted), leadership (intelligence directed to a problem), and maleness. The loins are the seat of fertility and are associated with lack of restraint and femaleness.3 The one line, then, refers to four points, and has as its own center the navel, ves- tige of birth and point of origin for par- ticular identity. (One's secret "name of the navel," jina la kitofu, is uttered only with the greatest care and respect.) Finally, each of these opposed pairs is joined in the greater whole of the human body of which they are constituent parts. Ir this way, the dialectic is completed, yet the tension between the contradictory prin- ciples, even as mediated by an encom- passing whole, remains. Earlier Tabwa used the "tegumentary language" of their body arts to represent this tension and the potential for trans- formation or transition implicit in it.4 Ac- cording to one early account, Tabwa women sometimes shaved their heads leaving two stripes of hair at the top, one on either side. Colors were rubbed into these stripes. Camwood powder and oil made one "red like a war flag"; chalk mixed with oil made the other white. The Swahili verb used to describe this pro- cess in a turn-of-the-century document is kuandika: like the Tabwa verb for "to scarify" (kulemba), it has been taken to mean "to write," since the introduction of literacy. Purposeful communication through such arts could not be more ob- viously conveyed. Red signals aggres- sion and violent change; white, peace and harmony. A woman would affect this hairstyle when someone, especially a chief, died; when there was active con- flict in the community; or when she was taking food to her in-laws. In other words, the woman's body and being were perfected to represent the transi- tion and its perils experienced by a com- munity suddenly left without its leader or divided by conflict, or by a woman undertaking the precarious business of dealing with in-laws of a clan and lineage different from her own. The hairstyle it- self was called busule, from a verb refer- ring to tipping or turning over; as a noun, Tabwa used it to refer to the appli- cation of powdered medicines to the head as a kind of healing or purification at times when divisiveness threatened to turn life "upside-down."5 The division of the human body into opposed poles to either side or at the end of the elaborated midline reflects the way the physical universe is understood. As Emile Durkheim wrote, "They have not conceived of the world in their own image any more than they have con- ceived themselves in the world's image: they have done both at the same time" (1969:103). The mulalambo body midline is like the Mwila watershed, which runs from north ("down," according to Tabwa) to south ("up"), toward the cavern of Kibawa, the great chthonian spirit that keeps Tabwa dead. This cavern is a point of turnaround at the end of what Tabwa say is an "endless" line of demarcation. The spirits of the dead go there along Mwila, but they can return as well, along the same "path that crosses no streams," to appear as dreams and eventually to be reborn as grandchil- dren. Death, then, is both an end and a beginning. Kibawa's cavern, locus for such transformation, was visited by ear- lier Tabwa as an oracle and is a place of resolution and solution. The cause of some difficulty is identified and a course is set toward re-establishing social har- 28</page><page sequence="4">3. DOUBLE-FACED HALF-FIGURE, FRONT AND BACK VIEWS. WOOD, 27.9cm. MRAC. A MEDICINE BUNDLE ENCLOSED IN STRIPED EUROPEAN CLOTH IS IN A CAVITY IN THE TOP OF THE HEAD. TWO SETS OF ARMS MAKE THIS FIGURE UNIQUE IN TABWA SCULPTURE.

THE MALE ON THE OTHER SIDE HAS A BEARD, A MORE UPWARD GLANCE THAN THE FEMALE, NO ABDOMINAL SCARIFICATION, AND NO OBVIOUS GENITALS. HALF-FIGURES ARE TYPICAL OF TABWA TWIN FIGURES, BUT THE JANUS FACES AND MEDICINE BUNDLE OF THIS OBJECT EXCLUDE IT FROM THAT CATEGORY. THE SCARIFICATIONS ON THE FOREHEAD AND BRIDGE OF THE NOSE ARE STILL USED BY THE TABWA. mony and well-being. The cavern is a place "up" and to the south, as are the direction of one's head in sleep and the chief's house in a traditional Tabwa vil- lage; his residence is at the southern end or "head" of a long, broad avenue. The cavern is also "down," a reference to its being a geographical equivalent of the vagina, fount of birth. The duality of Kibawa's cavern is like that of the hero of the dry season, Nfwimina: it is a place of change, while the serpent is an agent of change. This ambiguity is to be seen in another phe- nomenon along the Mwila Divide. Along this path, it is said that one may encounter the vengeful ghosts of per- sons who had perished unjustly, the vic- tims of sorcerers. These vibanda or viswa, as they are called, are half-beings, di- vided down the middle; and as such, they represent injustice to be resolved. They are also of a set with culture heroes recognized by groups throughout the area, from this part of Zaire well into Zimbabwe.6 These heroes are associated with hunting and are divided down the middle, some with half of their bodies human, the other formed of beeswax. Such a multireferential allusion is, at one level, a reflection of elusive hunting luck. The one-legged or half-wax figures, called some variant of "Luwe," are said to ride the shoulders of a lead game ani- mal such as an eland, directing it and the herd toward human hunters who show proper respect to this spirit of nature. More significantly, they represent an ancient conception of the paradox of op- posed parts important to the logic of con- flict resolution and to the essence of political power. This is most clear in the figure of Mbidi Kiluwe, the Luba culture hero and founder of state political or- ganization. The Sanga, a Luba-related group in south-central Zaire, regard the trickster Luwe (said to determine hunt- ing luck, as noted above) as "Bili Kiluwe... the great Mukunda hunter," where "Mukunda" is a clan name (Gre- visse 1956:100-105). Northern Luba have reported that Mbidi's well-known east- ern origin was a village called Membe, "probably situated on the Moba River, 4. DOUBLE-HEADED FIGURE. WOOD, IRON, MEDICINAL MATERIALS, 45cm.

The word membe may refer to salt or to the male genitals, or it may be some- one with only one eye.7 Such a person represents the mediated union of sight and blindness, light and darkness, per- ception and ignorance, and is a fitting image for the group of divided trickster culture heroes of which Mbidi Kiluwe is a member. Finally, when Mbidi left Membe to head westward toward his fateful encounter with the "drunken king," he followed Mwila, the mulalambo watershed or divide, as the direct path "that crosses no streams" from the Moba region to the Lualaba lakes. That his son would be known as "the divider of streams" perhaps reflects this or the re- lated aversion of Luba chiefs to crossing streams. By following Mwila, Mbidi Kiluwe passed by Kibawa's cavern; he is praised by eastern Luba as "Sultan of Kibawa" in recognition of this and of his affinity with the nature of the oracle there, where truth and falsehood are ne- gotiated (Womersley 1984:9, 13).8 These notions of duality represented in half-beings, body midlines, and di- vides are the core of a philosophy shared among Bantu-speaking peoples throughout the region; Luc de Heusch (1982b) discusses a wide range of related phenomena and beliefs among groups of Central and Southern Africa. The elabo- rated midline seen on Tabwa ancestral figures is but one representation of this core concept. Another is the small number of Janus-faced or double- headed wooden figures, staffs, and other Tabwa objects that Evan Maurer and I have been able to trace in our re- search (Roberts &amp; Maurer 1986:219-78). 5.

IN- STITUT DES MUSEES NATIONAUX DE ZAIRE, LUBUMBASHI. COLLECTED NEAR MOBA, 1968. THE HEAD ON THE OTHER SIDE HAS A SIMILAR PLUNGING CHIN LINE. THE FIGURE SLIDES ALONG THE CORD, ONE OF SEVERAL SORTS OF DIVINATION ORACLES USED BY THE TABWA. Only two Tabwa full-figure ancestral statuettes with Janus faces are known. One (Fig. 1) is similar to several other fig- ures now in Western collections, except for the double face; while the other(Fig. 2), collected by Emile Storms in 1884-85, is stylistically related to several Janus- faced objects in European collections. One of these latter (Fig. 3) is a half- figure. Two others (Figs. 4, 5) are double-faced heads atop pierced cylin- ders of wood. Of two other Janus-faced objects collected by Storms, one (Fig. 8) has a bushbuck horn set tip downwards in the matrix of a medicine bundle placed between the two faces, while the other (Fig. 7) has four simulated duiker-horn medicine bundles carved in the wood, two on each side, separating the nearly complete heads. All objects mentioned so far have magical medicines fitted into cavities in the top of the head, between the faces; or they are carved to represent this feature. Yet another Janus-faced ob- ject (Fig. 6) is highly abstract, with the double faces reduced to a mere jawline angle; this object is threaded on a cord as a string oracle that slides up and down and "snags" to indicate positive re- sponse to a question posed. Finally, two staffs (Figs. 9, 10), a magical whisk (Fig. 12), and two headrests (Figs. 11,13) have Janus-faced heads or partial figures that face in opposite directions, as Janus faces do. All of these objects are powerful "pro- cess art," embued with magic to effect transition from one social state to another.9 The duality of the faces is a specific reference to change. Just as Janus was the Roman god of gates, doorways, and the new year (hence, "January"), so these objects are a physi- cal representation of the threshold be- tween past and future (the faces looking either way, backward and forward), mediated by the present in the form of a bundle of magical medicines in most of these sculptures, and in the divination processes served by others. These ob- jects bespeak the duality of the universe and of the human body, as indicated by the mulalambo lines of demarcation, and bring such ideas to bear on the everyday problems of social life-of "la vie veri- table" about which Theophile Obenga writes so eloquently. The tall, long-necked wooden figure (Fig. 1) is stylistically unique among known Tabwa sculpture. The figure is portrayed "betwixt and between," one face pointing to the front, the other to the back. 10 While most figures represent an- cestors and were kept by lineage elders (including but not limited to chiefs), some apparently represented famous ng'anga practitioners of divination and magic. Diviners observed in the early 1880s used wooden figures during their seances, a practice followed to this day by some Tabwa ng'anga. I' These lend an 30</page><page sequence="6">ancestral presence to the process of de- termining truth and setting a course of action. No details as to the exact provenance of this object are known, but one can hypothesize that it represents such a practitioner, to whom cases of affliction were brought for comprehen- sion and resolution. Diviners help their supplicants to recognize what events in their complex pasts may be the cause of present misfortunes, so that actions may be taken to effect a transition to happier futures. Their profession, then, is to look backward and forward in time, as they define or-as often-redefine the course of history. The other full figure (Fig. 2) was col- lected by Emile Storms in late 1884 or early 1885, when his men sacked the vil- lages of Tabwa chiefs Lusinga and Kan- sabala. It is clearly similar in style to other sculpture seized then. Like those objects it contains a magic bundle in the top of its head, and it once bore beads and other substances around its waist. 12 Its style, and probably its purpose as well, are reflections of Luba-influenced ("Luba-ized," to use an older term) people to the west, among whom Lusinga lived before his fateful confron- tation with Storms (Roberts 1986:16-19). Four double-faced objects on colum- nar bases were collected by Storms, and may have been related in function. Two smaller ones (Figs. 7, 8) have a flared or a spool-shaped composite form below the double faces, while the two larger ones (Figs. 4, 5) have Janus-faced heads atop straight-sided, pierced cylinders. The former figure (Fig. 4) once had a bushbuck horn set tip-downward into the medicine bundle in the top of its head as well as a beaded necklace with what looked like magical charms attached. Now only the medicine bundle in the head, and another set into a ventral cav- ity, remain. A similar object collected by Paul Reichard of the German East Afri- can Expedition and now in the Museum fur Volkerkunde, Berlin, in all likelihood was obtained when Reichard's men joined Storms's in defeating Chief Lusinga in December, 1884. The Reichard piece has a medicine bundle in the top of its double-faced head; and its torso con- sists of a long, slotted cylinder without medicines (Fig. 5). Lusinga moved to the shores of Lake Tanganyika after spending some years to the west, near the chiefdom of his fellow "Bushpig" or Sanga clansman, Kyombo. He brought with him Kyombo's Luba- influenced customs and regalia of con- solidated chiefship and royalty, which included the four objects on columnar bases. These may have been used in the cross-ethnic Bagabo society of ritual spe- cialists, who could make rain and regu- late society by administering the mwavi poison oracle to suspected sorcerers or by sending lions or visanguka lion-men against the wicked. This latter capacity is attributed to Chief Lusinga, while the first written description of Bagabo out- lines practices among Chief Kyombo's Luba-ized Tabwa, among whom Lusinga once lived.13 Many symbols, emblems and forms of sculpture were important to Bagabo rites, with a central focus being a post topped by a carved human head into which a medicine bun- dle and downward-pointing bushbuck horn were inserted. Bagabo drew its powers from contact with ngulu earth spirits, and these wooden figures were associated with particular ngulu. Well- known Hemba examples of objects hon- oring Kabwelugulu, the most famous of these earth spirits, have appeared in re- cent exhibitions in the West (e.g., see Van Geluwe 1981:223-25).14 Alternatively, these objects (Figs. 4, 5, 7, 8) may be examples of a different but related form of sculpture used by Kyom- bo's people at the turn of the century, called kalunga. These, too, were as- sociated with earth spirits and were im- portant objects of process art. An infu- sion of the magical medicines placed in the head of the kalunga would be drunk as a protection against grave illness or the menace of enemies. At the rising of each new moon, the possessor of a kalunga figure would honor the spirit by pouring water mixed with white flour over it, and by painting his own right cheek crimson with camwood and left cheek white with kaolin.

The two colors, representing opposed paradigms (violence versus peace being an obvious pair), are an ephemeral reflection of the duality of the kalunga objects' Janus faces, and of what they represent symbolically (see Colle 1905:79). The most significant feature of these objects is not the opposed faces, how- ever, but the magic bundle placed be- tween them, at the threshold dividing the figure's gazes backward and for- ward. Tabwa magical practitioners ex- plain that bundles of this sort, generi- cally called erizi, are "little worlds" (kadunia) or microcosms, constructed with great care from powerful elements of the physical universe (stones from great mountains, parts of ferocious beasts, artifacts from cataclysmic events like earthquakes or lightning strikes) and significant relics of human experience (bones of an executed sorcerer or of a person who has died abjectly in the woods, cloth from a chief's clothing, wood from a blind man's stick). These elements are used to reconstruct a little world in which ego and his or her people are safe from harm. Some magic bundles deflect evil and return it to mete the per- petrator the same affliction he would wish on others. The use of magic allows unusual perception, or "eyes," as Tabwa refer to the extended ken of practition- ers, to protect from aggressors and find a path through obscurity (ignorance) or obfuscation (deception). Perception, in turn, allows recognition and definition of order, both in the past (the cause of difficulty) and in the future (a course of redress). This is a divine province. The term kalunga, used by turn-of- the-century residents of Kyombo's chiefdom to refer to Janus-faced wooden figures, is the name of the most powerful medicines used by Tabwa along Lake Tanganyika. A kalunga medicine horn is used by diviner-healers called by the same name, most often in the plural, "Tulunga." These fearless men dare con- front the grisly half-being ghosts seeking revenge for unjust deaths, and they combat the most heinous of sorcerers seeking others' demise. The kalunga horn is set to pivot on the point of an iron spike inserted in a wooden staff, itself stuck in the ground. As the kalunga horn slowly turns, it points in the direction of danger to the practitioner who is ad- ministering a boiling-water oracle or some other device important to his tasks. The staff is decorated with two or three human heads carved into its shaft (Fig. 14).15 32</page><page sequence="8">Kalunga horns are filled with a compos- ition of magical medicines. The "activat- ing agents" (vizimba) include some of the most powerful known to Tabwa. They can be used toward positive ends such as protecting the practitioner from the at- tacks of sorcerers he would identify and persecute; but toward negative ones as well. Use of such magic is always contro- versial and subject to the forces of local politics: an accused sorcerer can be a vic- tim unjustly pursued, depending upon one's perspective. According to one Tulunga adept, the central activating agent of his horn is called kambwilungu, a word that may be a variant of the named earth spirit Kabwelugulu, mentioned above. What should be used, he ex- plained, is part of Nfwimina itself, the immense serpent that breathes forth the rainbow, and is the prosopopoeic repre- sentation of both continuity and change. Great practitioners of the past may have known how to procure a piece of Nfwimina, but his peers no longer do, he continued. Instead, they use kambwilungu. Yet even this is very hard to find, as its source is a mystical "blood-red animal the size of a rabbit." Because of the scarcity of such beasts, he and his fellow Tulunga adepts resort to a more proximate source: they trick a woman to whom they are giving viabiko fertility medicines, instead giving her an abortifacient. After she buries the abor- tus, they exhume the cadaver and use pieces of it in their magic as a transforma- tion of kambwilungu. The discontinuity they have effected through deceit is brought to play as active magic, through the process of symbolization (see Roberts 1983b for an illustrative case study). The kalunga horn, then, should contain an activating agent derived from Nfwimina, the serpent metonymically re- lated to other mulalambo lines or phenomena defining symmetry and change between opposed states of being (right/left and all these may represent). It no longer can, given the impossibility of obtaining the Nfwimina substance. In- stead, it contains something equally erful, something that represents inter- ruption, discontinuity, and change: a piece of an abortus. The power of such an element can be directed, as the kalunga horn swings the pivot of its staff, 11. HEADREST. WOOD, 15.5cm. MUSEUM FUR VOLKERKUND BERLIN. COLLECTED BY LT.

The word kalunga has other meanings as well, which bring this discussion back to the basic ideas held in common by Bantu-speaking peoples throughout Central and Southern Africa. Kalunga may refer to "the one who brings rain." One is reminded that Nfwimina, the ser- pent whose rainbow breath "dries" or ends the rain, can also bring the rains of the new season as it stands on the tip of its tail in the flaming circle of kitumpa bushfires. Kalunga is used by some groups as an honorific for a paramount chief; "rain" is a euphemism for sperm, and chiefs are "fathers of their people." More generally, kalunga may refer to "an idea of grandeur, infinity, immensity; a place where capacity is unlimited," hence, "the ocean" or "the great sea from which one does not return," "place of the dead," and, at its most elemental, "God." The verb -lunga may refer to hunting or to putting salt on one's food. One is reminded of the Luba culture hero Mbidi Kiluwe, the great hunter re- lated to half-being tricksters throughout the region, who hails from Membe ("salt, male genitals, one-eye") and whose son, Kalala Ilunga, slays the drunken king to establish a new order. -Lunga in these same central Bantu dialects is "to be united, attach, to put together, join, knot, fold over upon it- self," and the sense of infinite power, or divinity, lies in the unlimited capacity to discern, bring together, make sense of disorder, "be right, straight, even, level."16 Kalunga the ocean extends to the edge of the flat earth where it meets the edge of the celestial dome.

Kalunga the magic horn is a bringing together of elements of time and history to determine what has hap- pened to cause the disequilibrium in life and human fortunes that is brought for solution to the diviner. Kalunga the Janus-faced object, then, is a representa- tion of all these ideas, placing ego, through the composition of a magic "lit- tle world," squarely at the center of the universe of time (looking backward and forward). The remaining double-faced Tabwa objects-the string oracle, the magical whisk, the staffs, and the headrests-are variations on the same theme of duality i 12. MAGIC WHISK. PTEROCARPUS WOOD, BUFFALO TAIL, SKIN, AND HAIR, 66cm. MRAC. THE WOOD USED TO MAKE THIS WHISK, IDENTIFIED AT THE MRAC, IS THAT FROM WHICH NKULA CAMWOOD POWDER IS MADE. THIS CRIMSON SUBSTANCE IS USED IN A WIDE VARIETY OF CONTEXTS BY THE TABWA TO SIGNIFY CHANGE, OFTEN VIOLENT. BUFFALO (SYNCERUS CAFFER) ARE STILL FAIRLY COMMON IN TABWA LANDS, AND WERE ONCE AVIDLY PURSUED BY THE GREAT HUNTERS OF THE BAMBWELA GUILD. THE STRENGTH, VIOLENT TEMPER, AND SPIRIT OF VENGEANCE OF THE BEAST ARE INVOKED IN THE PREPARATION OF A MPUNGA WHISK SUCH AS THIS, TO KEEP AWAY SCOURGES LIKE SMALLPOX OR AGGRESSORS LIKE SORCERERS AND VISANGUKA LION-MAN TER- RORISTS.

The string ora- cle assists a process of historization, as questions are asked and the wooden fig- ure, gazing implacably either way, slips or catches on the string, indicating ir- relevancy or affirmation. The whisk, embued with powerful magic, is used to protect a practitioner or chief from lion-men, sorcerers, and others who would transform themselves theriomor- phically into agents of destruction. Whisks of this sort are laid in the door- way, on the threshold, to keep adver- saries from entering. As is the case for the string oracle, the whisk places the bearer in an eternal present, between a history of past events and future of po- tential action. It helps the person to realize positive progress through time, thwarting those who, through jealousy and greed, would interrupt such a course. The two Janus-faced staffs are as- sociated with great chiefs or diviner- healers, who are divided in social life as are the mythical protagonists like Mbidi Kiluwe and his Tabwa equivalents whose model of duality they follow. Both are persons at the cusp between good and evil, generosity and self- interest, wisdom and ignorance. Chiefs are deemed "fathers of their people," as Ij 34</page><page sequence="10">they lead and provide succor; but they are suspected to be the worst of sorcerers as well, for evil does exist in their lands, and they must know of and condone it. Similarly, great practitioners tread a thin line between positive and negative magic, and where they tread, to one side or the other of this line, is defined situa- tionally, depending upon one's point of view as determined by local politics. The faces of one of these staffs (Fig. 9) alter- nate a human with a bestial face, both horizontally and vertically; as such, the human figure becomes a beast, or both sides of a single reality uniting humanity and bestiality (good and evil, ordinary knowledge and magic) are shown. Finally, the two headrests with figures as telamones (Figs. 11, 13) are a repre- sentation of similar duality. Earlier Tabwa had elaborate coiffures, including the pendant hairstyle of these carvings, and they used headrests to protect them. 17 The two figures of each of these headrests face to the sides of the sleeper. Because Tabwa say they "always" sleep with their heads to the south, the figures of the headrests can be assumed to face east and west, with the person's head in between. Mulalambo lines of demarcation such as the Mwila Divide run north to south, dividing east from west; the mulalambo human body midline runs from head ("up," as south is deemed to be by Tabwa) to loins ("down"), and di- vide right ("east") from left ("west"). The headrest figures, then, are of the same idiom, as they divide the sleeper's opposed sides, right/left and east/west. The user of the headrest is in the liminal in-between. This may explain the sym- bolism of the telamon figures and the form of the headrest bases, hollowed into a cup (unlike those of all other known Tabwa headrests). Despite a total lack of information concerning these ob- jects, one can hypothesize that these headrests were used in conjunction with other Janus-faced objects or magic de- pending upon the power of duality, in Bagabo society or other contexts. As such, the hollowed base may have been used to drink some potion, perhaps the mwavi poison oracle. Sorcerers are ac- cused after divination, and Tabwa divi- nation is always associated with prophe- tic dreams, which provide the "pronom- inal structure" into which supplicants can fit the particular details of their own lives in order to gain an understanding of present misfortune. 18 In this, Tabwa div- ination functions via a mechanism some- what akin to astrology and the I Ching, better known in the West. Perhaps an earlier diviner used such a headrest while dreaming of a case of sorcery brought to him; perhaps as a conse- quence of such a dream, a particular per- son would be accused and forced to drink mwavi from the headrest cup, vehi- cle of the dream itself. Where other Janus-faced objects have medicine bun- dles between the two faces, here the di- viner's head is the "little world" where transformation takes place as he dreams, a process facilitated by other sorts of magic and protected by medicine bun- dles such as kalunga horns. In summary, Tabwa Janus figures rep- resent a local interpretation of ideas con- cerning the dual nature of existence im- portant to Bantu-speaking peoples throughout the region. They reflect a sense of time and space seen, for in- stance, in the Kongo cosmograms about which Robert Farris Thompson has writ- ten (1983), in which crossed axes bring ego into conjunction with divinity. They are related to the Janus-faced kabeja power figures or lagalla posts of the Hemba, and to the 'alunga masks and figures of the Boyo and Bembe, intro- duced to these latter by Mbote hunter- gatherers who also live among the Tabwa (e.g., see Neyt 1981:280-89, 307- 10; Neyt &amp; Strycker 1979:69-75; Biebuyck 1972). The figures are a different man- ner of representing the ambiguity of op- posed principles mediated by ego, caught between the two, that one finds in Tabwa tegumentary arts through an elaborated body midline or the balamzwezi "rising of a new moon" motif, or in myths in which culture heroes are di- vided down the middle, bespeaking in- security and vacillation between good luck and bad, wisdom and ignorance, justice and evil.19 While discussion of these objects and ideas will not end the debate as to whether or not there is such a thing as "Bantu art," they do exempli- fy Luc de Heusch's assertion that there is a "coherent plan" or "canonical model which is, very precisely, at the origin of an overarching 'style' " linking the thought and art of Bantu-speaking peoples throughout Central and South- ern Africa. Such art is, as Theophile Obenga insists, profoundly associated with "la vie veritable," in which, even for those assiduously following the rules of proper behavior and being, life is not al- ways pleasant and good. Rather, life is a chain of decisions and reckonings, as misfortune inevitably strikes. Ego is forever caught between opposing in- terpretations of events, loyalties to ac- quaintances, and truth itself. Ego forever tries to confect a better life through the use of magic, so that in his "little world," the righteous shall prevail. This never happens. Success is impossible by the very nature of a life always divided, ri- ven, and opposed. CD Notes, page 86 14. KALUNGA MEDICINE HORN ON AN IRON PIVOT SET INTO A WOODEN STAFF.

Faulty castings were numerous and the failures were costly; the results too were not comparable with the castings of former times" (1927:311) 9. The prayer is similar to that recorded by Rattray (1927:315) at the consecration of a new forge at Mampon, Asante. 10. In Dawu, a village located at the northern end of the Akwapim hills (near the coast), there is evidence of casting dating from the sixteenth century (Shaw 1961:60-61). The casting of cuprous metals also appears to have taken place at a seventeenth-century site near Asebu, a Fante village located near Cape Coast (Nunoo 1957:15). 11. Excavations in 1975 at the D2 site in the Dwinfuor (ar- tisans') quarter, Beo, unearthed roughly 500 crucible frag- ments dating from the late sixteenth or early seventeenth cen- tury (Posnansky 1976:4, Garrard 1980b:120). Archaeological work at Manso, the site of the ancient capital of the Bono state, revealed cuprous scraps associated with crucible fragments in a thirteenth-sixteenth century context (Effah-Gyamfi 1985: 93, 204). It is important to note that cuprous objects have been discovered in earlier contexts but these finds are not associated with casting. The earliest-a few copper wires-was dis- covered in an eleventh-twelfth century context at the Nyarko site, Beo (Crossland 1976:86). Garrard (1980b:121-24) has recently disputed Crossland's dating of this site, suggesting that the wires may date from as late as the fifteenth century. 12. See Garrard 1980b: 160-61 for a list of these sources. 13. The leading proponent of this theory is Timothy Garrard. See Garrard 1980a: 103-104, 1980b: 159, Silverman 1983:18-19. 14. For a discussion of the evolution of the kuduo and brass goldweights see Silverman 1983 and Garrard 1980a. 15. See Wilks 1982 for a discussion of the Dyula presence among the Akan. 16. At the present time it is not clear whether the Aburasehene is regarded as the chief casting specialist of the Takyiman state or only Buoyem. Conflicting traditions recorded in Takyiman and Buoyem make it impossible to determine the exact status of the Aburase stool. Despite the uncertainty, it is apparent that Buoyem does maintain an important position in Takyi- man Bono history. Its chief is also the Takyiman Oyokohene, chief of the state's royal lineage. In addition, Buoyem main- tains an intimate historical relationship with the villages of Tanoboase, the home of Taa Kora, the most senior Tano dei- ty (an old and powerful religious institution found throughout the Akan area), and Amoma, prior to the Bono-Asante war, the dwelling place of Bono Maaso's legendary Queen Mother, Dwamenawaa. The elders of Buoyem and Amoma recall that the village was founded as a refuge for the Bono royals who had escaped capture during the Asante-Bono war. It also was the hiding place of, and is now the repository for, the golden stool of the Bono nation. Interviews, Buoyem, February 10, 1980; Amoma, March 21, 1980. 17. See note 12, regarding evidence of casting from the thir- teenth to sixteenth centuries at Manso. 18. Garrard (1980a:361) recorded the term buramfo as one who works at a forge. In the course of my interviews in the Takyiman area various informants referred to these specialists as adwumfo (artisans), atomfo (smiths) and mpepewafo (a previously undocumented term for metal casters). 19. As documented by Gordon (1874:40), Rattray (1923:301), and others (Menzel 1968:21, Garrard 1980a:117-18), in- heritance among metalsmiths does not follow the matrilineal descent patterns usually associated with the Akan. Inheritance is based on a loosely structured combination of primogeniture and patrilineal descent. A smith's property and stool (if he is a chief) are usually inherited by his son, his brother, or his brother's son. 20. Interview, Buoyem, February 10, 1980. Several months later I asked the Asantehene's chief goldsmith if he had heard of the sansafo. He replied that there used to be some working for the Asantehene but that they were now "extinct." San- safo were beaten-metal specialists who produced gold leaf for covering state regalia, made wire, and were responsible for binding the deceased chief's bones with gold wire. Curious- ly, the Adwumfohene asserted that the sansafo did not make mforowa. Interview, Kumase, October 16, 1980. 21. A good example is found in Agyeman-Duah's (1963:1) recording of Asante Asumfuo traditions in which it is stated "that formerly there were three recognized chief goldsmiths resident in Ashanti, namely the Denkyerahene's goldsmith, the Tekyimanhene's goldsmith, and the Okyenhene's gold- smith. These goldsmiths no doubt were captives of war or prisoners taken to Kumasi by conquest of war, and affiliated to [sic] the Ashantis." 22. Denkyira was conquered by Asante in 1701, Bono Maaso (Takyiman) in 1722-23, and Akyem in 1742. 23. R.S. Rattray Fieldnotes, Royal Anthropological Institute Library, London, MS 106, p. 993. 24.

ROBERTS, notes, from page 35 Four years of anthropological fieldwork (1973-77) among the Tabwa of Zaire were supported by grants in aid from the Na- tional Institute of Mental Health (#1-FO1-MH-55251-01- CUAN), the Committee on African Studies and the Edson- Keith Fund of the University of Chicago, and the Society of the Sigma Xi. Subsequent archival research has been funded by a Mellon Foundation Faculty Development Grant at Al- bion College (1983) and a National Endowment for the Humanities Summer Stipend (1984). This paper is a further step in the research for "The Rising of a New Moon: A Century of Tabwa Art," an international exhibition sponsored by the National Endowment for the Humanities, with assistance from Sabena Belgian World Airlines. Dr. Evan M. Maurer, Director of the University of Michigan Museum of Art, is my project partner for this ex- hibition, and Mary Kuiawski, Curator of Education at the same museum, our close collaborator. Thanks are extended to them for support in writing this paper. Despite such generosity, I alone am responsible for the paper's content. For Bene and Kapiteni. 1. De Heusch's comment, quoted here, is specifically address- ed to the example of Tabwa art; see his introduction to the Tabwa exhibition catalogue (Roberts &amp; Maurer 1986: ix-x). His broad studies (1972/1982a, 1982b) are landmarks to an under- standing of a system of thought common to Bantu-speaking peoples. Luba and Tabwa vary in politico-economic history, and each group has exploited ideas (metaphors, themes) held in common, according to historical needs (see Roberts 1986). 2. See Roberts (1986) for a discussion of this symbolism, and Roberts &amp; Maurer (1986) for a catalogue raisonne of all known Tabwa sculpture. Perusal of the latter allows one to see how the midline is a significant iconographical feature of most ancestral figures, and of combs, bellows, and other objects as well, which are thereby given an anthropomorphic allusion. 3. See Willis (1967) on this symbolism among Fipa of south- western Tanzania, who share much culture and history with Tabwa. The male-centric viewpoint of such assertions is acknowledged and seems an aspect of Tabwa art, made by male artists, according to a male-centric ideology. 4. The phrase is from Zahan (1975); Tabwa tegumentary language is discussed in greater detail in Roberts (1986). 5. This material is from an anonymous, handwritten notebook in Swahili without title, pagination, or date, probably writ- ten around the turn of the century by a Tabwa catechist or seminarian, perhaps Stefano Kaoze or with his collaboration; it is now in a file with materials collected by J. Weghsteen at the General Archives of the White Fathers (Missionaries of Africa), Rome #803/121. 6. Harald von Sicard (1966) has reviewed this literature, but does not include Mbidi Kiluwe among related "Luwe" trick- ster heroes. De Heusch (1982b) discusses duality and half- beings in a number of Central and Southern African cultural contexts, and Zahan (1975) broaches a more general discus- sion of the topic. 7. Burton (1961:4) discusses Mbidi Kiluwe's reputed origins; dictionaries such as Van Acker (1907:47) and Goodall (1921:56) prove useful for etymology of terms such as these. 8. These matters are discussed in more detail in Roberts 1980: 465; 1986:26-29. 9. "Process" versus "statement" art is a useful distinction first drawn by Malcolm McLeod (1976), which is applied to Tabwa in Roberts 1986:10-16. Process art is associated with magic, ritual, and transformation, and is used to assist peo- ple in determining the courses of their lives through divina- tion, healing, and other active measures. Statement art is for- mal and conservative, and is associated with ceremonies meant to reinforce and glorify an existing political order. The flowering of Tabwa arts in the second half of the nineteenth century came as statement arts were introduced to add legitimacy to the growing centralized, "royal" political organization of certain chiefs engaged in the ivory and slave trade to the East African coast. 10. Victor Turner's work on liminality (1981:93-111) is cen- tral to this discussion, for it is he who has demonstrated the manner in which a person can be moved from one social state to another through the "ritual process," which includes an important moment when the initiate is "betwixt and be- tween" these two states. During this crucial phase, one ex- periences "the peculiar unity of the liminal: that which is neither this nor that, and yet is both," a moment of "primitive hypothesis" and "pure possibility" when alternatives to or- dinary existence can be contemplated and sought. 11. Storms mentions this (Jacques &amp; Storms 1886:87) and several other instances when he encountered Tabwa diviners using wooden figures. Object no. 152 in the Tabwa exhibi- tion catalogue raisonne (Roberts &amp; Maurer 1986:243) is just such a figure, used by a contemporary diviner in the area near Mpala, Zaire, in the 1970s. 12. The materials collected with these figures are shown in the plates of Jacques &amp; Storms 1886. A number of Tabwa ob- jects examined during the course of the exhibition research have been "cleaned," probably by dealers or collectors; while others (see Roberts &amp; Maurer 1986:149) were transformed by Tabwa themselves, when former magical ingredients were changed or remgved. 13. Pierre Colle (1913:601-17) was the earliest author to describe Bagabo, but because the Belgian colonizers con- sidered the society subversive and felt that its members us- ed murder and other aggressive means to prey upon the fears and "gullibility" of nonmembers, long administrative reports were prepared describing such nefarious practices (e.g., Van Vyve 1927). As with many early missionary and colonial documents, modern readers will learn more about the biases of the authors than about those these writers purported to describe (see Van Geluwe 1981:223-25). Tabwa lion-men and the terrorism against rival chiefs, missionary followers, and others during the late nineteenth century are discussed in Roberts 1983a and 1985. 14. These important objects have not been studied in the field, and the Bagabo society, like other important cross-ethnic associations in both precolonial and colonial times, deserves far more attention than it has received in the literature. Tab- wa had and still have a number of these important foci for ritual and artistic endeavor. One of these was Butwa (Roberts 1986: 35-36), whose initiates received a distinctive V-shaped scarification pattern carved into many ancestral figures, as in Figure 1. On Tabwa ngulu earth spirits, see Roberts 1984. 15. Kalunga horns are similar in form to kinkungwa horns of BaMbwela hunting guild members, set to swing and indicate the direction of significant game; and lilamfya war horns us- ed by southern Tabwa and Bemba. Several examples of the latter were exhibited recently in Margaret Carey's Bemba ex- hibition at the Museum of Mankind, British Museum. For a sense of the range of Tabwa carved staffs, see Roberts &amp; Maurer 1986:255-57. 16. A number of sources of information on these terms are reviewed in Van Avermaet &amp; Mbuya 1954:388. These same ideas appear in many monographs concerning Zairian peo- ples; on Kongo, for instance, see MacGaffey 1983:122-47. 17. Early explorers found that Tabwa coiffures were the most ornate of those encountered in East and Central Africa; several of their descriptions are in Grunne 1986:91-92 and Roberts &amp; Maurer 1986:203. 18. Tabwa divination and traditional medicine are discussed in the writings of Christopher Davis-Roberts (1980; n.d.). 19. The balamwezi or "rising of a new moon" motif is found on all manner of Tabwa art and material culture, and is a cen- tral metaphor of their philosophy, discussed in Roberts 1986: 1-3.

Material for this paper came from oral, published, and un- published archival sources. Of major importance were inter- views with members of Ile Asileke, Okelele, Ilorin, 1980; K.A. Ibrahim of Ile Magaji Are, Idiape, Ilorin, 1982; B.A. Yahaya of Ile Onileke, Ilorin, 1982; and Baba Elesin of Ile Baba Leke, Ile Agba, Ilorin, 1984. From the National Archives of Kaduna (hereafter represented as NAK and listed bibliographically in chronological order), the most useful reports were those by Lethem (NAK 1912) and Priestman (NAK 1922a). The major printed sources were de Beauchene (1969); Clarke (1938); Daniel (1937); Frobenius (1931); Hambly (1935); and Mischlich (1942). For the translation of the last source I am indebted to Mark Duffill. Yoruba titles, names, and terms are anglicized in this paper only to the extent that diacritics have been omitted. 2. Willett 1960:75; personal communication from Robert Sober, University of Nairobi, Oct. 12, 1981. 3. As quoted in Ling Roth 1968:26, and in Marquart 1913: xxxvi- viii, the latter with references to Dapper. I am indebted to Marion Johnson and Elizabeth de Veer for the translations of this last reference. 4. The Lander brothers were told that the Alafin was "brother to the king of Benin" (Lander 1832:176). 5. A reference to these brass pillars is to be found in Herman- Hodge 1929:68. Awe, however, suggests that the brass pillars may have been the work of the asude smiths of Old Oyo (1976:62). 6. lie asileke may be translated as "compound of bead- stringers." Ileke is the general term for a bead. 7. A baba leke ("father of beads," "master of beads") in the Magaji Are compound died in 1982. There are also bead- makers in the Osin Aremu area, Ofon District, near Ilorin, which is Afonja family land. The Magaji Are is the chief of the descendants of Afonja. Magaji is a title used often in Ilorin, usually for chiefs having territorial jurisdiction under the four baloguns, who control four of the wards in Ilorin Town. The Magaji Are, however, has his own ward, and is under no balogun. On the baloguns, see also Note 13. 8. Also illustrated by the fact the one member of the Asileke family decided, after stone beadmaking had more or less died out, to learn glass beadmaking at Ife, because beadmaking had been his family's occupation. K.A. Ibrahim reports that pride in their craft leads members of beadmaking families to adopt names such as Babe Leke or Omo Oni Leke ("bead- maker's child"). 9. An iwofa was a person who gave his or her services to some- one who had loaned money to him or to his relative. Such services were in lieu of interest, and were rendered until such time as the loan had been repaid. The iwofa was often a junior relative of the recipient of the loan. 10. This was made from palm kernel or palm nut shells, and was used for women's girdles (NAK 1922a: par.22; Leith-Ross 1929:15; Ojo 1966:260; Hambly 1935:432). Like lantana, this type of bead was probably also traded to Benin (Bradbury Fieldnotes, B.S. 68). 11. Daniel gives no indication as to whether his information refers only to independent or early settled beadmakers or also the beadmaking slaves later acquired. But given the areas in which the nineteenth-century Ilorin Emirate, once established, fought its wars, it is likely that slaves captured in these wars and brought home or purchased by beadmakers would have been largely Yoruba. 12. Interview with the Sarkin Gobir, Ilorin, April 23, 1983, conducted by A.I. Alensinloye and H.J. O'Hear; also Gavin 1978. However, the Emir has sent beads to other rulers. He is also said to use beads for his sons and daughters during their marriages, which may, perhaps, be seen as an example of increasing Yoruba-ization among the Fulani of Ilorin; this is also illustrated by the fact that the Emir's family now has its own oriki, or praise-songs. 13. "Balogun" is a title given to major war chiefs in Yoruba- land. There are four baloguns in Ilorin, of whom two (Alanamu and Ajikobi) are Yoruba, one Hausa, and one Fulani. Each of these controls a ward in Ilorin Town. Altogether there are six wards in the traditional town, most of them divided into subwards. 14. Although the Emir did not use the beads himself, he cer- tainly sent them to Benin, and gave them out as gifts to other rulers, visitors, and maybe to relatives (see Note 12). 15. In Bida, workers produced an average of three beads per day-that is, polishing, sometimes boring, and grinding to new shapes the "crude" or "plain" beads brought from the north (Nadel 1942:283). Information recently received from Michael Bellow, Assistant Registrar of Cooperatives, Ilorin and Niger Provinces, 1954-59, states that it took two days for an Ilorin craftsman to make a bead. 16. This may have been occurring also with respect to outside apprentices in the Ilorin pottery industry. See O'Hear 1983:186. 17. It is said that these associations also helped members in times of trouble, such as bankruptcy; attracted buyers for particular kinds of beads; and saw to the intermarriage of sons and daughters of beadmaking families. 18. Ten years later in the 1922 assessment report a figure of 851 was given. It is likely that the higher figure reflects a more intensive count (and therefore a more accurate one) rather than any major increase in beadmakers' numbers between 1912 and 1922, since differences of the same order are also found on comparing the 1912 and 1922 figures for other occupations. 19. Interview with Alhaju Sulu Gambari, Emir of Ilorin, Dec. 8, 1982. 20. References in the Benin sources to mysterious trips to Blorin by the Oba's representatives (Bradbury Fieldnotes, B.S. 21 &amp; 49) suggest a royal exchange of slaves for beads, although the present-day Oba and Emir say that Benin's exchange for beads was in kola, oil, and plantain (interview with the Emir of Ilorin, Dec. 18, 1982, which took place soon after the Oba had visited the Emir). 21. Bradbury Fieldnotes, B.S. 12, 346, 560, 561; also, inter- view with the Emir of Ilorin, Dec. 8, 1982. 22. Clarke (1938:156) says that the industry flourished until "about fifteen years ago." It was, however, still considered an important craft when Hambly passed through florin in 1929 (Hambly 1935:432). Perhaps it took some time for the decline to be fully appreciated. 23. NAK 1939-40. Two "trade" lists are included in this file, one giving 11 beadmakers, the other 13. 24. Information from Mr. Raji of Olowa's Compound, Offa. The beadmaker remembered by Mr. Raji was an Ilorin man, and bought his stone from Ilorin. 25. In the nineteenth century it was probably expensive: "...from Hausaland people...are taking potash and lantana, which is expensive" (Imam Imoru, as cited in Mischlich 1942:182; Mark Duffill's translation). It is possible that Imam Imoru was referring to the cost of the finished product rather than the stone. 26. Leith-Ross 1929:7. These imitation lantana were most likely to have been manufactured in Britain, but could have come from a variety of other sources. See Board of Trade journal 1930:563; Clarke 1938:156. See also NAK 1955. 27. Recently Mr. Bellow, former Asst. Registrar Cooperatives, has reported that although he went to great lengths to find a small hand or power driven drill, the craftsmen were not interested. Bibliography Awe, Bolanle. 1976.
