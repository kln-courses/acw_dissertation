<plain_text><page sequence="1">Paris The Biennale of I959, the latest brain child of France's enterprising Minister of Culture, M. Andre Malraux, has been greeted alternately with bouquets and brick-bats. Although it and the numerous satellite exhibitions which basked in the reflected publicity are now over, the potential importance of this new institu- tion in a city, where paintings seem to be produced at about the same rate as Detroit turns out automobiles, makes a retrospec- tive review worth while. The Biennale was launched impeccably, and Pierre Faucheux's transformation of that derelict section of the Musde d'Art Moderne, which has in the past added much gloom to the Salon de Mai and the Salon des Realites Nouvelles, into an ethereal white palace, offset only by semi- transparent greys and black, has been one of the artistic successes of the season. Within this setting, sculptors had less cause for complacency than painters: works as powerfully expressive as those of the English Caro, as ponderous as those of the American Voulkos, or as eccentric as that of the French Lattier could not be ignored, but the majority were displayed in such a way as to achieve a remarkable degree of invisibility. On the other hand, lighting of the painting was so uniformly excellent that it could never be quite decided whether the bulb flashing on and off in front of Hundertwasser's La tour de Babel perfore le soleil was the result of a technical hitch or a subtle device to add mystery to an already fascinating and enigmatic picture. The Paris Biennale is a young painters' exhibition, and the age limit of 35 has been heavily criticized. But since one of its major functions appears to be an exchange of ideas between the 470</page><page sequence="2">CURRENT AND FORTHCOMING EXHIBITIONS young artists of the world (with the icole de Paris now primarily at the receiving end), it can certainly be justified, and it also means that it is complementary to rather than in competition with the Venice Biennale. The relative degree of maturity to be expected could be judged this year from the section devoted to the 'Jeunesse des Maitres'. Here it could be seen thatwhile the expressionist Kokoschka could assert himself at an early age, Nolde and Mon- drian, who had to wait for the revelation of Fauvism and Cubism respectively, developed late, and surely only a clair- voyant could have foreseen Klee's later ouvre in the Pot of Flowers painted in 1906. In short, temperament and opportunity conditioned development to such an extent as to inspire caution when the accent is on youth, and both indulgence and discern- ment would seem to be called for. With the former well to the fore, even the Informels, here spiced by a dish of the enfant terrible spirit, could be enjoyed, and the amount of genuine creative talent which went into Favory's relief composi- tion could be balanced against the fact that he had distributed his kitchen utensils too obtrusively over the surface and that the whole thing threatened to be a frightful dust-trap. But the new Biennale is far from being a mere divertissement. The great revelation of the exhibition and the crux of much of the controversy has been the official sanc- tion given by most countries, not simply to abstract art, but to an abstract art divorced from any tradition prior to World War II. In this trend the French were caught badly out of step, and it was one of the most interesting phenomena of the show that, with the exception of certain countries behind the Iron Curtain, the largest block of figurative painting was contributed by invited French artists, who had to pass no jury. In a situation of this kind, it is obvious that a great national heritage may even be a disadvantage. Schreib, in the less obtrusive arts of pen drawing and engraving, managed to keep the flag flying for Germany in a sphere in which they have long excelled. But the very fine section of Japanese abstract art, which derived much of its strength from the fact that its roots went deep into an ancient culture, went unrewarded. On the other hand, Poland, where abstract art has been practised only since 1956, but where a revolutionary drive has given an impetus and purpose to its development, supplied some of the most original contri- butions to abstract art in the exhibition: Lebensztejn, who was awarded the Grand Prix de la Ville de Paris, here displayed works of remarkable vision, but with an underlying anthropomorphic suggestive- ness that is basically pessimistic. Origin- ality also won honours for the Yugoslav Petlevski and for the poetically evocative works of the Belgian Bert de Leeuw. Alternatively, awards went to those who had themselves accepted the fact that a new tradition came into being after 1945 and had studied recent developments in American painting. In this category, Trevor Bell appeared to have preserved his own personality more successfully than the Brazilian Manabu Mabe, whose syn- thesis of a variety of American sources also won a series of Laureates. Thus orientated, the aspiring young artist who hoped to exhibit in the Biennale of 1961, but who felt himself to be no Lebensztejn, might well feel eager to see what the young Americans themselves were making of Jackson Pollock's legacy. On this showing, he could have emerged very little the wiser. It is true that the three works by Helen Frankenthaler showed imaginative variations on lines laid down by Pollock, but Berger and Carmen Cicero were showing figurative work, Pritchard had some rather dry geo- metric abstracts, Rauschenberg was surely suffering from a Dada hangover, and in one case the disastrous effects which can result from the study of action painting were so well illustrated as to be comparable only with the worst of the Europeans. Admittedly, the American pictures were chosen with the object of showing diver- sity, but if the United States can actually reveal the development of a major trend in the work of their young painters, this would have been an excellent time and place to do so. Fortunately, a sense of humour still exists, and one of the most amusing fea- tures of an exhibition, which was never dull, was Tinguely's Stabilisateur mita-matic No.z5. This odd-looking product of its inventor's study of movement in space rotated in the forecourt of the museum to produce paintings on what looked like an outsize roll of toilet paper. These paintings go just one step further than anything yet claimed by modern art: by cutting out not only the intellect but also the intuitive faculty, the automatic element is allowed free rein in their creation. The results looked sufficiently familiar to give an edge to the joke. In an exhibition which was crying out for some purpose and stability, it seemed a pity that the organizers had failed to make capital of the fact that good abstract art combines admirably with modern archi- tecture. It easily achieves the necessary scale and can thus acquire a living func- tion. The enlarged photograph of Lars Bo's engraving which occupied one end of the Salle des Gravures did something in this direction, but the five paintings of assorted shapes and sizes which adorned the main staircase, although commissioned from a team of artists, could under no circum- stances be said to form an architectural scheme. The net result was that the large Rebeyrolle, although conceived as a unit, could not be seen in its entirety from any point; an attractive Fabien was lost on a narrow staircase; and the Biras had the misfortune to be all too visible from the vantage point for the young Rouault's Fille, and collapsed into nothingness on the spot. Perhaps the time factor did not allow for a more coherent scheme, but this will not apply in future. In looking for- ward to 1961, one can only wish the organizers every success in the difficult task of maintaining the Biennale at the high pitch of stimulation which has characterized its inauguration. If the Biennale implied a tacit admission that the Ecole de Paris was in need of a blood transfusion, the annual exhibition under this title at the Galerie Charpentier (till 31st December) does nothing to dispel this view. It does nonetheless have con- siderable subsidiary interest as an exhibi- tion of taste, since M. Nacenta has this year risked the possibility of civil war among the critics by inviting five of them to join him in the selection of the exhibits. Each item is not only the acknowledged choice of an individual critic, but is sup- ported by him in the catalogue - an idea which opens up interesting possibilities of piquant situations when it comes to re- viewing! With two eclectics, two suppor- ters of figurative and two of abstract paint- ing, however, the mixture is reasonably representative. On the figurative side, Claude Roger-Marx, more conservative than Georges Besson, has settled for estab- lished reputations, and includes Brianchon, Gromaire - weaker and more mannered than of old, Buffet in better vein, and Humblot at his usual level of reliability. Younger artists given a showing by Besson include Bardone (familiar from his show in the Marlborough Gallery this year), and Minaux, whose exoticism may be self- consciously naive, but still has power. To the eclectic M. Nacenta we owe the fine Venards and some formally impressive works by Andre Marchand. The abstracts bring us once again to the problem re- vealed in the Biennale, with Michel Seuphor holding the fort for formal ab- straction in the line of Mondrian and Malevich, and Jacques Lassaigne joining the post-war school of thought under the title of Dans l'dclatement d'un Monde. In spite of Vasarely's subtlety and Geer van Velde's lyricism, the Seuphor choice leaves a rather chill impression of a too sterile perfection. This is unfortunate, because the breakdown of all traditional formal concepts in works by Dumitresco, Istrati, and Vuillamy, arranged conspicu- ously near the entrance, produced results which led one reviewer to re-title the exhibition, not inaptly, as 'L'Explosition de l'1Ecole de Paris'. With controversy very much in the air, that militant opponent of abstract paint- ing, Bernard Lorjou, planned his exhibi- tion 'Le Bal des Fols' (Galerie Gaz. des Beaux-Arts) to coincide with the Biennale. This dynamic personality, who has in the past produced a series of vast compositions of epic character, introduced his 'Bal des Fols' by a series of studies showing remark- able insight into psychological deviations, however slight, from the norm. As a result, some of his characters appeared almost terrifyingly familiar. Lorjou's debt to Goya is a freely acknowledged one and 47'</page><page sequence="3">CURRENT AND FORTHCOMING EXHIBITIONS was very clear in a few almost mono- chrome studies, but the bulk of the paint- ings, including the group of large works which form the climax of the exhibition, were in colours reminiscent of Chagall's circus palette. In a dancing world presided over by an idiot this frenzy of colour heightens both the gaiety and the insanity of it. Lorjou considers that his paintings, designed for man and not simply for art's sake, need no explanation. His message is, alas, all too depressingly clear! Little need be said of this year's Salon d'Automne (Grand Palais, November), which was just as anti-Biennale as Lorjou, but expressed itself with less originality and power. It would be unreasonable to expect an exhibition of more than I2oo works to be full of masterpieces, but the general level here was so low that the recognition of works by artists such as Carzou, Genis, Bardone, and Humblot was accompanied by a feeling of incredu- lity. The housing of this exhibition could hardly be worse: chilled to the bone by the freezing atmosphere of the galleries and distracted by the intermittently visible and always audible Salon de l'Enfance on the main floor, this reviewer quite failed to warm to MacAvoy's portraits of Pope John XXIII in the way the authors of the Manifeste en faveur d'un Art intelligible had anticipated. Retrospectives of Jean Puy, Andre' Mare, Vera, and Steinlen did not suggest that a revaluation of these lesser lights was urgently called for. The Salon des Surindependants (Musde d'Art Moderne, November), asserting its independence of the tyranny of juries for the twenty-sixth time, succeeded on the whole in demonstrating that these pre- serve the public from much that is mere pastiche. The inclusion of three works by their president, M.Mendes-France, proved, however, that England is not the only country to have a distinguished amateur. A retrospective exhibition of works by Othon Friesz (Musie Galliera, November) contained a delightful sequence of some of the less frequently illustrated Fauve paint- ings. Friesz never divorced colour from form in the way that Matisse had dared, and his rejection of any form of abstract art could be anticipated, but much of his later work evokes a nineteenth rather than a twentieth-century atmosphere. The por- trait of Paquereau (49) painted in i923 is excellent, but might well be by a follower of Leibl, and the sentiment behind works such as La danse devant l'dmir (69) of 1927 is now rather difficult to take. Interesting one-man shows were held during Novem- ber by Singer (Galerie Lorenceau, rue la Bodtie), whose love of formal qualities deriving from Mondrian has led him to seek contemporary inspiration in the atomic plant at Saclay, and by the Japanese Domoto (Galerie Stadler, rue de Seine), whose application of action painting to a fundamentally oriental con- cept of landscape has produced works of remarkable evocative power.
