Nat. Hist., Mus. Pictorial 12, 1956) is out of print, and Rice and Kenyon's studies (Auk, 79: 365-386; 517-567, 1962) appeared in a journal that is unknown and unavailable to most Midway residents. Furthermore, Fisher and his students have amassed significant new data since these earlier works appeared. Mrs. Fisher's purpose is "to give a clearer picture of the life history of the Laysans to Navy personnel, their friends, and Mainlanders who have not seen the birds." In keeping with this purpose, her approach is avowedly anthropomorphic but with a sound factual basis. The form adopted is that of a life history of an individual albatross starting with the nesting of its parents and continuing through its first successful nesting ten years later. Achieving a satisfying blend of popular style and scien- tific information is a difficult literary feat, especially on the first attempt. Readers who have rigorously trained themselves to avoid anthropomorphic interpretations may be bothered by the frequent attributions of human-like emotions to the birds, and the attempts to introduce life history data through "human interest" situations often seem contrived. To this reviewer, the most successful writing is found in the latter part of the book, with the albatross at sea, in which the author gives her imagina- tion a freer rein than in those earlier sections that are bound up with local references and land-based situations. Of particular interest to most readers of this journal will be the information on activities at different ages during the first ten years of life and on the significance of the ritualized dance and the slight but evidently impor- tant sexual dimorphism. The Fishers have recently pub- lished (Micronesia, 5: 173-221, 1969) extensive data on age classes and activities of albatrosses that return to Midway, but to my knowledge some of the behavioral in- formation is not yet in print elsewhere. The book is illustrated with numerous black and white photographs showing many phases of albatross life his- tory, and there are two maps. Scientists will naturally prefer the Fishers' comprehensive accounts in journals, but this is the book for the Midway resident or visitor who needs an up-to-date source to answer all the usual questions about the life of these beautiful and fascinating birds.
