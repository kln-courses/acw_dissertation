This book is really the enlargement of a dissertation written for the doc- torate, and is appropriately recommended to the public in a preface signed by Roberto Ardigo6, whose doctrines are frequently quoted with approval, and who, we may suppose, has been the author's favorite professor. The specific aim of the work turns out to be the refutation of all philosophical systems, whether held in the past or current in the present, which are not positivistic; and this by showing that, like works of art, they have been constructed in their essential features by the creative imagination, and are without any foundation in fact, their real ground often being some subjec- tive interest. Expressed in his own words, the author's thesis is "The objective value of philosophical doctrines is in direct ratio to the dominance of perception and in inverse ratio to the dominance of the imagination" (P. 131). The nature of his undertaking calls for an analysis and a description of the processes of the imagination with a definition of its proper function in logical thought. He points out, therefore, that the imagination, even in its creative activity, can do nothing else than select from remembered data of perception, and combine them into new systems of thought relations. Among the anthropological factors which determine more or less the char- acter and quantum of the influence of the imagination upon thought, the author mentions sex, and affirms that "I in woman the creative imagination on the basis of emotion (a base affettiva) predominates, as in the savage and the child ''; which is proved "b by the fact that to the rational functions of the imagination woman is almost a stranger" (p. i9). Without question- ing that the emotional factor is relatively greater in woman than in man, we may remark that in America, where woman's life is hedged about by fewer arbitrary limitations than in Italy, she is not generally regarded as on the same plane of undeveloped intelligence with the savage and the child. It is recognized, of course, that the creative imagination plays a legitimate and important role in invention and in scientific investigation, a scientific hypothesis being in fact "a supposition constructed by the imagination with a view to deducing from it conclusions that are in harmony with real facts." But we do not find a full and clear exposition of the part the imagination has in syllogistic reasoning, and of just how reasoning differs from non-logical operations of the mind. The three stages through which human thought, according to Comte, must necessarily pass, namely, (I)</page><page sequence="2">502 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. IV. the theological, (2) the metaphysical or abstract, and (3) the scientific or positive, our author would replace with four: (i) the mythological, which may be subdivided into the naturalistic and the anthropomorphic, (2) the theological, (3) the philosophico-metaphysical, and (4) the philosophico- positivistic or scientific. Undertaking now to show specifically what role the creative imagination has played in the various solutions of philosophical problems, the author finds that in cosmology Creationism owes its force to its simplicity and its explanation by final causes, and concludes that it does not satisfy logical thought, which demands the explanation of fact by fact, and not by miracle." The doctrine of Emanation (as in Neo-Platonism, for example) represents a metaphysical synthesis dictated by an imagination that builds upon purely subjective data, relying on the introspective method and availing itself of " intuition and divination." The Hegelian dialectic owes its fascination in great part, he thinks, to its artistic symmetry and complete- ness. The Evolutionary Hypothesis, - and Ardigo' s formulation of it, in particular, in which the terms ' indistinct' and ' distinct' take the place of Spencer' s 'homogeneous' and 'heterogeneous' respectively, -has for its support the evidence of tangible facts, and must be regarded as ex- pressing all we can know about cosmology. Passing to the ontological problem, he contends that ' substance,' which has played so important a role in metaphysics, is a figment of the imagination and inadmissible in a system of positive knowledge, inasmuch as substance is not a datum of perception. Equally fanciful, therefore, are all the 'speculative' solu- tions of the ontological problem; whether some form of Dualism, which resolves reality into the two ultimate substances of matter and spirit; or of Idealism, which resolves everything into spirit; or of Materialism, which resolves everything into matter. In conclusion, the author defends the posi- tivistic doctrine of Ardigo, whose distinction between subject and object consists in calling the subject 'the autosynthesis' (i. e., the synthesis of sensations that come from internal organs) and the object the heterosynthe- sis (i. e., the synthesis of sensations coming from without), sensation being the common element that unites, without confounding, subject and object, consciousness and nature. Reality is therefore characterized as psycho- physical. But the psycho-physical reality is neither that Absolute which Spencer reached by a process of abstraction, nor an inscrutable substance of which matter and spirit are only symbols; but it is " the cosmic life itself immanent in all things." This, he claims, is the view to which in- duction brings us, and, although it may excite the pity of 'metaphysi- cians,' we have no right to go beyond it. The author's discussion of ethical problems results in his finding dogmatico- religious ethics, a firiori ethics (Kant's), and intuitional ethics equally groundless, all containing in fact arbitrary elements introduced by the imagination. In place of these doctrines, he proposes an ethics built by induction upon the facts of history and psychology. Even for the peda-</page><page sequence="3">No. 4.1 NOTICES OF NEW BOOKS. 503 gogical problem, he thinks Positivism has its own solution, the principal feature of which is the recognition of the rights of individuality.
