BURNHAM BRIDGEND (1) Aberkenfig: 44 base radiates down to A.D. 274, representing strays from a hoard found in the 1870s.1 The hoard now numbers c. 594 coins. Found during metal-detecting.2 CARDIFF (1) Cardiff Castle: 620+ radiate imitations ('minims') down to c. A.D. 280s, found in association with ferrous scrap during the excavation of a pit fill.3 (2) Trowbridge, land between Crickhowell Road and Willowbrook Drive (ST 2354 8036): following evaluation in 20054 an area of 0.48 ha was excavated, immediately adjacent to the alluvium of the Wentlooge Levels. The earliest Roman activity comprised several second- to third-century drainage ditches, one of which appears to define the settlement limits. A later ditch formed two sides of a large compound, within one corner of which a sub-rectangular ditched enclosure, c. 65 m long by 25 m wide, was subsequently created. This latter contained a rectangular spread of metalling, a small timber structure associated with iron smithing, and various post-holes, all dating to the late third or fourth century A.D. The fills of its ditch contained a much higher level of material than earlier features, including charred and waterlogged plant remains, animal bone, slag, coal, pottery, and a second-century copper-alloy enamelled umbonate disc brooch. Upcast from a ditch associated with the final phase of activity sealed the sub-enclosure ditch.5 CARMARTHENSHIRE (1) Dryslwyn: 13 copper-alloy nummi down to A.D. 367-82, found during metal-detecting.6 (2) Laugharne area: 2,366 base radiates down to c. A.D. 290, found during agricultural drainage work.7 (3) Llanddowror, Vaynor Farm (SN 2470 1417): the uppermost ditch fills of a prehistoric henge monument yielded pottery of the first to third centuries A.D. A four-post timber structure and a cremation burial set into the infilled ditch are probably of late Iron Age or Roman date.8 (4) Llandovery, Lanfair-ar-y-Bryn (SN 77145 35341): following large-scale geophysical survey in 2004 and 2005,9 seven trial trenches were excavated ahead of a proposed road 1 See CardiffNaturalists' Society Report and Transactions 11 (1879), 44-7; Bull.

A well-preserved metalled road surface was discovered in all areas, flanked by several phases of associated vicus structures, which had encroached onto the road itself. Within Trench 6 the three defensive ditches visible on the geophysical survey were all encountered, as was the associated rampart material and a series of inter-cutting pits. These are particularly significant as they indicate the existence of an earlier and larger playing-card-shaped fort, which had subsequently been replaced by a smaller fort, parts of whose defences are visible in the fields north-west of the evaluation area; the results are reminiscent of the evidence recently recorded for the two forts at Llandeilo,o0 only a day's march away.11 CEREDIGION (1) Roman forts and vici: as part of an ongoing Cadw-funded project, fluxgate gradiometer surveys were undertaken at Trawscoed and Erglodd. (a) Trawscoed: two further areas, measuring 80 m by 80 m and 170 m by 115 m, were surveyed to the north and east of the defences (FIG. 3),12 revealing a large number of anomalies, only a few of which can be shown to be contemporary with the fort. A linear anomaly, 5 m wide, at the north end of the survey, is best interpreted as the Roman road by-passing the fort along its eastern side, though it is only visible intermittently in the area to 10 See Britannia 37 (2006), 370, fig. 2. 11 Evaluation for Carmarthenshire County Council was undertaken for Cambria Archaeology by N.

Its junction with the road running east from the fort probably lay beneath the wooded area in the centre of the survey. Three areas of weak anomalies might represent rectangular buildings, though none is securely dated and alternative interpretations are possible. Numerous small, roughly circular, discrete anomalies are also visible. Those close to the road running east from the fort are reminiscent of the hearths or bonfires seen at other sites, and might represent activity associated with a vicus. Other such anomalies are likely to be pits, though a Roman origin is unlikely. (b) Erglodd: the geophysical results correlate well with the evidence of aerial photography and of trial-trenching undertaken in 1976-77.13 The successive defences are visible as a series of con- centric square or sub-rectangular anomalies (FIG. 4), the two wider ones representing defensive ditches while the two narrow outer anomalies are likely to be palisade trenches. The inner enclosure, which Davies identified as the earliest phase, has dimensions of 40 m by 32 m (0.13 ha), though only its northern half is clearly defined. The western comer is unclear and there appear to be two alignments along the north-eastern side, suggesting that the ditch was recut at some point. The 13 See both J.K.

(Plan supplied by K. Murphy, Cambria Archaeology) outer, Phase II, enclosure has dimensions of 50 m by 46 m (0.23 ha), with what appears to be a centrally-placed entrance through the associated ditch on the north-eastern side, though there is no corresponding break here in the line of either the Phase I defences or the outer trench. The ditch on the east side of the entrance is offset to the south-west by c. 5 m, though a faint anomaly suggests that it may have originally continued in line with the ditch on the other side. There also appears to be a connection between the inner and outer ditches on the east side of the entrance. All this suggests a degree of remodelling, perhaps to form a small annexe. The two palisade trenches are very close together on the north-western side, where they appear as a single anomaly, but elsewhere they are clearly visible as two separate features. A fairly clear ditch terminus is visible in both the Phase I and II defences on the south-western side, suggesting that there was an entrance here. Within the inner enclosure several faint linear anomalies might be the foundations of wooden buildings, perhaps of several phases, succeeded on the south-eastern side by at least one well-defined stone structure, c. 12 m by 6 m with a central division. The overlapping nature of the geophysical anomalies clearly suggests a multi-phase site of some complexity, occupied for a fairly long period.14 DENBIGHSHIRE (1) Ruthin, Record Street (SJ 1242 5818): evaluation in the centre of the medieval town produced a couple of scraps of pottery, one of them samian, mixed with metal-working debris 14 Geophysical survey by D.

Excavation across its line revealed an accumulation of up to 1.2 m of peat, sealing a well-preserved road, c. 5.5 m wide, flanked by drainage ditches (FIG. 5). This peat was shown to continue beneath the road for a further 1.2 m. The road foundation comprised a single layer of rough slabs of local slate, apparently laid directly onto the peat or original ground surface. This was sealed by a running surface made up of grey clayey silt containing small slate chips and occasional larger stones. Its upper surface was fairly flat, with a slope to the east ensuring run-off into the downhill ditch. There were no obvious ruts or signs of heavy wear, suggesting that the route was little used in the immediate post-Roman period and was soon lost in the peat bogs. A single wooden peg or stake was recovered from beneath a slab on the western edge of the road, presumably a surveying marker used in setting out the road line. The material for the road appears to have been obtained from quarry pits and outcrops on higher ground to the east. There were no datable finds. Its construction represents an interesting departure from the norm, in an area where a raised agger sitting on stable substrate could not be constructed.16 silt layer indicating METRES Roman ground surface 0 2 FIG. 5.

BURNHAM (2) Roman forts and vici: further fluxgate gradiometer surveys have been carried out at Caer Gai and Cefn Caer, Pennal.17(a) Caer Gai (SH 8775 3150): additional areas were surveyed in the interior of the fort and on its other three sides (FIG. 6).18 Within the fort's interior the only discernible features are two, or perhaps three, pairs of barracks alongside an internal road.

The one to the south-west of the road, which measures 48 m by 45 m, appears to contain a small central courtyard and to be divided into several ranges of small rooms, and is best interpreted as a mansio. The other building to the north-east of the road, which is represented by a mass of thermo-remnant responses, is probably a bath-house, though little detail of its layout is visible. Further activity was detected on the south-western side of the fort. A road running from the portaprincipalis dextra is faintly visible, on a slightly different line to the disused drive from Caer Gai Farm. A branch turns to the south-east and is flanked on its south-western side by poorly defined buildings. These have a different layout from the structures in the north-eastern vicus and may represent an area of small-scale industrial activity. Faint traces of the defences of a second annexe are visible to the north-east of the disused drive. The return of its defences is lost in the roadside activity. The survey failed to locate any trace of Roman activity on the natural shelf north-west of the fort, despite the suggestive evidence of aerial photography.19 (b) Cefn Caer, Pennal (SH 7048 0009): further areas were added to the existing survey on the north-west edge, including an area adjacent to the sewage works, and to the south-east in the field between the fort and the Dovey marshes (FIG. 7). The new area to the north-west provided FIG. 7. Cefn Caer: results of fluxgate gradiometer survey. (Courtesy of Gwynedd Archaeological Trust and J. Burman) 19 See R.B. White, Arch.

The earlier survey had identified a series of anomalies which were tentatively interpreted as roadside funeral activity. The extended survey revealed that they actually represent the edge of a further area of vicus activity comprising several buildings with multiple hearths. These are clearly different to the buildings in the vicus to the north-east and are best interpreted as industrial workshops containing small hearths or ovens. A side-road which branches off the main road runs to the north-east along a low terrace above a stream. It is flanked on its northern side, for c. 100 m, by buildings similar to those in the north-eastern vicus. The northern edge of the survey becomes progressively more difficult to interpret as it runs onto the slopes below the vicus. High levels of noise and small thermo-remnant responses, indicating hearths and other activity, extend beyond the end of the obvious settlement, but are disturbed by relict field boundaries and two large geological anomalies. The additional south-eastern survey area contains a double linear anomaly marking what was, until recently, the boundary with the Dovey marshes. There is, however, nothing to indicate any significant Roman activity in this area.20 MONMOUTHSHIRE (1) Undy, Undy Athletic Club (ST 43652 86869): a watching-brief on groundworks for a new football pitch uncovered a disturbed cremation in a black-burnished pot, set in a shallow hollow in the bedrock, to the east of a building. The pot, which may have been broken during ploughing, is datable to the second or third century A.D. No other cremations were found during the soil-stripping, although it is possible that others, cut into the bedrock, were not detected. The structural remains comprised the substantial footings of a building, 17.4 m long by 7.4 m wide, which had been built directly on the bedrock and boulder clay. It was divided into two rooms, one measuring 4.2 m across, the other 10.3 m across. There was no evidence that the building had ever been ploughed over, so the top of its footings were undisturbed. The complete absence of stone debris inside and outside the building shows that it was of cob construction. The foundations were composed of limestone blocks (often large), arranged to produce an uneven surface for the base of the superstructure, which presumably precludes the possibility of a large timber sleeper-beam. The lack of large quantities of pottery and other rubbish, together with the absence of hearths and other internal features, suggests that this was not a domestic structure. A coin of the usurper Carausius (A.D. 286-293) was recovered from one of the foundation trenches. Three other coins dating to c. A.D. 350-370 were recovered. Although there was very little fourth-century pottery, it is likely that the fourth-century coins were associated with the use of the building. Animal remains were mostly of sheep, with some cow and bird bones. Metal finds included iron nails and an iron knife.21 (2) Wonastow, Court Farm (centred on SO 48467 11130): excavations during groundworks for a barn confirmed the location of one side of the suspected fort, though it did not correspond with the cropmarks identified earlier in the year.22 Remains of a truncated rampart, two ditches, and a beam-slot inside the rampart were recorded. Most of the pottery belongs to the first century A.D. Two asses, one of Vespasian, the other of Domitian, were also recovered.23 NEWPORT (1) Bulmore, The Celtic Manor Resort (centred on ST 359 914): excavations ahead of the 20 The current surveys were carried out by David Hopewell of Gwynedd Archaeological Trust (with Cadw grant aid) as a continuation of the original project, in partnership with John Burman of Meirioneth Geophysical Survey Team who was carrying out private research.

(b) (centred on ST 3615 9154): masonry rubble and a coping stone were found, but no definite structures could be identified; the rubble may come from a building discovered at ST 3618 9155, which consisted of a series of small rooms with some evidence for several different building phases. The rubble within this building included a spread of tufa and broken box-flue tile, a broken sandstone altar, and a reused fragment of inscribed tombstone. (c) (ST 3623 9157): masonry remains noted in section comprised four butting dressed-stone blocks overlying a foundation of smaller stone, associated with a spread of broken roofing. (d) (ST 3625 9156): although no structural evidence was noted, there were suggestions of disturbed cremation burials. Outside the scheduled area, seven locations produced a mixture of structural and funerary remains. (e) (ST 3565 9122): at the western limit of development, on the crest of a low hill to the east of and below Little Bulmore Farm, separated from the main settlement of Great Bulmore by a shallow valley, structural evidence, which included walling and paving, was discovered. (f) (ST 3599 9130): a pottery kiln, cut into the hillside, and an associated semi-circular ditch, probably also serving as a levigation channel, were discovered on the hillside to the south of and directly above the settlement of Great Bulmore. This is the second such kiln to be discovered, connected with the production of fine wares, but it is of markedly different construction from the first, located 800 m to the east.25 (g) (ST 3599 9133): a small rectangular building was sited on the hillside c. 40 m directly downslope from the kiln. A terrace with traces of paving, likely to be associated with the structure, was discovered c. 4 m to the south. (h) (ST 3637 9144): a sunken, stone-built drying kiln was located toward the eastern extent of the new development. Immediately to the east were the remains of three almost parallel low stone walls, which may represent the foundations of a storage building. (i) (ST 3645 9151): near the eastern boundary of the existing golf course and on the lower slopes of the hillside, a sub-rectangular area, marked by a scatter of pottery and sandstone, possibly represented a workshop. Little evidence for a structure was apparent apart from the stone scatter. However, a short length of low-lying stone terracing associated with a distinct, rectangular, clean, clay-filled area was discovered adjacent. (j) (ST 3631 9158): an area containing cremation burials and paving was discovered c. 350 m to the east of the centre of the settlement of Great Bulmore at the base of the hillslope. The cremations lay close to the line of the Roman road between Usk and Caerleon. To date, they represent the easternmost burials associated with the settlement. (k) (ST 3592 9159-3604 9162): a swathe of occupation debris, mostly pottery but with some iron waste indicating industrial workings, was discovered on the floodplain to the north of the settlement, stratified under alluvial deposits. A spread of boulders forming a raised pathway is believed to have been a response to the onset of alluvial deposition, possibly to give access to an as yet unidentified feature closer to the current position of the river.26 (2) Caerleon (Isca): (a) Priory Field: geophysical survey provided extensive new information on the structures within the southern comer of the fortress (FIG. 8).

These structures were only partially imaged because of the modem metal fences on the ramparts. Within the fortress, the expected range of barracks stood to the south-east of the site, with eight individual barrack blocks imaged. The barracks were the same size as the Prysg Field examples, whereas the previous interpretative plan had shown them being 4 m shorter;27 as elsewhere, they contained 12 contubernia. Within Insula III there was a range of three granaries, each 42 m by 15 m. These had particularly massive walls and appeared to be enclosed by an outer wall or colonnade. Slight evidence for longitudinal floor-support walls was seen. The road between Insulae III and IV lies 30 m south-west of the predicted position on Boon's plan, making Insula IV larger than predicted. The explored part of Insula IV contained what is interpreted as the south-west section of a large courtyard building. This was particularly strongly imaged magnetically, so the room 27 See G.C.

The area south-west of the courtyard building was problematical and showed little evidence for internal division. Data from the north-west margin of the site were complicated by fences and modern debris, but confirmed the expected location of some components of the officers' houses.28 (b) 35 High Street (ST 33940 90542): evaluation opposite the Museum site, within Insula X of the postulated fortress plan, failed to reach the Roman demolition layer in one test pit, but recovered a coin of A.D. 330-348 and pottery from the top of this horizon in a second.29 (c) Glen Plas, Usk Road (ST 3395 9103): a watching-brief, prior to construction work near the north-east comer of the fortress, recovered Roman material from modem levelling horizons, beneath which it seems unlikely there was any further activity.30 (d) Geophysical survey and limited trial excavations were carried out in the area of the civil settlement, east of that investigated in the 1980s.31 (i) Millmead (ST 3425 9093): a rather slight wall foundation at right-angles to the continuation of the via principalis sinistra was noted, together with other activity of Roman date, but elsewhere the ground to the east of Cambria Close appears to be of recent alluvial origin. (ii) Uskside (ST 3438 9044): a second building was noted on air photographs adjacent to the building identified in 1990, but again most of the area to the east is of alluvial origin and has no trace of Roman occupation. (iii) ST 3505 9109: an indistinct parch-mark was also noted from the air, showing what appears to be a large rectangular building or complex of buildings in a marked bend of the river Usk, adjacent to a small inlet. (iv) Lodge Road (ST 3223 9054 and ST 3281 9107): two features, each consisting of a small square dark cropmark within a much larger square, were noted on air photographs in the area of the Lodge Hill cemetery.32 (e) Hanbury Garage (ST 3406 9031): evaluation revealed levelling deposits on the natural slope between the south-western comer of the fortress and the river Usk. A track or hardstanding with an integral drain, a robbed-out wall footing, pits and post-holes were located.33 (3) Kemeys Inferior, Abernant (ST 3713 9175): ongoing excavation located three of the likely four sides of the known cemetery and a further six inhumation burials.34 The layout of the cemetery, delimited by ditches, appears to be rectangular, at least 43 m by 34 m. The ditch, where undamaged, was roughly V-shaped, c. 1.3 m wide at the top and 0.2 m at the flat base, with a depth of up to 0.8 m. The quantity of cobbles and larger sandstone fragments in the fill, together with few silt lines, might suggest deliberate infilling. Finds included a shoe with 43 hobnails and fragments of a brooch. Only the lower parts of the grave-cuts had survived. Five had evidence for wooden coffins in the form of iron nails, while the sixth was probably a shroud burial.35 (4) Llanvaches: 599 silver denarii down to A.D. 156-157, found in a local greyware pot during metal-detecting.36 28 Work undertaken as part of Cardiff University's contribution to the work of the Caerleon Research Committee.

BURNHAM PEMBROKESHIRE (1) Herbrandston, Upper Neeston Farm (SM 8795 0745): excavation revealed a series of Romano-British ditched enclosures.37 POWYS (1) Caersws: (a) St John Ambulance Station (SO 0260 9186): small-scale evaluation prior to the extension of an existing building, on a site immediately outside the Caersws II fort, encountered a metalled surface which, by comparison with previous excavations in the area, is likely to be associated with the Roman perimeter road.38 (b) Station Road (SO 03013 91903): excavation and a watching-brief during the digging of foundations for an extension to the Spar Supermarket, within the core of the vicus, identified a general spread of Roman material and deposits across the site, together with a moderate amount of pottery. A large pit was identified in the south-east comer of the development area. It would seem to have been relatively deep, judging by the angle of its sloping sides. The differing layers of fill suggest that it was not filled quickly, as one event, but rather in smaller more sporadic episodes. It is likely to have functioned as a large refuse pit. Those contexts which produced the majority of the pottery can be interpreted as occupation layers from an area within the vicus. The spreads of gravel over much of the area indicate that this part of the vicus was perhaps not occupied by buildings, but may instead have been occupied by an open yard.39 (2) Roman forts and vici: as part of an on-going Cadw-funded project, further geophysical surveys were undertaken in the vicinity of three known forts or fortlets. (a) At Caersws I (SO 0420 9253), considered to be an early campaign base, the areas outside the north-west and north-east gates, with the greatest potential for the siting of extramural settlement, were tested but found to be negative. The fort's three ditches were identified, together with the entrances on the north-east and north-west sides, the latter protected by a titulus. (b) At Dolau Bridge, near Nantmel (SO 0190 6652), few internal and no external features were revealed, but the survey was able to locate the south comer of the defences, providing for the first time maximum dimensions for the enclosure. (c) At Clyro (SO 2286 4347) the survey focused on three sides of the fort and on the north-east extended over part of the defences and into the interior. At this point there were anomalies perhaps generated by ovens or hearths, and also an internal road or drain. None of the areas outside the fort provided any signs of an associated vicus.40 (3) Talgarth, Relief Road (SN 3766 5580): archaeological works prior to and during construction of the Talgarth Relief Road and Bronllys Bypass revealed a previously unknown Roman site, comprising a stone spread, which appeared to be a former surface, a stone platform or structure base, and several shallow gullies. Pottery dating to the second to fourth century A.D. was recovered from several features, together with fragments of brick and tile, iron objects and lead waste.41 SWANSEA (1) Gower: survey and excavation has been focused on elucidating aspects of the Roman landscape and settlement.

The rectilinear examples are all c. 11 m to 12 m long and c. 6 m to 9 m wide. One overlies another, probably indicating two phases of construction. A parallel survey of the adjacent part of Black Field identified a further three circular structures and two rectangular ones. Excavation of selected features showed that the archaeological layers were of limited depth and had been badly damaged by ploughing. The largest trench sought to examine the relationship between one of the circular structures and one of the rectangular ones. In the event the former could not be traced. The latter proved to be c. 16 m and at least 5 m wide, with two main chambers set at right angles to each other. Any floor surfaces had been ploughed away. Two smaller trenches suggested the existence of a further structure. (b) Llangennith, Lower Harding's Down Farm (SS 448 905): magnetometer survey of Blacklands produced traces of six circular and four rectangular structures, some of them incomplete, as well as a possible small banjo enclosure. (c) Scurlage, The Bank Farm (SS 466 881): fieldwalking in Black Marles Field produced the larger part of a quernstone of late prehistoric or early Roman date and a fragment of Roman roof- tile. Geophysical survey over an area of 4,800 sq m identified six circular features, four in the extreme north-east comer of the field, with two more to the west. Excavation revealed clay floor levels at a depth of 0.3-0.35 m, together with two post-holes and two stake-holes. A hearth had been built upon one of the floors. Associated charcoal produced a calibrated radiocarbon date of 3960-3770 B.C. at the 95 per cent probability level (OxA 14961), somewhat at odds with the presumed late prehistoric or Romano-British date of the site; this might be the result of using peat as a fuel. Later geophysical survey extended the coverage to 12,400 sq m and identified four more circular features in the western, central part of the field. Two rectangular structures were also discovered.42 2. SCOTLAND By F. HUNTER NORTH OF THE ANTONINE WALL ABERDEENSHIRE (1) Normandykes (NO 830 993): excavation43 of a long transect across the western part of the temporary camp uncovered four bread ovens, some used more than once. Other features are probably unrelated, and there were no datable finds. The camp's western ditch was not located, perhaps indicating an entrance, although the intermittent nature of the cropmark suggests erosion is a factor. (2) Kair House (NO 769 765): a further44 watching-brief in the north-east quadrant of the temporary camp found no trace of internal features.45 42 Geophysical survey at The Bank Farm was undertaken by M.

It is enclosed by a double ditch with 'parrot beak' terminals marking deep re-entrants at the gates. Upcast from the ditches appears to obscure the adjacent marching camp, suggesting this is earlier. Trenching on the west side of the camp confirmed that all three lines seen from the air were V-profile ditches, two with evidence of recutting; no evidence to confirm their Roman date was recovered, but it hints at a complex occupation sequence. A possible annexe ditch identified from the air near the camp's south-east corner proved to be natural. ANTONINE WALL FALKIRK (1) Bridgeness, Kinningars Park (NT 014 813): a magnetometer transect55 to test for any extension of the Wall eastwards from Bridgeness to Carriden found no trace of the Ditch.

The results did not produce coherent patterns of extramural settlement; a range of anomalies was recorded, of uncertain character, one probably a rectangular, multi-room building south-west of the fort. The lack of detail in the fort interior suggests timber buildings were not being detected. NORTH LANARKSHIRE (1) Tollpark, Westway Retail Park, Cumbernauld (NS 776 773): extensive excavations61 in the western part of the camp62 emptied some 230 m of the partly-waterlogged ditch; this was V-profile, up to c. 2.8 m wide and 1.4 m deep, generally with an 'ankle-breaker'. It had infilled naturally, with some later features (including a hearth) cut into the fill. Two entrances through the western side were found, some 7.8 m wide, with no trace of tituli. Waterlogging preserved a range of wood with toolmarks, but the only artefact was a wooden object with a mortice-hole. More limited investigation of the rather disturbed interior failed to reveal any features. (2) Westerwood (NS 760 773): magnetometer survey63 of parts of the fort and its surroundings detected little trace of extramural activity, despite field-systems and structures being known in the immediate vicinity from excavation.64 Within the fort, some north-south buildings were noted in the western part. (3) Dullatur (NS 7465 7676): evaluation65 of the interior of the temporary camps, to the north of previous work,66 found no related remains. EAST DUNBARTONSHIRE (1) Bar Hill (NS 707 759): geophysical survey67 to the south and west of the fort found a few anomalies, but little trace of extramural settlement. (2) Auchendavy (NS 677 749): further geophysical survey68 around the exterior of the fort found no trace of any extensive extramural settlement, although possible structures were noted immediately east of the defences. (3) Kirkintilloch: (a) Alloway Grove (NS 6695 7472): an extensive evaluation69 some 40 m behind the known Wall line found no trace of associated remains. (b) Peel Park (NS 651 740): geophysical survey70 of the park confirmed extensive disturbance to this likely location for a Wall fort.71 The extent of the medieval castle overlying the site was clarified; other anomalies may relate to the fort, including possible buildings, but interpretation is uncertain. 61 Excavations for Cumbernauld Retail Park Partnership were directed by R.

The stone walls survived three courses high, with extensive debris of flue-tiles and opus signinum. Some time in the second century it was reused for iron-working; subsequently a large, undated defensive ditch was dug through it. (b) (NT 025 807): relatively limited geophysical survey73 immediately south-east and west of the fort revealed little additional information. The fort and annexe defences showed clearly, but other anomalies did not form any obvious patterns, with little trace of the known civil settlement.74 CITY OF EDINBURGH (1) Cramond: (a)fort and bath-house (NT 190 769): three test trenches in previously-excavated areas within the fort75 confirmed the remains were in good condition and identified unexcavated deposits. Test-pits within the bath-house76 confirmed it also survived in good condition.77 (b) 42-44 Cramond Road North (NT 191 765): a sizeable watching-brief78 recorded no Roman remains in an area close to the likely line of the annexe, suggesting this lies slightly to the north.79 EAST LOTHIAN (1) Smeaton, A68 Dalkeith Northern Bypass (NT 343 693): complete excavation80 of a 50 m stretch of the temporary camp's western ditch showed it had been dug in sections.

SCOTTISH BORDERS (1) Dun Law, Dere Street (NT 465 568): two evaluation trenches82 in a boggy area where the line of Dere Street is not visible located the cambered cobble foundations of the road, surviving 7 m wide. There was no evidence of roadside ditches or kerbs, and no in-situ metalling, although a gravel and clay layer in one section probably derives from eroded surfacing.83 (2) Newstead (Trimontium, NT 56 34): an enamelled dragonesque brooch with central circular motif was found some years ago south-west of the fort.84 72 During excavations by Falkirk Museum on the Carriden estate sawmill, directed by Mr G.

DUMFRIES AND GALLOWAY (1) Carzield (NX 969 821): pottery, coins (from Trajan to Antoninus Pius), and a biconical lead weight were recovered some 150 m north of Carzield fort;87 they presumably relate to extramural activity or rubbish dispersal around the fort. The weight (127.4 g) has a punched-dot 'S' for semis (see p. 364). ENGLAND 3. HADRIAN'S WALL By BARRY C. BURNHAM SOUTH TYNESIDE (1) South Shields fort (Arbeia, NZ 365 679): excavation continued in the area immediately south of Granaries C15-16, where work in 200588 had reached the levels of the mid-Antonine (Period 4) fort-wall and intervallum area. Beneath the timber building, found last year to occupy the rampart area, lay the remnant of the primary rampart, of clean yellow clay and extending just over 5 m from the inner face of the south-east wall. This sat directly upon pre-fort deposits of wind-blown sand, in which were recorded traces of turf blocks, presumably belonging to structures pre-dating the first stone fort. The primary (Period 4) intervallum street was found to have been between 2.5 m and 3 m wide, with a stone-lined drain running along its south- eastern edge. After the rampart of the fort had been cleared away the drain went out of use and was partially removed leaving only its north-western side as a line of stones incorporated in metalling which now extended south-westwards and which was overlain by the timber building, c. 3 m in width, set up against the fort wall. The clay-bonded stone rear wall of Period 4 Barrack B9 was revealed along the north-western edge of the intervallum road. The lowest course of this wall, 0.65 m wide, had survived, incorporated into the make-up of the Period 5B streets between the granaries, and the construction of the granaries had followed on directly from its demolition. Removal of the construction backfill surrounding the unnumbered Granary COO exposed a re- used building inscription built upside-down into the south-easternmost buttress on the south- west side of that building (see p. 345).89 NEWCASTLE UPON TYNE (1) Byker, Shields Road (NZ 2665 6471): Hadrian's Wall was exposed over a length of 31 m, on the site of the two evaluation trenches reported last year.90 A strip of the berm north of 85 Conducted for Taylor Woodrow Developments by L.

The 2.53 m width given last year refers to the Wall foundation rather than the robbed Wall above, which would have been of typical Narrow Gauge at 2.30-2.35 m. 260</page><page sequence="21">BARRY C. BURNHAM the Wall, 3.45 m wide (just over half its full width), was exposed, as was a strip 1-1.75 m wide immediately behind the Wall. The Wall foundation survived in the eastern half of the site, but only a robber-trench to the west. The foundation of sandstone-rubble and clay was 2.53 m wide and 0.42 m deep, with large edging stones which retained traces of hard, pinkish mortar on which the facing stones had been set. The core was of rubble, sandy soil and clay. No facing stones survived. Along the berm 68 pits were recorded in a band beginning 1.45 m from the Wall face. These were clearly recognisable as the emplacements for defensive obstacles now known at several places between Wallsend and Heddon. More than one phase was represented, with more regular planning towards the western end, but there was much disturbance from an overlying rubble layer. Due to the excavation brief the features could only be revealed in plan, so it was not possible to clarify their developmental sequence. The pits ran through both of the previous evaluation trenches, contrary to what was stated last year. Patches of hardstanding composed of worn sandstone fragments survived, overlying a soil accumulation to the south of the Wall. Over this the southern face of the Wall had collapsed, and at one point four articulated courses of wall tumble remained intact.91 NORTHUMBERLAND (1) Whittington, Halton East Farm (NZ 019 684): a watching-brief during the development of farm buildings revealed two sections of wall on the same alignment as previous sightings of the foundations of Hadrian's Wall.92 One section of wall, 1 m long, was detected in Area D, with three pieces of stone making up its north face. A second piece of wall, 2.5 m long, was uncovered in Area E, consisting of undressed sandstone with a wall face on the north side. Both pieces of wall lay at a depth of between 0.35 m and 0.05 m below ground level. No datable finds were recovered.93 (2) Chesterholm (Vindolanda, NY 768 663): the excavation of the south-western fort wall and rampart mound of the last stone fort at Vindolanda was completed.94 This proved beyond doubt that the wall had fallen and been repaired many times since its original construction in the early third century A.D. The excavation of the latrine drain off the south-western comer uncovered an important new inscription (p. 346). Traces of post-Roman occupation were encountered on the rampart to the south of the west gate in the form of a well-constructed stone building which, once out of use, had been the site of a human burial. During the excavation of the ramparts it became clear that a significant proportion of the fort wall had earlier Antonine origins, its distinctive soft sandstone blocks being re-used by both Severan and Gaulish garrisons. The site of Ian Richmond's 1934 excavation of the early west gate was re-visited and found to be the gateway of a hitherto unknown timber Antonine phase, which pre-dated the conversion into stone. The construction of the stone fort wall saw the west gateway moved to the position later occupied by the second stone fort's gate. Excavation continued in the western part of the site, south-west of the wells and water tanks, and more fragments of statuary associated with the two temples or tombs were recovered (FIG. 11).95 A major road running east-west was found to flank the south-west sides of the third- 91 Excavation for Rokeby Developments by Tyne and Wear Museums was supervised by T.

BURNHAM century A.D. industrial workshops examined in 2003-04, along with a series of later Roman water-channels, which led water from an as yet unknown source somewhere to the north-west. The absence of any stone structures further west than those examined in 2005 was perhaps indicative that the western limits of the third-century A.D. extramural settlement had been reached, 180 m west of the associated fort's western wall. Beneath the industrial workshops lay the severely truncated remains of what appear to have been workshops of Hadrianic to Antonine date, represented by several small hearths and substantial quantities of industrial waste. The very large timber building first located in 2005 was further examined and dendrochronology on the newly uncovered posts provided a refined felling date for its timbers of between A.D. 101 and 112.96 4.

Three small evaluation trenches located the heavily eroded remains of the road, flanked in one trench by a large ditch and in the other two by a bank of gravel and clay constructed parallel to the road; all these features were presumably to prevent peat from covering the road surface.

There was no evidence for activity in the fourth century A.D.101 (c) Park View Community School (NZ 2768 5129): excavation prior to the construction of an extension to the school examined the middle of the three defensive ditches on the east side of the fort. Pottery from the lowest silting indicated that it dated to the later second century A.D. It was finally filled in with rubble at the end of the fourth century. Well-preserved organic material contained the remains of a variety of plant species, including common nettle and black nightshade, as well as aquatic insects such as water boatmen along with grain pests.102 (3) Ebchester, Primary School (NZ 4104 5553): evaluation in the school grounds found slight traces of timber buildings in the assumed area of the vicus south of the fort.103 (4) Piercebridge (NZ 4211 5158): a grant from the Aggregates Levy Sustainability Fund has enabled the completion of a publishable report on the late Peter Scott's 1972-81 excavations at Piercebridge and on those of (now Professor) Dennis Harding at Holme House villa.104 (5) Sedgefield, East Park (NZ 4353 5290): two seasons of work have now been carried out at this settlement, discovered in 2002,105 which lies astride the Roman road known locally as Cade's Road. Geophysical survey has revealed a system of fenced and ditched enclosures extending over at least 24 ha, the largest measuring 50 m by 50 m (FIG. 12). While there is a single line to the west of Cade's Road, the pattern is far more complex to the east, with blocks of enclosures separated by a series of lanes and side-roads, many of them connected with an open area in what may have been the centre of the settlement. Excavation of c. 40 per cent of the largest known enclosure west of Cade's Road in 2005 produced evidence of small rectangular wooden buildings towards the centre and rear of the space. The front portion apparently remained open ground, sub-divided into areas used for different purposes, including pottery manufacture and stock compounds. The latest fill of the enclosing ditches produced two objects which had been deliberately buried as votive offerings: one was a small pottery beaker in a local fabric, the other a bronze jug or ewer, which was 180 mm tall and made of metal less than 2 mm thick (FIG. 13). By contrast, the handle was heavy and richly decorated. Two bird or animal heads grasp the rim at one end, while the other terminates in what may be the head of a Medusa. The high tin content would have given the vessel a highly reflective surface. A gash in the side of the jug had probably been made when it was deposited in the ditch, as the pieces were still inside. In 2006 a small enclosure at the western edge of the central open area was excavated. On the side away from the open space it was defined by a single ditch. On the other three sides, however, there were two ditches and an intervening palisade emphasising the distinction between the enclosure and the open space. The only entrance lay in the centre of the east side. It was extremely narrow at c. 0.6 m, with the settings for three large posts on the inside. Though not necessarily all in use at the same time, they confirm the impression that access to and use of this enclosure were restricted. The interior was almost entirely occupied by an aisled timber building measuring c. 12 m by 9 m. This conceivably served a public or religious function.106 101 Excavation carried out by Pre-Construct Archaeology (North) Ltd. 102 Excavation carried out by Pre-Construct Archaeology (North) Ltd.

The field-system was only partially represented in the cropmarks, so the site was investigated by a strip and record strategy, followed by detailed excavation. A rectilinear sub-divided field-system formed the main part of the site. Several human burials were located, parallel and adjacent to the field boundaries. Investigation of the small enclosures did not reveal firm evidence for domestic occupation, though the finds, which included small amounts of samian, coins and metalwork, would suggest settlement close by.107 (2) Hensall (SE 588 225): following a magnetometer survey in 2005, which identified a single linear anomaly, a strip and record exercise has been undertaken across an area of known cropmarks. Pottery recovered from the initial strip indicates Roman activity.108 107 Excavation undertaken by Archaeological Services (WYAS). Ms J.

BURNHAM (3) Langstrothdale, Yockenthwaite Moor (NGR withheld): survey of a supposed late pre- historic/Romano-British settlement with sub-circular drystone-walled structures, some surviving up to 1.6 m high, has raised the possibility that some may be of medieval/post-medieval date.109 (4) Pickering, Newbridge Quarry (SE 795 857): further excavations investigated the north- ward continuation of the late Iron Age and Romano-British settlement enclosures in advance of quarrying.110 As before the enclosures were appended to the eastern side of a north-south double-ditched trackway. At least three phases of activity were represented, including two phases of roundhouses succeeded by a rectangular ditched enclosure. Four unenclosed gully-defined structures lay to the west of the trackway, though these remain undated. Further cremation burials were found inserted into the fill of the trackway ditch; these are presently thought to be of late Roman date."11 (5) Reighton By-pass (TA 130 755-120 767): archaeological work prior to the construction of the A 165 by-pass confirmed the presence of human activity, ranging in date from the late Iron Age, or earlier, to the Romano-British period. Remains consisted of two large parallel ditches (the 'Argham Dike'), a group of large pits, some post-holes, and a series of linear ditches forming a possible enclosure within which were the remains of two ring gullies. Several other ditches apparently forming a field-system were also recorded. An undated but apparently crouched inhumation, together with a concentration of pits, was located within a putative late Iron Age or Romano-British enclosure; most of the pits are likely to have been chalk quarries.112 (6) Richmond, Black Plantation (NZ 157 041): survey during partial felling identified eleven circular stone-walled houses in association with two discrete areas of fields and trackways defined by stony banks and earthen scarps; other structures, including possible yards, were also identified. No independent dating evidence was recovered, but the reported discovery of several beehive querns and analogy with sites elsewhere would support an Iron Age or Romano-British date.113 YORK (1) York (Eboracum): (a) 18 Bootham Terrace (SE 5975 5260): a watching-brief during extension and conversion work revealed two Romano-British inhumations within the terraced rear garden. Both were of adults, without associated grave-goods. A small quantity of Romano- British pottery was recovered from the grave fills, indicating a date in or after the late second century A.D.114 (b) Land at the junction of Dixon Lane and George Street (SE 6072 5147): Roman settlement was located on this site, c. 600 m south-east of the fortress. Features included the terracing of a naturally occurring slope to provide a flat area for building-work, a number of post-hole alignments, and several rubbish pits. Due to heavy truncation by later features the precise nature of this settlement is unclear. There were hints that burials may have been present as a number of possible funerary objects were recovered, including a gold finger-ring set with a carnelian, a jet pendant in the shape of a bear, a shale bracelet, and fragments of a head-pot and third-century A.D. greyware jars which have frequently been used as cremation pots.11"5 109 Survey by M.

This had been capped with tiles which had subsequently broken and collapsed into the drain. Overlying the drain was a relict ground level that contained Ebor ware of the second century A.D., comparable with the material found in the gardens of the Hall in 1970. On the north-east side of the Hall excavation within the building identified a sequence of dump deposits, the earliest of which contained a concentration of pottery and tile dating to the second and third centuries A.D., together with a samian sherd with graffiti. This evidence suggests that in the Roman period the ground level dropped sharply to the south-west and north-east, presumably towards the channel of the river Foss, which may account for the episodes of dumping to level the ground surface.116 (d) 187 Tadcaster Road (SE 5836 4875): a watching-brief during the excavation of trial pits and groundworks revealed several possible ditches associated with the Roman road known to lie under the present Tadcaster Road.117 (e) 129 The Mount (SE 5933 5092): a watching-brief revealed a decapitated skeleton similar to those found at 1-3 and 6 Driffield Terrace.118 The site lies within the known Roman cemetery centred on The Mount.119 (2) Haxby: addenda of 4 BI nummi: the total now stands at 370 coins (down to A.D. 355).120 EAST RIDING OF YORKSHIRE (1) Driffield, Auchinleck Close (TA 0095 5595): monitoring of further stripping in advance of housing development,121 east and north-east of previous work, revealed only a few isolated additional features.122 (2) Kilnsea (TA 4175 1569): magnetometer survey in advance of possible coastal defence work identified several linear and rectilinear anomalies, subsequently shown to be Roman features by excavation.123 (3) Pocklington area: 15 silver denarii down to A.D. 161, found during metal-detecting.124 (4) Stamford Bridge, High Catton Road (SE 7130 5473): following geophysical survey east of the Roman small town, close to the crossing of the river Derwent, nine trial trenches were excavated, revealing a series of ditches in all but one, cut into the natural sands. One ditch, noted in four trenches, was aligned west-south-west/east-north-east, c. 40 m north of the predicted line of the Roman road, which ought to lie just outside the survey area. This may have defined the rear of any settlement plots extending back from the road, though the small areas examined made it difficult to reconstruct their layout; virtually all other features lay to the south. Several north- south ditches probably represent plot boundaries or internal sub-divisions, while three successive ditches, which turn north-west/south-east, might mark the repeated redefinition of the corner of one such plot or sub-division. Several small pits and other structural features were recorded, 116 Excavation for York Conservation Trust was undertaken for York Archaeological Trust by G. Dean. Dr R.

BURNHAM some sealed by a layer which was in turn overlain by part of a stone surface; a small uninscribed altar was found nearby, lying on its back, perhaps re-used as a post-pad in conjunction with the surface. Most of the associated pottery dates to the late third to fourth century A.D.125 (5) Thwing (TA 699 058): work continued on this area of ladder settlement and the associated stone building.126 The magnetometer survey was extended to cover all the cropmarks in the field under excavation as well as almost all of those in the field to the east, an area of c. 7 ha. The complex seems to have developed on either side of an irregular central ditch, with three sets of enclosure types recognisable by their morphology. At least two areas are associated with settlement, one comprising a series of roundhouses, presumed to be Iron Age in date, the other, which includes the excavated structure, has evidence for extensive Roman activity as well as a possible Iron Age precursor. A further series of enclosures show lower intensity activity, perhaps associated with farming, while a final group may have been used as animal pens or for vegetable cultivation. A single area (c. 24 m by 12 m) was opened, overlapping with the western end of Trench 2 excavated in 2005. This revealed a dense spread of chalk rubble, with occasional ceramic tiles and sandstone roofing slabs. Towards its western end this overlay stratified deposits containing rich organic material, pottery and bone. Cleaning identified the remains of in-situ walling and various robber-trenches, representing the remains of a rectangular structure c. 20 m long by 6 m wide, with what appears to have been wings (or pavilions) and a possible veranda or corridor on the eastern side. The surviving walling was of high-quality, clean white chalk, cut into well- dressed blocks and set in even horizontal courses. Fragments of diamond-shaped sandstone slab tiles suggest that these were used for the roofing. An internal wall divided the building into one-third and two-thirds portions. Wear in the corridor flooring suggests that the entrance was half-way along this side. Partial removal of the rubble from the interior revealed a solid floor of rammed chalk, together with substantial amounts of painted wall-plaster. Excavation of the interior of the south wing involved the removal of various midden deposits containing animal bone, pottery, and sea-food residues. Limited flotation produced well-preserved seeds and some fish bones. Most of the pottery dates to the third and fourth centuries A.D.127 LEEDS (1) Adel (SE 277 411): geophysical survey covering c. 12 ha sought to investigate the site of a presumed fort. Numerous anomalies indicate extensive settlement activity either side of a road aligned east-west. At the east end of the site, bisected by the road, a square feature could represent the fort. Activity continues for at least 200 m to the west, however, suggesting that the site is more complex than initially thought and that its function may have changed over time.128 (2) Castleford, land adjacent to Goodenough 's Bakery, off Beancroft Road (SE 42589 25424): a watching-brief during the digging of foundation trenches for a new dwelling located a sequence of Roman deposits in the north-east comer of the site, containing a number of large pottery fragments, dated to the early second to early third centuries A.D. This is likely to represent dumping of domestic refuse associated with the vicus lying south of the fort.129 (3) Castleford and Pontefract: 2 silver denarii down to A.D. 211 found during metal-detecting.

The ditches are likely to date to the late Iron Age or Romano-British periods. The field-system may be part of a more extensive co-axial system covering many square miles.131 DONCASTER (1) Armthorpe, West Moor Park (SE 6370 0500): investigations in advance of development revealed a series of enclosure ditches and gullies, pits, post-holes, hearths and ovens/kilns, west of a known area of 'brickwork' field-systems.132 They probably indicate low-density industrial activity, in association with the neighbouring agricultural activities. Many of the features seem to have been short-lived, perhaps indicating that the site was in use for a relatively short period before being abandoned. The large quantity of Yorkshire greyware found in the feature fills suggests a Romano-British date.133 (2) Bawtry (NGR withheld): a watching-brief identified the site of a potential temple. Finds from topsoil stripping include 71 coins, 653 sherds of pottery, and four column bases, three of which may be in situ. The coins date from the mid-third to late fourth century A.D. Their composition is not consistent with a single hoard and they may represent votive offerings. The pottery is of a similar date range and contains forms previously associated with burial and ritual sites, including 'tazze' vessels (incense-burners). Magnetometer survey over an area of 0.5 ha revealed potential archaeological anomalies, though without further investigation it is not clear if they are associated with the finds.134 (3) Bentley Rise (SE 570 050): a watching-brief in advance of sewage pipeline works, in an area of cropmarks known since 1979, failed to locate any trace of an associated trackway and enclosure, suggesting that the archaeology here has been lost due to repeated deep ploughing over the intervening 27 years.135 (4) Long Sandall (NGR withheld): a possible new fort has been identified on the east bank of the river Don during the systematic analysis of Meridian and RAF vertical air photographs. The remains seem to represent the north-east corner of a double-ditched enclosure, c. 165 m long and over 100 m wide.136 (5) Mexborough, Pastures Road (SE 493 005): following magnetometer survey, 25 trial trenches confirmed the presence of several ditches, probably forming two or three enclosures, and a double-ditched trackway. Further excavation confirmed the presence of two enclosures, one of which contained evidence of occupation including the truncated remains of a roundhouse with pits and post-holes. Ditches defining several field enclosures were also identified and two phases of activity were indicated. Quernstones and pottery suggest both Iron Age and Romano- British activity.137 (6) Norton, Barnsdale Bar Quarry, eastern extension (SE 515 415): further extension to the 131 Excavation undertaken by Archaeological Services (WYAS).

BURNHAM quarry has revealed more of the enclosed and sub-divided landscape that was initially investigated in 2003 and 2004.138 Two small adjacent ditched enclosures have now been revealed, along with a series of ditches forming an associated rectangular field pattern. Despite heavy truncation by ploughing, the ditches contained a small quantity of Roman pottery and a crouched inhumation burial. 139 (7) Rossington, Rossington All Saints School (SK 620 972): evaluation of an extensive 'brickwork' field-system, recorded as cropmarks in the 1970s, failed to locate any surviving remains, suggesting that the associated ditches had been destroyed by a combination of repeated deep ploughing and subsequent landscaping during the creation of the school's playing fields. 140 LANCASHIRE (1) Ribchester, 13 Church Street (SD 65011 35171): a watching-brief during the construction of a kitchen extension recorded deposits dating to the late first/early second century and the mid- third/mid-fourth century A.D. These lay on top of a metalled surface thought to represent the remains of a road running north-east from the fort, perhaps that which connected it to the fort at Burrow-in-Lonsdale. 141 CHESHIRE (1) Nantwich: (a) The Burgess Site, St Anne's Lane (SJ 6480 5237): extensive excavation revealed an area of Roman activity on higher ground, immediately to the rear of the properties fronting the south side of Welsh Row. These overlooked a low-lying area to the south and east, on the flood plain of the river Weaver, and contained deep accumulations of waterlogged organic material, within which were a number of Roman features. The most notable was a thick clay surface, measuring c. 3 m by 4 m, which extended beyond the northern limits of the excavation. It was set into the natural sand to a depth of c. 0.4 m and contained a number of pronounced linear discolourations on its surface. These were not the result of burning, but may indicate a demolished superstructure. Its precise function is unknown, but is likely to be connected with the industrial activity now known to extend over a large area either side of the Weaver. Other Roman features included pits, gullies, and a section of road.142 (b) Nantwich Town Football Club, Kingsley Fields (SJ 6460 5300): monitoring of topsoil stripping and supervised metal-detecting was carried out during the construction of new facilities, on a site immediately north of the area of settlement, salt production, and other industrial activity excavated in 2002.143 No further features were identified, confirming that the previous work had defined the northern limits of Roman activity. Metal-detecting, however, recovered nearly 400 pieces of metal from the topsoil. These dated to all periods, but included a significant amount of lead waste, much of which may derive from lead tanks known to have been used for the boiling of brine in the Roman period. A complete example of a tank of this type was recovered from the nearby Kingsley Fields Farm in the 1980s.144 138 For previous work see Britannia 36 (2005), 417. 139 Work undertaken by Archaeological Services (WYAS).

The pottery assemblage shows an unusual combination of north Lincolnshire and Dales Ware vessels, alongside copies of BB2 vessels more common in the Nene Valley area. A few sherds of Central Gaulish samian were noted, but the proportion of fine wares was very low. A large, rectangular, steep-sided pit, carefully aligned to the corner of the enclosure, with fine charcoal- rich fills, appears to have served some small-scale industrial purpose. After a brief occupation, the site apparently reverted to salt marsh.145 (2) Burgh-le-marsh, High Street (TF 4998 6492): two small trial trenches identified remains of third- to fourth-century A.D. occupation, including possible wall foundations and quantities of structural daub. Pottery and faunal assemblages also suggest domestic occupation in the immediate vicinity.146 (3) Caistor, North Kelsey Road (TA 0967 0106): trial-trenching on land c. 2 km west of the Roman town identified elements of a ditched field-system of later Iron Age to Roman date. The small pottery assemblage is entirely in the native tradition, but includes fabrics which continued in use into the early Roman period.147 (4) Hale: 881 copper-alloy nummi down to A.D. 337, found apparently in two distinct groups during metal-detecting.148 (5) Lincoln, Swanpool (SK 9485 7080): magnetometer survey and fieldwalking in advance of a proposed development clarified the full extent of archaeological activity associated with the major Roman pottery manufacturing industry of the late third and fourth centuries A.D.149 (6) Stamford, Gwash Valley (TF 0426 0803): evaluation revealed a series of ditched boundaries yielding material of the later second to fourth century A.D.

In Trench 21 a shallow feature containing a charcoal-rich deposit, including smithing slag, and an apparently random arrangement of large boulders was dated to the late third to fourth centuries A.D. A ditch in Trench 27 adjacent was dated by pottery to the late second/early third century. It too contained iron-working slags, as well as partly-worked iron bars with hearth- slag coatings.155 WORCESTERSHIRE (1) Bredon A and B: a hoard of 16 base silver radiates to A.D. 260 and a hoard of 2 silver siliquae to A.D. 367.156 WARWICKSHIRE (1) Alcester: (a) 10 Meeting Lane (SP 0924 5748): observation on the eastern side of the defended area of the Roman town revealed a clay layer that may have been part of the defensive rampart.157 (b) Swan Court, Swan Street (SP 0887 5732): evaluation of a site immediately south of the fourth-century town defences exposed a series of probable Roman deposits, including a layer of waterlogged timber and other organic remains.

North of the enclosures there was a single pit, while to the south there were three more late Roman inhumation burials, to add to two found in the evaluation. Two of the burials were decapitated.163 LEICESTERSHIRE (1) Leicester (Ratae), Vine Street: a hoard of 445 copper-alloy nummi (A.D. 317-346) was found during controlled archaeological investigation. Some were tightly packed into what may have been a wooden chest, the rest were scattered in a small area.164 (2) Rothley, The Grange (SK 586 127): evaluation in 2005-06 uncovered an inhumation cemetery, possibly of late Roman or early medieval date. Fragments of late Roman pottery and ceramic building material were also recovered, suggesting the presence of nearby settlement.165 NORTHAMPTONSHIRE (1) Caldecote: a hoard of 54 nummi to A.D. 378. Only 15 are even partly legible.166 (2) Deanshanger, Kingsbrook School (SP 7684 3957): archaeological features to the south- east of a Roman villa first identified in 1957 were examined.167 Excavations in 1972, 1974-75, 1996, and 2004 had expanded upon the original evidence for the site. There were late first-century to early second-century ditched enclosures to the south-east of the villa. Robbed walls dating to the late second and early third centuries defined the south-east corner of the villa courtyard and were aligned on the earlier enclosure pattern. Two circular stone structures, probably bread ovens, were also found.

Anomalous bone growth inside the skull of one of the skeletons may be the result of meningitis. (4) Northampton, Upton, Pineham North, Site 1 (SP 712 582): excavation in advance of the first two stages of a major residential and business/industrial development was carried out on sites identified from fieldwalking, geophysical investigation, and trial-trenching.169 An area of late Iron Age settlement was succeeded in the first century A.D. by a small farming settlement that continued in occupation throughout the Roman period until the late fourth century, although there may have been a brief hiatus in occupation in the third century (FIG. 14). Associated with the early Roman settlement were three cremation burials. Two were accompanied by a number of luxury items, including a small range of Roman fine wares and conical glass jugs, dating to the late first to early second century A.D. Also dating to the late first/early second century were a circular stone and timber building and a T-shaped malting oven. The settlement underwent significant changes during its history, with much recutting and realignment of the ditch systems, and at least four main phases have been identified through to the late fourth century. @ Crown copyright.

A considerable quantity of pottery was recovered, ranging in date from the late first to third centuries A.D., along with two Roman coins and a quantity of metal objects, including a lead weight, a spoon and iron nails. (6) West Haddon Bypass, Village Farm (SP 6284 7243): an open-area excavation and series of watching-briefs took place after field survey and trail-trenching had demonstrated the survival of Romano-British settlement.171 The earliest evidence for occupation was an undated, circular ditched enclosure and a larger irregular enclosure defined by a sinuous gully. The Romano- British settlement comprised a series of sub-rectangular enclosures set out either side of a ditched trackway. Parts of three such enclosures together with associated features and a section of the trackway were examined. The evidence indicates a rural settlement of modest status whose economy was based upon crop cultivation. The settlement appears to have been established in the mid-first century A.D. and reached its zenith in the second to third centuries before being abandoned by the late third century. CAMBRIDGESHIRE (1) Bourn, Airfield: a hoard of 15 Constantinian nummi was found in archaeological excavation of the fill of a boundary ditch enclosing a Romano-British rural settlement.172 (2) Childerley Gate: a hoard of 4,487 'barbarous radiates' to c. A.D. 274 found, during arch- aeological excavation, buried within a farm enclosure in a pit that was probably dug for this purpose.173 (3) Fulborn, The Chantry (TL 5205 5638): excavation uncovered a pit containing a small quantity of Roman pottery, including a sherd from a flanged bowl in Oxfordshire red colour- coated ware. The pit probably represents low-level activity in the hinterland of the villa recorded 500 m to the north.174 (4) Papworth Everard, Summersfield (TL 2850 6250): trial-trenching uncovered a ditched enclosure, possibly for stock, on higher ground to the west of Ermine Street, and dating to the later part of the Roman period.175 The limited quantity of finds from the enclosure, including very few personal items, suggests that settlement was not particularly intensive and may have been seasonal in nature. Small quantities of finds were recovered from a scatter of features across the remainder of the development area.

(7) Yaxley, The Broadway (TL 7690 3961): open area excavation on 1.9 ha during July to October 2005 followed the identification by geophysical survey and trial-trenching of Iron Age and Roman settlement.178 The earliest features comprised a principal east-west boundary ditch, with late Iron Age enclosures and roundhouse ring ditches occupied into the first century A.D. The enclosure pattern was expanded northwards in the early second century, although the roundhouses may have fallen out of use. The enclosures were extended again in the mid-second to mid-third centuries, with a new principal boundary ditch to the west. This may have marked the establishment of a villa of some wealth, as indicated by the recovery of building materials, including a fragment of polished Alwalton Marble (from near Peterborough) and other decorative building stone. A small cemetery was established over the course of two or three generations along the western perimeter. The site was laid out on a new configuration in the late third century, forming a pattern of smaller enclosures. This is likely to coincide with a major change in the agricultural economy and marked the final phase of the Roman settlement. BEDFORDSHIRE (1) Bedford, Cambridge Road (TL 0756 4807): excavation in 2005 took place on a multi- period site on the terrace gravels of the river Great Ouse lying on the southern edge of Bedford, prior to the development of a business/industrial park.179 The northern fringe of the Romano- British settlement of Eastcotts, predominantly dated to the second and third centuries A.D., which had been partly excavated in the mid-1990s prior to the construction of the A421 by-pass, was fully excavated. Finds from large, waterlogged pits include the remains of a leather shoe, leather scraps, a wooden double-sided comb, and a wooden bobbin. There were a number of smaller pits, which produced a large assemblage of Roman pottery dating to the late second to early third century A.D., and kiln bars found within this 'backyard' area indicate that there was pottery production in the immediate vicinity. There was no surviving evidence for any buildings or other structures. Features beyond the northern boundary of the settlement included a stone-lined well, a probable watering hole for livestock, various pits, and an extended inhumation burial. (2) Dunstable, Ashton St Peter's Lower School, Church Street (TL 0186 2220): a four-trench evaluation revealed a number of pits and linear features containing Roman pottery of the early first to late fourth century A.D. and a residual Iron Age sherd. Two fourth-century Roman coins were also recovered.180 (3) Kempston-Biddenham, Bedford Western By-pass: (a) Site 3 (TL 0192 4797): open-area excavation was undertaken'8' on the periphery of a substantial Romano-British farmstead/villa known from non-intrusive survey at the southern end of the Biddenham Loop.182 The settlement 177 Work by J.

A series of small rectilinear enclosures was excavated, fitting the pattern revealed by non-intrusive survey. The majority of the enclosures within the excavation area did not contain evidence for domestic activity. However, inhumation cemeteries in two of the most peripheral enclosures contained a total of 29 graves. The majority of the skeletons were extended and the head of one was repositioned between the feet. Sufficient nails were recovered from five graves to suggest the presence of a coffin. A small proportion of the burials were accompanied by grave-goods, including hobnailed shoes, glass and ceramic vessels, a glass-bead necklace, copper bracelets, earrings, and a bronze finger-ring. Away from the cemeteries was a pottery kiln, provisionally dated to the fourth century on the basis of archaeomagnetic analysis. Its stokehole utilised a partially infilled enclosure ditch. (b) Site 5 (TL 0163 4768): open area excavation was undertaken183 on the opposite side of the river Great Ouse to Site 3 within the extensive Romano-British settlement centred on Kempston Church End.184 The settlement was established prior to the Conquest and occupied throughout the Romano-British period (FIG. 15). A metalled roadway with side ditches constructed in the late first century was the focus of the settlement; previous work has shown that it continued northwards for over 450 m. It appears to have remained in use throughout the life of the settlement and was associated with other trackways positioned perpendicular to it. A series of ditched enclosures was attached to the roadway ditches. Domestic activity was concentrated in the enclosures adjacent to the roadway and comprised evidence for timber and stone buildings, stone-lined wells, isolated pits and post-holes. At least 25 large cess-pits, some intercutting, were located towards the rear of the domestic enclosures. The layout and position of the enclosures changed over time but the earlier boundaries were often re-used. (c) Site 8 (TL 0147 4739): open area excavation located several severely truncated Roman features.' 85A number of parallel gullies containing small quantities of Romano-British pottery are interpreted as cultivation trenches. Although undated, an unurned cremation burial and a possible square building may also be of this period. The remains appear to indicate activity on the periphery of the extensive settlement centred on Kempston Church End. HERTFORDSHIRE (1) Ashwell, near Baldock: a fourth and final season of excavation took place in September 2006 on ritual deposits and structures at the find-spot of a hoard of temple treasure which had been dedicated to the newly-discovered deity, Senuna.186 The 2004-05 excavation area was re-opened, measuring 16 m square. The area was extended on its north side by 2 m to examine more of the centre of the enclosure, while a trench measuring 10 m by 3 m was extended to the west from the north-west corner to reveal a larger area of the later Romano-British gravelled surface and to seek any relationship with an approximately north-south track-way shown by the geophysical survey. A 10 m by 7 m extension from the south edge of the area was designed to define the southern extent of the deposits. The southern extension revealed that the deposits ceased after a few metres. It confirmed the previously observed sequence of events; around the second quarter of the first century A.D., topsoil on the south side of a large, possibly natural, hollow was stripped to the underlying natural chalky-clay colluvium and a flint gravel surface laid. Organic soils then formed that were sealed by chalk pebble surfaces on at least two occasions. 183 Work by M. Luke, B. Barker, I. Beswick, M. Smith and J. Archer, Albion Archaeology. M.

Bedford Western Bypass: Site 5 during the second to third century. (Drawing courtesy ofAlbion Archaeology) The trench extended to the west demonstrated that the later Romano-British gravel surface continued and merged with the surface of the metalled road 10 m beyond. This road was of at least four phases, the earliest of which was unmetalled and formed a hollow-way dating from about the early first century A.D. On the north side of the excavation area, in the centre of the enclosure-hollow, was a sequence of clay-built hearths, forming an elliptical ring around a clay-built platform. On its surface lay debris from feasting, including much broken pottery, animal bones and oyster shells, and also Domestic Enclosure: Road Surface: Conjectured line: 279</page><page sequence="40">ROMAN BRITAIN IN 2006 artefacts that may have been deliberately deposited as part of the rituals. These included the two halves of a puddingstone quern, fragments of pipe-clay figurines, stone and pottery spindle- whorls, and metalwork - coins (mostly Iron Age), iron nails and unidentified iron objects and copper-alloy personal items such as brooches. The westernmost hearth had part of a Late Bronze Age sword blade in its make-up. The last hearth in the sequence, on the east side of the arrangement, was possibly as late as the third century A.D. It was cut by a shallow midden pit containing considerable quantities of ovicaprid bones, oyster shells, and a large variety of broken pottery, including decorated samian ware and a sherd of possible Arretine ware depicting a flying bird and a ram's head. Inserted into the central clay surface were several small pits, each containing calcined bone and ash. The largest and deepest pit produced pot sherds, animal bone, part of a copper-alloy bangle and, at the base, an Iron Age coin. Another pit also had an Iron Age coin at its base. Apparently as a result of ritual feasting, organic soils formed across the whole hollow and above the hearths and earliest gravel surface. These soils are rich in artefacts and ecofacts. The soils were periodically sealed by the laying of chalk pebble or flint gravel surfaces. On the west side of the central clay platform and hearths, further articulated pig skeletons were recorded. The site as a whole was used for feasting and other rituals involving the deposition of votive offerings at funerals, both before and after the cremation of the deceased elsewhere but presumably nearby. The two chalk rubble-floored structures found in previous years may have been for the exposure of corpses prior to cremation. Once a body had been cremated and the bulk of the remains buried in a nearby cemetery (as yet unlocated), it appears that some cremated remains were brought back onto the site to be either scattered around the hearths or placed in specially-dug small pits.187 (2) Harpenden, M1 Junction 9 (TL 0925 1490): excavation was carried out in advance of motorway improvements.'88 Features of Roman date included two roughly north-south aligned trackways defined by ditches, and further ditches probably forming part of a rectilinear field- system between the trackways. At the south end of the site a less regular group of features included more ditches, waterholes/wells, and a probable lime kiln. These probably related to a farmstead lying close by, perhaps just to the east. The dating evidence indicates that the majority of activity was of late Iron Age to early Roman date.

These defined part of a double-ditched curvilinear enclosure with the space between the two ditches sub-divided, possibly into pens for livestock. The centre of the enclosure contained pits and post-holes, probably indicating occupation, though no buildings can be identified at present. Other Roman features included two possible lime-kilns lying north of the trackway, and three quarry pits (for chalk and/or flint) and a corn-drying oven lying south of the settlement. The latter was cut by a rectilinear, double- ditched enclosure of later Roman date. BUCKINGHAMSHIRE (1) Fenny Stratford, Belvedere Nurseries (SP 8874 3395): a watching-brief uncovered evidence for a Roman field-system.192 Four ditches, containing Roman pottery and animal bone, were identified. Previous work had revealed Roman inhumations, though none was seen during the watching-brief. MILTON KEYNES (1) Newport Pagnell, Walnuts Farm (SP 856 431): following evaluation, excavation took place on Iron Age and Romano-British settlement.193 There was a small late Iron Age settlement in the northern part of the site. A linear boundary ditch ran for 163 m, and continued beyond the excavation. Its fill contained some early Roman pottery, although the boundary may have been established in the Iron Age. Transverse ditches suggest the setting out of adjacent field boundaries, and the linear ditch probably bounded a droveway. By the later first century A.D. a ditched enclosure had been created immediately north of the boundary while a square enclosure to the south was added in the second century. These two enclosures were maintained and recut through the third and fourth centuries (FIG. 16). Both enclosures contained internal sub-divisions and other gullies, pits and post-holes. These features produced a wide range of domestic artefacts, including evidence for small-scale bronze casting, but no house plans survived. The animal bone assemblage was dominated by cattle, indicating that pastoral farming was an important aspect of the economy, while fragments of rotary querns and millstones, and the remains of drying-ovens with the presence of charred cereals relate to arable exploitation. OXFORDSHIRE (1) Chinnor, Lower Farm (SP 74926 00357): the owner reported the finding of an inhumation during the excavation for a land drain.194 The body was lying on its side with its lower legs and arms to the rear as if bound at the time of burial. Four pits were also partly visible within the trench. A sherd of Romano-British greyware may have come from the grave fill. It is reported that the field to the west is popular with metal-detectorists. This suggests a Romano-British settlement site of some extent.

The evidence was concentrated in the northern part of the excavation, although ditches did extend into the southern part of the site. The broad ditches delimited at least four, and possibly more, putative fields. No domestic or occupation activity was identified, but pottery suggests the existence of a settlement in the vicinity. The Phase 2 field-system was identified on the basis of stratigraphic relationships and the similar characteristics of several gullies/ditches. These are dated by pottery to the early Roman period. An unphased pit containing a human cremation burial was also associated with these ditches. (3) Dorchester-on-Thames: (a) Bridge End, The Chequers (SU 5785 9394): evaluation prior to development suggested that the area lies within a post-medieval gravel quarry.

They differ in age and location and suggest an expanding and shifting pattern of settlement, beginning in the early Iron Age and carrying on through until the late first/early second century A.D. The most notable site was late Iron Age in date and comprised one or more roundhouses and other associated features in a large D-shaped enclosure. Some of the ditches contained large groups of pottery and other material characteristic of domestic settlement, including baked clay and charcoal. The latest Roman material came from a small group of ditches in the north-western corner of the evaluation area, well to the north of the D-shaped enclosure. (2) Boreham, Old Hall and Generals Farm (TL 7650 0870): an evaluation covering c. 15 ha was carried out on the site of a proposed agricultural reservoir and associated ecological compensation area.221 74 trial trenches were opened, some specifically targeting known cropmark features. The Roman remains - an urned cremation burial, a ditch and two spreads - were confined to the north-eastern area above the floodplain. These may represent the edge of wider- ranging Roman activity that extends northward. (3) Colchester (Camulodunum), Park Road (TL 9820 2480): two umed cremation burials were found in the south of a development area approximately 1 km south-west of the Roman colonia, probably within its western suburbs.222 One burial, dated to the later second century A.D., was well-preserved and comprised a large jar covered by an upturned dish. The second burial was probably contemporary and comprised the lower half of a greyware jar truncated in antiquity. Two large, east-west aligned ditches and a smaller north-west-south-east aligned ditch may also date to the Roman period. (4) Great Baddow, 16High Street (TL 7273 0504): apiece ofbox-flue tile and a fragment ofbrick were recovered during a small excavation carried out ahead of a residential development.223 (5) Great Chesterford, All Saints Church (TL 5058 4276): a small excavation adjacent to the church uncovered residual mid- to late Roman pottery and tile.224 (6) South Benfleet, 21 High Street (TQ 7762 8601): ground works for a residential development on a site opposite the church of St Mary the Virgin were monitored.225 Several pits were recorded, filled with large quantities of Roman brick and tile; the date of the pits was not definitely established, and as the church contains reused material in its fabric it is possible that they are post-Roman.

A pit 280 m to the east of this may also have been associated with this activity. Although neither feature contained dating evidence, it is likely that they are of Roman origin. (8) Wendons Ambo, Duck Street (TL 5094 3596): trial-trenching was undertaken on the site of a residential development227 close to the M11 and 150 m south-east of the villa complex excavated prior to the construction of the motorway.228 The earliest features were a series of ditches and gullies dated to the first century A.D. and predominantly aligned north-east-south- west. It is possible that some of the gullies were structural. Also of first-century date was a metalled surface, perhaps part of a yard or area of hardstanding. A subsoil deposit containing mid- second- to mid-third-century pottery was also excavated and fourth-century deposits were found overlying the metalled surface in an area of concentrated activity in the east of the field. Most of the features probably represent agricultural activities associated with the villa complex. (9) Witham, Faulkbourne Farm, Cressing Road (TL 8114 1737): trial-trenching on the site of a proposed gravel processing plant uncovered a ditch containing a small quantity of pottery dating to the first century A.D. The finds suggest the presence of a rural settlement.229 7. GREATER LONDON By PAUL BOOTH CITY OF LONDON (1) Bow Bells House, Bread Street, EC4 (TQ 32330 81140): following work in 2005,230 excavations were undertaken on three crane-base pits, thirty-five pile-location pits and five geotechnical pits, with an additional watching-brief on the drain runs.231 The results have refined the findings of the earlier work. The main density of quarry pits, at the bottom of the Roman sequence, was found in the central zone of the site, mid-way between Cheapside to the north and Watling Street to the south. Several quarry pits were found to have removed the natural gravel down to the London Clay at c. 7.3 m OD. The quarry pits appear to have been left open until being levelled en masse by a huge clearance dump, presumably from domestic properties to the north and south. Evidence for these properties consisted of beaten-earth floors and hearths; several possible beam-slots and burnt in-situ planking suggest the alignment of these buildings. Relatively large quantities of glass waste suggest glass-working on the site, although no furnaces have been positively identified. Other significant finds include a Venus figurine and a glass cameo depicting Hercules and Iolas, the only one of its type found in Britain. 226 Work by T.

However, pockets of later Roman material suggest a different land use rather than disuse. Further slots through the Roman road to the north of the site indicate it had a metalled 'side-walk' between the southern drainage ditch and the properties. Work continues. (2) 1 Wood Street/120 Cheapside, EC2 (TQ 32329 81240): following work during 2005,232 excavation of pile caps and a watching-brief on smaller pile caps and ground level reduction were carried out.233 Natural orange brickearth overlay terrace gravels. The centre of the site also contained an irregularly-shaped natural feature which had perhaps been utilised for water retrieval during the early Roman period. A north-south aligned early Roman clay-and-timber building was recorded along the Wood Street frontage. Its lower stratigraphy consisted of a beam-slot lined with timbers with a brickearth wall above. On the internal face of this wall keyed plaster had survived to a maximum height of 0.45 m. A series of stake-holes lined the beam-slot cut and there was evidence that the first phase of the building had been destroyed by fire, leaving in-situ burnt timbers, some faced with decayed plaster. To the south were the remains of a second building, possibly a later phase of the example seen to the north. Metal-working debris over a compacted gravel surface and stake-holes surrounding a well in the centre of the site also suggested some small-scale industrial activity. To the west, a deep ditch lined with timber planks and running downhill (east-west) probably related to early drainage of the site. To the south of the site along Cheapside, the main east- west Roman road, were clay-and-timber buildings and the remains of a north-south oriented brickearth wall. In the south-east comer of the site the south-eastern comer of a mosaic floor was uncovered, consisting of a black and red border with white and grey tesserae decoration. This was set into a cemented opus signinum floor. Although the floor seems to be square, the mosaic appears to have been circular and extends beyond the limit of excavation. In the early to mid-second century the buildings were levelled and dumping took place over them. There was no evidence of later rebuilding in this area. The centre of the site was used for later Roman pitting and refuse disposal. Overlying these layers was a deep deposit of black silt, probably deposited in the third to fourth centuries A.D. (as dated from pottery) and possibly used for agricultural purposes. (3) 107 Cheapside, EC2 (TQ 32370 81220): following work in 2005, three trial pits and nine archaeological boreholes were excavated.234 The latter showed that a basement had removed all archaeological deposits within and along the north site limit. The trial pits lay within and along the west site limit in the north-west comer. The first was located south of the existing car park ramp and contained Roman waste and levelling layers abutting or cut by a possible east- west aligned Roman wall. A substantial medieval chalk foundation truncated the Roman layers apparently on the same alignment as the earlier wall. The second pit was located north of the car park ramp. Only a narrow strip of deposits survived on the western side. Natural brickearth was overlain by redeposited brickearth cut by a north-south line of post-holes, probably an external fence-line or property boundary. The post-holes were sealed by ground-raising dump layers and rubbish pits, below a sequence of Roman floor surfaces and a small fragment of ragstone wall. 232 For previous work see Britannia 37 (2006), 418. 233 Work by S.

A small, shallow remnant of a possible beam-slot cut a layer of re-worked brickearth, which sealed the natural. The beam-slot was sealed by a sequence of Roman made-ground or dumped deposits. Some of these layers were truncated on the south side by a later pit, probably also Roman, although no dating evidence was recovered. A relatively small pottery assemblage dated the Roman sequences from the mid-first to the late third century A.D. (4) City Wall, EC2 (TQ 32440 81620): sections of the City Wall standing in St Alphage Garden and in the Barbican were orthographically photographed, surveyed, and located on the Ordnance Survey grid. This recording forms part of an ongoing audit of the remains of the City Wall.235 (5) 16-18 Finsbury Circus, 18-31 Eldon Street, EC2 (TQ 3294 8166): redevelopment and demolition of the existing buildings has provided the opportunity for major excavations on the site, previously partially investigated by Frank Lambert in the early twentieth century and evaluated by P. Thrale (MoLAS) in 2003.236 The excavation of new foundations, pile positions, new basement areas, drainage trenches and lift pits, as well as limited excavation to formation level across much of the site, which began in 2005, continued this year.237 Palaeochannels or pre-Roman streams were recorded across the site cutting natural gravel deposits. Cutting some of these features were the inhumations and unurned cremations of a Roman cemetery site. The nature of the inhumations varied considerably, from a crouched burial to the use of coffins, including a possible hurdle or re-used door; the burials spanned age-groups from neonate to adult. Some burials included grave-goods, including a glass-bead necklace with shale pendant, copper bracelets and ceramic vessels. To the north-west of the site a complete horse skeleton recorded at the base of a channel may represent a burial of ritual significance. Also of note was the supine burial of a young male which included the remains of possible leg irons or fetters. In the south and east of the site there was evidence of possible ground consolidation in the Roman period, including a possible roadway of east-west orientation with associated drainage channels. In the south-east area of the site, marsh deposits dating to between the Roman and medieval periods were recorded with overlying post-medieval dumped deposits sealing the marsh. (6) 10-14 Fenchurch Avenue, EC3 (TQ 33260 80995): two geotechnical test pits were monitored.238 In one, redeposited brickearth was truncated by a small post-hole. This was overlain by dark grey silt containing charcoal, oyster shell and pottery of probable Roman date, and sealed by modem rubble and concrete. The other contained sandy silt with inclusions of oyster shell, animal bone, and some pottery provisionally dated to the Roman period.

This appears to have been a back road rather than a major thoroughfare. The metalled gravels were interspersed with silty deposits, indicating that it had not been regularly maintained. It divided the site into two distinct zones with occupation on the northern side towards the fort and amphitheatre, and open areas used for pitting to the south. Against the northern side of the road was a large Roman building constructed on deep, cut- stone foundations, although these and the internal surfaces had been robbed and truncated during the late first century A.D. The northern and southern external walls were excavated, allowing a reconstruction of the ground-plan. Later Roman activity consisted of clay-and-timber buildings constructed over the robbed remains of the large stone building. These were also oriented against the road and had been destroyed in a fire. During the third to fourth centuries the area was used for pits, from which a large quantity of tesserae and building material from the large building were recovered. (9) 54-66 Gresham Street, EC2 (TQ 32550 81270): excavation after demolition of the modem buildings to the west of the site revealed several large Roman quarry pits dug into the natural gravels and sands which lay at c. 10.2-10.5 m OD.241 Above this lay a series of severely truncated Roman occupation layers and features which did not include evidence of buildings, but indicated settlement in the vicinity. In the later Roman period the site was cleared and partially terraced in preparation for the construction of a probable temple, the foundations of which remained in situ. It consisted of a central building approximately 4.5 m square with a smaller concentric wall 1.4 m outside it forming an ambulatory. A hard and thick base of flint cobbles cemented into mortar occupied the southern half of the interior, to a depth of approximately 1.5 m. A gravel surface was found in the northern half representing the level from which the building was constructed. The purpose of the base is not clear but it may have supported a statue or altar dedicated to the relevant deity. No layers associated with use of the temple survived. (10) 311-318 High Holborn, WC2 (TQ 31002 81590): ground reduction was monitored during redevelopment of the site.242 Several archaeological features were observed, including a Roman pit and post-hole, and a possible Roman ploughed-soil horizon. (11) 9 King Street, EC2 (TQ 32477 81240): excavation of a sewer drop-shaft was monitored, revealing a first- to second-century A.D. building sequence with make-up layers, internal floors, and associated occupation deposits, sealed by a layer of Hadrianic fire debris.243 (12) 29-33 King Street, EC2 (TQ 32460 81260): a series of evaluation trenches and geotechnical test pits was excavated.244 Natural brickearth was overlain by Roman deposits, in the form of dumps, pits, possible gravel surfaces, and a fragment of third-century masonry wall that was the comer of a room or building.

This infilled pit was sealed by occupation layers, in turn cut by a large pit containing Roman pottery and one sherd of possible Saxon date. On the Cheapside frontage of the site, a quarry pit containing a series of fills of probable Roman date, including fire debris, was cut by two smaller pits containing Roman pottery. (17) Shield House, 16 New Street, EC2 (TQ 33340 81550): a small quantity of Roman pottery dated A.D. 50-170 was recovered from one test pit.249 An earlier evaluation in 2003 revealed some backfilled Roman quarry pits. (18) 36-39 Poultry, 1-5 Old Jewry, EC2 (TQ 32580 81160): excavations of new pile positions followed an evaluation in 2005.250 Natural sand and gravel was cut by a series of shallow quarries in the south of the site. These were probably early Roman in date and were overlain by clay- and-timber buildings that appeared to have been destroyed in a fire (probably associated with the Boudican revolt of A.D. 60-61). A compacted gravel road aligned roughly north-south was built over the levelled remains of these buildings and ran the length of the site. Clay-and-timber buildings were constructed on either side of this road. In the north of the site some of these buildings had evidence of industrial activity, possibly metal working. In the south of the site the buildings were cut by substantial rectangular masonry foundations constructed with large Kentish ragstone nodules. The interpretation of these foundations remains uncertain. As they appeared to extend under the modem street frontage which respects a medieval road alignment they are assumed to be late Roman in date.

(21) Mondial House, 90 Upper Thames Street, EC4 (TQ 32650 80690): four trial pits and seven boreholes were monitored.253 Waterfront deposits of probable Roman to medieval date were observed. (22) The Walbrook: St Swithin 's House, Walbrook House and Granite House, 30-37 Walbrook and 97-101 Cannon Street, EC4 (TQ 32640 80960): current development incorporates three adjoining buildings which will be replaced by a single building. The northernmost building is St Swithin's House where Ivor Noel Hume undertook a limited watching-brief in 1949 during which important 'multi-period' remains were recorded - although the majority of the deposits in this area were destroyed by new basements. Evaluation confirmed that all horizontal stratigraphy had been removed from St Swithin's House, but archaeological remains survived beneath the shallower basements of Walbrook House and Granite House to the south.254 The earliest features in this area were a sequence of four closely aligned north-south ditches cut into the natural gravel on the east side of the site. The earliest of these ditches both had 'V-cut' profiles, with the larger eastern ditch producing an assemblage of late Iron Age pottery - the first time that finds of this date have been found in a well-defined feature in the City of London. The unusually large size and profile of this ditch suggest that it represents the west side of the defences of a large fortified enclosure established immediately after the Roman Conquest in A.D. 43. The enclosed area could represent the limits of the early Roman city, which was later to expand outwards in all directions in the rebuilding and expansion that took place after the Boudican revolt of A.D. 60-61. In the post-Boudican rebuilding, a north-south-aligned road was laid out across the site over three of the early ditches; the full width of this road, its ditches, and portions of the buildings along its edges were defined. The earliest buildings were clay-and-timber but were subsequently replaced by more robust stone-founded buildings laid out along both sides of the road by the late first century, with the eastern range possibly incorporating a colonnade or open portico along its frontage. Although the majority of the internal floor surfaces were of brickearth, in the north-west corner of the building there was a section of carbonised timber flooring which clearly represented floorboards and joists in two adjoining rooms. The burnt remains of this floor and the adjoining masonry walls of the building were sealed beneath layers of destruction debris assumed to be derived from the Hadrianic fire of A.D. 120-130. The frontage wall of the west range of buildings was unusually deep due to the presence of a massive and poorly-consolidated, first-century quarry pit below it. This was filled with a large assemblage of deliberately fragmented animal bone. The practice of pulverising animal bone in this way has been noted on other Roman sites; it may have been done in order that the bones could be boiled-up so that the grease and fats that they contained could be extracted - possibly for use in the treatment of harnesses or other leather goods. 252 Work by W.

Enclosure ditches in the far south-east of the area may represent field boundaries related to the Roman-period rural settlement identified to the north-west in the Phase 1 excavations. A Roman cremation cemetery comprised 13 cremation burials of both umed and unumed type. Several of these contained copper-alloy or iron items, possibly including brooches. Many pits and post-holes were uncovered, but a lack of finds meant that most of these remained undated. ENFIELD (1) 108 Leighton Road, Bush Hill Park (TQ 3413 9578): excavation immediately adjacent to 2005 salvage recording259 provided new evidence for the known Romano-British settlement. Second-century and later silt deposits overlay a ?natural north-south slope or gully and were cut by the butt ends of ditches; the latter probably indicate an entrance through a double-ditched boundary parallel to and less than 30 m west of Ermine Street. Silting over the ditches may imply disuse of the boundary before a larger (re-cut) ditch, only seen in 2005 and so probably again with an entrance here, re-established it. A late third- to early fourth-century ritual 'ditch closure' deposit found in 2005, and probably dating the re-established boundary, may in fact have been a foundation deposit below e.g. a monument base next to the entrance (not a path as previously suggested). Modem cultivation had truncated deposits but there was again possible evidence of Saxon activity.260 ISLINGTON (1) Therese House, 29-30 Glasshouse Yard, EC1 (TQ 32040 82050): following the excavation of 10 trial pits in 2005, a further 12 pile positions were excavated as well as drainage trenches.261 Three Roman pits contained pottery dating from A.D. 50-400, 120-250, and 180-250.

(2) Potters Fields, SE] (TQ 33020 80060): an evaluation revealed deposits which may represent ancient land surfaces of late Iron Age/early Roman date and may be part of Horsleydown Eyot. Overlying these were post-Roman alluvial deposits.264 (3) 122-144 Southwark Bridge Road, SE1 (TQ 32000 79662): five evaluation trenches were excavated.265 A small number of probable early medieval features contained residual Roman pottery. (4) Church of St George the Martyr, Borough High Street, SE] (TQ 32481 79785): following work in 2005, a watching-brief continued within the crypt.266 The site lay on high ground on the northern edge of a palaeochannel. Late first-century clay-and-timber buildings were constructed over early Roman ground-raising dumps. One building contained a silver snake's-head finger- ring. These buildings probably fronted the west side of Watling/Stane Street; yard surfaces, a clay oven, and a possible animal pen lay behind them. The latest Roman feature was a rubbish pit dated A.D. 250-400. (5) Former Duke of Wellington Public House, 45 Tarn Street, SE] (TQ 32115 79188): eval- uation trenching at the site of the former public house revealed peat deposits associated with the prehistoric/Roman marshy area known as the Rockingham Anomaly. Roman pottery and building material from these deposits were dated A.D. 120-300.267 TOWER HAMLETS (1) 55-73, 75 and 99 Leman Street, Goodmans Fields, El (TQ 3404 8111): a watching-brief was maintained on pile probing, ground preparation, and removal of obstructions in advance of housing construction.268 The site lies within the eastern cemetery of Roman London but the area was largely re-worked by an eighteenth-century quarry. In one shallower part of the quarry, a possible late Roman burial was found. No bone survived in the acidic soil, but a rectangular area of packed chalk, surrounded by iron nails, is consistent with a late Roman chalk burial, while the size of the rectangle would be appropriate for a child.

(3) Eden House, 5-13 Spital Square, El (TQ 3450 1940): this site was evaluated in 1991 and again in 2000. Pile probing within the basement of the building revealed several probable quarry pits of second- to fourth-century date.270 WESTMINSTER (1) St Martin-in-the-Fields church, WC2 (TQ 30084 80524): excavation and a watching-brief were carried out during redevelopment.271 In Area 4 two burials dated to the late Roman period were located. An eighteenth-century tile-lined tank, to the north of the area, overlay a limestone sarcophagus, orientated north-east-south-west. The head end of the sarcophagus was to the south-west; the coffin and lid tapered slightly towards the foot end. The sarcophagus contained a supine skeleton with the skull missing, possibly taken by a Victorian workman as a curiosity piece. The skeleton was of a male in his mid-40s about 5 ft 6 ins in height. A radiocarbon date from the right femur gave a middle date of A.D. 410 for the burial; this is contemporary with the tile kiln recorded during excavations in the South Terrace of the church in 2005. 8. SOUTH-WESTERN COUNTIES By PAUL BOOTH GLOUCESTERSHIRE (1) Cirencester (Corinium Dobunnorum): (a) Arkenside Hotel, Lewis Lane (SP 0265 0180): an evaluation272 revealed deposits within the upper levels of rubble from demolished buildings that were of Roman character and date, though remained unexcavated. Evidence for a Roman dark earth was revealed in the central and southern parts of the site, but elsewhere this had been disturbed by medieval and post-medieval cultivation. (b) Kingshill North (SP 0365 0250): a small amount of securely datable Roman artefacts was recovered from an evaluation.273 In addition to the small assemblage from the upper fills of Iron Age features, a number of possible quarry pits also produced finds from the first century A.D. The lack of Roman activity so close to Corinium suggests that the site was on the periphery of the Roman settlement and that the quarry pits may be associated with the construction of the adjacent Akeman Street and/or Fosse Way. (c) New Leisure Centre, Tetbury Road (SP 0195 0175): a watching-brief recorded five heavily-truncated cremation burials and one extended inhumation, close to where cremations had previously been found in 1960.274 (2) Dymock: two silver denarii of Hadrian (both A.D. 118).275 269 Work by P.

Small-scale test-pitting confirmed the location of structures examined in the 1970s.276 (4) Frocester, Frocester Court Farm (SO 788 029): a small area was excavated in 2005 south- east of the main villa house.277 Lengths of ditches previously identified by geophysical survey were revealed. Associated with the ditches was a group of kilns. A small T-shaped kiln was superseded by a double T-shaped malting- or drying-kiln, while two further linear 'furnaces' lay close by. Most of these features were probably broadly contemporary and the majority of the dating evidence is of the fourth century. The finds included four tile stamps, two TPLF and two of ARVERI.278 (5) Gloucester (Glevum), Brunswick Road (SO 8320 1830): evaluation revealed part of the rampart of the town defences and the associated ditch.279 Within the defences a tessellated floor was found, and ditches and pits lay outside the ditch. (6) Lechlade, Butler 's Court, Downington (SP 2070 0000): a nine-trench evaluation uncovered four ditches interpreted as the boundaries of fields or agricultural enclosures, dated to the Roman period on the basis of a sherd of pottery. A single post-hole, a plough-furrow, and a tree throw hole were also recorded.280 SOMERSET (1) Bath, The Southgate Centre, Southgate Street (ST 75105 64475): evaluation was undertaken near the south wall of the Roman town, but relatively little Roman material was found.281 In one trench a series of peat layers separated by bands of alluvium were interpreted as being fills of a former stream channel, and the uppermost layers contained Roman and undated pottery. The lowest alluvial deposits in two trenches contained small quantities of Roman ceramic building material but this may have been residual. DEVON (1) Exeter (Isca), Princesshay (centred on SX 9223 9275): an area of more than 5,000m2 was excavated within this 4.7 ha site.282 The area lies outside the legionary fortress but mainly within the north-east quarter of the later Roman walled city, extending across the line of its defences. A length of the defensive ditches on the north-east side of the legionary fortress was examined; they showed broadly the same sequence as that encountered on other parts of the circuit, the upper fills of the later and outer ditch consisting of redeposited rampart material. Outside the fortress, the area was divided into rectangular plots bounded by ditches with 'V'-shaped profiles; two timber buildings were found within one plot, but much of the area appears to have been unoccupied. Extensive evidence of tile production was indicated by shallow clay pits containing tile wasters, with areas of burnt clay waste and charcoal, but no kiln structures were found; tile production continued into the mid-second century. 276 N.

This was overlain by a substantial stone building with a north-east range over 30 m long, a large central room, and a hypocaust. A second building nearby appeared to be a single-phase structure two rooms deep. The coin series from the site ceases in the A.D. 360s, when both buildings were apparently abandoned, conforming to the conclusion of Neil Holbrook that the fringes of the walled town were abandoned at this time. In the Saxo-Norman period both buildings were heavily robbed. Three lines of Roman 'V'-shaped defensive ditches, apparently in contemporary use, were found 13 m, 28 m, and 39 m outside the town wall; their original depths may be calculated res- pectively as 6 m, 3 m, and 4.5 m. (2) Hatherleigh Moor (SS 558 036): following the discovery of Roman tile wasters, geophysical survey by SW Archaeology has identified the probable site of a kiln, with possible evidence of ancillary structures.283 Petrological examination has shown that the tiles made here have a distinctive fabric. Study of the petrology of tiles from three other Roman sites in mid- Devon showed that at least five different tileries are represented.

SOUTHERN COUNTIES By PAUL BOOTH WILTSHIRE (1) Box, Box Vicarage (ST 823 685): an evaluation comprising two test pits revealed the existence of a probable Roman-period wall and natural colluvium sealed by a buried soil horizon on the line of new drainage works.285 The site occupied part of the Scheduled Ancient Monument of Box Roman Villa (SAM 30299), and fragments of Roman pottery and ceramic building material were recovered from both test pits.

No archaeological features or deposits were recorded.286 (3) Swindon: (a) Pipers Way (SU 162 825): an evaluation revealed few remains of archaeological significance, since much of the site had been heavily affected by landscaping which included both levelling and mounding of the existing topography.

This boundary is represented by chalk wall footings which are abutted by a linear stretch of flint masonry at its western end where the chalk foundations form a 'comer' and continue to the north-west. The flint foundations proved to be a means of reducing an original wide entrance or space between the south-west comer of the courtyard and a previously unrecorded building to the west. This new masonry building also had chalk foundations and comprised a large rectangular room with one much smaller room added to each side at the southern end. The function of the building, which is located outside the main villa complex, is uncertain, but could be agricultural, living accommodation, or perhaps a combination of the two. The two small rooms at the southern end suggest that this building may have had an impressive fagade to match that of the aisled building to the east, thus providing a reasonably symmetrical view to visitors approaching the villa complex from the south. Within the courtyard discoveries included a fenceline with an entrance which may have been an earlier phase of the villa complex, before it was enlarged and replaced by the courtyard wall. A Saxon sunken-featured building and a deep Saxon cess-pit were also found. Other investigations in 2006 included some trial-trenching to both the south and north-west of the villa complex. Although the trench to the south of the villa failed to locate any metalling for an approach road or track, trenching north-west of the villa revealed several anomalies located by a geophysical survey. Discoveries here included a Roman ditch and a possible metalled surface. Further away from the villa buildings, trial-trenching elsewhere on Culver Farm (c. TQ 4260 1495) was undertaken in order to establish the route of a Roman road which is thought to link the Offham area to the Greensand Way Roman road. Several areas of possible metalling were discovered, and near these were areas of Romano-British activity, perhaps industrial.303 (2) Burwash: a hoard of 1,863+ radiates to A.D. 268 found in a greyware pot.304 (3) Seaford: a mixed hoard of 18 silver denarii and 3 copper-alloy coins to A.D. 215.305 298 From the collection of metal-detectorist Mr K.

The road was located and found to consist of large hard- packed flints at its core, with smaller flints above that and the remnants of a pebble surface. A layer of tiles laid flat along the eastern edge was presumably a repair. The road was about 3 m wide and 300 mm deep at its thickest point, with a pronounced camber. The trench was extended to confirm that there was no other sign of a prepared surface in front of the villa at this point. The westernmost of two very large spoil-heaps near the villa was partially excavated to deter- mine the potential for replacing the material on the villa site in due course. A further spoil-heap was related to the detached bath-house, but the precise location of this remains to be established. Finds from the excavated spoil-heap were mostly of tile of all types, and included a substantial piece of a 'lamp chimney' and many red tesserae. Finds from the nearby road trench included an unidentified coin, pottery, and again many tile fragments. Both areas produced many pieces of relief-patterned box-flue tiles. The road was also tested further away from the villa, on the line recorded by the Ordnance Survey. One set of test pits failed to locate any evidence for a road but did produce Roman pottery and tile in some quantity. At a more distant location the road was found about 7 or 8 m to the east of the published line. Here it was of much poorer quality than in the trench close to the villa. It was only about 100 mm thick, although deeper where it filled depressions in the ground surface, onto which it had apparently been laid with little preparation. The metalling was predominantly small water-washed pebbles but with some small flints, not sorted by size or layered in any way. A small ditch was present on the downhill side.

At the southern end of the site was a possible channel or depression filled with an organic layer, while all of the southern area was covered by an alluvial deposit containing residual Roman finds dating from A.D. 50-120. This deposit may relate to the flooding of the Roman settlement which occurred around A.D. 220. 306 Excavated between 1924 and 1929 by A.W.G. Lowther, see principally Surrey Archaeol.

The north-south line of the town wall was established and an external render of crushed-tile mortar exposed at one point. A blocked Roman gateway was identified. Similar in design to the nearby London Gate, though, at its narrowest, only 1.475 m (5 pM) wide, it was of flint with jambs and string-course in lydion tiles. GPR, resistivity, mechanical probing and limited excavation failed to locate any internal or external towers, though one anomaly may be a building pre-dating the wall and rampart. Further evidence was found for various buildings already identified south of Roman Watling Street but much of the central portion was probably occupied by one or more courtyards. An apsidal room was probably equipped with, or adjacent to, a hypocaust: augering suggested that the furnace for this had four or five phases of flooring and an associated flue at least three. The existence of a putative side road was disproved.314 (b) Whitehall Road (TR 14365 57883): a receptor pit cut to tunnel an electricity supply under the river Stour exposed a pit cut by an east-west ditch (of c. A.D. 25-75) and another pit (of c. A.D. 150-250), containing possible kiln debris. The ditch had been repeatedly cut by deep north- east-south-west wheel ruts, several packed with gravel and stones, before the first of two gravel metallings were laid on the same alignment, sealing all three features.315 (c) 1 Ryde Street (TR 14223 58237): evaluation prior to residential development revealed street metallings dated by a large fragment of Central Gaulish samian (Drag. 31) to A.D. 120- 180, making it comparable with other small streets in the extramural area between the roads from London Gate (Watling Street) and West Gate (modem St Dunstan's Street). A ditch pre- dating the road may relate to a postulated field-system contemporary with 'Belgic'/early Roman settlement in this area.316 (d) 21a-22a Palace Street (TR 1500 5851): evaluation prior to the extension of the property revealed two metalled surfaces and associated levelling layers sealed by 'dark earth'.317 (e) New Dover Road (TR 1560 5750): evidence for burial activity was recorded during a watching-brief maintained in the northern area of the campus during development at Canterbury College. An amphora seen in section may have represented a disturbed cremation burial. Other disturbed inhumation burials were not certainly Roman.318 (f) Rhodaus Town, Augustine House (TR 14991 57352): five evaluation trenches cut prior to redevelopment319 provided further evidence for extensive brickearth quarrying previously attributed to extramural industrial activity.320 Pottery from a backfilled quarry pit indicated 311 Work by A.

(g) 5-5a Rhodaus Town (TR 14961 57294): evaluation321 in another area of the same development uncovered an inhumation burial probably of early third-century date. Similar inhumations have been recorded on the site and nearby.322 (h) Whitefriars: a hoard of 698 Roman bronze coins to A.D. 402 was found during archaeological excavation.323 (3) Cobham, Jeskyn 's Farm (centred on TQ 6640 6920): during evaluation of an area of approximately 149 ha destined to become a Community Greenspace, geophysical survey324 and consequent excavation identified two enclosures with associated ditches and features 250 m apart on Winstead Hill. The enclosures were rectangular and irregular in plan, one measuring c. 60 by 45 m (at TQ 6636 6948) and the other 40 by 35 m (at TQ 6633 6974). Pottery suggested a second-century date. North of the enclosures were shallow pits and a pair of ditches possibly representing another enclosure, and the foundations of a rectangular structure (at TQ 6628 6997) also of probable second-century date.325 (4) Dartford: (a) The Bridge, Bob Dunn Way (TQ 5540 7570): a watching-brief was carried out on groundworks associated with the redevelopment of The Bridge site into a mixed use scheme.326 No evidence was found that the known Roman cremation cemetery located to the east extended into the site, although some residual finds were recovered. (b) Leigh Technology College, Green Street, Green Road (TQ 55337 73215): following two earlier evaluations in 2005, a watching-brief was carried out during ground reduction.327 A single Roman burial and a large Roman boundary ditch were recorded. (5) Deal, Sholden, Hull Place (TR 3572 5297): investigations continued at the villa site previously reported.328 Building B was further examined and found to contain 11 rooms and corridors. Although only the foundations survived, five phases of development were identified and in its final form the structure consisted of a rectangular block measuring a maximum of 15 m (NW-SE) by 23.5 m (NE-SW). There was a large projecting room on the north-west side, with a hypocausted room at the west corner and a room with an apse at the south-west end. Building B was apparently earlier than Building A, previously examined, and it would seem that these two structures represent successive villa houses. Further evidence of late Iron Age to early Roman occupation on the site prior to the construction of the villa buildings was also identified.329 (6) Sandwich, Archer 's Low Farm (TR 3390 5763): test-pitting across the Sandowns, to the east of Sandwich, in connection with a search for the site of the original Anglo-Saxon town, revealed further evidence for the late Iron Age-Roman occupation site near Archer's Low Farm, 321 Work by D.

Finds Reported under the Portable Antiquities Scheme By SALLY WORRELL INTRODUCTION The Portable Antiquities Scheme (PAS) was established in 19971 as an initiative to record archaeological objects found by members of the general public. Funding from the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) enabled the extension of the PAS to the whole of England and Wales. The PAS was funded from 2003 until 31 March 2006 by the HLF and local partners and has been funded since April 2006 by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) and local partners. Surveys of Roman-period finds recorded by the PAS have been published in Britannia annually since 2004. This fourth report adopts the same format with a brief overview of finds distribution followed by descriptions of significant individual artefacts and assemblages. OVERVIEW 60,528 artefacts were recorded on the PAS database in 2006, 27,308 (45 per cent) of which are Roman in date. This figure includes those finds to which a date has been attributed that spans the late Iron Age and early Roman period. It represents a substantial increase from 2005 (Table 1), which can largely be attributed to the inclusion of backlog records of Roman coins from Norfolk (see below). The 2006 data include 6,635 pottery sherds and 227 tile and architectural fragments. Otherwise the artefacts recorded are as usual predominantly metallic. TABLE 1. QUANTITIES OF ALL ARTEFACTS AND ROMAN FINDS RECORDED ON THE PAS DATABASE FROM 2003 TO 2006 All artefacts Roman Roman artefacts artefacts as % 2003 21,658 9,915 45.8 2004 39,199 16,579 42.3 2005 52,094 17,992 34.5 2006 60,528 27,308 45.0 Many of the finds recorded by the PAS come from sites which have been damaged or eroded, usually by agriculture. In some cases they may be the only surviving traces of past activity at particular locations. Of the Roman artefacts reported during 2006, approximately 78 per cent were discovered using a metal-detector. Table 2 shows the number of Roman non-ceramic artefacts reported by county and grouped by PAS region, the figures being derived from the PAS database. In contrast to previous years, a very significant number of coin and artefact records from Norfolk have been entered onto the database. However it should be noted that these record only some of the very many artefacts presented for identification in the county in recent years. All records have, however, been entered onto the Norfolk Historic Environment 1 Pilot projects were established in Kent, Norfolk, the West Midlands, North Lincolnshire, Yorkshire, and the North-West in September 1997, followed by projects in Hampshire, Somerset and Dorset, Northamptonshire, Suffolk, and Wales in January 1999. During 2003 the PAS expanded to cover the remaining English counties. © World copyright reserved.

Individual large-scale metal-detecting rallies can also produce significant numbers of Roman finds records. Examples from 2006 include events at Letcombe Regis, Oxon. (355 finds) and at Snape (30 finds) and Well (55 finds), North Yorks. As stressed in previous reports, annual statistics for the PAS are skewed by factors of this kind. Artefacts that qualify as treasure under the terms of the Treasure Act 1996 are generally excluded from this survey but are published in the Treasure Annual Report by the British Museum. For convenience of presentation, and to enable comparison with other datasets, the subdivision of artefacts by function is based on the scheme proposed by Crummy,2 with some modifications. 2 N.

Excluding the high quantity of coins from Norfolk, only the brooch (A), toilet and medical equipment (B), religious object (F), fourth-century belt fittings (J), and miscellaneous (L) categories show an increase, although there are notable decreases in numbers recorded of household utensils etc. (D), objects associated with written communication (E), first- to third-century military equipment (I), and studs/mounts (K). Coins (82 per cent) are the most common artefact type: the percentage recorded in 2006 is higher than that in 2005 (70.5 per cent), 2004 (72.8 per cent), and 2003 (72.7 per cent), although if records from Norfolk were excluded the proportion would be similar to previous years (72.4 per cent). There is regional variation in the categories and quantities of artefact recorded. In the 24 counties from which more than 100 coins have been recorded, the proportion of the total finds which they represent was calculated. The average percentage for these counties is 76.4 per cent, but the proportion varies from 62 per cent in Northamptonshire to 92.6 per cent in Norfolk. In the 2006 data brooches constitute 9.3 per cent and other items of personal adornment 2.4 per cent of all non-ceramic artefacts recorded. However in counties with larger samples of brooches (&gt;50), the proportions vary from 3.7 per cent (Norfolk) to 21 per cent (Leicestershire). Brooches are typically found much more frequently than items of personal adornment (Table 1, A and B) but in Northamptonshire more objects of personal adornment (42) than brooches (39) were recorded. This difference can be attributed to the exceptional collection recorded from Higham Ferrers. Of the 28 Roman pins from Northamptonshire recorded on the PAS database since 1999, 25 examples were recorded from this site in 2006. Norfolk aside, there remains wide variation in the number of artefacts recorded between counties, from 3 in Devon to 2,022 in Suffolk (Table 2), with higher numbers continuing to be recorded in eastern counties. Numbers of finds recorded year by year in the same county vary substantially. Many fewer finds have been recorded this year from Durham and many more from Oxfordshire and Cambridgeshire, but such differences are often the product of individual assemblages reported: many of the Oxfordshire finds, for example, derive from the rally at Letcombe Regis noted above. In general, however, as indicated in the previous report, findspots, if not finds, are now more broadly and more evenly distributed across southern, central and eastern England than in the first years of the scheme (FIG. 1). There are higher densities of 2006 findspots, for example, in North Yorkshire, Shropshire, Herefordshire, Hertfordshire, Essex, Cambridgeshire, and East Sussex than in previous years. The entries below set out some highlights of the past year's discoveries recorded by Finds Liaison Officers.3 Fuller details of the finds recorded by the Portable Antiquities Scheme can be obtained from the Scheme's central office4 and there are full descriptions of finds on the PAS website: www.finds.org.uk. The reference number in brackets is the PAS identifying find record,5 with the exception of the two finger-rings from Little Cornard and Icklingham, Suffolk (see below) which were reported as Treasure under the terms of the Treasure Act 1996. A selection of the most significant Roman coin finds recorded with the Portable Antiquities Scheme are included in the annual 'Coin Register' in the British Numismatic Journal. As well as individual artefacts, it is also worth recording here that the broader characteristics of the PAS 3 Throughout the year, staff in the British Museum, in particular Ralph Jackson, J.D.

The bust wears a tunic draped over one shoulder, has a rope-like border across the chest and a decorative motif consisting of four petals or leaves on the left breast. The facial features are worn; the wavy, mid-length hair covers most of the forehead. At the crown there is a moulded circular element with a central circular moulded pellet and below, on each side, there is a leaf and a bunch of grapes at each ear. On the reverse of the bust, only the back of the head is decorated. There is an integral, copper-alloy circular-sectioned shank which extends horizontally from the centre of the figure's back, turns upwards almost at right angles and has a rounded terminal. Each of the tripod legs would have had a similar mount which would have suspended a copper-alloy bowl by means of rings attached to the rim of the vessel. The base below the calyx appears to take the form of a column capital with a central longitudinal groove with convex and oblique grooves on each side forming a leaf. The lower edge of the base is notched or broken. No other decorated copper-alloy tripod mounts of this type are known from Britain, but similar tripod mounts of Bacchus have been found at Xanten15 and Bavai.16 13 E.M.

The identity of the quadruped is unclear; it appears to be bear-like, but the circular scar of the missing tail, with an oblique incised line on either side, is larger than might be expected for a bear. An integrally- cast 'prong' between the underside of the testicles indicates that the amulet is free-standing rather than a pendant. It is 44.2 mm long, 10.2 mm wide, 16.6 mm high, and weighs 13.28 g. Although no direct parallel is known, artefacts which combine zoomorphic and phallic imagery are found in the form of tintinnabula and as amulets with phalli transformed into animals.18 Other phallic ornaments in which animals are incorporated as part of the design include a bull's head phallic pendant from Icklingham, Suffolk, where the phallus projects centrally from the nose.19 FIG. 5.

The body is decorated with a series of linear ridges extending along its back and legs, which probably represent rolls within the ram's wool. The figurine is 26.4 mm long, 12.4 mm wide, 26.2 mm high, and it weighs 17.95 g. It may have been part of a larger group of figures associated with the cult of Mercury.

At the top of the head are the remains of an integral, circular loop to hold a handle. The ears project to the side, each with a central oval depression. Projecting forward are two horns, crescentic in profile, one of which is near-complete. The head tapers to a long, rather slender nose. The circular eyes originally held red enamel, which survives in the left eye, with traces in the right. The muzzle flares outwards at its straight base and the circular, shallow nostrils and the concave mouth are incised. The sides of the mount are slightly faceted. The back is hollow in order to contain solder to attach the mount to a vessel and there are also traces of mineralised wood. The back also has an integral, sub-rectangular lug projecting at a right angle below the loop, before curving downwards. The mount is 46 mm long, 24.3 mm wide, has a maximum thickness of 21.2 mm, and weighs 20.9 g. A similar example, also with a square muzzle and forward-curving horns, is known from Dinorben hillfort, Conwy.23 In form it is also broadly similar to an example from Poole's Cavern, Derbys., which has a lug on the back, but also has two rivets for attachment to the vessel.24 21 S.S.

The plate is rectangular with four loops for the attachment of the buckle, which was held by an iron bar, of which part survives. In each corner of the plate are circular rivet-holes containing the remains of corroded iron rivets. The plate has open-work decoration in the form of an arcade of three arches arranged with two smaller parallel arches and one larger arch below. Each arch contains a human head each with two circular indentations representing eyes and a straight groove for the mouth. There are also three ring-and-dot motifs stamped across the centre of the plate and a further example beneath the centre of the lower arch. The edges of the plate have small transverse grooves/nicks along them and each comer has a rounded projection. Although no direct parallel for this buckle plate is known, there are similarities with plates from Lydney Park, Glos., and Sarre, Kent, although neither example has human head motifs projecting from an arch.69 65 Found by V.

The horse and male rider are both almost complete and were made as separate, solid, three-dimensional castings. They were discovered together as one piece but subsequently became detached due to the disintegration of the heavily corroded iron spike that had held them together. Copper-alloy figurines of mounted and armoured men representing rider gods, probably a native version of Mars, are known from several sites in Britain, most of which are in the East Midlands and northern East Anglia. This example is distinguished by the attention to detail in its modelling. It is most similar to a figurine found in Lincolnshire, but in the vicinity of the Roman site at Brough, Notts.71 The rider's right arm is raised and the hand probably held a spear which is now missing. His left arm is lowered and held away from the body. His hand, which is likely to have held a shield, is missing. The figure wears a crested helmet, a short pleated tunic with short sleeves, a belt and a cloak which billows out behind him. He has short hair, the face is oval as are the large eyes, the nose is wedge-shaped, and the mouth is depicted by a short, horizontal slit. The horse is well- modelled and advances at a canter with its forelegs extended, unlike other examples depicted with the four feet on the ground or in a trotting forward motion.72 The pricked ears, similar to those on the Lincolnshire example, also indicate that the horse is alert. The proportions of the horse are anatomically incorrect; the slender body is very narrow and the legs are elongated. The right hind lower leg below the hock is missing. The tapering tail is long and slender. The small head is raised, the large eyes are oval and are very reminiscent in shape to those of the rider, the ears are pricked, the muzzle rounded, the nostrils flared, and the mouth slightly open. Wavy mouldings and grooves down either side of the neck depict the mane which is also 'twisted' into five projecting 'plaits'. The first 'plait' is the forelock and is depicted as considerably longer than the others. The body is adorned with an elaborately decorated band, passing around the front of 70 Found by D. Pangborn.

The horse from Westwood Bridge, Peterborough also wears a saddle-cloth and the feathers or other ornament in its forelock represent the only other mane decoration so far recorded on figurines of this type.74 A corroded, circular-sectioned iron shaft passes through the centre of the horse's body, the possible saddle-cloth, and the base of the rider and would originally have held the rider in position. 73 C.

He is seated with his right leg bent vertically in front of his left leg which lies horizontally. The right arm is held close to the body and the flat hand, with the digits realistically depicted, rests on the left knee. The rounded end of the right foot does not portray individual toes and the left foot is missing. The boy's head tilts to the right and rests on his right hand. The tightly curled 'Afro-style' hair and the facial features are realistically modelled. There is an off-centre circular socket, 6.3 mm in diameter and 7 mm deep, at the top of the head. The belly protrudes slightly with the navel represented by a faint depression. The penis rests against the left bent leg. The back is moulded with prominent shoulder blades and a shallow groove down the spine. The buttocks are flat and divided by a slight incised line. The figurine is 57.4 mm high, 38 mm wide, and weighs 163.6 g. This figure may be a representation of a slave boy who has fallen asleep waiting for his master at a party whom he will later guide home by lamplight. Similar figures are shown on lamps and those shown asleep with amphorae may hint at a party taking place 'off-stage'.76 Although a close parallel for this figurine is thought to be a Hellenistic original,77 it is more likely that the figurine discussed here is a second-century copy rather than a Hellenistic original surviving as an heirloom in Roman Britain.78 FIG. 27.

In this case a link between slavery and the weighing and trading of goods might be symbolised. However, though the depression is certainly central to the figure, enabling it to hang straight, other figured steelyard weights normally had an integral copper-alloy suspension-loop. Alternatively, the depression may have held a soldered spike for a candle, although the candle would have been extremely slender.79 A more likely alternative is that the depression held some sort of lamp arrangement; the flat base of the figure may suggest that it was soldered to a separate base which would have given greater stability.

The facial features and hair-style are very similar to a bust/applique found at Cirencester, Glos., which has an iron pin/shank probably for attachment to an item of furniture.130 It is suggested that the Cirencester appliqu6 may depict Venus owing to its nudity, although its elaborate hair-style may also suggest a link with portraiture.

Wright in The Roman Inscriptions of Britain Vol. i (Oxford, 1965), henceforth cited as RIB. Citation is by item and not page number. Inscriptions on PERSONAL BELONGINGS and the like (instrumentum domesticum) have been arranged alphabetically by site under their counties. For each site they have been ordered as in RIB, pp. xiii-xiv. The items of instrumentum domesticum published in the eight fascicules of RIB II (1990-95), edited by S.S. Frere and R.S.O. Tomlin, are cited by fascicule, by the number of their category (RIB 2401-2505) and by their sub-number within it (e.g. RIB 11.2, 2415. 53). When measurements are quoted, the width precedes the height. Mr Hassall (MWCH) is responsible for entries Nos 4, 7, 12-14, 19-23; Dr Tomlin (RSOT) for the others, and for overall editing. 2 During excavation for Tyne and Wear Museums. Nick Hodgson and Alex Croom sent details, including a squeeze and photographs. 3 Lucius is a nomen of Celtic etymology, not the Roman praenomen L(ucius). The cognomen is Octavus, with the loss of intervocalic v before i. This text coincides with three slender vertical strokes: within 7, just after the medial point (with a suprascript bar), and between C and T. They are perhaps casual, or remains of an earlier text, or related to line 2. 4 Between the two medial points is one, perhaps two, vertical strokes; then a faintly-incised F; and space for a third letter, with a short diagonal stroke appropriate to R. After this, F is quite deeply incised, but different in character from line 1: its strokes are quite straight, and serifed. The last letter in the line is an almost vertical S, or I. Line 2 is difficult to explain; perhaps it contains the initials of members of the century. © World copyright reserved.

Tomlin) 5 During excavation and consolidation of the west wall directed by Andrew Birley for the Vindolanda Trust. The type of stone is characteristic of third-century work at Vindolanda, and the context is probably early fourth-century. Robin Birley made it available, and it has now been published with full commentary by Anthony Birley, in A. Birley and J. Blake, Vindolanda Excavations 2005-2006 (2007), 104-12, with fig. 130. 6 This translation understands cives as referring both to 'Gauls' and to 'Britons', but the Latin is ambiguous. Sense likewise requires that concordes refer to both, although word-order applies it to the 'Britons' alone. But to understand 3-4 as 'and [sc. only] the Britons who agree with them', although grammatically possible, would be forced. The notes which follow should be read in conjunction with Birley (see previous note), to whom we are indebted for an advance copy of his text. 1, cives Galli. The only other dedications in Britain by cives (plural) are by national groups within a military unit: see RIB 1593 and 1594 (Tuihanti), 2100 (Raeti), 2148 (Italici et Norici). The term civis Gallus is very rare (ILS 7576), and Birley is surely right to see cives Galli as a collective term for soldiers recruited from Gallia Lugdunensis who were serving in the cohors IIII Gallorum, the third-century garrison of Vindolanda. Like the inscriptions just cited, this shows that the army in Britain was not altogether recruited locally. The practice of naming the dedicator before the deity is more common elsewhere, but in Britain it is rare: the only instances are RIB 140 (Bath), 652 (York), 1057 (South Shields), Britannia 8 (1977), 426, No. 4 (Dover) and 36 (2005), 482, No. 10 (uncertain provenance); the first is explicitly dedicated by a civis Trever, and the other dedicators may also be immigrants. 2, de(ae) Galliae.

Vindolanda, inscribed stone base (No. 2). Width: 0.56 m. (Drawn by R.S.O. Tomlin) 3. Ibid. (NY 768 663) (FIG. 3). Grey sandstone building-stone, 0.26 by 0.18 m, squared off crudely from a rough slab 0.14 m thick, found7 unstratified in 2006 to the west of the site. The inscription is cut by the edge of the stone, and would not have been visible when this was incorporated in a wall, so it must belong to the quarrying or preliminary working. Crudely incised: [...]OIVI or [...]OIIA.8 (for figures see following page) 11.29, 2 (1983), 900. Although matres Gallae are known (RIB 88, 653), this seems to be the first instance of dea Gallia; but the personification would be as natural as those of Britannia and Brigantia (see Birley, ANRW 11.18, 1 (1986), 66-7). 3-4. Concordia was a deity honoured when discord was feared, and in Britain hitherto has marked the 'brigading' of vexillations from two different legions: see RIB 1125 (Corbridge) and Britannia 20 (1989), 331, No. 4 (Carlisle). The occasion of the Vindolanda dedication can only be guessed, but perhaps it was tension within the cohort between drafts from Britain and Gaul. Although lines 1-2 occupy two-thirds of the die, it is unlikely that 'the Gauls' intended concordes to refer to themselves alone, and then added -que Britanni as an afterthought; miscalculation and poor execution are a more likely explanation. But it would have been more effective, and unambiguous, if lines 3 and 4 had read et Britanni I concordes instead. 7 During excavation directed by Justin Blake for the Vindolanda Trust. Robin Birley made it available. It has now been published by Anthony Birley in Birley and Blake (see above, n. 5), 112, with fig. 131. 8 Visually either reading is possible. The stroke which is the first of 'V', or the second of 'A', is rather vertical, but the lettering is too poor for this to signify. Neither sequence of vowels is characteristic of Latin, but OEA is found in the place-names Oea (Tripoli) and Beroea (in Macedonia, Thrace and Syria). Inverting the stone with Birley (see previous note) is also possible, but the resulting VIIO[...] or IAIO[...] are still difficult. His tentative suggestion oflao for IAIO may be rejected for the reasons he gives. 347</page><page sequence="108">ROMAN BRITAIN IN 2006 FIG. 3(a). Vindolanda, inscribed stone slab (No. 3).

He has now donated it to the British Museum. 17 A woman is probably envisaged as the speaker, but the Latin is ambiguous. J.N. Adams, The Latin Sexual Vocabulary (1982), 121, notes that venio is mostly used by a man of a woman coming to him, although it is also used at Pompeii by men who come to a brothel; and 118-22, thatfutuo, except in the passive, is normally used of the man's role in sexual intercourse with a woman, although, again at Pompeii, it is used in brothels as the 'unemotive technical term' by prostitutes and their clients. If the ring was worn by a woman, presumably she was a prostitute. For the type of ring and the style of inscription, compare RIB 11.3, 2422.66 (eight facets, valiatis) and, in silver, Britannia 37 (2006), 485, No. 59 (ten facets, uterefelix). The legend is unparalleled in Britain, and apparently elsewhere, but compare RIB 11.3, 2422.61, veni TERMO mane ('come (and) stay'); CIL xiii 10024.70, fruere me ('enjoy me'); ibid. 80, veni vita ('come, (my) life'). These are rings of various types, but a better comparison is with the Rhineland 'motto beakers' which read futue me, futuite, and futuui (h)ospita(m) (CIL xiii 10018.92, 93 and 95, respectively). The latter, with its perfect form futuui forfutui, exhibits the same 'glide' as infutuue, where [w] has been inserted between a back vowel and another vowel in hiatus: see Adams in Britannia 23 (1992), 10, commenting on Tab. Sulis 31.5, suua. This is not found in the many examples of the verb from Pompeii. 18 By metal detector; given by the finder to Mark Maillard, who gave it to RSOT. 19 The centurion's cognomen might be Flaccus (etc.), but is much more likely to be derived from his nomen, whether Flavianus or Flavinus (for which compare RIB 675, the tombstone of T. Flavius Flavinus, centurion of Legion VI Victrix). The sealing is closely related to RIB II. 1, 2411.269a (see below, Corrigendum (d)). The obverses seem to be the same, and the drawing of RIB II.1, 2411.269a suggests that II was barred, like most of the legion's sealings; this is not apparent on the present item, but the top edge is rather worn. The reverses are identical in style, with distinctive F and diminutive centurial sign, but RIB II. 1, 2411.269a has FL instead of FLA, and apparently no medial points. 351</page><page sequence="112">ROMAN BRITAIN IN 2006 FIG. 8(a).

'Long life to you, ...'.24 20 During excavation for the Danebury Environs Project directed by Professor Barry Cunliffe. Emma Durham made it available. 21 A mark of identification, perhaps a numeral or a name in -meius in the genitive case, but such names are very rare. This is the only 'literate' sherd from a site which has produced twelve greyware sherds scratched after firing with a 'cross', and two with more complex patterns. 22 During excavation by Albion Archaeology directed by Reuben Thorpe, who will deposit it in North Hertfordshire Museums Resource Centre, Letchworth Museum and Art Gallery (acc. no. BAL860/2004). Holly Duncan made it available, and provided a photograph and details of provenance; Martin Henig provided a copy of his report. 23 In style it resembles coin-portraits of Constantius II's Caesars in the 350s, for example Julian from the mint of Arles (RIC VIII, 220, No. 240 with pl. 7). The closest British parallel for this bust with legend is the Silchester silver ring RIB 11.3, 2422.25, Iul(ius) Bellator vivas; compare also 42 (Silchester), vivas. Henig discusses further parallels, noting that vivas may have a Christian reference, but would need the addition of in deo (compare RIB 11.3, 2422.13 and 15) to be explicit. 24 These tiny letters with their complicating serifs are too ambiguous for the name to be read. It clearly ends in S, as would be expected. Working backwards, the next letter resembles C, but is presumably V at an angle; then IL (but possibly II for E), and then R. Before this R, which is certain, there is probably M, but VN would be possible. It is preceded by I, and then the initial letter, which resembles an incomplete O or C with a medial point; but its tail may extend into the bust, making P another possibility. The terminal sequence RLIVS suggests a blundered Aurelius, but the preceding letters make this unlikely. 353</page><page sequence="114">ROMAN BRITAIN IN 2006 0 5 10mm FIG. 10.

This took the impression of letters incised into the bottom of the mould, here called the 'obverse', while the 'reverse' was impressed from above by means of a rectangular die. This can be seen from the drawings to RIB II.1, 2411. 79, 80 and 269a (see below, Corrigendum (d)), and in general the mould must have named the legion or auxiliary unit (thus called the 'obverse'), while the die was specific to the issuing officer; indeed the latter is sometimes a figure without lettering, made with a personal signet. In RIB II.1, p. 88, we over- generalise from the 'EXP' group in expanding L and LEG in the nominative case; the genitive (as here) is more likely. 30 T has been inverted to save space: it fits neatly against V, and is certainly not a reversed L.

Just possibly he is the same man, transferring from one legion in Britain to another. 31 LE is ligatured, and VI barred. There is a short medial stroke to the right of VI, but it seems without significance; it may even extend between V and I, and be only a blemish in the mould. 32 The scorpion, with its tail curving left, three (not four) visible pairs of legs and a pair of pincers, is probably Scorpio, the man's zodiacal sign.

By analogy with other sealings, MVC is more likely to be the officer's initials than his abbreviated cognomen (Mucianus, etc.); much the likeliest nomen is Valerius. 35 The third digit of the numeral can just be differentiated from the border, especially since line 2 confirms the edge of the panel. The second letter of line 2 is not I or T, but undoubtedly Y. Its fourth 'letter' is too angular for 0, since the mould-cutter could cut a curving line if he needed to (witness C). Instead it is a triangular stop to indicate abbreviation. 357</page><page sequence="118">ROMAN BRITAIN IN 2006 LINCOLNSHIRE 18. Frampton (TF 32 39).

Perhaps a soldier or centurion of Legion VI Victrix brought this mould with him from his previous posting; such a transfer, but in reverse, is implied by IGLS 9188 (Bostra), which was dedicated by a centurion of Legion III Cyrenaica who was British by origin, Petrullo domo Britan(nus). Marcus Verrius Celsus, who was probably a centurion of Legion III Cyrenaica (CIL x 3734), has the right initials, but he seems too early in date. 36 By C.

Sally Worrell sent a photograph and details. 47 During excavation directed by Professor Sheppard Frere, who tells us that the context (DI 85) was the robber trench of the Hadrianic praetorium before it was rebuilt in the governorship of Alfenus Senecio. Ray McBride made the sherd available. 48 A.D. 185. The first two letters are sinuous strokes of which only the bottom half survives, but the first was presumably cut by a crossbar which developed into the second downward stroke, i.e. ligatured TI. The word probably ended with CO, and the sequence is appropriate to a Roman cognomen in the ablative case, i.e. part of a consular date. This would be second-century, but Hadriano Aug. II et Rustico (119) and Asiatico II et Aquilino (125) seem too early. The other possibilities are Rustico II et Aquilino (162) and Materno et Attico (185). The uninscribed space below [...]TICO[...] indicates that it belongs to the last line; and since these dating-graffiti are fairly compact, it is thus more likely to be the end of the second consul's name, not the first. This would favour A.D. 185 rather than 162, especially since the cursive is less fluent and assured than that of mid-second-century dates; and the fabric, reddish and rather thin, does not suit them either. 49 This is the usual position of potters' signatures on Dressel 20, which were presumably made while the vessel was still upside-down on the wheel. Surviving examples are fragmentary, and not many have been published, but they consist of names and dates, especially consular dates of the mid-second century. See R. Rodriguez-Almeida, II Monte Testaccio (1984), 256-7; and for British examples, Britannia 28 (1997), 464, No. 3, and 471-2, Corrigenda (a) and (e). 360</page><page sequence="121">R.S.O. TOMLIN AND M.W.C. HASSALL NORTHAMPTONSHIRE 27. Towcester (Lactodurum, SP 6941 4891). Three irregular fragments of inscribed sheet lead, c. 1 mm thick, found50 in 1992 in the topsoil above a Roman cemetery outside the north-eastern defences.51 They do not conjoin, but are probably parts of one tablet since they are all inscribed in the same (probably third-century) cursive on both faces, and apparently by the same hand. The surviving text is very incomplete, with no margins extant, and many letters damaged. A few sequences can be read, and are transcribed here in capitals, and identified by line. Fragment (a), folded once, c. 50 by 50 mm. Outside: trace of eight lines, including 7, GENETIVM. Inside: trace of seven lines, including 5, ETMA.52 Fragment (b), not folded, c. 65 by 50 mm.

Silver and base-metal brooch, found55 in 2006 in the compressed flooring material of a Hadrianic workshop to the west of the site. Within a circle of 'pie-crust' edging, 38 mm in diameter, stands a figure of Mars now headless, between two standards flanked by shields; below, three leaf terminals hang by chains. It was secured from behind by means of a buckle, with a plate (38 by 8 mm) on which the owner's name has been inscribed in punched dots: Q o SOLLONI 7 CVPI, Q(uinti) SolloniI (centuria) Cupi(ti). '(Property) of Quintus Sollonius, century of Cupitus.'56 50 During evaluation by the Cotswold Archaeological Trust, for which see Britannia 24 (1993), 293. Charmian and Paul Woodfield made the fragments available to RSOT, whose full report will appear when the excavations are published. 51 The fragmentary formula in fragment (c) identifies it as a 'curse tablet' prompted by theft. The text seems to have included personal names in the accusative case, which would have been those of persons cursed, whether as enemies or suspected thieves; lists of such names, but in the nominative case, are frequent in British 'curse tablets'. An ancient magical handbook recommends burying a lead curse tablet in a grave, and examples of this practice are known, but not yet from Britain. In view of its find-spot, however, it is possible that this tablet was deliberately buried in a grave. 52 Probably the personal name Geneti(v)um in the accusative case, and perhaps et Ma[..], another personal name. 53 There is damage to the left of NVTVM, but it seems to be complete. If so, it is not the personal name [Cor]nutum, but perhaps nutum ('will'). 3 is perhaps [h]uius n[o]bis ... ('of this to us'). 4 is perhaps a verb-ending, for example [adi]uvat ('helps'). 54 Outside 1 is perhaps et de[us] ('and the god'). LIBER in 2 is certain, so this is the formula [si] liber si ser[vus] ('whether free or slave') typical of 'curse tablets'. 6 is perhaps a verb in the third-person plural imperfect subjunctive, such as [pe]teren[t], or the personal name Teren[tium] or one of its derivatives in the accusative case. 7 is the personal name Cunomorinum in the accusative case. 8 is the end of a personal name in the accusative case, probably [Hil]arianum, [M]arianum or [V]arianum. Inside 1 is perhaps the feminine personal name Vassura, which is not attested, but might have been derived like other names from the Celtic name-element vasso-s. 2 is probably the personal name [Cuno]moltum in the accusative case. 4 is perhaps [...]ses et eri[nt] (a plural word-ending, conjunction, and auxiliary verb, '... and will be ...'). 5 is perhaps a verb in the third-person plural perfect, but the incomplete first letter is rather large for V (say for [inv]eneru[nt]), and most resembles S. Two of the personal names, both Celtic and hitherto unattested, are noteworthy. Cunomorinus evidently derives from Cunomorus, which occurs on a sub-Roman gravestone from Cornwall (Macalister, CIIC, No. 487). Cunomoltus (the T here is certain) should now also be read in Tab. Sulis 9.5, where the T was read as a heavily serifed I [for Cunomolius], but the drawing supports T. 55 During excavation for the Vindolanda Trust directed by Justin Blake. Robin Birley sent details and made the inscribed buckle available. The brooch is now published in Birley and Blake (see above, note 5), cover illustration, with 68 (find-spot), 102-4 (the inscribed fastener, by Anthony Birley), 142-3 (the brooch, by Patricia Birley). 56 The first letter is oddly composed of six large dots (resembling angular C) overlying five small dots (resembling 7), as if a centurial sign was 'corrected' by C for G(ai), but in view of the instances of Quintus Sol(l)onius adduced by Birley (see previous note), it is better read as a cramped Q for Q(uinti).

Quintus Sollonius, as a Roman citizen at this date, would have been a legionary; and his legion was most likely II Augusta, in view of Tab. Vindol. II, 214 (its aquilifer writes to 'his little brother' at Vindolanda) and RIB 344 (the centurion Claudius Cupitus at Caerleon). 57 During excavation by Archaeological Services (WYAS), for which see Britannia 36 (2005), 417. Alison Morgan, Post Excavation Officer, made the sherds (DCW94, 173-1) available through Margaret Ward, who dated them and provided other information. 58 This personal name is fairly common, with four other certain instances from Britain, but it may be noted that two were found at Castleford, the next fort to the north (RIB 11.7, 2501.22 and RIB 11.8, 2503.172, the second probably late Flavian and thus contemporary). The graffito ends in a long vertical line, perhaps indicating abbreviation, but more likely part of a previous mark of identification.

See further, Corrigenda (a), (b) and (c). 63 This reverse die is shared by another four sealings, i.e. the next item and RIB II.1, 2411.103, 104 and 105 (for which see Corrigenda (a), (b) and (c)). AEM is unlikely to be the decurion's initials, since A(ulus) is unusual as a praenomen, and nomina in E(..) are rare, but the cognomen Aemilianus is frequent, and Aemilius also occurs (for example RIB 11.7, 2501.35). The cohort's contemporary dedication-slab (RIB 1060, A.D. 222) does not describe it as eq(uitata) (part-mounted), and the only other officer named by a sealing (RIB II.1, 2411.100) is a centurion. So these five sealings with AEM I D reverse, by attesting a decurion (troop-commander), are the first epigraphic evidence that cohors V Gallorum, like cohortes II Gallorum and IIII Gallorum also in Britain, was equitata. 363</page><page sequence="124">ROMAN BRITAIN IN 2006 32.
