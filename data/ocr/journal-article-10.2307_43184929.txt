One of the ongoing challenges for textile researchers is to go beyond technological and typological analysis and use textiles to address questions of interest to the larger anthropological and archaeological community. Teague and Washburn try to do this by using woven sandals and other textiles to reexamine Uto-Aztecan migrations. Teague and Washburn deal with the problem of accounting for the sudden appearance of highly styl- ized Basketmaker III sandals by showing that the new sandals were not derived from Archaic antecedents. Instead, these sandals seem to appear on the Colorado Plateau at the same time as masonry pueblos and sedentary maize agriculture. On the Colorado Plateau, undecorated open-twined sandals appear in the early Archaic, about 10,000 years ago. By 3,500 years ago, these evolved into undeco- rated warp-faced plaited sandals. Then, as maize agri- culture appears on the Colorado Plateau in Basketmaker II times, weft-faced sandals replace warp- faced sandals. Teague and Washburn convincingly show the new sandals were not derived from Archaic antecedents. Over time, Basketmaker II sandals evolve from simple undecorated types to complex types with color and structural designs. The Basketmaker II sandal tradition continues in Basketmaker III times and reaches a fluorescence before collapsing in Puebloan times. At its peak, around A.D. 450, people produced very finely woven sandals with intricate multicolored and structural designs. After their excellent structural analysis, Teague and Washburn try to relate use patterns in geometric and color symmetries on Basketmaker and Puebloan sandals to Mesoamerican cosmologies and color symbolism. In Basketmaker II times, simple Black-on-Red edge deco- rated sandals were being made in the Colorado River</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 579 drainage. By Basketmaker in times, weavers were mak- ing elaborate designs and decorated sandals appear in other parts of the region. They had also developed a new coloring technique with color bands superimposed on underlying symmetrical designs. In looking for color metaphors, the authors begin with the argument that there is no evidence of superim- posed color banding on textiles found in California, the Great Basin, Columbia Plateau, or Northwest Coast. Instead, the closest color banding comes from Cueva de San Pablo near Durango, Mexico. One problem here is that the Durango sandals have anthropomorphic and not geometric designs. This notwithstanding, Teague and Washburn trace Durango designs, but not color banding, moving north from central Mexico to Durango. They also argue for post-A.D. 900 migrations farther north into the Southwest. Presumably, these migrants intro- duced color banding to the Colorado Plateau. When discussing cosmological significance in san- dal design, Teague and Washburn's analysis becomes less convincing. They start by noting that the archaeo- logical and ethnographic records for the Southwest do not offer any indications of the personal and social con- texts for sandal use. Nonetheless, they argue that color and pattern were metaphors for cosmological ideas from Mesoamerica. After discussing Mesoamerican cosmology and ritual, the authors seem to simply assert that color banding and geometric patterning are con- nected to ritual activities associated with the solstices, mainly because sandals are sometimes found in caves with other ritual objects. The authors, contrary to their earlier characterization of the ethnographic record, asso- ciate sandals with Pueblo spiritual leaders depositing ritual materials in caves during solstice pilgrimages. Finally, Teague and Washburn suggest a reconstruc- tion of Uto-Aztecan as coming from a Proto-Uto- Aztecan homeland in the northern Mojave Desert about 5,000 years ago. They see the maize agriculturalists moving into the region around 4,500 years ago with a blended culture derived from the Great Basin textiles melded with textiles from northern Mexico. While their sandal data do support the northern Mexico origin, their use of textile data from the Great Basin, based in part on outdated sources, is less convincing. Their asso- ciation of early burial bags from Spirit Cave in the Great Basin with more recent Southwestern burial bags is very weak. Based on the dates presented, the appar- ent shift from Z-slant twining to S-slant twining is not obviously correlated with either the appearance of maize agriculture in the Southwest or Uto-Aztecan lan- guages in the Great Basin. Given the heavy emphasis on Great Basin archaeology and ethnography to make the case for cultural blending, the book would have benefited from more up-to-date primary Great Basin references. Overall, the book is a good description of the pre- history Colorado Plateau Basketmaker and Pueblo san- dals. It would have benefited from more illustrations, especially of Archaic sandals and Mesoamerican tex- tiles. The extensive data appendices are valuable for anyone working with prehistoric sandals. Unfortunately, Teague and Washburn's attempt to asso- ciate Basketmaker and Puebloan sandals with Mesoamerican color symmetries and solstice cosmol- ogy needs much more data to become convincing.</page></plain_text>
