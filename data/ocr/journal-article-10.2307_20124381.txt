<plain_text><page sequence="1">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS * AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY Vol. IV, No. 1: January, 1967 Time, Truth, and Knowledge in Ancient Greek Philosophy, JAAKKO HINTIKKA The statements (general statements partly excepted) in terms of which Greek philosophers thought of knowledge and opinion as being expressed referred explicitly or implicitly to the moment at which they are made (the "now"). The same was true of the opinions or thoughts these statements express. Combined with the idea of knowledge as comparable with acquaintance or perception, this conceptual habit encouraged the view that there is genuine knowledge only of what is unchangeable. (Only in the case of an immutable object does "I have seen it to be so" carry certainty con cerning its state now.) This conceptual habit is related to several features of the Greek culture and philosophy: the theory of changing truth-values (Categories 5) ; the idea of spoken language as expressing "affections in the soul" (De Int. 1); the idea of thinking as an internal dialogue (Theaetetus) ; the predominance of spoken language over the written one; etc. Inferential Constructions, ROBERT J. FOGELIN The paper isolates and examines in detail a class of constructions that are labelled inferential constructions. Such constructions have two dis tinguishing features: they each contain a dialectical move from one proposi tion to another, and simultaneously they assign a specific epistemic status to the component propositions. Indicative conditionals, subjunctive condi tionals, and arguments are all members of this family of constructions. In the first half of the essay the notion of an inferential construction is intro duced through generalizing Ryle's conception of an inference ticket. A systematic enumeration of the kinds of inferential constructions is given and the logical relationships that obtain amongst them is spelled out in detail. In the second half of the essay these general results are applied to a series of specific problems. One important result is that problems about contrary to fact conditionals lose their special character since they emerge as instances of problems that infect all inferential constructions. With these problems generalized, some tentative suggestions are made for their solution. * Abstracts of articles from leading philosophical journals are published as a regular feature of The Review.

Various departures from these conditions are examined; it is shown that the departures would require agents con sistently applying the principle of utility to abandon act-utilitarianism in favor of some concession to rule-utilitarianism. Moral untrustworthiness on the part of agents might have the same result; but the result does not depend on agents being untrustworthy; it holds for a community all of whose members may be assumed to be sincere and determined utilitarians. Which version of utilitarianism a community of utilitarians would choose varies with the social circumstances in which they find themselves. Performatives, HERBERT FINGARETTE In How To Do Things With Words Austin mentioned certain crucial and intuitively obvious features of the performative, but he failed to appre ciate them adequately, and for this reason the initially distinctive notion seemed to dissolve under his analysis. No one else has managed to capture these intuitively central features in a definition. These features of the performative are then taken up here again, and their characterization is deepened and refined, the concept finally being defined. It is then possible to show that the notion is indeed a distinctive one, to show specifically why it is peculiarly suited for counting as the performance of acts in which a person directly and explicitly ("formally") alters his responsibility with respect to other persons. The analysis and definition are used to account for comments made by other writers on this topic, and to resolve difficulties which have been found with the concept. The Philosophical Imagination, ARTHUR W. COLLINS This paper examines arguments of the form: The contrary of P is imaginable, therefore P is contingent, or not analytic. Such arguments involve a special philosopher's sense of "imaginable" to which picturability and comparative powers of imagination are irrelevant. "Imaginable" cannot be explained in terms of consistency since imaginability is employed to establish consistency on the pattern of model proofs. But, the model being only imagined, so is the consistency. Appeals to imagination presume to analyze concepts by showing their application to the "possible" situations that are imagined. But what is to count as a possible situation depends on how we analyze the concepts that will be used to describe them. Fantastic possibilities have no philosophical implications without the unacceptable premiss that concepts in use already contain all the modifications to which they would be susceptible were anomolous realities to arise. Logical Connection, JON WHEATLY In this paper I am concerned with logical connections which lie in language (nothing to do with formal calculi). If p entails q then, if p is</page><page sequence="3">562 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS true, q must be true. In addition, q is true because p is true; this is what makes entailment different from strict implication. I offer a definition of entailment which catches this fact. There are other logical connections within language, weaker than entailment but similar to it. I define one such relationship, which I call the trident relation. It is defined in the same terms as entailment but the conditions are looser, establishing that it is of a type with entailment though weaker than entailment. The machinery for defining entailment and the trident relation is complex so I do not give it here. However, here is an example of the trident relation: "A says 'I promise to X' trides A intends to X." The trident relation holds exclusively between open sentences. Is Choice Determined by the "Strongest Motive"?, REM B. EDWARDS Determinists have traditionally argued that every choice is determined by the strongest motive, claiming that there is a close analogy between strongest motives in psychology and strongest forces in physics. The analogy breaks down, since strongest motives are not measured in the same way strongest forces are, since there is no parallelogram of forces in psychology as there is in physics, and since choosing would be superfluous if the analogy with physics were exact. The latter point is true even if choice is determined by the strongest set of motives rather than the strongest single motive. Actions but not choices are determined by the strongest motive when there exists a strongest motive. Choices seldom occur, but when they do it is when motives conflict and no one is stronger than another. Choosing makes one of the conflicting motives predominate. This position is contrasted with those of Sir David Ross and C. A. Campbell. The Semantics of Imperatives, ERNEST SOSA We say that the members of a set of indicatives logically imply a further indicative provided that the members of the set cannot all be true while the further indicative is false. Clearly, this will not do for impera tives, since no imperative can even be true or false. The main problem of the present paper is: What will do for imperatives? After surveying the various proposals in the literature, the author argues for a three-valued logic of imperatives, to be built on a logic of indicatives. His paradigm for imperatives is the conditional imperative, of the form "On condition p, do A!" (inasmuch as categorical imperatives can be assigned an empty condition, p v ? p). Such an imperative is satisfied iff both p is true and the addressee does do A, violated iff both p is true and the addressee does not do A, and neutral iff p is not true. On this basis, a criterion of entailment for imperatives is then formulated. Natural Rights, WILLIAM J. WAINWRIGHT The first part of the paper consists of an attempt to elucidate the notion of a natural right. Particular attention is paid to the idea that a natural right is universal. In the second part of the paper Locke's doctrine of natural rights is examined in the light of the characterization of the</page><page sequence="4">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 563 notion of natural rights which has been offered in the first part. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of the relation between the concept of natural rights and that of a state of nature. Moral Rules and the Generalization Argument, ALEXANDER SESONSKE* M. Singer has claimed that the generalization argument, i.e., if every one did that the consequences would be disastrous, therefore no one ought to do that, is a fundamental moral principle, presupposed in all moral reasoning. This claim rests ultimately on the contention that all moral rules are established by the generalization argument. But an examination of the contexts in which Singer argues that moral rules presuppose GA fails to sustain this contention. For all three classes of moral rules, i.e., neutral norms, local rules and fundamental moral rules, a close examination of his arguments shows that Singer has not produced a single case of a moral rule being established by G A, whereas it can be shown that some rules of each kind can be established without reference to GA. If we consider a weaker claim, not that moral rules are derived from GA, but that GA provides our reason for obeying them, the case is no better. It cannot with plausibility be claimed that GA alone provides a sufficient reason for obeying moral rules. I conclude that GA is not a fundamental moral principle, but a minor argument form, useful only in certain circumstances. Even there it only obscurely indicates our real grounds for obedience to a moral rule. INTERNATIONAL PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY Vol. VI, No. 4: December, 1966 The Polar Context of Freedom, CHARLES K. ROBINSON Against the background of a polar or complementary understanding of individuality and relationality and of structure and power, the author views thoroughgoing determinism and thoroughgoing indeterminism as opposite extremes, each of which distorts the appropriate balance of com plementarity : determinism by overemphasizing structure and indeterminism by overemphasizing power. It is then suggested that freedom may be appropriately understood as constituting the distinctly personal level of spontaneity?the self-determining side of power?in intimate contextual unity with other aspects of complementarity. Concluding observations are offered regarding the prospects and dilemmas of freedom as seen in Indian, Greek, Hebraic, Christian, and technological perspectives. The Neural Identity Theory and the Person, ERROL E. HARRIS Dualistic theories of body-mind relation persist, in the main because mental and physical events seem to have incompatible characteristics: * This article appeared in Vol. Ill, No. 4 (October, 1966).</page><page sequence="5">564 PH ILOSOPHI CAL ABSTRACTS "appearances" can be attributed neither to the physical object nor the physiological process and consciousness seems in various inescapable ways transcendent beyond the spatio-temporal limitations of bodily functions. Nevertheless dualism presents difficulties of its own, occasioning a new state ment of materialistic monism in the neural-identity theory. This identifies "strictly" phenomenological and neural aspects of mental occurrences. But the precise meaning of "strict identification" is elusive because none of the analogies given are exact, and there is impressive scientific evidence of quantitative and qualitative discrepancies between experiences and their neural concomitants. The attempt to dispose of secondary qualities in terms of behavior is question-begging because discriminatory reactions cannot be adequately described without presuming the experience of the qualities discriminated. An alternative theory is possible, identifying consciousness as the form of high-grade integrative activity of physiological functioning at a crucial pitch of organic development, and in elaborating this notion we can meet the objections and requirements of both monism and dualism. Pedro da Fonseca: Sixteenth Century Portugese Philosopher, JOAQUIM FERREIRA GOMES This is an account of the philosophical works and influence of the sixteenth century Jesuit professor at the University of Coimbra, who was called "the Portuguese Aristotle" and is the Portuguese philosopher who has had the widest influence outside his own country. His translations of Aristotle are extraordinarily clear and elegant and his commentaries often complete Aristotle's own unanswered questions in terms of the spirit or letter of his doctrine elsewhere; his establishment of the text of the Meta physics is also a work of admirable scholarship in the best Renaissance tradition. His works had an immense diffusion, decisively influencing all the Scholastic manuals of his day, and preparing the way for the Disputa tiones Metaphysicae of Suarez. The Formalization of Hegel's Dialectical Logic, MICHAEL KOSOK Hegelian dialectic is explicated from a formal, logical and intuitive perspective, illustrating how a self-generating principle of reflection called the Law of Non-Identity symbolizes dialectic logic into an infinite-leveled matrix structure. A non-contradictory concept of "synthesis" is formulated in terms of "negative-presence" and "self-negation." Being asymmetric and "temporal" in nature, the logic develops elements that are neither deter mined nor not-determined, but in a process of being-determined. Dialectic, temporalized, automatically takes the form of a subject-object phenomenology, which in turn becomes its content. From this perspective, Hegel's Phenome nology and Encyclopedia can be regarded as a structural totality, laying the foundation for category-transitions between and within these works. The relationship between dialectic and ordinary logic is studied, showing how dialectic logic generalizes the Goedelian condition of consistency vs. complete ness, subordinating the entire problem to the question of Identity : a principle of non-identity transcends this and other similar oppositions.</page><page sequence="6">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 565 The Problem of Universals: Its Scope and Meaning, JOSEF M?LLER Dialogue with Buddhism: Ways of Knowing, JOHN K. KADOWSKI, s.j. The difficulty for the Western mind to understand Buddhism may be in large part due to the lack of a common view point by which we can bridge the difference between us. The author finds such a bridge by means of a dialogue. There is a similarity between a fundamental Buddhist doc trine called the threefold learning and the connatural knowledge described by Thomas Aquinas. This likeness or analogy consists mainly in being a kind of intuitive knowing, gained not by the intellect alone but through moral virtues. In this cognitive process the driving force, fostered in the will, becomes an internal dynamic principle of intuitive knowledge. THE JOURNAL OF THE HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY Vol. V, No. 1: January, 1967 Socrates' Concept of Piety,^ DANIEL E. ANDERSON This article, based on a study of the Euthyphro, Apology and Crito, suggests that for Socrates (and therefore, presumably, the young Plato) piety is service to the dialectic, and that for Socrates the dialectic itself takes over the position reserved in the popular religion for the gods (thus making Socrates guilty, at least metaphorically, of the charge of believing in "other new divine powers"). Part one seeks to establish that the dialectic controls the pious man's beliefs; part two, that it controls his destiny; and part three, that it controls his identity. Failure to engage in, or dis obedience to the dialectic "leads to the worst forms of immorality, and brings down judgments that reduce the gods to low comedy, men to tra gedy." It is further argued that because Socrates held the dialectic to be fundamental, he also held that the only just form of government is democracy. Giulio Castellani (1528-1586): A Sixteenth-Century Opponent of Scepticism, CHARLES B. SCHMITT The influence of ancient scepticism on the philosophical thought of Renaissance Italy has perhaps been underestimated. Not only is there evidence of some interest in the writings of Sextus Empiricus, but evidence also that the sceptical tendency was widespread enough to provoke a reply from the dogmatists. Giulio Castellani of Faenza, in his Adversus M. T. Ci ceronis acad?micas questiones disputatio (1558), attempted to refute the sceptical posture of Cicero's Acad?mica by arguments drawn from Aristotle. In rejecting the sceptical doubts concerning the reliability of sense knowl edge Castellani utilized certain arguments based on observation and experi ence which in some ways point in the direction of seventeenth century empiricism.</page><page sequence="7">566 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS Normative Science and the Pragmatic Maxim, VINCENT G. POTTER, s.j. C. S. Peirce's understanding of the pragmatic maxim is basically con sistent throughout. The differences between the 1878 version and the later ones is best looked upon as a development and clarification of his thought rather than a contradiction. Peirce could develop and clarify his thought because he came to see the nature and role of the normative sciences in the philosophical analysis of the relation between thought and action. Around 1902-1903 Peirce made a special effort to disassociate himself from certain forms of pragmatism popular at the time. James, he thought, had turned it into the "stoical maxim" that man's end is action. But action cannot be the final logical interpr?tant of thought because it is not general. Conduct or action subject to the control of thought (the growth of concrete reason ableness) is man's end, and indeed, the summum bonum. The develop ment of habits of action, then, is the end of thought, and this account incorporates the insight that rational purport always implies a relation to some definite human purpose. Rational purport is expressed in future con ditionals ("would-be's") irreducible to any set of actual occurrences. The Port-Royal Logic in the Twentieth Century, RICHARD A. WATSON A discussion and review of three recent editions of Arnauld and Nicole's Logic, a work which influenced the course of modern philosophy from its first publication in 1662 through the end of the nineteenth century. Their (great) debt to Descartes is delineated, and the (minor) contemporary significance of the Logic is evaluated. The photo-reproduction of the 1963 edition published by Ren? Giard (Paris: 1964) with an introduction by P. Roubinet, and the critical edition edited by Pierre Clair and Fran?ois Girbal published by the Presses Universitaires de France (Paris, 1965) are welcomed. The American translation by James Dickoff and Patricia James published by Bobbs Merrill (Indianapolis: 1964) is criticized in detail and is not recommended. Josiah Royce's Urbana Lectures: Lecture 1, PETER FUSS This heretofore unpublished lecture (1907), making the first phase of the later Royce 's multidimensional ethical theory, explores the experiential situation in which we find ourserves when we predicate values and encounter value-conflicts prior to the existence of a well-defined and generally accepted moral code. Royce attempts to show that in the face of interpersonal value conflicts, prudential considerations suffice to urge upon individuals having a modicum of enlightened self-interest the need to regulate their quest for personal gratification by adopting certain procedural principles of conduct. Consistent adherence to these principles?Royce distinguishes four: reason ableness, impartiality, respect for persons, harmonization of conflict?tends to lessen conflict and thereby further in the long run the interests of all parties concerned. It is not the purpose of these principles to appraise value claims directly. Rather, their role is to define feasible procedures for human intercourse in the very face of irreducibly opposed value claims.</page><page sequence="8">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 567 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY Vol. LXIII, No. 19: October 13, 1966 Kant's Objection to the Ontological Argument, ALVIN PLANTINGA This article considers and develops several interpretations of Kant's dictum, "Existence is not a predicate." It concludes that in none of these interpretations is that dictum both true and relevant to Anselm's argument. Transcendental Tendencies in Recent Philosophy, STEPHAN K?RNER The Problem of Other Periods, ARTHUR DANTO Vol. LXIII, No. 20: October 27, 1966 Questions, SYLVAIN BROMBERGER Plausibility and Justification in the Development of Science, DUDLEY SHAPERE Through examination of two cases in the history of science?Liebig's introduction of the notion of "vital force" in physiology, and Huygens' intro duction of the concept of a "wave" in the theory of light?it is shown that there are sometimes good reasons, in the development of science, for intro ducing and investigating certain new ideas (even some commonly rejected by philosophers as, e.g., "meaningless" or "metaphysical"), even if those ideas do not ultimately "work out"; and furthermore, that those good reasons are in fact comparable, in some cases at least, to sorts of good reasons appealed to in introducing ideas that do "work out" (scientifically). Consequences of this analysis for the attempt to draw a line of demarcation between science and non-science (or nonsense) are discussed. Analyticity and Conceptual Revision, MILTON FISK What rules are such that propositions can be true in virtue of them? Not grammatical rules, not rules of polite speech, and not liturgical rules of use. Rules which generate truth are distinguished by their purpose, which is to limit the sources of disconfirmation of all propositions through the sanction of linguistic impropriety. Such rules can be said to generate truth since by claiming that a proposition violating them is true one places oneself in opposition to the purpose of the rule. This would not be the case if the rules were of a different kind. Intention and Purpose, ANTHONY KENNY Like Bentham, lawyers say that a man intends those consequences of his actions which he foresees. This is not the natural concept of intention, which regards desire as well as knowledge as relevant.

QUINE In 1903 Russell held that every word referred to a thing or a concept. Only things existed; still, concepts had being. In 1905 he invoked con textual definition to make do with a narrower realm of being. In 1908 he used contextual definition to "reduce" classes to "propositional functions" or attributes. Perhaps he did this because of feeling that classes, if there were any, would claim existence, while attributes claim only being. Another factor was confusion of attributes with open sentences. By 1914 he stopped distinguishing between existents and other beings. Attributes and relations now exist. Propositions, as other than sentences, are repudiated by 1918, but facts are accepted, which could as well be called true propositions. In 1914 he slated bodies themselves for reduction, to sense data. The plan he sketched was improved and partly executed by Carnap in 1928, but is hope less. Subsequently Russell has tended more toward naturalism. Substitutivity and Descriptions, LEONARD LINSKY The Concept of Morality, WILLIAM K. FRANKENA Vol. LXIII, No. 22: November 24, 1966 Randall's Career of Philosophy: Three Reviews RICHARD H. POPKIN EDWARD ROSEN The first two of J. H. Randall's projected three volumes on The Career of Philosophy are examined from the point of view of the historian of science. The triumphant emergence of science and technology differentiates modern Western civilization from all others. Has this new power served worthy or unworthy ends? Some investigators of nature have sought only to enjoy the spectacle of what they discovered; others have insisted on deriving material benefits from their researches. Both groups have poured forth an unending flood of new ideas and speculations, which have fruc tified the traditional fields of philosophy proper. These have produced an abundant harvest, which in turn has enriched the surging stream. The</page><page sequence="10">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 569 resulting interaction has made a substantial contribution to the flowering of modern thought from Copernicus to Darwin. FREDERICK C. COPLESTON, s.j. Professor Randall has the gift of making the history of philosophy live. He tries to exhibit the philosophers with whom he deals as concerned with real problems. For example, Kant is presented as primarily concerned, in the first Critique, with a logical analysis of the postulates of Newtonian science, while in the case of the German idealists emphasis is laid on their several visions of reality and on the way in which they met the needs of the time as expressed in the ferment of the romantic movement. Their claims to be presenting literal truth are played down; but the author's treatment is penetrating and sympathetic. Marx and J. S. Mill are both shown as transforming the philosophies with which they started. In general, emphasis is laid on insights and on response to extra-philosophical situations. Vol. LXIII, No. 23: December 8, 1966 Blanshard's Reduction of Marxism, IVAN BABIC The author asserts that "economic determinism" to which Blanshard reduces Marxism is only one of its constitutive elements. It implies that philosophy, religion, art, morals etc. should be connected with the totality of a historical context and does not necessarily mean that metaphysics is absolutely determined by economic and political factors. Marxism as a Western philosophy aimed at the revolutionary transformation of the world charts the fundamental ways of human action, the ways of overcoming man's alienation in a new human association. Being a complex theory of the Socialist revolution, Marxism is a self-correcting idea, open to new vistas. Specifically in the realm of metaphysics it has been concerned with the critique of the traditional metaphysics as well as the creation of varieties of metaphysics of its own. The discussion of Marxism today presupposes the recognition of all the complex elements and features of the contemporary Marxism. Psychoanalytic Dispositions Terms and Reduction Sentences, JAMES A. GRIMIGLIANO-GREGOR Vol. LXIII, No. 24: December 22, 1966 Wants and Justifications, AMELIE RORTY Statements of wants and desires do not merely function as explana tions of actions, but they may also be used to justify them or to defy an</page><page sequence="11">570 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS authority demanding justifications. The use of such expressions as "Be cause I want to?" (BIWT) depends on the relationship between the ques tioner and an agent, and their beliefs about whether the action in question is bizarre or morally outrageous. When BIWT is used as a justification, it may be used to place a factor already having an assigned priority rating into consideration in justifying a particular action, or, if the questioner and the agent do not agree about the priority ratings of various considerations, BIWT may be used by an agent to place his wants on the scale of considera tions. To argue that BIWT cannot be used to justify actions in moral contexts, is not only to maintain a thesis in analytic ethics, but also to advocate a particular kind of morality. For to claim that an expression is, in certain moral contexts, misused, is implicitly to urge its disuse. The Singular Case of the Null Individual in the Empty Domain, J. W. SWANSON The author examines a recent proposal by R. M. Martin to assimilate the logic of quantification in the empty domain to general quantification theory by means of supplementing all domains with a so-called "null indi vidual." On Martin's proposal, the null individual is not actually in the empty domain but merely a fictitious component in some sense. One of the welcome consequences of this strategy?so Martin claims?is to preserve truth of sentences of the form '(Ex) (Fx v~Fx)' in all domains. In reality, however, Martin's suggestion amounts ultimately to the old-fashioned proposal that all domains dealt with in quantification theory be regarded as non-empty. The so-called "null individual" turns out to be a full-fledged, if somewhat eccentric, member of any domain with which it is associated; and the proposal to regard any domain as containing at least the null indi vidual turns out to be a picturesque way of stipulating non-emptiness for all domains. On Null Individuals, MARIO BUNGE Reasons are given for keeping and even multiplying Martin's null individual. Many scientific theories are many-sorted, in the sense that they concern n-tuples of individuals one of which is occasionally absent. Several examples are shown, which suggest that for the sake of the uniformity of treatment as many null individuals as reference sets are needed. Also, a new characterization of the concept of null individual is offered: The null individual of a given kind is that object which, physically added to an arbitrary individual of the same kind, yields the latter. The concept is used in the author's version of mereology. Emeroses by Other Names, DONALD DAVIDSON In Fact, Fiction and Forecast, Nelson Goodman suggests that entrench ment of its predicates, taken singly, determines whether a statement is lawlike, i.e., whether it is confirmed by its instances. Using this criterion, the hypothesis (H?) "All emeroses are gred" is not lawlike. (Hx says that everything that is examined before t and is an emerald [or else is a rose]</page><page sequence="12">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 571 is green if examined before t [or else is red].) Recently (in "Comments," Journal of Philosophy, 63, II [May 26, 1966]: 328-331) Goodman has defended his view by arguing that H? is not lawlike; in the present note this claim is challenged. Looming behind the immediate issue is the question whether lawlikeness, and confirmation relations generally, can be considered out of relation to surrounding theory. Lawlikeness = Truth?, JOHN WALLACE MIND Vol. LXXVI, No. 301: January, 1967 On Rational Philosophy of Language: The Programme in Plato's Cratylus, KUNO LORENZ and J?RGEN MITTELSTRASSE Plato's Cratylus?its core being a theory of predication?is reinter preted as lying beyond the realism-nominalism dispute on the nature of language. It rather presents an independent attempt at a rational philosophy of language. That is, neither a description of linguistic behavior nor an arbitrary proposal for language use is intended, but the obligation for justification of one's own use of language is accepted. This is done through a rational reconstruction of language, parts of which, namely predication (especially the use of color predicates) and the introduction of concepts, are presented and discussed as examples. Besides, a connection with Plato's own frame of reference is established and evaluated (e.g., "ousia" corres ponds to "facts," "eidos" to "concept"). Ordinary Language, Common Sense, and the Time-lag Argument, R. G. HENSON This article deals with Russell's enthymematic argument whose con clusion is that what we see must be in, or part of, the percipient's brain. One premiss is that light has a finite velocity. I offer a full (and apparently formally valid) statement of the argument and argue that Russell relies uncritically on a misinterpretation of the notion that we see things happen when they happen, implicitly construing this as a linguistic rule. It can plausibly be taken as a linguistic rule, if it is interpreted as "we see things happen on the occasion of their happening." So interpreted, it does not support Russell's conclusion; taken as an empirical claim about strict simultaneity, it is false; omitted from the argument altogether, it leaves no argument. I also explain, dogmatize, and sermonize on "ordinary language" in philosophy, and on the difference between appealing to it and appealing to "common sense." Aristotle's Logic of Statements about Contingency, A. P. BROGAN Aristotle's doctrines about "contingency" (as later writers say) or "possibility as defined" (what is neither necessary nor impossible, as</page><page sequence="13">572 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS Aristotle said) are analyzed and criticized. Contrary to much recent scholarship, it is shown that Aristotle correctly realized that "p is con tingent" is equivalent to "not-p is contingent." But he mistakenly trusted intuition rather than analysis, so that he argued that the statement "It is contingent that all A is B" is equivalent to "It is contingent that no A is B." Then by correct logic from his assumptions, he argued that "It is con tingent that no A is B" does not imply "It is contingent that no B is A." This conclusion is absurd. His mistake about contingent A and E state ments led him to fallacies in many of his syllogisms about contingent statements. With the corrections indicated, his logic of contingency becomes a consistent system. Action and Causal Explanation, GEOFFREY MADELL Recent attempts (by Hamlyn, Peters, Strawson, etc.) to show that causal explanation is not applicable to action are misguided. It has been argued that causal explanation of action would require (a) that action concepts be correlated with precise patterns of movement, and (b) that statements about action be deducible from purely factual premisses. Both conditions have been taken to be impossible of fulfillment, the latter because description of human behaviour is inescapably normative. But (a) the impossibility of such correlation is simply a function of a concept's general ity, whether action-concept or mere event-concept, and (b) behavior concepts are not normative in any special sense. Examination of the argu ments for (b) reveals a many-sided confusion on the nature of norms and criteria, the requirements of causal explanation, and the use of scientific models. There is no feature of behavior-concepts which protects human behavior from causal explanation. Utilitarianism and New Generations, JAN NARVESON It is alleged that on the utilitarian view, anyone in a position to have children has a duty to have as many as it could be foreseen would be happy at all, the premiss being that we are to do whatever would increase the amount of happiness in the world. No such thing follows, however. For prior to the birth of such a child, there is no one on whom the "inac tion" of not having it will produce any undesirable effects (other people apart); and so long as no child is forthcoming, this will continue to be the case. On the other hand it does follow from the Principle of Utility that one has a duty not to conceive children if it can be foreseen that they will be miserable. For here, the population in the contemplated situation (i.e., of having the child) is larger by one (the child) than the alternative situation of non-conception. Apart from this, the conclusion must be that the decision whether to have a child or not is ordinarily to be made on non-moral grounds. Which Word Wears the Trousers?, S. COVAL and T. FORREST</page><page sequence="14">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 573 Memory and Imagination, J. 0. URMSON This article discusses the problem, raised by Hume, of how the author of a narration knows whether it is an exercise of memory or of imagination. A distinction is drawn between the oppositions (a) of recollection, good or bad, to free invention and (b) of accurate recollection to imagination as a form of inaccurate recollection. It is contented that in case (a) what the author is doing depends on his intention, on whether his performance is such that a criterion of its success is or is not fidelity to fact, which he can determine. The author knows whether he is exercising memory or imagination as we always know what we are doing. In case (b) the author cannot have this authoritative knowledge, though he may have good reason to claim accuracy or acknowledge the possibility of error in the light of circumstance. Hume's failure to deal with the problem is shown to result from the conflation of (a) and (b). It is True, JAN SRZEDNICKI * "Assertion X is true" is logically a commentary. Any grounds one may offer for X are, in proper circumstances, grounds for: "X asserts a fact" or "X is true." Such grounds are relevant in both cases, but they are basically grounds for X and only become grounds for agreeing with X by extension. An assertion of fact is directly supported by reference to them. An assertion of truth is supported indirectly. It is impossible for "X is true" to be true, and for "X" to be false simultaneously. Thus the same kind of reason is seen to be operative in two ways, and on two distinct, but intimately connected levels. To say "X is true" is quite different from saying "Y is a fact." Only assertions can be substituted for X, but no such limitation applies to Y. We tend to think that "Assertion X asserts a fact," simply re-asserts X. This is caused by the observation that the very same grounds must be given in support of either of them. And yet the uneasiness is spurious when we see that we say "X" and "Assertion X asserts a fact" on similar grounds, but in different circumstances, and for a different imme diate purpose. THE MONIST Vol. 50, No. 4: October, 1966: SYMBOL AND MYTH From Myth to Metaphor, DOUGLAS BERGGREN The author argues that the meaning of both religion and theoretical physics is either mythically ambiguous, literally non-sensical or absurd, or metaphorically tensional in character. Such meaning remains mythically ambiguous so long as either the sacred phenomena of religion or the quan * This article appeared in Vol. LXXV, No. 299 (July, 1966).</page><page sequence="15">574 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS titative entities of physics are not clearly distinguished from ordinary qualitative objects of perception. When these distinctions are reflectively drawn, however, religious meaning tends to collapse into either mystical ineffability or miraculous absurdity. And the meaning of theoretical physics tends likewise to be transformed into either the nonsensical import of pure mathematics, or the apparent absurdity of coordinatively identifying two supposedly unrelated universes of discourse. According to the author, how ever, these two dilemmas can be resolved if both sacred and scientific entities are neither identified with nor separated from the observable world, but are functionally related to it as ideal limits to actual approximations. Both religious perfection and scientific necessity, that is to say, are regarded by the author as constantly in the making, or as having an ontologically tensional status which can be cognitively expressed only by means of recognized metaphorical usage. Is Myth Indispensible?, FRANK B. DILLEY If by "myth" is meant the portrayal of the divine being and activity in human and historical terms, describing God in anthropomorphic lan guage, as a personal being with vastly superior powers, actively involved in space and time, then the answer to the question "Is myth indispensable?" is "It all depends upon what God is." Naturalists deny cognitive status to myth because they deny that there is any God, while the mystic believes that there is a God but holds that myth is utterly inadequate descriptively. Traditional theists accept a cognitive status for myth but require analogical translation before the truth of myth can be known. Personalistic theists answer an unequivocal "yes" to the question. Some difficulties in the metaphysical views underlying the mystical and analogical interpretations are explored briefly. Metafolklore and Oral Literary Criticism, ALAN DUNDES The faulty theoretical assumption that folklore reflected only the past rather than the present and past led to the collection of folklore texts with out contexts. However, clearly both the present uses and meanings of folklore items must be collected. If there is oral literature, there is also oral literary criticism, that is, traditional interpretations of folklore held and transmitted by the folk. One source of oral literary criticism is meta folklore, or folkloristic forms which comment on folkloristic forms, e.g., a proverb about proverbs, a joke about a joke cycle, etc. The collection and analysis of metafolklore plus multiple folk interpretations of a single folktale or song may provide new dimensions to our understanding of folklore, especially in such treacherous areas as symbolism. Moreover, the hundreds of contextless texts collected in the past without glosses and exe geses by either raconteurs or audiences may now perhaps be taken back into the field to be used as points of departure for the elicitation of oral literary criticism. In this way, the meaning of folklore to the folk may be empiri cally investigated rather than guessed at by armchair analysts.</page><page sequence="16">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 575 Myth and Metaphysics in Indian Thought, JAMES M. FREEMAN Both mythical and metaphysical perspectives characteristically deal with oppositions such as order-disorder, one-many, appearance-reality. In the mythical account, oppositions are handled as contraries which can be mediated in a variety of ways. In the metaphysical account, oppositions are handled as irresolvable contradictions which cannot be mediated. This shift in the treatment of oppositions draws attention away from attempts to represent reality, which is characteristic of mythical thought, and instead begins to focus on logical distinctions and philosophical problems in the representation of reality. Once mythical oppositions are viewed as con tradictions, the mythical perspective invites criticisms on logical grounds. But the same criticism in turn can be levelled at subsequent metaphysical developments in Indian thought. The Bhagavad-Gita and other writings attempt to resolve problems which arise from the awareness of contradic tions?but these attempts are unsuccessful. Symbolism and Myth, RICHARD A. KOEHL Myths are linguistic expressions of shared delusions. Shared delusions are distinguished from shared fantasies, illusory perceptions, and idio syncratic delusions. Consensus prompts us to interpretively integrate experi ence in terms of our hopes, fears, and wishes in such a way that we sanction policies and actions we could not otherwise individually in good conscience without embarrassment approve. Five counter-arguments which suggest that shared delusion is precluded by the public nature of shared belief and shared language are considered and shown to be inconclusive against the thesis here offered: (i) the Stoic appeal to the consensus gentium, (ii) the view that language is shaped through time by Nature in concommitance with social evolution, (ii) the view that consensus provides the measure against which we judge the aberrant, (iv) an argument based upon Aris totle's defense of the law of non-contradiction in Metaphysics, book Gamma, and (v) the appeal to "paradigm cases." What Daedalus Told Ariadne, Or, How to Escape the Labyrinth, PAUL G. KUNTZ The story of Theseus, so popular today in literature, is retold to emphasize not the putative origin in ritual but the present philosophic importance. The meaning is that man confronts the world as a maze: he is bewildered by the intricacy and does not know at first how to find his way. Yet reason can guide him to understand any pattern, even the fearful Labyrinth. The ancient symbol from Cnossus appears at first that of an impenetrable maze, yet as a matter of fact there is no great problem of threading one's way to the center and reversing the procedure to escape. With this interpretation of chaos as order not yet understood, the story is retold and affirmed as true to the human situation. Among the common guiding myths proposed for acceptance, the author chooses to regard man's place in the world as Thesean rather than Promethean, Oedipean, Ulyssean or Sisyphean.</page><page sequence="17">576 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS Tillich's Theory of Signs and Symbols, WILLIAM L. ROWE Tillich holds that symbols, like signs, point beyond themselves; but, unlike signs, they participate in the reality of that to which they point. After noting that "pointing to" may be interpreted either as referring or as signifying, I argue that since Tillich holds that what a linguistic sign points to is its meaning the only plausible interpretation of "pointing to" is signifying. Concerning "participation" I argue (i) that there is no plausible interpretation of "participation" in terms of which we can distinguish between the entities Tillich calls "signs" and those he calls "symbols" and (ii) that Tillich's writings provide no explanation of what is meant by the claim that symbols participate in that to which they point. Finally, I abandon the term "participation" and give an analysis of Tillich's concept of a symbol in terms of his suggestion that symbols are accepted and responded to at the unconscious level. Myth and Transcendence, NINIAN SMART The aim is to analyze the concept of transcendence, neutrally as between most theists, and relevantly to demythologizing and to current deflationary pseudo-analyses of religious language. "Transcends" depends sense-wise on its objects, e.g., "space and time," "world," "human experience," "thought," even "existence." The last usage is confused; the next two back cannot mean "is totally beyond," or the religious focus vanishes; the first two are better. Here we treat "space" and "world = cosmos," especially the latter. God appears as non-spatial (not taking spatial predicates), hiddenly omnipresent, independent of the cosmos, continuously creative and specially present, e.g., in historical events. The last element can be iden tified with immanence, but otherwise immanence and transcendence are equivalent, the contrast evaporating when "beyond" and "within" are seen to be analogies. It is argued that the elements are, if problematically, compatible and mutually suggestive. Cassier's View of Myth and Symbol, DONALD VERENE This paper examines Ernst Cassirer's theory of myth and his concept of symbol insofar as it relates to myth. The author distinguishes two aspects of Cassirer's theory of myth. Cassirer regards myth both as the form or logic of primitive thought and as a special force in modern political life. It is argued that Cassirer's theory is questionable in each of these respects: (1) as a theory of primitive consciousness it fails to recognize adequately that the primitive has in addition to his mythical concept of the world a body of knowledge that can be described as rational and empirical; and (2) as a theory of the dynamics of modern political life it fails to recognize adequately the creative and perhaps necessary role that myth plays in rationalistic societies. These difficulties are intended to indicate areas of revision rather then irremediable flaws in Cassirer's theory.</page><page sequence="18">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 577 THE PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY Vol. XVII, No. 66: January, 1967 Experiences, J. M. HINTON The philosophical notion of an experience as a non-physical event, consisting (e.g.) in sensation or perception, is contrasted with the general notion of an experience as an event of which one is the subject. In one sense, A.I., to experience X-ing is simply to X with a certain sort of con tingently accompanying awareness: this is analyzed. In another sense group, B., "to experience" is not an auxiliary but a verb in its own right, similar to the verb "to perceive." The writer shares the view that seeing, hearing etc. are experienced only in the sense that these are verbs of B experiencing. The idea that seeing, hearing etc. are non-physical events is held to be supported only by familiar fallacies. A present-day tendency, to write as if the notion of a visual experience could be used as an instru ment of philosophical clarification, is criticized. Remembering Dreams, FREDERICK A. SIEGLER Meaning and the Use of Words, D. M. TAYLOR Problems about identity of meaning of two words or of two persons' use of a single word recur in discussions of the use of words. A further problem is to distinguish the sense of "the use of a word" in which a particular word has a use from the sense in which a word may have many uses (to describe, refer, commend, etc.) A criterion is offered of a word's having a use in the first sense and of identity of use in this sense. A word is said to have a use if and only if one person can teach another to use it, two words to have the same use if the teaching of them is identical. Some conclusions are drawn about the reationship between "criteria" of use and meaning in the case of mental words. One-Valued Logic, C. L. HAMBLIN It is sometimes argued that Logic must be two-valued since, if there could be no falsehood, there could be no truth either, and hence no com munication. This argument is confused. As an exercise in logical poverty it is of interest to consider a language in which assertion is possible but not denial. Conjunction and disjunction are possible in this language and there must be rules of inference, but no axioms, and hence no theorems. The language is, in some sense, "consistent" and, despite the lack of axioms, complete. It is capable of representing the logical structure of various rudimentary languages that have been considered by writers concerned with Logic's less formal features: Quine's "gavagai" language in Word and Object; the language of "feature-placing sentences" in Strawson's Indi viduals; and Wittgenstein's "slab" language.</page><page sequence="19">578 PH ILOSOPHI CAL ABSTRACTS The Nature and Classes of Prescriptive Judgments, AMARTYA K. SEN In this paper three different, but inter-connected, methods of clas sifying prescriptive judgments are introduced. It is claimed that certain standard problems of ethics become clearer when viewed in the light of these classifications. Problems are chosen in the following four regions to illustrate this claim: (a) the concept of "reason" for a value judgment and the relevance of factual considerations in ethical debates; (b) the prob lem of holding to some general moral principles which can conflict; (c) contrasting versions of utilitarianism and the conflict between "act utilitarianism" and "rule utilitarianism"; and (d) the relationship between preferring and choosing. These exercises illustrate the kinds of uses that can be made of these methods of classifying judgments that will probably be found useful in dealing with a number of other ethical problems. THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW Vol. LXXV, No. 4: October, 1966 Three Ways of Spilling Ink, J. L. AUSTIN * The assigning of responsibility for an action often turns on the ques tion of whether the agent did whatever he did intentionally, or deliberately or on purpose. These three expressions are generally used by philosophers, and by lawyers, as if they were synonyms. However, a study of the use of these expressions in actual or hypothetical situations, as well as an examina tion of their grammar and etymology, reveals important differences which have bearing on moral philosophy and the law. Consequently, to spill the ink intentionally, or deliberately or on purpose is to do three different things. By examining the differences, a better understanding can be achieved of the concepts of intention, deliberation and purpose, and of the notion of human action. The Direction of Causation, J. L. MACKIE We seem to recognize a relation of causal priority, distinct from tem poral priority, which constitutes the difference between causing and being the effect of; the problem is to give an account of this relation. Several possible analyses of causal priority (including ones based on controllability or effectiveness, and on entropy increase) are considered and rejected. Light is thrown on this relation by an imaginary precognition experiment which, if successful, would give evidence for time-reversed causation. This leads to an account of causal priority in terms of the contrast between fixity (as seen in what is past or present) and nonfixity (as seen in future contingents). An account is also given of priority with respect to the dispersal of order. * This abstract has been prepared by L. W. Forguson who edited the original paper.</page><page sequence="20">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 579 It is concluded that this last, causal priority as analyzable in terms of fixity, and temporal priority are all distinct: it is a contingent fact that they seem always to coincide. Consistency, FREDERIC SCHICK This paper attempts to explicate the criterion of rationality expressed in the consistency (or coherence) of a man's beliefs, confidence-ratings, values, etc. The first four sections consider the consistency of beliefs. Two principles are identified as basic: (1) that if a man believes p, he cannot consistently believe not-p, and (2) that if he believes p and, further, q is at least as well confirmed relative to his information as p is, he cannot consistently not believe q. Various consequences of these two principles are developed and discussed. The fifth section considers the consistency of confidence-ratings (degrees of belief). Two principles analogous to the two cited above turn out to suffice in this connection. The consistency of valuations and of preference-ratings is briefly considered in the last section. PHILOSOPHY Vol. LXI, No. 158: October, 1966 Optimism, MARGARET A. BODEN Optimism is no longer generally regarded as worthy of rational argu ment, but it should not be dismissed so lightly. A distinction is drawn between psychological and philosophical forms of optimism, and it is argued that some notorious examples of "optimism" are not really instances of philosophical optimism at all, for they make no specific claims capable of rational discussion. A model of philosophical optimism is suggested, in terms of which various examples are compared and discussed. The model consists of three elements: a statement of the facts, a list of value-criteria, and a positive evaluation of those facts in terms of those values. Historical examples are discussed showing that disagreement can arise in connection with any of the three elements, giving different forms of optimism and dif ferent forms of attack. The "facts" must include some analysis of the empirical nature of man and society; if we are unsure of our facts we must return an open verdict on at least some forms of optimism. The Use of Moral Concepts in Literary Criticism, ERIL GILMAN In recent years some critics have claimed that literature has to do with matters of such significance that they cannot be discussed under the head of "aesthetics." The views of such critics are frequently couched in moral terms. However, the language they use is often imprecise, they blur impor tant distinctions, and do not face squarely the problems of validating the different kinds of statement they make. They confuse questions of conscience and questions of taste with matters which are empirical. The relation is</page><page sequence="21">580 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS misconceived between such matters as the worth of a work as literature, the moral propriety of the author or his emotional maturity, and the effects of his writings on his readers. Such muddle, it is argued, can lead to the sort of intolerance which witholds approval from any work of literature which does not express the moral outlook of the critic. On Talking about the Arts, LOUIS ARNAUD RE?D Two kinds of talk considered, aesthetics and criticism?mutually interdependent. How can aesthetics, talking generalizations, be relevant to individual works of art? (a) Because language (e.g., about "configura tion") is generalized from art experiences, (b) The aesthetic meaning of generalization only understood by reference-back to art-experience. (c) Criticism, though concerned with individual works, logically presup poses aesthetic generalization, e.g., that aesthetic unity is essentially indi vidual. (Criticism can't exorcise aesthetics, as Hampshire illogically hoped.) How can criticism legitimately use general language? Isenberg, Langer, Righter, considered. Critical language (necessarily containing general words) does not designate art-qualities, but helps us?by approxim ation, suggestion, metaphor to perceive with greater aesthetic discrimina tion. It has its own, aesthetically functional, but not scientific, precision. Therefore, there are opposite and necessary tensions in aesthetics and criti cism. The critic, dwelling with the individual only, is wordless. Out of contact with individual art, the aesthetician's words are empty. After-images and Pains, JOSEPH MARGOLIS I argue that it must be possible to hold the following position: (a) that people report their pains( and similar sensations); (b) that the occurrence of pains (and similar sensations) is a contingent matter; (c) that first person reports of pain (and similar sensations) are intelligible but unverifi able. It must be possible, I claim, because, on the account advanced, we are forced to admit the counterpart for the case of after-images (and of images). Nevertheless, it is a position regularly avoided or denied. I wish to defend, therefore, an unpopular (but, I believe, inescapable) line of inquiry. In Pursuit of Performatives, L. W. FORGUSON It has been suggested, by Roderick Chisholm, in "J. L. Austin's Philosophical Papers," Mind, LXXIII, no. 289, and Max Black, in "Austin on Performatives," Philosophy, XXXVIII, no. 145, that J. L. Austin gave up his famous performative-constative distinction too readily. Each puts forth an amended definition of performatives, involving distinguishing two "senses" in which an utterance may be performative, which is intended to avoid the difficulties that led Austin to abandon the doctrine and to develop, in How to Do Things With Words, a more thoroughgoing analysis of the "forces of utterances." It is argued in this paper that neither Chisholm's nor Black's amendments escape the difficulties that Austin encountered. The</page><page sequence="22">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 581 author argues, in agreement with Austin, that there is no good reason to distinguish between performatives and other sorts of utterances, because all utterances have a "performative" role to play in discourse. PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH Vol. XXVII, No. 1: September, 1966 Happiness and Time, WLADYSLAW TATARKIEWICZ Realization and Unconscious Inference, JOHN WILLIAMSON Two things are attempted here: to explore the relation between realizing, inferring, perceiving, remembering, and being conscious; and to argue that equating normal visual perception with unconscious inference is a prima facie absurdity. A few cases are discussed to show that realizing is a mental event that can sometimes but not always be identified with perceiving, with inferring, or with not-forgetting. A borderline case is described in order to maximize the temptation to identify perceiving with inferring. Some reasons are given for saying that it is hard to make sense of the notion of unconscious inference, especially if ordinary visual percep tion is claimed to be an instance of it. Science, Truth, and Ordinary Language, RICHARD H. SCHL?GEL One purpose of this article is to correct the current false assumption that ordinary language is a self-contained, self-sufficient, absolute frame work. As pervasive a conceptual scheme as it is, ordinary language still has developed within very limited physical and physiological conditions, and this imposes a representation of the world reflecting these limited conditions. It is this that underlies the traditional notion of correspondence as explicat ing both the test and nature of truth. Most of the article is devoted to showing how developments in the physical sciences from Copernicanism to Relativity theory have affected revisions in our conceptual framework impos ing new representations of the world on our thought. It is suggested that these developments imply a relational conception of the universe described as contextualistic realism. The challenge facing philosophers today is to revise ordinary language to accommodate recent developments in physics conveying a radically different conception of the universe than that imposed by ordinary language. Pragmatism and the Outlook of Modern Science, REUBEN ABEL What I hope I have shown is the unique pertinence of pragmatism to the characteristic outlook and problems of the world of modern science. In its theory of reality as constituted by the inter-action of man and his environment, and in its view of truth as entailing human activity and inquiry, the philosophy of pragmatism provides a framework for under</page><page sequence="23">582 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS standing the concepts, constructs, facts, theories, and laws of the sciences; for comprehending the status of geometry and logic; for dealing with such problems as determinism, induction, probability, and rationality; for a theory of meaning; for the procedure of the historian; and for an attitude of empiricist open-mindedness which may well be the most enduring con tribution of philosophy to the human enterprise." An Approach to a Philosophical Anthropology, RICHARD M. ZANER The "crisis" of man, emphasized by numerous thinkers, prompts the urgent re-asking of the question, What is man? This essay seeks to deter mine the sense of the question, and suggests an approach to the core phenomenon. It is argued that the question is not linguistic, empirical, or a quest for "properties" or "substance." Rather is it ontological: the "what-is-it?" question does not bear on the "what" but the "is." This question, however, turns back on the being of the asker, disclosing it as both subject and object, and as being reflexively aware of itself as such. The "mystery" (Marcel) of "human-being" (Heidegger) is disclosed to be self conscious subjectivity in quest of itself; the reflexivity of human-being is ontologically a being-in-quest, or being-concerned. This phenomenon, finally, is held to be publicly verifiable, and its philosophical articulation the central task of phenomenological anthropology. Introspection and Incorrigibility, CHARLES RAFF In his recent article, "Is Introspection Incorrigible?", D. M. Armstrong presents versions of four current arguments designed to show that a person's introspective knowledge of his current mental state is not incorrigible. Each argument is shown to be unsound. To evaluate Armstrong's arguments three different technical senses of "incorrigible" are distinguished. One of Armstrong's arguments is an attempt to show that, if introspection is incorrigible, then it is meaningless to speak of awareness of one's own cur rent mental state. In this argument Armstrong employs a "contrast prin ciple" of meaningfulness which has the unwanted consequence that many sentences which express necessary truths turn out to be meaningless. In another of his arguments Armstrong appeals to an ontological principle: if individuals a and b are non-identical, then it is possible that a exists and b does not exist. This principle is shown to be unacceptable. Homeostasis, Society, and Values, RADHAKAMAL MUKERJEE Homeostasis implies maintenance and improvement of stability of the organism, revealing the potentialities of life in its different dimensions. The concept of values is derived from the basic homeostatic functions of self maintenance, control and directiveness towards dynamic equilibrium. In evolutionary progress the fields of life rise to greater complexity and higher dimensions, including not simply man but the society, culture, and man kind-as-a-whole. Man adds to his internal environment his external, non biological homeostatic environment of his society and culture. This involves a purposeful and qualitatively distinct pattern of homeostatic living adopted</page><page sequence="24">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 583 by men at the level of psycho-social evolution. Groups, societies, and cul tures develop ever more integrated values, "wholes," or homeostatic systems of organized relations, behavior, and values, in and with reference to which individual goals, purposes, and obligations arise and are integrated and ordered in a system of "natural" hierarchy. Indexical Sentences and Cartesian Rationalism, RICHARD W. PELTZ In Meditation I, Descartes apparently casts doubt on his ultimate rationalistic criterion of clear and distinct conception by invoking the evil genius. This doubt applies to two kinds of statements: those based on evidence of the senses and mathematical statements. "I am," however, is of a different logical kind, an indexical sentence, and thus may escape even the doubt created by the evil genius, being grounded only in clear and distinct conception. Indexical sentences cannot be separated from their pragmatic contexts of utterance in the way nonindexical sentences can. All sentences of the latter kind require a divine guarantee; some of the former do not. Meditation V suggests that Descartes was aware of the logical difference between sentences like "2 + 2 = 4" and "I am." Similarly, the passage in the Discourse on Method which invokes the divine guarantee confines itself solely to the problem of truth in nonindexical sentences. About the Problem of Truth, JAMES E. TOMBERLIN RATIO Vol. VIII, No. 2 December, 1966 On Potential Surprise, ISAAC LEVI The paper offers a reconstruction of G. L. S. Shackle's theory of potential surprise. Degrees of potential surprise, (degrees of disbelief) and degrees of belief are defined with the aid of "caution dependent and deductively cogent acceptance rules." The result may be viewed as a generalization to the case of degrees of belief of the requirement that the set of sentences believed true by a rational agent form a consistent and deductively closed set. It is argued that Shackle has captured a notion of degrees of belief which is important for understanding inductive inference and not identifiable with subjective probability. Shackle is criticized for denying importance to subjective probability. It is possible to specify certain definite relations between surprise and probability even though neither is reducible to the other. 'He': A Study in the Logic of Self-Consciousness, HECTOR-NERI CASTA?EDA In sections 3 and 4 the logic of T is discussed. This provides a background for the investigation into the logic of statements that ascribe</page><page sequence="25">584 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS self-consciousness to another person, e.g., (1) "Mary believes that Peter loves her" and (2) "The Editor of Soul knows that he (himself) is a mil lionaire." Here is a special use of the third-person pronoun, which is contrasted with six other common uses of it. The use of it in (1) and (2) is characterized, inter alia, by the following properties: (A) it appears in oratio obliqua, i.e., in clauses subordinated to verbs predicating proposi tional (cognitive) acts or attitudes to some person X; (B) it has as antecedent an expression referring to X; (C) it is used to attribute to X a first-person reference; (D) it is not proxy for its antecedent: e.g., (2) above is a different statement from "The Editor of Soul knows that the Editor of Soul is a millionaire." Iterated oratio obliqua, with consequent problems, is discussed. Several interesting principles are formulated. On Theoretical Entities, R. M. MARTIN "The Will to Believe" Revisted, ROBERT W. BEARD Much of the polemic called forth by James's essay "The Will to Believe" has focussed on the theme that it encourages wantonness or wish fulness in thinking. These criticisms stem in part from a failure to under stand the structure of James's argument, and in part from an inherent vagueness in his formulation of the conditions for a genuine option. What James is actually concerned with is a strategy for obtaining evidence for the religious hypothesis and furnishing a basis for action until such evidence is forthcoming. Two concepts of probability are crucial for an under standing of the notion of a genuine option. When the latter notion is clarified, the conditions for its application are seen to be so stringent that it appears doubtful that any options are genuine in James' sense.</page></plain_text>
