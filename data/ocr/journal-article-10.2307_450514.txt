Dekker and Ford, The Sun's Darling Down the Thames from Renaissance London, approximately three miles east of St. Paul's and on the Surrey shore, in a location which came to be known, variously, as Cuckold's Haven or Cuckold's Point, stood a monument to the ostensibly unavoidable consequences of marrying a woman. Though some distance from the City proper, the priapic marker of Cuckold's Haven-a makeshift arrangement of wooden pole topped by animal horns- participated in an odd form of literary engagement with the drama of early Jacobean London, coming to serve, paradoxically, as an urban icon. From its earliest recorded appearance in the diary of Henry Machyn in 1562, Cuckold's Haven provided London's playwrights with a popular local reference point.' Edward Sugden's dictionary of topographical allusions in English Renaissance drama cites over a dozen references to the locale, most of them in comedies directly concerned with London or London characters.2 In plays like The London Prodigal (1604), Northward Ho! (1605), The Isle of Gulls (1606), and The Travails of the Three English Brothers (1607), Cuckold's Haven constitutes the equivalent of a Douglas Bruster currently studies at Harvard University.

(1605), for example, Security, Winifred, and Quicksilver-a trio of unscrupulous city adventurers who have set out for Virginia-wash ashore at that humiliating location. Ford, Rowley, and Dekker's The Witch of Edmonton (1621) refers to it almost proverbially: "that confidence is a wind, that has blown many a married Man ashore at Cuckold's Haven, I can tell you" (II.ii.29-30).4 Only two years later, however, the marker at Cuckold's Haven seems to have disappeared. The Water Poet John Taylor, in "A Discovery by Sea, from London to Salisbury" (1623), lamented the absence of both horn and pole: For there old Time had such confusion wrought, That of that ancient place remained nought. No monumental memorable Horn, Or tree or Post, which hath those Trophies born, Was left, whereby Posterity may know Where their forefathers' Crests did grow, or show.5 However accurate Taylor's chronicle of the marker's vanishing, it should be pointed out that London possessed two different myths of origin concerning Cuckold's Haven, both supported by a similar model of social interaction. One account revolves around the sexual indiscretions of the last Angevin monarch: "The Miller of Charlton, having discovered K[ing] John kissing his wife, demanded compensation, and was granted all the land he could see from his door. He therefore claimed all as far as this point, which was thereafter called C[uckold's] P[oint]. The king, however, added this condition, that he should walk every 18th of October (St. Luke's Day) to the point with a pair of buck's horns on his head."6 An alternate version of the foundation story appears in Nicholas Breton's 1612 pamphlet Cornu-copiae (subtitled Pasquil's Night-cap: or, Antidote for the Head-ache), where the cuckold's pole has been erected in honor of Lady Fortune for her role in the simultaneous creation of marriage and cuckoldry. The official establishment of Cuckold's Haven, Breton relates, came about when "certain London butchers" consented That they sufficient horns should still provide, For to repair the post when it should need: And for reward the neighbouring fields should be Theirs and their heirs' to hold eternally: Provided still, that horns did never want, For then they made a forfeit of their grant.7</page><page sequence="3">DOUGLAS BRUSTER Even as John demanded of the Miller a ritual of debasement before the community in return for granting him certain property rights, the London butchers agree to continual maintenance of the pole and horns in exchange for title to "the neighbouring fields" in perpetuity. Like the anecdote of John's infidelity, Breton's account of the origin of Cuckold's Haven describes a pageant of contractual obligation. Indeed a large part of what these two pieces of folkloric mythology have in common is an imaginative explanation of cuckoldry based on a delineation of exchange in which women like the Miller's wife are employed, in a system of male-to-male transaction, as the literalized, objectified version of what Pierre Bourdieu calls "symbolic capital": "a transformed and thereby disguised form of physical 'economic' capital."8 The native fabliau had traditionally represented women as helpless counters signifying loss (to the cuckold) and victory (to the one who cuckolds) in ludic struggles between men: witness, for example, the narrative and intranarrative role of another Miller's wife (and daughter) in The Reeve's Tale.9 Yet that which is, in medieval literature, "disguised" capital became for Shakespeare's London an overwhelmingly explicit doubling of the monetary on the plane of the personal, an articulation on the comedic level of the new intricacies and extensions of the economic. In the middle of his narrative, in fact, Breton foregrounds the commercial implications of Cuckold's Haven in observing "That cuckolds often are the wealthiest men" and that "Profit and pleasure both spring from the horn."10 During the two decades prior to the publication of Breton's pamphlet in 1612 the myth of cuckoldry came to play a cardinal role in London's drama. Katharine Eisaman Maus points out that "not only does jealousy dominate the plots of many plays, but songs about the cuckolded and the abandoned, jokes and saws about the unreliability of wives and lovers, turn up in other plays on the slightest of pretexts. 11 Indeed it is difficult to overestimate the predominance of cuckoldry in the popular drama of the period. I say "popular" drama because, although cuckoldry and the fear of cuckoldry pervade many of the era's private theater tragedies, for the most part cuckoldry remains inextricably linked with the populace, with images of fertility and, further (through its association with the cornucopia and horned animal ritual) with the countryside: see, for instance, the climactic scene of The Merry Wives of Windsor (1597/1600-1601). Like the myth of "cony 197</page><page sequence="4">198 CUCKOLDRY AND CAPITAL IN DRAMA catching," which gave the pamphleteers of the nineties a popular, rural conceit with which to interpret urban confidence games, cuckoldry served as a portal trope between country and city, a figure with which the playwrights of the English Renaissance projected their economic vision of London's intensifying social dynamics. In the remarks that follow, I will attempt to delineate the structural logic of cuckoldry as a metaphor of labor and economic relationships defined by gender, hoping to contribute to an understanding of the myth's role as a central constituent in London's theatrical grammar of cultural change. 1. Cuckoldry and the Good Husband Cuckoldry (which is in literature at least as old as the Greek Anthology) made its first explicit appearance as a trope for labor in a passage in Horace's Satires, where mimicry of the cuckoo appears as an aggressive taunt: tumrn Praenestinus salso multoque fluenti expressa arbusto regerit convicia, durus vindemiator et invinctus, cui saepe viator cessisset magna compellans voce cuculum. Then in answer to this torrent of wit the Praenestine returned the real squeezings, like a vine dresser, tough and unbeatable, to whom the vanquished wayfarer had often shouted "cuckoo."12 Appropriately opposing the antagonistic pair- "vindemiator . . . viator"-at opposite ends of his line, Horace describes the vindemiator, "vine dresser" as durus et invinctus, both "tough and unbeatable": indeed, his point revolves around the word cuculus as a challenge, an insulting taunt. Also important is the antag- onists' status, for their occupations define their narrative person- alities as well as their social roles. The viator, "traveller" or "wayfarer," heckles the industrious vine dresser, implying that he has been late in pruning his vines-something that should be completed before the cuckoo appears in the spring. Pliny provided the background information for this somewhat puzzling incident in his discussion of the farmer's springtime duties: In this space of time the farmer must hurry on during the first fortnight with work which he has not had time to finish before the equinox, while realising that this is the</page><page sequence="5">DOUGLAS BRUSTER origin of the rude habit of jeering at people pruning their vines by imitating the note of the visiting bird called the cuckoo, as it is considered disgraceful and deserving of reproach for that bird to find the pruning-hook being used on the vine; and consequently wanton jokes [were made].'13 The "consequently" (et ob id) of Pliny's last line bridges the gap between labor and sexuality; for the cuckoo to find a man at work symbolically testifies to that man's inadequacy, partly because being caught in such a position implies tardiness, even impotence, and partly because it focuses public ridicule (or at least poses the threat of public scrutiny) upon the laborer. The "wanton jokes" (petulantiae sales) probably find their source in the castration threat implied by the business of pruning and in the implicit argument-one which Renaissance drama would continually suggest-that sexual intercourse itself is a kind of physical labor. This archetypal struggle between viator and vindemiator, predator and husband, underlies the long history of the cuckold myth. The patiently productive husband-vine dresser, blacksmith, moneylender, tobacconist, farmer-is robbed and mocked by a picaresque opportunist. Methods of labor constitute the crux of the struggle in a seemingly transcultural archetype. On one side lies craft as intellectual expression-that is, "guile"-on the other craft meaning occupation, or steady employment at a trade. Out of these polarities, from two different and competitive conceptions of labor and production, came a social tension resolved by cuckoldry. What led to the association of cuckoldry with labor? I suggest that the connection has its source in the historical gendering of patient production as feminine, in at least partial relation to the notion of pregnancy and "labor" as primary production. Although the effort associated with childbirth had long been described as "labor," only around 1610 does Shakespeare use the word specif- ically in reference to a woman in labor.'4 Likewise in the various English editions of the Bible it is not until the Douai (1609) and the King James (1611) that "labour" is used to describe Rachel's mortal delivery (Genesis 35:16).15 The word "husband" itself enjoyed in Renaissance usage both its current meaning of "man joined to a woman by marriage" (OED 1.2), and also "one who tills and cultivates the soil" (11.3), "the manager of a household or establishment" (11.4), or more specifically "one who manages his household, or his affairs in business in general, well or ill, profitably or wastefully" (11.4). Thomas Tusser's didactic poem in 199</page><page sequence="6">200 CUCKOLDRY AND CAPITAL IN DRAMA praise of thrift, Five Hundred Points of Good Husbandry (adapted from his own A Hundred Good Points of Husbandry (1557)) and appearing in at least ten editions between 1573 and 1672) provides a succinct, rhyming definition: "The husband is he that to labor doth fall, / the labor of him I do husbandry call." "16 Husbandry is labor. Schmidt cites instances of Shakespeare employing the term in each of the above meanings, many of them emphasizing the word's connections with property and labor.'7 In The Taming of the Shrew (1593-1594), for instance, the father/cuckold Vincentio provides an early, figurative example of what would shortly become concrete: "0, I am undone, I am undone! While I play the good husband at home, my son and servant spend all at the university" (V.i.68-70). In this (almost parodically) typical comedic lament, the senex iratus decries the traditional profligacy of his son and servant, an indiscretion only exacerbated in light of his patient labor as a "good husband." If the twin marital and economic meanings of "husband" underscored the social implications of cuckoldry, so did the Renaissance "huswife" (or "housewife"), meaning both "a woman skilled in female business and superintending the concerns of a family" and "a hussy." 18 A woman who controlled the household economy, who "wore the breeches," seemed more likely to control her own sexual economy. In the misogynistic words of lago to Emilia, women are pictures out a' doors, Bells in your parlors, wild-cats in your kitchens, Saints in your injuries, devils being offended, Players in your huswifery, and huswives in your beds. (II.i. 109-12) His last line connects the dual meanings of "huswife": the domestic manager and the unrestrained sexual wanton. lago leaves it strategically unclear whether by "you," the governing subject of his insult, he means women like his wife and Desdemona or women in general. He avoids clarifying his slur immediately thereafter when claiming "You rise to play, and go to bed to work" (II.i.115), conflating, once again, sexuality with labor. lago gives the connection its clearest expression, however, in describing Bianca, a prostitute of Cyprus, as "A huswife that by selling her desires / Buys herself bread and clothes" (IV.i.94-95).</page><page sequence="7">DOUGLAS B R U S T E R 2. The Drudgery of Labor I alluded above to the concluding scene of The Merry Wives of Windsor, where Falstaff becomes a literal scapegoat, the bourgeois community of Windsor diluting through concerted ridicule the threat of his predatory priapism. In this way Shakespeare's play, a "city comedy" in every aspect save locale, functionally endorses middle-class husbandry. More often in the drama of the period the cuckold is not the predator, but rather the practitioner of hus- bandry. Cuckoldry's metaphoric origins in the drudgery of the husband can be seen clearly in the parade of animals associated with the image. The horned ox is frequently described as the cuckold's emblem, hence King John's legendary request that the Miller perform his cuckold walk on St. Luke's day-the enduring ox being Luke's iconographic symbol.'9 The camel and snail, both harmless drudges, were frequently portrayed as cuckolds as well; perhaps more to the point, the snail was customarily depicted in proverbs as a householder, one that bore his domicile atop his own back.20 Foremost among the cuckold animals, of course, is the ass, the traditional beast of burden. Accutus, in Every Woman in Her Humour (1607), literalizes the correspondence between the ass's ears and the cuckold's horns when he taunts "thou hast long ears, and thinkest them horns, thy conceits cuckolds thee" (V.i. 197-98).21 The transformation of Bottom into an ass in A Midsummer Night's Dream (1595-1596), like that of Midas and Lucius, Apuleius's protagonist, takes this form for the purpose of social ridicule. Bottom, the butt of much of the play's humor, is the lucky agent of Oberon's wittolry, or self-cuckoldry. Modern productions of the comedy tend to make explicit potential jokes concerning Bottom's enlarged genitals and the intercourse he engages in with Titania. What goes relatively unexamined in contemporary discourse concerning the play, however, is the rationale for Bottom's agency in the cuckold plot. Why is it necessary for the royal Oberon to employ Bottom in the ostensible "punishment" of his wife? Is it simply because Bottom comes, as his name suggests, from the lowest possible rank of the social ladder? I would argue that it evolves out of Bottom's status as a laborer and as an Athenian, a mechanical belonging to the city. Bottom acts out, even personifies, the dialectic between country and city, a tension set up by modes of labor. His "use" to Oberon parallels the manner in which Cuckold's Haven traditionally drew city types. Yet Bottom is a user himself. His insistence upon reducing Titania's four Fairies to 201</page><page sequence="8">202 CUCKOLDRY AND CAPITAL IN DRAMA their use value, in fact, seems to reflect a larger scheme of social behavior, a pattern of activity in which Oberon, Theseus, and the rest of the "upper class" of the drama participate: "Good Master Mustardseed, I know your patience well. That same cowardly, giant-like ox-beef hath devour'd many a gentleman of your house. I promise you your kindred hath made my eyes water ere now. I desire you of more acquaintance, good Master Mustardseed" (III.i. 191-96). In passages such as this, A Midsummer Night's Dream antici- pates the city comedies of the early Jacobean era even as it begins to close the door on the pastoral possibilities of Lyly's drama. The city seems to bear responsibility for this change. Bottom's manipu- lation at the hands of Oberon enacts a rural version of what would shortly become a standard dramatic scenario (the cuckolding of a citizen by a gallant) for although Bottom is, symbolically at least, made a priapic cuckold figure, he is enlisted in a labor that will at once reinitiate Titania into the adult sphere of heterosexuality, enact Oberon's desires toward Titania-or rather, his desires concerning her desires-and prove to her the dangers of "her" excess. Bottom thus wins and loses: as an urban pawn in cuckolding Oberon, he sensually redeems with sexual labor his own role as cuckold and comic scapegoat. Indeed, the concept of "drudgery" permeates the dramatic construction of labor in the work of Shakespeare and his dramatic contemporaries. Frequently it refers to the work required during sexual intercourse. In describing his escape from the stupendous bulk of Nell, who "would have [him] as a beast," the Syracusan Dromio calls her a "drudge," apparently displacing upon her his own fears of bond-slavery (III.ii.140). Angelica, Juliet's Nurse, chortles how "I am the drudge, and toil in your delight; / But you shall bear the burthen soon at night" (II.v.75-76). Mouldy, about to be "pricked" for military service in 2 Henry IV (1598), complains that "I was prick'd well enough before, and you could have let me alone. My old dame will be undone now for one to do her husbandry and her drudgery" (III.ii. 111-13). One might look as well at Firk in The Shoemakers' Holiday (1599)-his name a crude euphemism for "to copulate"-who pleads with Rowland Lacy, an impressment officer, to allow a young married couple, Jane and Rafe, to stay together. Firk claims that Rafe is "as good a workman at a prick and an awl, as any is in our trade" (I.i.139-40). If Rafe goes to the wars, Jane "shall be laid at one side like a pair of old shoes else, and be occupied for no use" (I.i.142-43). Thus "occu-</page><page sequence="9">DOUGLAS BRUSTER 2 pation," meaning both to work on shoes with a prick and an awl, and to occupy-or not to occupy-one's wife, embraces both sex and industry. Othello plays on the senses of "occupation" as both coitus and livelihood (adding also the sense of military "occupa- tion") in his line "Othello's occupation's gone."22 "Occupy" alone constituted an extremely common sexual pun in Renaissance drama.23 Underlying Mouldy's claim, however, and not present in Firk's or Othello's, is a slight trepidation, almost the proverbial Shakespearean "sex nausea." In Mouldy's description, sex is toil. Lavatch, the clown in All's Well That Ends Well (1602-1603), jests with the Countess of Rossillion about his intended marriage, suggesting "I hope to have friends for my wive's sake." When the Countess retorts "Such friends are thine enemies, knave," Lavatch launches into an extended syllogism, a sorites, on the benefits of wittolry: Y'are shallow, madam-in great friends, for the knaves come to do that for me which I am a-weary of. He that ears my land spares my team, and gives me leave to inn the crop. If I be his cuckold, he's my drudge. He that comforts my wife is the cherisher of my flesh and blood; he that cherishes my flesh and blood loves my flesh and blood; he that loves my flesh and blood is my friend: ergo, he that kisses my wife is my friend. (I. iii. 39-50) At the beginning of his utterance Lavatch uses the traditional metaphor for sexuality and childbirth which occurs so memorably in Antony and Cleopatra (1606-1607)-Agrippa, speaking of Caesar and Cleopatra, tells Enobarbus "He ploughed her, and she cropp'd" (II.ii.228). Lavatch, however, speaks finally of sexuality with the air of reluctance lurking behind Mouldy's metaphor. Lavatch pictures procreation as a form of labor, and expresses his delight at the exchange: "If I be his cuckold, he's my drudge." The close of this speech plays on the wedded unification of husband and wife claimed by Ephesians, "So ought men to love their wives, as their own bodies: he that loveth his wife, loveth himself" (5:28) and hints at the homosocial bonding frequently seen in the wittol relationship: "He that kisses my wife is my friend."24 The wittol often admires some aspect of the cuckolder's personality or station, perhaps explaining why, in the drama of the period, the wittol is so often a social-climbing citizen, the cuckolder so often an aristocrat; "class," in its modern sense of 203</page><page sequence="10">204 CUCKOLDRY ANDC A P I TAL IN DRAMA "prestige," is that which seeks and is sought by money. Linda Woodbridge cautions against reading such literary scenarios as history, suggesting that "it is unlikely that young aristocrats cuckolded prosperous merchants with such regularity in real life: gallants would have had little motive for patronizing a drama based on such wish-fulfillment fantasies if they were getting their own social revenge by cuckolding real citizens."25 I would main- tain, however, that the import of the cuckold scenario in English Renaissance drama does not depend upon its realistically reflecting the social scene, but rather in the urgency and consistency of pattern to the merchant/cuckold thematic-that is, in what it tells us about how London's playwrights expounded their sense of the relations in question. 3. Merchants and the Fruitful Horn Why are merchants so often cuckolds, and cuckolds so often merchants? I have argued above that part of the explanation lies in the predator/husband rivalry, where cuckoldry is a carnivalesque celebration of what seems an older and more fertile way of existence. Another reason lies in the reception of methodical labor as effeminate. There are other, related, causes. Money typically has been portrayed as an impediment to the body physical and procreation.26 Stephen Hannaford goes so far even to state that "it is a commonplace of the English Renaissance stage that he who enjoys fortune rarely enjoys sex."27 Such fears perhaps derive from money's anthropomorphic nature, for coins, merely in their aesthetic aspect, multiply an individual's visage almost beyond accounting. Interest and profit are frequently understood as reproductive, generative acts, and thus compete with natural fertility. As the goddess of Shakespeare's Venus and Adonis puts it: "gold that's put to use more gold begets" (line 768). Flamineo's famous image from Webster's The White Devil (1612) tellingly illustrates the extent to which anxiety infused the reproductive aesthetic. In an insincere attempt to assuage Camillo's fears, he relates: It seems you are jealous; I'll show you the error of it by a familiar example: I have seen a pair of spectacles fashioned with such perspective art, that lay down but one twelve- pence o'th'board, 'twill appear as if there were twenty; now should you wear a pair of these spectacles, and see your wife tying her shoe, you would imagine twenty hands were taking up your wife's clothes. (I.ii.95-101 )28</page><page sequence="11">DOU GL AS BRUSTER 2 Flamineo's spectacles show a world engaged in uncontrolled and uncontrollable reproduction. Multiple perspective combines with undiscriminating fertility to produce, for the householding "hus- band" Camillo, a nightmare of generation. The merchant must also accustom himself to allowing wealth and commodity to pass from his hands into that of another. The connection with marriage and cuckoldry resides, at root, in the problems of ownership. The anxiety latent within the concept of property itself is nowhere better evidenced than by Antonio's fellow merchants in The Merchant of Venice (1596-1597), who respond to the drama's opening line-"In sooth, I know not why I am so sad"-with what can only be described as archetypally bourgeois psychology. Salerio suggests: "Your mind is tossing on the ocean, / There where your argosies with portly sail / Like signiors and rich burghers on the flood" (I.i.8-10). Solanio echoes the conceit, agreeing Believe me, sir, had I such venture forth, The better part of my affections would Be with my hopes abroad. I should be still Plucking the grass to know where sits the wind, Piring in maps for ports and piers and roads; And every object that might make me fear Misfortune to my ventures, out of doubt Would make me sad. (I.i. 15-22) Indeed he goes on to give further hypothetical anecdotes, con- cluding for the both of them: "I know Antonio / Is sad to think upon his merchandise" (I.i.39-40).29 Because to be a merchant is to risk loss, to render commodity up to chance, the business of commerce produces inescapable anxiety. The first part of Thomas Dekker's The Honest Whore (1604), subtitled "with the Humours of the Patient Man and the Longing Wife," offers a provocative example of how the cuckold/merchant's patience may translate into profit. In this play Fustigo and Viola, wife of Candido, an unbelievably patient merchant, attempt to devise methods of shaking Candido's seemingly unswayable patience: Fustigo. .... make him a cuckold. Wife. Puh, he would count such a cut no unkindness. Fustigo. The honester Citizen he. (I ii.93-95)3? 205</page><page sequence="12">206 CUCKOLDRY AND CAPITAL IN DRAMA Candido receives the following praise from Fluello-"Thou art a blest man, and with peace doest deal, / Such a meek spirit can bless a commonweal" (I.v.228-29)-and it soon becomes apparent that, in Dekker's bourgeois world view, the cuckold merchant is a kind of Christ figure with almost supernatural endurance.31 Rather than an object of derision, Candido serves as role model. Castruchio, aptly named in that he attempts to castrate Candido symbolically by cutting a penny's-worth of linen precisely from the center of the bolt (thus ruining the piece), reacts with amazement at the hermaphroditic patience of the merchant: "is't possible that Homo, / Should be nor man, nor woman: not once moov'd;- / No not at such an injury, at all!" (I.v.106-108). The "cut" he insists upon plays both on Viola's "he would count such a cut no unkindness" and the contemporary bawdy reference of the term to the pudendum.32 Candido allows Castruchio to do what he likes with his cut, claiming that "We are set here to please all customers" (I.v.121). For Candido, symbolic cuckoldry is good business. Dekker's portrayal of the admirable, hermaphroditic cuckold goes hand in hand with his admiration for patient endurance-this is the author, after all, of Patient Grissel (1600)- and with his support of commercial activity generally: The Shoemakers' Holiday stands as the strongest voice in a choir of pro-industry literary works. Merchants were often portrayed as brokers of their wives' sexuality. It is to this commonplace of characterization which Corvino alludes when, in the midst of attempting to use his wife for financial gain in Volpone (1606), he calls jealousy a "poor, unprofitable humor" (II.vii.7).33 The Country Wench of Middle- ton's Michaelmas Term (1606) plays upon this as well in asking "Is not wholesale the chiefest merchandise? Do you think some merchants could keep their wives so brave, but for their wholesale? You're foully deceiv'd and you think so" (IV.ii. 13-16).34 Wholesale here is actually prostitution: her double-entendre was more obvious in the first and second quartos of the play, which read "hole-sale." The idea of marriage as "hole-sale," as prostitution, dogged merchants throughout late Elizabethan and early Jacobean drama. Purge, the jealous apothecary of Middleton's The Family of Love (1602), opens the second act with a notice: "'Tis time for tradesmen to be in their shops; for he that tends well his shop, and hath an alluring wife with a graceful 'what d'ye lack?' shall be sure to have good doings, and good doings is that that crowns so many citizens with the horns of abundance" (II.i.2-6).35 Doll, in The</page><page sequence="13">DOUGLAS BRUSTER Book of Sir Thomas More (1595), rebukes the presumption of Francis de Barde with the following speech: "Compel me, ye dog's face! thou thinkst thou hast the goldsmith's wife in hand, whom thou enticedst from her husband with all his plate, and when thou turndst her home to him again, madste him, like an ass, pay for his wife's board" (I.i.11-16).36 Security, the Usurer of Eastward Ho!, attributes cuckoldry to his profession in a song: O Master Touchstone, My heart is full of woe! Alas, I am a Cuckold; And why should it be so? Because I was a usurer And bawd, as all you know. (V.v. 133-38)37 Jonson echoes what seems to have been his own conceit in his fifty-seventh Epigram, "On Bawds, and Usurers": "If, as their ends, their fruits were so, the same, / Bawdry, and usury were one kind of game."38 If, as Jonson argues, money and sexuality have the same ends, then patient servility is required of the retailer as well as the wholesaler, for patience produces profit. 4. The Covenant of the Horn If the role of cuckoldry as an economic metaphor in the drama of Renaissance London derived in part from the social gendering of labor, so too did cuckoldry operate in what one might call a religious context, as both an emblem of original sin and as a ritual of attaining faith. The "faith" referred to above in conjunction with the uncertainty of capitalistic investment found its parallel in the evolution of a Protestant, mercantile covenant. The locus classicus of this labor/religion conjunction in Western culture comes, of course, in the book of Genesis with God's angry reaction to Adam and Eve's first disobedience, the fruit thereof being the beginnings of work: "In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, til thou return to the earth: for out of it wast thou taken, because thou art dust, and to dust shalt thou return" (3:19). Heywood might have recalled this passage when, in The Brazen Age (1611), his Mars seduces Venus by saying: Come: shall we now, whilst Vulcan plies his forge Sweats at his Anvil, chokes himself with dust, And labours at his bellows, kiss and toy?39 207</page><page sequence="14">208 CUCKOLDRY ANDC A P T A L IN DR A M A Antagonistic to unrestrained eroticism, toil derives from the sins of knowledge and sexuality. Vulcan is cuckolded because he labors, and labors because he is cuckolded. Dramatic cuckoldry foregrounded the links between paternalism, faith, and the economic, especially in its manifestation as wittolry-that is, where the cuckold is aware of and content with his lot, mari cocu et complaisant. As the servant Wages in Cupid's Whirligig (1607) says of Sir Timothy Troublesome, "I see he would willingly prove an accessory to the stealing of his own goods."40 Wittols are not only rightly certain of their cuckoldry, but indeed content with it. Most often the wittol endures this relationship for economic reasons.41 Freevil, in Marston's The Dutch Courtesan (1604), describes the logic of this relationship in recounting a tavern transaction: "The drawer, for female private- ness' sake, is nodded out, who, knowing that whosoever will hit the mark of profit must, like those that shoot in stone-bows, wink with one eye, grows blind o' the right side and departs" (I.i.19-22).42 I have mentioned above that marriage was frequently portrayed as an institution which committed the husband to a life of servitude. Money was also described as this kind of servant, the "pale and common drudge / 'Tween man and men," as Bassanio calls silver during the Casket Choice in The Merchant of Venice (III.ii.103-104). The economic often drew its literary formulation from the familial and domestic. Reciprocally, cuckoldry acted as a kind of metonymic double for the cash marketplace, a symbol that, like money, tended to eradicate the distance and difference between the sexual and economic terms. Such an eradication, then as now, necessitated a mystificatory mythology. In delineating the social construction of this mythology, the dramatists of Renaissance London located cuckoldry's economic force within the religio- erotic bases of wittolry. Here I offer a representative passage from Middleton's A Chaste Maid in Cheapside (1611), where the householding "husband" Allwit (a transposition of "Witall") celebrates his own cuckoldry. Alerted that Sir Walter Whorehound, his wife's lover and his provider, has come to town, Allwit gives vent to an extended encomium: The founder's come to town: I am like a man Finding a table furnish'd to his hand, As mine is still to me, prays for the founder,- 'Bless the right worshipful the good founder's life.'</page><page sequence="15">DOUGALAS BRUSTER I thank him, 'has maintain'd my house this ten years, Not only keeps my wife, but a keeps me And all my family: I am at his table; He gets me all my children, and pays the nurse Monthly or weekly; puts me to nothing, Rent, nor church-duties, not so much as the scavenger: The happiest state that ever man was born to! I walk out in a morning; come to breakfast, Find excellent cheer; a good fire in winter; 0, two miraculous blessings! 'Tis the knight Hath took that labour all out of my hands: I may sit still and play; he's jealous for me, Watches her steps, sets spies; I live at ease, He has both the cost and torment: when the strings Of his heart frets, I feed, laugh, or sing: [Sings] La dildo, dildo la dildo, la dildo dildo de dildo. (I.ii. 11-56)43 Allwit's speech stands as a dramatic thesaurus of the Renaissance theater's commercial mythology, a mythology centering upon the horn of plenty. He appears to revel in the material accommodation of the wittol relationship. The "livestock" he keeps-"she's even upon the point of grunting"; "My wife's as great as she can wallow"-ensures that he is kept like livestock himself: "[he] not only keeps my wife, but a keeps me." Note the passage's relation to the biblical aspect of cuckoldry discussed earlier. It contains, throughout, a strong resemblance to the phrasing and themes of the Psalms. The King James version of the twenty-third Psalm's fifth verse-"Thou preparest a table before me"-seems to have provided Middleton with a model for his first two lines.44 Allwit's choice of individual words is no less suggestive, balancing out "hell" and "torments" with "paradise" (in the lacuna) and "miraculous blessings." "Jealous" as a word and a concept seems to dominate the passage. Displacing his jealousy onto a strong paternal godhead who provides material comforts and numerous offspring, Allwit derives comfort from a preoedipal freedom of servitude. It is no great extension of analysis to trace in this relationship a parody of the Hebrews' covenant with Jehovah. It is also easy to see the bearing of this passage on the historical theories of Weber and Tawney, both of whom drew strong connections between religious structures, early capitalism, and the rise of the 209</page><page sequence="16">210 CUCKOLDRY AND CAPITAL IN DRAMA bourgeois individual.45 Yet the preceding remarks on cuckoldry would seem to indicate that it was the paternalistic-and not, as Weber argues, the ascetic-nature of religion that the Renaissance associated with commerce. Also meaningful here is the fact that the father-founder, a knight of the countryside, is "come to town," that is, makes the rural to urban passage evidenced (and reversed) in so many of the cuckold stories. Allwit brags that this father-founder "took that labour all out of my hands: / I may sit still and play; he's jealous for me." "That labor," clearly, is the labor of intercourse: as house "hus- band" Allwit would rather be one of his wife's children than her spouse. He finishes the speech with a bawdy refrain celebrating the phallus: "La dildo, dildo la dildo, la dildo dildo de dildo." Suited to the infantile state to which he has regressed, the displaced "dil- do" stands highly similar-in terms of mythological symbolization -to the cuckold's horn. As Coppelia Kahn points out, "Regarded endopsychically, from the cuckold's point of view, horns are a defense formed through denial, compensation, and upward dis- placement."46 Here, I would argue, Allwit's "dildo" functions as a transitional object in an erotic project pointed back to the mother, rather than away from her. In this way the cuckold's horn, used in an attempt to deny active female participation in the literary scenarios of nascent capitalism, makes manifest the overwhelming importance of the myth of female fertility underlying the fictive rhetoric of London's market. London's drama seized upon the cuckold myth as a dialectical metaphor capable of reconciling-however uneasily-evolving tensions between country and city, production and reproduction, female and male. As is evident in play after play, the cuckold's patience translated readily into images of commercial investment. Attempting to associate fertility with the bounty of a paternalistic deity, the dramatists of Renaissance London saw cuckoldry as not only a natural but perhaps the natural collective metaphor with which to gloss a thematics of nascent capitalism. An enormous sculptured transitional object representing the social erotics of economic mythology, the symbolic horn of plenty at Cuckold's Haven appears to have functioned as a marker of historical transition as well, providing the playwrights in the first decade of James's rule with an element of topographical meaning that, already carved into the folklore of the city's immediate environs, could be inscribed as well in the popular urban imagination.</page><page sequence="17">DOUGLAS BRUSTER The myth of cuckoldry came to form an indispensable part of the London theaters' rhetoric of social and economic relationships, a cultural grammar which, as I have indicated, developed rapidly during the late Elizabethan and early Jacobean period. As London increasingly came to resemble a nation in miniature, confident in its ostensible self-sufficiency, it ultimately required less of the countryside by way of interpretive mythology. Hence the "con- fusion" wrought by Time in Taylor's account, hence the demise of the "monumental memorable Horn." The myth of cuckoldry, however, continued to serve England's chief city as a powerful economic trope. London so incorporated and institutionalized the cuckold myth, in fact, that throughout a large part of the eighteenth century the play regularly produced on Lord Mayor's day-the day when London dutifully celebrated its own civil and commercial splendor-was Edward Ravenscroft's The London Cuckolds (1681).47 And, according to New Remarks of London, collected by the Company of Parish Clerks and published in 1732, early eighteenth-century London also boasted both a "Cuckold's Court" and "Cuckold's Alley."48 The "passing" of Cuckold's Haven decried by Taylor can be construed, then, not so much as an indication that cuckoldry had lost its symbolic potency for the English Renaissance, but rather as evidence of the fact that, by 1623, London had so assimilated the myth into its literary vocabulary that actual, physical testament-the pole with its animal horns-became unnecessary. 211</page><page sequence="18">212 CUCKOLDRY AND CAPITAL IN DRAMA NOTES '"The same day [15 May 1562] was set up at the cuckold haven a great May-pole by butchers and fisher-men, full of horns; and they made great cheer."
