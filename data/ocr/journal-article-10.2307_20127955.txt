<plain_text><page sequence="1">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS* AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY Vol. 20, No. 1, January 1983 A Formal Analysis of the Ontological Argument, GARRELL POTTINGER This paper presents a version of the ontological argument which is demonstrably valid, does not beg the question in any obvious way, and has premises which are not prima facie implausible. The argument in question is arrived at via an analysis involving the following steps. (1) A statement of Anselm's argument is introduced, and it is argued that this argument cannot be formalized naturally in classical predicate logic with identity because that system presupposes that all singular terms have denotations and because "exists" cannot be symbolized by means of a predicate letter in that system. (2) Free logic is introduced in order to overcome these difficulties, and it is shown that the premises of the re sulting symbolization do not imply the conclusion. (3) In order to give Anselm a fair run for his money, modal operators are added to free logic so that it is possible to analyze what it means to say that God is a being than which none greater can be conceived. (4) It is shown that the re sulting version of Anselm's argument is invalid of free S5 (without the Barcan formula and its converse). (5) But addition of a premise which says that it is possible that God exists yields a valid argument with the conclusion that His existence is necessary. It does not seem possible to determine whether the additional premise is true, but the other premises are very plausible. Consequently, it seems we must say that God's ex istence is either necessary or impossible, but we can't tell which alter native is the correct one.

Copyright ? 1983 by the Review of Metaphysics</page><page sequence="2">962 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS incompatible with any view which claims or entails that created or con tingent objects, in addition to being products of God, are aspects of God. Hence, allowing for an entirely proper sense in which God (if existent) is "immanent" in creation thus indwelling in us?one need only consider the centrality of the notion of the Holy Ghost in Christianity and that of the Shekinah (or "Divine Presence") in Judaism?TTM gives every indication of being wedded to the view that God is metaphysically distinct from His creation since none of God's creatures can properly be said to dwell in God: in short, TTM maintains that God is Wholly Other than His creation. This places each of us in what the author calls Metaphysical Hell. However, he argues that there is strong or sufficient reason for holding that TTM entails that every item within the domain of God's creation is an aspect of God, and, accordingly, that TTM itself suffices to deliver each of us from Metaphysical Hell. The Pleasures of Tragedy, SUSAN L. FEAGIN Why do we receive pleasure from tragedy? Tragedy provides un pleasant direct responses (responses to the qualities and content of an artwork), but our meta-responses (responses to direct responses) are plea surable: we feel satisfaction in recognizing we care about the welfare of other human beings. That tragedy is a greater art-form than comedy is due to our pleasures deriving from feelings of sympathy which are the basis for morality, and essential to the maintenance of human society. Aesthetically sensitive persons may be moral brutes because their sym pathies are overcome by self-interest; morally exemplary persons may be aesthetically insensitive if they lack sufficient imagination to appreciate the artistic medium. Pleasurable meta-responses are appropriate to fic tion (and not real life) because no one really suffers, so continued sympathy is idle, allowing one to reflect on the sympathy previously felt. The Evidentialist Objection, JONATHAN L. KVANVIG The evidentialist objection claims that it is irrational to believe that God exists since (i) it is rational to believe p iff there is sufficient evidence for p, and (ii) there is not sufficient evidence for p. The author attempts to undermine this argument in two ways. First, he argues that the first premise is false by considering Pascalian possible worlds in which be lieving that God exists is entailed by its being reasonable to act as if God exists. And second, he argues that the second premise is false by de fending a sufficient condition for having an epistemically warranted belief. Since the second premise is defended by the failure of natural theology, part of the author's task is to argue that the epistemological views re quiring the success of natural theology are false. Thus, he concludes that the premises of the objection are false, and that the conclusion itself is false.</page><page sequence="3">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 963 Wickedness, RONALD D. MILO In this paper the author considers two different ways of conceiving of wickedness. According to the conception of wickedness as perverse wickedness, the agent of a wicked act does not himself believe that acts of this sort are wrong but believes instead that such acts are right (either required or, at least, permissible). The wrongdoing results from his hav ing accepted a bad (perverse) moral principle. According to the concep tion of wickedness as preferential wickedness, the agent of a wicked act believes that what he does is wrong but does it nevertheless, not because he has a weak will but because he prefers the realization of some other end to the avoidance of moral wrongdoing. The author argues that this latter conception of wickedness more adequately reflects the way in which we ordinarily conceive of wickedness, and he argues that the other con ception of wickedness faces insuperable difficulties when given a cogni tivist interpretation and yields unacceptable consequences when given a noncognitivist interpretation. Recent Work on Hume, DAVID C. YALDEN-THOMSON Between 1869-79 about 45 publications on Hume appeared and roughly the same number from 1919-29; Hall's bibliography lists over 1000 items from 1969-79. This growth is attributable partly to increased interest, stemming from Kemp Smith's work, partly to the baleful influ ence of the "publish or perish" doctrine. The most significant publications in various categories are discussed. Two books which mark substantial advances have appeared: Hume's Philosophical Politics by Duncan Forbes, and J. C. A. Gaskin's Hume's Philosophy of Religion. An enormous amount of writing has appeared on his epistemology, much of which were better not published. There is still a notable lack of exegetical agreement and the disparities in interpretation of some passages are remarkable. The Metaphilosophy of Commonsense, EDWARD H. MADDEN Implicit in the Scottish tradition is a metaphilosophy of common sense which deserves as much attention as that recently given to Scottish presentative realism and agent causality. The author articulates this metaphilosophy by a) sketching a systematic metaphilosophy of com monsense, b) considering to what extent Thomas Reid fits this pattern, and c) deciding to what extent Asa Mahan, one of the ablest of the American realists, fits it. The result is a characterization of a coherent Scottish metaphilosophy still worthy of consideration. The author also explores the question whether the metaphilosophy that emerges from b) and c) is part of an ongoing tradition. It has been suggested that there are important similarities between the Scottish view and G. E. Moore's concept of analysis. While the author agrees that there are analogies,</page><page sequence="4">964 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS he stresses the disanalogies as more enlightening about the nature of both. On Conscience, LARRY MAY The author leaves to others the task of explaining how conscience arises, and follows C. D. Broad's suggestions in search of a phenomeno logical understanding of the conscience. He critically considers and ex pands the concept of conscience described by Socrates and most recently by Hannah Arendt. First, one comes to realize that a certain act is wrong. Second, one judges that performing that act will produce disharmony within oneself when one later examines one's conduct. Thirdly, one is motivated not to perform a given action because of the internal conflict within oneself that will result. The author attempts to render this ac count more plausible in light of contemporary moral theory by arguing: a) that the criteria of Tightness and wrongness may vary in a given person's conscience; b) that the so-called "authority" of conscience is ex perienced as subjective; c) that the motivation of conscience is egoistical, and d) that the consequence of conscience's activity is that, for some, benevolence and self-interest merge, making the function of conscience like that of the virtues. Dancing to the Antimony: Yet Another Proposal for a Transcendental Idealism, CARL J. POSY AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY Vol. 20, No. 2, April 1983 Recent Work on the Concept of Happiness, TIBOR R. MACHAN and DOUGLAS DEN UYL The first part of this project deals with the more recent historical discussions of the topic, most of which focus on the views of Aristotle and J. S. Mill. These two authors turn out to be the focus of attention of most writers who wish to consider the major historical reflections on happiness, ones that have shaped our thinking on the topic. The second part of this project deals with contemporary original thinking about happiness. Yet here, too, the major themes on the topic tend to hark back to either the Aristotelian or the Millian line of analysis. In this section various pu tative components of happiness or philosophical topics and methods re lated to understanding happiness are discussed one by one. The paper concludes with some reflections of the authors about the merits of a eu daimonistic conception of happiness.</page><page sequence="5">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 965 Self-Reference and Philosophy, CARL R. KORDIG Self-referential theories include themselves in their own subject matters. Self-referentially inconsistent theories imply their own nega tions, necessarily are not true, and are, therefore, untenable. It is here demonstrated that Salmon's account of factual content; the so-called Quine-Duhem thesis (which Duhem never held in its extended form); Quine's ontological relativity; Toulmin's evolutionary epistemology; Toul min's, Quine's and Popper's theories of rationality; and the claims that not everything has an explanation and cause; are each self-referentially inconsistent and, hence, should be abandoned. Indeed, assuming that these theses have a truth value at all since they result in self-referential inconsistency, their denials are self-validating, and, hence, necessarily true. That is, the following are conclusions. Analytic statements have the most general, not no, factual content. Necessarily, some hypotheses are immune to revision. Necessarily, some ontology is absolute. There are invariant meta-scientific truths. Rationality requires criticism and content. Necessarily, everything has an explanation and cause. Neces sarily God exists. The author's philosophy of science in The Justification of Scientific Change requires a neutral, consistent meta-language to de scribe first (object) and second (regulative standard) level invariance be tween two or more scientific theories. It is not self-referentially incon sistent. For it claims neither to be relative to the language in which it is expressed, nor relative to a "background" theory, nor does it claim continuously to evolve, nor does it exclude concepts, beliefs, and their relations from rationality and apply it only to one's readiness to modify them. It is absolute. An Assessment of Emotion, JEROME A. SHAFFER The author assesses the role that emotional states play in our lives, taking an emotional state to be a complex of physiological processes (e.g., rapid heartbeat) and sensations (e.g., a sinking feeling), caused by a com plex of beliefs and desires. He argues that it is not emotion itself but only the belief/desire complex for which ethical and rational assessment is appropriate. Furthermore, since the belief/desire complex is necessary and sufficient for action, emotions are superfluous for action. Finally, as to whether emotion is a good or a bad thing, nothing in general can be said but only that in some cases it is and in some cases it is not, depending upon a host of variable factors. Because of the high repute in which love is widely held, that emotion is considered in some detail and it, like the other emotions, is seen to have no general claim to value in our lives. Do Animals Propositionally Know? Do They Propositionally Believe?, JOHN 0. NELSON Through an examination of the deep grammar of our talk regarding brute animals the author attempts to show that, contrary to widespread</page><page sequence="6">966 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS philosophical opinion, brute animals do not propositionally believe but they do propositionally know. On the basis of this conclusion, which argues that propositional knowing is a more primitive phenomenon than propositional believing, he maintains, among other things, that instead of propositional knowing being defined in terms of propositional believing, as is commonly done, propositional believing should be defined in terms of propositional knowing. Some consequences of doing so are then pointed out. Ability and Freedom, PAVEL TICHY and GRAHAM ODDIE The aim of the paper is to explicate the two notions in the title. It is argued that for an agent X to be able do to action A, there must exist a strategy such that X does A in every possible future in which he follows that strategy. The mere existence of such a strategy is sufficient for the opportunity sense of "can." In the more frequent sense of the word, X can do A if he is disposed to react to his own intention to do A by following such a strategy. X is free with respect to A if he can do A and can do non-A Knowledge and its Consequences, SCOTT SHUGER It has been recently argued by Fred Dretske that combining the very natural "relevant alternatives" view of knowledge with a very plausible construal of its growth via deduction, yields skepticism. Dretske's re sponse is to give up the account of deductive knowledge. In examining this argument, the author shows that a response by Gail Stine is unsound but that Dretske's view is also, because it relies on a mistaken theory of evidence. Once the correct principle of evidence is identified, the way is clear to embrace the relevant alternatives view of knowledge without being a skeptic. Trying, MICHAEL CORRADO It is one thing to say what it means to try, and another to say what we take as evidence that someone has tried. This paper is about the problems that arise in the course of saying what we take as evidence that someone has tried. The author assumes that what a person tries to do will be evidence for his mental states, including his intentions, and not the other way around, so that knowledge about his intentions cannot be used as evidence for what he is trying to do. The object is therefore to construct a criterion for trying without mention of mental states, includ ing intentions. Positive and Negative Relevance, JONATHAN BENNETT There has been a debate about whether the difference between "It came about because he did A" and "It came about because he did not do</page><page sequence="7">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 967 B" carries any moral weight in itself, with some writers contending that it always does and others that it never does. This paper explores the possibility that it sometimes does and sometimes doesn't. The only con tentful suggestion that has been made along these lines, so far, is that sometimes the difference in question makes a difference to whether or not a right has been infringed, the underlying assumption being that the con cept of a moral right?or the truth about moral rights?is somehow a positive/negative asymmetrical. Even if that assumption is correct, how ever, so that the difference between "because he did" and "because he didn't" may make the difference between "He infringed a right" and "He didn't infringe a right", the following is possible: Corresponding to any right-infringement there is a possible bit of conduct which differs from the right-infringement only in being negative instead of positive (i.e. in being a case of "because he didn't" rather than of "because he did") which, although it is not a right-infringement, is every bit as bad as a right infringement. No arguments have been produced to rule out that pos sibility. Akratic Believers, AMELIE RORTY AUSTRALASIAN JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY Vol. 61, No. 2, June 1983 The Logic of Privileged Access, J. J. MACINTOSH What is privileged access? In this paper eight basic possibilities in terms of justification and belief are considered. Using 'Ba' for "a believes that a," and 'Ja' for "conditions are such as to justify a belief by a that a," the eight possibilities, quantified and modalized, and with the range of the variables suitably restricted, are "p ?&gt; Bp", "Bp ?&gt; p", "p ?+ Jp", "Jp ? p", "Bp ? Jp", "Jp ? Bp", "Bp ? ~J~p", "~J~p ? Bp". (Con junctions of these yield the relevant knowledge claims.) An anomalous extra possibility is also considered. An argument, based on formal con siderations is offered to show that the first two must be false. Further arguments show that, minimally, the remaining possibilities cannot all be conjointly true (though of course they may be conjointly false). Jackson, Criteria, and Ontological Commitment, J. L. MOSLEY The author offers two major objections to Frank Jackson's discussion of ontological commitment in Philosophy (July 1980). (1) The notion of ontological commitment rests on a semantic theory which demands ex isting referents for referential terms. Jackson's criterion of ontological commitment, which rests on what the speaker assents to in the metalan guage, can only function as a criterion of belief. It cannot function to</page><page sequence="8">968 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS distinguish those sentences to which the above semantic theory applies with a consequent unintended ontology. (2) There is an ambiguity in Quine's writings concerning the relationship between a canonical para phrase, S', and the ordinary sentence, S, which it paraphrases. Jackson assumes S' reveals something about S, e.g., S's logical structure or its ontological commitments. The author argues there is good reason to believe S' reveals nothing about S, but is a mere substitute for S. Rather than purging S of commitments, S' simply provides an ontologically safe alternative to S. Do Animals Have an Interest in Life?, LAWRENCE E. JOHNSON Does killing an animal?as distinguished from causing it pain?vi olate its interest? Does so killing a human violate his/her interests? The author maintains that the case that it violates the animal's interests is as strong as the case that it violates the human's interests. It is argued, in particular, that preference-utilitarianism does not provide an adequate defense of the claim that only humans have an interest in life. The paper has particular application to Peter Singer's writings on the subject. Contingent Non-Identity, TOOMAS KARMO Although all identities are necessary, some non-identities seem con tingent. Consider the (actually distinct) twins A and B: there is perhaps a possible world in which an ovum does not split early in pregnancy, and in which A and B are one and the same human being. The obvious strat egies for deducing the necessity of non-identities from the necessity of identities seem to rely on the questionable assumption that if a certain world is possible from the point of view of the actual world, then the actual world is, in turn, possible from its point of view.

LEWIS Karmo on Contingent Non-Identity, I. L. HUMBERSTONE</page><page sequence="9">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 969 INTERNATIONAL PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY Vol. 22, No. 3, September 1982 Rahner and Hartshorne on Divine Immutability, J. NORMAN KING Contemporary theologians of diverse backgrounds are making sig nificant attempts to reinterpret the doctrine of divine immutability. At issue is a fundamental dissatisfaction with a conception of God whose absolute immutability renders him totally unaffected by the world. The article compares and contrasts the reinterpretations of divine immuta bility in the process philosophy of Charles Hartshorne and the transcen dental theology of Karl Rahner. Both define God as, in some sense, dipolar and dynamic, rather than as statically monopolar and solely immutable, and yet there are important differences in their teachings. For Hart shorne the divine polarity is constituted by the God-world relationship, while for Rahner it is situated within the divinity itself and reflected in the God-world relationship. Reflections on Dialectic in Plato and Hegel, CHARLES GRISWOLD In the first section of this paper the author outlines the various senses of "dialectic" in Plato and examines Hegel's comments and criticisms of them. He argues that the criticisms are based on questionable but re vealing assumptions. He then argues that dialectic qua "dialogue" is fundamental for Plato and shows how Plato supplies a?necessarily? indirect defense of it against the "systematic" objections of a Hegelian. Platonic irony and rhetoric are part of this defense; they thus take on, along with the dialogue form, a philosophical significance (a status Hegel denies to them). All of this is compared to Hegel's notion of philosophy as dialectic qua system, self-motion of the Concept, and (historically) progressive development towards "wisdom." In the second section of the paper the author offers several explanations for the absence, in Plato, of a philosophical dialogue between mature philosophers (given some of the author's remarks in the first section, one would expect Plato to have writ ten such a dialogue). Objectivity, Alienation and Reflection, JAMES L. MARSH The article argues that an illegitimate confusion of objectification with alienation in phenomenology can be avoided by distinguishing among seven kinds of objectification: perceptual, conceptual, factual, experiential, degrading, thematic, and normative. When these distinctions are made,</page><page sequence="10">970 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS Jasper's critique of self-knowledge as objectification, Sartre's discussion of the look, and the later Heidegger's rejection of a conceptual, thematic knowledge of being can be said to rest upon an illegitimate confusion between kinds of objectification. The article is divided into three parts: a description of the kinds of objectification, a discussion of the interre lationships between kinds, and the implications of my analysis for self knowledge, knowledge of other persons, and knowledge of being. The result is a limited, chastened phenomenological rehabilitation of objec tification, avoiding the extremes of absolute knowledge and a naive re jection of the conceptual. Modernity as the Transformation of Truth into Meaning, ALDO TASSI What characterizes the "modern" view of things is the fundamental belief that things are to be dealt with only in terms of their reference to human projects. This stands in marked contrast to the belief which con stitutes the premodern view; namely, that things possess a nature of their own which establishes the terms in which man is to deal with them. The transition from the latter to the former is marked by a shift from a concern for truth to a concern for meaning. The ideal of doing justice to things on their own terms is replaced by the ideal of achieving coherence with regard to the terms to which we (in our projects) subject things. The article discusses how Hume and Kant play a decisive role in this transition. JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY Vol. 80, No. 1, January 1983 Is Object Relations Theory Better Founded Than Orthodox Psychoanalysis? A Reply to Jane Flax, ADOLF GR?NBAUM It is argued that, insofar as the neo-revisionist object relations ver sion of psychoanalysis and also Kohutian self-psychology do earn the label "psychoanalytic," their clinical credentials are just as weak as those of orthodox Freudian theory. Jane Flax's objections to the author's thesis are shown to be both exegetically and philosophically untutored. The Concept of a Moral Right and Its Function, RICHARD BRANDT Liberty and Social Choice, AMARTYA SEN</page><page sequence="11">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 971 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY Vol. 80, No. 2, February 1983 DummeWs Anti-Realism, MICHAEL DEVITT Dummett's argument against realism about the physical world rests on three premises: (A) the identification of the realism dispute with a dispute about truth conditions; (B) the identification of the latter dispute with one about the competent speaker's understanding; and (C) the claim that this understanding is verificationist. The author argues that Dum mett gives (A) little support and that it is false: no doctrine of truth is constitutive of the ontological issue of realism. Dummett conflates two versions of (B). One is trivial, but the other is based on the popular and, it is argued, false assumption that competence consists in knowledge of truth conditions. (C) depends on a behaviorist psychology, a positivist epistemology, and a description theory of reference, all of which are false. Finally, the author considers the general question of the relation of ver ificationism to realism claiming that the former can pose little threat to the latter. The Logic of Perceptual Reports: An Extensional Alternative to Situation Semantics, JAMES HIGGINBOTHAM Quine on Alternative Logics, ALAN BERGER JOURNAL OF THE HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY Vol. 20, No. 4, October 1982 Nietzsche's Influence on Pragmatic Humanism, GEORGE J. STACK An attempt is made to demonstrate that many aspects of Nietzsche's philosophy were assimilated by the movement of pragmatic humanism in England and the United States through the thought and writings of F. C. S. Schiller. It is contended that Schiller had the requisite linguistic, cultural, and intellectual background, as well as the historical opportunity, to absorb and slightly transform the central ideas of Nietzsche. It is shown that Schiller was familiar with the works of Nietzsche, that he overtly coopted some of his conceptions in his last essays. Detailed com parisons between Schiller's humanistic theory of knowledge and Nietzsche's critical epistemology are displayed and highly specific lines of influence</page><page sequence="12">972 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS between Nietzsche and Schiller are illustrated. F. C. S. Schiller's em phases, in his writings, on the process of "becoming" in actuality, the "human" or anthropomorphic nature of truth, the link between "truth" and value, the treatment of "axioms of postulates," and much more, are held to be derived from very specific arguments in the philosophy of Nietzsche. In sum, it is argued that, contrary to all previous claims, Nietzsche's critical, "pragmatic" analyses of truth and knowledge are not independent of pragmatic humanism, but were directly influential on the movement of thought via F. C. S. Schiller. Direct Realism and Visual Distortion: A Development of Arguments from Thomas Reid, SUSAN WELDON It is often assumed that a direct realist account of sight requires that objects appear to the visual observer to have the spatial qualities and relationships they really do have. In fact, however, there is no in consistency in claiming that objects appear to have a magnitude and figure different from their real magnitude and figure or that they appear to be in a space different from real space, while maintaining, as the direct realist does, that nothing is seen which is not a real quality or relationship of external objects. Thomas Reid proved that there is no such inconsistency when he developed a direct realist theory of vision according to which all objects appear distorted. Since this theory is a coherent direct realist theory (although incorrect), it follows that visual distortion in itself is not incompatible with direct realism. Russell, Frege, and the "Meaning" of the Theory of Descriptions (or): Did Russell Know His Frege?, R. K. PERKINS, JR. This paper defends Bertrand Russell against the charge that his ar gument in the Principia, to prove that " 'the author of Waverly' means nothing," equivocates on "means" as between sense and reference. It is argued that Russell, far from confusing sense and reference, had his own version of the distinction, but one which differed from Frege's in carefully calculated and important ways. For reasons connected with the puzzle concerning discourse about non-existent objects, Russell needed to recon strue the subject expressions of description sentences as essentially "in complete" predicative expressions. The charge of equivocation against Russell is met by construing "means" in his Principia argument as "names" in his special and peculiar sense. Pride and the Public Good: Thomas More's Use of Plato in "Utopia,"THOMAS I. WHITE Through a consideration of Utopia's formal structure, the connection between Thomas More's conceptions of pride and the public good, and the parallels between Utopia and Plato's moral and political dialogues, this</page><page sequence="13">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 973 essay tries to illuminate the reasons behind and the details of Thomas More's use of Plato. More draws extensively from Plato's writings?par ticularly the Laws?both in his theoretical discussion of how to advance the public good and in the practical suggestions for the defeat of pride in his island society. JOURNAL OF THE HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY Vol. 21, No. 1, January 1983 Aristotelian "Epagoge" in "Prior Analytics" 2. 21 and "Posterior Analytics" 1. 1, RICHARD D. MCKIRAHAN, JR. Troubled by occurrences of the words e-wayuyr) and eirayeiv at 67a23, 71a21, and 71a24, commentators have dismissed them as atypical and non technical uses. This paper examines the relevant passages and shows that the words refer to a person's coming to see that a given particular falls under a given universal which he already knows. A conception of eway yr) is presented which covers this situation as well as cases standardly labelled as tizay yi)?cases of coming to know universals for the first time. This wider conception is shown to satisfy Aristotle's definition of eirayuy?) and to account for puzzling features in his remarks on that subject. Hume's Skepticism about Inductive Inference, N. SCOTT ARNOLD The standard interpretation of Hume's most famous argument about inductive inference maintains that Hume reached the radical conclusion that beliefs arrived at by such inferences are, one and all, unreasonable or unjustified. The principal purpose of this essay is to argue that this interpretation is false and that Hume only intended to establish the more modest conclusion that the conclusions of such inferences neither are nor can be rendered certain relative to their observational premises. The interpretive argument is based on a close analysis of Hume's argument in book 1, part 3, section 6 of the Treatise. An attempt is made to locate this argument of Hume's in the larger context of his skeptical enterprise in the Treatise. In particular, it is shown that Hume (provisionally) ac cepted the epistemic legitimacy of inductive inference until late in part 4 of book 1. At that point, he does offer an (independent) argument for the radical skepticism commonly attributed to him. Sense, Reference, and Russell 's Theory of Descriptions, A. P. MARTINICH When Russell uses the word "meaning" in connection with the mean ing of names and descriptions, he equivocates between having it mean</page><page sequence="14">974 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS "names" and "has the sense of." This equivocation vitiates the force of his claim that descriptions mean nothing. Further, two different ren ditions of Russell's theory of descriptions can be distinguished. One of these renditions shows the influence of Frege; the other (and more familiar one) does not. Russell's views about sense are also related to Wittgen stein's views in his Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus and some work by J. L. Austin. There is also an irony in Russell's work: He begins by contrasting definite descriptions with names; but then he argues that there are no genuine proper names and that ordinary proper names are dis guised definite descriptions. Thus the original contrast is undercut. Kant on Self-Respect, STEPHEN J. MASSEY Kant has a far richer view of self-respect than is suggested by recent Kantian accounts. Although he believes that servility, the tendency to act as if one did not share equal basic rights with every other person, displays a lack of self-respect, the author argues that the principles Kant uses to reach this conclusion show that he holds the view that all im morality, all failure to treat others (and oneself) as ends and not simply as means, displays a lack of self-respect. Given the connections he draws between having self-respect, being an end-in-oneself, and having rights, Kant can provide an explanation for the conceptual claim that has dom inated much recent discussion of self-respect, i.e., that respecting oneself requires recognizing and properly valuing one's possession of equal basic rights. Samuel Pufendorf: Obligation as the Basis of the State, MICHAEL NITKIEWICZ Hobbes's attempt to conjoin the new mechanical science to political theory must be viewed as the decisive force in the development of early modern political thought. For Hobbes and Spinoza mechanistic principles provided scientific, self-evident laws for the construction of a rational political theory. Samuel Pufendorf (1632-94), however, finds these self evident principles neither in the mechanistic theory of nature nor in tra ditional divine theories of law but, as shown in the article, in the working legal system itself. Through his unique position on the status of law Pufendorf contributes to a methodology which tends to regard the study of law as an autonomous discipline and the laws themselves as sets of rules grounded in pure reason. Pufendorf was an important contributor to this new methodology, and in some ways, as shown, was bolder than Hobbes and Spinoza in insisting that law "be allowed to claim its place among the sciences which are called demonstrative." Descartes, Dreaming, and Professor Wilson, ERMANNO BENCIVENGA</page><page sequence="15">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 975 MIND Vol. 92, No. 365, January 1983 The Difference between Dreaming and Being Awake, J. F. M. HUNTER The paper addresses itself to the question whether, when we take real events to be happening in a dream, we are deceived by the verisi militude of the experience. Among the main points are first, that the person doing things and experiencing things in a dream is not our waking rational self, but a dream persona, who is always awake and so wrong if he concludes he is asleep and dreaming; who is not normally cast as being on the lookout for fakery; and who, if so cast, might well (it being a dream) make a decision for all the wrong reasons. Second, there being discon tinuities and other fantastic happenings in dreams that do not show us we are dreaming, we can hardly suppose that, but for the verisimilitude, we would not be taken in. To preserve the idea of being deceived, we have to say we can at least imagine dreams that are life-like in every detail, but doubts are raised as to what counts as doing this. THE MONIST Vol. 66, No. 1, January 1983 Variations, Good and Bad, on the Theme of Right Reason in Ethics, HENRY B. VEATCH Can right reason, properly understood, provide a justification for our moral duties? Modern deontological or Kantian type ethical theories generally argue that moral duties are duties to perform certain actions without reference to any end to be achieved. But rational action, i.e., action dictated by practical reason cannot be other than purposive action, i.e., action directed toward some end to be achieved. As such, deontology must fail in its attempt to answer the question, Why be moral at all? Turning to teleological theories, the author distinguishes so-called he donistic theories, those in which an end is good merely because it is de sired, from natural law theories, those in which the end is desired because it is objectively good. Because hedonistic teleological theories involve no more than purely prudential considerations of one's own interests, judg ments as to what ought to be done can only be rationally justified in terms of an objective end.</page><page sequence="16">976 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS THE NEW SCHOLASTICISM Vol. 57, No. 2, Spring 1983 Recovering the Resurrection, JAMES G. HANINK In John Perry's wide-ranging A Dialogue on Personal Identity and Immortality, the classical Christian doctrine of bodily resurrection is sim ply ignored. Indeed, even those sympathetic to the doctrine sometimes seem to be revising rather than defending it. This essay, after fully stating the classical doctrine, tries to show that (1) it satisfies a cogent theory of identity (developed by Baruch A. Brody) and that (2) rival ac counts of one's own survival after death do not. Augustine and Aquinas, chief sources of the doctrine, as well as Peter Geach, a current defender, insist that the numerical identity of the risen body with the body that dies demands their material continuity. After explicating and supporting their view, the essay concludes that the classical doctrine is logically co herent. Aquinas: Prayer to an Immutable God, JOHN F. X. KNASAS This paper effects a critical comparison between the classical theist, Thomas Aquinas, and the process theist, Lewis Ford, on the issue of prayer. For both prayer is an act of love to God by the rational creature. For Ford prayer is loving insofar as the creature contributes to the divine perfection. Prayer is our expression of feeling that is assumed by God to "flesh out his intellectual aridity." For Aquinas prayer takes a loving form in adoration which is a submission, or giving, of our wills to God. Yet Aquinas's view of prayer is more exalted and so can be more bold. Our free prayers of adoration are understood to be infallible effects of God's infinite causality which has as an apt secondary cause our prayers of petition. In short, for Aquinas prayer is the means by which we can obtain graces infallibly bringing us freely to love God no matter how difficult our circumstances. Aquinas's reduction of God's immutability to God's being infinite act makes his position intelligible. Ford's process understanding of God does not include infallible effects that are our free acts. Hence, his view of prayer pales in comparison to Aquinas's. Concerning the Intelligibility of "God is Timeless, " W. HASKER Possible criteria for intelligibility are considered, leading to the con clusion that the burden of proof falls on those who would argue that the doctrine of timelessness is unintelligible. The doctrine is then expounded, making clear the sense in which God is said to be timeless, and the im plications of this for various divine attributes. Various objections to the doctrine are examined; all those which have been clearly stated seem to</page><page sequence="17">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 977 be solvable. Thus it seems reasonable to conclude that the doctrine of divine timelessness is indeed intelligible. Investigations in the Grammar of Faith, JOHN W. CARLSON This article offers an account, in terms of ten interrelated proposi tions, of the philosophical approach to religion inspired by Wittgenstein? that of pursuing investigations in what is termed the "grammar" of faith. The author's ten propositions are as follows. (1) Investigations in gram mar constitute a distinctive philosophical approach to religion. (2) This approach can be presuppositionless vis-?-vis substantive and controversial issues. (3) Believers and non-believers can investigate the grammar of faith on an equal footing. (4) The adequacy of proposed accounts is to be judged in terms of the religious phenomena themselves. (5) These phenomena are subject to a measure of variability and development. (6) One can pursue, not complete and final accounts of the grammar of faith, yet ones which are general if provisional. (7) Agreement can in principle be expected concerning proposed accounts. (8) The results of grammatical investigations are formally neutral as regards religious concerns. (9) These results can nevertheless have considerable and varied significance. (10) Investigations in grammar enjoy a priority?although not necessarily a finality?among philosophical approaches to religion. Natural Theology and Methodology, BOWMAN L. CLARKE In this paper the author proposes a way of characterizing natural theology in terms of subject matter rather than the traditional "source of knowledge," that is, in terms of God's universal relations to all temporal individuals. The author suggests how this particular subject matter may be treated in terms of the contemporary logical notion of a formal lan guage system, and relates this technique to the natural theologies of St. Thomas and St. Anselm. Using other distinctions of contemporary logical theory, particularly, internal and external questions, the author suggests how certain questions concerning the adequacy of a particular natural theology may be handled. Scientific Realism and a Philosophy of Nature, J. M. HUBBARD In this article the author argues that scientific realism, on one of its best interpretations?that of Mary Hesse?implies a philosophy of nature. It does so because of its claim to be a realistic account of our knowledge of nature, for such an account must explain the growth of our knowledge. Scientific realism, then, and the growth of knowledge imply an indepen dent observation base, and a philosophy of nature is simply the elaboration of such a base. The first section sets the problem, with more detail than the author just gave and with reference to Hesse. Section two unpacks</page><page sequence="18">978 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS the important elements of scientific realism. The last section completes the argument to an independent observation base and the consequent notion of a philosophy of nature. Unity, Participation, and Wholes in a Key Text of Dionysius the Areopagite's "The Divine Names," WILLIAM J. CARROLL This paper demonstrates that a participation in unity, for Dionysius the Areopagite, encompasses three factors: beings that participate, a pro cess of participation and a participated perfection. Beings that partici pate or participants include bodies, souls, and intelligence (angels), which may have two sorts of participation: an ontological participation which makes a being be what it entitatively is and a noetic participation which enables some creatures (angels and souls) to increase their basic partic ipation in unity. The elucidation of the participation process itself is greatly aided by Proclus's notion of wholes. Dionysius states that the super-celestial lights participate in unity in an unmixed and super-celes tial way, whole throughout whole. Yet Dionysius himself gives no ex planation of their permeating one another as wholes. As a result of an analysis of Proclus's notion of wholes, however, the following distinction can be made. The whole-before-the-parts is the perfection as it is con tained in its cause, unity as it is contained in the Good. The whole-from the-parts is the perfection as it occurs in all living things as a whole, unity as it is in all unified things. The whole-in-the-parts is the perfection as it is participated in by a single participant, unity as it is participated in by a single unified thing. God as the Good is the source of all perfections yet is none of them. He contains these perfections as wholes-before-the parts but, in Himself, is beyond all such classifications. Through the participation of all things in His perfections, He is immanent in the world. In Himself, however, He transcends the world. NOUS Vol. 17, No. 2, May 1983 God and Possible Worlds: The Modal Problems of Evil, THEODORE GULESERIAN Using four principles common to several theories about possible worlds, it is argued that the necessary existence of a divine being that is essentially omnipotent, omniscient, and morally perfect is impossible. The central argument employs the premise that there are possible worlds that any divine being ought not to actualize (because of their evil contents). This premise is then defended on the grounds that the same sort of jus tification that we give for other modal statements that we accept can be given for modal statements which entail the premise. It is concluded that</page><page sequence="19">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 979 we must reject the guiding principle that gives rise to the traditional theistic concept, viz., that if a property P of an individual is an excellence of it and hence its having P is good, then its having P necessarily or essentially is better. Semantics for Mass Terms with Quantifiers, PETER ROEPER It is argued that the usual proposals for dealing with mass-quanti fication?All X is F? are inadequate when the predicate is complex or when multiple quantification is considered. Mass-quantification is shown to be a generalisation of ordinary (thing-) quantification in that the spe cialising assumption that the domain of quantification is atomic is not made. It is suggested that the semantic values of predicates are complete ideals of the Boolean algebra consisting of the quantity which is the do main of quantification and all its sub-quantities, while logical connectives are represented by operations on complete ideals. Knowledge of Meaning, GREGORY CURRIE and PETER EGGENBERGER This article defends the theory that the meaning of a sentence is given by its truth conditions. Some of Michael Dummett's arguments for a verificationist semantics are analyzed. It is argued that Dummett's verificationism depends upon a too narrow conception of speakers' knowl edge, and upon a methodologically unacceptable account of the relations between theoretical and observational components in a theory. Analyticity and Truth in all Possible Worlds, ALEX BLUM The paper explicates the logic of "analytic" in terms of truth of (or in) all possible worlds. An Atheistic Argument from the Improvability of the Universe, R. K. PERKINS, JR. The author attempts to rehabilitate a version of the old argument from evil so as to meet various objections including Plantinga's free will defense. The main idea is that the existence of God is incompatible, not with the existence of evil, but with the improvability of the universe, i.e., with the facts that this universe could have been better than it is and that such improvement could have been effected by an omnipotent, omniscient, omnibenevolent being. Is Acting Willing?, JEAN BEER BLUMENFELD</page><page sequence="20">980 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS Belief and Predication, F. CHRIS SWOYER Assenting to "Ought" Judgments, HARRY S. SILVERSTEIN THE PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY Vol. 33, No. 130, January 1983 Hegel on Property and Personality, DUDLEY KNOWLES For Hegel, property is an expression of will, an embodiment of per sonality. Hence a full understanding of property relations is to be achieved by locating our practices of appropriating, using and alienating objects within a philosophical analysis of self-determined action. The author attempts to promote such an understanding by giving a brief out line of elements of Locke's theory which suppose, but do not supply, con nections between the concepts of personality and property; by showing how standard elements of systems of property holding are interpreted in The Philosophy of Right using the notions of embodiment and expression; by offering an exposition of Hegel's theory of free action which makes sense of the application of these notions; by relating this theory to the account of labor in the Phenomenology of Spirit; and finally, by suggesting that the development of just such a theory will be crucial for a socialist philosophy. The Intelligibility of Massive Error, BRUCE VERMAZEN The author raises two objections to Donald Davidson's "omniscient interpreter" argument, which concludes that "massive error about the world is simply unintelligible" ("The Method of Truth in Metaphysics," Midwest Studies in Philosophy 2, [1977]: 244-254). First, since one can believe (or imagine, if omniscient) that one has false general beliefs with out being able to say which ones they are, attributing most of one's general beliefs to another may result (or one may imagine it resulting) in attrib uting many unidentified false ones to him; these, together with the iden tified false beliefs attributed, may sum to a preponderance of falsehood? "massive error"? despite the interpreter's omniscience. Second, the no tion of an omniscient interpreter should be problematic for Davidson, since omniscience seems to entail that there is a fact of the matter about what the interpreter's propositional attitudes are, and Davidson seems to hold that there is no such fact of the matter.</page><page sequence="21">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 981 Reply to Levin, JOHN ROBERTSON The author argues that Michael Levin's claim that one may have a right to a job chance is either unacceptably strong or too weak to be of interest: it entails either that an employer is morally obligated to fire an employee if a better qualified person claims his job (in which case it is too strong), or an employer is not morally obligated to appoint the best qualified candidate when a position is open (in which case it is too weak). Understanding Names, PETER CARRUTHERS The paper addresses the question whether proper names have sense. The author distinguishes two senses of "sense": (1) that which fixes speaker's reference; and (2) that a mutual knowledge of which underpins communication. In sense (1) the question is answered in the affirmative, in sense (2) in the negative. He then argues for a difference in the con ditions for mutual understanding in the use of proper names and predi cates: for communication in the use of a name mutual knowledge of ref erence is sufficient, but for communication in the use of a predicate at least mutual knowledge of logical equivalence is required. He then in dicates how his account might be developed to explain the behavior of proper names within indirect discourse. Rawls on Natural Inequality, MICHAEL GORR An important element in Rawls's "deep theory" is his claim that natural differences between persons require some form of "correction" on grounds of justice. In this paper the author argues that Rawls's defense of this thesis is inadequate and, furthermore, that there are reasons in ternal to his theory for rejecting it. Defining the Least Advantaged, ROY C. WEATHERFORD The thesis of this article is that John Rawls's conception of the least advantaged segment of society is evolving from a descriptive standard, based entirely on economic factors, to an evaluative view that emphasizes the reasons for social deprivation. This shift has the moral advantage of capturing the ordinary person's view that we should help those who are poor through no fault of their own, but the practical disadvantage of making it far more difficult to determine whose interests should properly be consulted when evaluating possible social changes. The earlier view is sketched out in A Theory of Justice (1970)? the later position appears in Rawls's much less well known Cambridge Review article, "A Kantian Conception of Equality" (1975). Two Worries about Mixing One's Labor, JEREMY WALDRON</page><page sequence="22">982 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW Vol. 92, No. 2, April 1983 Salmon on Artifact Origins and Lost Possibilities, WILLIAM R. CARTER If we follow Kripke's lead, we may say that run-of-the-assembly-line artifacts are such that their actual material origins are in some sense essential to them. But there is a potential snag. For it appears that a ship, say, might have been first constructed out of slightly different ma terials than those that were, in fact, employed in its (original) construc tion. The temptation is to adopt some sort of "threshold" approach to origin essentialism. But any threshold approach to Material Origin Es sentialism must be reconciled with the plain fact that identity across worlds is transitive. Nathan Salmon has proposed an ingenuous program for reconciliation. The author argues that Salmon's position is beset by serious difficulties. Aquinas on Sense-Perception, JOHN J. HALDANE In giving account of sense-perception Aquinas invokes the idea of the intentional reception of the sensible form of the object perceived, and contrasts this with the natural mode of reception; as when something acquires a physical property by being acted upon. The question arises: is the intentional mode immaterial? Two opposing interpretations are considered, and it is shown that both find support in Thomistic texts. This suggests a contradiction in Aquinas's account, which is traced to the attempt to construct a theory of concept acquisition in terms of the re ception of forms; and to provide a mechanism for singular reference via a sensory component. The extension of the former to sensation implies the presence there of universality; while the latter entails particularity. Fortunately, the doctrine of esse intentionale can be abandoned in respect of sensation leaving a coherent and philosophically plausible account of the nature of thought. The Real and Unrefuted Rights Thesis, LEON GALIS The author argues that the truth of Ronald Dworkin's normative rights thesis that there are in hard cases pre-existing legal rights which judges have a duty to enforce has yet to be adequately assessed. That is because the rights thesis that was roundly attacked by Dworkin's critics is not the thesis that Dworkin actually argued for. Once it becomes clear how Dworkin understands the rights thesis, then it can be seen to rest on much less controversial grounds than many critics have supposed. Moreover, the rights thesis properly understood does not fall to the only</page><page sequence="23">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 983 argument against and relevant to the truth of what critics mistakenly took to be the rights thesis. Two Distinctions in Goodness, CHRISTINE M. KORSGAARD PHILOSOPHY Vol. 58, No. 224, April 1983 Personal Identity and the Imagination, P. T. MACKENZIE The purpose of this paper is to argue that the search for the principle or criterion of personal identity is a search for the will-o'-the-wisp. The author begins by arguing that it is the nature of a physical object to endure for some time. As a result its retention of identity through time is not to be explained through talk about spatiotemporal series of time slices, momentary states, and the like. It needs no explanation. Just as the surface of a salami which is exposed when a salami is sliced, can only exist as a part of the salami, so a time slice or momentary state of an object, can only exist as a part of the object. The enduring physical object is logically prior to the momentary state. The same point can be made about persons. It is the nature of a person to exist for some time. A person cannot exist for an instant. It can be seen from this that personal identity is not to be explained by means of person stages or person time slices. The enduring person is logically prior to the person stages. On the basis of all this I go on to argue that such questions as "What makes a person at t2 identical with that person at tl?" are (logically) miscon ceived. As a result, even though facts about recollection and bodily iden tity may be useful in settling epistomological questions about personal identity?"I'm certain I was shopping at Safeway yesterday afternoon for I remember being there and a number of people saw me there," they are out of place in settling ontological questions about personal identity such as "What makes identical with myself of yesterday?" The only answer that can be given to this question is "Remaining the same person." And this is not so much an answer to this question as it is a rejection of it. Finally, the author goes on to consider certain puzzle questions which have recently been raised concerning personal identity and argues on the basis of the points already made, that the bewilderment engendered by these puzzles can be allayed. Causation and Change, WILLIAM CHARLTON Causal agents, causal action, and causal conditions are all called "causes." The first two seem to be confused both by Hume and R. Harr?. Causal action is a rendering inevitable if (1) the explanandum is a process and the action a going-on of that process, (2) the explanandum is the</page><page sequence="24">984 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS beginning of a process, the explanans the end of a preceding process, and the two are the same event. Criticism of Russell's reduction of becoming to being different at different times and of Davidson's dualism of changes and material objects. "A was /" and "A became /" are different forms of expression and predication corresponding to the difference between con ceiving and understanding. A's becoming / may be thought of as a process which goes on or as a going on of a process. In the first case it functions in our thought as a causal explanandum, in the second as a causal ex planans. Sexual Ontology and the Group Marriage, STEPHEN R. L. CLARK Families and other groups less than the State should be studied by political philosophers. One neglected example is the "group marriage." Are such groups really marriages! What are sexual relations like in such groups, and elsewhere? The author proposes that group marriages either end as clubs for liberal individualists seeking some security for children, loneliness and old age, or (if they are to be more like genuine marriages) return us to the social nexus of the primate horde, united by sorge rather than eros. Nuclear monogamy may be regarded as not wholly "natural," and our proper home a group of many ages and both sexes. Group mar riages, in an age of disintegrating social structures, may set us good ex amples, even if we do not wish to join one. Real Life, Art, and the Grammar of Feeling, OSWALD H?NFLING How can we feel emotions about fictional people? Normally it makes no sense to go on feeling sad, etc., when we find out that something did not really happen. A number of recent explanations are examined, in cluding (1) the fictional object "resembles" a real one; (2) it does not, but neither do the feelings; (3) we have suitable beliefs about the fictional object (e.g., the sufferings of Anna Karenina), and this explains our feel ings; (4) when absorbed in a work of fiction, our belief that it is fiction is "suspended." There is something right and wrong in each of these (and other) answers. The paper aims to explore them and not to "dispose" of the problem. Mill and Edwards on the Higher Pleasures, SUSAN L. FEAGIN Mill has explained his distinction between higher and lower pleasures a bit more extensively than many commentators have recognized, but mainly in the context of his writings on aesthetics and poetry which are</page><page sequence="25">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 985 not widely known among philosophers. Though the author argues that Mill does not want to describe the difference between how higher and lower pleasures feel (the way some have tried, e.g., Rem Edwards in Plea sures and Pains: A Theory of Qualitative Hedonism), Mill does provide a rationale for his distinction. This concerns how human beings can im prove themselves and their environment. Augustine and Wittgenstein on Language, PATRICK BEARSLEY Kenny has claimed that in the opening numbers of the Philosophical Investigations Wittgenstein not only gives a distorted picture of Augus tine's views, but also fails to see that Augustine's true opinions are in many respects similar to his own. However, in this paper it is argued that Wittgenstein did understand Augustine correctly. He was right in thinking that Augustine held a "naming" theory of meaning, but he was unfair in giving the impression that Augustine's views on language were simplistic and naive. (Augustine's De Magistro, which Wittgenstein does not seem to have known, contains a highly sophisticated and nuanced account of language and meaning.) An examination of the views of both philosophers on the place of ostensi?n in the learning of language and on other essential features in the use of language shows that the differences between the two philosophers are deep and irreconcilable. Philosophy and Philosophies, E. J. CRAIG This article is the edited script of three radio talks first broadcast in 1981. It argues for and explains the connection between the "technical" philosophy that forms the content of most university courses, and "Phi losophies" in the layman's sense?views of the nature and purpose of Man and the Universe. What the technical philosopher does (not always know ingly) is to fill out such a Weltanschauung with logical detail, thus trans forming a picture that appeals to the emotions into a theory that can also appeal to the intellect. This contention is illustrated by doctrines of Leib niz and Berkeley in relation to the dominant Philosophy of their time. In a final section, the author claims that there is just such a Philosophy hidden behind much philosophical work of the twentieth century, and suggests what it might be. Fearing Death, AM?LIE OKSENBERG RORTY Religion and Politics, GORDON GRAHAM</page><page sequence="26">986 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH Vol. 43, No. 1, September 1982 Miller on Wanting, Intending, and Being Willing, WAYNE A. DAVIS A. R. Miller has argued that intention does not entail desire on the grounds that "If a reason R is sufficient for showing that a given act is not intentional, then R is also capable of functioning to identify a relevant mitigating circumstance." The author points out that lack of desire is a mitigating circumstance. Miller also claims that there is no difference between wanting to do something and being willing to do it. The author points out three differences. He concludes by showing that there are many other reasons, besides the principle that intention entails desire, for believing that expected but unwanted consequences of intended acts are not themselves intended. Intention, Demonstration, and Reference, J. I. BIRO D. Kaplan's hint that in a case of ostensi?n the object intended to be demonstrated and the object actually demonstrated may fail to coincide is elaborated and defended against an objection brought by R. Bertolet. It is suggested that the phenomenon in question is by no means isolated or exotic, but one that illustrates a general feature of all reference and meaning, namely, that context is an independent factor in determining the content of utterances, a factor sometimes more powerful than the utterer's own intentions. Not Even Relatively Robust, MICHAEL WREEN In "Robust Relativism" Joseph Margolis claims that (1) interpretive judgments (critical interpretations), evaluative judgments (critical eval uations), and aesthetic judgments are not and cannot be either true or false; and that (2) interpretive, evaluative, and aesthetic judgments can, in principle, be plausible, implausible, probable, and so on. Margolis fur ther claims that this view, RR for short, is consistent and moderate and avoids skepticism. In "Not Even" it is argued that these latter claims are all false. (A) RR is inconsistent, since plausibility, implausibility, probability, and so on entail the possibility of truth or falsity. (B) RR is not moderate, since it requires rejecting many important critical claims and abandoning or revising (in an incomprehensible way) a large number of key critical concepts, including those of consistency, validity, belief, and judgment. (C) RR embraces skepticism, since knowledge entails truth. Finally, Margolis's possible replies to these charges are found to be un satisfactory, and it is urged that RR be rejected.</page><page sequence="27">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 987 Depiction and Description, ARTHUR C.

BARKER This paper proposes interpretations of the vexed notions of inten sionality and intentionality and then investigates their resulting inter relations. The notion of intentionality comes from Brentano, in connec tion with his view that it can help us to understand the mental. Setting aside Husserl's basic definition of intentionality as not quite in line with Brentano's explanatory purpose, this paper proposes that intentionality be defined in terms of inexistence and indeterminacy. It results that Brentano's thesis (that all and only mental phenomena are intentional) will not be strictly true. However, intentional descriptions will always be intensional, though not all intensional descriptions will be intentional. Knowledge as Doubly Anchored True Belief, LAWRENCE C. BECKER Some ambiguities in the verb "to know" are analyzed, and it is argued that "undefeatably justified true belief" is the meaning of most philo sophical interest with respect to specifying truth conditions for "S knows that p." Two general conditions for an adequate definition of "S knows that p" are discussed. Then a proposal for a quasi-causal theory of knowl edge is introduced and defended.</page><page sequence="28">988 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS History and Interpretation of the Text of Plato's Parmenides, ROBERT S. BRUMBAUGH The present comments and notes are more complete and accurate than the author's earlier articles, and supercede them. But for the pur poses of the present discussion, it has not seemed relevant to the main point to introduce a large number of minor detailed improvements item by item. More complete reports of collations and examinations of some of the Parmenides manuscripts are to be placed on file with the Yale University Plato Microfilm Project. Internalism and Self-Determination, GEORGE R. CARLSON As part of an attempt to distinguish two categories of explanatory reasons for action, the author articulates and defends a modified inter pretation of "internalism" which makes coherent the notion of a genu inely, seZ/-determined choice amongst fundamental conceptions of prac tical reason. It is argued that such choices are "nomologically irreduc ible" as is evidenced by the fact that although (contextually) unavoidable, they are nonetheless under-determined with respect to the background of generic "desire and purpose" within which they occur. Alternatively, to the extent that orthodox "externalism" subordinates reason to the field of externally determined "passions" or inclinations, it is rejected, in con clusion, as yielding an excessively reductive analysis of human agency. Necessary Order in the Primordial Nature of God in Whitehead, R. J. CONNELLY This paper first identifies briefly several interpretations of the nature of the general order of eternal objects in PNG. W. A. Christian describes the timeless ordering in terms of a "general scheme of relatedness," or "matrix," or "reservoir of potentiality." Others, like Hartshorne, intro duce the "continuum" concept. Unfortunately, none of the above terms has strict technical or categoreal meaning in Whitehead's metaphysics. The author tries to remedy this defect by utilizing the Whiteheadian notions of abstractive hierarchies and contrast. The author's interpre tation supports the idea that there is one fixed and necessary order of eternal objects in PNG. Aristotle's De Anima and Marx's Theory of Man, DAVID DEPEW It has long been recognized that Hegel's philosophical biology, in cluding some aspects of his anthropology, is an attempt to responsor Ar istotle's seminal conceptions in these areas. It has not often, however, been acknowledged that Marx's response to Hegel in the Economic and</page><page sequence="29">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 989 Philosophic Manuscripts of 18H, while radically attacking these biological and anthropological views, does not abandon the generally Aristotelian framework in which they are expressed, but rather attempts to deploy that framework in a new way. This essay is an attempt systematically to read the Manuscripts in the light of this hypothesis. It finds that while Hegel responsors Aristotle's idea that the nutritive-reproductive and sen sory "souls" serve the higher telos of theoretical knowing, Marx holds that the intellective and sensory functions do not leave behind the nutritive reproductive sphere, but rather make possible a distinctively human way of conducting those functions centered on free productive activity. Towards a Theory of Models in Physical Science, JOHN FORGE The purpose of this paper is to provide an analysis of the concept of model as it is applied in the physical sciences, and to show that this analysis is fruitful insofar as it can be used as an acceptable account of the role of models in physical explanation. A realist interpretation of theories is adopted as a point of departure. A distinction between theories and models is drawn on the basis of this interpretation. The relation between model and prototype is expressed in terms of the concepts of access and accessibility, and four conditions are proposed as an analysis of the concept of model. It is concluded that models are introduced when approximate methods are used. A Critique of Theistic Reductionisms, EDWARD H. HENDERSON Accounts of theistic faith according to which it does not involve re ferring to or believing in God as existing independently of the life of faith are instances of theistic reductionism. Theistic reductionism, in holding that "God" does not refer to a reality outside the life of believers, holds thereby that theism is not rightly to be regarded as true or false. Such accounts may be proposed or used as defenses of theistic faith. They "defend" faith insofar as they describe the form of life faith involves and show that the human and cultural functions it performs are valuable. Examining several reductionist accounts, ordered from weaker to stron ger, the author argues that they fail as defenses of theistic life and lan guage. Whereas the reductionist views claim to leave the practice of theism as it is, the author argues that in fact they imply a different form of life than the one theism actually is. Thus reductionist defenses of religious practice fail and fail precisely where they insist on treating God in some way other than as existing outside of religious life. From this the author infers that theism as it exists can only be defended in ways that include taking "God" as referring to a God who is real outside the life which recognizes him. The religious reductionists discussed include R. B. Braithwaite, P. F. Schmidt, Paul Holmer, Paul van Buren, Gordon Kaufman, and D. Z. Phillips.</page><page sequence="30">990 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS Two as an Odd Number: On Cumming On Shapiro on Heidegger on Van Gogh, NANCY J. HOLLAND This paper attempts to show that Robert Cumming's effort in a recent article to explain the work of Jacques Derrida to American philosophers fails to present an adequate account of Derrida's position because Cum ming does not take Derrida's philosophical views (in this case, his critique of Heidegger) seriously enough. By returning to the Heideggerian and Derridian texts, three main points become clear: first, that Cumming fails to present an alternative interpretation of Heidegger on which to base his criticisms of Derrida's reading; secondly, that Cumming's specific crit icisms of Derrida often fail because he engages the issues on a relatively superficial level; and, finally, that Cumming has not proven that Derrida's work does not present a substantial challenge to Heidegger's position. The author concludes that the task of explaining Derrida's work to American philosophers has yet to be accomplished. PHRONESIS Vol. 27, No. 3, 1982 Zeno's Arrow, Divisible Infinitesimals, and Chrysippus, MICHAEL J. WHITE This paper has two, rather distinct parts. Part I presents a reso lution of Zeno's arrow paradox (as formulated by J. Lear, Phronesis 26, 2, [1981]) using the conceptual equipment of nonstandard analysis. Ac cording to this resolution, the paradox involves the classical fallacy of equivocation. Lear's version of the paradox employs the two following premises: "(1) Anything that is occupying a space just its own size is at rest; (3) But in the present, the arrow is occupying a space just its own size." Nonstandard analysis admits, in addition to "strict equality" (=), a relation (~) which can be informally characterized as "not differing by any finite amount." It is argued that, in terms of nonstandard analysis, the phrase "just its own size" must be given the "strict equality" reading in order to make premise (1) true; but the interpretation of "the present" as any infinitesimal interval rather than as a temporal instant entails that the phrase must be given the other reading in order to make premise (3) true. Part II investigates the hypothesis that several puzzling doc trines concerning time, space, and motion attributed to the Stoic Chry sippus can be better understood by attributing to Chrysippus a concept of "divisible infinitesimals." Such a concept is reasonable only if the so called "Archimedes' axiom" is denied. A comparison of the statement of his axiom by Archimedes (a contemporary of Chrysippus) and Plu</page><page sequence="31">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 991 tarch's report of several Chrysippean doctrines suggests that it is possible that Chrysippus explicitly denied the axiom. PHRONESIS Vol. 28, No. 1, 1983 Why the Triangle has Two Right Angles "Kath'Hauto," J. E. TILES In an attempt to reach a better understanding of kath' hauto (in virtue of itself) predication in Aristotle's theory of demonstration, the question is raised, "In what sense does the theorem (often cited by Ar istotle) that the interior angles of a triangle equal two right angles state something which is true of a triangle kath' hauto?" It emerges that Ar istotle seems insufficiently aware of the difficulties of fitting this theorem into what he says about the role of belonging kath'hauto in demonstration. Nevertheless, materials are available for a solution to the difficulties, and if the text does not point directly to this solution, at least it does not strongly preclude it. Middle Platonism and the "Seventh Epistle, " HAROLD TARRANT It is important to determine not only when later authors first became aware of Plato's (?) Ep. VII, but also when they first knew the philo sophical digression (340b-345c), which is sometimes seen as a later ad dition. Early Middle Platonism (to about 150 A.D.), and Plutarch in par ticular, fail to take account of the digression in contexts where it would have been expected. They did, however, know the bulk of the Epistle. At a time when interpreters struggled with the problem of extracting Platonic doctrine from dialogues, it is odd that they did not seize upon the explicit statement of (allegedly) Platonic doctrine in Ep. VII. The Platonic editor Thrasyllus was about the last person with the opportunity to add material to Platonic texts (early saec. I, A.D.), and his text sup planted others in time. The doctrine of the digression is compatible with Platonic thought in the age of Thrasyllus. Intuitionism and Formalism: Zeno 's Definition of Geometry in a Fragment of L. Calvenus Taurus, JAAP MANSFELD The definition runs: "(geometry is) a fixed disposition which, in re lation to the demonstration of presentations, is irrefutable by argument." These "presentations" are the geometrical images in our minds. Early</page><page sequence="32">992 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS editors changed pros deixin ("in relation to the demonstration") into en prosdexei ("in the acceptance"), thus turning the definition of geometry into one of knowledge. But deixis, "deictic" or "anaphoric" demonstra tion, is a Stoic technical term. Zeno's definition of geometry qua science is impeccable from a Stoic point of view, since the Stoics, unlike the Pla tonists, did not believe the objects of mathematics to exist independently.
