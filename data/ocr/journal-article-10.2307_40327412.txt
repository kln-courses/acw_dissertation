Various early records have led writers to suppose that the double-outrigger was known in this area. In this paper the early records are carefully examined, and the conclusion is drawn that, with the possible exception of the Pelew Islanders, neither the Polynesians nor the Micronesians have ever had double-outriggers. Polynesian and Oceanic Elements in the Chimu and Inca Languages. By F. W. Christian. Journal of the Polynesian Society, XLI, 1932, 144-156. Because he finds that a couple of dozen words from certain South American languages are similar to Polynesian words the author of this paper concludes that race contact has taken place. It is impossible to take this conclusion seriously because no attempt has been made to show any similarity of grammatical structure. Note on Inscribed Tablets from Easter Island. By S. H. Ray. Man, XXXII, 1932, 192. A short paper on the interpretation of an inscribed tablet from Easter Island preserved in the Musée des Sacrés-Cœurs de Picpus, at Braine-le-Comte, Belgium. Mr. Ray compares some of the characters with the native text as collected and translated by the late Bishop Jaussen. As Mr. Ray points out, the tablet with its characters is a mnemonic device rather than an integrated piece of script. The article is accompanied by a full-page plate of the tablet. Maori Decorated Sinkers. By V. F. Fisher. Records of the Auckland Institute and Museum, I, 1932, 163-167. A description of ornamented fishing weights in the Museum collection. Songs of the Polynesian Voyagers. By J. F. Stimson. Journal of the Polynesian Society, XLI, 181-201. Two songs recorded during the recent expedition of the Bishop Museum to Tuamotu.</page><page sequence="2">BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTICES 243 The Knowledge and Use of Iron among South Sea Islanders. By T. A. Rickard. Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute, LXII, 1932, 1-22. A summary of this paper was published previously in Man, and noted in Oceania, n, 499. MELANESIA AND NEW GUINEA A New Musical Instrument from Papua. By Geoffrey Christian. Man, 1932, 83. The author describes the novel but effective method of producing " a concord of sweet sounds " used by the Menada Kukukuku natives of the upper reaches of the Purari River, at the head of the Gulf of Papua. The " instrument " might be termed a drum. The tympanum is a disc of hardwood some three inches thick and three to four feet in diameter. Several men balance it on their toes or knees and hold it against their depressed abdominal walls. The distended lungs act as resonators, and by tapping the disc with a stone headed hammer, a " deep booming sound " issues from the open mouths of the human sounding boxes. The players appear to be under some kind of ritual seclusion. Physiological Paternity in the Trobriands. By G. A. Gaskell. Man, 1932, 66. Pigs, Papuans and Police Court Perspective. By B. Malinowski. Man, 1932, 44. Professor Malinowski's reply to the statement that the Trobriand Islanders are not ignorant of the physiological facts of paternity (noted Oceania, II, 372). He shows conclusively that Mr. RentouTs facts in no way prove that the natives have any knowledge of the true rôle of the father in procreation. Economic Life of Melanesia. By C. H. Wedgwood. Man, 1932, 117. Notes on a paper read before the Sociological Research Committee of the Royal Anthropological Institute. The types of food-getting activities, the non-food- producing types of activities, the organization of labour, and the ownership and distribution of goods are discussed. Miss Wedgwood criticizes the criteria on which Hobhouse based his stages of economic development. She is of the opinion that the data available are at present too meagre to be of much use as a basis for generalization. Folk Stories from the Northern Solomons. By B. Blackwood. Folklore, XLIII, 1932, 61-96. This article presents culture hero stories, stories of origins and of the dead, and various natural history stories collected in the northern islands of the Solomon group. No sociological analysis is made, but parallels are drawn from other Melanesian areas. The Music System of the Fijians. By Keith Kennedy. Mankind, I, 1931, 37-39. Brief notes on the Fijian tetrachordal scale, and on the chorus singing of the natives.</page><page sequence="3">244 BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTICES A Fijian Yaqona Ceremony. By Keith Kennedy. Mankind, I, 1931, 59-61. A description of the drinking of kava at Naweni. Flints in the South-East Solomon Islands. By W. G. Ivens. Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute, LXI, 1931, 421-424. Flint Tranchets in the Solomons and Elsewhere. By H. S. Harrison. Journal of Royal Anthropological Institute, LXI, 1931, 425-434. The use of flint implements in the Solomons appears to have been more general in the remote past than at the time of the first European contact. Dr. Ivens discusses the problem of why polished stone tools took the place of those made from flint. Dr. Harrison describes a number of old flint implements. The Place of Vui and Tamate in the Religion of Mota. By W. G. Ivens. Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute, LXI, 1931, 157-166. Dr. Ivens discusses the differentiation between ghosts (tamate) and spirits (vui) in the beliefs of the people of Mota in the Banks Islands. He demonstrates what he considers to be the relation of these beings to the Sukwe club and the Tamate societies. He appears to find the progenitors of some of the vui and tamate in a set of hypothetical immigrants. One cannot fail to admire the facile mental conjuring which enables Dr. Ivens to form his conclusions, but surely speculation and inference are scarcely adequate as a basis for the positive dictum that the stories told about Kwat, one of the vui, which, " are on all fours with the Polynesian stories of Maui, all ... have to do with culture heroes who were certainly men in origin." Natural and Supernatural. By A. M. Hocart. Man, XXXII, 78. Mr. Hocart refutes the suggestion that the peoples of Eddystone and the Fiji Islands do not, or cannot, distinguish between natural and supernatural. He gives examples from both regions which appear to show fairly conclusively that the native has a very real idea of the antithesis involves in the conceptions of " human and kalou or spiritual " or " mana and ordinary." He points out that the chief difficulty in connection with this matter is the translation of a native term by a European one, which although similar in meaning, has " implications which are not in the mind of any South Sea Islander." A Prehistoric Sherd from the Mailu District, Papua. By A. C. Haddon. Man, XXXII, 1932, 136. A description of the fragment of what was apparently a large pot. This fragment is ornamented with a design entirely different from those used nowadays by the people of the Mailu area. Dr. Haddon gives descriptions of the two main varieties of decoration on old pottery found in Papua.</page><page sequence="4">BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTICES 245 The Notion of Maja in the Jabem Language of N.E. New Guinea. By St. Lehner, Lutheran Missionary, Finschhafen, New Guinea. (Translated from the German.) Journal of the Polynesian Society, XLI, 121-130. A discussion of a native concept, which, roughly speaking, is that of a sense of shame due to some departure from customary or prescribed conduct. Here is just another instance of the impossibility of making a short yet adequate translation of the native term for a native concept. The author realizes this, and in proof that the concept has not always the same precise shade of meaning, gives a series of examples of situations and behaviour involving ma ja. These he analyzes briefly, though with considerable insight. He finds that there are three principal grades of maja, increas- ing in intensity from a modest shyness through a deeper disturbance of feeling to a degree of shame and resentment which can only be assuaged by an expiatory gift, as of a pig. It is encouraging to the anthropologist to find that, " The aim of missionary endeavour should not be to destroy the feelings associated with maja, but to sublimate them." On the other hand, this short survey is marred by an underlying conviction that native custom is somehow intrinsically bad, relative to white culture. It is in the moral sphere more particularly that the missionary is unable to free his judgment from absolute standards. In this article there is little attempt to realize that although all morals are not as ours, this does not prevent them from being any less real in their proper context. The Wake of the Southern Cross. By Cecil Wilson. John Murray, London, 1932. Pp. xii+254, with 12 photographs and a map. These quite readable reminiscences of a sometime Anglican Bishop of Melanesia contain some account of the peoples of the New Hebrides, Banks, Torres, Tikopia, Santa Cruz, Reef and Solomon Islands. The work is obviously intended primarily for popular circulation, and the ethnographical data presented are at best sketchy and very often factually inaccurate. For the anthropologist its chief interest lies in its exposition of the attitude of a fairly broadminded missionary to native custom. Dr. Wilson is ever ready to make an endeavour to see good in native practices, but his deep-seated, and without doubt sincere, conviction of the unmitigated good which must follow from the uplifting of the heathen prevents him from attaining any real evaluation of native culture.

Sex Affiliation and its Implications. By F. E. Williams. Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute, LXII, 51-82.

The system of descent is peculiar in that the</page><page sequence="5">246 BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTICES male children belong to the social group of the father, while the female children belong to the group of their mother. Yet apparently every group contains both males and females ! Mr. Williams does not explain how this comes about. A good deal more information is required before the system can be understood. An Investigation of the Thought of Primitive Children, with Special Reference to Animism. By Margaret Mead. Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute, LXII, 173-190. From a study in Europe and America the conclusion has been drawn that the thought of children is characterized by anthropomorphic interpretation. Dr. Mead set out to test this conclusion with regard to the children of Manns. She found that it was not valid, the spontaneous animism of the children being less than that of the adults, and therefore concludes that the anthropomorphic interpretations of our children are determined only by culture.</page></plain_text>
