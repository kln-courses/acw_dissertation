Historians using psychoanalysis face particularly troublesome meth- odological difficulties. Psychoanalysis deals with "intrapsychic agencies" which operate inside people's heads and hence outside the range of histori- cal verifiability. Furthermore, analysts communicate their insights in the vocabulary of Freudian metapsychology, that vast underworld (or per- haps "overworld" would be more a propos) of terms - "id," "ego," ''superego," "drive," "impulse," and the like - which have infiltrated popular imagination as the "essence" of psychoanalysis yet whose scholastic subtleties ("cathexis," "counter-cathexis," "hyper-cathexis," for example) historians often find vague, difficult to comprehend, and vex- ing to apply. Recently Fred Weinstein and Gerald Platt have reaffirmed the metapsychology's central importance in relating psychoanalysis to history. For them the metapsychology "represents the highest level of abstraction" from clinical data to theory; it organizes data and "lower-level" proposi- tions systematically. Since historians cannot observe their subjects di- rectly, they must rely on metapsychological propositions, for "In fact, all that the historian effectively has" is "a highly differentiated theoretical structure" which can supplement imagination and provide reasonable judgment as to the meaning of codes and objects for historical actors. Weinstein and Platt ground their approach to "psychohistory" on the as- sumptions that the metapsychology constitutes a consistently meaningful corpus of psychological information and concepts, and that the system's language communicates its content cogently.' To the laity, the metapsychology appears a massive edifice of thought, monumental and solid. To psychoanalysts themselves, however, it seems to be an increasingly frail reed. Some analysts perceive a crisis within psychoanalytic theory itself: "not that new facts have been piling up that embarrass the old model, but that the fundamental methodological - that is, basically philosophical and conceptual - weaknesses and fallacies of the theory have been exposed."2 Psychoanalysts have attacked the meta- psychology for reifying and personifying concepts; they maintain that it creates a language divorced from clinical realities. They argue that it has little predictive power and that it often rests on factually incorrect assump- 1.

Even more provoking have been arguments against metapsycholo- gy's very place in psychoanalytic thought. While it appears to embody the essential discoveries of clinical research, the metapsychology actually de- rives from a mechanistic model of man which Freud elaborated on the basis of nineteenth-century physicalistic psychology and which, from time to time, he disregarded or subordinated to a more humanistic model which better accounts for the meaning and responsibility of action in phe- nomenological terms. Derived from biological and neurological assump- tions and phrased in a naturalistic vocabulary, the metapsychology cannot lead to meaningful statements about strictly psychological processes, and the natural science universe of discourse is neither derivable from nor testable by psychoanalytic methods.4 For one observer, such critiques have been devastating: "We all agree that metapsychology is moribund if not actually dead, and I find it hard to imagine that the concept of ego will survive the general collapse."5 The debate over the importance of psychoanalytic metapsychology has great import for historians. For one thing, it reminds us, if we need such reminders, that any theory we use will be subject to criticism within its own discipline, and we must be aware of the consequences for our own interpretations. More specifically, it questions the fruitfulness of following Weinstein and Platt's approach for integrating psychoanalysis and history, since they rely on the assumptions and language of a framework whose very philosophical and explanatory foundations have been challenged. How can we speak of "ego's reaction to object loss" if "ego" itself proves a meaningless term? Finally, even if most psychoanalysts want a metapsy- chology, the present metapsychology seems less and less serviceable to analysts themselves, and hence must become less usable to historians who, after all, only adopt its constructs and can have little say about its creation and elaboration. Whatever the debate's outcome, we will no longer be able to employ the metapsychology unthinkingly, and we may not be able to use it at all. These considerations suggest several research possibilities. Historians can continue to ignore psychoanalysis, adding to an already imposing list of 3.

Of course many historical questions in no way require a psychoanalytic perspective. Yet any history dealing primarily with human behavior as such that disregards actions performed unconsciously overlooks a crucial level of explanation. Historians may opt for Weinstein and Platt's reliance on the metapsychol- ogy. However, an alternative emerges from the work of Roy Schafer, one that may enable historians to nibble the psychoanalytic cake without suffer- ing metapsychological indigestion. A Newv Language for Psychoanalysis collects Schafer's previously pub- lished post-1970 essays on the metapsychology and adds new material. Schafer believes that analysts must question the metapsychology's useful- ness, and Part II presents his own exposition of its inadequacies. However, Schafer does not want simply to revise the present system: he wishes to eliminate it lock, stock, and ego. In its stead, he proposes an "action language," which conceives of psychological events as processes (de- scribed by verbs) rather than structures (described by nouns). Part III presents general applications of this language to psychoanalytic concepts; Part IV deals more particularly with the theory of affects; and Part V summarizes the rules of the language developed thus far. Schafer's radical reformulation challenges the fundamental ways analysts perceive their dis- cipline; Moreover, action language offers new possibilities for utilizing psychoanalysis in historical research, and, by extension, can help us re- conceptualize that vague terrain we now denote "psychohistory." Schafer considers his critique part of a movement that points not only to a more unified theory and more consistent, effective clinical work, but to "a new and fruitful action between psychoanalysis and all those intellectual disciplines concerned with the study of human beings as persons" (x-xi), one of which, of course, is history. In fact, Schafer takes an extreme position bound to disturb many analysts, and possibly quite a few histo- rians: the roots of psychoanalysis really lie in the humanities rather than in the natural sciences, for its data and methodology deal with meanings and subjective experience, and ultimately, "psychoanalysis is a special form of knowing about human existence and history (25)." The actions, claimed and disclaimed, in which all humans engage, their reactions to their ac- tions, and the meanings they attach to and demonstrate in their actions, particularly as encountered in the clinical setting, are the real substance of psychoanalysis. Its "native tongue" consists in the "systematic discourse about human lives as they are encountered in psychoanalytic sessions" (123-124), that language spoken by analysts and analysands - and by us all - which communicates human activity as conceived and perceived by</page><page sequence="4">116 REVIEW ESSAYS the actors in the locutions of common speech. Following Wittgenstein, Schafer considers language "a set of rules for saying things of the sort that constitute or communicate a version of reality or a world" (4). Every language, therefore, implicitly includes a theory of knowledge. Freud, Heinz Hartmann, and analysts in general faultily translated the language of clinical experience and its communication of human meanings and inten- tions into the "quasi-physicochemical and quasi-biological language" (362) of metapsychology and its epistemic focus on "forces" and "motives." This translation changes not merely the "style" or "syntax" of psycho- analytic discourse but its very purpose; from an examination of explana- tions for actions, it becomes a search for causes of behavior. Manifold problems arise from this shift. In the clinical setting, psychoanalytic theory deals with human meaning and intention. The metapsychology, especially as elaborated by Heinz Hartmann, does not derive from the data of clinical experience, but from a mechanistic model of mind whose reliance on the causal efficacy of psychic drives actually antedates clinical observation, though it purports to arise from experience (ch. 4). This leads to a "radical split between the mode of theorizing and the mode of investigation," and ultimately to behaviorism (108). The metapsychology cannot in its own terms explain the complexity of clinical understanding: for example, it cannot account for learning (how do "drives," "equipment," and "functions" learn?); it describes behavior on the basis of drives, but such descriptions depend on the prior discovery of the meanings of behavior, which are then imputed to combinations of drives; it argues that knowledge requires "cathexis" and "integration," but begs the question who (or what) determines what knowledge is impor- tant (92-93). Furthermore, though phrased in naturalistic locutions, the metapsychology is actually congruent with archaic body language (5); its abstractions conceal anthropomorphic assumptions (ch. 5). Who, or what, directs the "psychic apparatus" of id, ego, and superego? Hartmann at- tempted to answer this question by positing an "adaptational ego," Erik- son an "identity," and Hans Kohut a "self"; but for Schafer these are all phenomenological stopgaps, which drift spectrally through analytic theory indicating the need for new conceptualizing but fail to solve the riddle of the ghostly mover, the god in the machine who directs the apparatus. Schafer, however, strips the curtain from this psychic Wizard of Oz, who turns out to be - "the psychoanalytic clinician's projection of himself or herself into the model of mind" (I19). In reality, humans make choices; only in theory do they resemble machines. Thus Schafer condemns the metapsychology for not describing real ac- tors. The language of theory describes a "mind" consisting of "mental machinery"; the clinician confronts a person who makes choices, who may engage in several contradictory actions at the same time. But Schafer does</page><page sequence="5">REVIEW ESSAYS 117 not rest content in exposing the theory's flaws; he develops a new lan- guage, one which he thinks remains true to the real data of psychoanalysis and avoids the conceptual, logical, and philosophical pitfalls of any meta- psychology. The thinking, acting, choosing, feeling person, not the 'mind," must become the center of theory; and Schafer does this by inventing an "action language" whose fundamental rule changes the nature of psychoanalytic discourse: We shall regard each psychological process, event, experience, or behavior as some kind of activity, henceforth to be called action, and shall designate each action by an active verb stating its nature and by an adverb (or adverbial locution), when applicable, stating the mode of this action. (9) Humans, for Schafer, do not "have" emotions (affects), because emotions are not things; they love, hate, act angrily, speak happily. People do not "deceive themselves"; they attend faultily to their actions. Things do not "come to mind"; people think. As an example of how action language translates metapsychological propositions, Schafer renders " 'His repres- sion of this dangerous impulse was too weak to prevent it from gaining consciousness' " as " 'By failing to be sufficiently on guard about not doing so, he thought consciously of the action that he wished to perform and would have performed had he not deemed it too dangerous to do so' (206). Such sentences may give historians and analysts alike the heebie-jeebies (or more correctly, persons reading tortuously complicated sentences will shake heebie-jeebily). But more than mere euphony is at stake. Discarding "mind" and "apparatus," Schafer describes human behavior in terms of actions which can be interpreted by any observer and which do not require recourse to postulated "forces" or invisible "drives" which do not compel acceptance because ultimately they cannot be proved. We cannot demon- strate that the superego exists, but we can describe an individual who stutters and blushes after crossing against a red light. Of course, several observers may interpret an action differently, but when phrased in action language terms, all the cards, so to speak, are on the table. One may agree or disagree with a given interpretation, one may want (and seek) more information, one may choose to describe the action from another perspec- tive, but in any case all the material remains verifiable. The deck contains no jokers. Schafer has offered the most searching estimate of the metapsychology and the most original solution to its difficulties that have yet appeared. By assigning psychoanalysis to the humanities and scrapping the metapsychol- ogy totally, he occupies an extreme minority position within the analytic community. Supporters praise him for facilitating communication, creating a theory closer than the metapsychology to clinical experience, seeing per-</page><page sequence="6">118 REVIEW ESSAYS sons in holistic terms, and exposing the gaps in existing theory,6 but some- times even they betray an ambivalent attitude. Robert Holt, himself a critic of the metapsychology, considers Schafer's action language "breathtak- ing," "a permanent contribution regardless of what happens on the loftier theoretical front," and thinks analysts "may well find it more liberating and clinically helpful than the Ego and the Id"; yet he is also "reluctant to conclude that radical surgery of this extent is needed."7 Critics cite him for misinterpreting Freud's intentions in devising the metapsychology, for to- tally dismissing questions of how people behave in favor of inquiries con- cerning why they do what they do, and, most importantly, for bringing psychoanalysis close to losing its distinctive character.8 Debates about ac- tion language involve arguments about the nature of psychoanalysis itself. Ever since Freud, analysts have aspired to make psychoanalysis a gen- eral psychology, and in doing so, have found themselves wondering whether their work falls into the category of the sciences or the humanities, or both. Although a few writers, Schafer included, consider psychoanalysis part of the humanities,9 the vast majority of analysts usually opt for their discipline as a science, in part because its historical, conceptual, and pro- cedural roots lie largely in biology, neurology, and medicine. Freud's in- stinct theories attempted to give analysis a biological substrate; and though analysts may question specific elements of the theories, they do not wish to relinquish their biological perspective. Human behavior, analysts say, serves many functions, and to deny the potential for investigating the phys- iological bases of behavior strips psychoanalysis of its special position as a science of behavior and denies one crucial perspective on the determina- tion of human actions. Since analysts consider their endeavors scientific, they also concern themselves with hypothesizing, predicting, testing observations, and in or- dering their data into a large-scale system - the metapsychology. Analysts wonder about this organizing process; they ask if there is simply one theory of psychoanalysis, deriving from clinical practice, or if there is another level which conceptualizes the "raw data" of everyday experience. Most of them conceive two levels of theory, clinical and metapsychological, and 6. Leonard J.

Even if the current metapsychology raises problems, its absence would create more; some generalizing overview is essential. Schafer's critics are correct in accusing him of challenging the nature of psychoanalysis. From an historian's point of view, however, the import of their attacks is less sure. Historians, too, have a long history of deliberating about whether our discipline is an art or a science, and we have learned to live, more or less happily, with the ambiguity that it partakes of both. Whatever analysts decide they are doing, the result cannot affect the applicability of their observations to historians unless they change their clinical method, and this is not the point at issue. The state of the metapsy- chology notwithstanding, psychoanalytic data collected "in the field" re- main an enormously important body of material on human behavior, inten- tions, and development. The problem for historians has been that these data could only be expressed in the available metapsychological language, so foreign to the common-sense locutions which we usually employ. Schafer provides a new lexicon which facilitates translation between the languages Qf historical and psychoanalytic experience. 1- Despite the critics' outcries, Schafer is not overthrowing psychoanalysis. He maintains all the clinical contributions which form its core, and he considers his work to fall ' within the great and arduous tradition of systematic and clinically oriented psychoanalytic thinking" (4). Far from dismissing analytic in- sights, Schafer seeks a more concrete form for expressing them. The theory of knowledge implicit in his new formulation deals with the kinds of phenomena historians have always dealt with - observed (or recorded) actions. In basing his theory and language on verifiable observations, Schafer reveals new channels of communication between historians and analysts which have hitherto been clouded by the rarified fogs of metapsy- chological jargon. Schafer's understanding of the methodology and development of psycho- analysis emphasizes both the possibility and desirability of closer interdis- ciplinary contact. For him, "clinical psychoanalysis is a certain kind of historical discipline" (20) which requires an "historical, experiential, in- 10.

He wants analysts to make history rather than biology their perspective. He inclines toward viewing analytic theory in historical, evolutionary terms; discussing the "current enthusiasm for self- concepts," he calls for their explanation "by an intellectual historian of the future" (118). Although speaking primarily to psychoanalysts, Schafer in- vites historians to eavesdrop. In fact, he does more than invite - he facilitates contact. In changing the nature of psychoanalytic discourse, action language alters the focus and methods of historians using analytic theory; developments in the two dis- ciplines parallel each other. Schafer wants analysts to concentrate on clini- cal data, on what the analysand says and does, rather than speculate how "the mind" produces these results. In effect, Schafer is casting analytic phenomena in behavioral (but not behaviorist) terms. He defines action as "human behavior that has a point; it is meaningful human activity; it is intentional or goal-directed performances by people" (139); such phenom- ena can be described. So conceived, analytic data resembles the "stuff" of historical inquiry. Historians, too, deal with purposeful actions, intentional performances we adduce from records of those past actions. We are equipped to interpret the meaning of those actions, both for ourselves and for the actors, but we cannot, as historians (rather than as philosophers or psychologists), explain how persons think and feel, though we can evaluate people's thoughts and feelings in an historical context. By showing analysts how reliance on the metapsychology has obscured clinical experience, Schafer reminds historians that when we stray from considerations arising solely from the nature of our data, we risk writing bad history and embar- rassing ourselves in someone else's field to boot. This reminder has its positive aspects too. Historians and analysts have both accumulated information which, considered as observations of human actions, can be compared across disciplines. In particular, historians have learned, and can learn more, about how we act unconsciously, dream meaningfully, wish to do one thing and do another, and continue to act as adults in ways we acted as children. None of this requires theorizing about how humans do these things; in fact, the metapsychology has done us a disservice by making us think we could transcend our limits and pretend to know all the factors making for past actions. We must constantly re- member that analysts have made their observations in a very special situa- tion, that they can explore unclear communications, that they can elicit new information - and even then, gaps in their knowledge remain. Histo- rians are still dependent on documents; and however vague, unevocative, water-stained, or moth-eaten they may be, we cannot get more out of them than they give us.12 We can, however, profitably examine the findings of 12. Robert A. LeVine, Culture, Behavior, and Personality (Chicago, 1973), ch. 14, suggests that anthropologists should collect psychological data by psychoanalyzing their informants.</page><page sequence="9">REVIEW ESSAYS 121 analysts about certain human actions and forms of experience, and we can use this knowledge to inform and enlighten our reading of our own materi- als. By concentrating on the clinical setting as the fact-producing field of psychoanalysis, Schafer makes analytic and historical data comparable, hence usable to researchers in both fields. Further, he increases this ac- cessibility by creating a language which, although still technical (acting "oedipally" or "unconsciously," for instance) does not mystify. "Learn- ing languages," Robert Schulzinger tells us, "is something historians do well. They should be just as able to master a vocabulary labelled 'technical' as one marked 'foreign'." 13 Yet metapsychological language itself has often proved a barrier to understanding analytic insights; scholars from other fields who wish to learn from psychoanalysis but who may have limited time to learn a complicated theory can lose themselves in the shifting sands of metapsychological terminology. By removing a language barrier, Schafer fosters mutual communication and understanding. In no sense does he wish to simplify psychoanalytic theory - the new language does not underesti- mate the complexities of human actions nor reduce analytic understanding of behavior. It does make an exceedingly complicated and varied body of observations more available to non-specialists, much in the way that Freud's case histories revealed his profound insights in plain terms. A third link derives from Schafer's accent on stances. Analysts have begun to realize that, in concentrating on single persons, they have often assumed a stable, absolute "out there" which reduces "the world" to a screen for individual projections.14 Schafer continually alludes to phenom- ena in terms of perspectives, or visions. Metapsychology, he argues, creates an all-too-limited view of clinical reality. By ignoring, for the most part, factors outside the person, and by explaining actions in mechanistic terms, it forces analysts to limit their theoretical discussions "to a rigorous application of abstract metapsychological principles that are themselves adaptations and applications of concepts drawn from other fields . . (25-26). Schafer sees clinical experience consisting of comic, romantic, tragic, and ironic elements, each of which tells a truth, yet none of which, even in combination, explains everything. From this process emerges the analytic life history, which "is to be viewed as a joint creation of patient and analyst - not a fiction but not simply factual either, subject to a de- gree to the limitations, individualities, and visions of the two participants in the analytic process" (56). Ultimately, even psychoanalysis itself is just a stance one may assume in understanding human action, a unique posture to be sure, but, like other possibilities, "a matter of vision, too" (56). 13.

On a "technical" level, his "visions of reality" express the analytic commonplace that human actions are psycho- logically "over-determined" - have many sources - and serve multiple functions. Historians work with the same understanding; though we may choose to emphasize one or more primary "causes," we speak of events as influenced from many directions.'5 Moreover, historians have recognized these different aspects and the need for studying them separately at times by classifying certain types of investigation - social, economic, political, and religious history, to name a few. In general, both psychoanalysis and history are methods of inquiry and investigative stances, each supplying many truths but not Truth. Both analysts and historians have been guilty of asserting the paramount importance of their respective disciplines. Schafer reminds us all that our heritages of skepticism about absolute truth and our commitment to expressing the complexity of phenomena make the dialogue between methodological stances possible and desirable. Finally, in eliminating metapsychology, Schafer commits psychoanalysis to investigating meanings and intentions.16 The model of drives and in- stincts leads to an infinite regression of "causes" which "produce" actions considered "psychically determined." Schafer does not ask what "force" from which "structure" caused a psychic event, but how do humans per- ceive their actions, what do they intend to do, what do they think they are doing? Historians have always dealt with human meanings and explana- tions for action, but we have tended to concentrate on and accept rational explanations. Psychoanalysis confronts us with data that humans act irra- tionally as well as, indeed at the same time as, we are acting rationally. Even simple purposive actions have many meanings to each individual, though one may not be aware of them all. Schafer's language permits historians to utilize analytic knowledge of actions and their human mean- ings by presenting them in observable terms rather than as hypothetical constructs. A translation from the metapsychological language used by one historian into action language may demonstrate the problems and advantages in- volved. In discussing Andrew Jackson's family background, Michael Paul Rogin writes:17 15. H. Stuart Hughes, History as Art and as Science (New York, 1964), 47. 16. Marshall Edelson, "Language and Dreams: The Interpretation of Dreams Revisited," Psychoanalytic Study of the Child 27 (1972), 204, contends that "Psychoanalysis inherently aspires, I believe, to a general theory of symbolic functioning (rather than to a general psychology or a general theory of behavior)." 17.

But a man in the grip of primitive rage wants vengeance for wounds to the core of the self. Sources of rage deriving from separation anxiety are intense, fantasy-ridden, and ego-destructive. They devour the self, and express fears of being devoured. The self experiences primitive rages as ego- and world-destroying; such rages are often called maddened. They characterized Jackson, and he gained his mature political power from his ability to sublimate them. From the perspective of action language, this passage obfuscates, rather than illuminates, Jackson's behavior. For instance, Rogin does not hold Jackson responsible for his actions - Jackson does not rage, but rather is moved by an anthropomorphic "rage" that "grips" him. The "sources" of this rage are also anthropomorphic (as is aggression, the "servant" of desire) - they "devour" the "self" and "express fears" of being de- voured themselves. The "self' experiences "primitive rages" - but who or what is "the self' -Jackson? What are "wounds" to its "core" -is that in any sense analogous to Charles Wilkinson shooting Jackson near his heart? What are "maddened" rages? What is the "ego," and what happens if and when it is "destroyed" - is this analogous to "brain death"? The "sources of rage" are "intense, fantasy-ridden, and ego-destructive," but what are they? Forces? Structures? Experiences? This "clinical picture," in trying to seek causes for Jackson's behavior, uses vague concepts to advance unclear explanations for anthropomorphic phenomena. Old Hick- ory himself disappears. Metapsychological theory seeks "causes," and in using it, Rogin com- pounds his difficulties. He wants to explain Jackson's political success; but, embroiled in dissecting Jackson's psyche, he attributes the General's "mature political power" to his "ability to sublimate" his "primitive rage." This is nonsense. Jackson's "mature political power" came from, among other things, population growth beyond the Appalachians which gave the West more voters, ardent supporters who wanted to advance their interests by advancing his, and Jackson's own adroit politicking. In at- tributing Jackson's political power to "sublimated rage," Rogin propounds an extremely reductionist argument. Furthermore, he has to account for this rage in Jackson's infancy, but, as he admits, he has no evidence. Nevertheless, he speculates from certain "suggestive facts" such as Jackson's birth after his father's death that Jackson could have had "a problematic oral relationship" (45). Rogin uses nonexistent evidence to support undetermined facts to interpret a non sequitur. I have cited an extreme example, yet the logic of metapsychological investigation compels the historian to "prove" the clinical picture described by reference to childhood experience. Unfortunately, in virtually all cases, the necessary data are lacking, and inferences about events of infancy educed from adult documents only magnify the errors. A mere translation cannot change faulty reasoning. However, action lan-</page><page sequence="12">124 REVIEW ESSAYS guage eliminates the need for a diagnosis, and helps elucidate some real insight that Rogin does have into Jackson's behavior:18 Infants and small children who want their mothers (love object) to love and nurture them often act aggressively to achieve their desires. At the same time, they fear that their mothers will go away and stop loving them (separation anxiety). They rage at their helplessness so intensely (primitive rage) that they (self) fantasize they will devour the world and also that it will devour them (ego- and world-destroying fantasies). An adult who-rages in such an infantile mode wants revenge because he or she hurts so overwhelmingly (wounds to the core of the self). Jackson often raged in this manner (rages characterized Jackson), and he acted to increase his political power as an adult by raging when he thought, consciously or uncon- sciously, that by doing so he could gain political advantage (sublimation). In the translation, the General re-emerges, crusty, cantankerous, and pur- posive as ever, and Rogin's propositions become more testable by appeals to evidence. Analysts have noted that persons do rage and fantasize in the manner described. Phrased in action language, such information becomes usable by historians. We do not need to know the "causes" of such ac- tions, or where they occur in the "mind"; we can accept the analytic data for informing us that people may rage not only at present insults and setbacks, but simultaneously at infantile frustrations also. We do not need to know and, in any case, we can never prove, if Jackson was "consciously aware of his motives" for raging; we can, however, test whether Rogin's contention that Jackson's raging effected political consequences has any merit. In fact, it does. Because Rogin is sensitive to psychological data, he can organize his historical materials in a fashion to discuss the meaning of Jackson's behavior by referring to observed events. Contemporaries and historians unanimously certify Jackson's raging. Rogin shows that such actions were not accidental or fortuitous but represented a stance which Jackson assumed repeatedly, and which affected his handling of such polit- ical problems as rechartering the Bank of the United States and creating a policy toward the Amerindians. By commenting on the childlike quality of Jackson's behavior in certain situations, Rogin increases our understanding of Jackson's perceptions of himself and his world, which in turn helps explain other actions more fully. And, since the translation organizes the material into an interpretation of events rather than as an hypothesis about childhood, we can determine if the interpretation satisfactorily explains other incidents. 18. Of course, I am totally responsible for the following translation. I have tried to render the meaning of the passage as I understand it, and the translation is "loose" rather than literal. The passage itself, I think, necessitates such a strategy. Schafer might disagree with some of my word choices, but no two translators will render the same passage identically, and in any case, the newness of action language precludes a large number of examples for guid- ance. Despite these considerations, the translation suggests an alternate expression of histori- cal information and inquiry, and this is my object.</page><page sequence="13">REVIEW ESSAYS 125 George Dangerfield has described Jackson's behavior in the race for the 1824 presidential nomination:19 "Indeed, he took very little interest in the campaign until - it was quite in character -he had a highly personal reason for doing so: until he discovered that Governor Carroll of Tennes- see, ostensibly his friend, had been working in secret for the election of Henry Clay. Then at last his wrath blazed up20 and the campaign became a vendetta, in the arts of which he had long been skilled." This account supports Rogin's thesis. Jackson did not actively pursue his interests until he perceived that he had been insulted. He then raged ("wrath blazed up"), he wanted to revenge himself for his hurt ("vendetta"), and he acted angrily to his best political advantage (used "the arts of which he had long been skilled"). Jackson often acted this way ("it was quite in character"). Dangerfield did not need psychological data to argue his point, but Rogin's systematic exposition of that data in relation to Jackson's life throughout his book shows the fuller significance of particular incidents. Other histo- rians may not agree with Rogin's ideas, but they will have to confront the evidence themselves. Action language also offers a means of bringing psychoanalysis to bear on problems of group dynamics. Because it describes individual behaviors, and individuals comprise groups, historians can, blessed with the appro- priate data, describe how persons have made concerted actions and discuss their intentions as demonstrated by these actions. To illustrate, I refer to some recent studies of witchcraft. The phenomenon of witchcraft, which has so bedeviled peasants, in- quisitors, and historians, presents humans acting in such impassioned ways that some kind of psychological explanations must be advanced. Even Keith Thomas, whose monumental study of religion and magic in seventeenth-century England explicitly eschews a psychological explana- tion for the fact that most accused witches were women, agrees that "there is still much about the fantasy side of witch-beliefs which cries out for explanation."'21 Recent investigators of New England witchcraft have ad- vanced various psychological interpretations of the Salem outbreak. John Demos contends that the girls' fits gave them the opportunity to project forbidden aggressive impulses onto older women, attacking the women by accusing them of witchcraft while maintaining that the women were in fact attacking them.22 Demos reminds us that American witchcraft 19.

He also attempts to link themes in the girls' psychology with general cultural trends; the accusers were "especially sensitive to the problems created by their environment," but "nearly everyone in seventeenth-century New England was at some level an accuser." Demos is quite attuned to the difficulties of making psychological interpretations of historical material; "every psycho-historian," he declares, performs an "act of faith" that one's chosen theory "provides deeper, fuller insights into human behavior than any other," and these choices will be measured on "pragmatic grounds."24 However, his reliance on the psychoanalytic metapsychology leads to problems. Demos accepts Freudian drive theory and uses it to advance his theory of projected aggression, but even analysts now question its legitimacy.25 Can we be certain that the girls were "projecting?" Mary Warren could describe different conscious states she experienced, and it is possible that the girls "really saw" witches and behaved accordingly - that is, they "hallucinated" or "misperceived" rather than "projected." Moreover, by mentioning images of sucking and biting which he sees as evidence of "orality," Demos compels himself, as does Rogin, to'hypoth- esize about childrearing practices with no evidence. Using the metapsy- chology traps him, despite his caution, into examinations of "minds" that force available sources. Yet if Demos runs aground on the Scylla of too much theory, Chadwick Hansen whirls in the Charybdis of too little. Arguing that seventeenth- century Anglo-American culture supported belief in the existence of witches and that, in fact, several Salemites did practice witchcraft, Hansen contends that the girls suffered from what late ninteenth-century psychol- ogists were to define as classical hysterical symptoms, which were elicited by a fear of witchcraft.26 Hansen effectively refutes Marion Starkey's sex- ual understanding of the symptoms,27 and he conveys the terror that afflicted the community. But though he tries to delimit his definition of hysteria to a specific psychological syndrome, he begins to invoke it as an explanatory agent that exceeds the definition. A major, if not the major, cause of the witch hunt was "an outbreak of epidemic hysteria," which spread in part because "hysterical fits are catching."28 How can we link the etiological factors of hysteria in individuals adduced by Breuer and 23.

Does a term which ex- plains everything really explain anything? "Mass hysteria" sounds like a construct from "common sense" psychology, a metaphor for describing phenomena historians (and psychologists) do not fully understand. Without using theory rigorously, Hansen undercuts his argument. Both Demos and Hansen use psychology to ask general questions about complex occurrences; they seek psychological explanations equivalent to higher order concepts like "social mobility" that historians usually employ. Paul Boyer and Stephen Nissenbaum have tried a different tactic: they invoke psychology to comprehend the actions of the Putnam family, which included several of the most prominent accusers.29 The Putnams, frustrated and embittered by economic and political failures while the rival Porter family flourished, used witchcraft accusations to vent their rage. Finding, however, that accusations against "the powerless, the outcast, or the al- ready victimized were not sufficiently cathartic for them," the Putnams escalated "this deadly game" to targets "further up the social and eco- nomic ladder," in the process involving some Porter supporters and rein- forcing the witch hunt.30 By focusing on a small-scale subject for scrutiny, Boyer and Nissenbaum appear to have avoided the usual methodological pitfalls, but their "common-sense" psychology does not work either. For one thing, they misuse the term "projection." For analysts, "projection" is "a defense mechanism which results in the individual attributing a wish or impulse of his [or her] own to some other person [or object]," but as they employ it, as in "the Putnams . . . projected their bitterness onto persons who were, politically or psychologically, less threatening targets," it appears to mean simply "directed," or "acted bitterly towards," a statement which needs no theoretical supports.31 Indeed, Boyer and Nis- senbaum do not cite a single work of psychology, yet they proffer a most speculative explanation for the Putnam's behavior. Finding numerous paral- lels between the plot of Hansel and Gretel and the Putnams' situation, they claim that the witch in the fairy tale "is a symbolic projection of the stepmother herself," and that the Putnams similarly conceived Mary Veren Putnam (whose son Joseph received a patrimony his Putnam half-brothers thought excessive and then married a Porter, compounding insult and in- jury) as the source of their misfortune.32 Therefore, Boyer and Nissenbaum 29.

Interpreting the Putnams' behavior by likening it to a psycho- analytic interpretation of a story (describing an action by referring to a metaphor of a metaphor) is dubious enough, but the most damaging blow falls with their observation that the Putnams never accused Mary Veren Putnam. Boyer and Nissenbaum try to argue that the Putnams "pro- jected"33 their bitterness onto other targets, but then the parallel to Hansel and Gretel - in which the children kill the witch and the stepmother dies simultaneously - disappears, and their whole structure collapses. Strict reliance on psychoanalytic metapsychology leads to difficulties in describing group behavior, but so does "common-sense" psychology. Yet Demos, Hansen, and Boyer and Nissenbaum all recognize that some phe- nomena need psychological investigation, and, despite their faults, these scholars indicate areas that do indeed "cry out for explanation." Perhaps the problems occur not because historians have asked psychological ques- tions, but because we have asked the wrong psychological questions. The authors cited all try to understand "mental processes," and they refer to various operations of the "mind" - "displacing aggression" or "project- ing bitterness." A more worthwhile approach might be to take Schafer's suggestions and forget about the "mind" while concentrating on observ- able actions and stated intentions. Our model, I think, need not be Freud the theorist but rather Freud the clinical analyst, that most astute observer, who, according to Schafer, "spoke a different language - a purposive or intentionalistic language, or, in my terms, a rudimentary action language" (104). Clinician Freud discovered that his patients' actions, whether di- rectly observable or not, communicated information: the most superficial tic might, upon investigation, convey the most profound wishes and emo- tions. In the analytic setting, Freud spoke with people about actions done and undone, about love and hate, about play and work, not about "regres- sion in the service of the ego" or "hyper-cathected fantasies." Of course, historians cannot, nor should we want to, participate in a "therapeutic relationship" with our subjects,34 but we can carry on an historical dialogue in the language of that clinical practice. Limited always by pre- existing information, we can "ask" our actors what they intended by their actions, and we can rely on the same range of data - conscious statements of intention, records of dreams, even behavior in rituals -- that analysts use. We should study historical groups psychoanalytically by employing an 33. Ibid., 145.

In the example of Salem, historians might take a fresh look at the accusing girls, whose antics grab the headlines while their subtler influence goes unnoticed. E. W. Taylor once declared that the girls' acts were purposive yet involuntary, and he suggested that, aware of the enormity of their own crime (Betty Parris and Abigail Williams, at least, had been trying to tell the future), they tried to deal unconsciously with their guilt by having fits which en- abled them to maintain their good standing in the community while they defended themselves against their own and the community's (expected) reproaches.35 We cannot prove Taylor's hypothesis about neurotic splits, but we can follow his lead by looking at the actions of these people who violated norms which they continued to hold dear. Were the fits random, or did they follow specific stimuli? How did the girls react to different adults? Did they always act by having fits, and if not, when didn't they? How did they perceive their actions, and what was the quality of their explanations? To aid in our task, we may wish to ask psychoanalysts several germane questions. How do people who claim they have traduced their own and their society's values feel? What fantasies do they have, and how do they perceive their actions? Are there any specific psychological tensions that generally occur, at least in our society, between mothers and daughters, and what are they? Are there people who claim to be bewitched now, and if so, what do they say about their feelings and actions? Of course, we cannot directly translate this data backwards; witchcraft meant different things to seventeenth-century people than it does to most of us. However, aware of this information which, using action language, we can compare to our data, we can return to the sources more sensitive to nuances they might yield. We can effectively use psychoanalysis to help us frame precise questions which we can answer meaningfully by presenting historical evidence. By making psychoanalytic and historical data comparable and more acces- sible to each discipline, by redefining the stances and subject matter of psychoanalysis, Roy Schafer disposes of some problems which have plagued interdisciplinary methodology. I think we can proceed to redefine the aims and method of this field. "Psychohistory" has remained an un- clear term which has been used to categorize those historical investigations using psychology, particularly psychoanalysis. Such inquiries have thus been defined by their technique rather than by their subject matter, with 35. E. W. Taylor, "Some Medical Aspects of Witchcraft" in C. M.

I prefer to speak of "psychological history," which, like social, economic, and political history describes a branch of historical investigation in terms of its subject matter and data, rather than its method. Psychological history encompasses the modes in which people have acted and the meanings they have attached to their actions. It is close to, but not identical with, intellectual history, which studies the formation and elabora- tion of consciously articulated ideas. Psychological historians can make statements about human intentions based on examination of human records and relying on the structure and expression of those records alone; they cannot determine the "mechanisms" which caused the intentions or the process involved in intending. Because action language expresses analytic insights but does not derive from them, it can communicate insights from other psychologies too; therefore, psychological historians can use knowl- edge from any psychological theory, not simply psychoanalysis, since the believability (not "proof") of their interpretations rests on their treatment of historical materials, not in recourse to theory. In returning human actors to their pre-eminent role in psychoanalytic theory, Schafer has created a language which sounds suspiciously under- standable, which in fact resonates with the cadences of everyday speech. Historians should recognize this language, with its emphasis on human endeavor; we have been speaking it for many years. The new language of psychoanalysis is history's native tongue.
