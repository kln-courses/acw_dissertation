<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> c h a p t e r  1 Allegory, Poetic Theology,  and Enlightenment Aesthetics Victoria Kahn Included in Giovanni Pietro Bellori’s Lives of the Modern Painters, Sculp- tors, and Architects (1672) is an engraving of an allegorical fi gure of “wise  imitation” (imitatio sapiens), which Stephen Halliwell has described in the  following way: “Classically draped and seated inside an architectural per- spective, [she] self-admiringly gazes into a mirror, symbol of her own ideal- ized potential, but simultaneously treads resolutely on an unprepossessing  ‘ape,’ traditional metaphor for the debasement of mimesis into the empty  simulation of a world of vulgarly refl ective surfaces.”1 This allegorical fi g- ure of imitation aptly illustrates two common (and ultimately entwined)  ways of telling the story of the relation of the Renaissance to the history  of aesthetics. One version is a story of the rupture with the Middle Ages  brought about by the recovery of the classical traditions of rhetoric and  poetics, and their various ideas of the imitation of nature or nature’s laws.  A second version concedes the superfi cial continuity of allegorical inter- pretation from the Middle Ages through the Renaissance, while emphasiz- ing the Renaissance break with habits of medieval allegorizing. Instead of  gods and goddesses in medieval dress, we fi nd a new sense of historical S anachronism and a new attention to the formal properties of ancient art N 31 31 F7027-Kottman_1stREV.indb   31 12/19/16   1:02:11 PM </page> <page sequence="2"> 32 Victoria Kahn and art more generally, properties which in turn provoke imitation on the  part of Renaissance artists. Particularly in this second story, Renaissance  art is described as gradually liberating itself from the theological strictures  of medieval theorizing and as anticipating something like the autonomy of  the eighteenth-century aesthetic artifact, with its formal purposiveness for  disinterested contemplation.2 Ultimately, as Bellori’s image suggests, these two stories are two aspects  of the same rich development of Renaissance art. But for the purposes of  this essay, I would like to tell the story of Renaissance aesthetics from the  perspective of the long history of allegorical interpretation, not least of all  because of the prominent role Kant has frequently played as the telos of  this narrative. In my version, however, this is a story not so much of rup- ture as of transformation, one in which Aristotelian and rhetorical ideas of  imitation commingle with late antique and medieval traditions of Neopla- tonic allegorizing. As in the other stories, so in this one the Renaissance  could be said to discover the autonomy of artistic form. But I argue that it  is conceding too much to the eighteenth-century discourse of aesthetics to  say that Renaissance ideas of form are important because they anticipate  Immanuel Kant, as Ernst Cassirer and Erwin Panofsky were wont to do.  Instead, it is better to see the Renaissance as helping us historicize the idea  of the aesthetic. That is, it helps us understand that the aesthetic is not a  Hegelian idea that achieves its full realization only at a certain moment in  history or indeed at the end of history. Instead, even as we concede that  something new emerges with the idea of aesthetic appreciation as disin- terested contemplation in the eighteenth century, it is possible to trace a  distinctive Renaissance engagement with questions of aesthetics that con- tributes to later notions of the autonomy of art, at the same time that it  complicates any attempt to locate the origin of aesthetics in the eighteenth  century. The use of the term aesthetics is not common in the scholarship on the  Renaissance. In the Renaissance, as in antiquity, art, it’s argued, was most  often seen in a moral, pedagogical, rhetorical, and pragmatic context rather  than being conceived in purely aesthetic terms.3 Although Renaissance  artists were just as preoccupied with the rhetorical and ethical failures of  art to persuade to virtue as with its successes, such rhetorical failure was,  according to this argument, not yet recuperated as a higher form of art:  the aesthetic conception of the work of art as an autonomous artifact de- signed for the sole purpose of the reader’s or viewer’s pleasure was still  S only rarely articulated.4 But perhaps in our attention to programmatic de- N fenses of poetry, explicit statements about the rhetorical function of art, or  32 F7027-Kottman_1stREV.indb   32 12/19/16   1:02:11 PM </page> <page sequence="3"> Allegory, Poetic Theology, and Enlightenment Aesthetics 33 examples of art’s failure to persuade, we have been looking in the wrong  places for the Renaissance contribution to the history of aesthetics. Once  we turn to the history of reading, specifi cally of allegorical hermeneutics,  we fi nd a new attention to the form-giving power of the artist and reader  that helps unhinge art from its previous rhetorical, ethical, and in some  cases theological frameworks in ways that have something in common with  aspects of the Enlightenment notion of the aesthetic. It is the argument of  this essay that we can track the gradual emergence of something like the  autonomous aesthetic artifact by looking to the history of allegorical inter- pretation from antiquity through the Renaissance. If, in antiquity and the  Middle Ages, allegory was a mode of reading both classical and Christian  texts, by the time of the Renaissance the dual infl uence of scripture and  classical culture led to a new historical consciousness of their differences  and to a crisis of how to read this dual heritage. Ancient, medieval, and Re- naissance writers distinguished between theological allegory and literary  allegory, between allegory as a description of the cosmos and allegory as a  rhetorical mode or product of human invention. The negotiation between  these two concepts of allegory and the eventual preeminence of the latter  in the Renaissance helped produce a new concept of literature and a new  concept of literary reading as inseparable from the artist’s and reader’s own  hermeneutical activity. The Renaissance focus on the interpretive activity  of giving form deserves as much of a place in the history of aesthetics as  the centrality of aesthetic contemplation and judgment in Kant’s account  of aesthetic experience. In the Renaissance history of aesthetics, the notion of poetic theology— the idea that the fi rst theologians were poets who concealed theological  truths under the allegorical veil of fi ction—had an important role to play.  This is because poetic theology condenses in one concept the complicated  relationship between theological and literary allegory. If poetic theology,  in the early Renaissance, is the hinge between theology and poetry, in time  it comes to signify the emergence of aesthetics from the bonds of theology.  Tracing the history of poetic theology and allegorical interpretation thus  helps remind us that the chief accomplishment of Renaissance culture was a  break with the medieval subordination of art to theology and metaphysics,  and a renewed attention to what Ernst Cassirer and Erwin Panofsky called  “the problem of form” and the form-giving capacity of human beings.5 Renaissance writers could have learned about the classical tradition of  poetic theology from Saint Augustine’s paraphrase of Marcus Terentius  Varro in The City of God. According to Augustine, Varro divided theology S into mythical theology (a poetic theology or theology of fables); physical N 33 F7027-Kottman_1stREV.indb   33 12/19/16   1:02:11 PM </page> <page sequence="4"> 34 Victoria Kahn theology (the theology of the philosophers attempting to explain the n ature  of the gods and the physical universe); and civil theology (the political the- ology used by the city). Augustine went on to criticize Varro’s effort to  distinguish between mythical and civil theology, arguing that mythical  theology—“the theology of the theater and stage”—is merely a part of  civil theology because “poetry and priestcraft are allied in a fellowship of  deception.”6 According to Augustine, the false gods of the ancients cannot  promise true happiness, which is to say eternal life; this can only be the  gift of the true God of Christianity. Renaissance writers took up the idea  of poetic theology as a way of negotiating the confl ict between antiquity  and Christianity, classical myth and Catholic theology, but it also proved  to be one avenue for the emergence of a new concept of art and literature  in the period. In elaborating their theories of poetic theology, Renaissance  writers drew on the ancient and medieval view of allegory as a practice of  reading as well as one of writing, and this practice proved to be a vehicle  of literary and, more broadly, cultural innovation. The history of poetic  theology and the related history of allegory both contributed to the emer- gence of a new concept of literature and the new discipline of aesthetics.  In order to understand how poetic theology and allegory facilitated these  developments in the Renaissance, we need to turn fi rst to antiquity and the  Middle Ages. Already in antiquity, as we see from Varro, something like poetic the- ology existed in the form of allegorical interpretation of myth and pagan  theology.7 Many Greeks and Romans evinced skepticism about the literal  truth of myth and of the pagan gods, but were willing to accept these  myths as poetic representations of deeper cosmological truths. The Stoics  read Homer as an allegory of cosmic forces, and Aristotle in the Metaphys- ics argued that previous generations had handed down ancient wisdom in  the form of myth.8 In late antiquity, Porphyry and Proclus developed an  allegorical hermeneutics predicated on the idea that great poetry, such as  Homer’s, was not mimetic in Plato’s sense but rather enigmatic and sym- bolic of higher theological truths. And Dionysius the Areopagite applied  Proclus’s ideas about allegory to Christian rituals and sacraments.9 In all  these cases, allegory could be considered the moral and philosophical an- tidote to myth, literally construed.10 As a technique of interpretation, al- legory saved classical mythology by making it possible “to associate the  most scandalous of narratives and bizarre details to deep truths.”11 In this  way, allegory preserved myth both for the ancients and for its later revival  S in Renaissance poetic theology and in romantic poetry.

For some, allegorical interpretation of myth was a  vehicle of critique and demystifi cation. In the third century BCE, Euhe- merus, nicknamed “the atheist,” explained the origin of myth in the super- stitions of popular religion and the divinizing of great men.12 In Cicero’s  De natura deorum, Vellius the Epicurean described Plato’s creator God in  the Timaeus as “a fi gment of the imagination,” and asserted, “When we  speak of Jupiter, we mean ether. When we speak of Ceres, we mean the  earth.”13 Vellius explicitly connected such “philosophical fantasies” of gods  who care for humans with the “fi ctions of the poets,” which he judged  to be superstitious and harmful.14 The Academic skeptic Cotta went even  further and argued against Vellius: “If [the gods] are real only as ideas in  our minds, and have no solidity or substantial form, what is the difference  between imagining god and imagining a centaur?”15 Cicero’s Stoic, Balbus,  who defended the existence of the gods, agreed with Vellius in condemn- ing the anthropomorphic understanding of the gods as “fable.”16 For Bal- bus, it was important to distinguish true religion from myth, interpreted  allegorically. To this, Cotta objected that if allegorical interpretations are  false, why engage in them, as the Stoics tended to do? “Whether the po- ets have corrupted the Stoic philosophers, or the philosophers have given  authority to the poets, it would be hard to say. They both deal in marvels  and monstrosities.”17 In Cotta’s view, “Such fables must be discredited, if  religion itself is not to be brought into confusion and disrepute.”18 Balbus’s and Cotta’s concerns received a new twist in the Christian  Middle Ages. As Étienne Gilson has observed, the specifi c problem for  Christianity was that its own truth was expressed not in the language of  philosophy, but in poetry.19 Christianity could not simply condemn the  fi gurative expressions of the Bible—for example, the biblical metaphor of  God as a lion—as Plato and Cotta had condemned myth. It was necessary  instead to fi nd a true meaning in such expressions, and this produced the  medieval allegorical interpretation of scripture. The allegorical interpreta- tion of the anthropomorphic God of scripture on the part of someone like  Origen (third century CE) was also designed to refute pagan philosophers  who charged that the biblical representation of God was indecorously  mythological.20 Some medieval theologians distinguished the scriptural use  of literary fi gures from secular literary allegory. In the Summa Theologica,  Thomas Aquinas contrasted the use of fi gurative language in poetry, which S N 35 F7027-Kottman_1stREV.indb   35 12/19/16   1:02:11 PM </page> <page sequence="6"> 36 Victoria Kahn simply hides its lack of truth, to the use of fi gurative language in scripture,  which makes the otherwise incomprehensible divine truth accessible.21 Even more important was the distinction drawn by Aquinas and oth- ers between theological allegory, the revelation of God’s truth in history,  and literary allegory, a mere rhetorical trope. For Hugh of Saint Victor  (twelfth century) and Nicholas of Lyra (fourteenth century), it was impor- tant to distinguish between fi gurative speech such as metaphor that is “part  of the literal sense of scripture,” and allegory that is a theological or spiri- tual dimension of meaning. Failure to do so led, in their view, to an arbi- trary, capricious multiplication of allegorical meanings based on the over- reading of the fi gurative language of the text.22 Aquinas, too, insisted that  literary allegory was confi ned to the literal dimension of the text, broadly  construed: “In no form of knowledge which is the product of human pow- ers is any but the literal sense to be found, but only in those Scriptures of  which the Holy Spirit is the author, man but the instrument. [Hence] . . .  poetic images refer to something else only so as to signify them; and so  a signifi cation of that sort goes no way beyond the manner in which the  literal sense signifi es.” As Denys Turner comments, Aquinas’s description  of poetic images applies to both secular literature and the literal dimension  of scripture, while true theological allegory is reserved to scripture alone  because such allegory “is not a semantic property of the words of Scripture,  but is the meaning of actual events . . . that Scripture narrates through  those words.”23 Theological allegory was an allegoria in factis, that is, it de- fi ned an allegorical relationship between earlier and later historical events.  Erich Auerbach called this kind of relationship fi gura, by which the events  in the Old Testament prefi gure those in the New.24 Whereas medieval theologians wanted to distinguish between theologi- cal and literary allegory, some medieval poets encouraged their confusion.  In an elegant argument too complicated to do justice to here, Albert R.  Ascoli has argued that Dante, as poet and reader of his own work, deliber- ately confl ated the allegory of poets and theologians, as well as allegory as  a mode of writing and allegoresis as a mode of reading. Through a process  of self-commentary, he made his own work the equal of the ancients and,  in doing so, gestured “towards modern notions of authorial refl exivity and  intentionality.”25 Similarly, Rita Copeland and Peter Struck have argued  that Guillaume de Lorris and Jean de Meun “found that they could play  with accepted distinctions between allegory as verbal trope and allegory  as theological or cosmological truth, in order to lay claim to much greater  S authority than traditionally accorded secular poetry.”26 The importance of  N the poet-theologian only increased in the Renaissance, not least because  36 F7027-Kottman_1stREV.indb   36 12/19/16   1:02:11 PM </page> <page sequence="7"> Allegory, Poetic Theology, and Enlightenment Aesthetics 37 of the enormous revival of interest in the literary achievements and poetic  theology of antiquity. But the greater prestige of vernacular poetry also  played a role, a prestige owing in large part to Dante. As Charles Trinkaus  has argued, “It is diffi cult to separate [poetry’s] new status from the enor- mous impact that Dante’s Divina Commedia had in the fourteenth century  within a generation of his death.”27 The consensus of intellectual historians is that, although the allegori- cal tradition of interpretation persisted in the Renaissance, the defi ning  characteristic of this period was a new perception of the historical dif- ference between antiquity and the present, and a new appreciation of the  distinctiveness of classical forms. Instead of using allegorical hermeneutics  to erase the difference between past and present, to paper over the enor- mous rupture created by the emergence of Christianity, and to insist on  a transhistorical continuity of meaning or “content,” Renaissance readers  and writers focused instead on what Cassirer has called “the problem of  form.” They focused, that is, on what in ancient culture resisted assimila- tion, fl aunted its anachronism, and in so doing provoked admiration and  emulation.28 I am in general agreement with this account of the period’s  defi ning virtues. But what I think deserves more attention is the shifting  role of allegorical interpretation in these developments. If, in the begin- ning of the Renaissance, allegory provided an overarching hermeneutic  that permitted the reconciliation of ancient texts and Christian doctrine,  in time the new profusion of classical texts and the Renaissance encounter  with them provoked a crisis of allegorical reading, further destabilizing the  distinction between theological and literary allegory. Instead of mediat- ing divine truth, poetic theology became a vehicle for attending to poetic  form. Instead, that is, of referring to a transcendent signifi ed, poetic theol- ogy tipped on its axis and became the name of a human capacity. In the  process, allegory as human invention supplanted allegory as a description  of the cosmos or as the revelation of truth in history. In time, allegory  became another name for the reader’s construction of meaning, as well as  a sign of the autonomous literary artifact. In these developments, the interpretation of classical myth had an im- portant role to play.29 The classical allegorical interpretation of myth was  known in the Middle Ages and Renaissance, but the problem posed by  ancient myth was now more complex than it was for ancient philosophers  because pagan allegory existed alongside the Christian tradition of the al- legorical interpretation of the Bible.30 For Renaissance humanists inter- ested in the recovery of classical texts, the problem of interpretation was S particularly acute. What was the relationship between classical literature N 37 F7027-Kottman_1stREV.indb   37 12/19/16   1:02:11 PM </page> <page sequence="8"> 38 Victoria Kahn and scripture, and what was the relationship between their modes of fi gu- ration? If both used allegory, how did one differentiate between them? A  relatively early fi gure like the Florentine chancellor Coluccio Salutati still  argued that, in contrast to pagan myth, which was literally false, or false  on the surface, scripture was true both literally and fi guratively.31 Later  humanists seemed less inclined to take this route, but this then made it  even more diffi cult to distinguish between scripture and myth. Whereas  the problem for ancient writers had been how to make sense of unruly an- thropomorphic gods and the fantastic elements of myth, the problem for  Renaissance writers was how to interpret classical myth allegorically in a  way that did not threaten the allegorical truths of the Christian religion— how, in other words, to distinguish one kind of allegory from another.  Given the etymology of allegory as speaking otherwise, we can say that the  Renaissance—with its psychomachia of Christianity and classical culture,  its confrontation with Christianity’s pagan other—is the preeminent alle- gorical moment. In one sense, allegory is always a response to a crisis of reading, a crisis  about the literal meaning of the text. But the Renaissance also precipitated  a meta-crisis of allegory, understood as the strategy for negotiating or re- solving the crisis of literal reading. One characteristic move in the psycho- machia of antiquity and Christianity that I have described was simply to  continue to argue (as had been done in the Middle Ages) that a classical  text such as Ovid’s Metamorphoses allegorized Christian morality. In argu- ing that pagan poetry contained theological truths that were compatible  with or anticipated the truths of Christianity, this kind of reading was a  form of poetic theology.32 But in reinterpreting classical texts allegorically  to fi t with Christianity, and thus in a certain sense leveling the distinction  between them, Renaissance humanists also exposed scripture to a reread- ing that threatened its unique revelation of divine truth. If in a fi rst move- ment poetic theology elevated ancient poetry to the level of theology, in a  second movement theology could itself be reduced to the level of fi ction.  Poetic theology, we could then say, was the solvent that produced literature  out of scripture. It’s this dynamic that I’d like to trace with reference to  three exemplary fi gures: Boccaccio, Ficino, and Erasmus. In the Genealogy of the Pagan Gods, Boccaccio declares that his intention  is to show “the art of the ancient poets and the consanguinity and relations  of the false gods.”33 In a fi rst move, the assertion of falseness turns the  theology of ancient myth into mere art. But although Boccaccio isolates  S literature, understood as “the art of the ancient poets,” by pointing to the  N 38 F7027-Kottman_1stREV.indb   38 12/19/16   1:02:11 PM </page> <page sequence="9"> Allegory, Poetic Theology, and Enlightenment Aesthetics 39 theological falseness of the pagan gods, he also uses the fi gurative dimen- sion of scripture to justify literature understood as secular poetry. If critics  of poetry condemn it as fi ction, he argues, they will also need to condemn  much of the Bible. For what the poets call fable or fi ction, “our theolo- gians” have named “fi gure,” “parable,” or “exemplum.”34 Boccaccio makes  no reference to Thomas Aquinas’s distinction between the fi gures of scrip- ture and of poetry; he is not talking about allegory in factis but about  the distinction between literal and fi gurative language. He does, however,  mention Varro’s argument about “physical theology”—the hiding of phys- ical and moral truths under pagan myth. Varro then allows Boccaccio—in  a second move—to recuperate the falseness of pagan literature, making it  available to Christian use. In the preface to the Genealogy, in response to  his patron’s request that he explain the meanings wise men have hidden  under their tales, Boccaccio comments, “Such interpretations are harder  than you think; they are properly the business of the theologian, for Varro  in treating of many matters both divine and human holds that such sub- jects constitute a sort of theology that may properly be called ‘mythical,’  or as others would say . . . physical.” And he adds that in view of “the large  element of absurd untruth in mythology, there is the more need of skill in  separating true from false.”35 Later, in book 15, he quotes Varro to support  his claim that some ancient writers were theologians of the pagan gods,  and that their moral teachings could in some instances be “employed in  the service of Catholic truth.”36 In this way, allegory comes to be identi- fi ed with fi guration and even fi ction, which pleases the unlearned on the  surface while it exercises the minds of the learned with its hidden truth.  That is, allegory and poetic theology require a certain labor of reading  and rereading. One wonders if Boccaccio is remembering here Cicero’s  etymological derivation of religio from relegere, to reread, an etymology  that Augustine repeated in The City of God.37 But instead of applying it to  scripture, Boccaccio applies it to the new religion of literature. In this way Boccaccio’s account of literature vacillates between a cogni- tive critique and an aesthetic defense. He recounts how, even as a child,  he knew “all pagan gods were devils” and disapproved of “their absurd  misdeeds,” but “their manner of worship aside, the character and words of  certain ancient poets have delighted me.”38 In a double movement of read- ing, he discounts the literal truth of these pagan tales but delights in their  poetic language. Elsewhere, Boccaccio emphasizes the harmless pleasure  of pagan fi ction—harmless because only a pagan would take seriously the  mythic representation of anthropomorphic, lustful gods. In this emphasis S N 39 F7027-Kottman_1stREV.indb   39 12/19/16   1:02:11 PM </page> <page sequence="10"> 40 Victoria Kahn on harmless pleasure Boccaccio suggests that Christianity immunizes the  reader and thus authorizes a space for secular literature understood as aes- thetic play. But if literature or poetry includes surface artistic embellishment, which  is pleasing in itself, it also points to hidden truths. Here Boccaccio dis- tinguishes between an inferior, merely aesthetic, pleasure and a superior  pleasure that conduces to moral and theological profi t. Anticipating what  later humanists would call poetic theology, Boccaccio asserts that poets  “won the name of theologians even among the primitive pagans.”39 In ar- guing for the moral, theological, and philosophical content of poetry, this  defense takes place under the auspices of Plato.40 At the same time, Boc- caccio frankly confesses that, where he has not been able to fi nd classical  interpretations of ancient myth, he has simply invented them. In allying  poetic theology with human invention, Boccaccio suggests that myth is  not so much the revelation of divine truth as the preeminent manifestation  of the human imagination. This tension between divine truth and human  invention is at work in later discussions of poetic theology as well, includ- ing in the Florentine Neoplatonism of Marsilio Ficino, the author of a vast  synthesis of Christianity and classical philosophy titled The Platonic Theol- ogy (completed in 1474 and published in 1482). The Neoplatonists were interested in reconciling Christianity not sim- ply with Greek and Roman mythology but with all religious traditions,  including foreign cults. As Jean Seznec has written, “Their attitude [was]  no longer one of rationalization [of ancient myth] . . . [but] of believers and  mystics, reverently teaching the depths of meaning within a sacred text.”41  It is for this reason, I think, that C. S. Lewis argued that Neoplatonists did  not so much read allegorically (if by allegory we understand personifi ca- tion) as symbolically or sacramentally. For Lewis, “the allegorist leaves the  given—his own passions—to talk of that which is confessedly less real,  which is a fi ction. The symbolist leaves the given to fi nd that which is  more real.”42 In a sense, one could say that, for Ficino, allegory is neither  the allegoria in factis of medieval scriptural commentary nor is it simply a  practice of reading. Instead, the cosmos itself is constructed as an allegory,  since lowly matter points to higher spiritual reality. Within such a struc- ture, the human soul is a “copula,” the bond that links matter and spirit in  human nature, which in turn serves as a microcosm of cosmic order.43 This view of the cosmos had implications for reading the works of an- tiquity. Above all, the Neoplatonists believed that Plato conveyed the same  S sacred truths as Christianity. This in turn meant that Plato himself both  N wrote allegorically and taught that poetry was enigmatic and should be  40 F7027-Kottman_1stREV.indb   40 12/19/16   1:02:11 PM </page> <page sequence="11"> Allegory, Poetic Theology, and Enlightenment Aesthetics 41 read allegorically.44 If one consequence of this hermeneutic was to lessen  the difference between philosophy and religion, Plato and Christ, or—to  borrow from Ficino’s title—Plato and theology, another consequence  was to diminish the distance between philosophy and religion, on the one  hand, and poetry, on the other. All were characterized by the distinction  between matter and spirit, that is, between the physical representation,  fi gure, or veil, and the hidden spiritual truth. It has been suggested that  Ficino’s conviction of the agreement between philosophy and religion fos- tered a general concept of natural religion that prepared the way for deism  and religious tolerance.45 But I think one could also argue, with Michael  Allen, that Ficino’s syncretism turned poetry into the preeminent mode of  philosophy and theology.46 Paul Oskar Kristeller argued that Ficino did not really have an aesthetic,  if by this we mean a discrete discourse on art as we now understand it.  I think this is true but only because the category of art has expanded in  Ficino to include all creative forms of human activity. Although Ficino  is regularly associated with Platonic idealism and the contemplative as- cent from the material world to the world of Ideas, there is a countervail- ing impulse in Ficino—as in Pico della Mirandola—to celebrate God as  not simply a creator but as a maker—an artist or artifex—whose activity  serves as a model and authorization of human artistic activity broadly con- strued.47 According to Ficino, such creative activity is itself evidence of the  immortality of the soul. Just as humans know God by knowing the divine  in themselves, in their own souls, so they know divinity in the human ac- tivity of culture or cultivation, both physical and spiritual. “Throughout  the whole globe how marvelous is [ man’s] culture of the earth!” Ficino  exclaims in book 13 of The Platonic Theology. “In inhabiting all the ele- ments and cultivating them all, he performs the offi ce of God [vicem gerit  dei].” And later he remarks that the “soul emulates all God’s works through  its various arts [per varias artes].”48 Among these cultural activities are  government and the liberal arts, including music, rhetoric, and poetry.49  Ficino also suggests that there is a creative dimension to the production of  philosophical texts and to the process of reading, by which we ascend from  the material reality of the text to higher spiritual truths. Like the poets, the  philosophers veil theological truths with fi gurative language, and it is the  task of the reader to discover the spiritual meaning through a diligent la- bor of allegorical interpretation: “Wherefore, since Plato had conveyed to  the youthful Dionysius certain divine mysteries under a veil, he enjoined  him fi rst to examine them diligently. . . . And he added furthermore that S the divine mysteries after more frequent, nay unending examination, are N 41 F7027-Kottman_1stREV.indb   41 12/19/16   1:02:11 PM </page> <page sequence="12"> 42 Victoria Kahn eventually and after great diffi culty and labor rendered pure and dazzling  like gold.”50 It is true that Ficino vacillates in his account of this process of  uncovering spiritual truths, sometimes attributing it to “diligent examina- tion,” and sometimes to “divine revelation.” But given what Ficino says  elsewhere about how the mind comes to recognize divinity within itself,  there may not be a substantial difference between the two. Thus, despite his emphasis on the contemplative ascent to contempla- tion of God, Ficino’s poetic theology contributed powerfully to the Re- naissance preoccupation with humanity’s form-giving capacity. This was  because, in Ficino’s view, the soul was itself a principle of form. As Ernst  Cassirer argued long ago, Ficino portrayed the human soul as the “copula”  or “vinculum” between God and the world because the soul contained an  innate “norm of beauty” that allowed it to perceive and judge the beauty  of the external world.51 And this in turn meant that Neoplatonism did not  simply authorize a contemplative stance toward the world; it also under- wrote the Renaissance preoccupation with man-made aesthetic forms: According to Ficino, the whole point of religious and philosophi- cal knowledge is nothing other than the eradication from the world of  everything that seems deformed; and the recognition that even things  that seem formless participate in form. But such knowledge cannot  content itself with the mere concept; it must be transformed into ac- tion, and prove itself through action. Here begins the contribution  of the artist. He can fulfi ll the requirement that speculation can only  state. Man can only be certain that the sense world has form and shape  if he continually gives it form. Ultimately, the beauty of the sensible  world does not derive from itself; rather, it is founded in the fact that it  becomes, in a sense, the medium through which the free creative force of  man acts and becomes conscious of itself.52 Cassirer went on to adduce Leonardo da Vinci as an example of this  approach: “O investigator of things,” says Leonardo, “do not praise yourself for  your knowledge of things brought forth by nature in its normal course;  rather enjoy knowing the aim and the end of those things designed by  your mind.” For Leonardo, this is science and art. Science is a second  creation of nature brought about by reason, and art is a second creation  brought about by the imagination. Reason and imagination no longer  confront each other as strangers; for each is simply a different manifes- S tation of the same basic power in man, the power to give form.53 N 42 F7027-Kottman_1stREV.indb   42 12/19/16   1:02:11 PM </page> <page sequence="13"> Allegory, Poetic Theology, and Enlightenment Aesthetics 43 In this way, Cassirer ultimately brings Ficino into the fold of those Renais- sance fi gures who anticipate the Kantian critique of judgment: The common characteristic joining the world of pure knowledge to  that of artistic creation [in the Renaissance] is that both are dominated,  in their different ways, by a moment of genuine intellectual generation.  In Kantian language, they go beyond any “copy” view of the given; they  must become an “architectonic” construction of the cosmos. As science  and art become more and more conscious that their primary function is  to give form, they conceive of the law to which they are subject more  and more as the expression of their essential freedom.54 Neoplatonism had a powerful impact on the Northern humanist, De- siderius Erasmus, who articulated its assumption about the relation of body  to spirit and drew out the implications of its practice of allegorical read- ing in the Enchiridion, or “Handbook of the Militant Christian” (1503).  Erasmus argued that reading the pagan poets and philosophers is a good  preparation for the Christian life, but only if one reads allegorically: “Just  as divine Scripture bears no great fruit if you persist in clinging only to the  literal sense, so the poetry of Homer and Virgil is of no small benefi t if  you remember that all this is allegorical.”55 Like Ficino, Erasmus believed  that the philosophers state what is contained in a different manner in the  holy scriptures. And, like Ficino, Erasmus recommended “the Platonists”  the most highly: “Because in most of their ideas and in their very manner  of speaking they come nearest to the beauty of the prophets and of the  Gospels.”56 As Erasmus later explains, he is referring here to “the fi gura- tive language that [the Platonists] use, abounding in allegories, [which]  very closely approaches the language of Scripture itself.” Reading ancient  philosophy and poetry in fact provides a kind of literary training for read- ing scripture allegorically. “Of course,” Erasmus adds, whatever one fi nds  in the Platonists should “be related to Christ.”57 It is not surprising, then,  that among scriptural commentators, Erasmus recommended those who  “go as far as possible beyond the literal meaning”: “Origen, Ambrose, Je- rome, and Augustine.”58 But Erasmus himself went even further, arguing  that perhaps more was to be gained from reading myth allegorically than  reading the Bible literally (“Immo fortasse plusculo fructu legetus poetica  cum allegoria, quam narratio sacrorum librorum, si consistas in cortice”).59  As Jean Seznec has commented on this passage, “Neoplatonic exegesis,  which had presented [Renaissance humanists] with hitherto undreamed-of  possibilities of reconciliation between the Bible and mythology, had now S N 43 F7027-Kottman_1stREV.indb   43 12/19/16   1:02:11 PM </page> <page sequence="14"> 44 Victoria Kahn so obscured the distinction between the two that Christian dogma no lon- ger seemed acceptable in anything but an allegorical sense.”60 Although  Erasmus did not go so far, in questioning the literal reading of Christian  doctrine, allegorical reading could ultimately point to a radical questioning  of the truth of Christian religion. The explosive implications of these insights can be seen in the later lit- erature of the Renaissance, where classical myth is no longer sublated by  Christian doctrine through allegorical reading but anticipates something  like the autonomy of the aesthetic artifact. To cite just three examples, we  see this in Marlowe’s Faustus’s conjuring of Mephistopheles and Helen  of Troy, and in Milton’s catalogue of pagan gods in Paradise Lost. In the  fi rst case, Marlowe prefaces the Latin spell that summons Mephistopheles  from hell with Faustus’s own gorgeous poetry, thereby inviting the reader  or viewer to associate Faustus’s magic with the magic of poetry, as well as  with theater’s capacity to invent and bring to life fi gures such as Mephis- topheles. Mephistopheles in turn encourages Faustus’s tendency to sus- pend Christian belief and treat scripture as mere literature, not least of all  by presenting the allegory of the seven deadly sins not as moral instruction  but as mere entertainment. If from one perspective, this allies aesthetic  pleasure with the devil, from another it shows skepticism about religion in  which the suspension of Christian belief morphs into literary experience.  As Graham Hammill has argued, “Faustus’s blasphemy develops a sense  of language that completely reformulates theological belief.” What makes  Doctor Faustus “tragical” according to Hammill is “less Faustus’s renuncia- tion of God and pact with Lucifer than the relation it establishes between  Faustus and the literary, a relation that makes the literary, as the site of  what Eliot called blasphemy, tragically inescapable.”61 In a less tragic vein,  Richard Halpern has commented on Faustus’s summoning of Helen of  Troy: “For Marlowe, as for Faustus, the problem of the phantom Helen  is at one level the problem of classical culture as such, which appears as  a source of beauteous splendor and as a dangerous pagan delusion”: “as  phantom or eidolon, [Faustus’s Helen] lacks substance and, as a representa- tive of a culture ‘cancelled’ by Christianity, she cannot serve as a reposi- tory of transcendent values.” But precisely because “Helen” does not al- legorically represent transcendent value, she foregrounds Marlowe’s own  invention. As Halpern writes, “The spell cast by her beauty is akin to that  produced by the work of art,” including Marlowe’s own.62 Milton might have been thinking of Marlowe when he associated his  S devils with art in book 1 of Paradise Lost. Milton fi rst wittily plays on the  N 44 F7027-Kottman_1stREV.indb   44 12/19/16   1:02:11 PM </page> <page sequence="15"> Allegory, Poetic Theology, and Enlightenment Aesthetics 45 Euhemerist critique by suggesting that the pagan gods were originally not  important men but rather devils.63 But in his metapoetic refl ections about  the building of Pandemonium and elsewhere, Milton also suggests, in Da- vid Quint’s words, “that the imagination is a potential entry point for the  diabolical into human experience”: “Milton must summon the devils into  poetic being in order to warn a reader who . . . is fi gured as unaware of  them. But he runs the risk of fascinating the reader with that very poetic  creation.”64 Although Quint does not make this argument, one implica- tion of this analysis is that the representation of God is just as poetic or  fi ctional as that of the devils. Another is that this elevation of poetry above  theology or in place of theology is precisely what Milton intended. Gor- don Teskey suggests as much when he places Milton at “the threshold of  a post-theological world,” and argues that his poetic power derives from  “a rift at the center of his consciousness over the question of creation it- self.” Milton is “the last major poet in the European literary tradition for  whom the act of creation is centered in God and the fi rst in whom the act  of creation begins to fi nd its center in the human.”65 To use the terms I  elaborated at the beginning of this essay, Milton dramatizes the transition  (or at least the diffi culty of maintaining the distinction) between poetic  theology as divinely inspired poetry and as poetry that enacts the fi ction of  the divine. But even if we do not want to go so far, it seems clear that for  Milton, as for Erasmus, literature itself is capable of being the vehicle of  spiritual insight if read in the correct fashion, and this in turn suggests that  what distinguishes scripture from other works is a habit of reading rather  than any intrinsic features of the text.66 In Milton’s universe, hermeneutics  constitutes one’s relation to God: More radically, God himself might even  be constituted through the activity of interpretation. In the process, the  form-giving capacity of the human mind becomes the central preoccupa- tion of both poet and reader. Sanford Budick has argued that Kant’s conception of aesthetic judg- ment and in particular of the analytic of the sublime was profoundly infl u- enced by his reading of Milton. This reading was shaped by a generation  of German Miltonists, for whom Paradise Lost was the supreme literary  masterpiece of the Renaissance and the supreme instance of sublimity in  poetry. But Kant was unique in linking Milton to his philosophical account  of the aesthetic as purposeful purposelessness, that is, as a formal structure  (rather than a specifi c content) that was ultimately internal to the mind.  Kant, according to Budick, saw in Milton’s poetry the transcendence of  the mere copy view of art and the dramatization of a poetic process of S N 45 F7027-Kottman_1stREV.indb   45 12/19/16   1:02:11 PM </page> <page sequence="16"> 46 Victoria Kahn Nachfolge—a kind of imitation or emulation that achieves originality and  in doing so exemplifi es in formal terms the moral autonomy of the freely  self-determining subject.67 Although Budick’s analysis of Kant’s indebtedness to Milton is unusual  for its philosophical rigor, the insight at the heart of his analysis—his focus  on the new centrality of form and the form-giving capacity of the hu- man mind as keys to the emergence of the eighteenth-century discourse  of aesthetics—is shared by some of the most important twentieth-century  scholars of the Renaissance. As we’ve seen, early in the twentieth century,  both Panofsky and Cassirer argued that whereas the Middle Ages appreci- ated the content of ancient culture, Renaissance artists attended to its for- mal qualities as well. And for both, this attention to form was the fi rst step  toward what Kant called aesthetic judgment. One of Panofsky’s main argu- ments about the Renaissance prehistory of aesthetics, seconded by Cas- sirer, is that the period effected a divorce between the pulchrum and the  bonum, the beautiful and the good, and thus liberated art from its medi- eval subordination to theology and metaphysics. At the same time, Renais- sance artists strengthened the tie between the pulchrum and the verum,  understood as the true representation of nature or nature’s laws, thus an- ticipating the rule-governed conception of artistic genius prominent in  Kant and eighteenth-century aesthetics more generally. For Panofsky, this  divorce was achieved not simply by a focus on art as a craft but also by a  new emphasis on the imitation of nature, as opposed to Platonic ideas.68  Whereas Plato had been critical of art as mimesis at two removes of the  eternal Ideas, early Renaissance art theorists such as Alberti conceived of  the “idea” in Ciceronian terms as a mental construct, an idea of proportion  or harmony, which was derived from nature and also gave the artist the  confi dence to imitate nature.69 In Alberti, “the autonomy of the aesthetic  experience . . . was recognized de facto even if not de jure.”70 Cassirer argued  in a similar vein that for Leonardo, “the power of the mind, the power of  artistic and of scientifi c genius does not reside in unfettered arbitrariness  but in the ability to teach us to see and to know the ‘object’ in its truth,  in its highest determination. Be it as artist or as thinker, the genius fi nds  the necessity in nature.” For Cassirer this development was part of a larger  narrative about the emergence of the aesthetic: “Centuries elapsed before  this principle was formulated in all its theoretical clarity, i.e. before the  ‘critique of judgment’ could formulate the principle that genius is the gift  of nature through which ‘nature in the subject’ gives the law to art. But the  S path towards this objective was now clearly indicated.”71 N 46 F7027-Kottman_1stREV.indb   46 12/19/16   1:02:11 PM </page> <page sequence="17"> Allegory, Poetic Theology, and Enlightenment Aesthetics 47 I will quarrel in a moment with Cassirer’s elision of the difference be- tween the Renaissance idea of artistic creation, of giving form to the art  object, and Kant’s idea of aesthetic judgment, which is famously indifferent  to the existence of the object.72 But I also think that Panofsky and Cassirer  were right to emphasize the emergence of a new idea of aesthetic auton- omy in this period. As I’ve argued in the preceding pages, one signature of  the new autonomy of the aesthetic artifact in the later Renaissance was the  transformation of allegory. No longer a poetic vehicle of divinely authored  theological truths, allegory became instead a sign of the eminently literary.  In Paradise Lost, for example, Milton employed allegory in the encounter  between Sin and Death, an episode that in the eighteenth century was  alternately praised for its sublimity and condemned for its obvious artifi ce.  Allegory here is not a form of poetic theology, revealing the hidden truths  of the cosmos under a veil of fi ction. Instead, the allegory of Sin and Death  points self-referentially (Sin is described as “a sign”) to the deadly abstrac- tion of this rhetorical mode. At the same time, it celebrates the genial,  inventive power of the poet. Whether one sees the allegory of Sin and  Death as “very beautiful and well invented” or condemns it as unreal or  improbable in the context of epic (Addison did both), it foregrounds Mil- ton’s poetic achievement: In the fi rst case, we note the sublimity of Milton’s  imagination of Sin and Death; in the second case, we appreciate by contrast  “the realism” of the rest of the poem’s “epic surface.”73 If from one per- spective, then, the allegory of Sin and Death dramatizes the deadliness of a  certain kind of autonomous signifi cation (Sin as sign) or in more orthodox  theological terms the diabolical nature of the aesthetic as a category and  an experience divorced from God, from another perspective Milton could  be said to be consciously of the devil’s party, dramatizing his own aesthetic  powers of invention.74 Here we have moved entirely from one pole of al- legory (allegory as a structure of the cosmos) to the other (allegory as the  human invention of forms that would otherwise be unimaginable). If we now return to early twentieth-century genealogies of the aesthetic,  we can see that Panofsky and Cassirer were right to treat the Renaissance  preoccupation with form as an important moment in the history of aesthet- ics. But, as the preceding pages have shown, what Milton and others meant  by form was not the purposive purposelessness of Kant’s free beauty, which  the judging subject fi nds in (that is, ascribes to) the autonomous aesthetic  artifact. Nor was form understood in Kantian terms as a symbol of the  self-legislating subject who gives the moral law to himself. Instead, Re- naissance artists from Alberti to Milton celebrated the actual form-giving S N 47 F7027-Kottman_1stREV.indb   47 12/19/16   1:02:11 PM </page> <page sequence="18"> 48 Victoria Kahn capacity of the artist, while creating works of art whose beauty Kant would  have described as “dependent.” This is a beauty that does not produce  disinterested contemplation and is instead inseparable from the emotions  and concepts through which we make sense of our experience, including  ethical concepts and ideas of truth.75 As M. H. Abrams recognized long  ago, form for these Renaissance authors was a matter of construction more  than aesthetic contemplation, at least in Kant’s sense of the term. Kant’s  identifi cation of the experience of form with disinterested contemplation  thus represented a fundamental shift away from the powerful insights of  Renaissance artists into their own ability not simply to imitate, but to cre- ate new forms and new worlds.76 notes  1.

See Thomas Aquinas’s commentary on Peter Lombard’s Sentences (1  Sent., prologue 1, 5c and ad tertium), in which Aquinas sees metaphor as “com- mon to both poetry and theology,” a position he refi nes in the Summa Theo- logica (I, 1, 9 ad 1). E. H. Curtius gives the references to Aquinas and provides  an account of the medieval debate about poetic theology, specifi cally about  whether poetry can be conceived of as a form of theology or must instead be  distinguished from Christian theology, in European Literature and the Latin  Middle Ages (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1973), 217. In “Allegory  in Christian Late Antiquity,” in The Cambridge Companion to Allegory, ed. Rita  Copeland and Peter T. Struck (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press,  2010), Denys Turner argues that the distinction between theological and  poetic allegory advanced by Aquinas, Nicholas of Lyra, and Hugh of Saint  Victor was designed “to liberate theological allegory from its confusions with  the literary,” but “an untended consequence was in turn to liberate the liter- ary possibilities of allegory from their confusion with the theological” (82).

This kind of relation introduces a temporal dimension into al- legory, one that would provide a model for negotiating the vast temporal and  moral difference between pagan and Christian texts in the Renaissance. Just  as the Old Testament prefi gures events in the New, so it would be argued  pagan myth prefi gures the truths of Christianity.  25. See Albert R.

The appreciation of classical form was thus inseparable  from a new perception of the difference in historical periods, a new historical  self-consciousness. Formalism and historicism, so often thought to be op- posed, were in this case not antithetical but mutually enabling. Historicism,  that is, was not a cause of skepticism, nor did it imply a whiggish philosophy  of history. Instead, it signifi ed a newly confi dent appreciation of the objec- tive achievements of the past. In addition to fostering a new historical self- c onsciousness, the enlivening encounter with classical forms also produced a  new epistemology, ethics, and aesthetics.

Ernst Cassirer also emphasizes this aspect of Ficino in Individual and  the Cosmos: “Ultimately, the beauty of the sensible world does not derive from  itself; rather, it is founded in the fact that it becomes, in a sense, the medium  through which the free creative force of man acts and becomes conscious of  itself. Seen in this light, however, art no longer lies outside the province of  religion but rather becomes a moment of the religious process itself” (67). “In  [its] religious justifi cation of the world, . . . the Florentine Academy always  returns to the miracle of beauty, to the miracle of artistic form and of artistic  creation. And upon this miracle it founds its theodicy” (63), citing Platonic  Theology, 10.5; “The theodicy of the world given by Ficino in his doctrine  of Eros had, at the same time, become the true theodicy of art” (135). For  Ficino, however, philosophy was always a pia philosophia rather than an inde- pendent method of investigation, as was the case for Cusa (61).  48. Ficino, Platonic Theology, 14.248.  49.

In this essay Halpern is not  particularly interested in arguing that Marlowe is criticizing theology, but I  think this is one of the implications of his argument.  63.

Panofsky, Idea, 50, 65.  70. Ibid., 55. In the later Renaissance, by contrast, Panofsky argued,  Neoplatonism undermined this achievement by reverting to a concept of the  idea as transcendental and a priori, and insisting on providing a metaphysical  justifi cation of beauty.

Kant discusses dependent aesthetic judgments  in The Critique of Judgment, §16.  76. See M. H. Abrams, “From Addison to Kant,” on the shift from a  construction model of art to a contemplation model, and on the idea of a  heterocosm.
