<plain_text><page sequence="1">The ontology of being and spiritual power in the stone monument cults of the Lowland Maya ELIZABETH A. NEWSOME Thanks to a new generation of studies on Classic Maya art and inscriptions, researchers are now poised to delve more deeply into the system of metaphysical thought that underlies Maya spiritual belief and practice than would have been conceivable only a decade ago. Since the 1980s, numerous contributions have greatly expanded our knowledge of the mythology, world view, and complex array of ceremonial behaviors that are evident in the archaeology and monumental record of the Lowland Maya during the Classic period (a.d. 199-909). In addition to resolving specific epigraphic or art historical problems, many discoveries have revolutionary implications for understanding ancient Maya concepts of being, space, and time. Among the findings that raise new questions in this area is the identification of a class of supernatural called "ways," companion spirits that permitted the souls of Maya lords to interact on an otherworldly plane during dreams and other altered states of consciousness (Houston and Stuart 1989; Grube and Nahm 1994).1 Studies of toponymns naming what appear to be supernatural locations have generated new understandings, and new questions, about the sacred geography of the Maya universe (Stuart and Houston 1994). The insights these discoveries disclose offer scholars an opportunity to broaden their disciplinary perspectives on the ancient Maya and to move back from studying the particular interpretation of glyphs, architectural settings, and visual symbols to address the more general philosophical constructs that underlay Maya conceptions of reality. Cosmology has long been of interest to Mesoamerican researchers, but the possibility of addressing a fuller set of questions, including the study of ontology, or the definition of being, has begun to emerge as a consequence of these recent discoveries. Scholars can at times apply the study of ontological conceptions to cultural phenomena that would appear to be categorically quite different from those researchers would normally associate with philosophical issues of "being." Attempting to explain the apparent paradoxes that such problems present can also offer surprising insights into some of the more elusive aspects of a society's cultural remains. The topic of this study is a case in point, for the stone monuments that the Classic Maya erected in the courtyards and plazas of their cities, and which are among the most distinctive products of their civilization, appear an unlikely subject for ontological consideration (fig. 1). Yet exploring their significance with respect to the way Maya society defined spiritual properties of "being" promises to illuminate certain of the most mystifying aspects of its royal cults. These include the characteristic association of rituals of dynastic accession with the erection of stelae, upright stone slabs paired with monolithic "altars" of various forms. It offers an explanation as well for the widespread Maya ceremonial practice of erecting a stela-altar pair to commemorate a ruler's acts of blood sacrifice and vision quest on the completion of a major calendrical cycle. The conceptual link between rulership, freestanding stone sculptures, and dynastic and temporal rites of passage lies in a realm of spiritual associations the Maya identified with their stone monuments and related types of directional shrines.2 1. Interest in the soul as described in Maya art and epigraphic sources originated in the late 1980s, when David Stuart (see Schele 1989), William Ringle (1988), and John Carlson (n.d.) independently arrived at a reading of the God C glyphic expression (T1016) as Wu or ch'u in the modern Yucatec and Choi Mayan languages. The terms, which are linguistic cognates, have meanings that range from "god" to "divinity," "holiness," and "spirit." Following this development, Stephen Houston, David Stuart, and Nikolai Grube (see Schele 1989) produced simultaneous readings for a glyphic compound that features the face of a Maya lord {ahau) half covered with jaguar pelt, which they interpreted phonetically as way. The ways, or "spiritual coessences," that Houston and Stuart (1989) identify include a wide array of supernatural depicted on painted Classic vases and in various media of monumental art. The authors believe that they represent the familiar spirits or "coessences" of the shamanistic kings of the Classic period. Nikolai Grube and Werner Nahm (1994) have contributed further studies in this area. These findings, which generated renewed interest in Maya metaphysics, have inspired numerous subsequent works. 2. One of the most important findings in this area emerged in the mid-1980s, when epigraphers working at Copan began to identify glyphic expressions that designated stelae, altars, and other cultic objects, such as stone incensarios and vases. In addition to isolating the phrases that recorded the nouns for these terms, research by Stuart (1986) and others revealed that the ancient Maya accorded these objects proper names, recorded in self-referential passages of their texts. These statements normally record the monument's erection or dedication, followed by the name of the object, and a final glyphic expression that Judy Maxwell has interpreted as u k'u k'aba, meaning "is its (the monument's) holy name" (see Schele 1989). Most interesting are the correlations between the names assigned to stelae</page><page sequence="2">116 RES 33 SPRING 1998 Figure 1. View of stelae and altars in the main plaza, Quirigua, Guatemala. From Sharer (1990). Reprinted by permission. Examining evidence drawn from ethnohistorical, art historical, and epigraphic sources leads to the conclusion that the ancient Maya ascribed a set of qualities and attributes to these monuments that defined them as "beings" within the scope of their ontological universe. As such, stelae and altars would have been accorded special ritual treatments and precautions related to their identification with spiritual identities, influences, and powers. Assemblies of these monuments articulate the ritual environments of most ancient Maya ruins, chronicling the periodic rites and dynastic histories of rulers who governed a constellation of autonomous kingdoms. The royal portraits that dominate their main surfaces and the dated historical information recorded in their texts comprise a major component of the raw data available to epigraphers working to decode the political history of the Maya Lowlands. Although related to precedents in Mesoamerica's Preclassic Olmec and Pacific Slope cultures, the specialized features of the Lowland Maya stela cult are unique to both Maya culture and its political and social organization during the Classic period. Stelae are so intimately related to the religious institutions that gave Classic Maya kingship permanence and power that scholars have long regarded them as a diagnostic marker of the Classic Maya's rise, duration, and decline. The extinction of the stela complex in the tenth century accompanied the catastrophic collapse of the civilization itself, as worsening social and environmental conditions precipitated the fall of kingdoms across the southern Lowlands, from Palenque to Copan (fig. 2). The last dated stela erected at the site of Tonina in a.d. 909 marks the end of the Classic era of Maya history. Maya civilization would flower again in northern Yucatan during the Postclassic, reorganized around different institutions and symbols of politicoreligious power. Although many of the religious concepts and practices of the Postclassic and colonial Maya mirror those central to the stela cult, the sculpted pillar of stone became an obsolete and distantly remembered object of power, replaced in royal patronage by other formats for monumental display.3 Stelae assume a variety of shapes and forms throughout the Maya area and are subject to a range of surface treatments. Most are narrow slabs with squared off or rounded corners and flattened, prismatic surfaces; others are rather cylindrical or columnar in shape. Numerous stelae are plain, uncarved shafts of stone, and it is unclear whether any of these were plastered, painted, or otherwise adorned. Many are sculpted in relief, the depth and three-dimensionality of their carving determined by regional canons of style. Some and altars and the iconographie elements of their design, such as "sun-eyed throne-stone" for Altar U at Copan, which is sculpted as a zoomorphic effigy that features glyphs for k'in, or "sun," infixed in its eyes (Stuart 1986). Stuart's research has shown that self-referential statements of this nature form key portions of monument texts and often comprise the "foregrounded" information of their inscriptions. The implications of this understanding have only begun to be addressed by art historical and epigraphic research, which, in future studies, may yield a new set of understandings regarding the spiritual concepts the Classic Maya associated with the names and iconographies of their sculptural monuments. 3. The transition from the civilization of the Classic Lowlands south of Yucatan to the Postclassic florescence in the north is marked by distinct shifts in formats of sculptural display. The ongoing Classic Maya emphasis upon freestanding stela and altar dedications is replaced by a preference for architectural reliefs, including sculpted temple jambs, relief benches, and architectural columns and piers. Studies of these shifts and their implications with respect to the political and ritual institutions of the Postclassic have been written by Jeff Kowalski (1995) and Linnea Wren (1995).</page><page sequence="3">Newsome: The ontology of being and spiritual power 11 7 stelae are purely hieroglyphic, displaying panels of inscriptions arranged as grids of rectangular glyph blocks. Figurai stelae are more common, one or more of their surfaces displaying an image of the ruler who commissioned the monument, occasionally accompanied by subsidiary figures and panels of hieroglyphic texts (fig. 3a-b). Figures are usually shown in a modified profile view, although frontal figures are common in the stelae of the southeast Maya zone. The rulers' portraits show the rulers engaged in a characteristic typology of ritual acts, which include dominating a bound captive to be offered as a sacrifice to the gods (fig. 3b), scattering pellets of copal incense or drops of sacrificial blood, and displaying a variety of scepters, staffs, and other regalia that signify the sources of their power (fig. 3a). Royal acts of autosacrifice were accomplished by perforating the tongue or penis; however, although recorded in the stela texts, the king's self-mutilation is never graphically portrayed.

Hieroglyphic texts complement the monument's iconography, describing the king's ritual actions, citing the dedication of the monument itself, and providing dates for these and related events. Stelae are most frequently paired with circular stone altars, which may feature images of captives trussed for sacrifice or the day sign Ahau, standing for the cycle's ending date (fig. 4a-b). Some altars, such as those of the southern sites of Copan and Quirigua, are carved as effigies of fantastic supernatural beasts (fig. 4c-d). Positioned at the base of the stela on its principal side, altars frequently have clear iconographie and thematic connections to the stelae they accompany, and they were intended to be viewed as part of a unitary whole.

At Copan, for example, the giant turtle-effigy altar of Stela C's west side (fig. 5) corresponds to an iconographie complex that shows a variant of the Maize God known as the Holmul Dancer emerging from the broken carapace of a tortoise (fig. 6). As the tortoise is a symbol for the earth, the combined imagery functions as a metaphor for the Maize God's rebirth as the germinating plant. In the iconography of Stela C, the monument's patron ruler, nicknamed 18-Rabbit-God K, wears and displays elements that correspond to the Holmul Dancer costume and myth. From the vantage point of an observer standing before the monument's west side, the king's figure appears to emerge from the turtle altar, just as the Holmul Dancer shown on the painted ceramic plate in figure 6 is resurrected from the animal's cracked shell. Together, the stela and altar suggest the king's ritual impersonation of this god, perhaps as part of a dramatic performance that reenacted the myth of his sacrifice and rebirth. Thus the two monuments were designed to function as a single visual statement, dependent upon the viewer's ability to recognize their iconographie relations. The altar of Stela 4 from the same site is likewise thematically related to the imagery of its companion Figure 5. Stela C at Copan, west side view with Great Turtle Altar.

The colossal altar is an effigy of the solid rubber ball used to play a common Mesoamerican ballgame that had mythological associations with sacrifice and cosmic origins. The king's performance in this instance may relate to an ancient version of the mythology preserved in the colonial Maya creation epic known as the Popul Vuh. A pivotal episode of the myth concerns the sacrificial death of the twin maize gods One and Seven Hunahpu, who die after losing a ballgame to the Lords of Death in Xibalba, the Maya underworld. 18-Rabbit appears in the iconography of the stela clad in a heavy belt that is reminiscent of the protective waist padding worn by players in this violent, ritualistic game. Here, as in Stela C, the king appears to assume the role of a protagonist in the myth and reenacts one of its most important events. Arrayed as the</page><page sequence="5">Newsome: The ontology of being and spiritual power 119 losing player, he is prepared for sacrifice, bound by ropes as though he were a captive taken in a military raid. Such captives were destined for sacrifice to the gods and were often slain in ritual reenactments of the game (Miller and Houston 1989). The king displays the symbols of ballgame sacrifice as part of his penitential rite, indicating that he will let his own blood to share in the mythic defeat and resurrection of the gods. The Stela 4 altar, then, functions as a key iconographie component of the rite the stela commemorates, furnishing the mythic and ritual context for the ruler's autosacrifice. The ancient Maya most commonly dedicated their stela-altar pairs at the culmination of twenty-year cycles known as katuns, although their dates may also correspond to lesser intervals of five, ten, or fifteen years that formed the katun's internal divisions. The Maya believed in a universe that had been successively created and destroyed by the gods, who renewed the sacred structure of time and space at the inception of each new world. To articulate this vision of cosmic history, they devised a calendrical system known as the Long Count, which reckons time elapsed in multiples of twenty since the beginning of the present creation. Time was recorded in units of kins (days), uinals (months), funs (360-day years), katuns (20 tuns), and baktuns (400 funs) since the day 4 Ahau 8 Cumku, the date of cosmogenesis. As founding acts of creation, the gods established the world's order as a quadripartite structure divided by cardinal directionality, with world quarters aligned to the east, north, west, and south cardinal points. Associated with each world quarter were particular gods who regulated the seasons, wind, rain, and all natural phenomena related to fertility and rebirth. These included the four Chacs, gods of lightning and rainstorms, as well as four Bacabs or Pauahtuns, Atlantean gods who supported the heavens above the earth. Sacred trees of life grew at each of the cardinal points as well, providing everlasting sources of abundance. Temporal periods were assigned to the directions as time itself cycled through the world quarters in a never-ending circuit of creation. As a result, the cycles of the calendar also manifested quadripartite divisions, such as the quartering of the katun into five year periods. Gods who governed the four directions reigned over the units of time that passed within their cosmic domains, giving them their character and destiny. While researchers have long understood the association between stelae-altar dedications and the katuns of Maya history, what has been missing from their Figure 6.

The larger question that overarches these concerns is the way these events were further linked to the cosmic vision inherent in the perpetual celebration of the katuns. Why did Maya lords periodically exalt their kingship in this way? Why commemorate period endings with the dedication of one or multiple stelae? Portrait stelae might be easily enough explained as documents that preserve or promote the king's pious rituals of sacrifice or his communication with the gods. But what association would account for the innumerable plain, unadorned stone pillars that were dedicated without textual or figurai decoration? How might one explain the assemblies of uncarved stelae and altars that stand aligned in the twin pyramid complexes of Tikal, architectural settings constructed specifically for particular katun endings and apparently abandoned when their festivities were concluded? Yet if stelae and altars are inherently related to calendrical celebrations, what leap of understanding would explain why they were also dedicated to sanctify a ruler's accession to office? These questions would appear to defy explanation, for they do not harmonize with views of stelae and altars that have long received implicit acceptance in the history of Maya scholarship. They imply that a missing factor must exist in our understanding of the metaphysical basis of Maya reality, a meaningful link that would account for the coincidence of rulership, period endings, and markers made of stone. Before this issue can be addressed, certain of the conventional views of stelae and altars that have prevailed in the history of Maya research must be reexamined so that the problems concerning them may be redefined. Surprisingly, little scholarly attention has focused upon determining the role and meaning of freestanding monuments in Classic Maya society. The history of scholarship has dealt vaguely with the sculptures themselves, addressing facets of what their dates, iconography, or texts can reveal about such matters as ritual and dynastic history. Issues regarding the meaning and purpose of stone monuments and their relationship to Maya conceptions of sacredness and power have never been formulated as topics of discussion but exist at the level of underlying assumptions shaped by various authors' views of Maya society and the objectives of their research. For example, the commentary of such pioneering scholars as J. Eric Thompson and Sylvanus Morley reflects their notion that stelae and other sculptural monuments served primarily as memorials to the Maya preoccupation with the mysteries of time. Their views on the value of interpreting stone monuments were molded by their assumption that the Maya were a theocratic society ruled by a caste of astronomer-priests who specialized in the mystical associations of a complex calendar. Consequently, they devoted little discussion to iconography, believing that the monuments portray only priestly impersonators and unknown gods. Likewise, they dismissed the noncalendrical portions of monument texts as a hopelessly indecipherable litany of homages to the calendar, the gods, and time. In contrast, the historical and political perspectives that have shaped the course of Maya scholarship since the 1960s have required rigorous methods of iconographie and epigraphic interpretation. Yet these perspectives have also engendered views of the purposes of stone monuments that may be misleading and research methodologies that can reinforce basic misconceptions. The most misleading factor that surfaces in contemporary scholarship concerning Maya sculptural monuments is an underlying assumption that their principal significance lies in providing a highly visible surface for display. Little attention has focused upon questions that concern the inherent meaning or purpose of a monument itself, either as an artistic expression that realizes a concept of spiritual potency or as an object that fulfills paradigms of ritual action. The trend in iconographie studies has been to view stone monuments, particularly stelae, as "billboards" for royal portraits and the symbolism of rites that affirmed dynastic succession and legitimated power. Scholars have treated the monuments like political posters in stone that promoted the agendas of the kings who raised them, or in a more passive sense, merely documented rites that justified or demonstrated the right to reign. The legal ism of these arguments has partial validity, but the observation that the majority of stelae dedicated throughout the Maya Lowlands are plain immediately invalidates any simplistic view of the social needs they served. Indeed, I suspect that the "billboard" supposition is conditioned to some degree by research methodologies that involve exhaustive concentration upon iconography and texts, inventoried through drawings and photographs that distance the monuments from the context in which they appear. Side-effects of</page><page sequence="7">Newsome: The ontology of being and spiritual power 121 Figure 8. Altar of Stela D at Copan, (a) Front (south) view, (b) East side view. Photos: Elizabeth Newsome. these methods include a singular emphasis on the content of texts and imagery, which takes little account of the sculpture as a meaningful whole. This emphasis also contributes to a tendency for scholars to lump all media of sculptural representation into a single category, as though works as different as carved lintels, stelae, altars, and relief panels may be subject to one type of approach. Authors tend to deal with them all in the same way, irrespective of their setting, purpose, and intended viewer response. The freestanding sculptures that were the focus of Maya monumental cults were erected as lasting installations fashioned to articulate, and in certain respects, to activate settings for sacred experience. They formed nodes in spaces that the Maya shaped for the performance of ritual processes accomplished through distinct steps, events completed through human performance in structured ritual space and time. These involved sacred gestures and actions that mirrored divine events that occurred in the mythic past and were efficacious on a cosmic scale. Monuments such as the zoomorphic altars of Copan and Quirigua functioned as media through which sacred realities became manifest in these settings and were given palpable, animate form. These fantastic effigies, which often bear contrasting masks on their east and west or north and south sides, embody the cosmological principals of directionality and duality. They confront the observer with opposing fleshed and skeletal heads, incarnations of the Maya's fundamental notions of the inseparable unity of life and death. Hieroglyphic markings that adorn their masks and appendages express such fundamental contrasts as day (k'in, or "sun") and night (akbal, or "darkness") and allude to the opposing realms of the sky and earth (fig. 8a-b). The design of these altars is transformational, summoning from within the stone the inner appearances of the spiritual world that are masked by the tangible substance of reality. The faces that gaze out from their figurai surfaces reveal the countenance of the divine, embodying the ageless essence of gods who personify the light of the sun, the dark fecundity of the underworld, the brooding mountains of the Maya landscape, and even the animate spirit of stone. Approaching one of these sculptures automatically endows the viewer's experience of relating to the object with powerful psychic constructions of directional contrast and cosmic orientation, enhanced by the awe of supernatural encounter. Yet iconography is not the only vital element that comes into play during a viewer's confrontation with a freestanding sculptural form. Pure formal properties of design, such as the sculpture's three-dimensionality, volume, scale, mass, and autonomy as an object in space inform the viewer's perception of it as an entity vitalized by its own inner life. These unique qualities provide freestanding monuments with independence in the viewer's perceptual field that sets them apart from reliefs in other media, such as lintels and sculpted panels that accentuated architectural interiors or facades. In height and verticality, stelae may approximate the spatial dimensions of a human observer, evoking a subconscious transactional response.</page><page sequence="8">122 RES 33 SPRING 1998 The sizes and proportions of thrones and altars that rest low to the ground may subliminally suggest encountering a large animal, such as those that inspired the fantastic effigy altars described above. Iconography, while helping to externalize and reinforce these perceptions, is not essential to forming their basis; they preexist as a condition of perceiving the monuments in their abstract form. These qualities distinguish stelae and altars as belonging to a class of works in creative media that Robert Plant Armstrong (1971) has aptly described as "affecting presences." In The Affecting Presence: A Study in Humanistic Anthropology, Armstrong explores the interactional dynamics of meaning that unite the observer and works of art in a variety of media, which range from visual arts such as painting and sculpture, to media of performance such as movement, narrative, and sound. His study addresses the unique character of creative works that so strongly evoke the affective, intuitive dimension of culture and experience that members of the society associated with the work of art regard it as possessed of being, spiritual essence, and power. The affective, as Armstrong describes it, must be addressed directly, through metaphor rather than symbol, and is most powerfully evoked through the work of art that acts as an "affecting presence," one that realizes such an affective state in material form. Such a work is intentionally created to be affecting, and it does not represent an affective quality or state of being so much as it embodies or presents it. Within a society that is cocultural with the work, it is revered, held in awe, and treated in a ritualistic way that surrounds it with taboos, sanctions, and worship. It is treated as a being with supernatural powers: it may be hidden from public view, shown only on special occasions, placed in special locations, and offered sacrifices. Armstrong writes: The affecting presence acts as subject, asserting its own being, inviting the perceptor's recognition, and, in culturally permitted ways, structuring that subsequent relationship which someone has called "transaction" in recognition of the fact that while the presence informs the man, the man, in his unique way, to some extent and in some fashion informs the presence. ... It is not uncommon, however, to find that its sense of being is so acknowledged that the affecting presence is accorded special treatment? sometimes it receives the attentions and services accorded a person: it may, as is true of some of the sculptured figures and masks of West Africa, be bathed, clothed, fed, and, when its usefulness has ended, buried. Indeed, in certain kinds of magical situations, it can be "sickened," "deprived," "wounded," or "killed." Armstrong 1971:25 According to Armstrong's interpretation, works that act as "affecting presences" within a culture may be identified and examined through the kinds of ritual behaviors that surround their creation and use. Members of the society cocultural with the work should exhibit responses that demonstrate their perception of it as a being invested with consciousness or other characteristics of spiritual life. Special ritual precautions should structure the behavior of those who cross within the powerful area of interface that enjoins them to a work that evokes their culture's most latent, and therefore sacred, understandings of reality. Ethnography and archaeology attest to a spectrum of highly specialized ritual practices that the Maya employed in their use of types of directional and calendrical shrines that evoke the ancient associations of the Classic stela. One example is Bishop Diego de Landa's description of Postclassic Maya practices of revering the stone markers they called acantuns, or "stood-up stones." These freestanding directional markers, set up in association with community rites of renewal, are the closest counterparts in Postclassic ethnography to the stelae of the Classic period.4 The 4. The precise nature of the acantuns set up during the Postclassic Yucatec New Year festival is difficult to determine. Landa's description refers to them as "heaps of stone" that were set up at the directional entries to the towns of Yucatan (Tozzer 1941 ?139-140). Scholars have long recognized a correspondence between Landa's acantuns and the decorated pillars represented on pages 25-28 of the Dresden Codex (Vilacorta and Vilacorta 1996), commonly called the New Year's pages. Each of these constructions is a vertical column that rests upon a conventional hieroglyphic sign for tun, meaning "stone or year," and each is adorned in cloth or paper shrouds. The column shown on page 25 of the Dresden Codex (fig. 9) is covered completely by its cloth drapery but wears the mask of the codical version of Chac, God B. As Schele and Stuart (1986) point out, the visible shafts of three of the columns, those on pages 26-28, bear both the double bump markings that the Classic Maya used to identify objects made of wood and the circular cauac markings they used to indicate stone. Karl Taube (1988) refers to these markers as trees, based upon their association with symbols for wood and vegetation (three of them have a crown of conventionalized heart-shaped leaves). Thompson (1972) saw them as representations of acantes, or "stood up trees," which seem to have been wooden counterparts of the acantuns. Their cauac markings, however, are significant, and suggest that they refer to stone objects that are in some fashion analogous to the stelae of the Classic period.</page><page sequence="9">Newsome: The ontology of being and spiritual power 123 Yucatec Maya raised these shrines at the directional entries to their villages during the five unlucky days of Uayeb, their period of ritual preparation for the New Year. According to Landa, the colonial Maya referred to their acantuns as gods, treating them as though they were living entities and anointing them with sacrificial blood (Tozzer 1941:141). The acantuns served as shrines for pilgrimage during the Uayeb rites, and their erection at the east, north, west, and south entries to villages in successive years traced the circuit of time's progression through the quadrants of space and time. The New Year's pages of the Dresden Codex illustrate the patron deities of the incoming years performing pilgrimages to acantuns, which are adorned with cloth, paper, and masks (fig. 9). In essence, the Dresden Codex portrays the acantuns arrayed as gods. Archaeology furnishes fewer direct clues to the types of ritual activities that may have centered upon stelae as objects of veneration and power. They were, however, accorded special treatments, including their own highly specialized rites of dedication. The verbal form that most often records the setting up of stelae is based upon the root tz'ap, which means to dig a hole and plant or erect something in the ground (Grube, cited in Schele 1989:39) (fig. 10a). Occasionally other glyphic forms record the stela's erection with phrases that describe the setting up or installation of gods in certain ceremonial contexts. The verbal form T588, for example, generally appears in inscriptional passages that record the 819 Day Count (fig. 10b). This rather enigmatic addendum to the Long Count records the movements of God K, a Classic god of lightning and fertility, between the directional quadrants of the sky. The little-known verb appears to signify "placing the foot of something," and occasionally substitutes for the fz'ap compound in stela and altar dedications (Schele, Stuart, and Grube 1989). Other special treatments were applied to stelae and altars as well, such as painting them a uniform shade of red. This sacred color, associated with the east, also signified blood, the most precious of sacrificial offerings. Moreover, stelae were erected upon foundations that assumed special forms, such as the cruciform foundation vaults below many stelae at Copan (fig. 11). Situating the stela upon these four-directional structures had the sacred effect of centering them with respect to the dynamics of spiritual energies associated with the earth, sky, and world quarters. With reference to this lower vault, each sculpture occupied the crossroads, the symbolic center of the world. Foundation vaults were Figure 9.

At Copan, these contents were carefully distributed in the crossarms of the chambers, evidence that special offerings were made in honor of each world directional god. Shells and stalactites symbolize the underworld, a frequent setting for mythic events that concern cosmic cycles of destruction and renewal.

The containers may also be associated with observances that marked the installation of a new era; the colonial Maya manuscripts collectively known as The Books of Chi lam Balam make metaphorical allusions to "the plate and cup" of the approaching katun.5 A specialized variety of sacrificial stones frequently interred in stela foundations also has ethnohistorical parallels, for various colonial texts describe such am, or "bloodletting stones," as tools of shamanistic prophecy (Freidel and Schele 1988a).6 A somewhat garbled account in Bishop Landa's Relaci?n de las Cosas de Yucatan is suggestive of other kinds of ritual behaviors that may have been associated with the use of stelae in the Classic period (Tozzer 1941). Landa's description concerns the Postclassic Maya practice of erecting and venerating what he calls "idols of the katuns." Although Landa does not describe what kind of "idols" these are, they sound suspiciously similar to stelae. He states that the Maya set up one of these idols within the sanctuary of a temple at intervals of twenty years. The idols were dedicated, he states, to "characters" such as Buluc Ahau, Uc Ahau, Bolon Ahau?in other words, the numbered days of katun endings. Landa records that a new idol was installed in the temple ten years prior to the beginning of the katun it was to commemorate. During this time, it shared the sanctuary with the idol of the previous katun, which had occupied the building alone for the first ten years of its cycle. During the first half of the first idol's katun, the Maya believed it reigned with full powers and accorded it complete honors of worship, sacrifice, and homage. During the second half, when it shared the sanctuary with the idol of the /cafi/n-to-come, this older shrine received only offerings of incense and respect. During the second half of the twenty-year cycle, the destinies of the approaching era slowly began to succeed those of the waning katun. When ten more years had elapsed, and the old katun came to its end, the original idol was removed from the sanctuary, and the new idol began to reign with full powers. Thus from the Maya point of view, the new or "guest" idol installed in the temple apparently absorbed powers from its predecessor for ten years prior to beginning its own reign, and then assumed its full potency for the first half of its own cycle. As its twenty-year period began to draw to a close, this idol would receive a "guest" and gradually transfer its powers to this shrine before "retiring" at the conclusion of a total of thirty years (Tozzer 1941:168). Ralph Roys compared this account to a passage that appears in his translation of the BookofChilam Balam of Chumayel, observing their similarity in terms. The 5. There are several references in the various Books of Chilam Balam to "the plate and cup of the katun." Roys (1933:101) observes that there is a consistent link between the numeral coefficient of the katun's final Ahau day and those of these articles. On page 150 of the Chumayel manuscript, for example, its author writes of Katun 9 Ahau, "Nine was its plate, nine was its cup." In his notes to the text, Roys suggests that these allusions relate to rituals performed for the "idols of the katuns" that Landa describes (Roys 1933: 101). 6. Freidel and Schele (1988a) have described and discussed the correspondences between a certain type of small, flaked-stone lancet commonly found in substela dedication caches and the colonial ethnographic descriptions of "stones of prophecy" known as ams. The name means "stinging spider," referring to the ritual use of these stones to draw autosacrificial offerings of blood. Shamans, or chilanes, of the conquest period used these stones for bloodletting and as amulets in their ecstatic rituals, which involved trance, dreaming, and prophecy. The authors point out that the cache stones are regularly inscribed with iconographie references to deities associated with the world directions. They suspect that for the shamanistic kings of the pre Hispanic era, as for their counterparts of the colonial period, these stones were associated with the familiar spirits who assisted their user in accomplishing his spiritual journey to other cosmological realms.</page><page sequence="11">Newsome: The ontology of being and spiritual power 125 Figure 11. Diagram of the cruciform foundation vault under Stela A at Copan. From Stromsvik 1942. Chumayel passage records that "This katun today is Katun 3 Ahau. The time has come for the end of its rule and reign. It is finished. Another one (takes its place) for a time. This is Katun 1 Ahau which was set within the house of Katun 3 Ahau. There it is his guest while it is given its power by Katun 3 Ahau" (Roys 1933:89). In Roy's narrative, the katuns are deified, the numbers and calendar signs of their final days (1 and 3 Ahau) serving as their proper names. The Maya author of the Chumayel also describes them metaphorically as objects that can be "set within the house" of a host katun, corresponding to the type of idol Landa describes. Although the nature of Landa's "idols" remains unexplained, the notion of setting some form of katun marker inside a structure has clear parallels in Classic dedication rites, which occasionally required that a stela be enshrined within a pyramid's inner sanctum. Furthermore, the content of these texts is intriguing with respect to what they reveal about Maya views of a monument's influence over the fortunes of a period of time. Analogies for this type of temporal patterning in stela dedication can also be found in the Classic Maya Lowlands. At Copan, for example, the serial stela grouping set up by the ruler 18-Rabbit-God K comprises six monuments that record dedication dates spanning the fifteenth katun of Maya history (fig. 12). The first monument of the group is Stela C, dated to 9.14.0.0.0. Ten years passed before 18-Rabbit dedicated the group's second monument, Stela F, at 9.14.0.0.0. Stela F's erection marks the turning point of the katun's halfway mark and is reminiscent of the installation of a "guest" idol in the temple ten years prior to the katun ending. The remaining monuments of the 18-Rabbit series chronicle a countdown of dates within this second half of the katun, subdivisions of its ten years leading to the cycle's final day. This chronological arrangement, compared with Landa's concept of the transmission of power between successive idols, suggests the Maya may have regarded their stelae as entities that influenced specific domains of time. Unfortunately, no conquest period account exists that might provide insight into how the Maya would have perceived the spiritual implications of sculpting an affecting work in stone, rendering the raw block of material into a vessel to be filled with holy presence. However, Landa does recount a fascinating and revealing description of the arduous ritual prescriptions that surrounded the sculpting of wooden idols, which the Maya performed each year during the month of Mol. He writes: One of the things, which these miserable people regarded as most difficult and arduous, was to make idols of wood, which they called making gods. And so they had fixed a particular time for this and it was the month of Mol, or another month if the priest told them it was suitable. Therefore those who wished to make some consulted the priest first, having taken his advice, they went to the workmen who engaged in this work. And they say the workmen always made excuses, since they feared that they or someone of their family would die on account of the work, or that fainting sickness would come upon them. . . .

Ferguson and John Q. Royce, Maya Ruins of Central America in Color: Tikal, Copan, and Quirigua (Santa Fe: University of New Mexico Press, 1984), fig. 204. Landa's text underscores the demanding procedures required to carve these effigies, which necessitated the involvement of a priest and four impersonators of the Chacs, lightning gods who reside at the world quarters, as well as the carvers and their patron. The work placed stringent taboos upon all of these participants, who fasted, let blood, and abstained from even thinking about sexual relations until after the carving was complete. The priest, the Chacs, and the workmen labored in isolation inside a special hut built for this purpose, which no one else could approach until the idols were completed. The details were exacting. The wood for carving the effigies had to be cedar, which the Maya called ku che, meaning "god tree" or "holy tree." The hut was equipped with a great urn so that the idols might be kept under cover while they were carved, and the participants frequently cut their ears to anoint the effigies with blood. The sacrifices and ritual precautions Landa describes and the great fear the workmen felt for their safety and that of their families all bear witness to the awesome power involved in creating vessels for the potency, consciousness, and will of the gods. So fearful was the act of realizing the gods' images in material form that few craftsmen seem to have entered this unpopular profession (Tozzer 1941:160). The problem of explaining unsculpted stelae as affecting works still confronts us, however, and requires an explanation. As Armstrong's theory suggests, the perception that such noniconographic works fall into the ontological category of "beings" may be contingent upon their association with certain metaphorical meanings. Ethnography of the postconquest period offers some compelling clues that the Maya regarded certain stone monuments and shrines as the surrogates of divine actors in mythic and cosmological events. One of the most illustrative accounts is an enigmatic narrative called "The Ritual of the Angels" from the Book of Chilam Balam of Chumayel. The text, one of two fragmentary creation myths preserved in the Chumayel manuscript, relates the creation of the present world to the birth of seven pillars of stone, which its author calls the "precious stones of grace." Each of these stones is animated by a divine spirit, one of the "angels" from which the myth derives its name. Its account begins at the end of a previous creation of the world, following a catastrophic flood that consumed the earth and caused the sky to collapse into the waters of the primordial sea. The following are its introductory words: When the world was submerged, when there was neither heaven nor earth, the three-cornered precious stone of grace was born, after the divinity of the ruler was created, when there was no heaven. Then there were born seven tuns, seven katuns, hanging in the heart of the wind, the seven chosen ones. Then, they say, their seven graces stirred also. Seven also were their holy images. . . . Roys 1933:107 The stones, or fans, are described in animate terms: they are "born" as their spirits awaken to consciousness while the primordial time of creation unfolds. The Chumayel's author alludes to his "stones of grace" using euphemisms and liturgical terms that refer to growing plants and stalks of maize, further suggesting an animate association. According to Ralph Roys, the translator of</page><page sequence="13">Newsome: The ontology of being and spiritual power 127 the Chumayel, gracia , or "grace," is a common liturgical term in Maya ritual for the young maize plant (1933:107).7 The language of the text carefully interweaves allusions to corn with references to stone columns and acantuns, identifying them so closely as to conflate their meanings. The climax of the myth seems to occur when a deity whom the Chumayel's author identified with God the Father8 commands the lifting of the sky, which is set upon the summit of a central pillar called Sustinal Gracia, or "Sustaining Grace. " The author also describes this object as "the stone column" and "the mighty pointed stone." As the narrative continues, the Chumayel's author reveals the mythic identity of the "angels" who inhabit his precious stones of grace. They are not "angels" in the Christian sense of the word, but spirits of the winds invoked in conquest-period Maya rituals, probably descended from gods worshipped in the pre-Hispanic past. The author states that four of these spirits assumed their positions at the cardinal directions of the world and supplies the names by which they are best known: These are the angels of the winds which were set up while he (God the Father) created the star, when the world was not yet lighted, when there was neither heaven nor earth: the Red Rauahtun, the White Rauahtun, the Black Rauahtun, the Yellow Rauahtun. . . . Roys 1933:110 In Maya cosmology, the Pauahtuns are four old gods who stand at the earth's corners, its intercardinal points, where they elevate the sky above the earth and sea. In the colonial period, they were closely associated with other world directional gods, especially the Bacabs.9 Landa's Relaci?n, for example, states that the Yucatec Maya regarded the Bacabs as four brothers who had escaped the deluge at the end of the last creation and were set up by God at the four points to prevent the sky from falling (Tozzer 1941:135). The Chumayel narrative describes this world-renewing act of elevating the sky, a recurring theme of cosmic origin myths shared by both ancient and living Maya groups. The actions of the directional gods who accomplish this feat reestablish order out of the chaos that ensued at the destruction of the previous world, giving it directionality and vertical divisions. According to the myth, the Pauahtuns assumed their places by proceeding in a ritual circuit from east to north, west, and south, for the Chumayel's author names them using the colors associated with this directional sequence. It is logical that the Pauahtuns as gods of the four winds should be charged with supporting the celestial vault. However, their association with pillars of stone seems less apparent until the iconographie conventions and linguistic terms that refer to them are considered, for these make it clear that the connection is quite literal. In Classic iconography, the Pauahtuns appear as old men with wrinkled faces and net headdresses whose bodies bear clusters of the circular "cauac" markings the Maya used to symbolize objects made of stone (fig. 13). Roys, translator of the Chumayel, observes that their name, Pauah Tun, means "stone set upright" (Roys 1933:1 71-1 72). I have argued in previous works that these personified pillars of stone are the divine prototype of the Classic stela, which I suspect functioned as 7. The language of "The Ritual of the Angels" from the Chilam Balam of Chumayel strongly suggests that its account of world creation involves the actions of a distant counterpart of the Classic Maize God. In addition to the use of "gracia," which Roys observes is a liturgical term in Maya ritual for the young maize plant, the opening passage describes the birth of a divinity in the primordial darkness who has "long locks of hair." Roys suggests this metaphor refers to the silk of the corn plant (Roys 1933:107). 8. The various Books of Chilam Balam are late colonial versions of manuscripts compiled earlier in the postconquest period and handed down through a succession of copies for generations. They descend from transcriptions of the contents of hieroglyphic codices that were made in the generations immediately following the conquest, for there are accounts of native books still circulating in certain areas as late as the end of the seventeenth century (Roys 1933:5). None of the Chilam Balams were written before the late seventeenth century; most date to the eighteenth century. Roys notes, however, that the language of many passages suggests that they were copied verbatim from sixteenth- and early-seventeenth-century versions (1933:6). All contain intrusive European material to some degree, reflecting an overlay or blending of indigenous and Christian beliefs. In "The Ritual of the Angels" from the Chumayel, for example, the author identified his creator god with God the Father and sprinkled his account with numerous Biblical and Latinate references. Although apparently dated to 1782, the Chumayel has comparatively little of the European material found in other eighteenth-century manuscripts and is composed in language that suggests seventeenth-century sources. Along with the Chilam Balams of Tizimin and Mani, it is one of the most useful documents for understanding the colonial persistence of Maya literary traditions. 9. Precisely what relationship existed between the Bacabs and the Pauahtuns in Maya theology is unclear. Ethnographic sources from the conquest and colonial periods suggest that they were so closely related as to share the greater part of their identities. Bishop Landa, for example, writes that the Yucatecs regarded all of the world directional gods as the same being who they addressed in their different manifestations by using a variety of names: Chac-Xib-Chac (the Red Chac of the East), Chac Bacab, Chac Pauahtun, and so forth (Tozzer 1941:136-137).</page><page sequence="14">128 RES 33 SPRING 1998 Figure 13. Pauahtun with cauac (stone) body markings. Drawing: Barbara Fash. Reproduced with permission of the Instituto Hondureno de Antropolog?a e Historia. shrines to the world directional gods (Newsome 1991, 1996). Here, I would also like to focus upon the temporal associations that coincide with their directionality and are related to the transition of calendrical periods between the world quarters that they rule. It is this aspect of their personas that endowed them with a special significance in the period-ending festivals commemorated by the colonial Maya of Yucatan. According to Bishop Landa, the Bacabs served as patrons of the Uayeb ceremonies the Maya performed in preparation for their rites of year renewal, commemorated by the erection of an acantun (Tozzer 1941:138-139). They were the divine patrons as well of the four days that served as "year bearers" in Maya calendrical lore, which coincided with the "seating," or installation of the new year. These ritual associations underscore that the Bacabs or Pauahtuns were the lords of the Maya's temporal rites of passage, presiding over the conditions of cosmic instability that marked the liminal periods of their calendar. These included both the interval of "antistructure"10 that preceded the genesis of a new world and the Uayeb days, which marked a brief return to a primordial state of affairs. At this point it may be impossible to proceed with an ontological interpretation of what stelae meant in Maya religious thought without exploring the nature of their concepts regarding the relationship between divinity and time. The Classic Maya often personified the glyphic signs for their calendrical periods in full-figure form as fantastic zoomorphic and anthropomorphic deities and portrayed their coefficients as the patron gods associated with the numbers 1-13 (fig. 14). These graphic examples illustrate that at a basic level of meaning, it is impossible to separate the patron deities from the periods they govern; the periods themselves are simply manifestations of the rulership of their gods. Indeed, in Yucatec chronicles, prophecies allude to the revelation of a katun's auguries and divine patrons as the "countenance" or "face" of the katun, which might be interpreted by a priest capable of discerning the influences of its presiding deities (Roys 1933; Thompson 1972:201 -202).u In the metaphysics of space and time, the gods were synonymous with the periods they ruled; the years and their inaugural days, as well as the calendar's larger cycles, were not merely influenced by 10. In his study Dramas, Fields, and Metaphors: Symbolic Action in Human Society (1974), Victor Turner distinguishes between "structure" and "antistructure" as paradigms for social action that play opposing roles in the ritual process. During rites of passage, which provide members of a society with a ritual means of separating themselves from one social state and entering into another, Turner distinguishes a phase of what he terms "antistructure." This "time out of time" exists between the past and future states that the ritual serves to bridge, but belongs to neither; as an expression of its timelessness and liminality, it is characterized by symbols of social displacement from the patterns of everyday life. These expressions may include acts of self or community purification, penance and reflection, the temporary abandonment of social roles and symbols of hierarchy. The Uayeb rites and other period-ending rituals documented in Mesoamerican ethnohistory conform to Turner's model for the antistructure concept. They served to articulate moments of social experience when such cultural models of "structure" as the calendar were temporarily suspended, replaced by mythic and ritual symbols of chaos, upheaval, and inversions of the social and cosmological order. 11. The various Chilam Balams utilize numerous metaphors for the "face," "countenance," or "eyes" of the katun to describe the prophecies for its fate. In the Chilam Balam ofTizimin, for example, the destiny of a katun is described in the words te u uich ti caan ti yahaulil, meaning "there is his (the katun's) face in the sky in his rule." Roys offers the intriguing interpretation that this sort of euphemism refers to a constellation, which might be "read" in the heavens as the "face" of the katun (1933:151 ). Metaphors for the eyes and seeing seem to be particularly relevant to the reign of the katun's presiding god, for theTizimin also records that "his (the katun's) eyes were unbound in the time of his reign." Similarly, the old katun seems to have been conceived as "blinded" at its departure; if reluctant to give up its reign, its god could be deposed by blindfolding or piercing his eyes (Thompson 1971:201-202).</page><page sequence="15">Newsome: The ontology of being and spiritual power 129 Figure 14.

Reproduced with permission of the Instituto Hondureno de Antropolog?a e Historia. the world directional gods but were embodiments of their living essence. Clues to the identification of stelae with the Pauahtuns and their divine patronage of time may be illustrated by the second creation narrative preserved in the Chumayel, called "The Creation of the World." This text also begins with the destruction of the previous world and the events that culminate in the raising of the sky. In this instance, the gods reestablish the order of creation by first raising the directional trees of abundance, which the Maya associated with the cardinal points, each named for the color associated with its cosmic direction. Again, the gods raise up these celestial supports in a ritual circuit that rotates through the cardinal quadrants, circumscribing the rim of the world. The erection of these pillars functions as an act of power through which the gods found the quadripartite unity of space and time. As the new world dawns, the circuit of creation continues, culminating in the erection of a second series of directional markers called "Rulers," or Ahaus. Then the red foundation was established; the white foundation of the ruler was established; the black foundation was established; the yellow foundation was established. Then the Red Ruler was set up, he who was raised upon the mat, raised upon the throne. The White Ruler was set up, he who was raised upon the mat, raised upon the throne. The Black Ruler was set up, he who was raised upon the mat, raised upon the throne. The Yellow Ruler was set up, he who was raised upon the mat, raised upon the throne. As a god, it is said; whether or not gods, their bread is lacking, their water is lacking. . . . Roys 1933:103 The identity of these "Rulers" is enigmatic, and the term seems to function as a multivocalic metaphor, simultaneously evoking a range of closely related meanings. The term ahau means "lord or ruler," and in Classic and colonial Maya literature, it had divine and calendrical, as well as political, connotations. In colonial Maya texts, ahau functions as a title of the world directional gods as "rulers" of their cosmic domains (Tozzer 1941:137-138). In Classic inscriptions, ahau functions as a title of Maya kings. With respect to the divinatory associations of the calendar, Ahau is also the name of the final day of the 260-day ritual cycle known as the tzolkin. The tzolkin, composed of twenty named days combined in endless series with the numbers 1-13, was the most basic of all the calendar's intermeshing cycles. In Classic inscriptions, its day signs, like the periods of the Long Count, were frequently recorded using head or full-figure variant glyphs that portrayed their presiding gods. Maya groups who use the tzolkin today still regard its twenty named days and their coefficients as deities who lend their character to periods ranging from the single day to vast epochs of creation. As in the pre-Columbian past, the tzolkin serves as the basic tool of priestly divination. In the Highland Maya communities of Mexico and Guatemala, shamans foretell the lives of human individuals based</page><page sequence="16">130 RES 33 SPRING 1998 upon their date of birth in the 260-day cycle and prognosticate future events based upon the omens of their days and reigning gods. The final day of the tzolkin, the katun, or any great cycle fell upon Ahau, the sign that most strongly determined the destiny of the cycle. The Maya regarded this day of completion as the lord, or "Ruler," of any major period of time. The metaphor of rulership crosscuts many of the categories that relate to stela dedication in the Maya world view, tying together the gods who generate order from chaos, the temporal structure of reality, and the ordering of the human social world through the agency of a divine king. In the mythic passage cited above, the "Rulers" might be interpreted on many allegorical levels: as deified periods of time, as the directional gods who preside over their "inauguration," as the Ahau dates that culminate a chronological series. Perhaps, as Roys suggests, the myth may allude to the setting up of the stone giants, the Pauahtuns, upon their cosmic seats of power (Roys 1933:102). However, katun prophecies also appear in the Chumayel manuscript and describe the arrival of a new katun using similar language: "Katun 11 Ahau is set upon the mat, set upon the throne, when their ruler is set up" (Roys 1933:77). As Maya concepts of space and time involve the idea that temporal periods are assigned to the cardinal directions in a counterclockwise rotation that generates a sacred circuit, the Chumayel's references to the setting up of "Rulers" at the world quarters may allude to the dates of creation's first series of period endings. However, to draw such distinctions with respect to the sacred language of the myth may be self-defeating; I suspect that at some basic level, no true distinction exists between the "Rulers" as embodiments of the cycle, its day of completion, and the Bacabs or Pauahtuns who governed the transition from cosmic instability to order. Most notably, the mythic reference to these "Rulers" resonates with distant echoes of the ancient Maya practice of raising up a stela upon its foundation. Even their cardinal orientation has certain parallels, as in the Great Plaza at Copan, where a group of stelae that span the ritual stations of a katun were erected to form a four sided, four-directional enclosure (fig. 12). If the "Rulers" (whether directional gods or Ahau days) are symbolically conceived as stone monuments, the royal emblems the Chumayel's author cites to express their power and authority also find counterparts in the Classic period. The myth records that they are "raised upon the mat, raised upon the throne." Colonial Yucatec sources describe the braided mat (pop) as a key symbol of rulership, for mats served as the thrones of Maya lords, whether spread across a raised seat or laid upon a floor. The mat motif is a common symbol of royal authority in the iconography of Classic Maya kingship as well, and in some important instances, it marks stelae as objects of power. Woven mat designs were incorporated into the reading order of stela texts at Copan and Quirigua, and a famous incised carving on a peccary skull from Copan depicts a stela apparently wrapped in matting (fig. 15). Interestingly, the iconography of Copan Stela J (fig. 16) recalls the way the colonial texts refer to katuns and their idols being set upon mats or within houses: the glyphs of its east side inscription comprise an elaborate mat design, while its opposing western surface seems to have originally represented the iconographie emblem for a stone house or temple.12 Both icons mark the stela as a material symbol of royal power yet may also refer to the installation of the period it commemorates. In the Classic period, no ritual event played a more prominent role in promoting the ideology of divine kingship than the erection of a stela, whether iconographie, hieroglyphic, or uncarved. If the monument itself was indeed regarded as a manifestation of the potency of the world-renewing gods, its sacrificial and visionary imagery should be explained according to the same set of metaphysical beliefs. The rituals Maya lords enacted on their period-ending and accession dates frequently involved dances with various items of ceremonial regalia (Grube 1992) and the impersonation of a range of celestial and agricultural gods. The latter include deities who assume pivotal roles in the various cosmic origin myths that have been preserved in textual sources such as the Quiche Maya Popul Vuh. Among them are the Maize God, deities associated with Venus and the sun, and those who personify the mythical Trees of Life. Through rites of shamanistic ecstasy and by dressing in the masks and regalia of these gods, the rulers of the Classic period seem to have assumed their identities and powers (Houston and Stuart 1996; Newsome 1991). I suspect that these rites of impersonation concern the gods who rule the destiny of the completed period or those who govern the inception 12. Alphonso Morales first suggested this identification, based upon the resemblance of the triangular stone altar of Stela J to iconographie representations of a thatched roof. He suggests this block originally rested on the top edge of the stela, completing its design as an effigy of a stone house (Morales, pers. comm., to Linda Schele, 1991).</page><page sequence="17">Newsome: The ontology of being and spiritual power 131 of the new cycle. Strong links to directionality are apparent in the rulers' frequent impersonations of particular divinities, such as God K and variants of the Chacs. Royal costumes and regalia also display numerous emblems associated with the World Trees, most notably the "God C loincloth," which features the zoomorphic deity face that personifies the animate spirit of the tree, appearing superimposed on its trunk in numerous representations. Although royal impersonations of the Bacabs or Pauahtuns are less frequent, there are important examples. The double portraits of Stela N at Copan, for example, portray the ruler Yax Pas wearing the waterlily pad and flower headdress of the Bacabs (Baudez 1994:76-87). As a royal title, Bacab or Batab (a variant spelling) figures prominently in the title sequences that rulers recorded in their monumental texts, frequently accompanied by one of the cardinal direction glyphs (fig. 1 7). Figure 15. Design from an incised peccary skull, Copan. Drawing: Barbara Fash. Reproduced with permission of the Instituto Hondureno de Antropolog?a e Historia. The relationship of such divine impersonations to the cosmic implications of a period ending may be best illustrated, however, by the iconography of Stela A at Quirigua (fig. 18a). The monument, erected by the ruler Cauac Sky, commemorates a hotun, or five-fan period ending that fell upon a day named 6 Ahau (fig. 18b). The initial event recorded by the text that appears on the monument's east side is the tz'apwah, or "setting up," of the "6 Ahau Stone," recording Stela A's proper name (fig. 18c). The inscription that continues to the monument's western side compares Cauac Sky's sacrificial rite on the five-fun period ending to a mythological event that transpired in the distant past, the completion of nineteen units of a vast cycle that also ended upon a 6 Ahau date. The portrait of Cauac Sky that appears on Stela A's south side reveals his identification with the period his stela commemorates and particularly with the god of its ruling a Figure 16.

Cauac Sky appears with one foot raised in a conventionalized posture of dance, wearing the disguise of a deity whose jaguar claws adorn his mittens and boots. The god's mask conceals his face, but the sign for a hafted axe, one of the identifying traits of the God of Number 6, appears infixed in its eye. The particular association of the jaguar god with the final day of this period ending most likely relates to its ritualistic, divinatory associations and may also be related to astronomical events that occurred on this date. Yet the name of the stela and the axe sign that appears in the eye of Cauac Sky's mask both support the idea that the stela and the king whose portrait it bears are manifestations of the 6 Ahau hotun ending. The king's sacrifices and stela dedication literally manifest the cycle ending; the ruler and the stela he erects both contribute to the fulfillment and the revelation of its prophecies. The idea that the stela and the royal portrait that adorn it both correspond to the gods of the period-ending's final day may likewise explain the apparent anomaly of the double-portrait stelae at Copan (fig. 19) and Quirigua. The fact that these monuments display contrasting figurai images on opposing sides, east and west or north and a Figure 18. Quirigua Stela A.

Some have argued that they must portray different individuals, perhaps reflecting the concept of dynastic succession (Baudez 1986, 1994), while others have treated them as dual portraits of one ruler, based upon the fact that only one individual is named as the protagonist of their texts (Newsome 1991, 1996). The confusion might be resolved if the contrasting images are seen as two phases of royal ritual that reflect the dual nature of the cycle's ending day. As Landa's account of the katun idols indicates, the Maya believed that periods of time</page><page sequence="19">Newsome: The ontology of being and spiritual power 133 Wtmi l?'-^y ra? wUiS P^ft^l a b Figure 19.

A cycle's day of completion, in particular, might be conceived as a Janus-faced phenomenon: while marking the end of one period and the reign of its patron deities, it also marked the advent or "inauguration" of a new era and its own set of gods. If the lords of Copan and Quirigua danced in effigy of these divine patrons to fulfill the completion of their cycles, then Baudez's concept of royal succession may take on a new level of meaning. Could the royal portraits preserved on the monuments' opposing sides represent rites that dramatized the inauguration of gods, rather than human kings? If pillars of stone and units of time were personified as avatars of the directional gods, who were themselves conceived as the acceding "rulers" of calendrical periods, the rational link between stela dedication and both royal accession and period endings comes into sudden focus. Both were rites that bestowed the power of sovereignty, underscoring the correspondence between the human ruler and his divine prototype. The metaphysical basis of the stela complex becomes clear once we recognize the ontological relationship between the rulership of the gods over time and space, and the powers the divine kings of the ancient Lowlands strove to demonstrate through the cyclical dedication of stelae. Like the gods, kings were responsible for establishing and maintaining an ideal order. The act of stela dedication becomes clear as a rite of passage intended to bring godlike powers to bear in moments of cosmic and social instability: the inauguration of a new ruler or the transition to a future era of time. It provided a secure means of bridging crises that posed potential threats to world and social order, alleviating the corporate anxiety born of a millennial vision of cosmic history and the genuine risk of political upheaval that might follow the death of a king. Yet ritual moments are fleeting, and the gods are unseen; the actions of kings are limited by their performance in time. Stelae were perpetual actors, each reigning for the duration of its cycle, ensuring the continuity of the world order it was raised to effect. Fulfilling these social needs throughout nearly a millennium of Classic Maya history, unifying the disparate and often contentious world of dynastic politics, the stela truly merited its mythic role as the living pillar of creation.
