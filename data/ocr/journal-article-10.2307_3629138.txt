<plain_text><page sequence="1">MARKETING AND EXCHANGE IN A WEST AFRICAN TRIBE JAMES BOYD CHRISTENSEN THE FANTI, numbering over 200,000, are one of the Akan groups that inhabit the southern half of Ghana. They are located along the coast in the approxi- mate center of the country, and extend inland for fifteen or twenty miles. The economy is based on shifting agriculture, the staples being yam, plantain, and cassava. In the coastal villages fishing tends to dominate the economy, although farming is practiced as well. The livestock is limited to chickens, a few sheep and goats. The pressure of population long ago made hunting unprofitable and an extremely unreliable source of protein. The major cash crop for export is cocoa, which is grown in the rain forest.' ANTIQUITY OF MARKETS AND MONEY Markets have apparently existed among the Fanti since they migrated to the coast some four hundred years ago, as travelers in the seventeenth century make note of their existence along the coast.2 The use of money,3 in the form of gold dust, is equally old. Salt, obtained along the coast by boiling or evaporating sea water, was sometimes used as a medium of exchange or for barter, and cowrie shells were used by the Fanti for a period of time, but their use as a medium of exchange followed European contact and disappeared with the introduction of coins. Salt was used for barter until well into the current century, as Fanti elders stated that as youths they could travel with only small bags of salt to pay their way for food and lodging. The desire for gold was a primary factor in the establishment of trading posts by Europeans along the Guinea Coast in the sixteenth and seventeenth century, although the trade in slaves eventually became more profitable. The gold was obtained by the Africans either from pit mines or by panning it from streams in the forest or along the coast.4 The use of gold for purposes of exchange obviously preceded its use as a trade item to the European. The exchange was standardized 1 The field research for this paper was carried out by the writer as a Fulbright scholar and fellow of the Social Science Research Council in 1950-51. While "Ghana" is used rather than the previous name of "Gold Coast," conditions discussed relate to those at the time of the research. 2 See William Bosman, A New and Accurate Description of the Coast of Guinea (2nd ed., London, 1721). 3 The definition of money used here is that proposed by Herskovits: a medium of exchange having homogeneity, portability, devisability, and durability, and a subsidiary role as a store of value and a standard of deferred payments. See M. J. Herskovits, Economic Anthropology (New York: A. A. Knopf, 1952), ch. 11. 4 See Bosman, op. cit., pp. 71-72. 124 VOL. 17, 1961</page><page sequence="2">WEST AFRICAN TRIBE 125 by use of scales and weights, the latter cast in bronze by the goldsmiths. These weights were in either anthropomorphic, zoimorphic or geometric forms. While the weights depicting men, animals, or insects had a value in gold dust assigned to them, they were actually "proverb" weights, and represented some widely-used maxim. The Fanti elders claim those with simple geometric patterns were more likely to be used in weighing gold for exchange.5 The utilization of gold dust in the markets for small purchases was not common, but could occur in the case of bulk purchases. Gold was used primarily in such transactions as gifts to chiefs, payment of bridewealth, loans, purchase of slaves, pawning of children, payment of fines to the courts, or "buying a head," which was the payment made by the relatives of a condemned man to save his life. Thus at the time of contact with the European, and for a long period follow- ing, the Fanti had a dual economy, where the necessities of life were obtained in the market primarily by barter, or the use of some type of money, and the cere- monial obligations or major transactions were calculated in gold.6 However, there is evidence that an adulterated form of gold was in use during the seventeenth century for purchases of produce in the market in much the same manner as coins were later used, as the following account by Bosman indicates: The first sort is that mixed with Silver or Copper, and cast into Fetiches. .... These Fetiches are cut into small Bits by the Negroes, about the worth of one, two, or three Farthings. 'Tis a common Proverb, That you cannot buy much Gold for a Farthing, yet even with that value in Gold you may here go to Market and buy Bread or Fruit for your Necessities. The Negroe Women know the exact value of these Bits so well at sight, that they never are mistaken; and accordingly they tell them to each other with- out weighing, as we do coined Money. They are here called Kakeraas, the Word express- ing something of very little worth ... and yet it passes currant all over the Coast; and our Garrisons are paid their subsistence Money in it. And for this they may buy all sorts of Edibles of the Negroes.7 ORGANIZATION OF THE MARKET The technique of distribution of goods and produce in the Fanti towns and villages varies from that of a young girl sitting outside her house selling ground- nuts or oranges, to the large markets patronized by hundreds of people. Formerly the market was an area in or near the town where by common consent or agreement the women collected to sell or barter their produce. This type is still found in the 5 See R. S. Rattray, Ashanti (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1923), ch. 25. Rattray's discussion of the form, construction, and function of Ashanti gold weights is applicable to the Fanti. 6 For a discussion of a dual economy, see Herskovits, op. cit., pp. 257 ff. This is not a dual economy in the sense that some economists use the term, but refers to a practice of exchange being based on two different media. 7 Bosman, op cit., p. 72,</page><page sequence="3">126 SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY smaller Fanti villages or towns, and there is no formal structure or organization. In the larger towns, where the local government has provided a market with stalls and sheltered areas, it is often a walled or fenced area where women bringing goods or produce for sale must purchase a ticket to gain entrance. This fee will vary from a few pennies for a woman with a basket of produce to a rental of a shilling a day or more for a trader with a stall, the money going to pay for the maintenance and management of the market. An example of an urban market would be the one which operates daily at Cape Coast, but the large traditional market among the Fanti is best exemplified by that at Mankessim, a town about ten miles inland in the eastern section of the Fanti area. It is a large, fenced area, with some stalls and shelters, but much of the selling space is in the open. The market days are Wednesday and Saturday, when in excess of one thousand women, or sometimes twice that number, may be expected. Some will often walk for fifteen or twenty miles to attend, and others come by lorry, often from as far as fifty miles or more, to sell their produce. Here, as in most towns with an area constructed specifically for a market, the local officials appoint men to collect tickets, clean, and oversee the market. ITEMS SOLD IN THE MARKET The majority of sales in the village market involve either food grown locally or fish. The latter is the main source of protein for the Fanti, although some goats are kept for food, and some of the larger rodents are trapped or shot in the forest, but these do not comprise a significant portion of the diet. Many sheep can be seen around the towns or villages, but they are raised almost wholly for sacrificial pur- poses. When a sheep is offered to the ancestors, the meat is usually distributed to so many relatives and friends that the amount each family receives is negligible. The staples sold in the market are yams, cassava, and plantain; maize is grown locally, but considerable amounts are imported. Other produce available includes tomatoes, onions, peppers, pineapple, bananas, papaya (paw paw), groundnuts, palm nuts, kola nuts, coconuts, and palm wine. Few items of local manufacture, except pottery and baskets, are offered in the market. Carvings, metal work, gold ornaments, or native cloth must be ordered from the artisan. Sandals made from automobile tires are widely used, but are usually purchased at the shop where they are made. Some women buy imported flour from the store to bake bread for sale in the market, and others obtain maize to make kenkey, maize porridge. The latter is becoming a staple of the diet, and is dispensed in the form of a solid ball of porridge (about the size of a baseball) wrapped in leaves. However, kenkey and other prepared or cooked foods are more often sold in the larger towns where there is a labor force or transient population,</page><page sequence="4">WEST AFRICAN TRIBE 127 and are found at strategic points on the streets or near lorry stations. On the other hand, in the market one is more likely to find grain being sold by the cigarette tin (a standard measure in West Africa) rather than prepared food. One will also find in the market goods purchased from the trading firms, divided into lots to sell for a few pennies. Thus a girl may sell one or two cigarettes at a time in order to make a profit of a shilling or less on a tin of fifty. Cube sugar, because of the regularity of size and weight, is dispensed in a similar fashion. Even though one finds a well-established market pattern, it does not serve as a central point for wholesale transactions. Cocoa is collected from the growers by brokers or middlemen. Similarly, citrus fruits, such as limes and grapefruit, are sold as a cash crop for processing overseas, but they are also sold directly to the plant that extracts the juice before shipping. In terms of world trade, it is a one- way process as far as the local market is concerned, with some manufactured goods coming in from overseas, but little or nothing from the market being shipped abroad. The local market functions primarily to provide the Fanti family with what it needs in its daily life. PRICE-DETERMINATION Several factors are operative in determining the price of goods or produce for sale in the market. There are the obvious ones of supply and demand; for example, yams at the time of harvest, or herring during the height of the season, will be cheap. Distance from the source of supply is also a factor, as fish offered for sale inland must include the cost of transportation. Some women will walk as much as ten or twenty miles to obtain a higher price for their produce in one of the larger towns. Others journey to farm villages to purchase goods to sell in town, their margin of profit being the difference in the price at the two places, plus the fact they are buying wholesale and selling retail. The market women tend to sell for the price they wish, although there will be some discussion and agreement among them as to what a given item should sell for that particular day. If one woman sells for less, there is no overt action against her, or even any animosity shown toward her. The woman selling the produce of her own farm is more likely to cut her price than the woman who spends all her time trading and must obtain a reasonable profit in order to operate. Actually, there does not tend to be a great deal of variation in prices on a given day, for long experience makes the market woman fairly cognizant of the value of her produce. The typical Fanti woman will have had years of experience, as she will have started her first trips to market as a child on her mother's back, and have learned through observation as a very young girl. The price of imported goods sold in the market,</page><page sequence="5">128 SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY such as cloth, beads, kerosene, or sugar, tends to be more constant and less sub- ject to seasonal fluctuations Bargaining or "haggling" is not so important in the sale of produce in the market as it is if one is buying in wholesale lots or discussing the price of a stool with a carver or cloth with a weaver. Most sales involve only a few pennies, and there is not a wide margin for variation. Often the price is set, and the potential buyer may take the produce at the quoted price or go elsewhere. I do not intend to imply that bargaining does not occur, but that it depends on the item and size of the sale. While a woman may bargain at length over the purchase of a basket of three hundred herring, there will be little discussion over the price of three her- ring when she is retailing them. A buyer may point out that the three herring being offered for a threepence are not so large as those of another seller for the same price, and may get another small herring added, but there is not a wide disparity on such sales between the asking and proffered price. In other cases, bargaining is an important, if not a ritual part, of a sale, particularly when a purchase is made from a foreign trader or shopkeeper. While it rarely affects goods purchased in the market, an aspect in regard to price that should be noted is that a chief,9 or wealthy person, is expected to pay more for an item than the common man. For example, when a chief is purchasing something made by an artisan, they may agree on a price that a commoner would pay. However, the chief is also expected to add a "gift" of a few shillings to the purchase price. The European was included in this select group of people expected to pay more for goods because he was extremely wealthy by African standards. For example, the writer once purchased a pair of sandals of the type worn by chiefs, and an integral part of the price was a gift or "dash" of two shillings. On another occasion he bargained too well for a pineapple in the market, and after completing the transaction, the seller was the object of much derision by the other women for selling to an European at the same price she would an African. She literally snatched back the fruit, returned the money, and thereafter would not sell the pineapple for three times the original price. Obviously the attempt to charge the European what the traffic will bear is based on the assumption he will not know prices and will pay more, but the expectation that the European should pay more 8 The Africans complained that the cost of goods at the European stores would fluctuate with the availability of money, as the prices on goods much in demand, or in short supply, would rise when the African farmers received their pay for the cocoa crop. Store managers denied this. The writer was requested by several Africans to purchase flour for them in the store. The reasons given for the request were that first of all, as a European, he could obtain it, and secondly, he could buy it cheaper. 9 A chief is forbidden by customary law to enter a market. To do so would be sufficient grounds for "de-stoolment" or removal from his position.</page><page sequence="6">WEST AFRICAN TRIBE 129 has its background in the tradition that those with the ability to pay more should do so. SOCIAL FUNCTION OF THE MARKET Apart from its economic function, the market serves as a gathering place where women can get news, visit friends and relatives, and exchange the latest gossip. The social aspect is sometimes accorded primacy over selling, and may be illustrated by some examples. Women who could dispose of their produce in their own town would pay to ride a lorry to a large market, buy an entrance ticket, and thus run the risk of making less profit merely to attend a market where they were likely to see relatives or friends from other villages. The writer once attempted to buy a basket of oranges from a woman on her way to market, and was unsuccessful even though the woman would have made a greater profit and would have been free to engage in some other task. Her day was planned for the market, and if she had nothing to sell, she could not go and just visit. A trip to the market for the farm wife is a welcome break in the routine, and an occasion to look forward to with pleasure. ROLE OF WOMEN IN MARKETING The extent to which women dominate the retail marketing may be illustrated by the fact that one rarely sees a Fanti man in the market, the males present usually being the professional traders from outside Ghana. A man is expected to do the heavy work on the farm, such as clearing and burning the bush, planting and harvesting. His wife is expected to help with this, in addition to cultivating the crops and carrying the harvest back to the village. If any produce is sold, again it is the duty of the wife, who turns the money realized over to her husband. A woman is also expected to keep a small vegetable plot for raising such things as tomatoes, cocoa yam, herbs, onions, and other plants used in cooking, and she usually has a plot of cassava. If she grows more than she uses to feed her family, she may sell the vegetables and keep the money. It is expected that a Fanti woman will be able to trade in the market if and when the need arises. For most this is only an occasional day, or concentrated into certain seasons, but for many it is a full-time vocation, to be preferred to farming. The part played by women in the preparation and distribution of fish perhaps best illustrates the importance of women in the Fanti economy, for they handle the entire catch after it is brought to the beach. To give a brief resume, the type of canoe used is a dugout made of soft wood, varying in length from fifteen to thirty feet. These are made in the rain forest, and brought to the coast by lorry where they are decorated and equipped for fishing, including outfitting with a sail. The cost of a thirty foot canoe in 1951 was approximately fifty pounds. They are admir- ably suited for use on the coast where natural harbors are lacking and shallow-</page><page sequence="7">130 SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY draft craft is needed. The main net for fishing, designed for herring, is a surface-net of two hundred to three hundred yards in length, representing an investment of approximately one hundred pounds.'0 A canoe is manned by five to seven men, and the catch is divided according to the following formula: canoe, one share; net, two shares; each of the crew, one share. An exception to the latter is found if the crew includes a boy or youth not yet regarded as a competent fisherman, who will be allotted a quarter or half of a share. Thus the catch may be divided into as many as ten parts, with the owner of the canoe and net, who may or may not be members of the crew, collecting the shares allocated to the equipment. The owner of the net is given two shares because it represents a large capital investment, is short-lived, and requires constant repair and maintenance. The distribution of the catch is made on the beach, where a basket is set aside for each share of the catch. The fishermen count out one hundred and ten fish into each basket in rotation till all are divided."l The women wait at the beach to carry the catch back to the oven for smoking. These are not usually the same women who will process the fish, but are housewives who take the job in order to obtain fresh fish, as they are paid about ten or twenty herring for carrying one basket of fish. The competition is sometimes very keen for this particular task, with the women quarreling and fighting among themselves for the privilege. This sometimes so interferes with the distribution of the catch that the men paddle back out to sea to carry on the division in peace. Women are also paid in fish for carrying the net back to the drying racks, a task which normally requires five or six women for each net. A fisherman turns his catch over to his wife or a female clan member for process- ing and disposal, and the matrilineal Fanti claim it is more often the latter than a wife. It is believed that a sister is more to be trusted with the final accounting than a wife. The men disclaim any knowledge of what happens to the catch after it is turned over the the women, but this is more to indicate disdain of the work of women than ignorance of the market. Inquiries will be made by the men as to the price per hundred of fish for that day, and they have a fairly accurate know- ledge as to the amount due them when a settlement is made with the women. The economic acumen of a Fanti woman is shown by the profit she realizes from selling her fish. She may decide to dispose of them fresh on the day of the catch 10 Several other types of nets are used, as well as fishing by line, depending on the location and season of the year. 11 Ten extra fish are added to each hundred to make certain that at least one hundred are obtained. Theoretically, they are to be used to pay the women to carry the fish, and a few will be eaten or given away. When fish are sold, the buyer is usually given one hundred and five for the price of one hundred.</page><page sequence="8">WEST AFRICAN TRIBE 131 if she can find a buyer, rather than risk the cost of smoking them. However, the demand for fresh fish in a fishing village is rather limited. She might be able to sell to some woman who wishes to smoke them, but who does not have a working agree- ment with any fisherman; but most of the catch during the season will be smoked, or cured in some manner such as drying or salting. Fish are smoked in round ovens of clay, three or four feet in diameter and about the same in height. One foot from the top is a rack on which the fish are placed in layers, with each successive layer alternating ninety degrees to permit the passage of heat and smoke. A cover is placed over the top, the fish are turned periodically, and the curing process is a combination of roasting and smoking, which requires three or four hours. It is possible to store them for several weeks in some cases, although this will vary with the length of time in the oven and the size of the fish. After smoking, a woman may sell her fish to a buyer, or take them to market within a day or two; or she may choose to store them for a week or so, hoping to take advantage of a more favorable market. By holding her fish she may gain or lose, depending on the market at the time she chooses to sell. It is difficult to obtain specific information on the price to be realized for a given number of fish, as this will vary with the season, size of the catch, and size of the fish, as they are not sold by weight. However, what the women anticipate can be outlined. For example, a woman may get one thousand herring from two of her brothers as their share of the catch. The price that day may be two shillings per hundred for fresh herring, and she is expected to turn back this amount. However, anything she can realize above that amount is commission. If she smokes the fish, it will be necessary for her to buy firewood, which costs about one shilling and sixpence per bundle, and it requires on an average of two or three bundles to process one thousand herring of average size. After smoking she may obtain three or four shillings per hundred, or she may store them for a period of time and realize an additional shilling per hundred. Generally speaking, the women expect to make one or two shillings per hundred herring of average size after smoking, from which must be deducted the cost of wood unless they provide it themselves. She may dispose of her fish in several ways. She may sell to a buyer who can- vasses the villages to purchase in wholesale lots; she may sell by the basket to a woman who wishes to retail them in the market; she may turn them over to a relative who will retail them for a percentage of the sales proceeds; or she may take them to market and retail them herself. Again, this would depend on the availability of a buyer for wholesale lots, and whether it is more lucrative for her to obtain the larger price that retailing will bring as opposed to bulk sales. A settlement between the fisherman and the woman who processed his fish may be held every week, or it may be as long as a month or two before an accounting</page><page sequence="9">132 SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY is held. She is expected to give him the price for fresh fish the day of the catch, although some women also deduct ten percent as a commission for handling. THE FOREIGN TRADER Some of the "middle-men" or intermediaries between the importer and the African peasant belong to the Levantine community, deriving primarily from Syria and Lebanon. However, the average Fanti does not have much direct contact with these traders except in the larger towns. In the Fanti area, for example, they are not normallly encountered outside of Cape Coast, although they may provide the capital for economic ventures in the villages. The majority of those of foreign provenience involved in trade in the villages come from Nigeria, mainly the Hausa, Yoruba, and Ibo districts. The ubiquitous Hausa from northern Nigeria is usually an itinerant trader, frequently carrying his stock in a box on his head as he moves from village to village and market to market. Items for sale include such things as razor blades, locks, cigarette lighters, trinkets, knives and other hardware, and patent medicines. Sometimes he may rent a stall in a market, in which case items of a less portable nature will be included in his stock. In the smaller towns and villages the small shop is likely to be operated by a non-Fanti, usually Yoruba or Ibo. A typical example would be a small room with stock limited to such standard commodities as kero- sene, matches, tobacco, patent medicines, and a few canned goods. One never, or rarely ever, finds a Fanti operating such a store in his own village. One of the aspects of the indigenous clan system is corporate responsibility, a pat- tern of behavior that permits a Fanti who is in need to request aid, and indeed, expect it, from a more affluent relative. In the past if a Fanti attempted such a ven- ture the constant requests by kinsmen for goods on credit, or outright gifts, made it exceedingly difficult to operate. To grant the requests would mean economic failure, and to refuse would lead to alienation from the clan. A kinsman who has something that is badly needed, and will not give it, is considered something less than human. In the past the wealth a man gained passed to the clan, usually to a uterine brother or sister's son in conformance with the matrilineal system of inheritance. A man who was the head of a matrilineage, or senior elder in the clan, may have controlled considerable property, but he should have used it for the good of the clan, not for himself. While this system had some positive effects, such as giving the individual a high degree of security, it had negative factors in terms of its adaptability to the new economy. For one thing, a man did not have a clear title to land, hence it could not be mortgaged or used as collateral for a loan.12 The 12 The Ghanaian government has been working on a program to give clear title of land to individuals to expedite agricultural development.</page><page sequence="10">WEST AFRICAN TRIBE 133 introduction of European culture and Christianity has tended to emphasize in- dividualism, patrilineal inheritance, and the importance of the nuclear family, all at the expense of the clan ties. Consequently, there has been an increasing dissatis- faction with nephew-inheritance and the avunculate. The fact that the dclan has a claim on part or all of an individual's property may have acted as a deterrent to investment and development of cash crops by the Fanti as some felt it unfair that the efforts of their work should go to other than their children. i This collective responsibility of the clan makes it difficult for a member not only to retain wealth, but even to acquire it. A Fanti proverb illustrating this is "The good paw paw tree has a plucking stick near it." This is said to indicate that the wealthy man will always be asked for aid by the less fortunate or less industrious relatives. There are some who enjoy the status of being the head of a large circle of dependent relatives, but others do not. Consequently, a man who gains a small amount of capital may do one of several things that removes it from circulation. One is the time-honored custom of burying it. This reluctance to utilize savings accounts or banking facilities makes it difficult to obtain credit at a bank for business transactions, and is prompted as much by a fear that his wealth will become common knowledge as a distrust of banks. Another practice is to spend it on items such as cloth, clothing, phonographs, or bric-a-brac. This form of conspicuous consumption is not always deemed wise, as it will also bring requests from relatives.'4 AVAILABILITY AND USE OF CAPITAL While this paper is primarily concerned with the indigenous marketing system and trading rather than the complex economic problems of a developing territory, some of the problems related to trade and capital should be considered. First of all, 13 A law implemented by the British when Ghana was a colony permitted a man "married under the ordinance," that is, married in a religious or civil ceremony recognized by the govern- ment, to leave his property in three parts--one to his clan, one to his wife, and one to his children. This applied only to wealth he had accrued by his own efforts and not to clan property he may have controlled. 14 The Fanti say a man should never carry a bunch of keys conspicuously displayed. He is often suspected of "bragging" that he has property to lock up. If, in fact, he does have a need for keys it is an invitation to visits from relatives or thieves. An interesting aspect of Fanti religion reflects the close ties of the clan. It is believed that those people who are "witches," that is, those who possess the power of evil magic, are effective only within the bounds of the matrilineal clan, and can harm only their kinsmen. It is not difficult to see how the association between the clan and evil magic could have developed, for innumerable instances arise which could cause friction within the group. These would be such matters as the allocation of land and houses, inheritance, and succession to tribal office. Failure in economic ventures is frequently attributed to a jealous kinsman who has this power of evil magic (see James B. Christensen, "The Adaptive Functions of Fanti Priesthood," in Continuity and Change in African Cultures, Wm. R. Bascom and M. J. Herskovits, eds., Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1959, ch. 14).</page><page sequence="11">134 SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY there is a low level of capital available to the African for investment, and the eco- nomic growth of Ghana has been, and will continue to be for some time, dependent in large part on foreign capital. The African who may have capital and is trying to go into business for himself is frequently faced with foreign practices he does not fully comprehend. These would be banking procedure, necessity of keeping accounts, an appreciation of the laws of supply and demand, government regula- tions, and honoring contracts. However, our concern here is with the adjustment of the traditional culture to an imported economic system. One of the factors that has inhibited economic change is the clan system cited above. The key to the social structure of the Fanti is the matrilineal clan or abusua. All members of the clan are held to be related by descent from a common ancestress, though this relationship may be more mythical than real. Clan members in turn may be divided into many matrilineages or extended families, that is, the uterine descendants of a female for three to five generations. It is in the matri- lineage and, in some contexts, the clan as a whole that the individual Fanti tradi- tionally found a high degree of security. Land is communally owned by the clan, and land and a house may be assigned by the clan elders. The lineage should provide the aid in case of debt or virtually any form of difficulty, coisperate in the worship and propitiation of the ancestors, and kinsmen are responsible for the elaborate burial and funeral so important to the Fanti. FUNCTION OF INTERMEDIARIES Importing in bulk is primarily in the hands of European-owned firms, as few Africans possess the combination of capital, experience, and the necessary permits to enable them to compete on this level. The large trading firms, in addition to supplying their own retail outlets, sell in bulk to African buyers who in turn may sell in wholesale lots or may retail directly to the consumer. It is not uncommon for imported goods to go through the hands of several middlemen before reaching the consumer, who out of necessity must buy in small quantities because of his lack of money. Kerosene, a common commodity, may be purchased by the thousands of gallons by an importer, but is eventually sold to the African by the bottle, and he brings his own container. Similarly, cube sugar imported in bulk often ends up being sold in the market at three cubes for a halfpenny. Bauer, in his comprehensive study of the West African economy, has pointed out the crucial role in the economic system of the intermediary, the petty trader, and the woman in the market. There is a common belief on the part of some economists that a reduction in the number of intermediaries would increase the value of agri- cultural output, or bring commodities to the consumer at a cheaper rate. In West Africa this has not been the case to date. In buying produce, it pays the large</page><page sequence="12">WEST AFRICAN TRIBE 135 firms to deal with intermediaries who buy in small lots from the farmers and sell to the firms in bulk. For one thing, it is cheaper than maintaining a staff of salaried workers to carry on the same task. In the distribution of imported goods, a multi- plicity of traders serve several important functions: (a) they enable the consumer to buy goods in small lots; (b) they save working capital by a wide geographical distribution of goods that would not be economically feasible to the large firms; (c) their operation results in a faster turnover of goods and thus a more intensive utilization of working capital; (d) they assist the importer in choice of goods by their contact with the consumer.15 From this it can be seen that the role of the petty trader and the woman or child selling in the market is not redundant or injurious to the economy. If their function were unwarranted, there is nothing to prevent the consumer from by- passing them to save the margin of profit they obtain for their services. As Bauer points out: The intermediaries are productive as they conserve real resources, especially capital, substituting for it semi-skilled and unskilled labour, which is abundant, stimulate pro- duction, and provide employment. Their trading methods are economic in that they use resources which are redundant, and economize in the use of capital and supervisory staff for which there is a keen demand and for which there are more valuable alterna- tive uses.16 AFRICAN ENTREPRENEURS Though trading and the market is traditionally considered a woman's role, some Fanti men have moved into the field as intermediaries. Some function as middle- men in cocoa-buying, where they use advances of capital from the buyer to pay the producer. Lending money on short-term loans is also a lucrative practice, as interest rates have been known to run as high as fifty percent in such cases. This high rate, exorbitant by European standards, is, in fact, a traditional practice among the Fanti and not an European introduction. Other forms of investment were in houses for rental income, lorries, taxis, canoes, and fish nets. In the case of investment in fishing equipment the return was that portion of the catch assigned to the canoe and net. Women tend to dominate marketing, and many of them have become entre- preneurs, sometimes on a large scale. This has been possible through improved lines of communication, availability of transport, an increase in the per capita income, and availability of imported goods. Some women will rent a lorry and have the driver take them along the coast, stopping at fishing villages where a large catch is reported. Here they will buy in wholesale lots from the women who smoke the fish, 15 P. T.

The entrepreneur may have a working agreement with several women in the inland markets who will either pur- chase the fish by the basket or retail them on a percentage basis. Other women, operating on a somewhat smaller scale, may take from two to six large baskets of fish to a market, paying to transport them in the trailer that is attached to some passenger lorries. They may either sell them wholesale or retail, or a combination of both. A woman who rents a lorry to transport fish into the interior need not haul a load both ways to make the rental pay, as the return trip can always be made as a passenger lorry. Some women who have the capital buy imported goods in wholesale lots from the European stores, usually such commodities as cloth, sugar, and tobacco. They in turn deal with market women who may retail for them on a percentage basis, or purchase in small lots. Some of these intermediaries become comparatively wealthy. A European store manager once indicated two women in his shop who he described as a "five thousand pound mammy" and a "ten thousand pound mammy," making reference to the credit rating they had established at his store. Neither of these women were literate, and bargaining was carried on in elementary Pidgin English, but both were trusted and respected customers of the firm. Some women invested their money in enterprises other than trading as some cases were encountered where they had purchased canoes or made a practice of lending money on a short term basis. THE CHANGING SCENE The status of women in Fanti society is relatively high when compared with the matrilineal societies of East Africa, and certainly high in comparison with most, if not all, of the partilineal groups in Subsaharan Africa. Contact with European culture has tended to improve the position of females, their position and role in the economy being one of the contributing factors. The men were tra- ditionally farmers, fishermen, hunters, or warriors, and selling was beneath their dignity, and the women have continued a practice that was theirs in the pre- contact culture. One result has been the possibility for a woman to become economically inde- pendent, as the profit she may make from trading or selling her farm produce is hers to use as she wishes. She may go into debt on her own, and her clan, rather than her husband, may be required to pay if she cannot. Many cases were encount- ered where a wife had lent money to her husband, and repayment was expected. Such exchanges were usually witnessed by a third party who could testify in court if the need arose. For example, one divorce case was observed where a husband ended up owing his wife money, for during their marriage she had lent him more</page><page sequence="14">WEST AFRICAN TRIBE 137 than the amount of the bridewealth her clan was required to return to him. Women who acquire wealth have a slight advantage over a male in a comparable position in that they are less likely to find impoverished kinsmen dependent on them. While it is permissible for a female to request aid for her male kin, the converse is much less likely to occur. While women may attach themselves to the household of a female entrepreneur, they may end up earning their keep by functioning as retailers in her trading activities. It should be noted that the right of women to profit from trading and to have wealth and property apart from that earned jointly with their spouses is of long standing among the Fanti, and pre-dates White contact. As indicated above, barter was a common practice in former times, and there was less opportunity to make a cash profit. Surplus produce was more likely to be used at a feast or in entertaining. However, the introduction of coined money, availability of trade goods, improved communications, and the acceptance of the principle that women may have and keep their own income has created a situation where there is less dependence on husbands or male relatives than was formerly the case. It is almost axiomatic that a society experiencing rapid social and economic change will manifest varying degrees of social disorganization. This is true among the Fanti where a large number of causal factors are involved. It is not possible here to discuss the many problems of society in transition, but one aspect related to the discussion of this paper can be noted. The increasing economic independence of women, due in large part to their ability to support themselves, wholly or in part, by trading, has not been without its social ramifications. While it is admittedly diflicult to obtain reliable statistics, there appears to be an increase in divorce, and an increase in the number of unions where the bridewealth is not paid, known as nwewe awar (nwewe, lover or mistress, and awar, marriage).17 Such a union is considered to have more advantages for the wife than the husband. While the male in this type of marriage has the responsibility of supporting his wife and their children, he does not have the control over his spouse that the payment of bride- wealth would convey. For example, he may not sue for indemnification in case of adultery, and the wife has greater freedom of movement. She can terminate the marriage when she wishes without the necessity of submitting the matter of divorce to the clan elders. It is not intended to imply that economic independence of women is the only, or even the primary, cause of an increased divorce rate, but only a contributing factor. 17 This term would not apply to the educated Fanti who are married in a church, and who may or may not pay bridewealth. For a discussion of the various types of Fanti marriage and the economic aspects involved see James B. Christensen, Double Descent Among the Fanti (New Haven: Human Relations Area Files, 1954), ch. 3.</page><page sequence="15">138 SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTI-IROPOLOGY Education of girls has had the effect of removing them from the ranks of those who work on the farms or in the market. Generally speaking, a girl who has finished Standard VI, or even less, will not condescend to trade in the market. Such tasks are considered beneath the dignity of a girl with schooling (just as farming or fishing are beneath the boy with schooling). Some of these girls con- tinue in school and learn special skills or become professional women, but those who end their formal education on the elementary level are regarded as problems by many of the Fanti. A complaint often voiced about the "schoolgirl" is that the bridewealth demanded for her is much too high, and following marriage she is an economic liability, as compared with her illiterate sister who may make a significant contribution to supporting the family. At the time of this research there were not enough girls in this category to constitute any problem; but with universal educa- tion in Ghana, it is likely that an increasing proportion of girls will no longer trade or farm, resulting in a pronounced change in the production and distribution of food. Imported goods have also had an effect on local production. Clay pots, formerly made in large numbers and a common item for sale in the market, are being replaced by metal containers. Imported beads have supplanted those made locally by the women. The male artisans are also affected, for the goldsmith is faced with the competition of cheap imitations from abroad, and a chair made by the carpenter is replacing a stool made by the carver. Other examples could be cited, and generally speaking, traditional arts and skills are disappearing. In summary, markets and a form of money are of considerable antiquity among the Fanti. A market of some sort is to be found in almost every village and town, with some open daily and others on specified days of the week. With the exception of a few traders of foreign provenience, buying and selling in the market is almost entirely in the hands of the women. A majority of these are women who go occa- sionally to dispose of produce, but others make trading their full-time vocation. The low level of capital available to the African, coupled with lack of expe- rience, has left much of the importing and exporting in the hands of foreigners. However, the African functions as an intermediary, both in terms of distribution of goods and in bulking for sale to the exporting firms. The multiplicity of traders has not been injurious to the economy in that it has aided distribution and collec- tion, and has utilized people who otherwise would not be gainfully employed. The rise in per capita income among the Fanti, and increased education, will remove increasing numbers from market trading. Over a period of time this may be expected to bring about more permanent establishments and less mass participation in markets and part-time selling. Fanti men, where they have gone into the market economy, have usually done so as intermediaries. The fact that marketing has</page><page sequence="16">WEST AFRICAN TRIBE 139 always been considered a task for females has enabled some of the women to become entrepreneurs and wealthy traders. It has also made it possible for many women to achieve economic independence, or at least decrease their dependence for support on a husband.
