Introduction by Beverley Sherry. Otago: U of Otago P, 2005. 282pp. ISBN 1-877139-75-0. $50.00 (paper). Richard J. DuRocher Milton as Multilingual assembles seventeen of John K. Hale's scholarly essays that place Milton's works in the context of the ten languages that the poet knew and used. As the author of Milton's Languages: The Effect of Multilingualism on Milton's Style (Cambridge, 1997), John Hale has previ ously explored this territory; he delves into it more deeply, if more nar rowly at times, in this collection. All but three of the essays in Milton as Multilingual have been previously published in academic journals. Dealing with topics including Milton's compositions in Greek and Italian, his translations from Hebrew (the Psalms), and the various translations of Par adise Lost into French, German, Dutch, Latin, and other languages, Hale's essays reflect something of Milton's own prodigious linguistic range. Yet at least ten of these essays deal primarily with Latin as the medium, base, or background against which to measure Milton's achievement. The pre dominance of Latin among Hale's studies makes sense for several reasons, not only because Milton wrote more in Latin than in all the other lan guages combined, but also because of Hale's status as the latest translator of De Doctrina Christiana. Because Milton's authorship of this Latin work has been challenged, Hale, as the self-styled "resident Latinist" of "an international consortium researching [the text's] provenance and textual condition," has, in recent years, primarily focused on Milton's Latinity. It is to Hale's findings regarding the De Doctrina Christiana, both in his four essays presented in this volume and in his eventual complete translation, that Miltonists will look for possibly the definitive word on the Latin treatise. Thus, Hale's work is of critical interest. The collection is organized into five sections: "Composing," "Language-Arts," "Self-Understanding," "Paradise Lost and its Early Reception," and "De Doctrina Christiana and Language-Issues." Head notes to each section and "Afterwords" to each essay give the book added coherence. A sampling from each section can only begin to indicate the essays' contents and contributions. "Composing" opens with Hale's 1982 essay on Epitaphium Damonis. Comparing this essay on the poem with Barbara Lewalski's commentary 63 © 2006 The Author.

DuRocher in her Life of John Milton sheds light on Hale's distinctive contribution, as Beverley Sherry suggests in her lucid introduction. Lewalski describes the epitaph as taking up a different challenge, poetically and personally, than Lycidas. Hale focuses on distinctive aspects of the Latin poem's lan guage: its synesthetic fusion of sense impressions, chiefly its "aurality"; its diction, "neither imitative nor obscure, but individual and creative"; and its prosody, "combining fidelity to exemplars, especially Virgil, with ease and independence." For example, of line 53 (" Pas tores que latent, stertit sub sepe colonus" ["The shepherds hide from the heat, and the farmworker snores under the hedge"]), Hale observes: The inhabitants of classical pastoral have more dignity and cultivation than to behave like this. But the visual, half humorous detail would not be out of place in Breughel, and readers who feel no discrepancy here between Milton and his models probably welcome within the bland pastoral fiction a humanizing touch of realism. This is criticism of a high order. Despite the value judgment implicit in "bland," Hale judiciously refuses to try to settle the long-running debate over Milton's overall attitude toward pastoral, noting that reactions to pastoral "tend to polarize into dismissiveness or defensiveness." Hale's approach, emphasizing what Latin pastoral can do, is surely more productive. The other two essays in this section likewise show the ways lan guage study opens up understanding of Milton's composition in specific genres, here the ode and polemical oratory. "Milton Meditates the Ode" is probably familiar to most Miltonists, as it won the Milton Society's Hanford Award for the most distinguished essay of 1994. Hale's charac teristic and valuable move is to look beyond Milton's English poems for his meditation on the ode in other languages: the fifteen-line canzone in Italian; the translation of Psalm 114 into Greek; the sprightly Latin poem to the Oxford librarian. Then Hale returns to the English poems, finding elements of the ode—principally its cultic, communal, celebra tory modalities—within both Paradise Lost and Samson Agonistes. The second essay in this section, focusing on style as rhetoric in Milton's (and his opponents') prose pamphlets, argues that—following the canons of classical rhetoricians, chiefly Quintilian—Milton appeals far more to open-minded readers of his Latin tracts than do his opponents. Under "Language-Arts," Hale includes essays on psalm translation, on Milton's textual emendation of Euripides, and on Milton as transla tor of poetry in general. Rather than evaluating Milton according to "the single rigid canon of fidelity," Hale remarks that we do better to recognize that, while respecting his sources and their original languages, © 2006 The Author.

Surely as Hale writes, employing a humorous instance of litotes, "Milton was not at the cutting edge of classical scholarship in his time." But how would seventeenth century classicists have regarded Milton's efforts? Hale's own scholarly method, the close examination of languages in action, seems to me nec essary but insufficient to answer the question he poses as one essay's title: "Why Did Milton Translate Psalms 80-88 in April 1648?" Hale rejects the attempts of David Masson, W R. Parker, and Margaret Boddy to connect these psalm translations with events in or around 1648, arguing that "each psalm is a speech-act from a cultic situation," which inher ently fuses the personal, the religious, and the political. One can grant that premise without sharing Hale's conclusion that Milton turned to these psalms as a "spiritual, as well as a translating, exercise." Throughout these essays, Hale admits little historical or social context into his lan guage study, but here he makes a titillating observation: "In the less hopeful and more threatening circumstances of 1648 [compared with the Thirty Years'War as context for Elegia Quarta], he is again comparing Israel to England, now teetering in crisis." Surely some features of Milton's psalm translations during that same month might be found responding to that pressurized environment? The next group of essays, again using the lens of multilingualism, addresses the notion of how Milton understood and presented himself. Especially revealing is "Milton's Self-Presentation in Poems, 1645," pre viously published in Milton Quarterly 25 (1991): 37-48. Whereas bilin gual collections by diverse hands abounded, no one, Hale points out, had presented himself in a twin volume of English and Latin poems. No one. More than sheer novelty, this feat announces a poet at once proud of his linguistic abilities and possessing what Hale calls "a multiple self, one that varies with the language roles adopted for each occasion." Readers of the twin volume can read the Latin poems first or, if they wish, as a separate collection (just as readers with only English tend to ignore the Latin poems). Miltonists may wish to read Hale's essay alongside Stephen Fallon's work on the poet's self-presentation. Concluding this section, Hale's essay on Milton's idea of the best way to write history claims that Milton's watchword, following Sallust, his favorite historian, is "concise ness." At least that is what Milton tells the young Frenchman, Henri de Brass, in a crisp Latin letter. Hale justly wishes that Milton had heeded his own advice in the History of Britain, where lengthy attacks on monas ticism and "moral fervor," though for the cause of liberty, too often retard his narrative. Four of Hale's essays deal with the early reception of Paradise Lost. The first traces the surprisingly numerous translations of Paradise Lost into Latin, "all by Englishmen for Englishmen." These translators recog © 2006 The Author. Journal compilation © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.</page><page sequence="4">66 Richard J. DuRocher nized, Hale points out, that the poem's sublimity was connected with its kinship with Latin, especially that of Virgil's Aeneid. Moreover, these translations helped Milton's work acquire the status of a classic. The reception history contained in this essay is a fascinating one, one that Hale has carefully charted. More polemical is Hale's essay on Richard Bentley's 1732 edition of Paradise Lost. Having examined Bentley's marginal notes in his working copy of the poem, Hale concludes that Bentley's "editing" amounts rather to "suppression of evidence, and obfuscation," which can best be understood as "a deeply-flawed ego trip." Specifically, Hale charges Bentley with lying about his use of the manuscript of Paradise Lost whereas he claimed "no manuscript exists," and with willfully indulging his personal taste, rather than following stan dard editorial practice of collating the available manuscript and author ial editions (1667 and 1674), thereby creating his unique text. In the next essay, "Paradise Lost, A Poem in Twelve Books—or is it Ten?" Hale in effect considers Milton as his own editor, as he prepared the poem for its first edition of 1667 and its second of 1674. Hale wants to answer a long-standing "double-yoked question": "What did Milton find less good about the first version? And better about the second one?" Hale's answer: "In 1674, [Milton] was both evening out the shape, as Addison saw, and making a Virgilian statement, as Barker saw. He was making a virtue of necessity." While this is beyond dispute, I find less convincing Hale's handling of some of the evidence. He takes at face value the claim of Thomas Ellwood, Milton's young Quaker reader, to have put into the poet's head the idea of a sequel to Paradise Lost. Hale sees this "change of mind," putatively prompted by Ellwood, as the "most startling" of several late changes of mind on Milton's part, including redividing the ten-book epic into twelve books. Yet, may not Milton have had in mind something like Paradise Regained long before 1665, when Ellwood claims to have inspired the sequel? And, rather than an abrupt change of mind, isn't the twelve-book version of Paradise Lost a natural, organic redistri bution on Milton's part of the lumpy, uneven ten-book division? In the final essay of this section, "Voicing Milton's God," Hale sets out to explain why the Father in Paradise Lost is, as he puts it simply, "dull." Hale blames Milton's combination of Homeric anthropomorphism and biblical synchronism for delivering an ever-present, all-too-human God. Hale's point is that Milton brings the worst aspects of these traditions to bear, producing an autocratic, Zeus-like figure with little of the "yearning mercy or Covenantal love" or the aesthetic richness found in the Bible. Multilingualism may apparently border on babble. In the collection's final section, dealing with De Doctrina Christiana, Hale's tone is more cautious and tentative. Perhaps this is owing to Hale's situation of being in medias res in translating the tract, which exists in a manuscript of over seven hundred pages. In his essay "On Translating © 2006 The Author. Journal compilation © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.</page><page sequence="5">Milton Quarterly 67 the De Doctrina Christiana," Hale lays out the principles guiding his work and offers a brief sample. Above all, Hale hopes his version will be regarded as "faithful," which he glosses both positively and negatively Positively, Hale aims to provide a translation sufficiently literal facing the Latin original, so that "even a diffident Latinist can see how the English comes out of the Latin." Negatively, Hale wants to avoid what he sees as the pitfalls marring the two complete translations, Bishop Sumner's printed in the Columbia edition, and John Carey's in the Yale prose. Specifically, Hale laments that Sumner, assuming Milton to be the text's author, "imports phrasing from Milton's own works" and thereby rigs the question of authorship. John Carey's "elegant" translation errs, Hale believes, by providing too "lucid and graceful" an English version for a Latin original often "clumsy or graceless," its sense inseparable from its long, syntactically involved clauses that Carey sometimes divides into sep arate sentences. Instead, Hale wants to render the Latin text "in all its wartiness." Even the notion of fidelity may get in the way of making sense, he warns, admitting that his own translation will show how "prag matics bedevil the ideological purity of any principle of fidelity." If this sounds like doublespeak, at least Hale is aware of the tightrope any mindful translator walks. The value of Hale's translation of De Doctrina Christiana ultimately depends on its accuracy, rather than theoretical polemics. Thus in this essay, published previously in Milton Quarterly 37 (2003): 1-10, Hale invites readers' comments on his translation of the tract's opening sentence: Equidem si dicerem propterea quod nihil aeque ac religio Chris tiana duas teterrimas pestes, servitutem ac metum, ex vita ac mente hominum eiiciat atque expellat, me idcirco studiosum huius potis simum doctrinae esse factum, non religione sed maximis vitae com moditatibus adductus fuisse arguerer. After discussing Sumner's and Carey's versions, Hale gives his "first attempt" to translate the passage: Indeed, if I were to say that I had concentrated my studies on this Christian doctrine for the reason that Christian god-fearing best banishes those two hideous afflictions, slavery and fear, from the life and minds of men, my motives could be impugned, as being no religious feeling but only the desire to maximize my own well-being. Responding to Hale's call for suggestions, I offer the following. He begins well by restoring to his translation the opening word "equidem" which both Sumner and Carey had omitted. For the opening clause, a © 2006 The Author. Journal compilation © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.</page><page sequence="6">68 Richard J. DuRocher more exact translation of the verb in its imperfect subjunctive tense would be the counterfactual, "if I were saying." For several of the sen tence's substantive terms, Hale gives English versions that strike me as idiosyncratic. Literally, "religio Christiana" is "the Christian religion," as Sumner put it; "Christian god-fearing," Hale's replacement, has no basis in the Latin text. (Hale's explanation that "religio Christiana" is clearly "what the King James Version calls 'the fear of God' " I find farfetched.) On the other hand, Hale's choice of the single verb "banishes" for the Latin pair "eiiciat atque expellat" conveys their meaning well, despite losing the stylistic effect of the doubling. For the sentence's final verb, "arguerer" Hale rightly prefers the adversarial "impugned" to a more neutral word, as its argumentative edge requires. Yet the logically connected verbal clause, "adductus fuisse," explaining that the author "had been drawn to [the Christian religion]," inexplicably drops out of Hale's translation, as it had of Carey's and Sumner's. If I seem to be quibbling with some of Hale's choices, it is because I share his sense of the need to get the opening right, as it establishes the tone and temper of the preamble, and thereby of the entire translation. A question many who turn to Hale's book will have in mind is what it shows about the authorship of De Doctrina Christiana. Was Milton the sole author, not the author, or one of several authors of the tract? About this issue, Hale offers no definitive word. Indeed, before he has finished his translation, to do so would be premature. Hale does, however, begin to show his hand. In one essay, an imagined dialogue with Maurice Kelley, he laments precisely the "eristic" edge of the De Doctrina, its rhetorical seeking always to have the final say. Hale writes: "My faith in the author's disinterestedness, his philaletheia, is weakened. This, Paradise Lost never does." Elsewhere, Hale observes that the argumentation in the Latin treatise is "more prolonged and obdurate" than that of Milton's Latin defenses. In the collection's final essay, "Notes on the Style of the Epistle to All the Churches: Observations and Implications," Hale indi cates that he has isolated a possible "fingerprint" that the author of the De Doctrina uses throughout this personal section of his work. That fin gerprint is the rather unprepossessing adverb "duntaxat," or "dumtaxat," which Lewis and Short translate as "to this extent, so far; in so far; simply, merely, only." The effect of this usage, Hale notes, is "to limit," whether that means limiting a word to a single sense or preventing wandering into Catholic superstition. This usage is fitting in that the author of De Doctrina comes across as an "impassioned delimiter—not an atheist or agnostic, but a Protestant opposed to transcendental Christology and pneumatology." Yet this is not the same thing, Hale hastens to add, as claiming that Milton is the author of De Doctrina.
