Since Wilde's own account of the trip does not survive, the sources are an article published by one of his travelling companions, George Macmillan, and the two editions of Rambles and Studies in Greece by J.P. Mahaffy, Wilde's former tutor at Trinity College Dublin and a major influence on his intellectual and social development. The first edition was pub- lished before Mahaffy took Wilde and Macmillan with him to Greece; the second after, containing new material derived from this, his second trip. Many of the responses Macmillan records in his article can be traced to Mahaffy's book, which I argue pro- vided a template to which Wilde and Macmillan could fit their encounter with Greece, an encounter experienced both as a loss and a recovery. The time Oscar Wilde spent in Greece as an undergraduate in 1877 and the ef- fect it had on his incipient Hellenism has never been the subject of detailed scrutiny, for the simple reason that Wilde's own account of the trip does not survive, the sources for his itinerary being an article published in 1878 by one of his travelling companions, George Macmillan (1855-1936; son of the pub- lisher Alexander Macmillan and after 1879 a partner in the firm),1 and the sec- 1. Macmillan's article is based on the letters he wrote to his family from Greece, now in the archive of the Hellenic Society (printed with the permission of the Council of the Society). He wrote to his mother from Corfu on April 2, 'Please keep all my Greek letters.' Thanks to Russell Shone of the Hellenic Society and to Christopher Stray (University College of Swansea, University of Wales) for alerting me to the existence of these letters and for providing me with copies.

Mahaffy, Wilde's former tutor at Trinity College Dublin and a major influence on his in- tellectual and social development. Many of the responses to Greece Macmil- lan records in his article can be traced to both the first (1876) and second editions of Mahaffy' s book, suggesting that Mahaffy, through the authority of both his textual and physical presence, provided a shaping structure around which Macmillan could organise his encounter with Greece, an encounter ex- perienced both as reminiscence and loss. I suggest that Wilde's responses, in- sofar as they can be recovered, can be profitably aligned with Macmillan's - a suggestion born out by previously unpublished, frustratingly fragmentary notes Wilde made on his return from Greece - while in later life he recuper- ated his own sense of loss at the encounter in ways unavailable to Mahaffy and Macmillan, professionally committed as they were to the increasingly positivist turn of classical studies. One of the innovations arising from the new archaeological approach to the classics in the 1870s was the anchoring of textual in physical Greece. By 1868 Matthew Arnold preferred Ernst Curtius's new history of Greece to George Grote's because of Curtius's intimate knowledge of the Greek land- scape Grote had never seen: round the monumental work of Mr. Grote there seems to hang a cer- tain air of the isolated scholar's study [...]. How simple and yet how instructive, how unlike the vagueness and coldness with which in the old histories of Greece Greek topography is presented to us is [Curtius's description] of the Cyclades.2 2.

(Berlin: Wëid- mannsche Buchhandlung, 1857-67), and first published in an English translation by Adolphus William Ward as The History of Greece. 5 vols. (London: R. Bentley, 1868-73). Ernst Curtius not only practised a new, archaeology-inspired and -illu- minated historiography but also reflected on the difference between mere textual knowledge of Greece and knowledge of texts, monuments, and landscape.

[. . .H]e might have gained a great deal of vividness by making himself personally familiar with modern Greece, and so feeling geographical facts in a way quite different from what can be gained by the most accurate study of books/ He too praised Curtius, who 'knows Greece thoroughly'.4 Wilde's only trip to Greece took place in April 1877, under the auspices of Mahaffy, whose stated aim, as reported by Macmillan, was to waylay him on his physical and spiritual journey to Rome.5 The letter Wilde wrote to the Dean of Arts at Magdalen College, Oxford (where he studied 'Mods' and 'Greats' from 1874 to 1878), explaining he would be missing the beginning of Hilary (Easter) Term is a masterpiece of bland insolence: My dear Mr Bramley, My old tutor Mr Mahaffy, Fellow of Trinity College Dublin, met me on my way to Rome and insisted on my going with him to Mykenae and Athens. The chance of seeing such great places - and in such good company - was too great for me and I find myself now in Corfu. I am afraid I will not be able to be back at the beginning of term. I hope you will not mind if I miss ten days at the beginning: seeing Greece is really a great education for anyone and will I think benefit me greatly, and Mr Mahaffy is such a clever man that it is quite as good as going to lectures to be in his company.6 For a student of classics to claim that 'seeing Greece is really a great education' may now seem unexceptionable, but in the Oxford of the 1870s, which, under the influence of Benjamin Jowett's enmity towards research and profession- alisation, 'kept classical archaeology firmly outside the undergraduate cur- riculum' and valued the pen over the spade,7 any assertion of the value of a trip to Greece, particularly one undertaken in preference to attending lectures, carried combative implications. The repeated invocations of Mahaffy - 'such a clever man' - well known for his support for archaeology and readiness to square up to Oxbridge scholars, might also have been designed to provoke.

Symonds. In the first volume of his Studies of the Greek Poets Symonds, who as yet had not visited Greece, though he had been to Italy, assumed a homogenous Mediterranean character - 'rounded forms [...] defined outlines' - that allowed him to offer the un-Greek landscape of the Bay of Naples as illustrative of the Greek tem- perament: 'Serenity and intelligence characterize this southern landscape, in which a race of splendid men and women lived beneath the pure light of Phoebus, their ancestral god' in a 'sea of everlasting laughter'.13 In Greek art and literature we read 'the language of that moderate and lucid harmony which we discover in the landscape of the Greeks'.14 In 1873 Symonds visited the 'sunny but barren hills of Attica'15 for the first (and only) time, necessitat- ing a revision of his Italiote vision of serenity, harmony and laughter: Greece is the land of mountains, not of rivers or of plains [...]. Aus- terely beautiful, not wild with an Italian luxuriance [...] they seem the proper home of a race which sought its ideal of beauty in dis- tinction of shape and not in multiplicity of detail, in light and not in richness of colouring, in form and not in size.16 8.

The har- mony and balance of the scenery [...] are sympathetic to the tem- perance of Greek morality, the moderation of Greek art. The radiance with which it is illuminated has all the clearness and distinction of the Attic intellect.17 In attributing the 'impassioned and erotic' character of the literature of the is- lands to the 'rich' and 'sensuous' environment that produced it Wilde both follows and enlarges upon Symonds, insofar as he saw more of Greece and the particularities of its different regions. That Wilde - at this time an avid reader of Symonds - so positively imputed to the Greek landscape the affective qual- ities of Greek poetry, as though the latter were the extracted essence of the former, lends point to his preference for seeing Greece over placating the col- lege authorities. In later life he might have theorized that the literature pro- duced the landscape, and stayed at home. In August 1876 Wilde was reading and, he claimed, 'correcting' the proofs of Mahaffy's book Rambles and Studies in Greece, an account of Mahaffy's first trip to Greece in 1875.18 Mahaffy, their charismatic guide to a country he had seen and they had not, provided, through his book and through his personal authority, a template to which his young friends - Wilde, William Goulding and George Macmillan - could fit their experiences of Greece with him in April 1877, as Macmillan demonstrated in reproducing the tropes of Rambles and Studies in Greece in his article 'A Ride across the Péloponnèse' in Black- wood's Edinburgh Magazine in May 1878, some of which can also be traced in 17. Ibid., p. 207. 18. OW to William Ward, 6 August 1876, ibid., pp. 27-29; p. 28. W.B. Stanford and R.B. McDowell, Mahaffy: A Biography of an Anglo-Irishman (London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1971), p. 40, point out that Wilde is not acknowledged in the preface to Rambles and Studies in Greece, as he had been in the preface to Mahaffy's Social Life in Greece (London: Macmillan &amp; co., 1874); Wilde's knowledge of J.A.F.A. Meineke's Fragmenta Comicorum Graecorum, 5 vols. (Berlin: G. Reimer, 1839-57), for which he had won the 1874 Berkeley Medal for Greek at Trinity (Ellmann, Oscar Wilde [above, n. 8], p. 30), made him a suitable critic of the earlier book, for which Meineke was a principal source. Of course Wilde's knowledge of Plato, Aristo- phanes, Xenophon and the Attic orators, also drawn on by Mahaffy in Social Life in Greece, would have recommended him too, but his demonstrated knowledge of the comic fragments would have given him the edge over other students: the questions set by Mahaffy for the Berkeley Medal examination explicitly treat the fragments as a source of sociological evidence (those set by R.Y. Tyrrell, Wilde's other tutor at Trinity, treat them as a stylistic resource; Dublin University Examina- tions, 1875, pp. 66-73), and a significant proportion of a notebook Wilde used while preparing for the examination is filled with details of social life at Athens har- vested from Meineke (MS William Andrew Clark Memorial Library, Los Angeles, W6721M3 G793 1873). It seems unlikely Mahaffy would have asked him to repeat the critical service in the case of a travel book about a country he had not yet vis- ited.</page><page sequence="6">Ross 181 Wilde's notes. In the same year Mahaffy brought out a revised edition of Ram- bles and Studies in Greece, supplemented with descriptions of the places he had visited with Wilde, Macmillan and Goulding: Olympia, Arkadia, and the newly excavated Mykenai.19 Wilde's name is never mentioned in either Mahaffy's or Macmillan's ac- count of their time in Greece, a tantalizing lacuna for the reader whose pri- mary interest in them is that they describe one of his formative experiences. On the way to Megalopolis the owner of the horses the party had hired drew a knife on one of the riders, 'the only one of us who carried a revolver. The ar- rested rider, with great presence of mind, drew this weapon from his pocket and pointed it at his assailant's breast'.20 The standoff concluded without bloodshed. For Wilde's early biographer Hesketh Pearson, the temptation to attribution was too great: 'trouble might have ensued if Oscar had not pro- duced a revolver.'21 Richard Ellmann is more scrupulous: 'there is no reason to assume it was Wilde.'22 1 take the perhaps greater liberty of assuming that Wilde's responses to Greece can be plausibly if cautiously assimilated to those recorded by Macmillan and Mahaffy, given the degree to which the former coincides with the latter, an assumption Wilde's notes also support. First Sightings Mahaffy explicitly stated the purpose of his book to be the rooting of ancient Greek history in the modern Greek landscape, and the demonstration of con- tinuity between ancient and modern Greek racial stock.23 In this latter ambi- tion he sought not to elevate the modern Greek but to counter the 'false idealisation' of the ancient, though he found the physical beauty of the Dori- ans to survive in the blond children of modern Argos.24 His account of his first sight of Greece from shipboard early in the morning is an account of reminis- cence, anamnesis, rather than discovery: 'while others slept, I started up at half- past three in the morning, eager to get the earliest possible sight of the land which still occupies so large a place in our thoughts.'25 Walter Pater wrote of Winckelmann that 'in his fantastic plans for foreign travel [. . .] there seems al- ways to be rather a sense of something lost to be regained, than the desire of discovering anything new', 26 and for Mahaffy, who could identify without a map the islands and contours of a land he was seeing for the first time, the sense was of recollection not just desired but achieved: 'I stood there, I know not how long [. . .] telling myself the name of each mountain and promontory, and so filling out the idle names and outlines of many books with the fresh re- ality itself.'27 19.

The moon shining in through the cabin window woke me at 3.30; but though I looked out eagerly to catch a first sight of the wished-for shore, nothing was to be seen as yet but sea and sky. At five I awoke once more, and this time saw two small islands lying to our right - outposts of Hellas! No more sleep for me.28 The approach is gradual and erotic: first knowledge and desire, then deferral of gratification, finally the first concessions from the beloved, 'two small is- lands'. Wilde's notes reproduce the elements of Mahaffy's and Macmillan's descriptions almost exactly: The first sight of Greece I got was from the deck of [...] we had left Brindisi the night before, and early in the morning came in view of the [&gt;]low mountainous[&lt;] coast of Thessaly [a slip for Epiros; ...] soon landed in Corfu. Once Corfu and the west coast had revealed themselves Macmillan's principal response appears to have been to the colours of the landscape, and large parts of his article are concerned with fixing precisely what those colours were: 'rich greenish blue', 'brilliant pale green', 'rich orange', 'deep purple', 'rosy pink', 'dark slaty blue'.29 Wilde too, in a letter to his mother from Corfu, wrote of its 'richness of colour': 'delicate grey-green and silver', 'rich purple', 'crimson'.30 These colours were the suddenly overwhelmingly physical mark- ers of a place that until then had been a country of the mind alone, material- ising now as if summoned out of spirit. In Corfu, wrote Macmillan, 'to our delight, we saw actual Greek names and descriptions over the shop doors, and heard - though as yet without understanding - the same tongue in the mouths of the people'.31 The language that they had known only through 28.

[...] This sensitiveness of the Attic limestone to every modification of the sky's light gives a peculiar spir- ituality to the landscape.' Sketches in Italy and Greece (above, n. 15), p. 208.

The language - al- tered by the centuries but, as Mahaff y pointed out, far less so than English in a far shorter timespan32 - embodied that continuity between modern and an- cient Greece that he liked to emphasize. Macmillan had one reservation about their approach: 'All this was very lovely, and quite fulfilled one's idea of what Greece and the Greek isles should be; nevertheless it was difficult to suppress the feeling that, after all, we were not yet in true Greece. We were entering by the back door/33 This feeling orig- inated in Mahaffy's account of the relative topographies of Italy and Greece: Italy, with the Apennines running down its east coast, faced west, Greece, with the Acroceraunian mountains on its west coast, faced east.34 Thus, culturally and commercially, Greece had throughout its history been more part of the Levant than of Europe: 'even now the face of Athens is turned, as of old, to the East.'35 But Mahaffy, although he too wanted to fix the particularity of the landscape through its colours, insisting that polychromatic sculpture and ar- chitecture could be understood only when imagined in a Mediterranean panorama,36 repeatedly assimilated the Greek landscape and monuments to Ireland: the Acropolis was like the rock of Cashel, Staigue Fort at Kerry was 'the Irish Tiryns', the tombs of Mykenai were like Newgrange at Boyne, a com- parison for which Mahaffy had the precedent of Sir William Wilde, Oscar's fa- ther.37 In his luggage on his second trip he had Sir William's catalogue of the prehistoric Irish goldwork in the Royal Irish Academy,38 which he consulted in examining the gold artefacts Schliemann had found at Mykenai in the pre- vious year.39 Like prehistoric Ireland, Mycenean Greece could be recovered through archaeology alone.40 'I can never forget', Mahaffy wrote, 'the strong 32.

[. . .] Nowhere have I seen a like purple colour, except in the wilds of Kerry and Con- nemara/41 For the Irishmen of the party, coming to Greece was literally like coming home. The archetype that Mahaffy recognised in the topography of Greece was one to which the topography of Ireland conformed too, one that Wilde would associate with political autonomy and romantic individualism, as the ire provoked in him by Mahaffy' s future attempt to detach Hellenism from these ideals would demonstrate. When Macmillan 'at last set foot in real Hellas' (Katakolo Bay in the north-western Péloponnèse) the epithet he chose to attach to the scene, 'pure and mellow with the radiance of the setting sun', is rich in anamnestic asso- ciations: 'homelike'.42 Here Wilde produced a sonnet, 'Hellas! Hellas!' (reti- tled 'Impression de Voyage' in Poems [1881]): The sea was sapphire-coloured; and the sky Glowed like a heated opal through the air; We hoisted sail, the wind was blowing fair For the blue lands that to the Eastward lie. From the steep prow I marked with eager eye Zakynthos, every olive-grove and creek, Ithaca's cliff, Lykaon's snowy peak, Parnassos and the hills of Arkady.

When 'gan the West to burn, And a red sun upon the seas to ride, I stood upon the soil of Greece at last! Katacolo, 1877.43 The colours are duly noted - sapphire, opal, blue, red - and Wilde too dates his arrival on 'real' Hellenic soil from his first setting foot in the Péloponnèse. Macmillan took a naïve positivist pleasure in testing poetic epithets against their origins: 'It was pleasant to find, as we neared Zante, that Homer's epi- thet - "woody" - might still be attached with some truth'; 'the wind [. . .] called forth from the glassy surface of the water that avTipiöpov yeXaoMa - that count- less laughter - of which Greek poets never tired of singing.'44 But part of the encounter with Greece was the epistemological shock of one's preconceptions 41.

A voyage to Hellas could be experienced as a loss as much as a recov- ery.45 The first hint of disappointment shadows Macmillan's response to the same scene that moved Wilde to a sonnet: Far inland we could see Parnassus [...;] away down to the south glit- tered [...] Lycaon [...]. Perhaps nothing in the whole of our journey made one realise so clearly, as did this panorama, the smallness of Greece. Who, for instance, would have supposed that Parnassus was visible from Zacynthus and Ithaca [...]? [...] A similar surprise awaited us when we found that the Acrocorinthus could be seen from the Athenian Acropolis.46 Wilde's poem, then, in formalising a conventionally celebratory response to arrival in Greece, may have functioned as an apotropaion, an averting gesture aimed at the threatened loss of the Hellenic ideal.47 Olympia and Disappointment The group's first excursion, to Olympia (guided by Gustav Hirschfeld, direc- tor of the excavations, which had been initiated by Curtius),48 provoked Macmillan, initially, to outright dissatisfaction: It must be confessed [...] that for one who saw here his first Greek temple, this temple [of Zeus] at Olympia in its present state was pro- foundly disappointing. [...] I was [...] not prepared [...] for the ex- treme coarseness of the material. One somehow had a notion, cherished even in the face of obvious facts, that no Greek architect would look at anything less attractive than Parian marble.49 But by the afternoon Macmillan had come to understand that he must ac- commodate himself to the facts, and not vice versa: Sitting there among the mighty fragments, one came to admire their rugged grandeur and to forget the hard thoughts which, at first sight, 45. This sense of loss is not to be confused with that detailed in David Constantine's Early Greek Travellers and the Hellenic Ideal (Cambridge : Cambridge University Press, 1984). The 'elegiac tone' (p. 63) he detects in the accounts of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century travellers in Greece is connected to the visible depreda- tions of time and the Turks rather than the invisible refurbishment of an idea.

[...] Then, too, the historic associations of the place began to assert themselves. [...] By how many of the greatest men of old Greece might this [pavement] not have been trod50 Macmillan emphasizes that the site, busy with workmen in the morning, was empty in the afternoon, thus enabling his historical imagination to people the previously inert remains. The great men of old Greece he evoked had previ- ously existed for him only in books, but that was more life than marble alone could offer. A conjunction of text and artefact was necessary to animate the lat- ter, but text could stand and had stood alone, though its readings could be modified. The unearthing of the pedimental sculptures and the metopes of the temple of Zeus offered a notable example of such modification, attributed as they were, on the testimony of Pausanias, to Alkamenês and Paionios, who had for centuries been mere names to us. And yet of Alkamenês, Pausanias says that he was second only to his contemporary Phidias, in the making of statues.51 Mahaffy, again echoing Arnold's disparagement of Grote's work with its 'certain air of the isolated scholar's study' (above, p. 177), made large claims for archaeology's transformation of historiography: 'The writing of an- cient history was once an affair of the study, of comparing the statements of a certain number of authorities in dead languages, and drawing inferences from what they said. All this is now changed.'52 But he too recorded his disap- pointments with the material epiphany of Greece. His initial and greatest disappointment was with the Akropolis.53 His de- scription of his first sighting of it, from his hotel window in 1875, emphasized its geological over its cultural status: there, right opposite, stood the rock which of all rocks in the world's history has done the most for literature and art, the rock [...] which is ever new and ever old, ever fresh in its decay, ever perfect in its ruin, ever living in its death - the Acropolis of Athens.54 Rocks endure, cultures come and go, as the ruined Parthenon testifies. The extravagance of the encomium hints at the necessity of talking up this rock it if was to meet expectation. Next comes the cataloguing of the colours: 'the lights were of a deep rich orange, and the shadows, of dark crimson, with the deeper lines of purple.'55 Mahaffy allows more than fifty pages to pass be- 50.

And at first we look in vain. The shattered pillars and the torn pediments will not bear so great a strain: and the traveller feels forced to admit a sense of disappointment, sore against his will. He [. . .] has reached at last what his soul had longed so many years in vain: and as is wont to be the case with all great human longings, the truth does not an- swer to his desire. [. . .] But to those who have not given way to those feelings - who have gone again and again and sat upon the rock [. . .] - there first come back the remembered glories of Athens' greatness, when Olympian Pericles stood upon this rock with care-worn Phidias, and reckless Alcibiades with pious Nicias, and fervent Demosthenes with caustic Phocion [...]. And then the glory of re- membered history casts its hue over the war-stained remnants.56 The ruins compel recognition of the fragility and silence of material culture; the rock, and by extension Greek topography in its comparable permanence, are reclaimed as symbols of the enduring life of the mind. Macmillan's expe- rience at Olympia corresponds to Mahaffy's recorded experience at Athens in each particular: erotic success immediately becoming pyrrhic victory, until the imagination recovers from its initial recoil and animates the stark new facts by assimilating them to the previous - textual - knowledge they nearly displaced. Only through a daily assault on the rock until its unfamiliarity is tamed by habit (and to make something habitual is to make it invisible) can 'the glory of remembered history' (remembered from books) reassert its dominance. In the second edition of Rambles and Studies in Greece Mahaffy arraigned archaeology for destroying the beauty of Greece in bringing to light the things of its past: 'When we came to the real Olympia the prospect was truly disen- chanting. However interesting excavations may be, they are always exceed- ingly ugly.'57 His memories of the unexcavated Mykenai of his first trip had now been 'profaned by modern research. It is, I suppose, ungrateful to com- plain of these things, and we must admit that great discoveries outbalance the aesthetic damage done to an ancient ruin by digging unsightly holes and pil- ing mounds of earth about it'.58 The excavations, profaning and disenchanting scars in the landscape of Greece, physically enacted the epistemological as- sault of newly professionalised 'modern research' on the romantic atemporal Greece that had been for Keats and others an aesthetic ideal and an imagina- tive resource. Mahaffy, with his outspoken enthusiasm for archaeology and determinedly iconoclastic presentation of the classical Greeks as cowardly and excitable liars,59 was cheerfully complicit in this assault, but the terms in which 56.

Arkadia: Bussai and Tegea From Olympia the party rode to the temple of Apollo at Bassai in the moun- tains of southern Arkadia, stopping overnight in Andritzena, where they slept on the floor in a room containing 'nothing but one whole chair, one with a broken back, and a few three-legged stools'.59 Both Mahaffy and Macmillan were at pains to warn of the discomfort of travel in Greece. Arkadia's literary pedigree, inaugurated by the Italian Renaissance poet Iacopo Sannazaro and deftly rehearsed by Mahaffy as a short history of pastoralism,61 had no roots in the 'wild grandeur' and 'bare grey hillsides' of the land itself.62 The temple appeared an anachronistic avatar of romantic sublimity: No more striking site could be imagined. The ledge on which the temple stands runs out from a grand amphitheatre of rugged moun- tains, all of the cold grey tone peculiar to a limestone formation. The barrenness of the hillsides is relieved by little or no vegetation. Only here and there stands a single stunted oak, [...] the only representa- tives of life in a scene of utter desolation.63 Macmillan and Mahaffy agreed in seeing the limestone temple as some fan- tastic natural outcrop of the landscape: 'the effect of the temple - being of the same grey hue as the hills around - is, that one almost loses the sense of its ar- tificiality, and comes to regard it rather as a natural growth, a strange and beautiful product of some geological disturbance';64 it 'seemed almost to have grown out of the rock, as its natural product/65 Mahaffy, at least, was alert to the atypicality of this solitary temple in its wild landscape: 'Greek life is a sort of protest for cities and plains and human culture, against picturesque Alps and romantic scenery/66 To the first edition of Rambles and Studies in Greece he had appended a chapter on Greek paint- ing in which he explained the absence of landscape painting among the Greeks: this was 'not from want of perceiving the beauty of external nature, but from a different way of perceiving it [...]. Primitive people never, so far as I know, enjoy what is called the picturesque in nature'.67 Nature was merely an inconvenience, as Wilde, though in no spirit of primitivism, would char- acterize it in 'The Decay of Lying'.

They did not oppose themselves to nature', but saw it through the cate- gories of 'their religion, a sort of anthropomorphic pantheism'. The human form was all-encompassing: to the Greek the most adequate representation of a landscape was a representation of the gods who were identified with its rivers and mountains. In the commonplace book he kept at Oxford Wilde noted the Greeks' plastic rendering of Landscape scenery - the Faun of Praxiteles with all the mystery and wantonness of the woods about him, the river nymph of Scopes, in whose tangled hair and melancholy eyes the restless sorrows of great waters fo[un]d its plastic utterance, these gave to the Greeks what the vague and misty splendour of Turner gives to us[.]72 And in 'The Decay of Lying' (1891) Mahaffy's insistence that culture and rep- resentation precede nature and perception becomes Vivian's doctrine that in nature, 'the collection of phenomena external to man, people only discover in her [...] what they bring to her'.73 As if in illustration of this theory's application to persons as well as places, Macmillan recorded a curious incident in the museum at Tegea, also in Arcadia: as they examined its contents, the locals examined them through the one small window.

No cameo was ever finer than this face of flesh and blood. Thinking that here at last was the fair Greek maiden we had pictured in our dreams, we looked eagerly round, as we came out of the cottage, to find the owner of the face among the crowd. Greatly to our surprise we traced it to an awkward half-grown lad, of some fourteen or fif- teen years, who slunk around among his companions as if half- ashamed of his beauty. It was a disappointment; for the character of the face was undoubtedly feminine - and one felt that in a boy its perfect beauty was marred by the lack of strength and firmness. Nev- ertheless it was a face not easily to be forgotten.74 What is perhaps most surprising about this passage is that no biographer has taken advantage of the temptingly anonymous plurality of its 'we'. Macmil- lan's desire to find 'the fair Greek maiden we had pictured in our dreams' takes its hope of fulfilment from Mahaffy's belief that the modern Greeks were the direct descendents of the ancient. But beauty among the classical Greeks was a conventional attribute of boys more than of women. Dreams of fair Greek maidens blended two modern conventional attributions of beauty, one to a race, the Greeks, and one to a sex, the female. The apparition of the boy with the woman's face is like a chimera born of this confusion of categories. Macmillan links his 'disappointment' not to the boy's beauty, but to that beauty's 'feminine' character, its 'lack of strength and firmness'. Admiration for feminine beauty in boys was a feature of Hellenistic and Roman culture, the degeneration of an ideal; for the classical Greeks, beauty in boys was linked to developing masculinity.75 The boy at the museum, slinking around 'half-ashamed of his beauty', has no place in either of the privileged discourses of beauty, ancient or modern. The best-known representative of the classical ideal was Charmides, as depicted in Plato's eponymous dialogue, whose physical beauty is matched by his instinctive sense of sôphrosunê ('moderation', 'reserve'). That Wilde, with perhaps keener historical awareness than Macmillan, knew where beauty would be found if Mahaffy's theory of racial continuity was correct is sug- gested by his statement in his review of the Grosvenor Gallery, published three months after his return from Greece, that in the Greek islands 'boys can still be found as beautiful as the Charmides of Plato';76 he knew what to bring to these external phenomena in order to discover what he sought in them. 74.

Macmillan makes a revealing com- parison of the current states of Argos and Mykenai: '[Argos] is so modern, so busy and full of life, that even what few relics of the past remain are almost forgotten in the stir of the present. At Mycenae no disturbing element comes in to break the contemplation of its mighty past/77 The implication that the flux of human population obscures the permanence of the Greek landscape and its classical artefacts, hindering its habitation by more enduring figures of the imagination, recalls Macmillan's inability to bring Olympia to life until it had been emptied of people. Mahaffy too had experienced the bustle and noise of Piraeus as antithetical to the Greece of his imagination, even as he produced evidence from Plato that the harbour had been similarly busy in classical times; only when he was on an empty road to Athens could he feel that he had finally come home.78 One of the few remaining classical sites at Argos was the theatre, 'one of the finest in all Greece', according to Macmillan: Though much overgrown with grass and flowers, the rows of seats are still quite distinct. From the top one gets a glorious view of the rich Argolic plain, bounded on the east by the blue waters of the Gulf [...]. Considering the very prominent part played by Argos in Greek history [...] it is disappointing to find so few remains of pristine greatness. Save the theatre [...] nothing remains to tell that Argos was once a great city.79 The disappointment registered is of a different kind from that provoked by the failure of real Greece to correspond to imagined Greece; it is a conventional ro- mantic nostalgia, inherited from the first Western travellers in the Ottoman Empire,80 and as such an acceptable subject for Wilde's poetry: Nettles and poppies mar each rock-hewn seat: No poet crowned with olive deathlessly Chants his glad song, nor clamorous Tragedy Startles the air; green corn is waving sweet Where once the Chorus danced to measures fleet; Far to the East a purple sea, The cliffs of gold that prisoned Danae; And desecrated Argos at my feet.

Argos, 1877s1 The Greek peninsular was never (in historical times) any larger than it is now, the materials of its surviving artefacts never any finer, but 'desecrated Argos' was once more than it is. The ruined theatre signifies an ideal irrecoverable but also pristine in its temporal témenos, forever unsubmissive to the test of posi- tive evidence, while the reference to the mythical Danae, given ontological status equal to that of the historical poet and chorus who would have enacted her story in the theatre, acknowledges that Greek history, like Greek myth, survives now as an aspect of the individual imagination. Ellmann gives the impression that Mahaffy, Wilde, Macmillan and Gould- ing met Schliemann at nearby Mykenai - 'where Mahaffy's name earned them access to Schliemann's recently discovered treasures'82 - but in fact the exca- vations had been concluded the year before, and the treasures moved to a vault in Athens.83 Mahaffy was one of the first to appreciate the importance of Schliemann's finds at Troy and Mykenai, hailing him for having 'proved what no scholar, save a comparative mythologist, ought ever to have doubted' - that the Iliad was associated with a real site.84 But Schliemann, the gifted am- ateur, also aggravated Mahaffy's ambivalence towards the professionalisation of classical studies to which he offered formal allegiance: Schliemann pos- sessed 'that sort of divine instinct which Nelson possessed when he set out to look for the French fleet': 'the instinct of true genius.'85 Schliemann's naïve faith in the truth of the Iliad, unerring ability to dig in the right place and fan- tastic luck in unearthing treasures even he had not anticipated suggested that the technê of the academy was redundant; enthousiasmos alone had found gold at Mykenai. Writing in Macmillan' s Magazine in 1878, Mahaffy expressed com- punction at mixing his praise for Schliemann's achievements with scholarly demurrals at his more colourful assertions: 'And now there will be added to his trials the sceptical doubts and the refutations of scholars, who sit at home and view, through the microscope of criticism, his bold and poetical theories!'86 The compliance with which the Greek soil yielded up whatever the bold and poetical Schliemann expected to find there, and more, stunningly literalises Wilde's later formulation that people find in nature only what they bring to her. His example would be less spectacular: Wordsworth finding in the stones of the Lake District the sermons he had hidden there.87 81.

In his letters from Athens Macmil- lan admits none: 'the greatest day of my life - the day to which for years I have looked forward. [. . .] I went to be impressed - 1 went knowing almost ex- actly what it [the Akropolis] would be like - and yet the reality surpassed all my expectations in beauty and grandeur so that I was almost overwhelmed';90 'I was really speechless with awe when I first stood within its walls, on the very pavement that has been trodden by so many mighty spirits.'91 Fore- warned by Mahaffy's example, his companions may have determined in ad- vance what their reactions would be ('I went to be impressed'). Wilde's response may be preserved in Julia Constance Fletcher's 1878 novel Mirage:92 He was speaking to her of Greece, of Athens - the city of the early morning - rising in the cool, pale, steady light of dawn, a new Aphrodite, from out of the lapping circle of the waves. He spoke to her of the Parthenon, the one temple - not a building - a temple, as complete, as personal as a statue. And that first sight of the Acropo- lis, the delicate naked columns rising up in the morning sunshine: 'It was like coming upon some white Greek goddess. It made one feel _'93 The likelihood that this is the manner in which Wilde spoke of Athens and the Akropolis is increased by the marked correspondence between Davenant's (Fletcher's fictionalised Wilde) insistent personalisation of the city and its tem- ple - 'a new Aphrodite'; 'a temple [...] as personal as a statue'; 'It was like coming upon some white Greek goddess' - and Mahaffy's account of the 88.

In his commonplace book Wilde noted that 'Greek art remains on the surface and translates into marble the humanised aspects of the exter- nal world'.94 If Mahaffy gave an irreproachably scientific record of his re- sponses to long-desired Athens, it seems plausible that Wilde would have taken his cue from the Greeks themselves and, as at Katakolo and Argos, for- mally conflated perception and muthopoiêsis, pouring his impressions into an- thropomorphic molds: a hypothesis supported both by his description of his account of his time in Greece as 'enthusiastic' (from the Greek enthousiastikos, 'possessed by a god') and 'full of metaphor', and by what in later life he is said to have said of his visit to Olympia. Both Mahaffy and Macmillan noted that the head of Apollo from the pediment of the temple of Zeus and the statue of Hermes with the infant Dionysos attributed to Praxiteles were found re- spectively before and after their visit.95 But Wilde gave Charles Ricketts a de- tailed description of the discovery of not just the head of Apollo but the rest of him too: 'Yes, during the excavations, I was present when the great Apollo was raised from the swollen river. I saw his white outstretched arm appear above the waters.'96 According to Ellmann, he also told Robert Ross that he had been present at the discovery of the Hermes of Praxiteles, a plaster bust of which he kept in his study in Tite Street. Wilde told Ricketts that the 'plas- ter did not retain the beauty and transparency of the marble, which is like ivory lit by the sun'.97 Ricketts was not taken in, was probably not meant to be: I never felt quite certain if indeed he had been present when the great Apollo had been brought to light [...]. I imagined that 'the great white arm of the god rising from the waters' was perhaps a sonorous phrase, and I confess I was incredulous when told that the Hermes of Praxiteles [...] surpassed all impressions of it given by casts, and that 'the spirit of the god still dwelt within the marble.' [...] I knew that with Wilde a phrase counted enormously. His was the typical literary temperament to whom words are realities and the sound of a sentence in itself convincing.98 Wilde's lies, with their vivid recall of statues he had never seen, reclaim Greece, even the new Greece uncovered by archaeology, for the imagination, making of it a fresh pretext for oral composition; significantly, unlike Mahaffy and Macmillan - the one a professional classicist, the other the publisher of the 94.

Even if Ellmann's statement that 'Greece had been all that he [Wilde] hoped' is true,100 though it seems likely his immediate responses did not differ greatly from Macmillan's and Mahaffy's, with their disappointments and accommo- dations, the fact that in future he stayed away suggests that he saw no reason to dislocate once again the Greece of imagination and, now, memory. For the spirit of the god to dwell still in the marble the marble had to dwell in the mind alone. Appendix: Wilde's notes on his time in Greece The numerals in square brackets denote the first and second folios, which are unpag- inated. The horizontal line in [1] represents an ink stroke by Wilde. At line 6 [A] as- sumes that 'low mountainous' at line 5 should be read as an insertion between 'the' and 'coast'. All ampersands represent the simple loop Wilde uses for 'and'. The irregular word distribution and line breaks of the original have been preserved.

Thanks to Christopher Stray for pointing out to me that the olive harvest would have been in October or November. The only possible harvest in April would have been of green (immature) barley, for animal feed (usually cut in May). Macmillan refers to 'the lovely waving green of the barley' around Mykenai in a letter of April 14 to his brother Malcolm.</page><page sequence="21">196 International Journal of the Classical Tradition / June 2009 of people from the country and in the gate of city like a children.
