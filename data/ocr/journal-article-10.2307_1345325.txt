Dorrit Cohn's book consists of two sections, one devoted to first-person narratives with their "incarnated narrators who inhabit the fictional reality they relate" (4), the other concerned with third-person narratives, the province of the "clairvoyant, disincarnated narrator" (5). Professor Cohn immediately warns us against simplistic distinctions which might impute "inwardness" exclusively to first-person narrative and "outward- ness" and objectivity to third-person narrative, for she is at pains to stress "the mutual dependence of realistic intent and imaginary psychology" (6). In her discussion of the handling of consciousness in third-person texts she establishes three narrative modali- ties: "psycho-narration," which she employs as a general term denoting the presence of a third-person narrator who is essentially concerned with the mediation of individual psychology; "quoted monologue," in which a character or characters are allowed to indulge in audible soliloquies; and "narrated monologue" (often known as either style indirect libre or erlebte Rede), a fictional mode which stands between psycho-narration and quoted monologue in that it maintains the syntactical mode of third-person dis- course while yet conveying what are manifestly not the narrator's but the characters' perceptions and responses. Professor Cohn has a number of acute points to make. Here, for example, is her marvellously sharp formulation of the implications of narrated monologue: "The continued employment of third-person reference indicates, no matter how unobtrusively, the continued presence of a narrator. And it is his identification-but not his identity- with the character's mentality that is supremely enhanced by this technique" (112). Moreover, she has telling observations to make about psycho-narration. Particularly suggestive, in my view, is her assertion that such a narrative mode is not less inward than the more overtly intimate techniques. Indeed, it gains precisely by not being bound to the (limited) linguistic arsenal of the soliloquizing mind: "not only can it order and explain a character's conscious thoughts better than the character himself, it can also effectively articulate a psychic life that remains unverbalized, penumbral, or obscure" (46). This is an important observation, one which draws attention to the virtues of a patterned transcription of the inner life of a character (and this patterning makes possible the metaphorical, indeed symbolic, articulation of the inchoate and indeterminate flux of sensation, perception, and feeling). The point, however, should be made that the presence of a third-person narrator is not the necessary source and only begetter of formal, metaphorical implication in a text. One could, for example, argue that a story such as Schnitzler's Leutnant Gustl makes, by virtue of its formal patterning, a set of intimations to which the narrating consciousness of the hapless</page><page sequence="2">NOVEL FALL 1980 Austrian lieutenant is largely impervious. But it is a salutary argument that Professor Cohn advances: there has been too much critical orthodoxy of late which postulates a simple sliding scale that makes first-person monologue coextensive and coterminal with psychological density and truth. In her discussion of first-person fictions, Pro- fessor Cohn ranges widely and suggests the whole spectrum of possible modes from the predominance of a knowing, recollecting, cognizant self (Proust) to the consonance of present narrative self with past experiencing self (Hamsun), from autobiographical narratives to memory monologues. The extent of her typology-and the variety of the texts covered-bears witness to the enduring importance and fascination of that narra- tive enterprise which seeks to enshrine the workings of human consciousness in narrative articulation. Essentially, Professor Cohn's study is formalistic and typological. But what prevents her work from becoming simply a ferociously tidy taxonomy is the frequency-and quality-of her textual illustration. Her book constantly delights with its wealth of particular insights. Moreover, on frequent occasions it opens up suggestive historical perspectives. For the narrative performances which she systematizes emerge through the historical growth and change of literary forms, and her theoretical approach proves anything but inimical to historical concerns. Moreover, her ability to illuminate the complexity of the theoretical issues often serves to differentiate some of the cruder schematisms that histories of the epic form have produced. It is, for example, worth remembering that the constantly expressed demand for "objectivity" which characterizes the debate about literary (and particularly narrative) realism in the last half of the nineteenth century helps to hasten the demise of the self-assertive, vociferously evalua- tive narrator. And his place is taken by the consciousness of the characters: it is their perception, their response, which we hear. In a strange way, then, the demand for "objectivity" produces a gain in the narrative transcription of a particular kind of subjectivity. Moreover, at the level of stylistic effect, strange consequences can result from seeming objectivity. The relentlessly matter-of-fact "reportage" style advocated by some Naturalist writers often produces a kind of terse patois (largely devoid of syntactical ordering) in which things are simply registered. And yet, when we read such texts, the effect, curiously, is not always one of reportage of the "police dossier" kind: rather, it can be that of a mood-picture. Lack of syntax, it would seem, can work either way: it can either sound naturalistic or impressionistic. Which is historically perhaps not altogether surprising. As a more recent example of this sort of uncertainty one could mention Robbe-Grillet's La Jalousie. As Professor Cohn herself points out (206), this is a text which has been hailed as both ruthlessly objective and as subjective to the point of obsession. All of which, of course, suggests the complexity of stylistic (and particularly narrative) effects. There is no simple rule of thumb which tells us that third-person equals objective, first-person equals subjective. Professor Cohn is good at countermanding both theoretical and historical simplifica- tions. I like, for example, her suggestion that the historical change in narrative forms over the past 150 years or so has not been simply a relentless pilgrimage inward a la Novalis. She observes that the need to convey the inner life of the characters has been a recurrent preoccupation of narrative art, and one that has tended to re-assert itself 76</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS NARRATIVE VOICES whenever the novel threatened to become, as it were, mindless, "whenever," to quote Professor Cohn, "its characters get hyper-active, its world too cluttered, its orientation too veristic" (9). On the other hand, Professor Cohn astutely suggests the many ways in which our sensibilities as readers change under pressure from experimentation within creative writing. If the autonomous monologue is a comparatively recent innova- tion in narrative literature, it was the measure of its newness that it seemed to be not quite a narrative form-precisely because the (realistic, psychological) context within which the particular act of writing occurred was left out of account. And yet, as Pro- fessor Cohn cogently observes (180), this is a convention to which the modern reader has grown so accustomed that he no longer regards it as strange or quirky. I said earlier that, while this study has suggestive pointers to offer in respect of literary history, it is primarily formalistic in its concerns. To English ears this may well sound balefully continental. Certainly, Professor Cohn's approach is akin to that of Todorov and Genette in the sense that it identifies narrative technique in terms of predominantly linguistic signals (tense, person, grammatical and syntactical forms, etc.). There is, I think, a great gain to this enterprise, and it is a gain that becomes particularly apparent in the discussion of third-person fictions. We tend nowadays to talk happily of the "narrator"-even when he is, in Professor Cohn's phrase, a "clairvoyant, disincarnated" presence. In a sense, this kind of narrator is, by definition, much less of a figure, a character, than is the first-person narrator who manifestly is, for example, one Serenus Zeitblom and not (as in Mann's Der Erwiihlte) the "spirit of the tale." Anglo-Saxon criticism has tended to invoke the narrator as a character-when he is, if anything, a metaphorical persona extrapolated from a linguistic mode. Professor Cohn's approach allows her to discuss third-person narratives in terms of a voice, of a set of intimations made-without succumbing to a kind of unwarranted anthropomorphism. The virtues of this analytical enterprise are manifold. In the first place, it means that the critic does not get bogged down in problems of cognitive consistency. If the narrator is a person, the maker of the text before us, then presumably he is responsible not only for the mode of his utterances, but also for the structure of the text, its pattern, symbolism, its chapter headings, title, its generic implications and overall design. All of which makes it difficult to keep narratorial and authorial presences distinct. But if narrative has more to do with mode than with person, it follows that we do not need to agonize over problems of psychological consistency and realism in respect of the narrator- because the narrator is first and foremost a voice, a presence, and not a knowable character. One suspects that this is truer to the imaginative volatility of the narrative act than is the personalizing of the third-person voice. (And even first-person voices can entail very odd persons behind them: I well remember in school having to write the autobiography of a penny or a dog-without feeling that I had to invoke the realistic psychological principle that says that pennies-or dogs-don't have auto- biographies.) The kind of approach which Professor Cohn adopts is appropriate to the extraordinary complexity of even humble, colloquial narrative acts (five minutes spent with a gifted raconteur will be enough to convince one of this everyday complexity). And yet occasionally one feels that Professor Cohn's analyses stay just to one (linguistic, theoretical) side of conveying the feeling of how a text works upon us. For 77</page><page sequence="4">NOVELIFALL 1980 if there is an inherent liveliness to the act of narration, it is a liveliness whose linguistic forms somehow coalesce with the value-heavy-morally and psychologically value-heavy -presence of a person talking. It may, of course, only be a notional person (talking to a notional reader), but that collusion is not simply an aesthetic game, for it is permeated by a whole spectrum of values, implications, expectations. All of which is perhaps only to say that the import of a text is inseparable from that hermeneutic enterprise which fills it out with a density of implied life and responses. On occasion Professor Cohn says less about this than I would like: when, for example, she notes (170) that Kafka could easily change his manuscript of The Castle from first-person to third-person, from "I" to "he" (even if it is only the very attenuated "he" who goes under the name of "K"), she does not go on to make the point that the very presence of a third-person narrator arouses certain reader expectations-at the very least that there might be a dis- crepancy, cognitively, between protagonist and narrator. That there is no such gain in overview in the narrator's perspective accounts both for the claustrophobia generated so powerfully by the text-and for the ever-present expectation of meaning. (The Castle is unlike a detective story in that it continues to play havoc with us even on a second reading when we already know the outcome.) Professor Cohn may have less to tell us about such responses: but that she has helped us to define more sharply the narrative means whereby such responses are engendered is not the least of the merits of her stimulating book.

Having recently reviewed two books about Trollope, I find on my desk four more, and there are at least two more already in print. Trollope is in the academic air. Perhaps the explanation is that he is a writer for times of crisis, as he was during the First World War. Yet critical as we may feel these times to be, we are not, at least, at war, and for this resurgence there have been no critical signals, like Leavis's The Great Tradition, which in its 78</page></plain_text>
