<plain_text><page sequence="1">The role of the guide in the improvisa- tional tour is a difficult one. It is impor- tant to emphasize that each guide must be thoroughly schooled on an adult level concerning the works of art in the mu- seum, as well as being rigorously trained to improvisational techniques to work suc- cessfully with this method. A guide must be alert to the reactions of her group. As she moves with them through the mu- seum, she must respond to their interest in whatever painting or sculpture they en- counter, although she may not have planned to investigate these objects with that particular group. If necessary, she will invent a game on the spot to heighten the involvement and perception of the group. Relaxed spontaneity based on the guides' thorough knowledge of the museum is the keynote. The guide must cultivate the judge- ment, insight, and timing which will tell her when a group or child is non-partici- patory and when non-verbally participat- ing. If the group does not respond, she must quickly devise a new means of inter- esting them, or immediately go on to something else. If a child does not partici- pate, she may try to involve him as an ob- server, but never does she put a child on the spot. The guides must re-orient their think- ing and their way of talking so that they do not tell the children, but instead bring forth the children's own imagination and Howard Thomas Howard Thomas, art professor emeritus at University of Georgia and former head of art departments at University of Wis- consin in Milwaukee and Agnes Scott Col- lege, died November 1 at Carrboro, North Carolina. He is survived by his wife, Anne Wall Thomas. Thomas was past president of the Wis- consin Painters and Scultpors, the Associ- tion of Georgia Artists, and the Southeast- ern College Art Association. He was guest lecturer for the Association of American Colleges and a lecturer under the U.S. Et in Arcadia ego After Nicholas Poussin I, Death, even I, have left my mark here. To be sure, It's subtle. I don't go about Putting myself forward without necessity. You, like my shepherd visitors, must stum- ble Upon me-and be surprised in an instant. See, they trace with their fingers to read The message of the tomb. It's difficult, Of course, to understand: one of their number, Laurel-crowned, a maker of ditties and oaten odes knowledge, intuitive or otherwise. For ex- ample, in playing the game promenade at Lincoln's ball, a guide must be careful to elicit from the children their responses to "what was it like?" If she says, "You girls have on long dresses with full skirts and tiny waists. Show me how you feel in them," she will already have stifled a part of the children's imagined scene. She must allow the children to tell her, and them- selves, by discovering for themselves. The games used must be open-ended so that the children can respond freely within them and explore many possibili- ties. At the same time, the guide must be in control of the group, and set up a con- trolled framework for its activity. Perhaps most difficult, the guides must have all the factual and philosophical information about a work of art in their minds, yet they must not impart it verbally unless a question posed by a child requires an an- swer from that fund of knowledge. Once introduced, the success of the im- provisational tour was immediate. By word of mouth only, it was booked each day of the school year during its first year. (The method was developed for use with children in the first through fifth grades, but has been used with success at the re- quest of teachers of both younger and considerably older high school and uni- versity students.) Everyone involved with the new tour, guides, teachers, parents and most of all the children, who wrote State Department cultural ambassador program in Turkey, India, Java, Bali, Ja- pan and Hong Kong. A native of Mount Pleasant, Ohio, Thomas was graduated from Chicago Art Institute and attended Ohio State Univer- sity, University of Southern California and University of Chicago. He was director of the division of art education at the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, from 1931 to 1942; acting head, department of art, Women's College of the University of North Carolina in 1942-43; head of Agnes No doubt, knows already, and turns and sinks Beneath the knowledge.

But, I, An anthropomorphic deity, am amused at how The rapture of the moment disarrays her dress, Baring one breast, and how, in her in- stinct For sudden flight, she readys thigh and leg marvelous letters of thanks to the mu- seum, felt it to be a valid and important innovation. But until 1970, there was no other proof of its validity. Implicit to the entire concept of the im- provisational tour is the notion that it is important to have confidence in one's own ability to perceive a work of art, to receive it, and to enjoy the process of do- ing so. Equally important is the realiza- tion that paintings and sculpture are made of formal relationships of colors, lines and spaces. (Easy to say but difficult to comprehend at a young age through verbal explanations.) Throughout the tour the physical exploration of these con- cepts make them comprehensible. Chil- dren can learn from and be conditioned by the intensity of this experience and the enjoyment they have in regard to looking. The factual, intellectualized elements of any work of art are something that chil- dren will be far more receptive to after having been introduced through these games to the concept that the object it- self, apart from the facts surrounding it, is a thing to be enjoyed. How much easier it is after all, to teach a child to swim when he has learned to enjoy the water. So, through the process of the tour the work of art becomes an object to enjoy and the museum a place in which one can enjoy oneself.

Sometimes I think That in this sublunary frame, flesh, all of it, Flesh and verdure fall far short Of my scythe-swinging gullet's ambition. Is it not reasonable then for me to leave traces, For I am everywhere, everywhere, every- where. -JAN MICHAEL DYROFF 275</page></plain_text>
