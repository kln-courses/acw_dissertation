<plain_text><page sequence="1">EXHIBITION REVIEW ARTS OF THE SOUTH SEAS1 GREGORY BATESON Some years ago, in one of the big villages of the Sepik River headhunters, I was negotiating to buy a specially fine pair of secret flutes - highly decorated bamboo tubes, about 6 feet long and giving deep organ notes. The members of the clan which owned the flutes had two objections to the sale: "If you take these flutes away to your country women may see them," and "The flutes will never make music again. Who will know how to play them? " On the subj ect of women, I assured them - "No New Guinea women shall see the flutes and any women in my country who may see them will not know what they are." To the other objection my only reply was to take some lessons in flute playing. There are then two critical questions which one may ask of any exhibit of exotic art: First, are the objects so displayed that the spectator may know what they are, and second, can the spectator get some feeling for the emotion which the makers buried in these objects which have somehow found their way to an alien land? Looking at the "Arts of the South Seas," I have to confess that the spectator can usually only make a dim guess at the nature and uses of the things displayed. The answer to the first question must be a regretful negative. This is not mainly the fault of the Museum nor of Rene d'Harnoncourt who se- lected the specimens from the various collections in this country and planned the display. The sad truth is that a large proportion of the objects shown were collected with no information as to their use; many were collected before the days of critical an- thropology; very few of the cultures from which the objects come have been systematically studied; and many of these cul- tures are now dead or dying. Any exhibit of South Sea art must therefore be built up of items of which a majority will have imperfect labels. To the second question, however, the answer is certainly an affirmative. The flutes and drums may be dumb for lack of any person who can play them, but still the objects are so lighted and arranged that they carry with them something of the at- mosphere of the places from which they come, something of the emotions which underlay the various cultural conventions which governed their making. I believe that if my Sepik River men could see the many objects which their tribe has contrib- uted to the exhibit they would be proud. It would please them, of course, to see that they are more highly honored than their less artistic neighbors, but more than this I think that they might recognize themselves and say, "Yes. Ourselves indeed! We are a war-like people, full of fight and lust." The exhibit, however, demands evaluation on many different levels. It is, itself, a work of art and must be judged as such. Disregarding questions about what new knowledge the specta- tor may acquire on his way through the rooms, we must ask first what sort of whole aesthetic experience is the spectator offered? Only after this can we go on to a more analytic approach asking what if anything the exhibit says. Indeed the first question in this later analytic approach will have to be "Is the whole aes- thetic experience one which is appropriate to what the exhibit is trying to say?" The writer and in general those who have seen the exhibit agree on two expressions of emotion: "It makes sense," and "It is very exciting." Therefore to evaluate the exhibit as a work of art, we will try to define more precisely this excitement and the sort of coherence which is implicit in the sequence and lighting of the various objects. And to do this, we must look for what in ourselves is touched off by this arrangement of alien items in an occidental syntax. For only the arrangement is occi- dental - the objects themselves are foreign. Considered as a total experience, the exhibit has a definite artistic form, a structure of climax which is probably the clue to its success. The spectator enters first a well-lit room contain- ing Australian objects - boomerangs beautifully poised on a wire support, a few spear throwers, and a series of North Queensland drawings in ocher on bark, a fish, a stork, a kangaroo, all alike in that the artist has represented the animal's viscera as though its body were transparent. Beyond this, the room con- tains no overt libidinal references unless we include an enor- mous ground painting of unknown meaning. This last would presumably be normally seen flat on the ground but in the ex- hibit the design sprawls up the wall, cocked up at an angle of thirty degrees. Two shields with somewhat un-Australian (possibly "Pap- uan") abstract patterns provide a transition out of Australia into New Caledonia and the New Hebrides - out of full light into a murk of violent but stylized phallicism. The spectator is confronted with great-eyed figures carved out of the trunks of standing tree ferns, the standing slit-gongs of the New Hebrides and a row of heads, bright red and lit from below. (These heads, by the way, are the only instance in which the exhibitor has allowed his dramatic sense to overstep the strict rules of scien- tific decorum. They are the only objects which suffer individ- ually from the lighting so that you cannot really examine them - and no doubt the average spectator sees in them the stinking trophies of war. They are - as the label honestly admits - just the heads of the domestic dead, decorated as keepsakes.) From the New Hebrides, the spectator passes on - in the same dim light but now without the dramatic spotlights which were used to accent the tree-fern figures and the row of heads - to the cultures of the Fly and Sepik River regions of New Guinea. These are introduced by a fine spread of gopi boards from the ceremonial houses of the Papuan Gulf area. These semi-abstract, semi-anthropomorphic representations of ances- tors are set out on a bamboo framework representing the parti- tions inside the ceremonial house on which originally these ob- jects hung in their native land. The Fly-Sepik area is handled as a single unit in a large space. An irregular, curved area in the middle of this space is filled with the major objects from the Sepik River (possibly the shape is symbolic of the curving river), while objects from the neighboring cultures from which the Sepik people derived their artistic themes are set out on the surrounding walls. This is a region of what, for lack of a better term, we may call assertive art. Its basic theme is a sort of immanent totemism. The crocodiles, weevils, and ancestors with noble noses are the people who made them and the people who admired them. The great eagle figures from the gable-tops of the Sepik ceremonial I. This exhibit opened at the Museum of Modern Art, New York, on January z29, 1946, and closed on May 19, 1946. Arrangements have been made to show most of the specimens in the Worcester Art Museum in October and November, and the exhibit will probably go to other cities after this. The exhibit was directed by Ren6 d'Harnoncourt, Director of the Museum's Department of Manual Industry, in collaboration with Dr. Ralph Linton and Dr. Paul S. Wingert. The Museum recently published a book of the same title with text by Linton and Wingert and 2oo00 illus- trations.</page><page sequence="2">120 THE ART BULLETIN houses represent the fighting force of the village, and the people will state this even more clearly than Americans can tell you for what their own eagle stands. They will say that the bird is "Our warfare. Our anger." And in the ceremony when this eagle is set up on the gable-top, the bird speaks. He looks out over the enemy country and sees the women there as "birds preening themselves" and the men as "fish jumping in the water" - ready to be killed. In every village you will find the living embodiments of the ancient mythology - the man who bears the name which was once borne by the founder of the village. He will straighten his shoulders as he tells you "I steered the canoe which brought my clan to this place." And another man will stamp on the ground as he says "I am Kevembuangga. I put my foot on the mud and made it hard so that people could live. But for me there would be no people. There would be no pigs." This positive assertion, which equates the self with a tradi- tional ego ideal, is the basis of the art of this area. Every one of the items in the exhibit had once its ancestral personal name referring back to mythology but also borne by somebody living in the village. One other aspect of this art must be mentioned. The objects are (with one or two exceptions) associated with the great men's ceremonial houses which are characteristic of the area. The rather dim illumination of the room, devoid of spotlights, is a correct portrayal of the light in or under such a building. This interior of the ceremonial house is, in the native language re- ferred to as its "belly" and the ceremonial house is itself female. Each such house is a female ancestor whose gigantic face ap- pears on the gable front and whose name is given to the build- ing as a whole. The masculine assertive art thus has its locus within a grandiose female matrix. It is this proud art which d'Harnoncourt has chosen to put immediately after the phallicism of the New Hebrides. There is no reason to believe that he knew consciously what part this art played in the life of the tribe and no label will help the spectator to verbalize this aspect of the matter for himself. But still there is an appropriateness in the sequence from phallicism to virile pride, and in describing the aesthetic experience offered to the spectator we may assume that this juxtaposition of themes plays an important part. The man who listens to the successive movements of a symphony may be utterly unable to define the emotional content of these themes, still less to say in words how it happens that a given theme may gain special value specifi- cally from its position in the sequence. It is, however, this order of artistic appropriateness which makes for greatness. D'Harnon- court, whether or not he knew articulately what he was doing at each step, has shown quite extraordinary sensitivity to his material. Each actual object is given its full value as an asser- tive virile statement and the assertiveness of the region is given full value by its position in the major sequence of cultures. From the Sepik region, the spectator emerges into a clearer light and is confronted with a series of Baining and Sulka masks from the east end of New Britain. Of these the pink-dyed Sulka specimens, the "old man" with great umbrella headdress and the two smaller running masks which accompany him have a sinister coldness which is appropriate after the ethos of the Sepik. The Baining masks represent supernaturals who come in from the forest to dance around the bonfire bearing packages of smoke-dried meat, live carpet snakes, and other foods which are presented to the women. Their great lips and the four-foot bam- boo trumpet which is built into one of the masks seem hardly to have a place in the emotional sequence. Perhaps d'Harnoncourt was constrained to put them here because they come from the same geographical region as their Sulka enemies - or perhaps he had some intuitive sense that that great trumpet could emit only the most ineffective snort. The remainder of the New Britain room is dominated by a very extraordinary wooden mask said to come from the center of the island. This is one of the most striking objects in the whole exhibit, very simple in its strength and solidity, and totally unexpected from this part of the world. Nothing at all is known about this mask. There is a bare statement by coastal natives who say that they brought it down from the interior but, as to what it represents or what sort of people made it, we are left entirely in the dark. Aesthetically, here in the exhibit, it seems to prefigure the classicism of parts of Polynesia. (In pass- ing we should note, however, that the mask as it stands may give us a misleading impression about the people who made it. It has traces of paint and must surely have been brightly colored when new. It has pegs for the attachment of hair and a beard, which were made probably of some vegetable fiber of which no other trace remains. Seeing it as we do without color and without hair we are as liable to error as when we attribute a certain coolness to Greek marbles which also have lost their paint.) From New Britain, the spectator goes on to a room full of the malanggan carvings of New Ireland - openwork structures in soft wood, brightly painted, heavily decorated - multiple combinations of many-eyed heroes and animals and fishes. This phantasmagoria is set up as the end of the New Guinea sequences and significantly the last of these elaborate figures holds a set of Pan pipes to his lips with one hand, while with the other he points, not forward into the next room, but back- wards toward New Guinea and the New Hebrides. At this point, there is a break as sharp as that between Australia and New Guinea. Already while looking at the New Ireland carvings, the spectator has come back to a normal intensity of light, muted by darkening the walls. But when he passes through into the Solomons and the Admiralty Islands, he steps into the brilliant lighting of island beaches - a light which in the Polynesian room becomes almost painful in its sharpness. This shift in the intensity of light goes with a total shift in the ethos of the art, from bold blunt anthropomorphic forms to fine sharp profiles and sharp crescentic motifs of decoration. The actual material from the Solomons and Admiralties is not of very high caliber - the American collections lacking the best of Solomon Islands work and the Admiralties being an ar- tistically dull region. The spectator's attention is caught, how- ever, by a big wooden bowl which is, at any rate, a fine piece of craftsmanship and by two large, red human figures, side by side, male and female, from the Admiralties. These are a clear at- tempt at realism, at representing people as they really are, not as fantasy might state them, and recall much that is regrettable in our own art styles. They come, indeed, from a culture domi- nated by commercial and financial themes and denote a techni- cal failure of objectivity rather than an attempt at art. Looking ahead from the Solomons and Admiralties, the spec- tator sees these styles of craftsmanship fully developed in Mi- cronesia with frigate bird designs, with their tapering crescentic forms sharply silhouetted against the dazzling walls. From Mi- cronesia, the spectator passes on into Polynesia and classical craftsmanship rather than romantic fantasy. One feels that peo- ple were pleasant, sane, and easy in their emotional responses. Strong and good, clear-eyed and open in their sexual dealings - but perhaps not very interesting. The world in which the spec- tator now finds himself is bright and swept clean after the dreams and fantasies of New Guinea. The sea has cleaned the coral sand and people go brightly about the business of fishing and cooking and the nicely defined etiquette of formal chief- tainship. With the Maori, however, there is a reversion to a more gro- tesque theme. The tiki, those goggle-eyed, crooked-headed jade figures which are so much prized by collectors, are, after all, not only fertility charms but also the powerful and dreaded spirits of infants still-born. And this ghoulish quality is reflected, too, in the Maori carvings - their elaborate doors with rich spiral designs and tangled, almost abstract, corruptions of the human face and body.</page><page sequence="3">EXHIBITION REVIEW 121 From Maori, the spectator passes on to the material from Easter Island - a full-sized photograph of one of the great stone statues, several of the well-known wooden figures of aged and emaciated men and two extraordinary and evil dolls made of bark cloth. These two dolls, which look like crawling, senes- cent embryos, are set up by themselves in an unlit box and are the final item of the exhibit. The above linear description of the exhibit is incomplete in one respect. D'Harnoncourt in planning the exhibit has also dealt successfully with one problem which is the bane of every curator's life. In any exhibit, it is necessary to put together those objects which come from the same place because, together, the objects give to the spectator a more complete picture of that particular culture. On, the other hand, there is the well-known fact that these cultures are not historically separate. The peoples have wandered and carried their artistic themes with them; they have traded their decorated objects and even their craftsmen and their artistic styles. As a result, the cultures of the South Seas are not separate but fall into three (or possibly four) great thematic families - the Australian, the Polynesian, the Papuan and the Melanesian - differing in their whole handling of the human head and in the types of art which they produce. Even among these great groups there has been much borrowing and interchange of themes, and within each group the relationships have become almost infinitely complex. Anthropologists have devoted a great deal of rather fruitless speculation to unravel- ling these historical relationships and, as a result, every exhibitor faces the problem of how to demonstrate this interrelationship without mixing up the specimens from different cultures. D'Harnoncourt has solved this problem by the use of vistas. The Museum of Modern Art is so constructed that a majority of the internal walls are moveable and can be set up in what- ever pattern may be appropriate to each temporary exhibit. D'Harnoncourt has taken full advantage of this peculiarity of the building to permit the spectator as he advances to see from POLYNESIAN TAPA M MICRONESIA HAWAII) MAORI Ck /COOK133 2s MARQ SASS SIV ugMAR UESAS ORRS MSSI NEW HEBRDES Lir Pt ADMIRALTIES N NEW IRELAND AUSTRA IA G1 ULF FIG. I. Museum of Modern Art: Plan of South Seas Exhibition many points through into other parts of the exhibit. Thus, when he is in front of the objects from the Massim area he can look forward into another room in which are displayed the supposedly related objects from the Solomons and Admiralties. (Fig. I, plan on which the vistas are indicated by arrows.) This device is a real contribution to the techniques of exposition and might be used for a variety of purposes. In the present exhibit, the device is important, not mainly because it conveys histori- cal information but because it has aesthetic value. The spectator is given a sense of the unity, not only of the South Seas, but also of this particular exhibit. As in a symphony, which consists es- sentially of a single temporal sequence of sounds, unity is achieved by earlier prefiguring of themes which will be picked up and developed in some later movement, so in this exhibit the spectator is allowed to see ahead something of what he will later experience. It is this unity which causes the spectator to say "it makes sense." In sum, what d'Harnoncourt has done is to set a series of human cultures in a certain order, that order being sym- bolically determined by the basic human reproductive cycle. The Australian room is clearly only introductory to this se- quence - an introduction that shakes the spectator into bodily awareness. From this point onwards to the end of the exhibit, the sequence is coherent, through phallicism to virility and thence through a period of crystalline clarity undistorted by sexual fantasy to a final statement of grotesque birth. Such a sequence naturally "makes sense." The spectator participates here, as in any other work of art, in a climax form which has spatial and temporal unity, and which owes its value to rhythms inherent in the human body. If the spectator is merely there to enjoy an aesthetic experience, d'Harnoncourt has succeeded as an artist in providing what was demanded, and perhaps no more should be demanded of a museum devoted to the arts. It is possible, however, that more has really been given. Writ- ing as a scientist, I would say that, consciously or unconsciously, d'Harnoncourt has proposed a hypothesis about the psychologi- cal place of artistic emphases and conventions in human life. Strictly and puritanically (and scientists are a puritanical breed) I would insist that however aesthetically pleasing the exhibit may be, the arrangement is not scientifically legitimate unless the art styles of these various peoples have a real subconscious reference to the physiological epochs in d'Harnoncourt's se- quence. The arrangement, in fact, proposes some hypothesis of this sort. We are all familiar today with the general notion that art all over the world is replete with subconscious and especially sexual themes, and much has been written comparing "primitive" art with those modern movements in occidental art which have articulately and consciously stressed these physiological and semiconscious aspects of human life. But the hypothesis which we are here considering is much more sophisticated and much more discriminating than such blanket generalizations. We are not discussing a general proposition which would equate the "primitive" with the "subconscious," the "sexual" or the "modern." Any such hypothesis would, in fact, be ruled out of court immediately by modern anthropological knowledge. We know that the subconscious themes expressed in art are pro- foundly different from one culture to the next, and anthro- pologists are no longer interested in blanket statements about resemblances. Rather, the emphasis today is upon defining the differences between cultures and upon relating these differences to systematic conditions in the life of the various peoples. It is just such a discriminating hypothesis that is implicit in d'Harnoncourt's exhibit. His exhibit offers us a classification of some of the art styles of the South Seas which suggests that these styles can be related severally to different phases of the human reproductive cycle. Such a hypothesis would not be out of line with modern anthropological thinking. In our attempts to define cultural ethos, we are compelled to classify and map what Wil- liam Blake would have called "Contrary States of the Human Soul" and in these attempted classifications we have sought for vocabulary in various fields of knowledge, using such terms as "paranoid" or "Apollonian" in new senses. Such classifications of ethos are never mutually contradictory2 and there is no reason 2. This of course is true only of those classifications which do not de- pend upon any aetiological hypothesis, as is the case when anthropologists have borrowed typologies from psychology and psychiatry. In other in- stances, where the description or classification of ethos depends upon Freudian and other hypotheses about the processes of character formation,</page><page sequence="4">122 THE ART BULLETIN why another such classification based upon the reproductive cycle should not be as tenable as those which we already have. We scarcely have the data to test this classification at the pres- ent time, nor would the present article be an appropriate place for an exhaustive discussion of its validity. It can be said, how- ever, that the positions assigned to Polynesia and to the Sepik seem to be appropriate. The Middle Sepik is an area in which male potency is very highly valued. The adult male character is built upon strong prohibitions of passivity and is indeed an over-de- veloped compensatory reaction to latent passivity induced by early female identification. There is however among these men very little fear of impotence, and it is therefore understand- able that the art of this area emphasizes male sureness rather than any search for sexual stimulation. In contrast to this, the cul- tures of Polynesia, especially Samoa, are remarkably free from any overemphasis on specifically sexual themes. Sexual appetite is readily and simply satisfied, and therefore it is understandable that the art of this area is relatively unconcerned with these themes. As to the Maori and the people of Easter Island, it is diffi- cult to judge of their preoccupation with birth and miscarriage, and quite impossible in the present state of our knowledge to relate this to other aspects of their life. About Easter Island nothing at all is known and the Maori have never been examined from this point of view. It is necessary to mention, also, that this preoccupation with miscarriage recurs in other parts of Poly- nesia, e.g., in the post-mortem Caesarean operations which, in Samoa, must be performed on any woman who dies in preg- nancy. Similarly, in regard to the New Hebrides, we simply do not know as yet what particular sort of phallicism is charac- teristic of any of the cultures of that region. Let us therefore assume that the hypothesis implicit in the exhibit is sufficiently tenable to be of great interest and go on to consider what this may mean for future work in the sciences of anthropology and art criticism. A novel experiment has been performed. A man with very highly developed sensitivity to artistic values has been confronted with an enormous mass of artistic products from thirty or forty different cultures. In the course of his search for the items which were finally brought together in the exhibit, d'Harnoncourt must have seen several thousand specimens, some of them in glass cases, set up to demon- strate some truth usually irrelevant to d'Harnoncourt's interests, others stripped of all meaning and covered with dust where they lay in museum storerooms. From this rich but confused experi- ence, he has sought out order of a special kind. He states that he decided to ignore the anthropological literature and to trust rather to his own artistic sensibilities, experimenting at each stage to determine the lighting appropriate for each object. And in this he was wise. He had some anthropological help but we may doubt whether any anthropologist could have answered the questions with which d'Harnoncourt was specially concerned. It is probable that he could scarcely have put these questions into words and I know for a fact that he had reached a correct deci- sion as to the lighting of the Sepik River material before he knew about the peculiar lighting of the Sepik ceremonial houses. He had reached a correct decision but had rationalized it by saying that the Sepik River was somehow intermediate between the lighting of the rain forests of the New Hebrides and the coral beaches of Polynesia; and that perhaps the objects were made for showing in clearings in the forest. But, whatever the rationalization, his decision, based on artistic perceptions, was correct. For the future, this means that a new field for collaborative work has become available. It is evidently important to bring together anthropological knowledge and artistic sensitivity. Such work may always require two persons, each with his special skill, and always there will be pitfalls. The artist may try to verbalize his conclusions in totally erroneous phrasings of why some ar- rangement seems to him to be artistically appropriate, and the anthropologist will probably err in trying to push the conclu- sions toward too sharp a precision. But there is real hope that collaboration along these lines might lead to some advance in our understanding of the tangled emotional themes expressed in man's diverse artistic conventions. AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY there is better hope of finding mutually contradictory hypotheses which can be proved or disproved. The whole of Freudian theory is, however, so flexible that it is exceedingly difficult in practice to suggest any conceiv- able fact which would disprove any part of the theory. For a survey and brief bibliography of the various approaches to the problem of defining ethos, see G. Bateson, "Cultural Determinants of Personality," Per- sonality and the Behavior Disorders, edited by J. McV. Hunt, Chapter 23, New York, Ronald Press, 1944, pp. 714-735. Postscript: It is difficult to validate any analysis of a completed work of art and this is especially true when the analyst is con- cerned with themes of which the artist was perhaps only partly conscious. Indeed, in such a case, full proof or disproof could only be obtained by very careful psychoanalytic testing, which was out of the question in the present instance. The whole question of the nature of the creative process and the validity of post facto critical interpretation is, however, of very great interest. I therefore showed the above article, in manuscript, to d'Harnoncourt, in order to obtain his comments on it. While reading the manuscript and after completing it, he made the following comments in the order given: I. He agreed that the New Hebrides heads could not be exam- ined as individual objects but justified this by saying that he did not feel that these heads had sufficient artistic merit to be shown individually. He did, however, want at this point in the exhibit the particular type of aesthetic effect which these heads gave when shown en masse in conjunction with the figures. 2. About the transition from the phallicism of the New Heb- rides to the virility of the Sepik, he said that this was "not planned" but that it "sounds probable." 3. About the position of the Baining and Sulka masks, he said that he had been conscious of a difficulty in placing these in the sequence and had put them where they are partly for geographic reasons. "It is almost impossible to handle the smaller geographic subdivisions without becoming confusing. Therefore I put them on a platform to make them stick out as a separate experience. . . . I planned at one stage to put them in a separate recess but this would have made the whole show too staccato." 4. About the two figures from the Admiralty Islands, d'Harnon- court insisted that these had real artistic merit in his eyes, and I agreed that my distaste for them might be personal. 5. About the anthropological literature, he said that actually he had not avoided it because of any distrust but rather because the literature is in fact so spotty, because so few cultures have been sufficiently worked on, and because he had so little time to prepare the exhibit. In this connection, he added that he did obtain a great deal of anthropological information from Linton and Wingert who collaborated with him. 6. When he had finished reading the manuscript, he said at first that he did not feel competent to judge of the importance of the reproductive sequence. He agreed that it might well be there but "perhaps it is not as important as you make out. There was also a whole complex of other aesthetic concep- tions. For example, in the New Hebrides, I was most im- pressed with the fact that those great images are made for</page><page sequence="5">EXHIBITION REVIEW 123 only one spectacular performance. This is in marked con- trast to the permanence of the things from the Sepik." 7. Returning again to the question of the reproductive sequence, he said that he would have stated it "in less concrete terms" if at all. 8. He questioned my use of the term "phallicism" as applied to the New Hebrides material and suggested that the term "explosive" would have been better, that the material per- haps suggests a single violent erotic act. (I agree with him that this phrasing would have been better.) 9. For the Polynesian material he suggested that it was rather a matter of the "replacement of sexual expressions by other things. The sex is satisfied and therefore you don't talk about it." In sum, it appears from the above comments that d'Harnon- court was almost unconscious of the reproductive unity of his exhibit when he planned it. When this aspect is suggested to him, however, he at first recognizes that it may be a valid analy- sis and then goes on, as he becomes more familiar with the idea, to give it a greater precision than I was able to do.
