<plain_text><page sequence="1">EXCAVATIONS AT QATAL HUYOK, 1963 THIRD PRELIMINARY REPORT By JAMES MELLAART THE THIRD SEASON of excavations at Qatal Hiiytik lasted from Ioth June until 3oth August, 1963, seventy working days with an average of thirty-five men, some local but most from the Beycesultan area, under our foreman, Veli Karaaslan, and our trusted ustas, Rifat Qelimli, Mustafa Duman, and Bekir Kalayci. The 1963 season received financial support from the Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research, New York, the Bollingen Foundation, New York, the Munroe Fund of the University of Edinburgh, The British Academy, the Royal Ontario Museum, Canada, the Australian Institute of Archaeology, the Institute of Archaeology of the University of London, an anonymous donation, and Unilever, Istanbul, and transport and survey equipment from BP Aegean, Ltd., Istanbul. Once again we are indebted to the Turkish Department of Antiquities and its Director; to the Vali of Konya, Bay Rebii Karatekin; the Kaymakam of Qumra; the Director of the Konya Museums, Bay Mehmet Onder, and numerous other dignitaries in Konya and Qumra who contributed to the success of the expedition. The expedition staff consisted of Mrs. Mellaart, administrator and photo- grapher; Miss Grace Huxtable, artist; Miss Diana Kirkbride; Miss Pat Quin, architect; Miss Fiona Greig, Mrs. D. Biernoff, and Miss Viola Pemberton-Piggott, conservators; Messrs. Ian Todd, David Biernoff, J. Yakar, M. Davie, field assistants; and Bay Hayrettin Solmaz from the Konya Museum as representative of the Turkish Government. During and after the excavation we had the pleasure of a visit from the following specialists : Miss Nan Shaw (frescoes), Miss C. Weston (wood), Dr. J. Birman (glaciology); Dr. Dexter Perkins, Jr., who studied our animal bones; Dr. H. Helbaek, the palaeoethnobotanist, and Mr. H. Burnham, the textile expert, who studied our remains of cloth in the Ankara Museum. Among the many visitors to the excavations were H.E. The British Ambassador and Lady Allen and most of the staff of the British Embassy, who helped us in many ways; Professor and Mrs. Grahame Clark; Dr. and Mrs. Douglas Tushingham, of the Royal Ontario Museum, Canada, and Mr. and Mrs. J. Grimes, British Council Representative in the Lebanon. SUMMARY OF THE 1963 CAMPAIGN AT QATAL Ht yYK The four principal aims of the 1963 season were to investigate the architectural layout of building-level VI and link up the two areas (A and E) found the previous year; to investigate the curious burial habits and the transition from aceramic to ceramic neolithic, and finally to push back deep into the history of the mound. In the course of linking up the two main areas, courts were found between blocks of shrines and houses of Level VI A (Fig. I) and this plan was more or less followed in all later levels. Further down, however, in Levels VI B and VII, which were virtually aceramic, large courts are missing and the plan is extremely crowded (Figs. 2, I I). These lower levels had not been destroyed by fire but had been abandoned after a very long occupation. Walls leant at drunken angles, developed large cracks upon drying, and were a menace all round and it soon became clear that the possibility of sinking a sounding under such conditions was perilous and impracticable. At gatal Hiuytik there is no short cut to obtaining quick results and the only course of action is that of gradual stripping off layer after</page><page sequence="2">40 ANATOLIAN STUDIES layer. The lowest building-levels reached in I 963-on the edge of the mound-were a series of superimposed shrines in Levels VIII-X; and a test trench below the floor of Level X showed numerous strata continuing down to a depth of 15 feet below the present-day level of the plain. Virgin soil has not yet beer reached, but water started to seep in from the irrigation canal and the trench had to be abandoned on the last day of the dig (section, Fig. 3). ARCHITECTURE, WALL-PAINTINGS, AND RELIEFS Building-levels VIA and VI B During the excavations of I962 it became clear that two phases of building could be established for the houses which surrounded the five great shrines excavated in area E and belonging to building-level VI. The numerous replasterings and changes of decoration within many of the shrines supported the idea that they indeed had stood through more than one building level. The far more extensive excava- tions of 1963 have now confirmed that there were indeed two successive building- levels : an upper one, VI A, burnt and with pottery, and a lower one, VI B, burnt only over part of the area, and without pottery. As a result two different plans can now be drawn (Figs. 1-2) and a number of buildings, described as plain " Level VI " in our previous report, can now be assigned either to VI A or to VI B. The discovery of a VI B complex further affects the group of rooms at the western end of the mound, described as " Level VII " in I96I, and these actually belong to Level VI B. (See AS. XII, 1962, p. 49 f. and Fig. 6). Of the six shrines found last year and described in the previous report, five (A VI, I, and E VI, 8, 10, 7, and 14) had been built in Level VI B and they remained in use during Level VI A, at the end of which they were burnt. In all of these the original VI B floors were found and in several of them earlier forms of decoration could be established. The newly found " Leopard Shrine ", E VI, 44, conforms to the same pattern : built in VI B, it remained in use until the end of VI A, but the delapi- dated building E VI, 31, was found to have been built on an earlier shrine of Level VI B, which, though unburnt, was filled in to make room for a new building. In this it was not alone; a whole series of Level VI B shrines were given up in Level VI A (nos. E VI B 31, 29, 45, I, 12, and 15) but as far as we can see only three new ones (E VI A 31, 50, and 25) took their place. There may have been more, but denudation of numerous buildings on the west slope of the mound may have removed the evidence by which shrines are recognized, i.e. wall-paintings and especially reliefs, or the presence of cult-statues. When comparing the plan of Level VI A (Fig. I) with that of the earlier Level VI B (Fig. 2) one is struck by a significant feature: instead of an almost solidly built-up area with an occasional open space or courtyard (usually an earlier ruined house) there is a tendency in Level VI A towards a less compact plan with more space and air and larger courtyards which served as repositories of domestic rubbish and public conveniences. The wide open space, bottom left of the plan, is more apparent than real, for here the buildings gradually rose and those of Level VI A were removed by denudation. From the earlier plans it is clear that along the outer periphery of the mound the serried ranks of houses formed a solid wall, offering no means of entry into the settlement. As all communications took place over the flat roofs of the houses, by means of wooden ladders where necessary, the outer rows of houses, so far unbroken by an entry, took the place of defensive walls, and for the same reason it is clear that domestic animals were kept, not within the settlement, but probably in corrals on its edge.</page><page sequence="3">63 A 62 104SCOURIYARD 67 9 925 95 EALY.....

XII, 1962 (Fig. 5), and IV, ibid., and in Scientific American, April 1964 issue). On the other hand, building-level VII (Fig. i i) is remarkably similar in plan to VI B showing the same crowded arrangement, a few constricted open spaces, and the same arrangement of shrines surrounded by houses in a rough ratio of one shrine per four to five houses. During the process of linking up area E with area A a new group of shrines was discovered, one of which (E VI, 45) lay below the single shrine of Level IV discovered in 196 I and the other two on either side : the " Leopard Shrine " (E VI, 44) to the east and E VI A, 5o, to the west. The latter building was burnt in the general conflagration of Level VI A, but some interesting wall-paintings were preserved on its east wall (P1. Ib and Fig. 4). The main wall-painting covering the central panel between the two red-painted posts showed a textile pattern in red, white, and black on a cream ground. The triangular sections contain bulls' horns or crosses and at the bottom left there is a clear painting of a human hand. The border along the top changes colour several times in true textile fashion, and the painting gives one the impression of having been copied from a kilim. It also shows great similarity to a somewhat earlier kilim pattern from Shrine E VI B, I (Fig. I6), described in AS. XII, 1962, p. 59, Pls. Xb, XI. The decoration over the smaller platform in the corner is rather similar, but it lacks the shawl-like effect of the larger painting and the patterns used are different. Beyond the bench, which once again incorporated a pair of bull's horns, there was a painting in red of a goddess with raised arms and legs and a triangular head. In front of her lay three more bulls' horns on a small platform. Above the two textile paintings red-painted grooves emphasize the presence of a horizontal wooden beam in the structure of the wall. As the result of the fire the wall-paintings had suffered terribly and in Level V only the western part of the room was reused. The second shrine destroyed by fire in Level VI A is the " Leopard Shrine ", E VI, 44 (Fig. 5), but like many others it was originally built in Level VI B. Most of its north wall and its south-western corner were destroyed by deep Hellenistic pits sunk from the surface of the mound some Io feet above. The shaft and doorway to a storeroom in the north-west corner are preserved as well as the remains of a screen (foreground, Fig. 5) separating the cult room from the kitchen part of the building which contained two great ovens. The main panel on the north wall shows two leopards in relief, face to face (P1. IIa) between the vertical posts, painted red, or in an earlier phase decorated with geometric patterns in white, grey, and red (Fig. 5). Of the two leopards the left one is probably the female, the slender right one the male. Both have their tails raised. They were found covered with layers of white plaster which hid and preserved about forty successive layers of painting, though all very similar and (but for a few) not too well preserved. In the upper painted layers, the leopards were of a lemon yellow colour with black spots, black dashed outline, and each had a pink circle on the head, which was probably meant to represent the mouth. They had pink claws and a pink line round the end of the tail (P1. IIb). Further down they changed their spots into rosettes and not less than twenty successive layers with rosette decoration are known to exist. The rosettes are painted in black on a white background and the animals have bright red claws (P1. IIc). Occasional spots occur between the rosettes, and in some of the earliest layers the rosettes increase in size and some include dots within the petals of the rosettes.</page><page sequence="11">EXCAVATIONS AT QATAL HUYOK, 1963 43 2--..

The animal relief was set above a red panel (as usual) and this also was repainted numerous times. On the platform set in front of the Leopard panel, were found numerous offerings of grain and crucifer seeds as well as one fine statue (Fig. 26). Various others, to be described below, p. 75, lay in the centre of the room. In the angle between the screen and the edge of the platform lay a badly broken bull's head of plaster, incorporating fragments of actual horns and at one time painted a plain red. Also crushed on the edge were the remains of a " bull-pillar ", but no traces of its position could be found on the platform. The original place of the bull's head is likewise unknown: the opposite wall showed no scar of attachment, and from the position in which it lay it may rather be assumed that it had been fixed on to the screen. The south wall of the building showed no decoration whatsoever, but the wooden ladder leading to the roof was found in the customary position and part of the wood was held in situ by the thick layers of plaster on the wall. The leopard shrine got its light from an adjacent courtyard to the south. The third shrine in this complex, E VI B, 45, the " Boar's head Shrine ", was built at right-angles to the leopard shrine (Fig. 6), in Level VI B. Above it lay a burnt house of Level VI A, excavated in 1962, and above that lay the Level IV Shrine, cleared in our first season. Continuity of cult at Qatal Huiyiik is not as absolute as in Mesopotamia and houses sometimes occupy the places of shrines of earlier layers and vice versa. Although very ruined (the west wall had lost all its plaster and the south wall was cut by a Hellenistic pit) the building showed the familiar plan but with some unusual features. Entry was obtained through a low doorway from a long corridor with a bench along the entire north wall. This corridor must have had a ladder (or even a wooden staircase) leading to the roof. The main decoration of the room was the relief of a goddess (Pl. IIIa) flanked by red-painted posts, of which only the legs and the lower part of the body survive. It is set above a red-painted panel and the position of this relief corresponds to that of the leopards, the goddess's sacred animals in the shrine next door. The extremities of the legs (i.e. the position of the toes) are surrounded by a line of red paint like the feet and tails of the leopards. Two concentric red circles were also drawn round an animal head, of which only the scar remained, placed to the right of the vertical post on the east wall. Strangely enough there was only one post instead of the pair found in all other shrines and the decoration of the main panel on the east wall was also unusual. At some stage, probably towards the end, the plaster of the wall was cut away leaving the silhouette, roughly cut, of a huge boar's head, a symbol of death. This cut-out silhouette is closely similar to clay heads of figurines from the same building-level (P1. IIIb). We shall see that this technique of decoration is found quite often in building-level VII and earlier and one is unmistakably reminded of the engraving of animal figures in caves or the silhouette figures of animal heads in the French Magdalenian. Finally attention must be drawn to the painting in red of the bench, another feature with parallels in Levels VI B and earlier and probably related to the custom ofred-painted floors in aceramic Hacllar, Jericho, Beidha in Jordan, and Tepe Guran in Luristan. One of the best preserved shrines of Level VI B is E VI B, 31, which was found below the " Fifth" shrine of 1962 (AS. XIII, 1963, P1. XVa). Although both its north and the greater part of the east wall are destroyed, the rest stands to a height of 6 feet (Pls. IIIc and IV and restored views, Figs. 7 and 8). Four great wall-panels in all, separated by wide gaps marking the place of vanished wooden</page><page sequence="14">46 ANATOLIAN STUDIES Ti-- _ .... . _.  - ?_ . \-S ,,~~--- r=T-~~- ~__ S--- .  , \\ , \ l ?-- .+. *-. - \- -__ -- \ "- , ??.. \?::' ??:::+. ?:..?: I r: ', ': ? :'\ i, \ : ?=, ?: ~~-T-~:~~:~~;'' i~'~'..';: ; ' |~ .?

Entering the sanctuary through a low doorway in the north wall, the worshipper saw on his right the two panels on the west wall: first a large tubby figure of a mother goddess (P1. IVb) replastered over and over again, and accompanied by the symbol of her son, a bull's head. The faint possibility that she had large ears as shown in the drawing (Fig. 7) should be noted, but it is far from certain. Several holes above the head either indicate the sockets for applied headgear or the pegs for a hanging cloth covering the figure of the goddess from the gaze of the profane. The large head, arms, and feet are broken and as the building was not destroyed by fire, it would seem that this destruction was a deliberate act, a sort of desecration of the building before it was abandoned and filled in. The arm sockets show that the lower arm (or hands) were made separately-they may have been raised as in most of the figures, but the unique method of construction rather suggests that they may have extended forwards perhaps in a gesture of blessing. The ears of the bull's head were outlined in red paint, but there were no traces of paint on the figure of the deity. Two horn-like mouldings in plaster, symmetrically placed on either side of the wooden post, strongly suggest that a bull's head had been moulded on it (Fig. 7) and on the second panel of the west wall numerous heads of bulls had been moulded in plaster. Here also the heads had been knocked off, but the horns remained more or less intact, though distorted through the weight of superimposed buildings, which made the whole panel sag out of position. As most of the heads had been keyed into the plaster of the wall, the place of attachment was marked by a scar (P1. IVa) and it is therefore possible to restore the original arrangement on paper. A third panel on the south wall (which is not usually decorated) shows a smaller relief of a goddess with outstretched arms and legs (PI. IVa). One foot touches a horizontally moulded ledge and a slightly recessed panel occurs below the figure. Its significance is not known, but it reappears in other buildings. The smaller figure may represent the younger aspect of the goddess, or her daughter. As the next panel on the south wall carried the diagonal impression of the wooden ladder leading to the roof, no space was available for a relief here, and the sequence is therefore continued on the east wall (P1. IIIc and Fig. 8). This shows another figure, with head (destroyed) in profile and hair flowing in the wind, in a state of motion or whirling. Left and right arms and legs are not of equal length, which emphasizes the idea of rapid movement. Traces of orange paint near the outstretched right arm suggest that something, perhaps held in her hand, was broken off. Nor do we have any indication of what might have been represented on the next central panel (restored as a blank) which was destroyed right down to the lower red-painted dado above the platform. In most of the other shrines the east wall is connected with death and the destruction of the possible reliefs on this wall may have robbed us of the explanation for the running goddess. This shrine is of great interest in that it appears to portray the current "pantheon" presided over by the mother goddess, her son, and husband-male spirits of fertility symbolized by large and small bulls-and her daughter (or daughters ?), younger version(s) of the great goddess herself. The small building, E VI B, 29, built against the northern end of this great shrine, also appears to have been a sanctuary, for on the east wall a niche and the scars of two broken-off bulls' heads were found. The larger again had red-painted ears. The dismantling of the remains of the west wall of Shrine E VI, I o, produced further surprises. Its original VI B floor was reached 2 feet (o.60 m.) lower down,</page><page sequence="16">48 ANATOLIAN STUDIES I o cl r / " O ?

Behind the thick layers of plaster on the west wall, earlier features were concealed such as larger niches, scars of broken-off animal heads, and the lower jaw of a wild boar above the niche in the north-west corner. There were also panels of red paint and some fragmentary geometric designs. A new reconstruction incorporating these discoveries is presented in Fig. 9, which also shows a more likely form of roofing in light materials for the central part of the building. The altered head of the goddess, based on the complete outlines of the heads in shrine E VI B, 3 i, is also suggested by the horned hair-style of the small deity carved on a spatula from Hacilar IX. This building being the best-preserved one hitherto found, it has been used as a basis for the architectural drawing reproduced in Fig. I o, which illustrates the principles of construction in use in Qatal Hiyuk VI. Here are clearly shown the plan of a house ; the division of a room into kitchen space (south end with the position of hearth, oven in the wall, and wooden ladder leading to the roof) ; the sunk area in the centre of the room and the platforms and bench along the east and north walls. The peculiar wooden half-timber structure of the walls, filled with mudbrick and thickly plastered, is diagrammatically shown together with the system of roofing which is standard in the Near East and well attested at gatal Huiytik. Level VII (Fig. i i and P1. Ia) Although the buildings described above added much to our knowledge of the plan of the area, the layout of courts and the groupings of shrines with their attendant houses for the cult personnel, not to mention the wealth of detail about neolithic religion, they did not really break any new ground. In order to investigate the lower levels, the entire lower terrace of area E was cleared down to the next building-level (VII) (Fig. iI and P1. Ia) and the plan was followed up southwards and northwards until erosion (marked by the irregular line on the plan) had removed even its foundations. In the course of this work suitable areas were found for a probe into even earlier strata (VIII-X) (Fig. 3). These earlier levels (including most of VI B) had not been destroyed by fire or hastily abandoned, but they had been lived in until they had become unfit for human habitation, and were pulled down and filled in. Finds on the floors were therefore uncommon, wooden posts had been removed for reuse or as fuel, with many of the animal heads which had been fixed on them in shrines. On the other hand, destruction by fire does not improve the wall-paintings, and a number of these were therefore well preserved. The plan of Level VII (Fig. i j) closely resembles that of Level VI B and is no less interesting. The buildings show the same crowded arrangement, the same rarity of courtyards (all condemned houses used for rubbish disposal and sanitation) and the same concentration of shrines, which are surrounded by private houses. The latter vary very much in size, according to the social status of their owners or the size of the family. The minimum requirement is a single room with two platforms and wooden ladder, hearth, and oven (e.g. room 6), but most houses are larger and better appointed. The entrance shafts are now larger and frequently they take the form of a long corridor with access to the roof. Red-painted plaster is occasionally used on benches and platforms (as in Level VI B and Aceramic Hacllar). Hearths, rectangular or square in the upper levels, are most often circular in Level VII, but they are still raised. The outside limit of the settlement presented a blank wall, with kitchen and storerooms directly behind. The remains of eight shrines have so far been identified in Level VII and they</page><page sequence="19">EXCAVATIONS AT QATAL HQYDK, 1963 51 ?`?~"?' ?~:%:?:~ I;:?.? ?.;' ;..- ?~?;"??" ]E~' :??.?:? ?: i . ?,. -?.; ? ...? .?;??? ~:::??:i c / ;;b~B~BP~B/\/ Y~~ fff~ ~(i;i ?,; r ";~~rii : ~r?i -~zi~ r c:r(,Ai ?, ~?~ ?r"?

Diagrammatic view of a typical Level VI building at Qatal Huiyiik. are grouped in twos or threes well away from the periphery of the mound. The southernmost group (VII, I, 8, and- Io) lay immediately below the Level VI B shrines (same numbers), thus showing continuity of cult: the middle group (VII, 14 and 9) were replaced in VI B by a twin shrine (VI, 14 and 7), but the northern group (VII, 35, 23, 21) had no successors, as far as we know. The small shrine (VII, 9) in the middle group was richly decorated with animal heads (P1. Va) fixed on wooden posts, but the removal of these prior to filling it had played havoc with the building and its splendour can only be seen in the reconstructions (Figs. 12 and 13). Three superimposed bulls' heads with boldly modelled horns were fixed on the south post and a single one with double horns was found on the north one. Between them a fifth head was fixed to the wall where a scar showed its former presence (Fig. 12). The east wall was simpler but similar (Fig. 13) and the place of the horns was taken by a horizontal beam. Two doorways led into a narrow corridor, at the north end of the room. Although this shrine was not rebuilt in Level VI B, the sanctity of the place was remembered in Level VI A, when a small white plastered chamber was built above it, containing the horn-cores and frontal of an enormous wild bull (AS. XII, 1962, P1. Vc, and p. 5i). The larger building to the east (VII, I4) should probably also be regarded as</page><page sequence="21">NOT EXCAVATED 0 N Fi, . Pa of b d l VII To fc p.52 2, ... ...

Vb and VIa). Nine feet in length, it covered both walls above the north-east platform which was carpeted with fine reed matting. The interpretation of the subject depicted is, of course, subjective (and perhaps controversial) but it seems likely that the eighty or more squares drawn along the base in rows or terraces represent a view of a town and one has only to compare Fig. i i with P1. VIa to see that this is indeed a possibility. Each house has its own walls and the internal divisions in the drawing remind one of the platforms, etc., in the plan, and one is struck by the variations and irregularities in the drawing of the individual houses. Therefore in our opinion this is a representation of a neolithic town, probably 9atal Hiyik itself, the houses of which rise in exactly the same manner as is shown in the painting. This brings us to the strange double-peaked object in the back and if one looks from the top of the mound to-day, such objects are easily identified as mountains. Twin cones mark the position of Konya to the north-west, twin peaks crown the mighty mass of Karadag and in the far distance one sees on a clear day the double cone of Hasan Daw (Io,ooo feet), then an active volcano and the highest mountain in the region. Hasan Dag had a special importance for the neolithic inhabitants of Qatal Hytik, for it was the source of obsidian, the volcanic glass from which they made their tools and weapons, beads and mirrors, the commodity which they exported far and wide. The exploitation of the obsidian fields and a monopoly in the obsidian trade was probably the basis of Qatal Htiyuik's wealth. Its mysterious origin, sharpness, transparency, and reflective power were probably regarded as unusual if not " magic ", the benevolent earth goddess's gift to neolithic man. Volcanic eruptions still stir even the most unimaginative moderns and must have been regarded with awe by early man. How much more so then when his precious source of income was at stake ! This brings one to the spots on the mountain, the objects spurting out of the right-hand top, the " cloud " of dots and strokes above (and to the right) of it and the lines extending from the base of the mountain. All these can be interpreted as the usual phenomena of a volcanic eruption: the rain of glowing volcanic bombs and red-hot rocks; the cloud of glowing particles above it and perhaps tongues of lava welling up from vents near the base of the mountain. It is known that the Central Anatolian volcanoes were active until the second millennium B.C. An " eye-witness " painting of an early seventh millennium eruption of Hasan Dag is therefore certainly a possibility and in view of its economic importance a highly relevant subject to be recorded in a shrine. A fine series of sanctuaries lay a little further south, below those of Level VI. The westernmost (VII, I) (P1. XIa) was decorated with monumental reliefs of cut-out figures in plaster on its west and south wall. Entering the shrine through a low doorway in the north wall one was confronted by the figure of a cow, facing right. Its single horn, ear, and eye were modelled in low relief, whereas the rest of the animal was roughly cut in the thick layers of plaster. No legs are indicated, but the animal is shown standing on a pedestal which was painted red; the cow itself was covered with pale blue paint, the only instance of the use of this colour on walls. Between the back of the cow and the back of a bull which occupies the rest of the west wall, there remained one arm, a breast and a few impressions of a goddess in relief with raised arms and legs. Asymmetrically placed below her were the trodden-down remains of a bull's head. There is just enough room for a second figure, now unfortunately lost, to balance the composition, and we know from the neighbouring shrine, E VI B, 12, that pairs of goddesses were by no means unknown (AS. XII, 1962, p. 49 ff., Fig. 8, and P1. IIIb). It is indeed far more likely that</page><page sequence="25">56 ANATOLIAN STUDIES t ,1 , /I : " 11 7 ". / ' Ni /'"" ," i: U C-,,I 0 U O O -o 4, Cl</page><page sequence="26">PLATE I (a) General view of Level VII with Level VI B on right, looking north-west.

The silhouette of the bull is even cruder than that of the cow and only its head is modelled with some care (Fig. 14). Owing to subsidence the wall (and the drawing) is unduly depressed, but the boldly moulded horn is very clear and the silhouette of the head with ear and muzzle emphasized by a cut-away recess in front of the head. Only the eye was modelled. The representation evidently emphasizes the role of the goddesses (mother and daughter ?) as Mistresses of Animals, and the bull's head below the older goddess again suggests a scene of birth, like those shown in AS. XIII, 1963, P1. IXa and Fig. 8, and P1. XVIIa and Fig. 18, from shrines of Level VI. The niorth and east walls of the same shrine (P1. XIb and Fig. 15) were covered with wall-paintings clearly imitating kilims with geometric patterns, painted in red on cream. On either side of the main post a breast and a horn are modelled in plaster, both evident symbols of fertility. Strong continuity in the occupation of this building and the next shrine above (E VI B, i) (Fig. 16) is suggested not only by the plan, but by the kilim paintings on the east wall. These were described in AS. XII, Pls. X-XI, Fig. Io, p. 59, and XIII, p. 98 and P1. XXVI, but the drawing (Fig. I6) showing the entire room is new. Unfortunately the west wall of this building was denuded of all plaster, but it is possible that it may originally have had relief decoration. All traces of this were probably removed in Level VI A when the shrine was turned into a house after it had burnt in a fire. Shrine VII, Io (P1. Xa), contained no wall-paintings at all, but was decorated with modelled and cut-out plaster animals and animal heads (Fig. 17). Along the north wall, the central post was supported by a ram's head as in the shrine above, but with a single horn. To the left of this an animal (deer ?) silhouette is cut out of the plaster, but its upper part is lost. In the north-east corner an extremely naturalistic stag on a rock is modelled in plaster and its outline on the left is defined by the cut-out technique (Fig. 17 and P1. Xb). On the east wall a fine bull's head is treated in exactly the same way and the two heads (Fig. 14 and I7) of bulls from Shrines VII I and Io are very similar. In this shrine, however, only the head of the animal is shown with a small recess in front. In the shrine above this was replaced by a bull's head, fully modelled and placed above a deep niche (AS. XIII, P1. XIVa and Fig. 15) but the symbolism remained the same. The middle shrine of this southern group, VII, 8, was situated directly below the splendid " First Shrine " (E VI, 8) found in I962. Three main phases of decoration could be distinguished, the earlier two with wall-paintings and a final one with figures cut out of the plaster. To this last phase belongs the sunk relief of a huge bull, carved on the north wall, east of the doorway (P1. VIIa and Fig. I8). The carving is at least an inch deep and carefully executed and the bull was then covered with black paint (the natural colour of the aurochs), providing a strong contrast with the surrounding white plaster and the red panels below. The head and upper part of the bull are lost, with the upper part of the narrow wall that divided the main room from the corridor at the back. The position of this bull is exactly similar to that found in the building above (AS. XIII, P1. IXb, Fig. 9) and so are the wavy lines in the plaster below the bull. It can now be shown that these were not intentional but the result of earth-pressure from above. In front of the bull there are three peg-holes (?) in the plaster of the wall, a feature also noted on the north wall of Shrine E VI, Io (AS. XIII, P1. XIIIa). In front of the bull panel there were two platforms, and on the edge of the E</page><page sequence="35">58 ANATOLIAN STUDIES =-. -....  _ _ _ _ , /O t"t O i- " ,   \ ,~ i I??~?/ 1 -~\ ~ ?\:???.:.

VIIa and Figs. I8-i9). These pillars still occur in Level VII, but they were much less common than in later levels. To manufacture them, a plentiful supply of horns of wild bulls was required and this does not seem to have been the case until Level VI A. In earlier levels, therefore, we find animal heads with horns modelled in plaster and only occasionally were actual horn cores used. The west wall of this shrine (Fig. I8) showed some interesting features. The cut-out decoration would seem to be later in date than the panel of hands painted above a red dado. On the floor a roughly modelled bull's head with a disc-shaped basin was found. This reminds one of the bull's head and libation hole to left of it found in the shrine above (AS. XIII, Fig. 8 and Pl. IXa) in exactly the same position. The plaster of the wall was cut into two animals facing each other just above this bull's head in the manner of the leopard relief in Shrine E VI, 44. The extremities of the animals are not well shown, but outlined as in the case of the cow (Fig. 14) and they likewise rest on pedestals. The cut-away portion between the animals perhaps only fortuitously resembles a violin-shaped idol, but such are not known in the neolithic of Qatal Haiyk. On the other hand, the outline of the animal heads and feet is exactly similar to those of the statuettes of goddesses with leopards, found in Shrine E VI, Io (AS. XIII, Figs. 23, 24), and one may well ask whether at some time or other busts of the two deities had not been modelled above the animals in the manner of these statuettes. The two alternatives are illustrated in Fig. 18, which shows the wall as found, and Fig. 19, which attempts such a restoration. Although there is not enough evidence to suggest that modelled figures of the mother and daughter had indeed been executed, the possibility remains and the neighbouring shrines VII, i, and VI B, 12, both had such twin deities. At the desecration of the building these figures could easily have been removed. One might also suggest that the group of three figures of deities with leopards found in shrine E VI, Io, but already old, worn and broken, originally came from this Level VII shrine, but were removed and kept as heirlooms when the building was filled in. The wall-painting found in the north-west corner is evidently earlier in date than the cut-out plaster decoration, but not as early as the vultures which appeared below the bull. It may be contemporary (or roughly so) with a panel that was found preserved just to the right of the doorway (and well away from the deep cutting of the bull). Its decorative scheme is simple and geometric, but the colours used (mauve, chalk white and black) are unusual. On the left rosettes in orange decorated the door jamb. The scheme of decoration has a close resemblance to that of the E VI B, I shrine next door (Fig. I6). The main panel in the south-west corner shows two rows of hands with the fingers pointing towards the right (and the door) framing a pattern of alternate red and black geometric " ladders and squiggles ", not unlike some of the net pattern found on the goddess in Shrine VII, 23 (P1. XIII), and perhaps likewise of textile origin (P1. VIb, c). Seven red hands line the bottom of the panel and twelve alternate red and black hands the top. Of these seven are red and five black. Most of the red hands are right, most of the black left hands, suggesting a symbolism which is still by no means extinct. All hands have an open area in the palm, which is frequently filled with one or more dots. The composition reminds one of the "honeycomb" framed by red and black hands in the decoration of the Level VI B shrine above (AS. XIII, Figs. II and I2 and P1. XII) and of the great panel of hands in Shrine E VI B, 15 (ibid., PI. XVIIIb), where very similar net patterns in black and red were found beneath them.</page><page sequence="39">62 ANATOLIAN STUDIES -:-::-:... i:.....i..? ::i I I'/ ii I 0 Cis &gt;.4 U o 1 ~0- rJ2 o U 0 c, o o 02 "0 C13 04 r.r 0 0 C6 0 z</page><page sequence="40">EXCAVATIONS AT QATAL HtYOK, 1963 63 ????\i '' - !:(~ ,?. .,??r... ,, . i __L?5;:1 4) C', 0 4,) o 0 o 3 4?,) d 4,</page><page sequence="41">64 ANATOLIAN STUDIES Wall-paintings of a quite different nature adorned this shrine (VII, 8) when it was first built (Fig. 20), perhaps a century or so before the animals were cut out of its thick wall-plaster, when at least a hundred layers of wall-plaster had reached a thickness of 4 cm. One continuous wall-painting, interrupted only by the two posts on the east wall, covered the entire wall space from the doorway to the south wall (Fig. 20). When complete the painting was nearly 6 feet in height and it took over a month to clean. It showed seven vultures (Gyps fulvus), three flying to the right and four to the left, swooping down on six human corpses, shown as lying contracted on their left side or extended, the usual position of the dead. All are headless and on one the short stump of a neck is shown. The absence of the head is probably a pictorial convention indicating that these people are dead, for neither does it correspond to the current burial customs, nor do vultures remove heads. The vultures are extremely well drawn with their enormous wings, their bald heads, the characteristic crests and short legs. The plumage of the bodies is clearly indicated and they are shown in full motion. The group on the north wall (P1. VIIb) was found below the bull, but the others on the central (P1. VIII) and south panels (P1. IX) of the east wall were even larger and better preserved, though rather faint. Individual brush marks could be seen clearly and the entire scene was painted in a dark red on a pinkish white background. A feature of these early scenes is that no account is taken of corners and the entire wall-space is treated as one continuous field of decoration, as on rocks or in caves. The interpretation of this scene again presents difficulties. It is unlikely that these people should have felt the need to show on such a monumental scale a rather macabre feature of their burial rites: the cleaning of corpses by vultures. If we bear in mind that the vulture is a symbol of the Great Goddess in her aspect of death (see AS. XIII, pp. 70, 90 and Fig. 26), it would seem more likely that the scene represents the goddess of death claiming her own-the ultimate fate of man- kind-but at the same time a necessary condition for resurrection and rebirth, the aim of every religion. Hence the monumental composition, the enormous birds of prey and the puny human corpses. Another Level VII shrine (VII, 21) also shows scenes with vultures (P1. XII) attacking a headless corpse. This scene is placed on the north wall above the corner platform and apparently continued westward (beyond a post) with a further vulture and corpse as shown in the reconstruction (Figs. 21I-2). There is, however, an important difference, for the two more or less complete vultures are shown with a pair of human legs. This suggests that they do not represent the familiar beast of prey, but human beings disguised as vultures in the performance of a (presumably funerary) rite, to which the two human skulls found on the edge of the platform bear eloquent witness. The panel below this scene was originally painted black, the colour of death, but later it was painted red, the colour of life. The panel below the continuation of the scene is one of those resembling a textile or kilim. White grooves separate red and black triangles, each with a central (white) impressed dimple, and the pattern is probably intentionally irregular. The decoration does not continue all along the north wall, but only up to the porthole entrance of the building which was found almost intact. It was placed well above ground-level so that a short ladder or some wooden steps must have been provided to facilitate entry into the shrine from the long narrow room at the back. The west wall of this building was dominated by a large modelled bull's head, with mouth and nostrils and painted ornament. In it were set the horn cores of an enormous wild bull: a single horn core, found crushed on the floor, measured</page><page sequence="42">(b) Copy by Grace Huxtable.

The huge bull's head had been fixed on to a stout wooden post, but it had fallen, partly crushing a human skull deposited below it in the process. Next to the skull were the remains of a woven basket in which the skull may have lain. North of the bull's head another grooved and painted textile pattern covered the wall (Fig. 2 I) and high above it was a projection in the form of a small breast. A plain red panel or dado ran along the wall south of the central post and above it was set a semicircular niche with a circular hole, presumably a place for libations. Rich religious imagery was concentrated on the opposite east wall (Fig. 22). A bull's head was mounted in the centre of the main panel and below it six small breasts were set in a row. Three rams' heads were grouped as shown and below the bull's head was the usual niche, painted red and set back into a red panel. In front of it another human skull was found. The vertical posts along this wall were double and painted red and beyond the southernmost a large ram's head ornamented with maeander patterns in red paint supported a combination of horn and breast, from which protruded the lower jaw of an enormous wild boar. Although Shrine VII, 2I, was evidently one of the most important found, its condition was appalling: every wall was leaning, especially the east one which had to be supported. Nearly every animal head was found on the floor and- exceptional at Qatal Htiytik-the kitchen end of the building was littered with animal bones. The smaller shrine, VII, 35, was no better preserved under the heavy weight of superimposed walls and waterlogged by the intrusion of a huge Hellenistic pit. Again a bull's head and red-painted niche, a pair of breasts and a pair of rams' (?) heads were grouped over the main platform (Fig. 23) and beyond the post a ram's head with actual ram's horns supported a pair of breasts placed vertically. In the upper breast was placed the skull of a fox, in the lower that of a weasel. A small niche was set in the wall near the ram's head and from the main north wall was suspended a large head of a bull with clay horns. The decoration of Shrines VII, 21 and 35, have much in common with the Level VI shrines 8 and Io illustrated and described in the previous report. The third shrine of this northern group, VII, 23, was of great simplicity and besides simple red dadoes it contained but a single relief placed on the east wall (Pl. XIII). It showed the figure of a goddess, just over 2 feet in height, and clearly pregnant. Concentric circles on the stomach emphasized the condition, but other- wise no sign of sex is indicated. She is shown in the posture of giving birth with upturned legs and raised arms, but what is new in this figure is that she is not only shown as dressed but is also holding up a black and yellow veil with both hands. The veil extends just beyond the body and is patterned in the same net-like way as the garment which covers her. This is coloured red with black additions on a whitish pink ground. Upon the abandonment of the shrine, the face, hands and feet were deliberately defaced. At a later date the figure was covered with white plaster and on this we found a child's hand painted in red just on the breast. Such hands were found in the previous season on animal heads (Shrine E VI, 7 and 8) and the idea of touching the deity is evidently the same, and considered beneficial to the worshipper. Shrines of Levels VIII-X Excavations below Level VII were carried out on a very restricted scale and mainly below the two adjacent Shrines VII, i, and VII, 8, where the presence of an open space behind VII, I, allowed us to construct a deep wheelbarrow passage for the removal of the earth.</page><page sequence="52">EXCAVATIONS AT QATAL HUYYK, 1963 67 "'; J i / / ' / ,S' FI /I i !  , r ?~ i/.:.. ce 0 C/ 4-?

It would seem that the area was given up to sacred buildings from the very beginning and all six may have been shrines. Below Shrine VII, 8, the " Vulture Shrine ", was found a very similar building (Shrine VIII, 8), but few traces of its decoration remained and only on the east wall was a fairly well-preserved wall-painting found (P1. XIVa). This showed two black vultures face to face, possibly painted over a geometric design in red. Between the vultures there are remains of two human figures in red : a man swinging a black sling and brandishing an indeterminate object in his left hand and below him a headless corpse lying on its left side. One has the impression that he is protecting the corpse from an attack by the two huge vultures. At the far left are more remains of blurred figures which now defy interpretation. Evidently we are shown here another version of the vulture myth. Shrine VIII, I, appears to have had geometric wall paintings on its north and east wall (like its two successors) but these were too worn to form a coherent pattern. No decoration had survived on its west wall. The shrine immediately below, IX, I, had a panel framed between two wooden posts on its west wall and on it a large bull's head and a small ram's head. A platform in the north-west corner had a red-painted floor with a sunk hearth, an arrangement suggestive of aceramic Hacilar and Jericho. Its north wall bore two successive intricate geometric paintings, overlapping in the manner of these early paintings on to the east wall, which had suffered great damage. Over its central platform only the remains of two slings painted in black had survived. The shrine next door, IX, 8, however, showed an unusual plan of antechamber with a great oven and a small, but richly decorated, sanctuary (P1. XIVb). In its final phase, the north wall bore the cut-out silhouettes of two animal heads; a horned animal (probaoly a bull) on the left and a feline (probably leopard) head on the right (Fig. 24). These were cut through deep layers of white plaster, but the second horn of the bull was destroyed when the wall was cut down to fill in the building (at the end of Level IX). Belonging to an earlier phase of decoration was a huge black bull with carefully drawn hooves (P1. XIVb), shown marching to the right. Below it was a niche and a rectangular structure drawn in red. The bull was decapitated with the destruction of the north wall. On the panel of the east wall in front of the bull was found a polychrome geometric pattern in red, black and white, imitating a kilim. Once again the presence of a bull on the north wall of shrines in this position should be noted, for this is the third in succession (Shrines VI, 8, VII, 8, and IX, 8). The building immediately underneath, X, I, had no features which definitely marked it as a shrine. The long narrow room along the north side was filled with strongly built, but empty grain-bins. A few worn smears of paint on the north and east walls of the main room suggested the possibility of geometric kilim paintings of familiar type, but they were too fragmentary to restore the pattern. However, from below the floor of this room came a slab of plaster, probably a remnant either of the plaster covering a post or perhaps part of a door-jamb with a fine maltese cross painted on it. It is therefore clear that painting at 9atal Hiiytik may have been practised even before Level X, which we tentatively date around 6500 B.c. Disappointing as this building was, its companion, Room X, I, provided us with a fine example ofa Level X shrine (Fig. 25). Although perhaps a little less developed than the splendid buildings of Levels VII and VI, it foreshadows these in its decora- tion and plan. Along the north wall we find the entry matched by a shallow niche and in between a post on which was fixed a small bull's head with large horns</page><page sequence="56">EXCAVATIONS AT QATAL H(YtK, 1963 71 tA V pa 0 Q co OV 0 0 3 q.</page><page sequence="57">72 ANATOLIAN STUDIES ? ,=) t 0,, 0 O O OI C' 6S</page><page sequence="58">EXCAVATIONS AT QATAL HUYtK, 1963 73 modelled in plaster. On the east wall a small head, painted red and with enormous horns, is shown with a pair of bulls' heads on the left and a pair of rams' (?) heads on the right, and beyond the post there is again one large and one small head and a niche beyond. Because of its depth and the tremendous weight of five successive shrines (IX-VI A) built on top of it, the walls bulged, the decoration had been somewhat compressed and its west wall was deformed beyond recognition. In all these early buildings, however, hearths and ovens are found in their customary place towards the south end of the room and the principles of construc- tion described above for Level VI, even if not quite identical, are closely similar. Before any attempt can be made to trace a development in the architecture from Levels X to VI more buildings will have to be excavated and it may suffice here to say that these lowest buildings so far excavated at qatal Hiiyfik were neither smaller nor inferior to the better known examples in the later levels. Wall-paintings and reliefs and the technique of cut-out figures in plaster seem to accompany the earliest buildings found so far on the site. The Sounding Below Room X, 8 In order to establish whether any further shrines might be found below Level X, a narrow test trench was sunk, during the last few days of the excavation, below the floor of room X, 8 which was about a metre below the actual level of the plain. Four more metres (12 feet) of occupation deposits were found in this trench (see Fig. 3) before it had to be abandoned for technical reasons. At this depth of 15 feet below the level of the plain, ground water had not yet appeared and there was no trace of virgin soil, but water was seeping in from the irrigation ditches in the plain. In this 4-metre deposit we were able to recognize not less than ten plaster floors, some of extraordinary hardness, others soft like those in the upper layers. Remains of ovens, human burials, stone and bone tools as well as animal bones were found, but no pottery or artifacts made of clay. The entire deposit gave the impression of accumulations of domestic rubbish in courtyards, rather than of houses, but down to the bottom the earth was that of decomposed yellow and green mudbricks, chunks of wall plaster and ashes. Evidently this material came from decomposed buildings, probably situated not too far away, and this bodes well for the continua- tion of the excavations. Finally it should be mentioned that on top of this almost horizontal deposit there lay a deposit of grey clay, about a foot in depth, with a brown humus layer at the top. This was probably deposited during a period of flooding, to which this side of the mound nearest the river may have been periodically exposed. STONE CULT STATUES Compared to the number and the quality of the stone statues discovered in 1962 in Level VI, those found in 1963 are on the whole somewhat inferior artistically. On the other hand, they do emphasize a number of points previously established : (a) the discovery of cult statues is invariably accompanied by a collection of stalactites and concretions, (b) the newly found statues conform to the same types established before, and (c) they show that the cult established for Level VI A had predecessors in Levels VI B and VII, thus showing continuity of cult, such as we had come to expect. Besides proper cult statues, invariably discovered within shrines, the ex-voto figurines of schematized human figures and animals continue as far back as Level IX. The latter are found near shrines, in houses or discarded on rubbish dumps.

The stone statues (Figs. 26-32 and Pls. XV-XVII) found during the 1963 season derive from three building-levels: the " Leopard Shrine " (VI A, 44), the " Boar's head Shrine " (VI B, 45) and the " Second Vulture Shrine " (VII, 21) and its adjacent house (VII, 24). FIG. 27. Figure of a standing goddess. Black stone, Height : 12 cms. From Leopard Shrine. The group of statuettes from the " Leopard Shrine " consisted of two standing figures of black volcanic stone ; a bold naked goddess (Fig. 26 and P1. XVa-b) and a somewhat smaller and more schematized one which appears to be dressed in a shawl (?) (Fig. 27). Perhaps these two figures represent the older and younger aspects of the Great Goddess, i.e. mother and daughter. The older figure resembles the Goddess found with the vulture (AS. XIII, 1963, P1. XXIIc, d). It was coated with carbonized grain lying on the platform in front of the left-hand (female) leopard, suggesting that it was used in some fertility rite at the time of the destruc- tion of the shrine. The second statue lay with another group of figures, concretions and stalactites in the space between the two platforms, seen in the reconstruction (Fig. 5).

With it lay another more stylized carving, also of alabaster (Fig. 28b and P1. XVIa) showing a bearded male, seated. Still in the same group there was a brown limestone figure (Fig. 3oa and P1. XVIb) without any indications of a head, a crude one in chalk (Fig. 31c and P1. XVIIa), a small bust and an animal head roughed out in pumice stone. One of the finest finds lay a little further east, on the very edge of a deep Hellenistic pit which is probably responsible for its destruc- tion. It was a fine alabaster head (Fig. 31 b and P1. XVIc) with a sockethole in the neck, showing that it had been made separate from the body. The large size of the head (5'4 cm.) suggests that the entire statue might have been nearly a foot in height. The face is that of a young man and it may have resembled the Young God found in 1962 (AS. XIII, 1963, P1. XXIIa, b). With this group of carvings which lay in disorder in the centre of the room was found a collection of white, yellow and pink stalactites and limestone concretions, and a further collection of stalactites, some up to a foot in length, was deposited outside the doorway to the shaft in the north-east corner of the building. Many of these stalactites were selected for their resemblance to clusters of breasts and the limestone caves from which these came either lie in the region between Beygehir and Seydigehir, west of the plain, or further south near Hadim and Tagkent. This group of statuettes from the " Leopard Shrine " (VI, 44) is of the same date as the two deposits from Shrines VI, 10 and VI A, 25. All were destroyed by fire at the end of Level VI A and burnt debris sealed the deposits. Although they cannot be later than Level VI A, it is quite possible that many of them were made at an earlier date, as we pointed out in our previous report. A pebble with carved eyes and mouth (Fig. 3ob) was found between the west wall of Shrine E VI, IO, and its adjacent storeroom and belongs to the same type as the figure in AS. XIII, 1963, P1. XIXc. Fig. 3 id illustrates a small alabaster seated goddess that was found in the narrow room of the " Boar's head Shrine " of Level VI B (P1. XVId). It shows a new type with closer resemblances to the neolithic stone figures of Crete and Greece, but artistically it is not remarkable. Some earlier statues were found in building-level VII. A fine one of white calcite (Fig. 32, P1. XVIIc, d) was found in a basket accompanied by a stone pestle and a bone scoop in the anteroom to Shrine E VII, 21. It has a very large (unfinished ?) head on a fine muscular body and shows a young male seated on a bull with a clearly defined head, extremely like the plaster heads in the shrines. From the adjacent room (E VII, 24) came a group of natural limestone con- cretions, a few strange stones and two statuettes. One of these is a water-worn block of limestone (Fig. 28a) with a resemblance to the statue of a god riding an animal (Fig. 29) and the resemblance is emphasized by the carved and polished head. The second figure is a small seated female in white calcite (Fig. 3ia, P1. XVIIb) perhaps shown seated on something, but the preservation is such as to make this a little uncertain. If we add this additional group of statuettes to the ones already found in I962, it can be seen that certain more or less standardized types are emerging. Besides the purely aniconic forms of concretions and stalactites, objects of awe and reverence unshaped by human hand, we have those where certain features are shaped to enhance a resemblance. To this same group belong the pebble-figures with incised eyes or mouth and sometimes with carved noses. Next come the schematic figures, fully carved, but with few features (and their clay ex-voto counterparts) and finally the fully anthropomorphic statues : female deities, standing or seated males, seated or riding on animals (probably bulls, but possibly rams), old goddesses and their</page><page sequence="64">EXCAVATIONS AT QATAL HUYTK, 1963 79 (a) (b) (c) (d) FIG. 3I.

So far these types have been traced down to Level VII, but if, as there seem grounds for believing, the clay ex-voto figures copied the stone cult statues, then we may expect similar carvings at least as far down as Level X. Shrines and wall-paintings of Levels VIII-X have already appeared and earlier statues may be expected. THE TRANSITION FROM AN ACERAMIC TO A CERAMIC NEOLITHIC The recognition that pottery is not a characteristic of the earliest neolithic in the Near East is comparatively recent and was first established at Jarmo in Iraq and at Jericho in Jordan. Since then aceramic neolithic cultures have been recognized at numerous sites throughout the Near East, as well as in its influence zone in South-eastern Europe, in Greece and the Balkans. The introduction of pottery therefore does not accompany the earliest neolithic settlements, but is a later development, and its introduction is usually abrupt without a phase of transition, at least in Mesopotamia and Palestine on the one hand and in South-eastern Europe on the other. The latest discoveries in the Zagros mountain-zone point towards the discovery of pottery in this area, from which it spread to Mesopotamia, but a second independent centre of discovery lay in Southern Turkey, which appears to have influenced both South-eastern Europe as well as Syria and Palestine. The products of these two independent areas have little in common and no links can yet be established between them. It would appear that the Anatolian pottery is the earlier in date, appearing first around 6500 B.C., but not coming into general use until half a millennium later. The excavations at Qatal Hiyuk in 1963 have moreover shed important light on the transition from aceramic to ceramic neolithic in that we have found abundant evidence for what materials were in use in the aceramic period. Unlike Jarmo and Jericho, where stone vessels predominate, the people of Qatal Huiyik made extensive use of wood and basketry besides bone, antler and stone, for the manufacture of containers. This probably reflects the local ecology, for Qatal Huiyuk lies in an alluvial plain surrounded by forests, whereas Jarmo or Jericho lie in the hills (or near them) within easy reach of stone. There is a further point of great interest at Qatal Htiyuk, for here the introduction of pottery did not correspond to a change of culture, as e.g. in Greece, Palestine or Syria, but merely marked the arrival of a new material and a new technological advance. The Pottery Sequence at Qatal Hiiyiik In the top six building-levels (V-O) pottery was in common use, gradually increasing in quantity and improving in quality as time went on. A western off- shoot of this pottery developed into the Late Neolithic ware of Hacilar Late Neolithic (levels IX-VI, c. 5700-5600 B.C.), but Late Neolithic developments in the Konya Plain itself are not yet known. In the burnt level VI A, however, pottery was exceedingly scarce, not only in the houses and shrines, which were kept scrupulously clean, but also in the court- yards and rubbish pits which served as a repository for household rubbish. The pottery illustrated in AS. XII, 1962, Fig. 9, as from Level VIII, came from such pits and can be reassigned to Level VI A now that the entire area has been excavated and the stratigraphy re-examined. Less than fifty pots or fragments thereof have been found in sixty-five shrines, houses, store-rooms and three courts-an average of less than one pot per house. There is good evidence to show that this building-level lasted at least sixty years but as the life of a pot is short it is obvious that the amount of pottery found can</page><page sequence="67">82 ANATOLIAN STUDIES only represent the very last occupation of the houses, etc., immediately prior to the fire in which they were destroyed c. 5900 B.C. This late VI A pottery was already a highly accomplished product; it was made by hand from local clay which contained small grits, but no straw. It was coil-built on a flat surface and finished by paddle and anvil so that the walls are thin. It was highly burnished, hard fired, dark in colour, but otherwise undecorated. Shapes were few and simple with flat or, less commonly, ring bases, round or square. The mouths of the vessels were round, oval or rectangular and beakers and hole- mouth shapes predominate. Lugs and basket-handles were numerous and lugs were horizontally or vertically perforated. Functionally one can distinguish cooking-pots and storage jars, often buried up to their neck in the ground, bowls, cups and boxes. The technical competence shown by this pottery shows an advanced technique, evidently already far removed from the first fumbling beginnings of pottery-making. The complete absence of any pottery in the extensive building-complex of Level VI B (Fig. 2), with sixty-five houses and shrines, was therefore most surprising and the situation in building-level VII (Fig. I I), with thirty-eight rooms and two courts, very similar. One bowl, probably intrusive (Fig. 33 : I), was found in this building-level and one single sherd in the four or five rooms cleared of the next earlier level VIII. Had excavations been conducted on a smaller scale one would probably have regarded Levels VI B-VIII as " pre-pottery ". In building-level IX, however, the two sanctuaries excavated each produced two or three sherds (Fig. 33 : 2-6) and eight further sherds (Fig. 33 : 7-14) came from a shrine in Level X. As no houses of these building-levels have yet been reached, it is impossible to say whether pottery was more common in these early layers, but a deep sounding, penetrating 4 metres of occupation deposits below Level X (see section, Fig. 3) and a depth of 5 metres (15 feet) below the present level of the plain, yielded not a single sherd of pottery. This suggests that below Level X we may indeed have reached a fully aceramic or " pre-pottery " period. This earliest pottery then (Levels IX-X) is of considerable interest, for it is evidently the ancestor of the developed pottery of Level VI A. Although more FIG. 33.

Bases are already flat, lug handles are more solid, but the shapes show little difference from those of the later ware. This pottery is in every respect comparable to, if not identical with that found in the top layer of a rock shelter at Beldibi, south-west of Antalya on Anatolia's south coast (Fig. 33 :A-H). Similar pottery was also found at Belbap, near Beldibi, but has not yet been illustrated and it also occurs at Reis Tiimegi, a small mound west of Kiiiikk6y, a few miles north-west of Qatal Htiyiik, where we found it in 1958. At Beldibi this pottery may have come from the Anatolian plateau (the reverse direction is most unlikely) and there it was associated with a local microlithic stone industry of " Mesolithic" type and schematic rock-paintings. At Qatal Hyaik IX and X we have wall-paintings in sanctuaries or shrines, but no trace yet of a " Mesolithic " industry. The present evidence from Qatal Huiyiik therefore suggests that the first pottery was made there c. 6500 B.C. or thereabouts but did not come into general use until the end of Level VI A, some 6oo years later. Why this was so, we can only guess; either local conservatism of the inhabitants of the priestly quarter was opposed to the use of this new material, just as most of us object to plastic and cardboard cups and plates, or the primitive pottery could not compete with the traditional wood- work and baskets until it had reached a more developed state and proved its usefulness all round. Whichever of the two suggestions may turn out to be the right one, it is clear that somewhere else on the mound-and that is probably in the not yet excavated artisan quarter-pottery-making developed from the primitive products of Levels X-IX to the competent wares of Level VI A. In the meantime it is abundantly clear that this development was a local one and that vessels of other materials took the place of pottery (in the quarter excavated) during the first half of the 7th millennium B.C. Vessels of Stone and Bone Three seasons of excavations at Qatal Huyiiuk have yielded less than a dozen stone vessels and it is therefore clear that these were not widely used. Although the site lay in the middle of an alluvial plain, various rocks were brought from the mountains around for the manufacture of querns and grinding stones, pounders, mortars and pestles, polishing stones, adzes and axes and jewellery. Varied rocks were used for the carving of religious statuettes or for weapons and it was certainly not technical incompetence which was responsible for the lack of stone bowls and dishes. The reason is probably a simple one: there already existed a well- established tradition of making vessels and containers in the more tractable and perishable materials such as basketry, wood and bone. Stone vessels would be luxury objects and this is exactly what their rare occurrence in shrines or with important burials suggests. The thin-walled marble bowl on crescent feet from Level IV, the four spouted dishes in fine veined red limestone from various shrines in Level VI A, the similar white marble dish (P1. XVIIIa) found with the ceremonial dagger (P1. XXVIb) in a male grave of Level VI A in room 29, all show accom- plished carving and rare materials and so were obviously either the possessions of the rich or used for ritual purposes. The depression in the edge of the dish and the two holes on either side may have served for tying on a handle of a different material, probably wood. More common than stone vessels are those made of bone or antler but here the size of the vessel and to some extent its shape were conditioned by the size of</page><page sequence="70">EXCAVATIONS AT QATAL HUYQK, 1963 85 the raw material. Most are oval or subrectangular scoops or small bowls (P1. XVIIIc, d) from Levels VI-VII, but similar ones are found as late as Level II. Baskets Far more usual than vessels of stone, bone or antler are those made of basketry. The impressions of baskets or their silica skeletons (shown as a white powdery substance) occur in all building-levels from I to X, and even below, but it is from the burials of Levels VI A and VI B that we are able to restore a fair number of 2 5 4 5 7 7 " " S FIG. 34.

The dead were buried with baskets as funerary gifts, as containers for red ochre, rouge or food, and baskets were also used for the burials of children, skulls or even adults (Pls. XXIIb, XXIIIa). Pot burial, so common in Anatolia in the Late Chalcolithic and Early Bronze Age was preceded by burials in baskets, just as the use of baskets preceded that of pottery. To this day in Anatolia, baskets are used as containers to a far greater extent than pots, thus showing not only the extreme conservatism of the Anatolian peasant but the usefulness of this material. The influence exercised by the traditional basket shapes on the new pottery vessels is unmistakable and such features as basket handles on pots are themselves an indication of the medium from which some of these shapes are derived. Wooden Vessels (Figs. 35-9) The conflagration which put an end to Level VI A was of such intensity that the heat of the burning buildings above penetrated to the depth of about 3 feet or more below the floor level of the buildings, carbonizing bodies and burial gifts alike and preventing all further bacterial decay. To this we owe the conservation of</page><page sequence="71">86 ANATOLIAN STUDIES numerous perishable materials; flesh and tar on the human bones, desiccated and carbonized brains inside human skulls, traces of the wrappings-skin, leather, fur and textile-in which the dead were shrouded, and the accompanying perishable burial gifts, wooden bowls, cups, plates, boxes, staffs, as well as their contents, food, etc. The wooden vessels recovered from these burials or in a few instances from the floors of buildings in Levels VI A and B show that by the end of the 7th millennium B.c. woodcarving had reached a remarkable degree of elegance and sophistication. These wooden vessels were by no means rare: in Shrine E VI, Io, not less than twenty wooden vessels were recorded and sometimes red paint was applied to the wood, as it was to baskets, and pottery afterwards. The wood from which these vessels were made has not yet been analysed, but it is expected that it was a soft wood (such as poplar or willow) that grew along the river on which the site was situated. The wood required was probably cut by the greenstone polished axes and adzes which abound at gatal Hiiyiik and the vessels were cut from wood probably with obsidian tools of various types and shapes that have so far attracted little attention in an industry distinguished by magnificent weapons. Joints, pegs, dowels or glue were apparently not used and bowls, dishes, boxes and lids were cut out of solid blocks of wood. Those fifteen shapes that are more or less completely preserved have been restored on paper by our artist, Grace Huxtable (Figs. 35-9), but there are numerous smaller fragments, parallels for which are needed to allow a safe restoration on paper. For here as with the later pottery, the use of ovals hinders the determination of the diameter, and in the case of boxes fragments of straight sides give no indication of the possible (square, oblong or elongated) shape of the vessel. There are shallow round dishes (Fig. 35: 3; Pl. XXIa) and deeper bowls of the same shape (Fig. 35: I and 36: 2) with flat, disc or ring bases as well as oval conical bowls (Fig. 361: ), sauceboats on a foot (Fig. 36: 3-4) and boat-shaped vessels (Fig. 35: 2, 4; Pls. XX, XXIb) with straight-sided ends and a flat base. Wider and oval dishes with broader ledge-handles at the narrow ends are common (Figs. 37: 3, 5, and 38: 1-2 ; P1. XIXb) and a large " meat-dish " of the same type, but 50 cm. in length (see AS. XIII, 1963, P1. VIIa) had carved handles. There are several small circular flat-based bowls and an " egg-cup " (Fig. 39 : 4-5), shapes which are imitated in pottery. A wooden spoon (Fig. 37 : 2; Pl. XVIIIb) resembles others in bone and might be regarded as the ancestor of the famous Konya kagifi (the Konya Spoon). Particularly common are boxes with lids, carefully made, of elegant design, and provided with lugs and knobs, some of which may have been used for fastening or for lifting the lid, whereas others are purely decora- tive (e.g. Fig. 39 : 3, ornamented with a disc surrounded by a groove). These boxes vary in size and shape and whereas most are oblong (Figs. 37 : I, 4, and 39: 3 and P1. XXId), others are oval (Fig. 38 : 4-5 and P1. XIXa) or oblong with a square opening and lid (Fig. 38: 3 and P1. XXIc). It may be expected that as excavations continue further shapes will emerge, but those that have been found already show that in the absence of pottery, the early neolithic people of gatal Hiiyik owned complete " dinner sets " made of wood. The strength of this woodcarving tradition was such, that even after the introduction of pottery at the end of Level VI A (to which most of these shapes belong) it made itself felt in the entire pottery repertoire as late as Levels III and II (the evidence from the latest levels I and O is too scanty to form an opinion). There we still find oval, lozenge-shaped, square and subrectangular pots in con- siderable numbers side by side with others which ultimately derive from basketry</page><page sequence="72">"tt ' " \ i((1ti I l'lljrF l ii " ltl tfi' ; I , Ij (i It W]i' \1\ I' r;4!

They help us to restore wooden vessels of types not yet encountered in the carbonized repertoire found in building-level VI. Influence of woodwork and basketry continues well beyond the life-span of Qatal Htiyak, both in the Konya Plain and in the Hacilar culture, and it is therefore most unlikely that woodcarving stopped after the introduction of pottery. Like basketry, this ancient craft evidently continued to be practised for thousands of years to come, and the persistency of such old traditions brings up the question as to when it began. What we see at Qatal Huiyiik in the 7th millennium B.C. is probably only the end of a very long tradition and there is no reason to assume that basketry-making and wood-carving was not already practised in the preceding Mesolithic and the Upper Palaeolithic periods which did not lack the material, the tools or the necessary skill. BURIAL CUSTOMS AND GRAVE GOODS The neolithic people of Qatal Huiyik did not bury their dead in cemeteries outside the settlement, but below the floors of their houses and shrines. Burials in courtyards, storerooms or passages are unknown and even within the buildings the majority of burials lie below the raised platforms. Only in buildings with great numbers of burials do we find an occasional one outside the boundary of the sleeping platforms, and this was probably caused by lack of space. As far as can be seen this only happened in shrines of Level VI which remained in use during two successive phases of buildings (VI A and B), representing a period of possibly a century and a half or more. The dead are buried at an average depth of about 2 feet and there are no specific graves, for the edge of the platforms served as a demarcation-line. Those burials found outside the platform areas lie in oval graves. There is no definite orientation, but the head is turned towards the centre of the building, the feet towards the wall. Most (but not all) burials lie on their left side in a contracted position (Pl. XXIIIb), but some are extended on their back. In the shrines and houses of Level VI several layers of burials (Pl. XXIIa) are not uncommon and later burials frequently disturbed the bones of earlier interments. In the later layers less care seems to have been taken not to disturb earlier burials, but throughout the period from Level X to Level I no changes in burial customs seem to have occurred. The treatment of the corpse after death is still difficult to determine, but the extremely tight flex, the twisted and contorted positions of anatomically intact burials, the use of a paint on the skeletons, the parcels of disjointed bones and the skulls wrapped in cloth all suggest the decomposition of the softer tissues and the removal of the flesh before the dead were committed to the grave. This is further suggested by the frequent preservation of textiles, mats, etc., especially where they were protected from the effects of the fire above, i.e. below the burials. On the other hand, had those bodies been intact, this would have been the last place where perishable material would have survived. This alone suggests that the corpses when buried had lost all soft tissues, and were dried out with the desiccated ligaments still holding the body together in its correct anatomical position. Wrapped in cloths or skins fastened with straps and thongs, the corpses were then buried below the platforms, probably at a given time of the year, e.g. the spring festival. On this occasion the living evidently did not occupy their houses and shrines; their bedding was removed, the platforms opened, graves dug and after the funerary rites were over the entire building was replastered and if necessary, repainted. In our previous report (AS. XIII, pp. 95-8) we suggested that the processes of excarnation took place in special morgues or charnel-houses, as shown in one of</page><page sequence="78">EXCAVATIONS AT CATAL HQYOK, 1963 93 the wall-paintings. The wall-paintings with the vultures from two shrines of Level VII and one from VIII, very strongly suggest that vultures carried out this work of excarnation, picking the skeletons clean. I am assured that it is unlikely that their beaks would leave any marks on the bones, nor were any such marks found. A more efficient way of cleaning corpses is hard to imagine and the only parts left undisturbed were the brains, which in many of the Level VI burials were actually found. In one skull in Room E VI, I, however, the brain had been extracted and a piece of cloth substituted (Pl. XXIVa). The question that remains to be answered is why secondary burial should have been chosen and the answer is probably simple hygiene. Probably for the same reason the dead were buried outside the settlements in western Anatolia, e.g. at Hacilar. Individual graves are rare and most houses act as family burial sites and the longer the building is occupied the greater is the number of bodies found. The maximum number from one shrine (E VI, Io A and B) is thirty-two, but house E VI B, 34 yielded not less than twenty-seven burials (Pl. XXIIa). The average number is about eight per room, but it is often difficult to say over how many generations they extended. Moreover the great preponderance of women and children over males strongly suggests that many males died and were buried away from home while hunting, fighting or trading. Whereas it may eventually be possible to work out the size of a family from the number of bodies and the length of occupation of a building, such a calculation is fraught with uncertainties. The number of beds (i.e. what the platforms were certainly used for) per room offers a much safer guide. There are never less than two of these: a square one in the corner and a much larger one (with a bench on one side) along the main wall. From the skeletons below them it would appear that the small one is the man's bed, whereas the much larger bed between the two red-painted posts has women and children buried below it. The differences in size, but even more specifically in the decoration of the walls above each, leaves no doubt that the woman's bed is the more important one in the house. Where a third or even a fourth platform is found (as in many shrines) the burials below them never indicate persons of wealth or importance and most of them are those of children. The burials in shrines show few differences from those found in the houses but one may note the rarity of males and weapons and the frequent use of copper and lead as trinkets for women and children. Perhaps only the priestesses and their families were buried in shrines. Even more tantalizing is the significance of ochre burials, in which the skull or the body was painted with red ochre or probably cinnabar. They are far from common and out of a total of about 400 skeletons (or parts thereof) only eleven show this treatment. Such burials have been found from Level III to Level IX and most, if not all, appear to have been of female sex. One was a prematurely born infant (Shrine E VI, I4), another a mother buried with a child on top of her (Shrine E VIII, i) and a third, a girl of about seventeen (Shrine E IX, I), was treated with red ochre all over the body and cinnabar on the skull as well. Red ochre covered the skull and the entire upper part of the body of a child found under the large building E IV, 8 (see AS. XIII, p. 95), etc., and though many of these burials come from shrines, others were found in houses. A female body, the head of which bore a broad band of brilliant cinnabar paint, came from House E VI, 2o. Green paint was found on three burials in Levels VI and VII. In one case, a male (?), it covered the bones; in another, female, it had been applied to the</page><page sequence="79">94 ANATOLIAN STUDIES " eyebrows" on the skull. More common than green was bright blue paint, made from pounded azurite. It was found near the bottom of the skull and adhering to the neck and clavicles of not less than ten skeletons, male and female, in Levels VII and VI. It has not yet been found in later layers, but it is perhaps not a coincidence that blue and green apatite beads become extremely common for necklaces in Levels V and IV. It should also be noted that the blue and green pigments, both copper carbonates, while used in the service of the dead, have with one exception (a cow painted blue) not yet been found in wall-paintings. The question of why these pigments were used in burials and to whom they were applied cannot yet be answered. Gifts with the blue and green painted burials were rich by Qatal Huiytik standards, but the red ochre burials were on the whole not very wealthy, a necklace being their main funerary offering. It is the gifts buried with the dead which more often than not give one a fair idea of the status of the people that inhabited certain houses, the more so when as in the case of House E VI, 20, they are quite denuded. From these funerary gifts (as well as from the size of houses) it is clear that there may have been appreciable differences in social status. Nor is it infrequent to find that large and well-appointed houses (like E VI, 4, E VI, 34 and E VI B, 12) showed no signs of luxury among the burial gifts of the family, whereas other less distinguished houses were inhabited by rich people, e.g. E VI, 29 or VI, 5. In other cases large houses, like E VII, 12, produced exactly what one had come to expect from its obviously wealthy owners. Although one cannot describe any of these graves as " princely ", the objects buried with the dead at Qatal Htiyiik are often of superb quality and these people were better provided for than any of their contemporaries in the Near East. The variety of funerary objects gives one a fair picture of the range of things used in daily life. It should be noted that pottery or figurines, human or animal, were never found with the dead. The skeletons were laid on mats, placed in baskets (Pls. XXIIb, XXIIIa) or most common of all wrapped in cloth, skin or fur. There are traces of skull-caps, string skirts, fringed garments, shawls and fine cloth (P1. XXIV). Straps of cloth or rope held the wrapped up corpses together. Characteristic of male burials are bone " hooks-and-eyes ", fastenings which were sewn or tied on to belts of cloth or leather. Several varieties of these have been discovered (Figs. 43 : 17-22; 44) and when in situ they are invariably found near the waist. With other male burials are toggles of antler, perhaps to fasten cloaks (Fig. 42 : 1-4). Weapons are the prerogative of males; several men were buried with one or two polished maceheads of white marble, conglomerate or limestone, and in another man's grave a long wooden staff was found. A group of exquisitely carved obsidian javelin heads were deposited in a bag near the legs (P1. XXVIa) and other males were accompanied by an arrowhead, a bone wristguard (Fig. 42: 14) or a lethal spearhead of obsidian respectively. By far the most usual male burial gift is a fine flint dagger (or hunting knife) with serrated edges, pressure flaked on one side and polished in the other. These had handles of wood, or chalk pommels (Fig. 52 : i6), but the finest example (Fig. 46 and P1. XXVIc) had a bone handle carved in the form of a coiled snake. The animal's eyes are clearly shown and the scales of the reptile are indicated by pointilli design. The hilt of this knife was fixed on to the blade by means oflime-plaster, to which a glue or resin was probably added, and the point of junction wrapped round with fine twine, the impressions of which are preserved in the film of lime that still adheres to the lower part of the hilt. This magnificent weapon, Io inches (25 5 cm.) long, found with a male burial</page><page sequence="80">EXCAVATIONS AT QATAL HQYOK, 1963 95 in House E VI A, 29, was evidently a luxury weapon, probably only used ceremon- ially; and similar knives had been found in 1962 deposited as offerings in Shrine E VI, 14 (AS. XIII, P1. XXVIIa). Lesser males were accompanied by their flint knives, scrapers or fabricators, an obsidian knife-blade or a pair of flint sickle-blades. Some had clay seals (Fig. 41 : 6, io), a stone plate (P1. XVIIIa) or a bone scoop instead of pottery. Wooden vessels and baskets were found with both sexes. Personal ornament of the male was restricted to an occasional stone pendant, a few beads, shells or animal teeth, evidently worn as amulets, and sometimes copper finger-rings (in Shrine A VI, I). The funerary gifts of women and children consist almost entirely of jewellery, toilet articles and tools used by women such as bone spoons and spatulas, made from the ribs of wild cattle and used for feeding children. Bone bodkins are found for the manufacture of matting and basketry, greenstone miniature axes, possibly used as hoes, stone palettes for grinding red paint, shells as paint containers, etc. Occasionally a knife is discovered with the burial of a woman. Small bone pins near the shoulder were probably used for fastening garments, delicate bone sticks still covered with green paint were used for applying make-up, baskets with rouge fully prepared and brilliantly polished obsidian mirrors to study the effect, are characteristic features of rich women's graves at Qatal HUiytik. The finest of these mirrors from E VI, 20 was set in lime-plaster and beautifully smoothed to fit the owner's hand. The rouge (mixed with fat) and the mirror were kept in an oval and a round basket respectively. Another woman's burial in Shrine E VI, 7 was given a basket, painted red, a long string of dentalium beads and a bracelet of white marble; a third in House E VII, I2 wore a collar made from two pieces of incised boar tusk (Fig. 40). Perforations at the ends show the method of fastening and several smaller holes may have served for the attachment of strings (of beads ?). Women as well as men in Shrine A VI, I wore copper finger-rings, and a child in Shrine E VI, 14 was buried with eleven finger-rings of bone on all fingers. In the shrine above were found two animal bones in the process of being cut up into finger-rings of the same type. Beads were used in enormous numbers and made up into necklaces, bracelets, armlets and anklets, often up to eight strands wide. Many of the necklaces or strings of beads end in a pendant or amulet and two of these are remarkable for technological reasons. One (P1. XXVc) shows drilling through a flat roughly triangular pendant of obsidian, the other is a small bull's head pendant from the Leopard Shrine, carved in black stone, the drilled-out eyes inlaid with another stone, green apatite. In the damp earth of the graves the arrangement of the beads could often be observed over short stretches, in other cases the numbers of beads of the same colour offer some indications as to how they were strung, but sometimes there is nothing to go by and the rearrangement is left to good taste. Spacer beads appear in Level IV, but it is clear that multiple-stranded necklaces were common before. Strings of white, red and black beads surrounded an infant burial in Level V and babies buried with women, perhaps their mothers, frequently have a pendant of shell or mother-of-pearl as an amulet. Most of the beads are of simple shapes-discs, tubes, barrels (P1. XXVb), ovals, lozenges, etc.-but some approach the so-called butterfly or double-axe beads of later times (P1. XXVd). Far more striking than the individual shapes is the good taste displayed in the combination of materials : beads of gleaming white lead are strung between jet black limestone (P1. XXVa) ; white alabaster alternates with</page><page sequence="81">96 ANATOLIAN STUDIES IN' / *' F;- *I9-- /-- /, -, 4Cc% 44% 8~p. 96_A ~P~ '~4-~/ IV ;rb.~Pi' -~10 FIG. 40.

XXVc), slate, boar tusk, bone, schist, mica, animal teeth, calcite, alabaster, carnelian (rare), obsidian, apatite (blue, green or white), serpentine, and red, grey, green, blue, black and white limestone. Dentalium shell from the Mediterranean was cut into tubes or small slices, and cockle (cardium), whelk and freshwater shells were sliced and strung. Cowries were rare, but mother-of-pearl was frequent. To obtain all these varied materials it is clear that neolithic man at Qatal Huyiik maintained a widespread net of trade, for not a single one of these materials could be found within less than several days' journey from the town. " STAMP SEALS " (Figs. 4I and 42) The twenty seals illustrated here were found during the first three seasons of excavation at Qatal Huiyiik and range from Levels VI to II. Whereas five examples were found together in the Shrine of Level II (A II, i), all the others come from the floors of houses in Levels II-V or from burials below their floors (Levels IV and VI). In no case was more than one seal found in a house. These seals are made of baked clay and bear incised ornament, but the incised pattern is never filled with a white material or with colour, nor were any traces of dye observed on them, but it is unlikely that organic vegetable dyes would have left any. Without denying the possibility that the people of Qatal Huiyiik painted themselves with such stamps on certain occasions-a possibility suggested by the painted figure of a goddess (illustrated in AS. XIII, Fig. 28)-it seems much more likely that these flat seals were used for stamping patterns on to cloth. In this connexion it is perhaps worth pointing out that the quatrefoil design (Fig. 41 :6) recurs frequently on a textile painting in the Second Shrine of Level III (AS. XIII, Pls. III, IVb) and that such stamp-seals become extremely common in Level II, from which no wall-paintings have so far been recovered. Did stamped cloth hangings take the place of textile paintings in the earlier shrines ? Even without proof this is a possibility that demands consideration. The same question arises with our textiles: were some of these ornamented with stamped designs in vegetable dyes ? Here again no answer can be given, for vegetable dyes are fugitive and carbonized material preserves no colour. The patterns on these seals are of great interest and many are based on the spiral and the maeander-patterns already known in the Late Upper Palaeolithic of Mezine in the Ukraine whereas others are closely related to those of the Sesklo and Starcevo cultures of the Balkans and those of Nea Nikomedia in Macedonia (ILN., I8th April, 1964) in particular. In Anatolia also, the distorted maeanders like those of Figs. 40 : I and 41 : 2 look like the prototypes of the" Hacllar motif" of Levels V-II and the regular maeanders with dots reappear in wall-paintings and pottery (painted or incised) at Can Hasan a millennium or so later (AS. XII, 1962, P1. II and Fig. 9 :4). The seals in the form of a hand (Fig. 41 : 3, 4) likewise form a link between the paintings of hands in the Cave Art of Europe, the wall- paintings of (atal Hiiyik VII and VI B and the hands painted on the pottery of Hacilar V-II. Finally, the use of similar stamp-seals of clay in Hacllar II (5480- 5250 B.C.) shows the continuity of this tradition, even though none have been found in the earlier levels on that site. The possibility that in wooded areas such stamp-seals were made of wood should always be borne in mind.</page><page sequence="91">98 ANATOLIAN STUDIES 2 3 4 II 9 10 FIG. 41.

Bone tools.</page><page sequence="93">100 ANATOLIAN STUDIES THE BONE INDUSTRY The site of Qatal Htiyuk shows us a rich industry in bone and some of the range of tools and utensils made of bone and antler is illustrated in Figs. 42-4. Bone tools, cut with flint or obsidian knives and invariably polished, occur in all building-levels, but some are more common than others and a fair number are known only from a particular building-level, e.g. the belt fasteners in Levels VI A and B. By far the most numerous tool is the awl (Fig. 42 :6, 7), usually made from the long bones of sheep and goat, and used for piercing leather, etc. These occur in various sizes from the lowest (pre-X) levels right through the entire occupation of the site and that of ?Qatal West as well. The bone polisher (?), Fig. 42 : 8-9, is nearly as common, but does not occur before Level V. It is evidently not a punch as was once thought, for the edge is never battered. Like the numerous flat tools made of ribs of cattle (Fig. 42 : 10o-3, 16-20) nearly all of which come from the upper levels, they were probably used for the preparation of skins and leather. Nos. io and 19 might be described as bone knives, but they lack a cutting edge; the bone tubes (21-2) were probably handles, the first from Level II for a copper awl, the second from Level V for a miniature stone chisel. Such bone handles are rare at Qatal Hiiyiik, where wood probably was more widely used. The rounded ends of the tools nos. 16 and 20 are reminiscent of those in the Upper Palaeolithic sites of South Russia, but they lack the incised decoration. Of the three wristguards found so far at Qatal Hiyiik, two are here illustrated (Fig. 42 : 14, 15) ; the first has grooves for tying on, whereas the earlier ones are plain. The first four pieces in Fig. 42 are made of antler, a tougher material than bone. No. I is a toggle of familiar type and the others may have served the same purpose; they are only found with male burials, usually in a position behind the back, but higher up than the belt hooks and eyes (AS. XIII, P1. XXVIIc, d, and Fig. 43: 17-22 and 44). These are so far confined to Levels VI A and B, with a possible offshoot (Fig. 42 : 5) in Level III. There are a number of variants both in hooks and eyes, but nearly all (except Fig. 43 : i8) have one hole for sewing on to the leather, and one or two larger ones in the " eye ". Particularly interesting is the fact that belt hooks of this type have also appeared in the preceramic layers of Soufli Magoula in Thessaly (see C. Zervos, Naissance de la civilisation en Gr&amp;ce, Paris, 1963, Vol. I, Nos. 96-7). FIG. 43. Bone tools. I. Bone pin. House E VII, 12, burial. 2. Bone pin. House E VII, 12, burial. 3. Bone pin.

These items of male apparel have no match in woman's clothing which was occasionally found fastened with a bone pin (Fig. 43: 1-4) at the shoulder. Cosmetic spatulae (Fig. 43:5-6), a fork (Fig. 43:7) and bodkins (Fig. 43 : 8-11) are frequently discovered in women's graves, and where a child is buried with the mother, bone ladles (Fig. 43: 13) or spatulae (Fig. 43 : 14-16) are common gifts. Scoops and oval bowls made of bone or antler (P1. XVIIIc, d) are by no means rare, but they are seldom well preserved. Although most common in Level VI, they remained in use until Level II. Finally we must mention a fine fish-hook from Level IX (Fig. 43 : 12), the only one so far. The bonework from Qatal Huiyiuk is often very well made but rarely decorated and most of the pieces discussed are for use rather than for show. The cosmetic utensils, however, are carved with little hands, or are incised, but the finest piece of bone carving is the handle of a ceremonial dagger (Fig. 46) from the male burial in House 29 in Level VI A. This shows a coiled snake with two well-marked eyes and a body covered with fine pointill6 incision. Bone was further used for the manufacture of beads and pendants and knuckle-bones of sheep and goat (found in all levels), highly polished with use, show the immense antiquity of the game of apzk. THE 9ATAL HoYUK STONE INDUSTRY The outstanding feature of the chipped stone industry of 9atal Huiyuik is the predominant use of black obsidian for nearly all weapons and tools. This suggests a firm control over the sources of obsidian-Karaca Dag, Hasan Dag, and its neighbours in the Melendiz Mountains and the fields round Acigol. Flint, unknown in the area, but probably imported either from south of the Taurus or from the Elmah plain in the west, was used also, but for certain tools and weapons only, and on a much more restricted scale. A characteristic of this Early Neolithic industry is the great preponderance of weapons and tools necessary for the hunt. The spear-lance and arrowheads are mostly covered with pressure-flaking, more often on both sides than on one only. Most of these obsidian weapons are exceedingly handsome and so are the pressure- flaked flint daggers. Moreover, their great size (up to 18 cm.) suggests no lack of raw material as well as exceedingly fine craftsmanship. That they were greatly prized is clear from the hoards in which they are frequently found, as well as from the fact that they were regarded as choice offerings to the gods and are always found with the more opulent dead. At Qatal Huiytik tools and weapons occur in the following places : (a) As offerings in shrines (e.g. E VI, 14 and 17, E VI, Io, E VI, 61, E VI, 3', E VI, 8 and 9), usually in large quantities, and often unused. (b) In hoards below the floor-in the south-east corner of the building near the hearth-probably in bags (e.g. E VII, 8, E VI, I, E V, 7, A III, I, B II, I and 2). They may at times represent " capital ". (c) On the floors of buildings-often broken or used and left as they were at the time of the fire or abandonment of a building. (d) Buried with the dead below the platforms of the houses and shrines. Often unused and spectacular weapons (e.g. E VI, 20, E VII, I2, E VI, 29). The spectacular nature of the hunting equipment (which includes fine knives and scrapers, some of enormous size) has perhaps somewhat obscured the significance</page><page sequence="97">104 ANATOLIAN STUDIES FIG. 46.

This may be because the area excavated is entirely ritual or residential. Evidence for stone chipping was found in not a single of the 200 houses excavated and craftsmen evidently plied their trades in a different part of the mound. After three seasons of excavation only one sickle has been found (and that in a shrine !), and sickle blades are rare. This in spite of extraordinarily rich evidence for developed agriculture. Only one single hoard (E VII, 8) did not mainly consist of weapons, but represented craftsman's tools. It was discovered in a shrine and probably represents an offering. We have numerous wooden bowls and boxes which shows that sophisticated woodcarving was practised, but apart from the ubiquitous greenstone adzes and axes, few woodworkers' tools have been identified. Bead-carving was one of the major crafts at Qatal Hiyik, but the tools required are so far missing. The only common tools-found in each obsidian hoard-are fabricators, usually of flint, and a variety of simple parallel-sided blades, knives and scrapers. Apart from these typical weapons and tools, there are a number of others made on blades and flakes (and sometimes on broken weapons)-again all in obsidian. It is clear that the best material was not used for these, but was reserved for the production of weapons, and most of them are therefore small, though not necessarily microlithic, in size. The most striking feature about them is that they are "atypical ", that is not standardized into certain and constant shapes. They are unspectacular, but nevertheless they occur from Level II to Level X with such frequency (as well as in hoards and graves) that they are evidently of importance if we are to obtain a balanced view of the tools used by neolithic man at Qatal Haiytk. They include numerous tools for piercing, cutting, gouging, scraping and evidently represent the tools of leatherworkers, woodcarvers and beadworkers, and probably others. They even include a number of tools that can be classified as microliths. This situation at Qatal Htiyiik (most evident in Levels VII-X, but present throughout its occupation) is analogous to other chipped stone assemblages, e.g. PPNA Jericho, or preceramic Greece and the Balkans. All produce " atypical " assemblages, but the difference at Qatal Huiyiik lies in the fact that it is accompanied here by a first-rate hunting-equipment. Not less intriguing is the fact that many of these simpler tools made on blades and flakes perpetuate (or seem to perpetuate) an earlier tradition-which is not that of the " Mesolithic " with articulate geometric microliths, but the earlier element, invariably present beside them which derives from the Upper Palaeolithic. A Microlithic Hoard from Level II A small hoard of minute tools and flakes was found near a hearth on the floor of a small room, just south-west of the main shrine (A II, I) described in the previous report. The most characteristic pieces are illustrated in Fig. 47 and all are in obsidian. Most of them are segments of blades (Fig. 47: 1-25, 27, 28, 32-9), the rest are made on flakes. The blade segments cut into various geometric shapes and lightly retouched make miniature scrapers (nos. 1-28) or borers (nos. 29-38) where- as the microburins (nos. 39-45) were evidently used for engraving or cutting. All must have been fitted into handles, for they are almost too small to have been used by themselves. There is no evidence to show that they were part of composite tools; normal-sized tools are abundant (Fig. 48) and one can only imagine that they were precision tools for some craftsman.

Microliths of obsidian from hoard in Level II.</page><page sequence="102">EXCAVATIONS AT QATAL HUYUK, 1963 107 This is the only group of microliths found so far at Qatal Huiytik, but there are some isolated examples in Levels II and III. None resemble the more normal microlithic assemblages of the Mesolithic period and their date, late in the Early Neolithic sequence, as well as the fact that they form a minute and rare fraction of the normal macrolithic industry, quite clearly shows that they are exceptional. Whether they are some specialist's equipment or that of a " foreigner " to the community at Qatal Huiyok is a question that cannot be answered but they show that such shapes by themselves are no criterion of date and that the development of the stone industry at Qatal Huiyiik is not perhaps as simple as is suggested by the larger tools or the spectacular weapons. At the later site of Hacilar, the chipped stone industry shows smaller types than were current at Qatal Huiyuik, and there again, in Level VI, a number of microliths appear, although of different shapes altogether. Blade Tools of Levels II and III (Figs. 48 and 49) The obsidian tools illustrated in Fig. 48 are here shown to supplement the picture presented by Perry A. Bialor's report in AS. XII (1962), which dealt almost entirely with hunting equipment. There is little here that is spectacular among the tools (the showy pieces are nearly all weapons), but it is these simple blade-tools that still form the bulk of the industry and served their purpose in everyday life. Most are less than 6 cm. in length and though they are in general broader than the blades of Hacilar they show a link with this culture, which had shed the more exotic hunting equipment so characteristic of Qatal Htiyuik. Types are far from numerous in Level II; there are points with or without retouch (Fig. 48: 1-8), numerous blade sections (ibid. 9-13) with or without retouch and possible sickle- blades; blades with notches for hafting or scraping (ibid. 15, 19, 21-3, 25, 26) or with heavy wear (ibid. 17-20, 24, 26), with a notched top (ibid. 27, 28, 30) or with a plane-like end (ibid. 31-3) or a point for boring or piercing (ibid. 29, 34-5). And finally there are a few fine end scrapers (ibid. 14, 36-7) and a double burin (ibid. 16). The tools of Level III show even less variety (Fig. 49). A microlithic element (Fig. 49: i-8, 12-17) may be compared to that of Level II (Fig. 47) and includes backed or simple blades (Fig. 49 : 1-8), retouched blade segments (Fig. 49 : 12-17) or microburins (Fig. 49: 7-8) on flakes. Most of the more normal-sized blades could have been sickle elements (Fig. 49: I8, 20-9, 34-8), others (Fig. 49 : 9-11) are simple knife-blades, borers (Fig. 49 : 19, 33, 40, 43), possible scrapers (Fig. 49 : 41-2) or burins (Fig. 49 : 31-2, 39, 44). There appear to be no notable differences between the tools of these layers, just as there are few in the hunting kit. Nor are there any obvious changes since Level IV, with the exception that a microlithic element has not yet been recognized in IV or earlier levels. An Obsidian Hoard from Level VII (Fig. 50) In the south-east corner of the Vulture Shrine (E VII, 8) a small hoard of about fifty obsidian tools was found below the floor, probably a votive deposit or an offering. All the objects were of obsidian and nearly all were tools, or reused broken weapons (Fig. 50 : 32). (In fact the armament of the period is quite different with weapons of the same type as those of Levels VI A and B (Fig. 52 : 21-5).) All these tools are of small size and they include a number of notched blades and flakes for scraping (nos. i-5), two gouges, one combined with burin and scraper (nos. 6 and 7), a few borers or piercers (nos. 8, 9, 13, 14) on flakes or on blades</page><page sequence="103">108 ANATOLIAN STUDIES 21 7- 2.6 7 314 0 5 4 6 37 FIG. 48.

Then there are a fair number of burins, mainly of the transverse type (Fig. 36; nos. I2, 13, 17-22) or angle burins (nos. 9-11) ; points of types (nos. I6, 23), heavily retouched blades with ends blunted by use (as fabricators, punches ?), nos. 27-31. No. 32 is a broken lance head, nos. 33-9 blades of various sorts with or without retouch or backing. And finally there is a fine series of scrapers of various types (nos. 40-9) : ovoid, fan, thumbnail, end, steep, side and core scrapers all being present. Unfortunately very little is known about the use of each of these tools, but one is tempted to regard this hoard as some craftsman's tool kit. Tools and Weapons from Levels VIII-X (Figs. 51-2) A selection of the main types in the stone industry of the lower levels is given here for comparison with the later material. Moreover in the first report on the stone industry nothing earlier than Level VII was illustrated (and what was called Level VIII there is now VII). Although the bulk of the material is made in obsidian, flint and chert is more common in the lower (VI A-X) than in the upper (V-I) levels. Pressure flaking, nearly always bifacial (in both materials), is likewise more widespread and better done in the lower levels, but it is mainly found on the weapons (Fig. 52). The tools, or rather such as we have, show a greater use of waste flakes than is common in later layers, and therefore less regularity in types (Fig. 51, especially top three rows). There are points on flakes (Fig. 51 : I, 3-5), scrapers and borers on flakes (ibid. 6-14), possible burins (ibid. 2, 15) and strange forms (ibid. I6-19) of scrapers (?), possibly reminiscent of the mesolithic T- and Y-shaped tools of Beldibi, which are mentioned in the report (Anatolia IV, I959) but not illustrated. A group of burins, angle, axial and transversal is shown in Fig. 51 : 20-25. There are two microlithic round scrapers (ibid. 26-27) but more or less rectangular side and end scrapers are more common (ibid. 28-31). There also are core scrapers (ibid. 34, 36) and atypical examples (ibid. 32-33). All these are made of obsidian, but flint/chert is also in use (Fig. 51 : 35-43). Most of the latter tools are heavily retouched scrapers on flakes, trihedral rods (nos. 37-38) or blades (nos. 39-43). Nos. 39-40 may have been used as fabricators. Finally two long obsidian blades (nos. 44-45) are shown to remind one that simple blades are still common. The weapons found in Levels VII-X are of familiar types. Flint daggers, ground thin and pressure flaked on one side (Fig. 52 : 16, from Level VIII with chalk pommel), begin to appear in Level VIII and last to the end of VI A. Rather coarsely made obsidian spearheads (Fig. 52 : 9) alternate with the bifacially pressure-flaked types from Level IX onwards and remain in use till the end of Level VI A. But most prominent are the fine obsidian arrow- and lance-heads (Fig. 52 passim) which now include a type with marked shoulders (ibid. I, 2, 8, I5, 21). Most of the arrowheads are tanged, but untanged ones start appearing since Level IX (Fig. 52 : I4). All projectile points are pressure flaked on both sides and with one exception (Fig. 52 : 3), which is of chert, obsidian is the material used. The quality of the flaking is excellent, and the sophistication of these points suggests a long tradition previous to Level X, which we may roughly date to c. 6500 B.c. The origin of the tradition is still shrouded in mystery. NEOLITHIC USE OF METAL The neolithic inhabitants of qatal Htiyiik were familiar with the use of two metals, copper and lead, at least as early as building-level IX, i.e. soon after 65o00 B.c. The material consists of lead beads (P1. XXVa) and pendants, especially</page><page sequence="107">112 ANATOLIAN STUDIES 2 3 ---s K 10 16118 19 S144 6 227 3) 33 Z34 , : 4 36 eMs. 44 45 FIG. 51.

Beads of both metals occur as early as Level IX. So far no tools of copper have been found, but it is possible that simple tools, such as drills or awls, were already in existence and were used for the manufacture of fine stone beads, etc. One would expect to find such tools in the artisan area, and not with the burials of the rich from which our finds of metal are derived. Contrary to expectation, these trinkets of metal are by no means rare, but their state of preservation is precarious. The analysis 1 of some fragments has confirmed that the beads were made of native copper hammered into sheet metal, cut into strips and rolled into beads, perhaps with the aid of heat application. On the other hand, a supposed lump of copper ore from House E VI A, I proved to be not ore, but copper slag, suggesting that the process of smelting may already have been known, by the middle of the 7th millennium, but further analyses are required to establish how usual this was. In this respect it may be worth mentioning that lignite (a low-grade coal) was known to these people and was used for the manufacture of beads and pendants and one wonders whether its usefulness as a fuel has already been discovered. Again such confirmation could possibly come from the workshop area. The discovery of metal ores or native copper at this early date in Anatolia is perhaps not so surprising. The traders and prospectors of Qatal Huiyuik roamed far and wide in their search for raw materials, colourful stones, fossils, concretions, etc., and the brilliantly coloured copper ores-a bright blue azurite and the green malachite (?) which ground up into a powder were used in the burial rites in Levels VI and VII-as well as the fine red and heavy native copper, are materials (like lead (galena), haematite, cinnabar, apatite, etc.) conspicuous by their colour and weight, sought after and highly prized. Most of these materials were probably available within the crescent of the Taurus Mountains that forms the southern boundary of the Konya Plain. The nearest known copper mines to Qatal Htiytik lie at Tris Maden near Bozkir. Lead in the form of galena is abundant in the region of the Cilician gates at the eastern end of the plain, cinnabar occurs at Sizma north of Konya, all within a few days' travel from the city, and there is plenty of evidence that many other materials were obtained from much further afield. In any case the use of copper and lead in neolithic Qatal Huiytik, however restricted in extent, is now a fact and the artificial division between a neolithic (without metal) and an Early Chalcolithic (with the first use of copper) period becomes unreasonable. In fact, more metal artifacts have been found at Qatal Hiiyuik than in later Hacilar ! The terminology is evidently in need of revision as far as Southern Anatolia is concerned, but to revise it at this moment would be somewhat premature. CHRONOLOGY The relative chronology of the successive settlements at qatal Huiyik is illustrated in a table, which also shows the time-range of most of the characteristic features of the culture. With radiocarbon determinations of samples from (atal Huiyik Levels X-II now in progress at the University Museum, Pennsylvania, it would be premature See now H. Neuninger, R. Pittioni, W.

No virgin soil has yet been reached and at the other end of the time-scale, Levels I and O still need more intensive investigation. There are good grounds for assuming that after the destruc- tion by fire of Level O on top of the mound, the position of the settlement was shifted to the other side of the river (Qatal Hayutk West) where the new site continues the occupation of ?Qatal Hityiik during the entire following 6th millennium B.c. It is this latter site which is probably roughly contemporary with Hacilar IX-I (6th millennium). The seven building-levels of the earlier Aceramic village of Hacilar (a radiocarbon date of 6750 B.c. ? I8o was obtained from Aceramic level 5 by the British Museum Laboratory (BM 127), i.e. 7040 B.c. if recalculated with the 5730 half-life) probably equate roughly with natal Htiytik's aceramic deposits. On the basis of the pottery Qatal Hiiyiik X-IX shows clear links with the top of Level B at Bealdibi, which implies that the underlying Mesolithic levels are probably roughly contemporary with the deposits in the sounding at 4atal Haytik below Level X, even if these two cultures appear to have so far very little in common.

At first sight then, the radiocarbon dates from these two sites confirm the seniority of Qatal Huiyuik, which has already been established by the archaeological record. Only in the top layers of Qatal Hiiyuik (II-O) were features found that are also characteristic of Late Neolithic Hacilar (IX-VI) and the possibility of an overlap is strengthened by the new Pennsylvania dates. Whereas the lower part of the sequence of dates for 9atal Hiiyuik from Levels VI A-X is quite consistent, the upper part (Levels II-V) is not. The reasons for this are fairly obvious, for the later settlements covered only part of the west slope, leaving the earlier building levels lower on the slope exposed to depredators in search of timber and charcoal. The date obtained for Level IV almost certainly points to the re-use of old timber, and the sample for Level IV formed part of the core of a large tree, evidently of considerable age. For dating the level concerned it is therefore of no value and in the chronological table such dates have been placed in brackets. In contrast to dates obtained from wood the grain dates should give greater precision in dating the end of Levels II and VI A, but the well established stratigraphy shows that they cannot be contemporary. With a tolerance of - 79 the end of Level II can be dated to c. 5720 and that of VI A to c. 5880, i.e. c. I6o years for Levels V-II. If the great conflagration at the end of Level VI A took place according to the grain dates around 5880 (or 5890 if we combine P-769 and P-778), eighty to ninety years would have intervened between the great fire of Level VI A and the building of the Hunting Shrine in Level III (5807 ? 94) c. 5800-5790. Neither Level IV nor Level V were of long duration judging by the number of plaster layers in these levels (c. fifty in V, forty or less in IV) and this would roughly agree with the radiocarbon dates. None of the buildings so far</page><page sequence="112">EXCAVATIONS AT QATAL HiUYQK, 1963 17 excavated in Levels III and II shows signs of prolonged occupation: forty layers of plaster is the maximum in Level III (Hunting Shrine) and fifty to sixty in Level II. These two levels may have lasted about a century together, perhaps from c. 5790 to 5700 B.c. This would-on the evidence of radiocarbon dates-provide a certain contemporaneity between Hacilar Level IX (beginning c. 5700 B.c.) and (atal Haiyk O-I, which is confirmed by the resemblances in the clay statuettes, some of the pottery, part of the stone industry and the lack of wall-paintings. Where tested at Hacilar, Level VII was an earlier phase of VI and the ephemeral structures of Levels VIII and IX give no grounds for suggesting that they spanned a long range of time. The earliest occupation of Late Neolithic Hacilar (IX-VIII) need not precede that of Qatal HUiyk I, i.e. c. 5700 B.C. If we use the tolerance for the Level IX sample 5614 + 92 a date of 5706 is obtained. The correlation of the two sites and the possibilities of an overlap between Qatal Hayuik I-O and Hacilar IX-VIII must be considered. It should, however, be borne in mind that this dating and the correlation of the two sites is based on very little evidence and a new sequence of radiocarbon dates, preferably obtained from materials other than wood (which can be and certainly was re-used) may con- ceivably alter the picture in the near future. The chronology here suggested is provisional and subject to further confirmation. We must now return to the radiocarbon dates for the lower levels, VI A-X, where we are treading on safer ground, for not only is the sequence consistent, but we have more than one date (at least in the crucial Levels VI A and B) on which to rely. There are four dates for Level VI A ranging from 5781 to 5850 B.C., ? 94, or 5950 and 5880 for the building and the destruction of this level respectively. These dates would give Level VI A a time span of about seventy years which corresponds to the 6o + x layers of plaster counted on the walls of numerous buildings of VI A. This suggests that buildings were replastered once a year, probably in the spring after the rains were over (and in time for the great spring festival). If we could only be certain of this, then an independent method of dating by number of layers of plaster can be applied to gatal Hiytik (corresponding to tree ring dating) and the approximate length of each building-level can be determined. The radiocarbon dates so far obtained lend strong support to a replastering once a year as well as to the gradually decreasing length of individual building-levels after Level VI B, probably as the result of frequent fires (all building-levels from VI A upwards were destroyed by fire). In the area excavated (west slope) the lower building-levels from VI B down to X were unburnt and houses and shrines, covered with very thick layers of plaster, show all the signs of prolonged occupation. This is reflected in the radiocarbon dates which allow 6oo to 700 years for the six building-levels VI A-X. In contrast, the six last levels (V-O) we have argued, need not have lasted more than 300 years, or about half the length of the lower levels. The dates for Level VI B suggest a beginning c. 6oo000 or 5950, which using the tolerance can be raised to c. 6050-6070, and with its end determined by the beginning of VI A at 5950, it lasted from a century to a century and a quarter. This agrees with a plaster count varying between I00oo to I20 layers. The date of 6200 for the oak roof beams of Shrine A VI B, I is evidently too high and is probably due to the re-use of old timber, perhaps from a building in Level VII (?). Not a single piece of timber was found in buildings of Levels VII and VIII, so that no dates are available for these levels (the grain from House E VII, 24, P-778, is probably intrusive from a Level VI A building above).</page><page sequence="113">118 ANATOLIAN STUDIES Radiocarbon dates obtained from charcoal (fuel) in Levels IX and X are apparently inconsistent until it is remembered that with a tolerance of ori-2 years they can be reversed. As hearth fuel they do not date the beginning, i.e. the construction of the buildings in which they are found. The average of these two dates is 6435 ? 99, which suggests that the beginning of Level X may be pro- visionally dated to c. 6500oo ? 10 oo B.C. The deep deposits in the sounding below Level X have not yet been sampled for radiocarbon analysis but we may con- fidently assume that they carry the sequence back into the earlier seventh, if not into the eighth millennium B.c. Summing up we can now say that the sequence of thirteen radiocarbon dates has established a rough skeleton for the chronology of Qatal Hhyaik. It is hoped that future seasons may clothe this skeleton with chronological flesh, especially for Levels V-O and VII-X. It lowers our guess-dates by about 5oo years and covers the span between 65oo and 5700 B.c., whereas our previous estimates, based on a high initial date for Hacilar of c. 6ooo B.C., had suggested the millennium between 7ooo and 6000 B.C., but the time-span-twelve building-levels in a thousand years- remains unchanged. It illustrates two further points: the unreliability of single dates and the need for stratigraphic sequences from carefully excavated sites, and the virtual impossibility of establishing a safe chronology without the help of radio- carbon dating when dealing with such remote periods. A critical use of carbon- dating can only benefit archaeology and seems preferable to the old method of subjective guessing at dates which in comparison resembles an outmoded and fruitless groping in the dark.</page><page sequence="114">EXCAVATIONS AT QATAL HUYQK, 1963 119 CHRONOLOGICAL TABLE Radiocarbon dates in heavy type. --* extreme tolerance.
