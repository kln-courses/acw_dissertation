<plain_text><page sequence="1">Zeit und Heimat der homerischen Epen. By Heinrich Ruiter; pp. 293. Berlin: de Gruyter, 1937. 4.80M. The author has already published German translations of his Ur-Ilias and Ur-Odysseel and in the present volume maintains and defends the views there expressed. The book is colored throughout with excessive admiration for D6rp- feld, whose theories are accepted without reser- vation. Ruiter believes that 'Kerngedichte' con- taining the wrath of Achilles and the homecoming of Odysseus were composed by Achaean bards on the mainland of Greece in the twelfth century (267; cf. 136); Homer changed and expanded the poems in the ninth century, but the original unity of the epics was lost in this process of reworking (5). Riiter examines the Iliad and the Odyssey in the light of modern archaeological research, especially the topography and geogra- phy described in the poems; he discusses the social life and the religious conceptions-and all prove for him the existence of the twelfth cen- tury original poems. Even the linguistic evidence he finds conclusive, for he accepts Mahlow's theory that there are no Aeolic forms in Homer: 'Die Sprache der Epen . . . ist kein kuinstliches Gemisch mehr von Dialekten, keine vom Dichter erfundene Kunstsprache sondern ursprtinglich ein urgriechischer Dialekt' (115). The arguments are not convincing. For ex- ample, Ruiter finds that the topography of Troy fits the descriptions in the Iliad, with the excep- tion of passages in Books VII and XII, and these passages he considers 'spate Eindichtung eines neuionischen Sangers' (23; cf. 28). However, many of the Homeric references which he be- lieves agree with the results of modern excava- tions come from books which do not belong to his Ur-Ilias. He explains this by saying: 'das einmal geschaffene Bild der Stadt auch ftir die Zu- und Umdichtung spiiterer Zeiten massgebend blieb' (20). Thus the so-called later additions can be both inconsistent and consistent with the narrative of the original epic; such reasoning makes it difficult to accept the author's belief that certain books must be late, while others have come down in their present form from the twelfth century. The author's treatment of the Homeric deities is equally questionable. He believes that in the original epics the gods were omniscient and omnipotent and all passages in which human weaknesses are ascribed to them, such as fear, anger, hatred, are later (243 f.). Of the quarrel of Zeus and Hera (Il. 1.533-611) he says: 'Wie k6nnte der Dichter des Zornliedes solche Bilder im Kopfe getragen haben! Es sind scherzhafte Darstellungen eines Nachdichters' (235). On the same basis Ruter rejects the assemblies in Iv and VIII, the beguiling of Zeus by Hera in XIV and many other scenes. But he fails to give any treal evidence for the assumption that the anthropomorphism of the twelfth century differed so strikingly from that of the ninth.2 Ruter's work, nevertheless, is not without value for students of Homer; his classification of Homeric passages is useful; he summarizes a great mass of historical and archaeological ma- terial and displays a wide knowledge of Homeric scholarship. Unfortunately there is no indication in the book that the epics in their present form 1 Homers Odyssee nach Dorpfelds Tageplan des urspriinglichen Epos von der Heimkehr des Odysseus (Vol. II of Dorpfeld's Homers Odyssee.

Although there is no doubt that back of the Iliad and Odyssey there was a long development of epic poetry, it does not necessarily follow that twelfth century poems had greater unity than that which exists in the epics as we have them. Furthermore, the fact that twelfth century conditions are so accu- rately reflected in the Homeric poems is no proof that large parts of the extant epics were com- posed at that time, and thus Rtiter's material fails to support his main hypothesis.
