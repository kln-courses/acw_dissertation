Preference is given to articles that are deemed to be of general theoretical sig- nificance or of broad interest across spe- cialties of psychology and related fields, and that are written to be intelligible to a wide range of readers. Types of Articles Published General Articles. General Articles, ranging up to 5,000 words, may (1) give perspectives on problems, issues, or new developments pertaining to psychology in public affairs, government, or envi- ronmental or social problems of broad concern; (2) review new developments in one field of research that would be of interest to readers in other fields; (3) present a tutorial or critical review of lit- erature on a research problem or re- search method. A General Article may include a summary of 50 to 100 words in lieu of an abstract; normally the refer- ence list should not exceed 50 items; and figures and tables should occupy no more than a printed page. Research Articles. Research Arti- cles (up to 4,000 words) may present new theory, new data, new methods, or any combination of these. They must be writ- ten to be intelligible to a relatively broad readership. Psychological Science does not normally provide for the primary publication of extensive empirical stud- ies with the full presentation of methods and data that is standard for the more specialized research journals. Broad theoretical significance and interdiscipli- nary interest are major criteria for accep- tance. A Research Article should include an abstract of no more than 150 words and normally a maximum of 40 items in the reference list. Research Reports. Short reports of up to 2,500 words are expected to present new research findings and will be favored if they present innovations in ap- proach or method. The report should in- clude an abstract of no more than 100 words and a reference list normally not exceeding 30 items; figures and tables to- gether should occupy no more than one printed page. Commentaries and Letters. Com- mentaries (up to 1,000 words) or Letters (up to 500 words) may discuss problems of general interest to psychological and social scientists or may criticize or sup- plement articles or reports previously published in Psychological Science. For the format of Letters, consult examples in previous issues of the journal. Preparation and Submission of Manuscripts Manuscripts should be addressed to the Editor, W.K. Estes, Department of Psychology, Harvard University, 33 Kirkland Street, Cambridge, MA 02138. A manuscript should be submitted in quadruplicate together with a letter of transmittal giving the name and tele- phone number of the author to whom communication about the .manuscript should be addressed. A manuscript should be accompanied by a statement that the material has not been published and is not under consideration for publi- cation elsewhere. It will be presumed that all listed authors of a manuscript have agreed to the listing and have seen and approved the manuscript. The letter of transmittal may include the names, addresses, telephone numbers, and re- search specialties of four to six persons outside the author's institution who are qualified to referee the paper. An effort is always made to obtain at least one ref- eree from the author's list. The style of the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Associa- tion, 3rd edition, should be followed with respect to handling of references, foot- notes, headings, tables and figures, and abbreviations and symbols. Figures should be camera ready. Graphs should be drawn to occupy a standard area of SV2 by 11 inches. Photographs should be glossy prints, mounted on 8V2-by-l 1-inch paper. Permission from the copyright owner should be included for use of any figure previously published elsewhere. In Research Articles and Research Re- ports, descriptions of methods and re- sults should be prepared with special at- tention to readability. The gist of the methods should be given in the text of the article at the level of detail typical of a paper given at a meeting; additional de- tails deemed essential for completeness may be given in an appendix. Presenta- tion of results should be organized simi- larly. Investigations on human subjects must include a statement indicating that informed consent was obtained and that rights of the subjects were protected, and investigations on experimental ani- mals must indicate that their care was in accord with institutional guidelines. The title page of the manuscript must contain the mailing address, phone number, and, if convenient, e-mail address of the au- thor to whom communications about the manuscript should be directed. Review and Selection of Manuscripts General Articles, and on occasion Re- search Articles and Technical Com- ments, are often solicited by the Editor, but unsolicited manuscripts are wel- come. Proposals for book reviews may be sent to the Editor or the Feature Re- view Editor. On receipt, a manuscript is appraised by the Editor or a member of the Edito- rial Board for its conformity to the over- all guidelines and preferences of the jour- nal, and those judged to be unsuitable or likely not to be competitive for limited publication space are returned to the au- thor, normally within 2 weeks. Manu- scripts that pass this initial screening are reviewed by outside referees and the au- thor notified of acceptance, rejection, or need for revision, usually within 4 to 10 weeks. Every effort is made to provide short turnaround, especially for Re- search Reports, Commentaries, and Let- ters. Rejected manuscripts cannot be re- considered unless resubmission follow- ing revision has been invited by the Editor. Accepted papers are edited to im- prove readability and effectiveness of communication. When editing is exten- sive or when the author's meaning is not clear, the manuscript may be returned to the author for review and retyping before the article goes to press. Revised manu- scripts should be submitted in duplicate.</page><page sequence="4">IzUJJiUkliaWTWTfffflJ'J.liil^liilll'JIilJIJ!
