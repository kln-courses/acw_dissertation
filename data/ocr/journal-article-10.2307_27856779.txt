<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Origins of the Constellations Some provocative hypotheses link the origins of the constellations to the precession of the earth's axis and the symbolic imagery of ancient peoples Alexander A. Gurshtein Most of us are familiar with the picturesque images associated with the starry patterns in the night sky: Leo is the great lion, Gemini represents a pair of twins, Taurus is the raging bull and Orion is the mighty hunter. But are the constellations merely pictures? Did ancient peoples place these images in the sky merely for some form of spiritual comfort? Or did the constellations perform a more down-to-earth function for the early skygazers as well? An ancient star atlas that could provide an answer to these questions has yet to be discov ered. Images of the stars, the moon and the sun do adorn rock walls in many parts of the world, but there are no maps of the constella tions. Yet this does not mean that prehistoric 264 American Scientist, Volume 85</page><page sequence="2">Figure 1.

The absence of hard rock evidence might discourage some investi gators from pursuing the subject altogether, but I believe it is a healthy exercise to stretch our imaginations and use reason and the archeological context to come up with some plausible hypotheses. By this route perhaps we can enjoy an adventure into the past and into the minds of ancient peoples. We know, for example, that the annual movement of the stars across the sky provided a calendar by which ancient hunters and farm ers could predict the change of the seasons. Their survival would have depended on knowing when to plant, when to harvest and when the herds would migrate. The ability to recognize star patterns would have provided some simple mnemonics for seasonal change. Thus we might expect that stories incorporat ing Western mythology, symbology and even numerology could hold some clues. In this regard, the general tendency of his torical cultural transmission to retain names through the generations is useful. This seems to be true of the constellations also, which have held their names with a tenacity comparable to that of place-names on the earth (such as landmarks and bodies of water).

Earth's orbital motion around the sun produces the illusion that the sun moves relative to the background of the stars in the course of a year. The apparent path of the sun through sky, known as the ecliptic, passes through the 12 zodiacal constellations. Ancient peoples would have recognized that the sun was passing through certain zodiacal constellations during four special times of the year: the ver nal and autumnal equinoxes and the summer and winter solstices. Here the ap proximate dates of these four special events are plotted along earth's orbit relative to the sun and the zodiacal constellations as they occur in the modern era. The four constellations?Pisces, Gemini, Virgo and Sagittarius?constitute a zodiacal quartet. diacal constellations. (Several Christian au thors, including Gregory of Tours, tried to ap ply the names of the 12 Apostles.) Yet despite all the social and cultural changes over the mil lennia, the names of the constellations have re mained inviolable. The constancy of these des ignations is clearly significant. So where do we begin? Modern astronomers recognize 88 constellations in the northern and southern skies, all of which have precise boundaries?they are not merely star patterns. Nearly half of these constellations were recog nized only after the time of the Alexandrian astronomer Ptolemy, of the second century A.D. The origins of these modern constellations are documented and will not concern us here. Of those constellations known to Ptolemy, the old est complete list goes back to about 275 B.c. in the Greek didactic poem The Phaenomena by Aratus. In this poem, Aratus refers to 48 con stellations, all of which we recognize today ex cept for the Pleiades and the Bow, which are now part of other constellations. Most of the Aratus constellations are visible to observers at midnorthern latitudes, and it is the history of these constellations?which comprise the modern zodiac, all of the northern sky and much of the southern sky?that will be the subject of this discussion. Zodiacal Quartets The sun, the moon and the planets appear to move across the sky relative to the stars along a path known as the ecliptic, a route for eclipses and the track of the sun (via solis in Latin). Thir teen constellations are located along the eclip tic, but only 12 are historically considered to be part of the zodiac. (The giant Ophiucus is the outcast.) The history of these 12 constella tions is deeply entangled with the 12 signs of the astrologer's zodiac, but many of the ecliptic constellations antedate the astrologer's craft. Each of the 12 astrological signs extends equally (30 degrees) along the ecliptic to com plete the 360 degrees of the zodiacal circle. The oldest known cuneiform texts with 12 equal zodiacal signs date to the 5th century B.c. (van der Waerden 1974), suggesting that the tradi tional zodiac was established by this time. Ear lier records, however, reveal that the signs were not always evenly spaced: Babylonian texts dating to 700 B.c. (such as the mulAPIN series) contain not equal signs but irregular zo diacal constellations. This discrepancy is a clue that the constellations of the ecliptic may not have been originally conceived as a complete 12-part system. Indeed, some of the zodiacal constellations we know of today were absent at this time. Why would ancient peoples care to identify certain star patterns along the ecliptic before others? Are the zodiacal constellations merely fanciful images, or do they represent some thing else? If the constellations had been de signed simply as pictures?noteworthy groups of stars?they should consist of bright stars with easily remembered configurations. Cer tainly there are such constellations: The bright stars of Ursa Major and Orion are glittering ex amples. But the compositions of many other constellations provide contrary instances: Pisces and Aquarius, which are among the largest constellations, contain no bright stars at all. The historical existence of these dim and unremarkable star patterns suggests that some of the constellations performed some other role?and this may be a clue to their origins. One of the most obvious observations one can make of the star patterns in the night sky is that they change regularly with the four sea sons. Zodiacal constellations that are high in the winter night sky, for example, are lost in the glare of the daytime sky during the summer. Similarly, constellations that are high in the night sky during the spring are invisible during autumn.

Zodiacal quartets marking the position of the equinoxes and the solstices would have changed three times during the past 8,000 years due to the precessional motion of the earth's axis. The four special points on the ecliptic would have been marked by the Gemini quartet from 6500 b.c. to 4400 b.c., the Taurus quartet from 4400 b.c. to 2200 b.c. and the Aries quartet from 2200 b.c. to about 100 b.c. With the identification of the Aries quartet ancient peoples would have recognized that the 12 zodiacal constellations completed the ecliptic circle and that this number roughly corresponds to the number of lunar cycles (months) in a solar year.</page><page sequence="5">Figure 4. mulAPIN cuneiform tablets dating to the sev enth century b.c. of Babylon are among the oldest known astronomical texts that refer to the constellations in the ecliptic path. The ancient peoples of the Near East and Egypt appear to have played a central role in identifying the zodiacal constellations that we recog nize today. The mulAPIN tablets also list the stars of the Mesopotamian gods Enlil, Ea and Anu. This copy of the tablets dates to the 5th century b.c. (Photograph courtesy of E. C. Krupp, Griffith Observatory.) would notice that the sun's height above the horizon also varies with the seasons. And this is naturally related to the varying duration of daylight and darkness throughout the year. Systematic observations of the sky would have identified four special days of the year that are related to the movement of the sun: the day that the midday sun is highest over the horizon (the summer solstice), the day that the midday sun is lowest over the horizon (the winter solstice), the day after the winter solstice when the day and the night are of equal dura tion (the vernal equinox) and the day after the summer solstice when the day and the night are of equal duration (the autumnal equinox). Could the ancients have been able to deduce which four days of the year these were? Actu ally it is quite easily done with a vertical rod placed in the ground. The shortest midday shadow in the course of a year occurs when the sun is highest in the sky, marking the sum mer solstice. Likewise the longest midday shadow occurs on the day of the year when the sun is lowest in the sky, marking the winter solstice. The two equinox points could also be determined easily. A line drawn parallel to the rod's shadow at midday would mark the mid day line. The day that the sun rises at a point on the horizon that forms a line exactly per pendicular to the midday line, marks an equinox. There are two such days every year, one in the autumn and one in the spring. As the sun makes its annual passage along the ecliptic, early observers might have noticed that the four special days correspond to cer tain patterns of stars in the sky. In modern times, for example, the sun is passing through the constellation Pisces during the vernal equinox, through Gemini during the summer solstice, through Virgo during the autumnal equinox and through Sagittarius during the winter solstice. The reader can confirm this by noting which zodiacal constellations are high in the sky in the middle of the night on these four days: The sun will naturally be located in the zodiacal constellation that is on the oppo site side of the ecliptic circle. Several thousand years ago, however, a skygazer would not have found the four spe cial points on the ecliptic located in the con stellations where they now reside. This is be cause the earth "wobbles" as it spins on its axis, not unlike the gyrations of a spinning top. This precession of the earth's axis describes a complete circle in a period of about 26,000 years. One consequence of precession is that the positions of the equinox and solstice points move along the ecliptic. That is, the four dis tinct points shift westward along the zodiacal constellations. On average, one of these four points passes through a zodiacal constellation about every 2,140 years. Since the four points move as a rigid system through the ecliptic, the four constellations that mark the points constitute an integral quartet. For the present purposes it is useful to name these quartets after the constellation contain ing the vernal equinox. Thus the modern epoch corresponds to the Pisces quartet, which began about 100 b.c. and will end sometime af ter 2000 a.d. (when the so-called Aquarius era will begin?the true beginning of the "Age of Aquarius" in popular culture). The constella tions of the earlier quartets can be reconstruct ed by following the vernal equinox through successive constellations along the ecliptic. Be tween 2200 b.c. and 100 b.c. the vernal equinox was in Aries, from 4400 b.c. to 2200 b.c. it was in Taurus, and between 6500 b.c. and 4400 b.c. it was in the constellation Gemini. I propose that ancient peoples first recognized these quartets during their respective epochs and that the images that constitute the zodiac were first applied to the constellations at some time during these epochs. Since the movement of the equinox and sol stice points can be extrapolated farther back in history, the reader may wonder why I believe the zodiacal constellations owe their origins to epoch's since 6500 b.c. Who is to say that the Cancer quartet, which constituted the four spe cial points on the ecliptic during the 2,000-year epoch preceding about 6500 b.c., was not rec ognized by the people of that time? I shall ar gue that the symbolic images portrayed in the 268 American Scientist, Volume 85</page><page sequence="6">zodiacal constellations only make sense in terms of the three quartets and their epochs de scribed below. The Gemini Quartet The origin of the term zodiac?which is from the Greek zodiakos kyklos or "circle of ani mals"?remains unknown. As it is, five of the 12 zodiacal names are not animals: Four are anthropomorphic beings (Gemini the twins, Virgo the virgin, Sagittarius the centaur/archer and Aquarius the water carrier) and one is a tool (Libra the scales). The ancient symbolism attached to the 12 constellations hints at why certain images were chosen to represent the star patterns. Of the three epochs that immediately ante date the oldest known record of the zodiac, the Gemini quartet (from about 6500 B.c. to 4400 B.c.) stands out because it contains three of the four anthropomorphic constellations (Gemini, Virgo and Sagittarius), and thus constitutes a circle of human-like forms. Anthropomorphic images are relatively common among the arti facts of Neolithic (and older) peoples, so it seems appropriate that such images would be placed in the sky as well. What are we to make of the Gemini twins marking the vernal equinox? The image of the twins is a common symbol in ancient cultures, and its significance goes back to a general myth about the heavenly twin children of a supreme sun-god (Gamkrelidze and Ivanov 1984). Perhaps Gemini was seen as a pointer for new life, the springtime renewal of nature. Virgo, which corresponded to the summer solstice point during this epoch, may be a sym bol of summertime fertility. The constellation may be a direct descendant of the mother-god dess image that can be found throughout the Near East and Europe, and that was often rep resented in agricultural societies of the Ne olithic as a naked, pregnant woman or a woman giving birth. Indeed the earliest por trayals of the constellation show Virgo holding a spike of grain (hence the name Spica of its most prominent star). The autumnal constellation of the Gemini quartet is Sagittarius, the centaur with a bow in his hands. Sagittarius may reflect the symbolic movement of the sun: A hunter shoots and wounds the sun, which starts its descent into the "Lower World." In winter, the sun is lowest in the sky and appears to linger over the threshold of the Lower World, corresponding to Pisces, the fish es of the Gemini quartet. The cross-cultural link between winter and the concept of a Low er World has been elucidated by the 19th-cen tury British ethnographer E. B. Tyler and many others. Numerous rituals in various cultures indicate that water has long been considered to Figure 5. Assyrian sculptures of winged, human-headed bulls from the first millennium B.c. embody the symbols of the Taurus quartet. The legs are those of a bull (Taurus), the head is that of a human being (Aquarius) and the wings those of an eagle (which often replaced the scor pion in ancient astrological representations of Scorpius). Similar sculptures (not shown) often include the hind legs or body of a lion (Leo). The importance of the constellations of the Taurus quartet may have inspired these sculptures and the composite beasts of Ezekiel's vision in the Old Testament. 1997 May-June 269</page><page sequence="7">Figure 6. Egyptian zodiac from the ceiling of the temple of Hathor at Dendera (from the late Hellenistic period about 100 B.c.) shows all 12 zodiacal constellations (blue shade), the planets and other constellations (some of which are not recognized to day). The north celestial pole is approximately at the center of the ceiling, whereas the 12 signs of the zodiac follow a circle that corresponds to the ecliptic. The 12 zo diacal constellations were established centuries before this ceiling was made. The sky is supported by four standing figures, which are the goddesses of the cardinal points, and four pairs of kneeling falcon-headed deities. Blue shade has been added to the original photograph. (Photograph courtesy of the collection of Owen Gin gerich, Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.) be an element of the Lower World. The "Land of the Departed Souls," for example, is situated in the Far West, beneath a watery boundary. Similarly, the River Styx of the ancient Greeks was considered to be a basic element of the Lower World. Perhaps the waters of the Lower World had no anthropomorphic images when the quartet was created, and so a pair of fishes served the purpose. The Taurus and Aries Quartets As the fourth millennium b.c. approached, the precession of the earth's axis moved the four special points westward along the ecliptic out of the constellations of the Gemini quartet. How might the ancient observers have reacted to this change? It seems likely that the human tendency to retain cultural traditions would not have permitted the obliteration of the Gemini quartet, but it would have become nec essary to map new sectors of the ecliptic as places for the four special points. These sectors became the constellations of the Taurus quar tet: Taurus the bull, Leo the lion, Scorpius the scorpion and Aquarius the water carrier. In the third or fourth millennium b.c., when these images were first applied to the Taurus quartet, the sociocultural conditions of the an cient world had changed considerably in the 2,000 (or more) years since the Gemini quartet had been created. The former epoch saw some of the first urban societies, whereas the latter saw the development of religious institutions that were typically led by a priesthood that con trolled the cult, the economy and the rituals of the temples. Whereas Neolithic populations of ten possessed small clay statuettes of anthropo morphic images (hence the human-like forms of the Gemini quartet), the further development of agricultural civilizations led to the use of gold, silver and stone for the fabrication of idols in the form of animals rather than human be ings. This transition in popular imagery is con sistent with the use of animal figures for three of the four constellations of the Taurus quartet. The transfer from the worship of a mother goddess (female) image to a male image at this time may account for the use of a bull (signify ing masculine virility) as the symbol for the vernal equinox. (Incidentally, the bull imagery may also have established itself as the golden calf of the Old Testament.) The image of the lion also played a significant role as a symbol of supreme power, and this is consistent with its use for the constellation Leo, which marked the summer solstice, the sun's highest point on the ecliptic path, during this epoch. The image of a lion tearing at a bull is a common motif in ancient Eastern art, and it has been suggested that the fight between the lion and the bull had a sacred astronomical meaning, marking the calendrical transition from spring to summer (Hartner 1965). During the epoch of the Taurus quartet, the four special constellations did in deed comprise a circle of animals (or zodiac). Scorpius marks the autumnal equinox dur ing this epoch, and its use is consistent with the metaphor of the previous epoch in which Sagit tarius shoots and wounds the sun. In this in stance the scorpion stings the sun, which then begins its descent into the Lower World. Here again, a water-based image?Aquarius, the wa ter carrier?represents the winter solstice. A perusal of the oldest cuneiform texts of the Babylonians (the mulAPIN tablets) reveals that the names of the constellations in the Gemini and the Taurus quartets existed by about 700 b.c. This is not the case with some of the constellations of the next quartet, marked 270 American Scientist, Volume 85</page><page sequence="8">by the transition of the vernal equinox into Aries, the ram. The British writer Rupert Gleadow was among the first to observe that the ram was absent from the Babylonian sky of about 1000 B.c. Consistent with the absence of Aries is the absence of Cancer the crab (mark ing the summer solstice). Moreover, the Akka dian name for the star pattern in Libra (which marked the autumnal equinox) at this time means "horn of a scorpion" (referring to the claws of Scorpius), suggesting that Libra (as the image of the scales) may not have existed at this time, but was instead part of the con stellation Scorpius. Indeed the Egyptian priest Manetho of Alexandria (during the reign of the King Ptolemy I Soter) noted that Libra was separated from Scorpius to mark the autum nal equinox. The symbolism marking the transition from the Taurus to the Aries quartet is consistent once again with the sociocultural changes in the Near East. The Old Testament warned against the idols and cult statues of Near East ern temples at a time when monotheism was on the verge of predominating. Artistic images and parables had become widespread in the literature of the era, and it is in this context that the names of the Aries quartet are allegorical, rather than merely symbolic representations of deities. Certainly others have remarked that the epoch of Aries is associated with the bibli cal story of Moses coming down from Mount Sinai as "two horned," or crowned with the ram's horns, while his flock disobediently in sisted on dancing around the golden calf, a metaphor for Taurus as the bull (de Santillana and von Dechend 1969). We can also deduce the significance of the names in the Aries quartet in this era. The ram, for example, is strongly connected with ancient spring rituals. (In the second millennium B.c., the Hebrew patriarch Abraham changed the ritual sacrifice from that of a human being to a ram.) Cancer the crab, as the symbol of sum mer, can allegorically refer to the reversal of the sun's motion as it passes the highest point of the ecliptic. Even today the most northerly latitude that the sun can shine directly over head is named the Tropic of Cancer, suggesting that this term was first applied when Cancer marked the summer solstice point. The con stellation Libra, represented by the scales, no longer shoots the sun as did the autumnal con stellations of the Gemini and Taurus quartets, but instead it represents the night-and-day bal ance of the autumnal equinox. Capricornus, the goat-fish, is the apparent heir of the water symbols used for the winter solstice in the ear lier quartets. It was after the introduction of the Aries quartet that the ancients recognized that the 12 constellations comprising the three quartets completed the ecliptic circle, and that this Figure 7. The distribution of the classical constellations correspond to three belts in the sky: Upper (air), Middle (earth) and Lower (water) worlds of anicent peoples. Constel lations associated with the air?such as Draco (a winged dragon), Cygnus (the swan), Aquila (the eagle), Sagitta (the arrow), Lyra (a winged lyre) and Pegasus (a winged horse)?are concentrated near the north celestial pole (close to the center of the map). Constellations associated with water?such as Eridanus (the river), Cetus (the sea mon ster), Hydra (the sea serpent) and Argo Navis (Jason's ship)?are concentrated below the celestial equator (near the edge of the map). Constellations associated with the earth, the world of anthropomorphic beings?such as Ophiucus, Virgo, Gemini and Perseus? and animals?such as Leo, Taurus and Ursa Major?lie between the zones of air and water. The geometric center of the airborne constellations is near the common border of Cygnus and Lyra, a point that marked the north celestial pole about 16,000 years ago, suggesting that the division of the sky into three zones may be very old indeed. All 48 classical constellations are shown in this star chart from Astronomicon Caesareum (cir ca 1540) of Peter Apian. number roughly corresponds to the number of lunar cycles (or months) in a solar year. The 12-part zodiac became complete. In this regard, it should come as no surprise to learn that Aries, marking the vernal equinox of that epoch, is the first sign of the zodiac. The exclusion of the 13th constellation on the ecliptic (Ophiucus) from the zodiac is con sistent with the idea that the zodiac was con ceived as comprising three quartets. Further more, the notion that the zodiac consists of three quartets is consistent with the symbols during their respective epochs, and with the metaphorical progression of "ascent, height, descent and depth" in each set. 1997 May-June 271</page><page sequence="9">Other Beginnings At this point I have only discussed the origins of the zodiacal constellations, yet the classical Greeks were familiar with no less than 46 of the constellations we now recognize. Where and when did these other constellations begin? Here I would like to explore some other themes and patterns intrinsic to the constellations that might provide some clue to their origins. Many have proposed that Ursa Major (the Great She-Bear) may be among the most archa ic constellations, not least because the seven bright stars that mark the most recognizable part of the constellation (comprising the "big dipper") are visible nearly year round from midnorthern latitudes. Even more remarkable is the observation that this collection of stars is thought to represent a bear figure in several dif ferent cultures. Notable among these are the na tive peoples of Siberia and Alaska. Owen Gin gerich of Harvard University has proposed that this correspondence may date to the last glacial period, more than 12,000 years ago, when a natural land bridge across the Bering strait joined the two continents. The use of a bear im age that wanders around the northern pole every day is consistent with the pervasiveness of the cave-bear cults of Paleolithic peoples. There are other themes that might be ex tracted in the ancient constellations. Nearly all of the ancient constellations can be classified into three groups: images belonging to the air, anthropomorphic images that walk the earth and images associated with water. These three groups are nothing less than the symbols of the Upper (air), Middle (earth) and Lower (water) Worlds of ancient peoples. As it happens these groups correspond to three belts in the sky: Im ages associated with the Upper World of air or flight are concentrated near the north celestial pole, whereas the water-based images that cor respond to the Lower World are located low on the southern sky. The Middle World, where human beings and animals walk the earth, lies between these two belts. Ancient cuneiform texts reveal that the Sumerian-Akkadian sky of the second millen nium b.c. was indeed divided into three path ways, those of the gods Enlil, Ea and Anu. Enlil was located near the zenith, Ea near the south ern horizon and Anu between them. Who were these gods? Enlil was the deity for atmospheric phenomena and storms, Anu was the ultimate deity of beings in the Middle World and Ea was the deity of subterranean water. How old is the notion that the sky holds these three strata? One possibility is that the strata are concentric upon the north celestial pole at the time they were conceived. When we plot this point on the northern sky we find that it is located between the constellations Cygnus and Lyra. Because of precession, the north celestial pole was last located here in about 14000 b.c. Might the three strata of the northern sky date to this ancient time period? Future Research The origins of the constellations should keep scholars occupied for some time. For now, al low me to offer some parting thoughts. Consider the 42 constellations that were added to the sky since the "original" constella tions of the classical Greeks. In general these newer constellations follow a rule: The younger constellations tend to be smaller than the older constellations. Might this rule be ap plied to the constellations of antiquity? A mo ment's thought should reveal the logic: The first constellations that are described on an empty sphere should be larger than those fig ured on a partially filled sphere. If we test this idea on the zodiacal quartets, we do find that the average size of the constellations in the Gemini quartet is larger than those in the Tau rus quartet, which in turn is larger than those in than the Aries quartet. Why are the water constellations?Argo and Eridanus in particular?so much larger than the others? (The area of Argo was so unwieldy that 18th-century astronomers subdivided it into four constellations?Carina, Puppis, Pyxis and Vela?the ones we now recognize.) We do know that over the millennia the south celestial pole would have wandered in such a way as to reveal new stars above the southern horizon to observers in the midnorthern latitudes. Might these stars have been added to the existing con stellations, in effect constituting a "zone of ac cumulation," so that these constellations grew to their monstrous size? It should be noted that as new stars were added to the constellations in the the zone of accumulation, other stars would have disappeared in a "zone of erosion." Is it a coincidence that many of the constel lations and asterisms that date to antiquity are often made of seven stars? We know that an cient peoples were fascinated with numerolo gy, and that the number seven has a prominent place in Western mythology. Perhaps some of the earliest constellations were collections of the seven brightest stars in a region. Unfortunately, we may never learn the an swers to these questions. There is always the possibility, however, that some long-forgotten stone-age skywatcher made note of the star patterns his people recognized and recorded them on a cave wall that has yet to be discov ered. It would have been the first star atlas. Acknowledgments I am sincerely grateful to my colleagues for stimu lating discussions and comments: P. Beer (Vistas of Astronomy), R.
