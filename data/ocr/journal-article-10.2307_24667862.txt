<plain_text><page sequence="1">THREE FACES OF IDENTITY: ETHNICITY, COMMUNITY, AND STATUS IN THE CYPRIOT BRONZE AGE David Frankel and Jennifer M. Webb Introduction In this paper we will use archaeological evidence from the Bronze Age in Cyprus to address three of the many ways in which 'identity' can be constructed in prehistory. These, reflect different scales of analysis and archaeological circumstances on the one hand, and varied social and economic conditions on the other. We will explore identity as ethnicity at the start Of the Bronze Age; local identification within a relatively unified system in the Middle Bronze Age; and the assertion of individual identity and social status in the Late Bronze Age. These three examples raise a number of issues in archaeological practice, with two major underlying themes. An obvious methodological concern is the correlation between the archaeological construction of identity and intrinsic structures in ancient societies. A second issue is the scale or form of identity with which we are dealing, contrasting corporate or group identity with that of the individual. Identity as ethnicity in the mid-third millennium bce Over the last few decades 'ethnicity' has become a common term in both popular and academic discourse.1 It is, however, variously understood and used, often eliding social, cultural, racial or political constructs. Opposing approaches may emphasize ethnicity as 'primordial' (an innate, universal attribute of humanity) or 'instrumental' (people form groups, or identify themselves for some specific purpose). Some categorize ethnic groups in terms of their internal features or content; others in terms of their boundaries—their relationships to other groups. Groups may be recognized as self-defining or defined from outside, as static or fluid, as long-lived or ephemeral; while membership may be ascribed or assumed, permanent or subject to change. In such a circumstance of anthropological, sociological, and political confusion, how can we as archaeologists hope to identify or discover ethnicity in the past? While no one doubts the reality of group differences and differentiation there is a general unease about identifying groups in prehistory. Some of this unease stems from the abuse of archaeological evidence to construct or reify ethnic myths for political ends. Some of it stems from a rejection of earlier views of archaeological 'cultures' and their histories in favour of an understanding of the past in terms of social, economic, ecological or other processes— involving (to some extent at least) a denial of historical specificity and contingency. But much also stems from the inherent difficulties of recognizing identities in the past. Where textual evidence is available, archaeologists and historians appear to be more comfortable in discussing group identities, accepting those recognized in antiquity—what we might refer to as intrinsic identities. These are often based on, and give priority to, linguistic evidence—essentially equating language and ethnicity. For prehistoric societies, however, where neither language nor contemporary ancient authority are available we can only work with material culture to provide modern archaeological definitions, which in effect equate artefact types or styles with discrete social or ethnic groups—and which are more obviously modern archaeological constructs. ' For a convenient summary, see M. Banks, Ethnicity: Anthropological Constructions (1996). MEDITARCH 11, 1998, 1-12</page><page sequence="2">2 D. Frankel and J. Webb Earlier concepts of discrete archaeological entities, with clear boundaries in space and time, characterized by regularly recurring sets of artefacts have for many years been seen as representing an impossible—or at least extremely rare—ideal. This lack of spatial or typological clarity contributed to the fading belief in the ability to erect or maintain distinct 'cultures', and hence establish identifiable, significant groups in prehistory. Some approaches to ethnicity in archaeology take as a starting point the general recognition that ideology and belief form a major—if not core—component of social identification and reproduction. Where these are emphasized through the investigation of iconographie symbols, the underlying model of ethnic identity tends to reflect an instrumentalist perspective, as these serve to mark differences and to separate one group from another. One alternative approach, which leans toward a primordial view of ethnicity, considers general behavioural systems and technology rather than symbolic markers and is based on P. Bourdieu's concept of habitus: an inclusive conceptualization of the entire social and material constitution of social groups, worked out in action.2 The habitus structures action and concepts while not denying individual variability within the system. The interplay between individual and group is, indeed, a crucial element in the maintenance and transmission of cultural practices and values while at the same time allowing the development of variation. Habitus can be regarded as closely related to ethnicity, as, for example, by G. C. Bentley who 'identifies the complex of unconscious habitual action toward the world that Bourdieu calls 'habitus' as the locus of ethnic identification. It is through shared experience of the world that members of a group identify themselves as having a common identity'.3 For archaeologists, such a model of ethnicity, founded in everyday practice and action, has great advantages, as it relates to aspects of behaviour directly reflected in material culture. S. J. Shennan, for example, uses both Bourdieu's formulation and similar elements within the work of A. Giddens as appropriate for archaeological applications.4 Mundane artefacts encapsulate elements of habitus, representing as they do arrays of tasks and the ways in which they are carried out in different societies. Tools and techniques reflect culture-specific activities and are closely bound up with social and ecological structures and relationships. They are not only durable in themselves, but represent 'durable' learned behaviour. Competence in carrying out complex tasks often requires relatively long periods of exposure (implicit learning) or more explicit training in particular techniques, and therefore represents the inter-generational transmission of knowledge and attitude which lies at the core of the concept of habitus. In an earlier paper we suggested that the crucial transformations in material culture, behaviour, and technology which mark the start of the Bronze Age in Cyprus were initiated by the migration to the island by groups of people from southern, or more specifically south western Anatolia.5 Much of the evidence for this is seen in new, or newly introduced technologies, here understood in the broadest sense, to include industrial processes, agricultural practices and a range of domestic crafts and activities. These constitute a set of behaviours which characterize a homogeneous archaeological entity—the Philia facies of the Early Cypriot Bronze Age.6 It is increasingly evident that there was a degree of chronological overlap between the Philia facies and the Late Chalcolithic—the cultural system of the 2 Outline of a Theory of Practice (1977). 3 Banks op. cit. 45. 4 For example, A.

For a considerable period there were two different behavioural, technological, and economic systems within the island. Significant differences between these two archaeological cultures can be seen in a wide array of materials, techniques, and activities in all spheres of life. These are not just differences in style (often seen as the most significant marker of social or ethnic identity) but involve fundamental ways of working and organizing tasks and society. We will briefly comment on only four of these. Architecture Middle and Late Chalcolithic settlements are characterized by independent, circular multi function buildings built of pisé. Early Bronze Age settlements were built of mould-formed mud brick. The houses were rectilinear, with several interconnected rooms, and were built in complex agglomerative systems. These do not represent an evolution of house-form, but distinct ways of ordering social space. There can be little doubt that these reflect very different patterns of social organization and inter-personal relationships.7 Agriculture New animals, notably cattle and donkeys, were introduced to Cyprus in the mid-third millennium bce as part of the Philia complex. Their introduction not only required different husbandry skills but also the allocation of tasks and the scheduling of activities on a daily and ο seasonal basis. While Chalcolithic cultivation, presumably using hoes, would have been localized and intensive, Bronze Age plough-based agriculture (using ox-drawn sole ard ploughs) would have been more extensive differently organized, and would have allowed otherwise marginal areas to support larger populations. Cooking Different cooking techniques characterize the two systems. For example, direct fire-boiling vessels used in the Bronze Age are absent in the Chalcolithic, but are well represented in Bronze Age ceramic assemblages. The clay hobs and related hearth furniture seen from the excavations at Marki-Alonia are unknown in the Chalcolithic, and are closely related to well known Anatolian forms.9 These and other items related to culinary practices show that there were very different approaches to food-preparation and consumption—significant aspects of everyday life. Ceramics There are technological, functional, and decorative differences in ceramics. For example, handles are almost unknown in Chalcolithic pottery but vertical rod handles, attached to vessels by tenons, are a characteristic feature of the Bronze Age. These reflect not simply a technological difference in manufacture, but also different vessel functions and ways in which people handled their pottery. These and other material goods and technologies all show that there were substantially different ways of carrying out many daily activities and of organizing society in these two archaeological cultures. For a century or more two distinct systems operated on the island with essentially different behavioural patterns, based on different economic and technological foundations and modes of social interaction. They may therefore be seen as supporting a view 7 See Κ. V. Flannery, JMA 6, 1993, 109-17. 8 Frankel et al. art. cit.; Ε. Peltenburg in: V. Kara georghis-D.

In other words we may characterize a Chalcolithic habitus and contrast it with that of the significantly different Philia (Bronze Age). In this case our archaeological constructs appear to mesh with intrinsic constructs. Although this approach to identity fits best with a primordialist approach to ethnicity, one could also follow an instrumentalist model, in which the difference could be seen as relating to mechanisms (although not necessarily conscious strategies) designed to establish and maintain group integrity. There are, however, no other obvious, primarily symbolic, markers. There is, on the other hand, developing evidence of a long process of acculturation as Chalcolithic communities gradually adopted elements of technology, economy and associated lifeways of the Bronze Age system, eventually leading to their complete assimilation at the same time as the Philia facies evolved into the more widespread Early and Middle Cypriot cultural system. Community and individual identity in the Early and Middle Bronze Age During the later Early Cypriot and Middle Cypriot periods, common patterns of burial, pottery wares, metal types, architecture, economic strategies, and domestic crafts and activities suggest the development and maintenance of regular interaction and shared aesthetic, symbolic, technical, and behavioural elements across much of the island. There is also no clear evidence of differentiation within or between sites in status, based on systematic variation in size and quality of housing, tomb structure and contents or quality of material products. Where earlier two archaeological 'cultures' can be understood best as two ethnic groups, here we have a single behavioural system or habitus. Within this uniform system there were regional variations, but not of the same scale or type as seen earlier. Against this background of essential homogeneity only relatively minor variations in ceramic shape and decoration have been defined. These can be considered at the regional and the individual scale, using P. Weissner's concepts of emblemic arid assertive styles. 10·Ιη Weissner's formulation, emblemic styles are those where a more generalized identification with a local community style predominates, while assertive styles emphasize individuality within the cultural tradition. Individual identity has proved difficult to establish for prehistoric Bronze Age material in Cyprus, despite several attempts to link sets of pottery into appropriate groups, or to suggest that features of 'plank' figurines represent individual or status markings." For example, only a few small sets of Middle Cypriot Bronze Age White Painted Ware vessels are so similar and 1 Λ distinct that they can be regarded as the work of an identifiable individual. In a few cases two or three vessels clearly form distinctive sets. But as soon as one moves away from these occasional examples with a very distinctive, unusual, characteristic selection and combination of motifs, it is not possible to identify other pots painted by the same person. Most vessels conform to general local styles. There are similar difficulties in identifying the products of individual workers in Red Polished pottery—the predominant pottery of the period. Where there have been attempts to 1 ·Ί identify individual hands (as, for example, by J. B. Hennessy and E. Herscher), these too 10 American Antiquity 48, 1983, 253-76; S. J.

Regional variations characteristic of these emblemic styles may be recognized, although they do not necessarily form discrete groups. With the predominant Red Polished Ware a common aesthetic ideal surface treatment and colour, and the technical ability to achieve this can be documented across the island.15 There are some variations in shapes in different regions but the basic array of functional types is the same in all areas.16 There has, unfortunately, been no comprehensive study of the decoration on Red Polished pottery, but the general impression is of slight regional variations on common patterns. A similar scale of variation may also be seen with Black Polished Ware17 and with items such as spindle-whorls.18 50km Figure 1.

Sites near the centre of the island tend to have a wider array and more even distribution of motifs than those toward the periphery. More complex calculations of measure of similarity show that in general there was a regular fall-off in similarity of decoration with increased distance (fig. 2). There are, however, important differences between measures based on the simple presence of motifs and those based on their percentage or preferential use. While sites may display a similar repertoire of motifs (similarity measured by presence/absence declines relatively slowly), their proportional occurrence shows an initially higher level of similarity and a sharper fall-off with increased distance. This can be regarded as reflecting local or regional preferences for particular motifs and overall style. The main theme of decreasing similarity with distance is apparent in fig. 3 which presents one of many possible ways of summarizing comprehensive patterns of association. Although this formalizes a more fluid and complex reality, and the specific divisions and associations are to some extent a product of the techniques of calculating and manipulating similarity, this again shows localized and regional groupings. This accords with a general model of local communities, each with a distinct preference for certain designs within a common tradition. We may therefore see the concurrent maintenance of a generalized cultural—ideographic and technological—system alongside more localized identity. Identity, therefore, for much of the Early and Middle Bronze Age was constructed, or at least is only archaeologicaily visible, at the community level, somewhere between the assertion of personal individuality and the separation of ethnic groups with different behavioural systems.</page><page sequence="7">Three Faces of Identity 7 Figure 3. A diagrammatic representation of spatial patterning of relative similarity of decoration on Middle Cypriot White Painted pottery. Seals as markers of social identity in the Late Bronze Age Our third fac.e of identity brings us to the Late Bronze Age. This was a period of major socio economic change characterized by the growth of nucleated settlements and the emergence of centralized systems of political authority. Recently it has been proposed that an archaic state arose during the 16th century, founded by a paramount centre at Enkomi.20 While this fledgling state may not have been able to establish island-wide authority, it appears to have dominated foreign relations and maintained control over the mining, distribution, and export of Cypriot copper. This system broke down, however, during the 14th century and there is broad agreement that by the 13th century the island was divided amongst a series of peer polities, administered by local élites based in dispersed urban centres whose authority rested on the control of regional copper industries and other material and symbolic resources.21 These developments were accompanied by increased cultural and economic interaction with the state-organized polities of the Aegean and Eastern Mediterranean through the medium of external trade. This led to the rapid elaboration of a prestige-goods economy, largely based on the import of foreign goods. The shift to more complex socio-political organization also lead to the emergence of new power groups, the creation of significant status and wealth divisions and an increased reliance on written documentation and other mechanisms of administrative control. The site which best demonstrates these developments is the extensively excavated urban centre at Enkomi. Analyses of mortuary data from Enkomi have demonstrated the presence of a highly stratified social order with symbolically and economically differentiated élites by the 20 Peltenburg art. cit.

Contemporary tomb groups differ in wealth and access to symbolic goods, with highest-order burials marked by complements of prestige items (including gold and silver jewelry, faiences, ivories, bronzes and Mycenaean pictorial kraters). Redundancies of wealth in some tombs over generations further suggest descent group affiliations founded on hereditary wealth, while differences in the types of objects used to signify rank and an absence of structured relationships in mortuary variability suggest distinctions within the élite and ongoing competition for political dominance.23 The emergence of socio-political inequality is likely to have involved newly formed power groups in processes of self-definition and legitimation as they sought to establish their position and maintain control over wealth production and long-distance exchange. Mechanisms of status legitimation include public and ceremonial architecture, ritual paraphernalia, élite craft technology and the restricted circulation of exotic and symbolic artefacts.24 This section of our paper is concerned with the latter—that is with the use of symbolic artefacts, and more specifically cylinder seals, as markers of identity and status and bearers of élite authority. In most ancient complex societies identification at the individual level was achieved in the first instance through the use of script. In Cyprus this was undoubtedly also the case, at least for those integrated at the highest level of organization, but information in the form of written records has generally not survived. Only a handful of undeciphered documents in the 'Cypro Minoan' script exist, and it is likely that records were kept primarily on papyrus, leather, wax writing-boards or other non-durable materials.25 Cylinder seals, however, constitute a rich alternative body of evidence. Seals and sealings functioned as operational devices which depended, above all, on their ability to establish personal and/or group identity. As such, they were used to authorize or validate official and private transactions, to witness, guarantee, acknowledge receipt, and confirm obligations. In many areas of the ancient Near East official and private seals were inscribed with the name and patronymic of the seal owner. Cypriot cylinders, however, are rarely inscribed. Identity on these seals is constructed primarily through complex visual and stylistic imagery. What, then, do they tell us about the construction of identity in Late Bronze Age Cyprus? The Cypriots began producing their own seals during the 16th century and continued to do so until the end of the Late Bronze Age. Over 600 cylinders and many more stamp seals are extant. More than half have been found at Enkomi, although the others are widely distributed across the island.26 Following E. Porada, they can be divided into three broad groups—known as the Elaborate, Derivative, and Common Style—on the basis of their material, iconography and quality, and style of engraving.27 This scheme distinguishes between the finest, most complex engraving on hard stone (primarily haematite but also ivory, faience, and lapis lazuli) and less skilled, more schematic work on softer, locally available stones (primarily chlorite). 22 P.

They show winged or double-headed deities with horned crowns and embroidered gowns, sphinxes, griffins, and lions and bull-, lion-, and griffin-headed ministrants. They have a high level of internal variability and were carved by very skilled engravers. Cypro-Minoan inscriptions are occasionally included and motifs drawn from foreign iconographies are relatively common. Elaborate Style cylinders were also frequently fitted with gold caps, and are found outside Cyprus, particularly at Ugarit. Derivative Style Derivative Style seals also have a distinctive iconography. Stylistically this group is derivative of the Elaborate Style, but less skilfully carved with less internal variability and fewer references to external ideologies. A motif which occurs frequently shows a robed bare-headed figure, often identified as a Mistress of Animals, with lion, griffin or caprid (pl. 1: 2). Other seals depict ritual performances and adoration of a tree by griffins, lions orcaprids. Common Style Common Style seals are characterized by schematic engraving and recurrent compositions. The most common show a seated human figure with spear, attendant, tree, snake, and bucranium (pl. 1: 3) and a standing figure with concentric circles, ox-hide shaped ingots, tree, and bucranium. Other seals depict stylized human and animal figures and highly abbreviated symbols. The production context of Cypriot glyptic is poorly understood. Only one seal-carver's workshop has been identified. It was attached to an élite residence at Enkomi and appears to have produced Common Style seals and a range of other items in stone and iVory.28 This suggests that Common Style seals and perhaps also those of the Derivative Style were produced under élite sponsorship by artisans working also in related media. Elaborate Style cylinders, however, are unlikely to have been engraved in the same workshops. Carved by skilled engravers on materials acquired through long-distance exchange, their content shows a high level of esoteric knowledge and exposure to foreign iconographies. Elaborate Style seal cutters are likely to have been permanent retainers working within a more specialized, controlled system of production which ensured a supply of imported materials, supported the training of apprentices, and distributed the finished products, as well as providing engravers with subsistence commodities and other forms of security. Seals of all types appear to have been objects of high intrinsic value, produced in limited numbers in specialized workshops and circulated within a limited sphere of exchange. If dispersed by the state, ownership or use of seals is likely to have indicated a special relationship between seal-owner and state. By managing the distribution of seals, the latter could set their value within the system and control access to wealth. The distribution of such status-reinforcing goods is likely to have been through a system of circulation distinct from that of subsistence or utilitarian products, further emphasizing ranking distinctions and ensuring control of privileges conferred through their ownership and use. These operational aspects of seal use cannot be divorced from their iconographie content. As noted above, Cypriot glyptic shows a related and hierarchical ordering of materials, technology, style, production context, and ideological content. High status depictions, which 28 P.

Webb derive their authority from the super-human world, appear exclusively on finely carved haematite cylinders of the Elaborate Style, heroic or semi-divine figures (such as the Mistress of Animals) are depicted predominantly in the Derivative Style, while images associated with human authority and ritual observance appear in schematic compositions of the Common Style. This use of mutually exclusive, category-specific imagery requires explanation. The stylistic dimensions of material culture frequently play a significant role in the definition and maintenance of boundaries.29 Artefacts may stand as markers of ethnicity, social status or political alliance, and their distribution may exhibit fall-off behaviour at the boundaries of either spatially or hierarchically defined groups. Material culture may reinforce interaction or separation among such groups, with unique motifs or configurations of elements overtly signifying personal or group identity. Small image-bearing objects circulating within a controlled exchange environment, such as cylinder seals, readily lend themselves to use as symbolic markers—their function as sealing devices, items of personal adornment, and tokens of negotiable wealth serving to further reinforce social distance. Ownership of Elaborate Style seals, in particular, may have helped legitimize élite claims to divinely sanctioned authority by promoting a privileged relationship with the supernatural realm. As well as serving as sealing devices, they may also have marked ascribed privilege, bearing an ideology grounded in a system of social ranking and economic privilege based on formal principles of inheritance. Elaborate Style iconography also involves a conscious use of 'foreign' imagery. This borrowing of foreign symbols may reflect a spatially extensive social identity shared by élites within and beyond the island. This would have strengthened élite monopolies over the acquisition and distribution of foreign items and may be symptomatic of political alliances linking ruling families. Elaborate Style seals may also have been used in formal gift exchange, serving to establish horizontal alliances at the intra- and inter-island level. The iconography of Derivative and Common Style seals is predominantly concerned with ritual enactments and the observance of human authority. These seals frequently show generic motifs which are difficult to distinguish from one seal to another and are unlikely to have been used in ways which were dependent on the identification of individual seal-users. They may have been corporate or institutional seals, used to signify group affiliation, or indicative of specific types of transactions rather than individual liability. Such seals may have been used within middle or lower level managerial sectors, both for transactional purposes, in reward for services and as a means of communicating state ideology. Common Style motifs also frequently include abbreviated depictions of copper ingots, suggesting that seals of this type were linked with the management of the copper industry. In sum, there appears to be a compelling correspondence between the individual or corporate identity of the seal-owner, the function of the seal, and the choice and configuration of motifs. Seals arguably served as visual badges of social status and group affiliation. Seal images conferred authority upon individual seal-owners and upon any transaction the seal was used to validate, at the same time establishing dependence on the system granting that authority. As both operational devices and bearers of visual images they situated the individual within a particular administrative, economic, and socio-political hierarchy. By monopolizing the production and distribution of seals élite groups were able to monitor and control this status system, at the same time conferring rights and privileges legitimized through ownership and display of these objects. 29 See, e.g., M. Wobst in: C. E. Cleland (ed.), For the Director: Essays in Honor of James B. Griffin (1977) 317-42; A. Appadurai (ed.), The Social Life of Things: Commodities in Cultural Perspective (1986); I. Hodder (ed.), Symbolic and Structural Archaeology (1982).</page><page sequence="11">Three Faces of Identity 11 This assumes a highly structured visual imagery of identity, worked out through objects which were both operative tools and prestige goods symbolic of personal affiliation and status. In reality, of course, the relationship between symbolic expression and meaning can be imprecise or deliberately ambiguous and will almost certainly signal different things to different people at different times. This does not, however, undermine the broader premise that seals and sealings operated as social emblems carrying implicit ideological messages designed to express personal and group identity, maintain status differentiation, and enhance social cohesiveness. Conclusion We have, in this paper, chosen three quite different points of entry into the Cypriot Bronze Age. Each has raised different issues and involved a different methodology. The first point of entry, at the Chalcolithic/Early Bronze Age transition, allowed us to distinguish ethnic groups through an examination of habitus. This was possible, in large part, because for much of this period indigenous Chalcolithic communities and incoming Philia people lived in separate settlements and maintained mutually exclusive behavioural systems which have left distinctive residues in the archaeological record. These contrasting behavioural systems are both archaeologically visible (i.e. they are viable archaeological constructions of identity) and attributable to past entities with meaningful social boundaries (i.e. they mesh with intrinsic structures of corporate identity). Our second point of entry brought us to the widespread, relatively homogeneous and egalitarian cultural system of the late Early and Middle Bronze Age. In this instance only relatively minor variations in material culture are visible and only at a local or wider regional scale. Intrinsic or systemic constructions of identity (in so far as these are visible archaeologically) appear to have operated primarily at the emblemic level—i.e. they signal community affiliation and variability within a common system rather than personal identity, ethnicity, or status. Our third point of entry—to the complex, highly stratified systems of the Late Bronze Age—introduced new, cross-cutting categories of social identity. Complex societies have a significantly greater degree of internal social differentiation. This is characterized by the existence of sub-systems organized as semi-autonomous entities, and accompanied by the development of mechanisms which delineate and integrate these sub-systems within the larger whole. These mechanisms involve the establishment of a set of ideologies which provide symbolic referents to which a claim to solidarity may be made in inter-group and inter-personal relations. This approach focuses on the dynamics of social interaction and isolates both 'a scientifically real and natively meaningful segment of society'30—that is, it allows us to identify past social groupings which were independently meaningful to the original participants. Unlike the first two examples, which appear to fit best with a primordialist view, this third face of identity involves a necessarily instrumentalist perspective, and is strongly grounded in an argument which recognizes the creation and manipulation of symbolic markers (in this instance seals) as a major component of social identity and reproduction. In the Late Bronze Age, where individual and corporate identity were achieved through inheritance and ascription, and expressed through competing access to wealth and rank, the manipulation of symbolic referents played a significant role in the structuring and restructuring of identity and the establishment and maintenance of status insignia and social boundaries.
