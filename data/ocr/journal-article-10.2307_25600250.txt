<plain_text><page sequence="1">JANE A. NELSON Entelechy and Structure in "Christabel" For many readers the fragmentary nature of "Christabel" is self evident and incontrovertible although Coleridge's failure to conclude "Christabel" is self-evident only in certain traditional contexts that are themselves incomplete and fragmentary. In fact, contemporary devel opments in the history and theory of genres may eventually isolate a literary context within which closure in the poem will be recognized. Within less traditional but already existing theoretical contexts, more over, the half-human child figure in The Conclusion to Part n can be identified as an appropriate mediating term for the oppositions developed steadily throughout the poem. In such contexts, I will argue, the func tion of this figure in "Christabel" is precisely that of achieving closure. Of course the recognition of closure requires that we "read" the poem differently. We must put aside, insofar as possible, habits of response that encourage us to see the poem as a fragment. At present two principal reasons appear to sustain the traditional classification. First, the convic tion of Coleridge himself that "Christabel" remained unfinished. Sec ond, but perhaps more important, the failure of the poem to meet a number of conditioned expectations in the reader. Since in reading we make conscious and unconscious comparisons of "Christabel's" narra tion with that of other literary structures it partly resembles, we expect a different conclusion from the one the poem provides. A third possi bility?that the poem violates unconscious responses to some narrative grammar still to be isolated and described?cannot, at this time, enter into a consideration of the poem-as-fragment. Unfortunately the first two reasons for reading "Christabel" as a fragment are difficult to ignore. Even when we make the attempt, their claims too frequently intrude. The first reason?Coleridge's own belief that the poem is unfinished? settles the issue too quickly. If we accept this claim unconditionally, we commit ourselves to the familiar but always treacherous assumption that SiR, 19 (Fall 1980) 375</page><page sequence="2">376 JANE A. NELSON a writer is reliably aware of what he is doing or has done in a work of literature and that what he thinks he is doing is privileged information about the work we have. Certainly the author is aware?he intends.1 The choice of the name Christabel is itself an important example of significant intention. But to establish the extent and nature of an author's intention remains difficult if not impossible. If one accepts (with con ditions) the importance of the author's formal intentions, for example, he must also remember that Coleridge attached The Conclusion to Part ii to the poem and left it there. Those who consider this conclusion inappropriate seem unwilling to accept intention in this important in stance. For that matter, much of the significant commentary on the poem ignores The Conclusion altogether. Of course it does not follow that Coleridge consciously recognized that this section appropriately ended the poem. But given the similar nature of "mediating terms" in other narrative circumstances, that he did so unconsciously is quite likely.2 In spite of these difficulties, let us grant for the moment that Cole ridge's intentions provide a number of important and useful contexts in terms of which the text develops meanings for us or we develop mean ings for the text. Which of his intentions bear on the question of the ending? And how? In the case of "Christabel," for example, the "ide ological and creative context" in which the poem was written has been extended by Jonas Spatz to include a theory of human sexuality devel oped by Coleridge in notebooks, letters, and the poems written from 1797 to 1801.3 In such a context, Spatz argues, the unwritten ending outlined by Coleridge's physician and biographer, James Gillman, and i. The question of intention has been reopened in contemporary literary theory. But even Quentin Skinner, who makes a strong case against the "intentional fallacy" and who distinguishes helpfully among different motives and intentions, points out that a claim can still be made that "the writer may have been self-deceiving about recognizing his inten tions, or incompetent at stating them. And this seems to be perennially possible in the case of any complex human action" ("Motives, Intentions and the Interpretation of Texts," New Literary History, 3 [1972], 405). 2. The "other narrative circumstances" are principally those of myth in which "me diating terms" are introduced in an attempt to resolve oppositions. See Claude Levi Strauss, "The Structural Study of Myth," in his Structural Anthropology, trans. Claire Jacobsen and Brook Grundfest Schoepf (Garden City: Anchor Books, 1967), pp. 202-28. Beverly Fields, writing from a psychoanalytic perspective, argues that the narrative of "Christabel" is incomplete, but that psychologically the poem is finished since in it appear the tensions Coleridge could express no other way and that "when he had fully expressed his fantasies, he had also finished with the poem" (Reality's Dark Dream: Dejection in Coleridge [Kent, Ohio: The Kent State U. Press, 1967], p. 83). 3. Jonas Spatz, "The Mystery of Eros: Sexual Initiation in Coleridge's 'Christabel,'" PMLA, 90 (1975), 107-10.</page><page sequence="3">ENTELECHY AND STRUCTURE IN "CHRISTABEL" 377 based apparently on the poet's own detailed suggestions, offers a the matically meaningful conclusion to the narrative elements introduced in the first two parts. Spatz's argument is most convincing if Christabel (as is usually the case in the criticism) is treated as a fully "human" figure.4 But Coleridge's interest in sexuality enters the poem in other ways, I believe?ways that include other elements in the poem's struc tures. Moreover, if we focus on the "psychology" of Christabel or on the diachronic possibilities of a story developed around her sexual ad ventures and marital possibilities, we distort her role in the structure and obscure the various functions of her figure in the poem. Indeed, other "creative contexts" are relevant to the reading of "Chris tabel" and bear significantly on the question of closure. During the same period in which the poem was written, for example, Coleridge's ab sorbed but ambivalent interest in his own children and in the "child"? as well as his life-long interest in the problems of opposition (emerging most importantly in his speculations on "polar logic")?undoubtedly provided generative creative and ideological contexts for its writing. Certainly that is the case if we turn our attention from the story of a Christabel we create in human form (as we read) to an attempt to categorize the relationships established among as many of the elements as we can isolate in the system ofthe poem. Other figures?such as the father?are too frequently ignored or slighted in commentary on the poem-as-fragment, but nevertheless function significantly in this system. Finally, although to pursue intention in a study of "Christabel" is a dubious enterprise, if we do examine closure in the contexts of intention, the fact that Coleridge intended to write a longer poem on any specific issue should not commit us in any way to seeing the poem as a fragment nor to "seeing" the figure of Christabel as disproportionately important. The second principal reason for considering "Christabel" a frag ment?that it does not correspond to our conscious or unconscious experience of most literary narrative?presents us with greater difficul ties. Several attempts to provide suitable and conventional endings for "Christabel" (including Coleridge's own suggestions) indicate an oper ation that may affect all our readings: a normalizing of the poem by generating from its seminal narrative elements more familiar literary structures, even though plot outline, as J. B. Beer pointed out, cannot tell us how the "symbolic structure of the poem might have been 4. Spatz, pp. 113-15. Spatz recognizes archetypal figures in the poem (the innocent maiden, the stepmother and others) as well as fairy tale parallels to its structures, but he focuses on Christabel as "human" (she has an unconscious) and on the structures of fairy tales that have undergone considerable literary elaboration.</page><page sequence="4">378 JANE A. NELSON resolved.5 Unfortunately all such attempts to rescue "Christabel" from its anomalies will direct our analyses away from the poem's combina tions of embryonic narrative elements or even prevent us from recog nizing "narrative" itself on a less familiar "level." To be sure, at the same time we normalize the text by supplying characters and story lines, we acknowledge the generative power of this "fragment" and often point to its similarity to dream and nightmare or to fairy tale and myth, especially in their elemental, non-literary forms. If at this point we were to entertain the arguments of A. J. Greimas that "narrativity" exists prior to its manifestations in linguistic substance or other languages such as those of dream or cinema,6 we might see emerg ing in "Christabel," at a more elemental level than that of literary narrative proper, manifestations of narrativity significantly closer to non literary myth. Furthermore, we could expect to find analogues to the poem's structure (as an arrangement of images) in the "language" of dream, since the figures and actions of the poem so persistently suggest nightmare to its readers. In both instances I believe the focus of analysis should be on the complex relations of oppositions (and their possible resolution) in the poem. For that matter, the functions of these oppositions in the structuring of "Christabel" should not be overlooked nor underestimated in any reading inasmuch as all operations in the poem manifest relationships among oppositions: the "characterization," the "setting" and other spa tial representations, the "actions," and the arrangement of parts. These oppositions extend into other systems by which a number of the poem's meanings are established. References to Christ and Abel in the title provide an obvious and first illustration of such extension, evoking as they would for most readers a recognition of the opposites Christ/Satan, Abel/Cain in Christian mythology, and taking the reader both into and out of the poem.7 "Within" the poem, the concentration?and styliza tion?of oppositions, as well as the poem's primitive development of both "character" and narrative segment command attention. At this 5. J. B. Beer, Coleridge the Visionary (1959; rpt. New York: Collier Books, 1962), p. 199. 6. A. J. Greimas, "Elements of a Narrative Grammar," trans. Catherine Porter, Dia critics, 7, No. 1 (1977), 23. 7. Coleridge's interest in the great fratricidal crime of Christian myth is clearly part of the creative context in which "Christabel" was written. He worked on The Wanderings of Cain in the same year in which he wrote Part 1 of "Christabel." Norman Fruman sees the name Christ-Abel as "embracing the two archetypal victims of man's murderous impulses" and links Coleridge's "murderous rage" against an older brother to the persistent theme of brother-murder in the poet's work (Coleridge, The Damaged Archangel [New York: Braziller, 1971], p. 362).</page><page sequence="5">ENTELECHY AND STRUCTURE IN "CHRISTABEL" 379 point, Greimas' analyses of narrativity suggest useful and provocative contexts for reading the poem, whether or not the still fragile outlines of his current narrative "grammar" survive. I do not exclude other contexts in which the text could be read and in terms of which closure should be examined. In fact, two of these will be introduced later when the question of a resolution of opposites is discussed. The first consideration must be "characterization" in "Christabel" insofar as that can be isolated for comment. Greimas argues for the development of character from a so-called "deep" structure, prior to language and consisting of a homology of logical or conceptual oppo sitions. In order for this "taxonomic core" to manifest itself ultimately in narrative, an anthropomorphizing of these operations must occur, re sulting in what he calls actants. When these actants are assigned identifi ably social or cultural attributes, they are transformed into recognizable fictional roles which, upon further individuation, emerge ultimately as "characters" (acteurs). The anthropomorphic level (a "surface" narrative grammar, but not narrative manifested in figurative language) is a nec essary intermediate level capable of generating?but not identical with? "narrative manifested in a figurative form (where human or personified actors would accomplish tasks, undergo trials, reach goals)." 8 The trans formations by which such initial logical oppositions develop into nar ratives are complex and by no means fully sketched. Nor are actant and character, as described by Greimas, isomorphic and susceptible of a simple one-to-one conversion: a "character" may represent two actants, or two "characters" manifest one, for example. Nevertheless, if Greimas is correct, the figures and actions of manifest narrative remain characterized by the initial binary semic oppositions from which they are generated (P- 33). Do these figures in "Christabel" suggest more clearly in their func tions the actants of Greimas' surface narrative grammar than they do the "characters" of more developed narrative in which the devices of man ifest narrative are extensively displayed?9 Certainly they appear in re cognizably "literary" language. (The language of dream, whatever it is, is something else.) They do demonstrate in a considerable number of actions, but not all, the characteristics of literary role and even (for many 8. Greimas, p. 29. For a discussion of Greimas' contribution to models of character, see Jonathan Culler, Structuralist Poetics (Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell U. Press, 1975), pp. 233-35. 9. Coleridge appears to have been uneasily aware of the paucity of "incident" and "character" in the poem. He apparently recognized that considerable literary elaboration would be necessary in order for the poem to reach a reading public conditioned by certain experiences in literature. See the discussion of this issue in Paul Magnuson, Coleridge's Nightmare Poetry (Charlottesville: U. Press of Virginia, 1974), pp. 95-96.</page><page sequence="6">380 JANE A. NELSON readers) the shadowy lines of "character," although scant textual "evi dence" exists for these elaborations which seem to me attempts to normalize and humanize the text. The question cannot be answered finally at this point, but what will be traced is the extent to which the figures (avoiding the term character) reveal in their functions the opera tions of opposition which Greimas sees as essential in the generation of narrative: the transfer of a value (or object) from one actant to another (P- 34). It may be granted that insofar as they appear at almost every moment capable of losing whatever figurative (human) character they possess and resolving themselves into anthropomorphized oppositions, the figures of the poem reveal "actantial" origins more obviously than do many if not most characters of more familiar narrative. This effect?of threat ening to resolve into conceptual components?results in part from the abstracting function of point-of-view in the poem: that of an observing and commenting narrator. (In part the "events" appear as the manifes tations of the mental operations of an "I.") It also results from the presentation of "character" in a minimal number of discrete encapsulated motifs. Unfortunately, even critics who focus on the "dream" character of the poem "humanize" these figures. Patricia Adair, for example, agrees with Coleridge that poetry is "rationalized dream," but when she speaks of Christabel, her literary prejudice is clearly in favor of "hu manized" character: It may be intellectually satisfying to say that it [the poem] is about the corruption of the will, so that, in the end, evil is indistinguish able from good, but it means that we lose the humanity of the poem. Christabel has become a symbol and ceased to be a person, but, as we read the poem, no evil really seems to touch her inner essence. Far from feeling her to be sinful, we are tormented with sympathy for her, as her creator surely was. . . .10 We might agree that no evil seems to touch her inner essence?not, however, because she is a person who somehow maintains her person ality against contagion, but because her inner essence, defined by her functions in the poem and her relationships with Geraldine (and other quasi-human figures) is one of opposition, principally to the figure of Geraldine (in spite ofthe exchange of natures between the two). The values we attach to this term are various and are probably established initially by the manifest "system" of meanings evoked by the title. Christabel's name, it has been noted, has more than Christ in it: she io. Patricia M.

Although Coleridge himself experimented with the forms Christobell/Christabel,11 the reader who brings a Judeo-Christian context to the poem cannot escape the value of the term in the poet's final choice.12 In fact, this dimension of meaning introduces the elaborate play of opposites in the poem since Christ and Abel are defined by (and presuppose) their opposites, Satan and Cain. In the motifs identifying Christabel and Geraldine in Part I, several bisexual indications introduce oppositions that will be important to later stages of this argument: Christ and Abel appear in female form; Geral dine evokes by her actions, her form, and her name, the powerful suggestions of masculinity. She, like Cain (and other mythological par allels to her figure), bears the "mark" of her shame.13 It might also be noted at this point that the fatal division between brothers reappears clearly in Part n in the split between Sir Leoline and Lord Roland. But the most extensive demonstration of the operation of opposites in Part I lies in Christabel's complex dialectical relationship with Geraldine, especially as each of these figures functions in generating its opposite. Moreover, the extensive generation of opposites in the poem's manifest level argues for the existence in the "logic" of "Christabel" of another essential characteristic of the taxonomic core Greimas identifies in his fundamental narrative grammar: the ability of each of the terms of a binary semic category to project "a new term which would be its contradictory" (p. 25). Before identifying the core "logic" of the narrative, however, the complex of surface oppositions needs tracing. These oppositions in "Christabel" appear in a nexus of relationships expressed principally in images of rising and falling, swelling and retracting, dividing and un iting. There are other important categories: inner/outer, above/below, light/dark?to name some of the most obvious. But the important point for our analysis of "character" is that the major figures function as part of this nexus?not as "human" figures placed in a complementary or appropriate "setting." Frequently the images in which they appear clearly indicate the "power" of one opposite to "generate" the other: ii. Arthur H. Nethercot, The Road to Tryermaine (New York: Russell, 1962), p. 37. 12. Nethercot ignored the Abel in Christabel's name although he made a considerable argument for the significance ofthe Christ (see pp. 207-08). Fruman's identification ofthe fratricidal theme in the Abel motif is closer to a recognition of the relation of opposites in the poem (see n. 7 above). 13. The parallel between Cain and Geraldine, insofar as it is made on the basis ofthe archetypal "mark" each bore, was early recognized, as was her link with other figures who bore a "definite token of some transgression" (Nethercot, pp. 127-28).</page><page sequence="8">382 JANE A. NELSON the rising of Geraldine's powers, for example, occurs at the same mo ment that a literal "falling" of Christabel (or some other opposite) occurs; this "rising" is countered immediately, until the end of Part i, with an increase in the power of Christabel. And the reverse. Put more abstractly, whenever the power of action of one figure becomes domi nant, a "transfer" of power to its opposite occurs. No equilibrium is sustained. In the representation of such exchanges, we "see" Christabel?the "good" Christ/Abel figure?literally bring an "evil" Geraldine to life, beginning with an exchange in Part I between inner and outer. Christabel leaves the enclosed "human" environment of the castle?here the sign of "culture"?to enter the open and unformed dark forest world. There she "falls" (kneels) beneath a huge oak tree to pray. (The power of "nature" over "culture" at this moment is apparent.) While still on her knees she hears Geraldine moan. Christabel's very sinking down has evoked that response, at the sound of which she springs up. On the opposite side of the tree she finds a lady in many ways her counterpart but whose silken robes in that dark world, we already suspect, hide a darker nature. Detail after detail in these passages produces a "play" of opposites: Christabel folds her arms beneath her cloak; Geraldine's stately neck and arms are bare. Geraldine speaks of white-mounted horse men who crossed the "shade of night" to carry her to the wide oak. We are directed from the image of a Christabel below to the oak's last red leaf "Hanging so high / On the topmost twig that looks up at the sky" and "That dances as often as dance it can."14 (The only other time the color red appears in the poem is in the description of the child?the "limber elf" with "red round cheeks," that "fairy thing" who also dances in The Conclusion to Part n.) The night of Christabel's first encounter with Geraldine reminds us of autumn, but the month is April. The steps ofthe two figures as they move toward the castle "strove to be, and were not, fast" (Pt. i, 1. 113; CPW, 1, 219). When Christabel first sees Geraldine, she assists her to rise and sup ports her passage from "outer" to "inner." But the support Christabel provides at this point and the mysterious ebbing and flowing of Geral dine's power (long noticed by critics) belong to that larger system of binary oppositions in which each rise in "power" on the part of one element or figure generates its opposite as inexorably as the owl wakes the cock in the first few lines ofthe poem or the devil answers the matin 14- The Complete Poetical Works of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, ed. Ernest Hartley Coleridge (Oxford: Oxford U. Press, 1912), 1, 217 (Pt. 1, 11. 51-52). Further references to this edition appear in the text and are abbreviated CPW.</page><page sequence="9">ENTELECHY AND STRUCTURE IN "CHRISTABEL" 383 bell at the beginning of Part n. Even the "might and main" of Christabel in the initial scene in Part I represents a shift of power to her figure when Geraldine falters at the threshold of exchange between inner and outer: The lady sank, belike through pain, And Christabel with might and main Lifted her up, a weary weight, Over the threshold of the gate: Then the lady rose again, And moved, as she were not in pain. (Pt. i, 11. 129-34; CPW, 1,, 220) The introduction of this outsider contaminates the enclosed space of the castle?truly a land of the dead before Geraldine's arrival in spite of its significance as enclosed human space. It now contains the explosive potential of an exchange of power between opposites. More important to a later stage in this argument is the recognition that a new term has been introduced into the relationships represented by Christabel and her father. Inside the castle, the transfer of power from subject to object, "her oine" to "villain," and back again continues. The moment Christabel praises the Virgin (representative of the powers above and also signifi cant in the fundamental sexual oppositions in the poem), Geraldine's powers fade: "Alas, alas! said Geraldine, /1 cannot speak for weariness" (Pt. 1, 11. 141-42; CPW, 1, 221). This invocation of the Virgin increases Christabel's power. But in the next few lines, flames, hidden in the ashes of the fire, flare up as Geraldine passes, suggesting that the fires of Hell have answered this revelation of Heaven's power. In unknowing "response" to these flames of fire, Christabel next trims the "lamp with twofold silver chain . . . fastened to an angel's feet," causing Geraldine once more to sink down "in wretched plight" (Pt. 1, 11. 182-83; CPW, 1, 222). Such rising and falling action in Part 1 registers clearly the operation of opposites that becomes progressively magnified and ob vious in the poem. Indeed, the references in Part 1, by evoking early in the poem the apocalyptic and demonic worlds of Heaven and Hell, delineate the cosmological antinomies of Christian mythology. The negative effects of Geraldine's actions have long been studied: an "evil" Geraldine (not without apparently ambivalent motives in the eyes of some critics) invades the very substance of a "good" Christabel, modifying Christabel's behavior, destroying her relationships with her father, and providing her with intuitions of even greater evil to come. But if we attend closely to the interplay of opposites, we are obliged to acknowledge the extent of the positive effects of Geraldine's actions, that</page><page sequence="10">384 JANE A. NELSON is, the generating of an opposite "good" from her "evil" acts. Sir Leoline is the principal example. That he is under the influence of an "evil" figure, moreover, and turns against an "innocent," should in no way obscure the positive effect on him of Geraldine's presence in the hall nor the appearance of a new set of terms in hostile opposition: Sir Leoline and Lord Roland, Leoline's "heart's best brother." Undue emphasis on the "story" of Christabel and Geraldine, in fact, has led readers to slight these significant changes in the figure of Chris tabel's father. Described as so weak in health in Part I that he cannot be awakened even in the extraordinary circumstances of Geraldine's ap pearance, he appears so roused in Part n by the tale she tells him that he swells to phallic splendor and vigorous protest. (In this section shrinking and swelling appear as expressions of power or its loss; splitting and reuniting are the most significant relational terms.) Sir Leoline moves to act swiftly?hardly the image of a sick man who himself decreed that each matin bell should knell him back to a world of death. Such a recovery underscores the essential "logic" of his "character"; he is gen erated as an opposite (active, powerful) to which various values (phallic, parental, moral) may be attached. Clearly, too, Geraldine's tale of her misfortune?an "evil" ruse?has a "positive" effect on Sir Leoline even in the most familiar and shallow of moral contexts. More abstractly, a transfer of power of action has occurred in the interaction of opposites in this section as in Part I. If we look at Sir Leoline in the various contexts some of the motifs evoke, we must describe this change as salutary. He forgets his age; his "noble" heart "swells high with rage"?directed not against an innocent Christabel at this point, but against what in familiar moral categories would be con sidered "evil": the forcible abduction of Geraldine. But even more im portant than the Baron's return to vigor is his vow to mend the rift between himself and the brother-friend of his young manhood. "A dreary sea now flows between" them (Pt. ii, 1. 423; CPW, 1, 229). Before Geraldine's appearance, however, the piety and love of a dutiful daughter never worked to restore Sir Leoline to health nor urged him to mend the ancient and "brotherly" rift between himself and Lord Roland. These changes and Sir Leoline's further reactions complicate and climax the interplay of opposites in the poem's system. The significance of such oppositions for the presentation of "charac ter" in the poem should be recalled at this point. "Characters" (or, preferably, figures) in "Christabel" play out functions that are positive in some instances, negative in others. While it is true in most contexts that Geraldine's violation of Christabel's innocence appears evil, her effect can be perceived as positive in the contexts we have just described</page><page sequence="11">ENTELECHY AND STRUCTURE IN "CHRISTABEL" 385 and as regenerative in the "land of the dead" presented as Sir Leoline's castle. Her functions are positive?and work toward re-union of what once-was-one by producing Sir Leoline's resolve to mend the rift that divides him from Lord Roland.15 I will argue later that Geraldine's figure also completes an equation in the poem's narrative structure that is essential to the appearance of the child figure in The Conclusion to Part ii. But as "characters" the figures operate variously in the larger system of oppositions the poem develops. The lesser systems of motifs by which each is presented provide foci for this relentless presentation of oppositions and indicate the significant categories of "core" opposi tions. At this point I would argue that the mysterious figures of Geraldine and Christabel, acting in a more-or-less familiar Judeo-Christian cos mology, do more than echo the mythological. The structure of oppo sitions in which they appear in the poem suggests the operations of myth itself before it has undergone extensive literary elaboration. In fact, "Christabel" manifests clearly those characteristics of what Levi Strauss calls "mythical thought." Such thinking "always progresses from the awareness of oppositions toward their resolution" ("The Structural Study of Myth," p. 221). Describing mythical "thought" roughly as a kind of process, Levi-Strauss observes that this process attempts (not always successfully) to find a "mediating term" between what is per ceived by human beings as the irreconcilable opposites of their experi ence. "Mist," for example, is construed as mediating between sky and earth, or "garments" between "nature" and "culture." Those terms that do not admit of mediation in mythical structures are frequently replaced by those that do; moreover, one may find a "chain" of mediators in a collection of related myths.16 These mediating terms are anomalous with respect to the categories they mediate?an essential characteristic de scribed by Edmund Leach in his analysis of Genesis: 15- The brother-rift is a persistent personal as well as literary concern for Coleridge. His letters and dreams reflect a "bitter hatred" for his brothers. See Fruman, p. 363 and p. 548, n. 26. 16. Levi-Strauss, "The Structural Study of Myth," p. 222. In the numerous versions of particular myths, "mythical thought" is manifested in a multiplicity and recurrence of themes; according to Levi-Strauss, it "never develops any theme to completion: there is always something left unfinished. Myths, like rites, are interminable" (The Raw and the Cooked, trans. John and Doreen Weightman [1964; New York: Harper and Row, 1969], p. 6). However, when mediation appears, it often closes a particular version of a myth, even if such closure is unstable. This instability is true of the mediating function of the child figure in The Conclusion to Part 11, although the term introduced provides "closure" in the sense of presenting an appropriate mediation ofthe opposites in the poem.</page><page sequence="12">386 JANE A. NELSON In every myth system we will find a persistent sequence of binary discriminations as between human/superhuman, mortal/immortal, male/female, legitimate/illegitimate, good/bad . . . followed by a "mediation" of the paired categories thus distinguished. "Mediation" (in this sense) is always achieved by introducing a third category which is "abnormal" or "anomalous" in terms of ordinary "rational" categories. Thus myths are full of fabulous monsters, incarnate gods, virgin mothers. This middle ground is abnormal, non-natural, holy. It is typically the focus of all taboo and ritual observance.17 "Christabel" is par excellence a poem of anomalous terms?as well as of the awareness of oppositions. It is also a poem of "middle," often disturbingly liminal terms whether or not their anomalous character is readily apparent: the middle of the night, the time of the year just between winter and spring, the oak green with moss and rarest mistletoe (instead of leaves) that stands between Christabel and Geraldine, Geraldine's "half way" attempt to lift some mysterious weight within as Christabel rises "half-way" in her bed to look at the lofty lady. The list could be continued into Part n where Bracy is half listened to and mist and cloud lie between the castle and the Devil in Borrodale, recalling the "thin gray cloud" of Part I that "covers but not hides the sky." (As a mediating term between earth and sky, the cloud appears here in a familiar myth ological function [Leach, p. 14]). The poem is haunted by the monstrous, the holy and unholy, the ritual gesture, the broken charm. But the most important "anomalous" term leading to closure in "Christabel" is that of the child in The Conclusion to Part 11. This figure alone mediates successfully between the categories of male and female fundamental to the oppositions developed in the poem. It resolves, if only temporarily, the painful contemplation of sexual division and human coupling Col eridge presents. The re-union of what in this world is divided is the problem the "logic" of the poem attempts to solve. It is an issue raised explicitly in the lines of the poem and essentially in the structural equations from which the narrative segments are generated. It is also an ancient issue in mythological speculations. Division, separation, and opposition, we have seen, are everywhere in Part 1 of "Christabel." They are equally significant in Part 11 and are endlessly inclusive, relentlessly crossing all the categories of human cultural and physical experience Coleridge could have known?male and female, up and down, inner and outer, life and death, Heaven and Hell, 17- Edmund Leach, "Genesis as Myth," in Genesis as Myth and Other Essays (1962; rpt.

But the focus of division (and opposition) in the relationships among the motifs constituting the major figures is familial and sexual.18 Male/female, parent/child, brother/brother, "sister"/"sister," brother/"sister"?the terms ofthe re lationships arrange themselves along axes that connect familial or sexual categories of division and opposition. Moreover, each "figure" is rep resentative of several terms in the relationships. The narrative segments that appear in the poem develop from various attempts to replace one term with another in such relationships in order to achieve a union of opposites. The original perception of fundamental human sexual division and opposition generates all such efforts to achieve union. Even attempts to join brother with brother or sister with sister in order to resolve division and reunite oppositions depend on the introduction of a real or implied sexual relationship. The recognition (and Coleridge's rejection) of the division of the human world into male and female is the principal or "core" binary opposition in the poem, but these terms themselves have undergone division, generating others that are in curious and perhaps unexpected (except from a psychoanalytic perspective) opposition. Such is the division of the male term into hostile "brothers." The Abel of Christabel's name first evokes the ancient fratricidal crime that so haunted Coleridge. Even more obvious in the narrative development is the ancient, angry separation of Lord Roland and Sir Leoline to be resolved in Part n by Sir Leoline's promise to restore Geraldine to her father. But the inerasable identity of the two male figures is asserted in the analogies drawn: They stood aloof, the scars remaining, Like cliffs which had been rent asunder; A dreary sea now flows between;? But neither heat, nor frost, nor thunder, Shall wholly do away, I ween, The marks of that which once hath been. (Pt. ii, 11. 421-26; CPW, 1, 229) It is Geraldine's presence that initiates the attempt to reunite the two although in fact it is not this reunion, but the establishing of a significant relationship between Sir Leoline and Geraldine that actually takes place. 18. The exception is Bracy, although at least one commentator argues that Bracy is a "good father" figure (Fields, p. 70). Bracy's incipient narrative function appears likely to be that of donor. See Vladimir Propp, The Morphology ofthe Folktale, 2nd ed., trans. Laurence Scott, rev. and ed. Louis A. Wagner (Austin and London: U. of Texas Press, 1968), p. 39. Bracy also represents an earlier and unsuccessful attempt at mediation.</page><page sequence="14">388 JANE A. NELSON If the division of the male term produces inevitably hostile brothers, the division of the female creates "sisters" in opposition. "Sister," I would argue, is one of the relationships between Christabel and Geral dine: they are sisters in the sense that both are daughters (given Geral dine's account of her origins) of a two-part male figure, that of Sir Leoline and Lord Roland. The designation also acknowledges the per ception of many readers that Christabel and Geraldine are in many ways halves of the same self, or more accurately, polarized manifestations of the same substance.19 Whether one accepts the designation "sister" or not, it is clear in the poem (and in life) that what was (or is) one becomes two. We perceive Man endlessly divided into men in his generations, and original oneness lost. The poem attempts to reverse this experience. Can one be recreated from two? From two of the same kind? Are two really one? How can what was one become two? And in opposition? The essential mythological divisions of world into light and dark, above and below, of human kind into male and female, of male and female into sisters and brothers?those puzzles which may give rise to the narratives of Genesis and the questions of human familial experience, appear in the divisions and unions of "Christabel." The poem attempts to undo the reality of division the mind perceives by restoring an original lost unity?the elusive genesis of our being. Coleridge's poem has suggested The Book of Genesis to other critics for many different reasons. Beverly Fields, for example, again focusing principally on the figure of Christabel in her analysis, sees Christabel's loss of innocence as the fall from a symbolic Eden, that sheltered home she leaves at the beginning of Part I (p. 77). Actually this Eden is more truly a "land of the dead" in which, significantly, the appropriate sexual partner is missing for both Christabel and Sir Leoline. If narrative is frequently precipitated, as Vladimir Propp's analysis of fairy tales sug gests, by a lack,20 the figures of the poem form an equation of sexual opposition at this point in which four terms are significant and two of them are lacking: Male Female Sir Leoline x (wife) x (lover) Christabel Not only is the virgin daughter's lover absent, the female parent is dead. In the fallen world of human culture we observe, Eden is already lost, 19- Magnuson believes the presence of good as well as evil in the Geraldine of Part i is explained by recognizing Christabel and Geraldine as "mirror images" (Coleridge's Night mare Poetry, p. 102). 20. Propp, pp. 76-78. See especially his remarks on the function of a lack of a suitable marriage partner for the hero of the fairy tale.</page><page sequence="15">ENTELECHY AND STRUCTURE IN "CHRISTABEL" 389 and regeneration cannot occur except incestuously between daughter and father. Only this incestuous union of opposites could restore original oneness in the human terms present at this point in the narrative. (Dis guised incestuous relationships that have not gone unnoticed appear inevitably in the working out ofthe poem's equation.) In fact, the puzzle Coleridge presents cannot avoid an incestuous "solution," as I will argue in a moment. But it is Geraldine, an apparent outsider in Part I, whose serpentine and sexual nature initiates the actions of union and reunion once she is introduced into the "Eden" of the castle. She substitutes, however monstrously, for both missing terms, the wife-mother and the lover. In Part i Geraldine lies with Christabel in circumstances many readers have seen as mysteriously, pervertedly, even incestuously sexual.21 She appears as a "lofty" lady, commanding Christabel to lie down, and revealing in her undressing a bosom and half a side that are a "sight to dream of, not to tell" (Pt. i, 1. 253; CPW, 1, 224). She hesitates myste riously, then takes Christabel to what is described in Part 11, in Chris tabel's recollection ofthe event, as her "bosom old," her "bosom cold" (Pt. 11, 11. 457-58; CPW, 1, 230).22 The results of this coalescence are several. First, in The Conclusion to Part 1, Christabel becomes a "child" and Geraldine a "mother" figure; second, Christabel acquires a serpen tine nature and it is as this monstrous product of their union that Christabel functions principally in Part 11. In Part 11, Geraldine, by this time identified in one set of relationships as a maternal figure, is "led forth" by Sir Leoline. The passage which shifts Christabel into the role of child (thereby denying her nubility) seems curious indeed after the images in which the apparently unholy coalescence is described, but it is as true to the poem's attempt to solve the problem of the missing term as it is to the ancient anomalous character of sexuality itself in mythical solutions to the problem of original oneness: 2i. Homoeroticism is the most obvious of the taboo sexual relationships identified by readers. But the sexual ambiguity of Geraldine's nature leads to complex analyses of the significance of the act performed on Christabel. See, for example, Nethercot's vampirism (The Road to Tryermaine, pp. 77-78) and Norman Fruman's exploration in his The Damaged Archangel of the relationships between Coleridge's troubled responses to sexuality and his expression of these in his poetry. More schematically, Fields traces the "force of the incest fear" in the scene between Geraldine and Christabel to Coleridge's "actual or fantasied witnessing of the primal scene" (Reality's Dark Dream, pp. 79-80). 22. In an earlier version, Coleridge described Geraldine's mark as "lean and old and foul of hue." This sight is recalled, although in different terms, at the very moment Sir Leoline takes Geraldine in his arms and she meets his embrace, "Prolonging it with joyous look" (Pt. 1, 1. 450; CPW, 1, 230). The symmetry of these relationships is thereby estab lished as is their ambiguous and taboo sexual character.</page><page sequence="16">390 JANE A. NELSON And lo! the worker of these harms, That holds the maiden in her arms, Seems to slumber still and mild, As a mother with her child. (Conclusion to Pt. i, 11. 298-301; CPW, 1, 226) At the end of Part 11, moreover, Sir Leoline leads forth the lady Geraldine in a ritual gesture that most readers interpret as a rejection of Christabel, but which most clearly suggests a replacing of the mother figure. True, both attempts to replace the missing terms of the initial homology are anomalous, even monstrous, but their monstrosity results in part from the incestuous nature of the resolution to the original lack. To pursue the issue: Geraldine is by no means a stranger to the familial relationships I have indicated as dominant in the poem, nor is she an outsider except in a special sense.23 If Geraldine is perceived as a counterpart of Chris tabel, her role as "mother" in The Conclusion to Part 1 and subsequent "replacing" of Christabel with Sir Leoline at the end, suggest in fact an incestuous development in attempts to solve the problem of the union of opposites. Geraldine is, as we have seen, "generated" by Christabel. Her appearance, moreover, as Coleridge put the poem together, is necessary for Sir Leoline's recognition that the rift between himself and Lord Roland must be mended. But Geraldine identifies herself as Lord Roland's daughter, that is, she also marks in the "logic" of the poem her issue from the male counterpart of Leoline. Consequently, she bears the relationships of "daughter" and "niece" to Leoline, providing yet another reason for our mixed responses to the implications of his leading forth the "tall lady" Geraldine. Yet the puzzle cannot be "solved" except incestuously (and of course it cannot be "solved," finally, at all). In this respect, a comparison of the poem's structures with those isolated by Leach in his analysis of Genesis, is, I think, helpful. Leach identifies the problem of generation as a constant in myths that deal with rules of incest and exogamy: "How was it in the beginning? If our first parents were persons of two kinds, what was that other kind? But if they were both of our kind, then their relations must have been incestuous and we are all born in sin" (p. 10). 23. She comes into the castle from the ^outside," and the castle walls are obviously an attempt to exclude the external, "natural" world suggested by the woods and the oak hung with mistletoe. But her link with the essentially human as well as the mysteriously charged pagan and phallic powers of the mistletoe is established by her account of her parentage. Granted, in some literal sense one does not have to "believe" her account, but it is "she" who introduces the familial elaborations into the poem since her "father" is a "brother" figure for Sir Leoline.</page><page sequence="17">ENTELECHY AND STRUCTURE IN ''CHRISTABEL" 391 Leach also points out the persistence of the conviction in mythologies that unity in Paradise becomes duality in this world, and myth seeks to mediate the dualities developed. The figure of Eve is anomalous to the earlier opposition of Man versus Animal, and hence a mediator between these categories; but as a "final mediation . . . the Serpent, a creeping thing, is anomalous to the opposition Man versus Woman" (p. 14)?a development that explains, Leach believes, the frequent identification of Eve and the Serpent. And in order for procreation to occur, sexuality was introduced into Paradise. A return to the nonsexual world where all-is-one, the blissful child world of the psychoanalyst's oral fantasy, is, of course, impossible. In Coleridge's poem, nevertheless, the narrative attempts to find a unifying term that denies the separations and divisions of human experience. At best it can offer only the issue of human sexuality?the one made from two. Hence we have the unstable "fairy" figure of the child that appears in the coda to the poem like those abrupt, apparently unmotivated (in the sense of conventional literary narrative) conclusions to numerous non-literary myths. Later conceptualizing of this problem in Coleridge's writing pursues these issues and demonstrates an important preoccupa tion with the question of polarities and unity. For the poet-turned philosopher, the concept of polarity, Owen Barfield argues, is seminal.24 The duality of opposite forces is for Coleridge "the manifestation of prior unity" (p. 35). Coleridge also insisted, as Barfield points out, that "polar opposites" generate each other?and are "together generative of a new product" (p. 36). Since Levi-Strauss's "mythic thinking" could be de scribed as a pre-conceptual thinking-in-images, one is strongly tempted to see in Coleridge's poetry the pre-conceptual "mythic" adumbrations of what he later expresses in "philosophic" terms in his Treatise on Logic and elsewhere. This temptation is especially strong when one learns the details of Coleridge's arguments and recognizes that his insistence on thinking as process, not as product (thought), has affinities with Levi Strauss's descriptions of mythic thinking. The analysis I have offered of the relationships between Geraldine and Christabel and the systematic generation of aspects of one figure by the other suggests the earlier "mythical" exploration of Coleridge's "generative interpenetration" of polar opposites essential to the reconciliation of opposites. But this is not the place to pursue Coleridge's complex speculations on polar logic nor on polarity as a universal principle except to indicate his conceptual isolation of the problems raised figuratively in "Christa 24.

Moreover the mediating function ofthe child figure in The Con clusion to Part ii needs further comment. This figure fulfills in several respects the requirements of a mediating term, given the exploration of opposites in the poem that has as its focus a fundamental opposition of male and female, an initial "lack" of suitable sexual partners for the original male and female figures presented, a familial complex of op positions, and a regenerative sexual component.25 This conclusion is "true" whether the child is read as a collection of signifying motifs or as a single complex figure. As a figure, it reproduces within itself (and is capable of generating) the antithetical terms confronted by the nar rative. Sexless (in the poem), it is the one-from-two that unites tem porarily the male and female of the parental opposition, and it is only quasi-human, an elf and fairy in the poem's words: A little child, a Umber elf, Singing, dancing to itself, A fairy thing with red round cheeks, That always finds, and never seeks. (Conclusion to Pt. n, 11. 656-59; CPW, 1, 235) (Coleridge's Theory of Life argues that on the organic level the "central phenomenon" that reveals the law of polarity is reproduction [Bar field, p. 53].) As a mediating term, the child figure is anticipated in the operations of Part 1?in the transformations of the "union" of Geral dine and Christabel into "mother and child." In the ambivalence of parental response and the sexual promise of the child, only temporar ily asexual, we find the recognition of the persistence of division in our world. Such an ending is, of course, abrupt and "unmotivated" in the usual sense of narrative. At first glance its only connection to the text is 25. A striking parallel may be found in Jung's analyses of the functions of the child figure in the relationships among mythological motifs in psychopathology and alchemy. This figure may appear in dreams as the dreamer's son or daughter, but its function is to unite "the opposites; [it is] a mediator, bringer of healing, that is, one who makes whole." The child is the "irrational third" term in a conflict situation; out of the collision of opposites "the unconscious psyche always creates a third thing of an irrational nature, which the conscious mind neither expects nor understands." The child is a symbol that contains the opposites, but mediates between them?in effect, a mediating term (The Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious, Vol. ix, Part I of The Collected Works [New York: Pantheon Books, Inc., 1959], pp. 159-81. Of course Jung's explanation of this phenom enon as part of a psychological process is in other respects quite different. Although his insistence on the "binary" operation of the mind pervades his studies of mythological motifs in psychopathology, it receives less attention than his more rigid formulations. It should be noticed that his "mediating terms" frequently suggest the anomalous categories in myth that have interested structuralists.</page><page sequence="19">ENTELECHY AND STRUCTURE IN "CHRISTABEL" 393 vaguely thematic, not structural, in spite of the fact that the union of Christabel and Geraldine (so grotesque in conventional terms) results so strikingly in the analogy between a sleeping mother and her child. Yet it is the inevitable "mediating" term for the oppositions presented and indeed the term which suitably results from the narrative opera tions introduced at the beginning of the poem. Since an original lost unity is presupposed in Coleridge's (and the Bible's) contemplation of the division of the world into male and fe male, the ancient incestuous resolution is the inevitable conclusion to the problem to be solved: Adam and Eve are of one kind. All men are "brothers," all women "sisters," all women the daughters of Adam, all men the sons of Eve. Man is divided into men and into fratricidal brothers. (Leach equates Cain's fratricide with Adam's incest.26) Re union of opposites is the problem posed in Parts I and n, but it cannot occur without the introduction of sexuality into the relationships per ceived. The serpentine Geraldine, an apparent outsider, enables the "resolution" to occur, but only after the problem is confronted twice: once on the level of the "children" (Cain, Abel, Geraldine, Christabel); next on the "parental" level by the substitution of a more acceptable (more "distant," less incestuous) Geraldine for the nubile Christabel. The abrupt "appearance" of a child image in which the opposites unite?temporarily?is the resolution of the puzzle and the conclusion to the poem. The problem haunts Coleridge elsewhere and endlessly, but a continuation of the narrative of "Christabel" would not be necessary. The poem is complete. Northeastern University 26. In this reading Cain's sin is also "incestuous homosexuality" (Leach, p. 15).</page></plain_text>
