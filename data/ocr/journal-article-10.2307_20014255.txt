<plain_text><page sequence="1">American Philosophical Quarterly Volume 25, Number 4, October 1988 META-COMPATIBILISM Richard Double A NY satisfactory discussion of the compatibility *** of determinism and free will must address the question of the compatibility of determinism and moral responsibility, since the latter bears heavily on how we view ourselves and others. In this paper I show how someone who rejects ethical cog nitivism1 has a rather simple argument for some? thing close to compatibilism at hand. Such a pos? ition, which I call "meta-compatibilism" because it is based on a meta-ethical view, maintains not only that determinism and moral responsibility are compatible, but that both ascriptions of and exon? erations from moral responsibility are compatible with respect to agents for the same action, given the nature of moral responsibility. In the first sec? tion I sketch the meta-compatibilist argument and in the second I consider how this view may be resisted. Although I admit the hypothetical nature of my argument for meta-compatibilism, I attempt to show its strength by indicating how it solves a riddle that helps fuel the free will problem. I. The Case for Meta-Compatibilism To say that a sentence has a truth-value is to say that it is either true or false. To say that moral responsibility-ascriptions2 such as (M) ("5 is mor? ally responsible for action a") have truth-values is to say that (M) is either true or false. Such ascrip? tions seem to need truth-values in order to serve in the truth-functional sentences that figure in dis? cussions of compatibilism. This is evinced by the central incompatibilist claim that one is morally responsible for one's actions only if one has free will. For instance, van In wagen claims: if moral responsibility exists, then someone is morally responsible for something he has done or for some? thing he has left undone ... to be morally responsi? ble .. . is to have free will. Therefore, if no one has free will, moral responsibility does not exist, (van In wagen, p. 162.) Thus, it seems that the usual debate between in compatibilists and compatibilists presupposes that moral-responsibility-ascriptions have truth values. To address that assumption requires an account of the meaning of (M). This is usually given in terms of appropriateness or legitimacy, that is, whether the subject is appropriately or legitimately subject to praise, blame, etc. (Fischer, 1986, p. 12; Glover, 1970, p. 19). These are paradigms of moral notions. As Frankena points out: to say that X was responsible for Y is to say something like "It would be right to hold X responsible for Y and to blame or otherwise punish him." (p. 72.) So, it appears that if ascriptions such as (M) are to have truth-values, then for at least one subset of evaluative notions, ethical cognitivism must be true. The problem is that it is difficult to see how ethical cognitivism could be true. The argument for meta-compatibilism is this: (a) Moral-responsibility-ascriptions such as (M), although having the grammatical appearance of being truth-valued and although believed to be truth-valued by those who express them, are neither true nor false. (b) Therefore, sentences like (M) cannot enter into the truth-functional compounds that constitute the compatibilism discussion. It is strictly false to say that moral responsibility and determinism are incompati? ble; it is alsostrictly false to say these are compatible if this is taken to imply that they both may be true. Since moral-responsibility-ascriptions are neither true nor false, neither the claims of traditional incom patibilists nor compatibilists can be true. (c) Though lacking in truth-values, such ascriptions serve, collectively, to convey attitudes that the ascriber holds or believes that humanity at large holds towards agents. The attitude conveyed by affirming (M) has been called the "agent" or "subjective" perspective; that conveyed by denying (M) may be conveyed either globally as the "observer" or "objective" perspective, or it may be an attitude of local exoneration owing to special circumstances (the agent didn't know what he was doing, etc. . . .). 323</page><page sequence="2">324 AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY (d) At this point meta-compatibilism divides into a hard and soft line depending on whether the meta-com patibilist believes that attitudes can be more or less reasonable. The hard liners argue that since there is no objective property of moral responsibility at stake, all moral-responsibility-ascriptions are equally reason? able. The idea here is that without truth, there can be no standard of reasonability for attitudes and all attitudes are equally good. The soft liners hold that although moral-responsibility-ascriptions are neither true nor false, some ascriptions are more reasonable than others. The soft liners maintain, though, that there can be cases where two conflicting attitudes are both reasonable. When such cases arise, if there is no objective property to which such attitudes conform or fail to conform, then the reasonableness of one attitude cannot count against the reasonableness of an another. Since the attitudes of moral-responsibility-fixing and moral-responsibility-exoneration fall into this class, the soft liners, like the hard liners, conclude that there is no general incompatibilist or compatibilist solution possible. The most important premise for meta-com? patibilism is the claim that moral-responsibility ascriptions are not truth-valued, and I shall not try to establish that, given that it would require a book length treatment. So, in this sense my argument for meta-compatibilism is at best hypothetical. If pressed to defend the noncognitivist premise, I would suggest that moral-responsibility-ascriptions purport to ascribe a property that turns out not to exist, simply because there are no moral properties (see Mackie, 1977, p. 38). But in fact, one could support (a) with any noncognitivist consideration one chose. The obvious point to be made in behalf of (a) in this paper is that no one has ever figured out how moral statements could have truth-values. Thus, all one has to do to refute meta-compatibilism is provide a cognitivist solution to the problem of meta-ethics. But the case seems similar to existen? tial claims, where although one cannot conclude that a putative entity does not exist simply because it has been so far undiscovered, it seems that the burden of proof lies on those who assert its exist? ence. Likewise, the burden of proof seems to me to lie on those who adopt cognitivism.3 Step (c), the premise that moral-responsibility ascriptions convey attitudes towards persons' responsibility is supportable by considering the contexts in which speakers discuss responsibility. As noted earlier, we care about moral responsibility because our decision on whether we can ascribe it or not profoundly affects how we view ourselves and others. Its ascription reveals our personal, "reactive" attitudes towards the ascribee, while a categorical denial of responsibility shows that we feel persons are less complete?less fully human? than commonsense holds. We may not feel passion? ately every time we affirm or deny responsibility, but our willingness to ascribe responsibility at all shows that we have a radically different attitude towards persons than we would if we refused to make such ascriptions. So, while admitting the individual premises are not entirely air-tight, I shall sketch why I like the argument. The meta-compatibilist believes that the incompatibilist mistakes an unfavorable subjective reaction to the thesis of determinism for an actual characteristic of determinism per se. Consider the following illustration. I recently had lunch with a friend who claimed that her need for warmth and love made her less self-sufficient than she would be without such needs, and, thus, demeaned her human dignity. My friend did not single herself out for criticism in this respect, admitting that such needs were practically universal, perhaps ulti? mately biologically grounded, and at any rate out of her control. Nonetheless, my friend insisted that she was lessened, demeaned by these needs. When I suggested that one might argue that, despite the reduction of self-sufficiency, one is not demeaned by such needs, but enriched or even ennobled by them ("People who need people . . ."), my friend admitted that although someone could conclude this, she felt demeaned anyway. The meta-compatibilist thinks that drawing the unhappy conclusion that we lack moral responsi? bility from the premise of determinism is like my friend's conclusion that our need for love demeans us. Incompatibilism represents an attitude, a pessi? mistic reaction to the supposition of determinism. (In a well-known article P. F. Strawson uses the terms "optimist" and "pessimist" in place of the us? ual "compatibilist" and "incompatibilist" labels (P. Strawson, 1962)). Conflicting attitudes rather than truth-valued beliefs are not only logically possible with respect to the same object, but to the extent that</page><page sequence="3">META-COMPATIBILISM 325 attitudes may be reasonable at all, they may be rea? sonably held towards the same entity if one attends to different facts or looks at the same facts in dif? ferent ways. One may be reasonably optimistic and pessimistic regarding the same thing. Consider what Strawson calls the "personal" per? spective which involves the "reactive attitudes" such as indignation, resentment, gratitude, and shame that we typically associate with moral responsibility. Compare these to the attitude suggested by those who deny that responsibility exists?the so-called "objective" perspective?that exonerates all persons of the reactive attitudes. Unlike Strawson, who defends the "optimistic" acceptance of the personal attitudes at the expense of the objectivist view, the meta-compatibilist sees the possibility of a compatibility between holding reactive attitudes towards a subject and holding the attitude of exoneration. For instance, being indig? nant towards S and feeling sorry for S because 5 is a victim of "moral luck" may be reasonable attitudes to hold at the same time. This will not seem true, if one thinks that holding reactive attitudes towards an agent and exonerating that agent presuppose contradictory assumptions. For instance, one might think that the following conflict: (i) I reasonably resent you for a only if I believe that you could have avoided doing a. (ii) I reasonably exonerate your from all reactive attitudes regarding a only if I believe that you could not have avoided doing a. But these two do not conflict, and we can see this by appreciating what is valuable in com? patibilist hypothetical analyses of "could." I may reasonably resent your action provided you planned and rationally endorsed a and had control over your desire to do a in the compatibilist hypothetical sense of being able to avoid a if you had chosen to. If you satisfy a stringent rationality account of free will (Frankfurt, 1971; Double, 1987) in such a way that a reflects who you are and who you wish to be, then resentment is warrantable, irrespective of whether your carefully planned decisions can be traced back deterministically. After all, these are still your decisions even if you are not ultimately responsible for the sort of person you are. At the same time, however, it would be reasonable for me to take an opposing attitude towards you. I could elect to view you from the global perspective (Hospers, 1961; Waller, 1987) and decide that since you are not your own ultimate cause, I feel sorry for you for becoming the sort of person who would do a in a fully self-conscious, reflective way. That is, I may reasonably hold the attitude of total exon? eration towards you because you categorically could not have done, or been, otherwise than you did or were. So, the meta-compatibilist feels the attraction of both the traditional compatibilistic and incompatibilistic views. Of course, my suggestion will not seem plausible if you think that moral responsibility is a unified property for which there is only one correct account. In that case we would have to choose between hypo? thetical and categorical accounts, just as the dispu? tants in the free will debate usually assume that they must with those hypothetical and categorical ac? counts. But once you give up the assumption that moral responsibility is an objective property, there is no conflict between the hypothetical and cate? gorical accounts, since we are now doing the "moral phenomenology" of our responsibility-attitudes rather than trying to analyze an objective concept. Such ambivalent attitudes are disconcerting and it is natural to take this as indicative of an objective tension. The meta-compatibilist, however, thinks that the tension is merely psychological since most of us wish to be of "one mind" regarding our atti? tudes as we do our beliefs. One might say that such ambivalent attitudes, no less than conflicting beliefs, are cognitively dissonant. In reflecting upon a moral monster like Hitler, the condemnatory and excul? patory attitudes vie for our attention in rapid succes? sion like the two interpretations of Wittgenstein's duck-rabbit4 As with the duck-rabbit, neither inter? pretation is correct to the exclusion of the other, since the same objective stimulus has the power to evoke different reactions depending on how we attend to it. II. Some Objections In this section I consider seven objections to meta-compatibilism from various directions.</page><page sequence="4">326 AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY The simplest form of objection would be to ignore the issue raised by meta-compatibilism: Let the meta-ethicists worry about the truth-value of moral-responsibility-ascriptions: I don't have to. We certainly believe that people are sometimes morally responsible for their actions, and that belief is all that is needed to raise the incompatibility issue. If one waited upon a meta-ethical solution before one embarked on normative ethics, one could never under? take the latter. It is doubtful, though, that ignoring the objection is any more appropriate in this case than in any other philosophical instance. To admit the subjec? tive nature of moral-responsibility-ascriptions is not, ipso facto, to give up demanding reasoned grounds for their application, since a noncognitivist regarding moral properties per se can still do nor? mative ethics. The soft liners do admit that we can reasonably talk about moral responsibility. Moreover, the fact that a philosophical claim runs contrary to prephilosophical belief is never a phil? osophical reason to reject it, even if one could imagine scenarios where it would be morally obligatory to reject it (e.g., if accepting the subjec? tivity of moral responsibility would turn one into a moral cretin). A second objection is from the cognitivist. As noted earlier, all the cognitivist needs to do to reject meta-compatibilism is to show that cognitivism is true. Short of attempting that, one can imagine a cognitivist claiming that cognitivism of moral responsibility-ascriptions is supported by common sense. For instance, Galen Strawson claims that "we are deeply committed to the belief that people can be truly responsible for what they do" (G. Strawson, 1986, p. 90). To call this a belief is to suggest that moral responsibility ascriptions have truth-values, since in general to say "5 believes that p" seems to presuppose that p may be either true or false. This is not evidence for the truth-valued interpre? tation, however, if we can provide an alternative wording that captures what is true regarding how people feel about moral responsibility while remaining neutral on the truth-value question. Sup? pose we rewrite Strawson's claim as "We typically hold people truly responsible for what they do." This seems to capture what is correct in Strawson's claim without creating a bias towards viewing "morally responsible" as an objective predicate, since holding responsible does not presuppose that someone is responsible any more than finding someone to be loathsome presupposes the objective existence of the property of loathsomeness. A third objection would be to extend noncogni tivism ("anti-realism") in ethics to our theory of the world in general, claiming in a Deweyian fashion that the good, true, and beautiful are all simply that which is ultimately conducive to human interests. On this tack, moral-responsibility-ascriptions are devices we use to organize our lives (and the lives around us) in order to live more successfully: we should not worry if they lack truth-values, since all claims lack truth-values in the realistic sense. There are two replies here. First, the flight to anti realism in general would be an enormous price to pay in order to put moral judgments on a par with non-moral ones, and would be justifiable only on the strongest general anti-realism arguments. Of course, anti-realism in general may be correct. But, second, if it were, then meta-compatibilism is not hurt, since (i) there is no reason to think that atti? tudes assessed in terms of their ultimate conducive ness to human interests necessarily conflict with each other or with the adoption of the determinist hypothesis, and (ii) if no statements have truth values, then incompatibility becomes impossible. So, if we renounce realistic truth, then we should be even more sympathetic to meta-compatibilism. A fourth objection is a modus tollens argument against the hard version of meta-compatibilism, which applies, mutatis mutandis, to the soft version: (a) If moral-responsibility-ascriptions are not sub? ject to being more or less reasonable, then one could make an equally good case for the ascriptions and denials of responsibility in all cases. For instance, if "this tastes good" is an unwarrantable subjective claim, then one can argue equally for and against it in all cases. (b) But one cannot make equally good cases for and against moral-responsibility-ascriptions in all cases. For instance, there are clear cases where nobody would think that someone is morally re? sponsible for an action, for example, if the agent were three years old. Or, for attitudes in general, in the earlier example surely my friend would be</page><page sequence="5">META-COMPATIBILISM 327 unreasonable if she held that she was demeaned by her need for oxygen. To amend this argument to ap? ply to the soft version of meta-compatibilism, simply rewrite premise (a) to read: "If moral-responsibility ascriptions are neither true nor false, then one could make an equally good case for the ascriptions and denials of responsibility in all cases." The meta-compatibilist should resist (a) in both forms, since it is false that the subjectivity of moral responsibility-ascriptions implies that they may be used with complete promiscuity. The meta compatibilist realizes that there are purely concep? tual limitations on the apt application of responsibil? ity. For instance, there are conceptual limitations on the applicability of a pejorative term such as "a jerk." Only human beings past a certain age may be jerks; a dog that eats another pet's food cannot be said to be a jerk without overt anthropomorphism. For all this, "jerk" is a paradigm of an attitudinal word that lacks truth-value and over which a debate concerning the warrant of its application, given its conceptual constraints, would be frivolous. Like? wise, meta-compatibilism recognizes that individ? uals may elect their own idiosyncratic preconditions for the application of attitudinal terms. A traditional compatibilist such as Hobart might opt for rational determinism, while a libertarian such as Kane might demand contra-causal freedom. Yet this goes no way towards establishing the reasonableness of the resulting ascriptions; I might judge persons loath? some if they ever voted for Ronald Reagan. For all this, "moral responsibility," like "loathsome" is not elevated out of the realm of the merely attitudinal. A fifth objection is: Since meta-compatibilism claims that there is no objective property of moral responsibility, it entails that no one is responsible. But this is just hard deter? minism, not a species of compatibilism, which says that responsibility exists, or at least, can exist. We reply that although meta-compatibilism is not a species of traditional compatibilism, it is sig? nificantly different than theories that deny moral responsibility, whether hard determinism or the dis? junctive view that either determinism or indeter minism would make responsibility impossible. Hard determinism relies on the familiar incom? patibilist intuition "How can you really be morally responsible if determinism is true?" The disjunctive view is based on this intuition, plus the Hobart-like intuition "How can you be responsible for an uncaused decision?" The meta-compatibilist recog? nizes the attractiveness of these intuitions, but also feels the pull of the compatibilist view that if our decisions are sufficiently rational, then we are responsible irrespective of determinism. So, you might say, meta-compatibilism tries to co-opt the intuitions of a wide range of traditional thinkers. The distinctive thing about meta-compatibilism is that it refuses to opt for any of these intuitions to the exclusion of the others. The meta-compatibilist is genuinely torn among these and resolves that tension by subjectivizing responsibility. A sixth objection sees the meta-compatibilist as vulnerable to the utilitarian/justice objection that befalls any theory that denies that people are morally responsible. For instance, if hard determinism were true, then we are not morally responsible for any? thing and do not deserve to be held morally respon? sible for our actions. Thus, the only grounds for holding people morally responsible would be the utility of doing so, not the fact that they are respon? sible, and thus ushers in the scapegoating counter? examples that trouble utilitarian ethics. For instance, in a case where we must decide whether to hold morally responsible the person who actually per? formed an action or an observer who did not, our de? cision would have to be made on the basis of con? siderations other than whether the person deserves the ascription of responsibility, given that neither the agent nor observer is morally responsible. And this, it seems, is morally repellent, not only for hard determinism, but for meta-compatibilism as well. I think that this is a problem, not only for meta compatibilism, but for any species of compatibilism that interprets moral responsibility in such a way that it must be justified in terms of consequences (Smart, 1961; Dennett, 1984). An uncompromising response given by the hard liners would be to admit that if noncognitivism in ethics is true, then we sim? ply have to accept the logical possibility of morally repellent scenarios, since ethical judgments can be no more than evolutionarily and socially conditioned attitudes. This simply underscores the enormous importance of justifying ethical cognitivism. The unhappy results of accepting the subjectivity of</page><page sequence="6">328 AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY moral responsibility would be part-and-parcel of the outcome of accepting ethical noncognitivism in general. A more conciliatory view, taken by the soft-liners, would be that meta-compatibilism allows for the reasonability of moral-responsibility-attitudes, viz., those justified by the compatibilist view that sufficient rationality in one's decision-making warrants responsibility-ascriptions. That is, the soft liners can avail themselves of the previously sketched intuition that an agent who meets the rationality criteria of free will deserves the attitudes of praise and blame in the strongest sense. It is true, of course, that soft-line meta-compatibilists would acknowledge the reasonableness of the incompati? bilist attitude in favor of the complete exoneration of all agents. But there remains an asymmetry be? tween the agent who performed a given act and an observer who did not, inasmuch as the former is subject to the intuition that warrants responsibility ascriptions, while the latter is not. A final objection is that if ascriptions of moral re? sponsibility are merely subjective, then so are ascrip? tions of free will, since the same sort of consider? ations the meta-compatibilist provides apply to free will. But, surely "free will" is an objective notion. Our reply is disjunctive. Either "free will" is ana? lytically connected to "moral responsibility" or it is not. If it is not, then it is at least in theory possible to give an account of free will in non-normative terms, and the arguments adduced in favor of meta-com? patibilism will not apply to free will. If, on the other hand, "free will" is analytically connected to "moral responsibility" (e.g., "one decides d freely if and only if one is morally responsible for d'), then "free will" will be a normative notion and, hence, subject to the considerations given in this paper. So, "free will" may be defined independently of moral responsibility, in which case its objectivity does not count against the meta-compatibilist thesis regarding responsibility, or it may be defined in terms of moral responsibility, in which case it should be subject to the subjectivity argument. III. Conclusion I have argued that unless one adopts cognitivism regarding moral responsibility, one must view the debate between incompatibilists and compatibilists as ill-conceived, because either (a) all moral responsibility-attitudes are equally good (the hard line) or (b) conflicting attitudes regarding the same actions are often both reasonable (the soft line). Both approaches enjoy the advantage of appearing to re? solve the otherwise recalcitrant problem of the con? flict between personal and objective perspectives. At one point Nagel seems almost on the verge of viewing free will similarly to the way that the meta compatibilist views moral responsibility. He says that the problem of free will ... is rather a bafflement of our feelings and attitudes?a loss of confidence, con? viction or equilibrium .... the problem of free will lies in the erosion of interpersonal attitudes and the sense of autonomy. (1986, p. 112.) The meta-compatibilist thinks that this sort of in? sight, if pressed, solves the compatibility issue.5 Indiana-Purdue University at Fort Wayne Received February 2, 1988 NOTES 1. By "ethical cognitivism" I mean simply the view that moral judgments have truth-values, without presupposing that they are in fact known or are even knowable. Nagel uses the term "moral realism" as I use the former term (Nagel, 1986, pp. 138-149). Other near-synonyms include "ethical absolutism" and "ethical objectivism." 2. "Moral-responsibility-ascriptions" is short for "putative ascriptions of moral responsibility." The point is to have a term that is neutral with respect to the issue of whether moral responsibility is an objective property of agents. The rationale is the same for "moral-responsibility-attitudes. "</page><page sequence="7">META-COMPATIBILISM 329 3. Nagel thinks the burden of proof is on the noncognitivist because "we" tend to be cognitivists prephilosophically (Nagel, 1986, p. 143). 4. Compare with the following observation: We may be able temporarily to view William Calley ... as a phenomenon?a repulsive and dangerous bit of the zoosphere? without condemning him .... But it is next to impossible to remain in the attitude of inability to condemn Lieutenant Calley for the murders at My Lai: our feelings return before the ink of the argument is dry.
