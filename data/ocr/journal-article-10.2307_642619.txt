It is noticeable at once that the elements of prediction and control are largely absent from Greek speculation, and this is due partly to certain of its inherent characteristics (to which I return in a moment), and partly to its lack of three further particular features which are an essential part of the natural sciences today. These are briefly that they are experimental, quantitative, and laboratory-based. This generalization is, of course, at once too wide and too narrow. Not all scientific theories rely on experiment in the narrow sense or on laboratory operations; the observations of the astronomer and the activi- ties of the field-biologist can, up to a point, dispense with both. But it remains true that the experimental test and the laboratory and its instruments are essential elements in modern science, and neither the astronomer nor the biologist can in the last resort dispense with them. Similarly, quantitative measurement plays an indispensable role in the physical sciences and is the basis on which they have been built up, even though the theoretical physicist may spend little time measuring or experimenting and be mainly concerned with the mathematical analysis which is so vital an element in modern physical theory. Even with these qualifications, my description of the activities of the physical scientist is no doubt very oversimplified; it underemphasizes, for example, the role of mathematics in much of physical theory. But if it is granted that the features I have mentioned are indispensable elements of present-day scientific activity, they do enable us to say more clearly what we mean by a science-based technology. We mean a technology that either originates in or is guided by the laboratory-based operations of the physical scientist. But they also make it clear that the speculations of the Greek philosophers were in this sense hardly scien- tific at all. They had no laboratories and the most primitive of instru- ments (I return to this point later); with a few exceptions, they did little I This article is continued from Greece &amp; Rome xx, I (April, 1973).</page><page sequence="2">SCIENCE, PHILOSOPHY, AND TECHNOLOGY: II 181 quantitative measurement; and though they were not unaware of the importance of empirical evidence for theories, they had no real con- ception of the experimental method as it is understood today.' These limitations (which must be considered in more detail later) are in part, as I have already suggested, due to the nature of the theories they put forward. This may be described in a phrase by saying that they were rational but not scientific. The Milesians are often said to have brought something new into human thought. And so they did. But it was not, in J. Burnet's words 'scientific cosmology', and we merely confuse ourselves and blur the real distinction between their way of thinking and that of their predecessors and of their successors in the modern world if we think of it as 'scientific'. Their novelty was not to be scientific but to be rational. What this means can best be described negatively. They were the first to produce an account of the origin of the physical world and its constitution without including any element of myth, or any overtly anthropomorphic or animistic features. I say 'overtly' because behind some of their concepts there still lurk more primitive notions, as there do often behind some of the concepts of the modern physicist (for example, that of force). And the fact that they all give an account of the origin of the physical world shows that they were concerned to 'demythologize' earlier cosmogonies such as those of Hesiod rather than to give an account and explanation of particular natural processes; they were led on to give such explanations in the process of rationalization, but it was not what they started from. Their cosmology, therefore, is no longer set out in terms of a conflict between gods or of the processes of animal reproduction. They may perhaps have derived this idea of the orderliness of nature in part from the pattern of the Olympic hierarchy. The Olympians form an ordered society and between them control various natural processes and areas of the cosmos -Zeus controls the sky, and Poseidon the sea. But the Olympians are also responsible for a great deal of arbitrary interference. As E. R. Dodds has shownz the gods are commonly thought of as responsible for the unusual and the exceptional-compare our own legal phrase 'Act of God'. If Hector is defeated by Achilles, so great a fall, so great a disaster is to be accounted for not simply because Achilles is a better fighter, or fights better on the day, but by divine interference. It is just this element of arbitrary interference by gods or, through magic of various kinds, by humans, that the early Greek philosophers eliminated. For them the natural world is a regular and rational system with 'unchanging ways of its own', ways which are ascertainable by human reason but not x Cf. W. A. Heidel, Hippocratic Medicine (New York, 1941), 103: the 'thorough- going application of the experimental method is of recent growth.' 2 The Greeks and the Irrational (Berkeley, 1951), ch. I.</page><page sequence="3">182 SCIENCE, PHILOSOPHY, AND TECHNOLOGY: II subject to arbitrary interruption. The interruptions that appear to break in on the orderly sequences of human life, such as storm, light- ning, and flood, are the outcome of natural processes, not divine wrath. This new conception has been called the discovery of Nature. It was a great step forward. It was a necessary stage on the way to science, but was not yet science itself, and the best way, perhaps, to describe it is to use the old phrase natural philosophy instead of natural science.' How far they were from natural science as we understand it can be seen by considering the governing analogies which the Greeks used in explaining the demythologized nature which they had 'discovered'. All the sciences use analogies, or as they are more usually called today, models, to a greater or less extent. The essential feature of analogy is the use of a familiar process to explain one that is unfamiliar (or an observed process to explain one that is unobserved). Examples are the wave-model and the particle-model both used today in atomic physics. A model can, and a good model should, suggest or explain further features in the phenomena being considered, and it must, in any event, point to definite empirical tests the failure of which will falsify it. There is a further complication in modern physics caused by the use of mathematical models. This, in effect, substitutes for the more familiar, everyday process used in analogy a set of mathematical formulae which explain and predict the phenomena observed but whose precise physical significance is a matter of argument. But though the Greeks were aware in general terms of the relevance of mathematics to the explanation of natural processes, and though they made some progress in mathematical explanations in some fields, anything in the nature of a mathematical model in the modern sense was so far outside their experience that this complication can be ignored. In considering the analogies and models they did use we can well start by asking how far these were what we should call 'mechanical' or 'mechanistic', and what in any event we mean by using these terms, as we often do without explanation. When we use them we undoubtedly mean to exclude any analogy of an animistic, anthropomorphic, or teleological kind; and, more positively, we probably imply that the phenomena we are considering can be explained simply in terms of matter-in-motion. And if asked further what we mean by that we are likely to point to the science of mechanics as it has developed since Galileo's day. This is a fair enough initial answer, and though the Greeks had only a very elementary idea of mechanics (a point to which we shall return), they did within limits make use of mechanical x Cf. Heidel, The Heroic Age of Science (Baltimore, 1933), I: 'we are prone to forget that even a generation ago it was customary to give the name of Natural Philosophy to textbooks which would now be entitled treatises on physics.'</page><page sequence="4">SCIENCE, PHILOSOPHY, AND TECHNOLOGY: II 183 analogies in this sense. A number of the Presocratics (notably Anaxa- goras and the Atomists) used the analogy of a whirl or eddy in water to explain the arrangement of matter in the universe, though, as Dr. Hesse has pointed out, they used it both to expain how heavy bodies gravitate to the centre and how sun and planets were thrown out to the circum- ference by centrifugal force;' Democritus and Plato used analogies from sieve and winnowing fan to explain the sorting out of matter into similar masses; Aristotle used a large number of material-mechanical analogies in, for example, the Meteorologica. But it is worth pressing the question further and asking how important, consciously or uncon- sciously, in the mechanical analogy is what is presumably the source of its name, the machine. The machine is an admirable example of regularity in the material world; it is, normally, made of a number of parts which when set in motion complete some predetermined process. It has had, for the last two hundred years or so, the added advantage of familiarity; machines have become very much part of Western European life and the analogy with them consequently easy to understand. How far does the analogy lie behind earlier uses of the word ? We know that Descartes, one of the principal sources of the 'mechanical philosophy', spoke of describing the Cosmos as 'machinae instar' and that he said that in his description of the material world 'the example of certain bodies made by art was of service to me';2 and we know that the mechanical clock was often used as an example of regular process-the phrase 'as regular as clockwork' survived in common speech until quite recently. It seems therefore as if there was always some overtone of the machine in mechanistic theories of natural processes. But if this is so it is of some relevance to the use of the word to de- scribe Greek theories, because Greeks and Roman shad virtually nothing that we should recognize as a machine at all. When Hero lists what he calls 'machines' he mentions wheel, lever, pulley, wedge, and endless screw. Even if we add the toothed wheel (which the ancients knew and which is used in one or two of Hero's devices) what we have is rather a list of tools or mechanical aids than of machines. And as we have seen, Hero was never able, because of the limitations of ancient technology, to develop them into anything more than toys or temple-tricks. How significant this is is no doubt open to argument. At least it means that when we speak of the Greeks as giving 'mechanical' explanations we should remember that the analogy of the machine, which springs naturally to our minds, could not have sprung to theirs; and I should myself prefer to avoid the term altogether. Anaximander's star wheels, and for that matter Plato's 'Circles' in the Timaeus, are models used to M. B. Hesse, Forces and Fields (London, 1961), 53. 2 Hesse, op. cit. I io.</page><page sequence="5">184 SCIENCE, PHILOSOPHY, AND TECHNOLOGY: II describe the movements of the heavenly bodies; but it would be safer not to call them mechanical.' There is, also, another argument against the use of the term in Greek contexts. For us the regularity of the machine is something impersonal and automatic (we usually conveniently forget that machines were made by men for human purposes); but to the Greeks regularity could be and often was a sign of the operation of intelligence. This dilemma between necessity and design is of course a familiar one. If the processes of nature are regular and orderly we may think on a metaphysical-theological level that this is due either to necessity or to design. But whereas modern physics and mechanics have made their advances since the sixteenth century by abandoning the attempt to interpret particular processes in teleological or anthropomorphic terms,z2 this kind of inter- pretation seemed to the Greeks quite acceptable. They had excluded the arbitrary: but the regular and the rational seemed to them suffi- ciently analogous. Heraclitus' Logos, which steers or guides all things (frs. 41 and 64), whatever its precise meaning, is clearly an analogy drawn from human intelligence; Anaxagoras (fr. 12) says that mind 'controls the whole rotation'. The whole burden of Plato's Timaeus is that the world is the result of intelligent design and subject to intelligent control. To account for the movements of the planets by means of a geometrical model, as Plato did in the Timaeus and as Eudoxus did at Plato's instigation more comprehensively with his doctrine of concentric spheres, was to show that planetary motion followed intelligible prin- ciples. And it is interesting that dvavxyKrl, of which our stock translation is 'necessity', is for Plato and Aristotle not the cause of natural order, but of what we should call inevitable side-effects which may or may not be desirable but which are not an essential part of orderly natural process. Indeed both in Plato and Aristotle ava'yKri is the cause of the random rather than the regular, and at times seems almost synonymous with what we should regard as its opposite, Chance (T-riXr). Aristotle's natural philosophy, again, through his theory of the four causes and his constant analogies with rEXvnl, relies essentially on the analogy of pur- poseful and intelligent activity. We may therefore say that when the Greeks, having excluded the arbitrary from Nature, adopted the concept of a regular and orderly system, they developed it in terms of a very different group of governing analogies from ours. All generalization in so wide a field is hazardous, but we may perhaps classify the Greek analogies under three heads. i. Analogies from the material world, from processes in inanimate nature. The essential element in these is the attempt to explain the Cf. G. E. R. Lloyd, Polarity and Analogy (Cambridge, 1966), 315. 2 Hesse, op. cit. ioI.</page><page sequence="6">SCIENCE, PHILOSOPHY, AND TECHNOLOGY: II 185 remoter or obscurer processes of nature (for example the movements of the heavenly bodies or chemical changes) in terms of processes that are simpler and better-known (eddies in water or the operations of a cork). This type of analogy, as we have seen, is sometimes described as mechanical, and there is some justification for this. Descartes had the same principle in mind when he wrote 'we do much better to judge of what takes place in small bodies--by what we see occurring in those that we do perceive." But, as we have seen, the word mechanical (mechanistic) carries for us overtones which it did not for the Greeks and it is better to call such analogies simply 'material'. Moreover, their analogies from the material world were always liable to two weaknesses. First, they never quite rid themselves of animistic notions; to this point I return in my third heading. Second, their ideas on dynamics remained very elementary. Aristotle has been much criticized for his views on dynamics. But he did try to give a systematic account of motion, and his basic premiss, that if a thing is to move it must be pushed, is typi- cal of the whole ancient approach to the problem. It is of course rationalized into more philosophic terms, such as that all motion requires a cause; but basically it is an analogy from common experience-if you want to move something you have to push it and go on pushing. And though the projectile remained a scandal in this world of imparted motion, there was nothing either in technology or everyday experience to suggest anything to the contrary. 2. The second main type of analogy was that from purposeful human activity, and in particular from the operations of the craftsman. This does not mean the craftsman or man who worked with his hands was particularly highly thought ofz or that those who used analogies of this type had any close experience of the crafts. But there was a great deal of craft activity in the home, and ordinary observation was enough to enable the analogies to be drawn. To some of these analogies I have already referred. The most explicita of them is Plato's Craftsman (8rlltoupy6s) in the Timaeus, the most influential Aristotle's analogy between Nature and Craft operations (TrEXvr1).4 Nature is like a modeller in clay, a good housewife, does nothing in vain. These analogies are formalized in the doctrine of the Four Causes.s It has not often enough been noticed or emphasized that this doctrine is based on analysis of craft activity, and that the activity of the craftsman is the only one which it exactly fits.6 The craftsman needs material, he must shape it I Hesse, op. cit. 109. 2 Lloyd, op. cit. 208 and 292. 3 The Demiurge mixes the soul-stuff, like a cook, rolls it out, as a cook rolls pastry, cuts it into strips, bends these strips into circles and fastens them together. 4 Cf. Lloyd, op. cit. 285. 5 Cf. Lloyd, op. cit. 285 for detail. 6 But see Lloyd, op. cit. 287; Hesse, op. cit. 63.</page><page sequence="7">186 SCIENCE, PHILOSOPHY, AND TECHNOLOGY: II into some predetermined form, this involves moving and arranging the material in certain ways, and the whole process is directed to an end or purpose. The analysis does not properly fit even the biological world, where Aristotle was most fond of applying it; you can find some analogy with the final cause in the animal world in explanation by function, but the mere fact that you have to a large extent to conflate the formal and final cause when the doctrine is applied to biology shows that, though the analogy has its uses, the fit is not perfect. In fact Aristotle applied the doctrine universally, and though teleology is not necessarily un- scientific, it remains true that the search for final causes in areas where they are not appropriate, encouraged by Aristotle, was a hindrance to scientific development. 3. Intelligence, design, and purpose are characteristic of human beings, who are one species of living beings. In a sense therefore my second type of analogy is a subspecies of the third, the analogy from living things. Examples again are ready to hand. The early Ionians are often referred to as hylozoists, because their primal substance has in it the powers of motion and growth which characterize living things: Plato's Cosmos is a living thing with a soul (yu)q') of its own, and indeed for him soul is the originating source of all movement. This analogy from the living thing is no doubt to some extent a relic of an earlier animism which did not distinguish clearly between animate and inani- mate, like the child and the savage who attribute some form of life, per- haps not quite like their own but life none the less, to material objects. But whatever the reason for it, the analogy was one which it seemed quite proper to the Greeks to use and which continued to be influential until the rise of modern physics in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. So it has been said that Descartes's greatest influence on physics was 'his firm elimination from it of mental categories'.' In view of this great difference in its governing analogies (models), it is not surprising if the ancient world developed to only a small extent, if at all, the three characteristics which I have suggested as minimum requirements in present-day science: those of being laboratory-based, quantitative, and experimental. That there was nothing comparable in the ancient world to the modern laboratory hardly needs arguing. The ancients did of course perform a certain number of simple empirical tests, but there was no systematic organization for carrying them out such as is implied by the modern laboratory. Two possible exceptions to this generalization themselves throw some light on the general rule. First, both Aristotle and the medical writers did a certain amount of dissection and must have done it somewhere; and it could be argued I Hesse, op. cit. iii.</page><page sequence="8">SCIENCE, PHILOSOPHY, AND TECHNOLOGY: II 187 that this is the beginning of laboratory work. But medicine is by necessity a practical craft, and the doctors' dissections were more in the nature of an offshoot of a craft-activity than a scientific investigation. The beginnings of alchemy could be regarded as another exception, though alchemy is a latecomer in the ancient world. And within limits the alchemists did need and use something in the nature of a laboratory. They must have been handicapped by the comparatively poor quality of ancient glass, though this improved after the discovery of glass-blowing in the early first century A.D. But their limitations were as much theoretical as practical. Alchemy, it has been said, represents an attempt to combine Greek philosophy with the craft-traditions of the Middle Eastern civilizations.' And the philosophical theory which mainly guided their activities was Aristotle's analysis of matter into four elements which could be virtually transformed into each other. These transformations they attempted to effect artificially, and though they learned a certain amount in the process and gathered some empirical knowledge, the theory on which they worked (with the many accretions it gathered with time) was never one that could lead them to ask the right questions. The Greeks, again, as Heidel has noted, never developed proper quantitative methods. 'Quantitative relations, which can be determined only by experiment, were but rarely investigated and laws capable of mathematical statement were formulated in few fields.'2 The Greeks were of course the first to see the importance of applying mathematics to nature. Modern science may (with a little exaggeration) be said to originate with Pythagoras' discovery that the relation between the notes of the octave could be mathematically expressed; and Greek astronomy after Plato may be said to have been concerned precisely, in Heidel's words, to formulate laws capable of mathematical statement. We can also find traces of mathematical and quantitative treatment in optics3 and in statics (Archimedes). But it is interesting to notice how little in the way of quantitative method there is in Hero's Pneumatica, and the Greeks never attempted to formulate a properly quantitative dynamics -perhaps because they had no accurate method of measuring time. Galileo, it is true, managed without mechanical clocks; but dynamics would not have progressed far after him without them. Again Heidel may have hit on the basic reason when he says 'no human genius can, in a science that requires observation and experiment, pass the limits imposed on him by the available instruments.'4 At this point again David Steele (ed.), The History of Scientific Ideas (London, 1970), I2. 2 The Heroic Age of Science, 193. 3 Lloyd, PCPhS cxc (1964), 55. 4 The Heroic Age of Science, 71.</page><page sequence="9">I88 SCIENCE, PHILOSOPHY, AND TECHNOLOGY: II technology and science interact. We may think that the Greeks could have done a little better in devising instruments; but they were severely limited by the technological resources at their disposal and it is un- reasonable and unhistorical to expect too much. But it is about my third characteristic, experiment, that most con- troversy centres. My own view is that though the Greeks were well aware of the need for empirical tests and the use of proper evidence, they never developed any systematic understanding of the experimental method. Generalization is difficult, because, as Dr. Lloyd has pointed out, they came nearer to experiment in our sense in some fields than in others; but it remains true, as I have expressed it elsewhere, that the experimental method, in any full sense, eluded them. To understand this it is important as a preliminary to distinguish between experiment and observation. The distinction has often been made, but I do not think its force and application have always been noticed, in particular in the field of Greek speculations about Nature. This may be because no very sharp line can be drawn between the two, and controlled obser- vation merges very easily into experiment, which is, so to speak, its lineal descendant. But the resulting ambiguity is one which, as it seems to me, is often exploited, consciously or unconsciously, by those who wish to show that the Greeks were at any rate to some degree familiar with the use of experiment. So Heidel cites as 'throwing light on experimentation as conceived by the Greeks' two stories in Herodotus, one involving the use of a sounding-line to plumb a well, the other (better known) of two children kept from sound of human speech so as to discover from their first utterance what was the oldest and original language. As an illustration of what Herodotus thought was evidence the stories have some point (though he probably had his tongue pretty firmly in his cheek in telling the second); but they have, like so many other examples given, no bearing whatever on the experimental method. Experiment in the modern scientific sense is different from intelligent observation and the use of evidence (at both of which Herodotus was adept); nor is it synonymous with an awareness of the importance of empirical tests, though such awareness goes some way towards it. Experiment in the modern sense involves an active interference with nature. This was, in general, something that simply did not occur to the Greeks. The notion of interrogating nature (to use Bacon's phrase) was a much later growth. And the kind of interrogation involved requires, as a rule, the use of instruments, aims at a quantitative result, and is usually conducted in a laboratory where the phenomenon in question can be investigated in artificial isolation. This description of the technique of experiment (however brief and inadequate) is enough to show how far the Greeks fell short of it; and their shortcomings were</page><page sequence="10">SCIENCE, PHILOSOPHY, AND TECHNOLOGY: II 189 due, at any rate in part, to two factors which we have already con- sidered-their limited technological resources and their lack of a governing analogy or model which would lead them to ask the right questions. The two concepts of observation and experiment must therefore be kept distinct when one considers what the Greeks did and thought in the field of natural philosophy. For example, Empedocles' use of an analogy from the clepsydra to explain the process of breathing and Anaxagoras' use of the same analogy to demonstrate the existence of atmospheric air have both been treated as examples of experiment. But the clepsydra was a device for lifting liquid from one vessel and distribut- ing it to others; to treat an analogy from something most Greeks had seen used at a party as an experiment is quite unjustified-it's about as much of an experiment as taking a stopper out of a decanter. Again, Pythagoras' discovery of the numerical relations between the notes of the octave, which was of crucial importance for the future, is sometimes spoken of as if it had been reached as a result of experiment. Pythagoras must of course have conducted some kind of empirical tests; but the interesting thing is that we do not know what they were because no one seems to have thought it of sufficient interest to record them or to check his results by further tests. Most of the accounts of the discovery we have are, in Dr. Lloyd's words, 'pure fantasy', in the sense that the tests described do not produce the required result, and the whole story is an illustration not of the use of experiment but of a complete unawareness of what is involved in the modern notion of it. Two examples from the Meteorologica may serve to illustrate Greek limitations still further. Aristotle says that a wax jar, if let down into the sea with its top securely fastened, will when recovered be found to contain fresh water. He also says that salt water if evaporated and condensed becomes fresh, which is correct; but adds that wine also if evaporated condenses to water, which is incorrect. These examples show either a certain carelessness about such tests and a tendency to accept things on hearsay (as Aristotle's successors often accepted his statements), or the limitations of Greek technique; the fresh water in the wax jar may have been condensed water vapour, and ancient methods of distillation (Aristotle character- istically, again, does not tell us how he performed the test) may have been such as to produce a misleading result for wine.I In either event we are a long way from modern methods. None of this is meant, of course, to belittle the Greeks' awareness of the importance of empirical evidence or their powers of observation. To their powers of observation their whole literature bears witness, and it is not inappropriate to cite Herodotus as an example. There was not I Arist. Meteor. 358b 34 ff., 358b 16 ff.; cf. Lloyd, PCPhS, loc. cit. 64-5.</page><page sequence="11">19o SCIENCE, PHILOSOPHY, AND TECHNOLOGY: II much that escaped his shrewd and inquiring eye, and the Presocratics, for all their different interests, are more akin to him than to the scientist of today. It is a mistake, I believe, to treat them as practical men. Tradition credited Thales with a certain practical shrewdness; but that may have been because he was one of the Seven Wise Men, some of whom were men of affairs, and if Thales is supposed to have cornered the local olive-presses before a good harvest he is also supposed to have fallen into a well while star-gazing. And the picture of the natural philosopher in Aristophanes' Clouds (if one omits the extraneous elements in it clearly aimed at the sophists) shows that by this time the natural philosopher was pictured as anything but practical. Professor B. Farrington has argued for a practical turn of mind in the early philoso- phers on the grounds that they lived at a time of great technical progress and that they used many analogies 'derived from their control of tech- niques'. Neither argument has any foundation. That the Greeks made some technical progress in these early days may be true; but what they did was essentially to refine and develop existing techniques. There was no revolutionary step forward such as the discovery of how to smelt iron. And there is no reason to suppose that the Presocratic philosophers' attitude to the crafts was any different from that of any other Greek.' They did of course often argue from analogy, and their analogies were often drawn from human activity. But, as we have seen, when they were they were often led to importing into Nature inappro- priate vitalistic or teleological explanations, and natural philosophy had to outgrow such explanations before it could become scientific. But if the Greeks never quite achieved anything which we should recognize as the experimental method, it is worth remembering not only how keen their power of observation was, but how close it and their awareness of the importance of empirical evidence and of the occasional empirical test brought them to it in some fields. In the physical sciences Greek astronomy is the outstanding example. The Greeks in Hellenistic times inherited much from Babylon in the way of astronomical observa- tion; but Hipparchus' star catalogues and discovery of the precession of the equinoxes showed how much they could do for themselves. Their great achievement was to account for what was observed in terms of geo- metrical models. This was the foundation of the science of mathematical astronomy, the first major field in which mathematical explanations I Professor Farrington does not strengthen his case by citing examples that are definitely erroneous. To argue that Anaximander's account of the heavenly bodies was suggested by the 'bellows in the blast furnace' (Head and Hand in Ancient Greece, Io) is hardly convincing; the blast furnace was not invented until the Middle Ages, the bellows do not in fact emit fire, and the passage in question probably does not refer to bellows at all (see J. J. Hall, JHS lxxxix (1969), 57 f.). On early Greek philosophy and techniques see L. Edelstein, Ancient Medicine, 417 f.</page><page sequence="12">SCIENCE, PHILOSOPHY, AND TECHNOLOGY: II 191 were given of natural phenomena. It was made possible because Nature here, in S. Sambursky's words, 'provides man with all the advantages of laboratory investigation';, here observation, controlled and systematic, could give rise to science without experiment, though within the limits which available instruments allowed. The Greeks also made notable progress, as we have already noticed, in statics, hydrostatics, and optics. In optics in particular 'the Greeks were successful in their application of geometry to the study of reflection and refraction', and 'some investigators undertook quite extensive experiments to corroborate the principles of optics which they formu- lated.'z Similar remarks could be made of the work of Archimedes, Philo, and Hero in pneumatics and hydrostatics. But it should be noted that it is where they can apply geometry, in which they were strong, that the Greeks made progress; that while they made progress in statics they made little or none in dynamics; that in Hero's work there is a noticeable absence of quantitative measurement and that in the judgement of one editor he was a technician rather than a scientist; had he finished and published his book 'we should not have found a treatise on applied physics ... (but) a technical handbook on the construction of pneumatic instruments.'3 In chemistry the alchemists made a beginning, and the fourth book of Aristotle's Meteorologica contains a remarkable collection of observations which, if they do not amount to systematic experiment, point the way. In the biological field the work of Aristotle is most often cited as truly scientific. His work was in the main one of description and classification; it is indeed in a sense scientific, but it depends less on experiment than on observation carried to its limit and systematized. Even his dissec- tions are, so to speak, observation carried to its logical conclusion rather than the beginnings of experiment. The other chief workers in the biological field are the Greek doctors, and with medicine things stand rather differently. As F. M. Cornford has written, 'medicine is, and always has been, a practical art, with a history stretching back for untold centuries before it came to have anything we should recognize as a basis of scientific theory'.4 The doctor is always faced with a practical prob- lem: what is wrong with his patient and what should he do about it? If he is not to rely on magic or traditional lore (and it is as we have seen an essential characteristic of the Greeks that they had got beyond that stage) then observation, experience, and what we may call with Aristotle practical reasoning must be what he chiefly uses. And their keen powers of observation gave the Greeks more material, and their sharpness of The Physical World of the Greeks, 232. 2 Lloyd, PCPhS, loc. cit. 55. 3 A. G.

O</page><page sequence="13">192 SCIENCE, PHILOSOPHY, AND TECHNOLOGY: II reason enabled them to give it greater systematic order and to cut away the encumbrances of superstition. But this does not in itself amount to turning medicine into science. Indeed it illustrates very aptly my main contention, that scientific method remained unknown to the Greeks; for as Cornford again remarks, medicine in this respect was 'on the same footing as the industrial arts'.' The Greek doctor, though more sophis- ticated than the Greek iron-worker, was essentially no more scientific. There are some exceptions in Galen, some of whose dissections have as their object the establishment of theoretical rather than practical principles; but the rule holds good. There is a difference between a craft technique, which may be rational enough and based on experience, and a science, a difference not transcended until the days of modern science-based technology. Rational explanation based on observation does not alone amount to science. It is time to draw together the threads of my argument and make some general concluding reflections. I started from what I called the rather simple-minded question: Why were the Greeks not better at science? And one of my main themes has been that this question, which many have asked in more sophisticated terms, is one that does not really make sense. That science in our modern sense could not begin until men had started to try to give a consistently rational explanation of the world is of course true; and the Greeks were the first to give such explanations. But they never grasped the notion of controlled experiment. One of the reasons often given for this is the divorce of theory and practice, the implication being that if the Greeks had given their minds to it they could have done a great deal better, particularly in the sphere of applied science and technology. It was for this reason that I was led to consider the backward state of technology in the ancient world, and the reasons that have been given for it, and to argue that this backwardness was due not primarily to social or economic causes, but to causes inherent in the state of technology itself. It was not social causes that held back technological change, but technological causes that held back social change. I do not of course mean that social and economic causes have no effect on the development of technology. Of course they have. Even though I have argued that slavery is rather an effect than a cause of technological backwardness, it has none the less to be taken into account in assessing the picture as a whole. My point is better put by saying that the level of technology at any time sets certain limits to social and material development. It makes no sense to talk of the failure of the ancient world to industrialize, because failure only makes sense in terms of the possibility of success, and the resources of the ancient world were such that industrialization was not a possibility at all. And the chief, and Op. cit. 9.</page><page sequence="14">SCIENCE, PHILOSOPHY, AND TECHNOLOGY: II 193 quite unpredictable, factor is that of human inventiveness and know- ledge. The advances made in the Middle Ages were possible because of a whole series of discoveries, some of which I have listed; and though there is a certain amount of necessary order in the series-some dis- coveries presuppose others-it is never possible to predict at any given time what the future state of knowledge and discovery will be. If it were we should already know and should already have discovered. Historical inevitability is a construction of hindsight. Of course human knowledge, scientific and technological, is not the only factor in history. But it is a very important one because it determines the material conditions and limitations within which the historical process takes place. And it is only by studying its development and internal connections that any period can be understood. It is this thesis which in this paper I have tried to illustrate from the world of Greece and Rome. CONFERENCE The Sixth International Congress of Classical Studies, organized by the Federation Internationale des Associations d'I?tudes Classiques, will be held in Madrid from 2 to 7 September 1974. The programme includes a central theme ('Resistance and Assimilation to Ancient Culture in the Mediterranean World'); a symposium on the relations between classical studies and contem- porary science; a special section for important discoveries and work in progress; and a commemoration of the twenty-fourth centenary of Plato's birth.
