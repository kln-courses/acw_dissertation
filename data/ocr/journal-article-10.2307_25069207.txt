Toward the end of The Athenian Sun in an African Sky Kevin Wetmore describes a moment in a stu dent production of Euripides' Hippolytus in Grahamstown, South Africa, in 1998. The actress playing Phaedra stepped out of the action to com ment to the audience: "Early on in the rehearsal process the directors told us to visualize our char acters. I saw [mine] as being tall, willowy, with long blond hair." Then, Wetmore continues, "the action onstage ... stopped as other actors looked at her looking at the audience" (213). This meta theatrical engagement by an African actress and woman of color with European tradition highlights some of the questions and possibilities surround ing modern African adaptations of ancient Greek tragedy. The incident might have been used to argue for a straightforwardly Afrocentric rejection of the European colonizers' cultural traditions. But Wetmore adopts a more complex position. If Greek tragedy can?as he has argued earlier?be used as a frame for reflection on postcolonial Africa's situ ation, that frame can itself, as here, be exposed and challenged. Theatre, he suggests, is particularly suited to this enterprise because of its endless potential for restaging and recontextualizing fic tional identities, including those assigned to its subjects by colonial power. Greek tragedy reached Africa through the colo nial education curriculum. Since the 1960s, in the wake of independence, however, African produc tions and adaptations of Greek tragedy, far from declining, have been on the increase. Besides the special case of South Africa, Wetmore includes works from Nigeria, Ghana, and the Congo. Repre sented are not only adaptations by well-known playwrights such as Athol Fugard and Wole Soyinka but also less familiar works like Edua Sutherland's Edufa, based on Euripides' Alcestis, and Nigerian J. P. Clark-Bederemo's Song of a Goat, which as its title suggests alludes formally to Greek tragedy, the original "goat-song," rather than adapt ing a specific play. Most were written by members of a Western-educated intelligentsia with univer sity connections. Often, too, they were part of a project to develop post-independence national the atres. Sutherland founded a theatre and a drama school in Ghana shortly after independence; Rotimi's The Gods Are Not To Blame, based on Sophocles' Oedipus Tyrannus, was written after its author returned from the West to the University of Ife. Plays like these, produced only in the play wright's native country, raise familiar dilemmas about the continuing influence of colonial literary traditions. Is it, then, the privileged status of Greek tragedy in Western traditions that accounts for its appeal in postcolonial Africa? Wetmore opens with several hypotheses as to why Greek tragic forms not only took root in Africa but remained popular when other Western literary traditions were subject to anticolonialist backlash. He identifies general affinities: the pre-existence in both cultures of mythical and, more specifically, oral epic traditions; their use of anthropomorphic cosmologies; and rich pre-theatrical performance traditions in both, often involving choruses. Par ticularly intriguing is his suggestion that in both cases the tragic moment is one of transition: from orality to literacy, and to a modernity generated in Athens by the development of an abstract and generalized notion of civic identity, and in African countries by the encounter with Europe. Greek tragedy's survival as a model in Anglophone lit erature is also explained by its semi-outsider sta tus. While writers such as Racine and Corneille incorporated classical tragic forms into French lit erature, Greek tragedy's more distant relationship to English literature left it free of colonial taint and capable of being perceived as fundamentally "unEnglish" (Ngugi wa Thiongo, quoted on 32). Some of these lines of speculation are flimsily documented, and?understandably in the space of a single book?not all are developed. When Wetmore moves on to specific adaptations, his declared preference is, following Carl Weber, for the model of "transculturation," a process that ends in the "disappearance of the model into the next text or technique within [the target] culture" (37), at which point "knowledge of the original tragedy and its own context is no longer needed" (38). Yet as we have seen, Wetmore often, in com mon with many of the authors he cites, suggests the opposite conclusion: that it is precisely a foregrounding of the colonial framework of "Afri can tragedy" that generates its most powerful en gagement with both colonial past and postcolonial present. This is a far more dynamic model, as Westmore's own analyses reveal. He is at his liveli est discussing plays like Fugard's The Island, where the colonial framework is itself staged; on the other hand "transculturation," as deployed here, does not consistently address the questions so tantaliz ingly raised at the beginning and tends to displace issues about the modalities of power and resistance in a postcolonial context. Tug Yourgrau's The Song of Jacob Zulu, discussed in chapter five, challenges the transculturation</page><page sequence="2">182 / Book Review model differently again. Source and target cultures were easily distinguished for plays like Edufa, but this is not true for, say, Soyinka's The Bacchae of Euripides, an "African" play commissioned by Britain's National Theatre. Jacob Zulu is yet more complex, as it was created by a South African-born but US-resident author together with the South African group Ladysmith Black Mambazo. The play treats recent South African history on the model of the Orestes story and was staged in the US. There is a host of questions to be teased out here about the cultural and political transactions involved regarding, for example, the production's relationship to the domestic politics of race (the Broadway production attracted unusually high numbers of African Americans) and to Western economic power and cultural prestige. Wetmore is well aware of such questions, but perhaps for lack of space to explore them he falls back finally on an over-generalized notion of glo bal, hybrid multiculturalism in which cultural au thenticity is indiscriminately up for grabs, and questions about identity, community, inequality, power, are obscured. The inveterately political (and, for live theatre, inveterately local) form of Greek tragedy would demand that we resist so thorough going an erasure of difference. This book does not take us all the way in that endeavor, but it puts us firmly on the track. MARGARET WILLIAMSON Dartmouth College</page></plain_text>
