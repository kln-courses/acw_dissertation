<plain_text><page sequence="1">SEEKING SOCIAL LIFE IN THE EARLY IRON AGE CYCLADES Susan Langdon A scene of swiftly unfolding violence circles the belly of a Late Geometric amphora from Paros (see fig. 2 on p. 100). Eight helmeted warriors mount an attack from horses and chariots, while three bodies lie scattered on the field. Two of the warriors wear small round shields, and a third behind a massive Dipylon shield delivers a fatal sword blow to a small opponent. From one perspective, the imagery presents an almost routine show of heroic force, in the symbolic language of power typical of contemporary mainland pottery. Such an interpretation accords well with the circumstances of deposition. The amphora (Paros Mus. inv. 3523) was one of two figured vessels used in a mass burial of warrior cremations near the harbour of Paroikia about 730 Be. This polyandrion has been interpreted as a state monument to the local dead who lost their lives in an unnamed conflict, possibly related to the Leiantine War.1 This perspective originates in the rising polis of Paros, where honours accorded in a public memorial suggest state-level organization. But the amphora, which dates earlier than the mass burial, can also be viewed from the vantage of Paros, the island, with its scene revealing aspects of insular life. Remarkably, none of the warriors seem to be attacking one another; rather, they focus on a group of unarmed men, now dead except for one victim in his final moments. Beside him stands a grazing goat. This is no battle but a raid of the sort that must have bedevilled island life, where raiders could appear with little warning and withdraw as quickly, snatching animals, women, children, and supplies. The raiders, of course, could be Parian. This amphora, then, offers as good a place as any to enter the social life of the islands. It is ironic that although the settlement of Zagora on Andros is central to discussions of domestic remains in the 8th century, the Cycladic region remains more opaque with regard to our knowledge of its social life.2 The growing evidence of settlement organization, domestic debris, sanctuary material, and burials in the Early Iron Age Cyclades has been well treated in recent studies, but the incomplete publication of recent excavations hinders comprehensive social reconstructions. The variety of evidence warns us to expect not a unitary island society but one that differs from place to place, with the character of each site conditioned by topography, visibility, traffic, and resources. Investigating social life also means factoring intangibles. In small island communities local personalities can have a big impact. A shipload of unusual goods leaves a visible ripple in local behaviours and crafts. The demographic fact that a third to a half of the group were children skews the archaeological record, as well as social patterns, in ways we are only beginning to see. Perhaps most significantly, cross-cultural studies of island environments caution us against assuming that social patterns were shaped and constricted by bio-geographical circumstances.3 Despite the limitations of water boundaries, it is important to recognize that patterns of life were mostly governed by active choices. Take the dramatic location of Zagora, vividly sketched by Nicolas Coldstream as 'a bleak and precipitous headland, 1 Ph. Ν. Zaphiropoulou, 'Geometric Battle Scenes on Vases from Paros", in: E.

The larger forces at work throughout Greece in the 9th and 8th centuries—population growth, synoikismos, social stratification—reached equally to the Aegean islands. Yet Cycladic communities engaged in somewhat different material behaviours and inhabited a visual world parallel to but different from the nascent poleis of the mainland. An effective way to understand developments in the Cyclades is to look at them from a mainland perspective, examining how artefacts were used to express the identities and values of certain social groups in Athens, Eretria, Boeotia, and Argos, and then compare these patterns with material culture in the islands. Particularly informative is a focus on one key facet of the social world: the construction of élite manhood through exclusionary behaviours supported by material and poetic representations.5 The ideological discourse of Early Iron Age manhood typically involves (1) representation as an armed warrior, (2) ownership of horses, chariots, weapons, and prestige goods, (3) command over the natural world expressed by hunting and taming of animals, (4) domination of the human world expressed by military prowess and gender asymmetries, and (5) peer competition in military, athletic, and feasting venues. Specialized knowledge and goods inform all these categories. Archaeological correlates take the form of a dizzying array of prestige goods widely distributed throughout the mainland, which includes bronze tripods, figurines, armour and weapons, spits, drinking ware, horse trappings, and metal implements. Striking cases from the islands come immediately to mind: the mass burial of warriors of the Paros polyandrion along with battle-decorated amphorae and the feasting arrangements in Zagora houses that suggest a gendered hierarchy. Two categories of behaviour and representation are particularly useful in comparing the world of mainland warrior culture with that of the 8th-century Cyclades: specialized bronze votive dedications and pottery iconography. SPECIALIZED BRONZEWORKING AND VOTIVE BEHAVIOUR Craft specialization is readily tied to social status and power structure. Metals and other materials that require expert knowledge and resource networks for their acquisition and manipulation naturally play a role in gender and class hierarchies. In Greece such products were most powerfully deployed in public and ritual situations where they could promote the élite worshippers, such as votive offerings of tripods, weapons, armour, and figurines depicting warriors, horses, cattle, chariots, and imitations of Near Eastern models. Unlike burials where rich goods make only a transitory impact on a select audience, sanctuary dedications continue to impress long after the act of offering. At least 25 sanctuaries across the mainland, from Thessaly to Laconia, received offerings of bronze anthropomorphic Geometric figurines, with over 250 freestanding and detached tripod figures known.

Horses alone account for well over 1,100 figurines. Although their uneven distribution appears skewed towards Olympia, their widespread production is significant, and at least 14 regional styles can be identified.7 By contrast, bronze figurines (horses and anthropomorphs) have been published from only three Cycladic islands, for a total of 6 figurines of which at least 5 and possibly all 6 are mainland imports. A. de Ridder reported a Laconian pair of horses on a pierced base as coming 'probably from Naxos' in the 19th century.8 The Apollo sanctuary on Delos had 2 horses, one Attic and one Cretan, both broken from tripod handles. Two human figurines include a fragmentary and badly corroded belted male warrior that is possibly Argive and probably from a tripod. A stylized non-warrior male figure found on Delian Mt. Kynthos has a distinctive style, with a long neck, faceted face, and incised pointed circle eyes suggesting an origin in Aetolia or Thessaly and possibly a 7th-century date.9 Finally, the upper half of a tripod warrior reportedly from Amorgos has been identified as Peloponnesian, with its closest parallels in Olympia.10 Although not technically related, a lead figurine found at Zagora might have been locally made, judging by the close similarity of the paired standing figures incised on its base to an ivory seal from Melos." This negligible interest in figurine use in the Cyclades extends to published terracottas, as a survey of human and horse figurines affirms. Late Geometric terracotta male figurines are represented (or at least published) only at the Delos Artemision, where one possibly Cypriot LG warrior and six horses were found.12 While this survey includes only male figures, adding female figurines would scarcely change the results. In the 7th century, however, islands such as Siphnos adopt an important terracotta figurine tradition of large female figurines with wheelmade bodies.13 Other prestige offerings of bronze at mainland sanctuaries include tripods, weapons, feasting equipment (especially spits), and horse blinkers, bridles, and bits. In addition to the Cretan horse from a tripod ring handle mentioned above, the Delos sanctuary also received tripods of hammered style, likely Attic imports, and a fragment of a bronze rod tripod preserving a dog. Surveys of horse trappings and chariot evidence in Greece report no material remains in 8th-century Cycladic sanctuaries or graves.14 Weapons are also uncommon in these contexts. On Amorgos the unusually rich votive deposits around a building complex and series of cultic pyres on the Minoa acropolis include a possible fragmentary mitra along with other weapons, and Geometric arrowheads are reported from 7 J.-L.

In sum, bronze votives typical of élite and probably male worshippers at mainland sanctuaries number very few in the islands and almost entirely consist of imports taken to Delos. Given the potential of the trading and working of metals as a source of status and power, this is a notable deficiency. The prominence of Delos for its rich and exotic votives suggests that any such activity was directed to that sanctuary, although it is difficult to identify whether mainland votives were dedicated by local votaries or by visitors from the mainland. With its tripods and bronze and terracotta figurines, the votive profile of Delos attests the singular nature of a special cult place with growing regional importance. A recently published survey of island sanctuaries supports this point. Of 131 cult sites investigated on 26 islands, only 11 are reported as yielding small finds aside from pottery (although in some cases this might be an issue of incomplete publication).16 The sanctuaries richest in non ceramic votive offerings—Hyria, Minoa, Delos, Koukounaries—feature pins, jewellery, small items of personal adornment often typical of female deities or worshippers. A reasonable conclusion is that island élites generally ignored local sanctuaries as a venue for competitive display of male status or the commitment of real wealth. POTTERY AND ICONOGRAPHY The social benefits of figure-decorated potteiy were extensively exploited at many mainland communities, which significantly developed early into stratified poleis. Images flourish when they serve a purpose, so studying the waxing and waning of motifs can reveal symbolic values that were open to manipulation. The first themes to enter Attic pottery in LG 1 (with similar patterns found in Euboea and in the Argolid) present an explicit ethos of male aggressiveness and warrior identity: land-fighting, ship-borne attacks, parading of military possessions, funerals attended by warrior peers. The first generation of figurative images is notable for multi-figured scenes that set warriors within displays of power and authority. Aside from prothesis, the deceased is not singled out for individual veneration, but cast as part of a peer group. The new themes of LG II tend to promote the individual, as shown by an increase in scenes of competitive activities and single heroic men.17 In this second phase some of the larger figure scenes contract {prothesis) or disappear (ekphora, sea battle, land battle), while the innovative motifs of the late 8th century involve men acting alone or prevailing over a second figure, whether an athlete, an enemy, a woman, a lion, or a centaur. Public venues developed along lines that offered non-violent outlets for competitive energies. The expansion of the figurative repertoire also includes forays into the world of cult and fantastic creatures. In island pottery, by contrast, human figures and warrior-related imagery (horses, chariots) are rare, either on imports or local productions. Benefiting from proximity and perhaps a special relationship with Eretria, Zagora LG fine wares are dominated by Euboean imports, of which relatively few bear a figurative decoration.

I).18 Not counting the ever-popular bird, only fourteen published fine painted vessels or fragments have figures and at least eight of these have been identified as imports, with the rest described as 'island' or unattributed. The warrior-with-horse pots are strongly Euboeanizing. Hypsele on Andros has a few sherds with similar depictions of warriors, Attic running dogs, and goats at a tree of life.19 The figurative vase-painting of Naxos shows Attic influence, including a battle (shipwreck?) scene and a lyre player, as well as Euboean-inspired horses, mangers, deer, and goats in the Cesnola style.20 The Geometric vessels on Delos include an amphora with a distinctive female dance and horses at a tripod, a pedestalled krater with horse panels, and a handful of sherds featuring a Dipylon warrior, a horseman, grazing horses; goats are a staple throughout the islands (fig. 2).21 A sherd with horse and lyre-player on Paros is an Attic import and likely a product of the Burly Workshop.22 Better known are the two funerary amphorae from the polyandrion at Paroikia, one with a prothesis scene and figure style clearly derived from Attic work, the other more distinctly local but influenced by the Attic pictorial convention of chariots with Figure 1.

The style derives from Attica, but in the Rottiers group becomes more individualized, the animals having (in Coldstream's words) a 'fragile and youthful' look with large 'inquiring' eyes.24 The presence on Melos of a fine imported LG Argive pedestal led krater with horse-and-fish metopes as early as 730 bc, and a contemporary Argive skyphoid krater with horse-leader motif, suggests another external source of inspiration. In sum, the major pottery-producing islands all tell a similar story: what figurative motifs they carry are narrow in range and for the most part copy Euboean and Attic models.26 Since figuratively decorated sherds tend to get illustrated in reports and publications, this admittedly incomplete picture based on what has been published nevertheless has some representational status. The main point is that the total of figurative scenes is relatively small and depends heavily on imports. Pottery is the chief expressive craft medium of the LG Cyclades. The fact that island potters show little interest in the symbolic potential of human images raises an important question: what does the lack of a locally developed symbolic system of masculine representation imply about social structure and areas of social and political concern? The pattern of votive behaviour explored above allows us to expand the question. Since both the expenditure of valuable items in offerings and the depiction of warrior imagery on pottery embody conspicuous consumption, are we seeing in the islands a different use of material culture in polis creation from the major mainland centres? We can approach the problem from two directions: the relation of visual media to other evidence in the islands, and the materials that the islanders themselves chose for elaboration. The seeming scarcity of warrior representations may reflect material realities. Horses, for example, appear in most Cycladic pottery styles but chariots only in those specimens most influenced by Euboea and Attica. Whether these examples draw on art or the experience of iiving animals is uncertain. Direct evidence of horse culture by way of skeletal remains, horse trappings, and chariot parts is completely lacking for the Early Iron Age, although this need not mean there was none. Horses were part of the élite culture of Naxos and Paros in Late Helladic (LH) I1IC, as attested by excavation at Koukounaries of a horse skeleton and horse bits, as well as a male skeleton interred in a cave near the settlement and identified as a horseman by osteological features.27 At Grotta one of the wealthy warrior graves of LH 111C date in the cemetery of Kamini included seven objects identified as curry combs for horses. Horses, chariots, and horsemen appearing on LH II1C kraters at Grotta and Hyria augmented the local trappings of élite culture.28 In the Early Iron Age even a small number of horses or chariots would have left a big impression on neighbours if not in the archaeological record. It is certainly possible that horse populations survived from Mycenaean times on some of the islands, or alternatively could have been brought by ship from breeders in Euboea, the 23 Or a four-wheeled cart, see M.

Images of horse transport by ship and the close association of ships and horses seen in Argive LG pottery and Boeotian fibulae suggest an active traffic in these animals through gift exchange and/or merchant activity, but they may equally depict horses carried as battle gear and the booty from raids.29 The Boeotian fibulae in particular set up a close association of horses and ships, including horses near men fighting shipside. While a number simply pair a horse on one side of the fibula plate with a ship on the reverse, five further specimens suggest a piratical intent. On a bow fibula in Berlin, a manned warship faces across a central rosette a mare suckling her foal.30 A plate fibula in the Thebes Museum features a ship with two horses trotting below, and above, an archer shoots at a man with spear. One of the men might have disembarked for the fight, which seems to involve the horses near the ship, while on the reverse two other men apparently try to catch horses.31 On another bow fibula reportedly from Thisbe, a horse stands tethered on a ship deck while, across the rosette, a man takes the lead of a mare nursing a foal, apparently to convey them to the ship (fig. 3). Two more Boeotian fibulae show horses on shipboard, one facing a skirmish among four armed men, and a manned warship on the reverse.33 A splendid plate fibula from a warrior grave on Skyros shows a running warrior with Dipylon shield evading arrows on or beside a ship, while on the reverse an identical warrior running beside (or mounted on) a tethered(?) horse faces more flying arrows.34 References to raids and battles in fibula iconography continue on a notable example in Athens, where a line of bound prisoners parades below a lion taking down a deer; a huge warrior on a chariot fills the reverse of the plate.35 The depiction of horse Figure 3.

Horse raiding may be a limited specialty of Boeotian fibulae, but it returns us to the Parian amphorae from the polyandrion with which we started. The earlier of the two has a loose, free-field figurative style exhibiting a vivid energy that contrasts with the stolidity of the secondary, linear decoration of the vessel. This suggests that the episode was drawn from local experience of raiding and animal rustling, even if exaggerated for dramatic effect. Is it an attack by outsiders who arrived by sea, landing horses and chariots for a surprise attack? Or are these locals acting against each other? A scene on a sherd from the Kamini cemetery near Grotta on Naxos may also refer to a raid, with Dipylon warriors beside what may be a ship, and an unarmed man lying dead on the ground.36 The Paros amphora has been dated earlier by perhaps two decades than its deposition context, based on the painting style of the second amphora and on the shape of the plain cremation vessels, and thus may have nothing to do with the conflict in which some 200 warriors died. The 'hero' of the raid seems to be the helmeted chariot driver who is centred between the handles, or, in the opposite axial position, the horseman brandishing his spear below a defeated corpse. In either case, a Parian identity appears likely. That raiding was entirely a source of prestige to Homeric heroes can be argued to reflect similar attitudes in early Greece, whether motivated by profit, politics, or honour. The sheer routineness of raiding in the ancient sources suggests that the 'sea battles' of Attic LG I pottery mostly (entirely?) depict an 'opposed landing from a ship', i.e., expeditions for plunder, since a successful leader of such campaigns could effectively secure a band of followers.37 The second amphora, with its remarkable depictions that seem to track the death of a hero from battlefield to bier in three stages, is easier to place within a larger conflict, perhaps even the Lelantine War, as has been proposed. Since the burial amphorae seem to be local productions, the deceased warriors were presumably transported home for cremation, although no pyre location has yet been identified. Stacked corpses on an Attic LG krater may depict a similar errand.'8 The very standard prothesis scene on the neck is enhanced by a stack of innovative details: a battle line of slingers, the death by arrow of the featured warrior in the front line, the rescue of his corpse, and a visit to his bier by a male relative or companion who touches the arrow. Together the two amphorae provide glimpses of different kinds and perhaps scales of conflict but remain more or less unique in island Geometric vase painting. The two Paroikia amphorae notwithstanding, this emerging cultural pattern suggests growing communities who are—relative to the mainland—light on prestige materials and subdued in terms of showy display of warrior identity. This raises the question of how much material underpinning is needed to sustain a powerful élite. It is plausible that the real measure of status and wealth in the Cyclades was livestock—intrinsically valuable but archaeologically fugitive. The popularity of horses and goats in Cycladic vase-painting highlights the resources of the land, not the sea, and indeed there is virtually no sea-related iconography at this time in the islands. This preference for land references should offer no surprise in a time of synoikismos, rising populations, and presumably an emphasis on land ownership. Even where the lack of low wetlands discouraged raising large herds of cattle and horses, sheep and goats could be kept on uncultivated lands within a flexible mixed 36 Prakt 1939, 120 fig. 2 (Karouzou). 37 T.

The benefits of animal husbandry reached beyond basic subsistence to include wealth-producing animal-based products and considerable intrinsic socio-political prestige."59 Of course, naturally mobile animal wealth attracted raiders to whom even goats were vulnerable, as the earlier Paroikia amphora may show, and a LG giant pyxis from Argos depicts a goat aboard a ship, either as provision or booty.40 While animals were important to Greek economy and politics, they are not precisely equivalent to the symbolic language of power seen in mainland communities. Some wealthy farmers may have turned occasionally, even seasonally(?), to raiding. Yet the growing prosperity of the Cyclades, which would see a spectacularly rich and creative culture emerge in the 7th and 6th centuries, may stem precisely from a more subdued social representation in the 8th. The insistence on overdetermined, aggressive masculinity fostered in mainland culture was a strategy adapted to local conditions. Elite peer groups benefited from advertising military threats with the implicit message of the community's need for their protection, while at the same time engaging in material behaviours that separated them from the rest of the community. Large populations, increasing social complexity, and unclear but highly contested territorial limits were conditions that encouraged and sustained this warrior ethos. The same cultural strategy seems not to have been cultivated in the Cyclades. In fact, ideologies of aggression, which served élite groups well on the mainland, would have run counter to the necessary interdependence of island settlements. As in the Bronze Age, insular survival depended on exchange and mobility, support of neighbours for protection and, in hard times, the sharing of resources. An ethos of cooperation rather than competition was in everyone's best interests. PITHOl While numerous factors comprised the complex socio-political changes of the later 8th century, the storage of goods provides one useful way to understand the pattern of insular material culture. Although operating on a household level, the display of storage could be laden with outward-directed messages of both conspicuous wealth and potential generosity. In addition to sharing basic supplies, social bonds of mutual support and lasting obligations are cemented through ceremonial activities, exogamy, and gift-exchange. Ideally suited to the Cycladic environment, such dynamic systems entail a 'spectrum of behaviour' that is contingent upon fluctuating harvests and particular micro-environments.41 Social partnerships may be intensified during climatic downturns, while islands more richly endowed in arable land and resources will routinely benefit from favourable attention of more needy communities. Such a situation may in part account for the rise of Naxos in the late 8th century in controlling Delos and exerting economic and political power throughout the islands.42 Military activity readily fits this network system within a scheme of shared defence of communal holdings and animal wealth. Raiding is known to have operated within ethical constraints that protected friendly and politically advantageous communities. The concern for risk management in the islands is made clear by the elaboration of pithoi, which can reasonably be characterized as the major prestige artefact of island society, the perfect symbol of wealth, stability, and future security. Pithoi can embody not only the prosperity of the individual household, but a community's participation in a support network. The conspicuous display and figurative decoration of these important furnishings point jQ T. Howe, Pastoral Politics: Animals.

The group appears across the central Cycladic islands, Euboea, and Boeotia.4j Examples are known from sanctuaries and cemeteries as well as houses, and often show signs of reuse and movement from one social and functional context to another. Although many pithoi were ultimately used as coffins, their primary function was for storage of foodstuffs like grain, oil, honey, and especially wine.44 On the earliest (LG) examples from Zagora, Tenos, and Naxos the figurative motifs evoke wealth and security. Featured are lines of horses, unarmed horse riders, deer, grazing goats, goats at a Tree of Life, a Master of Goats who might be a deity but could represent a prosperous farmer—in other words, prosperity measured in natural, living, reproducible wealth.45 Male and female row-dancers (Zagora, Tenos) express a community bound in shared ritual.46 Male figures facing a female, even grasping her wrist, may refer to marriage rituals. A generation later this motif is cast in the light of abduction myths, as also occurs in mainland iconography.48 Centaurs, some possibly dancing, appear on pithoi from Tenos, likely for the same ritual and protective functions they demonstrate in mainland contexts.49 By the very end of the period images of goddesses appear, including a possible Mistress of Animals at Tenos.50 At Amorgos an impressive lion hunt pulls us out of the island world.?l Amid the animal-dominated imagery, figures of warriors (processing and fallen) and archers read more naturally as images of defence than as statements of élite prowess. Warriors appear as a group poised to defend the community from attack, as a living fortification wall. By contrast, mainland pottery iconography develops by LG II a preference for individual heroics and competition. Depending heavily on stores and vulnerable to unexpected attack, island settlements preferred the heroic model of Hector the city defender rather than of Achilles the attacker; as Susanne Ebbinghaus has explored, the ultimate expression of this fear is the 7th-century Mykonos pithos: its twenty violent images of the murder of Trojan women and children have to do not with death but with the protection of the city and its stores, a grim reminder of what failure meant.52 Similarly, dead warriors picked over by carrion birds decorate pithoi at Eretria and Zagora.In these cases the clay wall of the pithos can be said to parallel the city's fortification wall, but not all decorated pithoi so 43 Ν.

A comparison with mainland communities shows a different approach to consumption and display. At first glance the material culture of the islands appears as a paler version of the consumption and display typical of mainland communities; a closer look suggests a different symbolic discourse. The subdued iconography of animal imagery punctuated here and there by warrior references is markedly different from mainland themes of initiated violence and its technologies that appear in votive offerings, drinking culture, funerary memorials, and personal representation. Only partly a matter of resource constraints, it is important to view island culture as a matter of choice and expediency, guided like their early fortifications and elaborated pithoi by a need for measured alliances between communities. This broad-stroke discussion obviously lacks the most important aspect of social life: the men, women, and children whose experiences, expectations, and concerns created the unique culture of the Cyclades. In addition to contextual studies, further insight will come from integrative explorations of individual sites where the entirety of a community's material behaviour can be mapped across the fields of domestic, funerary, and religious life. As a note to end on, I draw attention to one potentially fruitful and still unexplored line of evidence. The expansion of houses and complexes to accommodate extended families at sites like Zagora attests a rapidly growing population, as seen in many Greek communities in the later 8th century.56 This increase meant that proportionately more children were produced with each successive birth cohort. With relatively high levels of infant and childhood mortality, a large proportion of the population at any given time would have been under the age of 18, with some estimates as high as 30% to 50%.57 It is an archaeological truism that if we do not look for children, they tend to remain invisible. Yet, they were everywhere, learning and acting on the world. The archaeological implications are important. Since children make and use things in atypical ways, they randomize the archaeological record; their agency can make the archaeological patterns that we find seem to fall apart and they can introduce new ones.58 The islands have already provided an entry point to the world of Cycladic childhood with certain burials of girls on Naxos and Skyros specially marked by ritual material influenced by Attica and Euboea.59 This pattern falls away by LG, but a tradition of child-associated 54 A second pithos from Tenos depicting the sack of Troy has been ingeniously reconstructed by Simantoni-Bournia op. cit. pl. 54.

In the interests of exogamous unions, strategies for successful agreement and integration between communities might vary from place to place and in material culture might involve either heightened or lessened differences in local styles and exchange goods. The site of Eretria is particularly rich in evidence for children. Among the many pots found in Eretria Hereon Tomb 11, the burial of a two-and-a-half-year old child, two seem to have been actually made by a child, perhaps a sibling or family friend.60 Ethnographic and cognitive studies have identified distinctive features as hallmarks of the early learning curve for young apprentice potters and vase-painters: thick, uneven walls, wobbly lines, a brush picked up too many times, poor spacing and conceptualization of symmetry, and frequently miniature scale.61 Similar cases can be seen in material from the Kerameikos and the Athenian Agora, where child graves contain offerings and possessions that seem to have been produced by young hands.62 A likely common denominator for these examples is their location in or near potters' quarters, where domestic debris suggests residence and workshops might have been closely connected. At Oropos and elsewhere, pottery kilns and metalworking hearths appear amid crowded groups of houses.6"5 An important archaeological implication of this evidence is that communities had every reason to invest their material culture heavily in socializing their rising adults, and would have begun the process early. Small, clumsily made pots can show how children are integrated into the ritual life of the community. In Eretria's north sacrificial area Artemis was worshipped in a kourotrophic cult where offerings included a local class of hydriae, pitchers, dolls, jewellery, and weaving equipment, suggesting a special focus on women and girls. Some of the miniature vessels display signs of under-developed cognitive and motor skills.64 The close dependence of these poorly made pots on idiosyncratic cult vessel shapes suggests close instruction aimed at maintaining ritual traditions. The presence of children can be sought especially in ritual contexts and materials, where status tends to be announced and stages of maturation recognized. The process of learning how to make crafts provided a natural opening for children to inject novelty into convention, whether intentional or not. Children's fresh views, perceptive interaction with their environment, and tenuous hold on tradition make them natural agents of change. The horrific massacre of the innocents on the Mykonos pithos brought to graphic actuality what must have seemed an ever-present concern: the future of the Cycladic world, as indeed all cultures, in the hands of children. 60 Miniature pitcher Eretria; Arch.
