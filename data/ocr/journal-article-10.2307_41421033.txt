FORSYTH University of Southwestern Louisiana International Review of Modern Sociology 1992, Vol.22 (Autumn) : 29 - 44 Americans have a persistent concern about the similarity of animals and humans. This paper investigates this anthropomorphic senti- ment as a cognitive and conceptual link between postindustrialism and animal rights activism, A number of investigative methodologies are utilized: content analyses of relevant journals, a key informant, a survey of members of an animal rights organization, and a review of various types of secondary information sources. These techniques form the basis of our investigatory attempts to understand the cul- tural drifts, structural pressures and cognitive and behavioral reper- tories of those engaged in animal rights activism. Introduction Somewhere in the collective consciousness of the American people there is a persistent concern about the similarity of animals and humans. We have long questioned the ways animals are to be treated and have passed laws to regulate such treatment. In fact, "America has the distinction of being the first country to acknowledge the rights of animals by enacting statutory legislation to protect them from cruel treatment. In 1641 the Puritans of the Massachusetts Bay Colony -voted to have printed their first legal code [which declared] ... Cruelty to animals [is] forbidden" (Leavitt 1970, p. 13). Furthermore, we have pondered the meaning of "cruelty" and have attempted to regulate the ways animals are to be trapped, housed, transported, imported, exported, bought, sold, used in</page><page sequence="2">30 INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF MODERN SOCIOLOGY sporting games, used in laboratories, and even the precise way they are to be slaughtered. Organizations abound which are dedicated to preserving animals' welfare and rights as well as educating, indoctrinating, and civilizing those who would trample on these animal "liberties." But - organizations also abound that promote the breeding, raising, gaming, slaughtering, butchering, and consuming of the flesh, organs, skins, and fur of these same animals. We have also elevated the status of some animals to that of pet, companion, and even surrogate therapist and have sought to have this class of animals granted special protection under local, state, national, and international prescriptions and proscriptions. The "Zoological connection" (Bryant 1979) has expanded drastically since the end of World War II and remains a source of mixed feelings for those who ponder the "correct" relationship between humans and animals. The recent drift of the zoological connection has resulted in some rather dramatic confrontations between those who decry all inhumane treat- ment of animals and those who use them in medical experiments, blood sports, and/ or serve them up as meat in their daily diets. At one end of the spectrum of beliefs about appropriate connections between humans and animals is the work of Ingrid Newkirk, the author of Save the Animals ; 101 Easy Things You Can Do. In this book, with an Introduction by Cleveland Адюгу, President of the Fund for animals, and a Foreword by Linda McCarthey, a famous vegetarian, Newkirk (1990:xiv) states her belief that "animals have a worth in and of them- selves, that they are not inferior to human beings but rather just different from us, and that they really don't exist for us nor do they belong to us/' In her attempt to convey these sentiments to others, her book describes, for example, the uses of animals in the cosmetic industry (e.g., dipping nail polish and shampoos into rabbits' eyes to study reactions), the sub- standard conditions of "puppy mills," breeding kennels, and "factory farms" which mass produce animals for human use and consumption, the catching of dolphins in seine nets used by the tuna industry, and the state of sports hunting and fishing in the United States. This book is also full of suggestion about how to combat these activities, and many others, pri- marily by a call for animal rights activism. Among the suggestions are the following (Newkirk 1990): Inform others. Most people aren't aware that their "cherry red" lipstick depends on animal suffering.(p.2) Mobilize your community to go cruelty-free...collect products manufactured by the company; and send them in. (p.2) Ask your city or country council members to pass an ordi- nance banning the sale and keeping of exotic wildlife except for</page><page sequence="3">ANIMALS, ATTITUDES, AND ANTHROPOMORPHIC SENTIMENT 31 rehabilitation purposes...Fight permit applications for new pet shops unless they limit sales to supplies only.

(p.16) For that close encounter with the woman in dead minks on the elevator or the man in the beavercollar flight jacket, there are graphic, pictorial cards that say, "Excuse me for approaching you but we would like you to meet the previous owner of your fur coat..."

(p.97) Go "hunt sabbing" (on a hunt sabotage), or support others who do, by sending a check to...(p.97) These sentiments are also reflected in a number of other recently published books and magazines. Among them are: The Attimals'Voice, Vegetarian Times, Animal Liberation (Singer, 1975), The Case for Animal Rights (Regan 1983), Slaughter of the Innocent (Ruesch 1983), In Defense of Animals (Singer 1985), Diet for a New America (Robbins 1987), and Inhu- mane Society: The American Way of Exploiting Animals (Fox 1990). Appar- ently the 1980s saw the greatest surge in the animal rights movement ever. Jasper and Nelkin (1992, p.37) contend that U.S.animal welfare groups have a combined membership of "ten to fifteen million," that "one in five" Americans claimed to have contributed to animal protection organizations, and that perhaps a million people support "animal rights" organizations. (For a chronology of the formation of recent animal rights organizations, see Chapter Four, "Moral Militancy" in Jasper and Nelkin 1992, pp.42-55). Just within the first four months of 1992 this surge has resulted in headlines, law suits, and criminal charges as well as intensified bickering between animal rights activists and those opposed to their philosophy. Some say that the recent tactics of PETA are raising the eyebrows of some of their own supporters. A USA Today article by Carolyn Pesce (1991, p.3A) captures some of the intensity of the campaign for animal rights: The tactics of People for the Ethical Treatment of animals almost always shock, disgust or outrage - by design...they stand on street corners screaming at women and men wearing fur...They spray-paint McDonald's restaurants and protest movies [which] they say promotes animal abuse...Their full- page ad last month in Iowa's Des Moines Register, comparing alleged serial killer Jeffrey Dahmeťs mutilation of his victims</page><page sequence="5">ANIMALS, ATTITUDES, AND ANTHROPOMORPHIC SENTIMENT 33 with the slaughter of animals, has outraged even fellow animal rights activists. Yet PETA has vowed to continue its radical tactics..."We're at war, and we'll do what we need to win," say PETA's Dan Mathews. "If we got rid of the slave trade, we can get rid of the beef industry ."...While PETA claims to be non- violent, it has been the media contact for the Animal Liberation Front - the group that's broken into research labs and caused thousands of dollars damage. PETA, which claims a current U.S. membership of more than 300,000 (Newkirk 1990, p.xv) is only one indicator that significant num- bers of people are questioning their relationship to meat, fur animal byproducts as well as to the use of animals in sporting activities such as . rodeos, races, carnivals, and other sorts of displays. Jasper and Nelkin (1992) chronicle the increase in "sentimental anthropomorphism" in their rather comprehensive book on the animal rights movement. They find the movement connected to a "critique of instrumentalism." They also see a correlation between industrialization of the West and the shift toward more anthropomorphic sentimentalism towards animals (Jasper and Nelkin 1992, p.4): The social roots of this movement lie in the changed relation- ship between humans and their fellow creatures that resulted from urbanization and industrialization in Western societies, as city dwellers began to encounter animals only as family pets, and less and less as instruments of labour and produc- tion. Animals have accompanied men and women throughout their history, some as; members of the family to be cherished, others as tools to be used. But in modern times the balance between these attitudes - one sentimental, the other instru- mental - has been questioned, as more and more peope insist that all animals be treated as though they were partners - " companion animals" - rather than objects. POSTTNDUSTRIALISM We agree that the recent upswing in animal rights activism is connected to industrialization and to the civilizing process that accompanies urbaniza- tion. But we also see a firm connection to the unique features of postin- dustrialism. Robertson's (1989, pp.64-66) summary description of a postindustrial society states that it is one in wMch the majority of the</page><page sequence="6">34 INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF MODERN SOCIOLOGY population does not work at food production or manufacturing. The post industrial society thrives by supplying advanced theoretical knowledge and products based on such knowledge, such as computers, telecommu- nications, defense systems, etc. Robertson (1989, p.65) also mentions spe- cifically: Despite their appearance of supreme mastery of the environ- ment, postindustrial societies are ultimately dependent on two delicate systems: the biological life-supports of the earth's ecology, and the network of international political and eco- nomic cooperation. In any serious global disruption - caused, say, by natural disasters, nuclear war, or economic collapse - the hunters and gatherers of the world might continue to feed themselves, and be unaffected. But what would become of societies where most people are trained to produce neither food nor goods, nor little else besides that ultimate inedible, knowledge? This points to our basic contention in this paper that as postindustrli- aization increases people will become further and further removed from first- hand experience with the food chain. In formal surverys in our current college classes already show that a small minority have had experience in killing, butchering, and preparing meals from farm or wild animals. Many are unaware of the total processes involved in producing hamburger, as staple of their diets. Their food is packaged, pommeled, prodded, and presented in such a way as to remove the raw reality of the source of the food. Thus, when these educated, media blitzed, postindustrialites are re- minded of the real source of much of their protein, they are without a referent to the food chain that agricultural and even industrialized societ- ties employed. That is, people in earlier times raised their own food, hunted it in the wild, dressed the game or slaughter animals, cured, canned, and preserved the meat, and understood the path from produc- tion to the table. A fact of the consumer age is that we consume without knowledge of processing and production strategies and/or facilities. What hap- pens, then, when we begin to collectively realize that there is, in essence, a "back stage" to the meat and fur industry? One result is the current wave of interest in animal welfare and animal rights. The zoological connection is changing within a milieu of anthropomorphic sentiment, ecological concern, and dietary reflection. This milieu is hinted at by the work of Edgley and Brissett (1990, p.259) who state that: Since health in this scheme of things is both an individual re- sponsibility and a public duty, what seems to be happening</page><page sequence="7">ANIMALS, ATTITUDES, AND ANTHROPOMORPHIC SENTIMENT 35 ůiTcasingly is that the political apparatus of the commonweal (legislation, regulation, and organizational policy), as well as the smaller (through perhaps more effective) interpersonal strategies of intimidation, harassment and stigmatization have been commandeered as power vehicles with which to establish a certain totalitarianism around the banner of health. In an ATOS, tobacco, and cholesterol infested age, Health Fas- cism seems to be the emerging political order of the day, with various groups and agencies exercising increasing vigilance and control over what people put into their bodies and what they put their bodies into (Emphasis ours). In addressing various degradation efforts of these "Health Nazis", Edgley and Brissett (1990, p.263) further contend that "Drunks, gluttons, smokers, and sedentaries (now derisively called 'couch potatoes' in the new pejorative of healthism) are viewed as an inferior class of people, certainly unfit, undependable, inefficient, and probably unclean in mind and spirit as well as body." This new health movement, which is con- nected to the animal rights movement directly and indirectly may be motivated in part by intolerance and self-righteousness of postindustrial- ites who have had the leisure time, education, cultural training, aloof middle class upbringing, and now the psychological inclination to see red meat eaters and brown fur wearérs as moral inferiors worthy of scolding, chastisement, ostracism, ridicule, and, eventually, salvation by conver- sion to vegetarianism, veganism, and evangelical animal rights activism. Methodology To investigate the degree to which anthropomorphic sentiment (which we see as a crucial cognitive and conceptual link between postindustrial- ism and animal rights activism) is reflected in the philosophy of vegetari- anism, we did a content analysis on a ten year sample (1980-1990) of all available issues of the vegetarian Times. To gain more insight into the rationales, motivations, and philosophies of animal rights activists, we surveyed sixteen persons who attended a meeting of a local animal rights activist organization. We also identified, cultivated, and interviwed a key informant - the leader and organizer of the group surveyed. These meth- ods, as well as the review of various types of secondary information sources (books, pamphlets, advertisements in the Animal's Voice maga- zine, newspapers, TV programs, etc.) form the basis of our exploratory attempts to understand the cultural drifts, structural pressures, and cog- nitive and behavioral repertories of those engaged in animal rights activ-</page><page sequence="8">36 INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF MODERN SOCIOLOGY ism/We believe these methods allow us to further document some of the components currently emerging in a social construction (or reconstruc- tion) of the concepts of meat and fur. The implications of this social constructionism should be apparent in its future effects on various indus- tries connected to animals and animal byproducts as raw source materi- als. Ethical and legal quagmires, battles, and compromises will continue to surround the creation, processing and use of animal "crops," whether found in the wild, semi-wild, or on "factory farms." We will address some of these issues in a later section of our paper. Findings Content Analysis An examination of the changing content of Vegetarian Times shows the growth of the animal rights movement. Whether this represents the co- opting of a periperial group, (potential vegetarians), the sympathy of vegetarians for a related cause, or the evolution of vegetarianism toward the more inconclusive topic of animal rights is a question yet to be answered. Regardless of motivation, however, this involvement has important consequences for the future of the animal rights movement. If healthy eating habits arè a step toward vegetarianism and if vegetarian- ism represents a first step toward animal rights activism then the move- ment has a large potential membership (or at the very least a more sympathie audience). This audience will increasingly change from neu- trality to sympathy to passive support to active support. One has to only look at the growth of the anti-smoking movement to track such a course. The decline in the consumption of meat is indicative of a change in American eating habits (cf Jasper and Nelkin 1992, p. 149). Articles in vegetarian journals suggest their sympathy and support for the animal rights cause. ''Vegetarians seem to follow this historical trajectory of increasing disgust when reminded of the animal origins of food, to the point of eliminating it all together" (Jasper and Nelkin 1992, p.. 148). As shown in Table 1, an analysis of topics in Vegetarian Times advertising, feature articles, letters to the editor, and editorials from 1980 thru 1990 reveals the increasing popularity of animal rights issues.

The meeting took place on a college campus and was presided over by a college professor, who has gained much attention for his defense of animal rights. Prior permission had been obtained to attend the meeting. Sixteen members of the group agreed to fill out questionnaires. Time was alloted during the meeting for the questionnaires to be completed. The questionnaires were returned to the researcher at the end of the meeting. - Description of the Sample - Ten of the respondents were male and six were female. They ranged in age from 18 to 54 years, x=25.5 years. Four- teen of the respondents had never married, one was currently married and another was divorced. Two of thé respondents were undergraduates, 11 had Bachelors Degrees, artd three had at least one graduate degree. All of the samples were White with the exception of one Asian. The questionnaire contained several questions regarding attitudes toward animals and animal rights and to what extremes the respondents were willing to go to ensure these rights and what behaviors in others would they condone in defense of these rights. There were also questions regarding their participation in other related organizations, their diet, their support of anti-gun legislation and whether or not they considered themselves to be environmentalists and vegetarians. Discussion of Results - As might be expected, the over whelming majority of the respondents (fourteen, or 87.5%) strongly agreed that the humane treatment of animals was important while one person(6.25%) agreed and one person (6.25%) was undec'ded. Likewise,- a large majority of those fifteen persons responding to the item, "Animals are acceptable as sources of clothing," either strongly disagreed (53.33%) or disagreed (20%). Three persons (20%) were undecided while only one operson (6.66%) agreed with the item. When responding to the item, "The use of animals in experiments to advance science and medicine is acceptable," eleven persons (68.75%) strongly disagreed and four (25%) disagreed. One person (6.25%) was undecided. When asked the question, "Do you believe it is OK to keep animals as pets," twelve persons (75%) said 4 yes' and four persons (25%) were</page><page sequence="10">38 INTERNATIONAL review of modern sociology undecided. This shows a concern for animals more in line with the phi- losophy of animal welfarists than fundamentalists concerned with animal rights (cf Jasper and Nelkin 1992, pp. 8-9). When asked, "Is a boycott an acceptable method of protest to you," fourteen respondents said 4 yes', one person (6.25%) said "no', and one person (6.25%) indicated an undecided stance. When respondents were asked, "How do you feel about recent animal rights groups breaking and entering animal research laborato- ries," five persons (31.25%) indicated strong approval, eight persons (50%) said they approved, one person (6.25%) was undecided, and two persons(12.5%) disapproved. When asked if they felt strongly enough about animal rights to participate in break ins of laboratories, nine indi- viduals (56.25%) said 4 yes', three (18.75%) said 4 no', and four (25%) checked the no comment category. We asked respondents if they would be willing to be arrested or jailed in defense of animal rights' seven (43.75%) said 4yes' with no hesi- tancy, eight (50%) said "yes' under certain circumstances and one person (6.25%) said 'no'. Of the fifteen persons responding to the question, "Do you support anti-gun regulation, twelve (80%) said 4 yes', two (13.33%) said 4no' and one person (6.66%) was undecided. Fourteen persons (87.5%) considered themselves to be environmen- talists while two (12.5%) did not. Eight respondents (50%) considered themselves vegetarians and eight (50%) did not. Of the fifteen persons responding to a question about veganism, three (20%) considered themselves to be vegan while twelve (80%) did not. Five persons (31.25%) believed one had to be a vegetarian in order to support animal rights, seven persons (43.75%) did not believe this, and four (25%) were undecided. Of thirteen persons responding to the question, "Do you consider the slaughter of animals for human consumption a violation of animal rights," eleven (84.6%) said 4yes' and two (25.38%) said 4 no'. Finally, thirteen (81.25%) of sixteen respondents said they saw spe- cific trends developing in regard to animal rights movements while three (18.75%) saw no trends developing. Trends identified by respondends who elaborated on their answer are listed below. Very few people are wearing furs. More people are becoming aware. Growing awareness of the sacredness of life. Animal-free testing products, more healthy vegetarian dishes.</page><page sequence="11">ANIMALS, ATTITUDES, AND ANTHROPOMORPHIC SENTIMENT 39 These trends are now becoming part of the common culture. I see a lot of awareness in a lot of people. Alignment with environmentalists, growing awareness of Buddhist notions ofTeverence for all life, and more promotion of cruelty-free products, less antagonism... More people standing up for rights of animals. The public is slowly becoming more aware of the constant mis- treatment of animals. And are realizing it is unnecessary. An increase in people who are not fully educated [but] who speak out in more peaceful and intelligent ways. Some are becoming a little too extreme and commit violence towards people which causes me concern. The responses to the questions we asked on the questionnaire are, of course, of limited use due to sample size and the nature of the group contacted. These results do sensitize us, however, to the fact that agree- ment is less than complete on all facets of the animal rights movement. Some respondents keep pets, some eat meat, some hesitate to go to jail in defense of animal rights, and some are unwilling to break into labs to free animals. Still, even with these caveats mentioned, there is considerable agreement that animal rights are increasingly important and that more should be done to promote not only animal welfare but "rights" as well. This is apparent in their comments and in the fact that nine people in the survey (56.25%) belonged to more than one group dedicated to the pro- tection of animals. Four of these persons belonged to four or more such organizations. One individual who filled out the questionnaire is also immersed in the animal rights movement and has become a key infor- mant for this project. We have had several conversations with this person, have interviewed him for two and one half hours, have observed him in televised debate with a prominent local furrier, and have been provided written comments by him on his position concerning the recent upsurge of activity involving animal l ights. Some of his ideas are presented below. Information From Key Informant Our key informant has marched, made speeches, published articles, and organized others in attempts to "reduce pain and suffering in the world" through improving the treatment of animals. He is a vegan, an attorney as well as a professor, and apears as a gentle and concerned person who wrestles continually with ethical, legal, and spiritual issues concerning life itself. He is particularly concerned with the dilemmas posed by the</page><page sequence="12">40 INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF MODERN SOCIOLOGY fact that humans and animals live in such violent juxtaposition. He is also self aware and has been dealing with the issue that he has been labeled an animal rights "freak" by some who find his ideas extreme, and / or intoler- able. Nevertheless, some of his ideas are best articulated in his own words and are presented below from written correspondence sent to the re- searchers. This correspondence concerns the question, "Why animal rights now?" Expansion of social justice: we have, to some degree secured rights for minorities and women, and now a logical next step is to expand that web of social justice to other suffering beings on the planet - with animals seemingly the next likely candidate. ....The reality is that America and western society at large be- comes increasingly divided into two worlds of haves and have nots, and social activists are becoming increasingly frustrated with their inability to secure genuinely improved conditions for the downtrodden and disenfranchised of this culture and so, out of frustration, they have turned to another area in which they might, at least for the short term, effect some limited changes in a tangible fashion. Reduce fur usage, ban pound seizure, eliminate testing on animals through promot- ing cruelty free products, etc. We are seeing on one level, Reich's sixties ideal of the greening of America, in the sense of opening up to a more compassion- ate, livable society, coming true on the peripheral and I choose to believe leading or vanguard fringes of our culture...Part of this new dimension in social thought is a fledgling but sincere attempt to break through out ingrained views of "the other" as enemy, which simultaneously leads to an expanded concept and world-view of what "we" are, and that expanded view is growing to include nonhumian beings with interests, namely animctL, ль worthy members of the class of those to whom we are morally obliged on some level. I think, without question, there is an environmental sensitivity growing in this country and that we are being forced, through the ecological exigencies before us, to contemplate a new vi- sion of our relationship to nature, be that as a modest and limited revisioning, such as the need for greater pollution control legislation, or the expansive vision of deep ecological philosophies and variations on that theme. Animals arise as a</page><page sequence="13">ANIMALS, ATTITUDES, AND ANTHROPOMORPHIC SENTIMENT 41 highly visible and logical subset of the new environmental awareness and greater respect is accorded them as a somewhat incidental beneficiary in this cultural wave. The rigid hierarchical and competitive patriarchal structure of our society is being eroded with invisible gradualness and that erosión is leading to the rise of more nurturing feminine soci- ety. Granted, the most tentative first steps have been taken, and a great deal of resistance is in store but it seems we have taken an irreversible step toward considering a more feminine consensus-promoting way of functioning in our culture that will not abide the blanket exclusion of countless fellow travel- ers on spaceship earth from consideration in our decision- making processes, and this feminine undermining of patriar- chal rigidity, in its best moments, seems capable of extending its nurturing instinct to nature and ánimals, as well as people. These ideas tap several of the dimensions which appear in the literature on animal welfare and animal rights. A recurrent theme is that our society and our culture are changing (post-industrialization) and that a confluence of factors such as environmentalism, health consciousness, and an expanding philosophy of civil rights has produced a new, yet nascent, construction of reality in which animals are no longer seen just as meat and fur but sentient creatures with interests and rights. Such ideas of "interests" and "rights" are fueling the fires of legal, ethical, and spiritual debates throughout this country and others. We will end this paper with a brief summary and discussion of some of the more salient issues of these debates. Summary And Conclusions Western civilization is changing the way it views animals. Once seen only as meat, fur, beasts of burden, and then as companions, animals now are being redefined by a minority of people concerned with animals as feeling creatures having rights similar to humans. These animal rightists have a philosophy different from the animal welfarists in that the former work to attain legal and ethical recognition of the "rights" of animals to fulfill their interests and lead lives free of harm from humans. As to the counterpart of rights, that of duties, however, a distinction is made in that animals are to be seen not as moral agents but as moral patients. Tom Regan (1983, p.154) makes the case that animals, like young children and some of the mentally handicapped, are to be given a moral status within a system that</page><page sequence="14">42 INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF MODERN SOCIOLOGY holds, "Moral patients can do nothing right or wrong that affects or involves moral agents, but moral agents can do what is right or wrong in ways that affect or involve moral patients/' This view is one that pervades much of the animal rights philosophy - that is, we have been and are doing wrong by treating animals as food or fur, or by using them harshly in our pursuit of recreation and fun. We become moral savages by continuing to enslave, torture, and cannibalize our fellow animals when other sorts of food stuffs, styles of entertainment, and scientific research strategies are available. This message, then, adds to our responsibility to change our speciecentrism and to join the movement to free ourselves and the animals we keep in bondage from such inhumane circumstances. The intent of the animal rights movement, then, is to bring about a different definition of the situation, a different construction of reality, concerning the place of animals in the world. How has this happened? What are some of the correlates of this phenomenon? First, our argument is that due to the characteristics of post-industrial society people no longer have an up close and personal relationship with the food chain. Second, they have, through the anthropomorphic sentimentalism de- scribed so eloquently by Jasper and Nelkin (1992), adopted pets as com- panions and have participated in a media and consumer culture full of an- thropomorphic images. Third, as animals became redefined as intelligent sentient creatures at the "front stage" level, they were concomitantly slaughtered, skinned, and brutalized in the back stage. This collective cognitive dissonance, along with trends' in environmentalism, better health practices, ambivalence towards science, medicine, and technology, and an increasing concern with civil rights, personal freedom, and femi- nist issues, combined to fuel the fire of activism so prevalent in the 1980s and today. With missionary zeal and the potential of direct mail solicita- tion to feed the coffers of the morally indignant and outraged, the "moral crusade" of animal rights was born. The movement was aided by celeb- rity endorsements and, possibly, by a feeling of the potency of action in the cause of animals that could not be obtained in human causes. (A degree of frustration often occurs in a social movement due to uncoopera- tive or unappreciative recipients; in the animal rights crusade the benefac- tors are anthropomorphically assumed to be grateful for rescue, release, rstoration, or relocation..). Finally, just how far can the animal rights movement go? Can the movement turn people around to the point they will become vegans who wear no leather or fur. The answer is Kyes' Many converts to vegetarian- ism or veganism have been made by the movement. A number of people have refused to buy fur coats and in Trafalgar square in London a rally was recently held by the anti-fur group LYNX where hundreds of furs</page><page sequence="15">ANIMALS, ATTITUDES, AND ANTHROPOMORPHIC SENTIMENT 43 were turned in for a. "dignified cremation" (CBS 60 minutes Transcript, December 8, 1991, p.13). Princess Di will no longer wear fur and the elaborate department store Harrod's, after selling all its fur stock at ridiculously low prices, declared it would not restock fur coats. Actions by the Animal Liberation Frönt and LYNX have brought about the closing of "about two-thiřds" of thç shops of British furriers (CBS 60 Minutes Transcript, December 8, 1991, p.14). There are limits, however, to the impact the animal rights movement can have without backlash effects. Jasper and Nelkin (1992, p.174) suc- cinctly state that: The radicalization of the animal protection movement has had its costs. As in so many other protest movements, stridency, denunciation, and demonization of enemies have often precluded communication, ne- gotiation, and resolution... To animal rights activists, those who exploit animals are brutal, cruel and self serving torturers; to the targeted groups, the animal rightists are ignorant fanatics, fascist in their sweeping de- mands. Each side portrays the other as wealthy, powerful and dangerous. Each side relies on emotional visual appeals, and accuses the other of cheap emotionalism and surreptitious infiltration. Regardless of theextent of future activity of the numerous organiza- tions that make up the animal rights movement, the impact has already been keenly felt in the U.S. and other western countries. These activists have recognized that a post-industrial back stage has been created regard- ing the use of animals and animal byproducts and have attempted to bring to the front stage of societal consciousness the events and process that take place therein. They are the directors of the drama of animal rights and are, thereby, helping to redefine meat and fur in post-industrial society. The continuing drama is replete with ethical, legal, and social quagmires that future participants will have to confront. REFERENCES Bryant, Clifton D. 1979.
