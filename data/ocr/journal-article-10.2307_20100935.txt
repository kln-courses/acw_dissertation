Maimonides' Guide of the Perplexed and the Kabbalah MOSHE IDEL The Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Izrael Abstract. Medieval Jewish mysticism was a multiform project in which Maimonides played different roles, for different mystical streams, and at different times. Maimonides' impact on Kabbalah was such that understanding the histories of both medieval Jewish philosophy and mysticism requires a more integrative approach than is usually adopted. The investigation into the activities of Abraham Abulafia as Maimonidean commentator and publicist undertaken here illustrates this point. Al-Andalus redivivus Maimonides emerged as a major figure in Jewish thought and religious life in a period of unprecedented Jewish cultural rebirth, which was marked by an openness toward theological and especially philosoph ical ideas, and, in particular, as these ideas were mimetic of Arabic learning. Yet exposure to Arabic thought also made this into a time of perplexity, which also meant that the "perplexed" required "guidance." However, the most creative center for Jewish-Ar ab cultural interac tion, Al-Andalus, had been decimated. The Almohade invasions of the twelfth century brought with them destruction, forced conversion, but also Jewish emigration, included that of Maimonides' family. This last event was fateful for subsequent Jewish culture. Innumerable essays and books have discussed Maimonides' writings and much attention has been paid to the controversies surrounding them and their historical setting. Yet little has been said to clarify the history of the diffusion of these works and their reception in dif ferent periods, regions, and intellectual circles. By this, I do not mean the history of when Maimonides' great philosophical work, the Guide of the Perplexed, arrived in a new location, the cataloguing of which people constituted its readership, and the kind of commentaries that it provoked or the differences between them. These issues, however important, are the building blocks of a greater edifice. And this was the gradual emergence of the Guide of the Perplexed as a canonical text. Any process of canonization relates not only to contextual issues, *</page><page sequence="2">198 MOSHE IDEL but also to the processes of diffusion. With these concerns in mind, let us turn to the first wave of the Guide's reception in European climes. European supporters of Maimonidean philosophy at the beginning of the thirteenth century were members of what might be called a "secondary elite," intellectuals of Andalusian origin who had emigrated to the Christian Spanish North after the Almohade invasion of the Andalusian South. Maimonides and his family crossed to Africa and then moved East to Egypt. Families like the ibn Tibbons and the Kimhis found refuge in Southern France. The reception of the Guide in these (still) Arabic speaking Jewish intellectual circles in Southwestern France closed, figuratively speaking, a cultural gap: the two wings of Andalusian Jewish culture destroyed by the Almohades decades earlier reestablished communication, reanimating cultural affinities created in the distinctive cultural milieu of Muslim Spain.1 What stands out is not their mastery of Arabic, but the shared propensity for Arabic philosophy. For this reason, Andalusian intellectuals, even in France, translated, publicized, disseminated, and defended Maimonides' Guide, itself composed in Arabic.2 They carried on their activities, however, in the presence of imposing - and indigenous - rabbinical figures, whom I would call a "first elite," and which was exceedingly influential. It suffices to mention Abraham ben David of Posquierres, Meshullam ben Jacob, Moses ben Nahman (Nahmanides), and Jonah Gerondi, who approached Maimonidean philosophy cautiously. The Andalusian intellectuals touting Maimonides thus faced considerable, and active, resistance, against which they could not prevail, and even more so, because the "first elites" opposing them were supported by Rabbinic authorities in Germany and Northern France. The first steps of the Guide in Europe were accompanied by controversy and suspicion. It achieved quasi-canonical status only by the mid-thirteenth century. Maimonides' Guide of the Perplexed is the first sustained attempt to interpret Judaism in philosophical terms, and it was certainly the most influential, as both the "Great Eagle's" followers and opponents well understood. Kabbalists, too, whose writings would gradually come to dominate Spanish Jewish culture during the thirteenth century, felt the enthusiasm the Guide generated - and the turmoil as well.3 Yet even among Kabbalists in southern France, a more positive attitude toward the Guide gradually emerged, by about the middle of the thir teenth century, and which would flourish toward the century's end and through the beginning of the fourteenth. This r??valuation parallels a widening interest in the Guide that extended beyond the circles of the Andalusian refugees. In the brief period between 1270 and 1290,</page><page sequence="3">MAIMONIDES' GUIDE OF THE PERPLEXED AND THE KABBALAH 199 commentaries on the Guide multiplied in both philosophical and Kab balistic camps. During no other period, have so many commentaries on the Guide been produced. This was the result of two distinct processes. The first was the respite from the enmity the initial controversy over the Guide had generated and which the second controversy at the end of the thirteenth century would rekindle. Second, and requiring some explanation, commentaries on the Guide must be seen as part of the surge in Kabbalistic literature written at this time, a period I have designated elsewhere as Kabbalistic lore's "window of opportunity."4 Some thirteenth century Kabbalists and the Guide By and large, the scholarly picture of relations between Maimonidean views, especially as sustained by his philosophically orientated follow ers, and the basic Kabbalistic outlook has stressed discord rather than possible concert.5 Discord is an appropriate term to describe many of the encounters between Maimonidean thought and that of the early theosophical-theurgical Kabbalists. I have pointed out elsewhere the divergence between the two kinds of thinking and argued that many early Kabbalistic discussions came together where they tacitly criticized Maimonides' understanding of focal issues in Jewish esotericism.6 By contrast, it is clear that by the second half of the thirteenth century, Maimonidean thought had decisively influenced ecstatic and linguistic Kabbalah. Again elsewhere I have surveyed the different intellectual maneuvers that were typical of these brands of Kabbalah in appro priating Maimonidean views.7 Here, however, I will concentrate on issues related to the sociology of knowledge, specifically, how the Guide achieved its status and spread in both Kabbalistic and non-Kabbalistic circles. However, to begin with a more cultural observation, the places in France that Maimonides' Guide reached were centers of intensely cre ative Jewish culture. Some works of Jewish philosophy had already been translated from Arabic, Neoplatonic thought was known from a variety of sources,8 and some Kabbalistic traditions had already been handed down in the family of Abraham ben David of Posquierres. While dramatically influential, the Guide's reception was very complex, not the least given this rich and variegated background. The following state ment of R. Jacob ben Sheshet, a Kabbalist active in Catalonia during the second third of the thirteenth century, illustrates the point well. R. Jacob was dealing with Maimonides' interpretation of a Midrashic statement:</page><page sequence="4">200 MOSHE IDEL God was contemplating the Torah,9 and he saw the essences10 in Himself, since the essences were in the [attribute of] Wisdom,11 [and] he discerned that they are prone to reveal themselves. This version I heard in the name of R. Isaac son of the R. Abra ham of blessed memory.12 And this was also the opinion of the Rabbi, the author of [The Book of] Knowledge [Mai monides], who said that God, knowing Himself, knows all the existent [creatures].13 Nevertheless, the Rabbi was aston ished - in part 2, chapter 6 of the Guide - at the dictum of our sages that God does not do anything before He contemplates His retinue,14 and he quoted there Plato's dictum that God, blessed be He, contemplates the intellectual world, and He emanates from there the emanation [that produces] reality.15 Maimonides has pointed out the affinity between a rabbinic under standing of creation by God's self-contemplation and a Platonic view, an observation of historical note, since various scholars attribute a Pla tonic origin to the rabbinic view.16 Yet where is Maimonides headed? Surely, he was "astonished" for more than one reason, possibly hinting at the anthropomorphic implication of the verb "to look" in both the rabbinic and Platonic dicta, but also possibly implying that the identity between the two views raises questions about the Jewish origins of a view he rejects. However, the Neoplatonic background of the statement by R. Isaac the Blind, the founder of ben Sheshet's Kabbalistic school, pushed him to neglect Maimonides' reservation and, instead, to emphasize Platonic Kabbalistic lines of thought, by doing which, he no doubt believed he was keeping faith with a tradition he had learned from his teachers, but also with the rabbinic position, both backed by the authority of Plato. Maimonides' Aristotelian revolution17 thus created problems: its difference from the rabbinic position is explicit, as well as from that of Plato; it also parts ways with Kabbalistic tradition. Yet Ben Sheshet in fact had conflated two different Maimonidean passages: the first, in the Mishneh Torah, where his argument (stem ming ultimately from Themistius) presents God as comprising the forms of all existent beings, which God may then cognize by an act of self intellection;18 the second, in the Guide, where Maimonides vigorously opposes the "simplistic" interpretation of the Midrashic dictum that God created the world by contemplating the Torah as the blueprint of the reality. Ben Sheshet considers these two views identical, and he is surprised that Maimonides inconsistently accepts the first while rejecting the second. In its place, Ben Sheshet accepts the position of</page><page sequence="5">MAIMONIDES' GUIDE OF THE PERPLEXED AND THE KABBALAH 201 R. Isaac the Blind, which is less concerned with divine self-intellection19 and is presented before introducing the two Maimonidean views. The truth of Maimonides' second view is implicitly rejected, whereas he accepts Plato's dictum as correct; he had quoted it from the Guide only in order to refute it. This confrontation between Aristotle and Plato in this early Kab balistic text well exemplifies one of the main developments in medieval Jewish thought. Medieval Jewish thinkers appropriated a variety of Greek views, which came to inform the contents of Jewish speculative thought and, at times, point to the relationship between competing trends. Maimonides, the greatest Jewish exponent of Aristotle, had to oppose Aristotle's master, Plato, which in turn generated opposition to Maimonides himself. I offer another example, in which a Neoplatonic view is privileged over that of Maimonides. In his Hassagot on the Guide, to which we will return below, R. Joseph Gikatilla writes: Mas aseh Merkavah is the divine science and it requires an explanation; if it is the divine science [then] there is noth ing material in it and it depends on God and the angels ... But it is worthwhile to know why Ezekiel's Account of the Chariot comprises three worlds also according to the view of our master Moses, blessed be his memory. But our view is that Max aseh Merkavah is the secret of the [emanative] concatenation20 of all the things and their sustenance, each from the other, from the first emanation21 to the navel of the earth, and the matter of the Merkavah is "for there is high one who watches over him who is high; and there are yet higher ones over them" [Eccl. 5:7].22 Unlike Maimonides' more static vision of Mav aseh Merkavah, Gikatilla's interpretation is informed by the concept of the great chain of be ing, which connects every link to the next.23 Exploiting the Hebrew meaning of Merkavah as a complex of different components, Gikatilla introduces the topic of shalshelet, a chain, a term that served Kabbalists to point to the concept of uninterrupted emanation.24 By adopting this Neoplatonic way of thinking, Gikatilla distanced himself from Mai monides' Aristotelian stance. This reservation, however, is only the start of Gikatilla's move toward a "linguistic" interpretation of Mav aseh Merkavah.2^</page><page sequence="6">202 MOSHE IDEL Shifting spiritual interests It was only in the last third of the thirteenth century that a Spanish philosopher first composed a commentary on the Guide, R. Shem Tov Falaquera. Like their French predecessors, the members of the new wave of Maimonideans in the Iberian and Italian peninsulas were "secondary elites."26 According to Abraham Abulafia, a Kabbalist and commenta tor on the Guide, those who were engaged in studying the Guide were searching for modes of thought that went beyond what was to be had in rabbinic literature. Abulafia wrote this in 1291, at the end of his literary career. He categorized four approaches to Judaism in his time: The third group ... consists of the sages of the Talmud who studied the wisdom of philosophy and comprehended fully the view of the philosophers. But they could not make peace with what they knew from the Talmud, which is why they pursued the second path in order to put their minds at rest. They alighted on the path of the sages of inquiry, those called philosophers, yet their minds were still not at rest, and they had to trouble themselves to find a third way, which perhaps would give them intellectual peace. Then they found the path of the sages of the first Kabbalah,27 which is that of the sages of the sefirot. And when they heard their opinions and were told wondrous secrets concerning them,28 they were delighted, and accepted them, and they said to each other: "Until here shall we come and not go beyond it." And then their opinion was settled on the ["sefirotic"] Kabbalah.29 Even though this fourfold categorization is overly rigid, and was com posed after a sharp controversy between Abulaifa and R. Shelomo ibn Adret, a Kabbalist and talmudist, Abulafia's description still merits close analysis as a key better to understand post-Maimonidean de velopments. Abulafia's leitmotif is the unquenched intellectual thirst of people who experimented with one mode of religious knowledge or another. Uneasiness with rabbinic materials led some to embrace philosophy; in turn, disappointment with philosophy aroused interest in the Kabbalah. This thirst for more advanced forms of knowledge was not new. Rabbi Bahya ibn Paquda's Sefer Hovot ha-Levavot makes this clear. Nevertheless, this sharp delineation of four groups is found nowhere in earlier sources. Maimonides may have intended his book for perplexed individuals in the Islamic environment, but these intentions would have been similarly valid in Christian Spain and Italy, too, where</page><page sequence="7">MAIMONIDES' GUIDE OF THE PERPLEXED AND THE KABBALAH 203 it would not be wrong to label a group of scholars, corresponding to the "second elite" above, as Hakhmei Moreh ha-Nevokhim, the sages of the Guide of the Perplexed?? This name, I suggest, is also applicable to the thinkers who instructed Abulafia himself in the secrets of the Guide. These spiritual seekers, members of the "secondary elite," consti tuted a group more intellectually flexible, creative, and sometimes more itinerant than members of the "first." Some of those who become Kabbalists - after being Maimonideans31 - formed the highly produc tive core of the circle that may be named that of the "innovative" Kabbalah. Abulafia's description reveals that Kabbalists are not by definition thinkers who opposed the Guide, but those who, through its study, could not satisfy their spiritual quest. Thus, they portray the Guide as one element in a spiritual itinerary that might culminate in the theosophical, or even the ecstatic, Kabbalah. Though sometimes they call philosophy and especially the Guide by strongly negative terms, such as an "illness,"32 they saw both as supplying essential ele ments, including "negative theology," for arriving at sublime religious experience.33 Abulafia thought it necessary to transcend the Guide's fascination with negativity, but he did not propose its obliteration. Philosophy, especially the Guide, should be integrated into the more comprehensive path leading to ecstatic experience. Abulafia's own Odyssey included a transition from the study of the Guide to the creation of a linguistically oriented Kabbalah, which he believed leads to prophecy.34 His actions were idiosyncratic, though not unique. Preceding Abulafia's transition to a stance less consonant with Maimonidean views was R. Isaac ben Abraham ibn Latif's Shasar ha-Shamayyim, written in 1238, clearly under the enchantment of the Guide. Yet already here Neoplatonic influences are crucial.35 Eventu ally, ibn Latif distanced himself from the Guide and embraced a more symbolic mode of expression, close, but not identical to that of the theosophical Kabbalah. Kabbalistic commentaries on the Guide Kabbalists, therefore, contributed to the circulation of ideas found in the Guide regardless of whether they agreed with them. This was true even in Maimonides' own family, where mystical leanings were not hidden.36 There were even Muslim37 and Christian38 mystics who studied the Guide. During the thirteenth century, Kabbalists composed five commentaries on the Guide, three by Rabbi Abraham Abulafia,39</page><page sequence="8">204 MOSHE IDEL one by Rabbi Joseph Gikatilla,0 and a fifth, though anonymous, which discusses issues pertinent to the Guide, yet has affinities to Abulafia's Kabbalah.41 A spurious (anonymous) letter claims that Maimonides en gaged in Kabbalah and astral magic,42 and an otherwise unidentifiable pseudepigrapha presents views close to those of the young R. Joseph Gikatilla.43 In the same period, Jewish philosophers composed only three commentaries on the Guide: two in Italy, those of R. Moshe ben Shlomo of Salerno44 and R. Zerahiah Gracian ben Shealtiel Hen,45 respectively, and a third in Christian Spain, the Sefer Moreh ha-Moreh of R. Shem Tov ben Joseph Falaquera. It is noteworthy that nei ther Provence, where Maimonides' greatest admirers were active, nor Christian Spain was the locus of the composition of the first full com mentaries on the Guide. Abulafia composed one of his three commentaries in Italy, where he also studied the Guide with R. Hillel of Verona, and taught it as well, in Capua. It was in Italy, too, that a controversy broke out between radical and moderate interpretations of the Guide in the last decades of the thirteenth century,46 although many of the participants had Spanish connections. This was true of Zerahiah and Abulafia, as well as of R. Hillel of Verona, who had most likely been a student in Christian Spain. Italy was strictly the host - or, to reformulate: its own achievements in scholastic philosophy aside, Italy was dependent on Spanish masters when it came to studying and disseminating the Guide, and for Kabbalistic learning, too. If the numerical advantage of Kabbalistic over philosophical com mentaries on the Guide in the thirteenth century says anything, it is that in the thirteenth century some students viewed Maimonides as closer to mysticism than we have previously thought. Alexander Altmann47 and Gershom Scholem48 dedicated important studies to mystical interpretations of Maimonides. But the issues remain wide open, as does the special desirability of studying them, not the least because scholars have recently pointed to passages in the Guide having a mystical bent. Our knowledge of thirteenth century intellectual, his torical, and even philological innovation will be measurably increased.49 An important question in weighing the relative importance of Kab balistic to philosophical commentaries on the Guide is whether the Kabbalistic commentaries are extant in unique or multiple manuscripts, and whether this is also true of philosophical commentaries. The figures at my disposal are tentative, yet I believe representative. Based upon the catalogue of the Institute of Microfilms of Hebrew Manuscripts at the Jewish National and University Library, I would say that manu</page><page sequence="9">MAIMONIDES' GUIDE OF THE PERPLEXED AND THE KABBALAH 205 scripts containing Kabbalistic commentaries are more numerous than those containing thirteenth century philosophical commentaries. Only two manuscripts preserve Abulafia's first commentary on the Guide, Sefer ha-Ge'ulah, in the original Hebrew, and then in mutilated and fragmentary condition. A Latin translation prepared by Flavius Mithri dates preserves this work almost entirely.50 Abulafia's second commen tary, Sefer Hayyei ha-Nefesh, survives in about eleven manuscripts, and his third commentary, Sefer Sitrei Torah, survives in twenty-nine manu scripts, as well as in a Latin translation by Mithridates. By contrast, no manuscript preserves Gikatilla's Hassagot. Philosophical commentaries are extant in fewer manuscripts: that of Moses of Salerno in seven, Zer ahiah's in eight, and ibn Falaquera's, twelve, or a total of twenty-seven. One cannot say with certainty that these figures properly represent the overall cultural map. They may be meaningful for only limited regions - here, Italy - but even so, they do suggest the need to reconsider current notions of the Guide's reception. A further caution is that the scribes who copied these manuscripts were working in intellectual environments different from those in which the original works were composed, meaning that estimating the link age between numbers and original motivation must remain tentative. Nonetheless, it is difficult to let go of the idea that in the thirteenth century there was greater interest in Kabbalistic interpretations than in philosophical ones. This same applies to citations from those man uscripts, although here, in particular, the research is too preliminary to draw conclusions going beyond impressions drawn from reading the manuscripts during the last two decades.51 We are indeed in the early stages of gauging the Kabbalists' contribution as interpreters of the Guide, and we know little more about how the Kabbalists' own writings spread or about their role in disseminating the Guide itself. No one was born a Kabbalist, and, as noted above, some influential thirteenth century Kabbalists had studied philosophy before embarking on the study of Kabbalah. This made them not only Maimonides' students, however at a remove, and his continuators, too, but also those who discussed his ideas, approvingly or otherwise, which only served to increase Maimonides' fame. The Guide's diffusion We may view the Guide as a catalyst. It did not channel dissension neatly, with philosophers and Kabbalists taking opposing sides, pro and con; philosophers like Crescas criticized the work. What the Guide</page><page sequence="10">206 MOSHE IDEL achieved was an intellectual awakening that prompted scholars of op posing schools to sort out their ideas. Rabbinic elites did not adopt the ancient tactic of "killing by silence," and there were Kabbalists on both sides of the fence. What is more, exaggerated as this claim may appear, it was a Kabbalist, Abraham Abulafia, who was responsible for the first aggressive distribution of the Guide over a wide area. Study of the Kabbalah thus has much to tell us that is new about the controver sies surrounding the Guide's appearance, especially in Europe. One of Abulafia's commentaries on the Guide, for instance, the 'Otzar "Eden Ganuz leaves no doubt that in many places the Guide was not received as eagerly as was the Mishneh Torah: Afterwards, his intelligence did not leave him ... but God aroused him again and he composed the treatise The Guide of the Perplexed ... and when he did it, he did not do it in our language but, due to a certain circumstance, it was translated by two translators into the Holy language, and many students studied it.52 Abulafia went on to say that these same students attributed to the Guide ideas that a close reading will not corroborate. But implicit here is a certain negativity. The students did not follow Maimonides' rec ommendation to bind together the passages and sections of the Guide dealing with similar topics,53 prompting Abulafia, in turn, to teach the Guide just this way. An autobiographical comment by Abulafia's from 1286, too important not to cite in full, also indicates the Guide's wide-scale diffusion: ... and the spirit of the Lord had aroused me and I took my wife54 and I intended to come to the Waters of Ravena55 in order to study there Torah,56 and while I was in the city of Capua, which is found at a distance of five days from Rome, I chanced upon a noble man, wise and sagacious, a philosopher and an expert physician, R. Hillel, blessed be his memory.57 I joined him, and I studied with him a little bit the science of philosophy, and it become sweet to me immediately.58 I made efforts to know it with all my powers, day and night. My mind did not cool down until I studied the Guide of the Perplexed, several times, and I also taught it in many places: In Capua, to four [students], accidentally, but they went on erroneous ways, since they were thoughtless young men, and I left them. And at Thebes [I had] ten [students] and none of them [profited</page><page sequence="11">MAIMONIDES' GUIDE OF THE PERPLEXED AND THE KABBALAH 207 from the teaching] but they spoiled the two ways,59 the first and the second. In Eurypo60 four [students] and there also there was no one who profited since the thoughts of men are different from each other a fortiori regarding the depth61 of the wisdom and the Sitrei Torah, and I did not see one of them who was worthy to deliver to him even the notes of the truth as it is.62 In Rome [I taught the Guide] to two elders of the city, R. Zedaqiah and R. Yeshayah, my allies,63 blessed be their memory, and they succeeded in a limited way, but they died, for they were very old. In Barcelona two [students], one of them an old one, R. Kalonymos, blessed be his memory, a venerable man, and one young man, learned and intelligent and very respected, from the aristocracy of the city, whose name was R. Jehudah, named Salmon;64 he succeeded in a very excellent way. At Burgos two [students], a master and [his] student. The name of the master [was] R. Moses Chinfa,65 a great man and an honorable scholar.66 And the name of the student is R. Shem Tov,67 also a kind and good young man, but his youth prevented him from learning. So he did not study it [the Guide], except for a few external traditions, neither he nor his master. In Medinat Shalom68 two [students], one of them, R. Samuel the Prophet who received from me a few traditions, and the second, R. Joseph Gikatilla69 ... But in this city where I am today [1286], whose name is Sinim,70 namely Messina, I found six persons, and I brought with me a seventh one, and they have studied it with me [again, the Guide] for a very short time. Everyone received whatever he received from me, more or less, and they all left me,71 with the exception of one, who is the first who was the first cause impelling each of them to study what he I taught. His name is R. Sav adiah72 the son of Yitzhaq Sigilmasi, blessed be his memory.'0 What precisely was Abulafia teaching? Ben Zion Dinur long ago sug gested that Abulafia was spreading Kabbalah.74 Scholem's final descrip tion of Abulafia's activity during his wanderings is ambiguous; Scholem does not refer to Abulafia's teaching the Guide at all.75 But should we read the passage, which is unique in the entire literature concerning the spread of the Guide, in the context of not only teaching the Guide, but on a second level, too, as its opening lines urge us to do, the claims of the students make sense. As I see it, Abulafia taught the Guide for at least seven years, and it was during this time that he composed his</page><page sequence="12">208 MOSHE IDEL three commentaries. The breadth of his didactic peregrinations as he propagated knowledge of the Guide was astounding, encompassing Cat alonia, Castile, Greece, the Italian peninsula, and Sicily. No philosopher teaching the Guide could match this record. In addition, Abulafia alone taught the Guide following two methods. At first, he taught its simple meaning, reading it chapter by chapter, line by line. But then he began to introduce advanced students to mystical and esoteric interpretations of topics as he found them in the Guide.76 Abulafia also lists more city-names than he does students, which he does disregarding the chronological order of his travels, which at times seem to be presented in reverse order. He begins the list with Capua, where he stayed in 1264 and later on in early 1280, yet only further down does he mention the Greek cities he visited a year earlier. His stays in Catalonia and Castile came long before his second stay in Italy and Greece. But, then, Abulafia's intention was not, or so it seems, to write an orderly travelogue; it was to talk about students and his teaching methods. This likely explains why he names only those students who successfully absorbed his teaching, or some part of it (we shall return to its content below). He reports failures without names. The successes appear in the second half of the list, the failures in the first. The list also ends with the name of R. Joseph Gikatilla, who is introduced as an accomplished disciple. Consequently, the list does is gradated according to a scale of increasing success. It is also clear that the principal successes were in Christian Spain, the failures in Greece and to a lesser extent Italy. Some of the Spanish students are described as very successful, others less, but none a failure. The progressive weakening corresponds to the levels and intensity of Jewish intellectual activity moving from West to East, the western cen ters being the strongest and most receptive, the eastern ones, especially in Byzantine zones, the weakest.77 The higher number of students in the East, fourteen, as compared to six in both Italian and Spanish regions, possibly points to repeated failing attempts. No less, if not more, probable is that the greater numbers who approached Abulafia in the East may have been a function of his attractiveness to the smaller Eastern communities, where opportunities to study with scholars of renown were few, whatever these scholars' intellectual interests. As one moved westward to Italy and, of course, Spain, intellectual possibilities grew apace. Though the number of students Abulafia attracted in the West was lower, they seem to have been specially talented or simply inclined to his brand of learning and teaching style.</page><page sequence="13">MAIMONIDES' GUIDE OF THE PERPLEXED AND THE KABBALAH 209 There was also the matter of intellectual climate. In Christian Spain, interest in Kabbalah was growing precisely when Abulafia was wander ing through the region, the late seventies of the thirteenth century. In Italy and Byzantium, the kind of mysticism then current in Spain was as yet, one imagines, unknown. Abulafia himself was relatively unconcerned with the theosophical Kabbalah of his Spanish contempo raries, although he was instrumental in spreading some of its literary products in Italy about 1280.78 Yet Abulafia's own brand of mysticism, which combines Maimonidean metaphysics and psychology with the Ashkenazi mystical practice of combinations of letters, strikes one as out of stride for areas where Maimonidean theology had penetrated less successfully than it had in Spain. Moreover, where Maimonidean writings had penetrated Italy, they had done so in their philosophical guise; admittedly, the writings of R. Menahem ben Benjamin Recanati were soon to presage a mystical turn.79 In Spain, during the second half of the thirteenth century, some of the younger Jewish intelligentsia were searching out spiritual alternatives. To my knowledge, the cited passage from 'Otzar "Eden Ganuz has no parallel among extant itineraries of itinerant Jewish teachers. Ab ulafia traversed unusually large distances, and he did so during at least sixteen years. No less unprecedented (both before, and, for that matter, afterward) was Abulafia's concentration on the Guide, not to mention that he was the first to propagate a specifically Kabbalistic interpretation. His teaching, as said, encompassed both the traditional line by line approach, seeking out the plain sense of the text. But it extended, too, to a mystical probing of "the depths of wisdom" and the Sitrei Torah. Since some of the students were taught the second way of reading the Guide, we may see in the propagation of the esoteric reading of the Guide the first attempt to disseminate Kabbalah beyond Spain, the stronghold of this lore in the second half of the 13th century. Abulafia's was, in fact, the first form of specifically medieval mysticism taught in Italy, Sicily, and Greece. His journeys to these lands and his teaching of his own brand of ecstatic Kabbalah there via an esoteric interpretation of the Guide mark the initial spread of the Kabbalah beyond its Iberian birthplace. The passage from the 'Otzar "Eden Ganuz that we have been ex amining bears witness to all this. Its implications also transcend the importance of Abulafia's pioneering role. As the first exponent of Kab balah in areas where the classical forms of Spanish Kabbalah, whether Catalan or Castilian, were unknown, Abulafia ensured the later influ ence of ecstatic Kabbalah in both Italy and Byzantine territories. From</page><page sequence="14">210 MOSHE IDEL his descriptions, it is clear, too, that many of Abulafia's students were young and that they were personally attracted to the wandering mystic, indeed, seemingly at first sight, with tension arising only later on. We should also note that as (probably) the first known text to describe teaching mystical traditions to the young, this selection from the from 'Otzar "Eden Ganuz reminds us that in the Kabbalah's initial stages, age was not yet the impediment preventing the teaching of advanced esoteric traditions that it would become toward the thirteenth century's end - although Abulafia did think that some of his students were too young fully to appreciate what he taught. Others, he deemed unwor thy of the Guide's profounder understanding, specifically, his students in Peloponese. The resistance Abulafia encountered on occasion may be attributable not to the student's age, but, as with the already well-known R. Moses of Burgos, to membership in the "first elite." Abulafia mentions no outside opposition to his teachings; students and master alone determined their content. However, this is not certain. At Capua, the Jewish community may have come between Abulafia and his students, eventually alienating them. Nonetheless, though the fruits of his efforts were meager, when all is said and done, Abulafia did not resort to verbal acidity. Rather, he seems to have reacted to the generally cold reception accorded his mystical doctrines with a measure of stoicism, which also suited his perception of the "human condition." He may have also sensed failure in propagating his idio syncratic esotericism, which he attempted to do by teaching what he called the "supernal Kabbalah."80 Yet even he thought teaching on this level should be reserved for those who had already completed a more traditional course of the Guide's study. Success or failure aside, however, there is no denying that judging by the reach of even his ex oteric teaching, Abulafia contributed substantially, perhaps more than anyone else, to the Guide's broad distribution. A literary genre Abulafia, it turns out, was critical of most of his students; R. Joseph ben Abraham Gikatilla was a rare, although not the sole, exception. In turn, Gikatilla is the only student who mentions Abulafia by name. In one of his earlier Kabbalistic writings, Sod ha-Niqqud, he mentions "Rabbi Abraham, the teacher of the intellectual things," or according to another version, "Rabbi Abraham, the eye of the intellectual light."81 The first phrase in Hebrew is Moreh ha-sikhliyyut, which may point to Abulafia's teaching the Guide, whose Hebrew title is Moreh ha</page><page sequence="15">MAIMONIDES' GUIDE OF THE PERPLEXED AND THE KABBALAH 211 Nevokhim. Abulafia finished his first commentary to the Guide, the Sefer ha-Ge'ulah in 1273;82 Gikatilla apparently wrote Sod ha-Niqqud before 1274.83 Returning to Abulafia, he described Gikatilla, as follows: ... R. Joseph Gikatilla, may God, the keeper of the degrees, keep him,84 and he doubtless succeeded in a wondrous way concerning what he has studied under my guidance, and he added much from his strength and knowledge and God was with him.85 As Abulafia pointed out, his former student became a prolific Kabbalist, although eventually he shifted to a linguistically oriented Kabbalah unlike that of Abulafia. In the interim, Gikatilla composed a commen tary on the Guide.86 Was it the composition of this treatise, or at least his acceptance of the Guide's importance, that elicited Abulafia's sympathetic attitude? It is also possible that Abulafia never knew of Gikatilla's commentary, the intermittent contacts between the two scholars possibly accounting for affinities between their commentaries: both, for example, used the gematria: temunah?partzuf 'Adam.87 Still details like this one count for little. Nahmanides, too, notes this gema tria, but he learned it from the work of R. Eleazar of Worms.88 More significant are literary similarities. Neither Abulafia nor Gikatilla com ment on the Guide following Maimonides' order. Rather, in distinction to normally point by point philosophical interpretations, both worked thematically - albeit Gikatilla is less concerned than Abulafia with dis closing the secrets purportedly scattered throughout the Guide, which Abulafia did systematically. It should be added that in his Hassagot, as his commentary is known, Gikatilla is far more critical toward the Guide (although he is not wholly dismissive of it) than Abulafia. Gikatilla knew the Guide intimately, and his critical acumen was great, enabling him to speak sharply of Jehudah Al-Harizi's translation of the Guide into Hebrew. He points to at least four errors,89 and, in a fifth reference, he claims Al-Harizi did not understand Maimonides.90 Such a criticism, it should be noted, points to the circulation of the Guide's Arabic original among Spanish Kabbalists. By contrast, Abu lafia never mentioned mistakes in the Hebrew translation of the Guide - he generally relied on ibn Tibbon's translation - although, as just noted, Abulafia, as a rule, was less critical in matters concerning the Guide than was Gikatilla. Abulafia also seems to have had no qualms in adopting interpretative techniques Maimonides himself recommended. Here, at least, it was not cardinal for Abulafia that the Guide, as he saw it, did not contain the ultimate revelation of the Torah's secrets, or</page><page sequence="16">212 MOSHE IDEL that, in his estimation, its esoteric doctrine was of lesser value than his own (Kabbalistic one). In the Sefer Hayyei ha-Nefesh, Abulafia claims the misunderstandings of the Guide might be avoided, should students: ... inquire in this book in a worthy fashion, as he [Maimonides] commanded us to do in his "Instruction," namely, to connect its chapters to each other and interpret each and every word found in its discussion. Even when those words were unrelated to the intention of a chapter, they [its students] would wholly understand his [Maimonides] intention.91 This suggestion paraphrases Maimonides' recommendations at the start of the Guide?2 But Abulafia really meant to explain why many readers failed to understand the Guide; his intention was also to justify his special form of inquiry. The words of a second (anonymous) Kabbalist seem to be moving in this same direction. Like Abulafia, this writer, too, adopted a topical, rather than chapter by chapter, arrangement to parse the Guide: I had already told you in Malmad93 that it is not my intention to copy what is self-evident from the book without any inno vation, and this is the reason I shall include many chapters [from the Guide] in one gate, and sometimes I shall include the matter of one chapter in many gates.94 But it was Abulafia who led the way. Subtly, he was staking his claim to interpretative monopoly: only he and his followers understood the Guide correctly. He was posing not only as the Guide's (principal) dis seminator, but also as the sole interpreter with a grasp of Maimonides so profound that he was equipped to write incisive commentaries. The Guide as the basis of an esoteric tradition Yet the Guide, in fact, is an esoteric book; Maimonides presumably never revealed a code enabling readers to elucidate the secrets to which the Guide constantly alludes. Nevertheless, as late as the end of the thirteenth century, Joseph Caspi claimed he had heard there was an oral tradition that contained these secrets, and that he had personally traveled to the East to put his hands on it, but to no avail.95 The source of Caspi's information is unknown. However, in two of his commentaries on the Guide, Abulafia claims that he was privy to these traditions. In</page><page sequence="17">MAIMONIDES' GUIDE OF THE PERPLEXED AND THE KABBALAH 213 the Sefer Hayyei ha-Nefesh, Abulafia wrote that the Guide might con fuse those who misunderstood its author; however, this applied neither to him nor to: "... those who received from the truth of the words of the divine books.96 For he, and they, had saved their souls, and it suffices to both him, and them, that their intention is the same. And for me, the modest student, who received from his book [the Guide] according to my accomplished masters,97 blessed be their memory.98 The term translated as "those who received," ha-mequbbalim, Abulafia used principally to denote Kabbalists. Yet sometimes by "reception" he meant a mode of acquiring knowledge distinguished from independent study or from learning acquired through exercising the intellect.99 This meaning he clarifies in another passage from the Sefer ha-Hesheq, one of the major handbooks dealing with the path to prophecy, in which he classifies oral Kabbalistic traditions as the lowest form of Kabbalah: In order to understand my intention regarding [the meaning of] qolot [voices] I shall hand down to you the known qabbalot, some of them having been received from mouth to mouth from the sages of [our] generation, and others that I have received from the books named Sifrei qabbalah, composed by the ancient sages, the Kabbalists, blessed be their memory, concerning the wondrous topics;100 and other [traditions] be stowed on me by God, blessed be He, which came to me from Th Y [the Hebrew letters tof yod] in the form of the "Daughter of the Voice,"101 these being the higher qabbalot.102'103 This is one of the few instances where Abulafia explicitly mentions his "receipt" of oral traditions without mentioning the Guide; he had already attributed a relatively low status to orally transmitted lore in an earlier work, where he defines the term mevin as denoting a higher status than that of the hakham who studies books: "If he receives it from the Kabbalah, that is to say from one who has himself obtained it from contemplating the Divine Names or from another Kabbalist, than he is called mevin."104 If we accept this reading of mequbbalim, then Abulafia claims that he received a tradition, which may not be Kabbalistic, but which nev ertheless deals with the secrets of the Guide. Since one receives the secrets from another person, this form of cognition is lower than the</page><page sequence="18">214 MOSHE IDEL receipt of secrets from above, by means of a personal experience. And in a later commentary, Abulafia mentions "transmitters," moserim, of these traditions.105 Even more explicitly, he asserted that he committed to writing: "all the secrets found in this book [namely the Guide], just as we have received them from the mouth of the sages of the generation, our masters, may God keep them alive."106 There is no doubt that Abulafia envisaged his special esotericism as different from that of Maimonides. Testifying to this is his first commentary on the Guide: "the path of the Guide, and [another one] according to my own path, that is the path of Kabbalah ... the paths of Kabbalah which are the secrets of Sefer Yetzirah."107 This classifi cation imposes a higher form of esotericism, the Kabbalistic one, on Maimonides' path, and by definition, Maimonides' path of secrets, and their receipt, is inferior to Abulafia's Kabbalah.108 Nevertheless, at least in one case, Abulafia established a deep affinity between the secrets of the Guide and his type of Kabbalistic discussions. In the introduction to Sitrei Torah, his most important commentary on the Guide, Abulafia confesses that, There is a tradition in our hands [qabbalah be-yadeinu] con cerning the number of all the chapters in each and every part of the three parts of the book ... and their secret [numerical value of] "three degrees" [shalosh mava lot], whose secret is like of three meals [shalosh se "udot], whose sign is the names 26, 65, 86, and the entire number of the chapters of the first part is 75,109 and that of the second part 48,no and of the third part 54,m and the combination of their letters is "the knowledge [mad"a] of Hen." And the sum of the three is 177, and their secret is 'three degrees' which are like the secret of "three meals," whose sign is three names 26, 65, 86, and their numerical value is G an "Eden.112 Abulafia's manipulation of the Hebrew notations of the numbers of the chapters in the three parts of the Guide: VH, MH, ND, become Mada" ha-Hen, which may be translated as the "science" or "knowledge" of "grace," the latter term assumedly an acronym for Hokhmat Ha-Nistar, the science of secrets. Already previously to Abulafia, Nahmanides had used the phrase Yod"ei Hen to specify experts in esotericism.113 Abu lafia thus introduced a name for the Guide that a number of Kabbalists would employ regularly to refer to the Kabbalah itself. Abulafia also capitalizes on a form of discussion found in the Commentary on Sefer Yetzirah composed by his own teacher Rabbi Barukh Togarmi, as well</page><page sequence="19">MAIMONIDES' GUIDE OF THE PERPLEXED AND THE KABBALAH 215 as in Gikatilla's Ginnat 'Egoz. In Togarmi's formulation: "The incan tation of the language is the secret of G an "Eden, known from the three meals - 26, 65, and 86 - incumbent upon the individual to eat on Sabbath, [during] day and night."114 This compact passage, like Abulafia's, is based upon a gematria, namely, on the affinities between the numerical values of the different phrases constituting this citation. The basic figure is 177, which is the gematria of G an "Eden, as well as the three divine names, the Tetragrammaton (26), 'Adonai (65), and 'Elohim (86). This is also the case of the phrase "Day and night" - Yomam va-laylah. More over, according to one particular way of calculating the phrase, "three meals," the shalosh se "udot, amounts to 1176, which was understood as 176 + 1 = 177, while the phrase hashba"at ha-lashon is 1178, which was to be understood as: 1178 = 178 ? 1 = 117. In the spirit of Togarmi's thought, and presumably that of Abulafia, too, Gikatilla wrote: "The three names, whose secrets are 26, 86 and 65, are the secret of the stages of the intellectual degrees, and are called by the general name of Garden of Eden. By means of understanding them, one enters the Garden of Eden while alive."115 Though concerned with the intellectual accomplishments that are the three degrees Abulafia to which refers on various occasions, Gikatil la, like Togarmi, does not mention the Guide or the number of its chapters. All the authors mention the Kabbalistic calculation of the three divine names, the meals, and Gan "Eden, but the notion that the Guide and its chapters have something to do with the gematriot of 177 appears nowhere. Thus, insofar as Gan "Eden = 177 = shalosh se "udot is concerned, Abulafia's claim that he received a tradition is confirmed. This, however, has nothing to do with the Guide, meaning that if Ab ulafia did "receive" a tradition, it reached him from outside Togarmi's circle, or at least part of it did. Abulafia, less interested in magic than Togarmi and Gikatilla, ignored the former gematria of the "incantation of language." But what is the significance of describing the chapters of the Guide as pointing to Gan "Eden and as the knowledge of the secrets, Mada" ha-Henl According to Gikatilla's interpretation of the three names, they are a clue for entering Paradise while alive. Abulafia often de scribed the prophetic experience, the ultimate goal of his Kabbalistic system, as reaching an eschatological state:116 I am [he wrote] the angel of the God of Hosts, so and so, and it is the secret of Gan "Eden that accounts for three names, YHWH, 'Adonai 'Elohim, whose vowels are the prince</page><page sequence="20">216 MOSHE IDEL of Gan "Eden. And he will tell him: "I am the tree of life, the Garden in Eden from the East." And he will understand that God has sent to him His angel in order to help him by instruction, and to accustom him in the strong love of the Creator by announcing to him the truth of the essence of the tree of life that is within the Garden, and he is the "prince of Gan "Eden."117 Like the three divine names amounting to the number 177, the 177 chapters of Maimonides' Guide, too, constitute a way to enter Paradise, which means a way to acquire mystical revelation. When interpreted Kabbalistically, therefore, the Guide becomes a medium of mystical technique. Yet does the equation of the numbers of the chapters of the Guide to the gematria of Gan "Eden and to the three divine names imply that for Abulafia, the Guide is essentially a treatise dealing with God? If so, following Nahmanides, Abulafia may have taken the idea that it is possible to read the entire Bible as a continuum of divine names118 and applied it to the Guide. However, although Abulafia often employs this technique in his commentary on the Pentateuch,119 I have never seen it in his commentaries on the Guide. But the above passage does, in fact, relate to the Guide. The "angel of the Gan "Eden" an expression already found in ancient Jewish mystical literature, stands, I believe, for the Active Intellect, which plays a key role in Maimonides' and Ab ulafia's theories of prophecy. The angels, like other images such as the "tree of life" in the passage above, constitute the visual representation created by the imaginative capacity (of the mind) on the basis of the intellectual content derived from the Active Intellect. In other words, if the above interpretation of the passage is correct, we may assume that through cognizing the three divine names, the mystic is able to attain the summum bonum of the Guide, a revelation stemming from the Active Intellect. Secondary elites One of the conclusions suggested by the above discussion (it may eas ily be widened) is that interaction between the "two elites" was not hindered by the polarity of philosophy and kabbalah, nor by the an tagonism one might imagine this polarity would create. It must be noted that a philosopher might become a Kabbalist, but not vice versa. Besides, differences in modes of intellectual conceptualization, which</page><page sequence="21">MAIMONIDES' GUIDE OF THE PERPLEXED AND THE KABBALAH 217 might be extreme and must not be ignored, were surely amplified by the sociology of knowledge in the Middle Ages. From the few cases from which it is possible to learn how Abulafia conceived of his audience, it becomes clear that he labeled as excellent students who accepted his views. Those who rejected them, he called inadequate; this stands out in the case of R. Jehudah Salmon (a success) and R. Moses of Burgos (who, we recall, resisted). In addition, for instance, at Palermo, Abulafia hastened to note the high social status of some of his students, even those to whom apparently he did not teach the Guide.120 He was clearly seeking legitimacy. Of more immediate interest, however, are the cases where Abulafia, by his own admission, failed. In the passage from 'Otzar "Eden Ganuz, he dismisses the four students he had in Capua in early 1280 as young men bent on pursuing error. Their youth is not the issue. Already in his commentary on the Guide dedicated to those four students, written six years earlier, he wrote that I am today in the city of Phonon,121 and four precious stones joined my academy ... God bestowed upon these four chil dren knowledge and intelligence in order to understand every book and science, and this is the reason I brought them as close as I could and I invented for them the names Daniel, and Hananyah, Mishael and vAzaryah, and I called the lat ter Zekhariah.122 They are children with no deficiency, good looking and understanding every science and knowing knowl edge and with the capacity to stand in the palace of the king ... and those four children ... when they came to shelter under the wings of the Shekhinah, false witnesses ... attempted to seduce them from the table of the Lord, the God of Israel, to keep them from being nourished from the splendor of the Shekhinah,123 at the time when other men consume grass124 ... and they came and implored and asked me to interpret the secrets of the Guide of the Perplexed, together with some secrets of the Torah which are in my hands, dealing with very profound matters,125 so that they should have validation, merit, voice, and one to recommend them in order to extract some wisdom for which their souls were greatly striving, to know it and comprehend its essence in order to know their Creator. And they implored me very much to this effect ... and I, because of my love for them, did not desire to turn them down. I fulfilled their desire according to their wish,</page><page sequence="22">218 MOSHE IDEL and I composed this commentary for them and for those like them.126 Thus, Abulafia started rather early in his career to teach youths, whom he calls yeladim. He taught them by following the text of the Guide line by line, as well as through the more advanced method that is best exemplified in the book, the Sitrei Torah, which he wrote at these youths' request. Years earlier, about 1273, he had taught Gikatilla this advanced method - Gikatilla himself then a youth of 25 - which we saw Abulafia also taught, at about the same time, to the Spanish R. Shem Tov and R. Jehudah Salmon. Some of his Sicilian students, too, might have been young; he mentions that their fathers had been his students. A good part of Abulafia's students were, then, young, perhaps early adults searching out religiosity going beyond standard (rabbinic) defi nitions. Some of them, beside Jehudah Salmon of Barcelona, who, nev ertheless, wrote nothing that may be classed as Kabbalistic, may have belonged to the "first elite." Gikatilla, who did write much, belonged, I would argue, to the "secondary elite." However consciously, Abulafia was transmitting advanced proce dures of studying the Guide conforming to his version of the Kabbalah. No wonder that his teaching - which aspired to transform his young students into mystics nourished from the divine splendor - elicited strong negative reactions, which is typical of reactions to new forms of religious knowledge and experience. In Abulafia's case, the resistance was repeated, and it was no doubt provoked, as in Capua, by the very appearance of the Guide on the Mediterranean's northern shore. Question after question must have arisen, and, in particular, when the Guide's exposition was couched in Abulafia's extreme mystical terms. Though he claimed that his students remained faithful to his message and that this prompted him to compose his commentary, what he writes in the later 'Otzar "Eden Ganuz indicates the opposite. The desertion, if only temporary, of his students from Messina suggests that he had problems holding onto the allegiance of students drawn from even the "secondary elite." Disclosure and repercussions Yet, I believe that the estrangement of his students so shortly after they began studying with him has little to do with the Guide per se or with Abulafia's special mode of instruction. The real sticking point was his conviction that the end was near - albeit he expressed</page><page sequence="23">MAIMONIDES' GUIDE OF THE PERPLEXED AND THE KABBALAH 219 this idea in non-conventional terms - and that this justified disclosing secrets,127 including individual eschatological strategies, but mostly hints to Abulafia's personal messianic role.128 Whatever brought Abulafia to commit the secrets he believed to be the esoteric dimension of the Guide to writing, their disclosure, however complete, raised hackles outside Kabbalistic circles. As Steven Harvey has suggested to me orally, the earlier philosophical authors who dealt with the Guide were careful not to violate Maimonides' severe warning not to reveal his secrets. This was certainly true of the philosophical commentaries contemporary with Abulafia that were mentioned above.129 Once the Kabbalists began disregarding this cau tion, subsequent philosophical commentaries did not cavil to divulge the Guide's secrets. That this was likely the case with Joseph Caspi and Moshe Narboni, whom, we may assume, were acquainted with Abulafia's writings,130 which would strengthen Harvey's point. If future research reinforces this observation, it will be possible to conclude that Kabbalistic interpretations of the Guide (regardless of their extent) did more than ease the way for the book's reception in Kabbalistic circles. They also influenced the development of Jewish thought as a whole, and even beyond. Wirszubski has demonstrated how the Latin translation of two of Abulafia's commentaries on the Guide affected the early Christian Kabbalah - to the extent that Christian Kabbalists confer upon Maimonides the title of Abulafia's teacher to whom Mai monides revealed secrets directly.131 The image of Maimonides mysticus in Christian circles represents the enduring seductiveness of Abulafia's (literary) Kabbalistic charms. The point should be clear, as, in fact, I have already broached it in other studies of Maimonides' impact on Kabbalah. To better under stand the histories of both medieval Jewish philosophy and mysticism requires adopting a more integrative approach. I am confident that its findings will erase lingering doubts that medieval Jewish mysticism was a not variegated undertaking, and that in this undertaking the Great Eagle played different roles, for different schools, and at different times.
