<plain_text><page sequence="1">Les Origines de la Civilisation Polo- naise. Prehistoire-Protohistoire, by JOZEF Kostrzewski. 261 illustrations. 671 pages. Presses universitaires de France, Paris 1949. The monumental work, written by one of the most eminent Polish prehis- torians, is a great achievement in post war conditions. The book was written during the German occupation in Po- land at which time the author was liv- ing incognito in a village. Later, the book was translated into French by M. Bernard Hamel and published in France in 1949. The book is significant for its wide scope including not only Polish pre- history but prehistoric research in gen- eral. The author covers the region be- tween the rivers Oder and Vistula (the Oder valley was the heart of the Polish state founded by Mesco I in the 10th century) and the time between the fifth and the eleventh century a.D., several centuries before and after the Polish state was founded. The main purpose of the book is to give a clear picture of the culture which existed during the time in which the Polish state appeared in European history. The author speaks about the material and spiritual cul- ture, using not only the archeological finds, but the linguistic and ethnologi- cal records. Reviewing this book, we give credit to A. Bruckner and C. Moszynski, whose important lin- guistic and ethnological studies Profes- sor Kostrzewski used in his research. The author is to be congratulated on his use of so many sources in compiling this book. In Poland, as in the other regions of eastern Europe, the primitive life of a farmer and the language have preserved valuable material for the re- construction of ancient times. The author is of the opinion that the territory of Poland was inhabited by the Slavs for more than 3,000 years. The "Lusatian" culture of the Bronze Age at the end of the second millen- nium b.c. is held by Polish prehis- torians to be an original Slavic culture. The Polish state was created in the tenth century from a tribe, called "Polanes." The name "Polanes" is de- rived from the word pole "field," which proves their agricultural character. Some earlier theories that the Polish state was created by the Goths or the Vikings in the tenth century is denied and held to be fantastic. There is no doubt about the local origin of the Pol- ish state. The pure Slavic names and the distribution of the typical Slavic sites and fortified hills are the best proof for the local origin. The neighbor nations of the early Polish state were the Czechs, Slovaks and Moravians to the south, Germans to the west, Prussians (Baltic Jat- vinges) to the north and Russians to the east. The cultural relations be- tween the neighboring lands are easily traced by the borrowed words in their language. During the eighth to eleventh centuries inclusive, the Poles accepted some German vocabulary. With the in- troduction of Christianity at the end of the ninth century the ecclesiastical vo- cabulary was adopted from the south- ern neighbors. Some of these new words were later transmitted to the northern neighbors. Trade relations with the Arabs were known to exist in the tenth century. Jewish merchants also ap- peared in Poland at the end of the tenth century. The basis of the reconstruction of the material culture was the excavations of the sites and fortified hills, known by the name "grody," of the seventh to tenth century, in Great Poland, Pom- erania, Silesia and Dobrzyn. By means of the systematic investigation of sites and additional material from philologi- cal and ethnological studies, the author has been able to describe, even in some detail, economic life, crafts, etc. In the chapter on agriculture, for example, he reconstructs the history of corn, veget- ables and fruits, stating their age or in- dicating the ways, through which they came from foreign countries. He also describes with precision all kinds of food and food production, implements, male and female clothing and hygienic conditions. Special attention was paid to 17 different crafts, including not only pottery, wood-, bone- and metal work, weaving and sewing, but even shoe-making, saddlery, goldsmithing and many others. Describing the spiritual and social culture in the second and the third Spring 1951 61</page><page sequence="2">parts of the book, the author uses mostly the linguistic, folklore and his- toric records. In spite of his confession that the reconstruction of spiritual cul- ture is not as easy as the reconstruction of economic life, the attempt to give a complete picture of spiritual and social culture is a high contribution. The author depicts the formation of names, the character of ancient religion, cos- mography and art. The chapter about the religion is divided into three parts: cult of the dead, the cult of nature and magic, without discussing the elements that connect them. The art objects are described in a similar way - by mate- rial: wood, bone, metal, etc. The evidence dealing with religion allows us to imagine ancient Polish paganism as a religion of nature, where anthropomorphism did not play an im- portant part. The author looks into two kinds of religious objects with recipro- cal meaning: the objects, in which di- vinity is felt (sun, moon, fire, plants, birds, serpents) and also evil powers are felt such as the evil power of the dead and of winter. The struggle be- tween these two powers should be called the "base of religion," but not "animism" as is affirmed in the book. The ancient Poles lived in big patri- archal families and clans. The early rec- ords from the year 380 A.D. mention the Slavic name of the duke Boz. In the sixth and seventh century dukes are known in the neighboring southeastern Slavic countries. It is supposed, that the dynasty of Piasts, known at the dawn of the Polish state, had its origin before the ninth century. The ascent of nobility is proven in the beginning of historical times. Already in the twelfth century the farmers had become serfs, except for a few free ones. The administration of the land was organized in the system of grody - fortified sites, which were the "capi- tals" of certain districts. Besides the villages, certain land units, called op ole, were depending on the authority of the grody. The book "Les Origines de la Civili- sation Polonaise" successfully raises the heavy curtain hanging between his- toric and prehistoric times. It paints a clear picture and indicates that there existed no sharp break between the times reconstructed by written docu- ments and by archaeological, ethnologi- cal, and linguistic means. M.
