THE study of the problem of Recognition which I now offer to the Aristotelian Society on this second occasion on which I am honoured with the duty of delivering a Presidential Address, I was led to undertake by the Symposium on " The Implications of Recog,nition" in our last Session.* Philo- sophical problems have a way of beginning with something apparently simple and easy and leading one on until one is lost in the general problem of metaphysical reality. That at least is a common experience with me, and I find this no exception to the rule. It has led me further than I expected when I contributed to the Symposium, and further than I expected when I went on thinking about it. In this address I wish to deal with two questions. In the first place I wish to inquire into the nature of the modification of a cognition which constitutes it a recognitioni. This is the problem of recognition, so far as its source is within the individual's experience. In the second place J wish to inquire * " The Implications of Recognition," a Symposium, by Miss Beatrice Edgell, Mr. F. E. Bartlett, Mr. G. E. Moore and Mr. H. W. Carr (Proc. Arist. Soc., 1915-16, p. 179). A</page><page sequence="2">9 H. WILDON CARR. how there can be recognition, as there appears to be, wlhere there can be no conscious memory of the prior cognition. This is the problem of recognition so far as its source is beyond the individual's experience and in his ancestral experience. More briefly I may describe my problem as that of the nature of intelligent recognition and of instinctive recognition and of their relation. As the subject is a very large one and the temptations to turn off the track of the inquiry will be manifold, it may be well to state clearly certain very closely connected problems which I wish to avoid discussing. I do not propose to discuss the nature of instinct and intelligence and their relation to one another. I wish only to discuss the nature of recognition, intelligent or instinctive. I do not propose to discuss any of the well-known theories as to the nature of the relation of mind and body, though the dependence of recognition on physiological process on the one hand and on conscious process on the other will lead me to deal with the problem of mind and body. I wish only to discuss in this connection in what sense -nstinctive recognition is a mental fact. In recognition there is, as distinctive of the experience, an element we may describe as " againness." It is the experience " had before," " seen already." Under the first question I wish to discuss the nature and genesis of the experience of " againness." Under the second question, I wish to inquire how there can be, as there certainly appears to be, recogni- tion in the first performance by an animal of an instinctive action. These two questions may appear to be quite distinct and to have nothing whatever in common, and some may object that while the first is a question which can only be resolved by subjective or introspective analysis and is therefore in the full sense a question of philosophy, the seconid is merely a question of descriptive natural history, and any theory founded on the description can only be of quite secondary philosophical</page><page sequence="3">THE PROBLEM OF RECOGNITION. 3 importance. It must rest, they will say, almost entirely on analogy and if treated philosophically cannot avoid the taint of anthropomorphism. I shall try to show that this is not so. The two questions are in my view very closely associated and are indeed part of one and the same metaphysical problem. At the same time I propose to keep them distinct. 1. What is the Nature of the Modi.fication of Cognition which nmakes it Recognition ? There may be no cognition which is cognition only and not recognition. Every cognition may be a recognition, and a pure cognition may be a limitinig concept. In a developed conscious- ness such as our own, were there only cognition and no recogni- tion, there would be no acquirement of meaning and therefore no experience in the ordinary sense of the word. The recogni- tions in present experience may be the cognitions on which future recognitions depend, and so likewise the cognitions on which present recognitions depend may themselves have been recognitions. Pure cognition, however, is theoretically conceiv- able, and as an abstract possibility it forms part of the concept of experience as a concrete reality. Logically and etymologically cognition is presupposed in recognition. Cognition is the ground or condition of recognition. If the second apprehension of an identical object or of an identical event were a repetition of the first apprehension and only numerically different from it, recognition would simply be the addition of memory and judgment to the mental act of apprehension. But plainly this is not the fact, for there are cases of recognition in which there is no repetition of any experience at all, and in most cases of recognition, if not in all, even though there may seem to be a similarity between a present experience and a past experience on which a judgment of identity could be based, there is no similarity in fact. If this be disputed it is at least certain that there may be A 2</page><page sequence="4">4 H. WILDON CARR.. recognition where there is no similarity even between the present recognised object and any previous experience of that ob*ject whatever. The term recognition, as distinct from the term cognition, connotes that the meaning, or content: or implication of a sense presentation is in some way already known: it is the direct immediate apprehension of familiarity with the object presented to us. The nature of this apprehension of a mark of our own past experience in an object present to sense or to thought is the problem of recognition. That the problem is a difficult one will be evident to anyone who will refer to the article on "Recognition " in Baldwin's Dictionary. Three main groups of theories are there specified and these are again subdivided into twelve sub-groups, and a list of psychological writers, by no means exhaustive, is added, each of whom seems to have pro- pounded a distinct theory or to have adopted some characteristic doctrine of recognition. The task I am going to set myself is not that of comparing and criticising these different theories: I wish to inquire how far we can directly observe' the process of recognition at work- the process by which cognition acquires the modification which makes it recognition. It will lead me to a metaphysical theory. I do not see how this can be avoided, and therefore it is well to give warning. The problem of recognition cannot be decided by observation of empirical fact, for that depends on the pre- suppositions which psychology, like every special science, adopts. This was made clear, I think, if nothing else was, in the symposium to which I have referred. The real difference which divided us was metaphysical-so at least it appeared to me-a different theory of the nature of the continuity of experience. Let me begin by taking some definite instances of what everyone would accept as cases of recognition. This appears an easy matter because recognition is a perfectly familiar experience. It is in fact, however, peculiarly difficult, and the difficulty is</page><page sequence="5">THE PROBLEM OF RECOGNITION. 5 of a quite paradoxical nature, due to a veritable embarras de richesse. I can find nothino else in my cognitive experience but recognitions, and I cannot therefore establish by a clear example what is a recognition in distinction from what is only a cognition. Nevertheless for practical purposes we make a clear and well-marked distinction between what we term recognitions and the cognitions on which they depend. It is only when we analyse these cognitions that we find that they in their turn are also recog,nitions. When we push our analysis to the point of imagining the simplest conditions of cognition and the absolutely unanalysable character of a first cognition we are driven to hypostasise some theoretical being like Condillac's statue and endow it with sense organs one at a time, and follow out the gradual complications of sense experience from its hypothetically simple origin. It is logic or epistemology which spurs us to the attempt, not psychology. (1) The young chick, we are told by Professor Lloyd Morgan, at first pecks instinctively at all small objects. But experience very rapidly teaches it that it is pleasant to peck at some things, such as yolk of egg, or cabbage-moth caterpillars, and very unpleasant to peck at others, such as cinnabar caterpillars or bits of orange peel. The young chick profits by experience and thereby comes to recognise objects. The latter experience we should call recognition of objects in distinction from the earlier experience, and this earlier experience we should call cognition in contrast to the later experience. (2) I arrive at a town I have not visited before and take a first stroll through its streets. All that I notice is new to me anid I set to work to find my way about. After a time or on a second stroll I am familiar with my surroundings, and I recognise what I see. The later cognitions I call recognitions, as distinguished from the earlier ones on which they depend, and which I then think of as coanitions merely. (3) Two friends are walking in the country for the enjoylmlent</page><page sequence="6">6 IT. WILDON CARR. of the exercise. Each is experiencing the same exhilara- tion from the crisp air, the bright sunshine and the beauty of the surroundings. One is an engineer, the other a naturalist. Their recognitions are entirely distinct. The one recognises gradients, strains, actual or possible constructions, and the details of locomotive devices, which to his companion are merely roads, banks, valleys, hills, engines, etc. The other recognises the character of the vegetation, the nature of the soil and subsoil, the various species of animals, which to his companion are merely green grass, hedgerows, woods, and singing birds, etc. Here then we have a practical difference between recognition and general awareness. It is only part of experience which we distinguish as recognition, and one man's recognitions are different from another's, even when the sense stimuli of each are, so far as they are external influences, identical. (4) A favourite book of mine is Fielding's Tom Jones, but the enjoyment it never fails to give me is due to something literary and perhaps to something sympathetic in the author, not to an interest in the plot. Yet I distinctly remember the delightful surprise I experienced on the first reading as the plot unfolded itself. This enjoyment cani never recur, and in this respect recognition, in giving me "againness," leaves me poorer. It illustrates, however, and this is why I cite it, how recognition may depend upon an experience, the repetition of which the recognition itself renders impossible. With these illustrations of the use of the term recognition, let me try to define it. Recognition is the whole content, meaning, or significance of a sense presentation in so far as we have learnt that content, meaning, or significance by experience. What is recognised, or what we call objectively the recognition, is what we have learnt by experience, and learning by ex- perience is a subjective process, by which I mean an activity of the mind. I think we always mean this by recognition. We perceive in what is present to sense what we have learnt to</page><page sequence="7">THE PROBLEM OF RECOGNITION. 7 know is this, that, or the other, and the perception gives to the sense presentation the mark of "{already seen," "had before," " againness." Against this definition it may be objected that we also use the term recognition in describing purely instinctive behaviour, behaviour which we characterise as action which is perfect at its very first performance and therefore excludes the notion of learning by experience. We say for example that animals recognise their prey, or recognise their kin, or recognise a menace to their life or to that of their offspring, and we apply the term even to creatures who, like most of the insects, begin their individual life without having known their parents and whose knowledge cannot possibly have been acquired by individual experience at all. Undoubtedly the use of the term recognition in cases of pure instinct is derived from its use in cases of rational knowledge, and many no doubt will deny that there is any identity of fact underlying the use of the term in the case of instinct. I think it is a right term to use, although its primary meaning only is that the creature acts as one acts who has learnt by experience and therefore already knows. The difference between instinctive recognition and intelligent recognition is that the mark of the past in instinctive ex- perience cannot be explainied by individual but only by racial experience; it is innate or congenital. Recognition always implies that there has been past experience and that the individual has learnt by it, though the past experience is not in cases of instinct the individual's individual experience. A more fundamental objection, however, will be raised. To explain recognition as learning by experience is to explain what is difficult to understand by something more difficult to under- stand. Even if it be granted that recognition always depends on our having learnt by experience, this will bring no solution of the problen. It simply overwhelms the difficulty of accounting for a modification of a present datum of experience by a mark of past experience with the far greater difficulty of sonceiving a process by which the past can modify the present.</page><page sequence="8">8 11. WILDON CARR. I admit this difficulty and the main purpose of the present study is to make it explicit. Recognition implies that we learn by experience and learning by experience implies mental process modifyina the data of knowledge. It implies also that there are no unmodified data as ultimate constituents of the reality we know, for if there were they would be unrecognis- able. Many philosophers will also, I know, reject my order of implication ab initio. Learning by experience, they will say, implies recognition, and wholly depends upon it, whereas recognition does not imply learning by experience, for it is theoretically possible in minds whose knowledge is purely con- templative. Indeed, such must necessarily be the order of implication for those who hold that knowledge is essentially contemplation. Recognition will be for them a perception or a judgment of a relation between two terms-one a present sense- datum, the other a memory. Take, for example, Dr. Moore's answer to the question: " What kind of event are we asserting to be happening when we say, with regard to a present sense- datum, ' I know that I have sensed something like this before?"' in our Symposium last session. " This kind of recognition," he says, "consists in our knowing, with regard to the present sense-datum, and with regrard to the relation 'like- ness,' just this,-that there was a sense-datum, of which it is true, both that it was sensed by me before, and that it had the relation of likeness to this sense-datuin."* I consider this account of recogniition and the order of implication which wouild follow from it, quite wrong, and I will trv to show why. Let me first, however, freely admit that Dr. Moore is concerned only with intelligent, and not at all with instinctive, recognition. The process he describes repre- sents, quite truly, as it seems to me, a very common experi- ence. A vague recognition may cause us to make an effort to * Proc. Arist. Soc., 1915-16, p. 213.</page><page sequence="9">TIlE PROBLEM OF RECOGNITION. 9 give it sharper definition, and then we reflect and deliberately compare present with past experience. Also, as all mental process is in my view a process of recognising, and as conscious deliberation is a mental process, conscious deliberation is a process of recognising. What I deny is that recognition is this. Recognition is immediate experience. The process which has made it recognition is already past, and not to come. The sense-datum, if we use that term to denote the actual object present to the mind, has not to wait for the judgment or perception of a relation, in order that it may become, what as yet it is lnot, recognition. Take, then, any one of my four cases and attemipt to reduce it to the perception or judgmnent of like- ness between a present sense-datulu and remembered sense- data, and yotu will soon discover the failure is absolute. Not only is there no identity (this is obvious-we imight, perhaps, posit an identity of unperceived substances, if that would help us at all, but there can be no identity of sense-data), there is not even similarity. Take the chick which first pecks the cinnabar caterpillar, then afterwards rejects it, wlhile it con- tinues to peck the cabbage caterpillar. The sense-data are entirely different the second time, for the chick has learnt to distinguish the objects, which as physical objects are unaltered; i.e., the resemblance between the caterpillars, so far as the resemblance is objective, has not disappeared oni the second occasion. The important thing is, that whatever the chick knows about the caterpillar when, meeting it a second time, it rejects it, is something it has learnt the first time. If it has learnt nothing the first timne it will learn nothing by repetition. Only if it has learnt soinething the first time will it modify its action the second time. I have chosen this particular illustra- tion for its simplicity, as an instance of intelligent, not of instinctive, recognition. No one supposes that logical processes take place in the mind of the lnewly-hatched chick. It is possible they do, but it is a possibility most people would ignore. Now, we may suppose that recognition is the</page><page sequence="10">10 H. WILDON CARR. condition of learning by experience, or we may suppose that it is the conditionate. If it be the condition, we must suppose that there is a mental process, involving a memory- image, an act of comparison, and a, judgment or perception of a relation, as well as the present perceptual matter. It seems to me highly improbable; but even if I suppose there is, learning by experience does not necessarily follow; whereas, if I suppose the animal learns by experience, recognition is a necessary consequence. Take the other illustrations. Unless I am learning by experience in my first stroll in the strange town, my second stroll will be equally strange, there will be no recognition. The sense-data will yield nothing on which a judgment of identity can be based, for they are not the same nor similar. So with the third and fourth illustrations, the recognition is not the observation of a relation of likeness between sense-data. I shall search for ever and in vain for any likeness. Recognition is due to a progressive work of the mind exercised at and from the beginning of experience, and con- tinually throughout experience. It is not an external act of comparison of the experience of one moment with that of another and earlier moment, possible only at the later moment, and dependent simply on the power of the mind to retain and revive a memory-image of the earlier moment. I recognise in the later moment only what I have learnt in the first moment, but to be able to recognise I must have been learning by experience. Learning by experience is not something which happens only on the repetition of a particuilar experience. It is a primary process taking place on the first occasion. I may mention, on this point, Mr. Stout's admirable argument in the chapter on " Instinict " in the Mantual. It is because this process has been working in the initial instance that the repetition of the exactly similar conditions (exactly similar as judged by an indifferent observer) presents the peculiar modification of cogni- tion we call recognition. Professor Lloyd Morgan, from whom my first illustration is taken, considers the chick's action in</page><page sequence="11">THE PROBLEM OF RECOGNITION. 11 rejecting the cinnabar moth caterpillars an instance of " profit- ing by experience," not of " learning by experience." I fail to see, however, that this distinction affects the conclusion that, whatever activity of the mind be supposed, it is an activity at work in the first instance and not called forth by the repetition. Learning by experience presupposes a distinction between the mind and its objects. The expression itself implies that there is something obstinately objective in the reality opposed to thought, stubborn fact which the mind may turn to practical advantage by understanding it and adapting conduct to it. It also supposes that what is past can still, though past, modify present action. This seems to be effected by the blending of memory with sensation in perception. Learning by experience, further, positively excludes the notion of pure repetition. Every fresh instance comes before the mind modified by previous experience. The problenm as it affects the theory of knowledge may be presented then as an inquiry into the a priori conditions of recog- nition. What are the conditions of an experience in which there is no repetitioni, but a continual miodification of the present by the past? What is the meaning in such an experience of "tgainness"? What mental factors are necessarily supposed and how do they bring about the result ? And what do they imply as to the ultimate nature of mind and reality? The factors seem to nre to be these :-(1) Retention. (2) Revival. (3) Discrimination. (4) Selection. (5) Habit-memory. (6) Pure Memory or Recollection. I will briefly indicate what I mean by each:- (1) Retention is presence together in consciousness of what is before with what is after in experience. It is the holding together in a present duration-span of an experience itself su ccessive. This duration-span of consciousness I endeavoured to analyse in my Address to the Society last Session on " The Moment of Experience." The retention implied in that</page><page sequence="12">12 H. WILDON CARR. phrase is the essential character of the mind which makes connected experience or consciousness of duration possible. Without it experience is inconceivable. Were there no reten- tion in this primary meaning, sense impressions, did they exist, would be fleeting and perishing as the stimuli which occasion themii. Retentioii appears to me the nmost direct and the most obvious instance of the reality we namie mind and the clearest manifestation- of its essential character. (2) Revival is the recall of an experience after it has ceased to be retained in present conisciousness. It also is named retention, because it implies that experience which has passed out of consciousness is still retained. It is different, however, from what I have called retention, for the revived experience comes to consciouisness without the peculiar character of being present to sense and with the ghostly character of a memory- imnage. It is revival which makes the past appear to us as a cointinuous objective reality, on to any part of which we can turn our attention, in the same way in which we turn our attention on to any part of the objective reality we call spatial. (3) By discriiiinatioin I mean that experience can be dis- sociated or disintegrated on any principle and the elements so dissociated canl be associated and redintegiated in any order and on any principle. I include under discrimination both dis- integration aind redintegration, for they seem to me to form one mental activity. This a.nd the following seem to me the most active factors in the process of learning by experience on which recognition depends. Each of our individual minds seems distinguished from every other mind, not by its objective experience, but by its own special centre of interest and the standpoint from which it orders and arranges its experience. (4) By selection I mean the suppression or the exclusion from consciousness, or the neglect by consciousness, of some aspects of experience, or of some influenices, which if admitted</page><page sequence="13">THE PROBLEM OF RECOGNITION. 18 not neglected, would tend to mak-e experience an undifferentiated whole instead of a discrete reality. The discreteness of the objective world for our knowledge is due to the mental worlk of selection. The selection is exercised automatically in the first instance by the sense organs, and by many of the neural mechanisms of the brain, but also directly by the mind itself. (5) Habit-memory fixes past experience in the form of habits. It is the preservation of the past in motor dispositions to repeat experience as distinguished from memory imnages which contemplate it. (6) Pure Memory or Recollection preserves the past as a pure record. It enables us to date our experience. It is more than schematisation in a time order and space order. It enables us to apprehend an absolute or integral time order, every part of which is in an indissoluble relation of time and circumstance with every other part. These seem to me the essential factors of recognition. They are not theoretical. I have tried to state only what seem to me the facts in our experience which everyone would agree to call mental facts, but they enable me to form concepts of mind and of the modes of its activity. These are theoretical. I do not conceive the factors I have distinguished as separate activities assembled in the mind or in the org,anismn nor as separate characters or attributes of the nmind somuetimes present in, sometimes absent from, its activity. Nor do I conceive mind as merely a general term to denote these specific activities. I think they imply a real substance anid a real life. All the activities I have distinguished, but especially the last, pure niemory or recollection, imply that the past is recorded, that a register of it exists. Recollection is inconceivable as a fact and must be pure illusion unless there exists a register of the past. The register seems to be integral and independent of actual recollection. The ground for this is mainly based on would modifyexperience, or of some data which, if attended to and</page><page sequence="14">14 H. WILDON CARR. the evidence derived from abnormal experience. I do not propose to enter on this subject. There can be no doubt, I think, that there exists a register; the only doubt is whether this register is the mind or the brain. In my view this register or record is the substance of mind, if I may be allowed that useful though much abused term. I use the term because I want to distinguish between mental stuff and mental life. Memory is the stuff, but mind is not mere receptivity, a growing record of external material. It is an active process. The life of the mind is a continuous organisation of experi- ence. The mind is not passive, waiting on experience and passing judgment on it reflectively as it flows past. The mind advances to meet experience, its attitude is not contemplative but expectant. It is forward-looking, ready prepared, ready organised to receive the external influences, reaction to which is the primal necessity of life. This attitude has been named attention to life. It characterises mind wherever in the animal world we meet it. It determines in advanice the form the coming experience will assume. Nothing is less like the mind than the old-time imiage of the wax tablet on which the objects of the external world make imprints. The mind, as I conceive it, is an active power of organising experience, which lives by assimilatino the experience it organises. A good illustration of this work of the mind is afforded us by the physiology of the organism. The digrestive orgalns, the stomach and intestines in particular, were, before the days of scientific physiology, regarded as more or less mechanical receptacles for food, supplied with the necessary acids and ferments for reducina it, and fitted with a kind of filter apparatus for letting the nutriment pass into the blood stream. And all these contrivances had nothing else to do but passively wait for supplies which, when they came, were mechanically and automatically reduced and utilised. Modern physiology gives us an entirely different notion of the vital activities at</page><page sequence="15">THE PROBLEM OF RECOGNITION. 15 work in the digestive process. A vast system of co-ordinated activities, each with its distinct function, is ready prepared to receive and deal with the food. The supply of the food is not in its control, neither the quantity nor the quality. But, though dependent on the external supply, the result of the process is not determined by the external supply. It is regulated and delicately adjusted by the pre-adaptation of the digestive pro- cesses themselves, which exercise selection and discrimination. The result is the maintenance of the living body in a state of efficiency and equilibrium as one organic unity. The mind appears to me to be a spiritual organism, which maintains itself in the same way. Experience is, as it were, fed to it, but the mind is not a passive receptor. It does not contemplate the reality which flows past it. It incorporates it. It meets experience with a ready-prepared organisation to deal with it. Its various activities are those I have named-reten- tion, memory, selection, and the rest. The result is the maintenance of an individual soul, the unity of a personal character. Let me now return to the direct problem of recognition. The problem is to account for the experience of "againness," to account for the feeling of " seen before," " this again," "had already," directly attached to the object of cognition. This feeling requires explaining, because, in fact, there is no repetition, and can be no repetition, for experience is a continuous change. What happens, then, when a totally new sense-presentation arises ? How can it bring with it an " againness " for the mind to experience ? It sounds a paradox. My theory of the mind gives me the explaniation. Recognition is the form which prior cognition gives to new experience. The miind receives the new presentation into a ready prepared organiisation of past knowledge and incorporates it. Recognition is the expectancy with which the mind grasps the novel, the unknown, the unforeseen. By this I mean not only that recognition has</page><page sequence="16">16 H. WILDON CARR. prospective value-the whole attitude of life is forward- looking and all value seems to be prospective. I mean more than this. The past, as from being present it becomes past, gives form and substance to the present activity and is carried along in it. It is this incorporation of past experience in present activity, and not repetition, and also not resemblance of present experience to past experience, which constitutes recognition. And this explains why and in what way all cognition is of necessity recognition. The life of the mind, the menital process, consists in, and is sustained by, the continual reception of the yet unknown into the frame or organisation of the already known. We modify reality by impressing on it a mark of the past in the present act by which we grasp it, and, with every new addition, there goes a correspondent modification of the frame or organisation which is the mind. Thus it is that all new experience comes to us bearing, as it were, already on it the mark of the past. The mind stamps reality with this mlark in the very act of apprehension, not because the mind receives the manifold of sense into stereotyped frames or categories, as Kant supposed, for the frames also are being subtly and continuously modified by the mutual adaptation of the mind to reality and of reality to the miild. There is no absolute repetition of anything, either of mental act or of physical object, there is continual new invention. This, then, in my view is the modification of experience which inakes all cognition recognition. This process, with the various activities I have distinguished in it (not presented as exhausting it but as characterising it), is the a priori condition of the possibility of recognition. It is not a condition of recognition that a memory-image, general or distinct, should be present to the mind, challenging comparison with, or provoking a judgment on, the present sense-datum.</page><page sequence="17">THE PROBLEM OF RECOGNITION. 17 2. Can there be Recognition without C.onscious Memory of Prior Cognition ? Let me now turn to the second part of my problem. So far we have been considering rational or intelligent recognition only, and not instinctive recognition; or, rather, we have been consideringr only the recognition which appears to be explicable by the experience of the individual. If my theory be true, recognition is an effect of the continuity of mental process. Nothing in the pheniomenla of ordinary recognition suggests that the explaniation is in bodily structure rather than in mental activity. We have, in fact, no need to raise the question of the relation of mind and body, because, whatever be the nature of this relation, recocnition is concerned only with mental facts. But when we comne to study instinctive recognition, there seems to be no mental continuity such as we conceive to constitute an individual mind, and we seem to be left with one kind of continuity only-the material continuity which links, by the living, protoplasm in the germ, one generation of con- scious individuals with another. It will not be disputed that instinctive behaviour, however we account for it, presents the appearance of recog,nition as one of its essential traits. The creature acts as one who already knows; and is, therefore, familiar with the con(ditions and circumstances under which it is acting. This is true, even of the first performance of an instinctive action, and whether or not r epeated instinctive performances show any advance on, or essential difference from, the first performance, the familiarity with the conditions we are describing as recognition is not dependent upon repetition. In intelligent behaviour there is no repetition. In instinctive behaviour, however, there is practically perfect repetition; or, rather, a specific character of invariability in the repetitions. Yet this repetition in instinctive actions marks sometlhing negative so far as mentality is concerned. It is the negation of learning by experience. If, then, one peculiar mnark of instinctive B</page><page sequence="18">18 H. WILDON CARR. behaviour is invariability in repetition, and, consequently, an absence of "learning," must not recognition as a description of such behaviour be unmeaning? We seem to be driven for an explanation of instinctive knowledge to the bodily organisa- tion rather than to the mental organisation. Instinct suggests something structural in the nervous system. Now clearly, as it seems to me, if we can explain instinctive knowledge as a phenomenon of physiological process without mind, we raise a strong presumption that intelligent knowledge is explicable in the same way. I think we cannot explain instinctive knowledge without supposing the continuous activity of mind independently of physiological process. I will try to give reasons for this view. An example of instinctive behaviour is hardly required for the purpose of my argument, but it may be useful to refer to a definite case. I cannot do better than take Professor Lloyd Morgan's classical experiment with the incubated moorhen. The advantage of referring to a case like this is that we have an observation under what are practically laboratory conditions. I need not go into the details. The little creature, after many failures of the experimenter to induce the characteristic diving action, performed it at once in response to the stimulus, absolutely novel in its individual experience, of a romping puppy. In this behaviour everyone will, I suppose, admit that there was conscious awareness, though many will deny that there was anything whatever in it which can rightly be called recognition. Yet the familiarity with surroundings, the evident feeling at home in the environmenit, the absence of strangeness and embarrassment which was exhibited in its action, is, so far as its nature is concerned, indistinguishable from what I call recognition in my own experience. It is immediate knowledge, but so in my view is initelligent recognition. If then there be no difference of nature between intelligent and instinctive recognition, is the difference in the genesis? Is the view I have put forward of the genesis of intelligent recognition</page><page sequence="19">THE PROBLEM OF RECOGNITION. 19 inapplicable to instinctive recognition? We know that the creature's ancestors have behaved in this characteristic way throughout a long series of past generations, and that the imnmediacy of the response is due to a congenital disposition to act in this way. But the individual moorhen does not know this, unless we suppose that its memory goes back to those previous performances of its ancestors and that it has, as part of its congenital disposition, the power to revive memory- images of them. This seems improbable to such a high degree that we may as well reject it outright. Here then we have a creature manifesting all the signs of mentality and of mentality in a highly developed form. It acts as if it remembered what it is impossible that it can remember, for there is no continuity of consciousness between its action and the source of that action in past experience. The only unity and continuity manifest to us is the physio- logical process which has carried it from the fertilised germ, through the stage of unconscious life in the egg, to separate individual activity. Does the creature's mind somehow bridge this gulf which separates its individual brain from the brains of its progenitors? To answer this question we must form some concept of the creature's mind and its relation to the creature's body. As I indicated at the beginning, I do not propose to enter into the controversy between correlationists and interactionists as to the nature of the relation of mind and body. I want to look at mind and body from a different point of view than that at which this question is raised, and one which I think gives rise to no dissent. A certain unity of life characterises the complex and infinite variety of physiological processes which constitute the individual organisrn. Let us understand that this is meant when we refer to the body. There is also a certain unity of conscious processes which makes awareness of every kind part of a personal experience. Let us understand that this unity of conscious personal experience is meant by the mind. This B 2</page><page sequence="20">20 H. WILDON CARR. is what we ordinarily mean when we contrast body and mind, that is to say, we mean the living body, not the dead material body, and the thinking mind. It is different from the contrast between body and mind where what is meant by body is a certain disposition of molecules or atomns or electrons. The distinction is rather between life and iind, living and conscious processes. This distinction of mind and body is, I think, practically the same as that of Descartes. The mind thinks, the bo(ly lives. The body, being an extension, is automatic and mechanical and determined; the mind, being uliextended, is independent of the body which it guides and controls, and is free in the sense that it is without and not within the series of mechanical actions and reactions which modern physics has formulated in the principle of the conservation of energy. I am not arguing that body and mind are two substances as Descartes supposed, but that from the standpoint of a living creature endowed with conscious awareness, body and mind, i.e., living body anid thinking mind, are, as Descartes conceived them, two completely distinct realities, each with a quality which excludes the other, each a unity, and an individual unity. But the two unities do not coincide. From this point of view, namely, that of a distinction between living and thinking, it is possible to regard the living body as a self-regulated automaton distinct from the thinking mind or the soul-a view which I think Descartes held, and which in any case seems to accord with many recent physiological discoveries. Let me try and illustrate what I may call the mutual convergence and divergence of these two systematic unities, living body and thinking, mind.. An illuistration, suegested to me by the interesting work of Professor Sherrington on the subject of sentience, may make the meaning clear. The first part of the digestive process is the mastication of food; it is followed by deglutition, then by the many varied processes which are carried out by stomach and bowels.</page><page sequence="21">THE PROBLEM OF RECOGNITION. 21 The divisions between these various stages or processes of digestion are merely convenient,-all form part of one complex but co-ordinated systematic process. Parts of this process are accompanied by consciousness in the form of sentience. Masti- cation is accompaniied by the special forms of sentience, taste and smell; and all the muscular actions of the tongue and palate and the closing of the glottis during deglutition are also accompanied by awareness ; but from that stage in the digestive process sentience ceases, and most, nearly all, of the succe3eding stages, peristaltic action and the like, are devoid of any sentient accompaniment whatsoever. Now, we may say that sentience where it occurs in nmastication and deglutition is useful to the creature; it serves the purpose of incentive to obtain food ancd of discrimination in the food procured, and insentience where sentience does not occur is equally useful. And this is no doubt true. So far, however, as the efficienicy of the process is concerned, there seems to be no need for the presence of sentience. It may serve a purpose, but that purpose is no part of the actual process which it accompanies. Yet, though from the point of view of the digestive process the sentient accompani- ment is fragmentary and sporadic, sentience itself is not fragmentary and sporadic. It is one and continuous with the conscious awareness exercised by the unity we call a man's mind or soul. So when we describe a main's taste as refined, or cultivated, or debased, using the word taste in its original meaning to indicate his pleasure in what he eats, the fact, so far as the man's body is in question, concerns only a small part of a complex physiological process, which process is in- different to it; so far as the man's mind is in question, it concerns the whole of that uniity we call personal; it is con- tinous with a man's character. From the physiologist's point of view, therefore, sentience is an epiphenomenon accompanying, a certain specific living process, and exercising no efficiency; from the psycholo(rist's point of view, sentience is an inseparable element of another</page><page sequence="22">22 H. WILDON CARR. and altogether different order of reality and kind of unity. These two continuous processes meet for a brief moment in the functioning of a taste bulb. The true image of them is that of two spheres which if they meet can touch only at a point, which by moving on one another may bring successive points into contact, but the points which meet belong to divergent curves. This standpoint of the relation of mind and body is especially important in regard to the science and practice of psychiatry. Functional disorder appears to be due to some disturbance or disruption of the mental unity, as physiological disorder is due to some disturbance or disruption of the vital unity. Could we localise the point of union in some conarium, as Descartes thought he could, could we find some central neurone whose special function was to preside over the various activities and direct and control them, our task might be simnpler. We should at least have some point on which to concentrate our experimental study. But correlating conscious awareness with neural physiological process in the higher cortical centres, undoubtedly important as it is, does not bring us within sight of the principle of vital unity or of the principle of mental unity which we are seeking to determine and relate. If we follow the integrative function of the nervous system from its lowest and sirnplest nmode in the quasi-independent reflex arc, the integration of reflexes in complex physiological processes and co-ordinations and in instinctive reactions, to the final integration effected in the higher centres of the cerebral cortex anid accompanied by intelligence, we reach at last, not a chief neurone, nor a chief monad, but a countless mass of constituent neurones on the one lhand, and an infinite variety of functions accompanied by sentience, or other forms of mind, on the other, each of which may be in its turn pr-imuts inter pares. These two self-centred unities, thinking mind and living body, if from our individual standpoint they appear as two</page><page sequence="23">THE PROBLEM OF RECOGNITION. 23 complete systems, are from another standpoint not self-centred, but each continuous with a larger system of reality. We know that we directly continue in our body the life of countless generations of ancestors, and that we shall hand on this heritage to succeeding generations. We also know, though it is not so easy to envisage, that our mind is not formed within our individual lifetime and anew for our individuality. It is continuous with the experience of past generations and has been formed out of it. Each individual living centre bears along in the focus of its activity the impulsion as well as the construction of an illimitable past. Now, although we suppose that this past was always like the present, that each individual of a former generation united in his action, as we do, a thinking mind and living body, yet when we think of these two systems transcending the individual life, it seems to us impossible to think of the original source as twofold. What makes the original impulsion seem single is that mind and body appear to have evolved pari passu, every increase in mental range being co-ordinated with a complexity of brain structure, while what makes the dualism in the individual seem pronounced is the complete disparity between the two orders. From the standpoint of evolution we are naturally, I think, attracted to Spinoza's idea of mind and body as two modes of one substance. Whether with Spinoza we name this substance God, or with Bergson Pl?an vital, we have to recognise that, though the source may be single, the manifestation is always twofold- the living body and the thinking mind. This brings us at once to the main problem-how is this twofold continuity carried over from one generation to the next ? Let ine first notice one question, which may for many people bave a decisive bearing on the solution. Is the difference between the individual mind of an animal, whose behaviour is predominantly instinctive, and the mind of.a man, whose behaviour is predominantly intelligent, a quantitative difference only, or is it a qualitative difference also ? It seems</page><page sequence="24">24 H. WILDON CARR. to me, relying wholly on analogy, direct proof being obviously impossible, that the mind of the lower animal is in every respect like the human mind, differing only in its range. There seems to me every reason to suppose that the moorhen's mind differs from mine in the ratio that its brain differs in complexity from mine. Its brain registers, so to speak, its range of action, as my brain registers mine, and it is not likely, again judging by analogy, that its mind is inadequate, or more than adequate, to its range of action. If this be so, then the mind of the lower animal is, like mine, a continuity of personal experience, and must stand to the continuity of physiological process, the living body, in the relation I have schematised by imagining two spheres in contact. There is in that case no difference in kind between human behaviour and the behaviour of the lower animals. There is only a difference, which may be very deceptive, in the proportion of their behaviour which we describe as instinctive and that which we describe as intelligent. But is it necessary to suppose that an animal has a mind? Can we not class instinctive actions under vital actions ? We associate with mind the creation of ?esthetic, logical, and ethical values, and we find it very difficuilt to suppose that there is any- thina even corresponding to these in the mind of the animal. It seems to me that in instinctive action we can distingo,uish elements which are certainly mental and not merely vital. These are (a) sentient enjoyment, or simply sentience, indicating conscious awareness of action in progress ; (b) familiarity, indicated by the absence of strangeness in the behaviour (this is what I call recognition); and (c) pre-aware- ness, a certain readiness of attention or alertness, indicated by a forward-looking attitude towards an action. All of these, if they be present, and to the extent to which they are present, are mental characters in the full sense of the term mnental. What this connotes for me is that all these characters are con- tinuous with, and derive meaning fromi, the fact that they</page><page sequence="25">TIIE PROBLEM OF RECOGNITION. 25 enter as constituent elements into a mental organisation, the unity of an experience. It is a two-fold continuity, then, which has to be carried from one generation to the lnext. The link which joins the generations is neither living body nor thinking mind, neither brain nor soul, but a germ. The germ neither acts nor thinks, at least not in any ordinary meaning of those terms; it undergoes development, and it holds within it the potentiality of developing a living body and a thinking mind. We are led, therefore, it seems to me by logical necessity to the concept of life-life which is nlot the miere abstract idea of an attribuite common to processes we class as living, but life which is the concrete idea of a reality of which living body and thinking mind, organic activity and personality, are modes. I will not here enlarge on this concept but be content with indicating that in it, in my view, lies the solution of the problem of recognition. It will be recognised as the doctrine of Bergson in Creative Evolution which I have tried elsewhere to expound. I will now draw together the main lines of my argument, and try to show the thesis I have endeavoured to establish. 1. Recognition is knowingr what in some manner we already know. It is the mark of our past experience which a present and entirely novel sense-presentation bears, and this mark is immediately apprehended as part of the presenitation, and is not inferred from it. 2. Recognition implies prior cognition. It does not imply that a memory-image of the prior cognition is present in con- sciousness together with the recognition; and a fortiori it does not imply a mental process of comiparison with a prior cogni- tion or the perception or judgment of a relation of similarity. 3. IRecognition is the resultant of learning by experience,- the conditionate, not the condition, of learning by experience It is not by recognising that we learn by experience, but havino learnt by experience we recognise.</page><page sequence="26">26 H. WILDON CARR. 4. Learning by experience is not dependent on repetition, and in experience there is, in fact, no repetition. Learning is the mental process by which the mind incorporates and assimilates experience. It is an activity which begins with, and continues throughout, experience. 5. Recognition may be initelligent or instinctive. Both are of the same nature. Each is the immediate apprehension of entirely novel sense-presentations with the mark of prior cognition. 6. In intelligent recognition we can by reflection bring to the mind the factors of the process; and so, in a inanner and within a limited range, reconstitute the process. We can bring to mind memory-images of the prior cognition so far as the prior cognition falls within the memory range of the individual experience. This gives rise to the illusion that recognition is dependent on such reflective thought. We think we recognise after reflecting, whereas in reality we reflect after recognising. In instinctive recognition, on the other hand, we cannot reconstitute by reflection the prior cognition, because it does not fall within the individual's experience. It lies in the ancestral experience. 7. The problem of recognition is the same for intelligent as for instinctive recognition-how can new sense-presentation be known as what is already known? 8. The solution suggested rests on a distinction between life and mind, or living body and thinking mind, and a com- parison between the activity of each. They are distinct self- centred organic continuities; sentient experience enters each system, but the systems are tangrential to one another. The mind is an organisation of experience. All past experience has not only contributed to it but is incorporated within it, giving, it character and individuality. New sentient experi- ence can only enter by receiving the mould or mark of this organisation. This constitutes recognition. 9. Instinctive recoanition raises a larger problem. How is</page><page sequence="27">THE PROBLEM OF RECOGNITION. 27 mental continuity established and maintained between one generation and another, since generations are separated by a state in which there is neither living body nor thinking mind ? The living germ has neither brain nor soul, but is the potentiality of the development of both. The solution sug- gested is the concept of life, not an abstraction from living process, but a pure, universal, concrete concept.</page></plain_text>
