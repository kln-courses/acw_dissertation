<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Hogarth’s Animals PIERS BEIRNE University of Southern Maine, Portland, Maine. It is well established that discursive innovations in literature and philosophy encouraged  pro-animal sentiments in 18th-century England. Far less well known in this regard is  the “animal turn” in the graphic arts. This article seeks to redress this imbalance by  documenting the extensive representation of animals in the paintings, drawings, and  printed engravings of the English artist William Hogarth (1697–1764). It outlines the  four chief ways in which Hogarth pictured animals—namely, as hybrids, as edibles, as  “pets,” and as signs of satire. In so doing the article asks, how did Hogarth see animals?  How should we see Hogarth’s animals? key words: animal it-narrative, companion animals, edibles, Four Stages of  Cruelty, Game Laws, Hogarth, hybrids, “pets,” satire INTRODUCTION This article was prompted by my reading of The Four Stages of Cruelty, a series of  extraordinary printed engravings circulated in early 1751 by the English artist William  Hogarth (1697–1764). An instant sensation in its own time, The Four Stages of Cruelty  has nowadays achieved almost canonical status—as a milestone in philosophy and legal  history in the movement toward animal rights and in sociological criminology, my home  territory, in the identification of the link between animal cruelty and interhuman vio- lence. An initial foray into the merits of The Four Stages of Cruelty quickly led me to  see, however, that Hogarth’s famous prints have been greeted with a largely uncontested  acceptance of the artist’s own brief comments on their production and dissemination.  How much trust should be placed, I wondered, in Hogarth’s (1753/1955) own claim  that The Four Stages of Cruelty “were done in hopes of preventing in some degree that  cruel treatment of poor Animals which makes the streets of London more disagreeable  to the human mind, than any thing what ever, the very describing of which gives pain”  (p. 226)? Perhaps there is something too vague and not inquisitive enough, I reasoned,  about the continued insertion of Hogarth’s complex picturing of cruelty into a trajectory  with Pythagoras at one end and Gandhi and Margaret Mead at the other. Perhaps one  cannot properly spy Hogarth there. Journal of Animal Ethics 3 (2): 133–162 © 2013 by the Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois </page> <page sequence="2"> 134 Journal of Animal Ethics, 3 (2013)  A more nuanced reading of The Four Stages of Cruelty was abruptly deflected, how- ever, by my unexpected discovery that this series of popular prints was not the only oc- casion on which Hogarth chose to depict nonhuman animals (henceforth, animals). To  the contrary, animals appear in Hogarth’s art throughout the entire course of his career.  Yet despite the voluminous commentary on Hogarth’s creations and his recognition as  one of England’s foremost artists, very little indeed has been noted about the pervasive  representation of animals in his art.1 That deficiency, I try to remedy here. I begin by  documenting the extraordinary diversity of species featured by Hogarth. ANIMALS GALORE! My awakening to the sheer pervasiveness of animals in Hogarth’s work has been at once  surprising and invigorating. Undoubtedly, the number of my sightings of smaller quad- rupeds such as cats and dogs is not an accurate account of their presence because that  enumeration is quite difficult to achieve. This is especially so when Hogarth has them  hidden behind Georgian chaises longues or armchairs. So it is, too, when he positions them  baked in pies or asleep in dark corners or else departed and at rest in family burial plots.  That said, however, a magnifying glass and an abacus are about all that is needed to  document animals’ persistent appearance in Hogarth’s art. In one of his earliest works, the  12 engravings in his Hudibras series (1726), for example, not only at the margins of raucous  crowd scenes but also at center stage and in the course of violent confrontations of various  sorts, there appear several horses, dogs, bears, an armadillo, a bat, a cat, a crocodile, a frog,  a snake, and a mounted swordfish. His very last creation, the cataclysmic Tailpiece: The  Bathos (1764), contains the image of a dead Apollo—likely intended to represent Hogarth  himself—recumbent in a carriage that is drawn through the heavens by three exhausted  horses, one of whom seems already to have expired. This sad and grisly scene is illustrated  with signboards such as “Finis,” “H. Nature Bankrupt,” and “The World’s End.”  Between the Hudibras series near the beginning of his career and The Bathos at the  end—over the lengthy course of four decades, in other words—Hogarth painted, drew,  and engraved a wide range of animals: bears, dancing and fighting, muzzled and shackled  or asleep; birds, both caged and not, including crows, doves, ducks, eagles, geese, owls, a  parrot, ravens, seagulls, songbirds, and swans; bulls; canids, including foxes, wolves, and  especially dogs, small, medium, and large; dogs coddled as “pets” and posed in portraiture  and dogs who fight, growl, sleep, eat, and starve; cats and kittens; cattle, including those  driven to and from market for sale and slaughter; chickens, chicks, and cockerels (fight- ing and not); chimpanzees and monkeys; crustaceans; donkeys used as beasts of burden  and as objects of cruelty; eels and other fishes, some swimming in rivers and streams and  hunted by fishermen and others, such as swordfishes, hung on walls as trophies; goats;  hares; horses used in racing, for transport, in agriculture, and by the army (including one  Trojan horse); insects, including beetles and lice; lions and cheetahs; pigs and piglets;  rabbits, real and imagined; rodents, including rats and mice; sheep; shellfishes, especially  oysters; and snakes. </page> <page sequence="3">  Beirne, Hogarth’s Animals 135  To this lengthy list of animals depicted in Hogarth’s art and a handful of animated  human skeletons must be added an astonishing array of part-animal/part-human hybrids.  Among these are winged angels, centaurs, devils, dragons, elves, fauns, gargoyles, Gor- gons, griffins, satyrs, sirens, sphinxes, troglodytes, unicorns, and zephyrs. There are still  other hybrid creatures in Hogarth’s art who resist or even defy identification but who  resemble anthropomorphized foxes or hobgoblins. HOGARTH SEEING ANIMALS How and where did Hogarth encounter the animals represented in his art? The short  answer to this question is: at every turn and in every nook and cranny. For one thing, in  1700 most Londoners still lived, as they always had, either with domesticated animals or in  great proximity to them. In addition to the modernist desire to appoint increasing numbers  of dogs and cats as “pets,” urban dwellers often kept cows for milk (see Times of the Day:  Evening, 1736), cattle and pigs for slaughter, and chickens for eggs in their cellars.  There is no doubt that the sight, sound, and smell of numerous animals must have  been impressed on Hogarth from the moment of his birth in 1697 in St. Bartholomew  Close, West Smithfield. The home of his parents, Richard Hogarth and Anne Gibbons,  was within easy earshot of England’s largest meat market and barely one minute’s walk  away. In 1701 the family moved to St. John’s Street, which was plumb on the thoroughfare  along which most market-bound sheep and cattle were driven to Smithfield from the  north. Five or six days a week, young Hogarth therefore would have seen and heard the  animals who were driven through London’s congested streets to the medieval Smithfield  market. Mondays were set aside for the sale and slaughter of sheep, Fridays for cattle.  Each market day roughly 11,000 sheep and 1,400 cattle were herded into the Smithfield  meat market and bought, sold, and killed there (Dodd, 1856, p. 90). To the cattle and  sheep killed at Smithfield for beef, mutton, and lamb meat must be added an untold  number of chickens, ducks, geese, small birds, horses, and pigs.  Had he so chosen, young William would have been able to enter the Tower menagerie  and view an exotic collection of the monarch’s animals, such as lions, elephants, a leopard,  and a polar bear.2 If he had walked to the open fields just north of the city, he might not  have seen many animals in nature, but he would have seen dogs, bulls, donkeys, and  even, on occasion, horses, as they were marched in procession to be baited for humans’  pleasure (for example, see Hogarth, Hudibras’ First Adventure, 1726; Second Stage  of Cruelty, 1751). The seasonal Bartholomew and Southwark fairs too offered a visual  extravaganza (see Southwark Fair, 1733). For four weeks each year, mostly in August,  the enormously popular Bartholomew fair engulfed Hogarth’s West Smithfield neigh- borhood. Standard attractions included jugglers, fire-eaters, ballad singers, ropedancers,  peep shows, and puppet shows. They offered “a Noah’s Ark of creatures,” sometimes  including “monkeys imitating men, and men mimicking monkeys” (Morley, 1815, p. 350).  Plays and pantomimes were there too, and they always featured a cast of leading actors  and comedians from the famed Drury Lane theater. The fair’s shows, stages, stalls, and  </page> <page sequence="4"> 136 Journal of Animal Ethics, 3 (2013) whirligigs zigzagged their boisterous way along the local streets and alleys and must have  left an indelible impression on young Hogarth. In later life he recalled, Shews of all sort gave me uncommon pleasure when an Infant and mimickry common  to all children was remarkable in me. An early access to a neighbouring Painter drew  my attention from play evry opportunity was employd in attempt at drawing.” (Hogarth,  1753/1955, p. 204) He then added, “Subjects I consider’d as writers do my Picture was my Stage and men  and women my actors who were by Mean of certain Actions and express[ions] to Exhibit  a dumb shew” (Hogarth, 1753/1955, p. 209).  In his book Memoirs of Bartholomew Fair, Henry Morley (1815) documented the  many monsters, prodigies, and animals annually on display there. Among these were  human oddities with deformities, real or contrived. They included dwarves and giants,  the thin and the fat, hermaphrodites, a woman with three breasts, and a child with three  legs. Side by side with these human oddities were rare animals, who around 1700 were  said to have included a little turkey-horse “that shews several diverting and surprising  actions” (Morley, 1815, p. 323), a “jack-call,” a “picary,” an Egyptian panther (“spotted  like a leopard”), and “a strange, monstrous creature . . . having a Head like a Child, Legs  and Arms very wonderful, with a Long Tail like a Serpent, wherewith he Feeds himself,  Figure 1. Southwark Fair (William Hogarth, 1733). </page> <page sequence="5">  Beirne, Hogarth’s Animals 137 as an Elephant doth” (Morley, 1815, p. 325). At the fair Hogarth also would have seen  various caged animals, muzzled bears, songbirds for sale as food or as “pets,” animal  figures in masquerades, and both animals and humans on display as monsters or crea- tures of indeterminate category or as devils (who on early modern stages were always  comical). Hogarth (1753/1997) wrote in The Analysis of Beauty that “when improper, or  incompatible excesses meet, they always excite laughter” (p. 37). He then instantiated  the marginal figure in March to Finchley of a “fat grown face of a man, with an infant’s  cap on, and the rest of the child’s dress stuff’d,” and wrote, “[This] contrivance I have  seen at Bartholomew-fair, and always occasion’d a roar of laughter” (p. 37).  Some animals, Hogarth would have seen and encountered repeatedly in that swath  of London marked roughly by Leicester Fields, Smithfield, Southwark, and Chiswick.  On display in front of his house on fashionable Leicester Square—where he lived from  1733 onward—would have been a daily parade of horses and donkeys who noisily pulled  wagons, carts, and drays as they were forced to make the delivery rounds of goods and  victuals to the well-to-do townhouses. There, too, dogs and even perhaps monkeys would  have been walked and paraded by their owners or their owners’ servants. In addition  to these noisy comings and goings, between Leicester Fields and his country house in  Chiswick, about six miles west of where he grew up, numerous horses pulled coaches  and carriages.  Afoot in his daily life on the streets of the metropolis, Hogarth not infrequently must  have encountered animals who were dying or already dead. Among them were dead dogs  and dead cats. Cats were typically not well provided for because they were mostly regarded  neither as “pets” nor as edibles-to-be. Despite Hogarth’s frequent representation of them  in domestic scenes—in bedrooms, drawing rooms, and kitchens, in particular—cats tended  to be tolerated only when they were proven catchers of rats and mice. Cats were often  the objects of awful cruelty in London. Given longstanding legend that associated them  with evil and with witchcraft, cats were perhaps the species most singled out for lethal  abuse. In Daniel Defoe’s (1719) Robinson Crusoe, for example, they were shot and their  kittens drowned. In Hogarth’s Noon (Four Times of the Day, 1738), a dead cat lies in the  gutter with a brick and small rocks nearby, suggesting she has been stoned with these  implements and discarded along with other rubbish. In Hogarth’s First Stage of Cruelty  (1751) each of several cats is about to die—by evisceration, by enforced fighting with  other cats, and by being heaved through the air or thrown from a rooftop.  In the streets of nearby parishes, stray dogs were a very common sight. Referring to  dogs and, in particular, cats, one scribe condemned “the Barbarities exercised by our Youth  on brute Animals” (Anonymous, 1751, p. 34). About the animal cruelties engaged in by  the gin-besotted urchins of St. Giles, he observed, “[There are] many instances that are  daily seen among us of this sort” (Anonymous, 1751, p. 34). Another observer complained  that “much has been said and printed of late about the horrible nuisance of mad-dogs; and  many lives have thereby been lost in a few years” (Massie, 1754, p. 15)—as a remedy he  proposed a dog tax that would prevent the roaming of dogs about the streets and fields.  Still another noted that the area was “long known” for having “wolfish-looking dogs”  </page> <page sequence="6"> 138 Journal of Animal Ethics, 3 (2013) (Beames, 1850/1970, pp. 25–26). Unsurprisingly, therefore, many of the dogs depicted  by Hogarth were wolf-looking and starving; see, for example, the dogs in The South Sea  Scheme (1721), Sancho Panzo’s Feast (1731), Gin Lane (1751), and Columbus Breaking  the Egg (1752). In Marriage à la Mode (1745, plate 6), a skeletal dog frantically snatches  a decapitated sheep’s head that adorns a middle-class dinner table. In Cruelty’s Reward  (The Four Stages of Cruelty, 1751), a dog is depicted devouring boiled human body parts.  When he painted and drew animals, Hogarth sometimes represented the sounds  and smells of animals as much as he did the sight of them. Some of his animal pictures  thus reflect the extravagant daily challenges that 18th-century life presented to London- ers’ olfactory and auditory senses. For example, London streets and alleyways had an  ubiquitous overlay of horse dung—a brown sludge that was collected by gong farmers  on the streets, taken to Dung Wharf, and then sold to market gardeners upstream. Ac- companying the chaotic driving of animals on the way to Smithfield market to be sold  and slaughtered, a mass of fecal matter was deposited on the narrow thoroughfares. It  is not hard to imagine how this unappetizing smell was exacerbated—by heavy rains,3  for example, or when the terrified animals were “harassed by reckless drovers and mad- dened by savage dogs” (Anonymous, 1849, p. 142; see the second of The Four Stages of  Cruelty and also Cockayne, 2007). Having arrived at Smithfield market, those animals  not bought and sold and forced to move elsewhere were slaughtered in undrained cellars,  sheds, and outhouses. Next to the pooling blood, exhausted horses were slaughtered in  knackers’ yards.  Some of Hogarth’s pictures also force us to listen to the awful hubbub of terrified  animals on their way to slaughter: Cattle bellow, sheep bleat, pigs squeal, ducks hiss, and  geese honk. Adding to this spiraling cacophony were horses who neighed and whinnied;  stray dogs who barked, whimpered, and whined; and cats who screeched. This daily ani- mal travail was exacerbated by knife-sharpeners grinding, vendors hawking, musicians  humming, revelers shouting, and church bells pealing. This intense din and more can be  heard in pictures such as Hogarth’s Hudibras Encounters the Skimmington (1726), whose  action is aroused by the ancient custom whereby a henpecked man carrying a distaff is  forced to ride on a horse with his wife, sitting behind her and facing backward, while an  assembled crowd loudly jeers and mocks them both. We can hear it also in The Enraged  Musician (1741), where a violinist cuffs his ears, unable to practice because all around  him is noise and hubbub; and from the crowded scenes in Southwark Fair (1733), The  Idle Prentice Executed at Tyburn (1747, Industry and Idleness, plate 11), and March to  Finchley (1750).  Sparse though they were, some of Hogarth’s written words provide small glimpses into  his thinking about the importance of animals in his art. Thus, in a Francophobic letter  supporting aesthetic nationalism, signed “Britophil,” he advised, “Would gentlemen but  venture to see with their own eyes. Let but the comparison of pictures with nature be  their only guide” (Hogarth, 1737, p. 385). Later, in The Analysis of Beauty, he offered the  fire-brimmed warning that those who disregard “Nature” are likely to descend into “the  coal pit,” the “maze of uncertainty,” and “the Labyrinth of variety” (Hogarth, 1753/1997,  </page> <page sequence="7">  Beirne, Hogarth’s Animals 139 pp. 115–116). Quite what he meant by the enigmatic term “Nature” is unclear, as is his  condemnatory view of mazes and labyrinths (he—their master architect!). Moreover,  The Analysis contains similarly flurried references to the respective qualities of Nature’s  animals and their proper representation in painting. All species are said to have their own  fitness for human society and their own beauty—located, ideally, around the “serpentine  line.” Of a warhorse, he writes, “This noble creature stands foremost among brutes. . . .[it  is] the most useful animal in the brute-creation” (Hogarth, 1753/1997, p. 63). So, in a  handful of canvases when Hogarth had in mind the Hanoverian dynasty, he depicted  their royal line using the conventional symbol of the white warhorse, in good condition  and in poor, in The Good Samaritan (1736) and The Bathos (1764), respectively. SEEING HOGARTH’S ANIMALS How did Hogarth translate his views of animals’ lives into his artistic compositions? This  question has no easy answer. It must be said that the trove of animals in Hogarth’s pic- tures cannot be properly appreciated simply by staring at them in earnest and somehow  without prejudice. Although I do not wish to belabor the obvious, this is so because it is  never animals, as such, whom we see in Hogarth’s art but always his representations of  them. Between them and him and between them and us always stand epistemological and  emotional distance and observational categories. (So it is, always, with our representa- tions of those others whom we trap in relationships of dominance and exploitation.) To  attempt to see how Hogarth saw animals, in other words, corrective lenses are essential.  When we view Hogarth’s animals pictured in a book or in a gallery or online, for ex- ample, we are involved in much the same sort of enterprise as when we look in a museum  of natural history at animals’ stuffed bodies or peer in a zoo at animals in cages or glass  tanks or in human-contrived “natural” environments. In none of these vistas do human  audiences see animals roaming free in their natural habitat. In every case they have  been reared, captured, or killed for speciesist reasons: colonization, dominion, profit,  arrogance, entertainment, vanity. In each case, when we are offered animal sightings, we  move from one inauthentic viewing opportunity to another, each animal carefully framed  and categorized, each more or less meticulously positioned on some taxonomic scale.  To approach the animals represented in Hogarth’s pictures, one must first see through  his use of still other animals. These invisible creatures actually form the very lifeblood of  each canvas. His paintbrushes contained the hair from the bodies, nostrils, and ears of  dead horses, oxen, pigs, and squirrels. Much of his paint Hogarth would have had to mix  with animals’ fat and their ground and charred bones. The bones and skin of horses and  rabbits were probably the basis of bonding agents for his canvases. The folio volumes on  display in his self-portrait Hogarth: The Artist and His Pug (1745) were woven together  with the sinews of cattle or sheep and are clad in the skin of calves or pigs. While he was  painting in his Leicester Fields studio, or as he was gathering his thoughts as he ambled  on a rural peregrination in Kent or rode in his one-horse carriage through St. Giles, for  instance, Hogarth’s own skin was often covered with that of animals. While he painted  </page> <page sequence="8"> 140 Journal of Animal Ethics, 3 (2013) the different states of his 1745 self-portrait, for example, we can see that his head was  alternately adorned with a horse-hair periwig for fashion and a lamb’s wool cap, both  for warmth and for use as an accessory to signify his trade. His smocks would have been  adorned at the neck with animals’ fur (as they were, for example, in his Portrait of Pine,  1756). At the bottom of his body, his shoes and sandals and buckled half-boots or buskins  were crafted from the skin of cows and pigs. Moreover, though little has been recorded  about what Hogarth did or did not eat or about his gustatory preferences, it is reasonable  to assume that, while he painted, food from animals often provided him sustenance.  About Hogarth’s intentions in any given piece of work, precious little of his own voice  is in the written historical record. In this regard it might seem of some comfort that in  his works Hogarth occasionally displayed witticisms on signboards or appended a few  moralizing lines of text or inscribed an ironic biblical quote at their footers. However,  regarding only a few of these textual appendages do we know with certainty which ones  the artist himself created and what, precisely, he intended with them. Many were com- posed by his friends or someone in his employ. The moralizing scriptural commentaries  beneath Rake’s Progress (1733), Industry and Idleness (1747), and The Four Stages of  Cruelty (1751), for example, were composed and selected by the Reverend Doctors  John Hoadly, Arnold King, and James Townley, respectively. What precisely did Hogarth  intend with Townley’s commentary appended to The First Stage of Cruelty (1751)—this  the stanza that upbraids Tom Nero, the thericidal4 youth seen first torturing a dog and  later working as a hackney coachman and beating his horse with a cudgel?5 Inhuman Wretch! say whence proceeds This coward Cruelty? What Int’rest springs from barb’rous deeds? What Joy from Misery? It would also be helpful to know what Hogarth meant in the preceding stanza both by  “Cruelty” to animals and by “barb’rous deeds.” Moreover, with what mechanism did he  try to link “barb’rous deeds” with “Joy” and “Misery”? Did he do so with the determin- ist doctrine of sensationalism, perhaps? Or with random acts of divine providence? Or  adherence to Calvinist obligation?  In this last regard, one has to wonder, given the accompanying textual clues noted  previously, how influential Hogarth’s puritan-leaning friends were in the forming of his  pictorial intentions. In so pervasively picturing animals, was Hogarth moved by a chari- table disposition toward animals? How did he acquire such sentiments? Was such charity,  whether displayed publicly or piously in private, newly a condition of becoming or being  human?  Consider also the possible influence exerted on Hogarth by Benjamin Hoadly and  by the crusading magistrate Henry Fielding. It is true that Hogarth and Fielding shared  an interest in latitudinarianism, especially in its Hoadlian guise, and that both were in  Hoadly’s social circle. The rector of London’s St. Peter-Le-Poor and the sometime bishop  of Winchester, the peripatetic Hoadly was a latitudinarian. As such, he was an outspoken  </page> <page sequence="9">  Beirne, Hogarth’s Animals 141 divine who s upported Lockean virtue and acts of benevolence and charity more than he  did dissenters and religious devotion. Some of the specific qualities of charity are visible  in Fielding’s employment of the idea of the Good Samaritan in his first novel, Joseph  Andrews. Samaritanism appears not only in Hogarth’s Good Samaritan (1737) but also  in A Harlot’s Progress (1732) and in each of the four plates of The Four Stages of Cruelty  (1751). However, if one reads backward from Hogarth’s canvas to his intent, while at the  same time interpolating one’s chosen causal agent between them, then any number of  motives may be ascribed to why Hogarth pictured what he did. At times, latitudinarian- ism might unlock Hogarth’s intent (Greene, 1977). But so too might freemasonry and  critical deism and Shaftesbury’s anti-Hobbesian aesthetics. All one can say with much  certainty is that from beginning to end Hogarth’s art was consistently anti-clerical and  fiercely opposed to popery.  The identity and configuration of animals in Hogarth’s pictures tend to vary from  one phase of his career to another. They varied according to whether he was working  chiefly as an engraver of book plates and heraldic coats of arms (hybrids), as a painter  of religious history (angels, hybrids), as a portraitist (dogs, cats), as a social critic and  satirist (bears, cats, dogs, monkeys, owls), or as a prophet of general doom and decay  (angels, white horses). Which animals Hogarth chose to depict and on which occasions  also often varied with his intended audience. Sometimes, the audience was narrowly  defined. This was usually so with his commissioned family portraits, for example, which  had little more than the family dog, a cat, and once or twice a songbird. At other times,  there were several audiences for one and the same picture. Multiple audiences tended  to need multiple species with murkier messages and clarity trickier to come by. This was  evidently the case with The Four Stages of Cruelty (1751), in which Hogarth tried to  appeal simultaneously to the urban elites, to the cognoscenti, and to common folk.  If Hogarth wished to use animals as metaphors, then these were typically dogs, cats,  monkeys, and horses. If he was satirizing some problem known to involve animals them- selves, then he used bears (Hudibras, 1726); dogs (Gin Lane, 1751; The First Stage of  Cruelty, 1751); game birds (Pit Ticket, 1759); horses (The South Sea Scheme, 1720; The  Second Stage of Cruelty, 1751; The Bathos, 1764); and rabbits (Cuniculari, or the Wise  Men of Godalming in Consultation, 1726).  Hogarth’s pictures display an encyclopedic knowledge and a churning kaleidoscope  of aims. In his modern moral subjects (harlots, coachmen, rakes, and so on), for example,  these pictures included shifting agendas for social reform. His images advocated for the  promotion of hard work and an ethic of individual responsibility; the rescue, care, and  proper moral and occupational instruction of London’s numerous street children; and  the rights of painters to the exclusive sale and distribution of their creations. And they  opposed much classical continental art and its fashionable reception in Britain; financial  speculation; street crime; and the unearned authority of judges, lawyers, doctors, cler- ics, and a decadent monarchy. His paintings were often dense tapestries whose multiple  meanings were accessible only through the unlocking of linked clues, puzzles, and coded  messages. Though Hogarth was often keen to impart a moral message in his art, the detail  </page> <page sequence="10"> 142 Journal of Animal Ethics, 3 (2013) in many of his scenes is often excruciating and overloaded and at times contradictory and  even unnecessary.6  When different species are represented in Hogarth’s art, their spatial position on  the canvas typically follows the conventions of the great chain of being. At the top of his  paintings there tend to be fluttering and preening angels and other heavenly creatures.  In the middle are humans, and the eye is drawn to them immediately; they are at the  center of attention. Near or at the bottom are animals. In what follows I outline the four  chief ways in which Hogarth represented animals—namely, as hybrids, as edibles, as  signs of satire, and as objects of “petting” practices. HYBRIDS Hybrids lurk in the very depths or at the outermost margins of Hogarth’s art. Images of  the hybrid warriors and wretches in Greek tragedies and Roman wars would have been  introduced to him by his father, Richard Hogarth, a classical scholar (Hogarth, 1753/1955,  p. 205). Young Hogarth surely would have been familiar with Horace’s question in Ars  Poetica’s first line: Supposing a painter chose to put a human head on a horse’s neck, or to spread feathers  of various colours over the limbs of several different creatures, or to make what in the  upper part is a beautiful woman tails off into a hideous fish, could you help laughing? At the three-day Southwark fair and at the month-long Bartholomew fair (plumb on the  Hogarths’ Smithfield doorstep), the costumes of some of the Drury Lane actors indicated  they were portraying centaurs, satyrs, and devils—and comical ones at that (Southwark  Fair, 1733). Still other hybrids, some of them born of ancient Celtic traditions, appeared  on stage in burlesque, in satirical plays, and in poems such as Butler’s Hudibras and  Pope’s Rape of the Lock.  If Hogarth’s genius lay in creating a new British style of art based on iconoclastic  comedy and savage satire, then at the beginning of this accomplishment he leaned  heavily on 17th-century animal iconography in the Netherlands. Among Dutch and  Flemish painters at that time there were two animal-centered traditions. One was the  formal and realist portraiture of cows (signifying wealth), dogs (loyalty), and other  animals by Aelbert Cuyp, Paulus Potter, and Frans Snyders (Wolloch, 2006, chapter  6). This tradition Hogarth seems altogether to have ignored. The other was the “low”  and “impolite” tradition of Dutch painters such as Adriaen van Ostade and Egbert  van Heemskerck and the Flemish painters the Brueghels and David Teniers. Known  for their strong colors and rowdy scenes, their paintings portrayed common folk going  about their daily business in ordinary places such as taverns, surgeries, meeting houses,  and cobblers. There was much irreverence in these scenes, with ale aplenty and much  spilled urine. The placing of animal heads on human bodies was also an old feature in  Flemish art, particularly in the service of political satire and social commentary (Antal,  1962, pp. 61–62). </page> <page sequence="11">  Beirne, Hogarth’s Animals 143  With respect to his depiction of hybrids, Hogarth certainly must have looked long  and hard at the paintings of the two Egbert van Heemskercks, father (ca. 1634–1704)  and son (ca. 1676–1744). Associated with a lengthy tradition of animal portraiture, van  Heemskerck the elder had migrated from Holland to London around 1675, living close  to the Hogarth family during William’s childhood. He brought with him to London the  traditions of Dutch genre painting and Flemish animal-human imagery (Antal, 1962, p.  55; Paulson, 1971, pp. 27–29). Hogarth probably knew of van Heemskerck the elder’s  Quaker Meeting (ca. 1680) and possibly also his humorous satire Midnight Magistrate  (ca. 1690).7 In the latter, van Heemskerck depicted a trial in which the magistrate—a  monkey—hears a case against a young female, a cat, while animals and hybrids observe.  The presence of several hybrid constables and their actions, viewed with alarm by a  concerned owl, make it eerily reminiscent of Hogarth’s Cruelty in Perfection (1751; see  also the owl in his The Innkeeper’s Wife and Daughter Assisting Don Quixote, 1742).  Though because of their identical names and their years of overlap, it has been difficult  to attribute a painting precisely to one van Heemskerck rather than the other, consider  also what is more likely Egbert van Heemskerck the younger’s crude popular engraving  Satire on Quacks and Quackery (ca. 1730). In his Satire van Heemskerck used animals  as symbols of ignorant and callous surgeons. This he did, in particular, by portraying a  Figure 2. Satire on  Quacks and Quackery  (Egbert van Heemskerck  the Younger, ca. 1730). </page> <page sequence="12"> 144 Journal of Animal Ethics, 3 (2013) bear, a chimpanzee, a donkey, and a fox in the messy act of disemboweling a cat, a scene  that is gazed at by other cats and by dogs, hanging fishes, and rabbits and attended to by  a smiling decapitated hog’s head.  Hogarth’s decision to invest in the use of hybrids was also swayed by the new print  media whereby satire was communicated—novels, newspapers, printed engravings,  broadsheets, and advertising handbills. Hogarth especially admired and leaned on the  literary structure and expanding success of novels, foremost among which were Swift’s  Gulliver’s Travels (“Gulliver”: hybrid, from gull and veritas)8 and Pope’s several Epistles.  In Gulliver’s Travels, for example, Swift’s literary deployment of part-human, part-horse  and part-human, part-orangutan hybrids surely stimulated the occasional centaur, griffin,  and sphinx in Hogarth’s art—see also Hogarth’s Punishment of Lemuel Gulliver (1726)  and The Festival of the Golden Rump (1737).  However, Hogarth’s hybrids are not at all like Swift’s. Hogarth never depicted his hy- brids with anything like the rigor and the intent with which Swift wielded his Yahoos and  Houyhnhnms. Swift’s hybrids grapple with human identity: They act, talk, think, reason, and  feel, even if they do so somewhat “primitively.” Hogarth’s hybrids do none of these things.  Mostly, his hybrids crouch, threaten, scowl, and lurk. They look, well, satyr-ish. They merely  look the part. In effect, they are neither part-animal nor part-human—there is no animal in  Hogarth’s “part-animal,” and there is no human in his “part-human.” In the overall picture  Hogarth’s hybrids are quite dispensable. They are props. Hogarth’s hybrids no more “act”  than did a much-festooned, peripatetic mechanical duck of the 1730s (Hogarth, 1753/1997,  p. 62): In any meaningful way, it didn’t. Were hybrids to be excised from The South Sea  Scheme, for example, little else would change. “Honesty” could just as well be flogged by a  mechanical duck as by a hybrid. Hogarth’s hybrids don’t even quack. However, just as they  did at the sight of a mechanical duck, audiences erupted in gales of laughter at the sight of  hybrids.9 Perhaps this was what Hogarth intended. Hybrids are good for a giggle.  To sample Hogarth’s hybrids, some of which are quite ornate and which typify his  execution of them during his apprenticeship to a metal engraver, see the following works:  • The South Sea Scheme (1721). This was Hogarth’s first satirical print. Like several  Dutch satires of the financial bubble that had reached London a few months  earlier, The South Sea Scheme satirizes the unfolding of the catastrophic joint- stock crash of 1720. In one spot a rabbi, a Catholic priest, and a Protestant min- ister gamble with dice, unconcerned about the misery of their respective flocks.  Elsewhere, investors ride a whirligig on wooden horses (wheels of fortune were  commonly used at this time as symbols of wagering). Two foxes fight atop a monu- ment. At the edge of this grim-faced scene, bloodthirsty-looking hybrids menace.  One of these is hooded and wields a sword while overseeing the public flogging of  a female Honesty. Another further threatens the proceedings, clutching a scythe  like the Angel of Death. An inscription at the bottom of the print informs us that  Honesty is being punished by Villainy and broken on a wheel by Self-Interest.  • Bookplate for George Lambart (1725). This contains images of a satyr and a sagit- tary (or centaur). On centaurs Hogarth (1753/1997) wrote, “The antique centaur  </page> <page sequence="13">  Beirne, Hogarth’s Animals 145 hath a savage greatness as well as beauty” (p. 38). It seems unlikely that these two  hybrids signified anything other than Lambart’s entrepreneurial identity. That  is, Hogarth’s “realist” engraved image was of the same sort as those fashioned  by mint and metal workers who labored on the London silver hallmarks, whose  images of lions were rampant on Dutch-incised brasses, especially in London and  East Anglia, and whose knights in armor atop lions (brave Crusaders) or lambs  (stay-at-home cowards) appeared on the floors of Anglican churches. Later in life,  Hogarth (1753/1955) complained of his apprenticeship in engraving that all he  made in this trade were “monsters of Heraldry” (p. 201).  • Paulet Bookplate (date unknown). Similar in intent and execution to the previ- ously described item, George Lambart, this bookplate contains a griffin. On grif- fins, Hogarth (1753/1997) wrote, “The griffin, a modern hieroglyphic, signifying  strength and swiftness, united in the two noble forms of the lion and the eagle, is  a grand object” (p. 38).  • Frontispiece to Hudibras (1726). This homage to Butler’s poem employs three  satyrs, a faun, and bear-human soldiers variously to unmask hypocrisy and igno- rance.  • The Beggar’s Opera (1728). Hogarth’s burlesque painting satirizes the raucous  bigotry that accompanied the performance of John Gay’s wild play of the same  name. Hogarth’s stage scenery includes a flying angel and fox- and steer-headed  gentlemen who amble with mouse- and cat-headed women.  • Analysis of Beauty plate 1 (1753/1997). The numerous agendas in this semi-humor- ous engraving of statuary production include a naked Venus (Nature) flanked by a  sphinx and Silenus the satyr. On sphinxes and sirens Hogarth (1753/1997) wrote,  “[They] have been admired and accounted ornamental in all ages. The former  represents strength and beauty join’d; the latter, beauty and swiftness, in pleasing  and graceful forms” (p. 38). He continued, “These may be said to be monsters, it’s  true, but then they convey such noble ideas, and have such elegance in their forms  as greatly compensates for their being unnaturally join’d together” (p. 38).  • Enthusiasm Delineated (1761). Here a ranting Methodist minister, Rev. George  Whitefield, manipulates the strings of hybrids-as-puppets. As the minister’s  hairpiece escapes him, his Roman Catholic tonsure protrudes. He is identified as  the famous evangelical preacher Whitefield—who, rumor had it, had siphoned off  for his own use large sums of money raised through his evangelical activities—by  Hogarth’s depiction of a dog nearby wearing the name “Whitfield” on his collar (a  dog-collar criminal, perhaps?). Through a chapel window, an astonished Islamic  cleric peers in at the minister and his congregation.  • Cuniculari, or the Wise Men of Godliman in Constitution (1726), reworked  in Credulity, Superstitition, and Fanaticism; A Medley (1762). Here Hogarth  satirizes the ignorance and superstition of learned medical doctors. To a gullible  public they had pronounced that, during a spell of convulsive paroxysms, the poor  and uneducated Mary Toft of Godalming, Surrey, had given birth to rabbits. A  prime mover in this gender/class/hybrid/monstrosity fiasco was the royal surgeon,  Nathaniel St. André. Having been ridiculed by Hogarth and others, St. André was  embarrassed into confessing that he had “misapprehended . . . the extraordinary  </page> <page sequence="14"> 146 Journal of Animal Ethics, 3 (2013) Delivery of Rabbits, performed by Mr. Howard, Surgeon” (Daily Journal, De- cember 9, 1726; see also Hogarth’s The Discovery, 1743, in which an intersecting  focus of gender, social class, and race is substituted for Cuniculari’s concern with  gender, social class, and science). ANIMALS AS EDIBLES Newly slaughtered and cooked or salted animals or pieces of animals appear frequently  in Hogarth’s art. Among them are sides of cattle, legs of lamb, jellied eels, grilled fishes,  flesh from pigs, and indeterminate species hidden in pies and stews or hooked and hanging  outside butchers’ shops and fish markets or else, if “spoiled,” transformed into German  sausages, polonies, saveloys, and black puddings.  Hogarth’s art records how a bounty of edible animals tended to signify prosperity  and embourgeoisement (e.g., the fruits of hard work in Beer Street, 1751; compare this  with the starving humans and animals in Gin Lane, 1751, and the three elderly hawkers  whose faces resemble their fishes for sale in The Gate of Calais, 1748). On one occasion,  in Sancho’s Feast (ca. 1725), possibly in a reference to the myth of Tantalus, Hogarth  depicts himself as the plebeian Sancho deluded into thinking he is King of Barataria— even though he is “starved in the midst of Plenty” by his subjects and surrounded by  untouched dishes of what appear to be roasted rabbit and chicken (and see Paulson, 1971,  pp. 165–166). Sometimes the serving of animal edibles is seen as a reward for military  success (see the celebratory food in Captain Lord George Graham in His Cabin, 1745).  Occasionally, Hogarth’s portrayal of dead edible animals was satirical—against gluttony  and corruption in Lord Mayor’s Banquet (1761), for example, and against perceived  French chauvinism in The Gate of Calais.  Fishes of all sorts, Hogarth would have seen on display in London’s open-air fish  market, situated since 1700 at Billingsgate on the banks of a small Thames inlet. Fishes  and crustaceans were not often portrayed by Hogarth, though they are present, perhaps  to be eaten, perhaps to be used as trophies, in The Fishing Party (ca. 1730). Here he  portrays a middle-class family enjoying recreational fishing, probably on an upriver  stretch of the Thames. They are also implicit in other works. Among these, famously,  is the cockney Shrimp Girl (ca. 1745). Edible fish are also implicit in the fishmongers’  cauldron in The Gate of Calais (1748), in the recreational activities of the two rod- and-lure fishermen in Satire of False Perspective (1754), and in a drawing of the rural  riverside overlooking Upnor Castle, Kent, with several fishing boats and ferries in the  background (ca. 1735).  What did Hogarth himself regard as edible? Clearly, he was not a vegetarian—a  practice that in his day was viewed as eccentric. Indeed, he and some friends once  described their hearty downing of two meals during a peregrination in Kent: one a  breakfast of eggs, bacon, lobster, shrimp, and cockles, the other a dinner of “soles  and flounders with crab sauce, roasted and stuffed calfs’s heart, fried liver and other  appurtenances minced, a leg of mutton roasted, and some green pease” (Hogarth,  </page> <page sequence="15">  Beirne, Hogarth’s Animals 147 1732/1952, p. 5). Hogarth’s very last meal was apparently one pound of beefsteak  (Uglow, 1997, p. 697). ANIMALS APPOINTED AS COMPANIONS (“PETS”) By the late 17th century, the cultivation of companionship with animals had begun to  take hold among the upper echelons of British society. The expanding objects of these  practices included dogs especially, but also exotic newfound species such as monkeys  and parrots from the New World and from Africa. By the early 1700s British royalty  had installed spaniels and pugs as their chosen lapdogs. The aristocracy and landed  gentry soon followed suit, cultivating dogs of increasingly rarified breeds. By midcen- tury numerous middle-class families had appointed animals to some position within the  triangle of servant, objet d’art, and status symbol as well. These and other developments  in the evolving litany of “petting” practices Hogarth depicted in his art, particularly  in family portraits. Besides requests by art connoisseurs, among the undertakings he  also so vehemently despised must have been commissions for family portraits by the  landed gentry on whom he and his family seemed at times so thoroughly to depend.  Family portraiture, which included companion animals, was not therefore what Hogarth  most relished doing. But for much of his career it was the genre that provided him  with the most consistent commissions and income, concerned and largely successful  businessman that he was.  As “pets,” animals are variously depicted by Hogarth, some straightforwardly, some  not. Dogs are frequently seen in Hogarth’s portraits of eminent persons and of fam- ily life in townhouses and country mansions, inside and out. Here they are given two  roles. In the one they are in a posed, seemingly calm and self-confident stance near the  center of attention. In the other, in contrast to well-dressed and well-behaved adults  who are positioned very formally amid elegant furniture and furnishings, they appear  as skirmishing or scavenging creatures who, like playful children, cause humans noisy,  if minor, disturbance. The Cholmondeley Family (1732) portrait, for example, has the  family dog cowering in a corner and looking away from his owners. Here, the dog oper- ates as a sign of unchecked disorder, seemingly in a situation of parity with two of the  male children, who are about to kick over some leather-bound books from a side table.  Like they do in some of Hogarth’s other pictures, children and dogs operate as signs of  commotion and impending disorder (see also the dog beneath an overturned table in  A Children’s Party, ca. 1730).  Only rarely are cats to be seen in Hogarth’s portraiture. Their absence seems puzzling,  at least at first glance. But though in this period humans’ sentimental attachment to cats  was still less than it was to dogs, they are not in Hogarth’s portraits, I assume, because of  their secret and longstanding associations with the devil and because of their reputed use  as witches’ familiars (but see Gray, 1747/1903; Smart, 1954; and Ennis, 2000). Who would  commission such a devilish animal to be seen for posterity at play with one’s family?10 One  exception is The Graham Children (1742; see also A Harlot’s Progress, 1732, plate 3; and  </page> <page sequence="16"> 148 Journal of Animal Ethics, 3 (2013) Strolling Actresses Dressing in a Barn, 1737), the family portrait of the four children of the  apothecary to Chelsea’s Royal Hospital. In this picture Hogarth has a boy turning a hand  organ, on the side of which there is a picture of Orpheus charming the beasts. The starving  cat ravenously eyes a songbird in a gilded cage (see, especially, Paulson, 1993; Raber, 2008,  pp. 104–105, 112 n. 35), and the boy is gleefully transfixed by this predatory drama.  In his portraiture Hogarth at times deploys animals as bearers of territorial instincts. At  the margins of the otherwise tranquil portrait The Strode Family (ca. 1738), for example,  the family’s dog seems to sense territorial invasion and nervously eyes Hogarth’s dog,  Trump. Each warily returns the other’s gaze. But why is Trump here in the first place? It is  as if Hogarth has put himself in the picture, vicariously through Trump. Natural animosity  is suggested, too, in The Industrious ’Prentice a Favourite and Entrusted by His Master  (1747, Industry and Idleness, plate 4), where a cat and a dog face off, each defending his  or her respective domain, the cat with an arched back and the dog growling.  A similar scenario plays out aboard HMS Nottingham in the brightly colored Captain  Lord George Graham in His Cabin (1745). The scene aboard this 60-gun ship of the line  exudes relaxed jollity. The one person who looks out at the audience, the steward, standing  at left, is about to spill gravy down the back of the man sitting at the table with Graham.  Possibly the scene is about money, and the unknown man is the ship’s purser, informing  Graham of his prize after the capture of several French privateers in an engagement off  Ostende. In the lower left margin Captain Graham’s dog is depicted as singing while at  the same time cautiously eying and being eyed by a visitor/intruder, Hogarth’s own be- wigged pug, Trump. One wonders why Hogarth placed Trump in the picture. One must  ponder, too, the able seamen’s reaction to the propriety and stench of canine excrement  in the cramped quarters of a man-o’-war.  There are other animals who entered Hogarth’s life and for whom he obviously felt  great personal affection. A merger of “pet” and person, his wife Jane he chose to portray  with a lamb on her lap (Jane Hogarth, ca. 1740)—a masculinist, if sweet, declaration that  Jane was his own dear lamb and that she, like a foundling, needed his protection and  care. Again, a note on the back of his painting Mr. Wood’s Dog Vulcan (ca. 1735) records  that Vulcan attracted Hogarth’s attention by his nightly journeys carrying a lantern in his  mouth to light the way home for his master, Thomas Wood, Hogarth’s friend (Gowling,  1971, p. 43). In the warm portrait of his patron, Miss Mary Edwards (1742), her dog  companion occupies a large space on the canvas, from which we can probably infer both  her devotion to her dog and also Hogarth’s (see Uglow, 1997, pp. 670–682).  His pug, Trump, Hogarth inserted in both commissioned portraits and self-portraits.  For a decade or so Trump was Hogarth’s inseparable companion. As such, besides his  presence in The Strode Family (ca. 1738) and Captain Lord George Graham (1745),  Trump also appears in Hogarth: The Painter and His Pug (1745), in Gulielmus Hogarth  (1747), and posthumously in The Bruiser (1763), where he came back to haunt his mas- ter’s political enemies. This caused hostile critics to deride Hogarth as “Painter-Pug”  or “Pugg,” as Paul Sandby did, for example, in his Puggs Graces of 1754. Nowhere is  Hogarth’s affection for dogs more on show than in his best-known self-portrait, the oil  </page> <page sequence="17">  Beirne, Hogarth’s Animals 149 painting Hogarth: The Painter and His Pug (1745). Here, with great sympathy and no  little comedy, Hogarth portrays the self-detected resemblance between himself and  Trump—especially in the similarity of their eyes, their snub noses, and their short, squat  torsos, Hogarth being five feet or less in height and Trump rising to perhaps fifteen inches  at the shoulder, both with much-in-little and packing-a-punch personalities. Note, too,  how brazenly Hogarth depicts himself as the enlightened artist that he rightly knew he  Figure 3.

ANIMALS AS SIGNS OF SATIRE Dogs, cats, monkeys, and owls were most often used as signs of Hogarth’s satiric intent.  As such, these animals entered the picture either as emblems of human chaos, oppres- sion, and stupidity or, more rarely, as their victims, impending or actual. In general, dogs  represent our unrepressed instincts. They are honest and have nothing to hide. When  they are household members, they frequently create disorder, like small children. Cats  are perennial outsiders, difficult to fathom, independent. Monkeys ape. Owls look down  on human chaos and stupidity (see Paulson, 1979, chapter 5; Paulson, 1993, p. 117; and  Hallett, 1999, p. 189). One must recall Hogarth’s visits to the Bartholomew and Southwark  fairs and his lifelong interest in staged burlesque to understand his interpretation in The  Analysis of a monkey “whose figure, as well as most of his actions, is also very comical; and  he becomes more so when a coat is put upon him, as he then becomes a greater burlesque  on the man” (Hogarth, 1753/1997, p. 37). A rough shock dog: “something extremely odd  and comical. The ideas here connected are the inelegant and inanimate figure of a thrum,  or muff, and that of a sensible, friendly animal; which is as much a burlesque of the dog,  as the monkey when his coat is on, of the man” (Hogarth, 1753/1997, p. 37). And, he  continued, “I have seen a dutch dog walking upon his hind legs with a tyed periwig on  set people of the utmost gravity a laughing and never fail” (Hogarth, 1753/1997, p. 125;  see Southwark Fair, 1733, in which there is a dog, adorned with a cocked hat and sword,  who perches on his rear legs). Of owls, he said, “Under their aukward forms, they seem  to be gravely musing and meditating, as if they had the sense of human beings” (Hogarth,  1753/1997, pp. 37–38).  Monkeys appear in a handful of Hogarth’s pictorial satires. In Quarrel With Her Pro- tector (1732, A Harlot’s Progress, plate 2; see also Paulson, 1975, pp. 61–62), for example,  a would-be preening but actually frightened chimpanzee is adorned in a miniature of  harlot Moll’s dress. She signals distress between her mistress and a merchant. The distress  is also evident in the chaos of an overturned table, some broken pottery, and Moll’s raised  dress. (Moll had been doomed from the outset by Hogarth, symbolically evident as she  arrived in London with a dead goose (1732, A Harlot’s Progress, plate 1.) In Southwark  Fair (1733), amid several burlesques and next to a military-looking dog, a monkey atop a  flagpole imitates an acting troupe whose members march with a banner declaring “Liberty  and Property.” Again, in Taste in High Life; or Taste à la Mode (1742), a monkey with a  magnifying glass, bagwig, solitaire, laced hat, and ruffles is intended as a parody of the  ridiculous haute couture of high society. She or he is reading a French-based, scrolled  menu: cocks’ combs, ducks’ tongues, rabbits’ ears, fricassée of snails, and grande d’oeufs  beurre (Trussler, 1833, p. 38). In Frontispiece: The Artists’ Catalogue (1761), while Brit- tania nourishes healthy native art, a winking monkey waters the near-dead “exoticks” of  continental painting. </page> <page sequence="19">  Beirne, Hogarth’s Animals 151  Cats tend to appear with some drama in Hogarth’s satire. Consider the cats in his per- plexing Strolling Actresses Dressing in a Barn (1737; see also A Harlot’s Progress, 1732,  plate 3). In this engraving Hogarth attacks the censorious Licensing Act (1737), which  suppressed all English theaters save for the Theatres Royal in Drury Lane and Covent  Garden. Of all Hogarth’s group scenes, it is the only one where all the characters are female.  Perhaps there is some pre-feminist leaning here (Kiaer, 2001). However, Strolling Actresses  is also a voyeuristic survey of a touring troupe of actresses dressing and undressing prior  to their next performance in a barn. Chickens and doves are perched in inappropriate  places. Two kittens play with an orb and some yarn, mimicking the actresses at work in  their play. In the corner one woman holds down a terrified cat while another, armed with  scissors, amputates his tail, allowing the blood to collect in an oyster shell—needed, it was  thought, to ward off aches and pains from a bad fall. The whole scenario is replete with a  Peeping Tom surveying the plot through a hole in the roof.  Hogarth’s most iconic use of a dog occurs in The Bruiser (1763). A reworked version  of his 1745 self-portrait, The Bruiser marks the high point of his angry political and artistic  differences with the curate and satirist Charles Churchill—“that toadeater” (Hogarth,  1753/1955, p. 221)—and his inexplicable personal confrontation with his friend John  Wilkes (see also his work of a year earlier, where a young boy pees on an effigy of Wilkes  standing in the stocks, in Times II, 1762). In The Bruiser Hogarth imposed something of  his own face on Trump’s pug body. Now the angry artist has become the feuding Bruiser,  who urinates contemptuously on the title page of Churchill’s bitter poem Epistle to Hog- arth. Churchill is depicted as a drunken performing bear wearing a lacerated clerical  collar. In one paw he carries an overflowing pot of porter and in the other wields a club  of deceitful satire. In a picture within this picture Hogarth becomes an animal trainer,  whipping the dancing bear (Churchill) and a monkey (Wilkes) so that they toe his line.  In depicting Trump urinating on Churchill in The Bruiser, Hogarth borrows from an  already existing satiric tradition that used dogs to give voice to political interests. This  tendency is prominently found in John Gay’s dog Shock, for example, and Pope’s Bounce.  The latter famously scorned the servile habits of effete and foppish dogs, especially “the  Pranks of Dogs at Court” (Braunschneider, 2006; Ellis, 2007; Brown, 2010, chapter  3). This depiction of Trump urinating is but one example of a sign of disturbance that  Hogarth uses many times. Quite aside from “Satan’s Piss” being the alcohol so famously  condemned in Gin Lane (1751), the meaning of urination in Hogarth’s art varied from  impending danger and doom to comedy and satire (e.g., see also the man relieving himself  against a wall in Hudibras and the Skimmington, 1726).  The unrestrained passage of urine—and more—mightily exacerbated London’s hub- bub and filth. At a time when sewage disposal was not yet regulated, waste matter was  discharged from chamber pots forthwith to London’s streets. Hogarth depicts this house- hold chore, typically performed by women, in “Noon” (Hogarth, 1736, Four Times of  the Day, plate 4; see also Night). Here we see a woman emptying a chamber pot onto  unsuspecting night revelers below (and see the overflowing chamber pot in Midnight  Modern Conversation, 1733). Needless to say, not all urination is actively on display in  </page> <page sequence="20"> 152 Journal of Animal Ethics, 3 (2013) Figure 4. The Bruiser (William Hogarth, 1763). Hogarth’s art. It was not displayed when it happened in the undergarments of those un- fortunates hanged at Tyburn, for example, or on London streets by terrified sheep and  cattle driven to Smithfield market for sale and slaughter.  Besides Trump in The Bruiser, there are other animals who, in the interests of satire,  Hogarth portrays urinating. For example, in his drawing The Punishment Inflicted on  </page> <page sequence="21">  Beirne, Hogarth’s Animals 153 Lemuel Gulliver (1726), while a giant rat devours a baby, a Lilliputian voices his displea- sure by urinating on Gulliver’s hat. Probably as an expression of his ire at Parliament’s  enactment of the anti-theatrical Licensing Act (1737), Hogarth has a monkey in a cloak  urinate into a hero’s helmet in Strolling Actresses Dressing in a Barn (1737). Consider  also Hogarth’s anti-corruption Chairing the Member (ca. 1755, An Election, plate 4), in  which an armed monkey, aping the mob’s unruliness, sits menacingly atop the shoulders  of a muzzled bear, while a sow and her piglets jump from a bridge into the river below— frantically trying to escape the crazed celebrations after a corrupt parliamentary election  in Oxfordshire. Off to the side, a boy displays what he thinks of the eruptions, urinating  on the monkey.  On one occasion Hogarth depicts animals being drenched with urine. This occurs in  one of his last works, the satirical Frontis-piss (1763). Here he lampoons John Hutchin- son’s anti-rationalist idea that gravity is a spiritual force that derives its power not from  matter but from God’s action as described in the biblical Genesis. Hogarth ridicules  Hutchinson by having a black-hatted witch sit astride the moon as she showers a colony  of rats with her urine.  Smutty motifs such as these were standard fare in low Dutch genre pictures. Hogarth’s  genius was to aim them at all social strata: kings’ naked bottoms and penises, a queen and  a prime minister assisting with a satyr’s enema, common women emptying chamber pots,  and men and boys and animals peeing in public. Remarkably, his depiction of humans  and animals urinating is simply one aspect of his larger interest in portraying the use of  genitalia to further a satiric point. With varying degrees of visibility, Hogarth employs  both male and female genitalia, human and animal, in order to satirize some aspect of  human morality that he finds objectionable. In The South Sea Scheme (1721), for example,  investors ride a whirligig on phallus-like horses. Perhaps this was Hogarth’s way of saying  that, by riding the bubble, investors had all been screwed by their own greediness. In  The Sleeping Congregation (1736), atop the wall of a church there is a lion rampant with  a large erection. He and it mirror the lascivious parson who peers down the bosom of a  pious female member of the congregation (see Krysmanski, 2010, pp. 138–139).  In The Harlot Apprehended (1732, A Harlot’s Progress, plate 3), Hogarth is quite  explicit in his use of animals’ genitalia for commenting on human sexuality. In this episode  we see Mary Hackabout, the harlot, about to be captured by anti-prostitution campaigner  Justice John Gonson. Having just entered Moll’s tatty bedchamber, however, Gonson stops  in his tracks. Surprised at his lust for her, it is instead he who is arrested. Gazing at her  voluptuous body, he touches his pursed lips with the fingers of one hand, in surprise, and  with those of the other he reaches for his crotch. In the foreground the harlot’s cat—she  has on a collar—raises up her rear end, presenting herself as ready to be mounted. (This  should be compared with Hogarth’s depiction of a surprised cat’s differently upturned  tail in Hudibras and Sidrophel, 1726.)  In other works Hogarth’s satiric use of animals’ private parts is less explicit, but no  less important to the detection of his hidden and not-so-hidden messages. In the couplet  Before and After (1730), for example, Before has her mistress’s companion dog pawing in  </page> <page sequence="22"> 154 Journal of Animal Ethics, 3 (2013) alarm at the hem of her dress—as she is about to be ravished by a rake. In After the dog  is fast asleep, an exhausted reflection of her and his sexual activity. In A Rake’s Progress  (1735, plate 5) the rake, Tom Rakewell, betters his prospects by marrying a nameless,  one-eyed elderly woman, while in a corner a female dog either refuses or else shows  supreme indifference to the amorous intentions of a male dog. Relatedly, in The Settle- ment (1743, Marriage à la Mode, plate 1), two dogs are chained together, symbolizing the  nature of the marital union a young couple’s parents are about to impose on them. The  groom, Viscount Squanderfield, is attended to by his lawyer, Silver-tongue. The bride  is unnamed. She is alone. In Early in the Morning (1743, Marriage à la Mode, plate 2),  the couple has had separate evening entertainment—for her, cards and perhaps an in- terrupted lover; for him a debauched night out on the town, the broken tip of his saber  suggesting the resultant state of his manhood. At the side of the exhausted Viscount, the  household’s dog either scoffs at or sniffs the night’s aromas lurking in her master’s garb.  Smutty animal motifs can be found in other places in Hogarth’s works. In The Punish- ment of Lemuel Gulliver (1726), for example, the focus is Gulliver’s large bottom—that  is, the rear end of William Pitt the Elder (who did have a large one)—naked and abused  for his irreligion with a huge clyster (i.e., an enema). A large rat bites a prostrate Lillipu- tian. It is a satire on gullibility (Uglow, 1997, pp. 117–118). A decade later, in a protest at  government censorship of the stage, Hogarth’s The Festival of the Golden Rump (1737)  pictures George II as a satyr in the act of receiving corrective treatment—an enema  (he had been recently diagnosed with a fistula in his anus)—administered by the prime  minister, Robert Walpole, and assisted by Queen Caroline. Satyr satire!11 ANIMAL IT-NARRATIVES A few of Hogarth’s animals are kin to what literary critics and cultural theorists have  identified as “its” in 18th-century “it-narratives.” The common thread of the structure  of it-narratives is the telling of the lives of various circulating objects, among which were  pins, hackney-coaches, corkscrews, coins, and waistcoats. Although each unfolding life  had its own fictive prose and embroidery, all had a good yarn to tell to enthralled audi- ences (Blackwell, 2007; Lamb, 2011; Keenleyside, 2012). “It” stories were told some- times exclusively by the author, sometimes by the “it,” and sometimes by an alternating  combination of both. Often the modus operandi of it-narratives was a satirical attack  against those who had acquired temporary ownership of the circulating “it”—cruel or  neglectful owners, for example, or the ne’er-do-wells and down-and-outs who exchanged  objects for cash in pawnshops. It-narratives on occasion allowed their narrators to offer  satirical comments on an undesired social practice—gambling, for example, or theft, gin  drinking, and prostitution.  Animals were sometimes the focus of it-narratives. “Animal it-narratives,” for want  of a better term, were based on stories told by or about bees, birds, cats, dogs, donkeys,  fleas, lice, mice, pigs, and ponies. Of these the most popular and reputedly the first was  Pompey the Little (Coventry, 1751/1974). Published in the same month as Hogarth’s Four  </page> <page sequence="23">  Beirne, Hogarth’s Animals 155 Stages of Cruelty, Pompey is the story of a dog’s life, some of whose chapters are told by  Coventry masquerading as Pompey. “Pompey’s narrative” allows Coventry to condemn  unsavory “pet” owners and a variety of cruelties visited on dogs. In another such story,  The Life and Adventures of a Cat (Anonymous, 1760), Tom, a cat from the poor London  parish of St. Giles, joins a traveling troupe of actors. At fairs and in other venues Tom  performs so well on the wire, at rope dancing, and with fortune-telling that he is nick- named “Garrick”—after the great actor (see Hogarth’s David Garrick as Richard III,  1757; and David Garrick With His Wife Eva-Maria Veigel, 1758).  Anthropocentric and anthropomorphic though they were, the narrative structure of  these animal it-narratives reflected the yearnings of a much broader pro-animal sensibility  in 18th-century England. Indeed, it was precisely at the unstable intersection of concepts  of animality and humanness that they labored (Boehrer, 2002; Blackwell, 2007; Lamb,  2011). The logic of the emerging capitalist marketplace dictated that the authors of animal  it-narratives had to rely on consumers of their products holding the belief—or wanting  to believe—that lice, cats, pigs, and other species had the ability to tell stories. (This was  surely no more odd than the medieval and early modern belief that offending animals  who committed crimes should be prosecuted and punished for them—see Beirne, 2011.)  That consumers were capable of holding this very belief surely instantiates the gradual  weakening in the bonds of the chain of being ushered in by Newtonian mechanics, by  scientific observation, and by the new biological taxonomies of the mid-17th century.  Although it is well established that discursive innovations in literature and philoso- phy encouraged and were encouraged by pro-animal sentiments, far less well known in  this regard is that the graphic arts also contributed to this aspect of the “animal turn.”  Indeed, Pompey the Little and The Life and Adventures of a Cat both beckon us to the  Bartholomew fair, to Smithfield, and to St. Giles—to (re)turn, in other words, to Hogarth’s  own doorstep.  Though each requires a certain level of viewer participation and reconstructive activity,  several of Hogarth’s pictures amount to animal it-narratives in the making. For example,  Hogarth’s dispersed depictions of Trump can with some effort be pieced together and  reconstituted as Trump’s Life and Adventures. To be written by a combination of Hogarth  and Hogarth-for-Trump, the early chapters in this erstwhile biography might credibly  address the nature and circumstances of Trump’s birth, his parents and siblings, and  Hogarth’s acquisition of him and his appointment as the artist’s companion. In The Art- ist and His Pug (1745), in which Trump the real animal is pictured by Hogarth, Trump  looks out as if to say to us viewers, “Imagine my life with my master, how similar we are  and well suited! How loyal we are to each other, how inseparable!” Later chapters could  take Trump, Hogarth, and us readers, breathless, on a walking tour of the terrain between  Hogarth’s houses in urban Leicester Fields and rural Chiswick. Questions multiply. When  he traveled in a horse and carriage with Hogarth for the painting of The Strode Family  (ca. 1738), did Trump stand on his hind legs, resting on his paws while he pushed out his  snout the better to breathe in the muddy London street scenes? It is also recorded that  Trump traveled with Hogarth when the artist painted Captain Lord George Graham in  </page> <page sequence="24"> 156 Journal of Animal Ethics, 3 (2013) His Cabin (1745). What adventures did Trump have as he was ferried from shore to ship  and back? Was he nervous aboard ship? Was a fight in the offing between Trump and  Graham’s dog? Was Trump laid to rest in the garden at Chiswick house?  Consider, also, Hogarth’s First Stage of Cruelty (1751). Allegedly inspired by Jacques  Callot’s gruesome Temptation of St. Anthony (ca. 1630), it is a picture of extraordinary  violence wrought by a group of poor young males on cats, dogs, gamecocks, and a bird.  The emphasis of the picture is as much or more on the human victimizers as on the as- saulted animals. Moreover, the text beneath the picture advises, “while various Scenes of  sportive Woe, The Infant Race employ, And tortur’d Victims bleeding shew, The Tyrant  in the Boy.” Set in an alleyway in St. Giles, the center of the action is the tussle between  the villainous Tom Nero and a dog whom he is about to sodomize with a metal arrow.  Of the several animals in the picture she is the only one whose body language plainly  reflects her terror and pain.  The more one looks at this desperate scene, the more the backstage features of Hogarth’s  narrative beg to be explored. Was the dog victimized actually one of St. Giles’s numerous  strays? If so, how did she manage to survive a life on the streets? How did the group of  young males apprehend her? Perhaps she and they were in competition for scraps of food,  like the apprentices and Madame’s cats in the Parisian 1730s (Darnton, 1999). Did she live  to tell the tale? However these questions are answered, with their addition to Hogarth’s  picture they form an evolving cartoon or, to put it another way, an animal it-narrative.  Part of the story is narrated by Hogarth, part by the dog, and—with a twist for an animal  it-narrative—part ever after by the questioning and inquiring audience. One picture, so  to speak, tells a thousand words. Moreover, the narration of this unfortunate dog’s story  continues with her reappearance in Hogarth’s fourth stage of cruelty, Cruelty’s Reward. In  this picture Hogarth depicts the dog, if not quite exacting delicious revenge, then at least  having a meal of boiled human flesh and bones. How did she survive Nero’s brutal sexual  assault? How did she travel from St. Giles to the amphitheater of the College of Surgeons?  What will happen to her in the next episode? HOGARTH’S NO-SHOW: “GAME” AND THE GAME LAWS Despite the variety and frequency with which animals appear in his art, Hogarth chose  to ignore some species altogether. This calculation cannot pass without comment. True,  there are a few dead fishes for sale in his pictures of London life. Elsewhere, families are  pictured angling on the tranquil upstream banks of the Thames. A dozen rabbits emerge  from Mary Toft’s skirt. There are wall-mounted antlers in A Harlot’s Progress (1732, plate  2). But there is not even a hint of other so-called game animals in Hogarth’s art. There  are no representations of deer, hares, moor fowl, partridges, or pheasants. None! Nor  are there any images of gamekeepers and outraged country gentlemen who give chase  to poachers and who then have them sent for trial and possible execution. Nowhere.  This is a shocking no-show at a time when the Game Laws were the intense focus of the  struggle between an absolute right to property insisted on by the monarchy and the landed  </page> <page sequence="25">  Beirne, Hogarth’s Animals 157 gentry, on the one hand, and the customary rights to game, timber, and turf claimed by  the forest-dwelling peasantry on the other (Hay, 1975; Thompson, 1975; on the contested  content of “game,” see Munche, 1981, pp. 3, 22–23, 169). During Hogarth’s lifetime roughly  30 statutes punished the poaching of deer, pheasants, partridges, rabbits, and fishes. The  draconian Black Act (1723) made it a capital offense without benefit of clergy to be armed and with faces blackened to unlawfully hunt, wound, kill, destroy or steal any  red or fallow deer, to rob any warren of conies and rabbits and hares . . . or to fish illegally  or to maim cattle [and other domesticated animals] in public parks or private property. Originally enacted to cover only Hampshire and Berkshire, the Black Act soon effectively  applied to all royal parks and eventually to all private property.  Why did Hogarth not picture animals who were hunted? Why did he altogether  ignore this coveted preserve of the monarchy and landed aristocracy—he, the fearless  iconoclast? It is a puzzle. Here is Alexander Pope (1713) railing against pheasant hunting  in the royal Windsor forest: See! from the brake the whirring pheasant springs And mounts exulting on triumphant wings. Short is his joy; he feels the fiery wound, Flutters in blood and panting beats the ground. (lines 111–114)  Pope’s eloquent verse undoubtedly would have been read by Hogarth (see also Pope,  1722/1993, p. 262, on deer hunting). He chose to ignore it. So, too, he ignored Margaret  Cavendish’s (1666/2002) pained poetry about the hunting and slaughter of deer and hares.  His calculation leaves a deafening silence. Hogarth has no scenes depicting the ritualized  slaughter of game by the Hanoverian Georges and their elites. He has no mocking satire  or moralizing verse attending the royal expenditures on the forests—obscenely plump  sums just ripe for a satiric barb at idleness without industry. Yet Hogarth, the court’s  sergeant-painter, in need of the stipend, fawning, never pictured this site of everyday  class conflict. This was not because, a lifelong city dweller, he never visited rural settings.  He did. Richmond Park and Windsor forest were nearby, as were the rural estates of  those whose portraits he often painted. Nor can it be said that he was covertly opposed  to hunting. He wasn’t. “Hunting, fishing and fowling are pleasurable pursuits . . . even  animals have a delight in pursuing and sometimes suffer their prey to escape for the  pleasure of chasing it again” (Hogarth, 1753/1997, p. 124).  The condemnation of hunting as animal cruelty was by no means an uncommon  sentiment in 18th-century England. Indeed, inspired by Montaigne’s widely read stric- tures against it, hunting had been deemed wrongful by the occasional eccentric as far  back as the late 16th century. In philosophy, ethics, religion, poetry, and literature many  contemporary authors often based that sentiment not on the argument that hunting and  other cruelties were wrong in themselves but on the argument that they reduced or  destroyed human compassion and eventually led one human to abuse another. Among  the notables who held this position in Hogarth’s time were Locke, Pope, and Kant. The  </page> <page sequence="26"> 158 Journal of Animal Ethics, 3 (2013) last, in particular, praised Hogarth’s Four Stages of Cruelty as a good illustration of why  cruelty to animals is wrong. Kant believed animal cruelty wrongful not because it is a  wrong in itself but chiefly because it extinguishes our kindly and humane qualities and  thereby leads us to abuse our fellow humans. “This provides a good lesson to children,”  Kant pronounced in his Lectures on Ethics: “When we torment animals or let them suffer  distress, we demean ourselves” (quoted in Hogarth, 1753/1997, pp. 212–213).  Though Kant abhorred animal cruelty, he also suggested that because animals are  humans’ instruments, it is acceptable to experiment on them if the experiment is employed  for a good purpose (but not in sport). The Kantian injunction not to mistreat animals was  therefore not a direct duty but an indirect one. Clearly, if our duties to animals are only  indirect ones, then this is because their lives are granted less consideration than ours.  They have less inherent value. In all likelihood, this was also Hogarth’s view. CONCLUSION So many animals of such diverse species had probably never been portrayed by any artist  before Hogarth—on the continent not by Hieronymous Bosch, the Brueghels, Paulus  Potter, or the van Heemskercks and in England not by George Bickham Jr., Jonathan  Richardson, Thomas Bakewell, or Elisha Kirkal.  However, it must be said that the great majority of Hogarth’s pictures are deeply an- thropocentric. Mostly, he inserted animal images into his art just like a gloved puppeteer  at the Bartholomew fair would have manipulated crocodiles and dogs in a Punch and  Judy show. When he wished to identify a certain human relationship as problematic, it  was his imagined animals whom he often had do the satiric pointing. When he depicted  hybrids or animals as edibles or “pets” or signs of satire, human interests always occupied  the discursive center. Nevertheless, in keeping with the new culture of sensibility or  civilizing process, in Hogarth’s animal images lies a small residue of theriophilic narra- tives. Among these are fledgling stories anchored in several depictions of his beloved dog  Trump and of another dog in the first and the fourth stages of The Four Stages of Cruelty  and a horse in the second stage. These few animals were not altogether of the same sort  as the ubiquitous animal “its” over which Blackstone’s Commentaries held sway. But nor  did Hogarth quite envisage them as animal persons. With the advantage of hindsight,  we can see them as existing somewhere in between. Acknowledgments I am most grateful to Lucinda Cole and Raymond J. Michalowski for their generous comments on  an earlier version of this article and to Lauren Hrubowchak for assistance with image assembly. Notes  1. Except for those on The Four Stages of Cruelty, the sparse discussions of Hogarth’s animal  pictures include those by Paulson, who comments briefly on English dogs (Paulson, 1979, pp.  54–56) and who uncovers at some length the meaning of the aggressive-looking cat (Paulson,  </page> <page sequence="27">  Beirne, Hogarth’s Animals 159 1993) represented in Hogarth’s The Graham Children (1747), and Krysmanski (2010, passim),  who exposes the smutty use of animals’ genitalia in Hogarth’s pictures.  2. First established in the early 13th century as the royal menagerie at Woodstock, near Ox- ford, the collection of animals was transferred 50 years later to London and renamed the Tower  Menagerie, ultimately becoming Regent’s Park Zoo in 1835. In his history of the emergence  of the first “fully-fledged animal paintings,” in the 17th-century Netherlands, Wolloch (2006)  credits as one of the chief facilitating agents the growing habit of keeping exotic and domesti- cated animals, which may have led to “the observation of animals by artists and encouraged the  interest in animal painting” (p. 173).  3. In his poem “A Description of a City Shower,” Swift (1710) famously captured the effects  of rain on London streets in the vicinity of Smithfield and southward to the Thames: Now from all parts the swelling kennels flow, And bear their trophies with them as they go: Filth of all hues and odours seem to tell What street they sailed from, by their sight and smell. They, as each torrent drives with rapid force, From Smithfield or St. Pulchre’s shape their course, And in huge confluent joined at Snow Hill Ridge, Fall from the conduit prone to Holborn-Bridge. Sweepings from butchers’ stalls, dung, guts, and blood. Drowned puppies, stinking sprats, all drenched in mud, Dead cats, and turnip-tops, come tumbling down the flood. (p. 277)  4.  By “theriocide” I mean those diverse human actions that contribute to the death of an  animal. Like the killing of other live beings (e.g., genocide, homicide, and femicide), theriocide  may be legal or illegal, intentional or unintentional, socially acceptable or unacceptable. See  further Beirne (2007, p. 63) and Beirne (n.d.).  5. Little is known about James Townley (1714–1778), who likely met Hogarth while teaching  in the London parish of St. Dunstan’s-in-the-East. Eventually headmaster of Merchant Taylors’  school (Vertue, 1780/1828, volume 4, p. 140 n. 1), he is perhaps one of the two gentlemen sit- ting on either side of the caricatured Hogarth in Paul Sandby’s Puggs Graces (1753; see also  Quennell, 1956, p. 176). A stirring scene in Townley’s (1759) boozy farce High Life Below Stairs  occurs when Lovel, a man of fortune, takes bets on whether he can shoot Jack the puss with  two slugs of a pistol through the keyhole of a pantry door (p. 51), just after his servant, Kitty,  realizes that she mistook the cat for a thief. Possibly, this was a satire on Swift’s advice to a cook  in Directions to Servant: “When you have Plenty of Fowl in the Larder, leave the Door open,  in Pity to the poor Cat, if she be a good Mouser” (Swift, 1745, p. 41).  6. Hogarth at least twice dispensed advice for would-be artists. In Satire on False Perspective  (1753) tips for the avoidance of elementary artistic blunders are illustrated through the odd  spatial relationships among meandering sheep, a perched crow, and hunted swans and fishes.  In The Analysis of Beauty (1753) he offered his thoughts on style and aesthetics, illustrated  throughout with observations on the potential uses of particular animal representations in art.  7. Though the evidence is not conclusive, Paulson (1971) suggests that “Hogarth appears to  have been aware of Heemskirk’s Quaker Meeting paintings, at least in their engraved versions  . . . and he was certainly aware of the satiric designs of the younger Heemskirk in the late 1720s”  (p. 29). He adds that a sale of 1806 included the item “Hogarth . . . Portrait of Heemskirk and  Family” (Paulson, 1971, p. 510 n. 28; see also Antal, 1962, p. 166; Haslam, 1996, pp. 264–265). </page> <page sequence="28"> 160 Journal of Animal Ethics, 3 (2013)  8. The admiration was quite mutual. About Hogarth, Swift wrote, How I want thee! humourous Hogarth! Thou, I hear a pleasant rogue art! Were but you and I acquainted, Every monster should be painted. (quoted in Vertue, 1780/1828, volume 4, p. 154)  9. About his indication that “when improper, or incompatible excesses meet, they always ex- cite laughter” (Hogarth, 1753/1997, p. 37), Hogarth instantiated a marginal figure in March to  Finchley. “It is,” he said, a “fat grown face of a man, with an infant’s cap on, and the rest of the  child’s dress stuff’d . . . [this] contrivance I have seen as Bartholomew-fair, and always occasion’d  a roar of laughter” (Hogarth, 1753/1997, p. 37).  10. Thomas Gray’s (1747/1903) poem Ode on the Death of a Favourite, Drowned in a Tub of  Goldfishes clearly displayed how deeply held sentiments could be for cats. In the poem Gray  mourns the death of Walpole’s cat companion. In this case, at least, a cat was indeed the recipi- ent of the chief elements of treatment as a pet: she is named (“Selima”), she is referred to as  Walpole’s “favourite,” her death occasions an emotional outpouring, and afterward her flesh is  not eaten, and her fur is not used for the lining of a hat. For an intense and nowadays famous  description of his sole companion in Bedlam, his revered cat Jeoffry, see Christopher Smart’s  (1954) poem “For I Will Consider My Cat Jeoffry” (composed 1759–1763).  11. Still other animals represented by Hogarth as emblems of satire rather selectively include  the owl in The Innkeeper’s Wife and Daughter Assisting Don Quixote (1742), who looks down on  human chaos and despair (see also an owl in the churchyard surveying the dark murder scene  in Cruelty in Perfection, 1751, third stage), and the cats on a roof in March to Finchley (1750),  who signify a brothel below. Chicks separated from their mother hen signify soldiers departing  for war. Hogarth intended Finchley to be hung in London’s Foundling Hospital (see Paulson,  1992, p. 357), of which he was a governor. The chicks also likely represent poor children await- ing rescue, harsh discipline, and eventual apprenticeships for useful labor. References Anonymous. (1751).
