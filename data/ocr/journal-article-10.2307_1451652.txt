<plain_text><page sequence="1">SURVEY OF RECENT BIBLICAL LITERATURE V. ARCHAEOLOGY 39. There is no strict line of demarcation between Israel's History and Biblical Archaeology, as neither of them can dispense with the other. But while in the preceding section, we investigated the works in which Israel's history is the center of gravity, and archaeology merely supplies its background, this section will deal witn works in which archaeology is the center of discussion, and which must needs include Israel's history as a subject of archaeology. One of the most important works of this kind, truly a standard work on archaeology, the value of which cannot be sufficiently emphasized, is BREASTED'S Ancient Times (A History of the Early World). The name of the author is a household-word in the scholarly world as one of the foremost authorities on Egyptology. Though it was the purpose of the author to make it sufficiently simple to interest and stimulate students of High School age, it is scientific enough to be made use of even by mature scholars. The scope of the work can best be described in the author's own words: "In dealing with each civiliza- tion, a sufficient framework of political organization and of historical events has been laid down; but the bulk of the space has been devoted to the life of man in all its manifestations-society, industry, commerce, art, literature. These things are so presented as to make it clear how one age grows out of another, and how each civilization profits by that which has preceded it." The book is divided into five parts and 103 chapters, and contains also a Bibliography to 30 chapters, besides additional works of reference on the Greek and Hellenistic age, topically arranged. The first part deals with prehistoric man during the Stone Age, the second with Egypt, Bab- ylonian-Assyrian, Medo-Persians, and the Hebrews, the third with the Greeks, the fourth with the Mediterranean World in the Hellenistic Age and the Roman Republic, and the fifth with the Roman empire. It fur- ther contains 276 illustrations and 38 maps, and this elaborate system of a9Ancient Times, A History of the Early World (An Introduction to the Study of An- cient History and the Career of Early Man).

Pp. xx-+742. 199</page><page sequence="2">200 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW maps has been arranged for the purpose of bringing the successive epochs of history before the reader in terms of geography. The underlying principle is the arrangement on the same plate of from two to four maps representing successive historical epochs. Though the story of each great race or nation is presented in period after period, the book pur- poses to present the career of man as a whole, in a connected story of expanding life and civilization from the days of the rudest stone hatchet to the Christian Cathedrals of Europe. The marginal notes, arranged numerically, indicate the subject-matter of each paragraph, and each chapter is followed by questions that the pupil should answer. As a text- book on ancient history we do not think that it has its equal. Though on each page it is crowded with facts, there is nothing dry and pedantic about it. If we may judge from our own impressions, we would say that in reading this book we forget the scientific character of its descriptions, but imagine that we have here the interesting and entertaining exper- iences of a modern traveller in foreign parts. We have described merely the scope of the work, without giving an outline of its contents which is impossible and unnecessary. We may especially refer to the chapter on the history of the Hebrews which is briefly and well delineated, from a modern but also moderate point of view. In concluding this chapter, the author observes: "It (the Old Testament) tells the story of how a rude shepherd folk issued from the wilds of the Arabian desert, to live in Palestine, and to go through ex- periences there which made them the religious teachers of the civilized world. . .One of the most important things that we owe to the Persians was their restoration of the Hebrews to Palestine. The Persians thus saved and aided in transmitting to us the great legacy from Hebrew Life which we have in the Old Testament, and in the life of the Founder of Christianity" (p. 217). It is also his view-pronounced by Professor von Luschan long ago-, that the prominent aquiline nose, still con- sidered to be the mark of a Semite, especially of the Jew, was really a feature belonging to the (non-Semitic) Hittites, who intermarried with the people of Palestine and gave them this type of face (p. 199). 40. A work that also gives the history of the Ancient nations of the Orient, less comprehensive than the preceding work, is HOGARTH'S The Ancient East. However, the period covered by this book does not go beyond 1000 B. C. E., as the author thinks that the two bodies of historic 40The Ancient East. By D. G.

But though not going in his historical presentation beyond a thousand years before the common era, nevertheless in the first chapter he gives a com- prehensive survey of the earlier conditions of the Babylonian empire, and of those of the Hittites and Assyrians, in which he shows good historical judgment and independence of thought. As to Babylonia, he rightly dif- fers from Ed. Meyer's view accepted by many modern scholars, that the Semites were the first to arrive in the Euphrates Valley. He thinks that the Semites brought into this land a religious idea, that for want of a bet- ter term, may be called Super-Monotheism, which consists in a belief, that, however, many tribal and local gods there may be, one paramount deity exists, which is not only singular and indivisible, but dwells in one spot, alone on earth; its dwelling may be changed by a movement of its people en masse, but by nothing less, and it can have no rival in supreme power. If the author's idea is correct, only faint traces of such a belief were left in the Sumero-Akkadian religion. According to the author's opinion, the Semites that came from Arabia swamped South Syria with "Canaanites," and this migration ultimately gave to Egypt the Hyksos, to Assyria its permanent Semitic population and to Sumer and Akkad its First Babylonian Dynasty. The other subjects of this chapter which deal with New Forces in 1000 B.C.E., Asia Minor, Syria, Palestine, and Mesopotamia, are of equal interest. Of special interest is the second chapter, which is devoted to the treat- ment of the East in 800 B.C.E., as it contains some remarks concerning Old Testament history which should be urgently recommended to mod- ern students for consideration. The historical records of the Book of Kings that present North Israel as steeped in idolatry are discredited by modern critics, claiming that these accusations are due to the compiler who looked upon the religious conceptions of North-Israel from a Deu- teronomistic point of view. It is even held that North Israel had a truer conception of Israel's religion than the Southern Kingdom. The author does not seem to think so: "While it is not certain, if the twelve tribes were ever all of one race, it is quite certain that the Northern ones had come to be contaminated very largely with Aramean blood and infected by mid-Syrian influences, which the relations, established and main- tained by David and Solomon with Hamath and Phoenicia, no doubt had accentuated, especially in the territories of Dan and Asher. These tribes and some other Northerners had never seen eye to eye with the Southern tribes in a matter most vital to Semitic societies, religious idea</page><page sequence="4">202 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW and practice. The anthropomorphic Monotheism which the Southern tribes brought up from Arabia, had to contend in Galilee with therio- morphic polytheism, that is the tendency to embody the qualities of the divinity in animal forms . . .These cults gathered force in the congenial neighborhood of Arameans and Phoenicians, till they led to political separation of the North from the South as soon as the long reign of Sol- omon was ended" (pp. 82ff). The author, far from being a conservative scholar, considers this subject from a purely historical point of view. From such a standpoint, the assumption that the Elohistic Document was of North-Israel origin would seem highly improbable. Nor may we conclude from religious practices prevailing in North Israel that the Mosaic Code had not yet existed in South-Israel. There are other numerous references to Jewish history in this book, as the author says of the Jews: "Those subjects of Persia who necessarily share most of our interest with the Greeks" (p. 172). Their treatment is absolutely unbiased, and there is not the least trace of animosity such as we are used to find in not a few books on ancient history. Of high interest is also the last chapter which describes the influence Qf Hellenism on the East and particularly on the Jews. The author has shown him- self a real historian, and his book, may be numbered among the prom- inent works in recent historical studies. 41. Another archaeological work of a wider scope, as a large part of it is devoted to Old Testament history, post-Biblical Judaism, and the back- ground of the New Testament, is GRANT'S The Orient In Bible Times, which contains a concise and clear account of all the available informa- tion concerning the civilizations of the ancient nations with which Israel had come into contact froin its very beginnings to the rise of Christianity. The book is divided into XVI chapters and contains a large number of illustrations and a map. Each chapter is followed by suggestions for study and a book list. Leaving aside his critical views, there is very lit- tle to which one may take exception, as on mooted questions the author expresses himself with due reserve, and inferences more or less probable are not transformed into indubitable facts. Here and there we find some inaccuracies. For instance, he ought not to have sided with Ed. Meyer in seeing a connection between the Hyksos invaders of Egypt, which according to this historian occurred 1680, and the Hittites who overthrew the Hammurabi-Dynasty, which according to the author's chronology must have taken place 240 years earlier about 4tThe Orient in Bible Times.

With regard to the conflict between the Hebrews and the Philistines, it is incorrect to say that the memory of the Philistine struggle was a strong influence with the writers of Genesis. On the contrary, in the narratives of Genesis there is full amity between the Patriarchs and the Philistines, which shows that they date from an earlier period. But on the whole the outline of Biblical history and the descriptions of the prophets' ideas and activity are excellent. The book is both a scientific and a popular work and worthy of commendation. 42. Another archaeological work very useful to the Old Testament stu- dent is MERCER'S Religious and Moral Ideas in Babylonia and Assyria. This untiring and prolific writer possesses an admirable and enviable facility in providing students with scholarly and well-written textbooks. Considering the influence of Babylonian religious conceptions on those of the Early Hebrews, a knowledge of the former for the study of the Old Testament is indispensable. But concise and accurate textbooks on Babylonian-Assyrian religion written in English are rather scarce, and this want has been supplied by the author. The book consists of six chapters, a chronological outline of Babylo- nian and Assyrian history-which however after WEIDNER'S reconstruc- tion of Babylonian chronology (35) is now obsolete-and a selected bibliography. The subjects that are treated in this work are: the ideas of god, man, mediation, future and morality, both in Babylonia and Assyria. There are some points on which one may differ. The statement that Assyria was founded at the tine of the First Babylonian Dynasty by immigrants from Nina a part of the city of Lagash, is impossible, seeing that Ilushuma king of Assyria was a contemporary of Sumuabu, the founder of the First Babylonian Dynasty, and it is exceedingly un- likely that Sumerian immigrants should have elected a Semitic king. If the foundation of Assyria was due to Sumerian immigrants, it must have occurred perhaps centuries before the West Semitic invasion. Nor is it likely that Ishtar among the Semitic nomads was a female deity, seeing that this deity is identical with South-Arabian Athtar that was a male deity. The connection of Adad with Shamash was scarcely due to the fact that Shamash was conceived as a god of destruction. Adad being identical with Ba'al, he was of course a solar deity like Shamash, and the West Semites that settled down in Sippar worshipped their own West Semitic solar god, and therefore Adad became associated with Shamash. 42Religious and Moral Ideas in Babylonia and Assyria.

((Biblical and Oriental Series).</page><page sequence="6">204 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW Nor is the author correct in saying that according to the Babylonian con- ceptions, gods died like mortals. The gods that died were merely half- gods, like Gilgamish, Tammuz, Gislz-zida. The very fact that Ut-nap- ishtiiz lived for ever, because he was made a god, sufficiently proves that gods were conceived to be immortal. So also Adapa would have become immortal, if he had accepted the "bread of life" and the "water of life," when they were offered to him. Nor can we agree that the doing of wrong and evil was ascribed to the gods. "The doing of evil" is correct, but this evil was always well deserved and a divine retribution, as other- wise the conception of justice would not have existed among the Baby- lonians, and we certainly have incontestable evidence that it did exist. Even if we should find in a text that the gods are accused of doing wrong, we also in our troubles often accuse God of having wronged us, and this is surely not a religious conception with us. Job accused God of having wronged him, and yet we would not ascribe such a conception to Israel's belief. If the Babylonian gods were subject to repentance, there is noth- ing wrong about it. Did not Amos say: "The Lord repented concerning this" (7, 3.6), and do we not find the same expressions many and many times in the Old Testament? It merely means that God tempered justice with mercy. The Babylonian religion had no doubt many defects, be- sides being polytheistic, but on these points it may justly plead: Not guilty! 43.While a knowledge of the Babylonian-Assyrian religious conceptions is an absolute necessity for the Old Testament Student, this is insuf- ficient. It would be one-sided to consider the Hebrew religious concep- tions as being more or less exclusively indebted to the home of Israel's ancestors in the Euphrates Valley. If Israel sojourned in Egypt for centuries, as Biblical traditions state, would it seem conceivable that they should have kept themselves entirely free from Egyptian influences. Thus a knowledge of the Egyptian religious conceptions is necessary to decide such a question. Now it is true, the modern critics who either deny the Biblical records of the Exodus altogether, or maintain that the sojourn of Israel in Egypt lasted only a short period, and this short dur- ation was insufficient to imbue Israel with Egyptian religious conception, are seemingly justified in denying any Egyptian influence on Israel's religion. But this is a fallacy. Certainly they cannot deny the his- torical fact that pre-Israelitish Canaan was for more than three centuries 43Growth of Religious and Moral Ideas in Egypt. By SAMUEL A. B.

But they likewise declare that Israel's religion was de- veloped in Canaan, that it was in fact merely a transformation of the Canaanitic religion, and the latter could not have escaped Egyptian influence. Conservative scholars who deny that the development of Israel's religion was post-Mosaic, are justified in denying the influence of Egypt on the oppressed Israelites in that country. They may justly maintain that Israel's hatred toward their oppressors and their own Henotheistic religion inherited from their ancestors were forces strong enough to counter-balance the effect of environment. But arguments of that sort do not exist for modern critics. For them a knowledge of the Egyptian religion is of vital importance. If there are no traces of the Egyptian religious influence in the religion of Israel, it would demon- strate that its development did not take place in Canaan and the whole critical edifice would collapse. A concise and clear account of this subject that should make the stu- dent acquainted with this background of Old Testament history has been provided also by MERCER in his book Growth of Religious and Moral Ideas in Egypt. As to its form and treatment, it is a replica of the pre- ceding work, being divided into six chapters, dealing with god, man, mediation, future, and morality, and containing a chronology (the short one), and a selected bibliography. The presentation of the subject is very attractive. No outline of the contents can be expected. One who has read BREASTED'S Development of Religion and Thought in Ancient Egypt, and the articles on Egyptian religion in Hasting's Encyclopaedia will find very little new in this book. Nevertheless, the student will be indebted to the author for having provided him with this condensed, clear, thorough, and well-written book. 44. We have pointed out that the modern critics must either prove Egyptian influence on the development of Israel's religion or admit that its development occurred before Israel's entrance into Canaan. Now it seemed very unlikely that they should be able to find traces of Egyptian religious influence in Israel's religion. If they should believe in the early origin of the Priestly Code, they might find adoptions of Egyptian forms of worship in Israel's priesthood and in the Tabernacle. But these mat- ters are taken to be pure fiction, dating from the exilic and post-exilic periods. Thus the search for such traces seemed to be in vain. But un- 44Die Patriarchen Israels.

Pp. 115.</page><page sequence="8">206 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW expected support comes to them from a countryman of Abraham Kuenen -who gives them even much more than they are looking for. This is VOLTER in his book Die Patriarchen Israels (im Lichte der A egyptischen Mythologie), who contends that the prehistory of Israel is purely Egyp- tian mythology. It is evident, though the author does not express it, that his arguments are exclusively directed against the inventor of the so-called Pan-Babylonism, HUGO WINCKLER, who at the first publica- tion of his views, interpreted the early history of Israel mythologically from a Babylonian point of view, seeing in the Biblical heroes reflexes of the Babylonian pantheon. Considering Israel's prehistory from a mythological point of view, the author's arguments are not unfounded. If the Biblical narratives are full of mythological motifs, why not look for them in Egypt, a country that was in closer connection with Pales- tine than Babylonia? Winckler, however, distinctly declared, that the mythological motifs are strictly limited to the form of the Biblical nar- ratives, and that he was far from denying the historical character of the Biblical personages. But this author goes further, in denying their very existence. However, the tendency to explain the Biblical narratives from a mythological standpoint belongs practically to the past. But the author does not seem to be aware of it. With the exception of a few of the older generation, who are not yet ready to part with this pet theory on which they have expanded so much labor and ingenuity, Biblical scholars do not consider it seriously any longer. Only the Book of Esther is still haunted by the mythological ghosts, lacking a more natural and more reasonable interpretation, according to their conceptions. This famous scholar Winckler has done a great deal of mischief with his mythological theories. His laurels excited the envy of the great Biblical scholar CHEYNE, who tried to outstrip him by the invention of his Jeral- meel, and thereby has become the laughing-stock of the scholarly world. And he evidently perverted the mind also of our author. The author's view is: The prehistory (Urgeschichte) of Israel essentially consists of the stories of Abraham, Jacob and Moses and the whole of it appears in a historical connection and in a chronological scheme. But a glance at these narratives is sufficient to remove all doubts concerning their real character. The gods appear in them on the earth and reveal themselves to human beings, eating, communicating, speaking and fight- ing with them. The men also, the heroes of these stories, give the im- pression of being "depotentialized" deities whose actions and personali- ties can be comprehended only, if raised above the human sphere and regarded as the divine representatives of natural events and natural</page><page sequence="9">SURVEY OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE-HOSCHANDER 207 phenomena. What the Old Testament tells about the Patriarchs and about Moses is nothing but mythology. But such a general contention is of little value, as long as the main figures and narratives are not ex- plained mythologically, and as long as their mythological source is not proved. He maintains, and not wrongly, that the histories of Abraham, Jacob, Joseph, and Moses, are so closely linked together with no coun- try-leaving aside Palestine, as with Egypt. If foreign mythology was of any influence on Israel's prehistory, we ought to think in the first place of that of Egypt, since Palestine was not only its immediate neigh- bor, but was also in an early period under its dominion, and stood also in close connection with it. This a priori suggestion is fully confirmed by a closer investigation. It proves that the prominent figures of Israel's prehistory correspond to the chief deities of the Egyptian pantheon and bear the same features. To show the author's method, we shall present a few specimens of his identifications: Abraham is identified with Nun, the father of the gods' and is therefore called "the exalted father," Jahveh, with his son Re, Sarah, with his wife Ninet, Isaac is again identified with Re, the sun god, Rebekah, with Hathor, the goddess of the foreigners. Hagar and Ishmael correspond to Isis and Horus. Esau and Jacob present the gods Shu and Keb. Joseph is Osiris and his wife Asenath is Isis. The author seems to have forgotten to identify Moses with an Egyptian deity, though he denied also his human existence. The reader interested in these matters may read the rest for himself. In conclusion, we may state that the author's mythological interpretations are strictly based on the current critical views. 45. From these harebrained fancies that should prove the influence of Eygptian religious conceptions on the early history of Israel, we turn back to the home of Abraham in the Euphrates Valley to seek there light on these matters. There we meet with a highly important and exceed- ingly valuable work from the pen of an eminent authority on Assyriology UNGNAD'S Die Religion der Babylonier und Assyrer. This work contains a collection of the Babylonian-Assyrian religious texts in German trans- lation that gives us an insight into the religious life of these ancient na- tions. This collection consists of myths and epics, as the various versions of the story of Creation, the Gilgamish-epic, Deluge-legends, legends of heaven and hell and others; so also prayers and songs, psalms and 4Die Religion der Babylonier und Assyrer ilbertragen und eingeleitet.

Each section is prefaced by a few explanatory remarks on its contents. But these remarks do not include comparisons of the religious ideas with those of the Old Testament or other creeds, conclusions of that kind being left to the discernment of the reader. The work is intended for the information of the general reader rather than for the student, and so the author considered it unnecessary and disturbing to indicate the frag- mentary character of the texts, emendations, and doubtful readings and translations by gaps, parentheses, and question marks, and instead of it, they are printed in Italics. Students who want to go deeper into these subjects are referred to the publications of these texts in the Biblio- graphy. The author was perfectly right in doing so, as it is far more pleasant to read the texts in this way than if they had been crowded with these scholarly symbols, which to the general reader are hiero- glyphics. Of special interest is the brief Introduction treating with Babylonian- Assyrian religious conceptions, and containing also an outline of the political conditions of these countries from the oldest period down to the second century B.C.E. It is admirable how the author managed to crowd into 21 pages such a mass of information. There is one point of which we do not approve. The author, as others, has renamed some kings, as the famous king of Ur Dungi, is renamed Shulgi, the equally well-known king of Assyria Tukulti-Ninib is renamed Tukulti-Nimurta. While the Assyriologist knows to what kings the author referred, the general Bible student, who has a fair knowledge of Babylonian-As- syrian history, does not. The old pronunciation ought to have been put either in parentheses or in the footnotes. It would be desirable to have such a work also in English, as ROGERS' Cuneiform Parallels, though containing more material not restricted to religious matters, is intended more for scholars than for the general Bible Student. 46. To the preceding work we may join MEISSNER'S Babylonien und Assyrien. It is no exaggeration to say that it is the most important work on the civilization of the two ancient nations of the Euphrates Valley in recent years, a work complete in every respect that covers all branches of this subject, and the thorough character of its treatment is guaranteed by the name of a safe and sane authority on the cuneiform literature. 46Babylonien und Assyrien.

WEIDNER has added to this work complete Dynastic Lists of both the Kings of Babylonia and Assyria from the oldest period down to the downfall of Nineveh or to the Persian period, in accordance with his reconstructed Chronology. An enumeration of the subjects treated would seem unnecessary. Nevertheless, the Bible student to whom we urgently recommend this work for study, and as handbook of reference, expects to know the sub- ject-matter treated of. The first volume describes in 12 chapters land and people, gives a historical survey, treats of the king and his house, the army and military equipment, the officials and administration, the judicial system, agriculture including chase and fisheries, handicrafts and their productions, art, communication and commerce, society, family, and the daily life. The second volume is exclusively devoted to cuneiform religion and science. Its 10 chapters treat of the pantheon, the priests and the cult, cosmology and theology, the religious literature, magic, mantic, medicine, philological, historical, natural and exact sciences, and ethics and morals. Though the work is thoroughly sci- entific, it is so well written that it will appeal also to the general reader, for whom it is also intended. It is needless to say that the treatment is based upon the most recent cuneiform inscriptions at disposal. The author not being fond of hazardous hypotheses, his statements may be accepted on their face value as the results of careful investigation. It would be unfair in such a work to point out subjects of special impor- tance, as there is nothing of no importance. 47.While the preceding works have been included in the recent Biblical literature on the assumption that Babylonia as the homeland of Abra- ham must have influenced the early religious conceptions of the Hebrews and thus forms the background for Israel's history, the truth of this presumption has been questioned, nay, strenuously denied, years ago, by CLAY in his well-known book Amurru, the Home of the Northern Semites. He advanced the thesis that the culture of the Semitic Baby- lonians had, if not its origin, at least a long development in the land of the Amorites before it was carried into Babylonia, and that the religion and culture of Israel were not importations from Babylonia, but de- veloped naturally in their own land from an earlier and indigeneous civilization. This thesis is now being reconfirmed and strengthened by 47The Empire of the Amorites. By ALBERT T. CLAY. New Haven: YALE UNIVERSITY PRESS; London: HUMPHREY MILFORD; Oxford University Press, 1922.

The author takes issue with the generally prevailing view, that the Semites of Amurru had come out of Arabia as barbarians during the lat- ter part of the third millennium. In the discussion of his thesis and the evidence of the archaeological material upon which it is based, the author dwells upon the importance of proper names for gaining such a knowledge. Though this knowledge is little more than a glimmer here and there, obtained from the records of Babylonia and Egypt, except as we feel the pulse of this people by contact with offshoots that appear in the surrounding lands, it is upon these data that we must rely at present; namely the influence exerted by the Amorites upon peoples with whom they came in contact through their encroachments upon, and in- vasions of other lands. His arguments against the current view that sees in Arabia the home of the Semites are worthy of serious consideration. He contends that from the large number of ruins in the desert in a location where today there is no adequate water supply, we may conclude, as it has been done, that the climate of Arabia in ancient times was different from that of today, and we may readily understand how tribes with great flocks would pass into this country even from the North. The fact that the Arabic language preserves more fully the characteristics of Semitic speech demonstrates only that Arabia was settled prior to the time when the Semitic languages suffered decay or modifications, such as usually follow the development of civilization. If such a migration from Arabia had taken place, there would be unmistakable evidence in the personal names, which is far from being the case. The view of the Biblical writers in the Table of Nations, in trying to account for the origin of the Arabi- ans, is that they emanated from the North, seeing that their ancestor Joktan is presented as son of Eber. He further points out that in the early history of the Hebrews, though there is a mass of literature about this period, there is no hint th.at the Hebrews came out of Arabia at that time. As to the author's identifications of Amur, Amar, Mar with Uru, they are philologically sound. A name Amur pronounced Awur would of course be contracted into Aur and Or, and would be written Ur. The same would be true of Amar pronounced Awor, or of Mar pronounced Wor, as we know that the vowel a was frequently pronounced o, espe- cially after wuaw, and the consonant Mem was no doubt pronounced as</page><page sequence="13">SURVEY OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE-IIOSCHANDER 211 Digamma. There is at present a heated controversy on this problem between the author and Professor Barton (JAOS., 1925, pp. 1-30; 120- 125), and the present writer has no hesitation in saying that the argu- ments of the former are more convincing. However, it is very doubtful whether the author's contention that there existed an Amoritic empire in the fourth and fifth millennium B.C.E. will ever be proved by excavations, unless the Amorites in these remote periods had already adopted the cuneiform script, and this is scarcely likely. But the author has made it very plausible that an em- pire of Amurru had existed in the third millennium at least. If so, what prevents us from assuming that it had existed long before? Yet it would seem strange that a civilized empire should have existed for millenniums without having adopted or invented the art of writing, and we must ex- pect to find documentary evidence of its existence. Thus at present the author's thesis is merely a very probable theory. Future excavations will either justify or refute it. But there is nothing illogical in his argu- ments. That the author's views will find little favor with his contempora- ries is not due to their illogical character or their improbability. Their acceptance would mean a death blow to Biblical criticism. There are a few points to which we may call attention. The author correctly pointed to the Table of Nations as a historical source that must not be ignored. But this historical source seems to indicate that Pales- tine was not included in the empire of Amurru. Now the genealogical scheme of this Table has not been rightly understood by Biblical scholars. The reviewer has not the least doubt that according to the scheme of this Table, the indigeneous people is termed "Father," while the im- migrants into the country are termed "Sons," through there may not have been the least racial affinity between them. This is true of the whole Table and could be very easily verified. This is also true of the Table of the peoples of Canaan (Gen 10, 15-19). Now the Amorite is enumerated as the fourth "son" of Canaan, and placed after the Hittite and Jebusite. Thus according to the Biblical writers, the non-Semitic Hittites and Jebusites entered Canaan before the Amorites. B6hl has rightly observed, that if we find the Hittite-Mitanni in Mesoptamia in the middle of the third millennium, their presence in Palestine is not strange at all. Yet Zidon is placed as the first-born son of Canaan, and there can be no question regarding the Semitic stock of the Phoenicians, a fact of which the Biblical writers were well aware. Hence according to the Bible, there were Semites in Canaan before the entrance of the Amorites. But is there any necessity to identify all the Semites in the</page><page sequence="14">212 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW Westland with the Amorites, and not regard the latter rather as a di- vision of the Semites who subsequently became so powerful that the whole western region was named after them? There is no difficulty to account for the presence of the Semitic Phoe- nicians in Canaan, if we bear in mind that Sargon of Akkad penetrated into Amurru as far as the Phoenician coast. If he wanted to keep this land permanently in possession, he was forced to leave there military garrisons, and in them we may recognize the Phoenicians. Now Herod- otus gives an account of his visit to the city of Tyre, and he states that the priests of Melkart told him that their temple was built when the city was founded, 2300 years before his visit. Assuming the visit of Herodotus to have been about 440 we have 2740 for the founding of the city of Tyre, and this date leads us directly to the reign of Sargon of Akkad, according to the current chronology. Now Huxley had observed that the tombs on the Bahrein islands in the Persian Gulf are almost identical with those of the Phoenicians, and these islands were no doubt a part of Sargon's empire. Thus it is very likely that the people settled on the Phoenician coast came from these islands and were no doubt Semites. Having been a maritime people in their former home, they were appro- priately placed there by Sargon as military garrisons. Therefore Zidon is termed the first-born son of Canaan. Thus according to the Biblical writers confirmed by non-Biblical evidence, there were Semites already about 2700 B.C.E. on the Phoenician coast. But this would not prevent us from assuming that the Amorites possessed large parts of Syria and Mesopotamia millenniums before. However, they did not enter Canaan before the middle of the third mil- lennium. Having been conquered by Sargon, they may have reasserted themselves and regained their independence after the downfall of Sar- gon's Dynasty, and during this time they may have taken in possession the whole western region including Canaan. In that way we can recon- cile the author's view with Biblical traditions, which must not be treated slightlingly, as the author rightly observes. This List sees in Canaan the indigeneous population, and there is indeed not the least evidence that the Canaanites entered Palestine during the second millennium, as modern scholars generally assume. The present writer is inclined to see in the name Canaan a cuneiform word Kana'dni "the subjects," corresponding to Greek Helot which has the same meaning. Subsequently when the meaning of the name was forgotten, the Semites themselves adopted this name. It is not without reason that in the Speech of Noah Canaan is cursed to become the servant of Shem and Japheth, that is,</page><page sequence="15">SURVEY OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE-HOSCHANDER 213 of the Semites and Hittites. Who knows whether the native population being oppressed and treated with contempt by the ruling peoples of the Semites and the Hittites, did not conspire to deliver the land into the hand of Egypt, and thus "exposed the nakedness of their father" and were therefore cursed? 48. Another book of equally high interest is CLAY'S publication A He- brew Deluge Story in Cuneiform. The author believes that this story of the deluge which had found its way into Babylonia, where it was made to conform largely to the Akkadian dialect, fully betrays its origin; it came from the same source whence the Hebrew traditions came, namely from the people of Amurru (Syria and Mesopotamia), called the Amorites. As was the case in pre-Mosaic days, and to a large extent in early Israel, when Henotheism prevailed, "God" is the formeost deity. We learn from this tradition, and also from its redaction written centuries later, that a long famine preceded the deluge, which is not referred to in the Old Testament, that the famine had been sent because men had mul- tiplied, and also because of their clamor, reminding us of the causes given for the deluge in the Old Testament. This inscription is not a recent discovery, nor is it the first time that it has appeared in print, but its importance owing to a faulty copy has never been understood. The author is confirmed in his views expressed in his book Amurru and in the preceding work, that the Hebrew tradi- tions were not borrowed from Babylonia, but were indigeneous to the land of the Amorites. If the author is right with regard to this inscrip- tion, that it is of Amoritic origin, it would be the most important evidence for his thesis. As far as we can see, he seems to have demonstrated that this inscription is not of Akkadian origin, seeing that it contains more than a dozen of words which have not yet been found in Semitic Bab- ylonian, but are found in Hebrew. They are: It-ta-a.-da-ar (-ny), "he was absent;" ik-ta-ab-ta (ppy), "they observed;" ma-shi-it-ta (~ir), "desolations," te-i-na (n.sn), "fig-tree;" shu (nv), "flock;" li-sha-ak-ti-il (5:v), "let he destroy;" li-e-ir-ri (,nI), "let he hurl;" li-im-ta-an-ni-ma (IoD), "let be held back;" zi-ba-ni-it (9Yx), "treasurers;" a-na-pat-te (ns), "for food;" i-ri-ha-ma (cf. nnnt), "he devours;" la-shu (prepos. i).

(Yale Oriental Series, Volume V-3.)</page><page sequence="16">214 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW ing to find Hebrew words in the Deluge story of the Gilgamish Epic. The only objection that can be raised against the author's conclusions is that such an evidenceis somewhat precarious. We must bear in mind, that, notwithstanding the immense cuneiform literature that has been uncovered, this is a mere fragment of what has been lost and is still hidden in the ground, and we can never be certain that these words did not existe in Semitic Babylonian. However, from the present state of our knowledge of the cuneiform literature, the author apparently vindicated his assertion with regard to the influence of the Amoritic literature upon that of Babylonia. Along with the Ancient Hebrew Deluge Story, the author publishes also ancient fragments of the Etana and Adapa legends. Highly inter- esting is the fourth chapter, entitled: An early chapter in the history of Amurru and Babylonia. There he ingeniously deals with Tammuz, Gishzida, and Humbaba in showing their connection with the West. The Appendix contains transliterations and translations of the Deluge Stories, Dynastic Lists of early Babylonia, autographic texts and helio- type reproductions. 49. In connection with the two preceding works, we may consider also CLAY'S answer to Professor BARTON'S Paper read before the American Oriental Society, The Antiquity of A morite Civilization. The author hits right and left, and any unbiased reader will readily admit that his argu- ments are fair and reasonable. The reviewer in reading his book The Empire of the Amorites had not the least doubt that his views will not be favorably received by modern scholars on account of tending to affirm Biblical traditions, without knowing that the same accusation is raised by the author in his answer to BARTON, in declaring that the latter's ex- treme antagonism to his views is the position he holds diametrically to his own, concerning the value of Biblical traditions. He also distinctly states that there is not the least evidence that the Canaanites entered Palestine during the second millennium (p. 9). Of course: "Barton does not attempt to offer any proof for the so-called migration wave of the Arabs in Canaan, 1800 B.C.E." Is there any reason why he should do so? Is it not a fact that this view had already become a truism, that it is found in every textbook, and must one account for the truth of a truism? This is the usual method of modern criticism. The first scholar suggests a theory expressed with due reserve; the second considers it probable, and by the process of transmission and repetition it becomes a matter 49The Antiquity of the Amorite Civilization. By ALBERT T. CLAY. New Haven: 1924. Pp. 32.</page><page sequence="17">SURVEY OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE-HOSCHANDER 215 of fact. Barton is of course not responsible for this procedure, which had become a tradition with Bible criticis. There is one criterion only for testing the truth of a theory, if it contradicts Biblical tradition. Never- theless CLAY is fundamentally a better Wellhausenian than BARTON. Both Wellhausen and Clay fundamentally and essentially hold the same view, that the development of Israel's religious conceptions was purely internal without outside influence. The difference is only as to the date of this development. What Wellhausen assigns to the ninth century, Clay ascribes to a remote period. 50. The question whether Israel's civilization was indigeneous leads us to a consideration of BERTHOLET'S Kulturgeschichte Israels. It is a book that may be safely designated as the most prominent publication on Biblical Archaeology in recent years, and this judgment will be readily concurred in even by those who are utterly opposed to many of its radical views. It is divided into two parts which are subdivided into chapters. The first part is entitled: The rise of an indigeneous culture of Israel, and the second: Israel's culture in Palestine. The subjects treated are too diverse and too manifold to attempt to give an adequate outline of their nature. We may dwell on a few points which seem to us noteworthy. After describing, in the first part, Palestine and its cultural possibilities, as the formation of the soil, fertility, irrigation, climate, production, its fitness for agriculture, cattle breeding, and commerce, the author pro- ceeds to investigate the civilization of its inhabitants during pre-historic times, in the paleolithic and neolithic periods; coming down to the his- torical times, he thoroughly discusses the Amoritic and Canaanitic periods, and finally arrives at Israel's entrance into Canaan. The author correctly holds that the Semitic period of Canaan cannot be placed earlier than 2800 B.C.E., when the Amorites entered the land. He is not inclined to accept the current opinion that the first Semites had come from the Arabian desert-this may be due to CLAY'S influence-, but thinks that their earlier habitat was somewhat near the Persian Gulf, and this is exactly the view which the present writer arrived at inde- pendently (47). The author further ventures the interesting suggestion, that Israel's re- ligious development may have been accentuated by the nature of the Palestinian soil. Palestine being exclusively dependent upon rain for its vegetation, its inhabitants were forced to lift their eyes up to heaven praying for this heavenly gift, seeing that it is a fact well-known to those 6OKulturgeschichte Israels. Von ALFRED BERTHOLET. G6ttingen: VANDENHOECK UND RUPRECHT, 1920, PP. 288.</page><page sequence="18">216 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW acquainted with rural conditions, that peasants who for the success of their labors are dependent upon natural phenomena over which they have no control are more religious than people of other occupations. However, this parallel is somewhat incorrect, and would not shed light upon Israel's peculiar development of its religion. Religious devotion was measured in antiquity by the proportion of the multitude of the deities to which one sacrificed. One who worshipped the largest number of deities was regarded as their special favorite who could justly expect their protection. The ancient nations looked upon Israel with its He- notheism or Monotheism as being wicked and impious. If the nature of the soil forced upon Israel religious devotion, they ought to have become more polytheistic than nations living on a more productive soil and in a more favorable climate. Nevertheless, the author is by no means wrong, but he did not draw the proper conclusions. Having been exclusively dependent upon rain which was regarded as the gift of "the Lord of heaven" (Ba'al Shamaim), we might suggest that the Hebrews accepted this Godhead first as their Supreme God and finally as their only God. This suggestion might account also for the fact that Judah dwelling on a relatively poor soil was more religious than his Northern brethern whose land was by far more fertile. It is likewise interesting and surprising to learn that the author has no objection to the Biblical traditions that Israel's entrance into Canaan was a mere return to the land of their ancestors, and he declares that we need not doubt that under the veil of legends that envelop Israel's be- ginnings, there are hidden trustworthy historical memories. Thus on this point he is far less sceptical than numerous modern critics. He like- wise sees no objection to the Biblical traditions, according to which Israel on its entrance into Canaan were no Bedouins any longer, though he holds that they were of nomadic origin, and still preserved many Bedouin conceptions. This is of course contrary to the general critical conception. Exceedingly interesting is his discussion on Matriarchy, in which he sees a Bedouin social system, and of which he declares that it was also that of Israel from the period of the Patriarchs down to the times of the monarchy. Now it must be admitted that there are traces of this social system in Israel, but this was a survival of an earlier period, and this is no evidence that the system of Patriarchy of the Mosaic Laws has not yet existed in Israel after its entrance into Canaan. Idolatry continued to strvive during the whole pre-exilic period, and why should Matriarchy be an exception? Highly suggestive are the discussions on the religion of Israel at their</page><page sequence="19">SURVEY OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE-HOSCHANDER 217 entrance into Canaan. They came, he says, as the hosts of Jahveh, and Jahveh Sebaoth may mean: "Jahveh of the hosts of Israel." He does not accept the view often expressed that there are traces in the Old Testa- ment that Israel's ancestors had passed through the stage of Totemism. But he finds traces of ancestor worship in an early pre-Mosaic period. It is noteworthy that he ridicules the idea of tracing the Hebrew Mono- theism to Babylonian origin. Nor does he believe that it had anything to do with the monotheistic reform of Amenophis IV. He believes that what made Moses the proclaimer of a new creed was a religious exper- ience on the sacred place, and through it, his heart forced him to lead his enslaved brethern into freedom and to the God that had appeared to him; and the wonderful deliverance on the Red Sea bound the God of Sinai with Israel's tribes. Nor does he accept the hypothesis that Jahveh was originally the God of the Kenites, whom Moses brought to Israel, unless one assumes that Jahve was both the God of the Kenites and of the Israelites. He asks: How can we understand such a fact that Israel should have accepted the message of a man who came to them in the name of a foreign God? But Moses distinctly told them: "Jahveh, the God of your fathers, hath sent me unto you." Thus he did not come in the name of a foreign God. He would still be the same God no mat- ter whether His name was El Shaddai or Jahveh. These few points sufficiently show that the author is somewhat more moderate than the critical scholars in general. We may perhaps define the difference between the point of view of the critics and his own. They regard Biblical traditions as legendary, while he sees in the Biblical legends dependable historical memories somewhat idealized. Neverthe- less it would be sheer injustice in numbering the author among the mod- erate critics. The book certainly contains radical views enough, to satisfy the most fastidious among the radicals. But there is no need to point out his radical views, as it is exactly what one expects to find in modern Biblical literature. 51. Having seen the development of the culture of the Israelites in Ca- naan, we retrace our steps to their entrance into this country, in consider- ing GRIFFITH'S study The Exodus in the Light of Archaeology which in- vestigates several Biblical problems. The book is divided into VIII chapters and contains a Foreword by Dean WACE. The title indicates the main subject of the work: Is it possible to determine the precise date 51The Exodus in the Light of Archaeology. By J. S. GRIFFITH, Vicar of St. Barnabas, Morecambe.

The author dwells on the importance of this outstand- ing event in the early history of a race to whom the world owes an im- measurable debt of gratitude. He proceeds to deal with the Documen- tary Theory, in arguing against the Divine names, vocabularly and style, and refers to the investigations of Dahse, Wiener, Eerdmans and others. He points out that, though unity of purpose must not necessarily indicate unity of authorship, there is a striking mark of unity in the delineation of character of the chief personages of the Old Testament, and the representation of them is consistent throughout. The numerous discrepancies and difficulties do not necessarily confirm the critical theory. They have the opposite tendency rather; for in a great many instances it provides no adequate solution of the difficulty. After giving a brief sketch of the Biblical narrative, the author inves- tigates Biblical chronology, and finally on the basis of archaeology, 'ar- rives at the conclusion that the Exodus occurred about 1233-32. We shall not enter into a discussion of this date which we utterly reject as impossible, as we have already often expressed our views above. But we may call attention to the fact that according to the author's conclusions, the birth of the High Priest Eli would have occurred about five years after the death of Joshua-if Israel's invasion occurred about 1193, and if we assign to Joshua's activity 25 years at least-and this would of course be preposterous. The First Book of Chronicles (6, 18-22) enu- merates between Samuel and Ebiasaph son of Korah 14 generations. However, though on this point we do not accept the author's conclusions, the book contains a good many other investigations worth considering, and is thus a valuable Biblical study. 52. From the Exodus out of Egypt we return to this country which has preserved for us the only early Jewish documents, in dealing with Cow- LEY'S Jewish Documents of the Time of Ezra. This book is the first volume of the Series of Translations of Early Documents, edited by OESTERLY and Box, the aim of which is to furnish in translations important texts unencumbered by commentary or elaborate notes. The Papyri trans- lated in this volume were found, probably all at Elephantine, between the years 1898 and 1908. Documents such as these have a special inter- est, because they preserve for us the actual words and writing of a re- mote past. They are records contemporary with the events to which they relate, and are therefore first-hand historical evidence, uncorrupted 62Jewish Documents from the Time of Ezra (translated from the Aramaic).

They not only tell us of public events but give us also an insight into the private life and circumstances of the past. The present texts, which are nearly all dated, cover practically the whole of the fifth century B.C.E., during which time Egypt was under Persian rule. They are dated by the regnal years of Darius I, Xerxes, I, Artaxerxes I, Darius II, and the Egyptian king Amyrtaeus. They emanate from a hitherto unknown Jewish colony in the South of Egypt at Elephantine and Syene. Thus they are the earliest Jewish documents in existence, outside the Bible, and are a valuable contemporary illus- tration of the Books of Ezra and Nehemiah. The language in which they are written is Aramaic, which was the diplomatic language of that time in the East, and was used by the Persian government in the ad- ministration of the provinces, as we see from the version of the Behistun inscription sent to the colony in Egypt for their information. The author points out that the kind of writing used in the Papyri is also that in which Ezra must have written his copy of the Law, and from which the modern square Hebrew is a lineal descendant. Thus argument as to the form of the text of the Pentateuch from his time onward must therefore be based on this sort of writing and not on the old Hebrew. This is a very important point for textual criticism. In the Introduction, which is exceedingly instructive, the author dis- cusses the origin of the Jewish colony, on which discussion space forbids us to dwell. He mentions also that these Jews acknowledged not only their God Jahu-Jahveh but also Ishumbethel, Anathbethel, and Herem- bethel, which are apparently gods associated with the former, but he does not give any explanation with regard to the origin of these deities. Now considering that Bethel was not a Judean sanctuary, may we not suggest a North-Israelitish origin for this colony. The present writer sees in Hosea 9, 6, which reads: "For, lo, they are gone away from de- struction, Egypt shall gather them up, Memphis shall bury them," evidence that during the period of anarchy in North-Israel, many Israel- ites of the -better classes immigrated into Egypt, where they could live at ease, and the prophet branded this immigration as national treason, and predicted for them a dire punishment. There are also other pas- sages in Hosea to that effect (7, 11.16; 8, 13; 9, 3; 11, 11). They may indeed have suffered greatly during the Assyrian rule, but some of them survived, with whom later the Judeans after the destruction of Jerusalem</page><page sequence="22">220 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW associated themselves, and therefore the earlier gods of Bethel were still worshipped, though the colony as a whole consisted of Judeans. The texts translated consist of 36 numbers, besides The Words of Ahikar and the Behistun Inscription. Of special importance is the num- ber 21, which contains an order of Darius II for the celebration of the Feast of Unleavened Bread. The author rightly observes that, if the Persian king could be induced to issue a special order concerning a single religious observance, we need not question the authenticity of the letter of Artaxerxes in Ezra 7, 12, dealing with the much more important matter of Ezra's mission. It shows even more that the Jews must have played a very important role at the Persian court, if they could interest the king in purely Jewish matters of religion. 53. The fact that Darius II issued a royal edict to a distant Jewish colony to celebrate the Feast of Unleavened Bread, an observance which was not of the least interest for the Persian government, proves on the one hand that Jewish spiritual leaders played a most important part at the Persian royal court, and on the other hand that the Jewish religion was not only well known to the Persians but treated with special favor. This favor can be ascribed only to the similarity of the Jewish and Persian religious conceptions. The Persians looked upon "The God of Heaven" worshipped by the Jews as being in every respect identical with their own Supreme God Ahuramazda, and we may rest assured that the same conception prevailed among the Jewish people at large, though their spiritual leaders strongly protested against such an identification. Now this was the storm and stress period of the Jewish religion, when post- exilic Judaism was being developed. While the idolatrous creed of the Babylonians may not have had the least influence on the development of the religion of Israel as being the creed of their oppressors, and this oppression was a force strong enough to counteract the influence of environment, no such reason existed with regard to the influence of the Persian religion, which was the creed of their liberators. Thus such an influence must be a priori assumed, unless we find evidence to the contrary. But a great many authorities ascribe the rise of the Persian religion to the sixth century B.C.E., and it may be assumed that during the following fifth century it was still in a stage of development. The question would now arise, whether there was not a mutual influence on the development of both the Jewish and the Persian religions. Such 3Die Altpersische Religion und das Judentum (Unterschiede, Ubereinstimmungen, und Gegenseitige Beeinflussungen). Von Dr. J. SCHEFTELOWITZ, Privatdozent an der Universitat Koln.

Such an investigation we find in SCHEFTELOWITZ'S book Die Altpersische Religion und das Judentuim (Unterschiede, Uebereinstimmun- gen, und Gegenseitige Beeinflussungen). The author points out that Judaism and Parsism, which for centuries were in contact with one another, are the oldest religions of salvation, which attempted to solve the problems of humanity, setting up a high goal for its moral striving, and culminating in the idea that the real hap- piness of man can be expected only in a future Kingdom of God. Both religions, though of national origin, survived the complete downfall of their nations, owing to their own internal and eternal forces, and having been uprooted from homes, could continue to thrive far away from their own countries. Ahuramazda, like the God of Israel, was conceived as being the world's Creator, Preserver, Judge Eternal, Omniscient, and morally Holy. The author fully expressed his conception of comparing both religions in the sub-title of his book: Differences, Agreements, and lMutual Influences. But it would be a fallacy to assume that a study of the Persian religion is of no interest for the Biblical religious conceptions, and the only ques- tion under consideration would be, how far this religion influenced post- Biblical Judaism. Surely, from a conservative point of view, the re- ligion of Israel being pre-exilic, any influence of Parsism on its develop- ment is out of consideration. Such an influence may be expected in the Biblical Books of post-exilic origin. This may or may not have been the case. It is quite different for the adherents of the critical view, who hold that the Pentateuch is of post-exilic origin. For them, the question would be in order, how far Parsism contributed to their origin. If we should find rituals and customs in the Pentateuch, which are held to have been unknown in pre-exilic times, and the same customs should be likewise found among the Persians, we could not but concede the in- fluence of the latter on those of Israel. It is thus obvious that a study of the Persian religion must be of utmost importance for Biblical criticism. As far as the author is concerned, though he is non-committal on the critical views, his conclusions are on the whole in agreement with the conservative point of view, as he does not find any influence of Parsism in the Mosaic Books, as far as we can see. On the contrary, where he finds identical conceptions in both, he declares the dependence of Pars- ism upon the latter. The book consists of 119 paragraphs and is divided into two unequal parts, the latter of which contains 20 chapters. The first part treats of</page><page sequence="24">222 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW the essential differences between Judaism and Parsism. The author thinks that unlike Moses, Zoroaster brought his people completely new gods, formerly unknown to them. Different from the Mosaic concep- tion, these gods were corporeal, and not purely spiritual. They were con- ceived in human shape. Therefore an opinion expressed that the spiritual conception of Jahveh in the Old Testament developed under the in- fluence of Parsism, is totally wrong. He does not give credence to Herod- otus' statement that the Persians did not present the gods in human shape. However, on this point the author is decidedly wrong. In the introduction he observes that not a few Jews accepted the Persian re- ligion, because they did not find any difference between this religion and that of Israel; and therefore the Babylonian Isaiah called attention to the fact that the God of Israel is not only the Creator of Light, like Ahura- mazda, but also of Darkness. Now if Ahuramazda had been worshipped in an image, there would have been not much difference between his worship and that of the Babylonian gods, and the prophet would have denounced such a worship as idolatry! It is thus obvious that, in the time of Herodotus, the Persian religion was still free from image worship, and its introduction was due to the corruption which this creed under- went under the reign of Arataxrexes II. If the author discredits Herod- otus' statement, he must do the same with that of Berossus, who states that this king was the first to introduce images of gods into the Persian religion. The spiritual conception of Ahuramazda found in later sources was not due to Jewish influence, as the author thinks, but was merely a return to Zoroaster's original conception. The very fact that Judaism remained free from such a corporeal conception of the Deity is in itself a confirmation that it did not exist during a period when the Jewish people were not yet deeply imbued with the Biblical religious concep- tions, and their minds were still flexible and accessible to foreign influ- ences. If we draw conclusions from the late Persian religious literature as to the Zoroastrian religious conceptions in the fifth century B.C.E., we might do the same with regard to the Jewish religious conceptions, in proving from Midrashic literature that the Jews in the fifth century con- ceived Jahveh as corporeal, and therefore the Babylonian prophet did not object to this conception of the Persian religion. Unfortunately, the ancient books of the Zoroastrian religion do not exist any longer, and the oldest sources of the Persians date from the period of the Sassanids, and safe conclusions from these late sources on the real religion of Zoroaster are nigh impossible. However, while we absolutely disagree with the author's view on the</page><page sequence="25">SURVEY OF BIBLICAL IITERATURE-HOSCHANDER 223 conception of the divinity of Ahuramazda in an early period, this is not the main thesis of his book. Its importance lies in the comparison of late Parsism with late Judaism. Such a scholarly work could be produced only by one who possesses a thorough knowledge of the Rabbinic litera- ture as does the author. 54. A similar work treating the same subject, which however, in scope and contents is more limited, as it leaves the Rabbinic literature out of consideration, is CARTER'S Zoroastrianism and Judaism. This work is an attempt to give an outline picture of Zoroastrianism, and then of Judaism, when it came to be a somewhat fixed system in the post-exilic times, presenting the leading religious, social, and moral conceptions of both religions, and to indicate something of the probably influence, or relation, of one system on the other. It is divided into X chapters, and contains an Introduction and a useful bibliography. In the chapters I-II, the author gives brief outlines of the life of Zoroaster and his religion, and of Judaism after the return from the Bab- ylonian captivity. Zoroaster is dated between 250 and 300 before the advent of Alexander the Great. The conditions of the returned exiles are very sympathetically pictured. So in the description of the institu- tion of the Synagogue, the author remarks: "There resulted a devotion to the Law, to know and to keep which was a glad privilege. There de- veloped in Judaism a self-centred, intellectual, strong moral-religious life, illustrated by loft examples of probity and piety." He rightly points out that the erection of that high wall of separation kept the Jews faithful to their religion and excluded the influence of their heathen neighbors; and their resistance to Greek worldliness, philosophy, and radicalism was exclusively due to their "Legalism." He thinks that during the Persian period it is not likely that the Hebrews exerted any strong influence upon Persian ideas, nor the Persians upon those of the Hebrews, especially during a large part of that period, the attitude of the satraps towards the Palestinian Jews would not dispose the latter consciously to imitate, and those in the Diaspora would not consciously have adopted Persian ideas, when their hearts said: "How shall we sing the Lord's song in a strange land'?' He maintains that no important belief of Judiams was adopted outright from the Iranian faith; but without foreign influence, some of the leading beliefs would not have been grasped and so fully developed, as they appear to have been from this time.

By GEORGE WILLIAM CARTER, Ph.D. With an In- troduction by CHARLES GRAY SHAW, Ph.D. Boston: RICHARD BADGER, THE GORHAM PRESS, 1918, Pp. 116.</page><page sequence="26">224 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW In the following chapters, the author traces the resemblances between the two religions and indicates the probable influence of the one upon the other. With regard to the idea of deity, he differs from that of SCHEF- TELOWITZ, that Ahuramazda was conceived as having a human body; as to Zoroaster he was a spiritual, incomprehensible being. Because he is said to sustain a fatherly relation to some of the Amesha Spentas, this does not detract from the purity and ideality of his conception; it is as though he were affirmed to be the father of all goodness. He believes that Zoroaster did not borrow the conception of Jahveh for that of Ahuramazda, in pointing out that his cult has a national stamp in spite of resemblances. Besides the reform of Zoroaster is earlier than the Persian rule over the Jews. However, on this point the author's conclusions are incorrect. Islam has likewise a purely national stamp notwithstanding its main indebted- ness to Judaism for its monotheistic ideas. Nor can we maintain that the Persians had not come in contact with the Hebrews before the con- quest of Babylonia. There were Israelites in the Median provinces since the last quarter of the eighth century, as the Second Book of Kings (17, 6) states that a part of the inhabitants of Samaria were deported to the cities of the Medes. A man like Zoroaster, whose only interest was religion and seeking after truth, may well have been curious about the religion conceptions of these foreigners and thus may have become ac- quainted with the Hebrew conceptions of the Godhead. This possibility has been generally overloooked in tracing the origin of the Persian re- ligious ideas. The author correctly suggest that the Jews would have been attracted by the lofty conceptions of Ahuramazda, and that through Zoroastrian- ism the Jews were led to grasp attributes and qualities of Jahveh, which previously had been latent, through to the new ideas the Jewish people gave a loftier and purer and more human meaning than their foreign neighbors had done. Thus both books of SCHEFTELOWIZ and CARTER are valuable contributions to the science of comparative religions. But the importance of the former lies in the comparison of late Parsism with late Judaism, as reflected in the Rabbinic literature, while that of the latter is of equal importance with regard to a comparison of the early Persian religion with early post-exilic Judaism. But the subject is some- what complicated, as not all of his conclusions can be accepted, if we do not subscribe to the current critical views concerning the composition of the Pentateuch. However, most of them are independent of the critical</page><page sequence="27">SURVEY OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE-HOSCHANDER 225 standpoint. The book is so well written that it will recommend itself not only to the student but also to the general reader. 55.An opinion, different from that of these two scholars, that the whole development of post-exilic Judaism was due to the influence of Zoroast- rianism is held, according to ZIEGLER in his study Das Magische Juden- tum, by OSWALD SPENGLER in his work Der Untergang des A bendlandes. He even questioned whether Deutero-Isaiah did not receive his enlight- ment from a disciple of Zoroaster. Ziegler's book is an outline and a review of Spengler's voluminous work, and specifically of his views on the rise, development, and final fate of Judaism, which are presented in the third chapter of the second volume of his book. His starting point is the question: What is culture? It is a European conceit and meaning- less to divide the history of mankind into Antiquity, Middle Ages, and Modern Times. Each culture is a world for itself, and possesses its own music, its own mathematics, its own architecture, its own philosophy and its own morals. It is further wrong to speak of the culture of indi- vidual peoples. The people do not create its culture, but the culture is the creator of the people. Peoples heterogeneous by race and language, if imbued by a common culture, belong together and are one organism. Each culture is an organism. As such it has birth, florescence, and death, youth and senility. All these cultures, organisms of the highest rank, grow in an exalted purposelessness as the flowers in the field. Ask not, why this culture is of that kind, and the other different; this is fate; each is as it is. Moreover, each culture lives its own life, and is unable to have a full comprehension of the other. Consequently men belonging to dif- ferent cultures ignore, hate, despise one another. They are like animals belonging to different races, that feel uneasy in meeting one another without knowing the reason. The course of life of each culture is the same. Each has its own prehistory. Dark forebodings, a chaos of con- fused feelings pass through the men of a certain region, before the awak- ening of their soul, and suddenly the culture is there, demurely groping and virginal. The awakening is followed by a splendid florescence of the culture, developing itself luxuriantly in all branches; with loving arms it embraces all that life offers it, be it spiritual, political, religious and economic; everywhere its stamp, its peculiar mark is visible. But it does not develop where it awakes, which is again fatum. Each culture awakes among the peasants; the farm is its first symbol. But its florescence 56Das Magische Judentum (Eine Studie zu Oswald Spenglers "Der Untergang des Abendlandes"). Von Professor Dr. J. ZIEGLER, Rabbiner in Karlsbad. Leipzig: VER- LAG VON W. M. KAUFMANN, 1923, Pp. 112.</page><page sequence="28">226 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW takes place in the towns and cities, which it founds, among the circles of priests, poets, scholars, artists, politicians, diplomatists and army-com- manders. All great cultures are products of cities. Then comes maturity and finally senility, and death. The death of a culture means the death of its peoples. If a culture has reached its highest pinnacle, if no develop- ment is longer possible, if it has no "future" but a "past," it becomes a cosmopolitic civilization, and this is the end of the culture. As civiliza- tion it may still continue to exist with seeming youthfulness, and may even develop a certain renovation and regeneration, which may be de- signated a second religiosity; but there is no progress and no develop- ment; everything is petrified and rigid. Great as the performances cf the cosmopolitic cities may be, they have no creative power any longer, and are merely elaborations of the past. In this last epoch, the peoples of a culture become "fellahin"-peoples, as the Egyptians since the Roman period, and finally the period of debility reaches this culture, the cosmopolitan cities become gradually desolate, and the people die out, and we see a grandiose chapter of the history of mankind completely fin- ished. A rejuvenation and a renovation of this culture is unthinkable. As its birth so its death is fatum. Each culture must die. But it occurs also, that a culture in its early youth invades the region of a senile cul- ture. Then we see a fateful pseudomorphism, that is to say, the youth- fully vigorous culture is forced to become immersed into the finished ideas, morals, and customs of the old culture. Some of them have been suppressed altogether and disappeared, others are still struggling for existence. The history of mankind numbers eight high cultures: the Babylonian, Egyptian, Indian, Chinese, Mexican, Apollinian (Classic), Faustinian (Western), and Magian (Arabian). The last three are closely connected with Judaism: the Magian, of which it constitutes a part; the Apollinian, with which it has come into a close contact; and the Faustinian, in the countries of which the majority of the Jews still exists. The Apollinian world comprises the regions of the Greek and Latin peoples during the centuries 1100-0; the Magian world lies between the Nile and Euphrates, Cairo and Bagdad, and its life endures 0-1000; the Faustinian world awoke about 1000, and is now in the state of its downfall, and to it be- long the peoples between the Elbe and the Tajo. What are the essential criteria of the Apollinian, Faustinian, and Magian cultures? For the Apollinian man nothing exists that is not sensual, present, perceptible, measurable, and computable; for him exists only that what he sees, what he is able to grasp, what he can look</page><page sequence="29">SURVEY OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE-HOSCHANDER 227 over, what is present before his eyes. He has no feeling for that which is removed, and consequently he has no sense for a great fatherland; home is for him his own city; his land is that which he can overlook from the towers of his own city. The ideal type of the Apollinian culture is the sensual and present individual. Different is the mental picture of the Faustinian man. He does not regard his existence as being complete within himself; but he desires to continue a life which started long before man whose longing is the unbounded distance and death, as one stand- ing in a boundless space and yet endeavoring to discern its bounds. What is the Magian mental picture contrasted with those of the Ap- pollinian and Faustinian? The former sees only that which is corporeal, and the latter looks into the far unbounded distance with passionate and deep yearning. But the Magian soul regards the world as a cave, in which it hovering abides; a magic light shines through the cave and battles against the darkness; the Upper and the Lower regions, Heaven and Earth are conceived as living powers fighting one another, and this fight is understood by those possessing the real knowledge, as the fight between Good and Evil. But what is specifically characteristic of the Magian mentality is the strongly carried through dualism of two puzzling substances: spirit (Geist) and soul. The breath of life by which the body is animated is distinguished from the abstract Divine soul, the irveiAca which alone is able to see the deity. It is this Ghost, which calls into existence the higher world, owing to which man triumphs over the mere life, the vital soul, or nature. This is the archetype of the Magian soul, which is partly religious, partly philosophical, and partly artificial. Each of these three cultures developed within itself. Each of them possesses its own, religion, art, science, jurisprudence, mathematics, physics, astronomy, morals, economy, politics, and the manner of wars. Their description is not of much interest for our purpose. But it is note- worthy that according to Spengler, intolerance is the specific character- istic of the Faustinian morals. How paradoxical! We thought that there was no want of intolerance during the centuries preceding the Faustinian era. However, our main interest centres in the Magian culture to which belongs Parsism, Chaldaism, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. He con- tends that the Magian man does not know the idea of a fatherland and of a mother tongue. The Magian culture is not connected with any land or with any language. Its only unifying band is the religious concensus; it separates believers and unbelievers, but firmly connects the believers among themselves. That is true of the Jew, Christian, and Persian. A Jew embracing the Mazda creed became at once a Persian; a Persian</page><page sequence="30">228 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW adopting Christianity ceased to be a member of his own people, belong- ing henceforth to the people of the "Nestorians." Zionism may be Jud- aish, but is not Jewish. This movement today as in the past on the re- turn from the Babylonian captivity is only seriously taken by a small minority of deficient mentality. The Jews might have returned to Pales- tine long ago, if they seriously desired it; but this would be contrary to the Magian "national idea;" this would be an Occidental adaptation. The ideal form of Judaism is "the Synagogue," which is the pure con- sensus, as the Church in the Magian Christianity, and among the Arabs the Islam. This Jewish idea was realized only after the destruction of Judea. If Ziegler did not affirm that Spengler is far from being an Antisemite, we might believe that his pet aversion is Judaism and that all his shafts are aimed at the Jews. He does not seem to advance any reason why a Gentilic member of the Christian faith could easily be changed into a Faustinian man, while a member of the Jewish faith is devoid of any sense and feeling for the Faustinian ideals. It is his firm assertion that even if a Jew takes part in them, he is merely an outsider and onlooker, and that is the case even of the Jews to whom Judaism means nothing, or who have parted with this faith, like Disraeli, as the Jew with his Magian mentality is unable to comprehend the Faustinian civilization. His final conclusion is that the West-European and American parts of the Jewish consensus, which have attracted the largest part of the rest of the Jews, are now in a state of dissolution and bound to disappear. Ziegler, in presenting Spengler's historical views on the origin and development of Judaism, shows his superficial and erroneous conceptions on many points. As far as Biblical times are concerned, every radical theory of the modern critics is treated by Spengler as a matter of fact. With regard to Talmudic Judaism, his views are preposterous to such a degree that we would not believe that a scholar in his right senses could have expressed anything of that kind. He actually maintains that dur- ing the period between Ezra and the first century C.E., the whole develop- ment of Judaism took place in the East, in Mesopotamia, and not in Judea. The institution of the Resh-Galutha with the High Schools of learning in Sura, Nehardea, and Pumpaditha, which date from about 200-300 C.E., are projected by him into the fourth century B.C.E. That the Jews played a most important part in the Parthian empire is indeed surprising, as nothing was known hitherto about it, and we would like to know his sources of information for such a statement. It is surely an exaggeration beyond all bounds to maintain that the Jewish knights in</page><page sequence="31">SURVEY OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE-HOSCHANDER 229 Spain under the Moorish dynasties were so powerful, and that they excited the admiration of the Gothic crusaders, who tried to imitate them. Such a statement would be pardonable if made by a novelist,.but not by a historian. However, Spengler had filled up his mind with a great many Jewish stories, without drawing any distinction between truth and romance. He refers to a Jewish general of the cavalry in the Imperial army during the Thirty Years Wars, who is buried on the cemetery in Prague. Now the story of this general is found in the "Prager Ghetto- Geschichten," and the name of this general is supposed to be Gabriel Mar (Bitter), and is of course a fable. But his knowledge is rather hazy not only with regard to the past but also to the present. Fancy, he knows socialists who are fighting any kind of religion, and yet are scrupulously observing the dietary laws, and putting on daily phylacteries and the prayer-shawl. Now while there may not be an absolute criterion to test the truth of a true prophet, we may surely say that a prophet who knows neither the past nor the present, knows just as little about the future, and his proph- ecy, that Judaism is doomed, need not be taken seriously. Yet Ziegler admits the justice of his prediction that the survival of the West-Eu- ropean Jews is rather precarious. He points out that a glance at modern Jewish literature suffices to see that all who write on Judaism prophesy its extinction. But this prophecy is conditional, while according to Spengler's thesis, it is inevitable. He says, we hope and seek rejuvena- tion and regeneration, but Spengler declares that we are hopelessly doomed, because when a culture has reached its "fellahin" period, it is bound to disappear, unless it is able to produce another culture. Now such a rejuvenation Spengler sees in Hasidism, which he designates "a second religiosity of the fellahin-culture." But how long does such a second culture, endure and when does it end? And why should there not be a third religiosity? In fact, the present Judaism possesses such a religiosity. We do not refer to the liberal Judaism, which cannot be regarded as a Jewish movement developed within Judaism, but carried into it from the outside. What is meant by the third religiosity is that founded by Samson Raphael Hirsch, a romantic-mystic Judaism, which if conducted into the right channels, is bound to take hold of Judaism, to fill it with a new spirit. Who knows, whether Zionism is not the pre- cursor of that Judaism, though at present it is at open war with it? Now we have followed Ziegler in fully accepting Spengler's interpre- tation of the rise and fall of the various cultures. But if he is right, the whole existence of man upon earth is without rhyme or reason and</page><page sequence="32">230 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW purely accidental; he comes and goes without any purpose whatever. If that is true, all religious conceptions of any creed whatever are mere fallacies. Judaism and its religious teachings are pure fiction and never had any reality whatever. If this is true, who cares whether it exists or disappears, as by right it ought never to have existed? And the same is of course true of all other creeds. If, however, Spengler's view is not true, and there is a Providence watching and directing the destinies of mankind, Judaism and the whole world may laugh at the methodical deductions of this scholar. As a matter of fact, there is no word of truth in Spengler's description of the disappearance of the past cultures. The culture of each nation disappeared because of having come into col- lision with some other culture. The culture of the Chaldean is a pure myth. The religion of the Neo-Babylonians was the same as that of Hammurabi. It disappeared because it came into collision with that of the Persians and of the Greeks. The disappearance of the Persian cul- ture was due to Islam; that of the Greeks and Romans was partly due to Christianity and partly to the invasion of the German and other bar- barian hordes; that of Egypt was affected partly by Christianity and partly by Islam; and the overthrow of the Mexican culture was effected by the Spanish conquest. All these destructions of the cultures were due to foreign influences, and not because they reached the age of senility and debility. The existence of a Faustinian civilization within Christ- ianity is a pure invention of Spengler, as it was invisible for the last thousand years. His conception of Judaism that it must perish on ac- count of-having reached its zenith is ridiculous, as it was never given a chance to reach its zenith and attain its full growth. For more than two millenniums it was forced to struggle for its existence. And it may in- deed be due to this continuous struggle that it survived all other nations. Spengler accuses the Jews that they remained untouched during the last millennium by all the problems of the Faustinian culture. How could it be otherwise, if the Damocles sword hung daily and hourly over their heads? Living under the Biblical curse: "In the morning thou shalt say: Would it were even: and at even thou shalt say: Would it were morning !' their only concern was the preservation of their existence. There is no fear that Spengler's prediction of the disappearance of Judaism will come true. According to the modern Biblical commentators a greater prophet than Spengler predicted the total destruction of Israel, Isaiah (6, 9-13). This prediction did not come true. This is not due to the fact that Isaiah was not a God-inspired prophet, but to the false interpretation of his message by the modern critics. This is exactly true</page><page sequence="33">SURVEY OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE-HOSCHANDER 231 of Spengler's prediction which is wholly based upon the erroneous con- ception of the modern critics. We may surely apply to them Isaiah's words: "Take counsel together, and it shall be brought to naught; speak the word, and it shall not stand; for with us is God." JACOB HOSCHANDER.
