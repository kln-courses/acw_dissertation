<plain_text><page sequence="1">IMAGES</page><page sequence="2">Editorial Divinity exists as much in a stone - as it does in the rivers, the mountains, the trees, the elements. The most primitive shapes of stones are enshrined, daubed orange and silver, worshipped with flowers and rice, before the sacred river or under the peepul tree. Offerings are made to the salagrama, the stone that rep resents Lord Vishnu, to the Shiva-linga, to the tulsi plant in the garden. What then is the needfor the image? According to Indian aesthetics, the image of the deity does not standfor itself. Its purpose is essentially symbolic: to remind us of another supra-reality. In the anthropomorphic image we can in no sense apprehend the true nature of divinity. When Durga bursts forth from a mountain, she is equipped with eight or ten or sixteen arms thatflail the air - attributes of the different gods who assist her, as in a moment of ineffable calm she slays the buffalo-demon. When the celestial goddess Ganga is conceived in clay or stone or bronze, the river seems to course through her veins. She embodies the whole of creation of life and the living. The deity is saguna: blessed with attributes as token manifestation of its di vinity and power. At the same time it can easily be nirguna-devoid ofany phys ical, cognate features. Some mystics sing with ecstasy upon the saguna aspect of the god; whilst others prefer to meditate on his nirguna aspect. Perhaps this is why the image can be left incomplete, deliberately unfinished, as with the image ofJagannatha, lord of the universe - to whom pilgrimsfrom all over the subcon tinent pay homage - who is yet nothing more or less than an archaic stump of painted wood. And yet, in a moment of supreme paradox, the image manifest is believed to be human and palpably alive-with ritual and prescribed hours for bathing and anointing the image, for clothing him andfeeding him for darsh an&gt; or the 'se eing' of the image, accompanied with chanting and prayers; andfor putting the child Krishna to sleep in a rocking cradle. That last touch of "creating " the clay image of the golden Durga is when the pupils of the eyes are painted in. Then she comes alive, to exist and be a part of the household. And when she leaves to be immersed in the river, people mourn her as they would the departure of a daughter of the home. Could anything be more fascinating, more paradoxical, or more truly human? The inherent complexity of these beliefs which nurture the image is the focus in the papers assembled. For the study of the image involves much more than a mere look at iconography. It is the totality of being, of seeing, of believ ing, of understanding. Â£</page></plain_text>
