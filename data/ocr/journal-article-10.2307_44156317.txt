<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE OCHRE COLOURED POTTERY: RECONSIDERING ISSUES AND PROBLEMS Deepak K. Nair Introduction The problem of the Ochre Coloured Pottery emerged with the findings of the 'copper hoards' over a passage of time. B.B. Lai is credited to have put these implements into archaeological context when he conducted excavations at Bisauli and Rajpur Parsu and found an ill- fired, thick, ochre washed rolled ware. The same pottery was unearthed by him in the lowest levels at Hastinapur excavations. This led him to christen this pottery as 'Ochre Coloured Potter' which is characterized by a peeling off of the ochre powder while handling. Since then a large number of sites have been reported in the upper Gangetic valley, the Sutlej-Yamuna divide which consists of the modern states of Punjab, Haryana and Delhi. From north-eastern Rajasthan also the so-called OCP sites have been reported in large number. Some of the sites have also been excavated such as Ahichchhatra, Ambkheri, Bargaon, Daulatpur, Hastinapur, Lai Qila, Noh, Saipai, Ganeshwar, Jodhpura and Madarpur.1 The OCP sites are generally very small in terms of area.2 The occupational deposit is also very less which ranges from 40 cm to 1.5 m. Most of the OCP sites have scanty material remains except the pottery which is found in relatively substantial quantity. Earlier the OCP was considered only as an ill-fired, fragile, and rolled pottery but later a good number of well slipped and painted pottery was also unearthed from some sites such as Lai Qila. A reconsideration the issues and problems of the Ochre Coloured Pottery For a long time the OCP sites have been understood in terms of a uniform archaeological entity called 'culture'. From such an understanding of the OCP sites itself, emanates a host of problems which leads to complicated and contradictory situations which involves various issues pertinent to the explanatory theorizing of archaeologists. In this paper, an attempt is made to bring forth the issues related to the OCP through the study of the history of archaeological research conducted so far and especially in recent times. Before getting into detailed discussion, some of the problems to be enumerated are the</page><page sequence="2">1 162 IHC: Proceedings, 73rd Session , 2012 identification of the OCP, association with the copper hoards, problem of its origin and association with other archaeological 'cultures', chronology, and the concept of an 'archaeological culture' which clubs together various so called OCP sites. Figure 1 : The extent of major excavated and explored OCP sites The Category of OCP It seems that one of the basic problems related to OCP is its very identification. As OCP sherds leave an ochre colour while handling, there is a general tendency to ascribe sherds to OCP when they are ill- fired and show signs of weathering especially in case of a state of bad preservation. It is the failure of some archaeologists to distinguish adequately between the aspects of a ceramic type which are related to its manufacture, function and stylistic variation and those which are related to its state of preservation.3 Due to this, in some cases pot sherds of Bara have been identified as OCP4 and sometimes some Harappan sherds of unrecognizable shapes have been called OCP. Even, H.D. Sankalia mistook the red pottery at Nasik, Jorwe, Newasa, and Navda Toli as the Gangetic red pottery in association with some copper implements.5 In fact, there is a very small percentage which looks like OCP in correct terms i.e. showing fading characteristics. At Lai Qila, the ochre coloured sherds account for only 10 percent of the total pottery. Therefore, in the absence of clear identification characteristics</page><page sequence="3">Archaeology ļ 163 such as the fabric and typology, there are chances of pottery being erroneously identified as OCP. The relationship with Copper Hoards The problem of the copper hoards runs parallel to the OCP; in fact it is the copper hoards which ushered in the OCP problem. Right from 1 822, 6 copper hoard objects have been regularly found all over India. Copper Hoards are generally comprised of flat, bar and shouldered celts, double edged axe, hatchet, rings and specialized objects such as antennae swords, hooked swords, hooked and unhooked spearheads, barbed harpoons and anthropomorphic figures. Among these, specialized objects are only found in the Gangetic valley of Uttar Pradesh and Haryana. The copper hoards have been generally found independently, not with any pottery. The problem arises here that they are found in the vast geographical area of Gangetic valley and are generally considered to be associated with the OCP. Due to this, if any pottery is found in the vicinity of the find spot of a Copper Hoard object, it is immediately labelled as OCP even if the find spot is located near the middle Ganga valley where there are no OCP sites.7 Lai and Gupta have suggested a possibility that the aboriginals of the Ganga valley were the authors of the copper hoard implements. The discovery of copper smelting activities and copper axes in a large number from the sites of Ganeshwar (Sikar, Rajasthan) and some other sites in north-eastern Rajasthan have given rise to the assumption that the source of the copper hoards is Ganeshwar including the Gangetic hoards as this is the region where copper smelting activities have continued from a time in distant past due to the readily available copper ore at Khetri. However, it has to be made clear that the copper hoard objects found at Ganeshwar are different from the specialized Gangetic objects. Ganeshwar copper objects such as thin blades, arrow heads, pins and fish hooks have not been reported from the copper hoards of western Uttar Pradesh. Similarly, specialized Gangetic copper hoard objects such as harpoon, antennae swords, anthropomorphic figures etc. are conspicuous by their absence at Ganeshwar and elsewhere in Rajasthan. The OCP authorship of the copper hoards is not beyond doubt. First at Mitathal, two copper rings and a celt were found in Period IIB which belongs to the late Harappan period. Two other copper rings and a barbed harpoon were also found without any stratigraphie context. Secondly, in recent excavations at Sanauli, a late Harappan burial site, two copper antennae swords and some copper rings have been found.</page><page sequence="4">1 164 IHC: Proceedings, 73rd Session, 2012 As far as the relationship of the Doab OCP vis-à-vis the Copper Hoard is concerned, it is still unaccounted for. Some sites such as Bisauli, Rajpur Parsu, Bahadarabad, Baharia, Nasirpur, and Madarpur have yielded copper hoard objects but their association to the OCP has been suggested on circumstantial grounds. In stratigraphie context, so far only Saipai has provided a definite evidence for copper hoard objects as being associated with the so called OCP. At thoroughly excavated sites such as Lai Qila and Atranjikhera no notable copper hoard objects have been found. Furthermore, the copper hoard objects are also not homogeneous. Types and sub-types can be found in all specialized copper hoard objects. For example, Madarpur has yielded strange anthropomorphic figures which are dwarfish and have no parallel in the Upper Doab sites. However, some copper anthropomorphic figures corresponding to the Madarpur specimens have been found in the Pithoragarh district of Uttarakhand. Therefore, it is not necessary that the so called 'OCP' sites are inevitably associated with the copper hoards, especially when the OCP itself is not a well defined entity. OCP and other Archaeological Cultures On the cultural affiliations and status as a separate culture of the OCP, different views have been expressed by different archaeologists. The OCP using people were considered as 'Degenerate Harappans' who in the late phase of the Harappan culture, due to the disturbances in the Indus-Saraswati divide, coinciding with the decline of the main urban centres migrated to the Ganga- Yamuna doab.8 On the contrary, some archaeologists held that OCP has its own status as a separate entity.9 Archaeologists such as Suraj Bhan, Dikshit, Gaur and Gupta categorise the OCP into two complexes.10 OCP of Upper Doab exhibits Harappan influence, whereas the OCP, found at the sites of Atranjikhera and Lai Qila located in the southern part of the Upper Doab, is almost free from the Harappan influence. Gaur11 considers that the pre- Harappan sites of Indus valley and Lai Qila are linked to each other. Y.D. Sharma12 classifies the OCP sites of Upper Doab into five categories: (i) Harappan (ii) Bahadarabad (iii) Atranjikhera (iv) Lai Qila (v) Saipai. Having said earlier that OCP was only a late varianl of Harappan ware, later he felt that the pottery from Bahadarabad corresponds more with Bara than the Harappan ware. According to R.C. Agrawala/3 the OCP is associated with the Ganeshwar-Jodhpura sites which can be dated as early as 3000-2800 BC. He also maintains that Ganeshwar-Jodhpura 'culture' is neither related to pre-Harappans nor to mature Harappans but it seems to belong to the 'indigenous' people of the Ganeshwar-Khetri region.</page><page sequence="5">Archaeology 1165 SahiI4also traces the origin of the OCP in the Ganeshwar-Jodhpura culture complex. According to him, the OCP /Harappan seems to have undergone phases of change and development. He visualises three phases namely pre-Harappan, Harappan and later. He recalls the findings of a microlithic chalcedony blade from Saipai and a small fluted core of chert and a blade possibly made of granite from Chandaukha. He prefers to place these sites in the pre-Harappan period. Moreover, by taking C14 and Thermoluminescence dates into account, he says, that Jhinjhana (2650 BC) and Hulas (3000 BC) shovy pre- Harappan phase. Harappan phase is shown by Hulas (2460 BC), Atranjikhera (2280 BC) and Lai Qila (2030 BC). Nasirpur represents the last phase. Here, in the absence of absolute dáting through radiocarbon and TL methods, placing sites like Saipai and Chandaukha on the basis on only two artefacts in the pre-Harappan phase is certainly implausible. Later, in a different paper Sahi15 divided the Mesolithic sites of Ganga valley and Rajasthan, Ganeshwar-Jodhpura sites, Gangetic OCP and the pre-Harappan sites in Pakistan in a chronological framework.16 He also links the occurrence of OCP like pottery in a pre-Kot Dijjan level at Jalilpur with the Hakra ware which is dated to 3700-3000 BC. However, it should be pointed out that in the Jalilpur report17 the OCP is identified as a rolled, under-fired pottery which is soft in texture. Certainly, here this pottery has been identified as OCP on its state of preservation as no typological study has been done. Apart from this, Sahi seems to overlook all the stratification and C14 and TL dates of some of the sites. For example, he puts Atranjikhera in the chronological period of 3600-3300 BC and Lai Qila in 3300-3000 BC but as far as the C14 and TL dates are concerned for the above mentioned sites, none of them fall in the period suggested by Sahi. Atranjikhera has five TL dates -1610 BC, 1 170 BC, 2280 BC, 1250 BC, and 2310 BC. Lai Qila has two TL dates- 1730 BC, 2030 BC. As it can be seen apparently that none of them is even near the dates suggested by Sahi. Further Sahi18 again equates the OCP with Ganeshwar sites and Hakra ware while using the term Hakra-OCP. Following Agrawala and Sahi, Dilip K. Chakrabarti19 concedes the OCP as an integral component of the regional village base of early Harappan derivation in western Uttar Pradesh while attributing the origin of the OCP tradition of Doab in the OCP tradition of the north- eastern Aravallis i.e. Ganeshwar-Jodhpura culture complex. Now the issue of Ganeshwar-Jodhpura and its relationship with the OCP can be taken for consideration. It has been understood for long that sites which have been reported from the north-eastern</page><page sequence="6">1 166 IHC: Proceedings , 73rd Session , 2012 Rajasthan also being to the OCP. However, excavations at Jodhpura and Ganeshwar and explorations in the districts of Sikar, Jhunjhunu, and Jaipur have yielded pottery which is reddish and pinkish in colour. This pottery is different from the Doab OCP. Subsequently, this pottery was labelled as the Ganeshwar-Jodhpura pottery and the region was labelled as the Ganeshwar-Jodhpura culture complex. It was actually based on a vague similarity of a few incised designs and its characteristics of leaving colour that the relationship between the Ganeshwar-Jodhpura pottery and the OCP has been surmised. Here, it is emphasized that although the region is in the proximity of the Gangetic Doab and could have been interacting in the past but as far as the chronology is concerned the Ganeshwar-Jodhpura pottery is much earlier than the Gangetic OCP.20 The Gangetic OCP also seems to have different vessel forms and suggests its distinction from the Ganeshwar- Jodhpura pottery.21 It can also be pointed out that in Rajasthan most of the reported Ganeshwar-Jodhpura sites have yielded evidence for copper smelting activities or copper objects but the sites of Gangetic OCP are almost devoid of copper and even if we take into account the circumstantial findings of Copper Hoard objects at the OCP sites then also they show no affinity to the Ganeshwar copper objects. Archaeological reports also add more confusion as they list the OCP and Ganeshwar-Jodhpura sites in Rajasthan separately, implying as if the two are different from each other. The sites of both contain similar material culture. From 1979-80 onwards the newly discovered sites were put under the name of Ganeshwar-Jodhpura sites whereas earlier they were put as OCP sites. Here, it is important to bring to notice that the listed OCP sites in Rajasthan gives the impression that it is akin to the Gangetic OCP which is otherwise not the case. The Problem of Chronology The determination of chronology is an integral part of the problem of the OCP. There are very few radio-carbon and TL dates on which a tenable chronology can be prepared. Except the radio-carbon dates of Jodhpura, only twelve TL dates from the sites of Atranjikhera, Lai Qila, Jhinjhana, and Nasirpur are available and they also show considerable variance. There is also a problem in the approaches applied to these dates as some archaeologists take the TL dates and radiocarbon dates as foolproof pieces of evidence. They select the early dates, even if two dates are available and coming from the same context. It is not viable to apply them as it is. At Jhinjhana, the archaeological deposit is only 60 cm but the dates provided by the site show a wide gap.</page><page sequence="7">Archaeology 1167 Therefore, it is que3tionable whether these dates are reliable from a site with such a meager occupational deposit. The Ochre Coloured Pottery as an Archaeological Culture In Indian archaeology, the understanding of an archaeological culture has been deeply influenced by the culture-historical approach. By examining the characteristics of assemblages of artefacts it is established that they share certain attributes, hence they constitute a particular culture. Archaeological research in India has laid emphasis on establishing the sequences of different cultures and preparing chronologies. This is achieved through the studies of stratigraphy in excavations in which successive levels of different occupations are labelled as different cultural phases. In the context of world archaeology, after V. Gordon Childe's initial steps to define an archaeological culture, David Clarke22 expounded the concept of ârchaeological culture in which he placed archaeological entities into a hierarchical classification. In his formulation of the hierarchy of archaeological entities, the attribute forms the lowest level which is followed by artefact, artefact type, assemblage, culture, and culture group. While recognizing that culture groups are clusters of cultures, cultures are clusters of assemblages, assemblages are clusters of types, types are clusters of artefacts and artefacts are clusters of attributes, he defines an archaeological culture as follows: an archaeological culture is a polythetic set of specific and comprehensive artefact types which consistently occur together in assemblages within a limited geographic area.23 Within this premise, the result of a comparative analysis of the pottery and artefactual assemblage done on the fourteen excavated and thoroughly explored OCP sites of Gangetic valley is important to discuss.24 The sites taken for analysis are Ahichchhatra, Ambkheri, Atranjikhera, Bahadarabad, Baharia, Bargaon, Chandaukha, Daulatpur, Hastinapur, Keshavpur, Lai Qila, Noh, Saipai, and Madarpur. The pottery comparison was carried out on the basis of pottery drawings published in various excavation and exploration reports. The rims and overall shapes of pottery forms were typologically compared. This analysis was also extended to the artefacts. The aim was to determine that to what extent the pottery and artefacts, of the OCP sites taken for analysis, are similar so as to put them in one single culture. In pottery comparison, under the categories of bowl, dish, dish- on-stand, basin, storage jars and vases it was found that very few types are similar and they occur at one or two sites.25</page><page sequence="8">1 168 I HC: Proceedings, 73rd Session, 2012 Moreover, the comparative analysis of artefacts revealed that there are certain common objects such as terracotta beads, pottery discs or worked sherds, terracotta sling balls, and bangles. Among stone objects, pestles and querns were found at some sites. In bone objects, styli and points were found. These objects are so common that they are found at every archaeological site ranging in time and space. So, they cannot be regarded as cultural markers. The other objects found do not show any parallel with any of the objects for example the brick sizes are very different from each other. Some of the objects showed affinity to the Harappan artefacts such as chert blades at Bargaon, terracotta cakes at Ambheri and Bargaon, weights at Bargaon and toy cart fragments at Madarpur. This shows that there is a considerable amount of dissimilarity in the pottery and artefact remains across the OCP sites. The main types of pottery has been enumerated by Dikshit26and followed by Tripathi.27 According to this classification some of the common types are: Jar with horizontally splayed out rim (Saipai, Lai Qila and Ambkheri) Basin with a splayed out beaked rim (Ambkheri and Lai Qila) Bowl with an everted rim (Atranjikhera, Lai Qila and Ambkheri) Dish-on-stand with a drooping rim (Ambkheri and Bahadarbad) Channel like spout (Atranjikhera, Ahichchhatra and Saipai) Handled pots (Atranjikhera, Lai Qila and Saipai) This classification too shows that these types have been found at only two or three sites which itself supports the argument that there is a very little similarity in the pottery types while the dissimilar types dominate among all proportions. The doubts on the OCP can be traced back to Ghosh.28 He raised his doubts about the OCP '... whether it represented one culture or many phases of one culture or there were several entirely different cultures altogether'. Sharma29 also says that Bahadarabad pottery had hardly anything in common with the pottery at Saipai and the OCP from Atranjikhera, Lai Qila and Jodhpura is almost a different class of assemblage. Dikshit30 also says that the OCP of Ambkheri is similar in fabric with the pottery of Atranjikhera, Saipai and Ahichchhatra but the forms are different. Similarly the pottery of Baharia and Saipai do not have any marked similarity. Agrawal and Kharakwal31 also express their apprehensions that "is there one or several OCPs? OCP has become an umbrella term under which all sorts of red wares have been included. Nobody knows which OCP variant was really associated with the copper hoards, if at all such an association is warranted".</page><page sequence="9">Archaeology 1169 The arguments in the paper prove that there is very little similarity in pottery across the OCP sites in the Ganga valley which constitutes a homogeneous geographical landscape. Hence, the linkages offered by many archaeologists also become questionable that the OCP is related to the Ganeshwar-Jodhpura complex, Hakra ware, pre-Harappan, late Harappan and so on. If the pottery across the OCP sites within a specific zone is not similar then how can it be comparable with any 'culture' as a whole group or as an 'archaeological culture'. Once again, with reference to OCP as an archaeological culture its concept can be re-examined. According to Clarke,32 "An archaeological culture is expressed by a set of specific artefact types and represented by a group of assemblages containing some of the artefact-types." The artefacts in the assemblage must match as specific artefact-types or sub-types. A low level affinity is not sufficient within a type group. Besides, it should involve as many socio-cultural aspects as survive such as pottery assemblages, metal object assemblages and so forth. At the same time, it is also maintained that despite being in a polythetic group wherein the entity does not necessarily possess all the artefact- types to claim the membership of a group, the component assemblage must share a large number of specific artefact-types with each other. Conclusion To conclude, the problems and issues discussed in this paper bring to our notice a note of caution that the reported Ochre Coloured Pottery sites cannot be seen from an impressionistic point of view wherein the problems are approached with an idea of the OCP sites as a uniform entity and any specific conclusion about any aspect of the OCP at a particular site cannot be applied to the whole gamut of so called OCP sites in general. Moreover, given the above mentioned criteria in regard to an archaeological culture on the one hand and considering the results of pottery and artefact comparative analysis on the other, the assemblages at OCP sites do not qualify as a uniform 'archaeological culture' because its assemblages have very little in common. They do not share a large number of specific artefact-types. In most of the cases the assemblages are different from each other and there is an absence of any regularity in occurrence of various artefacts. Thus, it calls for a thorough investigation of the so called reported OCP sites of different regions such as Rajasthan and western Uttar Pradesh so that all- inclusive nature of an archaeological culture named the Ochre Coloured Pottery and its common denominators can be defined properly and categorization of archaeological culture on the basis of pottery alone and that too on a single attribute, such as surface treatment, can be prevented.</page><page sequence="10">1170 IHC: Proceedings, 73rd Session, 2012 NOTES AND REFERENCES 1 .
