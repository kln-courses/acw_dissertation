While her Table 11.3 does support this conclusion, one can still question whether the phytoliths really are maize given the small samples of phytoliths present and the fact that wild forms do have both large and Type 1 cruciform shapes (albeit in smaller percentages). While the idea of finding maize in such early contexts poses no problem for me, I would be happier if a larger sample supported the conclusion. Given the ramifications of this interpre- tation, we should certainly be cautious in our assess- ment of its veracity. Piperno also evaluates whether the phytoliths might have migrated down in the soil from higher levels and concludes that it is unlikely. However, since Stothert is willing to accept the possibility that pollen might have migrated (p. 216), it is difficult to see why phy- toliths would not. Again, the inability to delineate dis- tinct occupation levels leaves such a possibility open. Finally, it is difficult to accept unequivocally that a stain in the ground in the form of a gourd is in fact the remains of one. Stothert should be lauded for attempting new kinds of analyses, such as neutron activation and strontium analysis, to evaluate the dietary contributions of plants and animals. The cautions concerning her interpreta- tions of cultigen use notwithstanding, the information on subsistence supports her general interpretation that the Vegas people were healthy, generalized hunters and gatherers, whose basic way of life changed little through time. In her concluding chapter, Stothert does three things: evaluates the popular hypothesis that climatic change was a force driving cultural evolution in this part of Ecuador, puts the Vegas culture in its geographic and temporal context, and develops a model to account for the evolutionary changes observed. Her arguments against climatic change are detailed and persuasive. One puzzle remains: What caused the 1,500-year hi- atus between the latest Vegas sites and the earliest Val- divia ones? Stothert is convincing in her arguments that Valdivia did evolve out of Vegas, and suggests that this evolution occurred somewhere other than on the Santa Elena Peninsula. Exactly where it occurred remains a mystery as does the reason for the apparent abandonment of the peninsula during the transition. Likewise, the origins of the Vegas culture are uncer- tain. Having eliminated (with good reason) all of Lan- ning's early Ecuadorian coastal complexes except Ve- gas in her evaluation of previous research, Stothert looks further afield. Noting the greater similarities be- tween the Vegas complex and coastal assemblages from Panama to Peru than to highland complexes, she sug- gests that the former are all representatives of an early coastal adaptation to a general Tropical Forest envi- ronment consisting of mangroves, estuarine, and flood- plain resources. While tending to think that this ad- aptation developed in lower Central America and spread south, she recognizes Donald Lathrap's alteInative hy- pothesis that it might have developed in Amazonia. Finally, Stothert does an admirable job of summa- rizing and abstracting a cultural system both out of the evidence previously presented and by drawing on eth- nographic studies. She makes the important point that, of all the Vegas sites on the Santa Elena Peninsula, only the Vegas site itself was occupied permanently, and it is the only site with burials. She provides an admittedly speculative model, based on Barbara Bender's work (World Archaeology 10:20F222), to account for how and why Vegas evolved into Valdivia. The model is based on the assumption that sedentism leads to sub- sistence intensification (indicated by the adoption of horticulture and a shift to greater reliance on marine resources) and increased exchange between groups to satisfy social necessities. This system leads to further intensification of production and the possible devel- opment of authority. She sees the subsistence changes from the Early to Late Vegas phases as indicative of intensification of production and suggests that the use of the Vegas site as a burial center in the Late phase supports the view that Vegas culture was becoming more complex. This system of cultivation, sedentism, exchange, and ceremonialism set the stage for the emer- gence of Valdivia culture. While I agree that Valdivia is probably related to Vegas historically, I am less con- vinced that the relationship developed in the way Stothert suggests. To her credit, she provides enough data to allow a reader to apply his/her own theoretical views to come up with an explanation for the changes seen. This book is reasonably priced and well worth the cost. The basic data presented on the preceramic way of life of the Vegas culture are important and provide a baseline for comparison to other areas. The research itself is a model of the utility of interdisciplinary in- vestigations. It is amply illustrated and well edited. Anyone with an interest in South American preceramic cultures will find this book required reading. Las piedras sagradas: Escultura prehispanica del oc- cidente de AIexico. EDUARDO WILLIAMS. E1 Col- egio de Michoacan, Zamora, 1992. 330 pp., 203 fig- ures, appendix. No price given (paper). Reviewed by Louise I. Paradis, Universite de Montreal. Las piedras sagradas is based on Eduardo Williams's doctoral dissertation, presented at the University of London in 1988. It is quite faithful to the original in demonstrating the qualities of a well-documented and organized thesis, though the required theoretical and methodological content is, at times, a bit too detailed for a book such as this. The main objective ofthe work is the documentation and interpretation of a corpus of small Prehispanic stone sculptures originating in West Mexico. In fact, two-thirds of the book consists of a catalog of photo- graphs and drawings (of disappointing quality) of these sculptures. The catalog is preceded by a table present- ing the 200 objects constituting the corpus as classified and studied by Williams. One of the main problems faced by this study is the fact that only a very small portion-we do not know how many-of the sculptures analyzed come from con- trolled archaeological excavations. Most of them are "casual finds" and were located in museums. The lack of context has forced the author to rely heavily on other lines of evidence to interpret his data. Formal classi-</page><page sequence="2">394 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 4, No. 4, 1993] fication and stylistic analysis of the sculptures, together with ethnohistorical documents and ethnographic analogy, are combined to make inferences coneerning the history of their development, their meaning, and their role in the society that produced them. Finally the volume contributes to a better understanding of West Mexico and its status in relation to Mesoamerica. The question of whether West Mexico is a subarea of Mesoamerica or a peripheral region with an indepen- dent history of development and a separate identity is explicitly discussed in a short chapter on the geographic and cultural framework of the research, and is ad- dressed again in the concluding chapter. The formal classification of the sculptures is based on attributes such as subject (animal or human), sex, and the position of the body and arms. Three groups are defined: anthropomorphic, zoomorphic, and an- thropo-zoomorphic. Each group is divided into sub- groups, and the subgroups are further classified into distinct variants. The details of the classification are not described here. Instead, we are referred to the ap- pendix where the information is summarized and this is just as well, as the details of this classification are not used in the analysis that follows. The objective of the stylistic analysis, which is dis- tinct from the formal classification, is to define a style or a series of styles characteristic of West Mexico; these, in tum, will help to establish their chronological or- dering, exteInal connections, and spatial distribution. Five styles are identified in the corpus, but the process of defining these is not described or justified. Style A sculptures are small figures with schematic or stylized traits. Style B is characterized by its geometric design; the face is square with the nose and the eyebrows in the shape of a "T." Style C involves realistic figures with anthropomorphic or zoomorphic details; they originate mostly from Michoacan. Style D also consists of realistic figures, and both Style C and Style D are meant to be viewed publicly. The last style-E-is rep- resented by schematic figures in which the body has a columnar shape. Unfortunately, no cross-references are made to the illustrations at the end of the book to help the reader understand these styles. The stylistic analysis is followed by a presentation of the chronological sequence of West Mexico and its connections to Mesoamerica. During the history and development of Mesoamerica, this cultural subarea de- veloped its own tradition. According to Williams, the historical connections were at their strongest during the Early Postclassic. Recent investigations in the area indicate that some specific representations, such as the chac mool and the tzompantli, that were to become an intrinsic part of war-sacrifice symbolism in central Mexico, originated in West Mexico. This well-docu- mented section raises questions about the definition of West Mexico as a subarea and its long-term relation- ship to Mesoamerica. However, it is only remotely related to the sculptural styles defined previously. Only Style D, which has a strong stylistic and spatial affili- ation with Michoacan, finds its place here. The longest and most interesting chapter deals with the iconographic study and interpretation of the sculp- tures. Again, the author remains silent conceIning the methodological steps that led him to identify the seven iconographical themes among the sculptures analyzed. The discussion and interpretation of these themes re- lies heavily, and sometimes indiscriminately, on eth- nohistory and analogy. Human heads are associated with decapitation. There are two examples of the sec- ond theme-human skulls. One is related to death, and the second, a double representation, is associated with fertility as well as death. The double figures are obvi- ously related to the concept of duality. The fourth theme is represented by anthropo-zoomorphic figures; they are interpreted as representations of supernatural be- ings that combine human and animal traits. This theme is extremely frequent in mesoamerican iconography and has a strong association with the concept of na- hualismo. The anthropomorphic brazier is interpreted as a representation of a deity related to fire, and ref- erence is made to the Classic-period incensarios with the figure of the old fire god, Huehueteotl. According to Williams, the identification of the sixth theme, fig- ures with horns, is problematic. Associations with the old fire god, the goddess of love, the god of duality, the god of the four directions, or the jaguar god from the interior of the earth have all been proposed. These figures could also be representations of hallucinogenic mushrooms and related to shamanism. Finally, they could also be related to the deer-maize-peyote com- plex present among the modern Huichol. The last theme consists of hunchback figures that are associated with sorcerers or, at any rate, with extraordinary individuals to which special powers were often attributed. An in- teresting reference is made to Nanahuatzin, the hunch- back god who sacrificed himself by jumping into the fire and who became the fifth Sun in Mexica cosmol- ogy. The last section of this chapter deals with the role played by sculpture in West Mexico and, I would add, Mesoamerica. The author has moved further and fur- ther away from the stone sculptures, but some of the ideas expounded are stimulating. Art in Prehispanic Mesoamerica is seen as a sacred or ritual activity re- lated to religion and magic. In West Mexico, the sha- mans were probably the most important religious lead- ers and thus responsible for the production of sculpture as a means of communication. Nahualismo, tonalli, hallucinogenic drugs, toads, and frogs are among the concepts or objects closely associated with shamanism that are represented in the stone sculptures. Thus the role of sculpture in West Mexico would be that of communicating information through sacred symbols. It could also serve to legitimize the political hierarchy and be related to the dead and the ancestors; the an- thropomorphic sculptures could thus have been rep- resentations of tribal ancestors. After reading this book, I would say that I did not learn much about stone sculptures in West Mexico but that I did learn about the current state of knowledge of this cultural subarea and about the art of making something of very little. While there is a lot of infor- mation in the book, many inferences need better ver- ification and some ideas need further development. But it surely is an excellent doctoral dissertation.</page></plain_text>
