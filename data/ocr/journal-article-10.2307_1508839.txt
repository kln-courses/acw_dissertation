<plain_text><page sequence="1">HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW VOLUME XLVI JANUARY, 1953 NUMBER 1 AUGUSTINE ON THE CREATION OF THE WORLD WILLIAM A. CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF RELIGION, YALE UNIVERSITY "In the beginning God created heaven and earth." FEW passages of Scripture intrigued Augustine as much as the first sentence of the book of Genesis. In the Confessions, in his treatises on Genesis, in the City of God, and elsewhere he dwells on it and recurs to it, as though he felt he could not exhaust its suggestions and implications. His reflections on this sentence are ample evidence of the acuteness, force, and fecundity of his mind. These reflections deserve attention not only as an index to the quality of his mind, but also because in his treatment of the sub- ject the main strands of his cosmology are knotted together. Time and eternity, nature and human history, body and soul, good and evil, - all these themes are developed and interconnected in Au- gustine's thought about the creation of the world. Two minor themes will appear as this study proceeds, namely (i) the role of Biblical revelation in Augustine's thought, and (2) the relation between Augustine the Neoplatonist and Augus- tine the Christian. These two topics are obviously connected, and our subject gives us a vantage point for getting some under- standing of both. A brief preliminary word about each may be in order. "In the beginning God created heaven and earth." Here, for Augustine, was a truth mediated by a particular historical tradi- tion with which he had identified himself. This truth he was not at liberty to ignore. With it he had to come to terms. Its claim on his mind was not the claim of a dictum of pure reason uncondi- tioned by historical experience. Nor was it the claim of a fact immediately presented in the course of his observation of the world. It was the claim of a historical revelation, with which he was confronted in the Bible.</page><page sequence="2">2 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW We shall see that Augustine took this sentence from Genesis quite seriously. It was for him a truth, not a fiction. It will be evident also that he took it in no simple sense, certainly not with a childish simplicity.' Its truth did not have for Augustine the kind of simplicity which puts an end to all questions. It was a productive truth, which made it possible to answer questions in a new and more adequate way. It was thus not a substitute for thinking. Rather, it stimulated thought by marking out a new direction for exploration. It was a source of truths, which illu- mined and set in a new and clearer perspective both the problems and all speculative attempts at their solution. In this way, from Augustine's point of view, the result of his acceptance of the Biblical revelation was a liberation, not an inhibition of thought. It is in this light that we should look at the relation between Neoplatonism and the Christian faith in Augustine's thought. The contrast between these two did pose a problem for him. As he saw it, the problem was not how to reconcile two systems by judi- cious selections from each, the selections being determined by a perspective more fundamental than either. His aim was neither synthetic nor eclectic. The problem was to understand his world anew from a perspective determined by the Christian faith. In particular, his task was to rethink the meanings of time and eternity, nature and history, body and soul, good and evil, in the light of the truth that God is the Creator. There can be no doubt that the mind he brought to this task had been formed by Neoplatonic habits of thought; the experi- ence he now had to reinterpret had been shaped by Neoplatonic ideals. One may indeed doubt whether he was completely suc- cessful in rethinking his world from the new perspective of Chris- tian faith. There can be little doubt that this was what he was 'There is in the way the Scripture speaks, says Augustine, a loftiness which mocks at the pretensions of the intellectually arrogant, and a profundity which frightens away those who are mere pedants (adtentos). By its truth, however, it feeds mature minds, and by its gentleness it nourishes immature minds. de Genesi ad litteram V, 3.

This was the pivotal movement of his mind as he reflected on the creation of the world. How fruitful this adventure of ideas turned out to be the reader must judge. Some may feel that had Augustine possessed an "out- line of modern knowledge" he would have been able to avoid some pitfalls. Some may wish he had kept to the low road of common sense and simple faith and had not at times taken the high road of speculation. Some may wish that in his speculation he had freed himself more from Neoplatonic ways of thinking. Some will read him through medieval spectacles. To judge him fairly, we should look at him as a man of the ancient world, traversing the intellectual terrain of that world, a terrain whose features shift subtly and profoundly as he comes to see them with new eyes. i. In the Beginning (a) Time and Eternity The words, "in the beginning," Augustine takes in two ways: they have a figurative meaning and they have a literal meaning. Figuratively, the "beginning" (principium) is the divine Word, the uncreated Wisdom, the eternal Son in whom and by whom God made all things.2 Literally, "the beginning" is the beginning of time. All things were made in the beginning of time. From this point of departure Augustine embarks on an exploration of the meaning of time and eternity, the results of which are profoundly original and suggestive. Notice first, Augustine's thought runs, that creation is not in time. It is "in the beginning." In the beginning of what? Augus- tine would prefer to say simply, "in the beginning." One may say if one likes that the world was created in the beginning of time. For as in Plato's myth,3 so for Augustine time comes into exist- ence along with the world. "Without doubt the world was not made in time, but with time." 4 Creation does not fall within that series of successive events, each coming to be and ceasing to be, of which time is the measure. Creation is not an act in time. Creation is "in the beginning." 2 Conf. XIII, v (6). ' Cf. Timaeus 38B. Sde civ. Dei XI, 6.</page><page sequence="4">4 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW For time is a measure of change, a relation among changing things. Who does not see that time would not have existed had not some crea- ture been made, which by some motion would bring about change, and that since the various parts of this motion and change cannot exist to- gether (simul), when one passes away and another succeeds it in shorter or longer intervals of duration, time would be the result? 5 Time is relative to changing things and exists where such things exist. Thus the original coming-into-being of the world of chang- ing creatures "begins" the temporal process and does not fall within that process. Creation is not in time but "in the beginning." Nor, since there is no time where there is no created world, did the creation of the world take time. It had no temporal duration. We should not take the Genesis story, says Augustine, in a childish way, as though God exerted himself by working. For he spoke, not with an audible and temporal word, but with an intellectual and eternal word, and the things were done." God "created all things at once,"' though, as we shall see later in this study, not all things were created in their present outward and visible forms. Living things were created in the beginning as "hidden seeds" and later, in the providence of God, came to exist in the way we now know them. Thus the beginning of the world and time, that is to say the coming into being of changeable things, was not itself in time. Nor did it take time. For creation is an act of God's will, and God's willing is not in time, nor does it take time. God is eternal. Wherefore it is not true that he wills one thing at one moment and another thing at another moment, but once for all, and all at once, and always, does he will all things he wills.8 Augustine thinks that the six days of the Genesis story are to be understood "in some other way" than as literal days, defined ' de civ. Dei XI, 6. Cf. also XII, i6. 8 de civ. Dei XI, 8. Cf. Ps. 148:5. 'de Gen. ad litt. VI, 6 (creavit omnia simul). Augustine quotes this Latin version of Ecclesiasticus 18:1 very often.

XII, xv (r8).</page><page sequence="5">AUGUSTINE ON THE CREATION OF THE WORLD 5 by the circuit of the sun.9 The story of the six days is a dramatic representation of what took place at once and as a whole. God created all things at once (or, together). The author of the account of the creation in Genesis at first presents the creation as a whole, and then its parts are described in order according to the mystic number of the days.10 These "parts" of the creation are not to be taken as temporal parts, one succeeding another in time; the things enumerated in temporal order in the story were all created "together," without any intervals of duration or periods of time." The creation of the world did not have any temporal duration. It did not take time, nor was it in time. God created the world "in the begin- ning." What was God doing before he created the world? A hoary answer to this ancient puzzle was that God was preparing hell for those who pry into mysteries. This answer John Calvin was later to approve,12 and thus demonstrate a deficiency both in patience and in finesse. Augustine, more charitable and more sen- sitive to the problem, however crudely stated, rejected this short answer and took the question more seriously. The real problem behind this crude question was stated more clearly by Immanuel Kant. Kant said it is a natural tendency of the mind to conceive that since the beginning is an existence which is preceded by a time in which the thing is not, there must have been a preceding time in which the world was not, i.e., an empty time.13 And since in empty time nothing can come to be, it seems that the world has no beginning. This problem Augustine is willing to face quite frankly and seri- ously. His answer is in effect that empty time has no real mean- ing. Time has meaning only in relation to changing things.

He says, If by the term "heaven and earth" all the creation is understood, I confidently say that before God made heaven and earth he was not making anything. . .. But if someone's flighty mind wanders back- ward through semblances of times, and wonders that thou, omnipotent and all-creating and all-sustaining God, maker of heaven and earth, shouldst have refrained from such a work for innumerable ages before thou didst make it, let him wake up and start to think, because he wonders at false things. For whence could innumerable ages pass by which thou didst not make, since thou art the author and founder of all ages? Or what times should there be which were not founded by thee? ... If however before heaven and earth there was no time, why is it asked what thou wast doing then? For there was no "then" when there was no time.14 So it is meaningless to speak of a time when the world was not. Any "then" we can conceive presupposes some changing thing and hence the existence of a creation. However far we may remove such a "then" into the past, we still think of some changing thing when we think of a "then." "There was no 'then,' when there was no time." Hence the world has existed throughout all time. Does this mean the world has always existed? Yes, if "always" means "at all times," then the world has always existed. To say that the world has always existed, and also to say that the world had a beginning, is not to fall into a contradiction, if "always" means "at all times." For time began with the created world, and there was no time "before" the created world. Augustine returns to this conclusion when he ponders another theological puzzle, namely "what God could be the Lord of, if there was not always some creature?" For he dares not speak as if "the Lord God was ever not Lord," that is to say as if there had not always been some responsible creatures who acknowl- edged God as Lord. Among the many thoughts that occur to his mind, the one that pleases him best is that the angels have at all times been subject to God. For, as we shall see later, man was " Conf. XI, xii-xiii (14-15). Cf. also VII, xv (21).</page><page sequence="7">AUGUSTINE ON THE CREATION OF THE WORLD 7 created in the beginning "potentially" and later came to have his present form, whereas the angels belong to that "intellectual heaven" which was created perfectly formed in the beginning. And if this is so, then they have existed in all time, for time came into being along with them. And who will say that what was in all time, was not always? God therefore has always been Lord of creation, and there has always been a creation over which God is Lord."5 At this point Augustine has to defend his suggestion against the charge that if the angels have always existed, then they are co-eternal with God, which would obscure the contrast between God and his creatures. His defense is that this contrast is not between what is earlier and what is later in time. It is a distinction between what is unchangeable and what is changeable. God's eternity is his unchangeableness, and in this sense the angels are not eternal. What God created is not co-eternal with him, since he existed before it, although at no time did he exist without it, preceding it not by some passing duration but by an abiding per- petuity.-6 God is "prior" to the world not by precedence in the dimen- sion of time, but by his eternity. By eternity Augustine does not mean an indefinite extension of time. He can say that the angels "always" existed but are not eternal. The past "eternal times" of which even the Apostle Paul speaks are not co-eternal with God.17 By eternity he means unchangeableness. The world of created things including the angels changes; God does not. In God there is no passage; the created world and all things in it are in passage. Thus to say the world always existed would in no way blur the real contrast between God and his creatures. 15 de civ. Dei XII, i6 (I5 in NPNF). He says he fears if he makes this reply he may be accused of recklessness, therefore he does not make it as a positive assertion. But his hesitation is not at saying there was no time when there was no time. He says it would be utter foolishness to deny this. His point is that the suggestion about the angels is speculation beyond what is clearly taught in Scripture. It is plain that as far as speculation goes he is inclined toward this suggestion. 16 de civ. Dei XII, 16 (15 in NPNF). 17 de civ. Dei XII, I7 (16 in NPNF). Cf. Titus 1:2.</page><page sequence="8">8 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW Nor dost thou by time precede time; otherwise thou wouldst not precede all times. But thou precedest all past times by the sublimity of ever-present eternity, and thou surpassest all future times, because they are yet to come and when they come they will be past; "thou however art the same and thy years fail not." 18 When therefore we find Augustine speaking, as he often does speak, of a "past" before the world was made, or of the nothing- ness in which things were "before" they were created, we must understand him to mean by these terms a "precedence" not by time but by eternity. The contrast between God and the world should not be described in such a way as to suggest a being who existed at a time when other beings did not exist. For not even the "merest simpleton" would say there was a time when there was no time. It is rather a contrast between an unchangeable being and changing beings. This contrast between time and eternity to which Augustine's thought has led him presents him with a knot he cannot untie. He is confronted, as ftienne Gilson says, with two modes of being which are not homogeneous but heterogeneous. We are subject, even in our thought, to the law of becoming. How then can we represent to ourselves the mode of being of that which is unchange- able? 19 Here is a problem indeed, and for it Augustine has no answer. What is worse, he is committed to saying that this un- changeable being, which he cannot adequately represent to him- self, creates, knows, and administers a world of changing things. At this point Augustine is frank to say that no analogies can really help us. For example, he considers an analogy from the singing of a familiar psalm. As Augustine sings the psalm its parts succeed one another from beginning to end, yet while singing each of the parts he knows the whole of the psalm. But far be it that thou, creator of the universe, creator of souls and bodies, far be it, that thou shouldest in this way know all things future and past. Far, far more wonderfully and in a far more hidden way dost thou know them.20 " Conf. XI, xiii (16). Cf. Ps. 102:27 (101:28).

XI, xxxi (41).</page><page sequence="9">AUGUSTINE ON THE CREATION OF THE WORLD 9 How an unchangeable being can have any real relation to changing beings remains a mystery. What Augustine does is to locate the mystery, so to speak, and confess it. Now if we take seriously what Augustine has said so far - if indeed a created world has "always" existed, so there was no time when the world was not - then what meaning remains for the phrase "in the beginning"? It would seem that instead of explaining the phrase Augustine has explained it away. (b) The Meaning of History At this point some may say there are two Augustines. There is Augustine the Neoplatonist, and there is Augustine the Christian dogmatist. The former could have easily dispensed with the notion that the world had a "beginning." The latter, in retaining it, bowed blindly to the authority of the Scriptures. This inter- pretation would miss the point and distort the facts. In his thought about the creation of the world there is only one Augustine. This is the Augustine who found in the Bible a truth which illumined his experience and therefore became normative for his thought. This can be discerned in his treatment of the Neoplatonic and Stoic theories of history. We shall see how the truth he found in Genesis enabled him to articulate a different theory of the mean- ing of history from theirs, a theory which has since been woven into the fabric of western culture. We shall see also that the force of this truth for Augustine was in its suggestive power. In the eleventh book of the City of God Augustine takes issue with the Neoplatonic view of God and the world. At first it seems that he quarrels with the Neoplatonists because they say the world always existed and was not created in time. But this can hardly be the point of his attack. For a little later in the same book this is precisely what he himself says, as we have seen, after explaining that time "began" with the creation. As his argument develops we see that his real quarrel is with their view of the history and destiny of the soul. The point Augustine wishes to drive home is that an under- standing of the soul and its destiny requires a realistic view of history. What he is attacking is the Neoplatonic conception of</page><page sequence="10">10 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW time as a flux of shadowy forms in which there can be no de- cisively novel events. He is opposing their devaluation of the historical character of the world. His argument is that since the world, and within it human history, had a "beginning," it is a process within which novel and decisive events can and do occur. There are in this process events which never occurred before, and such events decide the future in a real and effective way, so that the same events could never recur. The Neoplatonists, Augustine supposes, do not wish to say that the soul is co-eternal with God. For then they could not ex- plain why the soul is now in a state of misery in which it was not before. If on the other hand they say that the soul ceaselessly undergoes an alternation of states of happiness and states of misery, they land in absurdity. For in each state of so-called happiness, either it would foresee its coming misery, or it would be deceived. In neither case could it be truly happy. The way out of their dilemma, says Augustine, is to recognize that both the soul's entry into its present state of misery, and its entry into a future state of happiness are novel and decisive events. The misery which is the soul's present lot, he says, is a "new misery" which the soul had not experienced before; it is not a repetition of what the soul suffered in previous incarnations, as the Neoplatonists suppose. Likewise the happiness to which the soul looks forward, which will free it from its present misery, means that something new, and that an important and splendid thing, happens to the soul, which never in a whole past eternity had happened to it before.21 Augustine knows the Neoplatonists hesitate to say there is genu- ine novelty in history because they fear this would contradict the unchangeableness of God. But this fear is unfounded. The appar- ent dilemma, "God is unchangeable and history is unreal" or "God is changeable and history is real," is not a true dilemma. Augustine sees another possibility: God is unchangeable and his- 'de civ. Dei XI, 4. Cf. also X, 30; XII, 21 (20 in NPNF). Augustine excepts Porphyry, who acknowledged that the soul which found the happy life did not lose it again, and at this point "abjured the tenets of his school" (XII, 21).</page><page sequence="11">AUGUSTINE ON THE CREATION OF THE WORLD 11 tory is real, for God created the world and with it time "in the beginning." If therefore the Neoplatonists will acknowledge, as he thinks they must, that the soul like number has a beginning but no end and for that reason, once having experienced miseries, if freed from them will never afterward be miser- able, they will certainly not doubt that this is done with the abiding immutability of the counsel of God. Let them then in like manner believe that the world could have been made beginning with time (ex tempore), and that notwithstanding this fact God did not change, in making it, his eternal counsel and will.22 For if the soul can have a real history, though God be eternal, so can the world. The process of history is not a mere reflection of timeless forms, a shadowy process in which no decisive changes are effected. Like the number series it has a beginning but no end.23 It cannot run back or stop. In it something is decisively achieved. Yet, because God's creative act is not itself in time but "in the beginning," the unchangeableness of God is not called into question. In this argument against the Neoplatonists we have an example of the way Augustine uses the truth brought to his mind by Gene- sis. "In the beginning God created heaven and earth." It is an instrument for detecting the fundamental defect in the Neoplatonic view of the world, wherein the history of the world, and particu- larly the history of the soul, becomes infected with unreality. And it is a source of illumination, suggesting that the eternal God wills that new things come to pass in the course of time. Similarly Augustine confronts the Stoics, who held that the history of the world consists of ceaselessly recurring cycles of events, that for example just as in that [past] age the philosopher Plato taught disciples in the city of Athens and in that school which is called the Academy, so also the same Plato and the same city and the same school and the same 22 de civ. Dei XI, 4. 23 Though the drama of human life on this earth will have an end (cf. de civ. Dei XX, 7), this will be the end of the age (saeculum) but not the end of time. Presumably, time will exist as long as there are changing creatures.</page><page sequence="12">12 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW disciples had been repeated through innumerable ages before, at long but determined intervals, and through innumerable ages thereafter are to be repeated.24 Augustine cannot believe this. For once Christ died for our sins. But rising up from the dead he dies no more, and death will no more have dominion over him. And we after the resurrection shall be ever with the Lord.25 Nothing, he says, more thoroughly explodes the theory of recurring cycles of history than the fact of the eternal life of the saints.26 There are events in the history of the world - for example the fall, the crucifixion, the resurrection, our entrance into everlasting life - which happen once for all. Of these events, in the theater of the cosmos, there are no repeat performances. Such events never occurred before and will never occur again, for they decide the future. Historical time therefore proceeds not in circles but in a straight line. It proceeds in a straight line because it has a "beginning," as a circle does not. The Stoics, like the Neoplatonists, had been concerned to main- tain the immutability of God. They had argued that, since the world must have always existed, and since there must be a finite number of things in the world (for they said not even God's knowledge could comprehend the infinite), there must be recurring cycles of the events in which these things are combined. It is sig- nificant that in his argument against the Stoics Augustine does not deny the world "always" existed. Nor does he deny the im- mutability of God. What he denies is their view of God's knowl- edge and their conclusion about the nature of history. Here Augustine recurs to the analogy of the number series. The series of historical events, he says, is like the number series in that new members of the series continually succeed earlier ones. Yet this does not compromise the immutability of God by requir- ing that God should have new thoughts, because Sde civ. Dei XII, 14 (13 in NPNF). 25 de civ. Dei XII, 14 (13 in NPNF). Cf.

Their misconception of perfection, namely their assumption that God's perfection requires that the world be a finite completion, has led them to deny the genuine novelty and decisiveness of historical events. Contrary to their view Augustine says, "The divinity can make things which, not to himself but to the world, are new." 28 God can begin a "new work"; he can make "new things"; he can make his later works novel and unlike what went before them. Yet in all this he acts with the same eternal will. He brought it about by one and the same everlasting and immutable will that the things he created formerly did not exist, as long as they were not, and that afterward they did exist when they began to be.29 God is eternal. We live in a world in which genuinely novel and decisive events occur. Of this world God is creator. Augustine found it possible to think these three thoughts together, and to understand each in the light of the others. He was led to think them together by the truth he found in the Bible. "In the begin- ning God created heaven and earth." It is notable that in neither of these confrontations with non- Christian views of history do we find Augustine's faith either in conflict with his reason or irrelevant to his thought. There are not two Augustines here, one blindly accepting the Bible, the other thinking as a philosopher. There is one Augustine, who finds in the Bible a new perspective and a new illumination of the meanings of time, history, and eternity, an illumination his thought must then explore and communicate. We should not suppose that Augustine's exploration of these problems was conclusive and final, either for him or for us. I de civ. Dei XII, i9 (i8 in NPNF). Sde civ. Dei XII, 21 (2o in NPNF).

Here as elsewhere his thought moves with a constant sense of the mystery of the world and God. Nor were these problems posed for him in quite the way they are posed in our time. For example, some modern philoso- phers, unlike the Neoplatonists and Stoics, question whether tem- poral events may not be in some way new for God as well as for us, so as to require a new definition of the unchangeableness of God. In summary, how does the notion of a "beginning" of the world function in Augustine's thought? It does not mean the world was created in time, for time was created with the world and not be- fore it; hence the creation has existed at all times. Nor does it mean, on the other hand, simply that the world is dependent on God for its existence, for many ancient philosophers had said this, as Augustine well knew, without supposing a "beginning." Its function in Augustine's thought was to open to him a way of under- standing and saying that though God is eternal, time is real, and that human history is neither a dream-like appearance of eternity nor a perpetual cycle in which nothing is new. History is made up of events which are both new and decisive, as a "beginning" is new and decisive. For it is the eternal will of the creator that in these events something real should be accomplished. 2. Heaven and Earth In the beginning God created heaven and earth. Augustine is unwilling to "strive about words" in interpreting "heaven and earth." By these words various things may be understood and yet all be true. He takes them to mean the "intellectual heaven" and the "formless earth." 30 The intellectual heaven is not the visible firmament. It is the perfectly formed realm of angels, the spiritual creation which is superior to all things save God. For the angels, though changeable creatures and hence not co-eternal with God, have a certain par- 30 Conf. XII, xiii (16).</page><page sequence="15">AUGUSTINE ON THE CREATION OF THE WORLD 15 ticipation in eternity. "By incessantly and unfailingly cleaving" to him, they enjoy perpetually the vision of God. This intellectual heaven which God made in the beginning is near to God. The formless earth is "near to nothing," though it is not nothing."1 This "formless earth" is not the visible world; it is that "matter" from which all bodies, including the firmament, were formed. It is near to nothing because it is entirely unformed and without quality, though from it the qualities we perceive are formed. It is what the Greeks called iXj."32 This formless matter is the principle of change, not that it is an efficient cause of change, but in that it is the condition of change. Just what it is in itself Augustine finds it difficult to say. For the changeableness of changeable things is itself capable of all forms, into which changeable things are changed. And what is this changeableness? ... If one might say, "a nothing something," an "is, is not," I would say, this is it. Yet it already had some sort of being, so that it was capable of receiving those visible and compound forms.33 Plato would have said we apprehend it by a "bastard" kind of thought, though we are compelled to think it. We should not think that God first created this formless matter and then, later in time, formed it into particular visible things. He created all things together: the intellectual heaven, the form- less earth, and the visible world. All things were created at once. God's works were not made of previously existing matter, but of matter concreated, that is created at the same time by thee, because thou didst give form to its formlessness without any lapse of time. For since the matter of heaven and earth is one thing, and the visible form of heaven and earth another, thou madest matter of absolutely nothing, but the visible form of the world from unformed matter, yet both together, so that the form followed the matter with no interval of time.34 3" Conf.

But not all things were created "visibly and actually." The living things which inhabit the earth were created "potentially or causally" in the form of "hidden seeds" or "seminal causes" (rationes seminales). From these seminal causes, or "reasons," they were to be brought forth later, in the providence of God and in due time, in the visible forms in which they are now known to us. So the world may be likened to a tree, which develops in the course of time from its beginning in a seed. Just as in that seed there were together (simul) invisibly all the things which would in time develop into the tree, so the world itself is to be thought to have had together - since God created all things to- gether - all the things which were made in it and with it when the day was made, not only the heaven with the sun and the moon and the constellations . . . and the earth and the abysses . . . but also those things which the water and the earth produced potentially and causally, before they should arise in the course of time in the way we now know them, through those operations which God carries on even till now.36 These seminal causes placed in the world in the beginning were not ordinary seeds or germ cells. They were "hidden" seeds, potentials or matrices from which when the circumstances were appropriate individuals of various species would be brought forth. The species would then be propagated according to their kind.37 For example, Augustine thought that human beings as we know them have not existed from the beginning of the world. The human race as we know it began to exist in the course of time. Man was created in the beginning not in his visible form, but "invisibly, potentially, causally, in the way in which things yet to be (in contrast to things which already exist) are made." 38 Conf. XII, xxix (40). Sde Gen. ad litt. V, 23. Cf. M. J. McKeough: The Meaning of the Rationes Seminales in St. Augustine (Washington, Catholic University, 1926); E. C. Messenger, op. cit.; and C. J.

VI, 6.</page><page sequence="17">AUGUSTINE ON THE CREATION OF THE WORLD 17 Man was made in the beginning potentially, to be given actual form and visible existence "in his time." 39 The seminal causes, according to Augustine, ordinarily give rise to living things according to determinate natural laws. That whole ordinary course of nature has what one might call its own natural laws, according to which even the spirit of life, which is a created thing, has what one might call its own appetites determined in some way, so that even the evil will cannot go beyond them. And the elements of this corporeal world have their established power and quality, defining how much each one will flourish or not, and what may or may not become from what. Just as from these origins are all things which arise, so, each in its own time and of its own kind, they enter upon their comings forth and progressions and limits and decreasings.40 Still the supernatural intervention of God in the course of events is possible, though this intervention is not contrary to the poten- tialities God created in the beginning. Above, however, this natural movement and course of things, the power of the Creator has in itself ability to act concerning all these things otherwise than their seminal causes, as it were, have - though this is not something he did not put into them [as a possibility] that it might be accomplished, at least by himself. For he is omnipotent not by thoughtless power, but by the strength of wisdom, and he does concerning each thing in its time that which he made in it before, that it might be possible for him.41 9 de Gen. ad litt. VI, 8. In the City of God Augustine argues against those who hold that the human race always existed. He says, "From the sacred writings we compute that six thousand years have not yet passed since the institution of man- kind." XII, ii (io in NPNF). Dods' translation in NPNF is misleading since he leaves out an equivalent of ab institutione hominis. It seems probable that Augustine is not here arguing that the world is less than 600o years old, as the editor of NPNF, J. E. C. Welldon in his edition (London, S.P.C.K., 1924), and V. J. Bourke: Augustine's Quest for Wisdom (Milwaukee, Bruce, 1945), p. 265, all seem to suggest. Later in the same book of the City of God Augustine says, "I confess I am ignorant what ages passed before the human race was instituted" (17-16 in NPNF). Augustine was inclined to think that the human soul was not created "causally" but "actually" in the beginning, later to be united with man's body, though he was aware of the difficulties attending this view. Cf. de Gen. ad litt. VII, 22-28, 33; Bourke: op cit., pp. 232-236; Messenger: op. cit., pp. 177-178; and McKeough: op. cit., p. 87. He was torn between "creationism" and "traducianism" as explana- tions of the origin of the souls of subsequent human beings. " de Gen. ad litt. IX, I7. 1 de Gen. ad litt. IX, I7.</page><page sequence="18">18 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW Finally we should notice Augustine's warnings against crude and anthropomorphic images of God's act in creating heaven and earth. Let us not understand the creation, he says, as do the "little ones and carnal" (who are not to be despised, though they are weak in understanding), who think that God like a man, or like some powerful being, faced with an immense difficulty, did, by some new and sudden resolution, make heaven and earth outside himself, as if in a distant region.42 As there is no time before the world, when God might have existed and the world did not, so there is no place beside the world, where God might be exterior to the world.43 God does not make the world as a carpenter makes a chest, because the carpenter is out- side the chest and fashions it from without, but God, infused into the world, fashions it, being everywhere present he fashions it, and does not withdraw to some other place. Nor does he, as it were, handle from without the mass which he fashions. By the presence of his majesty he makes what he makes; by his presence he governs what he made.44 3. Out of Nothing Following a tradition which had long served the church as a weapon against the Gnostics, Augustine finds in the Scriptures 45 the teaching that the world was created from nothing. By this he does not mean that there was a something, which is called "nothing," from which the world was made. He is not hypostatiz- ing. He means what he says: "Thou wert, and nothing was there besides, from which thou createdst heaven and earth." The world was not made from God, as though God took some of his own substance and from it fashioned the world. Nor was it made from anything else. There was, and is, nothing else beside God and what God made. Unlike man, "God had no need of any 42 Conf. XII, xxvii (37). 4 de civ. Dei XI, 5.

XII, vii (7).</page><page sequence="19">AUGUSTINE ON THE CREATION OF THE WORLD 19 material he himself had not made, to assist his omnipotence." 47 The world was brought into being out of nothingness. No more than in the case of "in the beginning" did this "out of nothing" remain an inert and inhibiting foreign body, so to speak, in Augustine's mind. It functioned for him as an illum- inating and liberating truth. This can be seen in two instances; first, his defense of the goodness of the body against the Neoplatonists and the Manichaeans, and second, his attack on the Manichaean view that the soul is of the same substance as God. At the root of many of the errors of the Neoplatonists Augustine finds an aversion from the body. The "Platonists," says Augus- tine, unlike the Manichaeans do not detest our present bodies as evil by nature. For they attribute all the elements of the visible world to God as maker. Nevertheless they think that souls are so affected by the earthly body and its death-infected members, that from this source come the diseases of desires and fears and joy and sorrow in which . . . all the viciousness of human life is contained.48 This aversion from the flesh is itself "fleshly," for "these feelings arise from human fancy, not from divine truth." It prevents the Neoplatonists from confessing the truth of such Christian doc- trines as the resurrection and the final glorification of the body. This aversion from the body which Augustine notices among the Neoplatonists is connected with an ambiguity about the form- less matter which enters into the composition of all changeable things. Plotinus, for example, spoke at times of this formless matter or "non-being" as "the first evil," even though this was not consistent with some of his own principles."4 Since, for Augustine, the world is made from absolutely nothing, even this formless matter was created by God, concreated with " de nat. boni 27. 48 de civ. Dei XIV, 5. 4 Cf. Enn. I, viii, 3, 14; II, iv, 16; and W. R. Inge: The Philosophy of Plotinus (London, Longmans, 1918), v. I, p. 134. Porphyry reported that Plotinus was ashamed of being "in the body." Plotinus, nevertheless, does not assert that non- being (7r, u 7 ~ ), which he distinguished from "absolutely nothing" (oiK tiv), is intrinsically evil so clearly and consistently as 1tienne Gilson seems to suggest he does.

And since all that God made is very good, even this formless matter is good. Thus Augustine is enabled to be clearer in mind and firmer in conviction as to the goodness of all that is not nothing than Plotinus seems to have been. The notion of creation from nothing clarified and strengthened Augustine's affirmative vision of uni- versal good. Hence the body is not of itself evil, or even a "clog to the soul" as the "Platonists" say. It is not the body, but the corruptibility of the body, that is burden- some to the soul. . . . [For] the soul is burdened, not by any body whatsoever, but the body such as it has become in consequence of sin.50 And though the healthy and strong man feels heavier to other men carrying him than the thin and sickly man does, yet the man himself moves and carries his own body with less feeling of burden, when he has the greater bulk of vigorous health, than when his frame is reduced to a minimum by hunger or disease. . . . And who can explain in words how much difference there is between the present state we call health and our future immortality? 51 Nor are our souls locked up in our bodies as a punishment for evils done in some previous existence, as the Neoplatonists say. "The soul is rather given to the body that it [i.e. the soul] may do good things." 52 Therefore the goal of life is not to escape from the body, but that the body as well as the soul should be saved from corruption and pass from sickness to health. We should of course remember it was from the Neoplatonists themselves that Augustine had caught a vision of the goodness of all beings of whatever nature. What we now notice is that the notion of the creation of all things from nothing enables Augustine to clarify and maintain this vision, and to guard against the Neoplatonic flight from the bodily and the historical. When we turn to Augustine's treatment of the Manichaean view of the body, the contrast is even more striking. One might say the conception of creation from nothing completes Augustine's liberation from Manichaeanism, which Neoplatonism had begun 50 de civ. Dei XIII, 16. 51 de civ. Dei XIII, 18. 52 de civ. Dei X, 30. Cf. also XXII, 24, and de doctrina Christiana I, 24.</page><page sequence="21">AUGUSTINE ON THE CREATION OF THE WORLD 21 before he became a Christian. Certainly it is clear in his anti- Manichaean writings that this conception seems to him of funda- mental importance in his argument. The Manichaeans supposed that there is "some evil nature, brought forth and propagated by its own principle" in opposition to God.53 This evil nature is matter. Hence bodies formed of matter are evil. All flesh is the work of the evil principle. But, says Augustine, this is not true. It is God alone who created from nothing all things both spiritual and corporeal. Hence matter is not something opposed to God, or contrary to God's will, for he created it. Hence bodies made of matter are not by nature evil and recalcitrant to good. Because God created both matter and bodies from nothing, and their natures are due to him alone. Therefore, as the apostle says, we should glorify God in our bodies. The Manichaeans should learn that all natures God made and established are ordered in degrees of excellence from the highest to the lowest, and that all are good, though some are better than others, and that they all were made of nothing, though God their maker made use of his own wisdom, so to speak, to give being to what was not, and that as far as it had being it might be good, but that as far as it was deficient, it might show that it was not begotten of God, but made by him from nothing.54 This passage gives us a second illustration of the way the notion of creation from nothing functioned in Augustine's thought. That the body is created from nothing, not from some evil matter, means the body is good. That the soul is created from nothing, not from God's own nature, means the soul is limited, changeable, and fallible. The Manichaeans said the soul is not created by God but begotten of God and is thus of God's own nature, and therefore, they thought, contrary to the evil principle in matter. This view of the soul, says Augustine, contradicts the soul's own witness to its nature as a changeable being, capable of falling away from the good, whereas God is unchangeable and unchangeably good. The Manichaeans do not do justice to the facts. "3 de civ. Dei XI, 22. 5 contra epistulam fundamenti, 25. Cf. de nat. boni, i8.</page><page sequence="22">22 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW Let them think, in Christian sanity, that the soul, which can be changed for the worse by its own will and be corrupted by sin, and thus be deprived of the light of unchangeable truth, is not a part of God nor is it of the same nature as God, but has been made far different from its maker.55 It is true that the soul is created in the image of God, but it cannot be of the same nature as God. We know ourselves too well for that, his thought runs. Let us not deceive ourselves. We are not parts of God, nor are we begotten by God, so that we have his nature as a child has its parent's nature. We are created by God from nothing. Both body and soul therefore are created by God from nothing. Since they are created by God they are, in their natures, good, for all that God creates is good. What alone is not from Thee is that which is not, and the motion of the will from Thee, who art, to that which is less than Thee, because such motion is a fault and a sin.56 Since body and soul are created from nothing they are, unlike God, changeable and capable of corruption. In these ways the image of God's creation of the world from nothing meant for Augustine an illumination of his experience and a liberation from restrictive and confusing categories of thought. It also left him with a problem, just as the conception of the unchangeableness of God had left him with the mystery of the relation between eternity and time. Here the problem is in some ways an even more serious one. It is as follows. In creating, if God creates from nothing, God is absolutely unconditioned by anything other than himself. Likewise the things created are not conditioned, in their natures as created, by anything other than God. Thus it becomes difficult to see how, if God is perfectly good, any motion away from God could have arisen in any of his creatures. 55 de civ. Dei XI, 22. 56 Conf. XII, xi (II).</page><page sequence="23">AUGUSTINE ON THE CREATION OF THE WORLD 23 4. "And behold, it was very good" The creation was very good, both in reason and in result. The reason of the creation was simply this, "that the good God pro- duced good things." God was not driven by any necessity to create the world, for instance a necessity of doing so to repulse the evil power which, according to the Manichaeans, warred against him.57 There are others, Augustine says, who unlike the Manichaeans do indeed believe in God as the only source of all things, and have yet refused to accept with a good and simple faith this good and simple reason for the creation of the world--Origen, for example. For Origen believed that this world was created not for the production of good things but for the restraint of evil, so that souls might be assigned to diverse stations in the universe and to diverse bodies as prison-houses, according to their respec- tive merits. How could a man "so learned and so well versed in the literature of the church" have thought these things? 58 Even Plato had seen that "the most sufficient reason for the founding of the world" was "that by the good God good works were made," whether he had learned this directly or indirectly from Genesis, or whether he had, "by his quick-sighted genius, perceived the invisible things of God, understood through the things which are made." 59 As in its reason so in its result, the creation is very good. This not only God but also man can see. Thanks to Thee, O Lord. We behold the heaven and earth. . . . We see . . . this space of air through which wander the fowls of heaven between those waters which are borne in vapors above them, and in clear nights distil down in dew, and those heavier waters which flow along the earth. ...

We behold on all sides a moist element, replenished with fishes, beasts, and birds. ...

These things we behold, and they are severally good, and altogether are very good.60 Augustine's thought about the creation of the world amounts to a searching and persistent exploration rather than a finished theory. And it is not surprising that we find, in his writings on the subject, unresolved tensions, unsolved problems, and con- stant confessions of mystery. The old wineskins of classical and Hellenistic thought were strained, like all other philosophical systems have since been strained, when the wine of a new insight was poured into them. Nor was Augustine's handling of Scripture altogether free from bondage to ecclesiastical tradition, for example his treatment of the formation of Eve. His confessions of confrontation with mystery certainly should not surprise us, when we consider the sort of questions he was asking, though they should not lead us to underestimate his intellectual courage. Only a false humility, which is timidity in disguise, talks of the limitations of the mind before those limits are reached. But it is misleading to say for example, as F. R. Tennant does, "When the beginning of Time is dealt with, Augustine and, later, the schoolmen rely on revelation rather than philosophy." 6 First, because just at this point I find the contrast between Augustine's treatment of creation and that of Thomas Aquinas most striking. Second, because of the more general suggestion that there is something intrinsically unphilosophical about Augustine's reliance on the Bible. Augustine was a man who early in life had begun to think for himself, and he did not stop thinking when he became a Christian. When he became a Christian he began to think from a different viewpoint, and we have seen how from this new viewpoint he came to have a new understanding of his world. This new under- standing was the product of thought, though certainly of thought guided by a new vision. In other words it was for Augustine genuine, though partial, understanding, not acquiescence in unintelligibility. ' Conf. XIII, xxxii (47). 1 Philosophical Theology (Cambridge University, 1930), v. II, p. 132.</page><page sequence="25">AUGUSTINE ON THE CREATION OF THE WORLD 25 It is true that Augustine relied on the Bible in the sense that he found there a new direction for his thought about the world and God. It is misleading to suggest, as Tennant seems to do, that this reliance was more external and unthinking, less con- cerned for clarity and comprehensiveness in thinking, that is to say, less "philosophical" in this sense, than reliance on Plotinus or on Plotinus' vision would have been. It could be argued that Augustine, in his thought about God and the world, was no less philosophical than Plotinus, though the thought of each proceeded from a different initial vision. Without such a vision philosophy tells no tales about the world. The new truth Augustine found in the Bible, which both fulfilled the promise of Neoplatonism and superseded it, was that God is the Creator of all things in heaven and earth. This new vision of the creativity of God was, in one sense indeed, the end of a search, but in another and more important sense, as I hope this study has illustrated, it was for Augustine a new beginning.</page></plain_text>
