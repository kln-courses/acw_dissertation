<plain_text><page sequence="1">Jozef M. van Brabant Bad Debts and Balance Sheets in Transforming Eastern Europe It has been clear from the very inception of the transitions in the eastern part of Europe1 that something drastic should be done about the economic legacies of communism in general and the "old debts" of state-owned production units in particular. Oddly enough, whatever policy measures have been embraced since then have by design sought to come to grips with these "most urgent" issues far more slowly than the sense of emergency originally imparted. Furthermore, none of the planned economies in transition (PETs), including those apparently committed to real transformation policies,2 has thus far come up with a comprehensive strategy on how to address the issues at hand. This is at least paradoxical. But progress is being made in a gradual, largely ad hoc manner, particularly in the PETs that are more advanced with the transition agenda (Gray 1993; Lamdany 1993). The main purpose of this paper is to examine whether it would have been useful to tackle the issue of "bad debts" head-on from the very start of transforma tion policies, and why this maneuver could not, in fact, have been implemented in any PET for economic, and evidently many other, reasons.3 The discussion begins by defining the debt problem and placing it in the framework of the transition agenda, including the real situation with markets in these countries. Next the basics of how markets operate are recalled. This is followed by a discourse on the key nature of interenterprise and bank debts and the problems posed by this type of debt for formulating the transition's agenda, and indeed for realistically progressing with it. The relationship between assessing the debt and transformation policies forms the next topic. Thereafter, the main proposals that have been made to come to grips with this conundrum are examined and contrasted with what would appear feasible, given the key features of a realistic transition agenda. The conclusion recapitulates the proper way in which the debt problem should be analyzed for remedial treatment in serious policy debates.

Inasmuch as the vast bulk of loans granted under administrative planning were extended only within the state and cooperative sectors, these are literally liabilities of one economic agent in the socialized sector to another, hence granted largely for reasons embedded in the logic, including abuses, of degenerative administrative planning. The problem should accordingly be tackled against this backdrop, particularly now that new decision-making arrangements rank high among policy priorities. Many observers of the PETs have argued that the state should quickly come to grips with outstanding debts essentially by "taking over," socializing, or confiscating these loans in some form. The main purpose would be to enable both state-owned enterprises (SOEs)4 and banks, possibly newly established (Phelps et al. 1993), henceforth to function on their own account without being burdened by legacies from the past, for which, in most cases, the indebted economic entity as such was not responsible?but neither were the new govern ment or the rejuvenating society! Nonetheless, the proffered, ostensibly clean and encompassing, solutions seem to render the problem deceptively tractable (Begg and Portes 1992, p. 20; OECD 1992, pp. 48-50), almost as if the magical pencil and eraser of the classical accountant of yore could simply "doctor" the books with impunity. Of course, the problem is not quite that straightforward. That reality must necessarily be identified fully within the context of the needs for the whole society, including the economy, within the context of the PETs' aspirations and core features. Many of these and related nostrums of policy advice to PET governments have focused on the narrow financial tangents of the core transition problems, just as others have tended to zero in selectively on issues pertaining to privatiza tion, stabilization, liberalization, or the myriad of other tasks of the transition agenda, usually one at a time. At least implicitly, all assume that markets exist or that they will spring forth quickly, in an all but spontaneous manner, upon liberalization of prices and market access, as if "the market" were a given artifact rather than a social construct itself (Brabant 1993a, 1993c). At the same time, it is assumed that one can deal with the financial problems besetting the state owned sector almost in isolation.5 It is one of the "absolute necessities" that advisers have tended to label as "most urgent," hence deserving of priority attention on the part of transition managers. The advice to PET policy makers has essentially been a choice among three alternatives. One is the simple wash-out: confiscate all deposits of state-owned entities and offset them against all liabilities, the net result being added to (in</page><page sequence="3">MARCH-APRIL 1994 7 case of net assets) or subtracted from (in case of net liabilities) the new state's remaining wealth portfolio. A second has been for the state to take over the "bad debt" of financial institutions by issuing in exchange state obligations that pay a fairly high interest rate and can, in principle, be negotiated in secondary markets, thus providing a more solid buttress to permit financial institutions to engage in "real" lending. Finally, the state could leave the bad assets and liabilities in place by allowing financial institutions to drive a sizable wedge between borrowing and lending rates, the differential being kept largely to build up reserves against bad debts and liquidate them eventually through enterprise restructuring in which the bank becomes "actively"6 involved. Though the "bad-debt" problem has not been ignored in most PETs, few if any have thus far resolved the issue, let alone peremptorily through one of the enumerated routes after the political revolution, as detailed in section 6. Not only that, they have at least tacitly condoned the aggravation of the problem by imposing high nominal interest rates, by allowing banks to continue to serve their "best" customers, and by acquiescing in the buildup of arrears by SOEs, including in relations among themselves. This stark contrast between rhetoric and real choice is paradoxical, at the very least. And an illuminating explanation must encompass more than lack of insight in what needs to be done on the part of the managers of the PET's agenda. The seeming contradiction can be resolved only against the broader backdrop of the transition agenda and transformation policies. Only then will it become clear that cleaning up the "old debt" simply cannot be an isolated component of transformation policies. On the contrary, it is but one, albeit in some cases a critical, element of a much more convoluted economic, political, and social situation in which unsettling uncertainty is very pervasive. This extends to the nature and size of the debts as well as to the reaction of the polity at large to measures that domestic policy makers may seek to embrace. Once the problem is placed within this context, the proper questions up for genuine debate can be formulated in a different light. As such, they yield other policy recommendations than those one finds throughout the burgeoning literature on transition economics. The phrasing of the questions and explanations have, of course, implications for the way in which managers of the transition can realistically come to grips with the "old debt," as discussed in section 6 below. Section 2: The Transition Agenda and Forging Constructively Ahead Much of the politics and economics of the transition agenda, and indeed the formulation of transformation policies regarding bad debts, has been couched in terms of "shock therapy" and "gradualism." Let me simply note that "shock therapy" for the kind of policies entertained under that label for PETs is a misnomer of sorts (see Brabant 1993c for details). Shock therapy, in contrast</page><page sequence="4">8 RUSSIAN AND EAST EUROPEAN FINANCE AND TRADE to presumed gradualism, typically implies the simultaneous and rapid deployment on all fronts of all relevant categories associated with the transition. These include the selection of sequencing, speed, comprehensiveness, intensity, and sectoralism in at least four broad ranges of policy issues. First of all, there is the need for macroeconomic, stock and flow, stabilization. Second, in contrast to the previous administrative planning systems, which had already degenerated by the time the political "revolutions" (see Poznanski 1993) careened around the corner in 1989-90, the accent has been on liberalization of domestic and foreign markets, including fostering a rapidly expanding private sector largely from new domestic (and perhaps foreign) savings. Third, arguably most emphasis has been placed on privatizing state-owned assets, including other forms than sheer divestment through sales or giveaways.7 Finally, any transition agenda must come to grips with the need for "institution building" or erecting the framework within which market-based decisions can be taken and political choices voiced in a transparent, predictable, reliable, and comparatively inexpensive manner. Resolving the bad debt is a key element of stabilization, of creating incentives and control instruments in liberalization, and of moving ahead with the divestment of state assets; it also helps to solidify institutions, particularly the essential vestiges of as yet poorly functioning financial markets, but positive action will be required to strengthen corporate and financial governance (Phelps et al. 1993). By contrast, gradualism connotes an approach involving a good deal of atten tion to appropriate sequencing of the various components of the policy package of stabilization, liberalization, privatization, and institution building. Sequencing inevitably affects other attributes of the policy package, unless one postulates an omniscient wise man capable of conceptualizing the entire range of issues pertaining to the transformation of degenerated administrative planning with a broad panoply of legacies from communism. Given the four interlocking domains of the transition strategy and their five qualifiers (speed, sequencing, comprehensiveness, sectoralism, and intensity), one could set forth a four-by five matrix in which the various options available to policy makers are laid out. Some cells will have only one option, suggesting the need for either speed or gradualism. Others will have several, leaving the choice of moving ahead faster or slower to the way policy makers perceive their room for policy maneuver. As I have shown elsewhere (Brabant 1993c), the realistically feasible policy menus suggest that, in practice, the distinction among the issues that can be done quickly, those that must be done quickly, and those that cannot be done quickly will, at best, remain artificial. In sum, the paramount issues of policy making for the transformation of the Eastern societies are twofold: to establish a credible program for transformation policies, and to create and maintain popular support for its implementation, including for correcting adversities if and when they occur rather than letting them fracture an already fragile sociopolitical support base. On both counts, a good measure of pragmatism and the ability to reconcile</page><page sequence="5">MARCH-APRIL 1994 9 multiple conflicting demands for policy makers' attention, while sidestepping conflicts?that is, through good governance (Brabant 1993a, 1993b)?will be inevitable; pragmatism is not, of course, identical with adventurism, arbitrariness, or doomsday gradualism.8 In this context, can a transition program be credible without tackling the nature of the "old debt"? An answer can be constructed only once the environ ment within which such a restructuring must necessarily be enacted and the nature of these debts are clear. Let me briefly touch upon both issues by referring to the real core error committed by "shock therapists." This derives from a threefold implicit assumption. One argues that with price and market liberaliza tion all economic agents henceforth submit to hard budget constraints or are placed in bankruptcy and liquidated with minimal delays; that state institutions are strong enough to ensure proper restructuring of fiscal revenues (Hussain and Stern 1993), including from the emerging private sectors, and will be amenable to undertaking the indicated structural changes; and that enterprises begin to shed excess labor and encourage the remaining labor force to raise productivity rather rapidly, perhaps in conjunction with new capital investment (Aglietta and Moutot 1993, p. 71). Many observers do recognize that at best one can now expect economic agents to work "for their own account" within an emerging market-economy framework. But they then conveniently gloss over the fact that the qualifier "emerging" is a highly generous way of characterizing the full reality of markets in PETs, including in commentaries on how best to tackle the "old debts." The second implicit assumption refers to quick privatization. This policy recommendation is based on many different considerations. But two implicit ones are paramount. One is taking the old-style political powers and their various interest groups, including the nomenklatura, out of the decision making about resource allocation. This is indeed an urgent task that should be executed as rapidly as possible if the new political leadership has the clout and acumen to do so. But as events in the East suggest, their credibility with the electorate is at best fleeting and at worst not very robust. So at best limited, negotiated progress can be made in this regard. The other implicit assumption maintains that upon the assignment of property rights to private owners the latter will foster more efficient use of their resources and thus bolster factor productivity. This is unlikely to be the case for the vast bulk of assets, which are concentrated in operations where owner management cannot come about without entailing gross inefficiency, where owners' control can be exerted at best very weakly, and where dispersed ownership leaves management in place essentially intact and thus able to continue to manage resources mainly in its own interest. Finally, it is implicitly assumed that much of the burden of the transition can be offset through foreign assistance and government resource redistribution. If true, this is a weighty consideration in formulating how best to come to grips with the economy-wide ramification of transformation policies. Otherwise, it is a</page><page sequence="6">10 RUSSIAN AND EAST EUROPEAN FINANCE AND TRADE pernicious red flag resting on, at best, incompletely validated conjectures. Indeed, to the extent that foreign assistance will fall short of the resources required to offset the transition's burdens, the perimeter for policy choice is determined by the degree to which a sociopolitical consensus?the rock bottom of adjustment pains that can possibly be inflicted9?can be mustered and main tained. Unless these limitations over time are clearly reflected in policy making, moving ahead with the core issues of the transformation, including resolving the existing problem debts, is virtually unfeasible, and the PETs will have to continue to muddle through their present sociopolitical calamity. Because none of the PETs decided to come to grips with the enterprise debt as it existed on the eve of the political revolution, the problem confronting policy makers consists of two components. On the one hand, under the communist regime debts were contracted, since the 1960s mostly via one or a few state banks, to support SOEs according to criteria that, on the whole, were well out of truck with market conditions. That is not to say, however, that credits under the anciens regimes were granted for reasons unrelated to the economics of adminis trative planning. That domain of discourse was simply different from a market environment, particularly at the extremes of decision making. Those debts are now part of the portfolios of the so-called commercial banks. With the creation of a two-tiered banking system either prior to the political revolutions or in conjunction with the first steps along the transformation path, the larger commercial banks were established from branches of the central bank. In other words, they were endowed with a portfolio of assets and liabilities accumulated largely on administrative grounds. Old debts, thus, bear little relationship to how an enterprise will perform under new, emerging market conditions. That includes the ability of firms to service the debt or to do so while at the same time moving ahead with restructuring in line with market disciplines and incentives. Likewise for the banks: with their present endowment and ability to mobilize resources, they are largely hamstrung, condemned to continue lending chiefly to their core clients in the hope that soon some solution can be found to the de facto insolvency of the majority of them. Because the old debts are essentially a legacy of communist-style planning and its convoluted aftermath, two problems exist. One is that bad debts need to be removed from the books or their resolution needs to be entrusted to a specially created state-owned debt-resolution agency. At the same time, barring private initiative, the state needs to issue special financial assets in exchange for the debt to be serviced out of future fiscal revenues. This would recapitalize the banks to some extent and thus enable them henceforth to discharge their critical inter mediating role in moving ahead with the transformation agenda. The other component of the type of debt under discussion has arisen in reaction to overly stringent monetary policies and other aspects of the, at times thoroughly experimental, transition policies pursued by the managers of the PETs. SOEs have granted each other credit simply by not honoring obligations,</page><page sequence="7">MARCH-APRIL 1994 II thereby leading to a very rapid escalation in involuntary arrears. Similarly, SOEs have increasingly violated their loan obligations to banks. But the really volatile component in several PETs has been indefinite deferment of delivery obligations rather than explicit violations of loan obligations (for Russia, see Pitiot and Scialom 1993, pp. 148-50). The latter has continued during the first years of the transition in part because of bad policing of what is ostensibly still state property and, where it is not, an inadequate legal infrastructure to enforce bankruptcy or political apprehension about massive bank and enterprise failure. Furthermore, existing banks have on the whole continued to lend to their established customers? by and large the less solvent SOEs with whom the banks had built up firm relationships over an extended period of time. A third component of debt should, in fact, be added. In many PETs, inflation at the transition agenda's inception all but destroyed the real value of debts inherited from the communist regime. Because of substantial interest rates levied on arrears thereafter as well as punitive penalties for delinquency (Slay 1992, p. 36), however, the outstanding debts have been piling up rapidly (Calvo and Kumar 1993) if arrears and tax delinquency are duly taken into account?as they should be, contrary to what some suggest (see OECD 1992, p. 49). True, in many cases interest rates have remained negative in real terms, thus reducing the real present value of the debt, whether inherited or on account of arrears. However, given the marked deterioration of the financial strength of many borrowers due to the transition depression, it is not clear whether the ostensible reduction in the measured "real value" of an enterprise's debt really signals a better ability to service the outstanding debt. Where real interest rates have been positive, the "old debt" has continued to soar?of course, when arrears are properly capitalized. In any case, it is only in countries where interest rates for this type of debt have remained low (and will continue to be held down) in spite of inflation that the stock of debt inherited from communist planning has all but resolved itself. Section 3: The Market as Transformation To formulate realistic policy options in full awareness of their implications, and indeed to fathom the rationale for the policy course chosen, one must be crystal clear about the "quality" of the markets extant in the PETs. This determines the role they can conceivably play in the short to medium run. At the very least, the commentator must recognize that competition, market, and private ownership are not synonyms. In mature market economies, all three may coexist; indeed, one may be necessary for the other(s) to function. But until that occurs, the various aspects are best kept separate, at least conceptually. A market essentially encompasses a set of manmade institutions (Kregel 1990, p. 45). It is not, and cannot be, an immutable part of the natural environ ment parachuted at some point from the heavens. However desirable it may be from the point of view of the neoclassical paradigm or aspirations of policy</page><page sequence="8">12 RUSSIAN AND EAST EUROPEAN FINANCE AND TRADE makers, no existing market can be transplanted lock, stock, and barrel in record time without causing severe dislocations that may then lead to the autonomous crystallization of "the market." In some cases, the transplant may be rejected altogether. In most instances, the graft will lead to a mutation resulting from the inevitable adjustments and reconciliation pangs. If only because of these considerations, various market configurations exist. Each comprises specific institutions that let the forces of competition unfold. The latter provide a constraint on self-interested behavior of individual agents, channeling it into a confined range of mutually compatible outcomes. Those that do not enjoy this attribute as per the evaluation of participants will induce some agents to change the institutions that form the market and allow the forces of competition to resume operating. This action will be initiated either by those benefiting from or by those disadvantaged by the outcomes that do not conform to the established market institutions. In some environments, such adjustments can be introduced smoothly. Elsewhere, they may be feasible only after protracted debate and, continuing the metaphor, perhaps involved environmental alterations. In other words, the market's virtues derive from there being competition guided by self-interested behavior of economic agents in such a way as to produce a limited set of acceptable outcomes, which are thus classed as coherent or mutually compatible (Kregel 1990, p. 47). Where competition cannot now be attained, a proper regulatory framework or the internalization of the decision-making process through either strict state ownership or the owner-manager will be required. Moreover, mechanisms must be put in place to allow dynamic adjust ments to occur with minimal obstacles. This, too, will be a gradual maturation process rather than a wholesale constitutional rearrangement. In all this, it should be clear that, as an organizational and coordinating mechanism, markets are not cost free and that private transaction costs are manifestly not zero or negligible (Dunning 1992). Just as perfect planning is a chimera, the operation of markets for which information in the broad sense is perfect and available without cost is of trivial interest. The real world is riddled with imperfect and asymmetrical information. Moreover, gathering and processing this information is costly. As a result, cases in which the neoclassical paradigm might even approximately hold are at best rare. In practice, even to create and sustain reasonably functioning, rather than "perfect," markets, some burdens will have to be borne by society at large over a considerable stretch of time. These include the creation of a legal framework for the identification, protection, and enforcement of contracts pertaining to all kinds of market-based transactions. At times, as in societies that have a particular proclivity for litigation, reliance on explicitly detailed contracts with spelled-out pecuniary costs and benefits leads to increased dependence on laws, lawyers, litigation, insurance, and codified procedures for ostensibly market-based contracts that elsewhere are handled with a greater degree of trust in partnerships. In any case, the stylized "facts" of neoclassical economics rarely hold. As a result, efficient resource allocation,</page><page sequence="9">MARCH-APRIL 1994 13 here understood as the maximization of the sum of the discounted values of consumer and producer surpluses (Hay 1993, p. 2), will have to be pursued under circumstances where one or more markets may be absent or be functioning only poorly. Improvements can be sought, of course. The key questions, then, are: "How can quickly functioning markets be erected?" and "What should be done in the interim to mitigate transitional market failures?" In the real world of PETs, market failures must be endemic as endowments over which agents have property rights and the specifics of marketing and production technologies are hardly such that atomistic competition among economic agents solely bent on maximizing their profit or utility can be presumed to emerge. PETs must re-create markets almost from the ground up, in the process remilling their most essential nuts and bolts. Indeed, these economies cannot gloss over the need to innovate or resuscitate the basic institutions of the market economy, including setting private property rights; creating a solid financial infrastructure, perhaps even stock exchanges and other securities markets; establishing private enterprises and commercializing SOEs, and eventually divesting most of them; erecting the constitutional infrastructure for property rights and for how best to protect them legally; establishing the rule of law and enforcing it; embracing the principle of profit-oriented activities; motivating human attitudes and behavior into accepting income and wealth differentiation; and so on. None of these features was present in the PETs at the time of the political revolutions. In many respects, little progress has since been made. Many of these aspects will not sprout spontaneously. Rather, they require an activist state, particularly during the earlier phases of the transition. This complements the role of the state in tackling the type of market failures familiar from mature market economies (provided government failure will not exacerbate matters) as well as coming to grips with the allocative failures attributable to the lack of some markets, and poorly functioning markets otherwise, for some considerable time to come in the PETs. Moreover, the natural order of things is based on interdependence. There will hence be hysteresis effects associated with what is now done well or badly (Pickel 1992). Even once "normal" markets will begin to function, policy makers must heed the prevalence of scale economies, externalities, and increasing returns that, if not corrected for, will distort market outcomes. Also, monopolies and oligopolies exist and may need to be regulated through other than pure market channels (Willig 1993). There are, furthermore, a host of public and semipublic goods (and bads) that the market will not provide, or will provide inadequately (or produce in surfeit). Questions may even arise with respect to the tradeoffs between efficiency and equity that the market, left to itself, would at best inadequately address.10 These realities, which are found in all markets some of the time and in some markets all the time, have profound implications for the formulation, eval uation, and implementation of alternative public policies. In the absence of basic preconditions for competitive market allocation for</page><page sequence="10">14 RUSSIAN AND EAST EUROPEAN FINANCE AND TRADE some time to come, regulation in various forms can provide a useful intermediate format until new market-based mechanisms can be innovated and solidly anchored. It can do so, too, when considerable constraints on perfect competi tion, asymmetries of information, restrictions on the ability to contract, limits to designing comprehensive incentive rules, and other real-life features prevent the emergence of perfect competition (Stiglitz 1993; Willig 1993). In any case, an adequate framework must be put in place with a view toward seeking to mitigate market failures (both technical and in the sociopolitical sense once a consensus has been reached) through a host of devices. Note that seeking such relief through nonmarket intervention is warranted only when the latter is not itself subject to failure that exceeds the dimension of the market distortion to begin with. And such intervention need not mandate the state to produce goods and services. Any such assignment with all its attributes need not be indelibly etched in granite forever. A market economy cannot function well without there being properly functioning markets for goods and services, as well as production factors, notably capital and labor, and hence the importance of completing the transfor mation processes simultaneously. The real challenge for PET policy makers, then, is that the entire infrastructure for market-based decision making is in statu nascendi. As a result, decision making can for now be efficient only in a restricted sense. Furthermore, it is as yet uncertain how quickly functioning markets can realistically be innovated. But some are likely to become operational sooner than others. In the meantime, emerging markets are bound to exhibit shortcomings. As in the mature market economy, notably capital markets will continue to violate the conditions for optimal allocation. The key question that thus arises is whether markets should be complemented with other instruments, policies, and institutions, perhaps through an industrial policy and good (eco nomic) governance. One can hardly avoid a positive answer if it is recognized that there are market failures that do not necessarily coincide with government failures, provided a minimum of governance capabilities can be mustered, including the ability to divest the government of tasks that, as the transformation proceeds, can be better executed elsewhere, as per a pragmatic subsidiarity rule (Brabant 1993a, 1993b, 1993c). In any case, sustainable development requires broader guidance mechanisms and incentives than either the market or the central plan can impel upon individual agents, regardless of the degree of government interference designed to correct market failures. At the same time, market institutions need to be maintained and upgraded, including through proper governance; hence the critical role of how the state can best discharge its responsibilities. Likewise, a crucial role may accrue to government in helping identify, and at times foster, the foundations of a growth path that is sustainable over the long haul. Also, these features of the uncertainty and unwarranted expectations of more desirable alternatives whose real implications will become visible only over time form part of the initial conditions.</page><page sequence="11">MARCH-APRIL 1994 15 In other words, the choice of policy package in the four dimensions and with respect to the five attributes invoked earlier is not a function of choosing shock therapy over gradualism, or the other way around. Rather, the ability of a PET to pursue credible changes depends crucially on the nature and strength of its economic, political, and legal institutions; on its social cohesiveness and tradi tions; and on the conditions prevailing at the start of the transformation process. These factors will obviously differ among countries and will thus determine the speed at which economic forces and institutions can realistically be transformed. Note that credibility in the sense invoked signals not solely policies that are credible but also policies that can be implemented and sustained in a credible way (UNECE 1993, p. 7). Moreover, the really urgent task of transforming the PETs is the identification of a new, self-sustainable growth path that over a protracted period of time is expected to generate sufficient economic wealth to persuade the electorate at large now that key planks of the transformation agenda can and will be delivered upon. It is unlikely that such a new endogenous growth mechanism will become available in a wholly spontaneous manner once macroeconomic stabilization will have been regained and the basics of privatiza tion and liberalization will have been put in place along with the building of institutions. Section 4: The Paramount Features of the Enterprise Debt Although it may be trivial to recall how the assets and liabilities of the PET shaped up on the eve of the big transformation agenda and have evolved since then, it is important to be absolutely clear about the distinction between stocks and flows; the swapping between stock and flows that could be envisaged; and the relationship between stock and flows involving debt and wealth that will have to be transferred if the core items of the transition?working toward a pluralistic political setting and a largely market-economy framework anchored to private property?are to be carried out in an orderly fashion. Recall from the earlier discussion that it is in the very nature of transforma tion policies that: (1) uncertainty is rampant, not only as concerns economic policy but also as concerns the value of assets, the reliability of commitments made by the former communist regime, technology, ownership, and a myriad of other facets inex tricably associated with, and indeed produced by, societal change; (2) expectations among economic agents regarding assets and liabilities of these stocks and flows are very volatile; they are in part dependent on the credibility of policy commitments and on how the transformation agenda shapes up along with progress in implementing genuine transformations; (3) because expectations of various layers of society differ, shifts in the role of agents affect the appreciation of risk and uncertainty, including the value of stocks and flows of assets whose ownership for now is unclear;</page><page sequence="12">16 RUSSIAN AND EAST EUROPEAN FINANCE AND TRADE (4) it is by no means evident which "old debts" are bad and hence must be tackled in order to clear the platform for locating a new, endogenous growth path that will be sustainable; SOE accounting systems leave a lot to be desired when it comes to assessing solvency, and economic agents are not quite familiar with how best to evaluate assets since most financial and real assets were simply the state's prerogative under communism; and (5) in the end, the true worth of assets and liabilities is a function of how quickly a new growth path can be identified and accessed, hence of the transfor mation process itself. No decision maker will find it easy to sort out these various forces and hence to clean up what must be corrected, for any decision is bound to affect the prospective behavior of agents, including the quality of the debt portfolio. Path dependency and hysteresis effects are bound to pervade the transition regardless of the chosen policy menu or the care with which a professionally responsible and sociopolitically dispassionate choice can be hammered out. On the eve of the transition, the planned economy consisted essentially of the "state sector" and households. The state "possessed" a wealth (W) structure that consisted of various assets (A) in part offset against present as well as future liabilities (L), including toward households. When reduced to the common denomi nator of present value at time tt this wealth can be written Wt = (At - Lt). (1) Liabilities can take on various forms. On balance, Lt consists of obligations of the state sector to households, such as promises for pensions, social-welfare support, sickness insurance, and education. Likewise, At consists of the sum of discounted revenues that the state can hope to obtain over time to discharge its obligations. Note that it is not necessarily government as such that incurred those obligations. Likewise, the new government may find it rather difficult to assert control over all assets that legally should be within its competence. Indeed, under communist rule many of the state's assets were entrusted to agents who are now staking out property claims that, once resolved, will make the state (but not necessarily the polity) worse off, if only because many of those claims cannot simply be ignored or confiscated. This holds certainly for property claims to earlier-confiscated assets. It also applies to implicit claims devolving from the fact that the state entrusted ownership functions to management or enterprise, workers, or self-management councils. Another set of claims arises because the communist state badly monitored the use of "its" assets, leaving management and/or the nomenklatura free to seize them for their own enrich ment. There may also be implicit claims because managers and workers feel they were not properly compensated under communist rule for their net contribution to enterprise performance. Likewise, many of the obligations incumbent on the state under communist</page><page sequence="13">MARCH-APRIL 1994 17 rule and administrative planning were, in fact, slated to be discharged by SOEs. Removal of noneconomic tasks from the enterprise agenda will not, of course, free the new state from these obligations as such. Expectations of economic agents are bound to change as the transition proceeds. This is likely to become particularly acute when agents recognize clearly that the new state cannot afford to adhere to the promises made by its predecessor regime and that, in any case, some of these activities in a market environment will be better taken care of through private choice and funding. But I shall ignore that refinement for now, beyond noting that at some point k into the transition, prior to restructuring the state's portfolio as a result of privatization, a change in Wt occurs: Et+k (Wt) = E?k (At) - Et+k (Lt) * Wt, (2) where the actual assets underlying At and liabilities underlying Lu at least as recorded by the accountants, have not changed, but the perception of their "worth" has, given expectations at t+Jc concerning the profits that assets will generate over their lifetime and the liabilities that economic agents still expect the state to discharge in one form or another. This may occur for a variety of reasons, some of which were earlier cited. The net result, however, is that at t+k the evaluation of assets and liabilities becomes better attuned to the new socio economic and political ambitions. This outcome will be affected by changing agents, by the economic downturn induced by the transition policies, by the pervasive uncertainty, by the marked change in relative prices, and by mutating perceptions of what the state can and must prospectively deliver. It is in the nature of the volatility of expectations that: Et+i (Wt) * Et+k W),for 1 &gt; Jfc, (3) with the unequal sign signaling either improved expectations, because the trans formation is proceeding smoothly and economic agents feel more confident about their future at r+1 than at t+k, or worsening expectations when transition policies are not progressing smoothly. In building up the above relationships, it is important to recall that both the state's assets and its liabilities were functionally distributed among various economic agents that nominally all reported to the state. They did so, at least formally, in that they were entrusted with society's assets with a view to maxi mizing welfare as per the precepts of communist-style administrative planning. This process was measurably accelerated when it was formally decided, begin ning with the 1960s, to pursue administrative, and in some cases elements of genuine economic, decentralization. Admittedly, none ever worked out to full satisfaction. Nonetheless, (nominally) autonomous agents as a result gained on balance broader latitude in contracting obligations against the state's assets, thus in fact ultimately augmenting the state's liabilities, and indeed staking out their</page><page sequence="14">18 RUSSIAN AND EAST EUROPEAN FINANCE AND TRADE own claims on these assets. The subscript k in equations (2) and (3) can be interpreted as referring to new owners, whether legally recognized or not. To see this more clearly and more generally, it may be useful to distribute the state sector into three layers: the state (S) narrowly defined, the many SOEs (?), and the few banks (B). Each had a structure of net wealth of the form illustrated in equation (1) but limited to its own ambit. Furthermore, some of the assets of one sector were another's liability, the net value being counterbalanced by the state sector's net asset value over and above liabilities with respect to society as a whole. The state sector's net wealth consisted of the present value of assets held by the state, the SOEs, and the banks minus the present value of liabilities of these three entities: Wt = (Ats + Ate + Atb - U - Lte - Ltb). (4) Thus, if an SOE took out a loan from a bank, the rise in the latter's assets (Atb) offset the rise in the former's liability (Lte), leaving the net wealth of the state sector unaffected; note that an SOE lending to another SOE would leave both Ate and Lte unaffected. It may have led to several subsidiary entries on the state sector's balance sheets. On the whole, however, neither the overall assets nor the overall liabilities, hence the net situation as depicted in equation (1) (but not necessarily as in equation [2]), was affected. By suitably rearranging equation (4): Wt = ? (Atd - ? (Ltd, where / = s,e.b. (5) These are evidently simple manipulations well known to accountants conversant with double-entry bookkeeping. Perhaps less self-evident is that when the circuit linking the state with SOEs and banks becomes stretched wider and wider, many "accountants" will draw up the various elements of Wti rendering balance sheets of the type depicted by an amalgam of apples and bananas, unless there is agree ment on how to value assets and liabilities, preferably in a truly economic rather than a legal or accounting sense, among the various accountants. In other words, with economic decentralization the true Wt depends on the ultimate arbiter in evaluating assets and liabilities of all entities that in some sense are at least nominally state owned; the previous observation that interenterprise debt would leave Ate and Lte intact no longer applies. Of course, the bank's asset should be valued in the same way as the SOE's liability. If the SOE is unlikely to pay off its debt because the loan was squandered, the bank's asset should be marked down, signaling a net decline in the state's net wealth. To return to a unified portfolio evaluation at t or beyond that would simply wash out bad assets and liabilities requires a thorough and nearly complete ^nationalization of all assets in PETs! The leadership was unable or unwilling to</page><page sequence="15">MARCH-APRIL 1994 19 do so on the eve of the privatization campaign, soon after the political revolution (Brabant 1992). Matters become even more entangled when the cleanup effort cannot start at the transition's inception t but only at t+k and it will take some time (say, m - k) to be completed. Under those circumstances, equation (2) now specified for the three classes of agents (or perhaps even more if economic decentralization was not handled uniformly across all sectors) becomes even less meaningful than equation (4). The state is even less likely to be able to nationalize assets and liabilities at time t+k or t+m than at t. So that solution, while technically desirable, provides at best a nonstarter (see section 6). It also deserves that qualifier because it would not solve the problem that is at the core of the trans formation agenda. As L. Brainard (1991, p. 103) observes: "Restructuring of enterprises and banks should . . . proceed together. But the losses in the banks' loan portfolios raise a somewhat different set of problems. There is little social value in pushing any of the state-owned banks into bankruptcy, given their pivotal role in the financial system. The only viable option is to restructure the banks." This can be done only by infusing new capital into existing banks, something that is urgently required if banks are to perform their "proper" role in a market environment once its elementary vestiges will have been put in place. Note that the reason cited for restructuring the banks may also apply to selected SOEs of "national" importance as evaluated with reference to the sociopolitical limits to the burden of transition policies. It may also stem from the need to provide?not necessarily produce?public and semipublic goods. Section 5: Debts and the Transition There seems to be wide agreement about the desirability of cleaning up the balance sheets of existing state-owned institutions. Yet little has been done in the interim. An explanation for this contrast is by no means straightforward. It can best be reached after looking at the situation on the eve of the transition and the nature of the bad debt of SOEs, the mission of the financial sector in the transfor mation process and beyond, and what banks are doing and, in fact, can do during the transformation. It is crucial to bear in mind the weakness of the banks' portfolio relative to bank capitalization. Many state-owned banks are technically insolvent, meaning that if their assets were realistically evaluated (on which more below), they would have a negative net worth, liabilities to depositors and lenders exceeding realistically recoverable claims. This is partly a legacy of administrative planning. It would plainly be wrong to attribute it only to irrational enterprise behavior, SOEs now being willing, on balance, to lose part of the real value of their bank deposits. But their situation has also been affected by circumstances beyond their control. External and internal shocks of transition policies as well as those fortuitously complicating this agenda (such as the Middle East conflict since 1990) have impinged upon the fortunes of economic agents. To the extent that</page><page sequence="16">20 RUSSIAN AND EAST EUROPEAN FINANCE AND TRADE these shocks can be expected to be reversed or their effects mitigated through effective restructuring, it may make sense to accommodate even technically bankrupt firms in the interim. It should be recalled in particular that the burgeoning debt has occurred at a time of incipient changes in economic structures and institutions (Ickes and Ryterman 1992), in addition to the cited external shocks. These may be categorized into five groups (Boissieu, Cohen, and Pontbriand 1993, pp. 108-11): (1) the price impact of "shock therapy"; (2) the crisis of the payment system with former partners set?ed in inconvertible currency (either the transferable ruble or the former "union" currency now no longer accepted); (3) monetary policy; (4) features of the payment and settlement system, including institutional changes in the type of payment behavior ushered into the PETs with the economic transi tion; and (5) the specific nature of the payment problems of firms whose demand has been enormously eroded and cannot be recaptured yet that will not or cannot be closed down quickly for sociopolitical reasons. Even so, during and after the transition the financial sector should play a special role. As discussed in Section 3, a market economy inextricably involves the exchange of some or all property rights embodied in some product for money or against the right(s) to another product. As monetized transactions become more complex with modernization, effective intermediation among economic agents contemporaneously and across time plays a critical role in driving the development process. This is particularly so in economies, such as the PETs, where regaining a positive growth path that is sustainable at an adequate pace for a protracted period of time is a sine qua non for securing sociopolitical support for the transition agenda and for blotting up its unavoidable burdens in an orderly manner. Intermediation over time is a paramount task of the capital market. Once a modicum of stability is restored, markets in goods and services can be expected to wax relatively quickly with liberalization and gradual divestment. But their diffusion throughout society, particularly in large countries with a poor infra structure, such as Russia, may take time and indeed cause temporary setbacks that policy intervention will have to counter (Sapir 1993). Integrating flexible markets is unlikely to progress as smoothly for labor markets. Stimulating capital markets is a different matter altogether, if only because the administratively planned economy forcibly withheld a whole range of assets from voluntarily constituted wealth portfolios. As a result, the existing capital market in general and credit markets in particular lack depth and breadth (Calvo and Frenkel 1991; Long and Sagari 1991). Nurturing along the key components of a capital market (such as merchant and investment banking, real estate, stock exchanges, and insurance companies for all kinds of risk) is better not viewed in a deus ex machina fashion. Indeed, these and related features of a market economy will emerge gradually in conjunction with putting in place the proper "market institu tions" and incentives that warrant their establishment.</page><page sequence="17">MARCH-APRIL 1994 21 The banking sector, as one element of the capital market, or at least its most elementary component, deserves assiduous support so that it can discharge its quintessential market functions as quickly and efficiently as possible. I see three elementary tasks of the banking sector that need to be taken care of expeditiously: (1) reliable and prompt clearing of reciprocal claims; (2) effective intermediation between (short-term) savers and (long-term) investors (Hardy and Lahiri 1992, p. 781); and (3) marketing new financial assets for individual and corporate wealth portfolios, including government instruments to finance any deficit and, indeed, to mobilize savings for development purposes. With a view to encouraging the restructuring of economic activity, the key role of the banking sector is effective intermediation between savers and investors. In the early stages of transformation, this will chiefly call for collecting fairly short-term deposits and lending them for longer-term productive investments with a reasonable intrinsic risk. Whereas risk by definition will make some bank loans uncollectable, the banking sector should be able to work off such ex post losses through its statutory capital, retained earnings, and current profits accruing from its other loans made on the basis of the bank's own liabilities (deposits, borrowed money, capital, and retained earnings). With a narrow base of own resources plus borrowed funds and deposits, banks cannot afford to engage in any but the most secure projects, of which there are likely to be few during the most volatile phase of transformation policies. This puts a damper on private sector entry, slows down the divestment of state-owned assets (including the banks themselves), inhibits the effective adoption of sensible regulatory policies and bank supervision (EBRD 1993), encumbers the development of a sound financial infrastructure for modernization, and complicates the restructuring of SOEs (including the banks themselves). Furthermore, because existing assets are of poor quality, with borrowers wantonly disregarding their debt obligations, the normal process of exit is being impeded. This cannot but inhibit the restructuring efforts required to regain a new growth path. As noted, balance sheets of state firms have not yet been cleaned up, banks have not taken a very active stance in restructuring SOEs or placing them into bankruptcy, and the financial sector has not plunged with gusto into financing the private sector. The reason why banks are not enforcing contractual obligations with their long-standing customers, including those inherited from the monobank, cannot be confined to the argument that they are simply perpetuating the passive adjustment of finance to planned real targets, as typical under admin istrative planning. Nor can they simply be held culpable of conniving with SOEs to force the government's hand as some contend (Phelps et al. 1993, pp. 27ff). In any case, governments should explici?y finance loss-making SOEs that are chosen to be kept afloat through ex ante, precommitted subsidies (Sah and Weitzman 1991) and not by forcing banks or other SOEs to finance the losses (Caprio and Levine 1992, p. 7). Nor would it be correct to say that the problem arises simply for lack of political will or of managerial expertise. Asserting that bad loans</page><page sequence="18">22 RUSSIAN AND EAST EUROPEAN FINANCE AND TRADE contracted by the banks prior to the political revolutions are a consequence of poor judgment on the part of (at least nominally independent) bank management (Marrese 1992, p. 5) is putting this grave transition matter much too simply. Banks cannot afford to enforce bankruptcy proceedings against their clients in technical default, even once the legal infrastructure for exit is firmly in place. Furthermore, under prevailing circumstances, there may indeed be persuasive arguments for banks not to enforce loan obligations. First, the expected value of the assets that can be collected may be less than the cost of enforcing the contract through cumbersome bankruptcy proceedings. Second, there may be an option value in waiting, particularly during a severe downturn that the government will fairly soon have to help reverse, in which case new lending to "bad debtors" may be undertaken. Third, taking action against bad debtors may so weaken the structure of the banks that enforcement will be postponed. Fourth, any such action may alarm policy makers and regulators sufficiently to do something about the "signaled" problem for the sector as a whole. Finally, banks may simply anticipate that there will be a bail-out by the government, in which case the incentive to proceed is very small. Indeed, by making it more cumbersome to come to grips with the collective problem, at least from a sociopolitical perspec tive, and perhaps by destabilizing the already fragile financial infrastructure, waiting with enforcement of discipline may compel the government to bail out the banking sector (Brainard 1991, pp. 102-3). In other words, "policies to deal with banks' balance sheets cannot be pursued in isolation from policies dealing with enterprises' financial situation" (Calvo and Kumar 1993, p. 14), and, I would add, indeed from other transformation policies affecting the economic buoyancy and the sociopolitical stability of the PET. The explosion of interenterprise debt has led to several conflicting views. Macroeconomists favoring shock therapy, however inappropriate this designa tion may be (Brabant 1993c), argue that it has been one of the major contributors to money creation, thus exacerbating inflation, such as in Russia since 1992 (Sachs 1993). Others claim that only banks can create money (Begg and Portes 1992, p. 12), which is true in the strict sense but not quite in the way in which PETs operate. For example, firms that do not service their debt to banks or to other firms produce arrears that lead to an accumulation of unpaid interest on bank loans. This should be added to the size of the loans, thus ending up in involuntary money creation. The fact that SOEs keep on balance larger deposits than their debt in banks has been an oddity, since this suggests that SOEs acquiesce in the inflation tax thus imposed over and above the advantage of being able to borrow below real positive market rates (Sachs 1993, p. 14). I suspect, though, that two other explanations may be more powerful, in addition to sheer inertia, bounded rationality, and other limits on maximizing behavior. One is the "old-boys" network. Keeping deposits in order to enhance one's chances of getting a loan is not unknown in a market economy either! Furthermore, one should look at the distribution of debts and deposits through the various levels of production and</page><page sequence="19">MARCH-APRIL 1994 23 distribution. Also, the reasons for the nonpayment of enterprise debts and fiscal obligations (Ickes and Ryterman 1992, Mates 1992) should be examined. Banks have not been playing their proper intermediating role because they cannot mobilize short-term savings and ensure their allocation to long-term investment in profitable ventures, including notably for new private firms, which will be the real carriers of change toward a new, sustainable endogenous growth path for PETs. Most so-called commercial banks are in any case not involved in retail financial services, and most households for now prefer to keep their savings either "under the mattress" or at institutions?the savings banks in some form11?that are expected to provide near-ironclad deposit insurance, or to invest in government financial instruments that carry a high return with little risk. This means either that banks have to attract placements at institutions that collect savings or that they have to confine their lending to the prudently loanable against their own resources. Since these are very low because all banks are undercapitalized, efficiency considerations have played at best a marginal role in bank lending to date. This is particularly inhibiting the emergence and restructuring of the private sector, which for its financing depends for now largely on "family" assets. If it were true that the state's net wealth would not be affected by having banks allocate credit to SOEs provided they were to do so on the same terms as the state itself, possibly by equally squandering society's wealth, why is there such an outcry against the debt situation? Let me first look at the stock of debt, because its nature has been irrevocably changed by two circumstances. One is that, with the transition, the state sector is scheduled to be formally broken up, at least by taking the former state actors out of decision making about the allocation of most resources. The other is that the nature of the transition has been affecting the net worth of SOEs (hence the degree to which the debt can be repaid) and therefore the net worth of banks. The new interenterprise debt, or bank debt based on questionable credit-granting criteria, really falls into the latter category: assets are carried on the books that are worth much less than their face value. This will be recognized only with effective bankruptcy proceedings, enabling banks or SOEs to enforce their claims and, failing payment, seeking to recoup as much as possible from liquidation of the debtors. Just as the central bank should not act as the government's treasurer, commercial banks should finance endeavors at their own risk. For that constraint to bite with the establishment of independent commercial banks, it is necessary to clean out the loan portfolio of the monobank, capitalize new banks, and recapitalize existing commercial banks in a way that will not inhibit these institu tions from performing their intermediating functions on a strictly commercial basis (Brainard 1991; Carlin and Mayer 1992; Corbett and Mayer 1991; Rybczynski 1991a, 1991b; Slay 1993). The counterpart of the questionable bank debt is the questionable debt of SOEs, at least that part on balance not carried by other SOEs or the state treasury. What is collectible depends on the eventual</page><page sequence="20">24 RUSSIAN AND EAST EUROPEAN FINANCE AND TRADE quality of the loan portfolio. This is inextricably a function of how SOEs are restructured. Only once this is taken care of, preferably through a well thought-out industrial policy (Brabant 1993a; Krawczyk and Lopez-Lopez 1993), can an informed assessment of potentially performing assets be under taken. But it might be useful to entrust prima facie problem loans to some debt-resolution agency. Section 6: Valuing the Debt, Transformation Paths, and Debt Solutions Observers frequently assert that virtually all "old debts," loosely understood to encompass all debts prior to a decision to come to grips with them, are bad. This is most certainly wrong. Whereas it is difficult to estimate the size of problem debts, sheer logic suggests that it depends on the course of the transformation, including any attempt to resolve the perceived debt problem. Furthermore, the banking sector in the PETs does not claim that all are problem debts. Nonperforming assets are defined variously. In Hungary, for example, it means that borrowers have failed to service the debt for at least one year or are in liquidation or bankruptcy proceedings (World Bank 1993, p. 6). Bad loans in Hungary in late 1992 were estimated to amount to 17 percent of total loans (ibid.). In Poland in late 1991, banks estimated the share of substandard loans at some 16 percent of loans to nongovernment. Others placed it higher, about 20-30 percent of the portfolio, but independent audits of the banks put it still higher, between 25 and 60 percent (Calvo and Kumar 1993, p. 13). In Bulgaria, an estimate for late 1992 placed the figure at about 40 percent In Czechoslovakia, the unserviceable loans may amount to some 20 percent. Some extreme views put the good debts at no more than 20-25 percent of the total portfolio (Caprio and Levine 1992, p. 18). But that seems hardly likely, particularly if one believes that economic recovery "is around the corner." Nonetheless, I hasten to add that the size of doubtful debt is considerable and deserves to be tackled soonest, but in a holistic fashion tailored to the transforming PET, if banks are to play their role in economy-wide restructuring. In claiming that a proper cleaning up of the balance sheets of banks and SOEs involves "marking to market" the state's net wealth position, observers tacitly assume either an anthropomorphic state or that unambiguous market valuations can be constructed. This is hardly likely to be the case. Let us start with the anthropomorphic state. True, as in the heyday of strict central planning, when the state's budget included all revenue and expenditures of all SOEs (managed in accounts kept at the central bank), the distinction between fiscal and credit financing of SOEs is hard to draw (Hardy and Lahiri 1992, p. 780). To an omniscient planner or a sole Western evaluator, the washout solution would therefore seem self-evident based on an assessment of the state's net worth. This can be attained only when one omniscient planner or his successor rules over the</page><page sequence="21">MARCH-APRIL 1994 25 entire accounting system, as per the nationalization proposition invoked earlier. The same applies to attempts to net out interenterprise debts over and beyond what can be accomplished voluntarily in a bilateral fashion. But in that case one is not really addressing the debt problem! Even if the nationalization option had been realistic during the first years of strict central planning, the structure of past lending and borrowing on the eve of the political revolutions was the outcome of a drawn-out process of decentraliza tion. There is little reason to presume a priori that the legacies of chronic principal agent problems typical of degenerative administrative planning will now completely vanish. Can one really expect the "new state" to decide abruptly that all wrongs and rights of the past are suddenly null and void, thus enabling economic agents, which are still overwhelmingly (at least as per output perfor mance) concentrated in SOEs, to start with a clean slate? Given these realities, agents entrusted with SOEs during the transition are unlikely to be monitored much better than under administrative planning, unless new measures of governing the public sector are put in place quickly (Brabant 1993a, 1993b, 1993c). In some cases, divestment will ensure such better use of resources. But since this process cannot be completed quickly for a host of legitimate reasons (Brabant 1992), reform of the public sector is a dire necessity that has not so far been adequately explored. Perhaps with this reality as a backdrop, many observers have argued that assets and liabilities should be "marked to market" (Begg and Portes 1992), thus substituting the presumed omniscience of the market for that earlier imputed to the central planner. But I have argued in Section 3 that markets, particularly for capital transactions, function poorly at best Marking down assets to the rather distorted values conveyed in the as yet fragile markets (here captured under E\ as distinct from what economic agents expect the value to be), leaving E'?k (Wt) = k (Wt), where 1 &gt; k &gt; 0 (6) as the platform for embarking on a new growth path, might level the field for a sufficiently clear takeoff, provided other elements were in place. It would, however, be a low level for society as a whole, with more realistic values being captured by those willing and able to hold assets and destroy liabilities. This would be a highly inequitable way of proceeding, given the societal nature of assets and liabilities. It is, of course, a truism that "[rjedefining assets and liabilities so that banks' claims on enterprises are eliminated helps to overcome [many of the cited] obstacles" (Levine and Scott 1993, p. 322). But those advantages should not be considered separately from other elements of the transformation agenda (Mates 1992, p. 396). It would, in any case, not make much sense to redefine all assets and liabilities of banks and SOEs (Bruno 1992). Some observers have argued that the state should quickly come to grips with bad debts essentially by "taking</page><page sequence="22">26 RUSSIAN AND EAST EUROPEAN FINANCE AND TRADE over" the debt in some form, thus allowing both SOEs and banks to function on their own account without being burdened by legacies from the past; a variant involving the takeover of credible deposits and their guarantee by capitalizing new banks with government securities has recently been proposed (Phelps et al. 1993, pp. 27ff). Not only would SOEs that carry no debt and banks that show only performing assets in their balance sheets be able to respond more construc tively to emerging market signals, but they would also be more attractive vehicles once the decision to divest them is taken. Otherwise, it is argued (for example, in Levine and Scott 1993), there will be endless debates on the true value of the debt, hence on the value of SOEs to be divested or reconstructed. Likewise, piecemeal debt resolution would not credibly eliminate moral hazard. Levine and Scott (1993, p. 319), among others, have actually argued that debt could be transferred to the government without entailing obligations that must eventually be covered from fiscal revenues. This suggests that bank assets could be taken over by the government and enterprise liabilities could be wiped out without having a counterpart cost, in terms of either transfers from the govern ment or a reduction in wealth. To anyone with a double-entry bookkeeping mind, this cannot be true. In fact, as argued, the proposition that "many advantages at little or no cost to the fisc" can be generated is an illusion that fundamentally confounds stocks and flows. It also perceives the debt of an SOE, whether with respect to the bank or to another SOE, as something that will not be serviced. The latter derives from the misconception that questionable debt is readily ascertainable. As argued, it depends in good measure on the progress with transi tion or the speed at which "normal" economic conditions for any firm, old or new, can be regained. Only then will it become self-evident that some assets are truly worthless and hence should be written off. A solution lies at hand: the government may take over the debt, but it would be foolhardy to do so without specifying the rules and regulations, and it would be even more foolhardy to wipe out the debt for all economic agents. It is also wrong to argue that the macroeconomic effects of bad loans were incurred in the past (EBRD 1993, p. 12) inasmuch as the adjustment process under administrative planning was seriously impaired. As noted in Section 1, there are three possible generic approaches for dealing with poor loan portfolios. One is the replacement of nonperforming loans, however identifiable at some stage of the transformation, on banks' books with interest-bearing government debt (such as bonds or treasury paper);12 if this option is chosen, several technical questions of the characteristics of this debt should be addressed (Calvo and Kumar 1993, p. 14), but these need not detain us here. This approach would have the unquestionable merit of restoring the banks' total asset base and making it sounder or of capitalizing new banks that may be free of the legacies of incompetence, institutional inertia, and principal-agent problems invoked by some commentators (Phelps et al. 1993, pp. 23ff).13 It would also clean up the situation for SOEs and thus facilitate restructuring and</page><page sequence="23">MARCH-APRIL 1994 27 divestment. The argument is that banks will now have "better" assets against which they can contract new loans, particularly to new firms. When these loans have to be paid out, banks should be able to do so by mobilizing their liquid resources. When the latter fail, they should utilize the state's debt instruments, just as in the case of turning enterprise debts into negotiable instruments (Aglietta and Moutot 1993, p. 92), in secondary markets. Of course, secondary markets have as yet to emerge. This way of proceeding would undoubtedly be useful if it could be afforded, either by the state's assuming the obligations or by engineering a washout within the state sector. In either case, the state's net worth would remain unaffected if indeed all banks and SOEs were "state owned" (OECD 1992, p. 49). But this is a fallacious way of proceeding as argued: some SOEs are more state owned than others. Furthermore, it would not be a very equitable way of proceeding, certainly not from society's point of view. Although the total recorded level of public debt would increase, there is unlikely to be an infla tionary effect, provided prudent bank lending will henceforth be practiced. However, claims on government resources are already so high (and so are the needs to restore some semblance of economic growth by putting funds into public-sector investment, especially in infrastructure and communications) that this approach may overstretch the capacity of the PET government to generate fiscal revenue. If so, it may in turn adversely affect the credibility of any stabilization program. A second option involves some type of monetary reform whereby the nominal assets and liabilities of banks with respect to SOEs are offset. That is, the assets of the enterprise sector held by banks are wiped out against their bank liabilities. At first sight, since most banks and borrowers are, in fact, state owned, this would represent essentially a transfer within the state sector. In terms of promoting efficient corporate finance, as Caprio and Levine (1992, p. 13) argue, this would increase retained earnings and thereby enhance the resources directly available to firms for investment. This would clearly apply only to successful firms, and it would be meaningful solely if otherwise "market discipline" were to be enforceable. This is hardly likely to be the case for reasons noted in Section 3, including diffuse property rights, bad monitoring, and poorly functioning markets. Note that whereas this approach would have no implications for public-sector debt, it would affect the ability of firms and banks to operate to the extent that net assets of actually or potentially profitable firms and banks are offset against the liabilities of actually or potentially unprofitable firms and banks, thereby hampering the transformation. In any case, wiping out deposits would not only hamstring SOEs in their day-to-day operations; it might also debilitate them so severely that massive and largely premature bankruptcy would, in fact, be engineered in this way. Whether the policy is enacted one or two years down the road in the transformation agenda is immaterial, except that some of the deposits</page><page sequence="24">28 RUSSIAN AND EAST EUROPEAN FINANCE AND TRADE of the earlier "potentially profitable" SOEs would have arisen from actual profits under the admittedly convoluted transitional situations. Given that no PET embraced this purification action upon embarking on the political revolution, this option is now no longer feasible, as argued. If applied it would debilitate the economy by nipping the incipient transformation in the bud. It might have cleared the decks for imposing greater discipline on SOEs and banks at the inception of the transition. Sociopolitical consensus at the time might even have been prepared to accept this calamity, provided it had eased regaining positive growth. I doubt whether such could have been taken for granted, given the nature of these economies and the fact that resolving one issue (such as the old debt) without simultaneously tackling other constraints, some of which may be necessary in order to render debt resolution credible (such as by imposing effective disciplines on SOEs and banks), is unlikely to provide more than a temporary palliative, if that. A final option is to let banks write off their bad assets through the accumula tion of retained profits that in some sense are abnormal because banks are allowed to drive a significant wedge between lending and borrowing rates and to retain most of their nominal profits to ensure against bad loans.14 At the same time, banks would be encouraged to get involved in restructuring their large problem clients either by participating in privatization (such as through cross ownership) or by taking a very active part in liquidation and bankruptcy proceedings. Apart from the fact that it may take a long time to generate sufficient profit to write off the bad loans, if only because this policy itself delays the economic recovery, this option would be particularly harmful to the financing of new firms and the generation of fiscal revenues from banks. By now, virtually all PETs have embraced some variant of the first option? namely, allowing banks to write off part of their bad assets against some form of public-sector financing either out of large budget surpluses that are usual only during the first phase of stabilization policies15 (as in Romania), by entrusting bad loans to a new government agency (as in the former Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, and partially Hungary), or by swapping bad loans for government securities (as in Hungary). None provides a comprehensive solution, however (EBRD 1993, pp. llff). Conclusions Whereas it is widely recognized that the debt situation has been one central factor troubling the atmosphere for the transition, the remedies to rectify the situation proposed to date are by no means self-evident, except in highly simplified frameworks that rely on assumptions with little bearing on the prevailing situation in the PETs. Many take a partial approach, essentially falling into line with other advocates of ensuring that the environment for micro economic decision making be cleansed as quickly and as thoroughly as possible</page><page sequence="25">MARCH-APRIL 1994 29 by hiving off all obligations to the government (see Calvo and Frenkel 1991; Fischer 1991). It is plainly pernicious to assume that the state will assume responsibility for virtually all adverse legacies of communism when at the same time advisers insist upon slimming down government by depriving it of its revenue base (for example, because of a call for low tariffs, for keeping domestic fiscal systems pro-competitive, and for quickly divesting state-owned assets and because the new governments are unable to enact fiscal reforms and collect adequate revenues to finance mandated tasks). It may be an insurmountable task for the government to discharge these liabilities under weak market arrange ments. Whatever social consensus on the state's role may be identified, it will have to be reconciled with adequate financing. Freeing up the private sector to engage in "ostensibly clean" operations unloads onto the state a burden that would all but paralyze it precisely at a time when it must muster all resources to manage the transition. This option is neither feasible nor desirable. It would, therefore, seem that the preferable option is to muddle through in a gradual but purposeful way in whatever format available governance capacities allow. A suitable industrial policy targeted not only at divestment but also at restructuring SOEs and banks could play a critical role here (Brabant 1993a, 1993b). Notes 1. Comprising the former European planned economies, including Yugoslavia and its, as well as Czechoslovakia's and the former USSR's, successor states. This area is here also denoted as East with a capital E. 2. Inasmuch as "transformation policies" suggests incisiveness of action over a fairly protracted period of time, I much prefer this to "transition policies," which intimates temporizing and a short-term horizon. In what follows, I use the latter notion for the events in the eastern part of Europe since 1989 and the former to designate policies in selected countries directed at steering toward market-based decision making in a pluralistic political setting with some determination, although not necessarily at great speed (see Brabant 1993c, 1994). 3. I have sketched the broader framework of bad bank and interenterprise debts in Brabant 1994. 4. In what follows, I use the notion SOEs as a shorthand interchangeably to denote the larger firms that cannot be privatized quickly or all assets over whose use the state may traditionally have exerted a determining influence, including as formal owner. This includes the cooperatives as well as private property over which property rights were fuzzy (such as rural and urban real estate in many Eastern countries). But I keep state-owned banks separate for reasons that will become clear as I proceed. 5. Note that in several PETs the acuity (but not, of course, the absolute size) of bad debts experienced since the political mutations has in good part been stronger in private sector activities than in the civilian state sector. 6. I am placing this in quotation marks because all too many observers assume that bankers in PETs will be able to restructure SOEs if urged to do so. This simply glosses over the reality that bankers in most (but not all) PETs are being trained in market-based decisions virtually from point zero. 7. Because divestment of most SOEs that matter cannot be undertaken quickly and it</page><page sequence="26">30 RUSSIAN AND EAST EUROPEAN FINANCE AND TRADE is paramount to remove control over assets from the state and its various interlocking interest groups, commercialization and corporatization, and possibly restructuring, of these assets must be considered as interim ways toward improving resource allocation and factor productivity. 8. I am arguing here more from the point of view of the role that an economic adviser can play in shaping some elements of the policy process that are "tangible" for measures that will actually be taken. For a useful discourse on what an economist can and cannot hope to engineer in this way, see Nelson 1987. 9. The resilience to adjustment shocks and willingness to bear hardships on the part of the population at large thus far exceeded what most observers anticipated when the political events first shook the world. Moreover, the pressure at which the consensus web might fracture has itself repeatedly been raised as the true dimensions of the transition have become more apparent. But it would be foolhardy to assume that the tolerable floor is a tabula rasa. There are limits to how much of a burden can be imposed upon the electorate at large. 10. Given the legacies of communism and the East's historic achievements, issues of distributional equity simply cannot be ignored by those involved in managing the transi tions, even though this precept itself has been changing rapidly and incisively under the impact of the transition. 11. For Hungary, see "Hungary" 1993, and for Poland, Slay 1993. It is, however, fundamentally wrong to conjecture that "[d]ebt-for-equity swaps would also create another mechanism for privatizing state firms" (Slay 1993, p. 26), as the Hungarian example has amply demonstrated. That is not, however, to say that debt-for-equity swaps would not be a useful way to bolster monitoring of SOEs, particularly in getting still nominally state-owned banks involved in enterprise restructuring. And that, rather than ownership per se, in my view, is indeed the key to improving incentives for enterprise management (Brabant 1992). 12. Alternatively, government could infuse more liquid capital into the banks, but that might put too much pressure on already highly fragile budgets. 13. Note that this presumes that there is a layer of competent bankers available who for some reason are presently unable to take over existing banks or to found their own. Furthermore, it is assumed that such new banks would be able to function properly even though the new institutions would be state owned, at least initially. These far-fetched assumptions remind me of the exceedingly naive claims made at the inception of privatization (see Brabant 1992). 14. Whether this is allowed in the form of profits or because banks will be required to pay deposit insurance that in turn will be used to offset bad loans is almost immaterial for the purposes at hand. In any case, deposit insurance would seem to be more useful as a device to improve confidence in the financial system than as a means to take care of bad loans. 15. It would be foolhardy, however, to continue counting on them as a vehicle to recapitalize banks (as in OECD 1992, p. 49), for the rapidly worsening situation of SOEs as the transition proceeds cannot but leave banks in a worsening state, too. Moreover, bank profits are likely to be skimmed off for financing central budget deficits. Bibliography Aglietta, Michel, and Moutot, Philippe. 1993. "Redeployer les reformes."
