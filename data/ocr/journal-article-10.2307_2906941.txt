DONATO 3 For MICHEL SERRES In the Affendimmerung, or twilight of the apes what is more fitting than that man shouldfor reas- surance turn to japes? Ogden Nash The universe (which others call the Library) .. Borges Je creverai entre deux periodes. Flaubert Hegel's Phenomenology of the Mind and Encyclopedia of Philosophical Sciences, Novalis' Encyclopedia, Mallarme's Book, and Borges' Library of Babel name the different moments under barely differing metaphors of the cer- titude, nostalgia or nightmare of the same con- cept of a unified, self-generated, total discourse joining in a circular movement the absolute Origin and End of a linear order. The concept of a Unified global knowledge not simply as an indiscriminate accumulation, no matter how total in scope, such as for example in Diderot's Encyclopedie, but as a Total order which accounts for all past, present, future, artistic, philosophic, religious endeavours, belongs to Hegel. Hegel's Phenomenology was to mark the advent of the Totalizing End of History, the revelation to itself in Absolute Knowledge of Geist, the true author- ial Voice of the Encyclopedia. Such a History is of course above all rational: "The only idea that</page><page sequence="2">886 M L N De Rabelais d Joyce par Leib- niz et toute une chaine, proje- ter, appliquerpartie d'une bib- liotheque possible sur un livre.

Borges Fort embarrasses [Bouvard et Pecuchet] parfois de savoir si tel livre 'tait vraiment un livre de bibliotheque'. Flaubert Philosophy brings is the simple idea of Reason, that Reason governs the world and therefore universal History is rational." Novalis also entertained the dream of a self- generated Encyclopedia. Novalis' project runs parallel to Hegel's but is exemplary in as much as it remains incomplete and fragmentary for in- trinsic and not accidental reasons. For Novalis: "Everything must be encyclopedied . . ." "It must be possible to put into tables any possible history of literature, of art and of the world. " "My book must become a scientific bible - a model real and ideal - and the seed for all books." "All sciences constitute a single book." "Properly speaking, the description of the bible is my enterprise - or, to state it even better, the theory of the bible - art and theory of the bible. (Manner of elevating a book to the level of the bible.) Fully complete, the bible is a perfect library - well-ordered. The schema of the bible is at the same time the schema of the library - the authentic schema - indicating at the same time its own genesis - its own use, etc."'1 Novalis' project not only shows the theological nature of the enterprise but connects it directly with the Bible on the one hand and the idea of an ideal Library on the other. Such an ideal Li- brary, the concretisation of the Ideal Ency- clopedia, would not simply be the random de- pository of as many books as possible, but would display them in such a way that their spacing would manifest a totally rational order. As such the library is an institution that attempts to gen- erate a lay equivalent of the divine Book. In the 19th century the 'Encyclopedia-Libraries' came to be conceived as the primary conceptual tool by means of which men were to decipher the world, yet the decipherment itself has a pre- ordained place in the library. The 'Book-</page><page sequence="3">M L N 887 Une preface ... .noncerait aufutur ("vous allez lire ceci") le sens ou le contenu concep- tuels ... de ce qui aurait deja eM &amp;crit. Derrida Le temps est le temps de la pre- face, respace - dont le temps aura 6te la veritW - est lespace de la preface. Celleci occuperait donc en totalitW le lieu et la duree du livre. Derrida Encyclopedia-Library' then becomes what Borges was to describe ironically, in another context, as "the inconceivable museum of platonic archetypes, intelligible essences and universals." Yet, as Derrida has shown in his analysis of Novalis' Encyclopedia, the latter is inscribed in a system of representation which it does not mas- ter and hence Novalis' project of totalization is doomed to remain a project.2 For our purposes let us take the fragmentary nature of the Encyclopedia as emblematic of a cleft in the plenitude of Hegel. Mallarm6's Book in many respects echoes Hegel's Encyclopedia: "The Book where the spirit lives satisfied, unpersonified, the volume, inas- much as one separates oneself from it as author, does not require any approach by the reader. As such, among human accessories, it exists by it- self: made yet already there (il a lieu tout seul: fait 6tant). The buried meaning moves of its own accord, disposing the pages in chorus."3 Yet, like Novalis' Encyclopedia, Mallarmes Book remains in fragments.4 His often quoted ". . . everything in the world exists to end in a book"5 marks perhaps the reason for the necessary failure of both enterprises within the text as representa- tion. The 'world' as 'thing', 'meaning' or 'sig- nified' logically and temporally pre-dates its metaphoric transcription in the Book, and the Book as totalization is always on the horizon as a never present future. The temporal inscription of a text never speaks of presence but always of an unrecoverable loss or an impossible future. As Derrida has so convincingly argued, the time of the text is the time of a continuous preface which is always written after that which the text represents in a book yet to come. The temporal- ity that Derrida ascribes to the text, in this re- spect, is similar to that which for Kermode characterizes fiction. In Kermode's words: "Men, like poets, rush 'into the middest', in media res, where they also die in medlis rebus" and of course since "men die because they cannot join</page><page sequence="4">888 M L N Le livre ne commence ni ne finit, tout au plus ii en fait semblant. Mallarm6 Commencer et finir sont des actes d'cisifs et deisoires. Barthes Avant-hier, dans la fore&amp;t de Touques, un charmant endroit the beginning and the end" they invent fictions: "to make sense of their span they need fiction concords with origins and ends such as giving meaning to lives and to poems."6 Fiction then as Kermode would have it is no- thing but the imposing of artificial absolute origins and ends on that which is by definition without beginning and end. Hegel then believed in a supreme and absolute fiction whereas Mal- larme at the opposite extreme did not think any such absolute fiction possible. Between these two extremes fictions remain the representations of texts which never quite coincide with them. Some fictions, of course, with the summoning of a monstrous imagination, will attempt to join opposites, to juxtapose fiction with the impossi- bility of fiction. Take, for example, Borges' Library of Babel. Its halls, which contain: ". everything: the minutely detailed history of the future, the archangels' autobiographies, the faithful catalogue of the Library, thousands of false catalogues, the demonstration of the fallacy of those catalogues, the demonstration of the fallacy of the true catalogue, the Gnostic Gospel of Basilides, the commentary on that gospel, the commentary on the commentary on that gospel, the true story of your death, the translation of every book in all languages, the interpolations of every book in all books"7... are nothing but the fictional nightmare of the Hegelian Logos. It is against such a background of absolute or impossible fictions, and of their teratogenic mix- ture that we might best try to understand Flaubert's own fictional enterprise. II Je lis des catalogues de livres que j'annote. Flaubert Je suis un homme-plume. Je sens par elle, a cause d'elle, par rapport d elle et beaucoup plus avec elle.

Ma pauvre Bovary sans doute, souffre et pleure dans vingt villages de France a la fois, a cette heure mime. Flaubert metaphysics, is sustained by an ambivalent rela- tion to the concept of Book, Encyclopedia, and Library. For Kenner, Fluabert "is the great stu- dent of cultural feedback, writing books about what books do to the readers of books" and "Emma Bovary herself would have been impos- sible without books, quantities of books, books of the very sort that Madame Bovary itself approxi- mates ..8 For Foucault The Temptation of St. Anthony is "the book of books: it composes in one 'volume' a series of the elements of language which have been constituted from already written books and which are by their rigorously documented character the repetition of that which has al- ready been said."9 Bouvard and Pecuchet, which for Kenner is emblematic of "the incompetence of fiction itself which is endlessly arranging things," represents for Foucault a case where "the Library is visible, catalogued, named and analyzed.... It possesses its powers by virtue of its very existence - of the proliferation of printed paper ... the Bible has been trans- formed into a bookstore." Flaubert's quest for fiction will thus coincide minimally with a quest for the form of the Book. Its requirement is simple: to find a finite con- densed narrative conforming to its subject mat- ter. Its simple requirements are stated by Bouvard and Pecuchet when they decide to write a historical book: "one can take a subject, exhaust the sources, analyze it well, then con- dense it into a narrative, which would be a sum- mary of facts, reflecting the entire truth."10 Yet such a task quickly turns out to be intrinsically impossible. This impossibility exists on two levels; on the one hand the 'reality' quickly fragments itself into an infinity of disconnected and contradictory events; on the other hand the written representation is incapable of acceding to a completed form. For Flaubert, who described it metaphorically as "a complicated organism"1 (798), a "heavy machine" (342), a Book exists as a privileged</page><page sequence="6">890 M L N form, distinct and independent from any of its possible semantic representations. The first property of form is its unity: "beautiful frag- ments are nothing. Unity, unity, everything is there" (158). A Book then "is a totality where each part concurs in the whole and not an assemblage of sentences which no matter how well made are of value only if individually isolated."12 In a let- ter to Georges Sand Flaubert compares the Book to a wall of the Acropolis: "I ask myself if a book, independently of what it says, cannot produce the same effect. In the precision of its assembly, the rarity of its elements, the gloss of its surface, the harmony of its whole, is there not an intrinsic virtue, a kind of divine force, something eternal like a principle?" (1573). This form or principle is in fact deceivingly simple and is nothing but that of a straight line like a wall: "Prose must stand straight, from beginning to end, like a wall carrying its ornamentation all the way to its foundations, and in its perspective it should form a long, unified line" (405). There is, how- ever, a major difference: whereas the begin- nings and ends of walls are clearly demarcated, the line which constitutes the architectonic of prose and of the Book can never be temporally or spatially terminated: "prose is a dog-gone thing! It is never finished!" (335), "This is what is diabolical about prose, it is never finished" (404). The incompletion is intrinsic: there cannot be any privileged end point. The belief that an au- thor can conclude is a fool's belief: "ineptitude consists in wanting to conclude . . . yes, stupidity consists in wanting to conclude. We are but a thread and we want to know the web." (267) The capacity to reach an end point does not belong to prose or literature. If literature could conclude it would conform to reality and be able to postulate a truth value. It cannot do so, how- ever, hence the contradictory requirement of the novelist who must on the one hand reach for an impossible realism, on the other pursue a futile estheticism - "Art in the last analysis can- not be more serious than a game of skittles" (292</page><page sequence="7">M L N 891 Je ne crois seulement quda l'iternitW d'une chose, c'est a celle de l'illusion, qui est la vraie verzte. Flaubert o no, there is no end; the end is death and madness! Kidd ... balivernes que j'aligne trWs serieusement sur du beau papier blanc Flaubert Le langage en tant queforme est devenu la passion de l'crivain Barthes - which knows by its inevitable cleavage from the reality that it pretends to portray its essential inability to attain to any representational iden- tity: "The first quality and end of art is illusion." (426) God concludes, artists pretend to, while know- ing all along that fictions are fictions precisely because they are unable to conclude: "One al- ways falsifies reality when one wishes to bring it to a conclusion that belongs to God alone. And then, it is with fictions that one can manage to discover truth . . . the frenzy to conclude is one of the most fatal and sterile manias peculiar to humanity." (765) Bouvard and Pecuchet is the emblematic literary landmark of fiction's necessary incapacity to raise the description of reality to intelligibility, to find within representation an order which might somehow adequately correspond to what by con- trast remains a world of human events submit- ted to chance " .. . suppose the flight of the King [King XVI] unhindered, Robespierre es- caping or Bonaparte assassinated - chances which depend on a less scrupulous inkeeper, an open door, a sleeping sentry - and the course of the world was changed" - of dubious genealogies - "they even wished to learn He- brew, which is the mother-language of Celtic, un- less it is derived from it!" - of uncertain logic "what is cause, what is effect" - of the earth's unfathomable depths - "Geology is too restricted! ... As for the rest, and the ocean- beds, we shall always be ignorant." A century later Bouvard and Pecuchet would have no doubt found solace in Borges' discovery of a "Samoyedic Lithuanian dialect of Guarani, with classical Arabian inflections". The failure of prose to reach an end point and the concomitant failure of fiction to accede to a privileged form, is, in one respect, nothing but the consequence of the incapacity of language to sustain a proper representation of the world. This incapacity of language is inscribed in each of its signifying modes.

Browne La "nature" est un produit du NMolithique Pouillon Je soutiens qu'il n'y a qu'un giometre et un sot qui puissent parler sans figures J.-J. Rousseau a stable semiology, a coherent rhetoric, a true philological history or a structured grammar. After their failure at agronomy and arboricul- ture, Bouvard and Pecuchet continue their 'natural' quest following an arbitrary alphabeti- cal sequence and move on to landscape architec- ture. What the two protagonists never realize, never recognize, is that their 'natural' mistakes are above all linguistic mistakes. Bouvard tries to grow 'proper'nominal species of melons and plants. The seeds being planted too close to each other, by metonymic contamination they pro- duce monstrous metaphors: "Actually, as he had grown different species next to one another, the sweet variety got mixed with the bitter, the big Portuguese with the Great Mongolian, and the presence of tomatos completing the anarchy, there resulted abominable hybrids of a pumpkin flavor." 'Proper' names are no more natural than 'proper' species; they are both the result of artificial differentiating grids. The failure of these adventures in arboriculture is in fact due to the failure of taxonomic nomenclature, that is to say, a failure to match correspondingly plants and names: "They looked in their books for plants to buy, and, having chosen names which to them seemed wonderful, they wrote to a market-gardener at Falaise, who eagerly under- took to send them three hundred saplings for which he had no market." Garden architec- ture, in turn, leads them to a rhetorical disaster, for "the author of The Garden Architect divides gardens into an infinity of styles. There is, in the first place, the Melancholy or Romantic, which is distinguished by everlastings, ruins, tombs, and an 'ex-voto to the Virgin, indicating the spot where a cavalier has fallen under an assassin's dagger.' The Terrible is constructed with over- hanging rocks, shattered trees and burnt-out cabins; the Exotic, by planting Peruvian torch- thistles to bring back memories to a settler or traveller.

A mobile army of metaphors, metonymies, anthropomorph- ism; in short a sum of human relations which became poeti- cally and rhetorically inten- sified, metamorphosed, adorned, and after long usage seems to a nation fixed, canonic, and binding; truths are illusions of which one has forgotten that they are illusions, worn-out metaphors which have become powerless to affect the senses; coins which have their obverse effaced, and now are no longer of account as coins, but merely as metal. Nietzsche Let it be as if. Let's make a philosophy of that as if. Sterne artificial distinction of codes they end up pro- ducing a new monstrosity: "In the half-light it was somehow terrible. The rock, like a moun- tain, took up the lawn, the tomb made a cube in the midst of the spinach, the Venetian bridge a circumflex accet over the kidney beans - and the cabin beyond, a great black smudge, for thqy had fired the thatched roof to make it more poetical." The ironic quest of Bouvard and Pecuchet stems for their incapacity to recognize that lan- guage is incapable of grasping the nature of things. After failing in their botanical en- deavour, they pass on to science and then to history, always convinced that the web of lan- guage will be sufficient to help them come to terms with the world. In the same manner that in their gardening they ended up creating metaphoric monsters, their attempts to organize the world of events into a representational order culminate in a metaphoric breakdown of the semiological mechanism of signification; sig- nifiers and signified become indistinguishable and the sign qua sign collapses: ". . . the world became a symbol. They sought, on the walls, a quantity of things that were not there, and ended up by seeing them." And thus they had to reach the conclusion that "syntax is a fantasy and grammar an illusion." III What confusion in greater THEATRES from words of little meaning. Sterne Flaubert's characters are in search of an abso- lute and their quest is mediated by the written word; literature for Emma Bovary, the Bible for Anthony, the Library for Bouvard and Pecuchet. Their ironic mistake is to believe in the absolutes implied by their enterprises. Art, Truth, and Knowledge are only teleological mirages. Take the Bible, Anthony's only and supreme book: it is not certain that it is unique,</page><page sequence="10">894 M L N Words, displaced and muti- lated words, words of others Borges ... if he is a man of the least spirit, he will bare fifty devia- that it does not exist like the treatises of Bouvard and Pecuchet in many a different and contradic- tory version. When Anthony wants to dispel the ghosts of the heretics "they all at once brandish in the air their rolls of papyrus, tablets of wood, scrolls of leather, rolls of woven stuff bearing inscriptions; and elbowing and pushing each other, they all shout to Anthony: THE CERINTHIANS. 'Behold the Gospel of the Hebrews!' THE MARCIONITES. 'Behold the Gospel of the Lord!' THE MARCOSIANS. 'The Gospel of Eve!' THE EUCRATITES. 'The Gospel of Thomas!' THE CAINITES. 'The Gospel of Judas!' BASILIDES. 'The Treatise upon the Destiny of the Soul!' MANES. 'The Prophecy of Barkouf!'" If one took for granted the singularity of the Bible the problem of interpreting it would not be very different from that encountered by Bouvard and Pecuchet when they attempt to interpret History: "ANTHONY. 'It matters little! We must believe the Scriptures.' HILARION. 'Saint Paul, Origen, and many others did not understand the Scriptures in a literal sense: yet if Holy Writ be explained by allegories it becomes the portion of a small numer, and the evidence of the truth disappears. What must we do?'" Emma Bovary, Anthony, Bouvard and Pecuchet are the shadows projected by the virtual end point of theology. If their reality dissolves in the labyrinths of the Library it is because they are the creations of the author's original wandering in it. When Bouvard and Pecuchet decide that History is nothing but a bundle of contradic- tions, what follows belongs to characters and author alike: "What should one conclude? One must undertake an infinite quest, it is frighten- ing, to know the truth one must exhaust all documents - is it possible?" Impossible as it may seem, the task is as inevit- able as it is necessary.

"13 Bouvard and Pecuchet's wandering in the maze of the written word is a mirror image of Flaubert's undertaking, in which, to write Bouvard and Pucuchet - but the same would be true of The Temptation of St. Anthony or Salammb6 - he has to start where his characters end: "I am accumulating note upon note, book upon book" (551), "Do you know the number of volumes that I have had to absorb for my two fellows? More than 1500! My file is eight inches high" (1935), "As for myself, I have an indigestion of books. I belching in-folios." Flaubert is lost in the web of the written word like his to anti-heroes: "when I say soon, it is only by way of speaking, for the subject extends itself considerably, with each new reading a thousand others come forth! I, sir, am in a labyrinth!" (550) . . . "reading is an abyss; one never gets out of it." (397)14 Bouvard and Pucuchet remains an unfinished book which tells of the impossibility of finishing books. One should not think that literature in any way provides an esthetic alternative to the failure of metaphysics. The act of writing fiction is intrinsically isomorphic to totalizing the Encyclopedia or the Library: "To write one would have to know everything.

Flaubert petty scribblers (&amp;rivassiers), we have a mon- strous ignorance.... The books from which en- tire literatures derived, like Homer and Rabelais, are encyclopedias of their times. Those good men knew everything, we know nothing." (466) IV Solvitur ambulando La storia che volevo raccontare dunque e impossible non solo raccontarla ma innanzitutto viverla Calvino Peut-etre qu'il ny a pas de but Flaubert Before trying to answer the question as to why the modern author's failure is inevitable, let us briefly explore his strategy. As we said, to write a successful fiction, that is to say one that rep- resentationally has access to truth, hence 'Beauty', one must be able to conclude; but only God has that privilege, for only God can grasp form in its totality, since he alone perceives abso- lute Origins and Ends and the Order that they sustain. For our purposes Borges' definition is as good as any: "What is a divine mind? . .. There is not a theologian who does not define it. I prefer an example. The steps a man takes from the day of his birth until that of his death trace in time an inconceivable figure. The Divine Mind intui- tively grasps that form immediately." The mod- ern author, on the other hand, condemned to the infinite mediation of fragmentary texts, has to have recourse to a topographical strategy in order to see the form. Since the problem of seeing can be translated into a spatial metaphor of perspective, the act of writing can be de- scribed as a climb and a search for elevation. The task of the author is to climb high enough to see: "Is not the artist's life or rather the work of art to be achieved like a big mountain to be</page><page sequence="13">M L N 897 Il me semble que je vais m'embarquer pour un tres grand voyage, vers des re'gions inconnues, et que je n'en re- viendrai pas. Flaubert Le seul moyen de vivre en paix, c'est de se placer tout d'un bond au-dessus de l'humanite en- tiere et de n'avoir avec elle rien de commun, qu'un rapport d'oeil. Flaubert Depuis le temps ou tj'crivais en demandant a ma bonne les lettres qu'il fallait employer pourfaire les mots des phrases quejinventais, jusqu' ce soir out l'encre sehe sur les ratures de mes pages, j'ai suivi une ligne droite, incessamment prolong&amp;e et tir&amp;e au cordeau a travers tout.J'ai toujours vu le but se reculer devant moi, d'anne's en annees, de progres en progres. Que defoisje suis tombe a plat ventre au moment oft il me semblait le toucher. Flaubert We climb by the most danger- ous paths, our eyes open, im- pervious to risk, on the roof- tops, on the cliffs, on the towers offantasy, without the slightest vertigo, born as we are to climb - we sleepwalkers of the day! We artists! We dissimulators of nature! We lunatics and seekers of God! We travellers in the silence of death, tireless climbed? ... First one glimpses from below a high peak. In the sky it sparkles with purity; its height is frightening yet it beckons you for that very reason. One departs. But with each leveling of the path the summit grows bigger, the horizon recedes, one goes through pre- cipices, vertigo and discouragements ... The earth is lost forever, and the end no doubt will never be reached. . . . One has only an in- domitable wish to climb higher, to finish, to die. Sometimes however a blast of the winds from heaven arrives and unveils to your daz- zled eyes innumerable, infinite and marvel- lous perspectives! One can make out men twenty thousand feet below, an Olympian air fills your giant lungs and one sees oneself as a colossus having the whole world as a pedestal. Then the fog descends again, and one con- tinues, fumblingly, gropingly, tearing one's nails against the rock-face and crying in one's solitude. It matters little! Let us die in the snow, let us perish in the white agony of our desire in the murmur of the torrents of the Spirit (1'Esprit), and our face turned towards the sun!" (426) The space of the act of writing is permeated with fog which blocks sight, hides direction, and changes the journey into endless and aimless wandering. It transforms the altitude of the mountains, which for the nineteenth century were a privileged place of health and perma- nence, into one of bleeding and death which is now coextensive with writing itself; it reduces the Voice of Hegel's Geist to a murmur and hides the Nietzschean sun, preventing it from defin- ing a direction towards the End. Nietzsche later will have his Zarathustra climb to the summit, look into the noon sun and re- turn. Having reached the End, in a movement opposed to that of Flaubert, and after reinscrib- ing 'Truth' into a 'Fable', that is to say into a fiction, Nietzsche will be able to reinstate origins: "Incipit Zarathustra". Flaubert's nihilism is perhaps more radical: the writer is doomed to remain in the fog of undifferentiation, in a mid- dle ground which subverts aim, direction and</page><page sequence="14">898 M L N travellers on heights ...

Serres ultimately life. Not surprisingly then, Flaubert, unable to have access.to a supreme fiction, alone without Origin or End, will write: "literally speaking I don't know where I am." (270) Given the symmetry between Flaubert and his charac- ters it is not surprising to find Anthony perched on an elevation in the middle of the desert, another directionless, boundless, flattened, un- differentiated space. To the metaphor of writ- ing corresponds that of crossing the desert: "I have undertaken an insane book. . . . I expect nothing more out of life than a string of papers to daub in black. It seems to me that I am cross- ing a solitude without end, to go I do not know where. And it is I who am, all at once, the desert, the traveller and the camel." (1530) Incapable of having access to the plenitude that only eschatology can provide, the writer can only play at generating pseudo-fictions which pretend to describe events from a divinely ele- vated standpoint when in fact he has no eleva- tion. His question "When will facts be written about from the point of view of a superior blague, that is to say, the way the good Lord sees them - from above?" has to remain a rhetorical one. Yet phrasing the problem in this way, one begs the real question, which is: why is modern writ- ten prose denied a privileged position to which others had access in the past? For Flaubert, liter- ature seems to be something of the past, perhaps of the future, but not available to his present. The answer resides perhaps in the fact that for Flaubert, as later for Nietzsche, God - God as Origin, Order and End, God as Reason, in a word God as Grammar - is dead. For Nietzsche this does not mean that God is not, but that he once was and now is no more. Pseudo-fictions now tell about the time of an ambiguous crepuscular agony of a Gbtterddmmerung, in between the by-gone time of literature and the future science to come.</page><page sequence="15">M L N 899 L'Art, comme leDieu desJuifs, se repait d'holocaustes.

Flaubert The Temptation of St. Anthony with its three ver- sions which span Flaubert's entire literary career occupies a privileged position in the Flaubertian canon. The author himself more than once un- derscored the significance of the work: "St. An- thony is my lifetime's work" (1304) - and iden- tified with its character: "I am in the place of St. Anthony ... the Temptation has been for myself and not for the reader." In a letter to George Sand, Flaubert himself underscored the impor- tance of the episode of the death of the Gods, he wrote: "I am having the Gods speak in their death-throes; the sub-title of my book could be: The Height of insanity." (1204) When Pecuchet, during his geological quest for origins, is threatened by an avalanche of pebbles after a conversation with Bouvard about volcanic catastrophies, he shouts in a gesture of stupid optimism: "'Stop, stop! The period hasn't run its course yet'. . he made enormous bounds with his alpenstock, bellowing, 'The period hasn't run its course yet!'" But for Flaubert's nihilistic (the word is his) pessimism the period is in fact achieved: "The great period is achieved! Men, animals, the gods, the bam- boos, the oceans, the mountains, the sand-grains of the Ganges, together with the myriad myriads of the stars, - all shall die. This achievement of the period coincides of course with the death of the Gods - "We knew these things! - we knew them! There must come an end even for the Gods" - a willed death since Gods and men cannot cohabit together. The chosen disappearance of the former is in</page><page sequence="16">900 M L N . . . le monde va devenir bougrement bete. D'ici a long- temps ce sera bien ennuyeux.

Il y a conjuration per- fact a rejection of the latter. In the words of an agonizing Jupiter: "I no longer desire to receive those [the souls] of men. Let the Earth keep them, and let them move upon the level of its baseness. Their hearts are now the hearts of slaves; they forget injuries, forget their ances- tors, forget their oaths; and everywhere the stupidity of crowds, the mediocrity of individu- als, the hideousness of races hold sway!" Jupiter's words find an echo in those of Flaubert who, in a letter to Louise Colet, writes: "But mediocrity is infiltrating everything, even the stones are becoming stupid . .. Should we perish by it (and we shall perish, though it matters little) we must be all means stem the flood of dung that is invading us.... We are all jokers and charla- tans. Pose, pose and blague everywhere!. .. Our century is a century of whores and the least prostituted of all up till now are the prostitutes themselves."

We shall see later the function of prostitution. For the moment let us note that Flaubert takes upon himself Jupiter's evaluation of humans. We come late in time, in an epoch when men have hearts of slaves, that is to say, when mastery and the differentiating elements between mas- tery and slavery have disappeared; when men live in forgetfulness of ethical values, that is to say when the distinction between God and Evil has been erased; when ancestors are forgotten, that is to say when genealogical hierarchies are minimized; differences between individuals are abolished in favor of crowds, in favor of the mediocre similarity of the individual members of hideous races which have lost their form.</page><page sequence="17">M L N 901 manente contre loriginal, voilat ce qu'il faut se fourrer dans la cervelle.

A middle course in action; measured conduct or It should be evident by now that for Flaubert, the death of the Gods is nothing more and no- thing less than the abolishment of differences and their general dissolution in the quicksands of similarity. We understand better now the failure of the writer to reach the summit of the mountain. The mountain represents topographically the greatest possible distance, that is, the maximum difference i.e. form. If the maximum difference is denied, the whole central partflattens out into a desert. The same can be said of the climatic conditions present in each topography. The mountain is cold and preserves each individual in its form; hence it preserves the differences between forms. Deserts, on the other hand, through their fiery heat - the ideal analyzer - decompose forms in order to reduce them to the undifferentiated similarity of their components. Mediocrity, the sign of our times, which condi- tions the author's endeavours, is nothing but the property of being in the middle away from the ends; the indifference of middling qualities. No doubt humanity does not stand up well against the state of undifferentiation to which it is doomed; it will try to recreate gods, religions and Art. In the desert it will be reduced to wor- shipping idols. "The time is not far off when universal languors, beliefs in the end of the world and in the coming of a Messiah will return. But since the theological basis will be missing, where will this enthusiasm, unconscious of its own existence, find its foothold! Some will look for it in the flesh, others in ancient religions, others in Art; and humanity, like the Jewish tribe in the desert, will adore all sorts of idols."

Flaubert The dilemma of the writer is evident; he can strive with nostalgia for forms forbidden to him or renounce art in favor of a science still to come, since, for Flaubert, science thrives on the very non-differentiation which torments art. In the words of his character Hilarion: "My kingdom is vast as the universe; and my desire knows no limits. I go on forever, - freeing minds, weigh- ing worlds, - without hatred, without fear, without pity, without love, and without God. Men call me SCIENCE!" Art and Science, then, are the two impossible limit points between which Flaubert's ironic, clo- ven text will oscillate.</page><page sequence="19">M L N 903 VI J'ai joue avec la demence et lefantastique comme Mithridate avec les poisons Flaubert When the narrator of Borges' The Immortal reaches the city of the immortals he finds a place so monstrous, so unstructured by differences that it cannot even be linguistically represented: "I do not want to describe it; a chaos of heterogeneous words, the body of a tiger or bull in which teeth, organs and heads monstrously pullulate in mutual conjunction and hatred can (perhaps) be approximate images."'15 His reac- tion to this discovery goes through three distinct moments: "'This palace is a fabrication of the gods,' I thought at the beginning. I explored the uninhabited interiors and corrected myself: 'The gods who built it have died.' I noted its peculiarities and said: 'The gods who built it were mad.'" Madness is the necessary limit experience of radical nihilism. Nietzsche is, of course, exem- plary here. Flaubert too is haunted by the experi- ence of madness and like Borges at one point in The Temptation has one of the characters exclaim: "The world is the work of a God in delirium!" The notion of a world created or dominated by a demented God does not ordinarily follow the proclamation of the death of God. The death of God has its own temporality, quite different from that implied by the eternal madness of God. The particular temporal mode of the death of God as something accomplished and yet to be accomplished is best illustrated by its most fam- ous version, namely in Aphorism 125 of the third part of The Joyful Wisdom. The aphorism is appropriately entitled The Madman and the bur- den of madness is shifted from God to man. The madman appears at noon holding a light, look- ing for God; meeting an assembly of persons many of whom are unbelievers, the madman answers their laughter with the narrative of God's death: "Whither is God . .. I shall tell you.</page><page sequence="20">904 M L N ... There is no help, The bitter disposition of the time Will have it so.

Flaubert Nature threw away the key; and woe to thefateful curiosity which might be able for a mo- ment to look out and down through a crevice in the chamber of consciousness and discover that man, indifferent to his own ignorance, is resting on the pitiless, the greedy, the insatiable, the murderous, and, as it were, hanging in dreams on the back of a tiger. Nietzsche We have killed him - you and I. All of us are his murderers. But how have we done this? How were we able to drink up the sea? Who gave the sponge to wipe away the entire horizon? What did we do when we unchained the earth from its sun? Whither is it moving now? Whither are we moving now? Away from all suns? Are we not plunging continually? Backwards, sidewards, forwards, in all directions? Is there any up or down left? Are we not straying as through an infinite nothing?" We can easily see how Nietzsche's text is isotopic with Flaubert's. In Nietzsche, too, we have the death of God as an impossible narrative told in conjunction with an experience of mad- ness, from a 'desert' which has neither up nor down, through the 'foggy' darkness of a world which is now detached from its sun. To accen- tuate the correspondence we may recall the devil's words to Anthony: "Ascend skyward for ever and for ever yet thou will not attain the summit. Descend below the earth for billions of billions of centuries: never wilt thou reach the bottom. For there is no summit, there is no bot- tom; there is no Above, no Below - nor height nor depth as signified by the terms of human utterance." Anthony's answer is also echoed in the words of the Madman: "A hideous cold freezes me, even to the depths of my soul! This is beyond the extreme of pain! It is like a death that is deeper than death!" But let us return to the aphorism and to the problem of the temporality of God's death: "I come too early he said then; my time has not come yet. This tremendous event is still on its way, still wandering - it has not yet reached the ears of man . . . deeds require time even after they are done before they can be seen and heard." The narration of the event is never temporally co- extensive with the event itself which is before and after but not now. More precisely, as event it is always before whereas the representational reading of the event is always yet to come. The forms of fiction are then the useless</page><page sequence="21">M L N 905 The story I wanted to tell is the encounter of two individuals who don't exist, since they are definable only with regard to a past or a future, a past and future whose reality is recip- rocally doubted.

Calvino This doctrinal item observed that the lottery is an interpola- tion of chance in the order of the world and that to accept errors is not to contradict chance -it is to corroborate it. Borges Ainsi le monde comme il est, le monde comme il va, le monde comme il vit, le monde absent desformalites abstraites, est il d'un coup, cette bibliotheque de Babel ou les livres desperses, disjectis, adoptent des formes reconnaissables, classables, et riglies: ce qui est ecrit dans ces tomes, c'est la pure multipli- cite. Le secret, des choses, c'est quil n'y a pas de secret. Serres epigones of a past event necessarily pre-dating its conceptual representation, that is to say, the reintegration of the absence of the event, for, as Derrida has reminded us, the body of the king is absent from the sarcophagus in the pyramid, or, in the words of the Madman: "What are these churches now if they are not the tombs and sepulchers of God?" In other words, the death of God marks the temporal/spatial moment of the oscillation of the limits of the Form of fiction, through which fic- tion attempts and fails to accede to the metaphysics of 'Truth' and 'Beauty'. It should be evident by now that, at least to my way of thinking, the world as governed or gen- erated by a mad God does not belong to the same epistemological space as the death of God. God's madness is discontinuous with the diacritical 'concepts' of Past/Future, Absence/Presence which govern the limits of representation and fiction. God's madness points to reality as non- representable such as in the city of the immor- tals, as non-accountable such as the world of chance in The Lottery of Babylon. In the case of Flaubert it is the explosion of fictional represen- tation into the chaotic linguistic labyrinth of the end of Bouvard and PNcuchet and the passage from the quest for narrative to the act of copying. The eternal reduplication of events unredeem- able by form. At that conjecture madness, of course, spills over into the act of inscribing mad- ness. The undertaking as well as the result is demented. If, as Flaubert says, in art and metaphysics one always navigates in madness, then the writing of 'mad' texts such as The Temp- tation or Bouvard and Pecuchet is equally de- mented: "One must be a madman and frenzied three times over to undertake that sort of book!" (1318)</page><page sequence="22">906 M L N VII Le Saint-Esprit estftminin Flaubert Palabras Neighbour Verges Shakespeare For Flaubert, as well as for his character An- thony, madness is an experience closely as- sociated with eroticism. "Madness and lust are two things which I have so well fathomed, where I have so well navigated by my will that I shall never become (I hope) a madman nor a Sade." (406) It should follow, then, that if the experi- ence of madness is closely related to narrative's quest for fiction, eroticism under the various guises of prostitution, lust or the Queen of Sheba must of necessity be related to the same experience. At some point in his delirium An- thony sees Nebuchadnezzar who "dreams of re- building the tower of Babel, and dethroning God". For an instant the Saint identifies with the character in the vision: "Anthony, from afar, reads all these thoughts upon his brow. They penetrate his own brain, and he becomes Nebuchadnezzar. Immediately he is cloyed with orgiastic excesses". After regaining his con- sciousness he asks the question, "Why these things?" and answers, "They come from the re- bellion of the flesh." This relation has a converse, that is to say, to the phantasmagoria of fiction generated by the desires of the flesh correspond the fantasies of desire generated by fiction. In fact, between Madame Bovary read as fiction which stages liter- ature as a disease of desire, and Bouvard and Pecuchet, the two asexual bachelors reduced to fantasizing phalluses everywhere, it is the sec- ond alternative which seems to be the more common. Bouvard and Pecuchet's obsession is interest- ing in as much as it shows how close sexuality is to words: "Thus the tumulus signifies the female, as the upright stone is the male organ.... At one time towers, pyramids, candles, mile-posts, and</page><page sequence="23">M L N 907 La Tentation de (saint) Flaubert Valery The Saint in whom God takes pleasure is the ideal castrate Nietzsche COIT, COPULATION Mots a eviter.

In fact, then, sexuality is related to language by the very nature of the latter since sexuality can stand in a relation of sign, simile or metaphor to words and things alike. This leads to a contradictory exigency, for on the one hand language and fiction have to dis- tance themselves from sexuality, yet sexuality cannot be done away with since it has to be post- ulated as origin or end. For Flaubert the unre- solvable alternative is between writing and a life associated with desire. "When I do not hold a book or dream of writing one I am overtaken by such boredom that I want to scream. Life seems to me tolerable only if one can conjure it away (La vie ne me semble tolerable que si on l'escamote). Otherwise one would have to surrender oneself to disorderly pleasures" (1385), for "Desire makes one live" (1716) and "so as not to live, I immerse myself in Art as if mad. I intoxicate myself with ink as others do with wine." (629) This ascetic quest will not dispel the creatures of desire who will haunt Flaubert/Anthony under various guises in the desert/library. Their names are well-known: Annonaria, who returns three times to torment the hermit, "that black child who appeared to me in the midst of the sands, who was very beautiful, and who told me that he was called the Spirit of Lust", Maximilla, Priscilla, who left her husband to follow a eunuch in the desert, the last of the prophetesses after whom "the end of the world shall come". The two most important ones remain the Queen of Sheba and Helen-Ennoia. The Queen of Sheba, in fact, contains all of the possible creatures generated by desire's im- agination; she is the world invested by the total- ity of desire; more precisely, she is desire made flesh. "All the woman thou hast ever met - from the leman of the cross-roads, singing under the light of her lantern, even to the patrician lady scattering rose-petals abroad from her litter, all the forms thou hast ever obtained glimpses of</page><page sequence="24">.908 M L N Caius Cesar Caligula en est devenu amoureux, puisqu'il voulait coucher avec la Lune! Flaubert No, the Moon is a desert, that was the answer of the poet. From that arid spaces origi- nates every tale, poem and every journey. Calvino Je n'ai jamais pu voir passer aux feux du gaz une de ces femmes decolletees, sous la pluie, sans un battement de coeur, de meme que les robes - all the imaginations of thy desire - thou hast only to ask for them! I am not a woman: I am a world!" Not surprisingly she is a source for fiction: "I know a host of merry tales to tell, each more diverting than the other"; through her bird Simorg-Anka she is desire's totalization of all events recast in fictional representation - in a word, the writer's impossible dream of a total text: "He flies swiftly as Desire! He circles the world in his flight. At eve he returns; he perches at the foot of my couch and tells me all he has seen - the seas that have passed far beneath him with all their fishes and ships, the great void deserts he has contemplated from the heights of the sky, the harvests that were bowing in the valleys, and the plants that were growing upon the walls of cities abandoned." In a letter to Bouilhet Flaubert defined the form of The Temp- tation as that of a whirlwind, since the Queen of Sheba's imperative invitation to the saint to "in- hale the perfume of my bosom, madden thyself with the beauty of my limbs: and thus consumed by the fire of my eyes, clasped within my arms as in a whirlwind" is nothing less than an invitation to possess the very form, that is to say, possess the very fiction in which the Author/Saint is a character. Helen also "discourses of marvellous things" and personifies the totality of desire but in the form of unfulfilling availability: "She was that Helen of Troy, whose memory was cursed by the poet Stesichorus. She was Lucretia, the patrician woman violated by a king. She was Delilah, by whom Samson's locks were shorn. . . . She has loved adultery, idolatry, lying and foolishness. She has prostituted herself to all nations. She has sung at the corners of all crossroads. She has kissed the faces of all men." We may now understand better Flaubert's ref- erence to prostitution that I quoted earlier. Prostitution is the availability of desire and if desire is available then the form of fiction is available; unfortunately they both belong to a</page><page sequence="25">M L N 909 des moines avec leur cordeliere a noeuds me chatouillent l'ime enje ne sais quels coins asciti- ques et profonds.

There I used to think of Isaiah and of 'fornica- tion in high places'.. . . I have only one reproach to make to prostitution, it is that it is a myth. The courtesan does not exist any more than the saint does...." (394) The writer will have to remain for ever in a state of suspended and unfulfilled desire. Satis- faction - which Flaubert calls "Fouterie" - is "projection into infinity". (312) Meanwhile, the impotent writer continues, knowing full well his incapacity to reach a satisfactory end: "I apply myself to it, not because I am inspired in the least, but because I would like to see this. it is a sort of curiosity which one might qualify as a lustful desire without erection - (un desir lubri- que sans erection)." (547) The best emblem Flaubert finds for his doomed activity is that of an incurable venereal disease: "Yes, literature bores me to a supreme degree! but it is not my fault; it has become with me a constitutional pox of which I am unable to rid myself." (551) And this, with its connotations of infection, violence, organic malady and mad- ness is perhaps as good an emblem as any of fiction's hopeless quest for its ontology. I'm all for Daniel.
