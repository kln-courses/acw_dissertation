<plain_text><page sequence="1">242 M'Connachie are worth exploring on their native heath. Professor Geduld neglects M'Connachie, however, since he eliminates Barrie's speeches as "not central to the dis- cussion here," and it is in an address that Barrie presents M'Connachie. Also elimin- ated, strangely enough, from this Freudian investigation, are discussions of Barrie's cor- respondence and personality. What is admitted as "central" is "the prototypic story" allegedly found in all Barrie's fiction and drama. In this situation, CEdipal, of course, James is "the assassin or would-be killer of his brother" and/or father in order to remove a rival for his mother's and/or sisters' love. Geduld believes that Barrie's sentimentality results from a failure to transcend this story and find new subjects. As he infelicitously puts it, "All of Barrie's significant, non-journalistic works are dis- cussed as distortions of the prototypic ma- terial in order to expose the true nature of the sentimentalist 'deceptions' that many critics have recognized in Barrie's work." For Barrie's "'prototypic' autobiographical and psychological experiences," he draws on Margaret Ogilvy, although its emotions and events have already passed through the se- lective and revisionary process of literary creation, however compulsively. Neverthe- less, the analyst relentlessly subjects succes- sive works to his Procrustean prototype, until, as they limp away, the reader is more aware of the forcing than of any hoped-for enlightenment. It is disappointing that, after a tireless amassing of motifs, Professor Geduld should have disregarded the pos- sible subtleties in Barrie's narrow literary range, should have fallen back on a super- ficial application of a few psychoanalytic axioms, and, taking sentimentality simply as a pejorative, should have made no real at- tempt to deal with it as a recognizable liter- ary genre. JANE W. STEDMAN Roosevelt University Thomas Hardy: His Career as a Novelist, by Michael Millgate; pp. 428. Random House: New York, 1971, $10o.oo; The Bodley Head: London, 1971, ?4.20. MILLGATE'S EXCELLENT Thomas Hardy CON- siders Hardy's novels in relation to his life and its social and intellectual backgrounds. Not another study of Hardy's "philosophy," it observes that "The careers of Hardy's characters . . . are rarely if ever a product of the random inexplicable intrusion of fate but rather the . . . outcome of their own per- sonalities as conditioned ... by the forces of heredity and environment." Millgate traces influences upon Hardy's writing from Shakespeare, the Bible, Greek drama, and Victorian melodrama. Examining what is left of Hardy's notebooks, he points out, for ex- ample, that "two of the most sensational episodes in Tess - the death of Prince, the Durbeyfield horse, and that other blood- drenched moment when Mrs. Brooks of The Herons sees the spreading stain on her ceil- ing - both originated in newspaper reports." Such information makes the book useful not only to the Hardy scholar, but to the teacher whose students may think Hardy's plots forced. Chapters on the early novels picture Hardy experimenting with pastoral comedy in Under the Greenwood Tree, rural realism in Far from the Madding Crowd, and social comedy in Ethelberta. Calling Under the Greenwood Tree "the most nearly flawless of Hardy's novels," Millgate points out how "The recurrent dances effectively divide the group into the children, the young, the mid- dle-aged and the old, while the retrospective tendency of the conversation and the very antiquity of the customs . . . all promote a constant awareness that those who are old were once young and those now in the energy of their youth will soon become old in their turn." The scenes suggest "the Stinsford and Upper Bockhampton of Hardy's own child- hood." Millgate traces relationships among the novels. Pointing out in Blue Eyes the de- scriptions of sunrises and sunsets, "together with the jewels, the graveyards, and the mystifications of the plot," he remarks upon "that 'romantic' and theatrical quality in the novel which looks back to the sensationalism of Desperate Remedies and forward to the pastoral melodrama of Far from the Madding Crowd." In the latter "major work," he calls attention to the "bold theatricality of the narrative progression, the rich yet strictly functional evocation of setting, the earth- bound poetry of the dialogue," along with "a profusion of natural and domestic dis- VICTORIAN STUDIES</page><page sequence="2">243 asters, mysterious disappearances and dra- matic reappearances, the opening of a coffin, a revenge-murder, and a last-minute reprieve from the gallows." He defines Troy's "de- liberate system of sexual assault" in the sword-exercise, "researched" in Hardy's copy of Infantry Sword Exercises. Analysis includes comment on the rustic "chorus" and character contrasts. Troy is "effective as a foil to Boldwood; where the latter is slow, massive, profoundly obsessive, Troy is quick, light, and casual." Forces in The Native are pagan, classic, Christian, and Darwinian. In picturing Eustacia, Hardy, straining to create a rich personality, used too many cosmetic meta- phors, associating Eustacia with Sappho, Mrs. Siddons, Artemis, Athena, Hera, Bourbon roses, rubies, tropical midnights, lotos-eaters, and "the march in Athalie." He presented Egdon with such "anthropomorphic elabora- tion" that it is often called a character. (Mill- gate says little of Hardy's animism.) Egdon is a microcosm, the world of the characters, which Hardy sought to make his readers ex- perience as he had done for years. Millgate speaks of The Trumpet-Major's "dance-like pattern of courtship and rivalry and . . . its profusion of stock characters: a genteel widow and her marriageable daugh- ter; a jolly miller and his rival sons, one a soldier and the other a sailor; a comic miser and his miles gloriosus of a nephew." Two on a Tower might have anticipated twentieth- century science fiction, but Hardy left his stellar universe more a muted point of view than a factor in the action. Millgate comments that "Casterbridge" was the Dorchester Hardy had known as a child. Analyzing the Mayor's character, he concludes that "Self-made, Henchard is also self-destroyed; if he feels pursued, it is essen- tially himself that he cannot escape." In con- sidering Tess, Millgate rejects Alec as villain and asserts that Angel wrought the major disaster: "If Alec sacrifices Tess to his lust, Angel sacrifices her to his theory of womanly purity.... and Hardy has no hesitation in assigning to the latter the greater blame." Millgate points to items the casual reader might feel but not meditate: "The sight of Tess on the altar at Stonehenge looks back to Alec on the d'Urberville tomb and beyond that to Angel laying Tess in the abbot's tomb. . . . It is a marvellous touch of Hardy's to present the murder as if through the unin- volved, commonplace eyes of Mrs. Brooks, the Sandbourne landlady, and in terms which suggest a lurid newspaper report." Millgate finds Jude an inadequate expression of Hardy's views, saying, "If the intellectual concepts embodied in Jude do not cohere, that is perhaps because . . . Hardy conceived and composed his last novel as a comprehensive image of intellectual and social chaos." Millgate has chapters on "The Dorset- shire Labourer," "The Evolution of Wessex," "Candour in English Fiction," and "Hardy in the Theatre." Fourteen pages on the Dorsetshire laborer present the background for Hardy's portraits of rural life. The chap- ter on Wessex examines the facts in Hardy's notebooks from which he drew fictional scenes. Millgate's study is a perceptive, thoughtful analysis of Hardy's methods and meanings. Re-examining much that is found in previous scholarship, it is a book for any teacher presenting Hardy's novels to ponder and recommend to his students. J. 0.

SOMETHING WHICH CAN ONLY BE CALLED A Mayhew revival is evident in Victorian studies these days. Until about six years ago, Henry Mayhew's volumes on London labor and the Victorian poor, although well-known, had not received much scholarly attention. The resulting ignorance about the publish- ing history of his work led to errors in judg- ment not only about his intentions but also about the period he was concerned to de- scribe. (All the material was collected and most of it published in parts five to twelve years before the four volumes of London Labour and the London Poor appeared in 1861-62. This work dates from all three pe- riods of Mayhew's investigations: 1849-50, last half of volume III; 1851-52, volumes I and II and part of IV; I856, first half of volume III.) In 1965, however, John L. Bradley pub- lished his selections from London Labour with a long biographical introduction; in 1967-68 the four volumes were reprinted in DECEMBER 1971</page></plain_text>
