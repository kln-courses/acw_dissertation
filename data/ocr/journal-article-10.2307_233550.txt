Not quite as propaedeutic as its title and size might suggest, this slim volume ranges far beyond semantics and imagery. It dis- penses with such conveniences as a pref- ace, conclusion, bibliography, and index verborum; the footnotes contain fewer ref- erences than substantive clarifications. Drawing on a comprehensive exegesis of writings by Paracelsus and his followers, Giancarlo Zanier presents a primarily philo- sophical profile. He manages to avoid any suggestion of a "system," in part because his style echoes the paradoxes and para- boles of his subject, but also because his essay is loosely structured. By the same token, his four nearly self-contained chapters defy precise summarization under the headings of language and epistemology, views of matter and human nature, cosmol- ogy and meteorology, and the relation be- tween tradition and iconoclasm. Without applying linguistic analysis, Zanier emphasizes the anthropocentric basis and the pedagogical purpose of the Paracelsian vocabulary. Neologisms were intended to point the reader forcefully away from conventional abstractive schemes and toward the complex web of intuitions that yield true knowledge. The ultimate and God-given source of knowl- edge (as well as of human potential and ac- tion) is the stellar reality. In the noetic cor- respondence between macrocosm and microcosm, matter is constituted both of the four elements and, in a variety of am- biguous relationships, of the three "first principles" (salt, sulfur, and mercury). An- other ambiguity or "oscillation" appears between two images of man, one dichoto- mous (immaterial/corporeal) and the other trichotomous (divine soul/corruptible body/ astral entity, with the last, as spiritus mundi, linking body and soul); in both rep- resentations, however, juxtaposition re- places the integration that was paramount for Aristotle. We are told that nothing-not even Galenist medicine-irritated Para- celsus more than the order and harmony of Aristotelian cosmology: his own universe was defined by anthropomorphic phy- siology and characterized by cacophony; hence, meteorological phenomena became the exudations and excretions of stellar life.</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS-ISIS, 82: 1: 311 (1991) 131 Neither the cosmological framework nor, more surprisingly, the medical mainsprings carry much weight in the last chapter, where Paracelsian alchemy is assessed in the light of balneology and the Hippocratic tradition. Zanier consistently relates Paracelsus to the humanist context, while maintaining a careful balance between the originality and indebtedness of his contributions. He takes issue, however, with recent "revisionists" who suggest a linear development of al- chemy, elaborate the continued influence of Neoplatonism and gnosticism, or stress the importance of popular medicine. Spe- cialists may find little new here about the uniqueness and quintessence of Paracel- sianism. Other readers, even the logically inclined who feel more comfortable with the elegant clarity of Walter Pagel, will be stimulated by Zanier's erudite, if some- times mystical, musings. LUKE E.
