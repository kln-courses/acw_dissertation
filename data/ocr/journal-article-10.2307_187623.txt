<plain_text><page sequence="1">DEVELOPMENTAL DECOMPOSITION AND THE FUTURE OF HUMAN BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY* PHILIP KITCHERt Department of Philosophy University of California/San Diego I attempt to complement my earlier critiques of human sociobiology, by of- fering an account of how evolutionary ideas might legitimately be employed in the study of human social behavior. The main emphasis of the paper is the need to integrate studies of proximate mechanisms and their ontogenesis with func- tional/evolutionary research. Human psychological complexity makes it impos- sible to focus simply on specific types of human behavior and ask for their functional significance. For any of the kinds of behavior patterns that have oc- cupied human sociobiologists, the underlying proximate mechanisms are very likely to be linked to a broad spectrum of types of behavior, and we cannot expect that natural selection will have acted directly on any individual element from this spectrum. I illustrate this general point with a specific example, con- sidering the traditional sociobiological account of human incest-avoidance and outlining an alternative approach to the phenomena. The example is intended to show the possibility of a more rigorous and sophisticated successor to human sociobiology, which I call "human behavioral ecology". 1. Introduction. Every gardener knows the problem. Simply removing the weeds from your soil is useless, for the bare space that results will surely be invaded anew unless you take more active steps, introducing and nurturing the varieties of plants that you want. Similarly, a critique of human sociobiology that simply uproots the current occupants of this part of the intellectual landscape will not suffice. Effective criticism should supply the seeds for a new enterprise. In my (1985) I surveyed the main efforts of sociobiologists to provide conclusions about human social behavior. On the view I developed (see especially chapter 4), the field of sociobiology is generated through the *Received December 1987. tAncestors of parts of this paper were presented to audiences at the Indiana University of Pennsylvania interdisciplinary conference on mind and brain, the 1986 meeting of the British Society for the Philosophy of Science, the 1986 meeting of the Philosophy of Sci- ence Association, the Institute for Child Development at the University of Minnesota, and the UCLA Behavioral Biology Seminar. I am grateful to many people in these audiences for their valuable comments, and, in particular, to Rob Boyd, Robert Hinde, Jerry Fodor (twice), and Kim Sterelny. Conversations and correspondence with Bill Charlesworth, Alan Sroufe, and Donald Symons have also enlightened me on many points, and I am extremely grateful to Michael Dietrich for his research assistance. Above all, I want to thank Patrick Bateson for much advice and encouragement and Lisa Hirschman for her gentle guidance through the eddies of the clinical literature on incest.

Nobody can protest that application in principle, even when the species under study is our own. However, there are deep confusions in attempting to use evolutionary analyses to resolve the nature-nurture problem or to erect a grand theory of human nature. (See the different enterprises of Wilson (1978) and Alexander (1979) and the critique in Kitcher (1985) chapters 1, 4, 6, and 9.) Thus, part of the sociobiological enterprise as it has sometimes and most popularly been conceived, should be simply aban- doned. What remains should be thoroughly cleansed. For, as my (1985) also endeavored to show, the applications of evolutionary ideas to human social behavior are notably less rigorous and careful than the best work in the evolutionary study of the behavior of nonhuman animals. Homo sapiens has an evolutionary history and it is reasonable to think that there must be some connection of some kind between that history and our social behavior. The challenge is to specify the connection. In three previous articles (Kitcher 1987a, 1987b, 1987c), I have offered a blueprint for the transformation of human sociobiology, insisting on the disavowal, once and for all, of inferences about genetic determination of traits, on the need for precise models and detailed data, and on the im- portance of recognizing the role of cultural transmission in the history of human social practices. However, this does not complete my task, for as I have argued (especially in chapter 9 of Kitcher 1985), evolutionary anal- ysis simplistically applied to overt behavior, rather than to the proximate and developmental mechanisms that underlie behavior, can easily gen- erate mistakes and confusions. The blueprint presented in my (1987a, 1987b, 1987c) urges integrating evolutionary studies with inquiries into proximate and developmental mechanisms. My goal here is to elaborate this suggestion, which I (like Gould 1986) regard as the most important step in the replacement of the "cardboard Darwinism" of traditional hu- man sociobiology with a more adequate way of introducing biology into the social sciences. 2. Behavioral Ecology and Functional Description. Following Niko Tinbergen's famous taxonomy of questions for ethology (1968), we can distinguish four different inquiries. The first concentrates on the proxi- mate mechanisms of the behavior, seeking a physiological or psycholog- ical description of the immediate causes. The second looks further back in the causal history, searching for the factors in ontogeny that bring about the proximate mechanisms. In addition to such developmental in- vestigations, there are also efforts to identify the function of behavior. Here the investigator tries to offer an analysis of the fitness differences among various forms of behavior, with the aim of showing how the form actually found might be maintained by selection. Finally, there are his-</page><page sequence="3">98 PHILIP KITCHER torical questions directed at eliciting the causes that figured in the orig- ination of the behavior in the species (or some ancestral species). When the species lacks any significant system of cultural transmission, histor- ical questions are likely to become evolutionary questions, and the an- swers may well involve offering an account of the selection processes through which the behavior originated. Nonetheless, as sophisticated stu- dents of behavior are well aware, the selection pressure (if any) that fig- ures in the origination of behavior may be quite different from the se- lection pressure (if any) that maintains it. Functional and historical inquiries are related but distinct. Some sociobiologists-most prominently those who prefer to call themselves "behavioral ecologists"-have illuminated aspects of non- human animal behavior by constructing ecological models that identify the sources of the fitnesses in alternative forms of animal behavior. In the best work (see, for two examples, Woolfenden and Fitzpatrick (1985) and the essays in Krebs and Davies (1984)), we find precise models allied to detailed observations, the articulation and testing of rival hypotheses, and even some attention to possibilities of nongenetic transmission. There is no misguided commitment to the idea of solving nature-nurture prob- lems or of undertaking the impossible task of deriving conclusions about the norms of reaction of (typically unknown) genotypes from premises about the selection pressures that operate in maintaining behavior. These studies advance our understanding of behavior by supplying a description of what the animals are doing, a description that may replace an incorrect, possibly anthropomorphic, conceptualization of the situation that has been adopted almost unconsciously, or that may introduce order into a situation that we find confusing. A male baboon picks up a juvenile baboon at the approach of a larger heavier male, and, with the juvenile in his arms, the smaller adult male turns to face the newcomer. Is he protecting the young baboon? Appeasing a dominant male? Trying to im- press an onlooking female? Male speckled wood butterflies descend from the canopy and gyrate in the patches of sunlight below. What are they about? In cases like these, behavioral ecologists attempt to find a func- tional description of the behavior by relating the observed movements to hypothetical selection pressures that maintain the disposition to perform such movements. 3. Human Behavioral Ecology: Promises and Pitfalls. Human socio- biology-or, as I shall henceforth call it, in hopes of producing an ex- ercise in imitation, human behavioral ecology-might prove as enlight- ening. There's no reason why we should not correct our naive views about the significance of various forms of human social behavior in a way that is exactly parallel to the tutoring of naive observations in non- human behavioral ecology. If the behavioral ecologist continues to be</page><page sequence="4">THE FUTURE OF HUMAN BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY 99 rigorous and careful, what's the difference between studying butterflies and focusing on human beings? The most obvious dissimilarity consists in the fact that there are sys- tems of cultural transmission that operate in human societies that might maintain a behavioral trait in opposition to natural selection, so that in using natural selection as a guide to forming evolutionary expectations, we might be misled. Specifically, we can ask if there are possible systems of cultural transmission that can divert a population from an equilibrium it would have attained under natural selection and whether such systems can themselves be maintained in the face of selection. Thanks to the ef- forts of Boyd and Richardson (1985), we know that the answer to the last question is "Yes". Hence, the task of the human behavioral ecologist should apparently be to construct analyses of the maintenance of human traits that take account both of the selection pressures and of the effects of cultural transmission. Boyd and Richardson's work holds two different morals for human behavioral ecology. Traditional human sociobiology has sought to explain two different kinds of things: distributions of individual behavior and so- cial institutions. So, to anticipate the example I'll consider below, we can try to explain the frequency with which incest occurs among siblings, why it occurs just where it does, or on the other hand, we can attempt to explain the presence of incest taboos in different societies. Only the former explanatory task is strictly analogous to the endeavors pursued by behavioral ecologists studying nonhuman animals, and my aim will be to understand how this kind of task should be undertaken in the case of our own species. The first moral is that explanations of individual behavior need to take into account systems of cultural transmission. The second is that, in pursuing the more ambitious enterprise (not considered in this essay) of accounting for the origin and maintenance of social institutions, the models of transmission adduced by Boyd and Richardson may be profoundly relevant. (Kitcher (1987c) offers a sketch of how this larger project might go.) Cultural transmission affects us at many stages of our development, and the multiplicity of the influences raises a further complication for human behavioral ecology. The human case is different from that of but- terflies-although it may not be different from that of the higher primates and the social carnivores-in that serious attributions of function are heavily dependent on presuppositions about proximate and developmental mech- anisms. Evolutionary and developmental studies need to be pursued in tandem. 4. Developmental Constraints and Evolutionary Simplicity. I'll pro- ceed by offering an abstract account of the difficulty, followed by a rel- atively detailed example. The latter will be intended to show not only</page><page sequence="5">100 PHILIP KITCHER LOCI PHENOTYPIC TRAITS Llie L2* _ *P1 L3* * P2 L4 * _5 _* _ _ _ 0 P 3 L6@ Figure 1 how human behavioral ecology might go astray, but also how it might overcome the problem posed by the existence of developmental con- straints. Behavioral ecology will work straightforwardly when the proximo-de- velopmental connection between genes and behavior is evolutionarily simple. Consider the very simplest type of organism, one for which the internal causes of behavior are as depicted in Figure 1. If an animal ex- emplifies this simple kind of causal picture, we can enhance our under- standing of what it is doing by thinking in terms of what would contribute to reproductive success. Tacitly, we suppose that there are alternative alleles available at one of the loci, that these correlate with the forms of the behavioral trait and that selection maintains alleles generating superior forms of the trait. Matters do not change if allelic substitutions do modify characteristics besides the target trait provided that these ancillary sub- stitutions are selectively neutral (see Figure 2). So I'll say that a causal net encompassing the internal factors that affect a behavioral trait is ev- olutionarily simple just in case the difference in expected reproductive success given an allelic substitution is due to the difference in just one facet of the behavioral phenotype. Suppose however, that the animal we are studying instantiates some- thing like Figure 3. We imagine that there are probabilities associated with the connections among the nodes, and these probabilities are set by the external environment. Assume for the moment that all members of the populations under study face a common external environment so that the probabilistic connections are the same in each case. Unless we are very lucky, and the situation reverts to the type of evolutionary simplicity depicted in Figure 2, there will be obvious limits on the power of selec- tion to shape an individual phenotypic trait.

The forms of P2 and P3 are also changed, but without change in selective value. Figure 2 by selection will be a behavioral spectrum or some underlying disposition that is implicated in each of the elements of a behavioral spectrum. Matters are likely to be far more intricate than I have represented them as being. Some of the critical allelic variation available in a population may not only affect the forms of the behavioral traits in which we are interested but also modify the structure of the causal trees that underlie them. This is especially obvious if one considers the relatively large ways PHENOTYPIC LOCI TRAITS Ll L2 L3 L4 Substitutions at LI affect the selective value of the forms of P1, P2, P3. Figure 3</page><page sequence="7">102 PHILIP KITCHER in which substitution of alleles might affect behavior. Imagine that an allelic substitution changes the form of a particular neurotransmitter. The consequence may be that a young child responds in abnormal ways to certain types of stimuli. That early effect is likely to have consequences of its own: parents and others who interact with the child may do so in atypical ways, thus provoking an abnormal sequence of events in indi- vidual ontogeny. An early deviance may be magnified in a whole variety of ways as the child comes to encounter an unorthodox developmental environment. More abstractly, the causal connections depicted in Figures like 2 and 3 may vary with the substitutions at certain loci because un- derlying allelic combinations affect the probabilistic connections among nodes in the causal tree. While it is hardly controversial that some complex causal structure un- derlies human behavior, there is room for much debate on how to inter- pret the kinds of diagrams I have drawn. What exactly are these con- nected nodes and what do the connecting lines represent? There are as many competing answers as there are views about the study of the prox- imate mechanisms and the ontogeny of behavior. Because none of these views has won anything like universal acceptance, there has been hope in some quarters that human behavioral ecology might enlighten us. To succeed, we need to know the ways in which various forms of behavior are bound together by connections among their proximate mech- anisms. We need what Darwin called "the laws of correlation and bal- ance". The task does not require that we fathom the full details of the ontogeny of behavior, but that we delineate the structure of the causal trees that link the genes to aspects of the phenotype (possible facets of morphology and physiology as well as behavioral traits). If we are en- tirely ignorant about this structure, then there is a very real danger that we shall focus on the wrong explananda. Developmental and proximate studies cannot furnish ready-made con- straints for investigations of the functions of human behavior. Our ig- norance of the relevant facts about development and about how to char- acterize the proximate mechanisms is usually, as Darwin would say, profound. But, lacking any information about how patterns of behavior are interconnected and bound together into spectra that selection can either maintain or modify, specifications of the selective advantage of a partic- ular piece of behavior are, at best, stabs in the dark. How then, can the investigation of human behavior possibly proceed? I think only by a ten- tative and exploratory attempt to combine the two types of study. We must free ourselves both from the illusion that some nascent human be- havioral ecology will clarify mysteries about proximate mechanisms and behavioral ontogeny and from trying to foster some proximo-develop- mental inquiry that will beg no questions about function.' We need to</page><page sequence="8">THE FUTURE OF HUMAN BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY 103 fuse the enterprise of evolutionary analysis with that of developmental decomposition, an integration that must be tentative since we start from nothing that is firm, but that may prove usefully exploratory if the two investigations are used to constrain one another. 5. Incest Avoidance: The Westermarck Hypothesis. So much for the abstract and general part of my story. How does it translate into concrete advice for a concrete situation? I shall try to dispel the fear that my ecu- menicism is too nebulous by showing how the perspective I recommend can be elaborated in a particular example. One of the favorite cases of human sociobiology is human incest-avoid- ance. The orthodox story consists in a revival of the Westermarck hy- pothesis (see Bischof 1972; van den Berghe 1983; Shepher 1983). For our purposes, the hypothesis may be divided into three parts: (a) In the course of normal ontogeny, people acquire a disposition to avoid copulating with those with whom they have been reared, and because this disposition is almost universally acquired the frequency of incest (at least among siblings) is low. (b) The disposition to avoid copulating with those with whom one has been reared is selectively advantageous because it will typ- ically lead its bearers to refrain from mating with close kin and producing offspring that combine deleterious recessive alleles. (c) The taboos on incest that are prominent in many societies are the expression of a prior hostility toward copulations with kin; they are not major proximate factors in preventing incest. Quite evidently, this cluster of claims involves ideas about the mecha- nisms of behavior and about the evolutionary forces that have shaped behavior. What I want to expose for scrutiny is the notion that there is a unitary phenomenon, incest-avoidance, that is susceptible to evolution- ary analysis. Let us briefly rehearse some of the evidence that stands behind the Westermarckian revival. Studies of mate choice in a number of species yielded some striking results: Patrick Bateson (1980, 1982) has shown that Japanese quail prefer to mate with %onspecifics who are different, but not too different, from themselves; Ann Pusey (1980) has documented a change in patterns of association among chimpanzees at the times that 1Alexander seems to me to be correct when he points out the difficulty of seeking for developmental constraints in advance of making any decision about functional description (1979, p. 101), but the correct conclusion to draw is not that human behavioral ecology can operate independently of proximo-developmental studies. Rather primitive ideas about functionality must be refined in the light of equally primitive views about development, and conversely. The hope is that iterations of such mutual refinement will lead us to de- fensible views in both areas of inquiry.</page><page sequence="9">104 PHILIP KITCHER females first become estrous-newly mature females forsake their for- merly favorite male associates (typically, though not exclusively, kin). In a study of marriages and romantic liaisons among Israelis who had been brought up from infancy in the same kibbutz, Shepher offered the initially compelling finding that nonsiblings (who were thus under no pressure to avoid sexual relationships) brought up together did not be- come sexually involved with one another. A similar example, the insti- tution of arranged "minor marriages" once found in Taiwan, seems to support Shepher's conclusions: the marriages of women who had been adopted as the designated spouse of an adoptive brother had a higher rate of divorce and a lower incidence of children than ordinary marriages (Wolf and Huang 1980). Finally, a much-cited study comparing the frequencies of birth defects in two Czech populations, one consisting of the offspring of incestuous unions and one of the non-incestuous offspring of the moth- ers involved, seems to show that copulations between close kin are more likely to produce defective children than other matings (Seemanova 1971). Some of this recent evidence for the Westermarck hypothesis has been criticized. Shepher's conclusions from the kibbutz are vulnerable to the charge that the young people whose careers he followed were reared at a time when the educational policy emphasized ideological commitment and an almost puritanical attitude on sexual matters (see Kaffman (1977); there are hints of similar pressures in Talmon (1964), see especially p. 503). John Hartung has also charged that Shepher's statistics are worth- less because he has no adequately formulated null hypothesis (Hartung 1985). Careful reading of the Wolf and Huang study of minor marriages reveals that there are many potentially interfering factors that might be adduced to offer alternative explanations of the low success rate of minor marriages-most prominently the contempt that is often expressed for the institution, contempt that frequently surfaces in childhood and adolescent teasing. The significance of the Seemanova study can be disputed on grounds that the children of incest were often conceived and born under conditions that promote a higher incidence of birth defects independently of inbreeding (one obvious factor here is the age of the mother). Finally, as becomes clear as soon as one thinks about serious modeling of mating behavior, the costs of inbreeding might be outweighed by costs associated with exogamy (for example, dangers associated with migration-see Bengtsson 1978; May 1979). Besides these specific objections, there's a major worry about part (c) of the Westermarck hypothesis. Why should there be a taboo on behavior that people are not disposed to perform? (For a forceful recent restatement of the problem, see Lewontin, Rose, and Kamin 1984.) Interestingly, some anthropologists, especially those inspired by Freud, contend that the strength of a taboo reflects not so much the extent to which there is</page><page sequence="10">THE FUTURE OF HUMAN BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY 105 a disposition to refrain from the banned act, but the strength of the re- pressed wish to engage in that act (see Spiro 1982). On this account, incest taboos are viewed as the public expression of a psychodynamic conflict, and they can be expected to play an important role in the etiology of individual behavior. Moreover, if the psychodynamic view is even partially correct, then it appears that we ought to scrutinize closely the notion that those who are reared together do not become sexually attracted to one another after they reach puberty-whether or not the attraction is actually expressed in overt sexual behavior. Part (c) of the hypothesis should be abandoned. There's no reason to think that the presence of a taboo is simply the generalized expression of individual horror at the idea of incest. As explicitly noted above, my concern will be with explaining individual behavior in order to understand the frequencies and conditions of incest and of incest-avoidance. Can we do better than (a) and (b) by integrating the functional considerations on which Westermarck and his successors draw with attention to proximate mechanisms and their ontogeny? 6. Incest-Avoidance: Preliminary Clarifications. The newly trimmed version of the Westermarck hypothesis potentially explains the frequency of three different kinds of behavior: sexual activity among relatives reared together (expected to have low frequency), sexual activity among non- relatives reared together (also expected to have low frequency), and sex- ual activity among relatives not reared together who meet for the first time as adults (not necessarily expected to be low). Now there are at least three areas of important vagueness both in the hypothesis and in the phe- nomena that it is supposed to cover. First, what kinds of relationships are to be included in the scope of the hypothesis? Second, what exactly do we require for people to be reared together? Third, and most important, what is to count as sexual activity? The most obvious ways to answer the first two questions are to say that the Westermarck hypothesis is concerned with sibling incest and that two individuals are reared together just in case they are brought up in the same household and interact with the same family members (parents, sib- lings, and other caregivers) from birth on. But now it is worth posing two questions. First, if we narrow the scope of the Westermarckian account so that it only deals with siblings, how is the account to be integrated into a more general view of the causes of incest-avoidance? Consider the father-daughter relationship. Should we suppose that daughters acquire a disposition to avoid sexual relations with fathers just as they do with respect to brothers, but that fathers do not develop any such disposition with respect to their daughters? If so, then some new factor-perhaps fear of being punished</page><page sequence="11">106 PHILIP KITCHER for engaging in a forbidden form of behavior?-would have to be ad- duced to explain why fahers do not more frequently coax or coerce their daughters into sexual activity.2 It would then have to be shown why the newly invoked factor does not play a primary role in avoidance of incest among siblings. Furthermore, notice that we cannot now mount an ar- gument parallel to (c) in our formulation of the Westermarck hypothesis to explain why the sexually coercive behavior of fathers is forbidden. Second, except in the case of twins, there will always be an asymmetry in siblings' rearing environments. One child, the elder, will have under- gone a period of his/her development without any contact with the younger, and throughout their development, each will have different interactions with the other. Presumably, the perfect case for the Westermarck hy- pothesis is that of twins in whom the disposition to avoid post-pubertal sexual contact can be expected to develop as completely as it ever does. It is interesting to note that this is not only a prominent case for sibling incest in mythology, but that there is one case in the clinical literature of an incestuous relationship between male identical twins, reared together from birth, that persisted (intermittently) for 23 years from the age of 6 (see Laymon 1982). The most fundamental issue to be resolved in clarifying the Wester- marck hypothesis concerns what is meant by "sexual activity". Any at- tempt to review the vast literature on incest will turn up numerous def- initions. In some earlier anthropological writings, incest is closely linked to marriage, and rules forbidding marriages among close kin are regarded 21 should note that the clinical literature of father-daughter incest is relatively rich and detailed by comparison with that on sibling incest. This may suggest that father-daughter incest occurs more frequently than sibling incest, although as Meiselman (1979) lucidly points out, some rather basic facts about reproduction suggest that there will be more opportunities for father-daughter incest than for sibling incest (every daughter has a father, most have fathers or father-surrogates who are present in the household; not every daughter has a sibling of appropriate age and sex to be a potential sexual partner). The situation is further complicated by the fact that studies of convicted incest offenders (for example, Weinberg 1955) as well as clinical studies in which reports of incest emerge in the course of therapy (Meiselman 1979) are more likely to involve episodes in which one more pow- erful individual has coerced a weaker person into sexual activity. Sibling incest may be underreported both because it has less traumatic effects (assuming that it does) and because parents do not want to risk losing their children by notifying authorities about such inci- dents. In a pioneering study, David Finkelhor (1979) administered a questionnaire to a sample of college students, and obtained interesting results about the frequency and type of child- hood sexual experiences. Approximately one quarter of the respondents reported a child- hood sexual experience with a relative or near-relative, and for each sex, approximately one half of the instances involved siblings. Father-daughter instances were significantly less frequent than brother-sister cases-and even than sister-sister cases (see Finkelhor 1979, p. 87). Perhaps the clearest point to emerge from the literature is that mother-son incest is far less common than father-daughter incest. A well-argued attempt to explain the asymmetry is Herman and Hirschman (1977).</page><page sequence="12">THE FUTURE OF HUMAN BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY 107 as prohibitions on incest (see, for major examples, Tylor (1888) and Levi- Strauss (1969)). This linkage is surely inappropriate, for as Robin Fox lucidly points out (1980, chapter 1), incest is about sex, not marriage. More recent anthropologists, especially those who have drawn inspiration from sociobiology (Shepher, van den Berghe), favor a narrow definition: at the narrowest extreme, we may say that incest only occurs when there is full sexual intercourse between close relatives (coefficient of relation- ship no less than 0.25) who are of opposite sex and who have been con- tinuously together since the birth of the younger. Clinicians who are con- cerned with the plight of incest victims typically adopt a much more inclusive definition, allowing cases in which participants engage in mu- tual masturbation, fondling, intra-femoral intercourse, homosexual inter- course, oral-genital contact, and even exhibition of the genitals to count as cases of consummated incest.3 The most liberal conception is that of Judith Herman who takes the sexual relationship in incest to be any phys- ical contact that has "to be kept a secret" (1981, p. 70). This definition obviously allows for the confusion of sexual contacts with other types of physical abuse; but for a clinician who is concerned with the causes of abuse, with the prevention of abuse, and with the treatment of those who have been victimized, that is unlikely to be problematic. For our purposes, I suggest that we take an incestuous advance to be any action that expresses sexual feelings toward a family member. Family members are characterized disjunctively, either as relatives with a coef- ficient of relationship of 0. 125 or greater or as people who share the same household. (There are biological family members, sociological family members, and of course, family members who satisfy both criteria.) An incestuous act occurs when the agent's sexual feelings receive their full expression: crudely, the agent gets what he (or she, but it is usually he) wants. The act is reciprocal when both (or all) participants have sexual feelings that are fully expressed in it. My suggested definition allows most of the clinicians' cases to be in- cluded. Why is it an appropriate way to think about incest? The signif- icant point for our purposes is that incestuous sexual contact is the ter- minus of a causal process involving at least several and probably many actions and reactions on the parts of two individuals, and that incest- avoidance will come about if this causal process is blocked at any point. 3Thus Finkelhor's findings (1979, 1984) are based on a far more inclusive conception of sibling incest than that employed by the human sociobiologists. For explanations and defense of the concepts used by clinicians see Finkelhor (1979, p. 54), MacFarlane et al. (1986, chapter 1), Herman (1981, p. 70). If the Westermarckian approach is to be under- stood in terms of the extinguishing of feelings of sexual attraction among children raised together, it cannot be protected against the mass of evidence of a variety of expressions of such feelings that emerges in recent clinical studies, simply through the stratagem of refusing to apply the label "incest".</page><page sequence="13">108 PHILIP KITCHER The Westermarck hypothesis proposes that among a subclass of cases- consisting of those dyads who are of the same generation and who are social family members (who have been reared together)-the causal chain will not begin. In moving from traditional human sociobiology to the human behavioral ecology that I envisage, I suggest that we understand why sibling incest occurs when it does by focusing on the proximate causal history of acts of sibling incest, identifying the psychological mechanisms involved, and trying to fathom the functional significance (if any) of the corresponding mechanisms that operate in people who do not engage in incest. Conceiving incestuous advances in terms of their expression of sexual desire is plainly congruent with this shift away from overt behavior and towards underlying mechanisms. Let's begin with a point that has been implicit in earlier remarks. Con- summate incest may either be consensual or coercive.4 As the prototype of the causal history of a coercive act of consummated incest we may take the following: first, X comes to feel sexual desire for Y; second, in consequence of the sexual desire, X makes a sexual advance toward Y; third, Y either does not respond or rebuffs X's sexual advance; fourth, X has the power to coerce Y and X has no inhibitions against using that power to force Y to engage in the sexual contact. By contrast, the pro- totype of the causal history of a consensual act of consummated incest will be: first, X comes to feel sexual desire for Y; second, in consequence of the sexual desire, X makes a sexual advance toward Y; third, either as a standing disposition or in consequence of X's advance, Y feels sexual desire for X; fourth, in consequence of Y's sexual desire, Y signals will- ingness to engage in sexual contact, which thereupon takes place. Now these prototypes are obviously much too simple and schematic. 4Plainly this is not a sharp dichotomy, but the categories mark two ends of a continuum. Extreme instances of consensual incest would be examples in which the partners were both equally attracted to one another and in which the sexual relations are as unproblematic retrospectively as sexual relations normally are. Extreme instances of coercive incest would be examples of forcible incestuous rape (possibly repeated on many occasions) with con- tinued resistance on the part of the victim. (As the studies of Herman and Hirschman (1977), Meiselman (1979), and Herman (1981) show, women who unsuccessfully resist the advances of more powerful male relatives are typically better able to overcome the effects of the incident-perhaps because they do not perceive themselves as in any way responsible for what occurred.) I should emphasize that, even in those cases where there is no overt resistance, the power asymmetries in many incestuous situations support the clinicians' classifications of them as examples of victimization. Finkelhor's survey makes plain the fact that less coercion is felt when the participants are closer in age, and the relationships that develop among peers seem significantly less problematic than those in- volving crossing of generations. It is remarkable that there are at least some approximations to the consensual extreme that have been recorded. See for example Case 11 in Meiselman (1979, pp. 62, 265, 279), Case 3 in Kubo (1959, pp. 117-118), and numerous instances in Masters (1963). (I am more skeptical of the data supplied by Masters, and cite it only because, in this instance, there is independent evidence of the same phenomenon.)</page><page sequence="14">THE FUTURE OF HUMAN BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY 109 (Related points and similar acknowledged simplifications, are also made by those clinical psychologists who have thought most seriously about incest and incest-avoidance: see, for example, chapter 5 of Finkelhor 1984.) The actual etiology of human sexual behavior is much more complex, and there may be elaborate signaling and sexual negotiation that takes place over a lengthy period (days, weeks, or months). Incest-avoidance isn't a unitary phenomenon, and it's highly unlikely that a propensity to incest-avoidance is a trait that has been shaped or maintained by natural selection. For consider the various ways in which our prototypical causal chains could be broken. X may want to consummate incest and may have no scruples about forcing Y, but X may be either powerless or afraid of reprisals from others, X may be sexually attracted to Y and have the power to coerce Y, but X may have a strong disposition against forcing another into sexual activity. X may be sexually attracted to Y and Y may be sex- ually attracted to X, but either (or both) may be unwilling to translate their desires into action because they are afraid. Notice that all of these varieties of unconsummated incest are at odds with the Westermarck hy- pothesis, which takes for granted a point that ought to be investigated in detail: to wit, the thesis that a low frequency of sibling incest reflects a low incidence of incestuous desires.5 But the main point that I want to emphasize is that sexual activity be- tween siblings-or the absence of such activity-cannot be understood apart from consideration of a range of dispositions that are implicated in other areas of sexual and nonsexual behavior. If we are searching for traits that have functional significance, then we ought to be looking at more general properties such as the dispositions to be sexually stimulated by the presence of certain kinds of individuals, the dispositions to trans- late sexual desire into action, more general dispositions for taking risks, and so forth. In an attempt to illustrate the position I am recommending, I shall conclude by offering a highly oversimplified model of one aspect of the oversimplified scenarios that have so far been considered. 7. A Preliminary Model. Suppose that the proximate mechanisms of sexual advances work in something like the following way. We can imag- ine that there is a standing evaluation function that rates the sexual at- 'As I have pointed out elsewhere (Kitcher 1985, pp. 367-368), ventures in human so- ciobiology err in supposing that if there is a probability p that individuals reared together will not acquire the (Westermarckian) disposition to avoid sexual relations with one an- other, then the frequency of sibling incest should be (approximately) p. If we suppose that sibling incest is consensual, then the frequency of sibling incest should be (approximately) p2. If we suppose that there is an uncorrelated trait of being able and willing to coerce sexual activity, and that this occurs with small probability q, then the frequency should be (approximately) p2(1 - q) + pq. In either event, using frequencies of consummate incest as indictors of frequencies of incestuous desire will underrepresent the frequency with which siblings are attracted to one another.</page><page sequence="15">110 PHILIP KITCHER tractiveness of individuals according to a number of variables, including indicators of sex and age (or possibly, relative age6), size, and, I'll sup- pose, familiarity. The reason for including this last variable is to enable us to co-opt some of the virtues of the Westermarek hypothesis. Assume that the evaluation function is relatively constant over time, at least for post-pubertal adolescents, but that there is a threshold function that as- signs values to combinations of the same variables and that fluctuates with time. Let us now adopt a very simple view of the making and receiving of sexual advances. Suppose a person X encounters a person Y, that the evaluation and threshold functions for X and Y are ex, ey, tx, and ty re- spectively, and that the vectors representing the values of the variables corresponding to X and Y are x and y. Then X makes a sexual advance to Y just in case ex(y) &gt; tX (Y) (i and Y reciprocates a sexual advance from X just in case ey (x) &gt; ty (x). (ii) (Here I assume, without loss of generality, that X is the person to make the first move.) I suppose that sexual contact takes place just in case the advance is made and reciprocated, that is, just in case both (i) and (ii) hold. Within this very simple framework we can articulate a number of hy- potheses about proximate mechanisms, development and function. Con- sider first, a way of refining a central idea of the Westermarck hypothesis. In his pioneering studies on mating preference among Japanese quail, Patrick Bateson has shown that birds exhibit a preference for mates that are familiar but not too familiar. Assuming (and it's a very large as- sumption) that something similar holds for our own species, we can sup- pose that the projection of the evaluation function along the axis repre- senting familiarity/novelty takes the form shown in Figure 4. Bateson hypothesizes that the evaluation function takes this form in a mature in- dividual as a result of the interaction of two processes. In ontogeny, there is an initial tendency to be attracted to the familiar but the process of habituation decreases the attractiveness of those with whom one has fre- 'The studies of Finkelhor (1979, 1984), Meiselman (1979), and Herman (1981) show very clearly that relative age is extremely important in affecting the attitudes of participants in incestuous relationships. Herman, in particular, gives a compelling presentation of the damage inflicted on daughters who are victimized by their fathers, and of the sense of powerlessness that those daughters have. By contrast, the respondents to Finkelhor's ques- tionnaire who were involved in incestuous relationships with peers seem to have been far less troubled by these relationships-which is not to maintain, as members of some "sexual liberation" groups hope to do, that some cases of incest are entirely free from victimization.</page><page sequence="16">THE FUTURE OF HUMAN BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY 111 DEGREE i OF I imprinting ATTRACTIVENESS curve hypothetical /\ ~~~~threshold FAMILIAR NOVEL Figure 4 quent contact. Using the notation so far introduced, we can suggest that there is a mapping h taking the evaluation function at the nth develop- mental stage onto the evaluation function at the n + 1st developmental stage, with the property that, for values of x at the familiar end of the familiarity/novelty axis h(e)(x) is always less than e(x) with the differ- ence being greater the closer x is to the familiarity/novelty origin. Notice that the realization of h might involve the kinds of psychodynamic vari- ables stressed by Freudians. For example, the transformation may be ef- fected as a result of advances toward people who are initially attractive, advances that are not met in ways that satisfy the child.7 Focus next on the threshold function. This will surely vary with time in obvious ways. For example, a prolonged period of sexual abstinence may lower the values of the threshold function across all arguments with the result that the class of potential sexual partners is greatly increased. One interesting issue is the question whether public incest taboos or pa- rental commands about relationships among family members affect the 7A number of writers have discussed the "frustration hypothesis" as an account of how initial attraction for the familiar is transformed into sexual indifference. See, for example, Fox (1980, p. 50), and Bateson (1983, p. 270). Commenting on the results that he has already achieved with quail, Bateson suggests that the hypothesis is not very likely, al- though it cannot be discounted. Although, the hypothesis might easily be developed into a neat synthesis of Freudian and Westermarckian ideas, I don't think that the evidence on human sexual development is particularly favorable to it. For, as Kinsey originally doc- umented and some recent writers on child sexuality have emphasized with enthusiasm (see Martinson 1982, pp. 24-25), there is little basis for the once popular claim that infantile sexual feelings inevitably-or even usually-are frustrated by adult responses to them. Moreover, studies of development of sexual preference indicate that the sex of childhood sexual partners has little impact on post-pubertal sexual preference (Bell, Weinberg, and Hammersmith 1981, pp. 99-113).</page><page sequence="17">112 PHILIP KITCHER form of the function. Those who believe that there are social pressures that play an important role in diminishing the frequency of incest can frame their hypothesis as the claim that certain kinds of teachings or warnings cause a relative increase in the values of t for those arguments x that correspond to family members. The relative increase would be as- sumed to be maintained as the absolute values of t fluctuate.8 There's a different way to think about the springs of sexual behavior and about the translation of sexual desire into action. Suppose as before, that there is a standing (adult) evaluation function, representing the Bate- sonian compromise between imprinting and habituation. Assume further that there is a fluctuating threshold, which responds to such factors as length of time since sexual activity and physiological state.9 If X en- counters a person Y for whom ex(y) &gt; tx(y) then X feels sexual desire for Y. Whether this desire is translated into action depends on X's assessment of the situation. Instead of seeing sexual desire as automatically issuing in a sexual advance, we conceive of the "sexual desire module" as in- teracting with a "consequence assessment module". Complex ontogenetic processes will issue in X's having a disposition to undertake (or to avoid) certain kinds of risks. Cultural transmission of lore about the appropriateness of various kinds of sexual relations will partially specify some of the perceived consequences. Features of the oc- current situation will also be relevant to the determination of those per- ceived consequences. Thus, whether X makes an incestuous advance may depend not only on X's sexual desire for a relative (itself the product of the standing evaluation function and the threshold function) but also on X's general willingness to take risks, on the social transmission of a taboo against incest, and on X's assessment of the likely response of the object 8Note that the simple machinery I have introduced allows us to make sense of the idea that incest-avoidance is a bio-cultural phenomenon. We assume that there are certain on- togenetic processes that may be relatively imperturbable by the cultural input but that these processes interact with others that are highly sensitive to patterns of behavior and teaching within the family and within the broader culture. As Bateson has repeatedly emphasized, simplistic dichotomies about biological and cultural factors need to be overcome, and his own work on the ontogeny of mate preference in Japanese quail should not be interpreted as underwriting the idea that human incest-avoidance can be completely understood in biological terms. 9One of the obvious points for further investigation is study of the effects of alcohol in the initiation of incest. Much of the literature on father-daughter incest relates incestuous advances to heavy drinking-see, for example, Finkelhor (1979, pp. 22, 207), Macfarlane et al. (1986, p. 206), Herman (1981, pp. 76, 112), Weinberg (1955, passim). In terms of the account I offer in the text, it is natural to propose either that alcohol intake causes a generalized lowering of the threshold for sexual desire or that it eases the translation of sexual desire into overt behavior (of course, it is possible that both effects are present). If one could provide a neural substructure for the type of psychological account that I offer, it would be interesting to try to link the clinical evidence to ongoing research on the effects of alcohol on the brain.</page><page sequence="18">THE FUTURE OF HUMAN BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY 113 of desire (and of the effects of that response on others). Foregoing ab- straction for the moment, an elder brother with sexual desire for a younger sister may be restrained because of his unwillingness to tolerate even a slight chance of detection, or because the sanctions against incest (or per- haps, against sexual coercion) in his social group are very severe, or because he believes that his sister will complain to others and that her testimony will be credible. We can think of the assessment module as interposing barriers between the sexual desire and action expressing that desire: incest may occur when the checks are negligible or when the de- sire is so strong (that is, the difference between ex(y) and tx(y) is so great) that it overwhelms them. 1 8. Glimpses Beyond. "This is all very well," the human sociobiologist may say, "but how can we formulate this approach so as to obtain testable hypotheses?" I have some sympathy for the question. My reply comes in two parts. First, if my arguments are correct, it's highly likely that the measure- ments and correlations that figure in traditional human sociobiology are meaningless. The ways in which ecological constraints impinge on human behavior simply cannot be appreciated without some conception of the ways in which forms of behavior are bound together by proximate mech- anisms and developmental processes. Second, and more important, the general model sketched in the last section can be filled out by proposing specific hypotheses about the forms of the functions and the processes that affect the transformation of the threshold. From these hypotheses one can generate expectations about human sexual behavior under various conditions. Furthermore, such hypotheses can also be tested by designing '0The distinction between sexual desire and action that expresses sexual desire, which I have drawn in a preliminary way in this section, seems to me to be crucial in understanding one important facet of examples of incest. Clinical studies make it relatively clear that some daughters feel sexual attraction toward their incestuous fathers. Herman and Hirsch- man write: "Half of the women acknowledged, however, that they had felt some degree of pleasure in the sexual contact, a feeling which had only increased their sense of guilt and confusion" (1977, p. 747). The point is elaborated with explicit citations of reports to therapists, including one woman's statement that she was "in love" with her father, and another's description of herself as "very attracted" to her father (1979, pp. 747-748). It should not be inferred from these reports that the women in question were not victimized in the relationship. For, in such cases, there is (typically, and probably almost always) either a reluctance to translate the sexual desire into action or an inability to foresee con- sequences of action, a lack that is exploited by the more knowledgeable father. Note that the presence of desires of this kind seems incompatible with a generalized version of the Westermarck hypothesis, although it can readily be understood in terms of the model I've sketched: we can think of the women concerned as acquiring the standard attractiveness curve but as having a threshold function that is locally depressed in the region correspond- ing to the father, partly as a result of their isolation from other potentially attractive males and partly as a result of the father's previous attentions.</page><page sequence="19">114 PHILIP KITCHER variations on standard types of psychological experiments, for example, observations of the differential reactions of subjects to various stimulus objects. I don't doubt that the process of testing will be difficult, and that there will be familiar kinds of controversies about the interpretation of experi- mental results. But I take it as a positive virtue of my approach that it suggests many questions that have been virtually ignored in the vast an- thropological and clinical literature on incest and incest-avoidance. What is the frequency with which, in post-pubertal individuals, the evaluation function takes values that are higher than those of the threshold function for arguments that correspond to family members? How often are inces- tuous advances made? How often would they be made if the person moved by desire were not afraid of the consequences? Does the process of ha- bituation play a more general role than that of modifying the attractive- ness evaluation? Even a preliminary model helps us achieve more precise characterizations of the phenomena that are worth investigating. We can proceed to study incest-avoidance in several different ways. First, and most obviously, one can attempt to make the model I have sketched more concrete by linking it to the available clinical literature on incest occurrences. The character of the underlying processes is partially revealed by seeing where they break down.11 Second, one can inquire how the treatment in terms of evaluation functions and thresholds relates to psychological variables adduced in other contexts or to details of neu- rophysiology. 12 Third, one can pursue functional questions in the context presented by the emerging story of proximate and developmental mech- anisms, inquiring not what is the function of incest-avoidance but what function is served by the process of imprinting or by some hypothetical transformation of the threshold function.13 None of these ways of pro- "1Much of the anthropological literature on incest-avoidance has, I think, failed to see the importance of identifying mechanisms by trying to understand where they don't work. Given the approach that I've proposed, the class of interesting cases is greatly expanded: we should no longer be looking just at instances in which incest is consummated, but at occasions on which peoplefeel incestuous desires. A natural extension of Finkelhor's ques- tionnaire would enable us to gather information about such occasions-although the meth- odological circumspection that Finkelhor himself expresses about his survey would be even more appropriate as we move from asking subjects to report overt behavior to inquiring, retrospectively, about their feelings. 12Another obvious extension of the model I've sketched is to attempt to offer a connec- tionist articulation of the claims about thresholds and evaluation functions, along lines similar to the studies in McLelland and Rumelhart (1986). "3Given the scruples advanced in my (1985) about the dangers of casual attributions of function, I am loth to offer qualitative claims about the possible advantages of certain types of psychological mechanisms. However, in case the central point of the paper is lost in the details of the example, let me indicate how the approach I recommend might modify our functionalist hypotheses. Instead of looking for the function of a disposition to refrain from copulating with those with whom one has been reared, our attention should now shift</page><page sequence="20">THE FUTURE OF HUMAN BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY 115 ceeding has priority over the others, and each should be responsive to the findings of the others. That is the moral of my story. Let me close by returning to the abstract perspective with which we began. Once human behavioral ecology has rid itself of the errors of ge- netic determinism, and once it has vowed to emulate the genuine achieve- ments of nonhuman behavioral ecology, the large obstacle that must be overcome is the identification of those aspects of the behavioral pheno- type that actually have functional significance. The task is difficult be- cause we need to refine our evolutionary modeling in light of theories of development and mechanism in psychology (or neurophysiology) that we simply do not have. I have suggested that we address that task by trying to integrate developmental and evolutionary studies, assembling what constraints we can as we go, and using each field of investigation to shed light on the other. There is no guarantee that this can be done success- fully, but I hope that the example of incest-avoidance does indicate that we can introduce considerable order into vague and apparently inimical hypotheses by thinking clearly about both the developmental and the functional aspects of the situation.14 If developmental psychology, neu- robiology, and evolutionary analyses are undertaken together, then the grain of truth in orthodox human sociobiology, the claim that we, like to the (possible) function of the ontogenetic processes that give rise to the initial attrac- tiveness curve, to its modification under habituation, and to the transformations of the threshold. The function of such processes may only be specifiable in terms of their effects across the entire range of sexual behavior, and it is possible that their consequences for survival and reproduction are mediated by nonsexual behavior as well. Thus an important issue for the synthesis of functional and developmental ideas is whether there is a single attractiveness evaluation that guides all social interactions, or whether there are separate evaluations for sexual and nonsexual relationships. The challenge will obviously be to bring to the psychological level the same kind of precision in modeling and detail of observation that has begun to emerge in the behavioral ecological study of mate-choice behavior in nonhuman animals. See, in particular, Bateson (1980, 1982, 1983), Partridge (1983), Cooke and Davies (1983). 14Of course, it is eminently possible that the study of incest-avoidance is the wrong case to begin with. I use it here as an illustration for several reasons. First, it is an instance in which traditional human sociobiology has often taken pride, so that the differences between the approach that I recommend and the sociobiological tradition can appear more starkly in the discussion of this parade case. Second, thanks to the work of Bateson and others, there is a growing collection of illuminating studies of nonhuman organisms and their choices of mates. Third, the clinical studies of Meiselman, Herman, Hirschman and others, together with Finkelhor's important studies, yield a body of psychological literature and data that can in principle be linked with biological investigations. For all this, it may turn out that the approach I have sketched is entirely off-target, and that human behavioral ecology ought to pursue some more tractable problem. (The moral of the history of ge- netics, in which those who began with fruit flies came far further than those who hoped to tackle the exciting problems of human heredity directly, is, I trust, obvious.) Let me emphasize that the treatment of incest sketched here is an illustration, and that, whatever its merits as an explanation of the particular phenomena, it is the general approach and the style of explanation that matters.</page><page sequence="21">116 PHILIP KITCHER other species, are products of the evolutionary process, might flower into something significant.
