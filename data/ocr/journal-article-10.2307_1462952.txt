<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Language and Imagery of the Bible. By G. B. Caird. Westminster Press, 1980. 280 pages. $20.00. Caird's lucid analysis of biblical language and semantics is enhanced by the application of principles drawn from modern linguistics. While his objective is to increase the perception of the "ordinary reader" of the Bible, he also succeeds in engaging and stimulating even more sophisticated audiences. The book is divided into three sections. The first delineates the salient features of language and illustrates each one with biblical examples: word usage (referential-formative and cognitive, commissive-performative and expressive, and cohesive), elements of semantics (referent, sense, and writer's intention), causes of semantic change, and common afflictions that obscure meaning. This section also includes a discussion of two distinctive Hebraic idioms: hyperbolic, absolute state- ments and parataxis (the placing together of two clauses, evencontradictory ones, without indicating their relationship). Section 2 ("Metaphor") is an informative description of nonliteral forms of bibli- cal language (hyperbole, irony, simile, metaphor, fable, parable, allegory, and anthropomorphism), capped off by suggestions on how to differentiate between lit- eral and nonliteral expressions. The high point is the analysis of parable and allegory which indicates the two are "partial synonyms." Caird convincingly demonstrates that the extreme bifurcation of the two results from confusing allegory (a story with an intended hidden meaning) and allegorization (the imposing of a hidden meaning not intended by the writer). The final section ("History, Myth and Eschatology") is the most provocative of the three. In assessing history writing, Caird explains that biblical writers affirm dual causation: divine and natural. Hence, one should not too quickly dismiss a biblical text as unhistorical, simply because the writer uses a divine causation instead of providing a natural explanation modern historiography prefers. The last two chapters propose that "myth and eschatology are used as metaphor systems for the theological interpretation of historical events." Thus, myth contains evocative images which are readily adaptable to contemporary people and events (e.g., the description of Nebuchadnezzar in terms of the chaos monster-Jer. 51:34). Similarly, Caird demonstrates that biblical writers often spoke of current situations in eschatological terms, while well aware that they were not end-time events (e.g., the "Day of the Lord" in prophetic texts).
