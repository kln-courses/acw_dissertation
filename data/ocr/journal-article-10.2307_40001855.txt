<plain_text><page sequence="1">Unity and Subordination in uCarrion Comfort" PHILIP PAGE THE last pages of Gerard Manley Hopkins' essay, "On the Origin of Beauty: A Platonic Dialogue," the Professor analyzes a poem by Richard Garnett called "The Nix." The analysis is intended to illustrate the Professor's and Hopkins' theories of beauty and art, and in so doing provides insight into Hopkins' own poetry. "The Nix" is beautiful, says the Professor, because it is organized by one central antithesis followed by subordinate antitheses. Earlier in the dialogue, the Professor argues that "beauty then is a relation. . . . And things which have relation are near enough to have something in common, but not near enough to be one and the same."1 This relation between two things which are similar and yet different is called a parallelism. The Professor cites "The Nix" as an example of artistic beauty because of its structure of parallelisms: "It is not made up merely" said the Professor "of detached consecutive parallelisms. Let us consider. The two terms of a parallelism make a whole of beauty, but these wholes again may be the terms of a higher whole; as so many lines make up each speech in a scene, so many speeches each scene, so many scenes each act, so many acts the play, and, on the Greek stage, four plays a tetralogy: I mean only that works of art are composite, having unity and subordination." (/, p. 114) The structure that the Professor and Hopkins admire is that of a single entity developed by division and subdivision, with the resulting emphasis on unity, subordination, parallelism, similarities, and yet differences. This structure, which I call differentiation, is fundamental to Hopkins' thought and his poetry and is the organizing principle of his sonnet, "Carrion Comfort." In his prose Hopkins repeatedly approaches a concept by differentiating it. For example, he discusses three types of grace: "quickening," "correc- tive," and "elevating."2 He writes not of the will but of two kinds of will, the arbitrium and the voluntas, each of which is subdivided (S, p. 142). Poetical language he classifies into "lowest," "Parnassian," and "highest" and subdivides Parnassian into "Castalian" and "real Parnassian" (/, p. 38). The same structure is evident in the word lists in Hopkins' early diaries. He is lThe Journals and Papers of Gerard Manley Hopkins, ed. Humphry House and Graham Storey (Oxford Univ. Press, 1959), p. 95;hereafter cited as/. 277ze Sermons and Devotional Writings of Gerard Manley Hopkins, ed. Christopher Devlin (Oxford Univ. Press, 1955), p. 158; hereafter cited as S. 25</page><page sequence="2">26 / VICTORIAN POETRY fascinated by a word such as "horn" partly because he can divide and subdivide its multiple meanings and multiple roots until he has a whole system of related words (/, p. 4). This pattern of unity and subordination is evident in Hopkins' most fundamental ideas. For Hopkins the primal example of differentiation is the Divine itself in the eternal and intrinsic procession of the Trinity: "The first intention then of God outside himself . . . was Christ; and we must believe that the next was the Blessed Virgin" (Â£, p. 197). This division is followed by an extrinsic and less than eternal (let us say aeonian) one: "God's utterance of himself in himself is God the Word, outside himself is this world. This world then is word, expression, news of God" (S, p. 129). Similarly, an individual does not exist as a single self but is constantly "serving," becoming a different self that is like but not exactly like his former selves. Another version of this concept of the self is Hopkins' notion of "sakes": "I mean by [a sake] the being a thing has outside itself, as a voice by its echo, a face by its reflection, a body by its shadow, a man by his name, fame, or memory."3 In his theories of God and the self, Hopkins posits an original entity, but he can only understand that ejitity by considering its repetitions, its divisions and subdivisions, its outstresses. One more example of this structure in Hopkins' thought is his concept of inscape. When Hopkins tries to discover the inscape of an object, a scene, or a word, he applies the differentiation method in reverse. He observes the data, the repeated manifestations, the divisions and the subdivisions, and then he intuits the entity or principle which binds them together. Many of Hopkins' poems are structured on these same principles of unity, subordination, repetition, and difference. A favorite device is to begin a poem with a general statement which the rest of the poem particularizes and classifies. "Spring," for example, begins with a general statement ("Nothing is so beautiful as spring") and elaborates that statement with examples. The same pattern operates in each of the "terrible" sonnets of 1888. "God's Grandeur" and "Pied Beauty" begin with simple statements of their subjects, differentiate that subject, and then return to a restatement of the original entity at the end. "As kingfishers catch fire" classifies and comments on its stated subject: "Each mortal thing does one thing and the same." "The Windhover" depends upon the concept that windhover, plow and "sillion," and bursting coals are all differentiations of a comprehensive unity, the unity of Christ. The pattern of differentiation works in another way in Hopkins' poetry: his mature poetry begins with "The Wreck of the Deutschland" and in a sense that poem is the ur-poem or original unity which ^The Letters of Gerard Manley Hopkins to Robert Bridges, ed. Claude Colleer Abbott (Oxford Univ. Press, 1955), p. 83.</page><page sequence="3">PHILIP PAGE 121 implies the themes of all the other poems and of which the other poems are divisions and repetitions. For example, stanzas two to four of "The Wreck" anticipate the "terrible" sonnets, stanza five is a preliminary version of the nature poems of 1876, and the concern throughout the poem with the position of the speaker and then the nun in relation to Christ is the source for later poems which try to find man's place in the universe.4 The pattern of differentiation can best be examined by a detailed study of a single poem, "Carrion Comfort." The poem is a complex statement about the speaker's various states of being, ranging from the opening denial of a self who might feast on despair and annihilate himself to the implied self in the last line of the poem, a self who has suddenly realized his exaltation into the presence and grace of God. Between these two versions of the self, which are at the opposite extremes of religious ecstasy, the poem differentiates the self into a number of other versions or "scapes." The first quatrain begins by distinguishing the self who might feast on despair from the speaking self who is one twist away from that ultimate position, a self whose only possible assertion is his denial of despair and self-annihilation. The second sentence of the quatrain makes the infinitesimal but significant shift to a self who is able to do something positive, although that something is minuscule and is as yet unknown to the speaker. The second quatrain continues this proliferation of selves by recalling a self who has been wracked by the actions of God's grace upon him. This self, like the selves of the first quatrain, is almost non-existent, reduced to a mere heap whose only desire is to deny and to flee. Behind both these quatrains is the idea of a self at the brink of non-existence; the eight lines differentiate that unity into similar but different parts. The discriminations among selves become more complicated in the sestet. The process starts with what seems to be an answer to the questions of the second quatrain: "Why? That my chaff might fly; my grain lie, sheer and clear." This answer hypothesizes a purified self, a self which is opposite to those of the octave and which anticipates the discovery of the speaker's proximity to God in the last line of the poem. However, between lines nine and fourteen, the speaker doubts his salvation and in so doing loses the certainty which he seemed to have in line nine. First he recalls his past, when he first accepted God and seemed to thrive under God's care (11. 10-11). However, the subdivisions of his activities in that state ("lapped strength, stole joy, would laugh, cheer") lead him to a bewildering confusion of selves. In lines twelve and thirteen he recalls one of the times when he felt the action of God, but he cannot be sure whether he watched or participated. Worse, he does not know whether he cheered for God or himself, which implies that 4I am indebted to J. Hillis Miller for this idea and in general for my approach to Hopkins' poetry.</page><page sequence="4">28 / VICTORIAN POETRY God and self were intermingled. But this is exactly the state he has been desiring, a state which justifies the violence he has suffered. The poem thus ends with an affirmation that the speaker's self, at least one of his innumerable selves, did indeed receive God's grace.5 Just as the speaker is divided into many selves, the poem enumerates a plentitude of images of God. The second quatrain provides four examples of the central idea of a terrifying God whose gift of grace is a violent remaking of the recipient. God is the gigantic foot that wrings the world and so rudely rocks the speaker, the lion's paw that presses against him, the terrifying gaze that withers him, and the storm that reduces him to a formless heap. Underlying all these metaphors for God and God's grace is the central idea of the one God. But Hopkins is unable to speak of God in absolute or direct terms and therefore must differentiate and use more than one metaphor. The sestet presents even more discriminations of God and the action of grace. In line nine God is the thresher; in line ten he is the rod of justice, but almost before the speaker can say "rod" he wonders if "Hand" isn't also necessary. Then God is once again the violent force which beats against the speaker just as he handles heaven and wrings the world. This reappearance of God as hurler modulates into the image of God the wrestler, which then merges with the speaker himself. Time in "Carrion Comfort" is also subjected to differentiation. The poem is fundamentally concerned with the speaker's spiritual condition beyond all times and all tenses. But just as Hopkins cannot directly discuss the self or God, so he cannot directly confront timelessness. Instead, he incorporates many times and many tenses that by their multiplicity imply the transcendence of time. The poem begins in the present tense with the speaker wondering how he can exist in the future. In the second quatrain he remembers what seems to have taken place in the past- God's violent treatment of him- but the tenses of the verbs are not limited to the past. The verbs for God's actions are all governed by "wouldst," which allows those actions to be applied, conditionally at least, to the present and the future as well as the past. Similarly, when the speaker pictures himself "heaped there" and "frantic to avoid thee and flee," the verbs do not specify any one time. Thus the distinctions between past, present, and future are blurred. The sestet begins with another anticipation of the future, again modified by the use of a conditional verb, "might." This is immediately followed by a 5 In addition to Miller's chapter on Hopkins in The Disappearance of God (New York, 1963), my reading of "Carrion Comfort" has been most influenced by W. H. Gardner's Gerard Manley Hopkins: A Study of Poetic Idiosyncracy in Relation to Poetic Tradition, 2 vols., rev. ed. (Oxford Univ. Press, 1958), Geoffrey Hartman's The Unmediated Vision (New York, 1966), Alan Heuser's The Shaping Vision of Gerard Manley Hopkins (Oxford Univ. Press, 1958), and Paul Mariani's A Commentary on the Complete Poems of Gerard Manley Hopkins (Cornell Univ. Press, 1970).</page><page sequence="5">PHILIP PAGE I 29 definite reference to some time in the past- "since (seems) I kissed the rod." But then the activities which the speaker has engaged in since that time consist of two in the past tense ("lapped strength" and "stole joy"), one in an ambiguous conditional tense ("would laugh"), and one with no specified tense at all ("cheer"). For this speaker there seems to be no clear way to discuss any event: as soon as an event is mentioned it must be placed in time, but all times become blurred, divided, and subdivided, until they collapse into one time or no time. This holds as well for the final tercet, in which another scene of God's violence is recalled. This scene may or may not be the same as the one in the second quatrain and may or may not be the same as the night described in stanza two of "The Wreck of the Deutschland."6 Furthermore, those "nights" or "that night" are not simply nights but become "that year." In another of the "terrible" sonnets, hours, years, and life are conflated: "But where I say / Hours I mean years, mean life." Particular nights and particular events are subordinated to a timeless unity in which the speaker's soul seeks oneness with God. Differentiation structures not only the thematic concerns of the poem- the self, God, grace, and time- but also its diction and syntax. The speaker begins with one overwhelming thought: he will not give up. This original "not" is repeated, expanded, and differentiated into "I'll not," then "I'll not feast," then "I'll not untwist," and finally "I'll not cry." Simultaneously, what the speaker will not feast on is divided into "carrion" and "Despair." Then, even as the divisions and repetitions of "not" are concluded, the whole series is split into another version, a positive restatement governed by "I can," which repeats and modifies the last version of the "not" construction ("not . . . cry / can no more") and itself is instantly subdivided into the four possibilities of line four. The fourth of these, I can "not choose not to be," reiterates and redivides the opening "not" construction. All through this quatrain the central idea is simple and single- the speaker will not give in to despair. Yet the syntax cuts and recuts that entity into part after part, in a profusion of clauses and phrases which, the language implies, could be continued indefinitely. The same syntactical effects are repeated throughout the poem. In the second quatrain God's actions against the speaker are expressed as a series of parallel constructions. The opening interjection and shift of direction, "But 6 I did say yes O at lightning and lashed rod ; Thou heardst me truer than tongue confess Thy terror, O Christ, O God; Thou knowest the walls, altar and hour and night: The swoon of a heart that the sweep and the hurl of thee trod Hard down with a horror of height: And the midriff astrain with leaning of, laced with fire of stress.</page><page sequence="6">30 / VICTORIAN POETRY ah," must be doubled and modified by "but O," and both are echoed by the "0" in line eight. The speaker is not merely "me heaped there" but "me frantic to avoid thee and flee," the expression of the speaker's state at that time requiring both "heaped" and "frantic." The second term of the division must then be further subordinated into "avoid thee" and "flee," in which the rhyme of "thee" and "flee" underscores the pattern of doubling. Two words in this quatrain- "rude" and "wring"- are examples of Hopkins' technique of exploiting the multiple meanings of words. Just as a man has many possible selves, just as God has many manifestations, just as any entity can be differentiated, so a word can and does have numerous meanings. "Rude" not only describes the roughness with which God rocked his foot on the speaker but also suggests the robustness and suddenness of God's power and the primitive, natural, and elemental qualities of his action. Hopkins' substitution of the adjectival form for the adverbial allows the word to hover relatively free of the syntax and to modify "thou" as well as "rock." Moreover, "rude" is a homophone for "rood," and thus the rude action of God linguistically rhymes with the cross or rood. The poem contains also the word "rod," whose sound differs only slightly from "rude" and "rood," and which is immediately modified by "hand." To this series of "rude," "rood," "rod," and "hand" must be added the images of God as heaven-handler and as the hero who "flung me." Furthermore, God acts not only with his hands but with his feet- it is his "right foot" which rocked the speaker and it is his "foot" which "trod" him. All of these disparate images of God's hand and feet are unified and organized by the central metaphor of God's anthropomorphism . At first, "wring" in "Thy wring-world right foot rock" seems only to mean that God's power controls the world. But this meaning is immediately accompanied by other meanings, similar to but different from the first. "Wring" suggests both twisting and turning, which associates it with the rope image in line two ("not untwist . . . these last strands of man") and with the storm image in line eight ("in turns of tempest"). Thus, "wring" is part of the differentiation of twisting images and part of the network of images for grace which interlace the poem. "Wring" is also a homophone for "ring," suggesting that God's foot or God himself rings the world both because he encircles and encompasses it and because he as its creator makes it ring with sound. In addition to these possibilities, "wring" is linked with "world." The world has been wrung both in that it is twisted and coiled ("that coil") by man's and Satan's disobedience, and in that it is dried out and therefore left without the healing properties of God's grace. "Wring," then, is discriminated into its parts, each of which not only describes the "world" but also contributes to the divisions and subdivisions of the speaker, a process which is necessary for the speaker's discoveries of himself and God.</page><page sequence="7">PHILIP PAGE I 31 The ninth line of "Carrion Comfort" is a striking instance of differentia- tion. By anticipating the spiritual joy of the speaker's union with God in the last line, the ninth line seems to revive the speaker's spiritual exhaustion of the first quatrain and to answer the agonized questions of the second quatrain. Like the whole poem, the line itself is unified, and yet it is split into two parts which double the division of the poem: the "Why?" of the first eight lines and the "answer" of the last six. But the answer, the image of threshing, is further divided. It is not enough to say that God's actions were designed to purify the speaker; the idea of purification must be repeated in "my chaff might fly" and "my grain lie." As with "thee" and "flee" in line eight, Hopkins uses the rhymes of "Why," "fly," and "lie" to reinforce his structure. But Hopkins is not yet finished, for grain will not merely lie, it will lie "sheer and clear." Again, in a rhyming pair of words, the single entity, itself a part of another single entity, is further divided. In "The Origin of Beauty" Hopkins' professor was aware that the sounds of words could help build a parallelism: he notes that the parallelism of "more false than fair" in the first line of "The Nix" is "heightened of course by the alliteration, always an aid in that way" (/, p. 1 12). Lines eleven and twelve of "Carrion Comfort," perhaps the most difficult in the poem, offer more examples of syntactical and verbal differentiation. Again, a doubled, rhyming pair of words- "that toil, that coil"- is used to describe a single idea. The list of verbs in line eleven repeats the pattern of the "not" and "can" constructions in the first quatrain and the actions of God in the second quatrain. The meaning of the two lines is ambiguous, and this ambiguity is yet another example of differentiation. The speaker seems to say that since he accepted God he has been spiritually fortunate. But no such simple paraphrase is adequate: "(seems)," which may modify "kissed" or "since" or both, injects doubt into the speaker's acceptance of God and into the time that has elapsed since he may have accepted God, and "Nay" in line ten seems to indicate that what follows contradicts the assertion of line nine. It is not clear what "toil" and "coil" refer to. Are they references to the world that the speaker has lived in since turning to God, or do they refer to the speaker's own heart and therefore to his own sins? Or is it both? Finally, the verb series of line eleven is ambiguous. "Lapped strength" may or may not suggest that the speaker, by means of the Incarnation, has enjoyed God's presence. Then the speaker's account of the past is modified to "stole joy," in which "stole" intimates the speaker's guilt regarding his happiness. The shift to the conditional "would" is ambiguous- did he laugh? did he only want to laugh? will he someday laugh? The sentence moves from a positive statement to an inability to assert anything. Within this progression from certainty to doubt the ambiguities of the grammar have split off a number of possible meanings. Again, a single entity is divided and subdivided into parts within parts.</page><page sequence="8">32 / VICTORIAN POETRY The last tercet contains further divisions within the diction and syntax. God is not only the heaven-handler, but he also "flung me," and he is, as in the second quatrain, not only a "Hand" but a "foot." In line fourteen a verbal echo sets up a parallelism between "wretch" and "wrestling." Most significantly, however, the fruition of the whole poem and of the pattern of differentiation occurs in the last four words of the poem. There is of course only one God, but Hopkins needs to repeat "my God" because "I wretch lay wrestling with . . . my God" is an inadequate description. He needs to imply two different intonations and attitudes, so he divides "(my God!)" from the ordinary syntax. When he does so he expresses and induces the ecstatic surprise which governs the entire poem.</page></plain_text>
