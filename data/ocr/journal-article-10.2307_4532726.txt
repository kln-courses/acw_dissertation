The apparent diversity of the pro- cesses involved has hitherto made it difficult for workers in other fields to appreciate the general problem, and THORPE'S classification of the observed phenomena under five headings-habituation, conditioning, trial-and-error learning, insight learning and imprinting-has for .the first time clearly defined the range which must be covered in discussions of learning in animals. This is particularly useful at the present moment, since physio- logical work on the higher centres of the nervous system and studies of</page><page sequence="2">THE PARALLEL BETWEEN LEARNING AND EVOLUTION I75 the fundamental nature of biochemical processes in living organisms have also made great strides in recent years, and the time now seems ripe for a synthesis of these different viewpoints in an attempt to elucidate the nature of the learning process. This article presents such an attempt, based on what may be called "kinematic principles" (LOTKA, I925). The approach is a novel one and borrows more from the methodology of theoretical physics than from the established techniques of experimental biology. It is hoped, however, that such a theoretical treatment of the problem may be of assis- tance in the interpretation of experimental results and in the planning of new observations. THE CONCEPT OF COMPLEXITY I'he important generalizations of physical and chemical kinematics have arisen from a study of systems under equilibrium conditions. Such laws as the Principle of Conservation of Energy (First Law of Thermodynamics) and the Principle of the Increase of Entropy (Second Law of Thermo- dynamics) apply only to systems which are isolated in the sense that energy does not cross the boundary of the system, and which in this isolated con- dition are left to attain a stable state under the prescribed conditions. The Second Law, in particular, cannot be applied to systems which are capable of exchanging energy with the rest of the universe, and since living orga- nisms are essentially of this nature and continue to show the properties as- sociated with life only while these energy exchanges are allowed to continue, the usefulness of the Second Law in a consideration of biological processes has even been questioned (PARTINGTON, 1949). SCHR6DINGER (1948), in a discussion of this point, suggests that it is helpful to regard living creatures as machines which feed on negative entropy; that is to say, they are con- tinually absorbing from the environment food containing molecules with a high degree of order and excreting other molecules of a lower degree of order. There is clearly nothing exclusive about this process of entropy decrease which could be used as a definition of the living state, for it is shared by growing crystals, by the process of polymerization and by manly- other non-living systems, but it remains a useful statement of one aspect of the machinery of the living organism by which its structure is preserved against the randomizing forces of the natural world. The characteristic of living systems which distinguishes them most clearly from the non-living is their property of progressing by the process which is called evolution from less to more complex states of organization. The concept of complexity is not which has one yet been subjected to accurate</page><page sequence="3">I76 J. W. S. PRINGLE treatment in biology, although it has been widely used, without definition, by biologists and philosophers. The key to its meaning comes from recent studies of the nature of "information" which have developed from problems of communication engineering (SHANNON and WEAVER, I950). MACKAv (i950), in a paper which presents the new ideas in a general form which is applicable to all branches of science, points out that all scientific state- ment conveying information are ultimately analysable into two components; an "a priori" or structural aspect associated with the number of independant parameters to which the statement refers, and an "a posteriori" or metrical aspect, there being associated with each structural element a numerical quantity measuring the amount of credibility to be associated with that aspect of the statement. The amount of this "structural" information repre- sents what is usually meant by the complexity of a statement about a system; it might alternatively be defined as the number of parameters needed to define it fully in space and time. In communication theory the term "logon" has been suggested for the unit of structural information, by contrast to the "metron", the unit of metrical information, which defines the credibility of each logon of the statement. It must be emphasized that this representation of complexity is essentially epistemological; the measure of complexity is of the statement about the system and is not the complexity of the system itself, an expression which has no scientifically discoverable meaning. The information which can be obtained about a system, be it a living organism or an inanimate system, is limited only by the effort expended in obtaining that information. But this need not detract from the value of the concept. The characteristic of living systems which is called evolution is the change from less to more complex states of o r g a n i z a t i o n. It is the ordered relationships between parts of the system, that is, the maintenance of constancy of certain features of the dynamic equilibrium, which enable us to define the information obtainable about it, since we commonly ignore, in scientific observations, those features which are not repeatedly verifiable to a certain accuracy. This justifies the use which will be made of the concept of complexity in this article: it refers only to those features of a system which are ordered and so are capable of verification. Thus defined, complexity and order are two independant features of an observed system. Order, which is negative entropy, may increase without increase in complexity: and complexity might increase without change of entropy. An example will clarify this point. When a crystal of common salt grows regularly to twice its previous size, its entropy decreases; that is, it has increased its order. But its complexity is the same; verifiable obser-</page><page sequence="4">THE PARALLEL BETWEEN LEARNING AND EVOLUTION I77 vations on it may be described by a statement involving the same number of parameters as before. If, on the other hand, there is present in the solution an atom of a sodium isotope and this atom becomes incorporated into the crystal, the complexity of theoretically verifiable observations on the system at once increases, since the position of the isotope atom in relation to the rest of the crystal demands more parameters for its full description. If, now, the crystal is repeatedly re-dissolved and a new crystal formed, the isotope atom is unlikely to occupy the same position on each occasion; treating the successive appearances of the crystal as a single system, the additional in- formation about the position of the isotope atom is not verifiable. This system cannot therefore be said to have evolved, since no new ordered relationships are established. Nothing can be stated about the incorporation of the isotope atom at a particular point in the crystal except that it is improbable, and no progressive change can be observed in the system. COMPLEXITY IN BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS By contrast with non-living systems whose complexity remains constant or decreases, biological systems may show a progressive increase in comr- plexity such, for example, as occurs in evolution. It is here suggested that this progressive increase in complexity in living systems takes place throughi the agency of a particular type of process which occurs in living organisms and which confers on them the most characteristic property of life. The parallel between learning and evolution arises as a corollary to this principle since it can be shown that both in evolution and in learning there is an increase in the complexity of the organism; a similar type of process may therefore be at work in the two cases. The value of the parallel is that, since we know something about the process of evolution, we can thereby limit the range of our search for the processes involved in learning. The type of process through which an increase in complexity occurs in living organisms is known in one form as the natural selection of randoml variations, widely accepted as the chief mechanism of evolution. To bring it into its correct relationship to the second law of thermodynamics, this process should more accurately be described as the selection of improbable variations, the term "improbable" being used in its statistical sense. The equilibration of a heterogeneous mixture of gases might be said to involve a selection of random variations, but in this case it is the probable variations that are "selected" in the sense that they occur more often than the im- probable, and system rapidly reaches a statistical equilibrium. The selection which occurs in evolution is different to this. A means is present of preserv-</page><page sequence="5">I78 J. W. S. PRINGLE ing in the system the effect of certain transformations which are improbable and of ignoring the effect of other transformations, including the reverse transformation to that which is preserved. Such a preservation of improbable states cannot occur in a "closed" system in which a stable end-state equilibrium is reached 1). But there is another type of equilibrium possible in the quantity of some unit in a system, namely, the steady-state, in which the rate of formation is equal to the rate of destruction of the unit under consideration. This type of equilibrium demands a source capable of supplying energy to the system and a sink capable of accepting energy from it, and it cannot therefore occur in "closed" systems. It can nevertheless be analysed. If energy is supplied from otitside, the amount of some ordered component in the system can increase (e.g. in crystallization) and if there is also a continual removal of this component (e.g. in the case of the crystals by sedimentation) the amount present may remain constant. If a particular region is considered as the "system" for the purpose of study and all the rest as the "environment", the quantity of the unit in the system remains constant when formation and removal occur at equdl rates, and a steady-state equilibrium is established. The peculiar properties of certain 'open" systems of this type in relation to the second law of thermodynamics arise from the fact that the two rate processes which are balanced at the steady-state equilibrium may be related in different ways to the quantity of the unit present; i.e. the system may be non- linear. The rate of increase of the unit is often nearly exponentbal; t-he rate of formation is proportional to the quantity already formed. The rate of destruction or removal, on the other hand, may depend on some otlher func- tion (e.g. a higher power) of the quantity present. One example of C? ron- linear steady-state equilibrium which has found application to population studies (GAUSE, I934) is the VERHULST-PEARL logistic equation dx dx - ax-bX2 dt but there are many other more complicated equations defining systems with similar properties. In all of these, if either or both the rate of formation andlor the rate of destruction are subject to variation, and if there is competition between the units composing the system for the energy supplies or for the conditions determining the rate of destruction, the steady-state equilibrium is altered, since it does not depend symmetrically on the varia- i) BERTALANFFY (1950) has discussed the genieral properties of "open" and "closed" systems in relation to biology.,</page><page sequence="6">THE PARALLEL BETWEEN LEARNING AND EVOLUTION 179 tion each side of the mean in the rates of formation and destruction. Such a system, in fact, selects the more rapid rates of formation even if the more and less rapid rates occur in each process with equal probability. The probability of occurrence of the more rapidly forming or less rapidly disap- pearing units can, indeed, be very low, and they will nevertheless persist in the steady-state equilibrium. The "open" system we are considering, then, has the following properties: I It is a steady-state equilibrium, each unit appearing to be constant only because it is being formed and destroyed at the same rate. 2 Either or both processes are subject to variation. 3 The rate of formation and the rate of destruction of each unit depend on different functions of the quantity present, and on the environmental conditions. These features imply a property of the units which may be called "replication"; that is, the presence of a unit in the system causes more similar -units to appear, with an accompanying increase in order which is balanced at steady-state equilibrium by the decrease in order involved in their destruction. In some of the special cases which we shall consider, this process of replication presents one of the least well understood features, but in its simplest form (e.g. in crystallization) it is fully describable. It is a manifesta- tion of an increased probability of various sub-units combining in certain -way when that combination is already present in the system and the conditions in general are such that combination tends to occur. Once a combination of sub-units has occurred in a particular way, all other types of combination are less probable, under those environmental conditions. Other combinations of sub-units may, however, occur, unless replication is perfect, and some of these other units may themselves possess the property of replication, so that, once formed, they also increase. If the process of growth continues un- checked, all units which have appeared and which possess the property of replication will be represented; but in a steady-state equilibrium in which there is also a process of destruction occurring, only those will persist which -have a more rapid rate of formation or a lower rate of destruction under the existing environmental conditions. These two rate factors are so much more important than the initial probability of formation of the new units in determining the composition of the steady-state population, that a very improbable unit'can survive or replace previously existing units when all are competing for the available energy supplies (see VOLTERRA I93I, for a mathematical proof of this statement).</page><page sequence="7">i8o J. w. s. PRINGLE The state of such a system cannot be fully described unless the range of variation is confined within known limits. If the limits of variation are in- finite there is always a finite possibility of a new unit arising whose rate of formation is higher or whose rate of destruction is lower than the original, so that it causes a change in the steady-state equilibrium. The system there- fore contains within itself the possibility of change due to irregularities in the replication process. Complexity in such a system can increase in two ways. If the system consists of several parts with no exchange of units between the parrs, an improbable event may persist in one part and not in another simply because it has not occured in all of them. The environment of all the parts can in this case be the same. Alternatively, if there are slight differences in the environments of the different parts of the system, a new unit which has arisen in all of them may survive only in some, producing thereby a sort of formal representation of the environmental conditions of each part of the system. If the occurrence of new units is sufficiently rapid, a change in the local environment of one part may, in this case, appear to be the cause of the change. If the appearance of new units is a rare event, the new complexity may not appear at all even when the environment becomes heterogeneous, although conditions are favourable for the increase in complexity to occur. The possibilities of "open" systems in general are difficult to visualize without mathematical treatment, and the mathematics, which is based on the theory of stochastic processes, may become extremely involved (KENDALL, 1950). It is clear, however, that progressive changes can occur in such systems which are fundamentally different in nature to those occurring in "closed" systems in true equilibrium. It is proposed in this paper to use the term "evolutionary" to describe the general type of process which leads to an increase in complexity in such systems. Some further characteristics of the process will become clear from examples. EVOLUTION BY VARIATION AND SEIIECTION Organic evolution by natural selection is clearly the first example which must be considered. Living organisms possess the property of replication as a whole (in this case more usually referred to as reproduction). They also show variation; that is, the reproductive process is imperfect, and organisms arise from time to time which do not exactly resemble their progenitors. The- new types of organisms which arise in this way are known as mutations; their- occurrence is improbable in the statistical sense, and yet they may be pre- served in a population by the process of natural selection. The mathematics</page><page sequence="8">THE PARALLEL BETWEEN LEARNING AND EVOLUTION i8i of the fate of a mutation in a population has been worked out by FISHER (I930, Chapter IV), and the process is widely accepted as the chief, or at least one of the chief ways in which living organisms progress by evolution from less to more complex states of organization. The new organisms which are preserved are those which, under the particular conditions, show either a higher rate of replication (reproduction) or a lower rate of destruction (greater individual life-time). FISHER has shown that the chance of survival of a new gene is dependent both on the selection factor and on the rate of occurrence of the mutation, but the mathematics shows clearly that in a large population a very low rate of mutation may, with quite a small selection factor, be adequate to ensure survival. In higher animals and plants the process of sexual reproduction introduces a complicating factor into the calculations, since a reshuffling of the units of heredity (genes) provides additional variation without the occurrence of mutation. The complication of sexual reproduction is not, however, a necessary feature of an "evolutionary" process as defined above. Provided that the property of replication exists, any system composed of interacting (competing) units whose quantity is determined by the steady-state equi- librium between an approximately exponential process of formation and a process of destruction will "evolve", if the replication is imperfect and occasionally produces units which have either a higher rate of replication or a greater individual life-time. Only systems with this general structure are capable of evolving to greater complexity. SYSTEMS WITH THE PROPERTY OF EVOLUTION Within the broad field of biological studies systems with the structure which has been outlined above have been recognized up to the present time only in the field of organic evolution and in the process of differentiation within the body of the individual organism (SPIEGELMAN, 1948). This second example is of considerable theoretical interest, for it is sometimes assumed that the whole of the complexity of the adult form is contained in the material substance of its inheritance (SCHR6DINGER, I948). Quite apart from the direct experimental evidence for the self-duplicating property of "plasma- genes" controlling enzyme formation in the living body, the adaption of the irdividual in the course of its ontogeny strongly suggests that an "evolution- ary" process is at work in the processes of growth and differentiation. SPIEGELMAN has discussed at length the treatment of differentiation as the problem of the evolution of a population of plasmagenes competing for the available material and energy supplies, and a repetition of his arguments</page><page sequence="9">i82 J. W. S. PRINGLE would be out of place in this article, the object of which is to suggest a third example of the same process. We must now turn to examine the types of learning shown by animals and enquire if there are any features which demand the existence here also of an "evolutionary" process. DOES LEARNING INVOLVE AN INCREASE IN COMPLEXITY? Learning is the name given to the general class of processes by which the behaviour of an animal comes to depend not only on the environmental changes immediately preceding it in time, but also on events which have occurred in the related parts of the environment in the more remote past. Students of animal behaviour distinguish this past into two parts; that period of past time during which the animal has existed as an independent organism, and the rest of past time during which its ancestors have existed. The modification of present behaviour by past events is called 1 e a r n i n g when those events have occurred during the lifetime of the individual, and i n s t i n c t when the events have occurred outside this period of time. In the former case the past events are supposed to have left some trace in the animal (usually in its nervous system), whereas in the latter case the organ- isation of the animal responsible for the observed response is supposed to be innate; that is, to be contained fully in the material substance )f its inheritance. This distinction is theoretically clear-cut, although great diffi- culty has often been experienced in assigning to one or other case the particular aspect of behaviour which is the subject for study. We owve to LORENZ, TINBERGEN and others most of what is now accepted about the nature of instinctive behaviour, and enough is known to enable us to recognize it in many different animals. The processes classed under the term learning, however, are of such a varied nature that it is not at once easy to identify the process, and it will be as well to summarize THORPE's (I950) classification in order to provide a background for the subsequent discussion. As THORPE (I950) points out, one of the most elementary fornis of learning shown by animals is that called by HUMPHREY "habituation". The animal at first reacts to a given stimulus in a particular way, and if the stimulus is repeated a sufficient number of times without the response leading -to any further responses, it becomes in time inadequate to provoke that response. Thereafter on presentation of that particular stimulus, the response may or may not occur, depending in the main on the time interval since it last occurred. The next most easily defined is the type of learning known as the coni-</page><page sequence="10">THE PARALLEL BETWEEN LEARNING AND EVOLUTION I83 ditioned reflex. Two varieties of conditioned reflex have been distinguished by KONORSKY (I,48). The essential of Type I is that the proximity in time of two patterns of sensory stimulation leads to a change in the nervous system such that a response which was elicited by one sensory stimulus becomes elicitable by the other. The response is in all cases of the nature of an instinctive response in the sense in which the term is used by LORENZ (I950); that is, its detailed form is largely innate and it is merely released by the stimulus and not fully determined by it. In conditioned reflex Type II a new response becomes associated with the original stimulus, instead of a new stimulus with the original response. The difference between these two types has appeared to THORPE (1950) to be fundamental, but it is con- venient for the present to consider them together. The third type of learning is classed by THORPE as trial-and-error learn- ing. Essentially, the animal makes more-or-less random movements and selects, in the sense that it subsequently repeats, those which produce the "desired" result; namely, those which lead to the correct conditions for the release of a further response. The fourth type, insight learning, is that in which the animal, without visible trial-and-error or with a reduced number of errors, performs a new action which leads to the "goal"; that is, again, an action which releases a further chain of responses. It is inherent in the definition of this type of learning that the whole situation with which the animal is presented is one to which it has not responded before either in its own lifetime or in its ancestry. Some features of the environmental situation, however, in learning of this type have in all cases been encountered before, possibly on various different occasions, and it is in the ability to combine the memory of these past experiences in its analysis of the new test situation that the peculiarity of insight learning resides. THORPE subsumes under the term "insight learning" the "latent learning" of BLODGETT (I929). Latent learning is the name given to the process whereby patterns of sensory stimulation affect subsequent behaviour but do not produce an immediate response. Such a process may be regarded as a part of the process of insight learning, for when it has taken place and the further stimulus needed to release an active response is given, the response consists not in random trial-and-error activities but proceeds with the elimination of certain actions which would be rendered ineffective by the situations previously experienced. The final type of learning in THORPE'S classification, "imprinting", is a specialized process found in birds and possibly in insects, by which the environmental situation at certain critical periods in the animal's lifetime Behaviour III I3</page><page sequence="11">I84 J. W. S. PRINGLE becomes especially effective in producing permament modifications of sub- sequent behaviour. Its characteristics will be discussed later. COMPLEXITY IN TIME In order to decide whether any or all of these types of the learning process involve an increase in complexity, a short digression is necessary, since we have used to concept hitherto only in relation to structure, and an extension of the idea is needed to justify its application to behaviour, where the idea of complexity in time is involved rather than complexity of form. The ideas developed in this article make use of the concept of order, the negative of thermodynamic entropy, to distinguish between chaotic systems such as a gas, and complex systems such, for example, as a protein molecule. The additional feature present in the latter but not in the former is that the individual units of which it is composed (atoms or amino-acid residues) have some restraint on their relative movements in space; they are held together in the form of a single molecule. Current views on molecular structure do not impose any restraint in time on the movements of the in- dividual units; they are free to occupy any of their possible relative positions at any time, and there is no way of determining which position they occupy at any instant. Thus, theories of muscular contraction involving the coiling of long protein fibres (PRYOR, I950) do not specify the state of coiling of any single molecule over a period of time, or of groups of molecules at a given instant of time, but merely the statistical sum of the effects of all the molecules acting over a period of time. It is perfectly possible, theoretically, to introduce order into a system by limiting its freedom in time instead of its freedom in space. TI'he passage of a sound wave through a gas involves such a restraint on the freedom of movement of the atoms in time, although it is no more possible to define the spatial relationships between the atoms under such conditions than if the sound waves were not passing. If order, in its widest sense, can mean order in time as well as order in space, then the hypothesis must be extended to include the concept of complexity in time as well as complexity of form, and there should be a process analogous to the selection of random variations which is capable of causing complexity in time to increase in a system in the same way as is possible for complexity of form. This space-time transposition is not easy to visualize, since, as we saw earlier, the use of the term complexity implies verifiability of observation. Verifiability in this case cannot mean repeatability of successive observations, but must imply confirmation by simultaneous observations in different places.</page><page sequence="12">THE PARALLEL BETWEEN LEARNING AND EVOLUTION I85 Behaviour is thus fully ordered when it consists of an indefinite repetition of the same event, and chaotic when the sequence of events does not contain any element of repetition whatever. The complexity of a description of the behaviour resides in the number of independent rhythms into which it can be analysed, and it relies for its objectivity on the fact that several simultaneous observations yield the same result. For example, we can describe the com- plexity of the swimming of a fish because simultaneous observations on different parts of the body yield the same rhythmic form. If the fish swam continuously at the same rate its behaviour would be simple; the fact that it starts and stops at once introduces complexity. The two definitions of complexity, the spatial and the temporal, are, of course, both involved in most descriptions of animal behaviour, since the animal does not react as a whole. But it is the temporal complexity which is mainly of interest here, since it is that concept which is less well under- stood. An increase in spatial or structural complexity is well known to occur in the evolutionary process. It seems clear that, defined in this way, complexity increases in each case in which learning can be said to have occurred. The complexity increase resides in the new temporal relationship between two events which arises in the process of learning. We saw in the example from crystallization how the incorporation of an atom of the isotope produced an increase in com- plexity while the accurate repetition of the original did not. The establishment of an ordered relationship between two events, one of which is new, increases the complexity of the system, in contradistinction to the continuation of a pre-existing relationship. Even in the case of habituation where the final condition may be one in which no response occurs on stimulation, the com- plexity has increased, since the regularity in time of the stimulus-response relationship has altered. The response having occurred on the first stimula- tion, it is evident that the condition of the animal at that time was such that a particular temporal relationship held between two events; the final state in which the response does not occur is different from a state in which the ,response never occurs, since in habituation it has occurred and may recur again in the course of time. The absence of a single event in a sequence is thus a more complex state than its presence. Where the response which has disappeared is an instinctive response it is pertinent that the animal can still transmit to its offspring the capacity for showing that response. One reference may be quoted from recent literature to show that this problem of complexity in behaviour is being actively considered at the pres- ent time, though in other terms. MCCULLOCH (I948), in a discussion of what he calls "teleological mechanisms", outlines briefly the difficulty which</page><page sequence="13">I86 J. w. S. PRINGLE has been felt in assigning an origin to the phenomenon of pattern perception. It the terms used in this article, pattern perception means the release of a response or the modification of a subsequent response by a complex ordered state in the environment. MCCULLOCH quotes J. S. MILL for the suggestion that the basis of resemblances for each individual rests on inheritance- associations "in space and time throughout the development of the kind". He refers to KAPPER's Law of Neurobiotaxis as another statement of the fact of the phenomenon, though not an explanation. He then states: "It is clear that the same thing happens in the introduction of new ideas or the recognition of new forms within the span of a single life, though obviously the mechanism cannot be the same". It is the thesis of this article that the mechanism, in essentials, is the same, although the substance of which the system is constructed is, in this instance, the substance of the inidividual central nervous system, instead of the whole world of living organisms and their environment. THE MECHANISM OF LEARNING IN THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM. To justify our hypothesis in its application to the phenomenon of learning it is necessary to suggest a type of mechanism, consistent with what is known about the physiology of the central nervous system, which is capable of per- forming a selection of variation in time in a manner analogous to the natural selection of variation in form found in organic evolution. Such a process is to be found in the properties of coupled oscillators, and it will now be shown how, from a population of coupled oscillators, a model can be constructed which has the property of "evolution" in the sense in which that term has been used. The phenomena associated with the coupling of oscillators have been studied mainly by electronic engineers in relation to the types of oscillation which occur in electronic valve circuits. The theoretical (mathematical) treat- ment of the general problem is involved, and certain simplifying assumptions are usually made which limit the usefulness of such studies to the general problem here formulated. Thus ADLER (1946) derives equations which are applicable only to the case of resonant oscillators, and JELONEK (1950) uses a similar simplification. From our point of view it is more useful to describe certain qualitative features of the behaviour of oscillating systems which have a greater gen-erality^ than these mathematical analyses. The most obvious feature of coupled oscillators is the phenomenon of 4'locking" or "synchronization". When the natural frequencies of two oscilla-</page><page sequence="14">THE PARALLEL BETWEEN LEARNING AND EVOLUTION tors are not far removed from one another and there is coupling between them in the form of a non-reactive energy-transfer from one to the other, the two systems oscillate as a single unit at a frequency intermediate between the two natural frequencies but with a phase difference which is dependant on the intensity of the coupling and on the difference in natural frequencies of each oscillator in isolation. If the natural frequency of one oscillator (01) is varied while that of the second (02) is maintained constant, the relationship between the natural frequency of 01 and the observed fre- quencies of 01 and 02 is as shown in Fig. 2, a, when the form of the two natural oscillations is sinusoidal (Fig. I, a, linear oscillation). Synchronization occurs over a range of frequencies depending on the closeness of coupling, and the mutual effect of one on the other is symmetrical. a) Linear oscillation. b) Non-linear oscillation. c) Relaxation oscillation. Fig. I. 'ypes of oscillator waveforms. If the natural oscillations are not sinusoidal (non-linear oscillators) the behaviour of the coupled pair becomes asymmetrical. Let us assume a wave- form such as that of Fig. I, b, for the natural oscillations. The frequency of oscillation of the pair in the synchronization range is now shifted so that it is always greater than the mean of the two natural frequencies, with the result that the faster of the pair appears to be shifted less far from its natural frequency by the coupling than does the slower (Fig. 2, b). This asymmetry is well illustrated by the behaviour of the extremely non-linear type known as a relaxation oscillator (Figs. I, c; 2, d). The frequency of two relaxation oscillators over the synchronization range is very nearly the natural frequency of the faster of the pair, so that the interaction appears to be unidirectional when the frequency of oscillation is the parameter under observation. When the natural frequency of one oscillator is altered so as to bring it into the synchronization range the onset of synchronization is not instan- taneous but, particularly I) if the oscillators are only just oscillating, and II) if the oscillations are non-linear, may take an appreciable time to develop, during which the actual frequencies approach one another although the exter- I87</page><page sequence="15">cX t 0 4)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~0 co ,. *.~~~~~c ) 4 ,) a &gt; &lt;8N- 0 ~~~synchronization range natural frequency of 0, (a) ,/(increasing) -f / ,~~~~~~~~~~~~'(decreasing) js J /'' I.

Similarly at the other end of the range the breaking of synchronization takes a certain time to occur. This gives rise, when the natural frequency of one oscillator is varied continuously, to a hysteresis phenomenon, the synchronization range depend- ing on the direction from which and the rate at which the natural frequency of one oscillator (Or) approaches that of the other (02). If 01 approaches 02 from below (frequency increasing) (Fig. 2, b, d) the synchronization persists beyond the point at which it appears when 01 approaches 02 from above (frequency decreasing) (Fig. 2, c, e). With non-linear oscillators this means that the actual frequency of oscillation of the "fixed" oscillator 02 iS changed less when the natural frequency of 01 passes through its natural frequency in a descending direction than when it does so in an ascending direction. Conversely the actual frequency of 0t is changed more when its natural frequency is decreasing. The importance of this hysteresis phenom- enon will be apparent later. Asymmetry in the mutual relationships of a pair of oscillators provides an essential feature of the proposed model. In a population of oscillators the process of synchronization corresponds to the reproduction of an in- dividual in a natural population; the growth in numbers of oscillators showing this frequency of oscillation is initially of the exponential type character- istic of autocatalytic systems provided each oscillator is uniformly coupled to its neighbours. Once the steady-state distribution of frequencies of oscillation has become established in a population of coupled oscillators, the asymmetry of mutual interaction ensures that an increase in the natural frequency of one oscillator has a greater effect on the state of the popula- tion than a decrease. This effect is most clearly appreciated in the case of relaxation oscilla- tions, and it is in fact found in the beats of the chambers of the vertebrate heart, which behave like relaxation oscillators. The coupling here is so strong that the whole heart normally beats as a single unit at a frequency determined by that of the fastest component (normally the sino-auricular node). The momentary rise in frequency produced by the injection of an external electrical stimulus to the sino-auricular node advances the beats of the whole heart, and the event can therefore be considered to have replicated throughout the coupled population. No effect is produced by the lag of a beat in, say, the ventricle, since it is caused to beat at the normal time by the influence transmitted to it from the faster beating auricle. In the majority of oscillators studied by electronic engineers there is a very considerable degree of constancy in the time intervals between successive cycles or beats. This regularity derives from the high energy levels of the</page><page sequence="17">I90 J. Wv. S. ?RINGLE oscillation in comparison with the random energy fluctuations in the com- ponents (thermal noise). Oscillators can, however, be constructed in which the random energy fluctuations produce a variation in the timing of the beats, so that the frequency fluctuates about a mean value in a random manner. If the fluctuations are slow compared with the mean frequency of oscillation, the effect is to produce a "wavering" frequency; if the fluctua- tions are rapid compared with the mean frequency of oscillation the intervals between successive beats vary. Since a wide range of frequencies is normally present in the random energy fluctuations in components both effects may occur together. A coupled population of non-sinusoidal oscillators showing this variation in natural frequencies owing to thermal noise corresponds to a natural population evolving by natural selection of random variations. If the coupling is sufficiently loose to allow certain oscillators or groups of oscillators to escape from the synchronization range when the variation is sufficiently great, complexity can increase in such a system in a manner analogous to the increase in complexity seen in the organic evolution of populations sufficiently subdivided into isolated "demes" for the SEWVALL- WRIGHT effect or "drift" to appear in the demes and produce divergence of structural form. We have already noted that it is a condition for the in- crease in structural complexity of a system either that there should be iso- lation of one part from another or that the environmental conditions be different in different parts. Similarly two cases can be distinguished for the increase in temporal complexity in the model. Instead of distinct parts of the system which preserve their separateness with the passage of time we now need to have distinct rhythms which remain distinct as they move through the population in space. If all the oscillators in a population are beating in synchronism and mutual coupling is strong (as in the heart), a small advance in the beat of the fastest beating unit advances them all, and although there is a permanent change in the timing of the beats, no increase in complexity results. This corresponds to the incorporation of a mutation in the whole of a population of -organisms.,If coupling is weak, one part of the system may become isolated from the rest by the occurrence in it of a frequency too far removed from that in the rest of the system for it to have any effect on it, and the two rhythms may then persist independant of each other. Isolation in this case consists in isolation in time rather than in space since all the parts may remain morphologically coupled together. Alternatively, if the natural frequencies become different in different regions of the population due to external influences acting unequally on different members of the population, the whole again becomes a complex association of parts, inter- action only occurring when frequencies are sufficiently close to bring a pair of units within their synchronization range.</page><page sequence="18">THE PARALLEL BETWEEN LEARNING AND EVOLUTION I9I Such a model is of little value unless its "evolution" is controlled or conditioned by events in the external world; if there is no limit to its varia- tion the course of its evolution becomes completely unpredictable. Natural organic evolution proceeds in such a way that the species become adapted to the environmental conditions; to our model we must now add some feature to correspond to the environment. This is supplied by allowing the natural frequencies of the oscillators to be affected unequally by influences external to the population, which thereby create in it an "environment" which moulds the direction of evolution of the system. With this addition the parallel is complete between our model showing an "evolutionary" increase of com- plexity of time, and the system of living organisms evolving to greater complexity of form, and we may consider how far the model is applicable to conditions found in the central nervous system of animals. The first reason for preferring a model based on complexity in time to one producing complexity of form for the central nervous mechanism of learning is the rapidity of the process. One example of the evolution of complexity of form (organic evolution) involves a time scale on the order of millions of years. Even if the more rapid adaptive changes occurring in populations of plasmagenes (SPIEGELMAN, 1948) involve a similar process, the rate is still much too slow to account for the rapid forms of learning. It is not easy to see how a process which depends on structural replication can ever approach the speed required when the replicating units have the com- plexity involved in patterns of behaviour. There is therefore an initial pre- ference for a systemn involving complexity in time for the learning mechanism of the central nervous system. The observed physiological properties of central nervous tissues suggest that the model is of the right type, since there is direct evidence that electrical rhythms occur, apparently spontaneously, in many of the central nervous structures which on other grounds are held to be the site of the learning process, (ADRIAN and BUYTENDIJK, 193I, brain stem of goldfish; WALTER, I950, human cerebral cortex). TI'he hypothesis is therefore put forward that the learning capacity of the central nervous systems of animals is a property of populations of nerve cells behaving as loosely coupled oscilla- tors. The sensory systems of the body act unequally on this population to set up conditions which in a formal manner represent certain features of the animal's environment, and the effector systems are coupled to it through analysing centres each responding to a particular "species" of internal rhythmic pattern. The motor systems evidently contain in themselves a high degree of inherited complexity so that the externally observed behaviour is related to the state of the population of oscillators in ways which are to a</page><page sequence="19">I92 J. W. S. PRINGLE large extent characteristic of the species of animal. These ways represent the instinctive component of behaviour and may be very elaborate. The in- herited complexity of the analysing system is also manifested in a series of "key trigger" actions, so that the set of rhythmic patterns needed to initiate the activity of each instinctive centre is itself complex (compare the "releasers" of LORENZ, I950) though not necessarily as complex as the activity which is initiated. It is not suggested that the learning process is completely centralized at one level in the central nervous system. To the extent that any nervous centre contains a population of cells behaving as non-linear oscillators, the activity of that centre can show adaptive properties involving a selection from possible alternatives, and can play its part in the learning shown by the whole animal. To put forward in detail plans for central nervous mechanisms which will account even in general terms for each of the different manifestatGons of the learning process involves a number of postulates which are not vital for the main thesis but which may nevertheless be made to illustrate the tyfpe of system which is suggested by the basic conclusions. A possible model which appears to be more in line with what is known about the properties of the nervous systems of animals is one in which the oscillators are net single cells (as in the heart) but closed loops or "reverberatory arcs" of.neurons acting as oscillators a s a w h o 1 e. By this is not meant that an- impulse travels round the arc in the way that the concept of the reverberatory arc is usually understood (LORENTE DE No, I938) but that the whole chain of neurons is coupled so that it acts as a single oscillator, each cell influencing the excitation of the next with a certain "lead" or "lag" so that the whole generates a nearly sinusoidal oscillation when the phase change round the loop equals a multiple of 360 degrees. Excitation is here used to refer to the state of the cell which causes a rise in the frequency of impulses and not to the process giving rise to a single impulse. PRINGLE and WILSON (1951) have discussed the way in which the adaptation property of excitable tissues can generate a phase change between successive elements. Closed loop con- nections between a number of such neurons would generate oscillations more nearly sinusoidal in character than the relaxation phenomena which appear to be responsible for the rhythmic impulse discharge in a single neuron, and this model (a phase shift oscillator) therefore overcomes one of the difficul- ties of interpreting the nearly sinusoidal potential changes which are found in the cerebral cortex as the sum of a number of spike waveforms. An essential feature is readily introduced into the model if the oscilla- tions are considered to be generated in this way, since the loops in which the oscillations are generated may share short sequencies of neurons and thus</page><page sequence="20">THE PARALLEL BETW'EEN LEARNING AND EVOLUTION I93 become coupled by competition for the shared cells (Figure 3). An oscilla- tion in the loop ABA will cause a periodic rise and fall of the state of excita- tion of the shared cell X. If the natural frequency of oscillation of the loop CDC is slightly lower than that of ABA the result will be a synchronization of the two. If the oscillations in each loop are non-linear in character, as is to be expected from the known properties of phase-shift oscillators, the synchronized frequency of the two will be nearer to that of A than to that of B, so introducing the asymmetrical character of the mutual relationship necessary for the selection process as described above. Non-linearity of the oscillations has another important corollary. As a result of the hysteresis phenomenon described in Fig. 2, b, c, there is a difference in the action of ABA on CDC if the frequency of the former is increasing or decreasing. ,/X A! / Fig. 3. Diagram of two coupled closed loops of ineurons. If ABA approaches CDC from below it holds it in synchronism over a range of frequencies and breaks synchronism only when CDC has been raised well above its natural frequency. If ABA approaches CDC from above, synchronism is not established until the two natural frequencies are nearly the same, and CDC is not depressed below its natural frequency by the same amount as it was raised in the former case. On the other hand the actual frequency of ABA is changed more during the period of synchron- ization. This hysteresis has results which are of great importance in the interpretation of certain forms of learning in terms of the action of the model. The sharing of chains of neurons by oscillators introduces competition in</page><page sequence="21">I94 J. w. S. I RINGLE space as well as competition in time. The result is a disappearance of one of the differences between the working of this model and that of organic evolution. The pattern of oscillations moves over the population of cells as a wave, achieving a replication of functional form, and a more rapidly replicating pattern displaces it by competition for the shared nerve cells. If form is represented by simultaneity of action instead of as the form of an organism or of a chemical molecule, its rate of creation from component parts is limited only by the speed of the coupling process which may be very high and the objection mentioned above to the form-replicating machine as a model of the learning mechanism disappears. It may be supposed that it is this pattern of simultaneity which is the significant feature in the operation of the "key trigger" mechanisms for the release of activity in lower centres, leading finally to the motor response. Spatial sumnmation of excitation on the motor neuron in the vertebrate spinal cord is a well-established phenomenon (LLOYD, I944) and it has been suggested that summation may be limited to synaptic terminations in close proximity on the surface of the cell (BODIAN, I942). If each region of the cell of the next lower centre received fibres from a particular pattern of regions in the population of cells in the learning centre, they would be excited only when this pattern of simultaneous excitation became established at a sufficiently high frequency or over a sufficiently large part of the total population. THE TYPES OF LEARNING The main thesis of this article is that there is a parallel between the process of organic evolution and process of learning, and the basis of the argument is the unique kinematic nature of the process which results in a selection of variations. It has so far been assumed that the variations which form the background for the selection process in the case of the central nervous system are variations due to thermal noise in the frequency of oscillations occurring in populations of nerve cells. It is, however, apparent that the environmental conditions controlling the sensory input to the selection mechanism of the central nervous system contain a measure of variability in themselves. The portions of the universe with which an animal is in sensory contact are not fully ordered, (i.e. there is not regular repetition in space or time of the sensory messages) and there is therefore material for selection all the time in the changing formal "environment" in the central nervous system. It is clear that in this way the complexity of the organism can increase, if there is a selection mechanism present, without the necessity for spontaneous varia-</page><page sequence="22">THE PARALLEL BETWEEN LEARNING AND EVOLUTION I95 tion to occur within it. This process corresponds, by analogy, to the reshuffl- ing of an existing gene complex which occurs in a species of organism when the environmental conditions change. The modification to the model of the central nervous system needed to achieve only this type of complexity-increase and not the purely endogenous type (which can occur theoretically in a constant external environment) is simply the removal of variation from the frequency of the oscillators. The selection criterion is still left in the asymmetry of the locking process between coupled oscillators. Such a system within the central nervous system would not increase in complexity in a constant environment, but would increase if the material for selection were supplied from without. This simplified model reduces, in fact, virtually into a machine for transposing environ- mental complexity in time and form into a single system in which mutual asymmetrical interactions can take place. The selection is then performed by the only criterion of which the system is capable, namely antecedence in time, and the result is then re-translated inLo complexity of form and time in the effector systems. CONDITIONED REFLEX TYPE I The interpretation of some of the types of learning in terms of the model -may now be considered, starting with conditioned reflex type I of KONORSKY (I948). "A conditioned reflex arises when two stimuli, of which one evokes an inborn, permanent, or so-called unconditioned reaction of the organism, are applied in association a number of times, and it consists in the second of these stimuli beginning to evoke the same kind of reaction as that pro- duced by the first stimulus" (KONORSKY, I948, P. 7). It is a further requisite that the conditioned (or "to be learned") stimulusi should precede the un- -conditioned stimulus in time. Associated with the normal conditioned reflex are two forms of inhibition which must also be explained by any theory of learning. "External inhibition" is the suppression of an innate reaction by an extraneous stimulus applied simultaneously, and it occurs particularly when the extraneous stimulus produces a response in the animal different from the normal innate response to the unconditioned stimulus. "Internal inhibition" arises in two ways; either when an established conditioned reflex is not reinforced by the unconditioned stimulus over a number of applica- tions of the conditioned stimulus: or when the conditioned stimulus is applied after the unconditioned. In both cases the inhibition manifests itself as a reduction in the magnitude of the innate response, or as a rise in the strength -of the conditioned stimulus needed to evoke the same magnitude of response.</page><page sequence="23">196 J. W. S. PRINGLE This type of behaviour is interpreted in the model as shown in figure 4. Normally the presentation of unconditioned response A leads to the growth in the learning mechanism L of certain rhythmic patterns specific for the release, when they reach a certain intensity, of instinctive response X through the key trigger K. If the conditioned stimulus B is presented before the presentation of stimulus A, the cells of L are in a modified state when A is presented and the growth of the specific pattern starts. Since the frequen- cies of the oscillators in L are rising due to the presentation of A, they will "collect" into their own rhythm other oscillators composed of cells still showing excitation due to B and beating at frequencies through which the stimulus B (conditioned) itimulus A (unconditioned) Learning mechanism L Key trigger K response Fig. 4. Schenmatic block diagram for a conditioned reflex of Type I. oscillations due to A rise. The extent of the pattern of simultaneity of action therefore grows. When the pattern is established over a sufficiently large part of the population at a sufficiently high frequency the response X occurs. In order that a repetition of this sequence of events a number of times should lead to a state of affairs in which B alone is adequate for the growth of the specific pattern to release K it is necessary. to show that those cells or groups of cells which have become incorporated into oscillators. forming the specific pattern are changed in some way, so that they syn- chronize more readily at the application of B + A, and finally develop the specific pattern without the presence of A at all. The nature of this change is discussed below. External inhibition is interpreted as an upset in the development of the</page><page sequence="24">THE PARALLEL BETWEEN LEARNING AND EVOLUTION I97 pattern for the release of K by the other patterns developed under the in- fluence of the extraneous stimulus competing for the cells of the learning centre. Stimuli most effective in producing external inhibition are those which lead to some other response and which therefore presumably en- courage the development of a different pattern. It is significant that the most effective conditioned stimuli are those which do not normally lead to a response. The internal inhibition which develops when attempts are made to achieve "backward conditioning" by presenting the conditioned stimulus B after the unconditioned stimulus A is attributable to the hysteresis phenomenon in the synchronization of non-linear oscillators mentioned above. In this type of experiment the central effect of stimulus B appears at a time when the frequency of oscillations due to A is decreasing, and the oscillations set up by B therefore produce a greater effect on the oscillations still occurring due to A, than those due to A do on those due to B. Since the oscillations due to B compete for cells with those generating the patterns for the release of K, the effect will be a break-up of these patterns and a resulting in- hibition of response X. In its initial stage such an inhibition does not differ from the external inhibition produced by the application of any extraneous stimulus subsequent to the unconditioned stimulus, but the difference arises when the experiment is repeated many times, for the stimulus B then becomes progressively more effective as an inhibitor. In the same way that in a normal positive conditioned reflex a change occurs which makes R more effective as a promoter of the growth of the pattern for K, so when applied after A, a change must occur which makes B progressively more effective as an inhibitor of the growth of this pattern. The other type of internal inhibition produced by the presentation without reinforcement of stimulus B after it has become effectively conditioned to release response X, is best considered after a discussion of the nature of the "plastic" changes involved in conditioning, which must now be considered. It is clear at once that, since the changes accompanying conditioning persist for long after the stimuli have ceased, the residual effect between each suc- cessive application of B + A cannot be thought of as a change in the pattern of synchronized activity in the learning mechanism L, but must be represented by some change in the cells of L which alters the patterns which are subsequently set up when the stimulus is again presented. KONORSKY (1948) makes the definite suggestion that these plastic changes consist in the establishment of new excitatory or inhibitory synaptic connections be- tween cells, and this idea of a change in the intercellular connections is inherent in such phrases as "a lowering of synaptic resistence" which are</page><page sequence="25">I98 J. w. S. PRINGLE to be found in the literature on this subject. There are serious objections to any structural explanation of plasticity because of the extreme complexity and rapidity of the process as observed in such forms of learning as im- printing. In any case, if our model is to be of real value, and if the parallel with organic evolution is valid, we should try to find features in it which account for the plastic changes involved in learning without the introduction of new postulates of an unknown nature. The necessary mechanism is, in fact, already present in the model as described, but its operation only becomes clear when we examine in more ,detail the events in each cell. As was stated earlier, the oscillations which generate the specific patterns in the learning centre are to be thought of as produced by the connection, in closed loops, of cells each of which is capable of manifesting a varying degree of excitation and of influencing the next cell in the chain with a certain lead or lag (PRINGLE and WILSON, I951). The term excitation is used here not in the same sense as is usual in studies of peripheral nerve, where it refers to the process giving rise to a single im- pulse, but to a maintained state in the cell, measureable as some function of the frequency of impulses traversing the-axon of the cell. Its identifica- tion with the slow electrical changes occurring at the ends of peripheral nerve fibres (BARRON and MATTHEWS, 1938; KATZ, I950) is a reasonable conjecture, but it presumably also involves internal changes of equilibrium of a chemical nature. The sum of its electrical manifestations in many cells may account for the slow potential changes which are observed in the mamal- ian cerebral cortex (WALTER, I950). Since excitation in this sense is a maintained state which grows and declines in relation to changes in the environment of the cell (stimulation) we may look for a parallel between it and the properties of the particular type of open system discussed on page I79, -the level of excitation in each cell corresponding to the quantity of the "unit" there discussed. The subsequent discussion of evolutionary changes in populations of such open systems applies to the model, provided that it is borne in mind that competitive interaction in the model takes place between oscillators composed of many cells, in each of which the level of excitation undergoes cyclic changes during the oscillations about some mean value which represents the level of excitation in the absence of the oscillations. In particular, just as a transient change in the environmental conditions of a population of organisms may produce an enduring change in the inter- specific equililbrium, so a transient stimulus (such as the application of B + A) may leave an enduring effect on the mean value of the excitation of the cells composing -the oscillators in the model of the learning centre.</page><page sequence="26">THE PARALLEL BETWEEN LEARNING AND EVOLUTION I99 This may occur whether or not the oscillations set up by the stimulus persist after the end of stimulation. Each application of the combined stimulus thus finds the cells in a different condition, and the gradual establishment of the conditioned state becomes a possibility. Returning to the mechanism of the conditioned reflex we have then in the model features adequate to explain the residual change in the central nervous system needed to enable successive applications of stimulus B + A to develop a condition in which B alone releases response X through its key trigger mechanism. The advancing of the beat of certain cells excited by B which occurs when the frequency of oscillations induced by A is in- creasing, and which pulls them into the pattern of synchronism operating K, leaves these cells at levels of excitation such that they more readily fall into this pattern when B is presented subsequently. Similarly the advancing of the beats of certain cells excited by A when the frequency of oscillations induced by A is decreasing leaves them at levels of excitation which make them less readily synchronizable into this pattern in subsequent presenta- tion of B + A. The two plastic effects need not occur in the same cells; internal inhibition is not merely a cancellation of conditioning, as KONORSKY (1948) has pointed out. The drift back to their original condition of cells whose level has been modified by positive conditioning is a much more grad- ual process than the inhibition, and it is significant that the inhibition can be disinhibited by a variety of extraneous stimuli which produce a general raising of the level of central excitation. The number of changes of cell excitation level needed partially to upset the pattern of synchronization is smaller than that needed to establish a state in which it occurs, and it is therefore reasonable that it should be possible to neutralize the effect of the inhibitory changes by an increase in the intensity of those patterns which still remain established. The key trigger is operated when the lower centre is excited by a sufficiently high frequency of impulses reaching those regions of its surface in which spacial summation remains effective due to the development of the specific patterns in certain parts of the cell population. In contrast to previous theories about the nature of the plastic changes in the central nervous system, this model attributes plasticity to changes occurring within the cells themselves, and not in the connections between them, which can remain morphologically and physiologically constant. It also has the merit that it does not localize these changes in any particular part of the learning centre, since the cells whose level of excitation is altered may be distributed almost at random throughout the popula-tton (see LASHLEY (1950) for a discussion of the apparent lack of localisation of the "memory trace"). Behaviour III '4</page><page sequence="27">200 J. W. S. PRINGLE It remains to consider the internal inhibition which is produced by the failure to reinfore a conditioned stimulus. As KONORSKY (I948) points out, this process is not the same as the gradual fading of conditioning which occurs when the conditioned stimulus is not presented at all for a long period, in that even though the response fails to occur the conditioning ma) be caused to reappear by raising the level of central excitation by extraneous stimuli. The fading of conditioning is to be thought of as a drift back to their original level of the cells whose level of excitation has been changed. The inhibition, however, must result from a failure of the specific patterns to establish themselves at a sufficient high level before this drift back is complete. The probable mechanism for this inhibition would appear to be as follows. The presentation of stimulus B starts in the population certain oscillations which increase in frequency and capture other oscillators in their growth process. Although in the conditioned state the resulting patterns are adequate to release K the process of capture also leads to plastic changes in certain cells, and since the patterns produced by B are not identical with those produced by A, the changes will lead to a reduction in the similarity to the "correct" pattern for the release of K. These plastic changes are superimposed on those involved in the original conditioning and do not reverse them, although the effect of them is to diminish the correctness of the pattern. An inhibition thus results long before the original plastic changes have disappeared from the population. In this interpretation of the mechanism of conditioning in terms of the model of the central nervous system we have been led into a more detailed identification of the processes with particular neuronic mechanisms than was intended in the earlier sections. The main thesis of the parallel with evolutionary processes must not be overlooked in such physiological detail. There are, in fact, a number of ways in which the process of conditioning resembles the processes of evolution. The magnitude of the specific pattern, for example, resembles the numbers of an animal species in the way in which it grows. The conditions produced in the central nervous cell popula- tion by the unconditioned stimulus A corresponds to the environmental conditions normally optimal for the growth in numbers of this particular organism. The conditioning to stimulus B corresponds to the adaptation of the species to new environmental conditions. A particular example-the growth in number of a bacterial population-is interesting in that, as HIN- SHELWOOD (1946) has pointed out, the logarithmic phase of growth is the period during which the phenomenon of adaptation to new culture media takes place. It is tempting to compare this to the positive conditioning which occurs to stimuli whose central effect coincides with the rise of excitation</page><page sequence="28">THE PARALLEL BETWEEN LEARNING AND EVOLUTION 20I due to the unconditioned stimulus, although the apparent absence of anything to correspond to internal inhibition in bacterial populations shows that the two systems are not equivalent. The use of pure cultures may be the clue to the difference, since in the learning centre it is never to be supposed that one specific pattern displaces all others from the population. The plastic change responsible for conditioning may also be compared to the lasting effect on a heterogeneous population of organisms of a transient change in the environmental conditions. Selection of the gene complex (HUXLEY, 1942) is capable of producing slow adaptive changes, even in the absence of mutation, as a result of the re-sorting of the genes at each sexual reproduction and of competition among individuals for the available living space and food supplies; it corresponds in the model to the com- petition for the limited cells of the population by the different possible rhythmic patterns of simultaneity. Examples may be multiplied indefinitely and serve no useful purpose except where a particular aspect of the learning process can be made clearer by a search for the corresponding situation in evolution, which may be easier to analyse. LATENT LEARNING It is convenient to discuss next the process which has been called latent learning, and which is included by THORPE (I950) as a feature of insight learning. This differs from the conditioned reflex in that two or more sensory patterns may become associated in the learning mechanism even when no response occurs immediately consequent upon the presentation of one of the stimuli. In the original form of learning to which the term was applied (BLODGETT, 1929) rats which had been left in a maze without food for some time subsequently learned to find the food faster than those placed in it for the first time when the food also was introduced. The sen- sory patterns which have become associated in this case were all the im- pressions received from any of the features of the maze and the case is therefore one of great complexity; but latent learning in the sense in which the term is defined above is undoubtedly a widespread phenomenon. In the interpretation of the mechanism of conditioning in terms of the model of the central nervous system, it will be realised that the response as such plays no part. The whole of the suggested mechanism works equallv well if the release of the response through its key trigger is prevented by some other agent. The subsequent effects of the response are not therefore of importance in conditioning, and it is significant that conditioned reflexes can be established as well to "unfavourable" as to "favourable" stimuli.</page><page sequence="29">202 J. W. S. PRINGLE Latent learning therefore appears to be a similar process to conditioning and to involve merely a selection by the learning mechanism of those aspects of the various sensory stimuli which are common to all or many of them. In -other words, when the stimuli do not provide the correct conditions for the growth of any one specific pattern up to a level when a response occurs, those patterns are selected which grow most readily. Since none of them occupies more than a fraction of the population (in the ecological parallel none is "dominant") each stimulus alters their relative intensities by capture of oscillators and leaves its plastic remainder. If the successive stimuli have1 much in common, the pattern which grows under the influence of this common feature will have grown the most and the cells will be in a state to redevelop subsequentlv this particular pattern more readily than any other. It is to phenomena of this nature that we must relate the perception of gestalt (ordered) patterns in the sensory stimuli. In terms of the model, the perception of a gestalt is the development of plastic changes which encourage the growth of a specif ic pattern whenever the sensory stimuli contain a particular combination of features. The order or repetition in time of this combination in a variety of otherwise different sensory im- pressions provides the necessary conditions for the accumulation of just those plastic changes which enable this particular pattern to develop. HABITUATION The types of conditioning so far discussed have in common the feature that the release of the response has no influence in the learning process. In all the manifestations of the process still to be considered this independence on the result does not appear, but rather the direction of the process, i.e. whether the result is positive learning or negative learning (inhibition) de- pends on the nature of the subsequent events. This is clearly brought out by the phenomenon of habituation. Habituation is the process whereby a stimulus becomes ineffective in releasing a response when that response does not lead to a significant result for the animal. It is commonly found with stimuli which lead to what PAVLOv has called the orientation reaction. When a dog is presented with an "alarming" stimulus it responds by adopting an attitude of defence whereby it is better able to resist a subsequent harmful stimulus. If this later stimulus does not materialize, the orientation reaction fades and the dog is said to have shown habituation to the first stimulus. In order to interpret such a phenomenon in our model a scheme sucn as -that of Figure 5 is necessary. When response X (in this case the orientation</page><page sequence="30">THE PARALLEL BETWEEN LEARNING AND EVOLUTION 203 reaction) occurs it produces a change in the sensory stimuli from A to B, due to the movement of the response. The new stimulus, during the frequency- increasing part of the oscillations which it induces in L, reduces the mag- nitude of the specific pattern for release of K in much the same manner as any external inhibitor. As a result, plastic changes occur which make the specific pattern for release of K grow less strongly on a subsequent application of A. If the orientation reaction is followed by the "expected" injurious stim- stimuius C stimulus B (injurious) Learning mechanism L Key trigger K Response x Fig. 5. Schematic block diagram for habituation. ulus C, the combined sensory stimulus becomes B + C instead of B alone. But C is a powerful inducer of the specific pattern for release of K (as may be tested by applying C alone initially) and in this case the pattern grows still further and the plastic changes are such as to encourage its growth on a subsequent presentation of A. In this way the nature of the plastic changes in L comes to depend on the result produced by the development of the pattern, in the manner which is commonly found in closed loop systems (sce the Symposium on Teleological Mechanisms, Proc. N. Y. Acad. Sciences 1948).</page><page sequence="31">204 J. W. S. PRINGLE Habituation is a widespread phenomenon, and when interpreted in terms of the model it is seen to be an example of a homoeostatic process of the type found in many physiological systems. It would appear that it is bound to occur whenever the response of the animal changes the sensory stimuius, unless the new stimulus itself encourages the growth of the specific pattern which has released the response. The fact that it does not occur in the other types of conditioning studied by the PAVLOV school may be attributed to the fact that the salivation response used by them does not normally affect to any marked extent the nature of the stimulus used. The reverse of habitua- tion, reinforcement or autofacilitation, which is well shown in some of the types of instinctive behaviour described by LORENZ (I950) can be inter- preted in a similar manner, the sensory stimulus which results from 1he response here encouraging still further the growth of the specific pattern for its own release. The necessary intensity of the initial stimulus A thus gets progressively less until, as has been found by LORENZ, the response may occur spontaneously without any visible causal agent. This is a rypical result to be expected from a mechanism showing positive feed-back witlh an ac- cumulation at each experiment (plastic change) of the factors determnining the intensity of the feed-back. CONDITIONED REFLEX TYPE II AND TRIAL-AND-ERROR LEARNING In interpreting conditioning of the normal type, and habituation, in terms of the model it is not necessary to suppose that there is any inherent variabil- ity in the frequencies of the oscillations generated in the learning mechanism by the sensory stimuli. Selection by time-antecedence operates on the com- plex pattern of oscillations set up by the external stimuli through the sense organs and the necessary variation is provided by the change from one stimulus to another. A different state of affairs is provided by conditioned reflexes of KONORSKY'S second type, and THORPE (I950), recognizing this, classifies this type with trial-and-error learning and not as a conditioned reflex at all. The significant difference will become apparent when we attempt to interpret the events in the manner already described. Figure 6 represents the scheme for a typical conditioned reflex type II. Initially, sensory stimulus A releases response X, followed, since the resulting stimul- us B is "reinforced" (KONORSKY'S use of the term) by the presentation of food (stimulus C), by a further encouragement of the growth of the specific pattern concerned or at least by the neutralization of the habituation effect which might otherwise occur. The procedure may now vary. Sensory</page><page sequence="32">THE PARALLEL BETWEEN LEARNING AND EVOLUTION 205 stimulus D in this type of conditioned reflex affects proprioceptive sense organs and is only produced by response Y. But sensory stimulus A, or A + B does, not cause the learnin-g mechanism L to develop the specific pat- terns needed to operate K2 and release response Y. For selection to take place in L in the presence of stimulus A + D response Y must be caused to occur. If the movement necessary to produce sensory stimulus D is produced by the operator moving the limbs of the animal passively, then the conditions { stimulus s |I _ z r , I ~~~~~~~~~~~stimulus 1) ~~~~~~~Stiinulus B stimulus C (food) Learning mechanism Key trigger Key trigger K, K2 Response Response x Y Fig. 6.

The significance of the interrupted line is explained in the text. are not significantly different from those in conditioned reflex type I, D being then the unconditioned, and A the conditioned stimulus. If, however, there is an element of variability in the learning mechanism L, the specific pattern needed to operate K2 and release response Y may be developed in the presence of sensory stimulus A, and, if it is developed, adaptation to A + B +D will occur; owing to the plastic changes in L which result, this particular pattern will then be more 1 i k e 1 y to develop in subsequent ex- periments. A new response Y can thus become associated with a sensory stimulus A by virtue e i t h e r of variation in the. environment (e.g. by the</page><page sequence="33">206 J. W. S. PRINGLE experimenter) simulating sensory stimulus D, o r by variation in L chancing to operate the key trigger for the release of the response. In the first case the process may be considered to be similar to that of conditioned reflex type I; in the second it is of the nature of trial-and-error. The more usual form of the occurrence of this system in nature is probably represented by the addition of the interrupted line in Figure 6. This implies that stimulus B + C reinforcing the specific pattern for the release of K1 is not produced unless the environmental changes produced by responses X and Y both occur; in other words, food is only obtained by the performance of both responses. The successive presentation of sensory stimulus A will now initially release a series of responses X. The response repetition will continue (unless suppressed by habituation) until either the environmental variation or the inherent variation in L results in the operation of key-trigger K2. When this happens the complete sensory stimulus A + B + C + D is produced, allowing selection to occur in L and increasing the chance of sensory stimulus A alone operating K2. The diagram of Figure 6 is, of course much oversimplified, and habituation will normally ensure that more than one instinctive response is released by repetition of stimulus A. The result is an appearance of trial-and-error, all possible responses being tried until some combination releases Y; this com- bination is then preserved by selection. INSIGHT LEARNING We now come to the most difficult and advanced type of the learning, process, insight learning. To use anthropomorphic terminology, the animal in this case appears to be able to work out the consequences of a number of possible alternative responses to sensory stimuli without actually per- forming them, and then, on the addition of a further stimulus, to perform only the one which leads to a favourable result. THORPE (I950) recognises that the process of insight learning is closely related to that of latent learning in that selection from possible sensory stimuli occurs without the performance of a response .This, however, is clearly not a full explanation, since insight learning involves a selection from possible r e s p o n s e s as well as selection from the total s t i m u 1 u s. Some form of internal trial-and-error must also be involved by which (in terms of Figure 6) the selection occurs not only from actual sensory messages but also from those which w o u 1 d be received i f the response movements were made. The whole of the loops must, then, be contained in the learning mechanism. We must reconsider the model in more detail to see how this can be achieved.</page><page sequence="34">THE PARALLEL BETWEEN LEARNING AND EVOLUTION 207 The model consists of a population of cells forming oscillators which inter- act in time because of the tendency of one oscillation to synchronize to itself another with a slightly lower natural frequency, and in space because some of the component cells are common to several oscillators. The sensory stimuli provide the "environment" for this population by modifying the level of excitation in the cells and so altering the frequency and composition of the oscillators. The level of excitation in the cells is also subject to random fluctuations, which also alter the frequency and composition of the oscillators and generate the variety of specific patterns involved in trial-and-error learning. There is no fundamental difference in the effects produced by these two influences which produce changes of the level of excitation in the cells: in the one case it is random changes in the external environment which produce variation in the sensory stimuli, and in the other the random fluctuations are endogenous in the cells of the learning mechanism. In either case selection by time-antecedence occurs on the background of variability so produced, and plastic changes follow, preserving a fraction of the selection ef f ects. Learning of the type of conditioned reflex type I involves only exogenous variation of the external environment influencing the centre through sense organs. Both the conditioned and the unconditioned stimuli are external to the animal. In trial-and-error learning or conditioned reflex type II where the movement is spontaneously originated, the conditioned stimulus is ex- ternal, but the unconditioned stimulus is originated endogenously and acts through the response and the resulting proprioceptive messages. There is clearly a third type of process, in which both conditioned and unconditioned effects are endogenous in origin, and whose progress bears no relation to events occurring simultaneously in the environment external the animal. Such a process would produce a progressive change in the frequency and composi- tion of the oscillators which is not entirely random in character, since any given random event in one cell has the dual effect of producing variation and of changing the conditions in which selection operates. In other words, since only those random changes which produce an increase in the frequency of oscillation are preserved by selection, each discrete change in the state of the whole system determines the conditions under which selection operates for the next step. The state of the system at any instant therefore defines the probabilities of each possible state at any given instant in the future. If the range of variability is slight, one or a few of these possible states may have much higher probabilities than any others and the behaviour of the whole system may be only slightly indeterminate. This, it is suggested, is the nature of the mechanism in the central nervous</page><page sequence="35">208 J. W. S. t RINGLE system which is capable of insight learning. Because in such a system every endogenous variation provides both the material for selection and the con- ditions in which selection occurs, the occurrence of patterns adequate to release instinctive responses is not random, but an organisation is built up in which the relationship between the pattern resulting from the selection process and the conditions in which the selection takes place is the same as the relationship between the key trigger and the sensory pattern usually resulting from the response (K2 and D in Figure 6): is, in fact, the same as the relationship between cause and effect in the organism-environment com- plex. Given a certain initial organization and variable oscillators contained entirely in the learning mechanism L, a particular process involving an increase in complexity in L can then occur with a high probability without the performance of any actual responses. It is pertinent to enquire how the organization required to define the relationship between the pattern resulting from selection and the conditions in which it takes place arises in the first instance in the individual. The relationship which is of value to the animal is the one which gives a per- fornmance similar to the relationship between cause and effect in its dealings with the environment, since only with this particular relationship will patterns be produced which release those instinctive responses which lead to the cor- rect conditions for the release of further favourable responses. The only ways in which such relationships can be incorporated into the central nervous machinery of an individual are (a) by inheritance (b) by trial-and-error learning (c) by contact with systems which already contain the required relation- ship, so that the complexity is incorporated "en bloc". In other words, the animal must be born with it, must find out, or must copy or be told. The last case opens up the subject of communication of information which it is not proposed to pursue here; the first needs no discussion. One further aspect of the trial-and-error method is, however, of interest. If the trial process leads to the completion of the feed-back loops only when one particular response occurs, the learning mechanism L will develop so that presentation of sensory pattern A always leads to the development of the key trigger for that one response, and the behaviour of the animal will become well a d a p t e d to a particular set of conditions but not more a d a p t a b 1 e to variations in environmental conditions. Again to use anthropomorphic term- inology, the animal will become good at doing one particular thing but not necessarily intelligent in general. This will be especially so if there is only</page><page sequence="36">THE PARALLEL BETWEEN LEARNING AND EVOLUTION a small amount of inherent variability in L. To achieve an organization in L which is capable of insight in the sense that the correct action to suit a particular set of circumstances occurs even when those circumstances have not occurred before in exactly that form, the requirement is, first, a larger measure of inherent variability and then a lengthy training in the form of a series of different conditions under each of which the mechanism of L changes slightly by selection. Slight variations of sensory pattern A are then capable of providing suitable conditions for the development of a wide range of specific patterns each of which leads to the release of the further response Y under the particular conditions present, and the mechanism becomes capable of analysing an entirely new situation into component features each of which has been encountered before in a different context, and of producing the right response without visible trial and error. One is tempted to extrapolate the process still further into the sphere of human behaviour. The human being is capable of a much greater degree of insight learning than any other animal, but the full development of his capabilities demands a process of "education" which is not the same thing as training, and differs from it in just the way which has been outlined. The continual repetition of a particular set of environmental conditions can lead, in man as in an animal, to a great increase in the efficiency of a response; that is, to the release of the next response ("success") on a pro- gressively increasing number of occasions. But this training does not necess- aril,, lead to the development of insight. To increase the ability of the human to deal with novel situations the requirement is for a long process of adaptation to a wide variety of situations each slightly dissimilar to the last, so that ultimately no new situation is likely to arise which contains, in its full analysis, more than a small amount of novelty to be dealt with by the visible trial-and-error process. The increased endogenous variability necessary for the development of insight has obvious disadvantages if it is not accompanied by selection through experience of the "right" relationships between the result of and conditions for selection in the central nervous mechanism, since it leads otherwise to a failure on some occasions to give the usual response. Natural selection will act against mechanisms with a high endogenous variability when the environmental conditions of life are changing slowly. It may be that the extremely rapidly changing conditions found in an arboreal existence are responsible for the high degree of endogenous variability which must occur in the human brain. 209</page><page sequence="37">210 J. W. S. PRINGLE IMPRINTING This last type of learning in THORPE'S (1950) classification is also the least well understood from experimental analysis. It has, according to THORPE, the following features: i) It is confined to a definite and brief period of the individual life, and possibly also to a particular set of environmental circumstances. 2) Once accomplished the process is very stable-in some cases perhaps totally irreversible. 3) It is often completed long before the various specific patterns to which the imprinted pattern will ultimately become linked are established. 4) It is supra-individual learning-a learning of broad characteristics rather than of particular details. From some points of view imprinting resembles latent learning in that it occurs without the appearance of a response. But the complex character of the behaviour-change which results, and the fact that imprinting occurs over such as small interval of time distinguishes it from the latter process. Until more experimental observations have been made it is unwise to identify it with any particular characteristics of the model which has been proposed, but is seems probable that it is connected in some way with the establishment of that central organisation which is needed to define the transition prob- abilities in the development of insight learning. It was mentioned in the last section that a mechanism with a high endogenous variability must have this initial organisation if it is not to become chaotic in its behaviour. A means of "imprinting" such a basic organisation on the unorganised mechanism could narrow very considerably the range of trial needed to establish a more detailed organisation by trial-and-error, and it could thus supplement to a large extent the innate organisation which must be present in the histolog- ical structure of neuron connections. Such an interpretation is consistent with the supra-individual character of the imprinting process and with the fact that it may be completed before its effects become apparent in the ease of conditioning to various stimuli or the ease of release of certain responses. The modifications to the quantitative features of the model needed to allow imprinting to take place during a particular interval of time in the life of the individual need not be attempted at this stage. CONCLUSION: THE LOCATION OF MEMORY In conclusion, it may perhaps be justifiable to include a further suggestion. Trhe model which has been described as an aid to the interpretation of the types of the learning process is one which could be constructed by the use</page><page sequence="38">THE PARALLEL BETWEEN LEARNING AND EVCLUTION 21 of techniques developed in the design of analytical machines. The device would be of the type known as an analogue machine, as opposed to the digital machines which are now widely used for mathematical computations. MACKAY (personal communication) has pointed out that one of the ad- vantages of this type of machine over the digital type is the greater eccinomy of effort required to perform approximate qualitative analyses. On the other hand, the analogue method is less efficient as an accurate long-term memory store. The mechanism proposed for the "plastic" changes in the central nervous system, by alteration in maintained levels of excitation in the cells, is adequate for short-term memory but is probably inadequate to account for the accuracy of long-term memory. There seem to be two possibilities which might account for this long-term accuracy. The first is the improve- ment which is achieved by the use of large numbers of cells, so that the effect, so far as the animal as a whole is concerned, is the result of an averaging process. This may be called the statistical stability of the memory process. The second possibility is that the levels of excitation in each cell may react back on its internal chemical state, so that the memory is effectively trans- ferred to a molecular level. It would be possible in this way to stabilize the inherent level of excitation in each cell so that the plastic changes become smaller and smaller in magnitude as the animal ages and the behaviour be- comes correspondingly more fixed. A very small plastic change may suffice, in a mechanism of this sort, to produce alterations in the nature of the pat- terns generated, but the reduction in the capacity to learn which occurs in man as the individual ages may be attributable to some such molecular stabilization in the brain cells. SUMMARY i) The classification of the types of learning in animals given by THORPE (1950) is taken as the starting point for an attempt to formulate in general terms the character- istics of the process. It is suggested that the most general feature of learrXing is the in- crease in complexity of behaviour which results. 2) The concept of complexity, which has hitherto been used by biologists without ,definition, is analysed in terms of the "theory of information" developed in connection with problems of communication engineering. It is ghown that, although it is a purely epistemological concept, it may be applied to descriptions of systems such as the living organism on which verifiable observations can be made. It is applicable to behaviour as well as to structure by a space/time inversion, verifiability consisting in this case of a correspondence between simultaneous observations made on different parts of the -structure, instead of repeatability of observations at successive instants. 3) A short account is given in general terms of the kinetics of evolutionary processes, the mathematical treatment of which (based on the theory of stochastic processes) is .loo difficult for an article of this type. 4)Evolution by natural selection of random variations is the best known example of</page><page sequence="39">2I2 J. W. S. PRINGLE this type of process, but differentiation, treated as the problem of the evolution of a popuilation of "plasmagenes" (SPIEGELMANN, I948), may be another example, and it is suggested that learning is a third example. 5) It is shown that the phenomenon of synchronization of oscillators, the general features of which are described, can lead, in a population of oscillators, to an "evolution- ary" increase of complexity of rhythm in a manner analogous to the increase of structural complexity which occurs in organic evolution. A model is described which is consistent with the known features of the physiology of the central nervous system of animals, and which is capable of producing the increase of complexity found in the process of learning. The oscillators in this model consist of circular chains or "closed loops" of neurons, and it is suggested that such closed loops may generate oscillatory wave-forms more closely resembling the electrical waves found iii the cerebral cortex than the impulses characteristic of peripheral axons. The coupling required to produce synchronization of these oscillators is provided by the sharing of neurons. 6) The asymmetrical inter-relationship between oscillators necessary to produce "selection" results from the non-linearity of the oscillations generated by such a closed- loop arrangement. The "variation" on which selection operates may be provided by "endogenous" variability in the frequencies of the oscillators due to random changes of excitability of the neurons, or may be provided by the variation of the stimulus pattern from outside the animal. These two cases are compared to variation by mutation and by changes in the gene-complex, on either of which natural selection can operate to l)roduce adaptive changes in organic evolution. 7) The types of learning, as defined by THORPE (i95o), are analysed in turn in a schematic manner, and it is shown how each of them is related to the properties of the proposed model. The formation of conditioned reflexes is adequately interpreted, and also the phenomena of external and internal inhibition. The difficulty of "backward conditioning'" also appears to be represented in the properties of the model, being based on the hysteresis effect in the synchronization of non-linear oscillators. 8) Habituation is shown to be an example of the homoeiostatic properties of a closed loop system with negative feed-back. 9) Conditioned reflexes of KONORSKY's Type I (i948) and habituation do not demand any endogenous variability in the frequency of oscillations in the model. Conditioned reflexes of Type II, trial-and-error learning, and insight learning do, however, demand that there shall be some endogenous variability in the nervous system if they are to be interpreted in terms of the properties of this model. io The "memory" of a stimulus pattern, or the plastic change in the nervous systenm resulting from the application of a stimulus, has, in previous theories about the learning process, been considered to involve a change in the synaptic connections be- tween neurons (KONORSKY, i948) or at least a change in "synaptic resistance". It is shown that with this model the requirement is for a change in the maintained level of excitation within certain cells. It is further apparent that no localised changes are to be expected, the memory trace taking the form of a slight change in a large number of cells rather than a large change in any one. This feature of the model is consistent with the observations of LASHLEY (I950) and others that the formation of a conditioned reflex and of other associations is not accompanied by a localised change 'n any part of the cerebral cortex of mammals. The location of the physical events accompanying association w i t h i n the cells of the central nervous system rather than b e t w e e n them introduces the possibility, which is briefly discussed, of a transfer of the events from the level of the neuron down to the level of molecular changes in the substance of the living protoplasm.</page><page sequence="40">THE PARALLEL BETWEEN LEARNING AND EVOLUTION 2I3 LITERATURE ADLER, R.

ZUSAMMENFASSUNG i) THORPES (0950) Einteilung der tierischen Lerntypen dient als Ausgangspunkt fur einen Versuch die Charakteristika des Prozesses in allgemeinen Ausdriicken zu formu- lieren. Als Haupteigentumlichkelt des Lernenis wird die resultierende Erweiterung der Komplexitiit des Verhaltens angesehen. 2) Der Begriff der Komplexitat, der bisher von Biologen ohne Definition gebraucht wurde, wird in Ausdriucken der "Theorie der Information" entwickelt im Zusammenhang mit Problemen der Meldetechnik. Es wird gezeigt, obgleich es ein epistomologischer Begriff ist, dass dieser zur Beschreibung solchen Systeme wie lebenden Organismen angewandt werden kann an denen nachprufbare Beobachtungen gemacht werden konnen. Er ist durch eine Raum-Zeit Inversion auf Verhalten anwendbar und auch auf Struk- tur; die nachpriifbarkeit besteht in diesem Falle in einer Korrespondenz zwischen gleichzeitigen Beobachtungen die an verschiedenen Teilen der Struktur angestellt werden konnen, anstatt einer Wiederholung von Beobachtungen in aufeinanderfolgende Augen- blicken. 3) Ein kurzer Bericht uber die Kinetik der Evolutionsvorgange wird in allgemeinen Ausdriicken gegeben; die mathematische Behandlung (auf der Theorie stochastischer Prozesse basierend) ist zu schwierig fur einen Artikel dieser Art. 4) Evolution durch natiurliche Auslese von Zufallsvariationen ist das best bekannte Beispiel eines solchen Prozess-Types, aber Differenzierung, behandelt als das Problem ,der Evolution einer Gemeinschaft von "Plasmagenen" (SPIEGELMANN, I948), mag ein anderer Beispiel sein, und es wird vorgeschlagen, dass Lernen ein dritter Beispiel ist. 5) Es wird gezeigt, dass das Phiinomen der Synchronisierung von fOszillatoren, deren allgemeine Eigenschaften beschrieben werden, in einer Gemeinschaft von Oszillatorerl zu einer evolutionaren Vergr6sserung der Komplexitat des Rhythmus fiihren kann, in einer Art, die analog der strukturellen Komplexitat ist, wie sie in der organischen Evolution auftritt. Ein Model wird beschrieben, das im Einklang ist mit den bekannten Eigenschaften der Physiologie des Zentralnervensystems der Tiere, und welches fahig ist eine Vergr6sserung der Komplexitat hervorzubringen wie sie im Lernvorgang ange- troffen wird. Die Oszillatoren in diesem Model bestehen in Kreisformig angeordneten Ketten oder "geschlossenen Stromkreise" von Neuronen und es wird unterbreitet, dass solche geschlossenen Stromkreise Wellenformen produzieren konnen, die grossere Ahn- lichkeit mit den elektrischen Wellen haben wie sie in der Grosshirnrinde gefunden werdetn als mit den charakteristischen Impulsen der peripheren Nervenfasern. 6) Die asymmetrischen Beziehungen zwischen Oszillatoren die notwendig sind um Auslese hervorzubringen ist das Resultat der nichtlinearen Eigenschaften der Oszillato- ren produziert durch solche geschlossene Stromkreisanordnung. Die "Variation" auf die die Auslese einwirkt kann gegeben sein durch "endogene" Variabilitat in den Fre- quenzen der Oszillatoren durch Zufallsanderungen der Erregbarkeit der Neuronen, oder sie kann entstehen durch Anderung des Reizmusters ausserhalb des Tieres. Diese beiden Beispiele werden verglichen mit Variation durch Mutation und Anderungen im Genlkom- -plex; durch beide kann natiirliche Auslese operieren um Anpassungsanderungen in der organischen Evolution hervorzubringen. 7) Die Lerntypen wie sie von THORPE (i950) definiert werden werden der Reihe nach schematisch analysiert und es wird gezeigt wie j eder. von ihnen zu dem vorgeschlagenen Model in Beziehung steht. Die Bildung von bedingten Reflexen ist hinreichend gedeutet,</page><page sequence="42">THE PARALLEL BETWEEN LEARNING AND EVOLUTION 2I5 und auch das Phanomen der ausseren und inneren Hemmung. Die Schwerigkeit des 4"ricklaufigen bedingten Reflexen" scheint auch in den Eigenschaften des Models ver- treten zu sein, und ist basiert auf den Hysteresis-Effekt in der Synchronisation nicht- liniearer Oszillatoren. 8) Es wird gezeigt, dass Gewohnung als Beispiel der homeostatischen Eigenschaften eines geschlossenen Stromkreises mit negativen Riickkopplung eingesehen werden kann. 9) Bedingte Reflexe des KONORSKY Typs I (I948) und Gewohnung verlangen keine endogene Variabilitat der Schwingungen im Model. Bedingte Reflexe Typ II, Versuchs- und-Irrtum Lernen und Einsichtslernen setzten jedoch eine endogene Variabilitat im Nervensystem voraus wenn sie durch Eigenschaften dieses Models gedeutet werden. io) Das "Gedichtnis" eines Reizmusters, oder die plastische Anderung im Nervensy- stem durch Anwendung eines Reizes hervorgerufen wurde in fruheren Theorien des Lernvorganges auf eine Anderung in der synaptischen Verbindung zwischen Neuronen basiert (KONORSKY, I948) oder wenigstens auf Anderung des "synaptischen Wider- stands". Es wird gezeigt, dass dieses Model einer Anderung des beibehaltenen Erregung zustandes i n n e r h a 1 b gewissen Zellen bedarf. Es wird weiterhin of fenbar, dass keine lokalisierten Anderungen erwartet werden konnen, da die Gedachtnisspur der geringen Anderulng in einer grossen Anzahl von Zellen und nicht einer grossen Anderung in einer einzelnen entspricht. Diese Eigenschaft des Models ist in Einklang mit den Beob- achtunigen von LASHLEY (1950) und anderen insofern als die Bildung eines bedingten Reflexes und von anderen Assoziationen nicht mit einer lokalisierten Anderung in irgendeinen Teil der Saiigetier-Grosshirnrinde. Der -Ort der physischen Vorgange die die Assoziation i n n e r h a 1 b der Zellen des Zentralnervensystems begleiten und nicht z w i s c h e n ihnen, er6ffnet die M6glichkeit, die kurz besprochen wird, eine tUbertragung der Vorgange vom Niveau der Neuronen hinunter zu dem Niveau molekularer Anderungen in der Substanz des lebendigen Protoplasmas.
