<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Maiakovskii and the Mobile Monument:  Alternatives to Iconoclasm in Russian Culture James Rann But who is he in bronze, who is the moveless one? The poet laughed, It isn’t me. It’s nearly me, but I am free —Edwin Morgan On 28 July 1958, twenty-eight years after Vladimir Maiakovskii’s suicide,  on the Moscow square bearing his name, an imposing statue was unveiled  to “the leading poet of our time.”1 In the dedicatory address, Minister of  Culture Nikolai Mikhailov praised the poet as an opponent of American  imperialism and a friend to the proletariat: “Maiakovskii is fi ghting along- side us for the victory of communism.”2 The poet’s lover Lily Brik, how- ever, expressed doubts about the belligerent, hyper-masculine portrayal  of the poet: “If only you knew what a cry-baby he was.”3 As often with Maia- kovskii, both in his poetry and in his posthumous reception, the image  of the titanic warrior enshrined in the statue conceals a subtler character  riven by confl ict and paradox. Nevertheless, statues can also help us un- derstand this more complex Maiakovskii better: the poet used the motif of  the statue to articulate his attitudes toward the project of building a new  culture after the revolution, often in ways that not only call into question  his reputation as a nihilistic and iconoclastic proponent of destruction  but also prompt a reexamination of the function of iconoclasm in Russian  culture in general. Just as Maiakovskii’s poetic persona is typifi ed by contradiction, the  popular and scholarly response to Maiakovskii’s statues—both poetic and  physical—is marked by a lack of consensus. In reply to Brik’s criticism of  the statue, the poet’s friend Pavel Lavut suggested that it was “better to  have one like this than none at all.”4 Many have since disputed this claim:  Edward Brown sees the statue as an ironic embodiment of the victory  of Maiakovskii’s “lifelong mortal enemy, byt.”5 Krystyna Pomorska agrees,  arguing that “Majakovskij’s attitude to monuments was one of resent- I would like to thank Robin Aizlewood, Andreas Schönle, Mark D.

Jakobson sought to establish that for Pushkin the statue was one of the  “constant organizing, cementing elements which are the vehicle of unity  in the multiplicity of the poet’s works and which [. . .] introduce the total- ity of a poet’s individual mythology.” It is the task of the scholar, he suggests,  to “extract these invariable components or constants directly from the  poetic work.”9 The challenge Jakobson implicitly sets—to perform this  task for Maiakovskii—has never been completed, although worthy con- tributions have been made to this end. This shortfall may have a method- ological explanation: Jakobson’s search for “unity” has been criticized for  imposing illusory coherence on the complexity of a poet’s worldview.10 If  we are willing to accept that contradictions can in fact be foundational to  a poet’s mythology, however, Jakobson’s approach—the “internal, imma- nent analysis” of one motif across a body of work—can shed light on both  Maiakovskii’s individual mythology and its relationship to the complex of  mythologies that constitute culture as a whole, even when this analysis is  not exhaustive.11 In particular, examining Maiakovskii’s statue motif in  terms of iconoclasm can help us better understand the poet’s attitude to  the role of the past in the construction of a new culture, his relationship  to the state, and his own legacy. Recent scholarship has sought to understand iconoclasm, not as  mindless destruction, but as a sophisticated semiotic process: Richard  Clay has proposed that iconoclasm can be understood as “a type of ma- 6.

Maria Rubins has argued that the re- location of a monument into text can in itself be considered an act of  iconoclasm: “While iconographic texts render the signifi er, i.e., the plastic  representation itself, their iconoclastic counterparts fi guratively ‘shatter’  the signifi er, shifting the focus from the artistic representation to the ref- erent.”13 One could add that, once liberated from the signifi er, this refer- ent can acquire new meanings constituted by its changed context. Such  implicit de facto textual iconoclasm is, however, often accompanied by a  self-c onscious engagement with more explicit iconoclastic practices: for  his part, Maiakovskii frequently sought to minimize the distance between  his metaphorical tampering with the statue and actual physical icono- clasm. Consequently, we should locate his historically conscious use of  the statue motif within the historical discourse of iconoclasm in Russia,  which, thanks to the widespread perception of iconoclasm as provoca- tively unnatural, is characterized, much like Maiakovskii’s poetry, by ex- tremity and contradiction. Richard Stites summarizes the situation neatly:  “Iconoclasm seems so very Russian. But so does anti-iconoclasm.”14 Stites’s comment refers to the fl urry of violence against property  in 1917 and the preservation campaigns that it inspired. Maiakovskii’s  poetic career encompassed not only this confl ict but also later debates in  which the question of the destruction or preservation of statues served  as a case in point for arguments about the role of the past in the shap- ing of postrevolutionary culture. Discussions of monuments, therefore,  provided an arena for the playing out of the rivalry between the avant- garde and the government over control of the cultural development of  the nation.15 Monuments, of which statues can be seen as an anthropomorphic sub- set, provide a particularly suitable battleground for this rivalry because  they exist at the intersection of aesthetics and power.16 Erecting a statue  or monument is both expensive and diffi cult and requires control over ur- ban planning; thus this has always been the preserve of those with power,  most often the state. Monuments and statues operate as “visual symbols  12.

Monuments also aspire to control over time by demonstratively monopo- lizing the construction of historical narratives. The primary function of  the monument is ostensibly to commemorate the dead (as a rule this is by  design, and in the long run it is inevitable). They therefore serve as a sort  of life after death and a riposte to the onward march of time: the statue’s  solidity and immobility communicate a rejection of the effects of time and  death. Mikhail Yampolsky has called them “islets of eternity in the move- ment of time.”18 Their invocation of eternity is then used to establish the  past and future continuity of the regime.19 This expression of the temporal continuity and geographic pervasive- ness of power has made monuments important points of reference during  times of political change: studies of 1917 and 1991 have demonstrated  their central role in both spontaneous mass actions and revolutionary  policy in Russia.20 The urge to modify monuments at such moments has  numerous motivations, which change over time, including the desire to  use power’s own means of communication to send a message back and a  sort of theatrical magical thinking in which the fate of a statue is believed  to infl uence the state of the regime it represents.21 The subsequent recon- fi guration of ideological and urban landscapes in the wake of the fall of a  regime is a slow and complex process: statues remain problematic because  their message (both the explicit depiction of a hero of the old order and  the implicit statement of continuity) is visibly at odds with the new politi- cal status quo. Consequently, they become the subject of debates about  how the reshaping of the nation should proceed. The statue moves from  being the center of crowd activity to being the subject of discussions in  newspapers and other media.22 Their function as markers of power has also made statues prominent  17.

(Although Jakobson does not mention it explicitly,  emphasiszng instead the erotic and the domestic, politics are central to  Pushkin’s myth of the statue.)23 The treatment of statues in poetry differs  markedly from their role in revolutionary action because the poet does  not require access to the physical monument to perform acts of icono- clasm. Whereas in times of political stasis the general populace is unable  to alter the statue in any permanent way, poets can enact endless transfor- mations by relocating it in the textual space of their poetry. Ecphrasis of this sort has more often been used as a means of ar- ticulating a relationship with other art forms and other poets than with  the government.24 The futurists with whom Maiakovskii began his career,  however, merged poetic and political discourses in order to express their  radical aesthetics. For example, the injunction of the manifesto “Posh- chechina obshchestvennomu vkusu” (Slap in the Face of Public Taste,  1912)—“Throw Pushkin, Dostoevskii, Tolstoi and so on and so on from  the steamship of Modernity”—has been interpreted as a reference to  Vladimir’s destruction of the pagan idols in Kiev before the imposition  of Christianity on the population: the futurists purge literature of its pa- gan idols so that they can introduce their own one true faith.25 Vladimir’s  iconoclasm remains a byword for total cultural change: in a classic article,  Iurii Lotman and Boris Uspenskii described it as a “decisive milestone in  the consciousness of Old Russia” and a canonical example of a form of  binary thinking about culture that is typifi ed by “a conception of the new  not as a continuation, but as a total eschatological change.”26 Although  Lotman and Uspenskii are careful to limit the historical range of their  analysis to premodern Russia, the binary conception of cultural change  lic statuary in most issues of its short existence during the winter of 1918 and spring of  1919.  23.

This essay has a clear infl u- ence on Gasparov’s reading of “Poshchechina,” in which he describes the futurist Pushkin  as the standard Silver Age Pushkin, with the exception that “they simply attached a minus  sign,” a phrase taken from “Binary Models.” </page> <page sequence="6"> Maiakovskii and the Mobile Monument 771 they identify is clearly one of the infl uences on the futurists’ articulation  of their avant-garde agenda. Vladimir’s destruction of the idols is an instructive example of those  functions of iconoclasm that repeat themselves in conjunction with the  binary discourse. The Primary Chronicle relates how Vladimir “ordered  the overturning of the idols—some to be chopped up, others burned”;  the statue of Perun was cast into the Dnieper, foreshadowing the writers’  expulsion from the steamship. “This was done [. . .] to insult the devil that  had deceived people in this image.” The violence against the statues was  necessary both to galvanize and mark a change in belief: “Yesterday he  was still revered, but today we insult him.” Furthermore, Vladimir built a  church on the former site of the pagan idols, replacing the old, discred- ited iconography with a new system of signs.27 This iconoclasm is moti- vated, therefore, by criticism not only of the referent of the sign—the  pagan deity—but also of its function as a sign—it “deceives” people by  concealing the devil. Similarly, the futurists’ rejection of Pushkin implies  a critique of the fetishization of Pushkin.28 The revolution changed the context of Maiakovskii’s iconoclastic  thinking, both because it offered “unique possibilities” for the complete  remaking of culture and because it presented the futurists with rivals in  this endeavor, most notably the government.29 The Bolsheviks’ willing- ness to align themselves with Vladimirian iconoclasm and, implicitly, the  binary model of cultural change, is clear in Vladimir Lenin’s decree of  12 April 1918, “O pamiatnikakh respubliki,” the fi rst step in his plan for  monumental propaganda, which claims that the revolution has “trans- formed Russia”: “The Soviet of People’s Commissars express the wish that  on 1 May the most hideous idols [istukany] will already have been taken  down and the fi rst models of the new monuments put up for the judg- ment of the masses.”30 The old iconography was to be replaced with a new  one, which differed not only in content but also in form: the new statues  were to be temporary, a choice that has been seen as a rebuke of the tsar- ist monuments’ claim to eternity.31 Nevertheless, this offi cial exploitation  of iconoclastic discourses also operated in tandem with the “anti-icono- clasm” identifi ed by Stites, exemplifi ed by the establishment of the Sec- tion for Museums and Preservation of Monuments within Narkompros.32 Maiakovskii responded both to the government’s usurpation of the  avant-garde’s primacy in cultural affairs and its preservation agenda  27. Povest  vremennykh let, ed. D. S. Likhachev (St. Petersburg, 1999), 190. 28. The Primary Chronicle’s narrative of Vladimir’s overturning of the idol can clearly  be understood within a wider context of Orthodox opprobrium for the statue, motivated  by the church’s interpretation of the Mosaic commandment against graven images as a  prohibition against any depictions except painted icons.  29.

He up- braids the government for the sluggishness of cultural change: А царь Александр на площади Восстаний стоит? Туда динамиты! (But Tsar Aleksandr / is standing / on Uprisings Square? / Send  dynamite!)33 Maiakovskii uses the immobile statue as a symbol for the lingering pres- ence of the old culture in general: Lenin’s plan is clearly not moving fast  enough. He contrasts the statue’s solidity to the dynamism of the revolu- tion, represented in the word vosstanii (uprisings), which not only plays  on the difference between stoiat  (to stand) and vosstat  (to revolt) but  also references the recent renaming of the square from Znamenskaia  Square to Square of the Uprising. Maiakovskii makes this tardiness seem  all the more reprehensible by connecting the cultural struggle to the  civil war; he also invokes Pushkin, perhaps as a reminder of the futurists’  long-standing role in this battle: Выстроили пушки по опушке, глухи к белогвардейской ласке. А почему не атакован Пушкин?  (They have lined up cannons around the edge, / deaf to the affection of  the White Guard. / But why / is Pushkin not attacked?)34 This metaphorical attack on the symbols of monarchism was perceived as  an attack on Bolshevik policy: on Lenin’s instruction, the head of Narkom- pros, Anatolii Lunacharskii, wrote an article for the next issue of Iskusstvo  kommuny that used architectural metaphors to criticize the paper’s “de- structive tendencies.” He argued that “too often in the history of humanity  we have seen how fastidious fashion has promoted something new, while  striving to turn what is old into ruins as quickly as possible,” and claimed  that the avant-garde was trying to usurp the power of the government.35 In  his rebuttal Maiakovskii disparaged the government’s credentials to man- age the development of culture by mocking their literal interpretation of  his imagery.36 33.

This imagery  is evident in Maiakovskii’s poetic response to Lenin’s criticism of his poem  150,000,000 (1920): Ленин медленно подымает вечища Разжимаются губ чугуны Раскатываясь пустотою города гулкова на мрамор цоколя обрушивая вес загрохотали чугунобуково ядра выпадающих пудовых словес. Садитесь товарищ а где-то в уме там: носит чушь такую пороть его видят занят стою монументом за чем только смотрит эта Фотиева.

(Would a secretary and a door bother me / I can crawl even through a  chest. / Radium.)40 In 1924 the decision to embalm Lenin’s dead body seemed to make real  Maiakovskii’s metaphorical petrifaction of Lenin. Maiakovskii saw this  transformation of Lenin into a morbid ersatz monument as a symbol  for the stagnation of revolutionary ideology.41 In a Lef article refused by  the censors, he urges the makers of memorabilia not to “trade in Lenin”  and produces a spoof-advertisement of Lenin busts to ridicule the kitsch  Leniniana that preserved his death, not his life, and that symbolized  Lenin’s instrumentalization and commercialization.42 The language used  in the article echoes his panegyric Vladimir Il  ich Lenin (1924), which  combats the same threats: “Lenin is still our contemporary. He is among  the living. We need him alive, not as a dead man. For that reason: Learn  from Lenin, but don’t canonize him.”43 This rhetoric is further evident in  Maiakovskii’s ”Iubileinoe” ( Jubilee Poem), a poem of the same year ad- dressed to the Pushkin monument in Moscow: Я люблю вас,   но живого,     а не мумию. (I love you, but alive, and not as a mummy.)44 This line is clearly addressed to both Lenin and Pushkin, both of whom  are victims of constrictive ideological readings. Maiakovskii complains, as  he had in 1912, that Pushkin has been transformed into an object of cult  adoration, rather than understood as a “living” person with a fl exible po- etic legacy. The emblem of this fetishization, and counterpart to Lenin’s  mummy, is the monument on Pushkin square in Moscow that was the  center of the cult of Pushkin and the object of ridicule by the futurists.45  Maiakovskii imagines it as a prison: Бояться вам рожна какого? Что против—Пушкину иметь? Его кулак навек закован в спокойную к обиде медь! 40. Maiakovskii, PSS, 4:305.  41. See Maiakovskii, PSS, 6:252, for Maiakovskii’s similar concerns about Karl Marx. 42.

In response to the alleged nihilistic anti-traditional- ism of Proletkul t and the futurists, Lunacharskii promoted the necessity  of continuity in Russian literature, especially in 1923’s “Back to the Clas- sics” campaign and the Pushkin Jubilee of 1924.49 Lunacharskii argued  that Pushkin should occupy a central place in the new culture, at the ex- pense of the avant-garde, not only because of his work’s technical virtues  but also because of its “emotional and ideological content,” which was “of  value to all humanity.”50 He implied that Pushkin had defeated the avant- garde: “Even the most turbulent futurist fi gures are now bowing down  before him.”51 Maiakovskii is said to talk about him “with reverence”—an  allusion to a speech the poet made on 26 May 1924 in which he spoke  fondly of Pushkin and seemingly stated his approval of the use of the  classics as the basis for the new art, proposing that “we will return hun- dreds of times to such works of art and study them.” Maiakovskii’s surpris- ing tenderness may be motivated by the fact that 26 May was Pushkin’s  birthday according to the old Julian calendar. Maiakovskii later felt com- pelled to distance himself from this position and so revised the printed  version of this address, adding the proviso that “this is in no way similar to  the slogan ‘Back to Pushkin.’ My attitude to this question is in my poem  ‘Iubileinoe.’”52  46.

The Pushkin he chooses to represent, however, is very  different from that of the Pushkin cult or Lunacharskii’s speeches: he  emphasizes his unusual racial origin, his irreverence, and his quasi- futurist love of wordplay.53 Moreover, rather than treat him as a teacher,  Maiakovskii speaks to him as an equal, makes him his pupil, and forces  him to abandon iambic meter and work in agitprop. He militates against  the notion of Pushkin as a link between the culture of the past and the  present: if there is any commonality between Pushkin and the present,  it is because Pushkin can be made modern, not that modernity can be  made Pushkinian. Maiakovskii explained his approach using monumental  imagery: “My poem dedicated to Pushkin is a way of shaking up Pushkin  the Academician and of constructing the sort of Pushkin that a person  with a certain revolutionary enthusiasm can talk about like he was his  poet. . . . We are using not a harness, but a means of steering [povorachi- vaniia] the monument in order to be able to still talk to this Pushkin.”54  This metaphorical “steering” is made literal in the course of the poem:  as he discusses love and pillories his contemporaries, Maiakovskii leads  the Pushkin statue through the Moscow night, before returning him to  his pedestal at daybreak. The statue’s freedom of movement symbolizes  the fl exible literary inheritance that Maiakovskii thinks should consti- tute Pushkin’s contribution to culture. This self-refl exive mobilization  of Pushkin is not only an emblem of the greater fl exibility Maiakovskii  proposes for the reception of Pushkin but an example of it, because,  rather than reiterating his mythology Maiakovskii reverses the polarity of  Pushkin’s binary; as Jakobson observed, “the motif of the forced, impris- oning immobility of a statue, polemically opposed to Pushkin’s myth of  its sovereign rest, acquires particular vigor in Maiakovskii.”55 While Push- kin considers the mobile statue demonic, Maiakovskii sees immobility as  unnatural. The ambulant Pushkin statue can be seen as party to a broader avant- garde attitude to monuments that strove to reconcile the need to com- memorate the revolution (and construct a prehistory for the revolutionary  state) with a distaste for lifeless monumentalism. Movement was presented  as one solution to this impasse: Nikolai Punin in Iskusstvo kommuny argued  that monuments should be places of “the most intense movement” and  nominated as an example Vladimir Tatlin’s proposed monument to the  Third International, which includes numerous different rotating sections  53. For the importance of Pushkin’s irreverence in Russian modernism, see Greta N.  Slobin, “Appropriating the Irreverent Pushkin,” in Gasparov, Hughes, and Paperno, eds.,  Cultural Mythologies, 214 –30. Maiakovskii’s emphasis on Pushkin’s irreverent qualities may  well have been inspired by similar remarks in Sergei Esenin’s address to the Pushkin statue,  written before Maiakovskii’s in 1924.

He fi rst expressed these fears in the play Vladimir Maiakovskii:  Tragediia (1913), originally titled Bunt veshchei (The Revolt of Things),  which draws parallels between social unrest and an ontological revolu- tion in which inanimate objects begin to move: “i vdrug / vse veshchi /  kinulis ” (and suddenly / all the objects / fl ew about). Katherine Lahti  argues that this movement has been initiated by a giant woman, who be- strides the city: “Nad gorodom / —gde fl iugerov drevki— / zhenshchina /  —chernye peshchery vek— / mechetsia” (Above the city / —where there  are the poles of the weather vanes— / a woman / —black caves of eye- lids— / is rushing).60 The woman appears on stage, however, as a giant  56.

Her immobil- ity is exacerbated by the fact that the crowds attempt to set her up as a  monument to the revolution: “na chernom granite grekha i proroka /  postavim pamiatnik krasomu miasu” (on the black granite of sin and vice /  we will put up a monument to red meat).61 Maiakovskii implicitly criticizes the “desire to raise a monument instead  of continuing the fury of the carnival whose fantasies really did turn the  world upside down.”62 This is typical of Maiakovskii’s scathing depictions  of postrevolutionary utopias, in which the new order is usually inferior to  the revolution that has created it, as in Klop, Piatyi internatsional, and Che- lovek. In Tragediia the poet himself becomes monumentalized—he wears  the laurel wreath and toga of the Parnassian poet—but fi nds the new  world “boring,” which points to Maiakovskii’s suspicions of the limitations  of monumental commemoration, a theme we will explore later.63 Tragediia’s transformative rebellion through animation provides a  blueprint for an attitude to the culture of the past that is evident in “Iubilei- noe” and “Posledniaia peterburgskaia skazka” (The Last Petersburg Fairy  Tale, 1916). The latter is a parody of Pushkin’s Mednyi vsadnik (Bronze  Horseman, 1833) in which Peter, the Bronze Horseman, leaves his pedes- tal because he is envious of diners at the newly restored Astoria Hotel. He  slinks off to join them, accompanied by the horse and the snake, which  also comprise the monument, but fails to fi nd a place in modern society  and returns shamefaced. In Tragediia, “Iubileinoe,” and “Posledniaia peterburgskaia skazka”  Maiakovskii pursues a strategy from outside the binary iconoclastic tradi- tion: instead of destroying the statue as an embodiment of the past he  experiments with mobilizing it, letting it wander free to fi nd a place in  modern society. Thus we see the Bronze Horseman in a restaurant and  Pushkin in an agitprop department. Despite Maiakovskii’s criticisms of the offi cial jubilee, his instrumen- tal approach—in which Pushkin is reimagined to suit his needs—shows  affi nities with Pushkin’s appropriation by the Soviet state. Both poet and  party hope to “steer” Pushkin in order to make him into a sort of usable  past that can help them build a new culture.64 What is more, they both  do so by manipulating the Pushkin monument: in 1936 the inscription  on the monument was changed slightly to suit the offi cial understanding  of Pushkin as a champion of freedom; in 1950 the statue was moved to  the other side of the square, perhaps to erase memories of the monastery  that had once stood there.65 The monument continued to function as a  61.

Although these interventions occurred after Maiakovskii’s death, such  manipulative preservation was evident in early Soviet policy: for example,  Lenin ordered that the names of famous radicals be inscribed on the  monument to the quatercentenary of the Romanov dynasty. As before,  the obelisk symbolized historical continuity, but now it represented the  continuity of socialist values.66 Moreover, many statues, including that of  Alexander III, were relocated to museums, an act that also constitutes a  tacit transformation of the statue as sign: by reducing it to its aesthetic  or historic qualities, the museum context seemingly nullifi es the mon- ument’s symbolism. “Museumifi cation” is in itself a highly symbolic act,  however: the diminution of the statue to a purely aesthetic object enacts  the triumph of the new ideological masters, who display these defunct  monuments like the trophies of a defeated vassal-state.67 Thus the statue  remains a vehicle for the self-expression of state power. Despite the fact that both the Soviet state and the poet move and alter  statues to their own ends, there are essential differences between their  approaches. Maiakovskii may liberate Pushkin to serve his agenda, but he  also makes a wider point about the nature of cultural inheritance—our  perception of the artefacts and texts of the past is necessarily conditioned  by their present context. In contrast, the Soviet co-option of Pushkin  sought a defi nitive recasting of the poet as a proto-Soviet radical and  democrat as part of an attempt to limit the fl exibility of culture. What is  more, in order to advocate his contingent approach to the culture of the  past, Maiakovskii makes his manipulation of Pushkin extremely obvious;  the Soviet reimagining of Pushkin, on the other hand, is either unspo- ken or presented as entirely natural. Maiakovskii announces that Pushkin  now works in propaganda; the government appoints him to this role in  secret. Of course, the major difference between the state and the poet is  that the state is capable of actual physical relocation, while the poet can  only recontextualize with words. Yet it is precisely this textual element  to Maiakovskii’s iconoclasm that gives it subversive power. What is more,  by establishing parallels with more modern examples, by mobilizing the  monument, Maiakovskii draws attention to an inherent truth about the  interaction between literature and power in the landscape. There is common ground between this reimagining of the monument  in text and image and the well-established notion that “the meaning of  a text, landscape, or monument is always polymorphous and dependent  on multiply situated readers. The ability of the state or political elites to  66. Lodder, “Lenin’s Plan,” 23. 67. This “museumifi cation” anticipates the creation of “sculpture parks” for commu- nist statuary in the 1990s. See Fabio Rambelli and Eric Reinders, “What Does Iconoclasm  Create? What Does Preservation Destroy? Refl ections on Iconoclasm in East Asia,” in Bold- rick and Clay, eds., Iconoclasm, 15–35. In their typology of iconoclasm the authors defi ne  this sort of recontextualization as “negative cultural redefi nition” in which “the object is  preserved intact, and even highly visible, but redefi ned by its displacement into a new and  secular context in which the agents aim to give it a clearly negative connotation” (21). </page> <page sequence="15"> 780 Slavic Review impose their intended reading on an audience is limited by the active  role readers play in the creation of meaning.”68 Like Maiakovskii’s mobi- lization of Pushkin, such popular reinterpretation of monuments works  against the iconoclastic binary. Polly Jones has shown that in 1991 there  was “a consensus against both iconoclasm and idolatry in the treatment  of the public symbolism of the defunct Soviet state” that “concentrated  upon redefi nition and rereading [and] eschewed both narrowly ideologi- cal readings and neo-Bolshevik iconoclasm, proposing instead that Soviet  iconography—once rendered less fearsome by physical and conceptual  dislocation—would provide sites in which to rework and rewrite history  and the aesthetic and social legacy of communism.”69 Jones’s notion of  “physical and conceptual dislocation” rehearses Maiakovskii’s mobiliza- tion of both the statue’s physical manifestation and its symbolic meaning  in order to make it usable in the present. Yet, although the urban landscape surely does function as a text that  can be interpreted in various ways, this text is written and published by  those in power. What is more, the multivalent monument created in re- ception is necessarily ephemeral: while viewers’ interpretations may have  some durability in urban legend and anecdote, this is too insecure a base  from which to undermine offi cial interpretations of the space of the city.70  Likewise, attempts by artists to make physical alterations to statues in or- der to subvert offi cial monumental narratives tend to founder because  lack of control over space means that such interventions must either be  very short-lived or confi ned to periods of political instability.71 Temporary interventions and popular interpretations can only aspire  to the same permanence as the monuments they transform when they  are granted longevity by attaining the status of art, typically when pho- tographic and art historical accounts preserve the altered monument in  books and galleries. In many instances this double r econtextualization— the addition of new features or contexts to the monument by an artist  and the new location of text or gallery—takes place without contact with  the monument. In 1993 the pioneers of Sots Art, Komar and Melamid,  launched Monumental Propaganda, a project in which artists were invited  to enter into “a creative collaboration” with communist statues by fi nd- ing ways “to leave them at their sites and transform them, through art,  into history lessons.”72 These transformations often took creative advan- tage of the impossibility of their realization to design outlandish frames  that could rid the monuments of their imposing aura by juxtaposing their  grandiose solemnity either with the everyday realities of post-Soviet life or  with a postmodernist artist’s playful imaginings. One can see clear parallels between this project and Maiakovskii’s de- 68. Forest and Johnson, “Unraveling the Threads,” 538. 69. Jones, “‘Idols in Stone,’” 248. 70.

In “Iubileinoe” and “Posledniaia peterburgskaia skazka” Maiakovskii em- phasizes the fact that the animation of the statue is only temporary. Like  the archetypal poet Orpheus, Maiakovskii can make objects come alive, but  only in the carnivalesque space of his text.73 The limitation of this move- ment to the poem underlines the fact that the poet’s complete control  over this domain has no impact on the actual urban space, just as Komar  and Melamid are unable physically to transform monuments. Nonethe- less, this disadvantage is turned into a triumph because confi nement to  the aesthetic space ensures that the artist’s transformation of the statue  becomes, in a sense, more permanent than the statue itself, because it is  reproducible; it becomes a Horatian “monumentum aere perennius.” The subversive effect of these recontextualized monuments is further  evident in the way they challenge the process of museumifi cation de- scribed above. Although the direction of the movement—from the street  to the gallery—seems very similar, there is an important difference: while  museumifi cation moves the statue in order to aestheticize and neutralize  it, Maiakovskii and the artists of Monumental Propaganda use the space of  the gallery and the book to politicize the monument. This politicization  is made possible by depicting a scenario in which aesthetic space is pro- jected onto the statue in such a way as to draw attention, not to the statue’s  aesthetic form, but to its political meaning.74 In this way, the artistic re- contextualization of the monument represents a truly avant-garde gesture  because it breaks art out of the confi nes of the gallery (albeit fi guratively)  and uses aesthetic means to try to transform the world. A further aspect of the transformative potential expressed by the re- contextualized monument is the ostentatious demonstration of the fact  that moving a sign into a new context engenders new meaning.75 This  concept was important in linguistic theory in early twentieth-century Rus- sia, in the works of Aleksandr Potebnia, the formalists, and Valentin Vo- loshinov.76 Potebnia argued that “one and the same word is understood  differently by everyone; here we see the relative immobility of the image  73. This emphasis on the abilities of text vis-à-vis other art forms aligns Maiakovskii’s  moving statues with a long tradition of descriptions of impossible ecphrasis in poetry in  which stationary works of art are described as if moving: text can both counteract and  highlight a mimetic shortcoming of fi gurative art—its failure to replicate movement. 74. For instance, Komar and Melamid imagine a noose around the neck of the statue  of Feliks Dzerzhinskii, an aesthetic change that draws attention to the political connota- tions of the statue, not to its form. 75.  See Iu. N. Tynianov, “O parodii,” Poetika. Istoriia literatury. Kino (Moscow, 1977),  294: “All methods of parodying, without exception, consist of the changing of a literary  work or of a moment, which unites a range of works (an author, an almanac, a magazine)  or the changing of a range of literary works (a genre)—as a system, in the translation of  them into another system.” 76.

Titunik (Cambridge, Mass.,  1986). </page> <page sequence="17"> 782 Slavic Review together with variability in content.”77 Maiakovskii unknowingly extends  Potebnia’s immobility metaphor in Tragediia, in which objects reject not  only immobility but also the semiotic fi xity of their “worn-out names”: “vse  veshchi / kinulis  / razdiraia golos, / skidyvat  lokhmot ia iznoshennykh  imen (all the objects / started fl ying about / tearing apart their voice /  throwing off the rags of worn-out names). The poet draws a parallel be- tween the liberation of immobile objects and the emancipation of the  word.78 In “Posledniaia peterburgskaia skazka,” Peter is laughed out of  the restaurant because the horse mistakes a pack of straws for straw, even  though semantic confusion is more plausible here than visual. The poet  critiques the hegemony of empty verbal tags by drawing attention to dou- ble meanings and highlighting the importance of context. Such linguistic  games point to the importance of the textual existence of Maiakovskii’s  statues. The analogy between words and objects is particularly close in the case  of statues and quotations: just as a statue can function as a fi gurehead for a  whole city, so a quotation has, alongside its own content, a connotative role  as a representative for the text as a whole; furthermore, both quotations  and statues have a tendency to hide in plain sight, being so ubiquitous that  their actual meaning becomes lost. Maiakovskii treats statues and quotations  as equivalent, fi nding new contexts for them, not to rehabilitate their lost  meanings but to fl aunt his own ability to fi ll the empty semiotic carapace of  both word and monument. He opens “Posledniaia peterburgskaia skazka”  with quotations from Pushkin’s Mednyi vsadnik that acquire bathetic new  meaning by transforming Pushkin’s demiurge into a peckish diner: we see  him fi rst in a seemingly dramatic pose—“Stoit imperator Petr Velikii, / du- maet ‘Zapiruiu na prostore ia!’” (Emperor Peter the Great stands there, /  thinks “I will feast in the open space”)—which recalls Pushkin’s heroic   Peter— “Stoial on, dum velikikh poln / [. . .] Vse fl agi v gosti budut k nam, /  I zapiruem na prostore!” (He stood, full of great thoughts / [. . .] All fl ags  will come as guests to us / And we will feast in the open space!).79 Now,  however, his ambition amounts only to a good meal. In “Iubileinoe” Maiakovskii misquotes a famous section of Evgenii  Onegin (1833): Как это   у вас     говаривала Ольга . . . ?. Да не Ольга!   из письма     Онегина к Татьяне. 77. A. A.

(What was it you had Ol ga say . . . ? / No, not Ol ga, it’s from Onegin’s  letter to Tat iana. / Something like, “Your husband is a fool and an old  gelding, / I love you, you must be mine / and right now I, this morning,  must be certain / that I will see you in the day.”)80 This misquotation exemplifi es the way in which Maiakovskii promotes an  image of himself as an uncultured semi-hooligan. It also hyperbolically  demonstrates the idea that every instance of quotation is in itself a new  communication. Just as his recontextualization of the statue anticipates  the approaches of Komar and Melamid, this reinterpretation of Push- kin quotations foreshadows the way Sots Art artists exposed the vacuity of  Soviet ideology by quoting slogans in their paintings.81 Despite these similarities, which suggest continuities between mod- ernism and postmodernism, there are notable differences. Komar and  Melamid openly constructed their creative engagement with monuments  as a riposte to Vladimir’s iconoclasm: they wrote to President Boris El tsin  with the plea, wondering, “How long will people continue worshipping or  destroying things, never knowing any other alternative?”82 Their adaptive  preservation has been rightly understood as an act of “countermemory,”  which attempts to “unveil or expose the initial events of the construction  of monumental history and its subsequent effects [which] involves break- ing the claim of permanence by giving voice to, and somehow embodying,  historical change.”83 While Maiakovskii also provides an alternative to the  binary discourse of veneration and annihilation, his position is compli- cated by his desire both to maintain the avant-garde myth of the pos- sibility of ex nihilo creation, which is incompatible with the notion that  the new is merely a reworking of the old, and to promote his own privi- leged position in the new culture. Thus, while eschewing veneration, he  maintains the right to destroy that which he believes cannot be appropri- ated, establishing himself as a sort of discriminating cultural gatekeeper.  For example, in “Shutka pokhozhaia na pravdu” (A Joke Resembling the  Truth, 1929), written in support of the campaign for the demolition of  the Strastnoi monastery, he compares the monastery to its neighbor, the  Pushkin monument, echoing many of the tropes of constriction detailed  80.

Yet it is not being a statue that frus- trates Pushkin but the fact that the monastery prevents him from walking  over to join forces with the Soviet press: “‘Izvestiiam’ Pushkina Strastnoi  zaslonil” (Strastnoi has blocked off Pushkin from Izvestiia).84 While the  monastery is negatively characterized as motionless, the implication is  that the statue can move: the distance between them is measured out  in steps. Pushkin shows that he is capable of the mobility in the physical  landscape that comes from fl exibility in the ideological landscape. The al- legedly alien presence of the Orthodox Church, however, is not so pliable  and thus must be destroyed. The sign cannot be rewritten, so it must be  erased. Maiakovskii’s last work, the play Moskva gorit (Moscow Burns, 1930)  points to further exceptions to the possibility for appropriation. Push- kin is again repurposed positively: a revolutionary climbs his monument  and uses it as a podium for his call to arms.85 Not all statues are accept- able, however. A screen shows enchained (zakovannye) workers breaking  free; their liberation is paralleled by the statues of the tsars and the stone  Romanov eagles coming to life.86 The workers shoot one of the eagles,  however, and lead the herd of equestrian statues off to an unknown fate.87  Although the revolution has made everything come to life, animation is  not enough to guarantee a place in the new society. Moskva gorit shows considerable similarities to the contemporaneous  “Vo ves  golos” (At the Top of My Voice), a poem that, in the light of  Maiakovskii’s suicide soon after, has been read as a fi nal bid to shape  his legacy and articulate his relationship with Soviet power.88 This coinci- dence of commemoration and power naturally suggests an engagement  with monuments and “Vo ves  golos” does indeed represent the culmina- tion of Maiakovskii’s interest in his own potential monument. Pomorska argues that Maiakovskii was obsessed with immortality, dif- ferent forms of which he interrogated, and found wanting, in his poetry.89  His explicit statements about the immortality offered by physical monu- ments are dismissive and often invoke the binary discourse of iconoclastic  destruction, as in “Iubileinoe”: 84. Maiakovskii, PSS, 9:249.  85. Ibid., 11:366. 86. The use of fi lm here, and Maiakovskii’s well-documented passion for fi lm in  general, accord with his philosophy of mobility—the fi lm director can, even more than  the poet, imbue static images with motion.

(I am due a monument during my lifetime according to rank. / I would  lay dynamite—there you go, / kersplat!)90 Yet we also see evidence of the importance of mobilization as a means  of commemorating without imposing stagnation: in “Tovarishchu Nette”  (Comrade Nette, 1926) he proposes that in order to avoid the taint of  death his monument should resemble the ship named after murdered  Soviet ambassador Teodor Nette: Мы идем   сквозь револьверный лай, чтобы,   умирая,     воплотиться в пароходы,   в строчки     и в другие долгие дела. (We go through the barking of revolvers / in order to, when we die, be  incarnated / in steamships, in verses and in other long things.)91 Just as in “Iubileinoe” Pushkin is granted new energy in the space of  Maiakovskii’s poetry, here Maiakovskii hopes to be transformed into verse,  which is characterized as durable, useful, and mobile. Maiakovskii alludes  to the superior commemorative power of text in “Iubileinoe”: Скоро вот   и я     умру       и буду нем.

Pomorska has identifi ed this poem as part of a trilogy, including “Iubileinoe” and “Sergeiu  Eseninu,” in which the poet contemplates “the form of energy into which each man was  transformed after the earthly form of energy was no more”; compare Mikhail Weiskopf,  Vo ves  logos: Religiia Maiakovskogo ( Jerusalem, 1997), 109n88: “At the same time, so it seems  to me, Maiakovskii’s (baroque-futurist) enmity to monuments was by no means that ir- reconcilable and was corrected by the materialist mystique of the palpable-substantive  commemoration of heroes.”  </page> <page sequence="21"> 786 Slavic Review (So soon even I will die and will be dumb. / After death we are to stand  almost next to each other: / you under Pee, and I under eM.)92 He sets up the expectation of a physical monument—the two poets will  stand next to each other and Maiakovskii will be “dumb”—but they will  actually be neighbors on the bookshelf. In “Vo ves  golos” Maiakovskii purports to address his descendants  directly—there is no need for the bespectacled scholars of the future  to root through the “fossilized shit” of the past.93 Maiakovskii plays with  the well-established trope of poetry as self-fulfi lling prophecy—the poem  being read both describes and guarantees the immortality of its author.  Text will guarantee his ability to move into modernity: “ia shagnu cherez  liricheskie tomiki / kak zhivoi / s zhivymi govoria” (I will stride through  lyrical little tomes, / like the living talking to the living).94 Mikhail Weis- kopf has argued that Maiakovskii’s argument for the superiority of text is  based on eighteenth-century discourses that contrasted the monument  negatively to intangible values; this infl uence, modifi ed by Maiakovskii’s  fl amboyant hooliganism, is clear in “Vo ves  golos,” in which he places the  collective achievement of socialism above everything:95 Мне наплевать   на бронзы многопудье, мне наплевать   на мраморную слизь. Сочтемся славою -   ведь мы свои же люди, - пускай нам   общим памятником будет построенный   в боях     социализм. (I spit on the heavy weight of bronze, / I spit on the slime of marble. /  Let’s settle up with glory— after all we are amongst our own here— / let  our communal monument be socialism, / built in battles.)96 Weiskopf locates this gesture within the Horatian tradition but suggests  that his intangible monument is heir, not to Pushkin’s famous “monu- ment not made by human hand,” but to that of his predecessor Gavrila  Derzhavin, because, unlike Pushkin, he embraces the poet’s offi cial du- ties.97 At the end of the poem, Maiakovskii confl ates the two intangible  monuments relevant to the roles of revolutionary and poet—respectively,  socialism and text—by realizing the metaphor of text as monument, em- phasizing the physical aspect of his literary legacy: 92.

(Above a band of poetic graspers and rogues, / I lift, like a Bolshe- vik party membership document, / all hundred volumes of my party-  oriented books.)98 The identifi cation of intangible monuments and poetry in the service of  an idea is strengthened by a negative connection between physical monu- ments and apolitical poetry. Maiakovskii argues that erotic verse would  have been more profi table for him but would have endangered Russia: Неважная честь,   чтоб из этаких роз мои изваяния высились   по скверам,     где харкает туберкулез, где б . . . с хулиганом   да сифилис. (It would be a trifl ing honor, to have from such roses / my sculptures  rise up around squares where tuberculosis hacks up, / where there is a  w[hore] with a hooligan, and syphilis.)99 The poet exploits the ambiguity of the metaphors surrounding monu- ments and poems: his “sculptures” could represent both his poems “made  of such roses” (a shorthand for love poetry) and the statues of the poet  that would loom over these benighted city squares.100 Unlike his predecessors, though, Maiakovskii’s condemnation of the  tangible monument coexists with praise of metaphorical solidity: Мой стих   трудом     громаду лет прорвет и явится   весомо,     грубо,       зримо, как в наши дни   вошел водопровод, 98. Maiakovskii, PSS, 10:285. 99. Ibid., 10:281. 100.

(My verse will break through the enormity of years of hard work / and  appear, heavy, rough, visible, / like a water pipe worked by the slaves of  Rome entered into our days.)101 Maiakovskii’s water pipe inverts specifi c aspects of the Pushkinian monu- ment: its weight is aimed against Pushkin’s famous “lightness”; whereas the  latter is “not made by human hand,” the former is handmade by Roman  slaves, alluding to the Latin origin of this motif and echoing the commu- nally constructed proletarian project of socialism.102 The transformation of Pushkin’s mystical and religious monument into  a functional water pipe represents a further manipulation of the monu- ment as sign: Pushkin’s monument (both as an image and as a metaphor  for his poetry) is press-ganged into utilitarian service. This transforma- tion not only symbolizes Maiakovskii’s appropriation of Pushkin but also  echoes the common Soviet practice of putting formerly sacred spaces to  practical use: water imagery is used in this poem to describe the revolu- tion, so the water pipe of poetry becomes an aqueduct for agitprop.103 Maiakovskii further likens his verse to soldiers and weapons, drawing  parallels between his poetry and the fallen of the civil war.104 On the one  hand, he seems to be referencing his pugnacious revolutionary persona,  equating his verse to military struggle and aligning his commemoration  with that of the Red Army martyrs.105 On the other, in light of his immi- nent death, the poem’s posthumous perspective and emphasis on self- sacrifi ce have led critics to look beyond the bombast to see a complex  meditation on Maiakovskii’s relationship to Soviet power and its impact  on his life and death: Svetlana Boym describes the poem as an investiga- tion into “the tension between appropriating the revolution and being  appropriated by it.”106 Despite the differences he has stressed between  textual and physical monuments, Maiakovskii seems to imply that both  literary and monumental immortality are contingent on death, as part  of what Boym identifi es as his myth of the self-sacrifi cing revolutionary  poet.107 Although Maiakovskii’s performance of self-suppression has also  101.

Maiakovskii combines the two confl icts running through the poem— physical monuments against text, submission to the state against free- dom—in the famous description of his self-disciplining turn to political  verse: Но я   себя the landscape: “—Prokhozhii! / Eto ulitsa Zhukovskogo? [. . .] ‘Ona—Maiakovskogo  tysachi let: / on zdes  zastrelilsia u dveri liubimoi’” (Passer-by! / Is this Zhukovskii street?

(But I have been pacifying myself, standing / on the throat of my own  song.)114 In Maiakovskii the image of the oppressive foot on the throat originates  as a symbol for the cultural inert ia inherent in statuary. For example,  “Manifest letuchei federatsii futuristov” (Manifesto of the Flying Federa- tion of Futurists, 1918) shares the dissatisfaction of “Radovat sia rano”  at the continued presence of monarchist statues: “as before, the monu- ments of generals and princes—the lovers of the tsars and the lovers of  the tsaritsas—are still standing on the throats of the young streets with a  heavy, dirty foot.”115 A further variation on the image appears in a draft  version for 150,000,000: “To be a bourgeois does not mean to own capital  or squander gold. It means to be the heel of a corpse on the throat of  the young.”116 (Here the statue is replaced by another immobile body,  the corpse.) The image is fi rst used in 1913 in “Dva Chekhova” (Two Che- khovs), an attack on moralistic attitudes to the classics. Recounting the  time a member of a provincial audience described Pushkin as a “boss,”  Maiakovskii emphasizes that “It is against this that the young are fi ght- ing, against this bureaucratization, against this canonization of the writer-  enlighteners who with the heavy bronze of monuments are stepping on  the throat of the new verbal art which is freeing itself.”117 The implication  that monumental commemoration indicates the transformation of the  poet into a bureaucrat is repeated in “Iubileinoe”: it is Maiakovskii’s pu- tative rank (chin) that entitles him to a monument. Physical monuments  commemorate obedient bureaucrats and a poet having a statue indicates  that he has become an obstacle to the revolutionary development of cul- ture. Maiakovskii is pictured impeding both the poets of the future and  himself. This vision of a barren, bureaucratic Maiakovskii anticipated his even- tual canonization as the patron saint of Soviet poetry, an appropriation  made aptly palpable in the statue on Maiakovskii Square ( just up the road,  as he predicted, from Pushkin’s monument). As we have seen, however,  monuments can be liberated from the straitjacket of offi cial interpreta- tions, not only by multifarious popular reception, but by the use of the  aesthetic sphere as a space in which to make a lasting adaptation of the  monument that counteracts offi cial narratives.

The cycle repeats: the afterword to the 1990 edition  (signifi cantly entitled “Shall We Throw Maiakovskii from the Steamship  of Modernity?”) suggests that Karabchievskii “struggles not so much with  Maiakovskii . . . as with his monument.” 121  118.
