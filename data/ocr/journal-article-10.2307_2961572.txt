<plain_text><page sequence="1">MEASURING THE EFFECT OF A SOCIAL FORCE' W. G. BINNEWIES Colorado State Teachers College, Greeley, Colorado For some time there has been some controversy in the public mind concerning the influence of certain courses of higher edu- cation upon the religious concepts of young people. Modern education has been accused by some of "destroying the religion of our youth." By others it is hailed as the "truth which shall make ye free." There are thus two extremes of religious opinion. The one holding the fundamental, orthodox views of the early church in which the anthropomorphic concepts of a God made after our own image predominate, and the other, discarding these notions, holding that many attributes of the Divine Power are impossible and that the rest can be explained by the natural laws of science. Between these two views which we will call the orthodox and the agnostic is found a range of fairly fixed opin- ions which can be quite definitely located. Religious opinion is based upon certain fundamental con- cepts about which persons in all walks of life have a fairly defin- ite notion. Such words as God, sin, prayer, Heaven, creation, and soul are common and beliefs concerning them are fairly definite in the mind of any one individual, though they may vary considerably between different individuals. We also find as part of our mores a system of education meas- ured by years and ranging from the simple and elementary up through high school and college where it becomes what we call "higher" education. The controversy in question is whether or not this higher education as provided in our colleges conditions the religious thinking of those exposed to it, and if so to what extent. 1 Much of the data are taken from an unpublished master's thesis: Investigation of Influence of Higher Education Upon Religious Concepts, by Ramona S. Hibbs, Colo- rado State Teachers College, 193I.</page><page sequence="2">84 The Journal of Educational Sociology Accepting the definition of a force as that which produces a change, education may be conceived as a social force producing a social change. Certain kinds of education then, acting upon society, may produce certain kinds of changes in the religious concepts of that society. The courses in our colleges which would most definitely influence religious thinking are anthropology, biology, geology, philosophy, psychology, and sociology. To these may be added astronomy, chemistry, and physics. Our problem may now be stated thus: What has been the influence of higher education which includes the above courses upon the religious thinking of the students taking such courses? Procedure: The first step was to interview many people of differing educational status, vocations, and interests. From these interviews it was learned that the diverse views and religious beliefs centered around certain common concepts and that each individual's beliefs were fairly definite in his own mind. The most common concepts were: God, prayer, Bible, Jesus Christ, creation, and immortality. Since the data sought had to be derived from a large and varied field the questionnaire was resorted to. This was arranged in the form of questions on each concept so placed that thev formed a scale of interpretations ranging from the most nai ve and orthodox to the most unorthodox and atheistic. In order to maintain uniformity, five questions were asked concerning each concept. Each question thus indicates a step or interval in the belief of each individual and the numerical number of the step may be assumed as a measure of the distance from the naYve. In other words, each set of questions becomes a scale upon which is located the belief or opinion held. Accompanying these scales was a blank in which the age, sex, major, year in school, church preference, credit hours in anthro- pology, biology, geology, philosophy, psychology, and sociol- ogy were asked for. The scales were first submitted to the local</page><page sequence="3">Measuring the Effect of a Social Force 85 ministerial association to determine their accuracy and validity. After revision, they were submitted to three professors of Eng- lish for clarity of expression and ambiguous terms. The final revision was then tested upon a nonselected group whose ages and educational status were comparable to those to whom the questions were to be sent. This group gave indications that the technique was practical. After previously securing the cooperation of teachers of soci- ology in colleges, universities, and high schools by means of letters of explanation, the questionnaires were distributed. The replies, numbering 573, could easily be cast into three groups as follows: (i) collegiate, those received from State univer- sities, State agricultural colleges, teachers colleges, and private colleges. These numbered 425. (2) Those received from high schools, mostly from the senior class; 95 were received. (3) A noncollegiate group numbering 53. These were factory work- ers, store clerks, and farm laborers who were of college age but had not had more than high-school training. Replies were received from eleven States and thirteen different institutions. The following tables list the number of replies to each ques- tion by groups and the average number of total student hours in anthropology, biology, geology, psychology, philosophy, and sociology. These, of course, apply only to the collegiate group. TABLE I Concepts of God AVERAGE HOURS IN NUMBER OF REPLIES COLLEGE Noncollege High School College SUBJECTS I.

In all the concepts this correlation is exceptionally significant and shows that the students took the questions seri- ously and were conscientious in their answers. This conclusion is further confirmed by the comments made at the end of the questionnaires. Since the universe from which this sampling was drawn is fairly uniform the answers may be taken as fairly representative of the collegiate group. Since they show a decided change 6f opinion towards the unorthodox as the average number of hours increases, this must be due to the content of the courses studied. These courses thus become a social force producing changes in religious opinion away from naYve thinking and in the direction of scientific thinking. Table VII shows that those of the collegiate group who answered question I had an average of but 14.4 hours in the subjects listed. They constituted 21 per cent of the whole group. Those who had had i5.5 hours answered question II as their belief. They constituted 35 per cent of the group. Those who favored question III had had i9.6 hours. Those who indicated question IV had had 24.7 hours, while those who listed an average of 44 hours subscribed to question V, though they con- stituted but i per cent of the total number.</page><page sequence="9">Measuring the Effect of a Social Force 9 I When this influence of social-science courses is checked against the two control groups, and especially the noncollegiate, the force becomes definitely apparent. Here 95 per cent of the non- collegiate and 68 per cent of the high-school groups subscribed to the first two questions.

For the purposes of this study term hours were reduced to semester hours. Return- ing to the collegiate group it becomes apparent that the addition of i. i hours changes belief from step I to step II, that 4. I more hours of study in the courses listed changes belief to step III, that 5.I more hours changes belief to step IV, and that if I9.3 more hours be added the student subscribes to step V. It thus requires 29.6 hours in the subjects listed to change a student from the naYve conceptions of step I to the sophisticated or more scientific concepts of step V. The first I4.4 hours probably make some changes in the thinking of students but not sufficient to be noted on so rough a scale. It is also evident that the steps are not equally distant. The interval between steps I and II is I.i, while between steps II and III it is 4.i, and between IV and</page><page sequence="10">92 The Journal of Educational Sociology V it is I 9.3. Theoretically, if not actually, a scale could be devised which would designate intervals of i hour of study in the courses listed. In this study it must be kept in mind that in the collegiate group replies were received from students with wide and varied interests. There were majors from all the departments usually- found in our universities. Agriculture, engineering, home eco- nomics, and liberal-arts majors were about equally numbered. The effectiveness of the instruction as a social force is shown by the correlations between the number of hours and the steps in the scales. Obviously the instruction would be more effective on some of the concepts than on others. Prayer, for example, has a positive correlation of +.59 +.02 as compared with immor- tality with a correlation of +.97 :?.OOI 9. In all cases the corre- lations are positive and indicate that as the number of hours of instruction in the courses listed increases the belief inclines to the scientific point of view.

In the past sociologists have been content to analyze social activity by a process of logic</page><page sequence="11">Measuring the Effect of a Social Force 93 and tell us what the ideal society should be. Now we should learn the status quo by scientific methods and apply sociometric techniques to the attainment of those ideals. Too long have soci- ologists been content to philosophize. Had there been a worthy successor to Ward to take up the analysis of society where he laid it down sociology would now be far advanced on the road to quantitative and, therefore, exact social analysis. The author fully recognizes the crudity, incompleteness, and lack of conclusiveness in the above study and presents it solely as a suggestive technique in quantitative sociology.</page></plain_text>
