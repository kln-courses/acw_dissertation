Veblen's conception of 'Darwinian' methodological principles led him to attempt to develop a theory of institutional evolution that was purely 'causal' in nature. This theory was never satisfactorily developed by Veblen. At base, his theory was one of new technology changing economic conditions, and new economic conditions leading to new ways of thinking and to new institutions through a (non intentional) process of 'habituation'. Those who attempted to follow Veblen, such as Hoxie and Mitchell, found difficulties with the key aspects of this theory, and both men came to abandon it. Institutionalism in the interwar period is devoid of attempts to develop Veblen's theory, and Veblen's programme remained a promise unfulfilled. 1. Introduction In 1898 Veblen published 'Why is Economics Not an Evolutionary Science?' This paper was both a scathing attack on the state of economics as 'helplessly behind the times, and unable to handle its subject matter in a way to entitle it to standing as a modern science' (Veblen, 1898B, p. 56), and a call for the reconstruction of economics along modern, evolutionary lines. The major characteristics of 'modern science', according to Veblen, are that it is evolutionary; that it is 'unwilling to depart from the test of causal relation'; that it runs strictly in terms of a 'colorless impersonal sequence of cause and effect' (Veblen 1898B, pp. 60-1); that it is theoretical and not merely descriptive or consisting only of a 'narrative account of industrial development' (Veblen 1898B, p. 58); and that the development of a proper evolutionary theory is possible owing to the cumulative nature of the cause and effect sequence. In terms of classical and neoclassical economics, Veblen argues that they are static, based on criteria of 'ceremonial adequacy', and run in terms of 'normal'or 'natural' tendencies to equilibrium states. Other factors are explained away as 'disturbing causes'. This terminology of 'normality and propensity to an end' is metaphorical, but Veblen is very aware of the power of metaphor: [I]t is this facile recourse to inscrutable figures of speech as the ultimate terms of theory that has saved the economist from being dragooned into the ranks of modem science.

Rutherford effective, both in their homiletical use and as a labor-saving device,—more effective than their user designs them to be. By their use the theorist is enabled serenely to enjoin himself from following out an elusive train of causal sequence. He is also enabled, without misgivings, to construct a theory of such an institution as money or land-ownership without descending to a consideration of the living items concerned, except for convenient corroboration of his normalised scheme of symptoms. (Veblen, 1898B, pp. 66-7) In place of such an economics, Veblen wished to substitute an evolutionary economics conceived of as a theoretical formulation of the 'economic life process' {ibid., p. 70). In this life process what changes over time is the human agent, or more exactly the agent's knowledge, skill, and habits of thought. This conception, in turn, necessitates the rejection of the hedonistic psychology contained in 'received formulations of economic theory', as hedonism involves 'a passive and substantially inert and immutably given human nature' {ibid., p. 73). For Veblen, individuals are active and the direction of an individual's activity is determined by his 'circumstances of temperament'. These are the product of 'his hereditary traits and his past experience, cumulatively wrought out under a given body of traditions, conventionalities, and material circumstances.' At any point in time they are given for the individual, but they 'afford the point of departure for the next step in the process' {ibid., p. 74). In a passage that provides a clear outline of the programme Veblen had in mind, he states: The economic life history of the individual is a cumulative process of adaptation of means to ends that cumulatively change as the process goes on, both the agent and his environment being at any point the outcome of the last process... What is true of the individual in this respect is true of the group in which he lives. All economic change is a change in the economic community,—a change in the community's methods of turning material things to account. The change is always in the last resort a change in habits of thought. This is true even of changes in the mechanical processes of industry. A given contrivance for effecting certain material ends becomes a circumstance which affects the further growth of habits of thought—habitual methods of procedure—and so becomes a point of departure for further development of the methods of compassing the ends sought and for the further variation of the ends that are sought to be compassed. {Ibid., pp. 74—5) From this Veblen argues that evolutionary economics 'must be the theory of a process of cultural growth as determined by the economic interest, a theory of a cumulative sequence of economic institutions stated in terms of the process itself {ibid., p. 77). It is noteworthy both that Veblen's conception of his task was so clearly formulated at this early stage in his writing career and that it remained so little changed over the subsequent 25 years. Nevertheless, what Veblen presented in his 1898 essay was a manifesto for an evolutionary economics, a methodological outline only. The theoretical components of the programme were developed in Veblen's first three books, The Theory of the Leisure Class (1899), The Theory of Business Enterprise (1904), and The Instinct of Workmanship (1914). Veblen's attempt to create an evolutionary economics, in its promise and appeal to modernity, initially attracted young scholars, but it was a programme that ultimately failed. This failure has been attributed to many causes, the decline of instinct theory and the decay in the use of biological metaphor among them, but the argument to be presented here is that, whatever other factors may have been at work, Veblen never managed to translate his methodological outline into a usable or appealing theory of institutional change. Those who sought to follow Veblen's lead—Robert F. Hoxie and Wesley C. Mitchell in particular—quickly discovered the flaws in his work, and rather than attempt to recast his evolutionary theory they turned to narrower tasks. Shortly</page><page sequence="3">Veblen's evolutionary programme 465 before his untimely death in 1916, Hoxie gave up on Veblen's theory of the trade union point of view and produced his own classification of union types, while after 1910 Mitchell abandoned his investigations of institutional evolution and moved to the statistical study of the specific problem of business cycles. The American institutionalism of the 1920s and 1930s contains numerous studies of particular institutions and social problems, and Veblen was an important influence, but it does not contain any develop ment of Veblen's theory of how institutional evolution actually takes place. In fact, the only other major institutionalist writer of the interwar period to address such issues, John R. Commons, explicitly rejected a number of the key methodological and theoretical aspects of the Veblenian programme. As Dorothy Ross has stated: 'What is perhaps most striking in this story of Veblen's first disciples is their departure from his theory' (Ross, 1991, p. 386). 2. Veblen and institutional evolution In Veblen's various methodological essays, he characterises 'modern science' as evo lutionary and as 'Darwinian' or even as 'post-Darwinian'. Veblen makes great rhetorical use of Darwin's name, but the analogy with Darwin and with biology was used for much more than just to imply modernity. For Veblen, what is particular about Darwinian evolutionary biology is the lack of any overall intent, purpose, or design: the evolutionary process is 'blind' and driven by the purely causal processes of variation and natural selection. Although it is doubtful that Veblen attempted to model his theory of institutional evolution on Darwinian notions of natural selection in any very close or exact manner,1 there is no doubt at all that he wished to produce an evolutionary model that was analogous to Darwin's in the general sense of being free from teleology. This is not to deny that individuals are purposeful actors, but it is to claim that institutional or cultural evolution is to be seen as the unintentional outcome of causal processes. The challenge Veblen set himself was to create a theory of social evolution that conformed to this methodological principle. 2.1 Instincts In approaching the question of institutional evolution in Veblen, it is first necessary to discuss his treatment of instincts. Veblen's theory of instincts applies to the biological evolution of humankind, but is not unconnected with social evolution. As Veblen states, the evolution of institutions is conditioned by 'the material environment and by the innate and persistent propensities of human nature' (Veblen, 1914, p. 2). Veblen does not provide a precise definition of instincts, but they are to be understood as determining the ends of action and not directly determining actions themselves. It is important to understand that for Veblen instincts involve the use of intelligence, and 'a more or less extended logic of ways and means comes to intervene between the instinctively given end and its realisation' (ibid., p. 6). In this way, instincts are to be distinguished from reflexes or tropisms. They are not to be thought of as 'unit characters, 1 There is a passage in The Theory of the Leisure Class where Veblen states that 'the evolution of social structure has been a process of natural selection of institutions' (Veblen, 1899, p. 188), but Veblen's system is not so much one of institutional variation followed by selection by the material environment as it is one of variation in the material environment itself promoting an adaptive institutional response. For the argument that Veblen was interested in the 'formation of analogies to both the gene and the processes of natural selection in the social world', see Hodgson (1992).</page><page sequence="4">466 M. Rutherford in the Mendelian sense', but are more complex, better thought of as 'spiritual traits emerging from a certain concurrence of physiological unit characters and varying somewhat according to variations in the complement of unit characters to which the species or individual may owe his constitution' (ibid., p. 13). Nevertheless, Veblen states quite clearly that 'the instincts are hereditary traits' (ibid., p. 13), and are not traits either acquired through use or lost through disuse (ibid., p. 200).1 The particular endowment of instincts found in any given group is to be understood as originally arrived at through biological processes of variation (mutation and hybridi sation) and the struggle for survival in the early pre-history of the human species. The processes described by Veblen in the formation of the instinctive endowment of a people conform to a Darwinian process of variation followed by selection by the environment, but then Veblen is discussing biological evolution over long periods of time and under stable environmental circumstances in which a genuine struggle to survive could be thought of as existing (see Veblen, 1915, pp. 290-1). Although Veblen is not entirely consistent in this, it appears that within historical time periods the instinctive endowment is to be regarded as stable (compare Veblen, 1899, pp. 213-315 with Veblen, 1914, pp. 35-6). Mutations are rare, and even in those communities made up of a mixture of racial stocks—where hybridisation creates additional variation—the pace of environmental change has been such that even 'an adequate adaptation of hybrid human nature to new conditions seems doubtful at best' (Veblen, 1914, p. 36). Furthermore, in the more advanced stages of human cultural and technological evolution, an economic surplus over mere subsistence has resulted in man achieving a relative 'emancipation from the law of natural selection'—'he is now able, without jeopardy to the life of the species, to play fast and loose with the spiritual basis of survival' (Veblen, 1898A, pp. 79-80). Thus, 'as the matter stands, the race is required to meet changing conditions' with a 'relatively unchanging endowment of instincts' (Veblen, 1914, p. 36). The instinctive endowment of humankind established through natural selection provides 'a generically human type of spiritual endowment' (ibid., pp. 15-16). Within this generic human nature there is, however, variation in the exact mixture and coordination among instincts, and this variety exists both between different groups, who evolved under different circumstances, and between individuals. Individual variation is particularly noticeable within those communities made up of a mixture of racial stocks, as hybrid populations show a considerable diversity of native character (ibid., p. 15). As will be seen below, this diversity does play a role in some parts of Veblen's discussions of social evolution. 2.2 Institutions Despite his insistence on the biological and hereditable nature of instincts, Veblen clearly rejected biological reductionism. The instinctive endowment gives only a starting point for the cumulative evolution of habits and institutions. Even in the earliest phases of human social development, the instincts do not directly or immediately determine human behaviour. The instinctive endowment and the environment (particularly the material, economic and technological environment) facing the group at the time the instinctive endowment is established provide the set of initial conditions from which the process of 1 This point is important as it allows Veblen to argue that no matter how long a given institutional system is in place the basic endowment of instinctive drives remains unchanged. Instincts are not lost through disuse. Also, it gives importance to cultural processes of transmission as acquired attributes (habits) do not become instinctive and cannot be passed on through inheritance.</page><page sequence="5">Veblen's evolutionary programme 467 the cumulative development of habits and institutions begins. Differences in instinctive endowment result in divergent paths of cultural development (Veblen 1914, pp. 112-14), but it is the subsequent cultural development that is the crucial element. In later phases of cultural development the instincts are layered over with social conventions and norms. The instincts do not disappear from the picture altogether, but they fall into the background. The instincts provide a set of original, or basic, goals of action, but people must work out the ways and means of achieving these objectives within the environmental conditions that they face. This involves the exercise of intelligence, but the environment tends to condition or 'discipline' the way people think and act, resulting in commonly held habits of thought and behaviour. These, over time, become conventionalised, take on normative connotations, and become institutions. The important point is that 'these conventional ways and means take their place as proximate ends of endeavour' and displace the instincts as the ends of action {ibid., pp. 7-8). Furthermore, there is no presumption that the set of ways and means as it evolves over time tends to become better adapted to the expression of man's instinctive nature. Certain instincts can undergo inversion or 'self contamination' that results in the generation of habits of thought at odds with the original functional content of the instinct {ibid., p. 52), so that cumulative institutional evolution may work to hinder the free expression of the instincts {ibid., pp. 19, 50-1). In Veblen's view, over the course of history institutional schemes have varied greatly in their consistency with the expression of the basic instinctive nature of the human species. Whatever their relation to the instincts, the habits of thought embodied in institutions are supported by social sanction, may become established in law, and are also passed on though socialisation. In this way, institutional schemes can have a significant degree of permanence, even in the face of changes in the set of conditions that gave rise to them in the first place. 2.3 Selection and adaptation How then do institutional schemes undergo change? In Veblen's earlier work he argues in terms of two processes. The first consists of 'a selection between stable types of temperament and character' that is carried out by the existing institutional environment; the second consists of what Veblen expresses as the 'adaptation of men's habits of thought to changing circumstances' (Veblen, 1899, p. 190). Veblen often simply consolidates both of these processes within what he calls 'selective adaptation'. He occasionally adds that the exact nature of the 'adaptive process' is of 'less importance than the fact that by one method or another institutions change and develop' {ibid., pp. 188, 190), an astonishing statement given his insistence elsewhere on the need to provide a causal and theoretical analysis of the processes involved. Nevertheless, it is the case that Veblen's discussions of exactly how evolutionary processes work are frequently lacking. It should also be noted that in Veblen's later work his emphasis on the first process diminishes very significantly, so that institutional change comes increasingly to be presented exclusively in terms of the adaptation of habits of thought to new circumstances. In terms of the selection of 'types' by the institutional environment, it will be remem bered that Veblen argued that there was some diversity of native character, reflecting variations in the particular strength and combination of instincts between individuals. Different character types will do better under different circumstances, and Veblen often speaks of the 'institutions in force at any given time' favouring the 'survival and dominance of one type of character in preference to another' (Veblen, 1899, p. 189). He</page><page sequence="6">468 M. Rutherford even talks in terms of a 'selective elimination of the unfit individuals and lines of descent' and of the 'elimination as well as repression' of those who fail to meet the demands of the 'accepted scheme' (ibid., p. 212). This process can certainly be understood, but questions arise concerning the nature of the selection involved and its institutional consequences. First, it is far from clear that this process of selection will do more than establish relative economic and/or social status. Veblen, for example, discusses the selection of individuals with suitable traits, and who succeed in gaining wealth, into the leisure class (ibid., p. 235), but failure to achieve that status hardly results in the elimination of less successful individuals or lines of descent. Unless actual survival or reproductive success is as stake it is difficult to see how such 'selection' can have any effect on the balance of types within the population. Second, even assuming that some kind of selection (social if not biological) does occur, the institutional consequence would seem to be limited to a reinforcement of the existing scheme of life. If the scheme of life is based on warlike prédation and the physically aggressive type of individual is selected and becomes 'dominant', surely this would tend to lead only to a further development along warlike lines. Since the actual course of institutional evolution, as Veblen describes it, has periodically involved substantial shifts in the underlying nature of the institutional scheme, and of the type of individual who will succeed as a result, there is an obvious need for some other evolutionary process, one that must be strong enough to be capable of overcoming the past selective influence of the established institutional scheme. This brings us to the other process mentioned by Veblen, the adaptation of habits of thought to changing circumstances. The changing circumstances that Veblen has in mind are changes in the manner in which people make their living, and are brought about primarily by changes in technology. However, new technology does not just happen by itself, and not all new technology has far-reaching effects on institutional structure. Veblen's idea is that whenever existing institutional circumstances are not too obstructive, the instinctive nature of the human species will express itself in ways that give rise to new technological insights. Of course, any new technological means developed will initially be introduced and utilised in a manner consistent with existing institutions and social norms, but new technology may result in unintended institutional consequences. New tech nology that brings about some significant change in the basic economic environment and methods of livelihood will tend to have far-reaching effects on habits of thought and, ultimately, on the institutional scheme.1 This process of adaptation is not one of rational or purposeful choice between alternative habits or institutions with some given objective in view. Veblen did not deny 1 Hodgson (1992, p. 289) has suggested that the evolutionary process in Veblen is one of the instinct of'idle curiosity' generating variation in habits of thought that the environment later selects between. If idle curiosity is continually producing new variations in habits, then some new set of habits may be generated that provides advantages and is selected by the environment. Environmental change will shift the requirements of success, in which case institutional evolution will set off in some new direction. My own interpretation is that the way idle curiosity works in Veblen's system is through technological change. Idle curiosity does not directly generate new habits of thought, but if the instinctive drive promotes new technological knowledge (which it may or may not do depending on existing institutional circumstances), then new habits of thought may arise from the new patterns of life that become established as a result. Idle curiosity is an instinctive drive to understand things and to construct systematised knowledge and it can create both 'quasi-knowledge', in the form of myths and beliefs without any serviceable function, as well as knowledge that has serviceable technological application. If the former, it will obstruct technological insight and advance. If the latter, it will 'accelerate the gain in technological insight'. Exactly how idle curiosity will express itself will depend in large pan on the extent to which the prevailing preconceptions lend themselves to conceptions of'magical efficacy' or 'mechanical efficiency' (Veblen, 1914, pp. 84-9).</page><page sequence="7">Veblen's evolutionary programme 469 that individuals have purposes that they strive to achieve, but his point is that the objectives that people adopt are themselves a matter of instinct or social institution, and the problem is to explain how it is that a social group comes to change its view of the appropriate ends of endeavour. As a part of this, Veblen rejected arguments based on the economic interests of individuals or classes. For example, Veblen characterises Marx's theory as one which operates through men 'taking thought of material (economic) advantages and disadvantages, and choosing that which will yield the fuller material measure of life' (Veblen, 1907, p. 437). This he attacks on the grounds that 'under the Darwinian norm' the use of an economic criterion of choice cannot be taken as a given, but must itself be seen as a habit of thought. Just because an individual or group has a certain economic interest does not mean that they will act upon it: 'the sentiment that animates men, singly or collectively, is as much, or more, an outcome of habit and native propensity as of calculated material interest' {ibid.., pp. 438, 441). It is not the economic interests of individuals and classes that matter so much as their habits of thought, and their habits of thought are an outcome of their 'workday' environment. What actually produces institutional change in Veblen's analysis of cumulative causation is as follows. There is always a certain starting point consisting of the given instinctive endowment of the group concerned and some established way of life and related habits of thought and institutions. The institutional system may, however, change as a result of the activities of individuals pursuing established objectives. In particular, new technology may be developed and introduced. These changes may eventually, cumulatively and unintendedly, lead to a change in the basic pattern of life for some or all of the population, and this shift in the material environment will lead to the development of new habits of thought that may come to displace the established habits and institutions. The unintentional nature of the process is preserved as the adaptation takes place not as a result of purposeful change or rational assessment, but as a result of the habituation that occurs through the conditioning influence of the new material circumstances, what Veblen calls the 'discipline of a new order of experience' (Veblen, 1919, p. 9). Examples of Veblen's use of this line of argument are abundant, but the following is typical: The new terms of workday knowledge and belief, which do not conform to the ancient canons, go to enforce and stabilize new canons and standards, of a character alien to the traditional point of view... This unsettling discipline that is brought to bear by workday experience is chiefly and most immediately the discipline exercised by the material conditions of life, the exigencies that beset men in their everyday dealings with the material means of life; inasmuch as these material facts are insistent and uncompromising. And the scope and method of knowledge and belief which is forced on men in their everyday material concerns will unavoidably, by habitual use, extend to other matters as well. (Ibid., p. 9) Veblen describes this as involving new conditions of life that cause both the 'habitual disuse' of the old habits of thought and their 'displacement' by the new {ibid., p. 9). Institutional change occurs through habitual disuse and displacement of old habits of thought by those promoted by the new material environment. 2.4 From feudalism to capitalism and beyond It is exactly this idea of the discipline imposed by the material conditions of life that Veblen utilises throughout his discussions of institutional evolution (Veblen, 1914), including his interpretation of the development of capitalist institutions and his con jectures concerning their possible demise. As these particular topics were taken on by those who followed Veblen, his views on these subjects are worth oudining briefly.</page><page sequence="8">470 M. Rutherford In his discussions of the emergence of capitalist institutions in Europe, Veblen begins from the particular instinctive endowment and cultural heritage of the people of northern Europe towards the end of the Middle Ages. The relatively peaceable conditions that came to prevail at that time and place were conducive to a resurgence of workmanship and of technological advance: Within the region of the Western Civilisation...the growth of institutions has shifted from the footing of prowess to that of prescriptive ownership. So soon as this shift has securely been made, the development of trade, industry and a technological system has come into the foreground, and these habitual interests have then reacted on the character of the institutions in force. (Veblen, 1914, p. 203) The transition to peaceable ownership was 'accompanied by a growth of handicraft, itinerant merchandising and industrial towns, so massive as to outlive and displace the feudal system under whose tutelage it took its rise' (ibid., p. 232). This displacement is one of feudal habits of thought based on prédation, on the principles of mastery and subservience, by new habits of thought related to the discipline of handicraft. Handicraft is a system with a twofold character or discipline in that the technological is combined with the pecuniary. The artisan is both an artificer working with tools and machines and a trader, owning his output and selling it in a market of some kind. The discipline it imposes is one of'workmanship and self-help' (ibid., pp. 210-11). In the earlier phases of the handicraft system it is the craftsman's individual proficiency that matters. Thus, the 'discipline of the handicraft industry enforces an habitual appre hension of mechanical forces and processes in terms of manual workmanship' (ibid., p. 237), but one that tends to 'an anthropomorphic interpretation that construes the facts of experience in terms of a craftsmanlike bent' (ibid., p. 242). This is linked by Veblen to developments in religion, for example the concept of God as the Great Artificer; in natural philosophy, particularly the concept of the Order of Nature with its system of Natural Law (ibid., pp. 257-8); and in the doctrine of Natural Rights and Liberties, especially the idea of a natural right to property based on productive labour (Veblen, 1904, pp. 77-9). As the handicraft system developed, transport and markets widened and new tech nology involving more complex tools and machines came to be developed. This resulted in an increasing division of labour between industrial and pecuniary activities. As a consequence, pecuniary concepts and ideals come to take on a larger role. The master craftsman gradually becomes an employer of other workmen in small workshops or factories. The owner of the workshop and the equipment has the authority to dispose of his employees' working capacity and product and becomes increasingly involved with market activity (Veblen, 1914, p. 279). This expansion of commercialism results in 'commercial habits of thought' and the ideas of individual liberty and the rights of ownership coming to 'comprise an extreme freedom and facility in the disposal of property' (Veblen, 1904, p. 81). In addition, the notions of efficiency and serviceability take on a more purely pecuniary interpretation. The master craftsman is gradually trans formed into a businessman concerned as much, or more, with profit on investment than with making a living through the exercise of his craft. Thus, 'as the technological situation gradually changed its character through extensions and specialisation in appliances and processes...the handicraft system with its petty trade outgrew itself and broke down in a new phase of the pecuniary culture' (Veblen, 1914, p. 213). In this manner, 'capitalism emerged from the working of the handicraft system, through the increased scale and efficiency of technology' (ibid., p. 282).</page><page sequence="9">Veblen's evolutionary programme 471 Capitalism is characterised by Veblen as consisting of a technological system of large scale 'machine industry' combined with a set of business principles based on investment for profit. The economic institutions of ownership are derived originally from the tech nological conditions of the earlier handicraft phases of industry. The 'common-sense apprehension of what are the proper limits, rights, and responsibilities of ownership, is an outgrowth of the traditions, experiences, and speculations of past generations' (Veblen, 1904, p. 70). The continued development of science and technology, however, created an ever greater specialisation of occupations and a widening gulf between the discipline of the pecuniary activity of the businessman and the discipline imposed on the worker and engineer in mechanised industry. It is in the discipline of the machine industry that Veblen locates the source of those habits of thought that might come to displace those of business and result in the transformation from capitalism to some set of more socialistic institutions. Business or pecuniary employments are concerned with 'exchange or market values and with purchase and sale', whereas industrial employments are concerned with 'the shaping or guiding of material things and processes' and with 'material serviceability' (Veblen, 1901, pp. 293-4). Machine technology brings with it a scheme of knowledge based on 'the law of cause and effect' and not on 'immemorial custom, authenticity, or authoritative enactment' (Veblen, 1904, p. 311). This leads to a sceptical attitude towards conventional notions of property and ownership. The 'moral effect' of machine tech nology on the industrial classes is a 'weakening of the natural rights animus' and a 'socialistic disaffection' with the institutional status quo {ibid., pp. 327, 349)—a socialistic disaffection, however, based on occupational discipline, on employment or work, rather than on possessions or relative wealth position (ibid., p. 348). In his later work, Veblen identified the engineers as the occupational group most likely to take a leading role in the promotion of institutional change (Veblen, 1921), but in the earlier part of his career he quite clearly thought that it was the unionised worker who was the most probable source of radicalism.1 Trade-unionism Veblen sees as an outgrowth of the particular conditions of machine industry and the 'socialistic bias' he also associates directly with the degree of development of machine technology. Machine technology tends to 'inculcate' iconoclastic habits of thought that 'come to a head' in socialism (Veblen, 1904, p. 351). Thus, the 'pervading characteristic of the trade union animus is the denial of the received natural rights dogmas', and the 'common run of trade-union action is at variance with the natural-rights foundation of the common law' (ibid., pp. 328-9). The 'logical outcome' of this trade union animus is an overt socialistic assertion of the 'mechanical standardization of industry as against the common-law standardization ofbusiness' (ibid., p. 331). In all of this it is technology that leads and institutional arrangements that follow— sometimes with a very long lag. The system of Natural Rights is 'an institutional by product of workmanship under the handicraft system'. It is 'adapted' to the conditions of handicraft, but only took full institutional effect at the point at which handicraft was already being superseded by machine technology and large-scale business (Veblen, 1914, pp. 341-2). Veblen argues that the adaption of institutions to the new conditions of machine technology could also be expected to take time, but is to be looked for in the steady and 'unremitting' disciplinary effect of the machine process on the habits of thought of the largest part of the population. 1 Veblen's views on the potential role of the engineers in social reform has generated much controversy. For a discussion of this issue in Veblen, see Rutherford (1992).</page><page sequence="10">472 M. Rutherford 3. The fate of Veblen's evolutionary theory Veblen's views on the impact on habits of thought of machine technology and the potential role of unions were in print by 1904 in The Theory of Business Enterprise. His ideas concerning the institutional history of Western civilisation did not reach published form in any very complete manner until 1914 with The Instinct of Workmanship, but Veblen had been presenting similar views in his classes for some time before. A number of Veblen's students were deeply impressed by his evolutionary theory and his analysis of the pecuniary and technological aspects of contemporary culture and attempted to put them to work: perhaps none more so than Wesley C. Mitchell and Robert F. Hoxie. 3.1 Wesley C. Mitchell: the evolution of the money economy Wesley Mitchell has been described as Veblen's 'outstanding student' (Dorffnan, 1959, p. 360). As a student at the University of Chicago, Mitchell absorbed much of Veblen's teaching. In 1902 Mitchell moved to Berkeley, but from 1906 to 1909 Veblen was at Stanford and the two men had a significant amount of contact. Mitchell's work up to the end of 1906 consisted of his study of the Greenbacks, but even before he completed this he was expressing the desire to engage in a larger and 'more penetrating' study (Lucy Sprague Mitchell, 1953, p. 165). The study Mitchell embarked on he called 'the money economy', an investigation of 'the highly organised group of pecuniary institutions', including 'how they evolved a quasi-independence and in turn affected not only the activities but the minds of their makers' {ibid., p. 167). The Veblenian nature of this proposal is strikingly clear. Mitchell's money economy project contained many components,1 including a study of the interrelation of price movements and business cycles, but it also came to involve a historical dimension: a study of the development of the money economy in Europe (and particularly in England from the eleventh to the sixteenth centuries). The only com ponent of the historical research published by Mitchell himself can be found in the form of a brief historical background to the phenomenon of business cycles (Mitchell, 1927, pp. 66-74), but he did present his work on the topic in more detail in an address given in May of 1910 (Mitchell, 1996), and this allows for some direct comparison with Veblen. In Veblen's discussion of the evolution of pecuniary institutions, the analysis runs almost exclusively in terms of the development of handicraft industry and its associated habits of thought. Mitchell's discussion refers to a broader range of explanatory variables. The introduction and spread of money transactions and markets Mitchell links first to the commutation of dues in kind and in labour in the manorial system, and the gradual rise of estate management for profit rather than for direct subsistence. These developments are linked to the substantial savings in transaction costs provided by the system of money rents, the greater incentives to efficiency, and the scarcity of labour resulting from the Black Death. Second, Mitchell discusses the substitution of money payment for knight service. This occured as a result of the Crown's need for money to finance foreign military campaigns, the greater efficiency of mercenaries, and the obvious benefits to tenants of avoiding direct military service. Finally, Mitchell refers to the growth of commerce in towns and the gradual freeing of market prices from regulation. The interest of the nobility in promoting freer trade is mentioned as a factor in this process, as is the difficulty 1 The money economy project contained the seeds of many of Mitchell's more obviously 'institutionalist' essays, including 'The Rationality of Economic Activity' (1910), 'The Backward Art of Spending Money' (1912), and "The Role of Money in Economic Theory' (1916).</page><page sequence="11">Veblen's evolutionary programme 473 of regulating prices in the face of exogenous shocks such as fluctuating harvests, the Black Death, war and currency debasement. Technological change and the growth in capital requirements as the scale of manufacturing increased are mentioned by Mitchell but given no special priority as a causal factor (Mitchell [1910], 1996). Indeed, Mitchell's argument is predominantly one that at a certain point in history, and under the particular conditions that then existed, money transactions became more efficient than the older system of payments in kind and in labour. The use of money and market transactions gradually spread and displaced non-monetary forms of organisation and exchange. In Mitchell's own words: Why men have extended so widely this practice of putting their dealings with each other upon a pecuniary basis is a problem of details. Sometimes both parties probably foresaw an advantage from the change... Sometimes one party forced the arrangement on the other, as villeins wrung com mutation from reluctant landlords after the Black Death. Sometimes a clear appreciation of the benefits of novel uses of money lagged behind the practice... But soon or late, men have come to understand at least the clearest effects of money economy. {Ibid., p. 354) In Mitchell's treatment then, the initial spread of money transactions and market exchange is explained in terms of economic advantage rather than in terms of tech nological change specifically. Where Mitchell reverts to a more Veblenian style of argu ment is in the analysis of the longer-term and unintended effect of the growing use of money on habits of thought. Money transactions were introduced within a system of feudal preconceptions. The growth of the use of money and markets had a corrosive influence on those preconceptions, resulting instead in the development of a pecuniary habit of mind. Mitchell takes this to the point of arguing that what we would now think of as economic rationality is itself an institutional product, a product of long habituation to a way of life based upon monetary calculation and attention to pecuniary advantage {ibid.). He has no difficulty with the Veblenian characterisation of modern Western civilisation as a business or pecuniary culture built on the principles of pecuniary gain. However, nowhere in Mitchell does one find a discussion of the type supplied by Veblen on the cultural impact of machine technology. Mitchell's experience with the money economy project was not incidental to the development of his views on Veblen or to the subsequent direction of his own work. Later in 1910 Mitchell abandoned the project, and turned his attention to the problem of business cycles that was both more specific and more amenable to quantitative analysis. As he put it in a later piece on Veblen: [P]roblems of cumulative change in 'life history' are extremely difficult to treat by any method of measurement. Each change is by hypothesis a unique event, begotten by an indefinite number of causes. To disentangle the tangled skein is impossible. Without the aid of elaborate technique it is hard to do more with such problems than what Darwin and Veblen have done—that is, to study the evidence and select for particular attention what seem to be the salient factors... It is only when he comes to recent changes that an investigator has tolerably accurate data. These materials Veblen did not reject; but he made no great effort to exploit them. In this respect, at least, his practice resembled that of most orthodox economists. (Mitchell, 1936, p. 298) Mitchell came to the view that Veblen's work was too speculative, that 'it was not accurate in detail', and that he failed to establish the relative importance of'the factors he dealt with and the factors he scamped' (Mitchell, 1929). While Veblen did attempt to deal with actual rather than 'normal' behaviour, his conclusions were often just as speculative and as untestable as those of orthodox economists. In place of such speculation, Mitchell</page><page sequence="12">474 M. Rutherford proposed a programme of studying a particular problem open to empirical examination with the institutional component made explicit but taken as a given. In this manner, Mitchell turned his attention to the statistical examination of the problem of business cycles conceived of as an undesired and unintended consequence of the existing pecuniary habits of mind and institutions: the profit-seeking nature of business enterprise; the functioning of other pecuniary institutions such as banks; and the operation, interrelations, and leads and lags in the movements of prices in various markets. The issue of how this set of habits and institutions evolved from earlier forms he left to economic historians (Mitchell, 1944). 3.2 Robert F. Hoxie: unions and machine discipline Robert Hoxie became heavily influenced by Veblen after both men were brought to the new Department of Economics at the University of Chicago by Laurence Laughlin. This influence is very apparent in Hoxie's 1901 methodological essay 'On The Empirical Method of Economic Instruction' (Hoxie, 1901), which is full of Veblenian terminology. The essay contains the argument that economics must become a study of 'the life process and genesis of economic organisation, essentially cognate with the biological sciences' and with the aim of providing a 'systematic account in causal terms of groups of facts whose relationships are subject to cumulative change' (ibid., p. 486). In 1906 Hoxie turned his attention to the particular issues of labour and trade unionism, but this interest was direcdy prompted by Veblen's ideas on the impact of the machine process on the habits of thought of industrial workers (Fishman, 1958, pp. 223-7; McNulty, 1973, p. 464). Hoxie himself stated the thesis as follows: The laborer, like the rest of us, is a product of heredity and environment... Now, it is well known, that the environment of the laborer under the modem capitalistic system has tended to become predominantly one of physical force. He has been cut off from all knowledge of market and managerial activities. The ideals, motives, and cares of property ownership are becoming foreign to him... Even outside the strictly mechanical occupations the machine and the machine process are coming to dominate the worker and the growth in size of the industrial unit renders his economic relationship ever more impersonal. (Hoxie, 1907, p. 348) The result of this for Hoxie, as for Veblen, was a 'distinctive trade union point of view' or a distinctive 'spiritual basis' for unionism. This generated an ideological gulf separating workers from employers and rendering them 'incapable of mutual understanding' (ibid., pp. 359-61). Hoxie's work on trade unions, then, was motivated by this Veblenian idea and, according to Fishman, with the problem of just exactly how the prevailing pecuniary institutions are to be 'disestablished' and institutions more in line with industrial habits of thought established in their place (Fishman, 1958, pp. 222, 226)—an issue on which Veblen was uncomfortably vague. What Hoxie found, and published in a series of works beginning in 1908, was not consistent with the Veblenian point of view. Hoxie's investi gations led him to the view that there were many different types of union, each with different motivations and programmes and emerging out of different sets of environ mental and temperamental conditions (Hoxie, 1917, pp. 31-52). Moreover, Hoxie argued that the 'dominant motive of the average wage-worker must ever be to secure the greatest possible pecuniary results from his toil' (Hoxie, 1908, pp. 693-4), and that the dominant form of unionism was what he called 'business unionism', unions organised to do business with employers and to 'bargain for the sale of the product which it controls'</page><page sequence="13">Veblen's evolutionary programme 475 (Hoxie, 1917, p. 336). These unions profess belief in natural rights and accept 'as inevitable, if not as just, the existing capitalistic organization and the wage system, as well as existing property rights and the binding force of contract' {ibid., p. 45). These findings resulted in Hoxie turning away from the Veblenian model. In his last book, published posthumously in 1917, Hoxie characterises Veblen's theory as seeing society as made up of two warring classes that are the result of modern machine industry creating separate material environments and mental disciplines for each. He goes on: What is wrong with this theory?... Existing facts in this connection as to class solidarity confute it.... [I]t places too much stress on the economic environment as a formative force. Man is the outcome of his total social environment. The individual, according to Veblen, cannot react on this environment: he is not a center of force. But cannot we do something to change this environment by education, shop arrangements, etc.? Again, there are no such rigid economic environments and disciplines. There is much more social interaction than supposed. {Ibid., pp. 366-7) It is worth noting that Veblen ultimately accepted part of Hoxie's analysis and came to present major unions such as the American Federation of Labour as business unions concerned only with pecuniary gain. Partly for that reason, Veblen turned his attention to the engineers as a possible force for institutional reconstruction (Veblen, 1921). He did not, however, feel the need to abandon his more basic idea that institutional change would come about only through a process of habituation to machine technology. 4. Conclusion Veblen's 1898 programme for an evolutionary economics was intended to point the way to an economics focused on the cumulative evolution of economic institutions, with that evolution formulated in terms of a purely causal process. This seems to be what Veblen understood as Darwinian, and it is what he attempted to apply to the history and current trends of economic and cultural evolution as he saw them. The specific theory of social evolution that Veblen developed is one that involves the idea of there being a 'discipline' exacted over habits of thought by the manner in which people obtain their living. It places particular emphasis on the role of technology in bringing about changes in the pattern of life and relies on a theory that depicts the prevailing pattern of life, the economic environ ment, as ultimately determining the prevalent habits of thought. As Mitchell discovered, Veblen's theory gave him an overly narrow focus on new technology as the source of economic change. The evolution of the economic system may be affected by a vast number of factors, technological and otherwise. Clearly, Mitchell came to the belief that many more factors were at work than were included within Veblen's theory. Moreover, while the theory of the impact of economic conditions on habits of thought is sometimes utilised quite imaginatively, as when Veblen talks of the metaphorical extension of the ideals of handicraft to conceptions of both nature and God, it is also used crudely, as in the discussion of the impact of machine technology on the habits of thought of the unionised workman. This is not to deny the pervasive influence of modern science and technology over the way in which people think about the world, but contact with mechanical processes has not led to widespread rejection of capitalist conventionalities. This is what Hoxie found in his study of unions. The source of these difficulties is to be found in the particular interpretation and theoretical expression Veblen gave to the notion of non-teleological explanation in the social sciences. Following Darwin, he sought an evolutionary theory that was free from</page><page sequence="14">476 M. Rutherford teleology and ran in purely causal terms. He was aware that individuals acted in a goal directed manner, but he wanted to present institutional change as unintended result—as a result of a causal process that did not rely on intentionality or on the appraisal of one institutional scheme as compared to another. Of course, Veblen was quite correct to insist that institutional change considered in the large is non-teleological. The people of Europe in the Middle Ages did not individually or collectively decide that they would be better off under the institutions of twentieth-century capitalism. But to agree to this does not necessarily involve either Veblen's stress on technology or his particular theory of habit formation. Veblen's idea of a cumulative process that, over time, gives rise to institutional results that were not, and could not, have been foreseen or intended is not inconsistent with the inclusion of a wider range of causal factors, or for that matter, with choice and intentionality playing a larger role in many of the individual steps along the way. The difficulties that Veblen's students experienced in the application of his evolu tionary theory point to genuine problems with his formulation. Unfortunately, the problems they discovered did not prompt them to reformulate the theory in a more satisfactory fashion. It may not have been obvious to them how to go about such a task, and in any case their concerns were more with the immediate problems of the economic system as it then existed, and with creating an economics relevant to those problems. This is not to say that Veblen's work was abandoned in total, but it is to say that the American institutionalism that actually formed in the interwar period was something much less than Veblen had envisaged in 1898. For the most part this institutional economics consisted of the study of particular problems within a given institutional context. Many of the problems studied, for example the behaviour of large corporate enterprises, issues of ownership and control, excess capacity and 'waste', business cycles and unemployment, as well as the overall conceptualisation of the existing set of institutions as a pecuniary system at odds with the requirements for the efficient operation of industry, came from Veblen. However, one finds little work after the first few years of the twentieth century that attempted to use or develop Veblen's theory of institutional evolution. It is true that an alternative was generated within institutionalism. In his work from 1924 on, Commons tried to provide a theory of institutional change, but produced one very different from Veblen's on both methodological and theoretical levels. Commons may have been reacting to what he saw as some of Veblen's excesses. In any case, he attacked directly what he considered to be Veblen's 'elimination of purpose' and his attempt to utilise the analogy of natural selection (Commons, 1934, p. 654). Commons's own system used the analogy of 'artificial selection' and concentrated on intentionalist processes of political and legal change. Commons's work is frequently criticised for exactly the opposite problem to Veblen's: that of placing too much emphasis on intentional institutional change. However, his system became so complex and was so poorly expressed that it had little influence even among his own students. One con sequence of all of this was that institutionalism was left open to the argument that it was descriptive, consisting of little more than a set of case studies and with no unifying theory of institutions or institutional change. The promise of Veblen's programme was not fulfilled and the challenge of building a genuinely evolutionary economics remains. The fate of Veblen's efforts might remind those attempting similar things now of the complexity of social evolutionary processes, the care with which analogies from other sciences need to be applied, and the still outstanding need for an adequate framework for the analysis of institutional change.</page><page sequence="15">Veblen's evolutionary programme 477 Bibliography Commons, J.
