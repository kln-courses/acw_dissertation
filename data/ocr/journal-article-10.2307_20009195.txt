CAPIT?N IN Part X of Hume's Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion, Philo presents the famous trilemma attributed to Epicurus: "Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able? Is he able, but not willing? Is he both willing and able? Whence then is evil?" Some critics say Philo is trying to disprove God's existence.1 Some say he is not.2 Actually, he is demolishing natural religion, not by disproving God's existence, but by invalidating the argument to God's moral attributes. I would like to show how he does this. Natural religion, in the Dialogues and commonly in the eighteenth century, is the set of beliefs about God allegedly derivable from reason and ex? perience unaided by revelation. Natural theolog? ians claimed to know, not only that God exists, but also enough about God's nature to infer that men ought to worship him by being pious and virtuous, that men must repent of their sins, and that there are present and future rewards and punishments.3 The position Philo takes against natural religion is, as he says, "moderate scepticism." He questions only the adequacy of the evidence offered by natural theologians for their claims about God's nature. He does not, as would a Pyrrhonist, reject the common sense idea of evidence ; for he believes arguments derived from common life can dispel the subtle arguments of the sceptics. "But," he adds, "it is evident whenever arguments lose this advantage and run wide of common life, that the most refined scepticism comes to be upon a footing with them, and is able to oppose and counter balance them. The mind must remain in suspense between them; and it is that very suspense or balance which is the triumph of scepticism."4 Philo maintains this position throughout the Dialogues, and this is the key to his argument in Part X. Demea opens Part II by saying: "The question is not concerning the being but the nature of God. This, I affirm, from the infirmities of human under? standing, to be altogether incomprehensible and unknown to us" (Hume, p. 15). And, whatever was said earlier or will be said later, Philo agrees with him here and many times after: "the question can never be concerning the being but only the nature of the Deity. The former truth ... is un? questionable and self-evident. Nothing exists with? out a cause ; and the original cause of this universe (whatever it be) we call God . . ." (Hume, p. 16). Philo does not depart from his moderate scepticism here; for, unlike the natural theologians' abstruse reasonings about God's nature, this reasoning about God's existence rests on the solid ground of common sense. Basson says this agreement is not meant ser? iously.5 He believes a substantial part of the Dialogues is concerned with the question of existence and the question of God's existence and the question of God's nature could hardly be dis? cussed independently because the former cannot be other than a question of something's having certain antecedently specified characteristics. But Philo has already said there is an original cause of 1 Among these are: T. H. Huxley, Hume (London, 1879), pp. 146-152; A. H.

Responding to this question, then, Philo makes two assertions which determine the course of the entire discussion. First, he gives his view of how we associate certain expressions with the name "God." "Wis? dom, thought, design, knowledge?these we justly ascribe to him because these words are honorable among men, and we have no other language or other conceptions by which we can express our adoration of him. But let us beware lest we think that our ideas anywise correspond to his perfec? tions, or that his attributes have any resemblance to these qualities among men. He is infinitely superior to our limited view and comprehension, and is more the object of worship in the temple than of disputation in the schools" (Hume, p. 16). Second, Philo challenges Gleanthes by saying: "Our ideas reach no farther than our experience: We have no experience of divine attributes and operations: I need not conclude my syllogism: You can draw the inference yourself" (Hume, pp. 16-17). If Philo wants Cleanthes to infer that God does not exist, he should not have conceded earlier that there must be an original cause of the uni? verse. He wants Cleanthes to infer that we cannot prove anything about God which would make natural religion seem reasonable.8 Cleanthes responds to Philo's challenge with the argument from design: The curious adapting of means to ends, throughout all nature, resembles exactly, though it much exceeds, the productions of human contrivance?of human design, thought, wisdom, and intelligence. Since therefore the effects resemble each other, we are led to infer, by all the rules of analogy, that the causes also resemble, and that the Author of nature is some? what similar to the mind of man, though possessed of much larger faculties, proportioned to the grandeur of the work which he has executed. (Hume, p. 17.) He wants to prove God is, not just cause of the universe, but also "similar to the mind of man"; for, as we shall see, he thinks it essential for all religion that God be anthropomorphic at least in being benevolent. Now the battle line between Philo and Cleanthes is drawn. Cleanthes tries to infer what he can about God while Philo deftly and Demea unwittingly keep cutting the ground from under him. Part X is another stage, and a crucial one, in a series of Cleanthes' attempts to infer what he can about God. At this stage Cleanthes is trying to establish God's benevolence; God's existence has not been questioned, nor will it be. We must notice where Philo enters the discussion and where he aims: And is it possible, Cleanthes, that after all these reflections, and infinitely more, which might be suggested, you can persevere in your anthropo? morphism, and assert the moral attributes of the Deity, his justice, benevolence, mercy, and rectitude, to be of the same nature with these virtues in human creatures ? His power, we allow, is infinite : Whatever he wills is executed: But neither man nor any other animal are happy: Therefore he does not will their happiness. His wisdom is infinite: He is never mis? taken in choosing the means to any end: But the course of nature tends not to human or animal felicity: Therefore it is not established for that purpose. Through the course of human knowledge, there are 6 Huxley {op. cit.) says this makes us doubt whether Philo ought to be taken as Hume's mouthpiece because in the Treatise of Human Nature, Book I, Part III, Sections III and XIV, Hume affirms that "there is no absolute nor metaphysical necessity that every beginning of existence should be attended with such an object" [as a cause] ; and again, that it is "easy for us to conceive any object to be non-existent this moment and existent the next, without conjoining to it the distinct idea of a cause or productive principle." But Hume explains his meaning in his letter to John Stewart: "I never asserted so absurd a Proposi? tion as that any thing might arise without a Cause: I only maintain'd, that our Certainty of the Falshood [sic] ofthat Proposition proceeded neither from Intuition or Demonstration; but from another Source. That Caesar existed, that there is such an Island as Sicily; for these propositions, I affirm, we have no demonstrative nor intuitive Proof. Woud [sic] you infer that I deny their Truth, or even their Certainty? There are many different kinds of Certainty; and some of them as satisfactory to the Mind, tho perhaps not so regular, as the demonstrative kind." The Letters of David Hume, vol. I, ed. J. Y. T. Greig (Oxford, 1932), p. 187. 7 For a clear statement of this point and a helpful examination of the question "Does God exist?" see Paul Ziff, "About God" in Religious Experience, and Truth, ed. Sidney Hook (New York, 1961), pp. 195-202. 8 I agree generally with Professor Butler (op. cit.) when he says "Philo's entire criticism of the argument from design should be viewed as an attempt, not to deny that God exists, but to break down Cleanthes' initial opinion that theological beliefs may find rational support in the recognition of evidence" (p. 87) ; and when he says, "The Dialogues are an attempt to work out precisely how much or how little is involved in this concession" [that God exists] (p. 92). But I prefer my formulations of these two points as more specific for Part X.</page><page sequence="3">84 AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY not inferences more certain and infallible than these. (Hume, p. 66.) Hume has been criticized for not seeing that God may have had to allow suffering for some reason or other; and, this being so, Philo's reasoning dis? proves neither God's existence, nor God's bene? volence, nor God's omnipotence.9 But Philo asks this: "In what respect, then, do his benevolence and mercy resemble the benevolence and mercy of men?" (Hume, p. 66). There is no reason to suppose Hume thought Philo's reasoning disproved anything except that the course of nature was an adequate basis for saying the moral attributes of God are the same as those of humans. Philo admits to Cleanthes the reasonableness of ascribing a purpose to nature, but he denies that the purpose is to benefit either man or beast: You ascribe, Cleanthes, (and I believe justly) a purpose ... to nature. But what ... is the object of that curious artifice and machinery, which she has displayed in all animals? The preservation alone of individuals and propagation of the species ? It seems enough for her purpose, if such a rank be barely up? held in the universe, without any care or concern for the members that compose it. (Hume, p. 66.) Cleanthes sees the seriousness of Philo's attack, and he sees it for what it is?neither an assertion that God does not exist, nor an assertion that God is not benevolent, but an attack upon the idea that the course of nature is a basis for asserting God's benevolence.10 So Cleanthes tells Philo: "If you can . . . prove mankind to be unhappy or cor? rupted, there is an end at once of all religion. For to what purpose establish the natural attributes of the Deity, while the moral are still doubtful and uncertain?" (Hume, p. 67). Now Philo is in a position not entirely satis? factory to a sceptic ; he is asked to prove something and, scepticism aside, something difficult, if not impossible to prove. His next move is important, in fact, the crux of this dialogue, but before he can make it, Demea interrupts to state his theodicy. The interruption helps Philo strategically, and it is a chance for Hume to interject a representative line of thinking which he thinks must be cut down before the full impact of Philo's scepticism can be appreciated. Demea's theodicy is the so-called "porch view": This world is but a moment in comparison of eternity. The present phenomena, therefore, are rectified in other regions, and in some future period of existence. And the eyes of men, being then opened to larger views of things, see the whole connection of general laws, and trace, with adoration, the benevolence and rectitude of the Deity. . . . (Hume, p. 67.) This theodicy directs attention to the broad and eternal view of existence, and it is general enough to represent most theodicies. It makes either of two assumptions. One characterizes our view as being so limited that, even though we think we suffer, we really do not. Presumably, a broader or longer view of things would disclose our error. The other is that our view is so limited that, even though we really suffer when we think we do, we do not see that we must suffer for the sake of a greater good, either for ourselves or for the whole world. On the one hand, there really is no evil; on the other, evil is necessary.11 Whichever assumption Demea makes, his theo? dicy will not withstand Cleanthes' blow against it : "Whence can any cause be known but from its effects? To establish one hypothesis upon another is building entirely in the air: and the utmost we can ever attain, by these conjectures and fictions, is to ascertain the bare possibility of our opinions ; but never can we, upon such terms, establish its reality" (Hume, p. 68). So this theodicy and all others like it cannot interfere with Philo's line of argument. Demea has no naturalistic evidence to claim that there are regions and a period of future existence where the present evil phenomena are rectified. And, while Cleanthes admits that these con? jectures and fictions ascertain the bare possibility of our opinion, thus recognizing that Philo's trilemma does not logically exclude the possibility of a benevolent God, still these conjectures pre? suppose that God is a moral agent?that he will, because of his nature, rectify the present evils of man?when this is precisely the point at issue. 9 Nelson Pike, op. cit. 10 This strictly parallels the argument Hume puts forth in the Inquiry Concerning Human Understanding, sect. XI. See the explication of it by Antony Flew in Hume's Philosophy of Belief (New York, 1961), pp. 222-223. 11 The distinction between these two assumptions is seldom made. Berkeley seems to think evil is an illusion, but he uses the second notion, that evil is necessary, to explain the illusion (Principles of Human Knowledge, Part I, sect. 153). Berkeley's view resembles Demea's in form and in lack of form. Leibniz, of course, uses the second, more common notion (Theodicy: Summary of the Controversy Reduced to Formal Arguments, Objection I, Answer).</page><page sequence="4">part x of hume's "dialogues" 85 Cleanthes knows Demea cannot argue that God will, in some unknown way and for some unknown reason, validate man's suffering; nor can he base his argument on God's benevolence when he does not know that God is benevolent?when, in fact, he is trying to prove that benevolence in the presence of suffering makes it doubtful. So he says to Demea, "The only method of supporting divine benevolence (and it is what I willingly embrace) is to deny absolutely the misery and wickedness of man" (Hume, p. 68). And now Philo is ready for his crucial move. He says: I . . . must admonish you, Cleanthes, that you have put the controversy upon a most dangerous issue, and are unawares introducing a total scepticism into the most essential articles of natural and revealed theology. What! no method of fixing a just foundation for religion unless we allow the happiness of human life, and maintain a continued existence even in this world, with all our present pains, infirmities, vexa? tions, and follies, to be eligible and desirable! But this is contrary to everyone's feeling and experience; it is contrary to an authority so established as nothing can subvert. No decisive proofs can ever be produced against this authority; nor is it possible for you to compute, estimate, and compare all the pains and all the pleasures in the lives of all men and of all animals; and thus, by your resting the whole system of religion on a point which, from its very nature, must for ever be uncertain, you tacitly confess that that system is equally uncertain. (Hume, pp. 68-69.) Philo has turned the trick without proving or dis? proving anything, not even that mankind is unhappy. Cleanthes, himself, has shown that the only way to establish the divine benevolence and, consequently, natural religion itself is to stand in a quagmire. Philo then takes the argument to a second stage and even allows "what can never possibly be proved"?that human happiness exceeds its misery. This takes Cleanthes nowhere because from infinite power, wisdom, and goodness we should reasonably expect no misery in the world at all. The only escape from logic so solid and decisive is to deny that we know anything about these matters. This, says Philo, he has maintained from the beginning of the discussion (Hume, p. 69). Philo next takes the argument to a third stage and even grants that pain or misery in man is compatible with infinite power and goodness, even in the ordinary sense of these attributes. Even this takes Cleanthes nowhere, for he must prove that the Deity has these attributes from the present mixed and confused phenomena, and from these alone. Even if there were no evil, Cleanthes would confront sufficient difficulties because the pheno? mena are finite. Actually, there is evil and the phenomena are mixed (Hume, p. 69). Clearly, Philo is not arguing against God's existence, for then allowing the compatibility of evil and the divine attributes would amount to capitulation. In Part XI Cleanthes tries to avoid Philo's conclusion and preserve the human analogy: "Supposing the author of nature to be finitely perfect, though far exceeding mankind, a satis? factory account may then be given of natural and moral evil . . . benevolence, regulated by wisdom and limited by necessity, may produce just such a world as the present" (Hume, p. 71). But this supposition allows merely the compatibility of evil and divine benevolence. Philo has already in effect shown it of no avail in Part X, where, for the sake of argument, he allows the compatibility of evil with infinite power and goodness. In Part XI he has merely to say, "Conjectures, especially where infinity is excluded from Divine attributes, may perhaps be sufficient to prove a consistency, but can never be foundations for any inference" (Hume, p. 73). And inference has been the matter all along. So with God's moral character at stake, with Cleanthes' attachment of the fate of natural religion to the fate of God's benevolence, with Cleanthes' demolishing blow against Demea's theo? dicy and all others like it ("to establish one hypothesis upon another is building entirely in the air"), and with the necessary foundation of natural religion shown to be in principle un provable, even allowing the compatibility of evil and divine benevolence, Philo justly considers his case logically tight. While this is not a demonstra? tion that God does not exist, nor that God is not benevolent, it is a perfect triumph for the sceptic on perhaps the crucial issue for natural religion.
