<plain_text><page sequence="1">Vladimir Propp and Dubliners Doris T Wight University of Wisconsin [Propp's morphology) is a powerful technique of descriptive ethnography inasmuch as it lays bare the essential form of the folklonstic text. But the form must ultimately be related to the culture or cultures in which it is found_There is certainly no reason in theory why the syntagmatic structure of folktales cannot be meaningfully related to other aspects of a culture (such as social structure).1 Alan Dundes' introduction to Propp's Morphology of the Folktale quoted above reasons for a broad application of Propp's work on the Russian tale. Dundes asks to what extent structure in the fairy tale is related to the structure of the ideal success story in a culture, and he inquires, suggestively, how that fairy tale structure is learned. Says Dundes, "Certainly children 'learn' riddle structure almost as soon as they learn specific riddles. Propp's Morphology thus provides an invaluable tool for the investigation of the acquisition of folklore."2 Dundes' ideas on extending Propp's descriptive ethnography pro vide part of the stimulus for this paper. Another factor is Propp's specific methodology, particularly his isolating in tales seven specific characters. These he defines not as persons but as how personages? or even objects or abstract qualities?function within the story. This provides exciting potential for unlocking meaning in difficult tales such as those of Dubliners. A third motivation is such critical ap proaches to Dubliners as Brewster Ghiselin's, which suggest that Dubliners as a whole may have a structure like the Odyssey, a struc ture which can be charted syntagmatically using Propp's thirty-one functions.3 Joyce openly linked Ulysses to its original by his title. Perhaps Dubliners is not a collection of varied tales like the Decameron but a much tighter work, as compact as a single tale. It is true that Ulysses grew from a story about a man like Leopold Bloom, a story meant at first for Dubliners. Propp, in chapter five of Morphology, points out when discussing elements of tales, 415</page><page sequence="2">Any tale element... can, as it were, accumulate action, can evolve into an independent story, or can cause one. But like any living thing, the tale can generate only forms that resemble itself. If any cell of a tale organism becomes a small tale within a larger one, it is built, as we shall see later, according to the same rules as any fairy tale.4 Dundes points out the relationship of Propp's Morphology of the Folktale to the structure of the epic: "It is noteworthy that the last portion of the Odyssey is strikingly similar to Propp's functions 23-31."5 Are the modern novel and the modern short story, those "ideal success stories in a culture," really modern versions of literature such as fairy tales? Are our contemporary forms still presented in narrative riddle structures we all learned as children? Are such riddle structures?the trebling rampant in Dubliners' "Clay" for ex ample?perhaps the keys we need to use when the omniscient narrator seems to have deserted us, leaving us bare incidents related in style indirect libre to fathom? Do these modernist texts nonetheless still deal with the age-old questions asked and answered by fairy tales? Are tales, therefore, old and new, the community talking to itself, telling the young how to deal with human needs within the human environment: loss of the parental home, discovery of sexual desires, pressure to secure a working and workable spot within the social structure? At one point fourteen tales, not fifteen, were to have comprised the fictional biography of Dublin's people called Dubliners. Religion is an ever-present institution from the first tale, "The Sisters," in which we follow the emotions of a sensitive young boy waiting for, and then experiencing, the death of the priest who had been his mentor, through the fourteenth tale, "Grace," portraying an alco holic brought to a retreat by his fellow-drinking businessmen friends. Religion is not the only institution blamed for the situation in the Dublin Joyce constantly refers to as brown and dusty; other institutions, certainly including marriage, perform the villainy func tion Propp designates (A).6 And the complementary function to villainy, the discovery of a lack (a), is well represented in these tales of people guilty of cowardice, meanness, drunkenness, ignorance, duplicity, apathy, vanity, cruelty Human nature, in the sense of lack, is accused from "The Sisters" to "Grace." It is accused again in "The Dead." What is different about "The Dead," however, is that for the first time in that story, not merely human institutions but external nature, the power of the universe expressed through the symbols of death and snow-this new kind of "villainy" for humans?is per 416</page><page sequence="3">ceived. The difference in viewpoint is momentous. Using Propp's seven characters-as-functions, one finds one set for the first fourteen tales, a changed set for the crowning fifteenth tale. Can one prove the above statements, however, by studying Dub liners' character-functions? No, "prove" is too strong a term. One might, however, arrive at a deepened understanding of the text through this means, and use it to supplement other discoveries and revelations about the book called "the foundation of Joyce's art," the workshop where "in shaping its stories he developed that mastery of naturalistic detail and symbolic design which is the hallmark of his mature fiction,"7 a fiction this essay tries to root in Proppian folklore. The first fourteen stories fall into four groups. Individual Dublin citizen-heroes appearing in the first three stories are all children, and hence all are victims of external human-institution villainy in brown Dublin. In the next four stories, which render adolescents, the heroine suffers from a lack of courage to escape her fate; the Irish hero suffering from vanity is a prey to the sophisticated European sporting set; two villainous men prey upon a woman; two villainous women prey upon a man. The third set of stories renders mature life. Two of the stories show unhappy married men who at the end of the tale terrify their own offspring; in the next pair of stories a celibate woman keeps our sympathy while a celibate man loses it. Public life in Dublin is shown in the fourth set of stories, the petty world of politics, the petty world of artistes, and then the petty world of business-oriented religion. In all four sets, heroes (or anti-heroes) are those, as Propp says, whose intentions create the axis of the narrative. These Dubliners create Dublin. Their support has created and continues to create the Church, although individuals?even official representatives of that Church like Father Flynn-may have their chalices broken. Their political weakness issues from neo-partisans' committee rooms not as the report of bullets but of stout bottle corks. The institution of marriage brutalizes men who in turn brutalize their wives and children. The institution of celibacy leaves one outcast from life's feast. In the last story, "The Dead," though Joyce had discovered and come to value Irish hospitality and other native virtues, and no longer sees European culture as a cure-all for Irish failings so that in certain ways "The Dead" reverses the messages of some of the stories that lead up to it, there still is an ironic tone. But this will be discussed at the proper time. 417</page><page sequence="4">For now, since the pattern of many of the tales is similar, one may choose the following few for closer, Proppian analysis: the first story, "The Sisters"; three from the middle, "Two Gallants," "Counter parts," and "Clay"; the final story in the earlier design, "Grace"; and the true final tale "The Dead." i. Opening Tale: "The Sisters" Some member of a family absents himself from home: this is the first of a tale's thirty-one functions, according to Propp.8 In "The Sisters," who have been the constituents of the dying priest's family? Ob vious members are the man of God's two sisters Eliza and Nannie. Less obvious is the tale's boy narrator, Father Flynn's prot?g? and hence son. Along with old Nannie with her run-down heels and muttering, and along with old Eliza with her bad grammar, the boy has helped constitute the priest's family, which makes poignant and incestuous the hints of homosexuality in the disturbed priest. Death is the dispatcher in the connective incident. Death sends off the boy hero on his search to understand Father Flynn's secret. The false hero in this tale is the altar boy who dropped and broke the chalice, the cracking of which upset the priest sufficiently to com mence his madness. What is the sought-for object or person in this tale? Knowledge. Understanding. A possible vocation for the boy. "My uncle explained to old Cotter. -The youngster and he [Father Flynn] were great friends. The old chap taught him a great deal, mind you; and they say he had a great wish for him" (D10). Yet doubt is cast by the boy's family on what the priest is teaching the child. Old Cotter looked at me for a while.... -I wouldn't like children of mine, he said, to have too much to say to a man like that -How do you mean, Mr. Cotter? asked my aunt. -What I mean is, said old Cotter, it's bad for children. My idea is: let a young lad run about and play with young lads of his own age and not be .. Am I right, Jack? (D 10) The priest has been the boy's donor. He has been giving the boy learning, as magical agent or helper. This benefit is close to the sought for object itself in this tale, knowledge. Yet knowledge, helper, of what, to what? Strangely, the knowledge given the boy is suspect, as is the priest himself, although the boy does not grasp why. When the child sees the death notice on Father Flynn's door, he is annoyed to discover that rather than a mourning mood, a sensation of freedom is his response. Why, he wonders, 418</page><page sequence="5">for, as my uncle had said the night before, he had taught me a great deal. He had studied m the Irish college in Rome and he had taught me to pronounce Latin properly He had taught me stories about the catacombs and about Napoleon Bonaparte, and he had explained to me the meaning of the different ceremonies of the Mass. (D 12-13) But the priest had taught the boy more, and this of a superstitious sort, teaching that links up later in the story with the revelation of the priest's madness. His question showed me how complex and mysterious were certain institu tions of the Church which I had always regarded as the simplest acts. The duties of the priest towards the Eucharist and towards the secrecy of the confessional seemed so grave to me that I wondered how anybody had ever found in himself the courage to undertake them. (D 13) Now indirectly to the reader is revealed part of the nature of the villain in this tale. By definition, the villain is he who struggles with the hero, and now doubt is shown to be the villain with which the priest and prot?g? must fight. The nature of Father Flynn's struggle is unclear; it is involved with a broken chalice, hence some flaw in the symbol of religious faith, and yet there is another dimension, and one so strong that the boy recognizes it unconsciously and is haunted by it. Hints of possible sexual perversion, at least uncon sciously, in Father Flynn surface in the narrative here and there. "When he smiled he used to uncover his big discoloured teeth and let his tongue lie upon his lower lip - a habit which had made me feel uneasy in the beginning of our acquaintance before I knew him well" (D13). The boy dreams of the priest. "But the grey face still followed me. It murmured; and I understood that it desired to confess some thing. I felt my soul receding into some pleasant and vicious region; and there again I found it waiting for me" (D11). Now the sacrament of confession is in the boy's power; the child and priest have reversed roles. It began to confess to me in a murmuring voice and I wondered why it smiled continually and why the lips were so moist with spittle. But then I remembered that it had died of paralysis and I felt that I too was smiling feebly as if to absolve the simoniac of his sin. (D 11, italics mine) In the opening paragraph of the tale the boy has told us that he does not know what the words paralysis and simony mean, but that simony had sounded to him like the name of "some maleficent and sinful being," one that filled him with fear. The priest is physically clumsy and disgusting; he cannot handle his snuff nor his large 419</page><page sequence="6">trembling hand. But more than this is implied. The boy is sensing, one feels, more: something darker and sexual. After the priest's death the boy remembers his dream of the priest with his face asking for absolution for unnamed sin. As I walked along in the sun I remembered old Cotter's words and tried to remember what had happened afterwards in the dream. I remembered that I had noticed long velvet curtains and a swinging lamp of antique fashion. I felt that I had been very far away, in some land where the customs were strange ? in Persia, I thought.... But I could not remember the end of the dream. (D 13-14) The boy could not remember or understand the dream's exotic, forbidden reference. Nor could he grasp why he had been upset by the priest's smilingly uncovering his tongue and letting it lie upon his lower lip. One is sure that the boy did not grasp this message consciously; one is fairly confident that Father Flynn did not under stand his own message either, but that perhaps some unconscious pressure of physical love for the boy might have sent that message of sexual invitation, a tongue offered signifying exposure of something even more intimate. Such dark confused yearning might have been part of the cause of the priest's madness, of his sense that the dropped chalice had mystic meaning. The sinister side of knowl edge can, to a romantic idealistic spirit such as Father Flynn's, be too much. It was too much for poor Father Flynn and too much for his sensitive pupil. The priest's figure, so diminished at tale's end, is pathetic, heartbreaking. -He was too scrupulous always_The duties of the priesthood was too much for him. And then his life was, you might say, crossed. ?Yes, said my aunt. He was a disappointed man. You could see that. (D17) This opening story of Dubliners ends with a terrible punishment of the villain, doubt, as it has taken possession of the priest, who also functioned in this tale as the donor of knowledge. ? It was that chalice he broke.... ?That affected his mind.... After that he began to mope by himself, talking to no one and wandering about by himself. So one night he was wanted for to go on a call and they couldn't find him anywhere.... So then the clerk suggested to try the chapel-And what do you think but there he was, sitting up by himself in the dark in his confession-box, wide-awake and laughing-like softly to himself-So then, of course, when they saw that, that made them think that there was something gone wrong with him. (D 17-18) 420</page><page sequence="7">The Proppian function punishment is often omitted in tales, but it is essential to the story of Father Flynn. Madness was a strong, cruel punishment indeed for the vulnerable Dubliner, victim of his own church, his own superstition, and his own unsatisfied needs and human weaknesses. ii. Middle Stories: "Two Gallants," "Counterparts," "Clay" According to Propp, villainy in stories stems from either external causes (A) or from a lack (a) in the hero. In all the tales of Dubliners, the Dublin environment has committed crimes against the inhabi tants, and there is lack in the people themselves. The lack in the heroes (or anti-heroes, still the protagonists and not to be confused with Propp's designation false heroes) may have a wide range, es pecially in ironic modern tales such as Dubliners. The lack in "Two Gallants" and "Counterparts" is quite different from the lack in "Clay." Men in the first two tales lack humanity, the m?k of the kindness humans expect of humans. "Clay"'s heroine does not lack kindness and judgment at all; her lack is not inner, but outer, Dublin's villainy causing lack of opportunity for the love she wishes to give a mate or children but which she gives, nonetheless, to those about her. In "The Sisters" there were unflattering portraits of Father Flynn dribbling his tobacco; so too in "Clay," Maria is unflatteringly described as having her very long nose meet her chin in witchlike fashion when she laughs. The priest and the spinster, however, are given compensating qualities to offset the negative ones, Father Flynn shown at least briefly as having once been a genuinely learned person and Maria, as she stands before her mirror regarding herself, a woman with a sweet, trim, lovable little body. In "Two Gallants" and "Counterparts," in contrast, no relief offsets unloveliness. Here Dublin citizens match the ugliness, low spiritual level, and coarseness of the institutions of their brown city Joyce's humanity and forgiveness towards Ireland that will fleetingly reveal itself at the end of Dubliners finds no embryonic form here. Here Joyce is cruel as narrator, and the narrative techniques he uses slip by Proppian analysis in some ways, refusing to give entry into the tales' meaning and illustrating why Propp extended his simple form-structure studies to encompass cultural realities lying behind the syntagmatic line. The slavey in "Two Gallants," for example, who ironically functions as donor to the two characterless men by giving them the gold coin, money, magical agent in Dublin's petty bourgeois world, is painted in mocking tones. One must be aware of dress codes, for example, to understand that Joyce is ridiculing the 421</page><page sequence="8">woman's horrible taste, although the last few lines painting home liness through blunt features, broad nostrils, straggling leering mouth, and buck teeth are plain enough in any culture: She had her Sunday finery on. Her blue serge skirt was held at the waist by a belt of black leather. The great silver buckle of her belt seemed to depress the centre of her body, catching the light stuff of her white blouse like a clip. She wore a short black jacket with mother-of-pearl buttons and a ragged black boa. The ends of her tulle collarette had been carefully disordered and a big bunch of red flowers was pinned in her bosom, stems upwards. Lenehan's eyes noted approvingly her stout short muscular body. Frank rude health glowed in her face, on her fat red cheeks and in her unabashed blue eyes. Her features were blunt. She had broad nostrils, a straggling mouth which lay open in a con tented leer, and two projecting front teeth. (D 55-56) This is no woman; bad taste and stupidity have dehumanized her; this is a grotesquely dressed-up pig. Yet for that very reason of having been dehumanized here, the slavey has an element of latent comedy in her. She is almost (heaven and Joyce forgive me) a Miss Piggy of the Muppets. Perhaps both slavey and Miss Piggy are folktale figures, caricatures of "woman" laughable because she is not beautiful but physically repulsive. Farce enters here, surprisingly, so that in the end 'Two Gallants" is not as unremittingly dark as "Counterparts." In "Counterparts" what is possibly the lowest portrayal of a Dub liner is given. When the office worker arrives home sullen-faced, full of smoldering anger and vengefulness, humiliated and discon tented, his job lost, his watch pawned, his money all gone, his reputation as a strong man destroyed, his sexual prowess insulted, his thirst for drink upon him all over again-at that moment Far rington is ready to reach the bottom, and he soon does. He finds no dinner, the lamp unlit, the fire out, his wife whom he might have found relief in bullying unavailable since she is at chapel. Only one of his five children is up, a small boy who in fright tells his father that he will cook his dinner for him. The father bullied by life does not miss his chance to bully someone, even his own child, in turn. Seizing his pretext, the fire's being out so that the child's cooking dinner for him is impossible, he grasps his walking-stick. - I'll teach you to let the fire out! he said, rolling up his sleeve in order to give his arm free play. The little boy cried O, pa! and ran whimpering round the table, but the man followed him and caught him by the coat. The little boy looked about him wildly but, seeing no way of escape, fell upon his knees. (D 98) 422</page><page sequence="9">Propp's function punishment, supposedly of a villain, here illustrates graphically how Joyce is using Propp's functions in complete rever sal, in thorough irony, at times: -Now, you'll let the fire out the next time! said the man, striking at him viciously with the stick. Take that, you little whelp! The boy uttered a squeal of pain as the stick cut his thigh. He clasped his hands together in the air and his voice shook with fright. ?O, pa! he cried. Don't beat me, pa! And I'll.. .Ill say a Hail Mary for you-I'll say a Had Mary for you, pa, if you don't beat me-111 say a Hail Mary. (D 98) Pathos here is too strong to allow to come through the comic foolishness of the child's attempt to bribe his punishing father. That father, head of the ancient institution of the human family, is its god. The Biblical God, in turn, is in part an anthropomorphic projection of this power-figure in the human family. Here Farrington's child's attempt to bribe the male divinity with a prayer to another divinity, projection of the human mother who is, ironically, off at chapel praying to the male divinity, is a satire of modernism, penetration of which requires knowledge of the specific cultural codes operating for fullest effect, but is generally accessible even without that. Portrayals of cruel parents beating their children?or otherwise mistreating them, such as making them do harsh tasks or abandon ing them?run all through fairy and folk tales; they are standard, automatic practice with stepfathers and stepmothers. Similarly, the cruel description of the slavey in 'Two Gallants" resembles many an ugly princess who operates as false hero or villain in the tale. The stepmothers and stepsisters in "Cinderella" operate as false heroes, contrasting with, and paving the way for, the true hero. In "Counter parts," confusion between not false hero and true hero but true hero and anti-hero reveal common practice in early picaresque and in today's fiction in the cynicism and disillusion they express. The pathos alluded to in the scene of child-beating in which the child uses a religious helper, a prayer, as an attempted bribe in the hope of saving himself, seems by its irony and mockery and even latently farcical overtones, a strictly modern literary device at first, yet it is not. Laughter, latent or overt, has deep ramifications. And as I have already mentioned, Propp in treating folklore phenomena, after arduous initial studies of form and structure in the strictest manner, finally abandoned that approach and instead dealt more broadly with the affinities that exist between the fairy tale and religion (myth and ritual) and social institutions at different levels of their evolution. A more speci?c folklore 423</page><page sequence="10">phenomenon is treated by him in a study of ritual laughter where he shows that ritual laughter in the folktale for instance, often understood as an ex pression of a purely secular fun, is, m fact, ntuahstically linked with myth and mcantational magic 9 Laughter in "Clay" is in this same rich, loaded mode, but in another, subjective mode as well. Maria the heroine laughs several times in the tale but always hollowly, hiding her embarrassment, for her laughter is usually in reference to hidden desires for a mate threatened with exposure by teasing, either by people or by fate's offering symbolic hope, as with the barmbrack's ring or with the saucers in the prophecy game. "Clay" takes place on Hallow Eve, and critics have speculated about whether Maria is intended to represent a witch, given her tiny body and occasionally bizarre appearance when her customarily nasal speaking tones become a cackle, and long nose meets chin as the minute form shakes and quakes in embarrassed laughter. Propp can help here, as well as can the history of this particular tale. In original versions the title was "Christmas Eve."10 From this one can conclude that drawing a heroine-witch was not Joyce's early inten tion; instead, the constant is holiday/holyday Maria functions in "Clay" as an angel, not a witch, but the Hallow Eve festival, one predating the Christian one and allowing us to concentrate on the pagan, superstitious aspect of religion as well as the usual Christian symbolism, doubles the tale's power. In any case, as Proppian analy sis reminds us, the festive occasion acts as dispatcher, as connective incident which sends the hero(ine) forth on a quest to overcome her lack of a true home and lover. Hallow Eve as a time-condition provides this tale with possibilities of magical agents peculiar to this holiday alone. There is that barm brack already alluded to, a cake baked with a ring inside it, and whichever eater of the great cake finds the ring in her piece will be, supposedly, imminently facing her wedding. There are also the saucers in a game involving symbols which provide a fuller range of predictions for one's future. The title of the story itself refers to one of these saucer symbols, the forbidden one. In this case "clay" signifies the wet dust-to-dust of the dread significant Death itself. Christian iconographies com pete with the pagan, however, in this rich tale. The tiny heroine of "Clay" embodies many hints of the marvelous. Some critics wish her to represent Ireland herself as a wizened old woman, something like the milk woman in Ulysses. Others see in the chaste peacemaker 424</page><page sequence="11">Maria who soothes and calms and in effect nurses Dublin's fallen women a signal for the Blessed Virgin Mary herself-Maria/Mary Both Christian and pagan references find support in the place where Maria works. The Dublin-by-Lamplight laundry presided over by a self-righteous Board of Protestant ladies and staffed by the fallen women of the city: here is Purgatory, here is Hell, in which Maria walks like a sacred figure within a fiery furnace, unscathed. Or one can see the pitiful laundry as an evil witches' coven wherein Maria, protected by chastity and goodness, presides, distributing one night a year the magical cake she has cut with her own hands to the "common" (D101) sexually unclean women who enter from their bonfire wiping steaming hands on petticoats and pulling down sleeves of their blouses over red steaming arms, loudly laughing and joking and possibly making obscene remarks against which Maria will protect herself by a mantle of ignorance, the same mantle she will throw over herself later in her struggle with Death when she chooses the fatal saucer. One must protect oneself against such wide-ranging comments and return to the help Propp affords us in these tales. A diagram ming of "Clay" according to its functions reads something like this: (struggles (difficult task (Preparatory section) &amp; overcomes) &amp; completion) a1 T B C? (DEF G fH JI K M N Q Ex (No) W? (trebling DEF G CH J1 K of tasks) ( D E F ? G MW* T by implication) (trebling ("DEF of tasks) DEF (DEF G In the preparatory section Maria serves the barmbrack to the women and after this task has the matron's permission to be gone this evening. Discovery of Maria's lack (a1), that highly important story function, occurs when the women tease Maria about being the lucky one to get the barmbrack ring prophesying marriage, and we learn Maria's secret longing through her laughing with disappointed shyness and her unconvincing insistence that she "didn't want any ring or man either" (D 101). Now we can understand the stress on Maria's laughing when she is embarrassed. When she laughs shak ing her shoulders so hard it is a form of crying; moreover, the function of branding could be said to enter here since Maria blushes too when she laughs, a common metaphor for branding. ay2SeSn2? 425</page><page sequence="12">Characters and functions are in greater flux in preparatory sec tions than in later portions of the narrative, but we do easily see here when Maria takes out her purse, her magical agent, helper, Maria's means of coping with her forced independence. This helper, we are told, was given Maria by donor Joe -donor here and later, but also a sought-for object, prince, as we will see later. Joe had given Maria the talisman after a trip with his brother Alphy five years earlier when the two were still friends, a time Maria looks back to with longing. The story's initial situation, "Some member of a family absents himself from home" is revealed in the next few paragraphs when we learn that Maria had been nurse to Joe and Alphy when she lived happily in their home before a break-up brought Maria to her pres ent uncongenial environment. One can easily see from perusal of the syntagmatic functions Propp's much-mentioned trebling in the tests Maria undergoes. In the f?rst set in her search for magical agents to make herself loved she first buys cakes for the children, then buys plumcake after so much hesitation the clerk accuses her of wanting wedding cake (which is precisely what she does want, of course). In the third test, her search for a seat on the tram, a symbolic seat, a place, the wonderful occurrence happens. The donor mustached gentleman gives Maria a sought-for object, a seat, and he talks to her so sweetly that we have implicitly a wedding (W*) with the prince and a new home. We also have transfiguration (T) in the description of Maria's walking along happily in the rain, her head tilted, her mind dwelling joyfully on the gentleman even though he "has a drop taken" (D 103). The wedding scene or dream is ironic; in a moment we learn that Maria has left behind her plumcake (wedding cake); and joy, in Joyce's Dublin, as usual turns into distress. Before going on to discuss the second trebling of events I will go back a moment to speak of the first transfiguration that Maria experi ences in the tale. When Maria dresses herself for her evening out and pauses before her mirror to survey her still-girlish and attractive body, we see Maria as she would be seen always, were fate kinder. These stories in Dubliners are full of transfigurations and transfor mations. I found one in every single tale. Sometimes they coincide with Joyce's famous "epiphanies," sometimes not. But they are a marvelously economical and moving means of characterization. In the second set of triplets of tasks for Maria she gives the children the cakes and receives thanks in the first task; she cannot find the plumcake and is in distress, but is rescued by Joe who gives her a seat (like the gentleman on the tram, who was a surrogate for 426</page><page sequence="13">Joe or vice-versa); she is offered nuts by the neighbor girls but no nutcracker, but again Joe rescues her by giving her a seat by the fire, a drink, and pleasant talk. In all these tests the tripling draws on the narrative code we learned as children, and Joyce does not have to say "Maria is looking for assurance that she is welcome, and yes, here she found it, and yes, here she found it," etc. Nor does he have to tell us that the tram lover and Joe represent the same thing, lover, to Maria. Propp's enabling us to isolate the methods by which Joyce tells us his meaning without telling us directly is, as I contend, of great value. Understatement and indirection assist us again with the struggles and outcomes. In the first, Maria puts in a good word for Alphy which angers Joe. Maria is wounded, hurt (branded in her struggle with villain, Joe's anger), but Joe overcomes his bad temper. In the second, and chief, struggle, Maria gets the clay (negative magical agent as well as brand, wound) in her struggle with the two neighbor girls representing both bad donors and, chiefly, villain; but she ulti mately wins the struggle (ironically) by being given a face-saving prayerbook (good magical agent) and by adopting her pose of igno rance towards life's cruelties. The high point of the tale, an ironic point, is (K), lack is liquidated, when after the clay incident Joe is nicer to Maria than he has ever been in his life. From now on the story concludes rapidly with difficult task and completion (M) (N) as Maria must sing and does. Recognition of her true value and exposure of her loneliness cause Joe and his wife to be much moved, especially Joe, who reveals his appreciation of the old times with Maria and his temporarily estranged brother, but the expression of feeling is mocked by the little he can do with his emotion: "his eyes filled up so much with tears that he could not find what he was looking for and in the end he had to ask his wife to tell him where the corkscrew was" (D 106). Maria's wedding and return home here, as on the tram, are a dream only, existing as Proppian function only in the negative-Joyce's message about the lot of the female celibate, one he made earlier in the tale of another female celibate, Eveline. iii. Penultimate Tale: "Grace" "Grace," Dubliners' fourteenth story, boasts a hero who ranks as an alcoholic, a failure in some ways, but a "gentleman": Mr Kernan was a commercial traveller of the old school which believed in the dignity of its calling. He had never been seen in the city without a silk hat of 427</page><page sequence="14">some decency and a pair of gaiters Modern business methods had spared him only so far as to allow him a little office in Crowe Street [but] Mr Kernan's decline was mitigated by the fact that certain of those friends who had known him at his highest point of success still esteemed him as a char acter (D 153-54) Mr. Kernan's fall down the stairs from the bar at which he had gotten drunk is the Proppian connective incident precipitating our hero's search. It is a fairly passive search, one made at the instigation of his businessmen friends, for God's grace. Irony is heavy here. Donor of God's grace is Father Purdon, giver of the sermon at the retreat to which Mr. Kernan is brought. "Purdon" is possibly a pun on "pardon," what Mr. Kernan needs if he is to receive the gift, sought-for object, God's grace, which the priest's quite unchristian, businessman-oriented sermon recommends. The entire story is parody. The ironic villain, supposedly Mr. Kernan's disbelief, is laughable in terms of the true problem the man has, and the true problem all these shabby, self-deluding gentlemen have, alcoholism. False hero Mr. Cunningham, who leads the move ment to the retreat and supposed conversion to true Catholicism of the tongue-wounded (branded) Mr. Kernan, explains to his bedrid den friend, over drinks, the doctrine of Papal infallibility in a scene of mute mockery. The ridiculously unelevating sermon should be laughed right out of church, even one in which belief in banshees is put on a level with belief in the Holy Ghost, as it is in the mind of a relatively "staunch" Catholic, Mrs. Kernan. Mr. Kernan struggles for integrity of belief by helplessly waving his hands to indicate that, if he is to yield on the retreat and on the confession business, he at least wants to bar the candles. To go from the seriousness and suffering behind "The Sisters" to this present farcical parodying of the Church is to experience a sea change indeed. That Joyce intended a parody here is documented.11 Mr. Kernan's fall down the stairs to the lavatory was Dante's fall into the Inferno. When Mr. Kernan's friends visit him in his bedroom at home, Purgatory is mirrored. And the vision offered Mr. Kernan in his church seat at the retreat can be nothing but the Great Light in Paradise. Joyce's tone towards Dublin and her institutions has traveled from somber and brown to the orange threat of comic ridicule. Dubliners' first twelve tales had irony, granted, but they did not have so strongly the farcical elements that enter the spirit of "Ivy Day in the Committee Room" with its talking corks (Pok! they say, Pok!) and "sentimentally-stirring" poem. 428</page><page sequence="15">iv. Final Tale: "The Dead" As in the other stories, the very identification of the family from which some member absents himself in the initial situation, proves helpful in approaching meaning. Here not only his wife Gretta and his children but Ireland itself is the family from which the hero Gabriel has been absenting himself periodically in favor of Europe and its supposedly superior culture. Again the sought-for ob ject is knowledge, understanding. Additionally, the old fairy-tale sought-for object, the princess, beckons in the form of Gretta, Gabriel's own wife, she who has come from Galway, Ireland's wilder, truer, richer self with whom Gretta's figure merges. The connective inci dent which sets hero Gabriel out on his search, unwittingly at first, is the annual dance of Gabriel's relatives, the two elderly Misses Morkan who, with their niece Mary Jane, form a human parody of the three graces or the three fates, tying this tale back to Dubliners' first. There "The Sisters" of the title can refer to Father Flynn's two actual sisters or it can refer to the three weird sisters, the fates of mythology. "The Dead" is rich in symbolism, and women are important sym bols indeed. "Lily" is the very first word of the story. Lily is the caretaker's daughter literally and figuratively too, woman being caretaker of both life and death. Gretta similarly is linked with high nature, with wild beauty and passion, with sexual love of a roman tically divine, Dionysian-suffering sort. The one woman in the story whose intellect matches Gabriel's is Molly Ivors, Gabriel's anima. She has had an education comparable to his and she too now teaches, but Miss Ivors has not turned traitor to the hospitality of Ireland, to its native language and wild promise. She chides Gabriel for traitorously worshipping false European gods, and she gives him a chance to discover the west of Ireland and at the same time to give his wife the joy of a return to her native haunts. Gabriel, of course, will not consider this move. He must, as he always does, reject his wife's company and the west of Ireland for his bicycling male friends and the chance to keep up with European changes in language and such other valuable innovations as the galoshes Gretta mildly ridicules. Miss Ivors' first name is Molly, as will be the name of Molly Bloom; Molly is also moly, a legendary herb possess ing magical power. Offended by Gabriel's blind vanity and pride, Miss Ivors offers Gabriel the magical agent, "insight," which by story's end he will have acquired much more painfully, but Miss Ivors leaves the party early and is not given the chance to function for mally as a donor. 429</page><page sequence="16">We are back to identifying character-functions, then, as a means of grasping more fully the intent of this story. Who is the false hero! Since the false hero plays a role similar to the hero's but is not the true axis of the narrative, Michael Furey, Gretta's earlier lover who died for her, must represent this function. Here the story is indeed rich, made the richer not only by the symbolism involved but because Michael's function is not single. He also plays, besides the role of Gabriel's rival, another aspect of the sought-for object, being, like Gretta and Lily and Molly, a part of nature because of his passion for Gretta. Christ himself as death/life, and Osiris, and all gods killed but resurrected, lie here. "Michael" is also the name of one of Christianity's archangels, as is the name "Gabriel." Michael is the avenging archangel; and that Joyce had this in mind seems indis putable by his adding the surname "Furey" to this character. Gabriel is the messenger archangel, he who allegedly brought God's mes sage of fruitfulness to the Blessed Virgin Mary, words offered by a child as a bribe in "Counterparts": "Hail Mary, full of grace; the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus." In "The Dead" Gabriel may perform an arch angel's function by bringing to us, at story's end, his message involv ing home and life's passion?beauty and nature's snow?but within the earlier portions of the tale, Gabriel, fatuous and proud and narcissistic, cannot bear the messages of furious, glorious love that the child-lover Michael can. Gabriel's discovery of this fact is what painfully, but ultimately healingly awakens him to true self knowledge and knowledge of the power of nature itself over human learning and institutions, including here, marriage. Who behaves as villain in "The Dead"? The villain's role is to struggle with the hero, by definition. And there is a crucial scene in "The Dead" in which the hero Gabriel struggles with, and finally recognizes, the villain: Gabriel, thinking that Gretta has been feeling towards him the same erotic desires he experiences for her, asks her confidently what she is thinking about. To his surprise, she con fesses that not Gabriel but a song has been on her mind. Worse yet for Gabriel, his continued questions bring forth the information that she is thinking of the person who used to sing that song long ago in Galway Gabriel felt humiliated by... the evocation of this figure from the dead, a boy in the gasworks_A shameful consciousness of his own person assailed him. He saw himself as a ludicrous figure-Instinctively he turned his back more to the light lest she might see the shame that burned on his forehead. (D 219-20) 430</page><page sequence="17">Branded in the struggle with the villain, Gabriel must now ac knowledge his excessive pride, his narcissism, and his inadequate behavior towards his wife and others. He thought of how she who lay beside him had locked m her heart for so many years that image of her lover's eyes when he had told her that he did not wish to live. Generous tears filled Gabriel's eyes. He had never felt like that himself towards any woman but he knew that such a feeling must be love (D 223) Gabriel's lack is identified, and with this discovery he is freed from his former errors. A few light taps upon the pane made him turn to the window. It had begun to snow again.... The time had come for him to set out on his journey westward. Yes, the newspapers were right: snow was general all over Ireland. (D 223) A Dubliner has finally broken Dublin's brown spell. Nature's deaths, nature's elements like snow, nature's wild treasures like Ireland's west, women, and lovers like Michael Furey are now admit ted into Gabriel's picture of life, and the magical agent, wisdom, becomes his-and ours-at story's, stories', end. His soul swooned softly as he heard the snow falling faintly through the universe and faintly falling, like the descent of their last end, upon all the living and the dead.

Walton Litz (New York: Viking Press, 1969), pp. 316-32. 4 Propp, p. 478. 5 Dundes, p. xiv. 6 Propp defines "function" technically: "Function is understood as an act of a character, defined from the point of view of its significance for the course of the action" (p. 21). It is the functions of characters-not the various characters them selves?which serve as predictable elements in a tale and constitute its basic compo nents, so that a single axis underlies all fairy tales (p. 23). In his chapter on "The Distribution of Functions Among Dramatis Personae" (pp. 79-80), Propp lists the seven "spheres of action" present in all tales: - Villain's. Constituents, villainy (A) [and (a)], some form of struggle with the hero (H); pursuit (Pr). 431</page><page sequence="18">-Donor's (provider's). Constituents: the preparation for transmission of a magical agent (D); provision of hero with a magical agent (F). -Helper's. Constituents: spatial transference of hero (G); liquidation of misfortune or lack (K); rescue from pursuit (Rs); solution of difficult tasks (N); transfiguration of hero (T). -Princess's (sought-for person's) and her father's. Constituents: assignment of diffi cult tasks (M); branding (J); exposure (Ex); recognition (Q); punishment of a second villain (U); marriage (W). Princess and her father tend to merge as functions; usually the father is the assigner of difficult tasks due to hostile feelings towards the suitor, and he also often punishes the false hero. -Dispatcher's. Constituent: dispatch (connective incident, B). -Hero's. Constituents: departure on a search (Ct); reaction to demands of donor (E); wedding (W*). The first function (C) is characteristic of the seeker-hero; the victim-hero performs only the remaining functions. -False hero's. Also includes Ct, followed by E and, as a specific function, L. The functions in the preparatory section i?, y, ?, e, f, r?, 6) are also distributed among the same characters, but the distribution here is unequal, says Propp, making the definition of the characters impossible by these functions. 7 Scholes and Litz, p. 1. 8 On pp. 25-65, Propp presents the functions of the dramatis personae in the order dictated by the form of the tale itself. Following is my shorthand version of this: Initial situation: the members of a family (group) are enumerated, or the future hero is introduced by mention of his name or status (a). 1) A member of a family absents himself from home (absentation, ?). 2) An interdiction is addressed to the hero (interdiction, y). 3) The interdiction is violated (violation, &amp;). 4) The villain attempts reconnaissance (reconnaissance, e). 5) Villain receives information about his victim (delivery, ?) 6) Villain tries to deceive his victim (trickery, r?). 7) Victim, deceived, unwittingly aids his enemy (complicity, 6). 8)* Villain causes harm to a member of a family (villainy, A)-or, 8a)* A family member lacks or desires something (lack, a). 9) Misfortune or lack is made known; hero is let go or dispatched (mediation, the connective incident, B). 10) The seeker decides to counter (beginning counteraction, C). 11) Hero leaves home (departure, t). 12) Hero is tested or attacked, preparing the way for his receiving either a magical agent or helper (first function of donor, D). 13) Hero reacts to actions of the future donor (hero's reaction, E). 14) Hero acquires use of a magical agent (receipt of magical agent, F). 15) Hero is moved to location of an object of search (spatial transference between two kingdoms, guidance, G). 16) Hero and villain join in direct combat (struggle, H). 17) Hero is branded (branding, marking, J). 18) Villain is defeated (victory, I). 19)* The initial misfortune or lack is liquidated (misfortune liquidated, K) [with villainy (A) this constitutes a pair; peak action here]. 20) Hero returns (return, i). 21) Hero is pursued (pursuit, Pr). 22) Rescue of hero from pursuit (rescue, Rs). 432</page><page sequence="19">23) Hero, unrecognized, arrives home or elsewhere (unrecognized arrival, O). 24) A false hero presents unfounded claims (unfounded claims, L). 25) A difficult task is proposed to hero (difficult task, M). 26) Task is resolved (solution, N). 27) Hero is recognized (recognition, Q). 28) False hero or villain is exposed (exposure, Ex). 29) Hero is given a new appearance (transfiguration, T). 30) Villain is punished (punishment, U). 31) Hero is married and ascends the throne (wedding, W). 9 Svatava Pirkova-Jakobson, Introduction to the first edition of Propp's Mor phology, 1958, p. xxi. 10 Scholes and Litz, p. 483. 11 Scholes and Litz, p. 495. 433</page></plain_text>
