<plain_text><page sequence="1">Turtle Tears and Captive Appetites: The Problem of White Desire in the Caribbean Heidi Oberholtzer Lee In the last two decades, scholars of racial history have pointed out that the category of race as it developed in the nineteenth century did not yet exist in that form in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.1 Early modem Europeans envisioned their differences as defined not necessarily by race but, rather, by other oppositional qualities-for example, the holy and the heretical, the civilized and the savage, or, arguably the most important cat- egory in the eighteenth century, the free and the enslaved.2 In this article, I examine this third construction of early modem differentiation-the free and the enslaved. I argue that Anglo-Caribbean travel writing demon- strates the development of a proto-racial, proto-abolitionist hermeneutic of appetite by which travel writers code slave rebellion and white power through tropes of culinary violence. I assert that, while race did not yet exist as a physiological category in the early modem period, the physio- logical category of appetite certainly did, and early modern travel writers relied on this category to position themselves against or alongside the Africans whom they encountered. Though for a time racial discourse coin- cides with and then eventually supplants appetitive language as the pri- mary mode for expressing physiological differentiation, during the early modem period a rhetoric of gastronomy serves as the dominant and most significant form for expressing the bodily differences and similarities be- tween slave and free.

Most white Anglo-Caribbean travelers had the freedom to se- lect their destinations, as well as what they would do or what they would eat upon their arrival at their new locations. They believed mobility to be a defining characteristic of their white, civilized selves. Slavery and cap- tivity, however, disrupted and troubled this assumed relationship between travel and freedom of mobility or freedom of culinary choice, and white Anglo-Caribbean travel authors repeatedly returned in their writing to the idea of restricted movement to work out their anxieties about the problems of enslavement. If their travels personally involved them in enslavement, they wondered how they could maintain the distinctions they had tradi- tionally made between themselves as a civilized people and others as bar- barians. If made captives themselves, they found they often shared the same destinations, lifestyles, and culinary choices as their captors. Their restricted travel and limited choices precluded their ability to distinguish themselves from their captors simply on the basis of their mobility and freedom. Or, if they freely chose to travel to the Caribbean, where slavery so dominated the culture and economy that they could not fail to acknowl- edge its presence, they again found themselves implicated in the restric- tion of movement, in this case the movement of slaves. They might travel to the Caribbean on ships that held chained slaves or live in communities where slave codes defined when, how, and to where slaves could travel. Moreover, not only travel writers but also European travel readers could not avoid experiencing through their reading a degree of proximity to the institution of slavery. Armchair tourists and potential emigrants who read Caribbean natural histories or captivity accounts encountered such vivid portrayals of slavery that they could no longer claim an intellectual or emotional separation from the institution. Travel and travel writing dis- allowed both readers and writers the comfort of a transatlantic distance from the enslavement of black bodies. Caribbean writing made clear the argument that slavery was necessary because of white European appetite for sugar, and all saccharine-loving, tea-drinking, comfit-eating readers found themselves and their desire complicit in the institution. These texts of enslavement, therefore, reveal a highly developed hermeneutic of ap- petite by which authors articulate their fear of slave rebellion, their asser-</page><page sequence="3">Turtle Tears and Captive Appetites 309 tion of their own power, and their concern about the corrupting influence of slavery both upon the slave and the master. Doubting Their Diets: Richard Ligon, Thomas Trapham, and Charles-Ctsar comte de Rochefort Embedded in Anglo-Caribbean travelers' and particularly captives' ac- counts of island death and sickness, and nestled in their pleas for greater planter education, adaptation, and self-restraint, is a discernible fear that the practice of slaveholding might actually be the source of plantation dis- ease and Anglo decline. Already in the seventeenth and eighteenth cen- turies, we see evidence of growing Anglo concern that slavery might not be merely a source of moral degradation but of physical degradation as well. This fear surfaces in a hermeneutic of food through which these is- land writers record their encounters with New World slavery. Literary crit- ics Wendy Wall and Natasha Korda both point out that the early modem stage becomes a site where dramatists engage with growing British anxi- ety about the transformation of the domestic sphere, regularly cited as a microcosm for the nation as a whole. They point out the significance of dramatic presentation of kitchens, foods, and cooking as a means by which early modem men voiced their concerns about their own ability to maintain control of their homes and, by extension, their country (Korda 52-75). Maintaining social and political control similarly concerned white planters in the early modem Caribbean, where slaves outnumbered the free and where slave rebellion was indeed a very real threat.3 As in the British plays examined by Wall and Korda, a language of food preparation and cooking articulates in Anglo-Caribbean writing significant authorial anxiety about the possibility of social disorder. In the case of these Caribbean texts, vivid narration of culinary violence upon anthropomor- phic animals, particularly upon sharks and turtles, becomes the mode by which authors express their fears of slave rebellion and their dread of the effects that slavery might have upon whites complicit in the institution. Descriptions of meat preparation sometimes allegorize slaves as sharks or turtles, but even more often they speak to the nature of the power relation- ships between masters and slaves. To wield a knife, to inflict pain, or to slaughter a living being represents a degree of power (Scarry 27-59). Anglo-Caribbean authors explore through their language of culinary vio-</page><page sequence="4">310 J N T lence the possibilities of their maintaining power over black bodies, of be- coming corrupted or diseased by that power, and of losing that power to those whom they had enslaved or whom had eventually enslaved them. To seventeenth-century Anglo-Caribbean authors, the anthropomor- phic qualities of turtles made poignant images of these animals particu- larly useful for discussing slavery. Turtles occupied the ambiguous, half- man, half-beast position similarly held by slaves, as well as evoked sympathy, as slaves sometimes did from their masters. Turtles cried in fear before being butchered for food. Richard Ligon, in his A True and Exact History of the Island of Barbadoes (1657), explains that when a turtle "sees you come with a knife in your hand to kill him, he vapours out the grievousest sighs, that ever you heard any creature make, and sheds as large tears as a Stag, that has a far greater body, and larger eyes" (36). While Anglo protest against animal pain did not develop until the nine- teenth century, seventeenth- and eighteenth-century whites expressed great concern that human cruelty toward animals might develop into human cruelty against other humans.4 They worried not that the torture of animals would hurt the animals, but that human habituation to torturing animals might eventually become human habituation to hurting other hu- mans (Steintrager 60-64). Feeling sympathy for animals thus protected humans from hurting themselves and from becoming barbaric, uncivi- lized, or even inhuman. Likewise, feeling sympathy for slaves supposedly registered a necessary humanity among even those who owned slaves. That slave drivers might not feel sympathy for those they whipped caused consternation among seventeenth- and eighteenth-century slave owners, for lack of sympathy might indicate that they were not nearly as civilized and as different from their supposedly "savage" slaves as they had main- tained (Gould 45). Therefore, when Caribbean writers describe emotional displays by angry sharks and crying turtles along with an unemotional or unsympathetic response from the humans slaughtering them, these writers are inherently questioning the civility and humanity of their peers. Out of concern for themselves and their peers and, perhaps, but not necessarily, out of concern for the animals or slaves, they raise questions as to the morality of slavery and its effects upon those whites who participate in the institution. Sharks and turtles also serve Anglo-Caribbean writers as especially ap- propriate animals by which to discuss the slave trade since these creatures</page><page sequence="5">Turtle Tears and Captive Appetites 311 already had an established connection to Caribbean commerce and slav- ery. Sharks purportedly followed slave ships on their transatlantic journeys so that they could eat the bodies of any slaves who might jump overboard or be thrown overboard, dead or alive. They functioned as a reminder of the blood and bodies entailed in the commerce of slavery. Green sea tur- tles, too, importantly represented the Caribbean economy, and Anglo- and Franco-Caribbean writings abound with descriptions of these "fish." Stag- gering numbers of them swam the island waters and came ashore to nest. Their sheer abundance, or what Ligon described as their "infinite num- bers," impressed most island visitors (36). Turtles were to the Caribbean what the vast, roaming herds of buffalo were to the North American Great Plains. They characterized the Caribbean landscape just as the buffalo de- fined the Plains, and they were even easier to slaughter than were the buf- falo. Turtle hunters could simply flip them on their backs, where they would remain immobile but alive for use in future dinners (see fig. 1). Tur- tle fishing and turtle farming also promised profits for fortune hunters since turtle meat fed the sailors and slavers who visited the islands and eventually became a staple for many island residents. The Cayman Is- lands, west of Jamaica, enjoyed the reputation as the turtle capital of the West Indies, and the island of Tortuga, which means "turtle" in Spanish and was so named because of its abundance of turtles, appeared as an entry in a number of seventeenth-century European dictionaries.5 The rep- utation of Caribbean turtles had gained transatlantic notice. By the eigh- teenth century, Samuel Johnson's dictionary listed "turtle" and "turtle- dove" as a combined entry and explained that both words were "used among sailors and gluttons for a tortoise," a tortoise being an "animal cov- ered with a hard shell . . . both of land and water."6 Turtles therefore not only had gained a reputation as animals particularly associated with the Caribbean and its economy but also as animals related to gluttony, thus an especially appropriate image for discussing through culinary language the excesses of Caribbean slaveholding practices. Richard Ligon, in detailing savage acts of cookery, questions the ef- fects of black enslavement upon white bodies and betrays his own anxi- eties about the institution when he interestingly narrates culinary violence against turtles even in the absence of any indigenous turtles on the island where he resides. He explains that the one important "fish wanting to this Island [Barbados], whose kindes are very frequent upon most of the</page><page sequence="6">312 1 N T  Caribbean Sea Turtles</page><page sequence="7">Turtle Tears and Captive Appetites 313 Charibby and Lucaick Islands . . . is the green Turtle, which is the best food the Sea affords." He notes the efficacy of "turning them on their backs with staves, where they lye till they are fetcht away" (36). He then devotes several paragraphs to describing their habits and how to slaughter them. Though elsewhere in his text he brags of his culinary prowess, pro- vides lengthy recipes, and gives detailed advice on the "Art of Cookery," he here focuses his instructions exclusively on capturing and killing tur- tles, not on roasting, boiling, salting, or pickling them (34). He knows that his readers, whether armchair tourists or potential immigrants to Barba- dos, will never encounter these turtles alive on a Barbadian beach. Ligon mentions how to capture and slaughter these turtles, though, because of their association with Caribbean slavery and because they allow him a way to discuss in a more comfortable fashion his fear of gradual white ha- bituation to cruelty. Ligon explains, "When you are to kill one of these fishes, the manner is, to lay him on his back on a table." Ligon then in- vokes the trope of the crying turtle, remarking that at first sight of the knife, the turtle makes "the grievousest sighs" and drops "large tears." Ligon refrains from detailing any personal emotional response to these cries, instead launching into a detailed account of how, exactly, the chef proceeds with the killing. Ligon notes that the turtle "has a joynt or crevis, about an inch within the utmost edge of his shell . .. into which . .. you put your knife, beginning at the head, and so rip up that side, and then do as much to the other." After this, he explains, the butcher should raise the turtle's belly, "lay open all his bowles, and taking them out, come next to his heart." If you remove the heart, Ligon marvels, "and lay it in a dish, it will stir and pant ten hours after the fish is dead" (36). Ligon here shifts to the second-person pronoun, making the reader participate in the bloody deed and watch as the turtle struggles to live for a long ten hours after its disembowelment. He insists on the reader assuming agency for the inflic- tion of pain, for agency represents power, and this description of turtle pain is primarily a discussion of the effects of white power upon white bodies.7 The chef demonstrates no emotion, no pity in response to these tears, and hence a worrisome habituation to cruelty that might ultimately cost him his humanity. Elsewhere in his text, Ligon invokes a language of anthropomorphic animals to warn obliquely of the threat of violent slave rebellion and to recommend ameliorating the worst abuses of slave owners to eliminate</page><page sequence="8">314 J N T this threat. Ligon knows firsthand of slavery's cruel abuses. He had agreed to travel on a slave ship and lived on a five-hundred-acre sugar plantation worked by a hundred slaves (Ligon 22; Morgan 48). He knows, too, of the possibility of slave revenge. Ligon writes, for instance, of the Shark ... a common enemy to Saylers ... for he often bites off Legs, sometimes Armes, and now and then swallows the whole body ... So when the Saylers take them, they use them accordingly: Sometimes by putting out their eyes ... sometimes by mangling and cutting their bodies, finns, and tailes, making them a prey to others, who were merci- less Tyrants themselves; And in this kind of justice they are very Accurate. (5) Ligon writes here of power, tyranny, revenge, and justice. He paints a hor- rific portrait of how one kind of abuse engenders another. He warns slave owners that, if they savagely and bloodily tyrannize their slaves, if they use their bodies cruelly, they might one day be the recipients of a compa- rable savagery. Slave rebellion would allow slaves to practice on their owners the cruelties they had been taught by their own experiences. In a grand reversal of predator and "prey," of "Tyrant" and tyrannized, the master would become the slave. The shark, formerly in a position of great power, must now submit to what Ligon calls the "justice" of torture. The shark had tortured and now is tortured himself. The master had abused his slaves and now can be abused himself. Ligon does not suggest the aboli- tion of slavery, but he betrays his fear that the savage, immoral excesses of the institution will result in a torturous justice exercised upon white masters. Later in his account, Ligon reiterates this warning with vocabulary more explicitly about slave abuse but without the graphic scene of torture that his food images allowed him to imagine and articulate. Ligon explains that a slave rebellion had recently threatened the island. The slaves had de- cided "to fall upon their Masters, and cut all their throats, and by that means, to make themselves [not] only freemen, but Masters of the Island" (45). An informant reported the rumored plot, writes Ligon, and the slave owners executed eighteen men. Ligon reports that many of his fellow Anglo-Caribbeans find it "strange" that the Africans have not yet suc-</page><page sequence="9">Turtle Tears and Captive Appetites 315 ceeded in rebelling in a "bloody" and "horrid massacre" to become "Mas- ters of the Island." After all, he points out, they significantly outnumber the Christians (46). Not ready to advance nor even able to imagine an ar- gument to abolish slavery completely, Ligon instead proposes the amelio- ration of cruel slaveholding practices in order to curb slave desire for jus- tice and mastery and to preserve the lives of slave owners. If owners do not discontinue these abuses, Ligon predicts, the slaves, craving better conditions and power, will initiate a bloodbath of torture, maiming, and slaughter. They had been treated as meat and now will treat others as meat. A bloody justice will reign. If Richard Ligon participated so thoroughly in a culture of slavery, why does his work argue that justice will work on the behalf of slaves? We find an important clue in the final two pages of Ligon's text. He writes, "I am now cast in Prison, by the subtle practices of some ... But the eternal and merciful God has been pleased . . . to raise me up such friends ... in an Age, where cruelties and tryannies are exercised in so high a measure" (121).8 Ligon predicts that God will deliver him and that "when the great Leveller of the world, Death, shall run his progress, all Estates will be laid eeven [sic]" (122). Ligon repeats the words "cruelties" and "tyrannies" to describe imprisonment, the same words he had used in his descriptions of the sharks and sailors and of the slave owners' behavior that had sparked the island rebellion, and he again predicts a deadly, but ultimately just, leveling of power structures. Ligon's own imprisonment apparently sensi- tizes him to the possibility of unjust treatment of those whose bodies are owned, captured, or in the power of others. Ligon's and other Caribbean writers' concern with the human-like qualities of turtles and the immigrants' willingness to consume them un- derscores their fears that the institution of slavery promotes Anglo canni- balism, transforming the civilized into the savage. Like Ligon, Thomas Trapham, M.D., the son of Oliver Cromwell's physician, pauses at the an- thropomorphic or even superhuman qualities of turtles. In his A Discourse of the State of Health in the Island of Jamaica (1679), he notes turtles' ability to have sex for days, their "neer approximation to reason," their "prodigious fulness of vital energy," and their fully developed "passions," which he suggests cause them to weep at the time of their death (62-64). In The History of the Caribby-Islands (1666), Charles-C6sar comte de Rochefort and his English translator John Davies likewise focus on turtle</page><page sequence="10">316 J N T tears. They note that islanders "turn them [the turtles] upside-down; and being in that posture they are not able to recover themselves, but continue so till the next day ... [and] When they are thus turned upside-down, they are observ'd to shed tears, and are heard to sigh" (134). Rochefort addi- tionally references stag tears and crocodile tears before writing several more pages of description of the tortoises. These tears are more than a cu- riosity to these authors. They demand explanation as either authentic, rea- soned tears, or as the false, unfeeling tears of deceitful animals like croco- diles. Trapham and Rochefort seem inclined to define turtle tears as only "neer reason" and as akin to the manipulative tears of crocodiles, for, if turtle tears and groans echo the groans of slaves, owners would prefer to identify them with manipulative or senseless animal behavior than with authentic human pain. Rochefort, even more than Trapham, reveals his anxiety that the white population has been perhaps too quick to dismiss the humanlike qualities of other animals. Rochefort points out that the native "Caribbians" have an "aversion" to the flesh of tortoises and "forbear the meat of Tortoises" because "of the conformity there is, in their judgment, between them and Man" (274). He remembers "the horrour which the Caribbians conceiv'd heretofore at the eating of Sines-flesh [sic], Tortoises, and Lamantin ... that if any of the Europeans had got them to eat any of them by surprize, and they came afterwards to know it, they would be reveng'd of them one time or other" (302).9 He paints the Europeans as deceitful and cruel and gives an example of a Frenchman who tricked a cacique into eating lamantin and so offended the chief that the chief later avenged himself by slyly including the flesh of humans in the sauces that he served to the Frenchman (303). Rochefort has more faith in the civility of the islanders than of his own nation, and he appreciates their caution in avoiding the consumption of animals that cry. He notes that the Europeans are in greater danger than the islanders of developing a callous attitude toward cruelty. Rochefort, thus, here betrays his own disconcertedness at Europeans' readiness to assert their power by consuming both turtles and slaves. He hesitantly reports of the Europeans' "successful" civilization of the native islanders, who recently "make no difficulty to eat Lamantin, Tortoises, and Swines-flesh, nay, all other Meats in use among the Europeans; and that they laugh at the simplicity which oblig'd them to abstain from them, for</page><page sequence="11">Turtle Tears and Captive Appetites 317 fear of participating of the nature and qualities of those Animals" (303). Seventeenth-century Europeans, including Rochefort, themselves believed that the "nature and qualities" of what they ate, whether pineapple, bread, or hogs' flesh, would affect their own constitutions and behavior.10 Hence Rochefort, by juxtaposing an example of his own countrymen's deceitful and savage behavior alongside the point that his countrymen eat turtles, which the civilized natives forbear, suggests that the Europeans may be lamentably mistaken in their patterns of consumption. His countrymen have, in fact, learned or absorbed savage behavior from their savage eat- ing and have become comfortable with cruelty. Healing the Contagion of Slavery: The Captivity of Dr. Henry Pitman The 1689 text A Relation of the Great Sufferings and Strange Adven- tures of Henry Pitman makes a similar and even more exhaustive culinary argument that savagery begets savagery and that slavery corrupts not only the slave but also the slave owner. Pitman frames his entire captivity nar- rative as a text on health, disease, and curatives and situates his thoughts on slavery within this medical context. Slavery becomes one of a number of illnesses that he details in his narrative. His text likewise demonstrates Wendy Wall's claim that in the early modern period "animal and human bodies were not separated taxonomically in cookbooks, medical guides, or actual household space" and that "medical care" existed in "striking prox- imity" to "butchery and carving" (Wall 192). This text, which details how to slaughter a turtle for dinner, opens with a large-font description of Pit- man as "Chyrurgion to the late Duke of Monmouth" and concludes with a page of advertisements for "Medicines . . . Prepared and Sold . . . by Henry Pitman (1, 39). Pitman offers "both Plain and Purging" pills for dis- eases such as "Scurvey, Dropsie, Gout, Venerial Disease, Appoplexies, Epilepsies, old and invelerate [sic] Head-Aches, Cholick and Iliack Pas- sion, Jaundice, Green-Sickness, &amp;c.," as well as pills for "all manner of Pains in any part of the Body (39). Pitman's account thus emphasizes the reality of disease, the possibility for cure, and his role as the authority, who can assist readers in discerning causes for their sickness and hope for their healing. He particularly grounds his authority in his own experiences</page><page sequence="12">318 J N T of pain and his self-prescribed cures, which he recounts with great detail throughout his narrative. Pitman's disgust with abuse of power, his justification of rebellion, and his outrage against captivity emerges from his personal experiences but also reads as a commentary of anxiety about the enslavement of Africans. Pitman had been sentenced to a ten-year "Service in the American Colonies" where he would be "held and obliged to serve [his] Buyers" as a plantation worker and would not be allowed to purchase his own free- dom (6, 7). Like Ligon, Pitman gains greater empathy for African slaves because of his own imprisonment, and he implies the need for the amelio- ration of the institution, if not its abolition. Pitman, in fact, chooses to align himself with African slavery by calling himself a "slave" rather than a political prisoner, which would have been an equally accurate descrip- tion of his situation. Pitman angrily reports that this enslavement resulted from his giving medical attention to the wounded on the battlefield of a re- bellion against the British king. Because of his proximity to the wounded rebels, he reports, he was taken captive, charged with treason, and subse- quently "ordered to be Transported to the Caribe Islands" (5). Shipped to Barbados along with other prisoners, Pitman resentfully explains that "George Penne a needy Papist ... wanted Money to pay for our Trans- portation, and therefore was very importunate with my Relations to pur- chase mine . . . freedom." "And thus we may see," Pitman bitterly con- cludes, "the buying and selling of Free-men into slavery, was beginning again to be renewed among Christians, as if that Heathenish Custom had been a necessary dependance [sic] on arbitrary Power" (5). Pitman's men- tion of the "arbitrary Power" of his owners reflects the basis upon which he can argue not only for the freedom of or improved conditions for white slaves like himself, but likewise for African slaves, as they, too, are sub- ject to the unreasoned power of their masters. Pitman characterizes these white masters as deserving of their physical sicknesses and as physically and morally corrupted by the institution in which they participate. He reports that his greatest conflict with his master, Robert Bishop, revolved around Pitman's desire to practice his medical profession as he thought best and to reap some financial benefit or other re- muneration for his efforts. Bishop denied him his requested benefits and re- fused to improve the quality of the food that Pitman told Bishop he re- quired to cure the "violent Flux" that plagued the doctor (11). Pitman</page><page sequence="13">Turtle Tears and Captive Appetites 319 angrily retorted, "I would no longer serve him, nor any other as a Surgeon, unless I were entertained according to the just Merits of my Profession and Practice, and that I would chuse rather to work in the Field with the Ne- groes, than to dishonour my Profession by serving him as a Physitian and Surgeon" (12). Not for the first time, Pitman allies himself with African slaves rather than with his white master. He also suggests that Bishop fool- ishly spurns the cures that Pitman authoritatively offers and instead selects for himself the potential for real physical illness and only the solace of his own power over others. In response to Pitman's defiant words, Bishop be- comes "greatly enraged" and is overcome by a "fiery Zeal" and "immoder- ate Passion," another moment of excessiveness that corresponds to the "de- bauched and extravagant course of Life" that Pitman views as the source of his master's downfall (12). Further, Pitman remembers that Bishop "could not content himself with the bare execution of his Cane on my Head, Arms and Back, although he had played so long thereon like a furious Fencer, until he had split him in pieces." He "also confined me close Prisoner in the Stocks, which stood in a open place, exposed to the scorching heat of the Sun, where I remained about twelve Hours, until my Mistriss [sic], moved either with Pitty or Shame, gave oder [sic] for my release" (12).11 Accord- ing to Pitman, Bishop's inability to regulate his own body spills over into his inability to exercise restraint on others' bodies. The sickness of an owner's power spreads like a deadly disease to the bodies of his slaves. Pitman argues that the contaminating and corrupting disease of slave- owning power cannot be contained, and he offers himself and his own body and appetites to prove what he argues to be the uncontrollable nature of the contagion of slavery. Pitman explains that after a series of adven- tures that follow his successful escape from Barbados, he finds himself trapped on another small island with just a small company of other hu- mans, no boat, and few provisions. The Spanish had named the island "Tortuga," meaning turtle, because of the "great plenty of Turtle that re- sorts thither," but the British called the island "Saltitudos," for the "quan- tity of Salt yearly brought from thence" (21). Pitman envisions himself living in a geography of food and, of the two primary commodities the is- land offers him, focuses on the turtles, as had many of his peers, to discuss his relationship to slavery. Pitman includes three dense pages of prose to describe the island tortoises, their habitat, their habits, the meat they af- ford, and the best way to slaughter them. Of particular interest is the pas-</page><page sequence="14">320 j N T sage in which he describes how he and his peers initially capture the tur- tles, or "turn turtle," as he calls it. He writes that when they came up out of the Sea to lay their Eggs in the Sand, we turned them on their Backs, and they being unca- pable of turning themselves again, we let them remain so till the day following, or until we had conveniency of killing them; for if they were sufficiently defended from the heat of the Sun by a shade, which we usually built over them, they would live several days out of the Water. (22) These physically immobile turtles, struggling to survive the scorching heat, bear a striking resemblance to Pitman the slave, who had been "con- fined ... Prisoner in the Stocks, which stood in a open place, exposed to the scorching heat of the Sun ... about twelve Hours" (12). The tortured Pitman learns how to torture. He adopts and enacts upon his food the very mode of physical imprisonment and pain that had been utilized by his own master. The contagious violence of the slave owner transmits to the slave, who in turn enacts a corporeal violence of his own. Like Ligon and Trapham, Pitman fixates on the anthropomorphic qual- ities of the turtle, even as he details his torture of the animal; he glories in the power he holds over his humanlike victims, while he reports the trou- bling consequences of such power. Pitman explains, "I never saw any Creature so long a dying as these, for after we had cut their Throats, di- vided their Bodies, and cut their Flesh into small and minute parts, every part and portion would continue twitching and moving it self a long time." Turtles' hearts "will stir and pant several Hours after is [sic] it taken out of their Bodies," Pitman notes (23). These turtles seem to resist their deaths, and they somehow confer the violence of their resistance into their meat, the text suggests. Pitman explains in his next sentence, "Our continual feeding on these Tortoises, brought us to a violent looseness" (23). The ha- bitual cruelty entailed in killing and eating turtles results in a "violent" physical reaction in the bodies of the masters. Their cruelty brings about their own physical decline, parallel to the physical decline that Pitman suggested his former master had incurred on himself by his own cruelty. While Pitman "speedily" provides an appropriate tincture as a tempo- rary medicinal cure for the "looseness," he seeks a more permanent cure</page><page sequence="15">Turtle Tears and Captive Appetites 321 for his lifestyle of violence (23). He fears that his only chance for rescue from the deserted island will be from pirates interested in conscripting him and his peers for lives of crime and continued killing, this time of humans, not of turtles. Pitman thus concocts a complicated plan to bring about healing and to eliminate the cruel behavior that he thinks causes all of this sickness. He explains that he has thought of a way "to deliver our selves," to escape from the island, and to avoid joining a pirate crew, all "without shedding of Blood" (23-24). Distancing himself as much as possible from the behavior that led to the violence within his own body, Pitman devises a plan to dissolve opium in water to drug into drowsiness any privateers that might come find him. He and his compatriots can thereby gain control of the ship, avoid forced participation in a life of crime, and return home. Pitman looks for a peaceful, "bloodless" way to extricate himself from a life of violence and to bring about his own and others' healing. Exerting a cruel power over others' bodies, he concludes, yields only sickness, and healing results from fleeing that violence. The image of this sickness, this specter of corrupting slavery and bloody violence, particularly characterizes the writings of those Anglo- Caribbean authors who, like Pitman and Ligon, themselves lived the agony of imprisonment and who imagined themselves to have experienced great abuses of power. Employing graphic culinary metaphor to articulate their anxiety about the future of the Anglo population in the Caribbean, these writers raise the alarm that something has gone awry in the Anglo- Caribbean physical and social body. There is a problem with white desire, they suggest, that can only be cured by curbing the excesses of the planter elite and by retraining white appetites toward balanced passions and self- restraint that can control Anglo degradation and the violence it can engen- der. These authors' turn toward the gastronomical to express their fears about the perversion of white desire anticipates and helps to shape later nineteenth-century abolitionist rhetoric that figures white appetite as per- versely savage and even cannibalistic.
