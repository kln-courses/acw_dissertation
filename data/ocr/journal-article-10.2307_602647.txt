KRAEMER TEL-AVIV UNIVERSITY MEDIEVAL ISLAMIC CIVILIZATION THRIVED within a vast empire integrating a rich mosaic of ethnic group- ings, cultural legacies and religious allegiances. It evinced striking adaptability and receptiveness in naturalizing alien elements. Such absorptive vigor may be credited to a universalistic temper of Islam, and to the cosmopolitan nature of great empires and complex civilizations per se. From the outset, the unity imposed by Islamic polity was not a uniformity. "Unity and variety," "great tradition" and "little traditions" went hand in hand.' The integration of alien cultural elements within a highly developed civilization was a process that pro- ceeded through three discernible stages.2 The initial integration, within early Islam, was a fusion of pri- marily Jewish and Christian materials with the sub- stance of local Arab traditions. The universal claim of Islam, and the proclamation of a progressive revela- tion of a single truth to mankind by a series of apostles, culminating with "the seal of the prophets," climax this initial crasis. The second integration, at the time of the great conquests and their aftermath, brought local administrative techniques, legal prac- tices, artistic forms and religious tenets under the arch of the new empire. The third integration was the appanage of "the Graeco-Arabic renaissance," at the apogee of the 'Abbasid epoque, in the third/ ninth and fourth/tenth centuries. In all three stages the legacy of Hellenism and of late Graeco-Roman antiquity plays a major, if not paramount, role. The elements which composed early Islam-whether Jewish, Christian, Judeo-Christian, gnostic or Manichaean-filtered by and large through Hellenistic channels. The heartland of the area conquered by Islam was to a great extent coterminous with the orbit of the Hellenistic successor states and the Graeco-Roman civilization that arose in their wake. And "the Renaissance of Islam" was a conscious continuation of the cultural legacy of the Hellenistic and Graeco-Roman epoch. The third stage concerns us. It was during the Renaissance of Islam that humanism unfolded in its luxuriant expression.3 This branch of humanism was ' On the adaptability and universalistic character of Islamic civilization, see, for instance, S.

The word "humanism" (1-umanismus) was actually coined by a German educator, F. J. Niethammer in Der Streit des Philanthropismus und 135</page><page sequence="2">136 Journal of the American Oriental Society 104.1 (1984) essentially the offspring of the humanitas ideal which germinated in the period of Hellenism and Graeco- Roman antiquity. The primary features of this human- ism are: a conception of the common kinship and unity of mankind; the adoption of the ancient classics as an educational and cultural ideal in the formation of mind and character (paideia); and humaneness, or love of mankind (philanthropia). The plan of our exposition is to adumbrate the career of the humanitas ideal in antiquity; to survey scholarly opinion on its absorption in medieval Islam; and then to support the thesis that this ideal was creatively assimilated within the orbit of Islamic civilization. II The concept of the unity of mankind is cultivated, 4 though not engendered, in the soil of great empires . Empires are pursued without consulting the tribunal of justice, and secured through power and violence; while the result is often conducive to creativity in the arts, letters and thought and to sentiments of human affinity and affiliation.5 Political, commercial and cul- tural unity nourishes feelings of human kinship. Par- ticular loyalties are often surmounted in favor of broader allegiances. The use of a universal language, such as Hellenistic (modified Attic) Greek (the koini, or common speech), Latin or Arabic, thrusts men of diverse backgrounds into a common realm of discourse and serves to lower ethnic and cultural barriers.6 des Humanismus in der Theorie des Erziehungsunterrichts unserer Zeit, published in 1808, to encourage the ancient classics in secondary education against the modern trend of science and technology. The word "humanist" (humanista and its equivalents) had been applied in the sixteenth century to scholars engaged in the studia humanitatis, who revived the liberal arts education of Roman authors like Cicero. This educational program, laying stress on cultural refinement and veneration for human dignity, naturally paved the way to the dominant modern version of humanism, detached from the classical tradition. On classical literary humanism, see P. 0. Kristeller, "The Humanist Movement," in Renais- sance Thought (New York, 1961), pp. 3-23, especially 9-10, 19-20; "Humanist Learning in the Italian Renaissance," in Renaissance Thought II (New York, 1965), pp. 1-19, espe- cially 3-4; W.

Jaeger, tracing humanism to the ancient Greeks (begin- ning with the Sophists), are devoted to literary humanism and its values: Humanistische Reden und Vortrdge, second edition (Berlin, 1960); Paideia: The Ideals of Greek Culture, trans. from the second German Edition, by G. Highet, 3 volumes (New York, 1945); Early Christianity and Greek Paideia (Cambridge, Mass., 1965). The question of the pos- sibility of a religious humanism is discussed by Jaeger in "Humanism and Theology," in Humanistische Reden, pp. 300-34. On Christian (Catholic) humanism, see G. G. Walsh, Medieval Humanism (New York, 1942). C. L. Stinger, Humanism and the Church Fathers (Albany, N.Y., 1977), relates aspects of the Italian Renaissance to Christian antiq- uity and patristic studies. Modern scientific or secular humanism, whose founding-father was F. C. S. Schiller of Oxford, is well presented by H. J.

Koebner, Empire (New York, 1965), especially pp. 43-60, where the extension of the term imperium from the Imperium Romanum to great states in general, covering extensive territory and embracing a host of peoples, is ascribed to the Renaissance humanists. ' Poggio Bracciolini, the Renaissance humanist, papal secre- tary and chancellor of Florence, writes: "We are all aware that states have attained empire by mere violence. This is attested not only by the 'imperia et regna' of the Persians, Medes and Macedonians but also by the widely expanded imperium of the Athenians. And it is always the most powerful empires which promoted letters and learning"; cited from his Historia tripartita by Koebner, p. 49. 6 Saint Augustine comments on diversity of language as a barrier to friendliness and human intercourse and the en- deavor of the imperial city of Rome to impose her language on subject nations in The City of God, Book 19, chapter 7; ed. and trans. by W. C. Greene (Cambridge, Mass., 1960), Vol. VI, p. 149. He deplores however the cost in war and bloodshed required by the imperial city in imposing her yoke and language.

The geographical extension of the known inhabited, or civilized, world (oikoumene) also expanded human horizons. With a single common speech, one could make one's way from the Nile to the Indus. The consolidation of the oikoumene was not ethnic and hardly political after the death of Alexander. To the extent that it existed, it was a unity of language, education, culture and general life style. The ancient gap and antagonism between Hellene and barbarian was blurred, if not obliterated. The attribute "Hellene" came to be ascribed on the basis of men- tality and culture instead of descent. It became pos- sible for non-Greeks to adopt the superior Hellenic culture of the Herrenvolk. Greeks and hellenized natives shared a dedication to the same "ideal of human perfection" fostered by the same civilizing education (paideia).7 Thus came to fruition the words of Isocrates: "And so far has our city [Athens] dis- tanced the rest of mankind in thought and in speech that her pupils have become the teachers of the rest of the world; and she has brought it about that the name 'Hellenes' suggests no longer a race (genos) but an intelligence (dianoia), and that the title 'Hellenes' is applied rather to those who share our culture (pai- deusis) than to those who share a common nature (physis)."8 The time was ripe for articulation of sen- timents of human fellowship and the ideal of the unity of mankind. The Peripatetic philosopher Theophrastus spoke of the friendship (philia) and common relation- ship (syngenes) that rules all and the kinship (oikei- otetos) that binds all men. He expressed his belief that "Hellenes with Hellenes, barbarians with barbar- ians, and all men are akin (oikeious) and related (syn- geneis)."9 The notion of the common kinship of mankind, embraced by Aristotle and Theophrastus, lacked politi- cal provisions that would classify it as authentic cos- mopolitanism. In the Aristotelian view, the polis reflected in the word Hellenismos. Derived from helleniz5 ("to speak Greek"), it meant the correct use of the Greek language before it ever meant adopting a Greek manner of conduct (Jaeger, Early Christianity and Greek Paideia, p. 107, note 6). The use of Arabic, of course, had the same levelling and unifying effect; J. Rick, 'Arablya; Recherches sur l'his- toire de la langue et du style arabe, trans. C. Denizeau (Paris, 1955). 7 See the illuminating study by H. C.

Tarn, in Alexander the Great (Cambridge, 1948), especially Vol. II, pp. 399-499 ("Brotherhood and Unity"); and Hellenistic Civilization, third edition (New York, 1961), pp. 79-80, presents Alexander the Great as the first to conceive the brotherhood of man and unity of mankind, and is followed in this approach by E. Barker, From Alexander to Constantine (Oxford, 1956), pp. 4ff. Baldry sees the evolution of the ideal of the unity of mankind as gradual, from Homer onwards (p. 122), and notes the landmark contributions of Isocrates and Aristotle. See also I. Heinemann, s.v. "Humanitas," in Pauly-Wissowa- Kroll, Realencyclopadie, Supplementband, 5 (1931), cols. 282-310, especially 285-89, on pre-Hellenistic cosmopolitan tendencies. In any event, Alexander did create conditions for the evolution of the Stoic vision of a world state and encouraged inter-racial marriages between Hellenes and barbarians, striving for concord (homonoia) between them; see Arrian's account of the scene at Opis in 324 B.C., in Barker, pp. 4-6 (from Anabasis Alexandri, Book 7, chapter 11, 4-9). On the keynote of homonoia, see Tarn, Alexander the Great, II, p. 400; and H.

I have substituted "nature" for "blood," rendering physis. The notion of a common physis of all mankind, as distinct from nomos ("convention"), goes back to both Sophistic education and Greek medical literature; F. Heinemann, Nomos und Physis (Basel, 1945); Jaeger, Paideia, III, p. 6. The idea is well- expressed by Antiphon the Sophist (latter fifth century B.C.) when he says that "all men are created alike by nature (physei) in all respects, both Greeks and barbarians"; cited by Heinemann, "Humanitas," col. 287; and Hadas, p. 13; see K.

Brink, "Oikeiosis and Oikeiotes: Theophrastus and Zeno on Nature in moral theory," Phronesis, 1 (1956), pp. 123-56, stress the link between Theophrastus and his teacher Aristotle in this regard.</page><page sequence="4">138 Journal of the American Oriental Society 104.1 (1984) remained the ideal context for perfect human organi- zation. During the Hellenistic age, the Stoic vision of an ideal world state, wherein all men would be fellow- citizens, emerged. Stoic cosmopolitanism was based on an impersonal universal law, evident to the wise. The family of man was bifurcated into the wise, who are few, and the fools, who are many. And the many fools threaten the peace of the cosmopolis and are therefore accounted as "enemies, slaves and aliens." The Peripatetic doctrine of human kinship comple- mented Stoic cosmopolitanism and added an affective human dimension to the impassive Stoic logos.'0 The kinship of all men was eloquently expressed in the Hellenistic age by Menander: "For me no man who's good/ Is foreign. The same nature have we all,/ And it is character that makes men kin."" Menander's aware- ness of man's value was accompanied by the sober consciousness that men are not always fully human: "How graceful is a human being, if indeed he is human" (Frg. 761k). Consideration of character and virtue as the criteria for merit and kinship conformed with the Hellenistic outlook which valued education and culture more than lineage and race. To be sure, ideas of human kinship and solidarity do not imply human equality. Men are not equal in their character, talents or circumstances. The Stoic philosopher Chry- sippus expressed this by saying that nothing can pre- vent some seats in the theater from being better than others. 12 During the Hellenistic age the ideal of humanity in the sense of humaneness was more accentuated than ever before. We hear more encouragement of humane practices in warfare, attempts to limit its ravages by delineating off-limits (such as sacred precincts) and commending clemency (epieikeia) and humanity (phil- anthropia) as attributes of the conqueror.'3 The virtue of philanthropia was extended, in the spirit of Helle- nistic cosmopolitanism, to embrace all mankind. Hellenistic treatises on kingship, a prominent subject of political thought during this period, highlighted philanthropia as the cardinal virtue of the Hellenistic ruler. In royal letters of the Hellenistic period, gen- tility, benevolence, and solicitude for the weak and helpless are stressed. The ideal picture of the Hellenis- tic king is one of the august ruler bestowing his protective care to weak and frail humanity as Savior (Stejr) and Benefactor (Euergetes) of mankind. Thus the concept of philanthropia retained its early tincture of condescension. 14 The Roman imperium orbis terrarum arose in the wake of the Hellenistic successor states, restoring and realizing the political unity of the oikoumenj to an unprecedented degree. The political, economic and cultural unification of a far-flung imperium, embrac- ing a host of different peoples, fostered the fully developed idea of humanitas.15 Shortly after the Roman conquest of the Eastern Mediterranean area, including Greece and Macedonia, Polybius, a Greek '0 Brink, pp. 137-38; Baldry, pp. 151-66. Baldry considers Zeno's Politeia as an outline for a future utopia; for the texts, see Barker, pp. 25-27. Oddly, Baldry does not discuss Chrysippus's cosmopolitanism in this context. This world, he says, is the great city (megalopolis), having a single polity and law, and this is the logos of nature, unlike the single city-states (poleis) which have diverse polities and laws; Stoicorum Veterum Fragmenta, ed. H. von Arnim (Stuttgart, 1964), III, frg. 323, pp. 79-80 (Philo, On Joseph, 29). Stoic cosmopolitanism, as is sometimes pointed out (e.g., by Baldry, p. 163), differed from the negative cosmopolitanism of the Cynics in that it was not antithetical to patriotic sentiment. " Frg. 602K, cited by Baldry, p. 136; see The Principle Fragments, ed. and trans. by F. G. Allinson (Cambridge, Mass., 1921), p. 505. 12 According to Baldry, p. 165, "no Greek thinker laid greater stress than Chrysippus on the gulf separating the wise from the unwise."

It meant, in particular, the benevolence, clemency and graciousness of gods and monarchs to man. 15 Heinemann, "Humanitas," cols. 292-93. Marrou, p. 325, observing the continuity of Hellenistic and Latin civilizations, cites the German cachet hellenistich-rcmische Kultur, and the famous line of Horace: "Captive Greece took captive her savage conqueror, and brought civilization to barbarous Latium."</page><page sequence="5">KRAEMER: Humanism in the Renaissance of Islam 139 by birth, undertook to write the first truly universal history, presenting the human race and its history as a unity and the geographical integrity of the oikoumenj as a basic fact. Polybius attempted to account for the astonishing feat of Roman arms-the conquest of virtually the whole known inhabited world in less than fifty-three years. He soberly urged his fellow- countrymen to yield to the implacable might of Rome, envisioning a lasting peace and united mankind under the sword of Roman hegemony.'6 The humanitas ideal inspired the members of the aristocratic philo- hellenic circle of Scipio Aemilianus. Fostered in the atmosphere of the Scipionic circle, the concept of humanitas was bequeathed to Western civilization through the writings of Cicero, whose works are generously besprinkled with the terms humanus and humanitas.'7 In Cicero's idiom humanitas was not simply the quality of being human but the attribute of men who meet certain standards. As expressed by Scipio, in Cicero's De republica (I, xvii, 28), ". ... though others may be called men, only those are men who are perfected in the arts appropriate to humanity.'8 Thus, Cicero intended by humanitas something corresponding to the Greek words anthr5- pismos, in the sense of cultured humanity, and paideia, in the sense of education and culture.'9 Aulus Gellius, in a celebrated passage (Attic Nights, xiii, 17), explains what humanitas meant for Marcus Varro and Marcus Tullius Cicero. Humanitas, correctly understood, he writes, is not what is commonly thought, namely, philanthropia, "a kind of friendly spirit and good feeling towards all men without distinction." Varro and Cicero give to humanitas the force of Greek paideia, which, says Gellius, "we call education and training in the liberal arts." And he goes on to say that those most desirous of these arts are the most humanized, and that it is called humanitas because this kind of knowledge and training is granted to man alone among all the animals.20 Accordingly, paideia was at the heart of Cicero's humanism, and it meant primarily training in the liberal arts, those befitting a gentleman, which mould the young in a humanistic cast. The crowning art in this humanizing programme, as for Plato, was philosophy. For Cicero, (pace Aulus Gellius), humanitas also meant humane in the sense of civilized, the opposite of wild and inhumane (ferus, inhumanus). And it bore the related connotations of clemency, compassion and benevolence, i.e., the seman- tic range of philanthropia. A man who was truly humanus was urbane, generous, suave, tactful and courteous. Rand rightly stresses that Ciceronian hu- manism was neither anti-religious nor anti-patriotic." From Aulus Gellius we learn that in his time humanitas 16 Heinemann, col. 293; F. W. Walbank, A Historical Com- mentary on Polybius (Oxford, 1957), I, p. 9; Baldry, pp. 171- 76. 17 R. Reitzenstein, Werden und Wesen der Humanitat im Altertum (Strassburg, 1907); Heinemann, cols. 299-305, and 309. Reitzenstein relates the development of humanitas in the Scipionic milieu and in Cicero's writings to the teachings of Polybius and the Middle Stoic philosopher Panaetius of Rhodes; see also Modestus van Straaten, Panetius; sa vie, ses &amp;crits et sa doctrine avec une edition des fragments (Amster- dam, 1946), pp. 219-22; M. Pohlenz, Antikes Fuhrertum; Cicero "De Officiis" und das Lebensideal des Panaitos (Leipzig, 1934), pp. 139ff.; Baldry, 179-83. The relationship of Scipio with Panaetius and Polybius is mentioned by Cicero in De republica, I, xxi, 34. See also E. K. Rand, "The Humanism of Cicero," Proceedings of the American Philo- sophical Society, 71 (1932), pp. 207-16; R. Harder, "Nach- tragliches zu humanitas," Hermes, 69 (1934), pp. 64-74; idem, "Die Einburgerung der Philosophie in Rom," Die Antike, 5 (1929), pp. 291-319; W. RUegg, Cicero und der Humanismus (see note 3, above). The philosophers who came under the influence of Panaetius, such as Posidonius of Rhodes (a native of Apamea) and Antiochus of Ascalon, are sometimes mentioned as responsible for laying the foundations of the Graeco-Roman humanitas ideal as it developed in the Scipionic circle. 18 Reitzenstein, p. 23, note 3; Baldry, p. 202; De republica, ed. and trans. by C. W. Keyes (Cambridge, Mass., 1959), p. 51. Scipio goes on to cite as apt a remark he says was made by Plato, or perhaps someone else. Shipwrecked and stranded on an unknown desert shore, he allayed his com- panions' fears when he noticed geometrical figures traced in the sand, and said, "Be of good courage; I see the tracks of men." The anecdote (as the editor points out) really concerns Aristippus. It is related in the Arabic milieu, e.g., by Aba Sulaymdn al-Sijistdni, Siwdn al-hikma, ed. 'A. Badawl (Tehe- ran, 1974), p. 217, in the name of Aristippus (AristTs); and anonymously by al-Mubashshir b. Fatik, Mukhtdr al-hikam, ed. 'A. Badawli (Madrid, 1958), p. 32. '9 Snell, p. 254. 20 Aulus Gellius, The Attic Nights, ed. and trans. J. C. Rolfe (Cambridge, Mass., 1960), II, p. 457. The identification of humanitas with paideia is, of course, highly significant for Jaeger, who often refers to this passage; e.g., Humanistische Reden und Vortrdge, pp. 121, 307; and Paideia, I, xxiii. 21 On the semantic range of humanitas in Cicero's writings, see M. Schneidewin, Die antike Humanitat (Berlin, 1897),</page><page sequence="6">140 Journal of the American Oriental Society 104.1 (1984) was generally equated with philanthropia. Humanitas continued to bear the connotation of humanitarianism (as do its derivates "humanity," "humanite," "Humani- tdt").22 Lactantius, for instance, equated humanitas with misericordia. Humanity, he says, contains the motive impelling men towards a communal life and is "the great bond which unites men to one another."23 The Ciceronian humanitas ideal was revived by the humanists of the Italian Renaissance, for whom it meant principally, as for Cicero, education in the artes liberates (studia humanitatis).24 III Roman culture, as observed, has been styled helle- nistich-romische Kultur. Rome was a pupil of Hellas. By extension, one may suggest the appropriateness of the expression hellenistich-islamische Kultur. The "spiritual culture" (geistige Kultur) of Islam has indeed been designated an "islamicized Hellenism" (islami- sierter Hellenismus).25 And Carl Heinrich Becker exclaimed: "Die erklarung fur die Moglichkeit einer islamischen Einheitszivilisation liegt hauptsachlich in der weltgeschichtlichen Tatsache des Hellenismus. So bizarr es klingt: Ohne Alexander den Grossen keine islamische Zivilisation!"26 Islamic culture was linked from the beginning with the cultural sphere of classical antiquity, in the guise of Hellenism and (Eastern) Roman civilization, and may be regarded as directly affiliated with this sphere.27 The question at issue, then, is this: To what degree was the Hellenistic and Graeco-Roman humanitas ideal (paideia, philanthr- pia, human kinship and cosmopolitanism) adopted in the world of medieval Islam? This specific question is inseparable from the broader question whether the bearers of culture in Islamic civilization really under- stood the "essence" or "spirit" of antiquity. "Were they good disciples? Did they grasp the spirit of Hellas?"28 Cultural historians and Islamicists are divided into two camps on the question whether Islamic civilization belongs to the Kulturkreis of the European West, having a common heritage of ancient culture and similar educational and human ideals, or whether it belongs to another cultural orbit ("Oriental"). Such scholars as Ernst Troeltsch, Werner Jaeger and Jorg Kraemer denied, while others, including Carl H. Becker and Hans H. Schaeder, affirmed the Western affiliation. However, in the final analysis, both camps actually share the same view; namely, that Islamic civilization failed to understand the cultural legacy (Nachleben) of antiquity in general and its educational and humanistic ideals in particular. Their statements, which represent a powerful and authoritative on- slaught on the thesis proposed herein, deserve a con- spectus. Werner Jaeger confines culture in the true sense, which he identifies as paideia or humanism ("culture as the conscious ideal of human perfection") to "our group of nations," which he calls "Hellenocentric." Culture as a consciously sought value and ideal belongs exclusively to the Hellenocentric phenomenon of European Geistesgeschichte. Culture may be ascribed to other peoples (Chinese, Indian, Babylonian and Egyptian), but only in an anthropological sense. The "idea of culture" is the specific attribute of Hellenism in contrast to the Orient. The guiding intellectual pp. 31-40; Reitzenstein, p. 5 and note 3 on pp. 23-25; Heine- mann, cols. 300-305; E. K. Rand, "The Humanism of Cicero," pp. 210-16. In a passage in his De legibus, I, xxii, 58-60 (ed. and trans. C. W. Keyes, p. 365), cited by Rand (p. 215), Cicero refers to the Delphic maxim, saying that he who knows himself will first see that there is something of the divine in him. This interpretation of the Delphic maxim, it may be added, enjoyed wide currency in medieval Islamic philosophy. Cicero then goes on to speak of his realization that he is both a citizen of the whole world and born for civic society. The combination of humanistic interests with religious concerns, and of cosmopolitanism with patriotism, will be seen below (p. 161) to be a feature of the humanism of the Islamicfalhsifa. 22 Heinemann, cols. 306-309. 23 Divine Institutions, VI, 10, 1-4 (Opera Omnia, ed.

Furthermore, culture is mani- fested in the whole man: externally in appearance and comportment and internally in his inner being. It is through the consciousness of its all-embracing effect on the whole man that Roman Hellenism is funda- mentally distinct from that of Asia, which is equally strongly permeated with Greek civilization. "How predominantly formal, intellectual and impersonal is the Hellenism of Jews, Arabs, Syrians, etc. where we learn to know it!" The Hellenism of these peoples is learned but not experienced ("Er ist erlernt, aber nicht erlitten"). The Romans, in contrast, grasped the essence of the Hellenic spirit and they were the ones who transformed Hellenism into humanism, creating the word humanitas to express Greek culture.29 Carl H. Becker took issue with Troeltsch's severance of the Near Eastern-Islamic from the Mediterranean- European-American culture sphere.30 He contended that the real break is not between Europe and Islam but between Europe and Islam on one side and Asia on the other. Islamic civilization springs from the same cultural background as the European West, including classical antiquity in the guise of Hellenism. The question, however, is how Islam and Europe each reacted to the impact of the ancient legacy. The great distinguishing Erlebnis of the West is humanism, an entirely different concept of man and humanity from that of Islamic civilization. The West discovered (or rather rediscovered, since Christianity was a break with antiquity) the essence of the ancient idea of man.3' The epitome of the Islamic Humanitatsideal was the insan al-kamil (perfect man), a notion trace- able to Neoplatonism and Christianity (i.e., not to classical antiquity). Moreover, whereas the Greek polis was once transplanted to the Orient-e.g., the cities of Seleucia, Antioch and Alexandria-Islam never expe- rienced their character as colonies of free citizens but either obliterated them or absorbed them into the political system of Oriental absolutism. The concep- tion of the free citizen did not exist in the Orient, and was not even contemplated. The Lebensgefuihl of the Orient is undemocratic. Western democracy rests upon humanism and individualism, Oriental democracy upon collectivism. Furthermore, the ancient heritage that survived in Islam was different from that of the West. It was not that of Sophocles, Plato or the "true Aristotle," but rather the epigones of orientalized antiquity. The ancient heritage was consciously culti- vated only in the areas of theology, science and popu- lar philosophy of life. Hans Heinrich Schaeder recognized that the point of departure for Oriental culture, which reaches its fulfillment in Islam, is the same as for Western cul- 32 ture. But the reception of Greek culture produced different results. The special Western attitude to the Greeks is traceable to the first Western people who adopted Greek teaching, namely, the Romans, pupils of the Greeks. They assimilated Greek culture so as to educate men, not simply to acquire knowledge and new skills. The Romans named Greek culture humani- tas and were the creators of humanism. The Orient, until the present, has been unable to create a Renais- sance or humanism because the goal and predominant ideal of Oriental culture was not humanitas but sal- vation (Heilung) and redemption (Erlosung) of the individual (soteriologische Individualismus). The Ori- entals utilized the Greek legacy to fortify their own spiritual inclinations. Thus, gnosis, or salvational knowledge, is the basic concept of the Oriental world view, which comes to its fruition in Islam. The cities founded by Alexander the Great and his successors had the communal organization of the Greek polis. But the Orientals were accustomed to the conception that men are slaves to the one Lord. Nowhere do we perceive the emergence of the free virtuous citizen. The assimilation of the Greek heritage in the Orient may be termed a "tragic sterility" (tragisch Unfrucht- barkeit). What was learned served practical use. The 29 The summary is based upon W.

Theologians used dialectical weapons for apologetics; rulers employed scientists, physicians, gilders and astrologers. The intense trans- lation activity from the ninth century on was under- taken for utilitarian purposes. No humanistic feelings accompanied the emergence of the new texts. Averroes was important as an intermediary in transferring Aris- totelianism to the West, but in his own time he was isolated and without influence. The Epistles of the Sincere Brethren are gnostic-soteriological. Avicenna, though a Hellenistic philosopher of an Islamic type, was a compiler who had nothing to do with vital and real science and culture. Though logos and ratio permeated the entire spiritual production of the Orientals, it did not transform the Oriental spirit. Homer and Socrates, without whom the Hellenocen- tric sphere of the West is inconceivable, were incom- prehensible for Orientals. The conception of Socrates was derived from a late doxographical tradition. He was revered, along with Jesus, as a martyr. The Orientals were unable to comprehend the cultural and educational value of the Platonic works. What was congenial was accepted in the form of a "decomposed Platonism," e.g., the idea of immortality, the theory of the soul, the astral speculation of the Phaedrus and the cosmogony of the Timaeus. Aristotelian logic was employed first by Christians and later by Islamic theologians to systematize dogma and combat heresy. Aristotle was viewed through Neoplatonic eyes and complemented with Neoplatonic literature. The Orien- tals failed to understand Greek cosmological thought and the apprehension of the world as a well-ordered harmonious whole but focused instead on personal salvation and the relationship of the individual soul to God. Rudi Paret, like Becker and Schaeder, places both East and West within the "Hellenocentric orbit;" in fact, he stresses that in the Eastern Greek-speaking part of the Christian world the continuity of the classical tradition was greater than in the West.33 Cultural elements of classical Greek and Hellenistic origin were transmitted from the Syriac-speaking theo- logians to the ninth-century Arabo-Islamic world. This process of transmission led to a contraction and modification of the Greek cultural legacy. Inter alia, ancient poetry and history remained unknown, and Plato was perceived distortedly, for the Oriental Christian transmitters neglected what smacked of paganism and regarded Greek philosophy as an ancilla theologiae. Neoplatonism was congenial. The motive for the adaptation of the Greek cultural heritage was practical utility (Niitzlichkeit). Medicine, geography, astronomy, mathematics, alchemy and the natural sciences in general were pursued. Philosophy was probed because of its close link with medicine. All scientific studies undertaken by the Arabs emanated initially from Syrian physicians. In the course of the eighth century, when an Islamic theology in the true sense of the word was developed by the Mu'tazilites, the conditions became ripe for a real infiltration of the Greek heritage. The intellectual weapons wielded by the Mu'tazilites in their polemics with heretics and non-Muslims were foreign concepts and modes of discourse. After this initial step, interest in Greek sources grew, Greek authors were translated into Arabic, and even the state authorities lent their sup- port to the translation activity. Eventually, however, the Mu'tazilite "creative minority" was suppressed, and they were denounced by Orthodoxy as rationalists and accused of heresy. Bertold Spuler subscribes to Schaeder's view that Islamic culture, while fertilized by Hellenism, did not produce from this soil a new concept of humanity as did the Romans.34 A constriction (Eindammung) of the ancient legacy took place, since the foundations of Islamic religion were laid before the infiltration of Hellenistic influence, and because Islamic dogmatics are conceivable in the absence of the Hellenic spirit, in contrast to Christianity. Moreover, the political sen- timent of free Hellenes participating in a polis could not be sustained. In the Chalifenreiche the type of the ancient Near Eastern state persisted. Islamic culture was not a heritage of antiquity. "For us," Spuler says, the ancient legacy does not consist merely of phi- losophy and theology, medicine and natural science; it also includes Livy, Virgil, Seutonius and Horace. Since Islam falls back upon material of a Hellenistic culture, for which Homer, Thucydides, Sophocles and Plutarch were no longer really alive, we cannot see it as a true heir of the ancient heritage. What Islam managed to acquire, it did for utilitarian reasons. Science served theology. Also, Islam brought with it its own language and poetry, and possessed a theology which had no place for Homer and Sophocles. Finally, Islam founded a Reich for which the ancient political 33 R.

The Reich was ancient- Oriental, and in 'Abbasid times rested on a Persian political tradition. The Islamic world-picture emerged from a new synthesis of the Hellenistic and the Near Eastern spirit. Jorg Kraemer is the most articulate spokesman of the Troeltschian view-that the two cultures, Euro- pean and Islamic, are not only diverse but funda- mentally distinct.35 He proclaims that "it is just the differences that matter" (Pieter Geyl) and "Oh, East is East, and West is West, and never the twain shall meet" (Rudyard Kipling). Although Latin West, Byzan- tine East and Islam share common origins in Near Eastern Hellenism and Christianity, there is no com- parable cultural synthesis. Kraemer, like his predeces- sors, stresses the constriction of the Greek heritage. "The sun of Homer never really smiled on the Orient." And he insists, with an eye to the pseudosciences of late antiquity, that "not all is Greek that is in Greek letters." The essence of Hellas was not grasped. The essential quality of organized life in the polis had no impact. There was no carry-over of paideia. The Greek view of the structure and working of the cos- mos, of an uncreated, unchanging, eternal world, independent of a creator God, was not appreciated. A Renaissance or humanism, the essential orientation to classical aniquity, never took place throughout medi- eval Islam. It could not occur, and was not even an aspiration, except for Averroes or al-Rdzl. Kraemer accompanies his analysis of the "well-known unrecep- tiveness by Islam for the central features of Hellenism" with a stereotypic description of "general Oriental thinking in compartments" and the "separatism of the Semitic spirit." He takes notice of the atomism and discreteness of the Arab imagination or way of think- ing and its "resistance to synthetic constructions and, above all, its aversion to rationalism," which accounts for a tendency toward classification, summae, hand- books and introductions to Aristotle.36 In the view of Gustave E. von Grunebaum it is essential to realize that Muslim civilization is a cul- tural entity not sharing our primary aspirations.37 This, he claims, is because Islam of the past and present is not "vitally interested in analytical self- understanding" and is even "less interested in the structural study of other cultures." And he goes on to say that "one may perhaps seek to connect it with the basic antihumanism [emphasis added] of this civiliza- tion, that is, the determined refusal to accept man to any extent whatever as the arbiter or the measure of things, and the tendency to be satisfied with truth as the description of mental structures, or, in other words, 3 First in his "Die Bildungsideale des Islams und ihre gegenwartige Problematik," in Erziehung zur Menschlichkeit. Die Bildung im Umbruch der Zeit (Festschrift fur Eduard Spranger) (Tubingen, 1957), pp. 273-89; and in a more extensive form in Das Problem der islamischen Kultur- geschichte (Tubingen, 1959). 36 In this respect, he quotes, inter alia, H. A. R. Gibb, Modern Trends in Islam, second edition (Chicago, 1950), pp. 7, 87 and 109. These stereotypes, while important for Kraemer's thesis, are (like all stereotypes) dangerous. 3' G. E. von Grunebaum, "Islamic Civilization," in Modern Islam, p. 55. Von Grunebaum intimates here and elsewhere essential agreement with the position of E. Troeltsch, who denied (in von Grunebaum's words) "the essential participa- tion of the Islamic Kulturkreis in the destiny of the West" (ibid., p. 96, note 66, on p. 97). In the same note he com- mends Jorg Kraemer's vindication of Troeltsch's position as a sound historical approach. Elsewhere ("Nationalism and Cultural Trends," in Modern Islam, p. 312, note 20, on p. 313), he subscribes to Kraemer's statement, in "Die Bil- dungsideale des Islams," p. 278, that there never occurred in Islam that "totale Lebensbeziehung zum Altertum" (Spranger) which is uniquely able to confer educational power to elevate and transform such culture contact. Conversely, in dismissing a Renaissance or humanism in Islam, Kraemer (Das Problem der islamischen Kulturgeschichte, p. 37 and note 14 on p. 62) cites von Grunebaum: "The far-reaching importance of the Greek contribution to Islamic cultures should not lead one to suppose that it effected a fundamental change in its vitality or its concept of man." The rest of the passage is: "There are few traces of the Greek spirit in the human ideal within even those sects which, like the Ismac'liyya, were most open to the influence of the Greek element in the interest of its own theologico-philosophic system"; "Islam- kunde und Kulturwissenschaft," ZDMG, 103 (1953), p. 15; also in "Islamic Studies and Cultural Research," The Ameri- can Anthropologist. Studies in Islamic Cultural History, ed. von Grunebaum (Menasha, Wisconsin, 1954), p. 18. And Kraemer appeals to von Grunebaum's remark that "The fundamental structure of Islamic thinking has been left un- touched by Hellenistic influence"; citing "Der Islam und das Problem kultureller Beeinflussung," which appeared in Wis- senschaftliche Zeitschrift der Martin Luther Universitat, Halle- Wittenberg. . . , 6 (1956), p. 22; see "The Problem of Cultural Influence," in Modern Islam, p. 27; also in Islam and Medieval Hellenism: Social and Cultural Perspectives, ed. D. S. Wilson (London, 1976), VIII, p. 91.</page><page sequence="10">144 Journal of the American Oriental Society 104.1 (1984) with psychological truth." Elsewhere, he writes that "Islam is eminently human in that it takes man for what he is, but it is not humanist in that it is not interested in the richest possible unfolding and evol- ving of man's potentialities, in that it never conceived of the forming of men as civilization's principal and most noble task. Man is to be directed and guided toward salvation rather than educated to develop his self in developing this world as the deed most de- serving of everlasting reward." This observation is made in a context wherein von Grunebaum insists that usefulness was the criterion guiding the selection of knowledge and justifying scientific activity. And the effect of the lack of humanism and surrender to usefulness is summed up thus: "The absence of a humanist concept of man's nature and task and the baneful submission to usefulness as a yardstick of values are largely responsible for the comparative ineffectiveness of the Greek heritage."38 Von Grunebaum also stresses the constriction of infiltration, commenting on the misfortune of Islam vis-h-vis the representatives of Hellenic thought it encountered, e.g., Neoplatonism instead of Plato, Porphyry and Proclus instead of Plotinus, and Aris- totle viewed predominantly through commentaries and epigones. Greek was viewed through inadequate trans- lations, mostly from Syriac.39 In his Introduction to The Classical Heritage in Islam, Franz Rosenthal orients the reader toward an appreciation of the fertility of the ancient heritage in Islam. His succinct and lucid remarks are an apposite entree to the main thesis of this paper. Rosenthal avows that the "role of knowledge ('ilm) as the driving force in religion and, thereby, in all human life" was essential to the development of the Graeco-Arabic translation activity. This major cultural enterprise is simply inexplicable as a result of "practical utili- tarianism," which made medicine, alchemy and the exact sciences appealing, or "theoretical utilitarianism," which stimulated philosophical-theological speculation. Apropos the character of the Islamic reception of classical antiquity, Rosenthal notes that the translators "drew upon the same late Hellenistic stock from which most of our own knowledge of classical antiquity derives. However, they were considerably closer to it in time." The scholarly enterprise of the translators revived the classical heritage in Islam in "a consciously creative act." Although the translators and their bene- ficiaries "had no express intention to regain and give new life to the spirit and essence of classical civiliza- tion . . . the process that took place in the Muslim empire between the eighth and tenth centuries is much closer in spirit and character to the European renais- sance than any of the movements to which it has been the fashion to apply the term 'renaissance' during recent decades. If we were to characterize it in one word, we might meaningfully-and fully conscious of the significance we attach to the word-call it the renaissance of Islam." Franz Rosenthal considers it unlikely that Islamic civilization would have become the force it was in human history were it not for the adoption of the classical heritage. Scholarship and scientific research, ingredients of the greatness of Islamic civilization, depend virtually entirely on classical antiquity. The task of scholarly research is to determine how the Muslims treated the ancient heritage, how they har- monized it with their own cultural genius and tradition and what new synthesis emerged from this creative enterprise. "The indisputable fact remains, though, that Islamic civilization as we know it would simply not have existed without the Greek heritage."40 38 Von Grunebaum, Medieval Islam; A Stud)' in Cultural Orientation (Chicago, 1961), pp. 230-32. Von Grunebaum's discussion on the fascination of the useful is cited by Kraemer, "Bildungsideale," p. 279. 39 Ibid., p. 323. Relevant to our discussion is also von Grunebaum's "Islam and Hellenism," in Islam and Medieval Hellenism, No. I (from Scientia, 44 [Como, 1950]). He attaches importance to the difference between the "classical" (Hellenic) and "post-classical" (Hellenistic) traditions-the former embracing the rationalistic thought of ancient Greece and the latter the gnostic and Neoplatonic elements of late antiquity-and their impact on different phases of Islamic culture. The two blend, for example, in the mystic saint, combining the "classical" theios ancr and the post-classical anthropos teleios. The distinction breaks down somewhat when one considers the character of the "classical" tradition in the light of E. R. Dodds, The Greeks and the Irrational (Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1963). See also "The Structure of the Muslim Town," ibid., No. IV (From Islam; Essays in the Nature and Growth of a Cultural Tradition [London, 1961]), on the matter of polis as an autonomous association of citizens wherein the distinctively humane and the good life can be developed and exist as an aim (in contrast to the Muslim town). 40 F.

In the same spirit, Goitein answers affirmatively the question</page><page sequence="11">KRAEMER: Humanism in the Renaissance of Islam 145 Three scholars have written studies specifically devoted to humanism in Arabo-Islamic culture. 'Abd al-Rahman BadawT, reflecting on humanism in Arab thought, rejects C. H. Becker's contention that this Erlebnis, decisive for the West, was non-resident in the Orient.4' Becker's postulate, that humanism should appear with identical contours in both cultures, is fallacious because the spirit informing each culture is distinct.42 Greek culture was not unique in creating a humanistic ideal. Every high culture produces this phenomenon in its own way. Certain common traits nevertheless appertain to all cases of humanism, e.g., affirmation of man as the norm of value, exaltation of reason (in European humanism-the absolute auton- omy of reason) and the idea of human progress. Even within a specific culture humanism appears in various guises in different periods. The first appearance of humanism in Arab culture was at the time of Khusraw Aniisharwan, and was represented by Burz6E, Paulus Persa and Salman Pak. Another stage of Arab humanism, emerging from Hellenistic gnosticism, Hermetic literature and Neoplatonism, centered on the theme of the "perfect man" (al-insln al-kUmil/ teleios anthropos)-the divine or primal man. This expression of humanism, that places man as the center of being, is best portrayed by Ibn al-'Arabl, 'Abd al- Karim al-JllT, al-Hallaj and Suhrawardl. The humanis- tic expression that glorifies reason is found, for instance, in traditions from the Prophet, viz. "Who- ever knows himself knows God" and "The first thing created by God is the intellect." It is also represented by the rationalist, Muhammad b. Zakariyya' al-Razi. Al- Razi even rejected revelation, advocating the au- tonomy of reason in a manner reminiscent of the eighteenth-century European Enlightenment. This sec- ond expression of humanism is traced by Badawi to the same sources as the first-Neoplatonism and gnosticism, and doctrines ascribed to the Brahmans (Barahima).43 Al-RazI also exhibits a third expression of humanism-the idea of scientific progress. Badawi stresses that the humanistic tendency was not confined to isolated individuals within Arab society, but was widespread, e.g., in ShTFT and Isma'lTI milieux. The Enlightenment represented by Ibn al-Rawandi in the third/ninth century radiated upon Arab thought in the fourth/tenth. The only somewhat isolated figure was al-Razil, who stood on the summit of Arab humanism. The real generating force of this humanism and mainspring of the Arab spirit was an Oriental- Iranian, Jewish, Neoplatonic, etc.-not Greek, heri- tage. In light of all this, von Grunebaum speaks of the "anti-Hellenic neohumanism" of Badawl.44 he posed-"Were they good disciples? Did they grasp the spirit of Hellas?"-(above, p. 140, and note 28). He insists on dropping the distinction East and West, etc., and considers historical periods in their own right. Accordingly, in the middle, Hellenic, period ("The Intermediate Civilization") "the disciple was worthy of his master." The Greek heritage did affect the spirit of the epoch, moulding the personality of individuals. He notes that in some respects the Intermediate Civilization surpassed its ancient Greek and Roman masters, e.g., in comparative religion and "spirit of research" (al- BTriini). See also Levi della Vida, "Dominant ideas in the Formation of Islamic Culture," p. 214. Goitein's insistence on periodization is a welcome corrective to the tendency, seen above, to lump all periods in medieval Islam into a single epoch characterizable as a whole. 41 cA BadawT, "Al-Naz'a al-insdnipya fi l-fikr al-CarabT," in Al-Insaniyya wal-wujiudiyya fi l-fikr al- carab! (Cairo, 1947), pp. 3-64; also "L'Humanisme dans la pens&amp;e arabe," Studia Islamica, 6 (1956), pp. 67-100. 42 Badawi adopts a Spenglerian approach to cultures as unique, distinct and incomparable entities, and thus implies the validity of Troeltsch's bifurcation of European and Islamic Kulturkreise. Thus, he differs from Becker on two counts: Becker says one Kulturkreis but no humanism in Islam; Badawl says two Kulturkreise but affirms the presence of humanism in Islam (or "Arab thought"). 4' The traditions are discussed by 1. Goldziher, "Neupla- tonische und gnostische Elemente im HadTt," Zeitschriftfuir Assyriology, 22 (1908), pp. 317-44 (in Gesammelte Schriften, ed. J. Desomogyi [Hildesheim, 1970], Vol. V, pp. 107-34); cited by Badawi, p. 93, note 1. BadawT allows for the possi- bility that the Brahmans' doctrines are really those of Ibn al- RdwandT in literary disguise. 44 Von Grunebaum, "Nationalism and Cultural Trends," Modern Islam, p. 312, note 20, on p. 313. Badawl's orienta- tion is not as much anti-Hellenic as it is trans-Hellenic. (The claim of an "Oriental" origin for Neoplatonism is question- able and receives its corrective in the classic study by A. C. Lloyd, "Neoplatonic and Aristotelian Logic," Phronesis, 1 [1955-56], pp. 58-72, 146-59, as well as in E. R. Dodds, The Greeks and the Irrational.) BadawT's aim is to find the roots of Arab humanism at home, in the "Orient." Nor can it be said that "he views the strangle hold of the Hellenic heritage on the Muslim development as truly tragic." Badawi's enterprising publications of Graeco-Arabic texts and studies bear witness to his fascination with this heritage; see his La transmission de la philosophie grecque au monde arabe (Paris, 1968), p. 7.</page><page sequence="12">146 Journal of the American Oriental Society 104.1 (1984) Louis Gardet asks whether it is valid to speak of an Islamic humanism.45 He refuses to identify humanism with the culture of the Renaissance humanists, nimbly dodges the issue of receptivity of Graeco-Latin anti- quity, and confirms Islamic humanism on the basis of the definitions of humanism by Pierre Mesnard and Jacques Maritain ("toute conception theorique, toute attitude pratique, qui affirment la valeur exception- nelle de l'homme." [L'humanisme] "tend essentielle- ment 'a rendre l'homme plus vraiment humain, et a manifester sa grandeur originelle en le faisant partici- per ai tout ce qui peut l'enricher dans la nature et dans 1'histoire. ) Gardet discriminates two dimen- sions of Islamic humanism: religious and cultural. Islam preaches the brotherhood of believers, the values of fidelity, justice, honor, mutual assistance, charity, respect for parents and protection of orphans. Hospi- tality is a sacred value, and includes honoring guests and the right of asylum, which is expanded to the protection granted to the People of the Scriptures. However, along with humanism, Islam exhibits restric- tive elements, an ambivalent, even anti-humanistic, tendency. Islam is aware of the precariousness or vacuity of the human condition. It values not man qua man, but man qua believer and member of the community of the Prophet, to the exclusion of all others who are not believers or proteges.46 Mohammed Arkoun concentrates his discussion of Arab humanism on the fourth/tenth century. He ana- lyzes Kidb al-Hawdmil wal-shawdmil by Abii Hayydn al-TawhTdT ("l'humaniste indigne") and AbU 'CAlT b. Miskawayh ("l'humaniste serein").47 It is legitimate to speak of an Islamic humanism, says Arkoun, to the extent that the philosophers (faldsifa) and certain independent spirits confided to human reason alone the task of confirming by logic the profound truths disclosed by revelation. As in all forms of Oriental humanism, man is the main subject of all philo- sophical-scientific research. "La plus feconde signifi- cation de l'humanisme musulman doit 8tre recherchee dans cette irruption de valeurs rationnelles et de tradi- tions profanes etrangeres dans une conscience emotive dominee par la vision eschatologique." This movement of acculturation produced "tortured souls" such as al- TawhidT. Arkoun stresses the rationalism and intel- lectual audacity of al-TawhidT and his "obsession" with the image of the perfect man, a fundamental theme of Arab humanism expounded by his teacher, AbN Sulayman al-SijistanT. In one of his questions addressed to Miskawayh, Abt Hayyan observes that 'man is a problem for man" (inna l-insdn ashkala Calayhi l-insdn). In contrast to the tortured "indigne" al-TawhldT, who represents "la protestation d'une con- science injustement etouffee contre l'inanite d'un savoir, voire d'une sagesse non accompagnes d'effets pratiques," Miskawayh serenely reaffirms "la validite perenne de la sagesse qui'il est dans la nature des choses de voir trahie, defiguree par l'action des hommes." The valuable contributions by Badawli, Gardet and Arkoun place humanism in Islam on a more positive, although occasionally vague, footing. I shall attempt in the following section to make its contours more vivid, working against the background of the semantic range of humanism delineated in Part II. It must be borne in mind that the question is not about "hu- manisme musulman" (Gardet, Arkoun), which is an ambivalent expression suggesting a concern with the 45 L. Gardet, La cite musulmane; vie sociale el politique, third edition (Paris, 1969), pp. 273-322. 46 The cultural foundation of Islamic humanism takes up the remainder of Gardet's exposition (pp. 285-322). Von Grunebaum surveys Gardet's discussion in "Islamic Civiliza- tion," in Modern Islam, pp. 69-70, ending with the following penetrating query: "The question, however, remains whether such humanisms as are traceable within the Muslim orbit are incidental to the Muslim message, tolerated as passing and irrelevant phenomena, or whether they are germane, if not necessary, articulations of its fundamental aspiration. The fact that, in spite of their profound attraction, the alien character of the specifically humanistic gifts of the older civilizations with which Islam came in contact was never forgotten may suggest the answer." See also the review of Gardet by A. Dietrich, ZDMG, 107 (1957), pp. 645-47, who detects the absence of an analysis of cilm and adab. Dietrich calls attention to the prominence of Arab humanism ("vero e proprio umanismo arabo") in Michelangelo Guidi's Storia e cultura degli Arabi (Florence, 1951); see his review of Guidi in ZDMG, 103 (1953), pp. 210-12. 47 M.

The question is about humanism within Islamic civilization. To be sure, this humanism could not have thrived, when it did, were it not for the nature of the society which existed under the aegis of Islam. "Within Islamic civilization" does not mean of course in all epochs and places. We are speaking of a specific epoch and locale, and of a phenomenon which did not survive, although it left a lasting impression on the character of Islamic culture. IV Expressions of humanistic tendencies came to the fore in the world of Islam during the third/ninth and fourth/tenth centuries. This period, the zenith of the "Intermediate Civilization of Islam," witnessed the emergence of an affluent and influential middle class which, having the opportunity and desire to acquire knowledge and social status, contributed to the dif- fusion of the ancient cultural heritage. Caliphs, emirs and viziers became devout patrons of learning, and entertained philosophers, scientists and litterateurs in their resplendent courts. The growth of commerce and trade, extending beyond the boundaries of mamlakat al-isldm, as well as urbanization, facilitated communi- cation among peoples of different backgrounds. Bagh- dad became the cultural capital of a tremendous empire, stretching from Spain to India. Islamic society, in the words of Levi della Vida, was "even more cosmopolitan than the hellenistic and Roman world had ever been."48 The apogee was reached in the second half of the tenth century under the rule of the Bilyid (Buwayhid) dynasty, whose princes and viziers vied in sponsoring the arts and sciences. This was the high-water mark of the period dubbed by Adam Mez "The Renaissance of Islam."49 48 G. Levi della Vida, "Dominant Ideas in the Formation of Islamic Culture," pp. 213-14. By the mid-tenth century the Islamic empire had disintegrated into small states aptly compared by al-MasciUd to the petty dynasties of the Dia- dochis (mu/ak al-tawd'ij) that rose following the death of Alexander. Despite this dismemberment, the idea persisted of mamlakat al-isldm, an embracing unity of an empire stretching from India to the Atlantic, throughout which a Muslim could travel under a single banner of religion, law, culture and citizenship; see al-MascUdT, Murqj al-dhahab, ed. and trans. Ch. A. C. Barbier de Meynard and B. M. M. Pavet de Courteille (Paris, 1861-77), II, 73, anno 332; cited by A. Mez (see following note), pp. 1-2/English trans., pp. 104/Arabic translation, pp. 19-21. 49 A. Mez, Die Renaissance des Islams (Hildesheim, 1968; reprint of 1922 edition); English translation by S. K. Bakhsh and D. S. Margoliouth, The Renaissance of Islam (London, 1927). An Arabic translation with additional notes, in two volumes, under the title al-Ha~d1ra al-islamiyyafi I-qarn al- rdbi' al-hijrd, 'asr al-nah~da fi i-islam, was published by M. CA. Abd Rida (Beirut, 1967). By "renaissance" is meant primarily a revival of ancient classical learning. It appears primafacie equally legitimate to apply the term "renaissance" to Islam as it is to speak of a Carolingian, twelfth-century, Byzantine, Italian or German renaissance. Antiquity was not the same for medieval Islam as it was for the Italian Renais- sance, but neither was it the same for the European Middle Ages. E. R. Curtius, European Literature and the Latin Middle Ages, trans. W. R. Trask (New York, 1963), p. 19, speaks of "medieval Antiquity," i.e., "Antiquity as the Middle Ages saw it." Nor does the circumstance that the high- culture Islamic Renaissance was confined to a "creative minority" detract from its standing. This elitism is true of all periods of cultural dynamism. Characterizing his period, Immanuel Kant wrote that "If someone asks are we living in an enlightened age today? the answer would be, No." But he then went on to say, "we are living in an Age of Enlighten- ment"; "Beantwortung der Frage: Was Ist Aufklarung?" Werke, IV, 174; cited by Peter Gay, The Enlightenment: an Interpretation (New York, 1966), p. 20. H. Reckendorf, in his Forward to the posthumously pub- lished work by Mez, states that the author was dissatisfied with the title. The word "Renaissance," Reckendorf points out, occurs once, at the beginning of chapter eighteen; and the introductory sentences in chapters fourteen and nineteen are also relevant. In chapter nineteen, Mez states that tenth- century geography was a child of the Renaissance of the third/ninth century, referring to al-Kindi as a main trans- mitter of Greek learning. Mez thus regarded both the ninth and tenth centuries as the Renaissance of Islam, and by this he meant primarily the transmission of Greek learning to the Islamic world. The initial paragraphs of chapter fourteen (on law) relate to a revival (Wiederaufleben) of ancient Graeco- Roman teachings. And in chapter nineteen (on religion) Mez speaks of a transformation of Islam in the third and fourth centuries (A.H.) by a revival of the Hellenistic-Christian heritage in the form of a new religious ideal, called macrifa, which is nothing more than the ancient Gnosis resurrected in its birthplace. This revived Gnosis became predominant during these two centuries; taking the form of rationalism and scholastic theology in the camp of the enlightened, and in other circles as mysticism. S. D. Goitein, "Changes in the Middle East (950-1150)," in D. S. Richards, ed., Islamic</page><page sequence="14">148 Journal of the American Oriental Society 104.1 (1984) A cosmopolitan spirit pervaded the tenth-century Baghdad school of Aristotle studies, which united scholars of diverse religious persuasions sharing a common language and devotion to ancient wisdom.5 Abui Zakariyyd' Yahyd b. 'AdT, the fountainhead of this school of translators, commentators and philoso- phers, was a Jacobite Christian. He was a pupil of the great Muslim philosopher, Alfarabi. Alfarabi's own teacher in philosophy was the Nestorian Yiihannd b. Hayldn, and he had ties with the prominent Nestorian translator-commentator, Mattd b. Yiinus. Syriac-speak- ing Christian scholars were the main transmitters of the tradition of the Greek philosophical schools of Alexandria to the tenth-century Baghdad school. Among Ibn 'AdT's immediate disciples were the Nes- torian Abu l-Khayr al-Hasan b. Suwar b. al-Khammdr (Khumdr), and the Jacobite Abil 'All 'TsC b. Ishaq b. Zur'a, as well as eminent Muslims, such as Muham- mad b. Ishdq al-Warraq, known as Ibn al-Nadim, cTsd b. 'AlT (son of the famous Vizier 'AlT b. Isa), Abui Sulayman al-SijistanT and Abil Hayyan al- Tawh.dT. The famous philosopher-historian-courtier, Abui 'AlT Miskawayh, also had close contacts with this school, as did the Jewish philosophers Wahb b. Yacish and Abu l-Khayr Dawiid b. Muisaj. Abil Hay- yan al-TawhTdT's vivid portrayals of cultural activity in Baghdad during this period reveal that in the circle of Abui Sulayman al-SijistdnT, and in the general intel- lectual ambience, Muslims, Christians, Jews and pagans, from all parts of the Islamic empire, shared in common cultural pursuits, stimulated by the study of the ancients.5' The cosmopolitan atmosphere breathed by learned circles in the Renaissance of Islam was inspired by the impact of the ancient classical legacy-by the "ecu- menical power of antiquity."52 Thefaldsifa were con- scious of the universal spirit of the ancient legacy and Civilization, 950-1150 (Oxford, 1973), pp. 20-21, com- menting upon the kinship of the title of the book by Mez with that of the famous work of his Basel compatriot Jacob Burckhardt, notes the difference between the two-whereas Burckhardt stressed the renaissance of classical culture in fifteenth and sixteenth-century Italy, Mez hardly discussed a revival of the classics. "The renaissance which he really has in mind is the revival of the pre-Arabic ancient East, which he underlines about forty times in his book, describing it partly with approval, but mostly with abhorrence." H. A. R. Gibb, in "An Interpretation of Islamic History," Studies on the Civilization of Islam (Boston, 1962), pp. 17-18, applies the term "Islamic Renaissance" to the fourth, fifth and sixth centuries (tenth to twelfth), intending by this a certain cul- tural and intellectual development in an atmosphere of rela- tive tolerance and having a personal and individual character. See also F. Rosenthal, The Classical Heritage in Islam, pp. 12-13 (cited above, p. 144). 50 On this school, see R. Walzer, "New Light on the Arabic Translations of Aristotle," in Greek into Arabic (Cambridge, Mass., 1962), pp. 60-113, especially pp. 65ff., and the pio- neering study by M. Meyerhof, "Von Alexandrien nach Bagdad," Sitzungsberichte der preussischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, phil.-hist. Klasse (Berlin, 1930), pp. 389-429, especially pp. 413ff. The philological acumen of the school, documented by Walzer-the patient search for good manu- scripts, the collation of variant readings in editing, the industry in interpreting-is an essential ingredient of the humanistic enterprise. "A humanist," says E. K. Rand, Foun- ders of the Middle Ages, p. 102, is (inter alia) "one who adores critical editions with variants and variorum notes; one who has a passion for manuscripts, which he would like to discover, beg, borrow or steal...." "' In the ninth and tenth centuries there are a number of examples of assemblies (majdlis) of cultivated men, motivated by a common love of free thought, who found a common denominator in reason and thus rose above their particular religious differences. R. Dozy, in Journal Asiatique, Fifth Series, Vol. 2 (1853), p. 93, translates a text by Abd 'Abdalldh al-HumaydT, who quotes a pious Andalusian theologian, Aba 'Umar b. Muhammad al-SacdT, who visited such meet- ings on two occasions and was scandalized by what he saw; see also Dozy, Histoire des Musulmans d'Espagne (Leiden, 1932), II, p. 126. The idea that all religions are symbolic representations of the truth no doubt contributed to the atmosphere of a free exchange of ideas; see G. Quadri, La philosophic arabe dans leurope medievale (Paris, 1960), p. 62. A cultivated ideology of friendship also ministered to the success of these encounters. Ibn al-Muqaffa' provides an ideology of friendship for Gesinningsgemeinschaften in his al-Adab al-kabTr; see G. Richter, Studien zur Geschichte der alteren arabischen Furstenspiegel (Leipzig, 1932), pp. 18-19; and see M. J. Kister's Introduction to his edition of al- SulamT, Kitdb dddb al-suhba (Jerusalem, 1954) pp. 11-12. One thinks also of the friendship and spiritual relation existing in philosophical schools of antiquity (e.g., the Stoics, Epicureans and Neoplatonists) and during the Italian Renais- sance (the circle of Marsilio Ficino). 52 On the internationality of science and learning see Jaeger, "Die Antike im wissenschaftlichen Austausch der Nationen," in Humanistische Reden und Vortrdge, pp. 178-85, espe- cially pp. 180-81.

Ishaq al-Kindi, the first of the latter-day philosophers of Islam, in his Intro- duction to the Study of Aristotle, distinguished be- tween "the human sciences" (al-'ulflm al-insaniyya) (or "the human science" [al-'ilm al-insanf]) and "the divine science" (al- 'ilm al-ilhAT). The human sciences are "acquired through research and the effort and industry of man." These sciences, which he surveyed in his Introduction, and sought to introduce into the Islamic world, were equivalent, in his view, to the syllabus of late Greek philosophy. The divine science he equated with prophecy or revelation, acquired without effort.55 The guiding principle of the Islamic philosophers, receptiveness to ancient and foreign ideas, was elo- quently expressed by al-KindT: "We ought not to be ashamed of appreciating the truth and of acquiring it wherever it comes from, even if it comes from races distant and nations different from us. For the seeker of truth nothing takes precedence over the truth, and there is no disparagement of the truth, nor belittling either of him who speaks it or of him who conveys it. (The status of) no one is diminished by the truth; rather does the truth ennoble all."56 Zeitschrift fur die kulturellen Beziehungen Deutschlands zum Ausland, Jahrgang I (mit Geleitwort von C. H. Becker) (Ber- lin, 1931), 93b. Jaeger speaks of "die Renaissance der antiken Philosophie im arabischen Osten," on the basis of which developed "die erste grosse internationale Wissenschafts- epoche, die die Welt gesehen hat"; cited by Kraemer, Das Problem der islamisehen Kulturgesehichte, p. 33 and note 1 on p. 60.

On the concept of "Ancients" and "Moderns" in antiquity and the Latin Middle Ages, see Curtius, pp. 251-55. The link was supposedly Yahya al- Nahwi (identified as Joannes Philoponos), who according to Arab traditions lived in the days of the Rashidfin caliphs, had contacts with the famous general 'Amr b. al-'As and was the teacher of Khalid b.

Whatever the origin of the anachronistic legends, the purpose they served was to link the terminal point of ancient Greek science and philosophy with the succeeding Arabo-Islamic civilization. This was reinforced by making Yahya al-Nahwi the teacher of the first Arab- Muslim scientist, Khalid b. YazTd. The historical facts of the transmission are described in a text by Alfarabi, On the Appearance of Philosophy, tracing the transfer of learning from Alexandria to Baghdad; Meyerhof, "Von Alexandrien nach Bagdad," pp. 405-406; Rosenthal, The Classical Heri- tage in Islam, pp. 50-51. The route described by Alfarabi was of course only one of the ways by which the ancient legacy passed to Islam. 54 The attitude of the Muslim "Orthodox" to the ancient sciences is discussed by I. Goldziher, Stellung der alten islamisehen Orthodoxie zu den antiken Wissensehaften (Ber- lin, 1916). Synonyms for 'ulam al-awa'il, noted by Goldziher, are Cu/am al-qudamda', al- cu/am al-qadrma. Goldziher cites Ibn TumlUs (d. 620/1223) on p. 3, note 6, who defines the ancient sciences as "those that are common to all nations and religious communities, that are ascribed to the faldsifa and called falsafa."

In his Classification of the Sciences, Alfarabi distin- guishes between logic, which posits common rules generally applying to the utterances (alfaz) of all nations, and grammar, which posits specific rules for the utterances of a particular nation.57 The issue of the relative merits of logic and grammar was keenly contested in the tenth century. At stake was the newly acquired status of the exponents of the Aristotelian tradition, represented by the Baghdad school, and the viability of their claim to possess the sole instrument and measure of human reasoning. This confrontation recalls the medieval European battle of the seven arts, especially the conflict between the proponents of grammatical and literary studies versus the champions of logic and natural science. The issue was debated on a celebrated occasion between the philosopher Matta b. YUnus and the versatile philologist-jurist AbO Sa'Td al-Srafli in 320/932, in the presence of the Vizier Ibn al-Furat and an avid audience of savants. The out- come was considered a decisive victory for grammar over logic.58 Al-Sirafl's adamant stand was surely a challenge to the champions of logic, raising serious questions concerning the philosophers' claim to pos- sess a universal canon of right reasoning. The cudgel was picked up by Alfarabi and his partisans.59 The major theses propounded by Matta b. YUnus, relevant to our theme, may be summarized as follows: Logic, the touchstone of right reason and correct speech, is inquiry into "intelligible notions and apprehended meanings," which are the same for all men and nations. The Greeks surpass all other nations in pur- suit of wisdom and propagation of the arts and sciences.60 Peoples and nations are unequal in intel- ligence "by nature," though this inequality is sur- mountable by instruction. Al-Sirafr's contentions give the impression of a sophisticated defense of the tradi- tionalist camp: Right speech is discriminated from wrong speech by the grammar of a specific language- there is no right speech in general-and valid meaning is discerned by the intellect ('aql). Logic was estab- lished by a Greek (Aristotle), in accordance with the conventions of the Greek language. Why must Turks, Indians, Persians or Arabs accept Greek as judge and arbiter? Intelligible notions and apprehended meanings are attainable only by a specific language. The Greek language is not a universal canon of reasoning. Logic always judge the truth by what is said, not by who says it; cited by H. Chadwick, Early Christian Thought and the Classical Tradition (New York, 1966), p. 44. Ihsd' al- 'culm, second edition, ed. Angel Gonzalez Palencia (Madrid, 1953), p. 33. On Alfarabi's interest in the relationship between logic and grammar, see the Introduction by M. Mahdi to his edition of Kitib al-huraf (Book of Letters) (Beirut, 1969), pp. 44-48. 58 A version is preserved by AbU Hayyan al-Tawh-idT in his al-Imtd' wal-mu'dnasa ed. A. AmTn and A. al-Zayn (Cairo, 1953), I, 108-28, as reported by al-STrafi and the grammarian Abu 'Isa al-Rummianlt (whose interest in logic and grammar is well attested-he was accused of blending them). See D. S. Margoliouth, "The Discussion between Abul Bishr Matta and AbO Sa'cd al-Sirafi on the Merits of Logic and Gram- mar," JRAS, 1905, pp. 79-129; and the study by M.

Al- Tawhfdi raised the issue of logic and grammar in his ques- tions to Miskawayh, al-Hawdmil wal-shawimil, Nos. 114 (p. 265), 115 (pp. 266ff.) and 132 (p. 293); see Arkoun, "L'humanisme arabe," Part One, p. 105ff. (Miskawayh, of course, adopts the position of the faldsifa); and J. van Ess, "The Logical Structure of Islamic Theology," in Logic in Classical Islamic Culture, p. 21 and note 2. 60 The intellectual superiority of the Greeks was a common theme from the time of al-Jahiz. See, for example, the characterizations by al-Jahiz, Sa'id al-AndalusT and Moshe b. 'Ezra, translated by F. Rosenthal in The Classical Heritage in Islam, pp. 38-45.</page><page sequence="17">KRAEMER: Humanism in the Renaissance of Islam 151 is the correct structure of language. Thus, since logic is understood to be the "logic of language," there is a logic of Arabic and a logic of Greek. There is no universal logic any more than there is a universal grammar or universal language. The arts and sciences are equally available to all rational men; all nations are potentially equal in intelligence; the Greeks, like other nations, excelled in the sciences they preferred 6 1 to pursue. The faldsifa regarded philosophy as the supreme goal of a humanizing education-the capstone of the sciences and the way to human perfection, happiness and salvation. Miskawayh, in an intriguing passage, represents philosophy as the only "true education" (adab haqTqT/alLthinj paideia), and as the path to salvation (najdt/s&amp;tjria).62 The ideal education, ac- cording to Miskawayh, occurs when a youth happens to be reared according to the education of the religious law (adab al-sharl'a), carrying out its duties until he is habituated in them. There follows the study of ethical works, which confirm the good habits (ddab) and acquired virtues in the soul by proofs. Then comes the study of arithmetic and geometry, accus- toming the individual to veracious speech and valid proof. Thereafter, he advances until he reaches the ultimate level of man, becoming perfectly happy.63 The opposite course, of an unfortunate youth, occurs when he is reared according to the false values-the mendacity and immorality--of obscene poetry, such as that of Imru' I-Qays, al-Nabigha and the like.64 Certain key terms in this text recall a passage on the education of youth in the Tabula Cebetis (Kebitos Thibaiou pinax), the Arabic translation of which is incorporated by Miskawayh in his JdwTdhdn khiradh." The Tabula Cebetis discriminates between the "true paideia," called al-adab al-haqTqT or al-adab al-sahTh ( althinj paideia of the Greek source) and what is called pseudopaideia; in Arabic, al-adab alladhT laysa bi-haqq, or al-adab al-kadhib. The subjects belonging to pseudopaideia are the propaedeutic arts leading to true paideia.66 These subjects are said to be "grammar (nahw), geodesy (misdha), arithmetic (hisdb), geometry 6' Al-Sirafi also pricked the hybris of his philohellene rival by pointing out that he knew no Greek. Mahdi, "Language and Logic," pp. 58-61, presents al-Siraff as a follower of Ibn Kullab and his "popular Platonism" and the underlying issue as "a conflict between popular Platonism and academic Aristotelianism." It is conceivable that his view was influenced by the tendency of the Basra school of grammarians to identify the laws of language with the laws of thought and nature, language thus being a "mirror" reflecting reality; and that 'aql was for him, like that of the grammarians, jurists and Mu'tazilites, a kind of natural light of reason, as it was for the Stoics, for example, as opposed to the syllogistic reasoning of the Aristotelians. 62 TahdhTb al-akhldq (the Refinement of Character), ed. C. K. Zurayk (Beirut, 1967), pp. 49-50. On this passage, see Walzer, "Some Aspects of Miskawayh's Tahdhib al-Akhlaq," Greek into Arabic, pp. 232-33 Walzer compares adab haqrq7 to alithis paideia; however, see immediately below. 63 The adab al-sharr'a, says Walzer (ibid.), conveys the truth in religious form, and thus corresponds to the role of the Greek laws in Plato's Laws and the kind of mousikP permitted in the Republic. Walzer relates this to Alfarabi's views on the religious training of youths. The notion that following this upbringing one can study philosophical ethics Walzer traces to Nicomachean Ethics, 1, 7, 1095b 44f. Cf. Miskawayh, al-Fawz al-asghar (Ms. Brit. Mus. Or. 6335, fol. 56a), where he says that the prophets, physicians of souls, cure their ignorance by true paideia (al-adab al-haqq), guiding them in sound habits (al-dddb al-sahTha) and salutary actions. 64 The rejection of poetry reflects the exclusion of poets from the ideal polity outlined in the Republic. See Jaeger, Paideia, II, pp. 211ff., on Plato's revision of Greek paideia. It may be noted in passing that precisely the charming features of Homer (for a Westerner) that Schaeder (above) declared offensive to Islam (Homer's portrayal of gods and humans on the same level) was also offensive and uneduca- tional in the eyes of Plato, one of the main moulders of Greek and Western paideia. Cf. Averroes' Commentary on Plato's Republic, ed. and trans. E. I. J. Rosenthal (Cam- bridge, 1969); trans. R. Lerner, Averroes on Plato's "Repub- lic" (Ithaca and London, 1974), p. 33 of the text/ p. 24 of Lerner's translation; and p. 34/27, where the poems of the Arabs are cited as deserving exclusion. Parts of Averroes' Commentary go back to Alfarabi, and one may assume that the substitution of Arab poets for Homer and other Greek poets was made by Alfarabi and his successors. 65 Al- Hikma al-khdlida.

They are said to be like a restraining bridle for youths. These branches of learning are deemed useful for the acqui- sition of true paideia.67 The theory of education of the faldsifa was an extension of the Graeco-Arabic translation enterprise, and was inspired by Hellenistic, predominantly Neo- pythagorean, models.68 The central terms for "educa- tion" are adab and ta'dTb, corresponding to paideia/ paideusis.69 The adTb is the paideutos, possessor of paideia. Their pedagogical theory, founded on the equation of adab = paideia, understood as the foun- dation of ethics and social structure, was not re- stricted to their circles but penetrated into the "general current of Muslim thought." The essential features of this philosophical education appear in a number of texts devoted to pedagogy: "Exhortation on the Edu- cation of Young Men," ascribed to Plato, preserved by Miskawayh in JawTdhan khiradh;70 the excerpts, mainly ascribed to Plato, contained in Abu I-Hasan al-'AmirT's al-Sa'dda wal-is'dd;7l and the pedagogical section in the Oikonomikos of the Neophythagorean Bryson.i2 The "Exhortation on the Education of Young Men" sees the main goal of education as "the formation of character and the acquisition of good manners and ways of behavior. "7 The exhortation is aimed at teachers (mu'allimiun) and tutors (mu'addiban), ad- dressed in one place as "you brethren who love knowl- edge." Youth must acquire knowledge of warfare and tactics, as well as music, for it is one of the four arts (al-ta'alTm al-arba'a)i4 The goal of education, ac- cording to the pedagogical passage in al-Sa'dda wal- is'ad, is the attainment of happiness, the ultimate aim of philosophy. The text begins with definitions of adab ("education"), mutaaddib ("the individual under- going education") and adlb ("the individual who is the product of education"). Plato, it is said, equates adab with philosophy (tikma, lit. "wisdom").75 An- other definition is introduced in the first person (wa- aqulu): "Adab is human wisdom (al-hikma al-insd- niyya), and human wisdom is knowledge about the conduct leading to happiness."76 The aim of adab, Plato is quoted as saying, is to produce the good man who exhibits self-control. Plato is then said to equate the person undergoing education (muta'addib) with the man of reason (nktiq). At the beginning of the Joly sees the Tabula Cebetis as of basically Neopythagorean character, with an admixture of Cynico-Stoic ideas. 67 LIe., useful but not necessary, and they do not contribute to moral progress; see Joly, p. 32. If, as we assume, Mis- kawayh's use of the expression adab haqiqT in Tahdhfb al- akhldq was influenced by this passage, he introduced the adab al-sharTla before the pseudo-/ propaideutics, thus giving a moral tone to this early training. He then places arithmetic and geometry (i.e., the mathematics) as a stepping-stone to the supreme level of man, as does the Tabula Cebetis. A similar curriculum is given by Miskawayh in his TartTb al- sa'adat wa-ma'atib al-'ulim (Cairo, 1928), pp. 60-61, in the name of the followers of Aristotle. Beginning with ethical works for refinement of the soul, the student goes on to mathematics. Miskawayh then specifies higher learning: physics, and knowledge of the real essences of existent beings (metaphysics). 68 The ensuing discussion of the theory of education of the falasifa is based on F. Rosenthal, Knowledge Triumphant; the Concept of Knowledge in Medieval Islam (Leiden, 1970), pp. 284-89. 69 Ta 'dib is the process of education, in the sense of teaching, training, etc.; adab is the result of this process. The English word "education" serves for both process and result. 70 Wasiyyat Afldp7n -IT ta'd-b al-ahddth, in al-Hikma al- khalida, ed. Badawl, pp. 270-78; see Rosenthal, "Some Pythagorean Documents transmitted in Arabic," Orientalia, 10 (1941), pp. 383-95, where the ascription to Plato and the Neopythagorean character of the "Exhortation" are discussed. 71 Al-Sa'dda wal-is'cdfi l-sTra l-insdniyya, fascimile of the copy prepared by M.

It may be suggested that the original model for this was the Republic. Music is recom- mended here as one of the four arts, an allusion to the quadrivium. 75 See Jaeger, Paideia, II, pp. 213ff. 76 A question exists as to the identity of this spokesman, who is not necessarily the author of al-Sa'dda wal-is'ad (Rosenthal, p. 287). On page 6 of the work, after the author (Abu 1-Hasan) is quoted, a comment by a speaker is intro- duced in the same manner. It is possible that he was a pupil of the author, who took down his teacher's lecture notes, then adding his own comments. The possibility that he was a redactor of the text cannot be excluded. His views are of course not necessarily those of the author of the work.</page><page sequence="19">KRAEMER: Humanism in the Renaissance of Islam 153 educational process, according to Plato, what is serious (jidd) is presented in the form of play (hazi), by means of untrue myths that contain adab-for example, in the form of poetry extolling virtue and modesty, not that which permits license (muffin) and pleasure.77 Youths must believe early in life that good and happiness are acquired by obedience to laws and elders, and that chiefs and educators induce them to happiness and virtues by means of good education. They should be trained to be brave and defiant of death, and be taught shooting, writing and swimming. A section is devoted to adab in the sense of etiquette (e.g., of eating, drinking, etc.). The higher education of philosophy is introduced by a propaedeutic cur- riculum ascribed to Plato: arithmetic (said to be in- dispensible for whomever is determined to become a man), geodesy, the geometry of solids, astronomy, music, and dialectics (jadal) and logic (mantiq). A model philosophical curriculum is embedded in an Arabic biography of Aristotle.78 It deserves to be cited in extenso: When [Aristotle] reached the age of eight, his father brought him to Athens, the city that was the gathering place for the philosophers and sages. His father turned him over to the tutelage of the poets, grammarians (schoolmasters) and rhetoricians. He learned [what they taught] thoroughly in nine years. [This branch of learning was considered by them "the comprehensive" (al-muhft), i.e., the study of language, since all men require it as the instrument and way of ascent to all wisdom and virtue, and beacon for the attainment of every branch of learning.]79 It happened that there was then a group of philosophers who disparaged the learning of these people and chided those who studied with them and prided themselves in their arts. Among them were Epicurus and Pythagoras.80 They claimed that their branch of learning required nothing of philosophy, and that those who studied this were not philosophers. For the grammarians were merely teach- ers of youths; the poets masters of prattle, lying and obscenity; and the rhetoricians masters of obsequi- ousness, contentiousness, viciousness and deceit, al- though they were the ones who were the judges and the arbiters at that time. Learning of this, Aristotle was seized with indignation on their behalf. He de- fended them, corroborating their contentions, saying: Philosophy cannot dispense with these branches of learning, for logic (mantiq) is an instrument (alal organon) for their knowledge. And poetry, rhetoric, grammar and brevity embellish logic. And [Aristotle] said that man's superiority over beasts is in speech (mantiqilogos), and the most worthy of humanity (insdniyya) is the most accomplished in his speech and the most skilled in apposite and concise self-expression. After this, he is able to arrange everything properly so that (or: until) he attains the supreme [level] of phi- losophy at the ultimate [stage] of humanity. For philosophy is the noblest of the arts and the chief of 77 Rosenthal, p. 287, note 3, refers to Republic 376e-377a. On the educational value of untrue stories, see Averroes' Commentary on Plato's Republic, p. 32/24; Jaeger, Paideia, 11, pp. 211-12. Unlike the poetry of Homer and Hesiod, the stories told to children do contain "a modicum of truth." Neoplatonists (e.g., Porphyry) treated Homer allegorically (much as Philo and Alexandrian Christian philosophers, e.g., Clement of Alexandria, read the Scriptures), thus uncovering philosophical truths in his poetry. 78 The text appears in the Siwan al-hikma, in the entry on Aristotle, pp. 135-36, and is the basis of this translation. An almost identical text appears in al-Mubashshir b. Fatik, Mukhtir al-hikam, pp. 179-80, from whence it was copied by Ibn Ab! Usaybi'a, cUyan al-anbd' fI tabaqit al-atibba' ed. N. Rida (Beirut, 1965), pp. 88-89. The text of al-Mubash- shir b. Fatik is translated by I. During, Aristotle in the Ancient Biographical Tradition (Goteborg, 1957), pp. 197-98, and by A. Baumstark, Aristotles bei den Syrern vom V. - VIIl. Jahrhundert (Leipzig, 1900), pp. 128-29. The source of the biography, only partially given here, was "Ptolemy the Stranger (al-Gharlib)" (according to Lippert, Baumstark and During). 79 The bracketed material is from the text of al-Mubashshir b. Fatik. It is not in the Siwdn al-hikma. The Siwdn version seems to have undergone abbreviation. Another, less likely possibility, is that the text of Mukhtir al-hikam was ex- panded. 80 See During, pp. 202 and 385, who identifies Pythagoras as Lycon Pythagoreus. (Badawi, Mukhtar al-hikam, p. 179, note 8, suggests that Prodicus and Protagoras, the Sophists, are intended.) This passage reflects the "acrimonious polemic of the Epicureans" against Aristotle and the Peripatetics concerning their attitude to philosophy and paideia. During points out that there is no trace of this polemic in the Neoplatonic Vitae of Aristotle or in the Prolegomena to his works. The passage, he asserts, must have been in Ptolemy's Biography, and was of great interest to the Arabs because of their passionate concern with rhetoric. It may be added that these subjects in the framework of an Arabic curriculum would have included the native "Arab sciences" (grammar, lexicography, poetry, rhetoric).</page><page sequence="20">154 Journal of the American Oriental Society 104.1 (1984) the sciences. And it must be expressed by means of the most valid reasoning; most eloquent speech; purist language; and noblest expression, furthest from defect, vulgarity and solecism. For such would undermine demonstrative proof and the light of wisdom, falls short of what is required; confuses the listener; cor- rupts meaning and inculcates doubt. When [Aristotle] reached this point, having commanded all we have mentioned, and having thoroughly mastered the arts of grammar, poetry and rhetoric, he applied himself avidly to the study of [ethics, politics, physics, mathe- matics and metaphysics].' He then attached himself to Plato.... In sum, grammar, rhetoric and poetry are necessary for logic, the organon of philosophy, which is the noblest science, bringing one to the ultimate stage of humanity. Philosophy consists of ethics, politics, physics, mathematics and metaphysics. The curriculum that emerges is thus: 1. Grammar, rhetoric, poetry 2. Logic 3. Philosophy: ethics, politics, physics, mathematics, metaphysics.82 The "comprehensive" education mentioned herein is probably an attempt to render hi enkyklios (paideia).83 The biographical detail reflects Aristotle's actual view that a basic general education is a prerequisite for higher philosophical studies.84 The enkyklios paideia, attested among writers in the Graeco-Roman period, meant "The usual everyday education received by all," i.e., "general education" or "general culture." It was used in two senses: (1) the general culture of an educated gentleman; (2) the basic learning, or propae- deutics (propaideumata), serving as an introduction to advanced education.85 The second sense is intended in this biography of Aristotle. The propaideutics became the seven liberal arts (artes liberates). Drawn up in late antiquity (about the mid-first century B.C.) and transmitted to the Latin Middle Ages, they became the cultural and educational program of the Renais- sance humanists (i.e., the trivium-grammar, rhetoric and dialectic-and quadrivium-geometry, arithmetic, astronomy and theory of music).86 Alfarabi's well- known classification of the sciences, which presents a curriculum of higher learning, may be taken as rep- resentative of the philosophical education of the faldsifa: 1. Linguistic sciences (grammar, syntax, writing, reading and poetry) 2. Logic 3. Mathematics (arithmetic, geometry, optics, astron- omy, music, technology and mechanics) 4. Physics 5. Metaphysics The bracketed words are from al-Mubashshir; the Siwln settles for the word "philosophy" without specifying its parts. Later, in the biography of Aristotle, Siwln al-hikma, p. 137, it is said that his books and gnomai are called "the knowledge of attaining and listening to the truth" ('ilm isabat al-haqq wa-samd'uhii). The reading in Mukhtir al-hikam, p. 181 (ijabat al-haqq), should be corrected accordingly; cf. Metaph. II, 1, 993a30-b4, and Nicomachean Ethics 1, 7, 1098a 23-25. 82 This is a classic Aristotelian classification of the sciences. Philosophy proper is divided into theoretical and practical (as well as productive, which does not appear here), the theoretical is subdivided into physics, mathematics and meta- physics; and the practical into politics, economics and ethics. Mathematics was further subdivided by Ammonius Hermiae into arithmetic, geometry, astronomy and music (the quadri- vium); see H. A. Wolfson, "The Classification of Sciences in Mediaeval Jewish Philosophy," in Studies in the History of Philosophy and Religion, ed. I. Twersky and G. H. Williams (Cambridge, Mass., 1973), I, pp. 493-545, especially p. 493. 8 See During, p. 202, noting also that the Vita Marciana has tin ton eleutherln paideian. Baumstark renders it hi enkyklios. 84 During, ibid., calls attention to Politics, VIII, 3, 1338 b2, etc. 8 Marrou, A History of Education in Antiquity, pp. 243- 45, 303, 527-28; H. Fuchs, "Enkyklios Paideia," Reallexikon fur Antike und Christentum, 5(1962), pp. 365-98; H. Koller, "'Enkyklios Paideia,"' Glotta, 34(1955), pp. 174-89. The word "encyclopaedia," derived from this expression, is a modernism having a different meaning (Marrou, p. 244; Koller, p. 174). 86 Marrou, pp. 244-45; Kristeller, Renaissance Thought, I, p. 10. In the Latin Middle Ages, prior to the rise of Aristo- telianism in the twelfth century, the artes liberates were generally viewed as the quintessence of philosophy. In the twelfth century a youthful revolt took place against the domination of the traditional school curriculum, consisting of the auctores, grammar and rhetoric. The traditional iden- tification of the liberal arts with philosophy was eventually expunged when Aristotelianism assumed full force. See Cur- tius, European Literature in the Latin Middle Ages, pp. 41- 42, 53,213; C. H. Haskins, The Renaissance of the 12th Century (New York, 1957). In the Islamic milieu, on the other hand, the propaedeutic nature of the enkyklios paideia was axiomatic from the start.</page><page sequence="21">KRAEMER: Humanism in the Renaissance of Islam 155 6. Politics (including jurisprudence [fiqh] and specu- lative theology [kaldm])87 Underlying this scheme is the Aristotelian division of the sciences into theoretical and practical. The outline is, in grosso modo, the same as the curriculum con- tained in the biography of Aristotle, which presumably reflects the approach of Aristotelianism in late anti- quity. The linguistic sciences and mathematics contain the liberal arts (trivium and quadrivium). The native Arab sciences are subsumable in this syllabus under linguistics and politics. The curriculum is thus a splen- did synthesis of the ancient and native sciences. The significance for medieval Islamic civilization of the philosophical theory of education becomes com- pellingly evident when the Graeco-Arabic gnomologia are consulted. This vast and impressive repository of popular wisdom reached circles beyond the narrow conclaves of philosophers and even courtiers.88 The idea that education (adab = paideia/paideusis) is the greatest good and highest human ideal is a salient theme.89 The Menandersentenzen, for example, con- tain the following: "Education is for man a treasury that cannot be robbed." "Education makes everything agreeable." "Education is like a haven for all men."90 Ibn Durayd's Kitdb al-mujtand preserves the following quotations: "Asked about the most beautiful animal, he [Aristotle] replied: 'A human being adorned with a good education."'"Aristotle said: 'Education is an adornment for the rich, and it enables the poor to live among friends (or: 'to live the life of the free')." "Asked about the most pleasurable things in the world, [Socrates] replied, 'Education and instruction and looking at things not seen before."'"Asked in which way education benefited young men, [Socrates] re- plied: 'If the only use of education were to keep them from evil ways, it would be enough."'9' From the collection of sayings entitled Mukhtdr min kalam al- hukamd' al-arba'a al-akdbir the following samples on the theme of adab/paideia may be cited: "Lack of education is a cause of every evil" (Pythagoras). "Education adorns the riches of the rich and conceals the poverty of the poor" (Aristotle). "[Aristotle] said: 'Accustom the soul to [all] the parts of education because they are the source and the repository of the marvels of thought and the subtleties of speculation."92 87 Ihsa' al-'uliam, pp. 7-9; see Rosenthal, The Classical Heritage in Islam, pp. 54-55. 88 See D. Gutas, Greek Wisdom Literature in Arabic Trans- lation; A Study of the Graeco-Arabic Gnomologia (New Haven, 1975), pp. 1 and 459, who points out that the gnomo- logia were in "constant circulation" and that "of all the Greek writings that passed to the Arabs, the gnomologia were unquestionably the most popular." Gutas cites (p. 460) al-TawhidT's al-Imtd' wal-mu'anasa, II, 23-26, to show that a typical adab work had to edify and delight, and that sayings and anecdotes of the philosophers were included along with quotations from Arabic poetry, Hadith and Qur'an. That the reception of this material was not smooth is shown by Gutas (p. 461) on the basis of another passage from al-Tawhidi, this time from al-Basi'ir wal-dhakhd'ir, ed. I. Keilani (Damascus, 1964), 1, p. 476: "The sayings. of these people occupy an admirable position and possess an edifying quality that is praiseworthy. Do not be adverse to these men, because they are among the virtuous. May God make us benefit from their wise sayings, and may He protect us from the evil of what is said about them." In this connection a comment by the Saffarid king of Sijistan, AbU Ja'far b. Banuyah (Banflwayh) (ruled 293/906 to 352/963), preserved in the Siwan al-hikma, p. 316, may be quoted. Al- Sijistani, a protege of the king, writes: "[AbU Ja'far] used to preserve (or: memorize) the sayings, anecdotes, biographies and affairs of the Greeks in a way I have seen in no one else. He used to say, 'These are gold nuggets and like uncast raw metal.' The anecdotes of the Greeks caused him such wonder that he would say, 'What will be thought of a people whose jesting, conviviality and relaxation are such when they become serious and resolutely realize their natural powers?' Then he said, 'I am fond of something ascribed to Democra- tes (Dimocritus): The one who swims in our sea has no shore but himself."' 89 On adab in Graeco-Arabic translation literature, see S. M. Afnan, A Philosophical Lexicon in Persian and Arabic (Beirut, 1969), p. 4. Apart from the equivalence with paideia (in the various forms of both), it was also used by al- Dimashq! to render phronisis ("prudence") (also adlb= phronimos). 90 M. Ullmann, Die arabische Oberlieferung der sogenann- ten Menandersentenzen (Wiesbaden, 1961), pp. 17 (2), 20 (24), 67 (29). The first sentence recalls the anecdote concerning Stilpo which tells that, having had his property plundered, he refused indemnity since no one had taken away his paideia-he still had his eloquence (logos) and knowledge (epistEme); Diogenes Laertius, Lives of Eminent Philosophers, ed. and trans.

See also pp. 93, 169 and 187. The sentences cited here are a</page><page sequence="22">156 Journal of the American Oriental Society 104.1 (1984) In its wider use during the 'Abbasid epoch, adab conveyed the ethical, social and intellectual message of Latin humanitas. It connoted the values of urbane, civil, courteous, refined and elegant conduct; the result of good breeding and education. (And thus also the etiquette of behavior in a specific activity, as adab al- mucallim wal-mutacallim.) On the intellectual level, adab was initially the kind of humanistic educational training in profane Arab culture that rendered a man urbane and refined. In due course, contact with alien cultures expanded the content of adab to include non- Arabic literature, thus expressive of a more universal humanism. The main representatives of this trend are al-Jahiz, Ibn al-Muqaffac, al-Taniikhli and al-Taw- hTdT. The literary production of this broadly humanis- tic adab was, in the words of Gabrieli, "the backbone of high cAbbasid culture."93 The main bearers of this urbane humanistic culture were the secretaries, scribes, civil servants, litterateurs and courtiers, who plied state chancelleries and pro- vided delight and edification for rulers and their entourage.94 In this milieu, wit, grace, eloquence and charm were highly apprized. Elegance (zarf) was the epitome of this cultural refinement and its virtual synonym. This refined elegance was married with "good sense and insight into the nature of people and the ways of the world." The education of the secre- tarial class was encyclopaedic, encompassing Arab and alien (Greek and Persian) learning, thus exposing the secretarial class to charges of heretical deviation. Von Grunebaum views adab in this environment as "a humanistic rather than a vocational aspiration in raising scribe and litterateur to the level of ideal types."95 Adab renders paideia. Humanitas has its analogue in Arabic insdniyya ("Humanity"). The term insdniyya, as used by thefallsifa, means the quality men share in common, or human nature.96 But (like Cicero's hu- manitas) it also connotes being fully human, an aim small sample of gnomai with adab-paideia as a theme. It would be worthwhile to comb the gnomological literature for a content analysis of this motif. 93 See "Adab" by F. Gabrieli in The Encyclopaedia of Islam, New Edition, 1, pp. 175-76; C. A. Nallino, Raccolta di scritti editi e inediti (Rome, 1939-48), VI, pp. 1-17; F. Rosenthal, "Literature," in The Legacy of Islam, second edition, ed. J. Schacht and C. E. Bosworth (Oxford, 1974). pp. 324-27. The humanism of al-Jahiz cannot be discussed here but deserves mention. It is portrayed by Ch. Pellat in his numerous publications. Rosenthal epitomizes it thus: "A sceptical, searching, critical spirit was abroad in his time more than seems to have existed before in medieval Islam and more than was ever to be found later on. It allowed for the wide curiosity and the free-ranging wit that inform all of al-Jahiz's writings, large and small, whether they are dealing with animal lore, Arabic rhetoric and poetry, supposed racial and national characteristics, ethical qualities, human sexual behavior, the various professions and ways of making a living, or any of countless other matters" (p. 325). Al-Jdhiz peerlessly displayed Terence's famous Homo sum: humani nihil a me alienum puto. 94 For this and the following, see von Grunebaum, "Islamic Civilization," Modern Islam, p. 73, note 43; and especially Medieval Islam, pp. 250-57, and pp. 355-56, note ad loc. One may compare the contribution of the ars dictaminis to the rise of Renaissance humanism; see Kristeller, Renaissance Thought, 11, p. 4. On the ars dictaminis, see Curtius, Euro- pean Literature in the Latin Middle Ages, pp. 75f., 148f., 247, 353. 95 To this statement, von Grunebaum appends a footnote (Medieval Islam, p. 257, note 90), saying that "The principle difference between adab and the Greek educational ideals would be the absence, in adab, of the political element, the burgerliche Tuchtigkeit, to use H. von Arnim's expres- sion...." Similarly, he says ("Islamic Civilization," Modern Islam, p. 86) that "the basic difference between the Greek paideia and the Islamic educational ideal is that the Greek is ever aware of the state; the Muslim of the service of God." Therefore, even adab "lacks any element of civic virtue (although there has been citizen participation in certain periods through guilds, militia, 'chivalry' organizations, and the like)." See also "Islamic Studies and Cultural Research," p. 6. 96 Used today in the sense of "humanism" (e.g., by Badawi), insaniyya is a neologism, as pointed out by Gardet, La cite musulman, p. 273, note 1. The term is discussed by Alfarabi in Kitdb al-hurilf (Book of Letters), ed. M. Mahdi (Beirut, 1970), pp. 77-80, where it means "humanity" as the quality human beings have in common. He treats the term in connection with denominal or deadjectival masdars, e.g., insdniyya &lt; insdn = abyadiyya &lt; abyad and in a broader context of a discussion on "denoting." On pp. 111-12, Alfarabi ponders the term in connection with the -iyya formation in philosophical neologisms, e.g., the depronomi- nal huwiyya. He compares the phenomenon to other lan- guages, e.g., Persian hast ("is, exists") becomes hastT ("being, existence"); and mardum ("man") forms mardumT ("human- ity") (-insdniyya). It may be noted that, whereas mardumT</page><page sequence="23">KRAEMER: Humanism in the Renaissance of Islam 157 rather than a datum, the result of self-realization. Insaniyya is thus the end or perfection of man qua man.97 It is also the link binding men to one another. Qua human perfection, insdniyya is often synonymous with the exercise of reason (that which distinguishes man from animals). The use of reason, acquiring true wisdom, or philosophy, is equated by the faldsifa with supreme happiness (al-sacada [eudaimonia] al-qus- wd).98 It is sometimes said that human perfection, or happiness, is both speculative and practical-"a cer- tain knowledge and a certain way of life."99 There are levels of insaniyya; some men have a greater share than others. The most deficient men, says Miskawayh, have little reason: they are at the "horizon" of beasts, overpowered by their animal soul and given over to sensual pleasures, and deserve the title insdniyya in a limited sense only. They generally live at the extreme climes of the civilized world. In the middle climes, men tend to be of moderate disposi- tion, receptive to the form of intellect. Some of them are supremely receptive to reason, at the horizon between man and the divine, including those suscep- tible to inspiration and capable of pursuing philoso- phy, on whom the power of intellect and the light of truth overflow.'00 Happiness, common to all men qua men, is a function of reason which confers increasing degrees, or shares, of humanity.'0' Through insdniyya, by virtue of which man becomes truly human, the individual achieves a superior rank in his species.102 Only a few individuals attain the ultimate level of humanity; indeed, singly and over long periods of time.'03 The masses of mankind remain at a level close to that of bestiality, the limit of their reason (nutq) and discrimination (tamyTz) being a bestowal of some rational order to this bestiality, but they cannot dis- engage from it.'04 The ultimate level is attained by the perfectly wise man, who embraces all aspects of wis- dom, in knowledge and action, or by a prophet who reaches this rank by inspiration (ilham) and divine succor (tawJlq).105 connotes also "manliness, courtesy, politeness, bravery, civil- ity, generosity" (F. Steingass, A Comprehensive Persian- English Dictionary [London, 1963], p. 1213), insaniyya does not bear these connotations. For this semantic range the words murt 'a, or muruwwa &lt; imru' = "man" (cf. andreia, virtus) and adab were serviceable. 97 Alfarabi, Falsafat AristptdlTs (The Philosophy of Aris- totle), trans. M.

This anthropos teleios theme combines Neoplatonic, Christian, and Sufi motifs</page><page sequence="24">158 Journal of the American Oriental Society 104.1 (1984) The highest level of insdniyya is, paradoxically, beyond insdniyya, and is called divine. Miskawayh quotes Aristotle: "The endeavors of man should not be human, though he be a man; nor should he be satisfied with the endeavors of the mortal animal, though he be also mortal; rather he should strive with all his powers to live a divine life."'06 Like Miskawayh, al-'Amiri sees supreme human happiness as divine, but more so, and more in contradiction to human virtues and society. In defining happiness, al-'Amiri quotes Porphyry: "Happiness is the perfection of Man's form. Man's perfection-as a man-lies in his volun- tary actions. [On the other hand] Man's perfection- as a divine being (malak) and intellect-lies in con- templation. Related to its object, each of these two kinds of perfection is perfect [in itself], but if they were compared to each other, the human perfection would be found deficient."l'07 Al-cAmirT goes on with the argument of the Ethics, citing Aristotle: Human happiness is not supremely perfect because it is not self-sufficient-it needs the body for bodily virtues- whereas intellectual happiness is self-sufficient and considered divine. For none of the virtues may be ascribed to the divine save knowledge. And if we say that God is just, this is not because he engages in business transactions but from another aspect. This intellectual happiness, according to al-'Amiri, not only transcends human happiness; it destroys it. Al-cAmiri quotes Plato as saying that whoever pursues wisdom has time for it only, and lives as a recluse, cut off from all else considered the good things, such as wealth, honor, authority, friends, family, and even the virtues.'08 But people consider one who attains wis- dom by abandoning most good things and virtues to be at the extreme degree of heresy (bid'a), and deem his doctrine alien and reprehensible. For preferring these good things and virtues is humanity (insdniyya). And whoever abstains from them is not considered a man. Men honor virtuous people and despise those who are not, and often persecute and kill them.'09 The falasifa were alert to the rift between the en- lightened elite and the benighted masses, and the grave peril facing the one who seeks wisdom and perfection."0 The fate of Socrates was a paradigm and warning. They espied the masses with tolerant condescension and caution, cherishing little hope of universal enlightenment, scant expectation that brutish men could rise above their horizon. AbU Bakr al- RAzl's brand of rationalism appears to be of a different cast, closer in tone to the European Enlightenment. The Introduction to his Spiritual Medicine celebrates human reason and its role in the arts, sciences and achievements of mankind, and is reminiscent of the moving lines of Aeschylus in Prometheus Bound (440 ff.)."' In al-Razil's view, reason is sufficient with- out revelation. In his controversy with the Isma'ill, Abii HAtim al-RAzl, he contended that God's wisdom and mercy require that He inspire all human beings with moral awareness; there is no need for prophets and revelation."2 If men are bereft of philosophy and with the Aristotelian conception of human perfection. The supreme level of humanity is thus attained by very few, and there is even a tendency to confine the title of "the true philosopher" (the highest level of mankind) to "the supreme ruler," as does Alfarabi in Attainment of Happiness, pp. 43- 44, sects. 53 and 54; p. 46, sect. 57; p. 47, sect. 59; p. 49, sect. 62. 106 TahdhTb al-akhblq, p. 171.

Walzer contrasts al-Razi with the majority of the</page><page sequence="25">KRAEMER: Humanism in the Renaissance of Islam 159 the sciences, it is not because of an innate defect. They may reach intellectual equality by striving. Countering this claim, AbU Hdtim al-RdzT turns one of his oppo- nent's theories-his concept of scientific progress- against him."3 AbU Bakr al-Rdzl had professed that by means of his perfect intellect he apprehended more than the ancient philosophers, thus implying (says his rival) that he excels all of mankind, and that the truth, in fact, never exists, since whatever is believed to be so is surpassed. AbU Bakr responded that the soul of those who strive in the path of truth is purified from the turbidity of this world and released to the other world by philosophical investigation, however little he apprehends of the truth."14 In his Spiritual Medicine al-RdzT writes that man's superiority over beasts (evident in his restraining his impulses) belongs to the majority of men, even if this be the result of education (ta 'fdb) and learning (ta'lTm). There are great differences among people, however, and reaching the summit of this virtue is hardly possible for any but the excellent (or: virtuous) philosopher (al-faylasaf al-fadil). Such a man is as far superior in self-control to commoners ('awamm) as they are to beasts."15 Despite al-Rdzl's fundamental belief in human equality, he acknowledges that there is no nation of finer intellect and more evident wisdom than the Greeks. His eulogy of Hellas appears in the context of a polemic with certain people "called wits and literary gentlemen" (al-mawsamiun bil-zarf wal-adab), who extolled romantic love."6 The controversy was part of a battle of the arts: his opponents not only ascribed romantic sentiment to litterateurs, poets, chiefs, leaders and even prophets; they claimed that leadership, poetry and eloquence are the indisputable signs of perfect intelligence and wisdom, and that knowledge and wisdom consist solely of grammar, poetry, purity of language (fasaha) and eloquence (balhgha). They are unaware, says al-RdzT, that philosophers do not consider any of these subjects as wisdom, or their professors wise. The philosophers regard as wise those who know logical demonstration, mathematics, physics and metaphysics, within human capacity. Al-Razl then recounts an anecdote concerning one of "their clever fellows," and a "sheikh of ours" in Baghdad, who knew philosophy as well as grammar, lexicography and poetry. The fellow claimed that grammar, lexi- cography and poetry constitute learning, all the rest being "hot air." To the sheikh's delight, al-RdzT con- founds his rival, exposing his inability to reason logi- cally. He then explains to the reader that his object was not to condemn those concerned with grammar and linguistics ('arabiyya), but to expose those igno- ramuses who suppose that these subjects exclusively qualify a man to be called learned. Answering certain critics of his, al-Rdzi recounts his love of learning (mahabbata il-'ilm). "7 Whenever he chanced upon a book he had not read or a man he had not met, he heeded no other occupation, even to his detriment, until he mastered the book or dis- covered all that man knew. His literary production, he writes, amounted to 20,000 sheets of minute script per year. Working on his Compendium for fifteen years, he became blinded, and the muscles of his hand became paralyzed." 8 Al-Rdzl's attitude to traditional religion was inimi- cal. He denied the validity of revelation and branded faldsifa: "Like Epicurus, he does not believe that philosophy is only accessible to the select few, as Plato's aristocratic conception of philosophy and its dignity had proclaimed and as most Islamic philosophers, following Plato's footsteps, unanimously asserted"; "Islamic Philosophy," Greek into Arabic, p. 15. 113 This fascinating segment of the controversy is translated in von Grunebaum, "Islamic Civilization," Modern Islam, p. 55, note 6 (on pp. 55-56). 114 Cf. the gnostic-like myth on the descent of reason to man from the substance of God's divinity and man's return to the supernal world by means of philosophy in al-RdzT's al-Qawlfi l-nafs wal-cdlam, Opera, p. 285. 115 Kitab al-tibb al-rChdn7, text, pp. 20-21/trans., pp. 22-23. 116 Ibid., pp. 42-44/44-45. 117 Al-sTra al-falsafiyya (The Philosophic Way of Life); P.

Al-Biriin! wrote a Catalogue of the works of al-RazT; P. Kraus, Epitre de BjrhnT (Paris, 1936). The love of learning of al-BiriinT, for whom (like his paragon) scientific and scholarly achievement was a progressive process, is portrayed by F.

Like the eighteenth-century Enlightenment philosophers, he believed that religions were in mutual contradiction, retarded human pro- gress, hampered philosophy and science, and inflamed hostility and warfare."9 This enmity toward established religion distinguishes al-Rdzi and his precursors (Ibn al-Muqaffa', Abil 'Tsd b. al-Warraq, Ibn al-RawandT) from the majority of the faldsifa. Al-Razil et al. were surely heretics, and perpetuated an old and venerable tradition of polemic on behalf of "the old and true teaching" against the revealed religions. The themes of their polemical assaults are traceable to the panoply of gnostic and Manichaean strictures against monotheism, and to the philosophical contentions of defenders of paganism, such as Celsus, Porphyry, the Emperor Julian and Proclus. They were not merely rationalists, but heretics who (unlike the mainstream faldsifa) threatened the state and the social order.120 The majority of the faldsifa studiously refrained from assailing the fun- damental tenets of Islam; in fact, they defended reli- gion by lending it a philosophic rationale; for they sincerely believed that religious myths and symbols were essential for the well-being of society and the welfare of mankind (saldh al-khalq)."2' In this mode of "religious humanism" espoused by the faldsifa there was no attempt to shatter the containers of tradition. The "counter-tradition" in Islam, represented by the faldsifa, was radically other than the counter-tradition of heretics such as al-RdzT, Ibn al-Rawandi or the Ismac'il assassins. To combine the "revolutionary saints" with the philosophers of the counter-tradition (e.g., the Assassins with Alfarabi) is roughly equivalent to equating a handgrenade-tossing terrorist with a Marxist university professor.'22 By their prudent and ayribasim. Turk Tarih Kurumu Basimevi (Ankara, 1974), pp. 145-56. Al-Biruinl's statements on the pleasure and use- fulness of knowledge, particularly pleasure, should be read with an eye to the charge of Niitzlichkeit described above. Rosenthal writes: "As BIrUin tells it, the process of learning was pleasure for him. When this process was completed and pleasure thus gone, he gained the greatest possible bliss by concentrating on teaching with all his mind and soul. He was truly convinced that while human efforts were short-lived and imperfect, the pleasure of knowledge was eternal and never stopped. It is the essence of knowledge. It is true human bliss' (pp. 152-53). Consider also Alfarabi, The Philosophy of Aristotle, p. 77, Sect. 3: "Moreover, souls desire to know things that are not useful for what is neces- sary." Alfarabi perhaps alludes to Aristotle's famous dictum, "All men by nature desire to know" (Metaphysics, Book A,1, 980a20), as well as to the hadith which says that the Prophet prayed that God preserve him from knowledge which is of no use (Goldziher, Stellung, p. 6). 119 His heretical ideas were exposited in his Makhiriq al- anbiya' (Hiyal al-mutanabbiyyTn), which appears to have had impact on the notion of the De Tribus Impostoribus, a favorite theme of European rationalists, and FT naqd al- adyan, contained in Abii Hatim al-RazT's A 'lam al-nubuwwa. See P. Kraus and S. Pines, "Al-RdzT," The Encyclopaedia of Islam, First Edition, IV, pp. 1135-36. They call his attack "the most violent polemic against religion that appeared in the course of the middle ages." 120 This point of view differs from that of H. S. Nyberg, "cAmr ibn 'Ubaid et Ibn al-Rawendi, deux reprouves," in Classicisme et delin culturel dan l'histoire de l'islam (Paris, 1957), pp. 125-36, especially 133-35, who presents Ibn al- Rawandi as merely a rationalist and Aristotelian philosopher more consistent in drawing conclusions than other Mu'tazi- lites. Nyberg is followed by M. Plessner, "Heresy and Ratio- nalism in the First Centuries of Islam," in The 'Ulamd' and Problems of Religion in the Muslim World (Studies in Memory of Professor Uriel Heyd), ed. G. Baer (Jerusalem, 1971) (in Hebrew), pp. 3-10, especially 8-10, who says con- cerning Ibn al-Rawandi that "he was merely more consistent than the Mu'tazilites in employing reason for discussing theological subjects; in short, he was a rationalist, but not anti-religious." Plessner says further that al-Razl was far from being a heretic; he was simply an individualistic thinker, merely anti-establishment or anti-orthodox. But al-RazT and his precursors were anti-religious and perpetuated anti- religious motifs traceable to pagan polemics, according to which: revelation is untrue and the prophets and apostles are mere magicians (with the concomitant exaltation of reason as the common and sole guide of mankind); religion is an idiotic teaching meant for the uneducated masses; religion opposes reason and philosophic speculation, encouraging blind adherence to faith; religion contains absurd doctrines (anthropomorphism, creation, etc.); contradictions exist among the religions and within each one; and they encourage parochialism and quest for worldly power. 121 Al-Ghazali, Faysal al-tafriqa bayn al-isldm wal-zandaqa, ed. S. Dunyd (Cairo, 1961), pp. 101-102, distinguishing between the faldsifa and the zanddiqa, notes the principle of saldh al-khalq adopted by the faldsifa concerning the belief of the multitude in matters such as resurrection, God's knowledge and providence. 122 Cf. M. Halpern, "Four Contrasting Repertories of Human Relations in Islam," in Psychological Dimensions of</page><page sequence="27">KRAEMER: Humanism in the Renaissance of Islam 161 conservative behavior-their humaneness, it may be said-the faldsifa avoided arousing the apprehensions of a traditional society, thereby succeeding to preserve and transmit an alien cultural legacy within the orbit of Islam. The falasifa transcended the conventional myths of their respective communities, but they appreciated the social utility of these myths and did not preach their abandonment. The rational soul is one, embodied in different individuals. And so truth is one, reflected in different religious traditions. For the falasifa, the quality of being truly human, of living the life of reason, was inconceivable in the absence of social order. They viewed society as consisting of an en- lightened elite, nurtured on reason and the legacy of antiquity, and the mass of mankind, desperately in need of religious guidance. The revealed laws were advocated by the faldsifa because they convey a reflec- tion of the truth and persuade the unreasoning masses to act virtuously. The true philosopher does not under- mine the unwavering commitment to the moral abso- lutes that bind the social order.'23 In their attitude to the religion of the masses the falasifa were good disciples of the ancient Stoics and Platonists. In their comportment toward the masses the faldsifa thus displayed the quality of philanthropia. Love of humanity is eloquently expressed in an inspiring pas- sage in Yahyd b. 'Adi's TahdhTb al-akhlkq: It also behooves the one who loves perfection to train his soul to harbour friendship (mahabba) toward all men, and to have affection and compassion for them. For men are one tribe (qabTi), related to one another, joined together by humanity (insaniyya). And the adornment of the divine power is in all and in each and every one of them, it being the rational soul. It is by means of this soul that man becomes human. And it is the noblest of the two parts of man, which are the soul and the body. Man, in reality, is the rational soul, and it is one substance in all men. All men are really a single entity (shay' wahid) in many individuals. And since their souls are one, and love occurs by virtue of the soul, it is incumbent on all of them to harbor love and affection for one another. This is natural in men so long as the irascible soul does not guide them.... When a man restrains his irascible soul and is guided by his rational soul, all men become his brethren and friends.... For men are either virtuous or base. One should love the virtuous for their virtue and have compassion for the base on account of their baseness. And so it is meet for the lover of perfection to love all men, having pity and mercy for them, especially the king and head. For the king is not a king so long as he does not love and pity his subjects... 124 Humanity, in the sense of philanthrapia, is asso- ciated with liberality and freedom in a brief treatise Near Eastern Studies, ed. L. Carl Brown and N. Itzkowitz (Princeton, 1977), pp. 81ff., especially p. 91, and note 45. 123 The religious law rectifies youth, habituates them in desired actions and prepares their souls to receive wisdom, seek virtues and reach human happiness; Miskawayh, Tah- dhib al-akhldq, pp. 35 and 49. Alfarabi insisted that a youth who sets out to study philosophy "should be brought up according to laws and habits that resemble his innate dispo- sition. He should have sound conviction about the opinions of the religion in which he is reared, hold fast to the virtuous acts in his religion, and not forsake all or most of them. Furthermore, he should hold fast to the generally accepted virtues and not forsake the generally accepted noble acts"; Attainment of Happiness, p. 48, sect. 60. See M. Mahdi, Ibn Khaldun's Philosophy of History (Chicago, 1964), chapter 2, "Philosophy and the Law," which is the best account of the relationship of the falasifa to the society in which they lived. Note the definition of the philosophers by al-JurjanT (Ta IrTfait, p. 41)-"Those whose speech and action conform with tra- dition"-and Alfarabi's statement (Zaynan, pp. 9-10) that the philosopher must "restrain himself from [doing] what is forbidden in the community of his prophet and agree with the many in [following their] rules and habits"; (Mahdi, p. 13 1, note 2). 124 Tahdhib al-akhldq, in Rasd'il al-bulaghd', ed. M. Kurd 'AlT, third edition (Cairo, 1946), pp. 483-522, on pp. 517-18. The passage appears in a context (pp. 512-522) wherein Ibn 'AdT discusses the perfect man (al-insdn al-tdmm), also called the lover of perfection (muhibb al-kamd!). He says over and again that the most worthy of this title are kings and chiefs. "The perfect man is a chief by nature" (p. 520). The authen- ticity of the ascription of the work to Yahyd b. 'AdT is upheld by K. Samir, "Le Tahdib al-A bldq de Yahya B. 'AdT (m. 974) attribu6 a Cahiz et a Ibn al-'ArabT," Arabica, 21 (1974), pp. 111-37. See also Walzer, "On the Legacy of the Classics in the Islamic World," in Greek into Arabic, p. 33, on this passage. Walzer writes, "This is stoic and neoplatonic language in one." It is likely that the passage is also of Christian inspiration (see, for example, Lactantius, above, p. 140). The finale recalls Hellenistic treatises on kingship. See above, note 105.</page><page sequence="28">162 Journal of the American Oriental Society 104.1 (1984) on the philosopher's life by Ibn 'Adi's disciple, Abu l-Khayr al-Hasan b. Suwar.125 The true philosopher is someone who has a pure and primary love for the real essence of all things. It follows necessarily that the philosopher is not tempted by material things but is temperate ('afifIsophron) and generous; for being avaricious is to prefer money to humanity (insdniyya) and liberality (hurriyya), and the philosopher prefers nothing to humanity and liberality. The pairing of philanthropia and liberality (eleutheriotctos) appears in the pseudo-Aristotelian treatise On Virtues and Vices. 126 Love for mankind is said by Ibn 'AdI to be rooted in human nature; it is natural to man when he is guided by reason and not subject to the whims of his irascible soul. The notion that love of mankind is a natural human affection is linked by the faldsifa with the name of Aristotle. Abu I-Hasan al-'AmirT, quoting Aristotle, distinguishes between natural and unnatural affection, citing as examples of the natural variety the affection of a ruler for his subjects, parents for their children, a man and his wife, a man for his fellow citizens, and likewise love for all mankind and for animals.'27 Similarly, Miskawayh, discussing the causes of affection or friendly association (mahabba/philia), as even in strange places such as on a ship, says that the principle of all such friendly association is natural sociability (uns). This is because man is sociable (dnis) by nature, not wild (or: uncivilized [wahshfl) or ad- verse to society (nufiir).'28 Miskawayh then cites approvingly the view of Arab lexicographers that the word for man (insdn) is derived from the stem 'ns ("to be sociable").129 Miskawayh says elsewhere that human perfection (al-kamdl al-insT) is attained by means of the cooperation of all and that, since men contribute to one another's perfection, they ought to love each other, for each sees his own perfection in the other. Each is like an organ of a single body.130 Man alone, among all animals, is not self-sufficient in perfecting his essence, says Miskawayh. The saying of the sages-"man is political (madan!) by nature"- means that he needs a city wherein there are many people so that human happiness (al-sa'cda al-insl- niyya/ anthropinT eudaimonia) can be achieved. Every man, by nature and necessity, needs others, and thus requires the cordiality and company and amicable love of men, for they perfect his essence and his humanity. Therefore, no intelligent person would pre- fer isolation, and hence those who regard asceticism as a virtue, and commend retiring into caves or con- vents or wandering throughout lands, do not acquire any of the human virtues.'31 125 B.

Rackham [Cambridge, 1956]): "And the affection of parent for off- spring and of offspring for parent seems to be a natural instinct, not only in man but also in birds and most animals; as also is friendship between members of the same species; and this is especially strong in the human race; for which reason we praise those who love their fellow men (tous philanthropous). Even when travelling abroad one can observe that a natural affinity and friendship (hos oikeion ... kai philon) exist between man and man universally." This is the passage wherein Brink, "Oikeiosis and Oikeiotis: Theophrastus and Zeno on Nature in Moral Theory" (above, note 9), pp. 126 and 133, and Baldry, The Unity of Mankind in Greek Thought, pp. 90, 123 and 144, find the germ of Theophrastus's ideas on human kinship. 129 The derivation of insan from :ns is said by Lane, An Arabic-English Lexicon, I, p. 115, to be the view of the Basrians. We would rather suppose that 'ns is a denominal derivation from insan. 130 TahdhTb al-akhldq, pp. 14-15. On p. 135, he uses the image of "one person." Cf. also Tahdhlb, p. 156, where "Socrates" is quoted on the desirability to teach children about love and harmony and the general good that befalls all men through friendship and sociability, instead of the history of kings and their wars. On this passage, actually a para- phrase of Themistius, see F. Rosenthal, "On the Knowledge of Plato's Philosophy in the Islamic World," Islamic Culture, 14 (1940), pp. 403-404. 131 Ibid., p. 131. See also Alfarabi, The Attainment of Happiness, p. 23, sect. 18, where he says man is called "the social and political animal" (see note 3 ad loc. on p. 135 for</page><page sequence="29">KRAEMER: Humanism in the Renaissance of Islam 163 The notion that man is political by nature has two senses: (1) He is a sociable being and craves human friendship; (2) He needs others in order to exist. The second meaning is foremost in the following: "Man is political by nature" means that he cannot live in isolation like birds and wild animals; he needs asso- ciation and material help for his livelihood and wel- fare. This association and mutual help is urbanization (madaniyya).'32 It may be in a state of cultivation ('imdra), that is accomplished by means of many helpers and the spread of justice among them, by virtue of the power of rule (sultan), which orders their affairs, maintains their hierarchy and removes mis- fortunes from them. When this is lacking urbanization becomes desolate.'33 The notion that man is not self- sufficient but needs society is also noted by al-'Amiri in a passage which appears to be a paraphrase of Aristotle's Politics, I, 1, 1253a 26-29: "The Master of Logic [Aristotle] has said: Society is necessary for man in his life; for one (individual) is not self-sufficient unless he be a beast of prey or a divine being in living a good (faldila) life, even if he possesses all good things (al-khayrat)."134 The ideal size for human association was not fixed by the faldsifa at the level of the city-state. The polis had no special status as part of the classical heritage. Alfarabi regarded the polis as the absolutely minimal zone wherein human perfection was attainable.135 He envisioned as more ideal a human community com- prising the entire inhabited world (ma'mara/oikou- mene or a large community of many nations, ruled by a philosopher-king, i.e., on a scale beyond the actual human societies, which existed on the level of nation (umma) and city-state (madTna). Alfarabi thus differed from Aristotle by not acknowledging the polis as the ideal-sized community; and by expanding Aristotle's incidental reference to "nations" into a conception of a world state.136 In his vision of world peace in a perfect world state, Alfarabi argued that, "Beings like parallel citations of the Aristotelian dictum). The expression "social being" (animal sociale) was used by Seneca, De beneficiis, VII, i, 7, and Lactantius, Divine Institutions, VI, x, 10 (Barker, From Alexander to Constantine, p. 463 and note 1). An interesting version of Aristotle's dictum appears in al-cAmirf's al-Amad cala 1-abad, MS Servili 179/2, fol. 36b: al-insdn dTnT bil-tab c ("man is religious by nature") (if this is not a scribal error). The Aristotelian dictum appears in Politics, I, 1, 1253a9; see E. Barker, The Politics of Aristotle (New York, 1962), p. 5, who translates, "Man is by nature an animal intended to live in a polis." Cf. Ethics, I, 7, 1097b I1 ("man is by nature a political thing"); and IX, 9, 1169bl9f. "It would be a strange thing to make the happy man a solitary: no one would choose to have all the good things in the world in solitude; man is a being meant for political association and whose nature it is to live with others"; cited by Barker in note 4 ad loc. 132 In al-Hawdmil wal-shawamil, pp. 69 and 87, Miskawayh uses the word tamaddun, where it appears to mean "society." Cf. also al-Fawz al-asghar, fols. 52a-53b, especially 53b, where Miskawayh says that the cooperative community is tamaddun ("society"), whether it be in the desert (wabar), town (madar) or on a mountain top. It is possible that this is the meaning of madaniyya in our passage. 133 Ibid., pp. 250-51. In a prior passage (p. 35), Miskawayh says that those who withhold mutual help are the ascytics, who do injustice to themselves and others. They exist, he says, among the philosophers, as well as among religious sects, e.g., the Sufis. On the injustice (jawr, zulm, cudwan) of ascetics, who accept help from others without giving in return, see also al-Fawz al-asghar, fol. 54a. 134 Al-sa'dda wal-is'cd, p. 150; translated by S. Pines, "Aristotle's Politics in Arabic Philosophy," Israel Oriental Studies, V, p. 151. See also Alfarabi, Fusal muntaza'a, ed. F. M. Najjar (Beirut, 1971), p. 33, sect. 12; ed. and trans. D. M. Dunlop (Cambridge, 1961), sect. 11 (trans., pp. 32-33). Alfarabi says that the ancients named the possessor of all the virtues divine (ildhf), while his opposite was sometimes called wild beast (sabuC). Dunlop refers also (Introduction, p. 19, and note on pp. 80-81) to Ibn Bajja, TadbTr al-mutawahhid, ed. and trans. Asin Palacios (Madrid-Granada, 1946), pp. 16-17/pp. 47-49; D. M. Dunlop, "Ibn Bajjah's Tadbiru 'l-Mutawahhid (Rule of the Solitary)," JRAS, 1945, p. 72, where the same idea is expressed. 135 Pines, ibid., p. 156. See also R. Walzer, "Aspects of Islamic Political Thought," Oriens, 16(1963), p. 53, who suggests that the city-state may have become "a relic from the past," adding that "there are few autonomous indepen- dent city-states in the Hellenistic world, and next to none in the Roman Empire, nor were there ever any in the world of Islam." 136 Pines, pp. 156-57, 159. Pines refers to Politics, I, 1, 1252a5-1252b28. Aristotle mentions "nations" in 1252b20, a concept he regarded as typical of non-Greek peoples, the Greeks divided into city-states, as Pines points out. As for the source for Alfarabi's conception of a world state, Pines suggests the possibility that this passage and others were derived from a paraphrase of Book One and perhaps also Book Two of the Politics, composed in the Hellenistic or Roman period, and influenced by Stoic doctrine.

"38 The notion of a world state was known in medieval Islam on the authority of Aristotle, on the basis of a letter purported to be from the philosopher to his disciple, Alexander the Great.'39 The sentiments of this letter are an apt finale for the theme of this paper: I know that if mankind in general is destined to reach true felicity within the duration of this world, there will come about that concord [i'fildf/homonoia] and order which I shall describe. Happy is he who sees the resplendence of that day when men will agree to constitute one rule and one kingdom. They will cease from wars and strife, and devote themselves to that which promotes their welfare and the welfare of their cities and countries. They will all enjoy safety and quiet, dividing their day into parts, part for rest and welfare of the body, part for education [adab] and attention to that noble pursuit, philosophy- studying what has been achieved and seeking what has not yet been attained. I would love to remain alive and see that age-if not all, at least part of it. If, however, my old age and the length of my past life makes this impossible, I wish that my friends and brethren may see it; if they, too, will not obtain this privilege, then those who are like them and follow their ways.'40 Arabic, p. 244; also "The achievement of the falasifa and their eventual failure," Colloque sur la Sociologie Musulmane (Brussels, 1961), p. 355; "Aspects of Islamic political thought," p. 48.
