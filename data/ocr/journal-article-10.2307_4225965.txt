<plain_text><page sequence="1">JeI JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ISSUES Vol. XXII No. I March 1988 Veblen's Analysis of Social Movements: Bellamyites, Workers, and Engineers Donald R. Stabile At several key points in his career as a thinker, Thorstein Veblen con- ducted an analysis of radical social movements. His objective was to determine which of those movements would develop the capability and the motivation to replace the business-led system of economic produc- tion with a more rational system. Although this objective was often overshadowed by his concern with the functioning of the economy per se, it always played a part in his thinking. From among the groups whose activities he scrutinized, ranging from farmers and members of Coxey's army to devotees of the arts and crafts and the International Workers of the World, he earmarked, by providing an extensive anal- ysis of their activities, only three groups-Bellamyites, workers and en- gineers-as having the potential he sought. Since the Bellamyites and workers were readily linked to socialism, a movement Veblen appeared to support, while engineers had no such connection, Veblen's inclusion of engineers among the ranks of the rev- olutionaries has troubled many of his followers. Rick Tilman, for ex- ample, has argued that The Engineers and the Price System should be interpreted as an aberration, with Veblen's views on engineers to be excluded from the main corpus of his works. To be sure, Tilman is con- cerned with defending Veblen from charges of technical elitism, which can all too readily be leveled against the presentation of his ideas about engineers but which are also difficult to square with Veblen's earlier radicalism.'

Stabile Tilman is quite right to assert that Veblen was not a technical elitist. Veblen was too attuned to the dim prospects afforded society by the ruling business elite to have supported its replacement with another elite. But Tilman goes too far in believing that it is necessary, in holding this interpretation, to discard Veblen's ideas on engineers. These ideas were important to Veblen, and he did not disavow them in his later works, as will be shown below. Rather, when viewed in the context of his life's work on social movements, it will be seen that Veblen's anal- ysis of the engineers can be taken as seriously as his views on other radical social movements. To establish that context, it will be argued that Veblen's research project with respect to social movements consisted of looking for and analyzing those movements that had the potential motivation to upset the institutional structures that held the business system together. In investigating the source of that motivation, Veblen retained a Darwin- ian approach that stressed identification of the environmental condi- tions that would bring out the group's potential for radical action. Under his Darwinian approach, Veblen determined that social out- comes resulted from the multiple interplay of instincts, institutions, and technology. Since he believed that human nature was sufficiently flexible to per- mlit a variety of social outcomes, for heuristic purposes Veblen divided human nature into two instinctual clusters-workmanship and preda- tion. The degree to which human behavior inclined toward either clus- ter depended on the institutions under which humans acted. But institutions themselves came under constant pressure for modification because of the continual technological innovation being wrought by sci- ence. Caught between institutions and technology as environmental forces, human beings responded to whichever of the two exerted the most influence on them.2 When applied to social movements, Veblen's evolutionary approach involved recognition of the institutional elements that structure social stability and identification of a social group with the right set of values to solve the social problems being caused by the clash between advanc- ing technology and archaic institutions. To analyze his own society, he posited two sets of values vying for ascendancy: business values of making money and industrial values of making goods. Since Veblen felt that industrial values were derived from technology and therefore were suitable for coping with the demands of technology, his analysis of social movements looked for a group that had a reason to hold those values. At one point, when writing about industrial workers, Veblen made a strong case for "the cultural incidence of the machine process" as a way</page><page sequence="3">Veblen's Analysis of Social Movements 213 of explaining how those workers would attain the proper set of values required by modem technology, while persons involved with the mon- etary side of business would not. This strong statement on the impact of the machine has led interpreters of Veblen to infer a technological determinacy from his works as a way of distinguishing which groups would be progressive. In his writings on other social groups, however, Veblen modified his view on the impact of the machine as a force that would foster the tech- nological values he sought in those groups. In his studies of the three groups under consideration in this article, for example, Veblen made no case for Bellamyites being influenced by any form of technology, a strong case for industrial workers being under the sway of the machine process, and an indeterminate case for the source of the engineers' in- dustrial values. In his later works, Veblen moved toward a position of indeterminacy with regard to technology by blurring the distinction be- tween which groups felt the impact of technology and its values and which groups were dominated by the "imbecile institutions" of pecu- niary values. This evolution in Veblen's own approach can be seen through a sequential study of his analyses of the three groups. All three social movements were departures from-aberrations of if you will-existing social norms. That is why they attracted Veblen's attention and that is why he spent his time investigating them. The point here is that the movements themselves were aberrations, and al- though Veblen's treatment of them may reflect his personal idiosyncra- sies, he was serious about discovering what motivated them and where they might lead. The fact that they all led to a form of accommodation with the business system does not diminish the rigor of Veblen's anal- ysis. Even though he argued that technological change was the main influence in forcing institutions to be altered, his Darwinian approach also allowed for a reverse flow of influence from institutions to techno- logical values. Because Veblen's analysis permitted an indeterminate outcome in the clash between technology and institutional values, by the time he came to write about engineers as a social group his support for them was not as whole-hearted as his support had been for workers. But this change in his attitude was consistent with the earlier about-face he had done with regard to the first social group he considered-the Bellamy Nationalizationists. The Movement for Nationalization The starting point in Veblen's search for an upsetter of the status quo was in one of his earliest articles, "Some Neglected Points in the Theory of Socialism." The article is of interest for what it said about this par-</page><page sequence="4">214 Donald R. Stabile ticular "socialist" movement. It is also important because in it Veblen made a clear statement of his aim in analyzing this and other social movements. He wrote, There can still be no doubt of the presence of a chronic feeling of dissatis- faction with the working of the existing industrial system, and a growth of popular sentiment in favor of a leveling policy. The economic ground of this popular sentiment must be found, if we wish to understand the significance, for our industrial system, of the movement to which it sup- plies the motive. If its causes shall appear to be of a transient character, there is little reason to apprehend a permanent or radical change of our industrial system as the outcome of the agitation; while if this popular sentiment is found to be the outgrowth of any of the essential features of the existing social system, the chances of its ultimately working a radical change in the system will be much greater.3 As this quote indicates, not only must a movement seek to overthrow the business system, its motivation must be derived from pressures arising within the system. It is also clear from the reference to "popular sentiment" that Veblen did not view this movement as an elite group. Although he never mentioned Edward Bellamy by name, it is ob- vious that the movement inspired by his writings was the one Veblen referred to throughout the article, because it was the primary move- ment for socialism at the time he was writing (1892) and because he consistently talked about "advocates of Nationalisation," following the usage of Bellamy's followers in capitalizing the "N". After the initial successful response of his book, Looking Backward, Edward Bellamy led an active movement to nationalize industry in the United States. Under his direction, "Nationalisation Clubs" sprung up throughout the country, with 161 clubs chartered by 189 1.4 Veblen de- termined to make some sense of this flurry of activity, to see if the movement was permanent. Oddly enough, in light of Veblen's later works, he found the chief motivating force behind this early socialism to be envy and "a feeling of slighted manhood."' The gist of his argument was that even though average incomes tended to rise under competitive capitalism, all per- sons wish to emulate their betters by enhancing their own reputations. Here we have a glimmer of the argument Veblen would later make fa- mous in The Theory of the Leisure Class. But there was a difference, because at this point Veblen felt that this process might lead to social- ism, especially since the feeling derived from an unequal distribution of property, a condition that must exist as long as private property ex- isted. In a summary statement, Veblen concluded that this emulation is one of the causes, if not the chief cause, of the existing</page><page sequence="5">Veblen's Analysis of Social Movements 215 unrest and dissatisfaction with things as they are; that this unrest is insepa- rable from the existing system of industrial organization; and that the growth of popular sentiment under the influence of these conditions is necessarily adverse to the institution of private property, and therefore adverse to the existing industrial system of free competition.6 The Bellamy movement died out as quickly as it arose. Although he had little to say on the actual blueprints for society advanced by Bel- lamy, other than to indicate that they were based on a "constitutional" approach and would probably be more efficient than the present sys- tem, Veblen, as has been well-argued, might have held Bellamy's sys- tem as his ideal vision of society.7 He implicitly repudiated his specific analysis of emulation as a motivating force for socialism when, in The Theory of the Leisure Class, he argued that the role model of the wealthy, through the process of emulation, tended "to greatly stiffen the resistance of all other classes against any innovation, and to fix men's affections upon good institutions handed down from an earlier generation."8 Even at this early stage a pattern in Veblen's analysis of a social movement can be discerned. First, when a movement died out Veblen had no problem forgetting about it himself; with his Darwinian ap- proach that emphasized social outcomes as following a blind process, he retained no specific loyalty to a social movement, as Marxists hold for the working class. Second, he greatly overestimated the permanence and significance of the Bellamy movement, an overestimation that would be repeated in his analysis of workers and engineers. It is also worth noting that he had no qualms about modifying a particular ap- proach, as in this case when he turned his principle of emulation in on itself. Despite the failure of the Bellamyite movement, Veblen retained an avid interest in socialism. His analysis of Coxey's Army, for example, indicated that while the monetary prescriptions of the army were "a hallucination," the underlying sentiment of the army, with its call for governmental programs ofjob creation, represented a weakening of the institution of private property. During the 1890s Veblen published about ten reviews of books dealing with socialism, but it would be a decade before he would find another socialist movement in the United States to analyze.9 Working-Class Socialism Veblen's interest in and writings on working-class socialism date from a period when that movement showed promise of being a social</page><page sequence="6">216 Donald R. Stabile force. The Socialist Party of America was formed in 1901, and its mem- bership and electoral support showed a steady rise until the outbreak of World War I. During the 1908 elections, its presidential candidate, Eugene Debs, created quite a stir campaigning in his own chartered train, "the red special." It is no surprise that Veblen took an interest in the movement. In order to determine the motivation behind socialism as well as its extent and prospects, Veblen employed his distinction between indus- trial and pecuniary employments. Under this distinction, Veblen ar- gued that persons most involved with the business aspects of making money would retain a belief in the sanctity of private property and cap- italism, while those most intimately concerned with industrial produc- tion would be likely to display an interest in socialism. It is easy to see that he wanted to present an analysis that would help socialists figure out what groups they should target in their campaigns. At the time, socialists were divided into a camp of left-wing purists who would stick with workers and a right-wing sect that thought adherents to socialism could be found among the middle class. Veblen's analysis sided with the left wing. But his conclusion that adherents to socialism could be found among the industrial workforce, blue-collar workers in Tilman's typology, has two problems.'0 Veblen never clearly delineated a "blue-collar workforce," and his use of the machine process as the source for the industrial values held by the workforce does not mesh well with current historiography. Two quotes will suffice to demonstrate the vagueness of Veblen's concept of the workforce. In a very broad statement, he included, as the workforce, "the civil engineer, the mechanical engineer, the navi- gator, the mining expert, the industrial chemist and mineralogist, the electrician ... the inventor who devises the process and ... the mech- anician who puts the inventions into place and oversees their work- ing. ""I This is clearly not a definition of blue collar workers. Indeed, in a more succinct statement, referring to who held industrial values, he named "the highly trained technological experts and engineers as well as the highly skilled mechanics." He also noted that these values may be held "perhaps more decisively among those who stand in an engi- neering or supervisory relation to the process."'2 From among this broad spectrum of occupations, Veblen indicated that the most likely adherents to socialism would be found among "the intelligent body of workmen in the highly organized and specialized industries," whom he also referred to as "the better classes of operatives in the mechanical employments."'3 At this point, and especially in light of Veblen's later work, one might ask, What about those engineers Veb-</page><page sequence="7">Veblen's Analysis of Social Movements 217 len had just included as holding industrial values? The response would be that Veblen could see that engineers were not interested in socialism at the time and that workers were, but there was little basis in his logic for excluding them. A possible exclusionary rule can be deduced from Veblen's main source for the motivation behind the technological values of the work- force, for he based his argument on the "cultural incidence of the ma- chine process," wherein work within modem technology imposed a skeptical, matter-of-fact outlook on workers. He wrote, "The machine throws out anthropomorphic habits of thought.... The machine pro- cess rests on knowledge of impersonal, material cause and effect, not on the dexterity, diligence or personal force of the workman, still less on the habits and propensities of the workman's superiors."'4 Appar- ently workers came into more direct contact with machines, which would explain why they were more likely than engineers to become so- cialist in their thinking. Veblen's whole argument now seems dubious. In the last two decades several writers have identified the introduction of the machine process as leading to a process of "deskilling," which is then seen as a source of labor unrest.'5 To some extent Veblen recognized elements of this process. He thought of his "industrial workforce" as displacing "handi- craftsmen of the older culture."'6 But he did not consider what hap- pened when persons with craft skills themselves confront the machine process. This form of confrontation is what deskilling was all about, however, and it seems to have been an important factor in working-class social- ism. In his study of socialism among trade unionists, John Laslett found the destruction of skills had much to do with making skilled workers more radical. The skilled members of the International Asso- ciation of Machinists, for example, became socialist because of "the steady erosion of the machinist's traditional skill, undermining the in- dependence and status of the artisan and reducing him, within the space of a generation, to little better than a factory hand." Laslett found this same source of discontent among shoemakers. He also noted that the strongest sources of socialism at the time were among the mine workers and garment workers, mainly as a reaction to poor working condi- tions. '7 Based on Laslett's accounting of the motives behind working class socialism, Veblen's hopes for the cultural incidence of the machine pro- cess were overstated at best. So, too, were his expectations for so- cialism. From 1900 to 1912, votes for Debs in presidential elections ranged from 96,000 to 902,000, and membership in the Socialist Party</page><page sequence="8">218 Donald R. Stabile went from 16,000 to 118,000. These figures are impressive until it is recalled that the industrial workforce (excluding agricultural and man- agerial workers) totalled about nineteen million in 1910. Veblen's anal- ysis might have reduced the potential proponents of socialism to a much smaller core (if only he had been more precise about which work- ers in which industries he was talking about) but much of the support for socialism came from outside the industrial workforce, among farm- ers and the middle class. As with the Bellamyites, Veblen greatly over- estimated the strength of working-class socialism as well as its motivation. If the worker interest came more from their dissatisfaction with deskilling or poor working conditions, Veblen would have been on surer ground sticking with his principle of emulation and "slighted manhood." But a return to this principle would have created more difficulties for Veblen. As already noted, he had argued that all classes, including workers, emulated the leisure class. Workers who lost the status ac- corded to them as skilled craftsmen might indeed have grown restless. They might even have displayed their dissatisfaction by voting for so- cialist candidates as a form of protest. But in the long run, they had to come to rest, and it is doubtful it would have been with a movement of such limited success as socialism had in the United States. Rather, they might have sought to have their loss in status as craftsmen com- pensated for with more pay, in order to at least put on a respectable front in meeting the standards of consumption set by leisure-class val- ues. To accomplish this rising standard of living, they would have re- mained loyal to their union if they had one, or formed one if they did not. Veblen understood the importance of the growth in union member- ship of this period, but ascribed it as well to the influence of the machine process. For him, the union movement represented a compro- mise between what the business system would permit and what the in- dustrial system required. He believed, for example, that collective bargaining retained the business principle of haggling over the price of labor, but recognized that production techniques and industrial values required that wages be set on an industry-wide basis. Because such col- lective agreements were "extra-legal" in common and property law, Veblen expected that they could not be realized within the institutional setting of the business system, which would cause unionism to drift over into socialist activities. 8 Later he despaired over unions satisfying themselves with pecuniary gains. He never saw, as happened in the 1930s, that unions could improve their legal status within the system. Instead, Veblen painted an optimistic picture for socialism at the</page><page sequence="9">Veblen's Analysis of Social Movements 219 time. Businesses needed machines to prosper. As they introduced ma- chines, they added to the force that was inciting socialism. It almost seemed that he believed, as many Marxists did, that socialism was in- evitable. But Veblen recognized countering forces. Schools and the press still inculcated their participants and readers with pecuniary and leisure class values. More important, patriotism, with its infusion of military values, provided a more important "hope of a corrective for 'social unrest'.""9 In his later writings, when his interest in socialism was dampened by its failures, Veblen would pay more attention to these antidotes to the influence of the machine process. Veblen's dampened interest in working-class socialism is clear; the term itself was given scant mention in the remainder of his writings on conditions in the United States. Whether he modified his analytical tools of "industrial and pecuniary" employments and "the cultural in- cidence of the machine process" is a more complex issue. In his analysis of German socialism, for example, Veblen was mainly concerned with the issue of Marxian theory and how the German so- cialists adjusted it to bring it into conformity with the Darwinian out- look as well as with German politics. He observed that the German working class was infected with the notion of imperialism (just as he had argued that the working class in the United States could be influ- enced by patriotism), so its socialism and that of the German Socialist Party were becoming conservative. He did not apply any of the previ- ous analysis to the German working class.20 His next major statement concerning the machine process and the impact of occupations on outlook retained a qualified adherence to his principles. The qualifications were threefold and related to the problem that the industrial workforce did not seem to have responded as pre- dicted. In particular, trade unions were settling for monetary gains as their goal. First, Veblen observed that the mental outlook that the machine pro- cess required might not be compatible with human nature. As he put it, "But such an animus as best comports with the logic of the machine process does not, it appears, for good or ill, best comport with the na- tive strain of human nature in those peoples that are subject to its dis- cipline." He later added, "The limit of tolerance native to the race, physically and spiritually, is short of the unmitigated materialism and unremitting mechanical routine to which the machine technology in- continently drives."'21 Now this presented a problem in the analysis, but Veblen never be- lieved that human nature was rigidly fixed; he always maintained that the combination of a variety of instincts in behavior left some latitude</page><page sequence="10">220 Donald R. Stabile for change in human nature. So he immediately noted that a second qualification might be that the machine process had not had sufficient time to work out its effects.22 But given enough time there remained a third difficulty. The machine process still carried with it elements of craftsmanship-specifically, ac- tion by contact. As Veblen saw it, "If, as seems likely, this principle of action by contact owes its origin to habits induced by manipulation, it will be seen to be of an anthropomorphic derivation."23 Even though this anthropomorphism derived from an earlier time, because elements of it remained within the machine process, the ability of the machine process to wipe it out, alluded to above, had limits. The point of all this was that the impact of the machine process worked incompletely. As Veblen admitted, his analysis left it "doubtful whether anything more than an imperfect approximation to the logic of the machine process can be achieved, through any length of training, by the peoples among whom the greatest advance in that direction has already been made."24 Moreover, the field was not entirely left free to the values inculcated by the machine process. Veblen had earlier argued that even the indus- trial workforce could be affected by business values of making money, leisure class values of emulation, and patriotism, all of which countered the influence of the machine process. In a chapter where he spent twenty pages attesting to the incomplete influence of the machine pro- cess, Veblen provided one paragraph detailing how the institutional impact of it might be to induce radicalism among workers (the only reference to any form of socialism was a footnote mentioning syndical- ism); he then devoted three pages to detailing how business principles were spreading among workers, especially under the rubric of business unionism as set forth by Veblen's student and colleague, Robert F. Hoxie.25 The ability of a ruling elite to offset the incomplete influence of the machine process was a problem Veblen would spend more time on during the rest of his life. The contrast of two possibilities came through clearly in his comparison of England and Germany. Among the English-speaking nations, the growth of free institutions and insubordination, such as it is, has appar- ently come partly of the positive discipline in mechanistic habits of thought given by the modem industrial arts.... It is an outcome of the working of the modem industrial system ... inseparable from it in the long run because it is made of the same substance as this technological system. It is this "long run" that is still wanting in the German case, and it must of necessity be all the longer of a run for the care taken by the Imperial</page><page sequence="11">Veblen 's Analysis of Social Movements 221 State to prevent such an outcome.... The feudalistic spirit of the popu- lation has yet suffered little if any abatement from their brief experience as a modem industrial community.26 Germany remained Imperial because its leaders had been able to use militarism as an antidote to the cultural incidence of the machine pro- cess. At this point, then, it would appear that Veblen, although he had lost interest in working-class socialism as a vehicle for social change, still employed the machine process and industrial and pecuniary employ- ments as tools in analyzing social institutions and still had hopes for the eventual triumph of technological values among the English- speaking nations. The Engineers Earlier it was noted that while Veblen excluded engineers from a- mong those members of the industrial workforce who were potential upsetters of the status quo, there was nothing in his logic that required him to do so; engineers, too, fell under the impact of the machine pro- cess and had a heightened sense of industrial values. But they were not then interested in social change. When, in the period during and after World War I, engineers did become advocates of social change, Veblen was willing to pay them heed.27 It is ironic that the engineers' experi- ences with industrial planning during the war led them to this advo- cacy, even as the patriotic fervor set loose by the war was used, as Veblen had predicted, to kill off what remained of the socialist party. The analysis Veblen presented in The Engineers and the Price System was originally published as a series in the reform-minded journal, the Dial, over a period of several months.28 And one can see that Veblen's hopes for the engineers waned during the course of those articles. But he started out with hopes. As he put it, "Right lately these technologists have begun to become uneasily 'class conscious' and to reflect that they together constitute the indispensible General Staff of the industrial sys- tem."29 How did he know? This statement was not something Veblen conjured up from his own mind. He was responding to activities of engineers themselves. Perhaps he had heard about a panel discussion at a meeting of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, where one engineer asked, "Why not have a General Industrial Staff as a continuing body. . . to plan a na- tional industrial campaign." It is well known that Veblen was collabo- rating with a group called the Technical Alliance at this time, and statements like that just given were common in the engineering litera-</page><page sequence="12">222 Donald R. Stabile ture.30 The similarity between this statement and Veblen's cited just above it seems too close to have been coincidental. When it came time to analyze the underlying motivation of the en- gineers, Veblen gave little elaboration. The machine process hardly en- ters in the argument, although some mention is made of the influence of occupation. For Veblen argued that because engineers of the newer generation were not in business for themselves, but were hired workers, their scientific training exerted a more powerful influence on them than did their economic interest in attaining higher pay.31 Here again, Veb- len's analysis seems way off, since present-day investigators have found that engineers were discontented with the small role they were playing in society; they were, to use Veblen's term, suffering from "a feeling of slighted manhood."32 Moreover, the movement itself never stirred the spirits of the rank and file of engineers. Veblen was not unaware of these problems. His past experience with workers and their penchant for settling their dissatisfaction with higher pay carried over into his work on engineers. He even noted that like workers, engineers were "content with the 'full dinner-pail' " and added that they were "pretty well commercialized."33 With their acceptance of pecuniary values, engineers were not likely to give full reign to their industrial values. At best they would remain restless under the sway of two contradictory value systems. Still, Veblen gave the engineers some important advice about how to make their program of advocacy more successful. To succeed, their program must have "the tolerant consent of the population backed by the aggressive support of the trained workforce." He even insisted that engineers take measures "such as will bring the underlying population to a reasonable understanding of what it is all about."34 Given these statements it is difficult to construe Veblen as a technical elitist pushing for a coup d'etat by engineers. Instead, he is best seen as an analyst of another social movement, which he thought might have a slim chance at upsetting the established order of things. If anything, he was warning the engineers themselves that they would get nowhere with their plans as long as they remained technical elitists (which many of them were), aloof from blue-collar workers and the underlying pop- ulation. In his efforts to rescue Veblen from charges of being a technical elit- ist, Tilman would eliminate Veblen's analysis of the engineers from the corpus of his works. But such is not necessary, nor is it fruitful. Rather, Veblen's work on the engineers remains useful as one of the first studies of what has come to be known these days as "The New Class," and</page><page sequence="13">Veblen's Analysis of Social Movements 223 Veblen provided a level of analysis that has not always been reached by current writers on technocracy. Moreover, Veblen did not com- pletely give up on engineers as a social movement. With his next and last work, Absentee Ownership, Veblen presented a dour view of a society ruled by business principles. The emphasis in this book shifted from that of his earlier writings, dealing more exten- sively, as it does, with the attitudes of businessmen and, probably be- cause of the activities of the Non-Partisan League, with farmers. There was no hope for radical social change coming from these groups, and the industrial workforce, or at least its blue-collar members, were seen as being drawn more and more under the influence of pecuniary val- ues.35 He held out a small glimmer of hope, however, and it was with "something new under the sun," the engineer. This statement formed part of a summary of his earlier views. He wrote, "The later advances in the industrial arts have taken such a turn as to throw the technicians more and more into a position of immediate and unremitting respon- sibility in all this technical organisation of work." Moreover, their work life enforced a skepticism, albeit a constructive one. He continued, con- sistently with all his work on the impact of the machine process, "Nei- ther the industrial system nor the brotherhood of technicians, in whose habits of thought this industrial system is contained, have yet reached the unmitigated state of mechanisation and brute logic which this de- scription of it would imply. But it is headed that way and is moving at a constantly accelerating rate." Given a long enough exposure to the influence of the machine process, engineers might yet rebel. How important was the engineer? For Veblen at this stage he "has grown to be one of the major institutions in modern life." Indeed, he concluded, "The technicians and the business men are the outstanding factors in the case, the conjugate foci of the economic system; and the orbit of the economic world now swings about these two foci, which are beginning to draw apart."36 To be sure, Veblen had doubts that en- gineers would transcend their pecuniary values and become pure ad- vocates of industrial values. By now, Veblen was fairly skeptical that any social movement could be so pure. Even so, his analysis of engi- neers replicated his earlier searches for persons with the right values to run the industrial system. He was also one of the first social theorists to raise the crucial ques- tion of the importance of engineering in economic development. This question will be of importance for the rest of this century, but it contin- ues to be ignored by economists, as Walt Rostow has recently pointed</page><page sequence="14">224 Donald R. Stabile out.37 The study of the social and economic impact of engineers may well have formed an entire research project for Veblen, had he contin- ued to work. Conclusion Because he was one of the first intellectuals to write about engineers, Veblen has been viewed as being their chief supporter and therefore a party to their technical elitism. But since he recommended that they attain the support of workers and the general population, it would be difficult to make this charge stick. Had he been pressed to give a more detailed set of plans to the engineers, Veblen probably would have re- minded them to retain a "constitutional" approach, such as he had found among the Bellamyites. Since Veblen continued to write about engineers, it is also necessary to conclude that they were not an aberra- tion from his work. Rather, although his support for them was not whole-hearted, his analysis of them was consistent with his views on other radical social movements. Each of the radical social movements Veblen analyzed displayed a restlessness with its members' status in the business system. This was what attracted Veblen's attention and directed his analysis to their ac- tivities. But their dissatisfaction never translated into an effective drive to replace the business system. They came to rest by somehow adjust- ing to its pecuniary values. This process of adjustment makes Veblen's seeming advocacy of any of them so far-fetched today. But he always dropped the group when its radical potential vanished. In the case of the engineers, he did not completely give up on them, as his last written words would attest, but in time he most likely would have found them wanting as well, especially after the debacle of Howard Scott and the "Technocracy Movement" of the 1 930s. With his complete understanding of the rigidity of the established institutional structure as well as his appreciation for the ruling elite's capacity to educate the public, Veblen established stiff requirements in finding any social group that could develop the technological habit of mind needed to overthrow the established order. To use his own term, Veblen had the defect of his virtue. He did so well in elaborating how leisure class values, pecuniary thinking, and nationalism presented a formidable edifice against change, it is no wonder he encountered diffi- culties in finding social movements that had a chance at altering soci- ety. Indeed, it is suprising that he found as many as he did.</page><page sequence="15">Veblen's Analysis of Social Movements 225 Notes 1.
