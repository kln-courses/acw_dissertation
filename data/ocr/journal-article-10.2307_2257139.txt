In a tropical country such as Malaya, where the natural vegetation is so rich and so many of the plants are vast and unreachable, it is extremely difficult to know how to begin the teaching of botany. There are no suitable text-books, and the immigrant botanist, schooled elsewhere, must spend years before he can attempt a general contribution. The immediate flora, round house, village and fields, consists largely of introduced weeds, ornamentals, and cultivated plants. They serve elementary botany, but they are not satisfactory to those who would promote the study and care of the native forest flora. Now, in this well- produced book of modest size, Prof. Holttum gives an introduction to Malayan, not just tropical, plant life which crystallizes much of his botanical interests derived from over thirty years in the country. It is intended for the teacher, who knows a little botany, as well as for the young student and the resident amateur, and it certainly provides a very readable account for those 'in other parts of the world who wish to know something about the biology of Malayan plants'. The first and last chapters deal with the forest-that wealth of plants that no one has comprehended. Between them come chapters on the larger monocotyledons, grasses, orchids, ferns, climbers, parasites, saprophytes, water-plants, ant-plants and insectivorous plants, as well as more formal topics of fruits, seeds and vegetative propagation. Each chapter has lively drawings by two local artists, a Malay and a Chinese. At the outset, Holttum plunges into the problem of rhythmic development of leaves and flowers, where the overall effect is a timeless greenness; it is a subject on which he has spent much research. At the end he brings the parts together in peeps at the forest. It is hardly necessary to say that everyone taking up botany, or country rambles, in Malaya will study this book. It will help, too, to dispel the popular fallacy that tropical forest is a horrid tangle to be bull-dozed. There are five criticisms that I would make. First, it is a pity that there are no references to the works of others; the book is a stepping stone, and there are others. Secondly, many of the drawings, which are neat and accurate, require annotation; as botanical objects they are presented rather for admiration and wonder than as guides to the inquisitive. Thirdly, there is a tendency to anthropomorphism, as in the phrase 'they will grow happily in the open' (p. 237). Fourthly, in the effort to keep the text simple, there is a danger of losing that precision so essential to science. Climbing plants are as precise as clockwork. It is not merely that Uncaria has precise hooks, but that these hooks are exactly arranged on the side- branches only. Or, again, it is not merely that the radicle of the rubber seedling produces side-roots, but that these arise in so definite a manner that the inquisitive must become more curious. The story of the Pigeon Orchid could have been a delightful example of scientific method. And, lastly, I am at a loss to know how the reader will discover for himself Plectocomia, Scaphochlamys, Balanophora, Roucheria or, even, an Annonaceous climber. The book requires yet other books to introduce the chapters. And so we come back to the metaphor, that we are casting stepping stones. Criticism is inevitable where there is so little on which to build. This book should stimulate local interest, which is on the brink, and it should help those in other countries with the same problem to face. E. J. H. CORNER</page></plain_text>
