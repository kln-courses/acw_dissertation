While some sources claim a political landscape dominated by a few large-scale, highly centralized polities almost wholly supported througjh foreign trade, others suggest the presence of more heterogeneous and politically segmented configurations of varying scale and complexity and with eclectic economic bases. These disparate narratives are evaluated in terms of methodological biases, their cultural context, and the historical circumstances of their production. KEY WORDS: Philippines; chiefdoms; economy; political structure. INTRODUCTION Prestate complex societies, or what cultural evolutionary models often refer to as "chiefdoms," have been the subject of intensive historical, eth nographic, and archaeological study in Polynesia, Western Asia, Mesoamerica, Central America, South America, North America, and Europe (e.g., Carneiro, 1981; Earle, 1987,1991,1997; Renfrew and Shen nan, 1982; Wright, 1984). In some cases, the written record is extensive but Eurocentric due to the lack of indigenous writing or other non-European texts (e.g., Polynesia, Central America, Europe outside of the Roman sphere). In other cases, the chiefdoms were subsumed by later evolving states and are only known through archaeological evidence (e.g., pre lDepartment of History, 304 KMB, Brigham Young University, Provo, Utah 84602. 291 1092-7697/98/120(W)291$15.(WO O 1998 Plenum Publishing Corporation</page><page sequence="2">292 Junker Sumerian Near Eastern chiefdoms and prepharonic Egyptian chiefdoms, early Mesomerican chiefdoms, the Mississippian chiefdoms of North Amer ica). In the latter, archaeological patterns are frequently interpreted with reference to historically known prestate complex societies in markedly dif ferent historical, ecological and cultural contexts [e.g., Peebles and Kus' (1977) analysis of Mississippian chiefdoms through analogy with contact period Hawaii]. The reliance on cross-cultural comparison in cultural evo lutionary models has tended to obscure significant variability in how these nonegalitarian, but prestate societies were structured and transformed over time. This "overhomogenization" has long been a critique of cultural evo lutionary categories (e.g., Feinman and Neitzel, 1984; Yoffee, 1993). Lack ing historical sources, however, the alternatives to cross-cultural comparisons are to extract structure and meaning from the archaeological materials alone (e.g., Tilley, 1994; Hodder, 1982) or to invoke more gen eralizable models of how rising elites gain and perpetuate political control such as Marxist theory (e.g., Gilman, 1981) or "human agency" models (e.g., Spencer, 1993). In this paper, we show that current models of sociopolitical structure and political economy in "chiefdoms," whether cultural evolutionary in bent or of some alternative form, are a poor fit in many ways for prestate com plex societies in island Southeast Asia. At the time of European contact in the early sixteen century, most of the major islands of the Philippines had a complex political landscape comprised of chiefdoms of varying scale and complexity in coastal river valleys, interacting through trade and con flict with each other and with smaller-scale tribal agriculturalist societies and mobile foragers in the island interiors. While Philippine societies were regionally integrated polities centered around hereditary elite, they were characterized by a highly volatile "segmentary" structure shaped by ephem eral alliance-structured coalitions, a political form generally not considered in classic cultural evolutionary models of chiefdoms. Ecological and geo graphic conditions specific to island Southeast Asia, differing patterns of population growth relative to resources, alliance-based systems of social connectedness and non unilineal descent reckoning, and a long-term em phasis on maritime interaction are just some of the factors suggested by historical and archaeological investigation as relevant to the unique struc ture and evolutionary trajectories of Philippine chiefdoms. Unusual in anthropological studies of prestate societies is the plethora of multicultural texts (Chinese, Arab, and indigenous Southeast Asian) al lowing us to trace the historical evolution of these societies for more than a millennia prior to European contact and documentation. The long-term maritime trading focus of island Southeast Asian political economies re sulted in continuous and intense contact with various literate foreigners</page><page sequence="3">Contact Period Philippine Chiefdoms 293 throughout the first and second millennia A.D. Unlike comparable tropical regions of complex society development such as Polynesia, the archaeologi cal database is also surprisingly rich, since island Southeast Asian craftsmen produced durable bronze, iron, and gold work, ceramics, and other goods resistant to decay in the humid tropics (although largely lacking the stone monumental constructions of Polynesia). In addition, European colonial in terests often did not penetrate onto more remote islands or into distant island interiors until well into the late nineteenth and early twentieth cen turies, leaving pockets of traditional chiefdom organization for ethno graphic study. Anthropologists can therefore use multicultural texts of varying perspective, indigenous oral traditions, abundant archaeological evi dence, and even ethnographic writings to analyze the ways in which the structures and evolutionary trajectories of island Southeast Asian complex societies over the last two millennia parallel and, most importantly, diverge from that of complex societies elsewhere in the world. In this essay, we focus specifically on the melding of history and ar chaeology to study the development of chiefdoms in the Philippine archi pelago between the early first millennium A.D. and European contact. Because of the richness of both historical and archaeological databases, the Philippine case demonstrates the methodological difficulties of recon ciling contradictory evidence on indigenous sociopolitical organization and economy through careful consideration of multiple source biases. For ex ample, the puzzling lack of regional political integration emphasized by the sixteenth-century Spaniards is at considerable odds with Chinese descrip tions of powerful Philippine chiefs making lavishly equipped official visits to Sung and Ming Dynasty courts and with archaeological evidence for mul titiered regional settlement hierarchies. These dissonant views can be rec onciled if we carefully examine the specific cultural and historical contexts of each source, noting how worldviews and life experiences of various writ ers, limitations on the recovery of archaeological data, and even our own biases as anthropologists might color their inferred meaning. Thus, the rich ness of the historical database for first- and second-millennium A.D. island Southeast Asian polities allows us to use cross-cultural analysis, not to per petuate a homogenized cultural evolutionary category (i.e., the "chiefdom") in which to pigeonhole these hierarchical but nonstate societies, but as a means of demonstrating how and why Southeast Asian polities differ in important ways from complex societies elsewhere in the world. lb illustrate how historical sources and archaeological data can be in tegrated in the study of first millennium AD. and later Philippine chief doms, I focus on areas of inquiry for which we have a large body of historical and archaeological materials: the structure of indigenous political systems and the dynamics of chiefly political economies. We preface the</page><page sequence="4">294 Junker discussion of these specific issues with a general critique of historical and archaeological evidence used to infer how these societies emerged, func tioned, and transformed over more than a millennia prior to European contact. We emphasize the distinct cultural contexts and historical condi tions under which various written texts and material remains were created and how dissonant views of past can be integrated through critical analysis. A CRITIQUE OF SOURCES FOR RECONSTRUCTING CONTACT PERIOD PHILIPPINE CHIEFDOMS Indigenous Philippine and Malay Texts and Oral Traditions Early Spanish writings on the Philippines indicate that indigenous scripts were used in many regions of the Philippines at the time of contact [Chirino, 1903-1909 (1604), pp. 242-243; Morga, 1903-1909 (1609), pp. 115-117; Santa Ines, 1990 (1676), p. 68]. Ethnographic researches amongst the Ikgbanua of Palawan and Mangyan of northern Mindoro (Gardner, 1943) report early twentieth-century use of indigenous scripts inscribed on bamboo which appear to have recorded traditional myths, poetry, and songs. While a number of the early Spanish relaciones provide renderings of Filipino syllabaries in these indigenous scripts [e.g., Chirino, 1903-1909 (1604)], there are no known surviving prehispanic bamboo texts that can be analyzed contextually and in terms of content (Scott, 1984, p. 53; Wade, 1993, p. 48). A single poorly provenienced earthenware vessel with inscrip tions from Calatagan has not been deciphered (Francisco, 1973, pp. 82-83). Due to our present lack of information on the social contexts of writing and on the content of written indigenous texts, this source has thus far been little used in reconstructing aspects of prehispanic culture. Early Span ish writers and anthropologists working with less acculturated "remnant" chiefdoms in the archipelago, however, have collected a number of impor tant oral accounts of historical personages and events that are richly de tailed on the nature of traditional political authority and its ideological underpinnings [e.g., Alcina, 1960 (1688a); Manuel, 1958; Saleeby, 1905]. Saleeby (1905), in particular, has compiled oral chiefly genealogies (tarsilas) for the Sulu and Magindanao chiefdoms of Mindanao that go back several centuries and are a critical source in studying chiefly succession, marriage alliances, and strategies of political legitimation. One area of historical analysis that has been little pursued are the abundant Malay texts from historically known early to midsecond-millen nium AD. Southeast Asian trading kingdoms which had trade connections with Philippine polities, including Majapahit (Java), Brunei (Borneo), and</page><page sequence="5">Contact Period Philippine Chiefdoms 295 the kingdoms of the Malacca Straits. Some of what we know about the fourteenth- to sixteenth-century polities of Manila, Sulu, and Magindanao comes from Bornean accounts (Gullick, 1965; Scott, 1989) which refer to Brunei elite intermarriages with Filipino elites, maritime battles with Phil ippine polities, and the Filipino chiefs' place in international trade systems. Most of these Malay texts have been analyzed by historians from the po litical perspective of the Bornean writers, who have a strong interest in emphasizing their political ascendancy and cultural dominance over rival Philippine polities of similar scale. Therefore, we have interpretations by some historians which incorrectly place Philippine polities like Manila and Sulu under direct Brunei political hegemony in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries (e.g., Saunders, 1994), a reconstructed political landscape that is contradicted by contemporaneous European and Chinese texts, by Sulu oral genealogies, and by archaeological evidence. Similarly, fourteenth-century Javanese texts relating to the powerful Majapahit maritime trading kingdom suggest political and religious sway over southern Philippine trade partners like Magindanao and Sulu (Hall, 1992, pp. 218-219). Oral genealogies (tarsilas) of the Magindanao polity explicitly claim foreign origins, but the connection is with the Malacca Straits polity of Johor rather than Java (Scott, 1994, p. 176; see Saleeby, 1905). Both of these claims for a dominant foreign role in the rise of these Philippine polities are inconsistent with Chinese tributary records and ar chaeological evidence demonstrating the presence of one or more chiefly polities at Magindanao at a significantly earlier date (see below). In inter preting these texts, we must recognize that foreign Southeast Asian polities advanced their political agendas through exaggerated claims of political in fluence in the archipelago, while the Philippine polities themselves often alleged exotic origins as a strategy of chiefly legitimation. Early Chinese Records Chinese documents referring to the Philippines go back to the tenth century A.D., including imperial trade records recording "tributary mis sions" by named Philippine polities to the Chinese court and eyewitness travel accounts written by Chinese who accompanied trade voyages to the Philippines. "THbutary missions" to the Chinese court were undertaken by Philippine chiefs ruling such polities as Ma-i, P'u-tuan, Sulu, and Magin danao attempting to win favored trade status over their maritime trading rivals. These tenth- to fifteenth-century "tributary records" provide signifi cant information on Chinese conceptions of rulership in Philippine chie fdoms, the changing political landscape of the Philippines during this</page><page sequence="6">296 Junker period, specific export commodities offered by Philippine polities, and their specific luxury good preferences (see Scott, 1984; Vfeng, 1959). In addition to these official Chinese trade records, several extensive writings by Chinese voyagers to the Philippines or Chinese historians who compiled the eyewitness accounts of others exist from the early second mil lennium A.D. One of the most important of these Chinese works is Chao Ju-kua's (1225) Chu Fan Chih or "An Account of the Various Barbarians" (A.D. 1225; in Hirth and Rockhill, 1911). The text offers considerable eth nographic detail on the organization of coastal maritime trading ports in the Philippines, on the range of trade commodities, how local chiefs ad ministered foreign trade, and on various aspects of the local economy re lated to trade. A second document with considerable ethnographic content is the fourteenth-century eyewitness account of the Chinese trader/adven turer Wang Th-yuan known as the Too I Chih Lueh or "Summary Notices of the Barbarians of the Isles" (A.D. 1349; in Zaide, 1990, Vol. 1, pp. 9-13). Wang Ik-yuan recorded his impressions of political leaders, indigenous trad ing systems, social status-marking behaviors, and warfare in lowland popu lations in the vicinity of Manila, in parts of southwestern Mindanao, and in the Sulu Sea region. The official Chinese dynastic histories (i.e., the Sung Annals, Ming Annals, and Ching Annals) also make occasional and less de tailed references to Philippine polities active in the South China Sea luxury goods trade [see Chen (1966), Scott (1984), Wang (1959), and Wu (1959) for English or modern Chinese translations and commentary]. While these early Chinese records are a rich source of information on the political history and economy of these early second-millennium A.D. Philippine polities, it is important to note that traditional Chinese cosmol ogy viewed the empire as the center of the universe and all non-Chinese peoples as "barbarians" in a fitting "tributary" relationship to the Chinese empire (Andaya, 1992, pp. 346-347; see Allard, this issue). Descriptions of Chinese court ceremonies granting varying tributary status to Southeast Asian petitioners suggest that the Chinese had considerable difficulty in sorting out which Southeast Asian rulers actually held the significant re gional political sway and controlled the vast volumes of trade exports they invariably claimed for themselves in their visits to the Chinese court. This confusion is evidenced in the Sung regime's dilemma about whether to grant the comparatively peripheral and small-scale early eleventh-century Filipino polity of P'u-tuan (at Butuan in Mindanao) tributary status com mensurate with Champa, the powerful and immensely scaled Vietnamese state which had a longstanding trading relationship with the Ting and Sung empires (Hall, 1992, pp. 253-260). It was not until the thirteenth century that Chinese administrators actually made diplomatic voyages to these dis tant polities on the far edges of their known southern island world to con</page><page sequence="7">Contact Period Philippine Chiefdoms 297 firm their political prominence and their claimed access to desired products such as spices, gold, and pearls (Hall, 1985, p. 196). Therefore, Chinese references to Philippine political organization must be carefully analyzed in terms of larger-scale political configurations in Southeast Asia at the time the records were written. We should examine Chinese relationships with Southeast Asian polities outside the Philippine archipelago to which specific Philippine polities are being compared. Furthermore, these formal tributary records and Chinese eyewitness accounts of Filipino culture and society must be analyzed in the context of sporadic, but long-term contact between all East Asian complex societies over the last several millennia which tended to dampen extreme cultural divergence. Through many centuries of maritime contact, the Chinese had a long-term familiarity with pan-Southeast Asian (and in some cases, pan East Asian) cultural practices like ritual pig feasting, human sacrifice, slave raiding, cognatic descent, polygamy, elaborate court ceremonialism as a powerful form of political integration, and the etiquette of elite patronage and servility, behaviors that must have seemed more markedly alien to European writers. Many of these components of Southeast Asian politics may have been too mundane and familiar to the Chinese to warrant ex tensive discussion, in contrast with European texts. Another possibility is that the reported Chinese aversion to miscegenation and religious syncre tism as they moved into Southeast Asia (Chen, 1966) discouraged partici pation or even overt interest in indigenous marriage customs, religious rituals, and the material prestations that accompanied them. Thus, the dearth of commentary by early Chinese writers on competitive feasting, rit ual sacrifice, and slave-raiding does not necessarily mean that these were unimportant aspects of Philippine chiefly political economies prior to the sixteenth century. Early European Accounts Spanish documents comprise the largest corpus of written sources for inferring aspects of contact period Philippine societies. Sixteenth- and early seventeenth-century Spanish sources include at least a dozen book-length texts, including numerous relaciones formally commissioned by the Spanish monarch. In using early Spanish sources to reconstruct aspects of contact period indigenous cultures, it is important to understand the historical and cultural contexts in which these documents were written. Many of the lengthy late sixteenth-century documents were compiled by colonial admin istrators in the newly established Spanish colony as part of the Relaciones Geogrdficas, a series of reports on annexed lands in the New World and</page><page sequence="8">298 Junker Asia commanded by the Spanish monarch Phillip II [e.g., Loarca, 1903 1909 (1582); Morga, 1903-1909 (1609); Sande, 1903-1909 (1577)]. Colonial administrators in the Philippines, Mexico, Peru, and elsewhere were pro vided with a standardized list of 50 queries broad enough to apply to di verse cultures and designed to elicit basic information relevant to Spanish administration of the conquered lands [see Cline (1972) for a discussion of the history of the Relaciones Geogrdficas and a translation of the stand ardized questionnaire]. Not surprisingly, these Spanish writings focused on geography, climate, exploitable natural resources, indigenous political units and towns, indigenous religions, indigenous tributary systems, and military technologies but said little about social organization, household subsistence and craft production, local trade systems, and other less immediate con cerns. Aspects of indigenous culture were presented in terms which made clear how Spanish rule might serve as a counterpoint or countermeasure to local institutions. In contrast, texts and dictionaries by Christian mis sionaries [e.g., Chirino, 1903-09 [1604]; Colin, 1903-09 [1660]; Plasencia, 1903-09 [1589)] emphasized the translation of Spanish notions such as pa trocinar ("patronage"), tributo ("tribute"), and sacrificio ("sacrifice") into indigenous comprehensions through semantic analysis of indigenous lan guages, concepts and behaviors, as part of their evangelizing effort (Cush ner, 1971). In addition to these book-length Spanish manuscripts, thousands of shorter sixteenth- and seventeenth-century correspondences by European participants in the first exploratory voyages to the Philippines, by early co lonial administrators, and by early Jesuit and Franciscan missionaries are stored in historical archives in Manila (primarily the National Archives of the Philippines), in Spain (primarily in the Seville archives), and in Mexico City. In addition to colonial correspondence, there are a number of early "dictionaries" compiled by Spanish clergy or administrators in the National Archives of the Philippines in Manila which provide insights into indige nous cultural concepts, as well as Spanish biases in interpreting the linguis tic expression of indigenous ideas [e.g., San Buenaventura, 1613; Sanchez, 1617). While most of these primary Spanish sources remain untranslated and unstudied, a remarkable project commissioned by the U.S. colonial administration at the turn of the century resulted in the compilation (in both Spanish and English) of more than 3000 documents from the Seville archives in a massive 55-volume work entitled The Philippines, 1493-1898 (Blair and Robertson, 1903-1909). More recently, Philippine historian Gre gorio Zaide has posthumously published a 12-volume series (Zaide, 1990) providing alternative translations of some of the major relaciones in Blair and Robertson (1903-1909), his own comments on content and derivation, and some significant texts which were omitted from the tatter's work.</page><page sequence="9">Contact Period Philippine Chiefdonu 299 Historical research using Spanish documents to reconstruct aspects of contact period Philippine societies is remarkably undeveloped given the ex tensive corpus of materials. The historian William Henry Scott stands alone in his prolific writings devoted to constructing a sweeping and panregional model of the sociopolitical organization, technology, economy, and cosmol ogy of sixteenth-century Philippine complex societies (e.g., Scott, 1980,1982, 1984, 1989,1994). While Scott's publications contribute significant descrip tive detail and analytical insights, he approaches the issue of how contact period societies were organized from the perspective of an areally focused historian using the sixteenth-century contact as a baseline to understand later transformations of Philippine society under Spanish rule. Thus, there is little integration with broader historical and anthropological interpreta tions of the structure and emergence of maritime trading polities in South east Asia and elsewhere in the world. Beyond Scott's broader historical analyses, ethnohistorical research has been concentrated in a few regions of the Philippines where historians and anthropologists are beginning to de velop a more detailed picture of precolonial polities. Most notable is the work done on the fourteenth- to nineteenth-century Magindanao, Sulu, Ma ranao, and other Islamic sultanates of the southern Philippines (e.g., Ileto, 1971; Kiefer, 1972; Majul, 1973; Saleeby 1905; Mrren, 1985). Archaeological Evidence Due to an emphasis on cultural historical reconstruction, as well as pessimism about the probability of recovering well-preserved habitation fea tures in acidic tropical soils, much of the archaeological research on this period has involved decontextualized analysis of intact porcelains, elaborate earthenware, and metal goods derived from cemeteries and burial sites (e.g., Beyer, 1947; Locsin and Locsin, 1967; Solheim, 1964). There have been relatively few archaeological projects aimed explicitly at issues of com plex society formation in the Philippines or reconstructing aspects of con tact period sociopolitical structures, economy, and ideology (Bacus, 1995; Dizon, 1987; Hutterer and Macdonald, 1982; Junker, 1990; Nishimura, 1992; Pferalta and Salazar, 1974; Ronquillo, 1989; Solheim, 1982). Further more, most archaeological research has focused on single sites, rather than the regional settlement pattern studies critical to understanding how these prehispanic chiefdoms evolved and functioned on a regional scale. The archaeological phases of relevance to complex society development in the Philippines include what is widely known as the Philippine "Iron Age" or "Metal Age" (ca. 500 B.C.-A.D. 1000), the Early Porcelain Period (the Sung through Early Ming Dynasties, or late tenth century to late fourteenth</page><page sequence="10">300 Junker century A.D.), and the Late Porcelain Period (the Late Ming to Early Qing Dynasties, or late fourteenth century to late sixteenth century A.D.) (Jocano, 1975; Solheim, 1982). The beginnings of variability in mortuary treatment that may be status-related, along with some settlement evidence for site hi erarchies and "centers," mark the late first millennium B.C. to early first millennium A.D. as the period of initial complex society emergence (Bacus, 1995; Dizon, 1987; Junker, 1994a, 1998; Tfenazas, 1974). More complex burial patterns, three-tiered settlement hierarchies, and evidence for more special ized and centralized production systems are archaeologically recorded in some regions of the Philippines after AD. 1000, suggesting the growth of paramount chiefdoms of considerable scale and complexity, particularly after the fourteenth century (Fox, 1959; Hutterer, 1977; Junker, 1994a, b, 1998; Nishimura, 1992; Pferalta and Salazar, 1974). The early to midsecond-millen nium A.D. maritime trading ports at Butuan (the historically known P'u-tuan polity), Manila, Cebu, Job (the historically known Sulu polity), and Tknjay have received the most extensive archaeological investigation (Burton, 1977; Hutterer, 1973; Junker 1993a; Nishimura, 1992; Peralta and Salazar, 1974; Spoehr, 1973). Systematic regional archaeological survey in the hinterland areas around these chiefly centers has been carried out only for Tknjay (Hut terer and Macdonald, 1982; Junker, 1990,1994b) and for a few other regions of probable complex society development (Bacus, 1995; Dizon and Santiago, 1994; Solheim et aL, 1979; Higgle and Hutterer, 1972), Regional-scale settlement pattern studies at Tknjay have traced the de velopment of political hierarchies over the millennium prior to European contact, demonstrating that the political evolution of Philippine chiefdoms little known through historical sources can be documented in archaeological terms (Junker, 1990,1994b). Excavations in pile house residential zones at the chiefly centers of Cebu and Tknjay have produced evidence for social status differences between households, reflected in varying house size, ac cess to foreign porcelains and other prestige goods, and dietary differences (Gunn, 1997; Hutterer, 1973; Junker, 1993a, 1994; Nishimura, 1992). Ar chaeological investigations at these coastal maritime trading centers and in their hinterlands have also added to our understanding of aspects of chiefly political economies in the first and second millennia A.D. Areas of inves tigation have included agricultural intensification (Gunn, 1997), the growth of local systems of pottery and metal production (Dizon 1987,1996; Junker, 1994a; Nishimura 1992), riverine exchange between coastal and upland populations (Hutterer, 1974; Junker, 1996), the regional circulation of pres tige goods (Bacus, 1995; Junker, 1994b), ritual feasting (Junker et aL, 1994; Mudar, 1997), and interpolity maritime raiding (Junker, 1997). A significant limitation of the current archaeological evidence is that so few historic pe riod polities have been investigated in depth, and there is a tendency to</page><page sequence="11">Contact Period Philippine Chiefdoms 301 generalize patterns found at extensively studied sites like Cebu and Tknjay to Philippine chiefdoms as a whole. However, the historical record suggests considerable diversity in the scale, complexity, economic focus, and evolu tionary trajectories of Philippine chiefdoms, variability that requires de tailed regional archaeological as well as historical analysis. Integrating Historical, Ethnographic, and Archaeological Sources Historical, anthropological, and archaeological techniques of analysis all have specific methodological and interpretive biases that can be more adequately assessed when compared to alternative ways of "knowing" the past. In turn, this integrated approach creates the type of multiple dimen sions and scales of analysis that invites inclusion of Southeast Asia in broadly comparative studies of how and why complex societies emerge and evolve. Thus far, few researchers have evaluated mechanisms and processes of sociopolitical evolution in Southeast Asia against patterns of complex society development in other regions of the world (e.g., Bronson, 1978; Coe, 1961; Higham, 1989; Wheatley, 1983; Winzeler, 1981). The relative paucity of anthropologically oriented archaeological research in Southeast Asia is most vividly reflected in the absence of Southeast Asian chiefdoms and kingdoms from most general anthropological syntheses of work on complex society formation (e.g., Earle, 1987; Hannery, 1972; Service, 1975; but see Earle, 1997; Flannery, 1995). POLITICS AND POLITICAL ECONOMY IN THE PREHISPANIC PHILIPPINES One of the most basic areas of investigation where we see dissonant accounts from historical texts, ethnographic observations, and archaeologi cal evidence is in the nature of prehispanic political structures and political economy. We turn to a brief discussion of these aspects of contact period chiefdoms as a means of exemplifying the importance of using multiple sources and carefully assessing their biases in reconstructing complex so cieties bridging prehistory and history. Chinese Images of Philippine Political Structure: The Powerftil THbutary Polity Much of our early imagery of Philippine political structure comes from tenth-century and later Chinese tributary trade records, describing elabo</page><page sequence="12">302 Junker rately equipped maritime and overland voyages by Philippine rulers to the Chinese court (Scott, 1989). lb the Chinese, the formalized tributary trade was a long-term strategy for controlling the flow of foreign goods in and out of its imperial borders, for culling out the most advantageous trade partners, and for perpetuating the emperors' view of China as the center of the universe to which all other polities were naturally subservient. For Southeast Asian polities, formal tributary status ceremonially bestowed by the Chinese court resulted in coveted favored trade status at Chinese ports, regular visits by Chinese merchants into a ruler's home port, and possession of imperial regalia that enhanced the "tributary" ruler's status vis-k-vis maritime trade rivals (Andaya and Andaya, 1982, pp. 23-24; Wolters, 1971, pp. 39-48). Historical studies of the frequency and volume of these tribu tary trade missions from Southeast Asian polities indicate that a larger number of polities participated, that a higher frequency of voyages occurred by individual polities, and that the accompanying entourages and export cargos were more elaborate during periods of increased political fragmen tation and interpolity trade competition (Hall, 1985, pp. 78-79; Smith, 1979, pp. 445-451). "Private," unsanctioned commerce occurred with regularity at Philippine ports not recognized in the tributary trade, resulting in their inclusion in some general Chinese cultural geographies of the archipelago. For their own political and economic reasons, however, the tenth-sixteenth century Chinese emphasized the "tributary" polities in their writings, often giving an impression of greater polity scale, complexity, and regional inte gration than is supported by the archaeological evidence. For example, in two peak periods of tributary missions out of the ar chipelago?the late tenth to early eleventh centuries and the late fourteenth to early fifteenth centuries (Fig. 1)?the Chinese vision of Philippine politi cal landscapes is one dominated by just a few large-scale polities with pow erful and wealthy rulers who controlled vast riches in forest products and raw materials. During the early peak of tributary mission activity, P'u-tuan (probably at Butuan on northern Mindanao) and Ma4 (probably on north ern Mindoro) were recorded as extensive Philippine "kingdoms" surrounded by "barbarian" peoples, with P'u-tuan considered (but ultimately rejected) for tributary status commensurate with the extensive Vietnamese state of Champa. Yet archaeological evidence for extensive coastal settlement in this period and for access to large volumes of Sung Period porcelains are re corded for many regions outside these Chinese identified centers (Fig. 2). Similarly, Chinese records for the late fourteenth- to early fifteenth-century tributary trade peak emphasize Manila (under modern Manila), Sulu (on Jolo Island in the Sulu Sea), and Magindanao (at Cotabato on Mindanao Island) as large, centralized polities surrounded by warlike, chaotic societies lacking the elements of "civilized" society (Scott, 1989).

As noted above, historians working in other regions of island Southeast Asia have pointed out that it is during the periods of greatest political frag mentation and rivalry between multiple, similar-sized centers that we see an upsurge in tributary missions attempting to gain a monopoly on Chinese patronage (Hall, 1985, p. 78). We also see an increase in other types of competitive interactions between polities, such as coastal raiding and elabo rate ceremonialism. Once the Chinese formally recognized one polity or a few polities as favored trade partners and they began to expand through control of foreign wealth, the advantaged polities abruptly ceased the ex orbitantly expensive tributary missions since they were no longer necessary to establish trade precedence. Consistent with this view, archaeological evi dence suggests that Fu-tuan (Butuan) and Sulu actually hit their political peak and height as foreign trade powers in the centuries after these com petitive tributary trade missions ceased. The archaeological evidence also suggests that numerous unnamed but nonetheless powerful regional polities never invested in tributary missions as a competitive strategy but, instead, focused on accruing wealth and power through militarism, expanded local production, and perhaps using "tributary" polities as trade intermediaries. We should also reemphasize the point made earlier?the Chinese were largely informed about the nature of Philippine polities from the elaborate court processions of richly dressed chiefs and their entourages who entered the Chinese capital. They had little or no direct knowledge of how these chiefs lived in their homelands to help them determine whether a Butuan chief was truly the political equivalent of a Champa king. Spanish Views of Philippine Political Structure: Chaotic Kingdoms and Powerless Chiefs While Chinese sources often inflated the scale and complexity of Phil ippine chiefdoms, contact period Spanish accounts almost discount any cen tralized political authority. After their conquests in Mesoamerica and South America, where vast empires could be secured by the strategic kidnap of godlike kings, the Spaniards were unprepared for the difficulties of securing widely scattered islands controlled by a dizzying array of continually battling chiefs who seemed to have no permanent political hierarchies and spoke mutually unintelligible languages.

The relationship of these burial sites and isolated finds to dis tinct chiefly polities is unknown.</page><page sequence="17">Contact Period Philippine Chiefdoms 307 tiple competing chiefs with power bases that were not clearly defined is emphasized in a number of early Spanish accounts [e.g., Alcina, 1960 (1668a), p. 61; Boxer manuscript, 1590, p. 225; Colin, 1903-1909 (1660), p. 82]. Polities of varying scale and hierarchical complexity are suggested by widely differing estimates of the size of population units under chiefly control, ranging from fewer than 30 households to chiefly domains in the thousands [Anonymous, 1572, pp. 96-99, 108; Loarca, 1903-1909 (1582), pp. 32-187]. That there was some degree of hierarchical ranking of political author ity, and that some of the smaller-scale political entities recorded by the Spaniards were lower-level units integrated into a larger political system, is suggested by the Spanish references to los principaks ("paramount chiefs") in contrast to simple headmen or village chiefs [Loarca, 1903-1909 (1582), pp. 175-177; Legaspi, 1990 (1565), pp. 204, 212]. These paramount chiefs were recognized by the Spanish as enjoying considerably greater prestige and material accoutrements of chieftainship, as well as wielding significantly greater authority at the regional level [e.g., Alcina, 1960 (1668a), p. 61; Legaspi, 1903-1909 (1565), pp. 208-209]. At the time of European contact, there is no question that the militarily powerful Manila chief, Raja Suleyman, and the Cebu ruler, Datu Hwnabon, were paramount rulers of at least three-tiered political hierarchies, with local chiefs (known as datus) under their loose hegemony (Anonymous, 1572, pp. 99-103; Pi gafetta, 1521, pp. 54-65). Archaeological settlement pattern studies at Tkn jay support the idea that "complex chiefdoms" [defined by Johnson and Earle (1987) as chiefdoms with two tiers of administrative hierarchy above the village level] were present in the Philippines by the fifteenth century and probably before. At Tknjay, a three-tiered settlement hierarchy emerges just prior to the fifteenth century, dominated by the larger coastal center of Tknjay where the paramount chief presumably resided (Junker, 1990, 1994b). While the early Spanish chroniclers noted the presence of "para mount" chiefs, they wrote of their continual frustration over the weak co ercive power of these rulers and the independence of local rule. Individual local chiefs frequently acted independently of higher political leaders in external political and economic interactions, while at the same time explic itly recognizing the regional sovereignty of the latter. Sixteenth-century Spaniards who attempted to colonize Manila, Cebu, and polities along the northern Mindanao coast were puzzled by their inability to convert "blood alliances" and tributary relations established with regional paramounts into sovereignty over local headmen nominally under their control (Anonymous, 1572, pp. 102-103, 106; Pigafetta, 1521, pp. 103-121). Historical analyses of the seventeenth- to nineteenth-century Philippine polity of Sulu (Kiefer,</page><page sequence="18">308 Junker 1972) and anthropological work on Southeast Asian polities outside the Philippines (Geertz, 1973, 1980; Tkmbiah, 1976; Winzeler, 1981) suggest that what the Spaniards perceived as very unstable political hierarchies in stead reflected a characteristically Southeast Asian form of political organi zation. Variously referred to as "segmentary polities," "galactic polities," or "theater states," Southeast Asian complex societies were typically de centralized, had weakly integrated political hierarchies, and were particu larly vulnerable to short-term cycles of alternating coalescence and disintegration. Political authority traditionally relied, not on control over fixed territorial bases or well-defined unilineal descent groups, but on cul tivating ties of personal loyalty and expanding one's power base through frequent and elaborate gift-giving and ceremonialism. Both anthropologists and historians have pointed to geographic fragmentation, considerable mi croenvironmental diversity, low population densities relative to land, and an absence of territorially based unilineal descent groups as significant fac tors in the formation of segmentary political structures in Southeast Asia [e.g., Geertz, 1973, pp. 331-338; Reid, 1992, pp. 460-463; Winzeler, 1981, p. 462). Sociopolitical Evolution and Transformations in Political Economy In these societies, where the growth of personal alliance networks rather than territorial conquest was key to expanding political power, the circulation of prestige goods to allies and subordinates was particularly es sential to political coalition-building. In many complex societies, prestige goods serve as bankable stores of wealth which can be used to bind chiefs more closely with other elites and to attract a large network of clients by selectively fimneling them down the political hierarchy (Earle, 1997, pp. 73-74; Johnson and Earle, 1987, p. 208). In the Philippines and elsewhere in island Southeast Asia, the relative ease of maritime transport, the het erogeneous distribution of resources, and the scarcity of labor for producing local status goods favored a reliance on foreign trade for prestige good wealth (Hall, 1992, pp. 185-192; Reid, 1993, pp. 1-10). Strategic disburse ments of these prestige markers to subordinates not only expanded a chief's political power base, but also enhanced his competitive advantage in foreign trade by expanding the inflow of subsistence surplus and exchangeable goods for foreign export. Ethnohistorical analysis indicates that Philippine chiefs and other elites circulated trade obtained prestige goods in restricted social and ritual con texts which maximized their value as political currency. The early second</page><page sequence="19">Contact Pferiod Philippine Chiefdoms 309 millennium A.D. Chinese accounts of Filipino elite status good exchanges underscore the narrow Chinese focus on trade-related activities. The only reported social context of "gift" exchange between chiefs occurred as a part of pretrade ritual prestations, in which Filipino chiefs expected par ticularly fine porcelains, silk parasols, and other luxury goods to be pre sented by their foreign trade partners (whether Chinese, Siamese, Malay, or Filipino) prior to commencing larger-scale trade transactions [e.g., Scott, 1989). Some historians might interpret this lack of Chinese reference to prestige goods exchanges in other contexts [e.g., marriage negotiations, competitive ritual feasting) as reflecting either Chinese ignorance of Phil ippine customs or a late (post-fifteenth century) development of a "prestige goods economy" based on wealth circulation. As noted earlier, it is more likely that Chinese observers maintained their "cultural distance" with Fili pinos by not immersing themselves in socially intimate activities like ritual feasting and intermarriage. Even if these activities were quite familiar to them, writing knowledgeably about such facets of Filipino life might have conveyed a shameful intimacy that they wished to avoid. In contrast, sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Spanish sources and more recent ethnographic accounts of extant chiefdoms report extensively on the distribution of prestige goods (particularly exotic items) in marriage negotiations and in ritual feasting exchanges to cement political alliances. Chinese porcelains and silks, locally manufactured gold ornaments, and captured slaves were essential elements of bridewealth payments necessary to obtain high-status and politically well-connected wives [e.g., Alcina, 1960 (1688b), p. 188; Dasmarinas, 1958 (1590), pp. 410-411; Santa Ines, 1990 (1676), pp. 89-90]. Chiefs were almost invariably polygamous, and they strategically contracted marriages with the sisters and daughters of poten tial elite allies, subordinate chiefs, and even influential "commoners" to broaden their sphere of political influence [e.g., Legaspi, 1990 (1569), p. 42; also see Saleeby, 1905, p. 60]. Elite-sponsored competitive feasting events were another important social context for the display and exchange of foreign prestige goods such as porcelains. These ritualized feasts were associated with life-crisis and caiendrical events [e.g., death, illness, warfare, chiefly succession, and sig nificant points in the agricultural cycle) and usually (but not exclusively) sponsored by chiefs [e.g., Alcina, 1960 (1688b), pp. 129-130, 133-137; Loarca, 1903-1909 (1582), p. 93; see also Biernatzki, 1985; and Junker et aly 1994]. These ritual feasts, attended by allied chiefs and subordinates in the sponsoring chiefs clientage network, negotiated social status relations in the community through sacrificial rites, ceremonial consumption, and socially defining prestations. An elaborate porcelain assemblage was nec essary for food display in the lavish feast, and foreign porcelains were one</page><page sequence="20">310 Junker of several types of status goods (also including gold and fancy textiles) which were exchanged between the attending elites. Early Spanish and Chinese accounts, and more recent ethnographic work on chiefdoms persisting into the twentieth century, confirm that foreign prestige goods (as well as some locally manufactured luxury goods) were concentrated in the households of sociopolitical elites who controlled these exchange contexts [Cole, 1913, pp. 66-67; Ueto, 1971, pp. 37-38; Morga, 1903-1909 (1609), p. 295; Pigafetta, 1521, pp. 49-50,58-59; Scott, 1989, pp. 68-70]. Archaeological investigations of household wealth differentials and status-related variation in burials from the early first millennium to the mid second millennium A.D., however, reveal important changes in sociopolitical organization and chiefly political economies that are not apparent from his torical sources. We already noted that three-tiered settlement hierarchies are present in the T&amp;njay Region and probably at Cebu by at least the fif teenth-sixteenth centuries, if not earlier. Archaeological analyses of house hold wealth differentials at Cebu and Tknjay (as measured in densities of foreign porcelain, elaborate earthenware, metal goods, glass beads, and other presumed "prestige goods") show that household status display be comes more finely graded and continuously varied by the fifteenth-sixteenth centuries (Junker, 1993a, 1998; Nishimura, 1992). Similarly, while burial pro grams in first-millennium A.D. to early second-millennium A.D. cemeteries generally exhibit a simple dichotomy between wealthy "elites" and poor "nonelites" [e.g., Dizon, 1996; Tfcnazas, 1974), fifteenth- to sixteenth-century cemeteries suggest a wider range of statuses in their burial modes (e.g., Fox, 1959; see Junker, 1998). This finding is consistent with contact-period Euro pean descriptions and early ethnographic accounts of highly stratified socie ties in many regions of the Philippines in which at least four distinct "classes" were recognized?chiefs (datus), nobility (thnawa or maharlika), commoners (pripun), and slaves?each with unique modes of dress, speech, and pre scribed behavior (Scott, 1980). Chinese trade records suggest that foreign trade wealth becomes an increasingly important element of chiefly political economies in the Phil ippines after the fourteenth century (Fox, 1967; Hutterer, 1977). The writ ten documentation for an upsurge in foreign trade in the few centuries before European contact is supported by archaeological evidence from the Philippines: the quantities of foreign porcelains in burials and settlements increases at least fivefold from the Early Ming to the Late Ming period (Junker, 1994b). In the fifteenth-sixteenth centuries, foreign porcelains be came more widely dispersed to even "nonelite" households at excavated settlements like Cebu and Iknjay (Junker, 1998; Nishimura, 1992), presum ably as a function of expanding political coalition building. Analysis of elev enth- to sixteenth-century burial sites in the Philippines (e.g., Fox, 1959;</page><page sequence="21">Contact Period Philippine Chiefdoms 311 Fox and Legaspi, 1977) shows a similar pattern of intensified reliance on foreign status symbols, and their increasingly widespread distribution by coastal chiefs to allies and subordinates of varying rank by the fifteenth sixteenth centuries [see Junker, (1998) for a summary]. There are few re gional-scale archaeological investigations of the distribution of foreign prestige goods out of Philippine coastal trading centers. Archaeological set tlement studies in the region surrounding the coastal port of Thnjay, how ever, indicate a massively increased upriver flow of foreign prestige goods at the fifteenth- to sixteenth-century height of foreign trade (see Junker, 1990, 1994b, 1996). Archaeological evidence suggests that the Cebu and T&amp;njay chiefdoms, as well as historically better-known chiefdoms like Sulu and Manila, change dramatically in scale and complexity with their expand ing focus on foreign prestige goods trade in the two centuries just prior to European contact (Junker, 1994b; Nishimura, 1992). Internal processes of political growth may have led to a greater demand for foreign trade wealth, and at the same time, foreign trade wealth offered enhanced opportunities for political coalition-building and further expansion of the political system (Hutterer, 1977; Junker, 1994b). Along with expanded foreign trade, archaeological evidence reveals profound changes in other aspects of Philippine chiefly political economies after the fourteenth century. Archaeological evidence attests to agricultural intensification and new strategies of chiefly resource mobilization. A limited number of paleoethnobotanical studies in the regions surrounding histori cally known chiefly centers indicate expanded land clearance for agriculture in the centuries just prior to European contact (Gunn, 1997; Nishimura, 1992), but there is no material or textual evidence for widespread invest ment in large-scale irrigation systems or land terracing in the prehispanic period (Scott, 1994). This emphasis on forest colonization for expanded chiefly surplus rather than capital and labor investments in existing agri cultural lands is consistent with the remarkably low prehispanic population levels estimated from historical records and die consequent high value of labor. Archaeological investigations also document the increased flow of both household resources (marine products, earthenware pottery, animals) and valuables (metal goods, porcelains) between coastal and interior popu lations after the fourteenth century (Junker, 1994b, 1996). The archaeologi cal evidence suggests that, in many polities, political expansion and a growing emphasis on foreign trade were supported by expanded tributary and trade networks moving exportable products to chiefly centers. Internal systems of craft production also appear to have evolved with the expanded scale of many midsecond-millennium A.D. Philippine chie fdoms (Junker, 1994a). Highly standardized designs on widely distributed decorated earthenware dated to the Philippine "Iron Age" (ca. 500 B.C.</page><page sequence="22">312 Junker A.D. 1000) suggests that "status" earthenware may have been produced by a small number of highly specialized artisans prior to the period of Chinese porcelain trade (Bacus, 1995; Hutterer, 1977), Iron production may have also involved manufacture by specialists at a relatively early date (Dizon, 1987). It is not until the fifteenth-sixteenth centuries, however, that we see clear archaeological evidence for prestige good production areas spatially associated with elite habitation zones at chiefly centers (Junker, 1998; Nishimura, 1992). Historical records show that, certainly by the sixteenth century, goldsmiths, iron metallurgists, and other prestige goods artisans served as what Brumfiel and Earle (1987) refer to as "attached specialists" to chiefs at Job (Sulu polity), Cotabato (Magindanao polity), Manila, Cebu and elsewhere. Standardization studies of domestic earthenware in the Bais-Tknjay Region, however, suggest that expanding efficiencies of scale may have concentrated potters manufacturing even mundane vessels at chiefly centers in the fifteenth-sixteenth centuries, introducing a form of "independent specialization" distinct from traditional dispersed household production (Junker, 1993b). Zooarchaeological research on fauna from prehispanic settlement con texts as early as the eleventh century show the kind of differential house hold access to domestic pig and water buffalo, as well as differential body part selection, consistent with ritual feasting activity (Junker et aly 1994; Mudar, 1997). Both zooarchaeological analyses and archaeological studies of porcelain serving assemblages, however, suggest that the historically re ported "feasts of merit" critical to social competition and political coali tion-building became more widespread and elaborate in Spanish contact period chiefdoms (Junker, 1998). Fifteenth- and sixteenth-century house hold deposits at Iknjay and other sites yielded significantly higher densities of butchered water buffalo and pig than earlier phases. Furthermore, these historically known "feasting" animals are considerably more likely to be found in "nonelite" habitation zones in this period, suggesting wider social participation in ritual feasting activities. Archaeologically recorded trans formations in foreign porcelain assemblages, from diverse forms prior to the fifteenth century to a more narrow range of "serving" vessels (primarily plates and shallow bowls) by the Late Ming Period (Fox, 1964; Junker, 1998; Nishimura, 1992), may reflect the expanding role of competitive feast ing in chiefly politics and status competition. Both historical and archaeological evidence suggest that political com petition through maritime raiding also increases in the few centuries prior to Spanish contact. Ethnohistorical analyses indicate that, because of rela tively low population densities relative to land, warfare in Philippine chie fdoms was rarely aimed at territorial conquest but, instead, on augmenting the resources and labor necessary for expanding chiefly political economies</page><page sequence="23">Contact Period Philippine Chiefdoms 313 (Junker, 1997). Maritime raiding provided captured slaves for local labor forces, disrupted the trade routes of maritime trading rivals, and occasion ally yielded sacrificial victims for status-enhancing chiefly ritual. An ex panded scale and intensity of interpolity warfare beginning in the late fourteenth or early fifteenth century is historically recorded in the initial construction of large-scale fortifications at large coastal towns, the adoption of foreign military technologies (e.g., Chinese iron cannons and swords, Japanese bronze armor and swords), and the emergence of a professional "warrior" class (Scott, 1994). Archaeological evidence supports the histori cal data for expanded warfare, including the proliferation of defensive stockades or hilltop coral-block citadels associated with coastal settlements, increased iron weapons production, increased numbers of violent deaths in cemeteries, and the appearance of standardized "warrior" emblems in buri als (Dizon, 1987; Dizon and Santiago, 1994; Junker, 1997). In sum, the historical and archaeological evidence suggests that the emergence of larger-scale Philippine chiefdoms with more complex so ciopolitical hierarchies in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries was accom panied by growth and transformation in many aspects of chiefly political economies. These changes included expanding foreign prestige goods trade, increased circulation of exotic wealth in social prestations, agricultural in tensification, more specialized craft production, broader social participation in competitive feasting, and increasing militarism aimed at slave capture and control of trade. These trends in sociopolitical and economic develop ment are summarized in Fig. 4. Many of these evolutionary trends are not apparent from historical records, since tenth- to fifteenth-century Chinese sources and later European writings interpret Philippine political structures and chiefly economies through distinct cultural filters. While archaeological evidence has its own biases of preservation and interpretation, regional set tlement pattern studies, mortuary analyses of prehispanic burial popula tions, large-scale excavations of coastal chiefly centers, and detailed archaeological studies of ceramics, metals, and subsistence goods have sug gested some long-term trajectories of change in Philippine chiefdoms over the last two millennia. CONCLUSIONS Ethnohistorical analysis and archaeology have long been integrated as complementary methodologies for reconstructing historic and protohistoric period complex societies in the Americas, western Asia, Oceania, Africa, and Europe. Limited work has occurred, however, on historic-period mari time trading kingdoms and chiefdoms of island Southeast Asia which com</page><page sequence="24">3</page><page sequence="25">Contact Period Philippine Chiefdoms 315 bines historical and archaeological approaches. Because historical sources date back to the late first millennium AJD. and derive from a wide range of distinct cultural contexts (indigenous Malay texts, Chinese trade records and histories, and European accounts), we have multiple perspectives with which to piece together aspects of indigenous sociopolitical organization, political economy, and ideology. Each source has its unique historical cir cumstances of recording and cultural biases which influenced the content and perceived meaning of observations of island Southeast Asian politics and culture. Detailed analyses of historical and cultural contexts of texts make it dearer why political structures and relationships in historic period Philippine polities can be alternatively viewed by the Chinese as well-or dered and strongly centralized, by the Spaniards as chaotic and unstruc tured, and by the Malay writers as fluid and tied to nebulous notions of kingly charisma. In matters of political economy, Chinese writers paint a picture of kingdoms and chiefdoms almost wholly dependent on maritime trade, while local writings and oral traditions and early European texts em phasize the indigenous production of wealth and its circulation through in ternal trade, bridewealth, and ritual feasting. Archaeology plays a key role in revealing many "hidden" aspects of political, social and economic structure in contact period Philippine polities, as well as providing the evolutionary dynamism necessary to investigate how and why these structures emerged. For example, the rapidity with which these "decentralized" and unstable polities cycled through regional power shifts is most clearly shown through archaeological settlement pattern stud ies, while an overall evolutionary trajectory toward larger and more hier archically complex polities is also materially demonstrated. Archaeological studies are also key in showing a chronological association between devel oping paramount chieftaincies and intensified foreign trade, agricultural ex pansion, escalating militarism, increasingly centralized craft production systems, and expanded ritual feasting in Philippine chiefdoms in the late fourteenth through midsixteenth centuries A.D. One of the grave limita tions of the present archaeological evidence, however, is that we have sig nificant archaeological documentation for only a handful of the many dozens of polities mentioned in historical texts. The tendency has been to extrapolate archaeological patterns found at such places as Manila, Calata gan, Cebu, Tknjay, and Butuan to the archipelago as a whole, when his torical documents clearly emphasize the diversity in scale, complexity, ecological setting, economic orientation, and evolutionary trajectories of these ethnically and linguistically distinct island polities. Detailed regional archaeological studies of specific island polities, in combination with re gionally focused ethnohistorical analyses (e.g., Keesing, 1962; Scott, 1994),</page><page sequence="26">316 Junker are necessary to move beyond the gross generalities presented in Fig. 4 toward a more complex model of political evolution in the archipelago.
