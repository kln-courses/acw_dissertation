<plain_text><page sequence="1">CHARLOTTE PERRIAND HER FIRST DECADE AS A DESIGNER Mary McLeod</page><page sequence="2">In 1929 Leon Deshairs, the librarian of the Musee des Arts Decoratifs, made the following list of the most influential French designers: 1900-1910 Leon Jallot, Maurice Dufrene 1910-1914 Francis Jourdain, Ruhlmann, S?e et Mare vers 1919 Pierre Chareau, Rene Prou les tresjeunes Djo Bourjeois, K. Kohlmann, Charlotte Perriand1 Charlotte Perriand, at the bottom of the trio of tres jeunes, was the sole woman to be included. And though indeed tres jeune ? she was then 26 ? she was frequently cited as an important, independent designer in the French decorative-arts magazines. Today, however, Perriand is remembered primarily as an assistant to Le Corbusier, even though her career now spans some fifty years and includes such diverse projects as an extensible dining-table and turning-chairs (1928), exhibition stands for the world's fair of 1937, portable aluminium cabins mounted in 1938, furniture exhibitions in Japan during the 1940s and 1950s, a hotel interior in the French Alps (1946-8), Air France lobbies, and her present apartment, designed in 1970. Just ten years of this rich and productive career were spent working directly with Le Corbusier. At the risk of perpetuating biases, I will focus here on the early period of L Maurice Defrene: Woman's bedroom, Exposition des Arts Decoratifs, Paris, 1925. her career, which includes her collaboration with Le Corbusier. This provides an opportunity to explore the rhetoric surrounding the 'new woman' of the 1920s ? whether it had an impact on design and, con? versely, whether modernism is any way linked to issues of gender. harlotte Perriand was born in Paris on 24 October 1903, the only child of a tailor; unlike many other women designers of V^_&gt;* that era, such as Eileen Gray, Lily Reich, and Sonia Delaunay, she grew up in relatively modest circumstances. She spent much of her youth in the countryside with a maternal great uncle, a peasant in Burgundy, and with her grandfather, a blacksmith in Savoie. Following the example of her maternal aunt, she entered a women's design school, the Ecole de 1'Union Centrale des Arts Decoratifs, as a scholarship student in 1920. According to her own account, she was not particularly interested in academic pursuits, but could draw well.2 The school was quite expensive; as in the English craft schools, many women attended simply to refine their domestic skills. The course usually lasted three years, with only the most skilled students, like Perriand, selected for an additional year or two of advanced study. Students were required to study a variety of crafts, and the emphasis was on practical, hands-on experience rather than theory. The director of the school was Henri Rapin, a kind of middle-of-the-road designer, whose interiors were typical of the French decorative-arts movement of the period.3 Although not himself involved with mass production, he encouraged his students to enter the competitions sponsored by the trade journal Art et Industrie. Perriand gained more direct exposure to mass-production techniques in independent courses, taught on Saturdays by Paul Follot, director of Pomone, the design studio of Bon Marche department store, and by Maurice Dufrene, who had a similar role as the director of the newly created La Maitrise workshop at the Galeries Lafayette (Fig. I).4 Although their designs were conventional and were considered less progressive than those of several of their contemporaries, such as Robert Mallet-Stevens and Francis Jourdain, the furnishings were intended for middle-class clients and, in some instances, mass production. In this respect they differed considerably from Emile Jacques Ruhlmann's exquisitely crafted objets d'art, which were fashioned of rare veneers and discreet ivory inlays, or even Pierre Chareau's more functionally conceived but highly crafted furniture. Dufrene arranged for the Galeries Lafayette to produce the best of the student designs. On several occasions Perriand's work was chosen, and she continued to collaborate with Dufrene for a few years after completing her studies.5 Perriand's early designs, like those of her teachers, were hardly innovative or original. But what was unusual was how quickly she established herself as an independent designer. At the 1925 Exposition des Arts D6coratifs et Industrieis Modernes, she worked on the following projects for the Ecole de l'Union Centrale: a fresco, The New Muses; a wrought-iron grille; an elaborate edition of Eupalinos ou 2. Charlotte Perriand: 'The corner of a living room', Salon des Artistes Decorateurs, Paris, 1926.</page><page sequence="3">VArchitecte by Paul Valery; and some fabric designs for furniture in Dufrene's Galeries Lafayette pavilion. By the next year, she exhibited on her own. At the Salon des Artistes Decorateurs of 1926, she presented a 'corner of a room', including a table, chair and book case/cabinet in burl amboyna and Brazilian rosewood (Fig. 2). The design is strikingly eclectic, a kind of con? fluence of the dominant design strains of the day: the so-called 'modern traditionalists', such as her teachers Dufrene and Rapin, and the progressives, such as Mallet-Stevens, Jourdain, and Eileen Gray. The design's awkward stylistic juxtapositions, most overt in the table, were commented upon by one critic, Raymond Regamey. After praising her 'ingenuity', 'taste', and rejection of wood inlay, he writes: One's eye, however, ... is surprised by her solution. The glass creates an illusion of fragility, ... which suggests a metal support rather than a wooden one. A piece of furniture made of wood, on the other hand, ... requires absorption; a simple plate of transparent glass does not sufficiently justify the solidity of the supports.... The piece of furniture needs visual termination.6 Perhaps not surprisingly, Perriand's work underwent a major transformation the next year: she began to use tubular steel. In 1927 she designed several small metal tables, and for the Salon d'Automne she created 'the bar in the attic', made of chromed steel and aluminium (Fig. 3). Here she dispensed completely with the heaviness and horror 3. Charlotte Perriand: 'Bar in the attic', Salon d'Automne, Paris, 1927. vacui of Dufrene, the table support and top now joined in one graceful, cubic form. Instead of the elaborate, dark wallpaper of the 1926 exhibit, the walls were painted light pastel colours; all mouldings were gone. Perriand explains that Jean Fouquet, a modern jewellery designer, had lent her Le Corbusier's Vers une architecture and Les Arts decoratifs d'aujourd'hui, the latter a vehement indictment of the 1925 exposition. These books, according to Perriand, 'opened the wall before my eyes'.7 Like many of her generation, she was moved by the new mechanical inventions and the energy of the jazz age. She explained: Why this break? Probably, because I express my own needs: I'm aware and in tune with my own age. It is mechanical: the cars in the street strike the eye. They are polished, shiny. I wear chrome beads around my neck, a belt of metal links. My studio is chromed steel; and I wear my hair ? la Josephine Baker.8 Perriand was not unusual in linking female dress with innovation in the decorative arts (Fig. 4). Art Nouveau designers and critics had frequently credited women with changes in the world of decoration; and H.-A. Martinie, a contributor to Art et Decoration, noted in 1927: 'Women, for psychological reasons, ... are by nature in love with the new, while men in general grimace at change, and impede as much as they can variations in fashion. '9 Perriand's change, however, was not unique, or even uncommon. A number of the displays at the Salon d'Automne featured metal 4. Sonia De launay: Dress, coat, and car decoration, Paris, c.1926. furniture, including another, though less interesting, bar designed by Louis Sognot for the Atelier Primavera. The critic Regamey had been prophetic in his analysis of the Salon des Artistes Decorateurs of the year before. Describing the two types of contemporary designers ? those who continued the mode of 1910 and those who sought a post-war aesthetic ? he predicted that the second group would triumph over the first: 'We have just arrived at that moment when the first group is adjusting to the second.'10 Shortly before the bar installation, Perriand had approached Le Corbusier about joining his atelier. His response was hardly encourag? ing: 'We don't embroider cushions in my studio.'11 He attended the Salon d'Automne, however, and by the end of October she was work? ing with him at his studio at the Rue de Sevres (Fig. 5). The atelier was still small, including one Yugoslavian, Ernst Weisman, two Japanese, K. Maekawa and J. Sakakura, the Swiss architect Alfred Roth, and Le Corbusier's cousin and partner, Pierre Jeanneret. No one was paid ? at least, not regularly. Perriand continued to work independently and, in addition, received support from her husband, a wealthy, older English? man, who also paid for her private architecture lessons with Roth.12 uring the early 1920s Le Corbusier had been categorically (opposed to traditional notions of furniture. In L 'Esprit nouveau he had written the advertisements for Roneo metal doors and Innovation storage units, endorsed American office furniture in his photographic captions, and published a series of articles decrying contemporary decorative arts. He believed that furniture should be</page><page sequence="4">5. Charlotte Perriand with Le Corbusier, Percy Schoolfleld (her first husband), and Djo Bourgeois at the 'bar in the attic' (see Fig. 3). regarded as equipment ? functional, efficient, and standardized. The architect should not design these industrially produced components, but should leave the task to a technical expert. The architect's role was 'to order and proportion'. 'Architecture does not add.'13 Why, then, did Le Corbusier decide to hire a furniture designer in 1927? First, despite himself, he was often forced to go against his own conception of the architect as ordonnateur. While there were no signed furnishings in the Esprit Nouveau pavilion, many were of his own design. The modular storage units (casiers), the 'factory' windows, and the streamlined bicycle-tube stair were all custom-manufactured, sometimes at great expense; perhaps most ironic, the Maples club chairs had to be specially made, as the market models were too large to bring in through the pavilion's standard doors. If indeed furniture had to be designed, Le Corbusier probably preferred to use an 'expert' than 6. Charlotte Perriand: Dining room, Salon des Artistes Decorateurs, Paris, 1928. to rely on his own somewhat primitive efforts. He had a long tradition of such collaborations: the structural engineer Max Dubois for the Domino house, Amedee Ozenfant for painting, and the acoustical engineer Gustave Lyon for the design of his large auditorium spaces. Second, he had become frustrated by the market's failure to generate prototypes for mass production. Although he might have preferred industrial initiative, little had happened since the first world war to suggest significant changes within private industry. The 1920s in France were a period of cultural conservatism ? retour ? Vordre ? when themes of classicism and French tradition all too often outweighed any impetus for large-scale innovation. Le Corbusier came to realize that if he wanted viable prototypes they would have to be generated by his own atelier. Third, he was undoubtedly influenced by the Bauhaus designers Marcel Breuer and Mies van der Rohe. By 1925 Breuer had developed his famous Wassily chair, and by 1926 Mies his cantilevered side chair. The humble Thonet chairs looked quaint and somewhat out? moded beside these more overtly mechanistic designs. Le Corbusier was probably inspired to create his own answer to the problem of sitting, whether for comfort or for work. Perriand's first contribution to the office repertoire was the siege tournant (swivel chair) and extensible table, displayed at the Salon des Artistes Decorateurs of 1928 as a suite of dining-room furniture. This project was shown and published solely in her name,14 although the swivel chair has come to be known as a 'Le Corbusier' chair. Per? riand's design continued her explorations of the year before in metal furniture (Fig. 6). But now a new component was added ? mobility. 7. Le Corbusier-Jeanneret-Perriand: 'Siegeddossierbasculant', 1928-9. The chairs, made of chromed tubular steel, turned; the table, covered with black rubber, doubled in length; the glass panels, separating the dining room and adjacent office, slid. Mobility had been a constant theme in Le Corbusier's earlier publications; American office chairs and camp furniture were illustrated in L 'Esprit nouveau. Instead of the complaints about mechanistic sobriety that had characterized the reviews of Le Corbusier's 1925 pavilion, the reaction to Perriand's dis? play was highly favourable. H.-A. Martinie wrote, for example: 'The dining room of Charlotte Perriand would charm a Brillat-Savarin of 1928 by its gaiety, its comforts so well predisposed for pleasant dining and good company.' The furnishings, he added, 'are an especially in</page><page sequence="5">8.

Shortly thereafter, Perriand began working with Le Corbusier and Pierre Jeanneret on the three chairs for which the firm is famous: the siege ? dossier basculant, the grand confort, and the chaise-longue 9. Le Corbusier-Jeanneret-Perriand: 'Grand confort', 1928-9. (Figs. 7,9, 10). Le Corbusier had proclaimed the chair a 'machine-for sitting', but had stressed that such machines should accommodate dif? ferent states of being. In the Esprit Nouveau pavilion he had used the Thonet chair for dining and work areas, and the club chairs for relax? ation; his objective now was to analyse the different states of sitting and to find the appropriate prototype for each. As one sketch shows (Fig. 8), he determined some seven states, including work, lecturing, conversation, and relaxation. In this collaborative effort it is difficult, and probably a mistake, to assign authorship. Perriand credits Le Cor? busier with setting the problem.16 Typically, she worked out the designs and details, sometimes with the assistance of Jeanneret. Le Corbusier himself credited her with having 'the sole responsibility for the ex? ecution of all our domestic equipment'.17 While Le Corbusier described a work chair as an 'instrument of tor? ture that keeps you admirably awake', he envisioned the siege ? dossier basculant as a chair for living-room conversation. He noted that T sit down to chat: a certain armchair gives me a decent and polite pos? ition.'18 The chair itself is a reworking of the British officer's chair, with pony skin tautly stretched over the chrome frame, and arm-rests tightly sprung. In its separation of structure and body support, in its lightness and its mechanistic aesthetic, it also recalls Breuer's Wassily chair. But the differences in scale and elaboration are notable. The dimensions of the siege ? dossier basculant suggest a female occupant; in contrast, it is easy to imagine a rather corpulent corporate executive sitting in Breuer's earlier model. Rosemarie Bletter, in analysing designs by the women of the Bauhaus, has noted that their furniture often seemed more practical and comfortable than that designed con? temporaneously by their male peers ? owing, perhaps, not to any innate proclivity, but to a greater familiarity with the domestic world.19 Although Perriand certainly brought a sensibility and expertise in interiors to the firm's production, the chair has its functional short? comings: a wrong move activates the pivoting backrest, with surpris? ingly painful consequences. Le grand confort, a translation of the easy chairs of the club and the 10. Le Corbusier-Jeanneret-Perriand: 'Chaise-longue', 1928-9, from the Oeuvre complete. gentleman's library, was, in contrast, a machine-for-relaxing. Heavy, squat, plush, and rotund, it consists, in its two variants, of bulging leather cushions secured, indeed squeezed, by a chrome frame, offer? ing the essence of grand confort. None of the sachlich German</page><page sequence="6">designers had dealt with this issue. But again the solution was not per? fect. The cushions were originally stuffed with down, causing the sitter to sink too low, sometimes squashing the cushions below the outer frame. Rising was difficult. Cassina's reissue uses foam stuffing. The serpentine chaise-longue addresses another dimension of relax? ation. It allows for different reclining positions, with the weight of the human body fixing the position. The occupant must rise, however, to change the angle. Precedents include bentwood lounge chairs; adjust? able invalid chairs, common in the nineteenth century; and, fundamen? tal to the chair's sensuous quality, the earlier marquise or duchesse. Eighteenth-century grace and eroticism find their twentieth-century 11. Le Corbusier-Jeanneret: Picture gallery, Villa La Roche, before the 1928 additions. 12. Le Corbusier-Jeanneret-Perriand: Picture gallery, Villa La Roche, after the 1928 additions. equivalent in this light, undulating structure poised on four points, so beautifully illustrated by the classic pose of Perriand relaxing on the canvas (title page). Ironically, Le Corbusier evokes more mechanistic and masculine imagery in his description of the chair's derivation in Precisions: Here we have the machine at rest. We built it with bicycle frame tubes and we covered it with a magnificent pony skin; it is so light that it can be pushed with the foot, it can be moved by a child. I thought of the cowboy from the Wild West, smoking his pipe, his feet in the air higher than his head, against the chimneypiece: complete rest.20 Despite this, Corbusier published the photograph with Perriand. The decrease in specifically masculine and feminine forms is probably one of modern furniture design's most radical breaks with precedent. Because tubular steel combined such tra? ditionally male and female attributes as strength and lightness, distinc? tions between a woman's chair and a man's chair no longer seemed relevant. The lack of figurative imagery also reduced gender associ? ations, leaving scale as the one variable. (Is it possible, however, that the elimination of the expression of difference might, in some respects, be a loss?) In the design profession generally, gender distinctions were just beginning to be questioned. In 1927 the Union Centrale des Arts Decoratifs sponsored a competition for a woman's desk. The pro? gramme was controversial enough for the critic Rene Chavance to begin his article on the competition with the following remarks: A delicate programme, if one wishes to consider the customs and present-day aspirations of the recipient. A woman who does sports, who drives her own automobile, does she still need a desk? More than ever, since she has also earned university degrees, works as a professional, and would gladly leave the business of the household to her * weak' [defaillant] husband. But would she be content with a masculine desk? One may doubt this, because fortunately she has not renounced her desire to please. She adjusts poorly to surroundings that are not flattering; a slight, frivolous elegance goes well with her new seriousness.21 Perriand, however, makes no allusions to gender in her discussions of modern furniture. In her one essay of the period, in defence of metal furniture, she mentions sports, the automobile, and the 'Man of the XX Century' ? but not the 'Woman of the XX Century'.22 The three chairs and the so-called 'airplane' table were first used in two house commissions: in refurnishing the house of the bachelor La Roche (1928) (Figs. 11, 12) and in the recent renovation of Villa Church (1929) (Fig. 13), which included some early variants ? such as a padded basculant. But the polemical demonstration of Perriand and Le Corbusier's designs was reserved for the Salon d'Automne of 1929. Titled 'Equipment for the House', their exhibit included a large living area with smaller cells opening off it ? kitchen, bedrooms, bathroom, etc. (Fig. 14). Besides the new metal meubles ? movable pieces ? built-in storage was a major theme. Almost everything was made of metal and glass. The facade was a single plate-glass sliding window, with glass bricks below. The floor was of heavy glass slabs, apparently lit from beneath, and the ceilings were of etched and cut glass.23 With shimmering and reflective surfaces everywhere, the total effect must have been quite spectacular, even by the standards of Chareau's Mai son de Verre.24 The exhibit raises questions as to the nature of Perriand's con? tribution to the firm's style and design approach. How does this exhibit compare with Le Corbusier's earlier interiors? How does it compare with other modern interiors, such as Gropius and Breuer's exhibit for the Paris Werkbund of 1930? With regard to the first question, the firm's interiors undoubtedly</page><page sequence="7"></page><page sequence="8">gained a sense of 'total design' (Figs. 11,12). The aesthetic that perme? ated Le Corbusier's earlier spaces was less refined and more eclectic; the overall impression was that his furnishings could readily be replaced by others. In fact, they frequently were, and apparently with his approval. Although the Perriand designs were intended for mass production (and indeed were issued, in a limited edition, by Thonet), the 1929 exhibit suggested earlier attitudes of the Arts and Crafts Movement and Art Nouveau. A zeitgeist-conditioncd aesthetic, all encompassing in its attention to details, challenged notions of architec? ture as an efficient, neutral, functional container. These differences, between symbolic expression of the modern age and strict functionalism, are also evident in a comparison of the Salon d'Automne exhibit to Gropius and Breuer's design for a 'communal area of an apartment block' (Fig. 15). Similar to the Le Corbusier Jeanneret-Perriand exhibit in its use of industrial materials, its man? ipulation of interior space, and its identification of the machine aesthetic with health and cleanliness, the Gropius-Breuer exhibit appears, none the less, much more stark. This is not just the result of a difference in scale, Perriand and Le Corbusier's programme being smaller-scaled, but also, as Charlotte Benton has pointed out, the result of a different attitude towards furniture. Where Gropius and Breuer actually place an office filing-cabinet in a man's bedroom, Perriand and Le Corbusier use images of economy and efficiency more metaphor? ically. Their casiers, or storage units, are merely like office furniture; the principle, not the exact form, is adopted.25 More ephemeral, and difficult to describe, is a dimension of whimsy, charm, and even fantasy in the Perriand-Jeanneret-Le Corbusier 75. Marcel Breuer: Man 's room, Salon des Artistes Decorateurs, Paris, 1930. designs. For an exhibit in Cologne in 1931, for instance, the firm dis? played a rug made by Perriand out of synthetic animal skins and gar? ments, sold by Turkish vendors at cafes: it featured yellow lions on a bright-blue background, tigers on a red field, an image of the Eiffel Tower, and an angry lady ? a joke, Perriand explains, which startled the neue sachlich German designers (Fig. 16).26 Although Le Cor? busier's architecture had always been more mannered, idiosyncratic, and idealistic than that of his German colleagues ? most notably Walter Gropius, Hannes Meyer, and Ernst May ? Perriand appears to have played a large role in creating this more personal, expressive, and even sumptuous rendition of modernism. This was probably a result, at least 16. Le Corbusier-Jeanneret-Perriand: IRA (International Raumausstellung Gebr.) exposition, Cologne, 1931. in part, of her decorative-arts training. Comparisons of Perriand's work to that of other designers immediately come to mind: Eileen Grey's, where machine imagery is even more subjective and self? consciously artistic, or Pierre Chareau's in the Maison de Verre. Ironically, Perriand herself would not have distinguished her pos? ition in 1929 from the rigorous functionalism of the Germans or from that of an earlier Le Corbusier. In contrast to Gray, who condemned the reductive mentality of the Modern Movement, Perriand fully adopted the rhetoric of Le Corbusier. In an interview with a British reporter in 1930, she discussed his apartment, notably his electric fireplace: Your design shows a weakness. You ask 'what weakness?' Well, it is because you have introduced 'fantasy'. That is very bad. Believe me, I used to like fantasy; now I am sick of it. In my own flat, I have gradually got rid of all the things that I once thought were amusing, all the little decorative jokes. One gets to hate them. There should not be anything that is not useful. And she concludes: Now as to your design. Frankly I don't like it. All that fantasy. The owner likes it. Tant pis pour lui! Tant pis pour vous! Yes, I have been rude; but you asked me. A glass of sherry; Yes, with all my heart!27 The reporter described her as 'this charming and able designer'. Le Corbusier thoroughly acknowledged, as noted earlier, Perriand's role in creating the firm's 'equipment'; in these comments, he did not, as one might expect, refer to her sex. Yet he did discuss more broadly the importance of the 'new woman' to his design position. In 1925 he wrote, 'The evolution of women's dress in particular, and also in etiquette, has legitimized the new attitudes.'28 For Le Corbusier, a bachelor ? and long afraid of women ? Perriand and Josephine Baker, whom he met while travelling to South America in 1929, probably strengthened these impressions. In a lecture, 'The Furniture Adven? ture', which he gave in Buenos Aires, he describes women's innov? ations at some length (and with unmistakably erotic overtones): 10 AA FILES 15</page><page sequence="9">Woman has got there before us. She has brought about the reform of her dress. She found herself in this dilemma: to follow fashion and by doing so give up what modern technology ? modern life ? had to offer. To give up sport and, more materially, the chance of employment, which has given her a productive role in modern life and enabled her to earn her living ... To carry out the daily construction of her toilet: hairdo, boots, buttoning her dress, she would have had to give up sleeping. So woman cut off her hair and her skirts and her sleeves. She goes around bare-headed, bare-armed, with her legs free, and she can dress in five minutes. Moreover, she is beautiful; she enchants us with the grace of her figure... The courage, the enterprise, the inventive spirit with which woman has rev? olutionized her dress are a miracle of modern times. Thank you! What about us men? A dismal state of affairs! In our clothes, we look like generals of the Grand Army and we wear starched collars! We are uncomfort? able...29 What is female, thus, for Le Corbusier, is not nuance, detail, or fan? tasy, but woman's willingness to shed conventions. Just as furnishing had been bridled by tradition ? drapery, heavy chests, skirted chairs ? so too woman's body had been encumbered by fashions passed down by haute couture. Perriand's enthusiastic and whole-hearted endorsement of Le Corbusier's design principles may have stemmed in part from a personal sympathy. A woman who had since childhood loved the 17. Charlotte Perriand, 'Work and sports', project, c. 1929. country, climbing mountains, and peasant life may have found in mod? ernism a reinforcement of her own proclivities for simplicity. In 'Wood or Metal?', the essay of 1929 referred to earlier, Perriand had unequivocally endorsed metal. She described wood as a 'vegetable substance, bound in its very nature to decay; it is susceptible to humid? ity. Central heating dries the air and warps wood. '30 In her independent work, she adheres to this dictum as piously as in her collaborations with Le Corbusier and Jeanneret. An inventive project for 'Work and Sports', published in 1929, features tubular-steel beds, chairs, stools, a metal typing-table and, most novel, a phonograph cabinet (Fig. 17).31 But by 1935 Perriand is using wood. At the Brussels world's fair she proposed a 'chair for conversation', made of light wood and straw seat 18. Le Corbusier-Jeanneret-Perriand: Study, 'House for a young man', French section, Exposition internationale, Brussels, 1935; painting by Fernand Leger. ing (Fig. 18). These chairs were not fabricated by machine, but rather by hand in a small shop on Boulevard Saint-Germain, employing ex convicts. The chairs were, in fact, much cheaper than any of the metal chairs designed earlier by the firm.32 Although Perriand also used a couple of her earlier pieces in the display, her aesthetic had clearly changed. Instead of the highly reflective surfaces and urbane sophist? ication of the 1927 attic bar or the 1929 apartment, we now see a simple, almost primitive aesthetic, in which machine precision and standardization give way to anthropomorphic associations (note the arm-rests) and overt signs of craftsmanship, crude at best. Her exhib? ition the next year at the Salon des Arts Menagers, her tables en forme of 1937 and 1938 (Fig. 19), and a mountain-chalet annexe of 1938 (Fig. 20) show the same shift in concerns.33 Certain values were constant ? truth to materials, functionalism, the dismissal of furniture as a symbol of class distinctions or gender ? but mechanistic imagery had been rejected in favour of warmth, natural materials, and a more vernacular simplicity. In an essay of 1935, 'Habitation familiale', she pays homage to the houses of shepherds, peasants, and fishermen. It was no longer a choice between 'wood or metal', but a new sense of requiring 'each in its useful place, technically and physiologically'.34 Le Corbusier's style and objectives had also changed, as is apparent from house designs for Mathes and St-Cloud, both contemporaneous with Perriand's wooden chair. In fact, French art in general had changed. The double imagery of classicism and the machine, so evident A A FILES 15 11</page><page sequence="10">in the Purist paintings of the 1920s, had given way to more organic concerns: nature, peasants, and a general back-to-the-land ethos. The American stock-market crash, France's own ensuing depression, and the rise of Nazism had all challenged the dreams of industrial Utopia pervasive in the 1920s. These events touched Perriand deeply. She joined AEAR (Association des ecrivains et artistes revolutionnaires), the leftist writers' and artists' group, and became active with Leger and Pierre Jeanneret in the campaign against Fascism. Populism and access? ibility were now more important to her than the symbolic expression of machine production. At this moment her political and artistic position was perhaps closest to Leger; it is probably not coincidental that he chose her 1935 wood-and-straw chair for his living room.35 The intensely crisis-ridden atmosphere of the 1930s, in conjunction with private difficulties arising from an affair with Pierre Jeanneret, may have also encouraged her to explore more personal proclivities that had been previously overshadowed: first, in the decorative-arts milieu of her teachers and, second, in the face of Le Corbusier's own polemical vision. Unlike Le Corbusier, whose love of folklore was something dis? covered in travels and removed from his day-to-day experiences, Perriand's was tied to her childhood and her frequent trips to the 19.

Jose-Luis Sert described her as bringing to the office every day a new image, which she almost always called 'adorable' ? for example, a modest chair with nice proportions or a photograph of the interior of a peasant's house, white and half empty. This sensibility was so well known that Chareau, on seeing her Brussels chair, exclaimed, ' Voyons Charlotte! '36 What is perhaps most striking about Perriand's early work is its evo? lution from a skilful reworking of her teachers' premisses to a shedding of conventions and burdens of the past with the adoption of modernism, and finally to the discovery of her own voice ? one that is not marked by a so-called feminine sensibility for luxury or fantasy or by the sens? itive formal precision of Gray, but rather by a direct simplicity. The designs of the 1930s are calm, harmonious, and strong. The same might be said of their author. I would like to thank Charlotte Perriand not only for meeting me on several occasions, but also for spending two mornings in her atelier (June 1979) explaining her designs to a group of architecture students from Columbia University. Much of the information and many of the impressions in this article are a result of those visits. I would also like to thank Waltraude Woods, who first introduced me to Perriand and arranged for her to give us the slides of her work.

Conversation with Charlotte Perriand, 1 July 1984. 3. Ibid. Henri Rapin (1873-1939) began exhibiting at the Salons around 1903. He was generally considered a 'traditionalist' in the 1920s, and his interiors were usually highly ornamented with wallpapers, silk fabrics, pilasters, and painted friezes. For a general discussion of the Ecole de 1'Union Centrale des Arts Decoratifs, see Pierre Olmer, 'L'Ecole des Dames de l'Union Centrale des Arts Decoratifs', Art et Decor? ation 43 (January-June 1923), pp. 121-8, and Raymond Cogniat, 'Une Ecole feminine d'art decoratif, Art et Decoration 62 (1933), 117-22. For information on the early history of the Union Centrale des Arts Decoratifs, see L 'Union Centrale des Arts Decoratifs (Paris, 1927) and Debora Leah Silverman, 'Nature, Nobility, and Neurology: The Ideological Origins of "Art Nouveau" in France', (Princeton Uni? versity Ph.D. thesis, 1983), part 3. 4. Paul Follot, a traditionalist, was known for his delicate colours and graceful, curvi? linear lines. Despite his role as director of Pomone, he was adamantly opposed to the introduction of industrial features in domestic interiors. Maurice Dufrene (1876 12 A A FILES 15</page><page sequence="11">1955), a former colleague at La Maison Moderne and an old adversary, is harder to classify, as his contemporaries frequently acknowledge. Although his interiors of the early 1920s are in the traditionalist vein, he was a strong advocate of low-cost, machine-made furniture. He began using metal and glass in the late 1920s. Biographi? cal accounts of Follot and Dufrene can be found in Alastair Duncan, Art Deco Furni? ture: The French Designers (New York, 1984), pp. 48,128. 5. Conversation with Perriand, 1 July 1984. 6.

Henriot, long a fan of Perriand, concludes his account of the Salon: 'Dans l'autre salle, une joyeuse tri? nke: M. Djo Bourjeois, M. Rene Herbst et Mile Charlotte Perriand ont, pour notre plai sir, rivalise de jeunesse et d'esprit; le living-room et la cuisine du premier, le fumoir du deuxieme et la salle ? manger 1928 de Mile Perriand constituent le coin le plus frais, le plus original et le mieux reussi du Salon. C'est par eux que nous terminerons, pour etre satisfaits, notre visite des ensembles du Salon des Decorateurs.' 15. Martinie, p. 168. For instance, under the heading 'Charlotte Perriand and Le Corbusier', Perriand's former teacher and mentor Dufrene writes: 'The art of using metal based on intelligence and capable of charm. Charlotte Perriand has the will and the ingenuity of a man, combined with all the grace of a very young woman. Everything is designed for the convenience and comfort of the body, for function, or hygiene, but in spite of this it has distinction and a truly personal and feminine art.'

See also her account in Charlotte Perriand: Un art de vivre, p. 25. In his article 'Le Meuble metallique en serie', Henriot also notes this dimension of fantasy in the Salon d'Automne project, and attributes it to Perriand.

Other designs during this period include the fourteen m2 cell of the Radiant City, an exhibition stand for the plywood company Venesta, the editor's office at La Semaine ? Paris, the creche and dormitories of the Salvation Army Pavilion, and the public rooms of the Swiss Pavilion. By the time of the Salon d'Automne exhibition Perriand had also become an active polemicist for the Modern Movement. In 1930 she helped found the Union des Artistes Moderne (UAM), a design group committed to low-cost, mass-produced furniture; in 1933 she participated in the famous Athens meeting of the Congres Internationaux d'Architecture Moderne (CIAM); and in 1934 she attended a meeting in Moscow of the Soviets' Union of Architects as the firm's representative. 32. Conversation with Perriand, 1 July 1984. Dufrene organized the decorative arts section of the French pavilion, a 'Foyer de la famille francaise', and invited members of the Union des Artistes Modernes to design an 'apartment for a young man'. Rene Herbst designed a gymnasium, with panels by Leger; Louis Sognot, a bedroom; and Perriand and Le Corbusier, a study. Besides the straw chair, it included a storage cabinet with a zinc imprint of the Plan Voisin, a slate table with heavy cast-metal supports, a blackboard, a painting by Leger, a large photomontage, and a small, hand-crafted stool. In general, the imagery was more rustic than in their earlier collaborations, with pieces of driftwood, flints, and a fishing net echoing the themes of Leger. Perriand also contributed two photographs to Sognot's bedroom, one an image of an athletic woman swimmer, who might have been herself. The study is published in L.Ch., 'Belgique', Art et Decoration 64 (1935), 303, 308; 'Le Home de jeune homme', VArchitectured'Aujourd'hui6, ser. 5, no. 10 (October 1935), 61. 33.
