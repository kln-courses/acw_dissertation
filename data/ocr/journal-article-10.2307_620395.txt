(SUNY series in Judaica: Hermeneutics, Mysticism and Religion.) 375 pp. Albany, NY: State University of New York Press, 1995. $18.95. In this book the author seeks to describe the development of Halevi's thought, both as a system and as a developmental process. Silman argues that Halevi was first committed to a form of Aristotelianism which appears at the start of the Kuzari, largely in response to the challenges of Karaism. Then he came to be dissatisfied with this position, which he saw as inconsistent with the main principles of Judaism, and this led him to present a contrary view which emphasized concrete human experi- ence. Silman argues that there is no basic inconsistency in this change of mind and that</page><page sequence="2">352 REVIEWS the text itself has a dialectical structure which represents the evolution of his thought. The earlier account of the nature of reality is based on an ontological dichotomy between the human intellect and the nature of divine existence. The latter is essentially concerned with itself, while human existence is transient and variable and as a consequence, imperfect. We can perfect ourselves insofar as we can direct our attention exclusively to our intellect, abstracting from the particular historical and personal context within which we live. History does come into it, in that the possibility of human perfection is dependent upon appro- priate historical circumstances, and this is a point which takes on much greater significance later in the book. Halevi rejects the abstract nature of the relationship between God and his world, and comes to argue for the importance of the empirical fact that dialogue between God and his creatures has taken place and that there is evidence for it in the experience of individuals and groups. History, and specifically the history of the Jewish people, assumes great significance in that God is no longer accessible through the natural processes of the world but rather through the miraculous events which go against the principles of regularity. God's communication with the world, like his creation of it ex nihilo, is a historical event which he chose to bring about and which is directed at something outside himself. Perhaps the issue on which there is most distance between the Aristotelian philosopher and the religious believer is that of anthropo- morphism. The Philosopher in the Kuzari talks of a deity who is immanent in the world as the principle of form. As a result of this role, God is inaccessible via anthropomorphic language, which can only be a mistaken and crude attempt at representing materially what is essentially non-material. The later Halevi, though, values human ways of knowing such as the imagination, the senses and emotions, and sees in these valid ways of approaching and coming to know God. God is still immanent and has an essence which is unknow- able, yet he is knowable in a sense through his spontaneous activity in the world of generation and corruption, and primarily through his revelations to his creatures. In that case, anthropomorphic language has a valid use and needs to be employed. The history of the Jewish people, then, comes to have a religious signific- ance which is very different from the entirely abstract way in which the Philosopher seeks to describe the links between the deity and human beings. Through its history, the Jewish people have a route to an understanding of God which is both personal and unique, and their particu- lar access has a value and a meaning which surpasses the very limited emphasis on the intellect provided by the Philosopher. How plausible is the central claim that the Kuzari represents Halevi's intellectual and spir- itual development from Aristotelian philosophy to an entirely different approach to the nature of reality? There is no evidence at all for such a view from the text itself, but it could be an explanation for the variety of opinions which we find in the text. Of course, this variety is not an enormous problem for Halevi since the text itself takes a dialogical approach which allows different participants to express different views, and there is no need for all such views to end up with a resolution, although the King does eventually come down on one side rather than another. Silman's argument that the text represents a dialectical process which explores what is basically unsatisfactory about the Aristotelian view from a religious perspective seems strange, and the central problem here is the description of the Philosopher in the book as an Aristotelian, whereas he is really, of course, a Neoplatonist. There is scope for the Neoplatonist to develop his account of the links between God and the world in ways which are amenable to religious meanings and values, and this played a large part in the popularity of Neoplatonism as a philosophical technique at the time, in both Jewish and Islamic philosophy. Silman sets up too stark a contrast between the Philosopher and Judaism, a dichotomy which in the text itself is often bridged and weakened. These qualms aside, there can be little argument about the high quality of this excellent book, which is by far the best philosophical treatment of Halevi in English to date.
