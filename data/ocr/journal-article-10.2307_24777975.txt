<plain_text><page sequence="1">Old Tropes in New Dimensions: Stereoscopy and Franchise Spectatorship Caetlin Benson-Allott Shortly after James Cameron's three-dimensional epic Avatar (2009) was not named Best Picture at the 82nd Academy Awards, a Vanity Fair blogger asked the director how he felt about another hotly anticipated 3D feature, Alexandre Aja's Piranha 3D (2010). From his lofty position as the godfather of digital stereoscopic filmmaking, Cameron scoffed, "I tend almost never to throw other films under the bus, but that is exactly an example of what we should not be doing in 3-D. Because it just cheapens the medium and reminds you of the bad 3-D horror films from the 70s and 80s, like Friday the 13th 3D. When movies got to the bottom of the barrel of their creativity and at the last gasp of their financial lifespan, they did a 3-D version to get the last tew drops ot blood out ot the turnip. Cameron is hardly alone in his disdain for 1980s 3D horror sequels like Friday the 13th 3D (1982), which repeatedly and directly assaults its spectator's vision with knives, knitting needles, and even bales of hay. These virtual protuberances, or emergence effects, violate the film's hermetic seal and the illusion of voyeurism maintained by most mainstream monoscopic films. They gesture to the viewer and hail her as a self-aware, even knowing, spectator—that is, as precisely the sort of industrially-constructed connoisseur a fledgling franchise must produce to sustain its approach to sameness with difference. 12</page><page sequence="2">Cameron's scorn for 3D sequels overlooks the complexity of their spectatorial engagement, the way 3D emergence effects can produce a new spectator and—sometimes—a new franchise. Emergence effects allowed 1980s 3D horror sequels like Friday the 13th 3D, Jaws 3-D (1983), and Amityville 3-D (1983) to involve the spectator kinesthetically in their industrial aspirations to become franchises, or extended film series organized around a central concept (such as a psychokiller or a man-eating shark) and a set of formal and narrative conventions, or "rules," that provide structural continuity among installments. As the third film in each of their would-be franchises, these sequels all faced the challenge of extending commercially recognizable film properties without any of the original actors or directors. They had to offer viewers a new mode of identification with their series, indeed with their very seriality. Friday the 13th 3D was the most successful in this regard (it spawned another nine sequels) because it encourages its spectator to identify with herself as the enduring subject of the franchise. Its self reflexive set pieces and stereoscopic gestures engage the spectator as a franchise connoisseur, an expert who observes and enjoys the movie's performance of its rules. So important is the connoisseur spectator to modern horror series that recent sequels like The Final Destination (2009) and Final Destination 5 (2011) have also turned to emergence effects to reengage viewers in their metacinematic franchise.1 Their opportunistic emergence effects acknowledge and celebrate the viewer's participation in the stereoscopic apparatus and reveal that 3D sequels generate far more than "blood out of a the turnip." They expose the unique politics and praxis of franchise spectatorship. By focusing on how emergence effects manage generic and industrial imperatives, this article implicitly deviates from previous industrial histories of 3D that read it strictly in terms of product differentiation. Many critics argue that 3D film production increases whenever the film industry feels a new competitor threatening their box office revenues, with distributors then marketing stereoscopy as a uniquely cinematic visual experience. These competing platforms have included broadcast television (1952-1953), VCRs and time-shifting (1982-1983), and online distribution (2005-present) (Elsaesser 219). Justin Wyatt argues that filmmakers deploy stereoscopic spectacles to draw viewers back to the theater, but during each period of alleged 3D product differentiation, these competitors were also experimenting 13</page><page sequence="3">with stereoscopy (67, 94). The first 3D television broadcast appeared on KECA-TV in Los Angeles on April 29, 1953, less than six months after Bwana Devil (1952) introduced stereoscopy to US cinemas. After a long lull in 3D exhibition, SelecTV aired the first national 3D program in the US on December 19, 1980, nearly three years before the 1980s 3D cinema boom. During this period, many independent television stations also broadcast stereoscopic reruns of 1950s 3D films to help bolster their ratings (DeVries). ABC, Nickelodeon, and the Discovery Channel all continued to program 3D specials and special episodes through the late 1990s, making stereoscopy a broadly televisual phenomenon in the years leading up to digital 3D cinema. Today, 3D HDTVs and video game systems auger a promising future for stereoscopic home entertainment. In short, 3D may be associated with the cinema, much the way the feature-length motion picture has been, but it is not unique to the cinema and has not been since at least 1980. Therefore, we need to reexamine how different 3D movies approach product differentiation for their spectators and ask which particular industrial exigencies stereoscopy serves in each case. Among horror series of the 1980s and 2000s, 3D helps encourage a connoisseur spectatorship appropriate for the rule-based repetitions of the franchise, as the challenge facing all film franchises is how to make the very familiarity of their material exciting. The 3D sequels of the 1980s and 2000s exploit the gestural interactivity of emergence effects to engage viewers in recognizing the repetitiveness of their conventions, specifically their exotic forms of murder and accidental death. Stereoscopy brings into sharp relief the already self reflexive qualities of such set pieces, the way they produce spectatorial expectations and expertise. The 3D iterations of these kill scenes break the film's hermetic seal in two ways simultaneously. As they knowingly satisfy the rules of their franchise, they also address the viewer kinesthetically, making her newly aware of herself as viewer and connoisseur. There were horror connoisseurs before franchises, of course, but Hollywood franchises must produce connoisseur spectators to maintain the business models of the studio conglomerates. As Thomas Schatz and Kristen Thompson argue, the franchise defines contemporary Hollywood film culture and its fiscal aspirations for enduring intellectual properties (Schatz 22-29, Thompson 3-6). Thus by attending to the ways 3D emergence effects engage their viewers and promote connoisseur spectatorship, we can see how franchise economics are changing the relationship between viewer and film. 14</page><page sequence="4">Gesturing Beyond the Fourth Wall As if to acknowledge the formative role their emergence effects play in horror franchise spectatorship, 3D horror sequels frequently embrace stereoscopy by sending flying eyeballs out to greet their viewers. Jaws 3-D begins with a particularly apropos twist on the trope: a severed fish head floats forward from a cloud of blood to make eye contact with the viewer. The fish head directly precedes the movie's title card, which like all 3D horror titles uses exaggerated two-point perspective to emphasize figurai extrusion. Together these introductory spectacles give the Jaws 3-D spectator an important lesson in emergence effects and the optical phenomenon of negative parallax. Negative parallax is the process by which stereoscopic films make an image appear in front of the screen; specifically, negative parallax occurs when the image perceived by the left eye is located to the right of the image perceived by the right eye so that the eyes have to cross to create a unified image.2 Extreme or prolonged negative parallax can be uncomfortable for some viewers, especially when the left and right eye images are poorly aligned, as they sometimes were in 1950s two-strip projection systems. Single-strip and digital 3D projection largely resolved this issue, but viewer prejudice against negative parallax continues to haunt 3D film. Some critics denounce emergence effects for the same reason as monoscopic spectacles: because they halt narrative progress in the interest of visual pleasure (see Higgins 197).3 3D theorist William Paul refutes such criticisms, however, by suggesting that 3D films belong to "the cinema of attractions," or films that prioritize visual pleasure over storytelling (321). Paul demonstrates that parallax spectacles are not gratuitous to stereoscopic cinema—indeed, they are its raison d'être—but his "aesthetics of emergence" fails to explain why these effects irritate some viewers and excite others. If emergence effects ruin the classical Hollywood illusion of voyeurism, as Paul suggests, then what new relationship to the image do they offer the spectator? What feels different about watching a movie in 3D, and why might some critics and filmmakers wish to engage emergence effects despite their alleged disruption of viewer comfort, film narrative, and spectatorial suture? Emergence effects produce a different, more kinesthetically self-reflexive form of spectatorial engagement than monoscopic film. Their gestural solicitations renegotiate the spectator's proprioceptive awareness of herself as a viewing body and her relationship to the 15</page><page sequence="5">film's body—its physical apparatus, including its camera, projector, and screen. As Jennifer Barker observes, the film's body typically aspires to anthropomorphic movements and viewing positions. Although we humans "comport ourselves by means of arms, legs, muscles, and tendons, [and] the film does so with dollies, camera tracks, zoom lenses, aspect ratios, and editing patterns," for the most part its body has been designed to view in ways that feel familiar to humans (77). Indeed an anthropomorphic standard underwrites many popular notions of cinema's technological advancement, as André Bazin suggests in "The Myth of Total Cinema" (21-22). Consequently, many proponents of stereoscopy claim that it mimics natural human depth perception, while detractors claim that it looks and feels unnatural. I suggest that emergence effects do look and feel unnatural in cinema precisely because they draw the spectator's attention to the differences between her visual perception and the formal conventions of anthropocentric, monoscopic realism. Their protuberances remind the spectator that film's optics are not the same as hers and expose the spectator's impossible positioning in two places at once. As Barker explains, watching a movie requires viewers to exist in their world and the film's world simultaneously. Most films try to suppress that sensation for their spectators, and when such suture is achieved, "our situation is one of actual co-habitation, competence, dexterity, a natural state of being, and a 'genuine' experience that only seems false once we stop to think about it" (Barker 103-104). Emergence effects disrupt the "'genuine' experience," and of suture by denaturalizing the process of visual perception. They force the spectator to recognize her act of vision as participation in the film's physical production of spectacle, and this changes the scene of her pleasure from the film's setting to her own. To paraphrase Christian Metz, emergence effects make the spectator aware of herself as a spectator; they ask her to acknowledge her identification with her own look and thus her role in the cinematic apparatus (49). This self-awareness also helps the 1980s horror sequels hail their spectators as franchise connoisseurs. To create its connoisseur spectator, the successful franchise sequel must guide the viewer into fetishizing both her role as spectator and its repetitive properties. This agenda can be figuratively realized through emergence effects like the floating fish head of Jaws 3-D. In the long tracking shot leading up to the fish head, the camera assumes the point of view of a shark 16</page><page sequence="6">(or so the viewer may surmise, given that it adopts the gestures and rhythms of an underwater predator). Then, with a volley of swift cuts, the camera abruptly abandons the shark's perspective to linger on the remnants of its kill. Up until this point, the film's gestures have encouraged the spectator to "inhabit the film in a very real sense," but when the fish head floats into the liminal space in front of the screen, it creates a chasm between the film's world and the spectator's (Barker 103). While the fish head appears to float in this virtual space between worlds, the spectator experiences neither her own nor the film's vision as natural because they have colluded to create a virtual plane within the image. For some viewers, this virtual plane only ruins their immersion in the film's world. For others, it creates a new kind of kinesthetic spectatorship. Whether they shrink back from the gory spectacle or lean forward in curiosity, viewers become newly aware of their physical—and by extension their psychic—interaction with the film's body. They may lose their sense of suture, but they gain a sense of gestural interaction with the image. Emergence effects thus make the viewer aware of the film soliciting her involvement, and it is precisely this experience of spectatorial interaction that Hollywood horror franchises seek to create for their viewers. Franchise Eye-dentification For 3D horror sequels like Friday the 13th 3D, Jaws 3-D, and Amityville 3-D, emergence effects integrate composition with industrial aspirations. Unlike the first generation of 3D horror films and thrillers (such as House of Wax [1953] and Creature from the Black Lagoon [ 1954])—which tended to showcase negative parallax by reserving it for set pieces, big reveals, and emotionally significant moments—the 1980s 3D horror sequels employ emergence effects often and ostentatiously. Within its first fifteen minutes, Friday the 13th 3D breaks into negative parallax eight times with objects as various as an ax, snake, television antenna, and even a marijuana joint. This multitude of emergence effects reveals the filmmakers' enthusiasm for their platform as well as their awareness that they need to generate a new appeal for an aging premise, a new spectatorial lure to replace series novelty. Friday the 13th Part II (1981) responded to this urgency by introducing a new homicidal maniac, Jason Voorhees (who was a mere MacGuffin in the first film), but Friday the 13th 3D must offer viewers more than just a plot twist to keep the franchise 17</page><page sequence="7">alive. Consequently, its trailers explicitly promise viewers a higher body count and "a new dimension in terror" (see Figure 1). V\ } ' ' Ir/'9 ^ i Figure Through this new dimension, Friday the 13th 3D acknowledges its seriality with irreverent emergence effects that it employs as stereoscopic homages to its own rules. As I mentioned, Friday the 13th 3D breaks the frame and assaults its viewer early and often with a wide variety of objects. The movie integrates these optical gambits into the rules of its slasher franchise by alternately startling the spectator with intrusive gestures and giving her ample time to anticipate them, as when Vera (Catherine Parks) dies while retrieving a friend's wallet from Crystal Lake. As Vera wades into the water, Jason Voorhees (Richard Brooker) approaches on a nearby dock. This is Jason's first appearance in his infamous hockey mask, so at first Vera mistakes him for her friend Shelly. The spectator recognizes Jason immediately, however, and spends the period of 18</page><page sequence="8">Vera's confusion in eager anticipation of Jason's incipient attack. When Vera finally asks, "Who are you?" Jason slowly raises the spear gun he has been carrying. At first his weapon of choice may surprise or disappoint the viewer—slasher killers and their fans typically prefer the intimate mess of blades and bludgeons—but when Jason pulls the trigger, negative parallax quickly reveals its appeal. After Jason fires directly at the camera, slow motion allows the spectator to delight in the spear's penetrative promise as it hurtles towards her. A reverse shot then reveals that Vera's left eye has been punctured by the spear, which now hovers in negative parallax before the spectator. This ocular assault improves upon the two-dimensional slasher set pieces of Friday the 13th (1980) and Friday the 13th Part II by both reaching out to the viewer and paying homage to Edwin S. Porter's The Great Train Robbery (1903), a wildly popular example of the aforementioned "cinema of attractions" that also fires a gun directly towards the camera. Friday the 13th 3D even prepares its spectator to recognize this homage by placing a poster for The Great Train Robbery in an earlier set. Like Porter's early crowd-pleaser, Friday the 13th 3D gestures towards its spectator to hail her desire for spectacle and demonstrate its desire to satisfy, but it also does this through the iconography of the slasher movie, which exhibits a unique propensity to assault its viewers' vision. As Carol Clover notes, the genre includes a "plethora of images of eyeballs gouged out or pierced with knives, ice picks, and hypodermic needles [not to mention] blinded by hot coffee, acid, insect spray, or simply—and significantly—bright light" (191). Friday the 13th 3D contributes to this gruesome repertoire with kinesthesia. By engaging the spectator's body in its diegetic threats to bodily integrity, it physically involves her in its acknowledgement and enjoyment of the tropes of its subgenre. Emergence effects thus provide Friday the 13th 3D with a figurai language to break the hermetic seal and appeal directly to the spectator. Through negative parallax, the 3D sequel can acknowledge that it is being watched, that it wants to give the spectator what she desires to see and perceive. Moreover the film pairs such self-reflexive nods with an industrial awareness of itself as a horror sequel. As film geek Randy Meeks (Jamie Kennedy) explains in Scream 2 ( 1997), there are rules a horror sequel must follow: "Number one: the body count is always bigger. Number two: death scenes are always much more elaborate—more blood, more gore. Carnage candy." Screenwriter 19</page><page sequence="9">Kevin Williamson based Randy's rules on franchises like Friday the 13th, and its third incarnation both evinces and celebrates them. Not only does its trailer predict its unprecedented body count, but the movie enhances the slasher's characteristically phallic weapons by placing them in negative parallax. In short, it marries its stereoscopic aesthetic to industrial orthodoxy and, in so doing, hails a new kind of self-reflexive spectator: the franchise connoisseur later embodied by Randy. Through its multiple instances of frame-breaking "carnage candy," Friday the 13th 3D draws its spectator's attention to the rules of the franchise. Its denaturalized images place figurai emphasis on denaturalized conventions of the sequel to form an explicit exchange with the knowing spectator it is also generating. This is why Friday the 13th 3D was able to perpetuate its franchise while Jaws 3-D and Amityville 3-D failed. Those films never reference their antecedents or acknowledge their roles in franchises or as sequels. Friday the 13th 3D uses self-conscious negative parallax effects to exhibit the movie's larger awareness of itself as a sequel, thereby generating and rewarding the spectator's awareness of its repetitiveness and seriality. At the point when horror sequels become a series—around the third or fourth film, when the filmmakers begin turning characters into intellectual property in the hopes of drawing on them in perpetuity—the films must begin to offer pleasure in predictability. They need to integrate a certain degree of showmanship, self-awareness, and even self-mockery into the presentation of their set pieces. This is not to say that they mock their viewers; rather, their self-mockery trains their viewers to expect and enjoy the very self reflexive spectacle that James Cameron finds so tough to tolerate. Hence Friday the 13th 3D both rewards viewers who have seen the previous two Friday the 13th movies by figuratively assaulting them with its franchise fetishes and encourages new viewers to value such self-reflexive moves for their ostentatious conventionalism. The repetition inherent in its dozen death scenes trains the spectator to embrace the same but different—or more of the same but different for viewers who did see the earlier films. But regardless of the individual viewer's franchise knowledge, Friday the 13th 3D self-consciously constructs its own connoisseur spectator, its own cinephile or knowing fan, through the fetishization of repetition. In fact, this technique is already in evidence in its introductory sequence, which is also the concluding sequence of Friday the 13th Part II. The sequence is only 20</page><page sequence="10">two-dimensional, and while this difference may at first alienate, it later appeases because of the relationship it helps the film establish with the spectator. Specifically, it affirms the spectator as the privileged subject of the franchise because it allows her to enter the narrative from a position of superiority to the characters, who have no idea that there is a madman loose in the woods around Crystal Lake. So even before the movie begins its stereoscopic gestures towards the audience, the spectator already understands herself to occupy a more important position in the franchise than any of its transitory characters. Finally, it is important to note that Friday the 13th 3D's playful engagement with its connoisseur spectator still appeals even when remediation forces one to watch it in two dimensions. Like most 1980s horror movies, Friday the 13th 3D left theaters quickly and was transferred to a variety of home video formats. While JVC produced 3D VHD discs of Friday the 13th 3D for Japanese audiences in 1990, the movie did not appear on 3D video in the US until its Deluxe Edition DVD release in 2009 (Hayes 119). Monoscopic video compromises the kinesthetic impact of Friday the 13th 3D's emergence effects, but their self-reflexive gestures to the spectator remain clear. Take, for instance, the scene in which Jason crushes Rick's (Paul Kratka) head between his hands. It ends with Rick's eyeball popping out at the camera, the third emergent eyeball in the film and by far the most self consciously spectacular; not only does it fly straight into the camera, but Rick also grunts out the Friday the 13th theme while dying. Seen in two dimensions, the flying eyeball may not cause a video viewer to recoil, but it still expresses the movie's attempt at direct engagement with its spectator. In fact, because the video version bears traces of the platform its movie no longer occupies, it encourages the spectator to imagine what its emergence effects might have looked and felt like, inspiring fantasies of a lost stereoscopic idyll. 3D's virtual plane thus becomes even more significant for the video viewer precisely because it is inaccessible. The lost dimensionality of the various emergence effects now hovers over their monoscopic versions, imbuing them with phantasmatic history. The video spectator can delight in picturing what she cannot really see, in producing a persistence of effect and affect over remediation. In short, remediated emergence effects still hail the connoisseur spectator because the intent behind their address remains quite visible. 21</page><page sequence="11">The Final Destination of Franchise Spectatorship In the twenty-first century, 3D spectacles continue to construct connoisseur spectators for tired horror franchises. Take, for instance, the Final Destination series, which began in 2000 as a novel low budget conceit: a high school student envisions a horrible plane crash while boarding a flight to France, but after he and several friends exit the plane and thereby "cheat" death, they die one by one in horrible accidents and in the order they would have perished in the crash. Unlike its concept-driven predecessors in the horror franchise business, the Final Destination series thrills its spectators with the sheer inevitability of death. For though the deaths in the Final Destination series are often ridiculously complicated, there is no antagonist behind them, just "fate." Consequently, the franchise emphasizes novel kill scenes in lieu of a novel killer. Its set pieces even resemble Rube Goldberg devices in their intricacy, as when high school teacher Valerie Lewton (Kristen Cloke) dies while making herself tea. After pouring the tea, Valerie decides she wants vodka instead, but the cold liquor cracks her previously hot mug. Valerie ends up dribbling vodka across her house as she walks and sips. When the vodka drips into her computer monitor, it short-circuits and explodes, sending a glass shard into Valerie's neck and igniting the trail of vodka leading back to her kitchen. The fire quickly spreads to her stove, overheating the vodka bottle that then explodes and knocks Valerie to the floor. Valerie reaches for a dangling dishrag to staunch the blood still flowing from her neck, but the dishrag is hanging from a knife block she carelessly tossed it on while making tea. Pulling the dishrag causes the knife block to overturn, its contents to impale her. While Valerie struggles to free herself, the stove itself explodes, knocking over a kitchen chair and thereby driving a knife into Valerie's heart, finally killing her. All told, this sequence takes over four minutes, but through its very duration, it affirms intricate death as one of Final Destination's, franchise rules. Final Destination 2 (2003) and Final Destination 3 (2006) repeated Final Destination's premonitional premise and Rube Goldberg set pieces but with less novelty, leading critics to suggest that the franchise was exhausted. The Final Destination 3 filmmakers had sought to avoid this fate by releasing their sequel in 3D, but in 2006, digital 3D was still an unproven commodity. Chicken Little had had 22</page><page sequence="12">some success with the technology in 2005, but few exhibitors had yet adopted the platform. So although Final Destination 3's premonitional impetus—a rollercoaster accident—betrays its aspirational interest in 3D tropes and aesthetics, the film was released monoscopically and possibly as the terminus of the series. Yet by 2008, 3D had become such a booming business that New Line Cinema agreed to revive the franchise for a fourth, stereoscopic installment. After The Final Destination grossed an unprecedented $186.1 million at theaters, New Line's parent company, Warner Brothers, quickly greenlit Final Destination 5. These 3D sequels both feature accidental deaths just as elaborate and improbable as their predecessors', but they reinvigorate their franchise by further involving the spectator in its self-reflexive proj ect. Final Destination 1,2, and 3 were designed to be metacinematic slasher movies without a slasher, but The Final Destination extends the powerful appeal of the connoisseur spectatorship already operating in these movies by constructing and acknowledging viewer expectations through emergence effects. Both it and Final Destination 5 also hail franchise connoisseurs by incorporating their predecessors' set pieces into their stereoscopic effects. In so doing, they make enfranchisement part of the visual pleasure they offer the spectator. The Final Destination orders its stereoscopic effects so as to familiarize the spectator with the visual conventions of 3D horror before it uses the genre's visual clichés to build franchise expertise. To that end, the movie initially deploys emergence effects for short, surprising, and disgusting death scenes. The movie's first post-premonition victim, Nadia (Stephanie Honoré), is crushed by a flying Nascar car such that (or so that) her head explodes towards the spectator in a typical "aesthetics of emergence" (Paul 321). Later on, when Andy (Andrew Fiscella) is driven into a chain link fence by a carbon dioxide canister, the movie uses negative parallax to confuse and amuse the 3D connoisseur its earlier effects created. When Andy hits the fence, there initially appears to be an error in the negative parallax because the chain link fence seems to occupy the same plane as Andy's torso. While the spectator tries to reconcile these incompatible depth cues, chunks of Andy's torso begin to fall towards her. As it turns out, the fence has been driven halfway into Andy's body. Moreover, the film situates the chain link fence at the level of the screen, so that Andy's death actually occurs at the limit between 23</page><page sequence="13">his reality and the spectator's. This ironic enactment the film's fourth wall defies cinematic suture and pushes the spectator outside of the world of the film while at the same time rewarding the spectator for recognizing the movie's veiy artificiality. By emphasizing its visual effects as illusions, the movie encourages the spectator to understand herself as a 3D connoisseur, to smile in appreciation as chunks of virtual flesh seem to fall into her lap. The Final Destination and Final Destination 5 also create their connoisseur spectators by stereoscopically reenvisioning their predecessors' death scenes during their opening and closing credits, respectively. The Final Destination begins with digitally-rendered 3D X-ray versions of the previous three films' most creative and iconic deaths, including Valerie Lewton's (see Figure 2). In so doing, it hails a franchise connoisseur by reviewing its franchise concept and reimagining the franchise's best set pieces. This credit sequence also teaches the spectator how to watch Final Destination movies— that is, to watch for the spectacle of death rather than coherent narrative, convincing performances, or philosophical depth. The film thereby creates the kind of spectator it can reward through its use of negative parallax. That said, this pedagogical credit sequence may also have been intended to mark The Final Destination as the last of its franchise. Franchise economics dictate that production companies never kill a golden goose while it is still laying eggs, however, so Warner Brothers simply revived the technique for Final Destination 5. Final Destination 5 closes with a compendium of Final Destination death scenes, a montage set to AC/DC's "If You Want Blood (You've Got It)." This highlight reel comprises actual footage from the other movies but adds new emergence effects to each scene. Monoscopic knives, fan blades, and metal plates now receive 3D counterparts that appear to fly out at the spectator. These digital additions to existing footage undermine conventional notions of film as fixity, as preserved time; instead they retroactively constitute Final Destination as a 3D franchise. For viewers of prior installments, they suggest that these set pieces were direct addresses to the spectator even when they were not figuratively aimed at her. For new Final Destination connoisseurs, meanwhile, they advertise the trove of franchise pleasures that awaits her. 24</page><page sequence="14">ANUMW rjfclLLA, . jusm MLOOSN Figure 2 Of course, these summary sequences cannot explain why a viewer might want to be interpellated into an expertise of Final Destination films. Even during their most sublime set pieces, the movies still contain bad acting, unbelievable dialogue, and dubious metaphysics. While the pared-down fatalism of the first Final Destination did provide audiences with an interesting alternative to the slasher formula dominating US horror in the 1980s and 1990s, its novelty is antithetical to and unsustainable within the logic of the franchise. Moreover the Final Destination premise itself is insufficient to inspire viewers to return again and again for more formulaic decapitations, penetrations, and dismemberments. If we want blood, there are other places to get it. Indeed, genre competition is precisely why horror franchises must cultivate connoisseur spectatorship. In order for a franchise to create brand loyalty and lure viewers to past and future installments, it must create in them the feeling that it—the film and the franchise—recognizes and wants to interact with them. The horror franchises I have analyzed therefore replace the traditional filmic pleasures analyzed by Christian Metz, Stephen Heath, Laura Mulvey, and other apparatus theorists with a direct spectatorial appeal. Instead of privileging the spectator with an impression of voyeurism—the pleasurable illusion that the film world exists for her viewing pleasure while its inhabitants remain unaware of her look—these 3D horror films show the spectator that they know they are being watched, that they want to be watched. Their emergence effects deliver their franchise concepts and self-reflexive set pieces 25</page><page sequence="15">right into her lap. This kinesthetic address destroys any illusion of voyeurism, but it offers the spectator a different sense of participation in the motion picture apparatus. Through emergence effects, these movies each hail her as someone who knows their rules better—who is more a part of their world—than any of their characters. To wit: every Final Destination protagonist eventually has to be informed of the premise of his or her franchise, usually by friends or a sinister mortician played by Tony Todd. Yet each movie is also structured to guarantee that its spectator already understands the "rules" before such exposition. Hence characters can come and go in these franchises (or die, as the case may be), because the spectator knows herself to be their enduring subject. Of course, stereoscopy can fulfill a much wider range of spectatorial needs than these horror franchises require. For viewers of James Cameron's Avatar (2009) or Martin Scorsese's Hugo (2011), it can create a proprioceptive sense of presence on another planet or at the beginning of cinema history. In Werner Herzog's Cave of Forgotten Dreams (2010), it comments on the interrelation of art and immersion in the Chauvet caves. These movies all rely on positive parallax to create a deeper sense of traditional profilmic space, but negative parallax emergence effects have other, possibly counterintuitive advantages. Although they break with traditional cinema aesthetics by breaking the frame, emergence effects affirm the physical relationship between viewer and screen and thereby create new forms of spectatorial pleasure. Horror movie franchises have adopted this technique to create their ideal viewer, the franchise connoisseur, who comes to the film to be recognized and addressed by it. Unlike a traditional cinephile, this connoisseur spectator does not necessarily possess an advanced knowledge of cinema history. Instead, a feeling of expertise is produced for her by the movie's self-deprecating allusions to its formula; its elaborately staged, self-reflexive set pieces; and the gestural economy of its 3D emergence effects. When horror sequels have employed emergence effects without other self-reflexive appeals to the spectator (as in the case of Jaws 3-D or Amityville 3-D), their gestures feel uncoordinated and pointless. But when self-reflexive filmmaking is combined with a kinesthetic address to the viewer— as is the case in Friday the 13th 3D, The Final Destination, and Final Destination 5—the spectator experiences her active look as the organizing principle producing franchise coherence. Thus 3D horror 26</page><page sequence="16">sequels offer their viewers the pleasure of being the explicit subject of their franchise; no longer a monoscopic Peeping Tom, the connoisseur spectator of the stereoscopic franchise installment dons her glasses for a fresh sense of cinematic and industrial centrality. For all its critical condemnation, then, negative parallax can make its viewers feel pretty positive. Notes 1 Final Destination is not the only twenty-first century franchise to embrace 3D emergence effects but unfortunately it is the only one 1 have time to analyze in this article. I encourage other scholars to examine the arrival of stereoscopic spectatorship in the Saw (2004 2010), Resident Evil (2002-2012), and Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974-2013) franchises and—of course—the Piranha movies (1978 2012). 2 Positive parallax does the opposite: it makes images appear behind the screen by placing the left eye's image to the left of the right eye's image. In zero parallax—or standard, two-dimensional film—the left and right eye perceive the same image. 3 For more on the origins of the spectacle versus narrative debate, see Jacobs and de Cordova, 293-308.
