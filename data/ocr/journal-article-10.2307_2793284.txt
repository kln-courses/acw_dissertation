That this weighty tome is the result of much original observation and thought is undeniable, it mu st, however, be admitted that much of the latter rema ins obscure. This is in part due to the method of pres en- tation and in part to the language-the author i s a Russian, and has written in English, for which we must be grateful and accept the limitations that a fore ign language imposes. Professor Shirokogoroff's theory of ethnography both as regards its content and method is too complicated to be dealt with here, but one important factor in it, that the ethnologist should be aware of his own culture complex and its implications before he can hope to analyse any foreign culture, is surely not so unaccept- able an idea as he appears to suppose, and it is unneces- sary that reference to it should be repeated so frequently. Undoubtedly it should be an axiom for field workers. According to the author, the psychomental complex is made up of those 'cultural elements which consist ' of psychic and mental reactions on milieu.' Unfortu- nately the word 'complex' is used so often and in so many different ways that it is impossible to discover the meaning apart from the context. In describing the Tungus culture Professor Shiro- kogoroff takes into full consideration their reactions to their neighbours, the Manchus, Chinese and Russians. Their culture is far from simple-certain beliefs, the social structure, and varying environmental factors bring into prominence a pronounced psychological type which may be considered as crystallized in the person and behaviour of the Shaman. As I have had the advantage of observing ceremonies embodying some of the essential elements of shamanism in peoples so different ethnically and with such varying environmental background as the Veddas, Sinhalese villagers, and Sudanese soldiers. I may call attention to the close correspondence of these to the shamanistic ceremonies of the Tungus. In all cases ecstasy was brought about by rhythmic movements, singing and drumming (the Veddas, who have no drums, beat the abdomen); there is no doubt of the genuineness of the autohypnotic condition produced. In all cases spirits entered the performers, who spoke in a changed voice. At some period in the ceremony the performer fell to the ground apparently unconscious. In all a sacrifice was made, and in all special 'properties ' are necessary. The purpose of all ceremonies is to make contact with spirits and to cure disease or avert misfortune. Professor Shirokogoroff uses a convenient term for the special properties that are necessary for the spirits to rest on or enter, viz., ' placings,' these differ greatly both as regards form and material, in the different ethnic groups, but though they may be anthropomorphic in form and offerings be made to them they are not sacred -the offerings are only made wh'en the spirits have be- come immanent. Deference may, however, be shown to the placings of malevolent spirits. Icons, Chinese pictures, or living animals may all be placings. Spirits feed on the immaterial products of the sacrifice; thus, incense, smoke fumes, and the products of putrefaction are particularly pleasing. A shaman cannot deal with and master a spirit until it has occupied its ' placing.' It is noteworthy that such 'placings ' are important in the Ceylon ceremonies, where a whole day may be spent in building elaborate objects of traditional forms.

Insanity may be due to a spirit using a human body as a 'placing.' A condition called by the Tungus olong is socially recognized; it might be looked upon as an ' imitative 'mania,' and only in vary rare cases is this condition regarded as pathological. Mass 'olonism' may occur in certain situatioas. This phenomenon he maintains has a social function without which the life of the Tungus would be impoverished. The theory that spirits exist, may enter human beings, and may act when in poss3ssion of their bodies, is correlated with seven types of habitual traditional behaviour which might be considered abnormal in other societies. Persons showing som-n of these peculiarities may become shamans if they can prove their fower to master the spirits. Both men and women may become shamans; the best shamans are believed to be those who have shame n ism on both sides of the family. With dual organization and cross-cousin marriage, there is tendency for shaman- ism to be hereditary though this is not an essential factor in the transmission of the function. Comparison with the Veddas is here inevitable. Their social organization and the beliefs are similar, and shamanism is a central feature of their culture, but nothing comparable with olonism or mass hysteria has been observed among them. In spite of the size and weight of the volume, the obscurity of the language, and the complexity of theory and arrangement, this work is undoubtedly a valuable analysis of a peculiarly interesting culture.
