WERTZ Southern Illinois University Texas Christian University at Edwardsville at Fort Worth I Demea and Philo open the discussion in Part X of David Hume's Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion with a rather detailed inven- tory of the extent and variety of evil (both moral and physical) in the world. Reluctantly, Cleanthes then admits the reality of evil, although he "hope(s) that it is not so common as you [his guests Philo and Demea] represent it."1 This seemingly innocent admission on the part of Cleanthes provides an initial point of agreement between himself and Philo, and subsequently it comes to function as the first premise in the latteťs moral refutation of the deity. However, two cleverly executed literary devices camouflage the attack. First, Philo makes it appear that he is merely denying the possibility of an a posteriori dem- onstration of divine benevolence. And is it possible, Cleanthes, said Philo, that after all these reflections (concerning evil), and infinitely more which might be suggested, you can still persevere in your anthropomorphism, and assert the moral attributes of the deity, his justice, benevolence, mercy, and rectitude, to be of the same nature with these virtues in human creatures? His power we allow infinite: whatever he wills is executed: but neither man nor any other animal is happy: therefore he does not will their happiness. His wisdom is infinite: he is never mistaken in choosing the means to any end: but the course of Nature tends not to human or animal felicity: therefore it is not established for that purpose. Through the whole compass of human knowledge, there are no inferences more certain and infallible than these. In what respect, then, do his benevolence and mercy resemble the benevolence and mercy of men (66)? Secondly, he formulates his argument enthymematically- leaving its conclusion only implicit. "Epicurus's old questions are yet una^ 1 David Hume, Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion , ed. H. D. Aiken (New York, 1948), p. 65.

Is he able, but not willing? Then is he malevolent. Is he both able and willing? Whence then is evil (66)?' " II At this stage, a number of questions suggest themselves to our at- tention. What indeed are the motives behind Philo's oblique proce- dure? Moreover, just how is it possible to reconcile the radical tenor of these passages with various other sections of the text? Has not Philo already agreed that "the question can never be concerning the beingy but only the nature of the deity (15-16)?" Also, does he not concede total victory to Cleanthes at the very close of the Dialogues (94-95)? Such queries as these are not to be taken lightly. In answer to the question regarding Philo's motives, there is one patently obvious reason for his not having given a more complete expression to the argument, and it is psychological in nature. A con- clusion derived by the reader is, we submit, much more persuasive than one supplied by the writer.3 Furthermore, Hume is compelled, for both legal and personal considerations, not to make his indictment of the deity entirely explicit. During the eighteenth century, one must remember, the Church of Scotland enjoyed immense political strength. Statutes prescribed very large fines and lengthy prison terms for those who were merely lax in their observance of the Sabbath! The minimum penalty Hume could expect from a more brazen attack on theism- a permanent ban against the publication of his work- was a risk he would try to avoid at almost any cost.4 Now, as for the alleged contradictions in Philo's position, they can be resolved within the framework of two distinct yet complementary interpretations (empiricism and scepticism) .5 It cannot be denied that Philo grants the existence of some "original cause" of the universe. This admission has little or no significance, however, since the nature of the supposed first cause is indeterminate. And, after all, what sort of evidence has been cited in support of the religious hypothesis? For his part, Demea believes that men are driven to theism from an intuition of their own ignorance and weaknesses. Religion, he contends, is the only satisfactory answer to the human quest for absolute mental and physical security (61). Quite aside from the question of whether or not such pronouncements may serve as an adequate description of the concrete human condition, there are, we believe, other serious difficulties inherent in (and not simply extraneous to) Demea's posi- tion. Suppose, if you will, that man is, in fact, the sort of "imbecile" which Demea takes him to be. Is it not at least mildly surprising that !99</page><page sequence="3">this mental dwarf should then be capable of appreciating his lowly station? But, even allowing man some vague awareness of his intel- lectual limitations, by what authority does he then embark on a voyage of metaphysical speculation? And, how can he possibly afford to insist on the objective truth of his convictions? With Cleanthes, we realize, the situation is somewhat different. His case is founded on an observable "order" in Nature. Assuming, as he does, the empirical utility of the twin metaphysical principles of causation and analogy, he infers that regularity in the world has an "intelligent" source (17). On the other hand, as Philo argues in Part XI, there are countless weeds to be discovered in the garden of the universe. Thus, Cleanthes, forced by his own criteria (causation and analogy), comes to agree with Philo's chilly judgment: "The whole presents nothing but the idea of a blind Nature, impregnated by a great vivifying principle, and pouring forth from her lap, without discernment or parental care, her maimed and abortive children (79) !" Neither a sceptic nor an empiricist need assent to the claims of Demea or Cleanthes, and Philo tries to keep a foot in each of those camps. There is, then, it seems to us, an unmistakable comic twist in certain of Philo's remarks.6 Cleanthes has won only a Pyrrhic victory. Ill On the basis of the evidence presented in the second section of this paper, it is clearly Philo's intention to disprove the existence of God. 2 The ancient questions to which the speaker refers are very likely not those of Epicurus. More probably they belong to the Roman sceptic Sextus Empiricus, cf. Outlines of Pyrrhonism , III, 8-10, in R. G. Bury, ed., Sextus Empiricus (Cam- bridge, 1961), I, 330-333. But whatever its historical antecedents, Hume's argu- ment has a unique formal structure, and the conclusions it warrants are stronger than any hitherto presented. 3 See pages 16-17 of the Dialogues for another example of an enthymematic argument. 4 James Noxon, "Hume s Agnosticism, m V. C. Chappell, ed., Hume: A Col- lection of Critical Essays (Garden City, 1966), p. 375, overlooks this point. 5 A. G. N. Flew, "Hume, in D. J. O Connor, ed., A Critical History of Western philosophy (London, 1964), pp. 253-74. 6 The Dialogues cannot therefore be considered an expression of simple reli- gious scepticism. N.

Chappell, op. cit., pp. 384-85, have all been led astray in their literal and selective interpretations. See B. A. O. Williams, "Hume on Religion," in D. F. Pears, ed., Hume: A Symposium (New York, 1963), p. 79, for yet another perspective on this issue. Also, for an ex- tended treatment of Hume's literary style, see J. V. Price, The Ironic Hume (Austin, 1965). 200</page><page sequence="4">But, his inference does not follow solely and directly from the infor- mation contained in the immediate context. There are, of course, some vague hints to the effect that "omnipotence" and "benevolence" have the status of sine qua non conditions for divinity. Still, the exact num- ber and form of the hidden premises are not altogether clear. Such being the case, the validity of the argument is in some doubt. Several recently published expansions of Philo's argument have contributed nothing to the alleviation of this uncertainty. Rather, they have served only to intensify it. For example, in an apparent misquote, Melvin Rader adds the following series of questions: "Is he neither able nor willing (to prevent evil)? Then why call him deity?"7 Al- though these questions are not contradicted by any of the Hume passages, their logical consequences are not particularly gratifying. Conjoining the Rader premise with those of Philo (assuming the rhetorical character of all the questions) would not justify a direct inference of the nonexistence of God. The invalidity in this case stems from a confusion between disjunctive and conjunctive proposi- tions. Perhaps a translation of the argument into a symbolic scheme will provide a further clarification of our point: proof . i. E 2. (W -) A) - &gt; I 3. (A+ -W) -» M 4. (A + W) - E 5. - (A v W) -&gt; -G /•'. -G8 A proof of invalidity for this argument-form is not difficult to con- struct. Assuming a nonempty universe, a selective (yet consistent) ap- plication of truth-values to each of the terms involved, yields a situa- tion in which all the premises are true and the conclusion false. One of several substitution schedules of values by which such a result may be achieved is as follows: W as false; and E, A, I, M, and G as true. Of course, this invalid argument may be repaired by a transforma- tion of its final premise. Restructuring that proposition in the form, "If 7 Melvin Rader, The Enduring Questions (New York, 1966), p. 338. 8 For the sake of convenience, the component factors "evil," "willing," "able," "impotent," "malevolent," and "God" have been symbolized by the characters E, W, A, I, M, and G, respectively. The following legend applies to the con- nectors: + = conjunction, - = negation, and - » = implication. Otherwise, the familiar Whitehead-Russell notation has been employed. Although this sym- bolism is rather unsophisticated, it does allow us to make a significant point with- out, at the same time, forcing us to consider the question as to whether or not existence is a predicate, or whether "God" is a logically proper name or a definite description. 201</page><page sequence="5">he [God] is either unable or unwilling [to prevent evil], then there is no God/' a proof of validity can now be supplied rather easily: proof. i.

Much the same sort of prob- lem is connected with Nelson Pike's amendment of the Philo argu- ment.9 Anyone who adopts such an interpretation must be prepared to believe that premises two and three have been included as mere rhetorical ornaments. However, literary embellishments of this type are simply contrary to Hume's style ( 16-17, 69) • A more textually faithful alternation of Philo's argument has been presented by Irving M. Copl. He makes the addition of the following premise: "If God exists, then he is neither impotent nor malevolent."10 Evidently for pedagogical reasons, Professor Copi then deliberately and invalidly draws the conclusion that God does not exist. The proof of invalidity is similar to that used previously in the Rader case.11 Yet, the basic problem here is of a different sort. The disjunction of "un- able" and "unwilling" does not, of itself, provide a sufficient condition for either "impotence" or "malevolence." Nevertheless, if the Copi formulation is viewed as being itself incomplete, then it may be pos- sible to construct an expression of the argument which is ( 1 ) formally correct, (2) consistent with other relevant portions of the Hume text, and (3) utilizes all the various premises contained in Philo's original presentation. Consulting the remainder of the dialogue, one finds Cleanthes ask- ing: "For to what purpose establish the natural attributes of the deity (e.g., omnipotence), while the moral are still doubtful and uncertain (67) ?" And, shortly thereafter he says "divine benevolence ... is what I willingly embrace (68)." Thus the Copi premise seems to be confirmed. The only missing link, then, is some expressed connection »Nelson Pike, ed., God and Evil (Englewood Cliffs, 1964), pp. 1-5, 85-102. 10 Irving M. Copi, Introduction to Logic (2nd. ed.; New York, 1961), p. 299. 11 Solutions to Exercises for I. M. Copi's Introduction to Logic , p. 69. 202</page><page sequence="6">between either "inability" and "impotence" and/or "unwillingness" and "malevolence." Taking into consideration the statements made by Philo towards the end of Part X, it appears that "inability" and "un- willingness" are, of themselves, assurances of "impotence" and "ma- levolence" respectively. "Why is there any misery at all in the world? Not by chance surely. From some cause then. Is it from the intention of the deity? But he is perfectly benevolent. Is it contrary to his in- tention? But he is almighty (69)." Through a reconstruction of these remarks, one may derive the following proposition: "If he is either unable or unwilling to prevent evil, then he is either impotent or malevolent." With the addition of this premise, the nonexistence of God may now be validly deduced: proof . 1. E 2. (W -' A) I 3. (A -) W) -&gt; M 4. (A + W)-»-E 5. G-&gt;- (I v M) 6.

Hoitenga has argued that "the problem of evil is not except superficially a question of the formal consistency of propositions "12 While one may be willing to admit that the problem of evil is not purely and simply a question of formal logic, one need not agree that this particular dimension of the topic should be completely neglected. Indeed, the fact that there have appeared in print so many invalid statements of the argument from evil indicates to us the sterility in- herent in any purely informal treatment of the issue.13 But having established the validity of Hume's argument, an equally important task remains to be accomplished. We must now address our- selves to an assessment of the soundness of the argument. To begin with, Hume's assertion of the reality of evil and misery is not an appeal to any naked or completely objective set of facts, but to basic human sensibilities. Only someone with "metaphysical" tendencies would dare dispute the existence of evil. Also, for Hume, the divine attributes 12 D. }. Hoitenga, "Logic and the Problem of Evil," American Philosophical Quarterly , IV (1967), 114. 13 For another example of a technically invalid argument from evil, consult Henry D. Aiken, Reason and Conduct (New York, 1962), p. 175. 2°3</page><page sequence="7">must be univocal in meaning with those terms as they are applied to human beings. Therefore, he uses an ordinary language criterion of meaning. The conventional notion of infinite goodness is that it is utterly opposed to evil. Similarly, part of what is implied by omni- potence is the ability to prevent evil. Hence, to suggest that omni- potence and perfect benevolence are compatible with evil is to take excessive liberties with the meanings of these terms; and Hume's argu- ment is, therefore, linguistically unassailable. Objections to the Hume position have not been lacking, however. Nelson Pike, for example, does not believe that an ability and a will- ingness to prevent evil need be taken as necessary conditions for omni- potence and benevolence respectively. One counter-instance, he sug- gests, would be the case of the devoted parent who administers a dose of bitter medicine to his sick child. One does not exclude such a parent from the class of the good merely because he causes a certain amount of unavoidable suffering.14 Presumably, however, an almighty parent could make the medicine sweet and /or prevent the child's ill- ness altogether. In which case the fact of the illness as well as the bitter tasting medicine suggests more the sadist than the loving and pro- tective parent. Pike's challenge is thus without any genuine force. Another more traditional objection to the Humean posture comes from the libertarian school. According to the libertarian thesis, it is man in his freedom, and not God, who is the ultimate source of evil. That the human being must be free is explained in the following man- ner. Because God is omniscient, he has foreknowledge of man's virtue or lack of it, and he does not require an empirical test in order to de- termine whether or not an individual is going to be saved or damned. On the other hand, God is also said to be a being of infinite love, and so he must grant men the opportunity to accept or reject the call to goodness. Thus far it seems that the freedom theory constitutes a viable alternative to that of Hume. However, there may turn out to be some crucial defects in the libertarian position which would make it far less attractive than Hume's. Consider for a moment the suffering of innocent children. To the best of our knowledge, the adherents of libertarianism have offered no explanation for such occurrences which does not involve, at least implicitly, an appeal to ignorance. Moreover, how could a true saint be tempted? Would not all supposed tempta- tions be no more than annoyances? Once again the divine goodness would be called in question.15 Until the libertarian develops a more 14 Nelson Pike, op. cit., pp. 88-80. 15 In this case we need not commit ourselves to the type of determinism of which Hume has often been accused. 204</page><page sequence="8">philosophically acceptable defense of his position, Hume's argument would appear to be the stronger of the two. Thomists, who are also advocates of freedom, have sought to rescue the classical concept of the deity on still another basis. They have asserted that the divine attributes have analogical , and not univocal meanings.16 Therefore, it is sufficient to minimize the importance of evil as Cleanthes tries to do (68). But, an analogy depends on some specifiable point of similarity among its analogues, and there does not seem to be the slightest similarity between an infinitely powerful and benevolent God who allows the existence of the least evil and the vir- tuous but limited human being who does what he can to prevent such events. Philo's reply to Cleanthes makes this point aboundantly clear: "But allowing you, what never will be believed; at least, what you never possibly can prove, that animal or, at least human happiness in this life exceeds its misery, you have yet done nothing: For this is not, by any means, what we expect from infinite power, infinite wisdom, and infinite goodness (69; our italics)." Perhaps the most serious objection to Hume's stance comes from Charles Hartshorne and Ninian Smart. Both these gentlemen contend that the meaning of "good" would simply evaporate in an entirely Utopian or heavenly domain.17 This sort of criticism would be effec- tive against Hume only if he identified good with the absence of evil, and David Hume is much too competent a logician to be satisfied with negative definitions. His only point is that, according to the rules of common parlance, the absence of evil would be a necessary , albeit not a sufficient, condition for an all-good world.18 Given, then, the soundness as well as the internal consistency of the Philo-Hume argument, the God who has been refuted is only that God who claims to be both omnipotent and benevolent. The case for a good God who is limited in power (as championed by Brightman, James, Mill, and Weiss) is still intact. Although, as Philo indicates, God cannot be conceived as creator of the universe. "It would have been better, were his (Goďs) power extremely limited (as indeed it seems to be), to have created fewer animals, and to have endowed these with more faculties for their happiness and preservation. A build- er is never esteemed prudent who undertakes a plan beyond what his 16 Thomas Aquinas, Summa Contra Gentiles , ch. LXXI. 17 Charles Hartshorne, A Natural Theology for our Time (LaSalle, 1967), pp. 81-82, and Ninian Smart, "Omnipotence, Evil, and Supermen," in Nelson Pike, op. cit., pp. 103-112. 18 In fairness to Professor Hartshorne, we should point out that he, too, recog- nizes the impossibility of any metaphysical justification for evil. Evil can be good only per accidens , and not per se, op. cit., p. 81. 205</page><page sequence="9">stock will enable him to finish (76)." There are, of course, those who persist in defending the concept of a benevolent and omnipotent deity. But, if in fact there is such a God, then either evil does not really exist (the position to which Cleanthes is finally reduced), or his goodness is tautologous and therefore meaningless (Demea's view).19 19 Recent explorations of this latter theme may be found in J. L. Mackie, "Evil and Omnipotence/' and H. J. McCloskey, "God and Evil," both in Nelson Pike, op. cit., pp. 46-47, 61-84, and E. H. Madden, "The Many Faces of Evil," Philos- ophy and Phenomenological Research , XXIV (1964). 206</page></plain_text>
