<plain_text><page sequence="1">NORTHFORK Michael Polish, U.S., 2003 When what passes for religious inquiry in American film is Bruce Almighty , the frustrating work of the Polish Broth- ers becomes nearly indispensable. Twins Michael and Mark have forged a distinctly reverent version of the American Northwest Pastoral, as informed by European cinema as by provincial mythologies. Their site-specific allegories (Michael gets sole director credit, while they both co-write all their scripts) manage to be ineffable and mysterious, and respectful of regional idiosyncracies where other directors are merely condescending. Beneath the Lynchian dreamworld paraphernalia of their debut fea- ture, Twin Falls Idaho (99), lurked a startlingly conven- tional do-gooder morality tale; likewise, in their follow-up, Jackpot (01), the grimy karaoke-bar narrative was coated with a pristine hi-def video veneer, its twinkling Christmas lights granting its mangy characters an unspoken dignity as they scrambled towards redemption. Rounding out this declared trilogy, Northfork attempts to deepen the spiritual center usually hidden at the core of their work. That old- time religion is dredged up from the outset, like the river burping up a wooden coffin from unknown depths in the opening shot. Cinematographer M. David Mullen's faded panoramic tableaux of the majestic Montana Plains become snapshots of paradise, an indelible series of crys- talline slides that commingle the celestial and the earthly with all the shades of the gray scale. Northfork is Elia Kazan's Wild River as reimagined by Wim Wenders, a precarious balance of New Age mysticism, cryptic satire, and devout regionalism. A small town sit- uated in the nook of a gorge, Northfork is about to face a disaster of biblical proportions: a newly completed hydro- electric dam is poised to submerge the region. Most of the populace has been relocated, yet some remain, including the warmhearted local priest (as played by Nick Nolte, a grizzled warmhearted local priest), the sickly orphan in his care, and a ragtag group of honest-to-God angels stuck in a musty, ramshackle homestead, earthbound and searching for one of their number gone missing. As if the film isn't already overflowing with disparate moods and narrative threads, we also follow six members of the state-funded Evacuation Committee (James Woods, Peter Coyote, and Mark Polish among them), Angels of Mercy masquerading as Angels of Death in their trenchcoats and fedoras. They appear to work on commission, Ã  la Glengarry Glen Ross , making home visits to persuade the holdouts to leave town before it's too late. Sputtering storytellers with visual invention to spare, the Polish Brothers seem to thrive on creating tense ambi- guities as an overcoat for their generally thin narratives. Review Their films are two-hour struggles for opacity; rather tra- ditional story arcs concealed by images fogged with an endless series of empty prophetic gestures. Finally, it's less a case of all is revealed than all becomes hopelessly transparent - these are dime novels of spiritual illumina- tion. Especially in Northfork , they mean to disorient the audience with every cut, uneasily moving back and forth between the real dream world and the dreamlike real world; their brand of magic realism (replete with Julie Taymor-ish anthropomorphic beasts on stilts) seems ulti- mately as schematic and distancing as the tiring crosscut- ting. With Wild River , Kazan used a similar backdrop to examine moral choice, but the point of view here is nag- gingly omniscient. The people in Northfork don't really interact - they just seem to wander into one another's peripheral vision. Only Daryl Hannah, whose oversized Raggedy Ann angel resembles her Blade Runner android after a 12-step program, manages to poke through the screenplay's proverbial platitudes. There's no doubt that Mark and Michael Polish have quietly carved out a niche for themselves in indie cinema, endowing their dog-eared fables with a current of wide- eyed optimism eschewed by other, more skilled, story- tellers such as the Coens or Jarmusch. They seem to desperately want to be the preeminent poets of the North- west, and certainly their portraits of Twin Falls, Idaho, Jackpot, Nevada, and Northfork, Montana, form a triangu- lar American diorama of outsiders' dreams - if one can crawl from the oppressive twilight of Twin Falls to the ascendant daybreak of Northfork, then perhaps there's hope for us all. It registers more conceptually than emo- 73</page><page sequence="2">tionally, however, perhaps because the trilogy's finale doesn't amount to a theological debate so much as the filmic equivalent of a pocket-size volume of "Angels Among Us," complete with miniature golden bells and brass trumpets. Though hampered by its schematic script, Twin Falls Idaho may remain their most accomplished film, a relatively unforced, unsensationalized freak show of sorts that ends in a bucolic Thoreau daydream of tall grass and walking sticks, a heavenly plain not unlike Northfork's halfway house between heaven and earth. Northfork's glorious compositions can't reconcile the physical threat of this baptism-by-flood with its truly bib- lical implications, and the film hovers in an airless space between piety and whimsy. - -Michael Koresky Northfork opens on July 11.</page></plain_text>
