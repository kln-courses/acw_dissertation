<plain_text><page sequence="1">81 Les Brisants: Framing the Poem and the Print Maryann De Julio 'The prose poem", as Michel Beaujour points out, "was to remain closely associated with the art of the print and follow its thematic and formal evolution, as both found their common locus and medium in the album or art book."1 It is precisely the conjunction of these two different systems of representation: prose poetry and graphics, that I should like to examine in Jacques Dupin's plaquette Les Brisants (1958), whose frontispiece is by Joan Miró.2 Indeed, Les Brisants can be read as a model for the art-poetry connection throughout Dupin's entire oeuvre. From his earliest plaquette Cendrier du voyage (Paris: G.L.M., 1950 [with a frontispiece by André Masson]) to the more recent volume of his previously uncollected art criticism, L'Espace autrement dit (Paris: éditions galilée, 1982), Dupin's writing has explored the links between word and image. Notably, Dupin has often undertaken projects associated with Joan Miro's art as demonstrated by his highly regarded study Miró (Paris: Flammarion, 1961) in which he emphasizes poetic aspects of the artist's work.3 Miro's aquatint for the frontispiece to Dupin's collection Les Brisants exhibits the shared characteristics of book art during the five-year period 1956-60. The aquatint is in color; its idiom is to some extent non-figurative or abstract.4 However, Miro's frontispiece can also be read as an emblem for Dupin's text. Understood as a study in figuration, Miro's art print frames and facilitates a reading for the prose poem. Both the print and the poems emphasize a material immediacy, simultaneously foregrounding their subject and their space. Reminiscent of the genre of portrait painting, Miró's aquatint frames its subject in a number of ways (Figure 1). First, the borders of the book and of the page frame the print. Second, vermicular blobs of white ink and dots in discontinuous series grouped according to color: green, red, blue, or yellow, decorate a transitional space that is both open and closed in its design. Finally, the inscribed figure frames what can be construed as eyes, nose, mouth, and chin. However, each anthropomorphic</page><page sequence="2">82 trait is graphically linked to one of the more indeterminate elements that exceed the limits of the face as framed. Miró's use of biomorphic signs whose material immediacy renders the subject present, prepares the reader for the materiality of Dupin's writing. Like Miró's art print, Dupin's prose poems can be seen collectively as a study in figuration that frames its materiality as subject in several ways. First, language is a repository of linguistic and literary tradition that the poet shapes to his own ends. At the same time, the materiality of the evoked image is tied to the phonemic constellation of its utterance, as well as to the typographical process from which it results. In the poem "La Lumière n'est pas conçue," for example, the line "Rien que pour toi, racine, pour toi, cyclone fourvoyé dans cette strate du langage," rooted, as it were, in the French literary tradition, suggests the caesura of Racinian diction, as well as its ardor. As in Gérard Genette's definition of the rhetorical figure, presence is perceived in the distance or gap between sign (language) and meaning (absent literary and linguistic antece- dents).5 The verb fourvoyé implies that the figure cyclone becomes a visible entity in the text by its having strayed into what Genette terms the "inner space of language": "fourvoyé dans cette strate du langage." Attention is thus focussed on language as a material entity that engenders both literal and figurative contexts in which to frame itself as subject: (1) Rien que pour toi, racine, pour toi, cyclone (2) fourvoyé dans cette strate du langage, le (3) poète a favorisé l'épaississement limoneux du (4) sommeil où tu te ramifies. Le livre dont il (5) est l'otage et le garant, le livre incompulsé, le (6) livre intermittent, tourne sans hâte sur ses (7) gonds dans la terre, et chaque page à ton (8) attouchement prend feu, et sa substance se (9) confond avec le surcroît de ta sève, avec le (10) progrès de son sang. (11) Perfectifilité du vide, racine de l'amour. Cette (12) équation je l'ai vaincue avec un océan de terre (13) ameublie par mon souffle. Throughout the poem "La Lumière n'est pas conçue," Dupin presents the figurative level of the text as the unfolding of a</page><page sequence="3">83 material occurrence. By that I mean that the series of figures in lines four through ten function on a rhetorical level insofar as they allude to that literary and linguistic tradition invoked in the first line above by the noun racine. The nouns otage, garant, and sang, for example, are signs of a drama of power and passion. The poet repeatedly reminds us, however, that the signification of this drama only becomes apparent in its material context: the turning of the pages of the book. Via the juxtaposition of a figurative and literal vocabulary, Dupin thus succeeds in creating a space of free play in which we move between these two contexts: the figurative and the literal, cognizant that both are material constructions framed within the work {le livre). Repeatedly in Les Brisants, Dupin uses a dislocated imagery of land and body in order to present both the subject of the text and its figurative and literal context in a material space. Dupin's debt to the Surrealist notion of the image as put forth by Pierre Reverdy (the juxtaposition of two distant realities judiciously combined)6 is especially evident in the poem entitled "Le Réel" where Dupin uses land and body images to suggest that the poet is both prophet - he sees a future time - and pioneer - he forges a new space: (1) II gouvernait la croissance ascétique des (2) lances parmi lesquelles je naissais. Ses yeux (3) en marche, immenses, portaient allègrement (4) leur charge de limon vers des bourgs à secourir, (5) des points d'eau à reconnaître. Je me flattais (6) de lire dans ses traces, dans ses rides, dans ses (7) lacunes. Mais l'arrogance et l'ampleur de ses (8) excréments me reléguèrent au bout de son (9) exploit. Là, le simulacre d'un grand feu inclina (10) ses reflets sur mon ongle. Cette absence de sens (11) et de vues, je m'engouffrai dans son manteau (12) de roi. (13) Le fruit déçu toise la main coupée. Il fait (14) grand jour à présent, parmi nous, jusqu'au (15) coeur. Traditionally, the image ses yeux is the corporeal attribute that is used to evoke the poet-as-seer or prophet. The juxtaposition of ses yeux with the expression en marche (lines 2-3) situates the poet-as-seer within the movement of the text, thus relating voir</page><page sequence="4">84 (to see) with voie (textual movement and trace) which, inevitably, recalls voix (voice). As a consequence, an oracular point of view becomes mobile. For our purposes, the following line in 'Te Réel" illustrates the self-conscious gesture of the poet whose mobility enables him to distance himself from his own writing: "Je me flattais de lire dans ses traces, dans ses rides, dans ses lacunes." Similarly, the line "Cette absence de sens et de vues, je m'engouffrai dans son manteau de roi," points out a mobile perspective that now foreshortens the distance between sign (vues) and meaning (sens) via the rhetorical figure: son manteau de roi. In the first line, the figures traces, rides, and lacunes emphasize the literal notions of space and distance. In the second, son manteau de roi remains at the level of the figurative and attempts to close, dare I say clothe, rather than point out the gap between sign and meaning. The italicized poem that begins and dictates the tone of the entire collection Les Brisants privileges a system of framing in which the distance between sign and meaning permits the poet to focus on figure and ground, alternately. The line "Jusqu'à Torée du cri," conjures up the liminal figure of the Echo myth whose body parts are scattered among the landscape. Only a phoneme away from l'oreille (ore:j): ear; lorée (ore): edge of forest, makes the text resound in the reader's ear to the degree that we hear it twice-told. In a word, Dupin doubles voice and sense as a means of shifting from figure (ear) to ground (edge). In our emblematic reading of Miró's frontispiece for Les Brisants, we mentioned how Miró decorates a transitional space with colored dots, vermicular lines and a star - the intersection of several lines or foci. All of the above serve as markers for perspective and remind us of the literalness and modernity of Miró's art. Miró's art is modern to the extent that it is aware of itself as a constructed reality. To paraphrase the art critic Clément Greenberg, Miró's print understands itself as something that begins and ends, no matter what happens in between, with ink applied to the surface of a page.7 We find this literalness and modernity represented throughout Dupin's collection Les Brisants, and in particular, in the poem entitled "Source murée": (1) Clartés vénielles que leurs chutes! (2) mutilent leurs traits pour que reculent les (3) miroirs, et c'est un masque qui pousse le cri.</page><page sequence="5">85 (4) La terre ne souffre plus. Une courte fumée (5) s'engouffre dans le masque. Dehors, avec (6) d'obscures précautions, s'ouvre l'eau cor- (7) rompue, l'eau pacifiée, l'eau minuscule. . . (S) La fatalité que j'illustre n'est pas exempte de (9) ruptures, de félonies, de tremblements: mes (10) imprécations, mes ratures. Mais déjà la racine (11) du Temple a percé le pied du marcheur pour- (12) rissant. Déjà l'étincelle a changé de prison. Like Miró, Dupin frames his subject in several ways, telling the reader that he is doing so as he does it. Typographically, the poem "Source murée" consists of two squared-of f paragraphs separated by a half-inch margin of white space. It occupies the approximate middle of the volume Les Brisants. "Source murée" can be read on both the figurative and the literal levels. It is a text that examines the notions of source and creation. On the figurative level it presents the source in terms of man's fall from grace {la chute). On the literal level the source is a physical body of water: la chute (now meaning, the falls). Creation can be linked to the myth of genesis and consequently to the source as a fall from grace. Creativity can be linked to the genesis of the text and its literary and linguistic sources which are reworked and are contingent upon the writer's originality. As seen previously, the literal and the figurative are juxtaposed throughout Dupin's text such that each level influences our reading of the other. We are thus reminded that the poet has combined two distant realities into a composite whole. Dupin presents the poet's creative struggle in "Source murée" as a conflict between the figurative and the literal and their attendant attributes in this text: the spiritual and the material. The initial image clartés vénielles connotes a spiritual and material range of darkness and of light that is expressed in a vanitas topos developed through images of reflection and self-reflection that include le miroir, le masque, and la souffrance. The suggested reflection in a line such as "Ils mutilent leurs traits pour que reculent les miroirs et c'est un masque qui pousse le cri" recalls the first line of "Source murée" and the image la chute: both material entity and spiritual condition. In the second paragraph of "Source murée," emphasis shifts from the word: an image read on simultaneously figurative and</page><page sequence="6">86 literal levels, to the illustration: a configuration that instructs us in our reading of words and images. Already outside (dehors) by the last line of the first paragraph, the white space between the two paragraphs, as well as the ellipses reminiscent of Miró's series of dots that decorated the transitional space in his aquatint, highlight the fact that we are hors texte in the second. To the extent that hors texte is the technical term that designates the illustration plate that accompanies any text, Dupin now comments directly upon how and what he illustrates in this specific text: La fatalité que j'illustre n'est pas exempte de ruptures, de félonies, de tremblements: mes imprécations, mes ratures. In other words, fate is both the thematic and formal source for the poem. Thematically, we understand fate as man's original fall (from grace). Formally, the fate of the text is what Mallarmé termed le hasard in Un Coup de Dés (1987) and what the Surrealists referred to as le hasard objectif in their manifestos. The presence of the poet in the text becomes the vehicle for the distribution of the thematic and formal aspects of fate within the work. Despite the figurative movement as conveyed by the verbs: s'ouvre, reculer, s'engouffrer; and the literal movement in the text itself: imprécations, ratures; Dupin cannot transcend the materiality of his work. The distances and gaps that we perceive throughout Les Brisants are illuminated in "Source murée" by the image: l'étincelle. However the line: "Déjà l'étincelle a changé de prison" reminds us of the fact that Dupin has created a mobile framework in which to present his subject and its space. The very choice of the title "Source murée" sets up a series of figurative and literal reflections in the text from which escape is seemingly impossible. If we return to Miró's frontispiece as the emblem for Dupin's text and to the inscribed figure within the acquatint, we find a material solution to our textual dilemma. The third, fourth, and fifth lines in the first paragraph of "Source murée" provide metaphorical equivalents for the painterly notions of figure and ground in Miró's print: miroirs, et c'est un masque qui pousse le cri. La terre ne souffre plus. Une courte fumée s'engouffre dans le masque. Dehors, avec These metaphorical equivalents for figure: masque, and ground: terre, are then inscribed in like manner in the text by two parallel</page><page sequence="7">87 lines of writing on both sides: lines one and two; and lines six and seven. To the extent that the lines in the text and the lines in the print can be construed as mirror reflections of each other - the literary point of view reflected in the painterly perspective and vice versa - we can find a provisional escape from the figurative and literal lines of the writing in the hors texte: the illustration, i.e., Miro's aquatint. The distance that we have examined throughout our reading of Les Brisants in an attempt to determine a rhetorical presence in the text can now be contemplated in the move that we are instructed to make between the art print and the series of prose poems. That is, the material distance between the print and the text (between painterly signs: the print, and literary meanings: the text) now determines the work: the material volume Les Brisants. When writing about the prose poem as composed by Edgar Allen Poe, Baudelaire made the following statement: "Dans le moulage de la prose appliqué la poésie, il y a nécessairement une affreuse imperfection/'8 I should like to suggest that the conjunction of the prose poem with the art print and the effect of this conjunction of two different systems of representation in one work, succeeds admirably insofar as it emphasizes the very essence of the prose poem as described by Baudelaire: une affreuse imperfection. In this sense, Miro's art print and Dupin's prose poem frame each other perfectly. Kent State University</page><page sequence="8">88 NOTES 1.
