<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Glass Pendant in the Shape of Harpokrates from Yavneh-Yam, Israel Moshe Fischer and Ruth E. Jackson-Tal DURING THE 1995 season of excavations at Yavneh-Yam, Israel,1 a glass pendant in the form of Harpokrates was found. Harpokrates is the Greek version of the Egyp tian word for "Horus the child." He is the son of the goddess Isis and the god Osiris, although he was represented with Isis and Serapis during the Hellenistic period. Horus is known from the end of the New Kingdom, but he became ex tremely popular in the Hellenistic and Roman periods.2 Yavneh-Yam (Iamneia-on-Sea), which is about equidistant (20 km) from Ioppe/Yafo and Azotus/Ashdod (Fig. 1), was the harbor of the inland town called Yavneh (Iamneia). Pliny the Elder mentions "the two towns Iamneia, one of them inland," in a list of towns in Palae stina.3 An almost complete list of coastal towns and their inland counterparts is provided by the Alexandrian geographer Ptolemy, including Ya|xvei/râ)v kip/py (the harbor of the people of Iamneia) between Ioppe/Yafo and Azotus/Ash dod.4 The pendant was found among the remains of a building unearthed in Area A, which had been violently destroyed and abandoned. Ma sonry covered with colored stucco gives some idea of the luxurious character of this building. Pottery (Fig. 2), glass artifacts, metal objects, and artistic items,5 most of which were imported from abroad, create the impression of a strong ly Hellenized and well-established society that became a victim of the struggle with the Mac cabees toward the end of the second century B.C.E. Stamped amphora handles, mainly from Rhodes, and coins of the Seleucid ruler Antio chus VII Sidetes (r. 138-129 B.C.E.) enable us to date this destruction to the days of the Hasmo nean ruler John Hyrcanus (r. 135-104 B.C.E.). As is related several times in 1 and 2 Maccabees, the Maccabean policy was a decidedly icono clastic one,6 and it seems to have been carried out in the case of Yavneh-Yam as well. Several figurai items that were found scattered around in the destruction layer are evidence of this. One of them was a mutilated marble head. The pendant (Fig. 3) is almost complete, but small pieces are missing from the base and head dress.7 It is made of translucent deep blue glass that is covered with thick black and silver lay ers of weathering, shiny iridescence, and pitting. The technique used to produce the pendant is well known. It was made in a two-piece mold that left vertical seam marks along the length 1. The excavations at Yavneh-Yam are directed by Moshe Fischer on behalf of the Department of Classics and the Insti tute of Archaeology at Tel Aviv University. Five seasons of ex cavations were carried out by the Yavneh-Yam Archaeological Project between 1992 and 1999, revealing remains from the late Bronze Age to the Middle Ages.

An unevenly rounded loop with a horizontal perforation (possibly drilled) is locat ed at the back of the figure, probably so that it could be placed in a necklace. The figure (H. 2.75 cm, W. [around hips] 0.7 cm) has protrud ing eyebrows, a wide nose, styled curls, and a peaked headdress. It stands in the usual pose, with a finger of the right hand below the mouth and the left hand alongside the body. The hands are not portrayed naturalistically, and there is no real depiction of the entire palm. The navel is large, and the male genitals are visible below it. The hips are wide, and the kneecaps are well defined. The feet, like the hands, are schematic, depicted only in contour, and the figure stands on a rounded podium. This object belongs to a well-known group of pendants defined as molded "full figure in the 36 round," a subtype of pendants "in the round." Spaer dates these pendants from the first cen tury B.C.E. to the first century C.E.8 They usu ally depict miniature figures of deities (Horus, Cybele, Hecate, Bes, and possibly Isis), squat ting female figures (Baubo), and three maids around a column, birds, and bunches of grapes.9 These pendants are widely distributed through out the Mediterranean and other areas, but most of them do not come from excavated con texts. There are a few examples from excavated sites in Israel, and one Baubo pendant was dis covered in an excavation at Ptolemais/'Akko.10 All of these pendants are very similar in design, and they are decorated with popular cult figures of the Hellenistic world. For this reason, it is plausible to suggest that they were made in one or a very few production centers. Barag cited the coast of Phoenicia as one possible provenance, and he believes that these pendants are part of the group of monochrome and colorless cast glass vessels and small objects of the second and first centuries B.C.E.11 Spaer notes that the pen dants may have originated in Egypt and the Ae gean.12 The choice of Egyptian and Oriental deities and the reputation of Alexandria as an important glassmaking center during the Hel lenistic period support the idea that these ob jects were produced in an Egyptian workshop. Similar glass pendants in the shape of Harpo krates were found in domestic contexts at De 8. Maud Spaer, Ancient Glass in the Israel Museum: Beads and Other Small Finds, Jerusalem: the museum, 2001, p. 162. Spaer distinguishes a subgroup of "full figure in the round" pen dants in a group of pendants "in the round." She dates the head shaped (e.g., Negro, bull, and theater masks) pendants from the second half of the second century to the first half of the first cen tury B.C.E., and the full-figure pendants (e.g., deities, animals, and fruit) from the first century B.C.E. to the first half of the first century C.E. 9. Dan Barag (Catalogue of Western Asiatic Glass in The British Museum, v. 1, London: British Museum Publications Ltd. in association with Magnes Press, Hebrew University, Je rusalem, 1985, p. 88) mentions 20 examples in the museum's Department of Greek and Roman Antiquities. Some of these objects, such as the Negro head pendant, do not belong to the "full figure in the round" pendant group. 10. Spaer [note 8], fig. 75. 11. Barag [note 9], no. 113. 12.

The context in which it was found represents the Hellenistic destruction layer at the site. This destruction is dated to the late second century B.C.E., and it is attributed to the conquest of the southern coastal plain by John Hyrcanus, which was completed about 110 B.C.E.
