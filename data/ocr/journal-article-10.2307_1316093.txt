<plain_text><page sequence="1">Peter McNeil 'Put Your Best Face Forward': The Impact of the Second World War on British Dress Introduction This paper examines aspects of the impact of the Second World War on British dress.1 Particular reference is made to the Civilian Clothing Order of 1942, laid down by the Board of Trade in order to regulate the manufacture and distribution of clothing to a wartime populace. Although wartime dress is generally discussed in terms of this 'Utility' scheme, surprisingly few details have been published regard- ing the mechanics of this process. In assessing the impact of Utility measures, I compare what the Board of Trade claimed it had achieved with what retailers, tailors, dressmakers, and the public thought of the state regulations, as preserved in the columns of the London Times. The Times is a particularly rich source for the study of dress in this period, the editor and columnists speculating on the nature of fashion as well as passing often-facetious comment on the unprecedented intervention of the state in this realm. It provides a convenient source of information concerning male attitudes to their dress, in a field which is dominated by the study of women's costume. Using contemporary representa- tions, particularly advertising, I go on to refute the suggestion that wartime restrictions and rationing resulted in a democratization of fashion; class seems to have been ever visible in both service and civilian dress during the period. Dress is also acknowledged to be the single most powerful marker of gender. During the war women undertook jobs which had traditionally been staked out as masculine, forcing a suspension of social conventions regarding dress and the adoption of sex-typed garments such as trousers and overalls. As the war drew to an end dress played an equally crucial role in the formation of social and sexual identity. In conjunction with the image of woman as consumer of the new household durables, dress played a powerful role in redefining woman as wife and mother rather than paid worker. Fashion History Social histories of wartime Britain pay attention to dress in the context of the new consumer restraint imposed by government regulation. Angus Calder's encyclopaedic The People's War: Britain 1939-45 (1969) forms the basis of much subsequent com- mentary, which reiterates many of his examples and quotations.2 Works including R. Minns' Bombers and Mash: The Domestic Front 1939-45 (1980) provide more detailed and satisfying descriptions of the disruption of dress codes during the Second World War than most fashion surveys, which tend to indulge in nostalgic evocation, and collapse Britons into one homogeneous mass.3 The field of 1940S fashion is dominated by folios released by the publishers of Vogue magazine. Rather than attempt- ing history, these books celebrate the glories of Vogue through the ages.4 James Laver's influential but antiquated theory of 'reflection' so common to traditional costume histories, the Zeitgeist model which argues the 'mood' of a period is reflected in dress, dominates these accounts.5 The simple equation of an austere dress mirroring an austere wartime period, suggested by both Hall and Probert, ignores the socio-political context, and in this case the unprecedented state regulation of dress.6 The stereotype of the period as dull and colourless is contradicted by anomalies including the female war- time hat, which remained a strident marker of gen- der. More recent cultural studies which have emerged from the strategies of feminism, semiotics, and psychoanalysis suggest alternative starting points for reading dress and have shifted the emphasis from chronological and stylistic analysis to the participation of dress in the social inscription of gender. Rather than trying to uncover 'real' women or expose the 'folly' of fashion, dress (and con- sequently gender) is revealed as performance, as fiction and artifice.7 The implication of this approach is that the binary structures which define male/ Journal of Design History Vol. 6 No. 4 ? 1993 The Design History Society 283</page><page sequence="2">female, masculinity/femininity are revealed as self- referential and arbitrary. Such theoretical studies employ strategies which can be applied in the analysis of dress of the 1940s and 195os, and there have also been published a number of theory-based case studies relevant to the period. Turim examines the female silhouette of the 1940s and 1950S popularized by Hollywood films.8 Evans and Thorn- ton extend Wilson's reconceptualization of the New Look's 'weirdly masculine' spikiness by reading this in terms of fetishism.9 Wright questions the widely accepted notion of the 1950S stiletto heel as symbolizing female subordination, suggesting instead that the wearing of the more extreme forms marked a transgression, was associated with bad girls rather than good mothers, and was fuelled by female-led consumer demand.10 To these questions I will return later in the paper. Second World War Dress: Regulation and Rationing After a year of restrictions which would later seem moderate, Britons faced in 1941 not only shortages and rationing but detailed centralized directives which affected the appearance of most consumer goods."1 The Mediterranean was closed and shipping severely disrupted by German attack, prompting the rationing of clothing in June of that year. Clothing costs rose an average of 175 per cent from pre-war levels in May 1941, necessitating price control in order to stop profiteering.12 More stringent regula- tion of dress followed the appointment of Sir Thomas Barlow as Director-General of Civilian Clothing in 1942. The Utility Apparel (Maximum Prices and Charges) Order came into force in the first week of February. 'Short of clothing everyone in a sort of "battle-dress", the scheme is believed to be the only way of effectively controlling prices', reported The Times.13 In changes announced on 17 March 1942, civilian adults found their number of coupons reduced by nearly o10 per cent to sixty per fourteen-month period, a reduction of 'about a quarter in coupon power'.14 By 1945 this had been further reduced to just forty-one coupons per year.15 An overcoat required sixteen to eighteen coupons, a shirt eight, underpants four.16 It meant in effect that a man might buy one pair of trousers every two years, a waistcoat every five.17 Throughout 1942 the Director-General of Civilian Clothing issued a spate of directives which reduced the amount of resources-fabrics, trimmings and labour-expended in the production of a garment. The fabrics themselves were rationalized, from a vast number to a specified range.18 These measures ended the effect of the quota system of the previous war years, within which manufacturers had tended to produce more expensive lines.19 The stated aim of these measures was to ensure that workers and factories were not 'occupied in non-essential work'.20 Some commentators welcomed the regulation as an appropriate 'rationalization' of dress; the state had achieved what dress reformers had attempted since the late nineteenth century. The Editor of The Times claimed that with these measures: The Director-General of Civilian Clothing strikes a blow at an error whch may go back to the gates of the Garden of Eden. . . The coming restrictions on the clothing of women and children offer one obvious occasion for rejoicing ... To discourage fuss and frippery ... is an ideal worth aiming at in times of scarcity in order to make it a rule when days of plenty return.21 The Clothing Board did not, however, concern itself with dress reform per se, but justified itself solely in terms of the war effort. Hugh Dalton, President of the Board of Trade, stated 'that the war-time activities of his department were very disagreeable in many ways their only justification was that they were necessary for the winning of the war'.22 The Clothing Board, then, did not fulfil the programme espoused a decade previously by the influential dress theorist J. C. Flilgel, whose The Psychology of Clothes (1930) made proposals which found echoes in wartime regulation. FlUigel had argued that a Ministry of Fashion be established to regulate the 'ethics of dress', taking into account 'hygiene, comfort, cost and beauty'.23 This would, he claimed, 'tend to improve the appearance of those who have little personal taste', destroy the 'socially disruptive element of competition', and 'abolish unnecessary expense'.24 His proposal must be read in the context of the 'ration- alization' and bureaucratization of society: 'The establishment of some such Board is in complete accordance with the general trend of the social and economic development of modern times', he wrote.25 The British government was not, however, interested in levelling society nor abolishing vanity, and 284 Peter McNeil</page><page sequence="3">Churchill was opposed to the sartorial austerity his advisers imposed.26 With the war effort as justification, the Board of Trade proceeded to reduce the number of models of all consumer goods, from umbrellas to saucepans.27 Innumerable committees and subcommittees were appointed to deal with every aspect of daily life. Panels 'representing sections of the clothing industry such as men's suits, overcoats, shirts, pyjamas, and house-hold overalls' were appointed, the bureau- cratic segmentation producing amusing titles such as the Director of Civilian Hosiery.28 These panels did not so much dictate how garments should appear as how they might not. On 30 April 1942, for instance, came the following directive: Women's and maids' dresses and blouses are to be simplified . . . The number of buttons, seams, and pleats, and the amount of ruching and gauging are strictly limited; no braid, embroidery or lace is to be used.29 From i June 1942, corset manufacturers were prohibited from the use of 'trimming, fancy stitch- ing, lace';30 the 'ruching, gauging and shirring of women's underwear' was similarly banned, as was the 'embroidery, scalloping and trimming of infant's clothes'.31 In May 1942, prominent British designers were invited to contribute models for a Utility Range which conformed to the austerity regulations. Members of the Incorporated Society of London Fashion Designers-Molyneux, Creed, Stiebel, Elspeth Champcommunal of Worth, Hardy Amies, Digby Morton, Bianca Mosca, and Peter Russell- completed a collection by September.32 Vogue reported positively that the collection included 'some of the most entirely wearable clothes we have ever seen'.33 The women's garments included a top-coat, suit, afternoon dress, and overall-dress. Most of the designs featured the boxy square shoulder line associated with this period. The amount of fabric allowed for a garment was strictly controlled, resulting in shorter skirts, and a reduction of pleats. The scheme was comparable to another of Fligel's ideas, that Clothing Boards would 'not so much replace the work of individual sartorial artists and designers as co-ordinate this work, and utilize it to the best advantage'.34 Sir Thomas Barlow felt that his Board had made history, describing the collection as 'the first Government commissioned clothes'.35 He neglected to mention J.-L. David's 'republican' costumes commissioned by the Convention in 1794,36 but unlike this precedent, the Utility garments of wartime Britain were actually worn by the populace, accounting for approximately four- fifths of total production.37 The impact of government regulation was severe on the clothing industry, resulting in major restruc- turing. In 1942 about 25,000 individual firms were engaged in the business, some very small.38 The Board of Trade directed supplies of Utility cloth to designated firms, such that by mid-1942 just 2000 firms were producing approximately 80 per cent of Utility garments.39 The Board of Trade seems to have policed its directives, making exemplary prosecu- tions which acted as a deterrent to those wishing to evade regulation. The 'Rich Silk Undies Company' was charged in 1942 for selling four times its quota of goods,40 and the press reported spies had been installed in retail stores to ensure that sales assistants took the appropriate coupons from cus- tomers.41 Masculinity at War Menswear in no way escaped wartime regulation. New restrictions dictated the width of trouser bottoms, and banned trouser turn-ups, elastic in waistbands, and zip fasteners.42 Pleats, fancy belts, metal or leather buttons, raglan sleeves, fancy backs, and tails were also banned.43 From May 1942, the manufacture of trousers for boys aged eleven to twelve was banned. In an article 'Shorts to the Short' the Editor of The Times noted facetiously: Almost every day the Board of Trade gives fresh evidence that nothing is beneath its notice or too small for its control . .. There may be grave troubles threatening adult men. What if the shorts age were raised from 12 to 90? Scoutmasters, mountain-climbers and their like would not object: but not all grown men have shapely calves.44 Whole garments were abolished, including the double-breasted suit. That the Clothing Board was not always successful nor practical in its regulations is suggested by criticisms published at the time. 'A retailer' noted that 'some of the restrictions have the appearance of bureaucratic ingenuity rather than the professional expertness of practical tailors'.45 The correspondent cited the directive concerning men's The Impact of the Second World War on British Dress 285</page><page sequence="4">trousers: 'It is a false economy to eliminate trouser turn-ups ... a truer economy would be to cut the trousers as narrow as consistent with comfort'.46 The directive could be avoided by buying a larger pair, or having a tailor make the legs too long, then turning them up at home.47 Other correspondents ques- tioned the efficacy of new regulations. When elastic in trousers was banned, it was claimed, 'Their complete elimination means that men who custom- arily wear flannel trousers may now have to buy braces or belts, both of which are made of scarce materials'.48 Potentially more interesting are the criticisms levelled at Sir Thomas Barlow which relate to male sartorial vanity rather than concern with the national cause. Despite the cliche of woman as the vain, fashion-driven consumer there is plenty of evidence to suggest that many men were equally alarmed regarding compulsory changes to their dress. This male reaction to wartime regulation supports and extends Hollander's assertion that despite the fact that 'masculine sartorial vanity has been a kind of secret, an influence largely unacknowledged ... plenty of actual male concern for fashion shows up constantly in personal memoirs and letters'.49 Changes to the wartime waistcoat-it was to have a maximum of two pockets, no collar, back-strap nor chain-hole-provoked a frenzy of complaint. One gent asserted that the restrictions were: aimed chiefly at us of maturer years ... It is only we, who, with the changes in profile which only too often appear with advancing years, rely on the back strap across the back of the waistcoat to preserve at least an appearance of fit in that difficult garment. Surely these two concessions to the deterioration of later middle age are not the cause of so much waste of textile material.50 The Editor of The Times once again could not resist comment, describing the 'sleeveless, backless, skimpy-let us resist the temptation to say strait jacket, which is a compulsory or utility waistcoat'.51 By March 1942 several Members of Parliament voiced the 'serious dissatisfaction the regulations were causing to business and professional men'.52 Waistcoat reform seems to have seized the popular imagination. A patriotic advertisement beseeching the nation to make economies for the war effort depicted a young boy pointing at the waistcoat button of a corpulent gent, smoking a cigar in an armchair: Pray, what is the reason of that? It has taken a war and an Act of Parliament to remove the waistcoat button from its traditional idleness. Searching minds are likewise demol- ishing tradition with the vital question-'Why do we go on doing that?'53 Enforced changes to dress played a role in the disruption of other social customs during the war. The Board of Trade asked the Archbishop of Canterbury to announce that women might attend service hatless and stockingless, without risking decorum.54 Some of the formality previously evident seems to have disappeared: 'They're much more casual, socially, in London. Nothing is fixed up ahead-they wear anything', reported Vogue.55 Simi- larly, Cecil Beaton wrote that at the Dorchester 'some dress-some don't-some wear hats, some don't'.56 The traditional triad of hat, shoes and gloves did not, however, disappear. Stockings were eagerly sought, and when none was available, alternatives were found, such as the garish knitted variety illustrated in a wartime issue of Stitchcraft [1].57 Marshall &amp; Snelgrove held a 'Stocking, Shoe and Glove Week', describing them as 'essential items of every woman's wardrobe'.58 The wedding trousseau, was, however, severely depleted. In May 1942, stores advised that 'now is your last chance to buy lovely lace-trimmed lingerie-no more is to be made after June i'.59 Dress and Exclusivity Although all British citizens were technically bound by the same coupon restrictions, in no way was a uniformity of dress imposed across classes. Despite propaganda and subsequent nostalgic claims that social distinctions were suspended in the name of the war effort, dress remained very much a signifier of status, in both service and civilian contexts.60 Perhaps to boost morale, the censor did not restrict photographs appearing in popular magazines of fashionable West End life, which included elegant women under the hair-dryer in bomb shelters.61 Restaurant food, which did not require coupons, was available to those of means.62 Hotels such as the Savoy and the Dorchester converted basement rooms to comfortable shelters, a marked contrast to the crowded and squalid conditions many London- ers endured.63 Vogue magazine published tales of upper-class life in these shelters, a corollary to the 286 Peter McNeil</page><page sequence="5">i -= ......... in 1939: 'They shelter in the Ritz super-cellars in satin or wool pyjamas ... (Molyneux or Piguet); They market in Schiaparelli's pouch-pocket suits' [2]64 Advertisements for the more exclusive London stores stressed the theme that 'Never had quality counted as much as it does today', as the purse alone no longer provided the power to buy.61 This was indeed the case; for the same number of coupons, but for a very different price, one could purchase a cardigan or a silver fox wrap.66 Similarly, for the same number of coupons but a vastly different price one could purchase a Utility coat or one trimmed with mink.67 An advertisement for a fur company poked snobbish fun at the Utility clothes the masses were forced to don, the phrase 'articles of futility' surely punning on 'utility' clothing: 'Not upon fugitive "articles of futility' may we dissipate our precious coupons. In the beauty and utility of furs vou will find maximum coupon values-and aes- yuwilfinaiu cou:. vaus:n ae- 2 Eric, 'They shelter in the Ritz super-cellars in satin and wool pyjamas by Molyneux or Piguet', Paris, 1939, published by British Vogue, December 1939, p. 38 thetic satisfaction'.68 Government surveys discov- ered that the richer segment of the community had increased their wardrobes during the war, possibly as their pre-war garments were of better quality, lasted longer, and could be more easily patched.69 Coupon pointing on lower-grade clothes was thus reduced in 1943.70 The role of dress as a signifier of upper-middle- class status extended also to the services. Class differences in uniform were not so pronounced as in earlier periods, but they by no means disappeared.71 Photographs of titled women engaged in war work reveal exquisitely cut garments, obviously hand- tailored [3].72 Servicemen and women were not dressed by the one government source; the style of garment might be the same but the styling-fabric, cut, and fit-was different. Regent Street tailors, Harrods, and Burberry regularly advertised their outfitting services for those of means [4]. 'Every woman knows-There's a world of difference between being in uniform, and wearing a uniform that fits you like your smartest tweeds'.73 Similarly, 'When we make a uniform we like to leave an officer feeling as comfortable as he remembers having been in one of our lounge suits'.74 The privileged status of the audience for these advertisements is obvious. As The Impact of the Second World War on British Dress 287</page><page sequence="6">3 'On active service in the early part of World War II': the Duke and Duchess of Windsor in France Berger argued in his perceptive analysis of male dress, the cut of suits or uniforms, 'far from disguis- ing the social class of those who wore them, underlined and emphasised it'.75 Women and Work Advertisements for women's uniforms are revealing in their construction of the wartime working woman. Austin Reed claimed to make for the servicewoman: A uniform in which you can have every confidence that you look as well from the back as from the front. In which you know that the shoulder line, while soldierly, is still not aggressively masculine, and that the skirt neither bags nor sags.76 Whereas the Austin Reed advertisements for men's uniforms concern themselves with presence and power, the women's were concerned with maintain- power, the women's were concerned with maintain- Uniform Supremacy.

The first wartime edition of British Vogue had cautioned, 'It would be an added calamity if war turned us into a nation of frights and slovens'77 Make-up and hairstyles were frequently commented upon in order to assert that service- women were in no way masculinized.78 Cyclax released 'Auxiliary Red' lipstick, available in a reported in 1941: The Wren has a serenity, even a faint austerity...

By 1943 three million married women were working, more than double the pre-war figure; 57 per cent of the workforce was female.82 Women of all trades, between twenty and thirty years old, could be directed into factories. Women who had previously worked as maids, nannies, typists or hairdressers became welders, shipbuilders, mechanics, gasfitters, providing the same services but receiving wages up to half those of their male colleagues. Women's wholesale adoption of overalls, dungarees, and trousers for safety and practicality provoked indig- nation from sections of the community, who argued that women might become mannish and slovenly [6- 7].83 Vogue noted tersely: 'We deplore the crop of young women who take war as an excuse for letting their back hair down and parading about in slacks. Slack, we think, is the word'.84 The physical appearance of factory women was often focused upon, as if to defuse the threat of masculinized women."5 Magazines and advertisers of clothing and beauty products, all of which were subject to censorship and government surveillance, went so far as to posit fashion as part of the war effort for women during the war-'this business of looking beautiful is definitely a duty', argued an editorial in Vogue.86 'War or no war, you must look your best' became the slogan of the Corot dress company,87 while Yardley continued the 'Put your Best Face Forward' campaign. 'We must remember that the slightest hint of a drooping spirit yields a point to the enemy ... Face value is more than ever high' ran the slogan.88 It was in this context that the 'Make do and Mend' campaigns played the important role of ....' ........ ... 6 Victor Stewart, 'Mrs E.

The 'Mrs Sew &amp; Sew' poster campaign admonished women to save resources, and magazines advised how to make everything from knitted handbags to crocheted necklaces. The Female Consumer The efforts of Sir Thomas Barlow and the Board of Trade to reduce spending were somewhat thwarted, however, by the activities of organizations like the British Colour Council. Barlow had been highly critical of seasonal colour changes.for fashionable dress, but the Colour Council continued to dangle new ranges before the British public. Of their 1942 spring/summer display, patriotically entitled 'Colours of the English Countryside', it was reported: Bluish-green caravan green looks particularly attractive in fibro-mixture utility dress fabrics ... the ensemble could be completed with hosiery in a shade named dryad ... Hosiery in sunny tanglo blends smoothly with harness tan for shoes and mellow gold for gloves.89 Hats, too, remained elaborate during the war. Although heavily taxed, their production was unregulated and unrationed, possibly as they did not require large amounts of fabric.90 A 'sailor's wife', writing to The Times in 1942, pointed out the anomaly that whilst the government was trying to save resources, 'We women are still invited to buy luxurious accessories to our clothing such as hats priced at several pounds'.91 Despite Longmate's claim that 'to wear one [a hat] became regarded almost as a sign of unpatriotic frivolity', there is plenty of evidence that women continued to sport hats.92 If luxury materials were not available, improvization was suggested using paper and fabric scraps, even dyed knickers [8].93 That the, wartime hat achieved a sexual mystique is apparent in a 8- .Make Yoursel - Summer.

Contradictory messages were aimed at the British consumer during the war. Whilst retailers attempted to release new lines to encourage spending, state propaganda and a steadily rising tax-base demanded moderation.94 Many of the exhortations to save position woman as culprit, playing on the cultural conventions which described the consumer as a fashion-hungry, impulse-driven female.95 An adver- tisement released at the time of the 1942 clothing regulations depicts a portly fur-clad matron reaching for a parcel entitled 'Things You Can Do Without'. .,.o I,. . . .IF::: , AVE RUN THE RISK, GET SKILLED TREATMENT w if:OS TpEATMENT IS FREE AND CONFItENTIAL 9 VD warning poster, 1940s, British The caption reads 'No!

Self-indulgence takes many a traitorous guise'.97 This conflation of spending, temptation, and indulgence with the female con- sumer was a stock-in-trade of sales psychology in the inter-war period.98 The Couture In the context of enforced shortages and austerity concerning their dress Britons must have felt -IitJ 10 'No!

The British government was aware of the potential export earnings of London couture after the fall of Paris and its removal from the world fashion stakes. The Studio reported: Sadly enough the artistic rapture of Paris is no more ... its brilliance is gone ... the eyes of the world are focused on London with her dignified acceptance of war conditions.9" With continued legal access to luxury fabrics British designers began to present joint collections, sending their first collections to South America in 1941. If luxury was permissible in clothing designed for the export industry, it was incompatible with patriotism at home. Even the fashion parade at which the designer-Utility clothes were launched attempted to distance itself from the opulent salon image the fashion industry fostered in the 1930s. Utility parades provided instead the opportunity for propa- ganda concerning war work for women. It was made clear in publicity that the mannequins were war- workers who had given their time voluntarily.""' Pat- riotism invaded even dress fabrics. Cresta produced a Country Life print, on which 'happy little evacuees were shown among cottages and animals'.''l An Australian magazine featured a fabric, probably Brit- ish, patterned with tiny crowns spelling 'England'.''2 The trade advantages of a co-operative British effort began to outweigh individual house rivalry, with the Incorported Society of London Fashion Designers co-operating on the Utility range in 1942, and organ- izing joint parades after the war.''3 The United States similarly took advantage of the fall of Paris to streng- then its couture industry.'04 Paris, however, swiftly regained supremacy as the image-making centre of the world. As early as September 1945 the French sent fashion exhibits abroad. Models were not sent at first, but rather wire mannequins, dressed with accessories, recalling the eighteenth-century pattern of fashion distribution, in which modistes dressed dolls and fowarded them throughout Europe.1'5 Demobilization/Remobilization of Femininity As the war ended an emphasis on presenting a feminine image came to the fore. Vogue presented a 'demobilisation wardrobe' and most of the fashion advertisements of the period revolve around this theme.1"6 Ferguson's frocks devised a series of advertisements with the headline transformation: 'Off with the manly jacket, on with the frilly, feminine, and Ferguson lingerie'.107 The illustrations depict women in lingerie and figure-hugging dresses, their uniforms cast aside on chair-backs [11]. In casting aside the uniform women symbolic- ally pass from one role as worker and patriot to that of feminine home-maker. The ideal of femininity was promised not only through commodities related to self-adornment, but also those connected with the care of home and family. The spate of advertisements for consumer durables which appeared in the immediate post-war period repositioned women away from a role in the ` s ?'..'^'* * . ^.' " . J l / .

'Main' gas cookers pursued the following campaign: She used the finest equipment in war-She wants the best equipment in peace. The girl who learned about engineer- ing during the war is going to be critical over the equip- ment, especially the cooker.'08 The Electricity Board employed a similar theme: Does that doorway lead to a haven of cosy warmth and comfort-to spotless sparkling rooms and an all-electric kitchen which makes cooking, yes and even cleaning, a positive pleasure?109 The popular dress style of the immediate post-war period is exemplified by Dior's New Look; released in 1947 the collection established the Christian Dior empire and had many imitators. Part of the immediate appeal of these garments lay in the abundance, the excess, of the fabric and labour invested in them. The 1947 collection included day- dresses which employed large amounts of pleated silk emerging from already full coat-skirts, and evening-wear which revelled in vast swathes of luxurious fabrics with crinolines and underskirts.110 By the end of the decade elaborate hand-embroidery imitated eighteenth-century motifs, with all their exclusive and aristocratic connotations.11 The gar- ments played on certain 'feminine roles' (the princess, the bride, the debutante), but what is most startling is the way in which the female body was actually re-formed by the garments. Vogue described the dress of this period in terms of the replacement of the (false) masculine silhouette with the 'real' woman beneath: it was 'manifestly inspired by woman's true form in a renewed avowal of feminin- ity ... tight little waists ... rounded, almost Rubens- rounded hips'.ll2 In the iconic photograph of Charles James gowns reproduced in American Vogue, June 1948, Cecil Beaton manipulated the sculptural qualities of the garments (the gowns appear as crisply 'carved' as the room's boiseries) which exist independently of the women [12]. The structure of these clothes was so elaborate that many of the garments could support themselves. Built-in linings, corsetry, and boning constricted the waist, padded the hips, and manipulated the bust. Vogue described the new waspie corset in anthropomorphic terms: a suport with 'veins of tiny wires and delicate bones ... a wholly new way to let a woman look like a woman'. 113 Evans' and Thornton's suggestion that the New Look be read in terms of fetishism provokes consideration of some of the most popular post-war garments-the stiletto and gloves, particularly long evening-gloves-with their connotations of the fetish, coupled with entry and insertion.114 The representations of high-fashion photography, exem- plified by the work of Cecil Beaton, Louise Dahl- Wolfe, and Irving Penn, reinforced these associations, depicting gesturing, theatrical women whose bodies emerge from figure-hugging sheaths, draw on gloves or insert their feet in impossibly pointed-shoes [13-14].15 Dahl-Wolfe's study of Mary Jane Russell in a Dior dress is unusual, in that it admits a place for the female spectator/voyeur. Two maids or attendants peer around the screen, unobserved, at the very moment the object com- pletes her dressing by drawing on her glove to full length. More typical of the post-war period was Beaton's practice, which became more fashionable than ever. His image of the brittle 'made-up' woman with elaborate props and baroque gesture became the beautiful ideal of the 1950S fashion magazines.116 Dressed to Thrill That dress contributes to the visual form of the idea 'woman' is generally accepted; the question 'for whom do women dress?' is more problematic. Herzog argues the answers would 'break down around lines of gender, social class, and sexual preference ... actual experience may be at odds with commonsense notions of heterosexual attraction'.17 For many women the New Look must have spelled pleasure after the enforced restrictions of war-time; fashion historians certainly argue it was overwhelm- ingly popular.118 Oral histories indicate the power of post-war dress, in its fullness and newness, to evoke sensual and satisfied recollections.19 More detailed research is required to assess the impact and reception of the New Look in its various inter- national manifestations. This is currently proceeding in a number of regional contexts, including North America, Canada, and Australia.120 There were objections to the new style, however, which revolved around issues of waste and extravagance and the restoration of pre-war social conventions.

To replace a complete outfit would require more coupons than the client ... and country can afford'.'2' The New Look was also a style which did not fit all figure types; the style was difficult to reproduce with the poor-quality and scarce materials available in the post-war period, and rendered complete wardrobes unfashionable. As rationing did not cease until 1953, there were many women who were forced to match a fashionable long skirt with a dowdy, older short coat. Conclusion In a surprising article published in Vogue in 1944 Lesley Blanch noted that the end of war marked women's 'big chance to get what they want from the New Order. Let's hope they don't pass it up in a temporary fit of floosie femininity ... one on which, we feel, the more reactionary forces are counting'.'22 A study of wartime dress is crucial in unravelling what Honey has described as 'the great puzzle of the 1940s', that is the return to a domestic ideal after so many women had experienced paid employment.'23 The post-war ultra-feminine ideal, exemplified by the fashion photography of Cecil Beaton and Irving Penn, and the Hollywood melodramas starring 294 Peter McNeil</page><page sequence="13">L ARL 13 Louise Dahl-Wolfe, fashion photograph Grace Kelly and Elizabeth Taylor (A Date with Judy, 1947; Father of the Bride, 1950; A Place in the Sun, 1951) was spawned by a crisis that had required radical revision of traditional values. Women's entry into the workforce during the war years had been presented as patriotic, a woman's duty for the war effort. Although the domestic ideal was never entirely abandoned, even women with children over the age of fourteen were expected to register for employment in wartime, and women were discour- aged from the type of meticulous housework which was exacted before the war.'24 Women's achieve- ments in the factories was presented favourably, with work-targets obtained frequently exceeding those of men. With 'normal' male/female relation- ships often suspended because of the war, women's networks and friendships were accorded new promi- nence.125 When the war ended, the Control of Employment Act of 1945 ensured that demobilized women took second place at the Labour Exchange, and equitable wages were not reached for many years.26 The 14 Erwin Blumenfeld, Marlene Dietrich, C.1950 National Union of Mineworkers argued that women should be excluded from hard work in their industry on the basis that it was 'unfeminine'.127 Despite the fact that 22 per cent of women worked in 1951, compared to o1 per cent in 1931,128 advertisers deployed women dressed in the New Look to sell consumer goods, disguising work as 'decorative romance ... [promoting] the myth that housework was not real labour'.129 But what role did the garments play in rearticulating the deployment of 'femininity'? Several feminist writers have pointed to the danger of designating particular garments or behaviours as repressive, and instead indicate the subversive potential of exaggerated signs of femininity, stiletto The Impact of the Second World War on British Dress 295</page><page sequence="14">heels, and make-up, for instance.130 The issue of class is at play here, as these strategies might not be available to middle-class women. Finally, Gaines argues that feminist theory 'must be generous enough to accommodate another possibility-that the most constricting modes of dress might lead women to make erotic discoveries about their own bodies'.131 These are challenging issues, which the 'survey' fashion history focused on 'style' cannot accom- modate. All would agree, however, that the garments associated with the New Look were undoubtedly charged 'feminine', defining 'woman' symbolically in terms of an idealized hour-glass body with the emphasis on breasts and hips. This construction of woman refocused attention on her sexual and reproductive capacities, despite the fact that the 'career girl' was a possibility now gaining momentum.

In the pre-war period movie stars such as Garbo and Dietrich generated amazed headlines in the press when they appeared publicly in trousers. Faderman argues that the war contributed to the formation of an American lesbian dress; women in large numbers were obliged to wear trousers in factory jobs during the war, and in the post-war period trousers became a costume and symbol for lesbian identification.
