<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE ADAPTIVE TECHNOLOGY OF THE PREHISTORIC INHABITANTS OF SOUTHWEST TEXAS by Harry J. Shafer ABSTRACT A model of the middle Archaic adaptations in the lower Pecos River area of southwest Texas is presented. Working within excellent temporal and spatial frameworks and using the results of ethno botanical, ethnozoological and dietary studies, the adaptive efficiency of the ancient .technology is examined. A basically unchanged adaptive continuum prevailed in the area for approximately 8000 years. The conservatism and longevity seen in the adaptation centered significantly on the early and continued exploitation of perennial desert succulents sucH as sotol, lechuguilla and yucca both as food and raw material sources. INTRODUCTION The purpose of this paper is to provide a model of the prehistoric Archaic adaptations in the lower Pecos region of Texas. The adaptive model presented in the text is not intended to be exhaustive, but rather is based on what is generally known or predictable. A brief description is provided of the natural setting, cultural history and paleoenvironment in order to examine the geographic and natural context in an effort to define the plant, animal and mineral resource potential for the region. The question of how the various resources were used is partly answered by the excellent preservation of organic materials in the numerous dry rockshelters in the lime stone canyons. Careful excavations and extensive and intensive analyses of these materials in recent years have yielded an excellent body of information on the econom ic patterns of the Archaic populations. The prehistory of the lower Pecos region can be traced back to the terminal stages of the last major glacial period, perhaps to about 14,000 years ago when populations of now extinct Pleistocene fauna still inhabited the area. There is some indication that these big game animals were the prey of the first human groups to appear in the region based on findings at sites such as Bonfire Shelter (Dibble and Lorraine 1968) and possibly at 41 VV 162A (Johnson 1978). It is doubtful that such populations could be considered as resident inhabitants since their existence is represented by a mere trace of evidence and not all of that is convincing. More likely, if human groups were here at that early time, they were migrant bands whose movements were probably dictated in part by the migratory patterns of the large game animals which were among those being hunted. About 9,500 years ago, small bands of foraging groups began to settle in the deeply entrenched canyon system of the lower Pecos, Devil's and Rio Grande Rivers (Fig. 1). This region afforded ample opportunities for sheltered camping places, permanent water and sufficient plant, animal and mineral resources to support a hunting and gathering adaptation. The groups were able to establish a year-round residency following a semi nomadic adaptive pattern within a specific territory. Our best evidence for the initiation of this long sequence of foraging adaptations ? or perhaps an adaptive continuum ?comes from Hinds Cave (Shafer and Bryant 1977; Shafer 1978), Baker Cave (Hester 1977), Devil's Mouth Site (Johnson 1964) and Devil's 129</page><page sequence="2">/&lt;g?t)} "^--CROCKETT r eilTT... /^sSHj^^_J- _ ^ SUTTON TERRELL j ) ^ EDWARDS \ I I V \ VAL VERDE i \ ; ^ ! j MEXICO ^^^Of^-- [ \ \s ^^^J^^^C j KINNEY TEXAS^j ^^Vw f ^ LOWER PECOS AREA Figure 1.

Rockshelter (Prewitt 1966) while such sites as Eagle Cave (Ross 1965), Fate Bell Shelter (Parsons 1965), Arenosa Shelter (Dibble 1967) and Conejo Shelter (Alexander 1974), to gether with the previously listed sites, attest to the longevity of the lifeway. Although the end of this adaptive continu um came with the disappearance of the native Indian groups during the Spanish Colonial period, shifts in the exploitation of certain economic resources may have occurred during brief climatic intervals. The ultimate impact of these changes did not significantly alter the general adaptive pattern. There is archaeological and palynological evidence for a brief climatic interval about 750 B.C. that was accompanied by an incursion of bison into the area (Dibble and Lorraine 1967; Bryant and Shafer 1977). The introduction of the bow and arrow at about A.D. 1000 also did not appreciably alter the foraging lifeway although it may have had an impact on the game procurement patterns. Natural Environment The climate is semi-arid with an average annual rainfall varying from 12 to 18 inches across the area. The lower Pecos landscape is composed of exposed Cretaceous limestone forming the dissected topography of the Edwards Plateau (Fig. 2). The Pecos, Devil's and Rio Grande canyons are dominant features but their many small to large tributary canyon systems resulted in a rugged terrain with a steep gradient. The limestone is faulted causing many cracks and fissures which often direct the runoff and the directions of canyons themselves. The canyons are mostly dry and carry water only during times of heavy rain. As a result, permanent water is mostly confined to the river canyons, save an 130</page><page sequence="3">Figure 2. View of a tributary^canyon of the Pecos River illustrating the topography and limestone exposures in the lower Pecos region. infrequent solution pothole (tinaja) or spring. Several of the lower tributary canyons have beautiful springs even today and some of these are reliable during the driest years. Water may become available during short periods in the upper tributary canyons as a result of a localized rainstorm and some of the potholes will retain water for several weeks before eventually drying up. The riverine zone was most crucial to the foragers; many sheltered locations occur along the streams and the riverine environ ment provided the habitat for shell fish (albeit in limited quantity), fish, aquatic mammals, grasses, reeds and possibly other now extinct aquatic plants; willows, oaks, and other economically important plants grew along the banks and alluvial terraces. On the canyon slopes overlooking the rivers and tributary canyons are found the common desert succulents such as yucca, lechuguilla, sotol, prickly pear and other edible cactus plants as well as mesquite, mountain laurel, buckeye and coyotillo. The dry canyon floors often display a dense belt of vegetation including oak, walnut, persimmon, mesquite, occa sionally grapes, mountain laurel, Mexican buckeye and other woody plants. The uplands provided these same plants although in a more stunted form along with hackberry, the above mentioned succulents, and various grasses. Small and medium-sized animals occupied their respective habitats among the rocks and vegetation in the canyons, slopes and uplands as well. These animals include various rats, mice, snakes, lizards, rabbits, Figure 3. View of Hinds Cave, a large dry rockshelter in the Pecos River drainage. squirrels and badgers. Mineral resources were sufficiently abun dant to provide the basic needs; for example, limestone was readily available for use as a heat conductor in cooking; cherts, available in each large canyon and in numerous upland locations, were used for the manufacture of stone tools; other minerals such as hematite and limonite were locally found for use as paint pigments. Salt is not present in natural form so far as we know but may have been secured in adequate amounts from meat and water sources. Paleoenvironment Studies of the paleoenvironment of Texas have recently been summarized by Bryant and Shafer (1977) and in the lower Pecos region by Dering (1978, 1979). Dering's study is most pertinent since it incorporates both fossil pollen and plant macrofossil studies from Hinds Cave (Fig. 3). The interesting finding from these studies is that the same comple ment of plants present today was present 9,500 years ago although the frequency of certain plants and the configuration of certain plant communities has obviously changed. There is some evidence of minor climatic shift about 2,500 years ago (Bryant and Shafer 1977) which may have had significant influences on the local adaptations but this was seemingly short-lived and the desert oriented foraging lifeway persisted. The important thing to note here is the onset of marginal desert conditions at the end of the 131</page><page sequence="4">Pleistocene and the persistency of these conditions. Given this, any minor changes in the human adaptive patterns would not be predictably caused by a change in the environment. Archaic Socio-economic Patterns Site distribution studies by Jan Dymond (Ms.) have shown that the riverine zone was the scene of most intensive human activity. The construction of specialized preparation areas such as rock pavement hearths and crescent, ring-shaped and dome-shaped burned rock middens in the dry tributary canyons and uplands along the plateau margins indicate periodic uses of the canyon and upland resources in their adaptive regimes. Recent excavations of burned rock mid dens in the lower Pecos area have shown them to be earth ovens utilized for processing desert succulents such as Agave lecheguilla and Dasylirion sp. (Dering 1977). As one moves up the Pecos River in the area of Crockett, Terrell and Pecos counties, the crescent and ring-shaped burned rock mid dens become more frequent on the landscape and may occur virtually anywhere the conditions are present for a depression to be dug in the proximity of limestone and fuel. These distinctive burned rock middens are relatively late in the prehistoric sequence, dating generally after A.D. 600 (Shafer 1970). Since the first published reports in the area, archaeologists have emphasized the hunting and gathering pattern of the lower Pecos Archaic. The conservatism displayed in this adaptive pattern has been emphasized by Taylor (1964), Johnson (1967), Kirkland and Newcomb (1967:37-80), Alexander (1974) and Shafer and Bryant (1977). Johnson's (1967) notion of this conserva tism was strengthened by the results of his cluster analysis study carried out with artifact collections from southwest Texas and central Texas sites. He noted that southwest Texas artifact forms showed less change and hypothesized that a simple but efficient economic adjustment to the harsh southwest ern desert was achieved at an early date. He felt that limited resources in the area provided little possibility for economic change so long as the economy was based on hunting and gathering. He further suggests that this stability would be mirrored in the temporal uniformity of the artifact collection if the variation in artifact forms was a reflection on their different functions. Another hypothesis Johnson proposed was that the temporal changes in artifact collections may not reflect functional changes in the lithic artifacts as suggested above, but rather stylistic changes caused by influence from other areas or by actual immigration. He postulates that southwest Texas was less susceptible to outside contacts than central Texas because of its more stringent environ ment. According to Johnson greater temporal stability of artifact collections in southwest Texas reflect this lack of regional intercourse. He cites Taylor's (1964) notion of tethered nomadism and notes that the concentration of water in the lower Pecos would limit population size as much as conditions prevailing in northern Coahuila. A major error exists with Johnson's cluster analysis study because he relied heavily on the artifact distribution from Coontail Spin Rock shelter which had badly mixed deposits. If such a cluster analysis study were applied to the data from Arenosa Shelter (Dibble 1967) and Hinds Cave (Shafer and Bryant 1977) which were not available to him, a greater degree of variation may have been revealed. Although methods that Johnson used may not have been applicable given his data base, his general hypothesis that a simple but efficient economic adjustment to the desert was achieved at an early date and that temporal changes may not reflect functional changes in the lithic artifacts is acceptable. There is indeed a marked continuity of stone tools other than projectile point styles and their associated bifacing systems. Johnson (1967:77) goes on to speculate that as a result of such features as restricted distribution of water, lower protein resources, etc., the populations in southwest Texas would need large tracts of land whose food sources could be relied on, and the size of any group would be restricted by the resources of the desert land which could be covered by round-trip travel from living sites. He suggests that the number of bands and the total population would be small since only the land near the river could be effectively exploited. The groups would be "tethered" to the river 132</page><page sequence="5">and their mobility along the valleys would be restricted by the preemption of living sites and adjacent food resources. According to John son these scanty resources would offer little temptation to outsiders. Territorial Considerations Given that hunters and gatherers generally exploit a specific territory which is intimate ly known to them and for which they claim ownership (Lee and DeVore 1968:3-12; Hester and Grady 1977), archaeologists must seek ways of determining the territorial catchment of the population they are studying. Until this is done, archaeologists will always be working with a severe handicap by not having some control on the spatial distribution of -the resources available to the ancient popula tions, especially in formulating and testing settlement pattern models. Archaeologists have for some time recog nized the geographic distribution of certain projectile point forms as evidenced by such archaeological constructs as the Pecos River Focus (Suhm, Krieger and Jelks 1954:52-56). Formal characteristics of artifacts which may be termed stylistic could indicate socially recognized symbols indicative of a particular group. Binford (1962:219) has noted that formal characteristics which can be termed stylistic include formal qualities "believed to have their primary functional context in providing a symbolically diverse yet pervasive artifactual environment promoting group solidarity and serving as a basis for group awareness and identity." One of the main functions of the arts as communication in primitive society is to reinforce belief, custom and values (Beals and Hoijer 1953:548). The distribution of the lower Pecos rock art motifs termed the Pecos River style has been noted by Newcomb (Kirkland and Newcomb 1967:37-80) and Shafer (1977). I have argued (Shafer 1977) that the geographic distribution of the Pecos River Style marks the territory of most intensive activity (or "home range") of a group of linguistically related bands (Fig. 1). Two characteristics of the lower Pecos art which are common for any primitive art style Support this hypothesis: the first characteris tic is the restricted geographic range noted previously and the second is the apparent long lasting tradition of a conservative style (see Shafer 1977 for age estimates of the Pecos River style). A dominant motif in the lower Pecos art style is an anthropomorphic figure commonly seen facing the viewer but infrequently shown in profile. This figure, described by Newcomb (Kirkland and Newcomb 1967:46) as a shaman motif, is embellished usually with red, black, yellow and even white colors and is character istically holding an atlatl attached to a spear in the right hand and having tassels or other accouterments attached to the arms. Poly chrome zoomorphic and abstract symbols also occur in this style. The distributional range of the Pecos River art style covers an area of about 100 miles square encompassing the lower canyons of the Pecos, Devil's and along the Rio Grande from just above Langtry to near Del Rio, from just south of the Rio Grande to the northeastern border of Terrell County, and up the Devil's Canyon to Carter Valley. Primitive artists typically pictured ghosts, gods and demons in anthropomorphic and zoomorphic forms that occurred within their world (Shafer 1977). The world as seen by the lower Pecos Archaic peoples was doubtfully more than 200 miles across if the distinctive material culture styles and art styles mark the area of most intensive settlement; the spirit beings would expectedly take on the real or hallucinated shapes of the beings that lived in that world. Though we see some resem blances to the real world in their art, there is by no means any way of identifying the meanings of the symbols nor can we be sure of the social context in which the art was created. The meanings of those symbols died with their prehistoric audience but we can use their uniqueness of design as an indicator of the geographic range of their artistic creators. Assuming that the above hypothesized territory has some measure of validity, we can use it as a working known in space as we have used the paleo-environment as a working known in time to measure cultural continuity and change. I might add that the distribution of certain basketry and sandal types parallels this proposed territorial range (J. Adovasio personal communication). Resources Diversity The geographic region in question has an 133</page><page sequence="6">apparent monotony when viewed from a resource perspective. It is confined to the limestone plateau and canyon systems and is dominated by only two basic ecological zones, the riverine and the slope/upland zone. We have already noted the redundancy of plant and animal resources outside of the riverine zone. How then could foragers subsist for thousands of years in an environ ment that offers such an apparent low resource diversity? The key toward answering this question is not so much the necessity of a great diversity of plant and animal resources but in the availability of such resources and how efficiently they are utilized. Seasonal plants such as prickly pear fruit, walnuts, persimmons, acorns, mesquite beans, etc. are the first to attract our attention in terms of edible foods. Important though they were, these were not the foods that carried the people through a 12 month cycle. While the resource diversity was low by most standards, the critical plant resources were bulky, but available over most of the landscape at any time of the year.These desert succulents are lechuguilla, sotol, and prickly pear "leaves." Seasonality While the nomadism of the resident groups is exemplified by the intermittent use of sheltered locations and open campsites, the problem with determining how long one site was occupied during what season remains. Bryant (1974), Dering and Shafer (1976), Alexander (1974) and Williams-Dean (1978) have all addressed the seasonality issue and despite the remarkedly well preserved depos its in some sites, it is not so easily resolved as one might guess. Alexander (1974) tried to correlate the occupational lenses in dry caves with the maturation of fruiting of plants present using checklist type references. Dering and Shafer (1977) have pointed out that plant behavior is determined by such factors as temperature, moisture and amount of sunlight and these critical conditions could result in certain plants flowering anytime between March and November. Dering (1979) and Williams-Dean (1978) have documented a very erratic behavior pattern for plants in the lower Pecos to the extent that only two broad seasons are evident, a warm season and a cool season. Furthermore, many of the economically useful desert plants do not indicate even this seasonality and it is these plants that compose the bulk of the archaeo logical deposits. At Hinds Cave, Williams Dean (1978:254), using seasonal indicators from a coprolite sample, confidently deter mined that the time of deposit for the Early Archaic latrine she?, was studying was during the warm season. Because of the differential behavior of the desert plants and the rainfall characteristics of the area, I do not think that strict seasonal scheduling was followed. We have an excellent list of economic plants and animal resources and can hypothesize that bulky desert succulents were exploited extensively; certainly these were used during the cool season but probably not exclusively at that time. Acorns, walnuts, and in the Devil's River area, pecans potentially provided cool season resources, depending upon the rela tive yield each year. As warmer temperatures began to trend in February, March and April, yucca flowers are among the first to appear. As other succulents bloom, these too were utilized. Wild onion, edible forbs, prickly pear fruit, mesquite and persimmon occurred in sufficient numbers later in the warm season to provide opportunities to gorge on these foods as coprolite contents attest. Snails, reptiles, small mammals and aquatic re sources such as fish, shell fish, frogs and turtles were incorporated as the foraging opportunities and seasonal availability pre sented themselves. Deer were rarely felled judging from the infrequent occurrence of deer bones; rabbits and mice were the dominant mammalian forms consumed. Technology Perhaps nowhere else in their cultural remains is the resourcefulness of these prehistoric foragers more clearly seen than in their use of local products. The resource utilization strategy seems to have been one of choosing the most readily available material that required the least amount of effort. Improvising was the rule rather than the exception. This statement is amply supported by a variety of examples such as the basketry techniques, sandal manufacture and in the lithic technology. Several flake or nodule forms were used to scrape pulp from the 134</page><page sequence="7">Figure 4. Sotol (Dasylirion sp.) plant beginning to flower (July 1976) near Hinds Cave, Val Verde County, Texas. fibers of succulent plants such as yucca; seemingly the only criterion for selection of these tools was an adequate edge angle. A greater selection was exercised in producing a flake for use as a slicing tool to cut the leaves from the bulbs of the desert succulents such as lechuguilla and sotol. But the bulb was not the only portion of these plants utilized and I will focus on one of the succulents, sotol, to demonstrate the resourceful characteristics of this desert adaptation. Sotol (Fig. 4) is a member of the Lily family (Liliaceae); its genus is Dasylirion and there are about 30 species spread over the Southwestern U.S. and northern Mexico. The species that is of most concern to us here is probably Dasylirion texanum. As noted earlier, sotol occurs on the slopes of the rocky canyons bordering the streams and tributaries as well as in sometimes dense communities on the eroded shelves of the plateau spurs and knobs. The plant has a matted root system that anchors firmly to the ground and must be detached with a prying instrument such as a digging stick. The leaves radiate upward and outward from the bulb in a rosette fashion and each leaf has numerous sharp thorns making barehanded handling of the plant painful and impractical. Therefore, the plant bulb must be deleafed and this was accomplished by using sharp-edged flake knives. The bulb, once freed from the ground and deleafed, is then baked in an earth oven for several days to render the starchy, fibrous tissue edible (Sjoberg 1953). The tough, fibrous leaves of the plant were used to weave carrying baskets, checkerweave trays, twilled mats, and sandals among other things; the tough fibers were used in the manufacture of cordage for nets, bags, and aprons; the stalk was used as firewood, split and used as a firestick was sometimes painted, used as fire-tongs, walking sticks and perhaps even as inpromtu digging sticks. The flowers were apparently eaten at times, as were the seeds. At any month of the year, the sotol plant provided both a resource for food and raw material for a multitude of items. The sotol is but one example of a number of plants including lechuguilla, yuccas and prickly pear that were extensively utilized in the everyday life of these ancient people. And it is this kind of resourcefulness that led to their successful adaptation to this seemingly harsh environment for over 9,000 years. The local plants provided not only the staple foods but the raw materials to satisfy most of their basic needs. Discussion An attempt has been made to view the setting of the lower Pecos Archaic adapta tions in a finite manner. The territory and "home range" concepts were employed to frame a known area in which the resource distribution and availability could be consid ered. The prehistoric territories and "home range" probably fluctuated through time but the core area presumably remained the same. The distribution of the Pecos River style rock art was used to trace the prehistoric territorial range at the time it was produced. I realize that the rock art may document the geogra phic range of related bands during only one part of the prehistoric sequence. The impor tant point to consider here is that the stylistic patterns of the material elements can be used as indicators of the geographic range of the ancient populations. The lack of topographic, geologic and climatic variability and the arid environment combined to limit the plant, animal and mineral resource variability. These factors, combined with the erratic flowering and 135</page><page sequence="8">fruiting schedules of desert flora due to fluctuations in temperature and rainfall, provide, at first appearance, a marginal habitat for human foragers. Despite these seemingly negative factors, Archaic popula tions successfully adapted to the region about 9500 years ago. A critical factor contributing to the success of this adaptation was the year-round availability of the desert succu lents and the degree to which these plants were incorporated not only as food but as resource materials for textiles and tools. Plant foods composed the bulk of the diet as coprolite analyses have shown. Hunting provided a minimal but important amount of the total food intake. Choices in the selection of edible plants during most of the year was minimal due to the low diversity. Once knowledge of their economic use was gained and the techniques devised to exploit them efficiently, then changes in this economic pattern would not be expected unless change occurred in the plant communities due to a changing ecology. There is no evidence that any of the plants were eradicated as a result of human or natural causes, of any marked climatic shift that would significantly alter the existing plant communities, or of the sudden appearance of useful invader plants. Archaeological evi dence for the growing of domesticated plants is also nonexistent. If any change were to take place in the resource patterns, they would least likely occur in the exploitation practices of the plants. The technology of plant use would predictably change little and the tool set related to the procurement and processing of the bulky plants such as sotol and lechuguilla would predictably remain about the same through time. In those areas of their lifeway where choices could be exercised, especially in non-subsistence related behav iors, change might be expected to occur more frequently. In essence, the model implies a conservatism in the adaptive technology oriented toward the uses of the available plants and animals; the stylistic patterns which do not conflict with the more rigidly set technological aspects would be more free to change. And it is here that the major changes are most apparent ?in style such as projectile points, painted pebbles or pictographs. Projectile point style is regarded as a function of the hafting techniques ?i.e., technological ?but the weapon itself (atlatl and spear) and its uses did not change. Its efficiency could have been affected, or thought to have been affected, with a style change by its users. However, stylistic change took place so seldom when viewed over generations through time that populations themselves doubtfully were conscious that change was taking place. In conclusion, the Archaic populations who occupied the lower Pecos area are hypothesized to have been structured in small bands which maintained a low population density over the arid landscape. Their settlement activity was concentrated along the permanent Pecos, Devil's and Rio Grande rivers in mainly open settlements where they could take advantage of the greatest plant and animal diversity offered by the environ ment. Sheltered caves and rockshelters were numerous and were apparently utilized during both the cool and warm seasons, presumably during periods of inclement weather. No area of the territory was ignored during the course of the foraging; erratic rainfall, seasonal flowering and fruiting dines and game movements all probably contributed to the decisions regarding the movements within the territory of particular bands. The virtual absence of resources foreign ,to the area in excavated archaeological sites indicate that the adaptation was a self-sustaining one and that the risk of moving into adjacent regions presumably outweighed the benefits. The lower Pecos Archaic adaptation sustained a population that perpetuated itself for approxi mately 500 generations. This conservatism is indeed somewhat unique when compared to similar desert adaptations in the American Southwest and northern Mexico that began about the same time.
