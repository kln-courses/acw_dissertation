<plain_text><page sequence="1">Introduction Excavations in the lower Lurin Valley at Huaca Villa Salvador' in Peru have resulted in the recognition of a ceramic style that cross-dates to the end of the Early Horizon (hereafter EH, ca. 1000 B.C. to 250 B.C.) and the early phases of the Early Intermediate Period (hereafter EIP, ca. 250 B.C. to 600 A.D.). Although there is still no complete ceramic sequence from the central coast that spans the time between the end of Chavin in- fluence and the beginning of the Lima style, the new evidence from Villa Salvador helps to E1ll in the gap in our knowledge of the styles and settlements of the EH- EIP transition on the central coast. The Villa Salvador Site Huaca Villa Salvador lies ca. 4 km. north of the Tem- ple of the Sun of Pachacamac, and ca. 1.5 km. from the sea (FIGS. 1-2). The site is located in the Tablada de 1. This research was carried out in 1975-76 with Dr. Rogger Ravines, Chief of the Investigation Section of the Centro de Restauracion de Bienes Monumentales at the Instituto Nacional de Cultura, Lima, Peru. During the research period the author was sup- ported by fellowships from the Fulbright Commission (Comision para el Intercambio Educativo entre el Peru y los Estados Unidos), and later from the Organization of American States. The field work was supported by a grant to Ravines and Stothert from the Ford Foundation (Lima, Peru), and another to Stothert from the Faculty Research Council of Fordham University. I am grateful to the stu- dents who participated in the project, Jose Diaz and Eva Kouvalinova de Farfan, and to many others who have lent their sup- port: Marcia Koth de Paredes, Dorothy Menzel, Thomas C. Patter- son, David L. Browman, Dwight T. Wallace, Frederic Engel, and Neil D. Maurer. Lurin, which is today the desert pampa that divides the lower Rimac and Lurin valleys. The site is a heavily vandalized cemetery with architecture consisting of free-standing walls constructed of hand-made, hem- ispherical adobe bricks set in puddled clay (FIG. 3). Some of the walls are plastered smooth and a set of plastered stairs gives access to a central plaza (FIG. 4). Small enclosures and corridors are distributed around the open plaza, and the whole architectural complex is filled with soil and rubble in which human burials are found (FIG. 5). The dead of Villa Salvador were interred in sitting position facing west or sw with their legs tightly flexed and drawn up to their chests (FIG. 6). The bodies were wrapped in one or more shrouds of cotton cloth, which is invariably badly preserved, and tied with cords. Some bodies were arranged on matting or in shallow baskets. Normally a single ceramic vessel was found in each tomb. Other offerings included Spondylus shells (in- terred whole with the dead); shell and stone beads; gold covered copper ornaments including face and head coverings; gourds, some containing guinea pig (Cavia sp.) bones or acting as covers for ceramic vessels; quan- tities of mineral oxides in various colors; copper ob- jects; bird beaks and burnt food offerings. In the central plaza burials were found superimposed to a depth of almost 2 m. Many of the skeletons pre- sumed to be undisturbed by vandals were found to be headless. Secondary burials with broken ceramic offer- ings were also recovered, indicating that some reburial had occurred. Infants were buried in bundles in shallow holes in the refuse deposits. The Villa Salvador Site and the Beginning of the Early Intermediate Period in the Lurin Valley, Peru Karen E. Stothert University of Texas, San Antonio New excavations in the lower Lurin Valley at Huaca Villa Salvador in Peru es- tablish an early occupation that cross-dates to the end of the Early Horizon and the beginning of the Early Intermediate Period. A comparison of the Villa Salvador ceramic style with contemporary styles shows that independent ethnic groups maintained distinct ceramic traditions in this period although many common decorative ideas were sharedfrom group to group. A review of the set- tlements of the Early Horizon-Early Intermediate Period transition in valleys of the central and south-central coasts suggests that the lower valley regions were inhabited by people who exploited the agricultural potential of that zone as well as the resources of the sea, but did not directly occupy the upper valleys. These small societies were stratified and organized around local ceremonial centers involving modest architecture.</page><page sequence="2"> 280 Villa Salvador and the Early Intermediate Period, Peru/Stothert ';1 \P E R U\\_w Lurin R\t &lt; PACIFiC OCEAN | \ Casma Figure 3.

Burials were intrusive into some of the refuse layers, and in no case did refuse ac- cumulate above any burial suggesting that all the burials post-date the refuse at this site. Comparison of Ceramic Styles Villa Salvador The Villa Salvador ceramic assemblage shows both EH and EIP characteristics, so two hypothetical phases have been defined. Most vessels, however, can not be assigned to a sub-phase because there is very little stratigraphic evidence for the relative dating of burials, and because most of the excavated grave lots have only one vessel, so that seriation has been unproductive. There is, however, reason to think that stylistic change did occur during the time that the Villa Salvador cemetery was in use. Horizontal stratigraphy within the site supports the idea of two Villa Salvador phases: brown-ware jars, tentatively considered a hallmark of Phase 1, show a tendency to cluster in burials in the north part of the cemetery. This concen- tration could be because of other factors, such as status differences in the individuals buried in that part of the site, but I think that this part of the cemetery was used in an earlier period and left relatively undisturbed while the central part of the site was reused. Squat, orange ware ollas with red-and-white decoration on their shoulders seem to be a Phase 2 innovation, and these vessels are concentrated in the central part of Huaca Villa Salvador and in a vandalized cemetery less than a kilometer from the main site (see FIG. 2, Site 2). Villa Salvador ], the earlier stylistic phase, is defined from the decorated refuse sherds, from sherds occurring in the surface collections from Huaca Villa Salvador, and from whole vessels that show relationships with known EH styles. Villa Salvador I is characterized by collared, brown ware jars which are very thin (averaging 0.55 cm.), heavily sand-tempered, and which have lusterless sur- faces with narrow smoothing tracks (FIG. 7). These jars are occasionally decorated with lines of jabbed or in- cised marks located in a circumferential band below the rim (FIG. 8A-D). Style I also includes brown ware collared ollas (FIG. 9); orange ware collared ollas (FIG 10); fine orange plates with rare painted decoration (FIG. 1 l A-I); some closed bowls and neckless ollas (FIG. 11 J-M); vessels with modeled decoration including face-neck jars (FIGS. 12, 13); double-spout-and-bridge bottles (FIG. 14); zoomorphic bottles with bichrome N 1-' W Area cleared Wall * Burial 5m Figure 5.

In general these decorative modes, vessel types, and wares are not out of context in the post-Chavin phases of the south-central and south-coast ceramic sequences. In fact, some very specific similarities between Villa Salvador vessels and vessels of the Jahuay phases of the Topara Tradition (FIG. 17) and the latest Ocucaje phases (FIG. 18) suggest that these phases may all be cross-dated. Villa Salvador 2 is defined from the funerary vessels and surface sherds that bear features found in ceramic styles of the beginning of the EIP. The most common shape is the squat, orange ware olla with a low collar (FIGS. 19, 10), but the double-spout-and-bridge bottle is also common. Orange wares are most prominent. Among the Phase 2 decorative modes are: surface polishing leaving narrow tracks; irregular pattern bur- nishing; red-on-white slip painting featuring simple, line-and-dot designs (FIG. 20); thick white paint applied to the collars of vessels or to the modeled decorations on the shoulders of vessels (FIGS. 19, 21A); modeled  Figure 9.

In general Phase 2 is in keeping with what we know about the beginning of the EIP: there is a greater emphasis on painted decoration and well-oxidized wares are common. Since some Villa Salvador vessels cross-date well to Banos de Boza (FIGS. 20C, 22C, 24) and with Nasca l (FIG. 23) then it is probable that Huaca Villa Salvador was being used as a cemetery dur- ing the early phases of the EIP.

The identity of vessels in the two cemeteries suggests that they were in part contempo- rary. Squat, orange ware ollas with red-on-white dec- oration characteristic of Phase 2, however, were not found at the Necropolis, and other unique vessel forms and decorative techniques found at the Necropolis do not occur at Villa Salvador. I have concluded3 that the cemetery of the Necropolis is in part older than Villa Salvador, although ethnic differences might also ac- count for the stylistic differences observed. In the deepest excavated levels at Pachacamac there is evidence for an occupation that corresponds to Villa Salvador. Strong and Corbett found 18 sherds of white- on-red style pottery associated with Punctate (and In- cised) types.4 While the white-on-red sherds show only general similarities to Villa Salvador materials, the other decorated sherds are similar to some found at Villa Salvador.5 Uhle illustrates a painted, zoomorphic vessel in pure Villa Salvador style which was found at Pachacamac in deep sand unassociated with other archeological remains.6 This evidence suggests that the people who buried at Villa Salvador also occupied Pachacamac before the expansion of that site. In the upper Lurin Valley, 20-40 kms. inland from Villa Salvador, there are sites that apparently belong to the late EH and the early EIP.7 Working with surface Seminario de Arqueologia 2 (Lima: Pontificia Universidad Catolica 1969) 101-122; Mercedes Cardenas, "Hallazgo de un Huaco Chavi- noide en una Tumba de Tablada de Lurin," Boletin del Seminario de Arqueologia 1, Instituto de Riva Aguero (Lima: Pontificia Univer- sidad Catolica 19,69) 128-131; idem, "Dos Ceramios Naturalistas en Tablada de Lurin: Informe de las Tumbas 1 y 3 del Area 22," Boletin del Seminario de Arqueologia 6, Instituto de Riva Aguero (Lima: Pontificia Universidad Catolica 1970) 1-11. 3.

Other features of Lapa Lapa I include: rare neckless ollas; red-slip paint; flat-bottomed, shallow, orange ware bowls; cane stamped sherds; orange ware jars with low, flaring collars and conical nubs on the shoulders; and a few red and white painted sherds. All of these modes have analogues at Villa Salvador, Banos de Boza, and in sites of the upper Lurin. This Lapa Lapa site also yielded an almost complete vessel of brown ware with a painted serpent design executed in red-on- white, pre-Elred pigments. The details of the design correspond to the serpent painted on the double-spout- and-bridge bottles common at Villa Salvador (FIG. 14). Nevertheless, there is enough variation between Lapa Lapa I and Villa Salvador to suggest ethnic differences. I use the sherds from Site 12B-VII-100 to deElne Lapa Lapa 2, which is characterized by polychrome decoration involving simple, geometric designs executed on white or black slips.l3 This style is likely to have been contemporary with the Quebrada, Campana and Carmen styles of the south-central coast. TheAncon Region Patterson and Burger have worked on the EH ceramic materials from the Tank Site at Ancon.l4 A1- though there is a gap in the stylistic sequence between the EH and the beginning of the EIP, the evidence in- dicates certain trends that probably parallel develop- ments occurring elsewhere on the central coast at the same time. Burger describes an increase in the pop- ularity of oxidized wares (a similar increase apparently happened also in the Lurin Valley); the appearance of strap handles on open bowls (a feature common at Ven- tanilla); a growing frequency of tall necked jars (com- mon at Villa Salvador); and trade sherds with red and white slip painting and no incision.l5 The Miramar pot- tery style apparently developed out of the EH styles at Ancon. 12.

Burger, "The Ceramic Sequence of the Early Horizon from Ancon, Peru," typescript (n.d.). 1 S. Burger, op. cit. (in note 14). My conclusions are based on Burger's description of eight ceramic phases. collections from these sites, Earle has deElned two ce- ramic phases. Phase I is characterized by some brown- on-white slip painting and the beginning of an appAique Elllet tradition. In this phase the fillet band is located below the rim of collared jars, and it is slashed or crenelated. One sherd exhibits punched decoration on the Flllet, and another has a plain row of punched designs below the jar rim.8 These last two modes occur at Villa Salvador in the refuse sherds assigned to Phase 1. The slashed fillet decoration may be the up-valley equivalent of the row of punched or jabbed marks that decorates Villa Salvador jar collars (FIG. 8A-D). Earle's Phase 2 is characterized by simple lines, triangles and dots painted in brown-on-white on open bowls, ollas and jars.9 Despite the difference in the color of the Elrst pigment, the simple, painted designs are very similar to the red-on-white designs of Villa Salvador 2 (FIG. 20). In their analyses of the upper Lurin ceramics from this period, both Earle and Browman emphasize the divergence of the plainware styles in adjacent, local areas. Since the upper Lurin sites share only a few ceramic traits with the Necropolis de la Tablada, Villa Salvador and contemporary sites in the Chilca Valley, it is likely that in the period of the EH-EIP transition there was a mosaic of independent ethnic groups in these valleys. Chilca Area The ceramic style most closely related to Villa Salvador is known from the lower Chilca Quebrada. Frederic Engel generously showed me sherds from two Lapa Lapa sites.ln While the utilitarian wares at the two sites are very similar, and nearly identical to the brown wares of Villa Salvador, the differences in the decorated sherds from the two Lapa Lapa sites suggests that two distinct phases are represented. The materials from Site 1 2B-VII-303 define Lapa Lapa Phase 1. This unit is characterized by red-on- white painted decoration. One fine orange bowl rim bears a white band on the interior edge to which red dots have been added. The identical vessels and decora- tion have been found at the Necropolis de la Tablada,l l 8.

Ramos de Cox, op. cit. 1969 (in note 2) Item #402.</page><page sequence="10">288 Villa Salvador and the Early Intermediate Period, Peru/Stothert The Miramar style, dated to the early phases of the EIP, has been divided into four phases by Patterson.'6 While there are many similarities between Miramar and Villa Salvador, the latter can be identiEled with none of the Miramar sub-phases, although the absence of black pigment at Villa Salvador suggests that it correlates with the earlier Miramar phases. The features common to both the Villa Salvador and Miramar styles include: the use of red and white pig- ments to make simple, painted designs; white slips and white bands on the collars of jars; vertical red and white color zones; zones of decoration between the collar and the point of maximum width of the vessel; similar brown and orange wares; similar olla shapes, especially one with a ridged lip (FIG. 10E); and mammiform jars (FIG. 21C, F). Miramar is distinct from Villa Salvador in emphasizing fine ware bowls, and Miramar features some decorative modes that do not appear at Villa Salvador. The Villa Salvador style features its own dis- tinctive decorative motifs and emphasizes jars and closed forms such as collared ollas. The Miramar and Villa Salvador styles seem to represent contemporary manifestations of two ethnic groups that shared many ceramic ideas but that had slightly different ceramic traditions. One of the difElculties of this interpretation is that funerary pottery (from Villa Salvador) is being compared with domestic wares (the Miramar sherds). Ventanilla Except for the Ancon data, the only useful evidence for the end of the EH on the central coast comes from small sites near Ventanilla Bay between Chillon and Ancon. 17 The Ventanilla pottery is difElcult to cross-date since other local styles of the late EH have not been pub- lished. Based on Burger's descriptions, however, the Ventanilla style may be seen as an outgrowth of the post-Chavin, EH styles of Ancon which tended to add features such as bright orange ware; strap handles at- tached to open vessels; a tall sided bowl; jars with short, flared rims; jars with taller collars; and rare decorations such as negative designs and red and white stripes on orange ware with no incision.

Patterson had carried out excavations in the 1960s and both scholars showed me their unpublished field notes. 18. Burger, op. cit. (in note 14) 22-36. It is convenient to divide the Ventanilla style into two sub-phases. Ventanilla I (deElned from pottery in the lower levels of Site PV45- 117 and all levels of PV45-125) features thick, open or slightly convex-sided bowls, often with large handles just below the rims; few jars; modeled lugs with decorative dents; red slip; sim- ple negative decoration; cream or buff zone painting; and mostly oxidized wares. Because the Ventanilla 2 materials cross-date best to styles of the early EIP, Ven- tanilla I may be assigned to the late EH. Ventanilla 2 is defined by material overlying Ven- tanilla I pottery in PV48- 1 17. Some of the earlier vessel forms and decorative techniques disappear in Ven- tanilla 2 which is characterized by a high frequency of enclosed vessels with short and tall, flared necks; ollas with ridged lips; horizontal strap handles; narrow polishing lines; narrow spouted bottles (probably double-spout-and-bridge bottles); cream slip on vessel necks; red slip paint; some black ware; orange on buff painting; thin bowls with flat bases; and an emphasis on oxidized wares. Several of these features make it possi- ble to cross date this sub-phase to the Villa Salvador, Miramar and Banos de Boza styles. Chancay Valley At Banos de Boza in the Chancay Valley Willey found a small building or platform with adjacent rooms constructed of hemispherical adobes laid in mortar. This kind of construction is unusual and probably signals that Villa Salvador, Cerro de Trinidad and Banos de Boza were closely related, contemporary sites. The Villa Salvador and the Banos de Boza ceramic styles may be cross-dated on the basis of the occurrence of the following at both sites: mammiform vessels; zoomorphic bottles; double-spout-and-bridge bottles; use of white and red slips to execute simple, geometric designs; modeled lugs and low nubs on vessel walls; modeled face collars; the use of painted dots as fillers; sloppy white dots on orange ware; and some other dis- tinctive vessel shapes.l9 Apart from these many corre- spondences, the Banos de Boza style features very dif- ferent olla shapes and decorative motifs. Canete, Chincha and Pisco Valleys Useful data for illuminating the culture history of the central coast come from the south-central coast where 19.

Jahuay 3 is a transitional phase that demonstrates the intensification of the previous phase with the final dis- appearance of grater plates (not found at Villa Salvador), of incised designs, and of flat-bottomed bowls. Burnished designs and a polished black ware (not found at Villa Salvador) become very popular while bichrome painting continued.24 The Chongos Phase of the Topara Tradition follows Jahuay 3 and is contemporaneous with Nasca I in Ica.25 According to Menzel, the Chincha and Canete people developed a great deal of prestige at the end of the EH and during the Chongos Phase at the beginning of the EIP, and they acted as important innovators and agents of diffusion over a wide area on the south and central coasts.26 Some of the old and new features of the Chongos style which were diffused widely include abundant fine orange ware; differential firing of orange ware bowls; bowls with base angles and short, straight sides; double- spouted bottles with gadrooning and a shelf-like top to the vessel body; ollas with projecting lips; dark red slips; a new maroon-colored slip paint; pattern bur- nishing; burnished black interiors on orange ware bowls; waisted bowls; some new bowl shapes including slightly everted rims; tapered bottle spouts; and bi- chrome painting.27 These traits occur individually or in groups in most of the styles that I have described so far. The Villa Salvador style incorporates most of these features except differential firing and burnished black interiors on bowls, both of which are Elring tricks that might have been difE1cult to imitate. The Campana and Quebrada styles replaced Chongos in the Canete and Chincha valleys during Nasca Phase 2. These styles feature black and white painted back- grounds decorated with parallel lines in several colors,28 and they probably cross-date to Lapa Lapa 2 and post- date Villa Salvador entirely. The Ica Valley The Villa Salvador style shares some features with the late EH and the EIP styles of the Ica Valley, but the and Lawrence Dawson, The Paracas Pottery of Ica: A Study in Style and Time, University of California Publications in American Archae- ology and Ethnology 50 (Berkeley and Los Angeles 1964) 209-250. 24 Menzel, op. cit.

Ibid. 120-121. many of the basic features of the Villa Salvador style are found in the pottery of the Topara Tradition. Although the Topara styles have not been well illus- trated in print20 it is accepted by archeologists writing about the EH and the EIP that Topara potters strongly influenced their neighbors to the north and south at the end of the EH and into the EIP.2' The Topara Tradition begins with three Jahuay phases.22 Jahuay I is a monochrome style featuring two distinct wares, a brown and an orange, which are also characteristic of Villa Salvador. Jahuay 1 features neck- less ollas, jars with flaring collars, incised decoration, flat bottomed bowls and both white and red slip paints. In general this style and its antecedents in the Canete and Chincha valleys are likely ancestors for the Villa Salvador style, or they are similar to the unknown an- cestral style of the Lurin Valley. Jahuay 2 shows strong continuity from Phase I and introduces new traits, many of which are found in the Villa Salvador style. The Jahuay 2 traits include bur- nished designs, waisted vessels (found at the Necropolis de la Tablada); double-spouted bottles with white slip and gadrooning (found at Villa Salvador); ollas with projecting or ridged lips; some modeling; modeled bird vessels; anthropomorphic vases and figurines; and bichrome decoration including white-on-red, white-on- plain, red-on-white, and red-on-plain. Lanning de- scribes a Jahuay 2 vessel with cane stamping around the shoulder that is not illustrated but might be like one from Villa Salvador (FIG. 17). Jahuay 2 shows specific relationships to Ocucaje 10 of the Ica sequence, in- dicating that the potters of the two regions were in- fluencing each other while the styles remained very in- dependent.23 A similar relationship may have existed be- 20.

Phase 10 of the Ocucaje sequence in the Ica Valley marks the end of the EH and was a major innovating period.29 This style shows more similarities with Villa Salvador than the preceding phases of the Ocucaje sequence. Some of the Ocucaje 10 features found in the Villa Salvador style are: double-spouted bottles with white slip (probably from the Topara style); broad, ver- tical stripes on bottles executed in slip paints; red as a design color (also from Topara); white slip painting; proliferation of musical instruments (such as the slip cast panpipes, found at Villa Salvador, and bichrome whistles found at the Necropolis de la Tablada); modeled bird bottles; circle-and-dot eyes; face necks; ovoid jars; bulging necks on jars; some incised decora- tion; representational designs such as serpents with forked heads and fish painted on bowls and bottles; and high arched bridges on bottles. It is interesting that some Ocucaje 10 features that were not found in the Villa Salvador collections do appear in the Necropolis de la Tablada samples, or in the Lapa Lapa material. Local variations in potters' choices, chronological dif- ferences, or sampling error might account for the dif- ferences among assemblages on the central coast. At least some of the Villa Salvador vessels seem to be imitations of Nasca I innovations. For instance, one vessel, painted with maroon slip and not incised, is like the basket-shaped bottles with fish characteristic of Nasca I (FIG. 23).3° Jauja-Huancayo Region There is little information from adjacent highland regions that helps to illuminate the EH-EIP transition on the central coast. Browman's evidence from the Mantaro Valley is an exception. Apparently people of that highland region interacted intensively with people of other areas, especially toward the end of the EH. Browman's Cochachongos Phase dates to the later EH and a large number of trade sherds show south- coast origins, probably during Ocucaje 9 and 10, but Browman believes that the major coastal influences on the Cochachongos style came through the Jahuay styles. In addition, Browman suggests that the red-on- white bichrome of Jahuay 2 was a result of Cocha- chongos influence.3' Cochachongos also shares a num- bel of ceramic traits with the styles of the upper Lurin 29.

The Uchupas Phase, which follows Cochachongos, cross-dates to the first phase of the EIP as defined by the Miramar and Chongos styles. The emphasis on open bowls in Uchupas is reminiscent of Miramar and contrasts with Villa Salvador. Summary of Styles Table 1 shows the chronological relationships among the styles and sub-phases described here. The inter- pretation of these relationships is impaired by the lack of published descriptions for some styles such as Topara; the absence of evidence for some important areas such as the Rimac Valley; the gaps in the ceramic sequences for the EH and EIP on the central coast; and the smallness and non-comparability of the archeo- logical samples. Nevertheless, several patterns are plain in the data available. At the beginning of the EIP in the valleys of the cen- tral coast, groups of people were living within a few kilometers of each other and maintaining very distinct ceramic styles. This case parallels the evidence for much of the Peruvian culture area where cultural indepen- dence and the regionalization of styles are characteristic of the period after the end of Chavin influence. While remaining distinct, the Villa Salvador, Lapa Lapa, Miramar, and Banos de Boza styles are affiliates of a white-on-red horizon32 that encompasses a number of roughly contemporary Peruvian ceramic styles, such as Vicus, Salinar, Puerto Moorin, and Patazca, all of which feature white-slip painting on red ground. What influences account for the common characteristics shared by so many diverse, local styles? Unfortunately the antecedents of the Villa Salvador style and the other styles of the beginning of the EIP on the central coast are unknown or undescribed, but it seems likely that each style had a local origin. In addi- tion the EIP styles of the central coast were probably in- fluenced by the ceramic ideas of the Topara potters of the south-central coast, where white-on-red painting was already established in the EH period. Villa Salvador potters were influenced by certain Topara ce- ramic ideas while the other independent ethnic groups of the central coast adopted Topara ideas in distinct manners. There were certainly highland influences on the development of the central coastal styles during the EH-EIP transition, but there is little evidence for dis- cussing these. Typically each of the independent so- 32. Gordon R.

Chronological relationships of ceramic styles of the EH-EIP transition. cieties of the coastal valleys would have responded dif- ferently to these influences also. Another outstanding question of the archeology of the central coast concerns the replacement of the white- on-red styles by Lima style pottery and the development of a corresponding political entity, a Lima state, in the central coastal valleys by the middle of the EIP. Patter- son concluded that the Lima style pottery was derived from the Miramar style of Ancon and the lower Chillon Valley33 and that the style is intrusive in the Chancay, Rimac, Lurin, and Chilca valleys. The evidence from Villa Salvador supports this interpretation since there is no evidence in the Lurin Valley to suggest that the Lima pottery developed from the earlier Villa Salvador style. Settlements The analysis of pottery styles can only begin to answer questions about the EH-EIP transition, about the cultures of that period, and about the antecedents of the growth of the Lima state. The most pertinent data about the events, societies, and economies of the period come from the study of settlements. Lower Lurin Valley Villa Salvador refuse is found in many locations across the lower Tablada de Lurin, outside the zone of modern agriculture. One test excavation was made about 70 m. east of the Villa Salvador cemetery where plain sherds appeared on the surface of the sand. Below the surface a clay floor with a refuse pit was uncovered. Sherds and ashes were scattered on the floor and small holes suggested that poles might have held up a roof. The majority of the small sites assigned to the Villa Salvador complex are like this one, representing the refuse of a few houses which were built of perishable materials. The frequency of these small sites gives the impression that the Tablada was most densely pop- ulated in the late EH and early EIP. Additional small 33. Patterson, op. cit.

The site of Villa Salvador may have had a different function before it was used for burial. The accumula- tion of refuse in the precincts suggests the possibility that it had been an elite building or ceremonial plaza which was abandoned, used for dumping, and then refurbished as a cemetery. More burials, without archi- tecture but associated with Villa Salvador ceramics, have been disturbed by vandals on the hills adjacent to Villa Salvador. The large pyramids of the Lurin (Mina Perdida, Car- dal and Malpaso) were abandoned before the end of the EH34 and the only ceremonial or elite construction known from the late EH and the early phases of the EIP is the ruin of Villa Salvador. There is a 30 m. long wall near the modern town of Lurin within the lower valley which resembles the walls of Villa Salvador in construc- tion technique,35 but this construction is not associated with diagnostic pottery. I would guess that another Villa Salvador settlement, probably including a ceremonial site, did exist near the Lurin River under what is now the site of Pachacamac, just 4 km. south of Villa Sal- vador. The few sherds excavated by Strong and Corbett at Pachacamac do not indicate what kind of settlement existed there, but the feline portrait vessel illustrated by Uhle might have been associated with elite activities since similar vessels were associated with elite burials at Villa Salvador. The oldest known architectural group at Pacha- camac, a series of rooms in Zone I near the modern site museum, is constructed of small rectangular adobes and was filled with late Lima style sherds and refuse.36 In clearing below this ruin two Villa Salvador painted vessels,37 identical to the one illustrated in Figure 14, were found, a fact that strengthens the idea that Pachacamac was already an important local center early in the EIP The people who buried their elite at Villa Salvador were exploiting a variety of resources from their settle- ments in the Lower Lurin Valley. Certainly the flood plain of the river was the primary productive zone, with or without water-management techniques, for which there is now no evidence. Two lines of evidence suggest that the Tablada itself was a more attractive agricul- tural zone than it is today. First, the Tablada is known to have a high water table and there is evidence that it only became deforested recently.38 In addition the dense scatter of houses over the whole Tablada suggests that the resources were available to sustain life: water, fuel, fodder and perhaps some space for growing food. The refuse at Villa Salvador, which has not been analyzed in detail, contains at least the following: small- eared maize, peanut, cotton, gourds, reeds and wild legumes, all of which could have been grown or gathered in the lower river valley. Quinoa, which would have been imported from higher elevations, also occurs charred in the cemetery. The faunal remains indicate that fish, birds, guinea pig (Cavia sp.), and shellfish (especially Mytilus sp. and Mesodesma sp.) were con- sumed by the people of Villa Salvador. Larger animal bones were few; they probably represent deer or llama. This evidence indicates that the sea and the beaches were important resource areas to these people who also farmed and raised domestic animals. The elite of Villa Salvador managed to acquire exotic items such as Spondylus shell, semi-precious stone, cop- per and gold ornaments, quinoa, and tropical bird beaks. There is little evidence to suggest what they might have been giving in trade, but shellfish remains do occur in up-valley sites, and other exchangeable pro- ducts might include cotton and cotton cloth, articles made of reeds, or dried fish and other foodstuffs. In summary, the evidence from Villa Salvador sites suggests that the lower Lurin Valley and the adjacent Tablada de Lurin were densely inhabited by people en- gaged in agriculture and in exploiting other local resources. Villa Salvador ceramics are restricted in dis- tribution to the lower valley which was probably the territory of one, politically independent ethnic group. The burials excavated at the Villa Salvador cemetery seem to be those of the local elite. No doubt part of the surplus production was used by this elite to acquire im- ported goods and another part probably supported building projects for which the only evidence is the ruin of Villa Salvador. Upper Lurin Valley Patterson and Earle have conducted a thorough sur- vey of the Lurin Valley for ca. 20 km. along the river starting at a point ca. 25 kms. inland from the sea. They identified several sites that can be assigned to the eariy 34.

In the midden Lanning found subterranean walls constructed of cobblestones, superimposed clay floors, and destroyed clay walls that probably repre- sented domestic architecture.46 Other habitation sites are scattered across the lower valleys. Small adobe pyramids, which might have served as the bases for temples, are associated with Jahuay pottery, showing that the EH tradition of building pyramids continued into the late phases of the EH on the south central coast.47 Chongos pottery is found at many sites in the lower valleys, often stratified above Jahuay phase pottery.48 Apparently pyramids were no longer built or used, but Chongos pottery is associated with an innovative kind of urban center. For instance, the Chongos type site consists of a large area of refuse with building founda- tions, apparently houses, and a large plaza with adja- cent enclosures, implying a ceremonial or administra- tive center with a large resident population.49 Chancay Valley Banos de Boza style pottery was found at two sites in the Chancay Valley. At Cerro de Trinidad there was probably a large building of hemispherical adobes asso- ciated with white-on-red pottery. 50 At the Banos de Boza site itself a solid, small pyramid-type structure or platform was partly excavated by Willey. The structure was built of hemispherical adobes and flanked by small rooms. Abundant refuse was found in association with this architecture, but only one burial was recovered. The refuse on adjacent hills suggests that the ceremonial place had a permanent resident population.5' In general this site is not unlike the one found at Villa Salvador. Ancon-Chillon Region The people who made Miramar pottery lived in small, scattered villages on the Pampa of Ancon and in hilltop sites in the lower Chillon Valley. At least some of the villages were associated with small rubble-filled pyramids. 52 46. Lanning, op. cit. (in note 20) 394-395. 47. Menzel, op. cit. (in note 20) 144-145. 48. Ibid. 115 49. Dwight T.

The sites are small habitation loca- tions, often located on hill tops or ridges well off the valley floor, with no evidence for political hierarchy.39 Chilca Quebrada The people most closely related to the inhabitants of Villa Salvador occupied the Lapa Lapa sites of the Chilca Quebrada, located about 35 km. south of Villa Salvador. The sites are restricted to the area within 10 km. of the beach where Lapa Lapa pottery is associated with complexes of walls, terraces, house sites, wells and silos.40 Lapa Lapa pottery is found scattered in various sites across the lower Chilca pampa4' which is similar to the pattern found in the Tablada de Lurin. The ma- jority of the houses at the main Lapa Lapa site, which is a high hill just behind the beach, were located on ar- tiElcial terraces and constructed of perishable materi- als.42 The location and nature of these sites contrast with the preceding and succeeding cultural adaptations in the Chilca Valley.43 The extensive use of terraces and the great amount of construction may reflect the topography of the valley which has a small amount of cultivatable land. Of course, similar wells, terraces, and silos may have existed in the Lurin Valley where later activities destroyed the remains. Nothing is known about Lapa Lapa burial practices, but Lapa Lapa polychrome pottery (Style 2) was found in association with a ceremonial or public ediElce con- structed of conical adobes.44 The scale of ceremo- nialism, as judged from architecture, seems to have been small compared with the large number of utilitarian constructions in Chilca. South-Central Coast In the Canete, Chincha, and Pisco valleys Jahuay sites are found in the lower valley areas, within 3 km. of the sea in the zone of modern agriculture.45 The Jahuay type site is located on a series of hills near the mouth of 39.

There is a shallow midden as well as rectangular enclosures made of loaf-shaped adobe bricks, apparently of Puerto Moorin date, at the same site.53 The location of the site, the type of wall construction, and the pottery all bring to mind the Villa Salvador site and materials, but the V- 66 burials are extended unlike the Villa Salvador burials. The evidence from V-66 indicates that that part of the valley, well away from the main river, once sup- ported "a considerable population,"54 which is also true of the Tablada de Lurin. Neither area is heavily pop- ulated today.55 Perhaps the most thorough settlement pattern data that we have for the early part of the EIP are the results of Willey's survey of Puerto Moorin sites in the Viru Valley. Although Willey depended on surface collec- tions (often from multi-component sites) he was able to identify the following settlement types for the Puerto Moorin Period: Scattered Small-House Village; Ag- glutinated Village (a newXtype in the Viru sequence); Rectangular Enclosure Compound; possibly an exam- ple of a rectangular Community Building; Pyramidal Mounds; and Hilltop Redoubts (another innovative settlement type).56 Many of these sites were found on hilltops, a circumstance that suggests a defensive pos- ture, especially since stone mace heads were also pres- ent in Puerto Moorin refuse.57 The Viru data show that settlements were quite varied compared to the com- munity patterns of the earlier period in the valley, and they show that many more people lived in the lower valley area at the beginning of the EIP than had lived there earlier. In the Casma valley, as in Viru, the multi-room en- closure was an innovative settlement type in the EIP, as was the fortiEled hilltop site. A peculiarity of the Patazca Period (assigned to the early phases of the EIP 5 3.

Summary of Settlements The sites discussed here, which belong to the end of the EH and the early EIP, are found most commonly in the lower valleys, in or near modern agricultural zones, and along the coast. After a thorough survey of the Chincha Valley, Wallace concluded that in the Jahuay and Chongos periods habitation was restricted to the lower valley and that only in later periods did people move into the up-valley zones.S9 This pattern is repeated in the Chilca Quebrada. Elsewhere the up-valley ce- ramic styles were distinct from the lower valley ones, implying that independent ethnic groups lived at dif- ferent altitudes. In most valleys the late EH and early EIP settlements were small villages or scattered houses, suggesting that nucleation of the population was not an important process in that period. Nevertheless, the frequency of small refuse concentrations dating to the late EH and early EIP in the lower valleys indicates that the coastal zone supported a considerable population in contrast with the more sparsely populated up-valley zone. While agriculture was the principal occupation of the folks living in the lower valleys, fish and shellfish were exploited. At least some of the settlements, such as those at Ventanilla and Ancon and the Miramar levels at Playa Grande, were the homes of fishermen, not full time agriculturists. Hilltop sites also figure prominently in the descrip- tions of settlements in the early EIP. Defense was probably a consideration in locating habitations. Other data, such as the presence of stone mace heads in burials and refuse and headless skeletons in tombs, sug- gest that warfare or raiding was endemic during the period. The people who made white-on-red pottery appar- ently constructed platforms, small pyramids, and some plazas and rectangular public buildings. Their construc- tions are distinctive for their use of hemispherical and conical, hand-molded adobes and rubble fill for plat- 58 Donald E.

These elite commanded a range of luxury goods acquired through trade and, judging from their decorated wares, they were influenced by pres- tigious potters from the south-central coast and else- where. The presence of headless skeletons and of mace heads at Villa Salvador and the development of a pattern of hilltop and fortified sites in the upper Lurin, the lower Chillon Valley, and on the north and south coasts would indicate that the elite of the early EIP also en- gaged in armed conflicts. By the middle of the EIP the local ethnic groups of the central coast lost their in- dependence, and the Lima style was adopted for dec- orated wares from Chancay to Chilca. Probably the small, independent units were integrated into a hierarchical structure, the so-called Lima State, which was responsible for the impressive ceremonial sites of the later EIP on the central coast, particularly in the Rimac Valley. The detailed history of the transition from one form of society to the other remains to be reconstructed, but this rough outline of events suggests the classic sequence of conquest resulting in the forging of more powerful political organizations capable of in- creasing the productivity of small, independent cultural systems at the expense of their independence.

The lack of elite dwellings and the ab- sence of especially elaborate burials in the archeological record may be taken as evidence that these early EIP societies were not extremely stratified. The burials recovered at Villa Salvador, Banos de Boza and at the Puerto Moorin cemetery in the Viru Valley seem to represent only modestly wealthy individuals by later Peruvian standards. Synthesis Although the Villa Salvador style has been added to the cultural chronology of the central coast, there is still no continuous sequence of phases between the end of Chavin influence on the pottery and the beginning of the Lima style. There are several reasons for this incom- plete chronological framework. First, only a small per- centage of the pottery of the late EH and the early EIP was decorated, leaving us with utilitarian wares to study, a circumstance that magnifies the problem of comparison and seriation. Also, sites belonging to the critical late phases of the EH are difficult to find because settlements were dispersed, even ruralized, because the elite class was not prominent, and because the people of the central coast did not undertake am- bitious building projects in that period. The available evidence suggests that fairly large populations were liv- ing in the lower valleys, and that each valley held an in- dependent ethnic group that was also distinct from its up-valley neighbors. The people of the lower valleys lived in houses of perishable material scattered along the valley floor and edges and adjacent hilltops. Settlements were located close to the main resources: the valley bottom and the sea. While agriculture in the lower valleys was the main subsistence activity, evidence is lacking for the land- or water-management techniques employed in the early EIP. Earle's data from the upper Lurin indicate that in the first two phases of the EIP small settlements, involv- ing only a small population, were located where it would have been easy to use short canals for irrigation. In later phases, according to Earle, population in- creased and settlements expanded into areas that would have required more elaborate irrigation systems in or- der to farm.60 It is reasonable to speculate that as pop- ulation increased and settlements expanded in the lower Lurin Valley during the early EIP larger-scale irrigation projects were needed to amplify the carrying capacity of the zone, and undertaking such projects would have in- volved social change. Early in the EIP political control in each of the coastal valleys apparently rested in the hands of a local 60. Earle, op. cit. (in note 7) 474.</page></plain_text>
