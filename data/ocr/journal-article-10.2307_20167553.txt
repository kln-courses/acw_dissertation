<plain_text><page sequence="1">Editorial Visual ambiguity and interpretation DARIO GAMBONI The study of visual ambiguity and the discovery of hidden images (or aspects of images) are topical pursuits, but their reputation remains ambivalent. In an article devoted to Degas's anthropomorphic landscapes, Richard Kendall thus admitted: "Hidden faces and chimerical figures are notoriously the province of the charlatan, and an attitude of caution is entirely proper to our enquiry, not least in acknowledgement of Degas' own skepticism."1 There exists indeed a pathology or a teratology of art history?or, to put it more broadly, of the commentary on the visual arts. It comprises such publications as Max Lautner's Wer ist Rembrandt? of 1891, which reattributed Rembrandt's works to his pupil Ferdinand Bol on the basis of "micro-signatures" discovered in photographic enlargements of details of the pictures, and Birger Carlstrom's Hide-and-Seek of 1989, which found in Impressionist paintings all sorts of (equally microscopic) written and figurative allusions to contemporary political events.2 But not all researchers of hidden images are more or less deranged "Sunday scholars," to use Gary Schwartz's expression.3 A respected specialist of Brancusi, Sidney Geist, published in 1989 with Harvard University Press a book in which he attempted to interpret Cezanne's pictures as if they were rebuses or picture puzzles.4 In fact, James Elkins has recently suggested that a great tolerance of ambiguity and a fascination for hidden images and meanings are characteristic of the present state of art history as a discipline. He went so far as to call Salvador Dali's book Le mythe tragique de "L'Ang?lus" de Millet, in which the artist applied his "paranoid-critical method" to the interpretation of past art, "the best work of twentieth-century art history."5 In order to explain "why our pictures are puzzles" and what he calls "the modern origins of pictorial complexity," Elkins resorts to several arguments. He mentions as influential factors the continuous accumulation of information gathered by art historians, the institutional pressure exerted by the market of interpretations, as well as the increasing self-reflexivity of the discipline and the growing autonomy of the works of art; but he also recognizes that these explanations lack specificity. The history of the changing sensitivity to visual ambiguity, in fact, remains largely unexplored, although it appears to present patterns and rhythms that are coherent and significant. It is telling, for example, that one of the first "autonomous" landscapes of Western art, the watercolor View of the Val d'Arco (1495, Louvre) painted by Albrecht D?rer on his return from Venice, includes in the depiction of the mountain two faces inspired by actual rocks found on the spot, but in different positions; it is equally revealing that this anthropomorphic dimension was first mentioned around 1932, at the time when the Surrealists were looking for images in accidental marks (fig. 1), and that it entered the scholarly debate in the 1960s, when artists and critics were developing a new interest for representation and its complexities.6 Alfred Jarry had already "discovered" a 1.

Breton would hail in 1951 as a direct antecedent of Dali's "paranoid-critical method."7 The chronological proximity between Jarry's reading of D?rer and Lautner's book on Rembrandt is again significant. In the late nineteenth century, a growing number of commentators tended to question manifest images in the name of hidden or latent ones, which they aimed to reveal to and share with their readers. New means of reproducing works of art, such as the black and white photographic enlargements used by Lautner, were instrumental in feeding as well as publicizing this trend, but it was also profoundly linked to the intellectual tendency that Carlo Ginzburg has seen represented in various ways by Giovanni Morelli, Sherlock Holmes, and Sigmund Freud, and which he referred to as the "indiciary paradigm."8 This tendency, with its rejection of appearances, its distrust of explicit and univocal messages, has remained dominant to this day; it is not restricted to the visual realm but the growing role of visual ambiguity in art and art history must be seen in its light. The theory and the practice of modern art have indeed been involved in this development and made ambiguity a central element of their relationship with the viewer. Two major moments of this evolution can be formulated with Odilon Redon's 1902 definition of the artist's "sense of mystery" as consisting in "continuous ambiguity, in the double and triple aspects (images within images), forms that are about to come into being or will take their being from the onlooker's state of mind," and with Marcel Duchamp's 1957 dictum: "It is the ONLOOKER who makes the pictures."9 Already at the end of the eighteenth century, the crisis of iconographical codes had encouraged the invention of "private" and ambiguous subjects.

This role of visual ambiguity has remained a central feature of Western art in the twentieth century, although it did not go unchallenged. Between the two World Wars, authoritarian attempts at returning art to the role of political instrument tried to obtain semantic univocality, while the Modernist opposition between abstraction and figuration contributed to what Leo Steinberg called retrospectively in 1968 its "interdictory stance?the attitude that tells an artist what he ought not to do, and the spectator what he ought not to see."10 In this context, the occultation by Robert Smithson of his "pre-conscious" works and the implicit relevance of their erotic imagery for his abstract Minimalist sculptures, as analyzed in this issue of Res by Caroline Jones, presents us with a fascinating case. In one sense, the cool geometry of Smithson's 1968 Gyrostasis does conceal the sexual impulse obvious in his Untitled (Hexagonal Center) of 1963. In another sense, however, and even if such a link was bound to remain hidden from observers unaware of the "pre-conscious" production, its "pure" geometry (or "dispassionate abstraction," as Smithson put it) brought this libidinous movement to a level of representational openness where identity and scale could fluctuate. This is the way in which Smithson himself described in 1972 the "vision" inspiring his celebrated earthwork Spiral Jetty in Great Salt Lake, Utah. As the artist was looking at the site, a "dormant earthquake" spread into "a spinning sensation without movement" and brought it to "an indeterminate state, where solid and liquid lost themselves in each other"; freed from the constraints of size, the spiral revealed an analogy between the chemical composition of the "primordial seas" and that of human blood, permitting a "return to our origins" and the access to a world where "ambiguities are admitted rather than rejected, contradictions are increased rather than decreased."11 In the following decades, the presence and importance of such associations for abstract art became increasingly part of its public discussion, for instance, with Anne Chave's studies of Rothko's paintings and of Minimalist sculpture.12 In parallel, contemporary artists have also increasingly played with ambiguities of abstraction and representation, resorting both to ancient techniques such as anamorphosis, invented in D?rer's time, and to new technical means such as digital images. The fact that the level of interest for ambiguous and hidden aspects varies historically and has tended to increase in the past decades does not therefore imply that it amounts to the arbitrary projection of forms and meanings onto innocent images. It does not mean that it is always equally justified and relevant either. According to Elkins, nothing allows us to distinguish between legitimate approaches and misguided interpretations, except the changing and relative consensus established between professionals. But the particularly hypothetical and subjective character of interpretations favoring what is ambiguous, implicit, and hidden call precisely for the definition and observation of criteria of relevance. In a study of "the functioning of ambiguity in the process of creation and interpretation of poetic language" published in 1948, Ernst Kris argued that lest it become "a game like finding shapes in the clouds and stars," interpretation "must have its stringencies just as does the original creation of the art work." He proposed three main sets of such stringencies, namely stringencies of subject matter or standards of correspondence (between the interpretation and information provided by the text and its references to shared knowledge); genetic standards or standards of intent (based on knowledge about the artist); and standards of coherence bearing on the interrelation of the elements of the interpretation.13 In 1957, Marcel Duchamp called "art coefficient" the "arithmetical relation between the unexpressed but intended and the unintentionally expressed," and the notion of "intention" has become notoriously problematic.14 But Kris, trained as a psychoanalyst as well as an art historian, was well aware of this fact, especially at a time that valued in creation what escapes the control of the artist?to whom Duchamp ascribed a 10.

Kris suggested that the multiple meanings essential to poetic effectiveness, rather than "clearly and distinctly present to the mind of either artist or audience," remain for the most part "'preconscious'? i.e., though not conscious they can become so with comparatively little effort if the interpretation becomes problematic at that point." Sidney Geist, on the other hand, affirmed that the "punning and cryptomorphic imagery" that he claimed to discover in Cezanne's works "must be considered unconscious products of [his] artistic activity" since the painter had never given any sign that he was aware of them.15 Locating the products of his own interpretive activity further away from the artist's consciousness but squarely within the "objective" properties of the artworks allowed Geist to escape a possibility of verification while sticking to a positivistic understanding of the relationship between subject and object, between creation, perception, and interpretation. In fact, it can be argued that Geist's idiosyncratic approach proceeds from a visual ambiguity effectively pursued by C?zanne, but that he arbitrarily selects, freezes, and objectifies some of its possible effects. This objectification is made patent in the manipulation of reproductions by means of diagrams, cutouts, and superpositions that Geist uses to support his argument. It is a tendency that eventually destroys the very ambiguity it started by drawing attention to it, and Elkins rightly notes the danger of "reductive cryptography: in place of the open-ended encounter with natural forms and pictorial meanings, a picture becomes a simple mechanism, deceptively encoding a single answer within an armature of distractions."16 The "hidden image" becomes in this way the negation of the "ambiguous image." Yet Jean-Didier Urbain has proposed a definition of it that does more justice to ambiguity: "the crypto-image is a sign that oscillates between the desire to be disclosed (to be an image) and the temptation of the void satisfied by utter effacement (being a non-image)."17 This dynamic oscillation is close to Gaston Bachelard's understanding of the fleeting images of the "aerial imagination," about which he wrote that "they either evaporate or crystallize. And it is between the two poles of this ever-active ambivalence that we must grasp them."18 For Henri Focillon, this open and metamorphic nature was characteristic of form itself, as opposed to the more static notions of image and of sign: "Form is enveloped in a halo. It is a rigorous definition of space, but also suggestive of other forms. It continues and extends itself in the imaginary, or rather we regard it as a fissure, through which we can introduce into an uncertain realm, no longer extending in space or thought, a mass of images aspiring to be born."19 Such a "suggestion" and "aspiration" were precisely what Redon had in mind when he defined the artist's role as that of organizing "forms that are about to come into being or will take their being from the onlooker's state of mind." The ideal of an oscillation between "evaporation" and "crystallization" is not limited to certain moments and aspects of Western art, but is, for instance, crucial for the history of Chinese art as well. The catalog of paintings in Emperor Hui-tsung's collection thus compared the work of the early twelfth-century artist Li Kung-nien (fig. 2) to "the shapes of objects appearing and disappearing in vast emptiness, hovering between existence and nothingness."20 One can speak here of a generic intention?that of stimulating the spectator's imaginative response?as opposed to a specific intention?that of conveying determined perceptions and interpretations. I propose to call "potential images" the instrument and the result of this type of aesthetic communication, which aims at and depends upon an active collaboration between artist, artwork, and "onlooker."21 In such a case, ambiguity must be preserved to do justice to the artist's stated intentions?

In any case, the interpreter must indicate what status is claimed for the interpretation, what degree of plausibility, probability, or certainty it is supposed to possess. On the genetic side, there are major differences even within what I have called generic intentions. The faces in D?rer's View of Arco are now generally recognized to be part of the watercolor (and not only of some commentators' perception of it), but the fact that they could go so long unnoticed (or at least unexpressed) is itself significant. By contrast, the human features of many later anthropomorphic landscapes or the elements building up Arcimboldo's composite heads cannot be missed, and anamorphoses refer to a determined point of view from which their chaos (which can be fascinating in its own terms) suddenly reveals a clear image. In an analogous way, Thierry Dufr?ne recently opposed Alberto Giacometti's "undecidable images" to the multiple images devised by Salvador Dal?, who occasionally succumbed to the temptation of demonstrating their mechanics with the help of diagrams and superpositions.22 Ambiguity is not specific to images, and it has been studied more systematically in the linguistic and literary domain.23 The visual realm, however, provides it with particular means and possibilities. Martine Joly attributes to the lack of assertiveness of the image (that is, its inability to affirm or deny independently, without relying on verbal language) an effect of polysemy, which can be deliberately increased, by images hidden within images and in the case of nonfigurative images.24 I have insisted on the historical variability of the sensitivity toward visual ambiguity, but some evidence of it seems to be present in every culture, so that one may speak of an anthropological invariant at this level. It is predicated upon the fact that visual perception is in itself an act of interpretation, implying the selection of information and its organization and identification with the help of 22.

This conclusion of the psychology of perception has been confirmed by the recent development of the cognitive sciences, and experimental research has shown that newborns already possess the ability to recognize a face in schematic patterns.25 Ernst Kris referred to "finding shapes in the clouds and stars" as a "recreation" in a negatively superficial (or subjective) sense, but this "game" has been crucial to the observation and interpretation of the natural world. Bachelard thus wrote that "the Zodiac is the Rorschach test of infant humanity," and Gordon Hewes has argued that "the propensity of human beings to see in the manifold forms of plant and animal anatomy parallels of an iconic kind may be extremely old," as shown by their names as well as those of rivers, mountains, and even man-made tools.26 The inherently ambiguous configurations of rocks, which tend to offer a perceptual continuum to which the eye must actively give a shape, are particularly rich in this respect, and their names and nicknames attest this from the oldest preserved testimonies to the present (fig. 3). According to the current interpretation of the "Makapansgat cobble," found in 1925 in South Africa, this propensity even predates humans: the red ferrous pebble was discovered several miles from any possible geological source in a cave occupied by Australopiteci, and it must have been selected and transported by one of them about three million years ago because of its color and its (striking) accidental resemblance to a face.27 It is generally agreed that the perception of 25.

Breuil and in 1926 by the psychologist G.-H. Luquet (fig. 4). Imaginative or projective perception has also been associated with the origins of writing.

Commenting on this connection, Anne-Marie Christin emphasizes that unlike language, the image needs only an observer rather than "the co-presence of transmitter and receiver" and suggests that divination made the invention of writing possible by rationalizing images: "By inventing reading as a means of understanding the visual messages from the gods, the soothsayer gave us access to writing."33 Particularly ambiguous natural objects and configurations retained a strong interest for creators of images, as a way to decipher the world and to stimulate human invention. Just as Alberti had spoken of "a tree trunk, a clump of earth and other similar objects," in the early seventeenth century the Dutch draughtsman Jacob de Gheyn II, who had designed a grotto for the Court of Orange and was deeply involved in naturalist observation, selected confused combinations of rock and vegetation in which he could discover heads of humans, animals, or demons (fig. 5). The invention of these faces may have started mentally in front of the natural motif, but it undoubtedly expanded in the process of drawing itself and must be continued as well as recreated in the process of viewing, since there is no clear indication about how many heads are included and of what it takes to make one of them. Such multiple readings of visual reality corresponded to an understanding of natura naturans as a continuous birth of forms and images that has analogies with the Far Eastern conceptions expressed by landscape paintings such as Li Kung-nien's Winter Landscape.34 This understanding was in a sense revived and renewed in the West by the Romantic Naturphilosophie, with far-reaching effects on the development of modern art. To return to the inspiration by "natural" visual ambiguity, it is, for instance, significant that the same kind of mixture of rock and vegetation was later favored by Courbet for his most audacious "pure" landscape paintings in the Valley of the Loue, and by C?zanne at the turn of the century in the park at Ch?teau Noir. Romanticism, on the other hand, challenged the notion of art as imitation and argued that the artist had to work like nature, not after nature. This idea was adopted by Courbet and by many others, especially during the Symbolist period. Gauguin, for instance, wrote that artists are instruments used by nature for a "continuation of creation."35 This move from imitation to emulation allowed the artistic process itself, more or less independently from the observation of an exterior reality, to take advantage of the suggestive power of the support, the materials, and the progressive elaboration of form.36 Leonardo had already mentioned artificial productions among the objects triggering the imagination and explained the advantage of the "rough sketch" {componimento inculto) by the fact that 31.

Little is known of these practices, and a few preserved and published examples of amateur drawings and collages attest the existence of creative activities and techniques that would find a more public and enhanced status in the guise of "Surrealist games."39 In some cases such as spiritualistic drawings or Justinus Kerner's "klecksographies," a connection with techniques of divination and metaphysical or parapsychological pursuits is evident. In many other cases, it appears only indirectly and in weakened form, such as the etymological presence of the devin (soothsayer) in the devinette (puzzle). But the valuation of the materials' role in artistic creation which developed in the course of the nineteenth century and the truth-to-the-materials aesthetic that emerged out of it tend to attribute to "inanimate matter" an agency that is close to the communicative or revelatory power it possesses in divination as well as to the artist's own "mediumistic role" (according to Duchamp). This link occasionally surfaces in verbal formulations, as when Redon declared in 1913: "Matter reveals secrets, it has its own genius; it is through matter that the oracle will speak."40 But it was for Surrealism to express the existential dimension of this affinity between artistic creation and divination. In L'amour fou, published in 1937, Andr? Breton proposed the reading of images in clouds as a model for the interpretation of reality and for the determination of one's course of action.41 He described imaginative perception as capable of being shared, and defended Polonius' assent to the changing images indicated by Hamlet (the camel, the weasel, and the whale) on the ground that far from being meaningless, these three successive identifications expressed the "deep psychological motives" behind the prince's actions. The relative passivity and disinterestedness needed for such a perception seemed to him characteristic of invention at large and he affirmed that "the stroke of luck, the happiness of the scientist or the artist when they find can only be seen as a special case of human happiness . . . Man will know how to direct himself the day when, like the painter, he is willing to reproduce faithfully what an appropriate screen can deliver to him in advance of his actions." This revelation requires the ambiguity of the visible world and Breton writes that "the objects of reality do not exist only as such" but give birth to puzzle pictures that inform us of our desire. One year later, the Dictionnaire illustr? du surr?alisme reproduced a turn-of-the-century postcard ? la Arcimboldo (fig. 6) which found echoes in a multiple image of birds by Max Ernst and in the implicit reference to dream images of the entry "Sleep." If one follows Breton's rehabilitation of the dialogue between Hamlet and Polonius, the "game like finding shapes in the clouds and stars" opposed by Kris to serious interpretation is anything but superficial. It can be seen instead as a "serious game" in the Renaissance sense and as a model of hermeneutics?which does not mean that, like all games, it should not have rules. 37.
