<plain_text><page sequence="1">CROSS RIVER ART STYLES KEITH NICKLIN* JILL SALMONS Nowadays it is the custom among many writers on African art to adopt the fashion of social an- thropologists in addressing their in- quiries to a specific ethnolinguistic group, community, or cult. On account of the unique nature of our cir- cumstances in southeast Nigeria during the greater part of the 1970s, we were able not only to adopt this approach to a certain degree both in the Ibibio Palm Belt and among the Ejagham and Ejagham-related peoples of the forest area, but also to develop a broader, com- parative methodology with respect to the Cross River culture area as a whole. In this article we identify a number of in- digenous art styles primarily within and bordering upon that area today desig- nated as Nigeria's Cross River State. Par- ticular attention is drawn to incidences of stylistic interaction between different ethnolinguistic groups, to the role of the individual artist in creating new styles and elaborating upon established ones, and to the influence of particular mas- querade associations and cults. Each of these considerations has been seminal in African art scholarship for more than a decade.' From the vantage point of first-hand ethnographic investigation, we intend to add a new perspective to some recent studies of Cross River art (including Wittmer &amp; Arnett 1978, Blier 1980, Schlidler 1982). First, some of the better-known genres of sculpture in the Cross River area should be identified. Among the Ibibio, face masks are widely used, especially for the men's ancestral spirit association, Ekpo (see Simmons 1957, Messenger 1973). These Ekpo masks comprise ugly (idiok) (Fig. 1) and fair (mfon) (Fig. 2) types; the former are wandering spirits, and the latter are spirits that have reached safe haven in the afterlife. In de- scribing Ibibio art as "more homogene- ous" than that of the Igbo, William Fagg (1967) does not do justice to its great di- versity of forms and styles, not all of which are represented even in major col- lections such as that of the British Mu- seum. Many specimens of Ekpo mask that have been described as Ibibio in fact emanate from the Annang, the most tal- ented and prolific of artists from the Ibibio-speaking area (Fig 3). In shrines of the diviners' society Idiong and in performances of the Ekong puppet play (Fig. 6) (e.g., Jeffreys 1951, Messenger 1962), wooden figures are used by the Ibibio (Fig. 7). According to Kenneth Murray, "Ibibio (figure) carving is constantly altering in style but the modern work is less bold in shape than the old" (1951: 323). Among the Oron people of southern Ibibioland (Murray 1947 and forthcom- ing), carved figures, Ekpu, represent the ancestors (Fig. 5). There is a marked con- tinuity of artistic expression between many of these Oron sculptures, which are thought to include some of the oldest woodcarvings in Sub-Saharan Africa, and the style of Eket sculpture described by Neyt (1979b) as proto-Ibibio. Moreover, the oldest specimens of Ibibio art show certain stylistic affinities with many Ekpu figures. Until now there has been a tendency, started by Kenneth Murray and furthered principally by Fagg, to overemphasize the uniqueness of Oron art vis-a-vis that of the Ibibio as a whole. 1.

Among the Ejagham and their neighbors, traditional associations, es- pecially of warriors and hunters, utilize skin-covered masks. Upper (Fig. 4), middle (Figs. 9, 12), and lower (Fig. 13) Cross River styles within this genre have been described (Nicklin 1979), and one notes a general tendency away from naturalism the further inland the masks are found. Among the hoe cultivators of the mid- dle Cross River, notably the Mbembe, Yak6, Biase, and Bahumuno peoples, are found mighty monoxylous slit-drums with human figures or heads carved at either end, and freestanding pillars dec- orated with carving in low relief and in the round. These objects are associated with the periodic rites of the farming cycle. There are stylistic correspon- dences on the one hand with much of the large-scale Ejagham sculpture illustrated by Mansfeld (1908) and Talbot (1912), and on the other with that of the Cross River Igbo groups between Umuahia and Abakaliki. Absent from recent publica- tions are descriptions of gigantic war drums, Ikorok (Annang and Ika) or Ikoro (Igbo). In these drums the head is often carved at one end and the feet at the other, with the body of the instrument decorated with low-relief carving (Fig. 10). Some groups of the former Ogoja Pro- vince, including Ekajuk, Abanyom, Nta, Nselle, and Nnam, used basalt river boulders carved with human features to commemorate deceased "priest-chiefs" or "divine kings" (Allison 1968a, 1968b). These monoliths were called Akwanshi by the Nta, Nselle, and Nde (Fig. 8). Throughout the forest region, copper-alloy cire-perdue iastings, fre- quently of anthropomorphic and zoomorphic form, are found. The hypothesis that these were produced in eastern Igboland and distributed by Aro traders (Neaher 1979a) would appear to be an over-simplification, in view of the fact that there is increasing evidence for some manufacture by indigenous Cross River peoples, who perhaps learned the 4.

Many of the Cross River bronzes represent tutel- ary deities controlling agricultural and human fertility, and were in the guardianship of spiritual leaders of the communities where they were found. A summary of new data concerning the Cross River bronzes has recently ap- peared (Nicklin 1982). These sculptural genres are seen in two major stylistic provinces in Cross River State: the area to the south and west falls within that geographical re- gion known as the Palm Belt, while the area to the north and east, primarily a forested environment, belongs to the Cross River Basin. Ibibio sculpture, in- cluding that of Oron, is in the Palm Belt, while skin-covered masks, massive wooden sculptures, and monoliths and bronzes occur mainly in the Cross River Basin. Although certain traits are distinc- tive of each area, there is much evidence of the interchange of influences between the two zones. The Cross, Kwa Ibo, and Calabar rivers, plus various overland routes-some long distance despite the difficulty of the terrain-have long pro- vided trading links and thoroughfares for the peoples of southeastern Nigeria and western Cameroon. For example, the practice of covering a wooden mask with skin has diffused from the forest area into the Palm Belt in relation to spe- cific masquerade groups, especially Ikem. Nowadays some of the remotest settlements on the Cross River and even further afield have felt the impact of An- nang and Ibibio carvers (Fig. 11). In addition, there have been instances of stylistic interaction with all areas bor- dering on Cross River State; we will note some of these here, drawing special at- tention to the relationship of artwork to cult group. For example, various au- thorities have attested to the connection between certain masks of the Niger Delta and the Ibibio Ekpo masks. According to William Fagg, "Comparative study of the Ogoni and Ibibio styles in masks suggests a close identity of culture, some types being virtually indistinguishable, although each has some types which the other lacks, such as certain Ogoni masks which are smaller than the wearer's face" (1965: 54).2 One type of Annang Ekpo mask, a form with articulated lower jaw and goat horns from Utu Etim Ekpo, near Abak, greatly resembles some Ogoni masks (Fig. 18). That it is possible to identify influences of a par- ticular village should not be surprising when one bears in mind that sometimes even the particular artist involved in the diffusion of an art style is known. One of the foremost Annang carvers of the pre- sent century was Akpan Chukwu of Utu Etim Ekpo, who is known to have traveled to Ogoni and Kalabari country in order to carve there on commission.3 G.I. Jones maintains that "Anang (Kwa Ibo) figures look very different from their masks and are similar in style to those of the neighbouring Ogoni. Ogoni masks have no resemblance to Anang masks and are used in different maskerades" (1973: 60). We would say, rather, that some Annang masks resemble some Annang figures and that some Annang figures look like some Ogoni ones, just as there is an affinity between the mask styles of the same groups in the way that Fagg has pointed out for the Ogoni and Ibibio, irrespective of divergencies in function. A degree of stylistic uniformity exists among masks and figures in the border areas of eastern Igboland and western Ibibioland (Fig. 16). Carvings among such groups as the Ika, whose center is at Urua Inyang in the vicinity of the Igbo border, are often difficult to ascribe to either Igbo or Ibibio styles. There are several examples of the impact of Ibibo art on that of the Igbo, though few of Igbo upon Ibibio. Murray describes Ibibio influence on the Ogbom fertility 5. ORON EKPU FIGURE.

CROSS RIVER MONOLITH AT ALOK, NNAM, IKOM. carvings of Bende, and diffusion of the "Ekpo-type" mask into various parts of Igboland "via Arochuku, Ohafia or Abiriba, the gateways by which Cross River influences come to Ibo. Another group of Ekpo-type masks which is prob- ably fairly ancient in origin is used in plays which are performed for Ala and Kamanu in a few of the Ngwa villages in Aba: the inspiration for these masks probably came from the Kwa Ibo area" (Murray, n.d.). The Kwa Ibo River itself was an important trade route between the Igbo and Ibibio, through which stylistic influences diffused. (See Neyt 1979b concerning the art of the Eket Ibibio.) Recent Ibibio influence is appa- rent in some of the new masks of the Ngwa area illustrated by Amankulor (1977). In his study of Afikpo art, Otten- berg describes Ibibio masks bought by Afikpo visitors in Ibibioland or copied at home (1975: 22). To this day, descendants of Akpan Chukwu in Utu Etim Ekpo are frequently commissioned to produce carvings for various Igbo groups. As Cole points out: "Competitive people, the Ibo are great borrowers and inventors who have sel- dom been satisfied with inherited mask- ing traditions. They have challenged their artists to innovate and have bor- rowed styles and even carvings from neighboring peoples" (1970: 30). In Bos- ton's study of northern Igbo mas- querades, influences are suggested to have come not only from other Igbo areas, but also from Ijaw, Igala, and Nupe (1960). Perhaps Murray made the clearest comment upon this aspect of Igbo art: "Variety and eclecticism are fea- tures of Igbo art. It has borrowed from most of the neighbouring tribes: masks of Ekpo style from the Cross River area, horned, semi-human faces from the Ijaw, others carried on top of the head from the Ogoja tribes, head-dresses with many figures from (probably) the Yoruba" (1951: 324). Equally important, however, is the ex- tent to which the Ekpo cult, as opposed to the mask style, has failed to diffuse from Ibibioland. Ekpo is the principal se- cret society for men among the Ibibio- speaking peoples. The name is also applied to the ancestral spirits. During an annual ceremonial cycle younger members of the cult personify these spirits, temporarily returned to the land of the living. The name Ekpo also refers to the corporate group of cult members having a number of political, legislative, judicial, and religious functions in vil- lage life. At least among the Ibibio proper, it is a graded association. In the traditional system, every Ibibio village had its own Ekpo lodge and associated grove where the major rituals were per- formed (see Forde &amp; Jones 1967). From the admittedly scant informa- tion available, it would appear that al- though the Andoni and the Ogoni of the eastern Niger Delta have Ekpo-type 9. GROTESQUE SKIN-COVERED JANUS-FACED CAP MASK. ABU, BOKYI, IKOM. 31</page><page sequence="5">masks with the articulated lower jaw, they do not employ them in any context resembling that of the Ibibio Ekpo cult. The Ika, whose culture is in many re- spects very similar to that of the Ibibio, insist that they are niot Ibibio because they lack Ekpo. Nearby peoples, in- cluding the Yako of Obubra, and some Cross River Igbo groups refer to masked Ekpo figures in tales of conflict with the Ibibio in the distant past. The Ekpo cult, Ibibio elders say today, is something that they have had from time immemorial - "as long as we have had ancestors." The cult is in fact one of the deepest expres- sions of traditional Ibibio culture, a vital aspect of being Ibibio. The situation with regard to the Cross River leopard cult-Ekpe (Efik), Ngbe (Ejagham), or Egbo (pidgin English)-is quite different. Ekpe is a powerful and prestigious men's association based upon the invocation of the leopard spirit (see the article by Elliott Leib and Renee Romano, p. 48). In the case of the Ibibio Ekpe association, in the past it had vital institutional functions, some of which are still retained in both rural and urban communities. Ekpe is much concerned 11 MASK PREPARED FOR FUNERARY MASQUERADE GAKEM, OGOJA 12 SOUTHERN ETUNG JANUS-FACED SKIN-COVERED HELMET MASK FOR WARRIORS ASSOCIATION. 10. ANNANG IKOROK DRUM WITH LOW RELIEF CARVING. with the control of village affairs, and chiefs and elders are often senior mem- bers of Ekpe, using its authority to en- force decisions affecting the whole com- munity. Younger members provide an able-bodied force useful in policing the village and undertaking communal tasks such as land clearance. Although proba- bly originating among the Ejagham, the association is widely distributed among the scattered communities of the Cross River: it is a major medium through which important social, ritual, and commercial transactions operate, and has had a unifying effect among peoples whose traditional system rarely ac- knowledged political authority beyond the village level. The masquerade costumes of the vari- ous grades or sections of Ekpe are each distinctive, but all usually have a tight- fitting garment of woven string with horizontal colored bands, which covers the entire body except for hands and feet, and ruffs of unwoven raffia around the neck, wrists, and ankles (see p. 49). Often a feather rod hangs down over the face from a topknot, and a hat-like struc- ture is frequently worn over the shoul- ders at the back. A bell is tied to the waist, and the masquerader sometimes carries a large staff or a whip of hip- popotamus hide. Members meet regu- larly for convivial feasting and informal discussion. On ceremonial occasions Ekpe performs dramatic masquerades, when members seek to outdo each other in nsibidi mime displays to test esoteric Ekpe lore. Nsibidi is a phenomenon of se- cret communication expressed through 13. JANUS-FACED HELMET MASK.

It is a time of great enjoyment as well as a time when the basic norms and mores of the community are symbolically affirmed. Performances in the Ekwe Ejagham and Banyang areas have been graphically de- scribed and analyzed by R.F. Thompson (1974: 172-87). Ngbe originated among the Ejagham and was adopted by the Efik in Calabar, where it came to assume new functions and attained its greatest prestige and power. In its new form-comprising several grades and having the authority to impose fines and collect debts-the leopard spirit cult diffused back into the forest hinterland outside Calabar. It had become a "purchasable institution" (Ruel 1969: 250ff.), as paraphernalia was bought from one village by another. In the upper Cross River the acquisition of lodges and addition of further grades of Ngbe to those already established were still continuing during the period of Mal- colm Ruel's fieldwork in the 1950s. Al- though the existence of "the Old Calabar Egbo type" of Ekpe in Ibibioland in 1947 is noted by Jones (1968: 136), it is proba- bly fair to say that on account of the all- pervading power of the Ekpo cult here, the adoption of Ekpe by the Ibibio peoples seems to have been a spasmodic process, and often not long lasting. Only at a few sites in Ibibioland have major Ekpe lodges been long established; sev- eral were moribund by the 1970s. In Oron, however, Ekpe seems to have been the major male cult at the advent of the colonial era. This might be accounted for by the existence of important com- mercial links with Calabar and by the ab- sence of the usual form of Ekpo found elsewhere in southern Ibibio country. Among the Igbo in the late 1940s the name Ekpe or Ekkpe was given to a tradi- tional association quite unrelated to the leopard spirit cult. G.I. Jones describes this as "an earlier society still surviving in the Ndokki (Ibo) area, elsewhere only remembered by the carved heads worn in its play which are still preserved in some villages" (1968: 136). This institu- tion was encountered by Kenneth Mur- ray in the Igbo localities of Aba, Bende, Aro, eastern Owerri, and Orlu. It is con- nected with the farming cycle and is per- formed, depending on the area, at the New Yam festival (i.e., harvest), before the planting season, or during the plant- ing season. Men and women participate in the Igbo Ekpe dance. Murray believed that Ekpe might originally have employed fabric masks, as some were still in use in Aba and Owerri at the time of his survey. Later, carved wooden forms-headdresses or cap masks rather than face masks-were adopted from other peoples. G.I. Jones has com- mented upon the remarkably diverse 15. JANUS-FACED SKIN-COVERED HELMET MASK FOR ENYATU ASSOCIATION, BY CHIEF THOMAS ACHAGWU OGWOGWO OF EZEKWE, UKELLE, OGOJA. 33</page><page sequence="7">stylistic range of these Ekpe masks (1973: 62-63). Both Jones and Murray draw at- tention to representations of the elephant spirit and those of the "beauti- ful maiden." Murray points out that some of the latter include skin-covered cap masks of the "horn" coiffure type, in Ibibio style. In fact the Ibibio copied this style from the Efut of Calabar, who in turn might well have been copying an Ejagham prototype. The occurrence in Igboland of this type of mask, which the Ibibio and Efut use in entertainment performances of the Ikem masquerade group, has been the source of a serious and oft-repeated error in many descriptions of Cross River skin-covered sculpture: the Igbo crop fertility cult, Ekpe or Ekkpe, has become confused in the literature with the Cross River leopard cult, Ekpe or Ngbe. It has become habitual among many collectors and scholars to apply the cult term Ekpe or Ekkpe to any skin-covered mask, ir- respective of its form, function, style, and actual provenance within the overall area of distribution of the genre. A case in point is the skin-covered horn- coiffure cap mask illustrated on the cover of a recent issue of African Arts (vol. 14, no. 4, 1981), said to be an "Ekkpe society dance headdress. Efik, Cross River area, Nigeria." The piece in question is proba- bly Ikem. During the course of our field-work in the 1970s we did not en- counter any convincing evidence for the use of skin-covered masks by the leopard spirit cult, although this does seem to have occurred in the past (Talbot 1912: 44). The entertainment masquerade called Ikem typically employs one or two skin- covered cap masks with the horn coif- fure. The mask style seems to have dif- fused from the Ejagham area in the late nineteenth century to the Efut area of Creek Town, Calabar, and then to Ibibio- land in the first decade of the present century. Diffusion was by a variety of modes: by artists sitting at the feet of ac- complished masters of the new carving style, by outright purchase to boost the prestige of wealthy men, and by copy- ing. Much change and elaboration took place as the masks and accompanying songs and dances were tailored to local needs. Today Ikem is still performed in the Ika village of Urua Inyang, where it replaces Ekpo as the chief institution of popular cultural expression (Figs. 20, 21). Ikem is no longer fashionable in most parts of Ibibioland, but in places where its dances and songs have died out it sometimes continues as a mask style only, often in contexts quite unrelated to the original performance.4 The skin-covered mask genre pro- vides us with further examples of trans- formations of style and function that occur during the diffusion process. The Bangwa of Cameroon lie at the east- ernmost distribution of skin-covered masks (Figs. 14, 17). As Robert Brain points out, the Bangwa are a Bamileke group, basically "'grassfields' but enjoy- ing the exuberant masquerades of the Cross River" (1972: 3). They have large helmet masks used by the Royal society (Fig. 14), and cap masks used by the Challenge groups (Brain &amp; Pollock 1971). Admitting that "skin-covered masks were probably not an original element of Bangwa culture," Brain maintains that "a genuine adaption of the Ekoi Cross River style has been made," thus creating a distinctively Bangwa mask form (1980: 106). Also in Cameroon are the Widekum of the upper Cross River area, who excel in the production of cap masks and domed face masks (Fig. 24)5. (Probable examples in the more recent literature include Wittmer 1977: 59, pl. 97; Blier 1980: no. 11; Schidler 1982: 28, pl. 14.) Stephen Ndansi Fonbmeng of Kesom in the Cen- tral Osum area of Widekum specializes in the production of skin-covered domed face masks and carved stools. He also makes a type of cow mask, which, al- though having what appear to be eyeholes, is worn on top of the head, in the manner of the Grassfields masks. Some of them have the Cross River trait of a skin covering. Mask styles are not invariably trans- formed, even when they diffuse widely. One such example is that of the anti- witchcraft cult, Obassi-Njom (Basinjom, Obasinjom). The mask, worn on top of the head and decorated with a striking fan of blue and yellow feathers, is a stylized representation of the crocodile. During the Obassi-Njom performance the masquerader, wearing a long blue gown onto which are sewn a variety of charms, moves about the village in a weird, gliding fashion, searching out witchcraft. He speaks in an esoteric tongue that is interpreted to the audi- ence by an assistant, and bearers with 16. CAP MASK OF KWA IBO STYLE. NATIONAL MUSEUM, ORON. RIGHT 17.

When not in use Obassi-Njom paraphernalia are usually stored in the Ngbe hall. The leaders of Obassi-Njom possess titles of office and constitute the most senior grade. There are usually three to four grades, and entry into any of these entails payment of specific fees and initiation. Excellent descriptions of the cult are provided by Ruel (1969) and R.F. Thompson (1974). Citing evidence provided by Talbot, Thompson believes Basinjom (the term used east of the Nigeria-Cameroon bor- der) to have had an ancient Ejagham ori- gin, emerging in about 1909 in the Ejagham town of Oban under the name Akpambe. By 1930 the cult had spread to the Ekwe Ejagham in Cameroon (Thompson 1974: 210). Although Ken- neth Murray believed Obassi-Njom to be in decline in Ikom when he visited the area in 1948 (Murray n.d.), during the 1970s the cult was widespread and active in many locations in Ejagham and Bokyi territory. Some Etung villages still pos- sess Obassi-Njom paraphernalia, but it is seldom used, the cult having been dis- credited at some time in the 1960s when a member of the Jehovah's Witness church threw a masquerader to the ground in a deliberate act of sacrilege. Although some crude renderings of Obassi-Njom masks do undoubtedly oc- cur, there appear to be little significant variation in style within this genre and little diversity in costume. We are not aware of other forms of sculpture that have been influencedby the Obassi- Njom stylized crocodile mode, despite the fact that more realistic crocodile cap masks, some covered with skin and em- bellished with representations of horns, and sometimes crowns, are seen in the lower Cross River. In the Ogoja area of Cross River State, especially in Ukelle and Igedde country, there is what may be described as an im- portant northwestward extension of the middle Cross River style of skin-covered masks. Works from this area in collec- tions and publications are usually given an "Ekoi" or Ejagham provenance, as in the case of two typical Ukelle cap masks (Rubin 1976: no. 28; Wittmer &amp; Arnett 1978: 79, no. 185). A horned animal cap mask (Kamer 1976: no. 33) and a gro- tesque male head (Schiidler 1982: 16, pl. 2) are also from this northwestern area. Probably the greatest living master of the skin-covered mask genre in Nigeria is Thomas Achagwu Ogwogwo of Ezekwe in the Ukelle area. He still pro- duces masks in the old Ukelle style (Fig. 15), but more often he is commissioned to make masks decorated with bright enamel paints (Fig. 19), their complex superstructures forming tableaux con- taining topical subjects like the schoolteacher, court clerk, policeman, and Mammy Watta; airplanes are also popular. Such carvings have been desig- nated as Igbo or Ibibio in some publica- tions (Sieber &amp; Vevers 1974: no. 36: Blier 1980: 24, no. 59). More recently, they have been identified as "probably Ejagham," with surmounting figure groups derived from an Igbo source (Wittmer &amp; Arnett 1978: 77, no. 181). Thomas Lukpata of Obatebi-Wanihem lives within a day's walking distance of Ogwogwo and also works in the Ukelle style.6 He produces skin-covered masks of the older style as well as forms that will not be found in previous publications on this genre. Like Og- wogwo he makes what his customers 20. SKIN-COVERED MALE CAP MASK WITH HORN COIF- FURE BY IKA ARTIST NWA NKWA. LEFT 21.

The Ukelle area was almost completely de- nuded of artworks in the period follow- ing the Nigerian Civil War, soit is difficult to find old pieces in context. Neverthe- less our surveys did bring to light a vari- ety of old carvings, which, interestingly, bore minimal stylistic affinity to each other or to other known styles (Fig. 25). In the Ogoja area there is a distinctive amalgam of Igbo and Cross River forest traits with relation to masks of the Abakpa and Enyatu masquerades. The janus-faced helmet mask form, one face light, the other dark, with tribal marks of the "target" type (a series of concentric circles) on the temples and sometimes on the forehead, is a characteristic feature of the Cross River; but as Vevers points out (Sieber &amp; Vevers 1974: no. 36), "the loop- ing curves of the superstructure are also found on Ibo Maiden Spirit masks." Such masks also frequently have an Igbo style of coiffure and a comb depicted on the forehead, as well as an Igbo mode of facial decoration, sometimes of the Maiden Spirit type. We believe that many of the Enyatu and Abakpa masks now in use in the Bekwarra, Ekajuk, and Nkim areas of Ogoja were made by the Igbo artist Gab- riel Akpabio, who died during the Ni- gerian Civil War (Figs. 22, 27). He ap- pears to have influenced other artists in the Ogoja and Ikom areas, notably Pat- rick Adeh Achong, an Mbube artist who makes helmet masks of the Akpabio type in localities where the master once worked (Figs. 23, 28). Janus-faced cap masks of the Akpabio school, some pos- sibly by Gabriel himself and others by imitators, are found further afield in the Ikom area, for example in southern Etung territory. A janus-faced helmet mask by an imitator of Akpabio, possibly the early Patrick Achong, is described as "Middle Cross River (Ibo?)" (Wittmer &amp; Arnett 1978: 77, no. 183), and another mask of the same school, but different form, has been incorrectly given an Ibibio provenance (African Arts, vol. 8, no. 3, 1975, p. 3). Further examples of masks combining Igbo and Cross River forest features exist in the Ikom area, as seen in a set of three masks used in the Elam masquerade of the Abanyom people. The finest of these is said to have been carved by the late Aturi Okuri of Abankang (Fig. 29). This piece could be viewed as a Cross River interpretation of the Igbo style seen in the domed face masks of the Onitsha Igbo and those, called Ikorodo, of the Igbo of the Nsukka area (Cole 1970: pls. 70, 72). Igbo features include the curved superstructure and style of the face, with narrow slit-eyes, almost semicircular ears set well forward, and pointed, nar- row nose and chin. The helmet form, target marks, and central incisor defor- mation are Cross River features. The two other Abanyom masks are by another artist, said to be Omorigbe of Edor vil- lage (Figs. 30, 31). In the Igbo community of Nchoko near Abakaliki in Anambra State exist the 25. CAP MASK. UKELLE, OGOJA. 36</page><page sequence="10">26. OSANG ABANG WITH TWO HELMET MASKS HE MADE.

These are said to have been made by a local man, Mbeke Obodo, who died in the mid- 1950s. At least eight of the masks remain, among them a triple-faced helmet mask called Asukwa, with both Igbo and Cross River facial markings and the central in- cisor deformation of the latter area (Fig. 32); a domed face mask called Ezen- wanyi, described as senior wife of Asukwa; and a female cap mask called Nwangboko, the daughter of Asukwa. The variety within this group of masks is remarkable. The people maintain that until recently they possessed skin- covered masks by the same carver. Nchoko was formerly administered under Izzi local authority, but is now under Abakaliki. As Cole writes, "Izzi masks and headdresses echo Ekoi (or Ejagham) style but are distinct from it" (1970: 31). The people of Nchoko "main- tain that they migrated to their present site on the Ogoja-Abakaliki road only a few generations ago, from Amagu, be- tween Abakaliki and Afikpo. Nchoko also possesses examples of a cap mask in the stylized form of an elephant, called Ogbodo Enyi, worn by men and boys during the New Yam festi- val in August and another annual cere- mony in February (Fig. 33). Specimens of this style have been described as "Riverine Igbo" and "Wawa" in publica- tions over the last decade or so. An example of an Ogbodo Enyi mask is given the provenance of Odomoke vil- lage, Izzi, by Cole (who calls it Obodoenyi; 1970: 31, pl. 67).7 Wittmer and Arnett cite Cole's Izzi provenance with regard to a northeastern Igbo "hori- zontal animal headdress mask" of the same style in the Arnett collection (1978: 30-31). Finally, according to Neyt, "The northeast region of the Igbo, that of the Izi, Ikwo and Ezza, is without doubt, an important corridor that, particularly by way of the Cross River, integrates the in- fluences of the region of Ikom with the Ibibio, even perhaps the Eket, not to mention the Mbembe Osopong to the east and the Idoma to the north" (1979a: 44; our translation). Obudu Local Government Area, lying between Ogoja and the Cameroon bor- der in northeastern Cross River State, has been much neglected in African art studies. In 1976 we collected three carv- ings from Eyo Okpa, an artist who had for a number of years been a night watchman at Obudu Cattle Ranch, a short distance from his Becheve village of Kejuko. Eyo said that he saw carvings in the Becheve area when young and learned to carve by watching another art- ist, Essa, at work in the Becheve village of Kalumo. Essa came to Balagete, one day's trek from Kejuko. Eyo's work bears no relationship to any style known to us, except for an apparently fortuitous re- 27. ABAKPA HELMET MASK BY GABRIEL AKPABIO. BEKWARRA, OGOJA 37</page><page sequence="11">semblance in the configuration of the mouth to that of some multiheaded male Ijaw figures of the Niger Delta. More likely stylistic affinities, such as Tiv or Mambilla, are not to be found in Eyo's work. When we first met Eyo Okpa, we thought that his sculpture bore rather doubtful relationship to his people's tra- ditions, especially as he sold pieces at a small store sometimes visited by expat- riates, though the artist maintained that the carvings were of the type used in local shrines and carried in a dance called Jonboko. Eyo Okpa's son, Johnson Eyo, makes masks and figures that are totally different in style and form: they are more realistic than those of his father, and of little artistic merit. Since much of Obudu was severely depleted of indigenous art in the 1970s by the activities of Cameroo- nian traders, it was not possible to relate Eyo Okpa's work to extant styles in the field for some time. In 1978, however, we conducted further fieldwork in the Obudu area. In a village of the Utanga people, a group of three carvings made by Eyo Okpa were in possession of the Oyumane masquerade group. These 28. ENYATU MASQUERADE ENSEMBLE. MASKS BY PATRICK ACHONG OF ODAJIE-MBUBE, OGOJA. comprised a staff carried by the leader of the group, a human-figure cap mask, and a janus-faced helmet mask with superstructure (Fig 37). The Utanga village of Bagga and the nearby Becheve village of Ikwette yielded pieces that showed recent Tiv in- fluence. At Bagga the Alom, or cow dance, employs a carving of a cow's head with articulated lower jaw, which is op- erated from the body of the animal made of a cane structure covered with plant fiber (Fig 34). The dance, which we saw performed by children, is said to have been introduced over a decade earlier by Antile, who was the father of the village head. Although informants maintained that it was not imitated from any other example, but rather invented locally, we feel compelled to draw parallels with the Tiv Kwagh-hir theater of the towns of Gboko, Makurdi, and Katsina-Ala (e.g., Enem 1976). The Alom carvings were said to have been made by Atom of Utanga. A schoolboy, Acha Utoga, pro- duced the smaller carving. Formerly the Alom ensemble numbered more than a dozen and included representations of crocodiles, a father and daughter, and a harlot; the play used to take a whole day to perform. In 1978 only the cow-head carvings survived, as the others had been destroyed in a fire at Bagga in 1977. A carving similar to the Bagga cow heads was seen at Akwaya, a small Olite set- tlement next to the Becheve people, just over the border in Cameroon. The Becheve and Utanga people had many plays in the past, including Odelli and Oyuka masquerades, which now appear largely to have died out. Most of the Tiv type of dances that they perform today do not incorporate masks; these include Obechi and Ajor. The people of Bagga said that a native of their own vil- lage, Thomas Agbor, would shortly be commissioned to replace the Alom series that had been burned. Agbor learned to carve at Ngiev, near Katsina-Ala, with the Tiv sculptor Shamanga, whose repu- tation was known to him. Agbor spe- TOP LEFT 31. HELMET MASK BY OMORIGBE OF EDOR, IKOM. TOP RIGHT 32.

Three Tiv carvings used in the Becheve Oyumane play, representing the stock characters of soldier, harlot, and Mammy Watta (Fig. 35), were located at Ikwette. They were made by Assom of Gboko and, again, resembled some of the Kwagh-hir carvings illustrated by Enem (1976). The Mammy Watta figures of the Obudu area are very different in concep- tion from those previously described for Ibibioland and Ogoja (Salmons 1977), and point to a separate source of artistic inspiration. Further indication in the Obudu area of northern orientation is provided by the occurrence of the weaving of cotton on the horizontal looms by men, rather than on an upright loom by women, as in the Akwete case. This phenomenon in the northeastern part of Cross River State is not surprising in view of the re- gion's strong trading links with the savannah zone, away from the palm and forest hinterland of Calabar, for, as elsewhere in southeastern Nigeria, art and material culture configurations fol- low the directions pointed by commerce. Further south, in a village of the east- ern Bokyi clan in Ikom Local Govern- ment Area, Osang Abang carves helmet masks that are not covered with skin (Fig. 26). They are janus-faced, with some surmounted by representations of human figures and some by hornbills. The hornbill is a recurrent motif in carv- ings of the northern Igbo and Idoma areas, though there is an Ejagham exam- ple provided by Mansfeld (1908: pl. 18). A striking decorative contrast is achieved in the juxtaposition of scorched dark brown areas of the mask with the light color of the natural wood. This tech- nique, which is frequently used in gourd decoration among the Bokyi and other forest peoples, has not yet been ob- served in other mask traditions. Although the cap and helmet mask types are usually associated with Cross River art, an apparently ancient face mask style, nowadays rather rare, occurs throughout the region. "Often these masks are very different from other im- portant styles in the same area, as, for example, among the Boki, whose face masks do not resemble their skin- covered cap and helmet masks in any way" (Nicklin 1981: 170). Some of the masks, like the example in the Tishman collection for which an Ekajuk or Ukelle provenance was suggested, "bear super- ficial resemblance to some Cross River monoliths, especially in the minimally treated areas that remain after major por- tions of the wood or stone have been carved away" (Nicklin 1981: 170, no. 101). There are further monolith affinities, especially with regard to the depiction of facial scarification, notably in the temple area between eye and ear, and on the cheeks. Here we refer to "a vertical row of little billets" (Partridge 1905: 170) rather than the target tribal marks that usually occur on the temples and are characteristic of many recent skin- covered mask substyles. The Cross River monoliths and older examples of wooden face masks and skin-covered masks, do not normally have the latter scarification at all. Examples of skin- covered masks falling into this category include a Bokyi piece in the Museum of Mankind, London (Fig. 38), and a Keaka piece in the Linden-Museum, Stuttgart (Koloss 1982: 73, A20). Cross River face masks bear significant resemblance to some of the Idoma of the Benue Valley (Sieber 1961: pl. 22), though the latter are white and the former are usually black. Comparison of the Cross River examples we saw in the field in the 1970s, the Idoma white face masks, and a face mask in the Tishman collection (Sieber 1981: 162, no. 95) would seem to corroborate Sidney Kasfir's observa- tions (1979) concerning Cross River af- finities in the Idoma region. Sieber (1981) accepts Kasfir's suggestion that we apply the designation "Idoma-Akweya" to this central Nigerian substyle. One of the finest examples of the Cross River face-mask genre is a piece in the Linden-Museum (Koloss 1982: 68, A14). The vertical scarification mark in the cen- ter of the forehead and those on each temple are of a type widespread among works of the Igbo and Ibibio peoples of the Palm Belt, and also of the Cross River forests. The artistic treatment of the eyes, ears, nose, and mouth (especially the metal inset teeth coated with white pigment) is comparable to the manner in which these features are expressed in the skin-covered mask genre. What perhaps is beginning to emerge is the existence of a stylistic continuum of an "archaic" style of face mask from Idoma country, in a broad sweep across to eastern Ejagham communities on the Cameroon side of the border (Figs. 36, 39, 41, 42). Other northern influences in the mid- dle Cross River area include the depic- tion of Tiv-type tribal marks on skin- covered masks, for example raised keloids around the eyes and on the cheeks and forehead of male Ukelle hel- met masks; and small, parallel, vertical 34.

BOJE, BOKYI, IKOM. lines at the rear of the neck of some female Bokyi cap masks. Both Ukelle and Bokyi informants today speak of artists' having been influenced by the former presence of Tiv slaves and laborers in their territories. In 1977, in an Agoi community near Obubra, we saw a masquerader wearing a woven string costume and displaying a wooden phallus. His face mask resem- bled the style normally associated with the Mambilla (e.g., Schwartz 1975). Some carved ancestral figures in the northern part of Cross River State are not unlike sculptures of the Mambilla and related peoples. This account raises a number of impor- tant questions as to the concept of style. As Jones points out, artists in southeast Nigeria, may, within a relatively small lo- cality, carve in several different modes (1973: 59-60). Among the Bokyi, for example, a large number of disparate mask styles may be encountered at the present time. These include face masks of "archaic" style; large domed face masks of the type shown in Mansfeld (1908: 213, fig. 159) (Fig. 40); and small cap masks, often associated with the Nkuambuk cult, consisting of a pair of human heads situated either side by side or in the janiform mode, with vertical padded cloth projections behind the heads (Fig. 44). These last masks more closely resemble the "archaic" face masks than the skin-covered mask genre, and, as Drewal comments, "may represent an early and distinctively Boki style" (1977: 46-47). However,the Bokyi cap mask of this type in the Ratner collec- tion is not Egbege, as Drewal suggests, but probably Nkuambuk. The following description is taken from Kenneth Mur- ray's report following his visit to the Ikom area in 1948: "Some old carvings called NKWA MBOK exist which are not covered with skin. These heads of rather fierce expression are carved singly or in pairs or threes together. They have deco- rations shaped like clubs and covered with cloth at the back of the head, and cloths of loose African weaving deco- rated with lacing, fixed round the head, chin and neck leaving only the face un- covered. These heads have clearly been long abandoned and are in poor condi- tion. It seems that they must be nearly one hundred years old and no one alive knows how to make the cloth decora- tion. They are different in style from skin-covered heads except for the em- phasis on tribal marks and metal in them and the addition of teeth. It is probable that they originated in the Boki group" (Murray, n.d.). In addition to the "archaic" face mask, domed face mask, and small cap mask, Bokyi masks include skin-covered masks of very great variety, helmet masks of the Enyatu type, and various forms of Ibibio mask that have been imported from the Ikot Ekpene area, obtained from Annang carvers resident in Calabar, or copied lo- cally. Besides these well-established modes-most of which on some occa- sions have been encountered within a single village group-the Bekarum mas- querader in one settlement of the Osokom clan wears a cap mask consist- ing of a skin-covered antelope skull on his head, with an insecticide-spraying protective device on his face (Fig. 43). At another village in Boje clan, a German- made pre-World-War-I glazed pottery replica of a Benin kola receptacle is used in place of the more usual skin-covered antelope cap mask of the hunters' as- sociation, Bekarum. Not only does sculptural style vary within a small geographical locality, but the most talented artists display consid- erable eclecticism. The proclamation "I 37.

Thomas Ogwogwo of Ezekwe in the Ukelle area of Ogoja produces fine skin-covered helmet masks after the manner of his father, Ogwogwo Egana, who died around 1950. (Two pieces possibly by Agana are known, a janus-faced helmet mask called Detelumo, currently at the Na- tional Musuem, Oron, and a triple-faced helmet mask at the New Orleans Mu- 39.

As we have seen in the Ukelle area, however, brightly painted helmet masks with complex tableaux are in cur- rent vogue, often showing definite Igbo influence. Ogwogwo has also produced a horned mask of the type called Mmanwu Ogbuka (Eyo 1977: 205) from the Onitsha area. A framed photograph hanging on the wall in his parlor com- memorates the carving of the mask. Normally Ogwogwo works at home these days, but some years ago he traveled to Ndeze Akataka near Abakaliki and stayed for three months to carve masks for the Okperegede mas- querade. None of these was covered with skin. Ogwogwo has also carved in the style of a number of nearby non-Igbo groups. He made two masks at Image in the lyala area of Ogoja for the Abakpa mas- querade, and a janus-faced skin-covered helmet mask for an Mbembe settlement. Groups in the Okundi area of Bokyiland own various kinds of masks that he pro- duced, including a helmet mask of the older Ukelle style. Ogwogwo even main- tains that many years ago, while he was still learning to carve, he made some white-painted face masks for the Idoma. The carver has traveled as far north as Yache (whose exact location we have been unable to discover) in Benue State. It would appear that this early experi- ence influenced the style of a black- and-white domed face mask called Ag- rima, which he used to make for his own people, but which is no longer in local demand. It is interesting to record that of all the works commissioned from Og- wogwo, he was least satisfied with this piece, to the extent that he was reluctant to sell it to us as an example of his work (Fig. 45). Ogwogwo's home is very near Ezekwe market, a major center for rice and yams that draws traders from all over eastern Nigeria. Many of his patrons are also en- gaged in business at the market. Diverse influences come to Ogwogwo through this source, and Ukelle works have been widely distributed from Ezekwe. Og- wogwo's work has changed and de- veloped over the years, and the cus- tomer may choose from a current sculptural repertoire that includes all styles and types that he has produced in the past. Despite any psychological fulfillment that Ogwogwo may obtain from his in- novations and personal interpretations of what might appear, to the less in- formed, to be non-Ukelle styles, rarely, if ever, can he be said to produce "art for art's sake." The approach to carving work is always pragmatic, and the de- mands of the customer are always para- mount. This observation applies to present-day Cross River artists gener- ally. Furthermore, we are aware that the presence of a foreigner is likely to gener- ate new and aberrant forms that are likely to be purchased for their curio value. Two nontraditional pieces made in the 1970s by Nwa Nkwa of Urua Inyang, Abak, in the Annang area, come to mind: one, a female figure carrying a headload of firewood, was purchased by Salmons and is now in the reserve collection of the National Museum, Oron; the second, a representation of a monkey, was given as "dash" to her Ibibio field assistant, and is now in his personal collection. During the Nigerian Civil War, every- day life in certain parts of the Cross River region was totally disrupted. With the uprooting of entire villages and the con- sequent disappearance of patronage for traditional artworks, some carvers in the refugee camps in Ibibioland were en- couraged by government officials to produce carvings for visiting UNESCO and UNICEF personnel. James Ekpo, a schoolteacher and carver of Ikot Abia 42. SOUTHERN ETUNG FACE MASK, IKOM. 42</page><page sequence="16">43. BEKARUM MASQUERADERS. OSOKOM, BOKYI, IKOM. Osom, used this opportunity to experi- ment with what he called "abstract" forms, which he describes as embodying the anguish that he felt during this hor- rendous period of his life. It is significant that these carvings were all bought by the relief workers, who preferred them to his traditional carvings. There were of course incentives lead- ing artists toward innovation and artistic extravagance long before the Biafran up- heavals, and nowhere was this more marked than in the skin-covered mask genre. Great expense was lavished upon masquerade paraphernalia. The time and expertise expended upon the skin- covered mask, which is often a more elaborate artifact than most other Afri- can masks, made it a valuable object. In some cases a mask association, or one of its founders or leaders, would not only have to pay the artist in cash and in kind, but support him in luxury while he worked for a long period in their village, if he did not live locally There was rivalry between associations both within and between villages to display the most im- pressive masks and the most inspired dances. In this competitive atmosphere new styles and schools of carving prolif- erated. Grotesque, exceptionally large, serene, or aggressive forms emerged from the artists' hands. Since fees were high, carvers became wealthy, and as carving was an honorable profession, some individuals attained status com- parable to that of renowned warriors or wealthy traders. Sometimes they were colorful, bohemian-like characters in their own right, like Akpan Chukwu, who is reputed never to have worked without a bottle of gin clasped between his legs. The larger-than-life personality of the carver probably contributed to the desirability of his work, which in turn in- creased its cost and the rate of diffusion of new styles. As Brain has pointed out for the Bamileke area of west Cameroon, not only could masquerades be purchased, but chiefs also "'owned' sculptors and frequently lent them to their friends or allies or hired them out to the best bid- der" (1980: 106). Works could become "limited editions" in the most sinister of ways. In Ejagham country it was not un- known for a master artist who had just produced a magnificent piece for a war- riors' masquerade group to be murdered on his way home, while in Ibibioland the carver of the mighty Ikorok war drums was sacrificed to the Ikorok spirit if he could be caught upon completion of his work. Efforts to draw a map of the artistic styles of African sculpture and to pin- point the original location of individual pieces are a valid and laudable scholarly endeavor, as well as being of obvious interest to the owner-collector. Nevertheless, we insist upon the pri- macy of insights gained from first-hand field investigation in this often perilous undertaking. From the foregoing discus- sion it may be seen that our concept of style embraces considerations not only of geographical area, ethnolinguistic group, personality, and role of the indi- vidual artist and patron, but also of past and present trade, alliance and war con- nections, other political situations, and even fashion. In addition, attention must be drawn to the random coverage and inadequate standards of documentation of existing museum and private collections, which sometimes owe their very existence to violent episodes in the history of the peoples of the Cross River, notably the periodic British punitive expeditions of the early colonial period, and the Ni- gerian Civil War and its aftermath, which saw the international art market flooded with pieces from southeastern Nigeria. It is regrettable that the definition of Cross River art styles presented here is essen- tially a salvage operation concerning an art-devastated region. That we have been able to attempt the present syn- thesis is perhaps a testimony to the aes- thetic power of the few old pieces still found in original context, the endurance of the underlying cultural patterns of which they are a part, and the inspira- tion of those who continue to create.

It is not possible, regrettably, to name the large number of people whose hospitality and coopera- tion in the field facilitated our study, but we are deeply in- debted to them all. We are particularly grateful to Ekpo Eyo, Director-General of the Nigerian National Commis- sion for Museums and Monuments, Lagos, for essential fa- cilities provided, great privileges allowed, and for continu- ing interest. This article owes its origin to our response to Sieber and Vevers's Interaction: The Art Styiles of the Benie River ValhI,/ and East Nigeria (1974). Certain aspects of the article have benefited from discussions with staff and students at numerous American and Canadian institutions we visited on an extensive study/lecture tour during fall 1978. An ear- lier draft of the paper, entitled "The Interaction of Art Styles in Southeast Nigeria," was delivered at the second Poro conference, Venice, June 1981; gratitude is expressed to Carlo Monzino, Director of Poro, for his overwhelming hospitality on this occasion. Finally, we are grateful to Janet Masters, typist, Horniman Museum, London, for typing the final draft of the manuscript. 1. For example, Bravmann (1973) and Sieber and Vevers (1974) on interaction, Thompson (1969) and Bascom (1975) on the role of the individual artist, and Salmons (1977 and forthcoming) on the influence of particular cults. 2. Circular lbibio face masks "smaller than the wearer's face" do occur, but descriptions appear only in recent litera- ture (e.g., Eyo 1977: 210; Neyt 1979b: 16-17). Although there are probably very few extant field examples, some speci- mens exist in collections in Nigeria and elsewhere. 3. Information about Akpan Chukwu is given in Salmons 1977. Akpan Chukwu's father, the long-deceased Akpan Udom, appears to have initiated the practice of traveling to fairly distant parts, particularly in the Niger Delta area, to work on commission. Today Utu Etim Ekpo artists work for many non-Ibibio customers, especially Igbo, but the cus- tomer usually visits the artist. Joseph Chukwu (Akpan Chukwu's brother) and Akpan Akpan Chukwu (his son) are active in this way In general, artists travel when they are in the early stages of their career and have reputations to establish; later on, if they succeed, the customers come to them. 4. We have written a detailed description of the diffusion of Ikem (Nicklin &amp; Salmons, forthcoming). 5. The term "domed face mask" and other mask terminol- ogy used in this article are taken from Kenneth Murray's "List of Classes" (n.d.). 6. He has now moved to the village of Okka Idah, Wanihem. 7. Cole's accurate provenancing of this important style pre- viously stood in ?ontrast to other generally vague attribu- tions, and forcibly demonstrated the value of fieldwork. 93</page><page sequence="18">More recently the subject has been examined in some detail by Neyt (1979a).
