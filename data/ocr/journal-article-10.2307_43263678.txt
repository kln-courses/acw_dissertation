<plain_text><page sequence="1">Objects of Modernist Description: Dorothy Richardson and the Nouveau Roman The subject/object binary has been declared dead as often as God and the Author. Yet in literary criticism a sty lis tics of subjectivity and objectivity has continued to provide a framing aesthetic binary for critics and writers, regardless of the ostensible philosophy or ideology of the particular critic or writer. If anything the dominance of this binary proved especially dominant in twentieth-century aesthetics, despite the undermining of its correlative in philosophy. It is difficult to find a novelist (or poet, painter, film-maker) who has not in some way tried to position their work either as an expression of an authentic subjectivity in opposition to a false objective realism, or as an expres- sion of an impersonal objective formalism in opposition to indulgent solipsistic subjectivism. The precise terms in which the opposition is figured vary depending upon the specific polemical context, but 'authenticity', 'impressionism', 'realism' and '(anti-) humanism' are among the most frequently mobilized terms of both defence and abuse. The present article looks at the persistence of this opposition of subjective and objective stylistics by focusing on the function of description - specifically the describing of objects - in modernist narrative. The critical reception of two particular writers, Dorothy Richardson and Alain Robbe-Grillet, will be discussed, indicative of two important moments in twentieth-century literary history: 'English' modernism of the period 1910-1922 and the French New Novel of the 1950s and 60s. The article aims to show that the instability of the subjectivism/ objectivism divide is manifested in the tendency of subjectivist aesthetics, when taken to their extreme, to suddenly transmogrify into an objectivist aesthetic and vice versa. Instead of seeing this instability as evidence of a flaw in the terms of opposition, or as proof of the fickleness of critics and writers, the oscillation between poles of subjectivity and objectivity will be shown to express an essential characteristic of modernist texts. That is to say, it is not in the poles of opposition themselves but from the instability of their relation that the dynamic ambiguity of modernist texts derives.</page><page sequence="2">108 Paragraph 1915 saw the simultaneous appearance of Joyce's Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man and Dorothy Richardson's Pointed Roofs , two books exhibiting a set of similarities both in terms of content (the anxious passage through a downwardly mobile middle-class fin-de- siècle adolescence) and in terms of form: episodic structure, free indirect narration shifting into extended interior monologue. Joyce and Richardson acknowledged, as would Mansfield, Woolf and most modernist novelists, the parameters established by Flaubert, James and Conrad, within the limits of which objectivist and subjectivist impulses interact via the play of narrative perspective and the free indi- rect representation of character and consciousness. But the apparent dissolution of this interaction into the 'stream of consciousness' tech- nique, first attributed to Richardson, exemplifies a duality at the heart of the modernist novel. A stream of consciousness passage can be read as the extreme of subjectivism, the unmediated expression of individualized consciousness, or it can be read as the extreme of objec- tivism, the 'documentary' rendering of a thought process, objectified by its position vis-à-vis a narrator and narrative frame. This, in part, explains why Portrait of the Artist and Pointed Roofs were received by some contemporary critics as detached exercises in naturalism, and by others as pathological confessional outpourings. Forty years later, the nouveau roman , especially the early novels of Robbe-Grillet, elicited a similarly divided response: was the objective 'scientistic' stylistics of the narration actually at the service of a pathological subjectivity of character, narrator or author? With Ulysses Joyce breaks with previous modernist orthodoxy, but Richardson elected to continue working within the 1915 parameters of realism for the rest of Pilgrimage , the writing of which would continue into the early 1950s, just prior to her death. Nowadays Richardson is often cited as a precursor of écriture féminine, particularly in connection with Woolf s statement that Richardson 'invented (. . .) the psychological sentence of the feminine gender',1 but she has not been connected by critics to the nouveau roman , and certainly Richardson's austere sensibility seems worlds away from Robbe-Grillet's interest in pulp genres and sado-masochistic eroticism. Yet a connection was made by surviving modernist friends and contemporaries of Richardson, such as Bryher and H.D. In a 1967 tribute to Dorothy Richardson, Bryher writes: 'Incidentally, why has no-one noticed how she anticipated le nouveau roman ? Thirty years earlier than Robbe-Grillet she created the dimensions, colour and spirit of a room or street with the same scientific detachment.'2 It may</page><page sequence="3">Objects of Modernist Description: Dorothy Richardson and the Nouveau Roman 109 seem strange to readers commonly encountering Pilgrimage today as a work of feminine subjectivism to see Bryher eulogize the novel as a work of 'scientific detachment'. On the last page of H.D.'s 'Hirsloaden Notebook', dated January 1957, an unknown hand has written a list of names: Butor; Robbe-Grillet; Claude Simon; Marguerite Duras; to which H.D. has added: 'I prefer to read Dorothy Richardson straight.'3 There are several points of similarity between Dorothy Richardson's thirteen-book modernist novel Pilgrimage and the nouveau roman : the use of shifting pronouns, unstable determinations of character, narrative gaps and ellipses; the eschewal of plot in favour of a focus on intersubjectivity, the undercurrents of conversation and of silence; the replacement of linear narrative with complicated temporal montage and the stream of consciousness. However this article will look at the particular connection to which Bryher refers: the function of description and the stylistics of 'scientific detachment'. In his 1915 Introduction to the first edition of Pointed Roofs (book 1 of Pilgrimage), Richardson's friend and fellow novelist J. D. Beresford recounts three readings of Richardson's text. When Beresford first read Pointed Roofs in handwritten manuscript he considered it a work of extreme realism, something 'objective' presented by a 'conscious artist' standing 'outside her material, judging, balancing, selecting.'4 His second reading was of the typescript whereupon he 'swung round to a flat contradiction' of his earlier judgement, finding Pointed Roofs to be 'the most subjective thing' he had ever read: 'The writer of this has gone through life with eyes that looked inward; she has known every person and experience solely by her own sensations and reactions. On reading the final printed version Beresford concluded that the text went beyond the objective/subjective opposition: Richardson's method - the mediation of Miriam's consciousness as simultaneously the observer and the thing observed - represented a 'new attitude towards fiction'.6 Pilgrimage is a good example of the uncertainty over whether modernism is moving towards the objective or the subjective or a realignment of the two. An apparent stylistics of objectivity (neutral 'documentary' description, transparency of narra- tion, downgrading of omniscience etc.) is placed at the service of representing interior consciousness and, following Henry James, the misrecognitions of a centre of consciousness. When this instability of objective and subjective reading occurs in the critical reception of the nouveau roman in the 1950s, a 'new attitude towards fiction' is again proposed, this time epitomized by the formalisms of the Barthesian writerly.</page><page sequence="4">110 Paragraph Unreal Realism: Robbe-Grillet and Roland Barthes Histories of the novel tell us that it was in the nineteenth century, with the development of realism, that the description of objects was raised from a minimal, subordinate role to any kind of equality with the narration of events, character, and idea or moral. Lukács praises this elevation of the description of things in Balzac and Scott, but only when integrated with the 'dramatic element' in the narrative to produce a representation critical, not imitative, of social reality as a whole.7 Lukács condemns the way in which Zola objectifies only the surface of capitalism through the reification of arbitrary signifiers, and the way in which Flaubert and his modernist successors elevate such surface description into the expression of the individual alienated subject or the alienated formalist text. Balzac may fetishize things in the most obsessive way, but his description serves to lead the reader through to the objective socio-economic reality of the bourgeois society being portrayed. Henry James, of all people, presents Lukács's case for Balzac's description of objects most graphically: The prime aspect in this scene all the while, it must be added, is the money aspect. The general money question so loads him [Balzac] up and weighs him down that he moves through the human comedy, from beginning to end, very much in the fashion of a camel, the ship of the desert, surmounted with a cargo. 'Things' for him are francs and centimes (...). This is what Balzac never forgot; his universe goes on expressing itself for him, to its furthest reaches, on its finest sides, in terms of the market. To say these things, however, is after all to come out where we want, to suggest his extraordinary scale and his terrible completeness.8 For Lukács, the realist novel is objectivity mediated by subjectivity (primarily through characterization), the objective being synonymous with the social and historical truth of the (class) society represented. With modernism this truth is displaced by the vanquished truth of the autonomous aesthetic, of Ideal Form, and the extraordinary scale and terrible completeness of modernists like Joyce and Richardson leads merely to the twin evils of fetishistic naturalism and regressive subjectivism - Zola meets Henry James. Roland Barthes rehearses the conventional view of realism's distinc- tive elevation of the description of objects, only to question the validity of the type of meaning Lukács would wish to attach to such descrip- tion, indeed to question the validity of the attachment of meaning itself to 'literary objects':</page><page sequence="5">Objects of Modernist Description: Dorothy Richardson and the Nouveau Roman 111 Among these realities, psychological or social, the object, or thing, scarcely had any original place; for a long period, literature dealt only with a world of interhuman relationships (in Laclos's Liaisons dangereuses , if a harp is mentioned it is because a love letter is concealed therein); and when things, tools, or substances began to appear with some frequency in our novels, it was as aesthetic or human indicators, to emphasize some soul state (the romantic landscape) or some social condition (the realistic detail). We know that the works of Alain Robbe-Grillet illustrate the problem of the literary object: are things indicators of meaning, or are they, on the contrary, opaque?9 So the object remains, in realist description, an 'indicator' of a meaning - aesthetic, social or psychological - not inherent in the object itself. Barthes doubts the significance of such indicated mean- ings, and proceeds instead to popularize the view that description in the realist novel has little to do with any fidelity to empirical reality or indeed any fidelity to characterization, plot and Lukács's 'dramatic element' in the narrative. For Barthes the narrative function of describing objects is to produce a 'reality effect' as a means to secure the reader's identification with the narrative world depicted, the very superfluity or excessiveness of description in realist and natu- ralistic novels signifying a supposed truthfulness to empirical reality that refuses to be bound by the artificiality of novelistic modes of representation.10 In the realist text the description of an object - a room, a window, a table, a vase - whatever it might tell us about the characters and their story being enacted in that room (their sensi- bility, class and social status etc.), is primarily a signifier of reality masquerading as reality itself. Barthes implies a political critique and indeed his analysis has been used to condemn all realist fiction as at best redundant, since we now see through this 'reality effect', or at worst downright fraudulent, a part of the ongoing reproduction of bourgeois ideology as a common-sense self-evident reality. Barthes's suspicion of any attribution of meaning to objects in narrative led him to promote Alain Robbe-Grillet, a novelist whose stated aim was to 'cleanse' description of spurious anthropomorphism and who writes: 'AJI around us, defying our pack of animistic or domesticating adjectives, things are there. Their surface is smooth, clear and intact, without false glamour, without transparency.'11 Robbe- Grillet's starting point is similar to that of Dorothy Richardson: the existence of things is the fundamental ground of being, and language (particularly metaphor) blinds us to this immediacy of being.12 And, like Dorothy Richardson many years before, Robbe-Grillet argues that the New Novel should find narrative techniques to follow the</page><page sequence="6">112 Paragraph example of cinema in describing the 'first impact' of objects as being their 'presence'; it is this presence that should take precedence over any meaning: 'In the construction of future novels, gestures and objects will be there, before they are something; and they will still be there afterwards, hard, unalterable, ever-present, and apparently quite indifferent to their own meaning.'13 The task for writers is therefore to describe objects as objectively and in as much detail as possible. Objects must be rendered 'present' through description that will imitate the neutral style of scientific description. Dismissing the analogical and the metaphorical, Robbe-Grillet writes that 'the optical, descriptive adjective, the adjective that is content to measure, to situate, to limit, to define, is probably showing us the difficult way to a new art of the novel'.14 Robbe-Grillet's rhetoric here irresistibly brings to mind Richardson's satirical portrait of the New Novelist circa 1896, Hypo Wilson (based on her sometime lover H.G. Wells), who argues that 'There will be books - with all that cut out - him and her - all that sort of thing. The books of the future will be clear of all that' and tells his disciple Gowry to write a novel about a lamp-post.15 Robbe-Grillet's first novel, Les Gommes ( The Erasers ), contained the following short descriptive passage: A quarter of tomato that is quite faultless, cut up by the machine into a perfectly symmetrical fruit. The peripheral flesh, compact, homogeneous, and a splendid chemical red, is of an even thickness between a strip of gleaming skin and the hollow where the yellow, graduated seeds appear in a row, kept in place by a thin layer of greenish jelly along a swelling in the heart. This heart, of a slightly grainy, faint pink, begins - toward the inner hollow - with a cluster of white veins, one of which extends towards the seeds - somewhat uncertainly. Above, a scarcely visible accident has occurred: a corner of the skin, stripped back from the flesh for a fraction of an inch, is slightly raised.16 The protagonist of the novel, Wallas, has gone into a cafeteria and the quarter wedge of tomato is on his plate. This brief passage, modest compared to later nouveau roman practice, is useful because it became something of a test case for critical interpretation: what exactly is its purpose? what does it mean? Barthes explains Robbe-Grillet's intention at the time of writing The Erasers : This slice of tomato in an automat sandwich, described according to Robbe- Grillet's method, constitutes an object without heredity, without associations and</page><page sequence="7">Objects of Modernist Description: Dorothy Richardson and the Nouveau Roman 113 without references, a stubborn object rigorously enclosed within the order of its particles, suggestive of nothing but itself, and not involving its reader in a functional or substantial elsewhere. "The human condition", Heidegger has said, "is to be there ." (. . .) The author's entire art is to give the object a Dasein , a "being there", and to strip it of "being-something".17 So the description returns to the tomato its Dasein. But perhaps this is not simply an irruption of the real into a narrative. Is this not rather a description of Wallas's perception of the tomato? And since Wallas is an obsessive paranoid character mixed up in a murder mystery and assailed by Œdipal anxieties, this is far from being a neutral phenomenological description. So might not the excessive description of the tomato therefore function as what Didier Anzieu characterized as Robbe-Grillet's 'discourse of the obsessional'?18 The subjective or psychological interpretative approach is persuasive given the fact that, as with Wallas in The Erasers , all of Robbe-Grillet's important novels feature 'obsessional' protagonists: a sadistic rapist Mathias in Le Voyeur , an unnamed jealous husband/narrator in La Jalousie and so on. This resolution in favour of the subjective convinced Alain Robbe-Grillet himself. By 1961 his extreme commitment to objectivity has switched to an equally extreme commitment to subjectivism: The New Novel aims only at total subjectivity As there were many objects in our books, and as people thought there was something unusual about them, they didn't take long to decide on the word 'objectivity', which was used by certain critics when referring to these objects, but used in a very particular sense, i.e., orientated towards the object. In its usual sense which is neutral, cold and impartial, the word became an absurdity. Not only is it a man who, in my novels, for instance, describes everything, but he is also the least neutral and the least impartial of men; on the contrary, he is always engaged in a passionate adventure of the most obsessive type - so obsessive that it often distorts his vision and subjects him to fantasies bordering on delirium.19 When Roland Barthes came to reconsider Robbe-Grillet's develop- ment in the light of this, for Barthes, unfortunate turn of events, he proposed the existence of two Robbe-Grillets. Robbe-Grillet no.l had attempted, through a new kind of realist description, a cathartic purification of the object from the confusion of accrued anthropomorphic meanings assigned to it by humanist sensibilities: On the one hand, the realism of the first Robbe-Grillet remains classical because it is based on an analogical relationship (the quarter wedge of tomato described by Robbe-Grillet resembles its real counterpart); and on the other hand, his realism is</page><page sequence="8">114 Paragraph new, because this analogy refers to no transcendency, but claims an existence based only on itself, content to designate necessarily and sufficiently the all-too-famous être-la (being-there, Dasein) of the thing (this tomato wedge is described in such a way that it is meant to provoke neither desire nor disgust, to have no referential meaning to the time of year, or the place, or even to the idea of food). 20 For Barthes, Robbe-Grillet no.l can and should be read 'in an opaque or superficial manner; one needs only to stay at the surface of the text'. However, there is now a Robbe-Grillet no. 2 who returns the 'opaque body of novels to a whole literary, and thus human, context', recovering coherent storylines, characters and their psychological motivations, a process of recuperation in which the objects become 'objective correlatives'.22 This term takes us back to an earlier, modernist, negotiation of these problematics, when the Imagist 'direct treatment of the "thing", whether subjective or objective' cleansed of dead symbolism gave rise to T.S. Eliot's 'objective correlative' embodying the pre-existing emotion of the perceiver.23 'Objective correlative' was applied to Robbe-Grillet's work in Bruce Morrissette's 1963 explication of the novels from the point of view of Robbe-Grillet no. 2. In his Foreword to Morrissette's book, Barthes asks whether it is necessary to choose between Robbe- Grillet no.l, the 'chosiste', and Robbe-Grillet no. 2, the 'humaniste', and concludes that although meaning in general has become reattached to the object, the precise meaning remains in suspension: Already, meaning floods back in: expelled from the famous tomato wedge of The Erasers (but already doubtless present in the eraser itself, as Bruce Morrissette shows), meaning fills Marienbad , its garments, its panelled walls, its feathery dresses. Except that, while ceasing to be non-existent, meaning is still in this case a matter of conjecture: everyone has explained Marienbad , but each explanation was a meaning immediately denied by a neighbouring meaning; if meaning is no longer abolished, it nevertheless remains in suspense.24 As Barthes remarks here, the shift to subjectivism was evident in the success of Robbe-Grillet's collaboration with director Alain Resnais on the film Last Year at Marienbad , which, as Robbe-Grillet envisaged it, resembles a narrative of hypnotic persuasion.25 The ostensibly objective description of both voice-over and camera do not produce an objective reality but, for most viewers, an unremittingly subjective one - not in the sense of identifying with X's attempt to persuade A of their affair a year earlier, but in the sense of an identification with the movement, the reverie, of desire, the object (or meaning)</page><page sequence="9">Objects of Modernist Description: Dorothy Richardson and the Nouveau Roman 115 of which is always beyond, 'in suspense'. However, Barthes is being diplomatic in claiming that meaning remains expelled from the 'famous tomato' of The Erasers. Morrissette had in fact recuperated the tomato, attributing meaning to its description in terms similar to that of Anzieu's 'obsessional discourse': Such a virtuoso passage is not, however, a mere still life; it is more than an "objectai exercise in literary materialization". For the author makes his object function to support the mental and emotional life of his character. A theme of uncertainty runs through all this precision; not only is Wallas's perplexity embodied therein, but his protagonist's defect, his tragic flaw.26 But Morrissette's author had moved on. As we saw at the outset, Barthes rejected reading 'literary objects' as 'human indicators' and saw the activity of description as making itself visible precisely in as far as it renders its object 'opaque'. Robbe-Grillet now concurs: description does not objectify, subjectivize or defamiliarize an object but is self-reflexive. In description the ostensible object or thing is lost. The reader does not see the object but is blinded to it, seeing instead the act of description: Descriptions were formerly used to determine the broad outlines of the scene, and then to throw light on some particularly revealing elements in it; now they only speak of insignificant objects, or of objects which they are intent on rendering as such. Formerly they were trying to reproduce a pre-existent reality; now they claim a creative function. And finally, they used to make people see things, while now they seem to destroy them, as if their eagerness to expatiate on them were only intended to make their outlines indistinct, to render them incomprehensible, and finally to make them disappear altogether.27 And so Robbe-Grillet arrives at the Barthesian 'writerly', having moved from a belief in the objectivity of the represented object to a belief that the object is merely a symptom of the subjective human psyche, and then on to a belief in a paramount instability of textual meaning which renders all representation of objectivity and subjectivity, indeed all representation, questionable. Barthes's three Robbe-Grillets resemble J. D. Beresford's trio of Dorothy Richardsons with which we began and to whom we now turn. Dorothy Richardson: Chosiste? The opening chapter of The Tunnel (the fourth book in the Pilgrimage series) consists of a minutely detailed description of a room and its</page><page sequence="10">116 Paragraph objects: door, carpet, wash-stand, chest of drawers, gas-light fittings, table, mirror etc. The nearest thing to dramatic action occurs when the heroine, Miriam Henderson, tries to open a window. The ensuing description of Miriam negotiating the complicated window and its frame presents difficulties for the reader comparable to those presented by Robbe-Grillet's descriptions of rooms, coffee pots and tomatoes. The following is a representative extract: Behind the top rim of the iron framework of bars was a discoloured roll of window blind. Then the bars must move. . . . Shifting the table she pressed close to the barred window. It smelt strongly of rust and dust. (. . .) Her hands went through the bars and lifted the little rod which held the lattice half open. The little square four-paned frame swung free and flattened itself back against the fixed panes, out of reach, its bar sticking over the leads. Drawing back grimed fingers and wrists striped with grime, she grasped the iron bars and pulled. The heavy framework left the window frame with a rusty creak and the sound of paint peeling and cracking. It was very heavy, but it came up and up until her arms were straight above her head, and looking up she saw a stout iron ring in a little trapdoor in the wooden ceiling and a hook in the centre of the endmost bar in the iron framework. Kneeling on the table to raise the frame once more and fix it to the ceiling, she saw the whole length of the top row of windows across the way and wide strips of grimy stucco placed across the house fronts between the windows. The framework of the freed window was cracked and blistered, but the little square panes were clean. There were four little windows in the row, each with four square panes. The outmost windows were immovable. The one next to the open one had lost its bar, but a push set it free and it swung wide.28 How might such a passage be approached? The narrative context of this extract is that Miriam has moved into the top floor room of a Bloomsbury boarding house. The social significance of a 'room of one's own' for a young woman in 1890s London, particularly one in Miriam Henderson's awkward downwardly mobile class posi- tion, is the Balzacian realist imperative behind The Tunnel. But this 'objective' social and historical reality is rendered via Miriam's highly 'subjective' symbolization of the room. May Sinclair famously called Pilgrimage a 'stream of consciousness going on and on', and certainly Miriam Henderson is an extreme version of a Jamesian 'centre of consciousness' through and around which the narrative operates.29 The description of the room in The Tunnel is inflected with the characteristic consciousness of the immature Miriam rather than being</page><page sequence="11">Objects of Modernist Description: Dorothy Richardson and the Nouveau Roman 117 an objective viewpoint of, say, the third-person narrator. In other words, the description of the room is also a description through and of Miriam. If Miriam seems overwrought in her negotiation of the window, it is because she is overwrought. In fact, her mother has recently committed suicide in exceptionally traumatic circumstances, an event marked at the very end of the previous book, Honeycomb. This opening chapter to The Tunnel portrays the traumatized heroine in the act of self-consciously starting afresh, of finding a space, a room, projected as a refuge or sanctuary from which to strike out into a new life in London. One of the earliest reviewers of Pilgrimage thought the book 'a charted dissection of an unsound mind' and, in a sense, they were not wholly wrong.30 Today Pilgrimage is still best known (rightly or wrongly) as a stream of consciousness novel, the endless subjective outpouring of a single character, and so, inevitably, the limited reper- toire of given objects (such as the window) which are excessively and repeatedly described could be read, like Robbe-Grillet's descriptive motifs, as 'objective correlatives', fetish objects within an 'obsessional discourse'. And, indeed, the window does become an object of anxiety concerning voyeurism and whether Miriam's private space is open to the gaze of the other.31 How else might the above extract be read? Richardson privileges 'being' as the fundamental reality and, like early Robbe-Grillet, she wishes to capture the immediate presence of ordinary objects stripped of anthropomorphic attribution or linguistic distortion, particularly the veils of metaphor. The above passage is trying to foreground the window in its actuality. It is saying: this is a window, this is how it is constructed and designed; it is an old, dilapidated window, rusty and creaking, and this is how it opens on a particular evening in 1896. But the repeated references to 'grime' invoke Richardson's 'dirty realism' style, an aspect of a repetitive stylistics that is not merely a compensatory defamiliarization restoring the existence of the window to the reader, but extends into a hyper-realism far beyond what is acceptable according to conventional literary codes of realism, the effect of which is to make the window unreal. It will be recalled that Barthes and Robbe-Grillet came to favour the idea that the hyper- realist style of description characteristic of the nouveau roman did not uphold realism or the reality effect, but had the opposite effect of destroying the object - that is to say, destroying the transparency of realist representation and instead drawing attention to the writing and the difficulty of reading. And surely this is the case in the Richardson passage. How many readers 'see' the window and Miriam's attempt to</page><page sequence="12">118 Paragraph open it? Some readers undoubtedly will get the gist of a reality effect, but many will find the passage (let alone the whole chapter) difficult to follow in its detail, in its sustained concentration. Objects such as windows, tables, doors, even bars of soap, are repeatedly described over the course of the thirteen books in the Pilgrimage series, as are descriptions of places like rooms, staircases, corridors and gardens. Such objects and their description take on a structuring function. For example, the descriptions of rooms nearly always occur at the beginning of a book, chapter or episode. Such objects, via strategic repetition, function like generative signifiers, producing the momentum or logic of the text as much as any plot, and so become a part of the 'writerly' elaboration of the text. The paradox, as Barthes noted, is that dispersal of meaning as structured variation (objective) has a tendency to return as over-determined meaning (subjective): In fact Robbe-Grillet doesn't destroy meaning, he scrambles it. Robbe-Grillet thinks that by scrambling a meaning he's destroying it. It takes more than that to destroy a meaning. (. . .) Because he 'varies' the meaning, he does not suspend it. Variation imposes an increasingly definite meaning, of an obsessional kind; a small number of signifiers subject to variation (in the musical sense of the term) refer to the same signified (which is the definition of metaphor).32 Extensive readings of Pilgrimage bear this out: what initially, taking a single book or passage, appears to be heterogeneous material beyond coherent narrative meaning is subjected, over the course of the whole work, to a series of 'variations' from which an actually quite limited number of primary signifiers emerge (room, stairs, garden, spring, silence etc., and those abstract and social signifiers which are usually figured within binaries, e.g. being-becoming, masculine- feminine), all of which 'obsessively' refer back to the same signified or master-signifiers (specifically the death of the mother, generally the self-other dialectic). The writerly should not therefore be elevated into a formalist transcendence of the oppositions present in the text. Conventional realist and subjectivist readings remain integral to the experience of reading this kind of modernist text, precisely in as far they remain unresolved by the writerly, and unassimilated by the would-be Aufhebung of any 'autonomous' formalism of the type common to painting, music and poetry but rare in the modernist novel. The description of the room in The Tunnel continues for seven pages. Then, Miriam starts reading The Voyage of the Beagle and drifts</page><page sequence="13">Objects of Modernist Description: Dorothy Richardson and the Nouveau Roman 119 into a reverie concerning the period between her mother's suicide and arriving here at the London boarding house - an extremely fragmented stream of consciousness passage occupying almost five pages and referring to the lodgings and bed-sits she has stayed in during this intervening period. The chapter closes with a short return to the description of the room. Stylistically, therefore, the chapter consists of the most extreme objective description divided by the most extreme passage of subjective stream of consciousness. But in the moment of literary high modernism ( The Tunnel was published in February 1919), the more the binary subjective/objective is asserted the more unstable it becomes. In her review of The Tunnel , Virginia Woolf appears to accept that Richardson has created the true reality of the 'impression' of objective sensation on the subjective mind, in which case we have access to external reality through Miriam's mind or as Woolf puts it: 'the consciousness of Miriam takes the reflection of [external reality] to perfection'.33 Woolf also believes we have access to subjectivity in the associative play of ideas and emotions within the mind that is doing the reflecting: 'Here we are thinking, word by word, as Miriam thinks.'34 Does Woolf therefore believe that Richardson has captured the true reality, a resolution of the subjective/objective opposition? Not quite. 'That Miss Richardson gets so far as to achieve a sense of reality far greater than that produced by the ordinary means is undoubted. But, then, which reality is it, the superficial or the profound?'35 For Woolf, then, both the description of the room and Miriam's interior monologue, both the objective and the subjective, are descriptions of surface : We still find ourselves distressingly near the surface. Things look much the same as ever. (. . .) [S]ensations, impressions, ideas and emotions glance off her [Miriam], unrelated and unquestioned, without shedding as much light as we had hoped into the hidden depths. We find ourselves in the (. . .) lodging-house bedroom, frequently and convincingly; but never, or only for a tantalizing second, in the reality which underlies these appearances.36 The representation of Miriam's interior monologue ('ideas and emotions') and the representation of things as objects perceived by her ('sensations, impressions') are 'distressingly near the surface'. Woolf is attacking a perceived lack of design or form in Richardson's writing, a form which could correspond to a profound essence under- lying the superficial realm of appearance. In this Woolf is being a good Bloomsbury post-impressionist, moving towards the modernist</page><page sequence="14">120 Paragraph reclaiming of classical significance of form in reaction against both (objective) naturalism and (subjective) impressionism/expressionism. It is Form which represents and provides access to the Ideal that is the true reality. Katherine Mansfield, in her review of The Tunnel , echoes Woolf s complaints, arguing that this is not art but a narrative machine: there is no form or structure to the narrative and corre- spondingly no meaning or significance, there is instead only endless description as recorded by the 'brilliant machine' that is Richardson's mind. The descriptive details are not selected or given an 'appointed place in the whole scheme' - in fact there is no scheme: 'Miriam is enclosed in a Bloomsbury boarding-house [receiving] shock after shock of inward recognition' produced only by the surrounding mundane objects of her room, and therefore 'everything being of equal importance to her, it is impossible that everything should not be of equal unimportance'.38 Leaving aside the question of whether this idea that Pilgrimage lacks structure, design and form is actually correct, there are two points worth noting. Mansfield and Woolf equate realism with an amorphous mass of concrete detail, in which objectivity is recorded by a machine- like subjective consciousness: 'There is Miss Richardson, holding out her mind, as it were, and there is Life hurling objects into it as fast as she can throw' writes Mansfield.39 This is not a transcendence of the subjective/objective binary, merely a mechanical relation and, as an alternative, Mansfield and Woolf propose a profound reality, in which individual details achieve significance through their relation to the 'whole scheme', an Idealist totality. That is to say, narrative detail derives its meaning from its relation to the higher (overall) form of an artistic work. The other point raised by both Mansfield and Woolf is that the profusion of descriptive detail in Pilgrimage presents a difficulty for the reader. Without selection there can be no order. Without order there is no hierarchy of signification and, therefore, no meaning at all: 'everything being of equal importance (. . .) it is impossible that everything should not be of equal unimportance'. The reader is confronted, Mansfield says, with a 'breathless' procession of details and 'the pace kills' (over-reaches the reader's power of concentration and kills the reader's interest). The objects are described but their meaning is not revealed, they remain opaque, and the reader becomes frustrated and irritated.40 But what if the difficulty of reading results from a strategy on the part of the writer to make the reader aware of the act of reading, to force a critical engagement with the act of reading itself? This is</page><page sequence="15">Objects of Modernist Description: Dorothy Richardson and the Nouveau Roman 121 an avowed strategy of both modernist and nouveau roman novelists; it is one purpose of 'writerly' texts. Woolf acknowledges this self- reflexiveness about reading and writing produced by the narrative of The Tunnel , only to conclude that this type of self-reflexiveness closes down the activity of the reader: 'It is a method that demands attention, as a door whose handle we wrench ineffectively calls our attention to the fact that it is locked.'41 The description of the tomato from The Erasers and of opening the window from The Tunnel are brief examples of a descriptive mode that is dominant in these novels. Reading a short extract gives merely a flavour of the kind of problems readers encounter in following such a narrative over the length of an entire novel, or in the case of Pilgrimage a series of thirteen novels, and both authors have faced the same exasperated response: an accusation of literal 'unreadibility' (Woolf s locked door) usually couched in terms of irritable boredom resulting from an inability to produce meaning. In retrospect Robbe-Grillet has held Barthes partly responsible for producing this 'unreadibility' as a disavowal of (subjective) meaning: Grappling with his [Barthe's] personal demons, he did his best to outwit them by searching for a 'writing degree zero' in which he's never believed. My so-called neutrality [blancheur] - mere protective clothing - came at just the right moment to fuel his discourse. And I was dubbed 'objective novelist' or, worse still, one who was attempting to be objective but who, without an ounce of talent, merely succeeded in being dull.42 But the problem is less one of unreadibility due to the tedious one- dimensionality of the descriptive mode, than one of this mode acting as a vehicle for the several different kinds of reading characteristic of modernist texts: as Balzacian realism, portraying an historically specific socio-economic world; as a restoring of Dasein to the objects in the world; as a pathological discourse of obsession; as a writerly exercise in the self-reflexivity of literary style and language. The instability of the subjective/objective opposition within which these readings tend to be constructed imparts itself to the readings themselves. The 'writerly' which proposes itself as an 'objective' anti-humanist strategy (e.g. language-as-system speaking the author rather than vice versa) might, as in Robbe-Grillet's retrospective view, be read as a repression of the subjective, a repressed which was bound to return (as in late Barthes and the widespread autobiographical turn by New Novelists and fellow travellers). Pilgrimage too was read almost entirely in autobiographical terms in the 1980s. Rather than privileging one</page><page sequence="16">122 Paragraph reading as a resolution of the subjective/objective opposition via a short-cut dialectic, modernist texts are palimpsests, each reading providing a level necessary to the text. The radical ambiguity of a modernist text like Pilgrimage (or In the Labyrinth , Jealousy , Marienbad) lies in its suspension of resolution. And, as this article has suggested, if interaction between levels is unresolved and experienced not as equilibrium but as disturbing oscillation, this is, in part, because any objective turn is invariably haunted by the ghost of subjectivity.
