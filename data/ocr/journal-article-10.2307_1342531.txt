<plain_text><page sequence="1">NOTES CHILDREN AS BELIEVERS: MINORS' FREE EXERCISE RIGHTS AND THE PSYCHOLOGY OF RELIGIOUS DEVELOPMENT American children have an intensely complicated relationship with religion. From one angle, millions of children are actively "religious" in any plausible sense of the word. They pray and attend religious services; indeed, many faiths incorporate rites that are specifically de- signed for children. At the same time, most children's religious experi- ences are largely shaped by their parents. Common sense suggests that parents generally decide what, if any, religion their children practice, and how they do so. Indeed, many faiths insist that parents have a sa- cred duty to instruct their children in religious tenets and practices. Unsurprisingly, adults readily go to bat for the free exercise rights of children who practice the same religion that they do. Advocates of school prayer frequently argue that they seek to vindicate children's right to pray in school. Other religious groups battle school dress codes that prohibit religious jewelry or certain hairstyles. At the same time, the mere suggestion that American children should have religious rights independent of their parents sparks fero- cious opposition. For example, in I995, President Clinton signed the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child, which provides that states should "respect the right of the child to freedom of thought, con- science and religion."' This provision generated a firestorm of contro- versy, with many arguing that it fatally undermines parents' rights.2 This Note suggests that a serious exploration of children's religios- ity can usefully inform debates about their free exercise rights. Part I examines the current state of the doctrine. It begins with a brief over- view of children's constitutional rights. The law frequently treats children differently from adults on the ground that children lack ma- turity. Yet in the free exercise context, courts have largely ignored is- sues of maturity, instead treating child and adult plaintiffs more or less 1 Convention on the Rights of the Child, Nov. 20, i989, art.

The second section of Part I outlines four possible theories to explain this anomaly, finally concluding that no one theory fully ex- plains modern free exercise doctrine about children. Part II turns to the religious beliefs of children. The first section suggests that to decide among the various approaches to children's free exercise rights, courts and commentators will ultimately face the ques- tion of how seriously to take children's claims of religious belief. The second section presents an overview of current research about the psy- chology of children's religious development. These findings strongly suggest that children's cognitive capacities for belief are more like adults' than has been commonly thought. Part II concludes with a few tentative observations about the potential legal implications of this research. I. THE ANOMALOUS NATURE OF CHILDREN'S FREE EXERCISE RIGHTS A. The Relevance of Immaturity in Constitutional Law About Children The Supreme Court has famously declared that "neither the Four- teenth Amendment nor the Bill of Rights is for adults alone."3 Yet children have been only occasionally successful at asserting constitu- tional rights equal to those of adults, mostly in the realms of equal pro- tection law4 and criminal or administrative procedure.' In other con- texts, the courts have decided that children enjoy a much more limited set of constitutional rights than do adults: Minors do not have the right to trial by jury in juvenile court6 or the right to be free of corporal punishment by public school officials.7 Their First Amendment speech rights are considerably foreshortened.8 Public school officials may test 3 In re Gault, 387 U.S. I, I3 (i967); see also Planned Parenthood v.

Sometimes, the courts point to immaturity to justify state-imposed limitations on minors who engage in constitutionally protected activities. In Bellotti v. Baird,"2 the Supreme Court held that a state may require a pregnant minor to obtain parental consent for an abortion, unless she can con- vince a judge either that she is mature enough to make the decision independently or that the abortion is in her best interests.'3 The Bel- lotti Court emphasized that states could limit children's freedom be- cause, among other reasons, "during the formative years of childhood and adolescence, minors often lack the experience, perspective, and judgment to recognize and avoid choices that could be detrimental to 9 Vernonia Sch.

Others suggest that the Supreme Court has long been torn between recognizing children as people with full rights, or as human beings uniquely under the continual custody of both their parents and the state. See, e.g., Laurence D. Houlgate, Three Concepts of Children's Constitutional Rights: Reflections on the Enjoyment Theory, 2 U. PA. J. CONST.

L. 53, 59-60 (i999) (arguing that the dispositive factor in children's rights cases is whether the child's and par- ents' interests are consistent).

Fraser,16 the Court held that school officials could punish a student for giving a lewd speech at a school assembly, in part because the majority deemed it important for schools to be able to teach "confused" students the norms of polite public discourse.' At other times, the courts cite children's immaturity as a reason for heightening minors' constitutional protections. Writing for the Su- preme Court in Brown, Chief Justice Warren memorably noted that school segregation was especially harmful to young psyches: "To sepa- rate [black children] from others of similar age and qualifications solely because of their race generates a feeling of inferiority as to their status in the community that may affect their hearts and minds in a way unlikely ever to be undone.""' Similarly, the Court - until re- cently, at least - has been especially vigilant about Establishment Clause violations in public schools.'9 The Court's main concern has been that children's emotional immaturity makes them more suscepti- ble to pressures from both teachers and fellow students. In Lee v. Weisman,20 for example, the Court extensively cited psychological evi- dence about adolescent vulnerability to peer pressure for the proposi- tion that clergy-led prayer at middle and high school graduations is coercive.21 A subordinate line of thinking - which has lately fallen into disfavor - suggests that children's relatively undeveloped cogni- tive capacities make them more likely to misinterpret private religious action in the school as state-sponsored.22 14 Id. at 635; see also Parham v.

The Apparent Irrelevance of Immaturity in Free Exercise Jurisprudence Interestingly, the theme of children's immaturity, so prominent in the great bulk of discussions about the constitutional rights of minors, seems largely absent from Free Exercise Clause analyses. Children most often assert free exercise rights in conjunction with their parents. The typical case involves students and their parents challenging educational practices or curriculum requirements as in- fringements on their religious liberty. When analyzing these cases, the courts generally do not bother to disaggregate the children's and par- ents' rights. West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette23 is a paradigmatic example of this approach. In Barnette, the Court held that the state violated the Free Exercise Clause when it punished Je- hovah's Witness schoolchildren - and their parents - for refusing to salute the American flag.4 The Court did not separate out the respec- tive free exercise rights of the children and their parents in arriving at this conclusion.25 Even when children independently assert free exercise rights, courts almost never raise the issue of minority. Instead, they simply treat the child claimants as if they were adults. Children have repeat- edly charged school officials with violating their religious freedoms.26 They also occasionally raise free exercise claims in other contexts.27 In sharp contrast to cases in which children raise other constitutional may provide a crucial symbolic link between government and religion, thereby enlisting - at least in the eyes of impressionable youngsters - the powers of government to the support of the religious denomination operating the school"); cf. Bd. of Educ. v. Mergens, 496 U.S. 226, 250-51 (i990) (upholding the Equal Access Act, which permits student religious clubs to meet on school grounds under certain conditions, on the basis that high school students are mature enough to distinguish between an equal access policy and official sponsorship of religion). But see Good News Club v. Milford Cent. Sch., 12I S. Ct. 2093, 2I04-o6 (2001) (holding that elementary school children are unlikely to perceive their school to be endorsing religion when it permits a Christian club for children to use its facilities after school hours); id. at 2 io6 ("We decline to employ Estab- lishment Clause jurisprudence using a modified heckler's veto, in which a group's religious activ- ity can be proscribed on the basis of what the youngest members of the audience might misper- ceive.). 23 V9 U.S. 624 (I943). 24 Id. at 642. 25 Accord Mozert v.

Admittedly, children who make these claims usually lose, both when they sue together with their parents and when they act independently. However, it seems likely that this is more the result of the Court's current free exercise jurisprudence generally than anything to do specifically with the plaintiffs' minor status.28 There are at least four ways to interpret the courts' seemingly iden- tical treatment of children and adults in the, free exercise context. One possibility is that the Free Exercise Clause - unlike a number of other constitutional provisions - protects children and adults equally.29 Justice Douglas sounded this theme in his famous partial dissent in Wisconsin v. Yoder.0 In Yoder, the Court held that the Free Exercise Clause precluded Wisconsin from requiring Old Order Amish children to attend school past the eighth grade.3' Justice Douglas pointed out that the Amish parents were "seeking to vindicate not only their own free exercise rights, but also those of their high-school-age children,"32 and he criticized the majority for letting the parents articulate their children's supposed religious beliefs.33 He emphasized that the Court had "held over and over again"34 that children are entitled to the pro- tections of the Bill of Rights, strongly implying that minors have the same free exercise rights as do adults.35 Alternatively, perhaps children do not have the same free exercise rights at all, and these cases are really about their parents' religious rights. Emily Buss suggests that when parents and children jointly seek religious exemptions from state educational requirements, "it is the parents' claims that the courts address in their decisions."36 More broadly, she points out that in the overwhelming majority of cases as- serting children's free exercise rights, the children's religious interests are the same as their parents'.37 On this theory, even when a child brings a free exercise claim independently, the court considers itself to be addressing primarily the free exercise rights of her parents. 28 See infra pp. 22 i6-I 7. 29 See Catherine J. Ross, An Emerging Right for Mature Minors To Receive Information, 2 U. PA. J. CONST. L. 223, 265 (i999) ("By a null hypothesis, the Supreme Court has accepted the no- tion that even elementary school children can develop deeply held religious beliefs that command respect under the Constitution."). 30 406 U.S. 205 (I972). 31 See id. at 234. 32 Id. at 24I (Douglas, J., dissenting in part). 33 Id. at 243-46. 34 Id. at 243. 35 See id. at 243-44. 36 Emily Buss, The Adolescent's Stake in the Allocation of Educational Control Between Par- ent and State, 67 U.

REV. 1233, I240 n.22 (2000). 37 Buss, supra note iI, at 6i-62.</page><page sequence="7">2002] CHILDREN AS BELIEVERS 2211 Another possibility is that the courts might be employing a "mature minor" approach, under which some children - that is, adult-like chil- dren - enjoy the same rights as do adults, while the rest do not. Justice Douglas's Yoder dissent has a hint of this perspective: "Where the child is mature enough to express potentially conflicting desires, it would be an invasion of the child's rights to permit such an imposition without canvassing his views."38 In a lengthy footnote, he cited both legal precedent and psychological evidence for the proposition that fourteen-year-olds, especially Amish fourteen-year-olds, have enough "moral and intellectual maturity" to decide for themselves whether to stop attending school and permanently commit themselves to Amish life.39 It is an open question whether his analysis would have been the same if the respondents' children had been younger. Finally, one can frame the issue as one of group rights. Maybe when children assert free exercise rights, the courts view them not as independent rights holders, nor as mere proxies for their parents, but rather as representatives of a larger religious group.40 The majority opinion in Yoder alludes to this notion; the Court noted that compel- ling Amish children to attend high school "carries with it a very real threat of undermining the Amish community and religious practice as they exist today."4' This theory is not so much a fourth alternative to the previous three as it is a particular way of combining them. In one sense, the group rights theory vindicates children's rights - as a member of a group, a child deserves constitutional protection for her religious practices. But at the same time, because parents presumably determine their children's religious affiliations, a group rights ap- proach also may effectively subordinate children's religious freedom to that of their parents.42 Lastly, the group rights theory might intersect with the mature minor idea, if the courts treat claims of group mem- bership differently on the basis of age. It is difficult to assess the relative explanatory power of these theo- ries. Because the courts apparently do not think it necessary to resolve precisely whose rights are at stake to decide most free exercise cases involving children, few judicial opinions devote much attention to the issue.43 None of the theories set forth above definitively explains the doctrine about children's free exercise rights: different theories explain 38 Yoder, 406 U.S. at 242 (Douglas, J., dissenting in part). 39 Id. at 245 n-3- 40 See George W.

The parents' rights approach, and perhaps the group rights theory as well, fit best with the cases that establish powerful constitutional protections for parents to direct the religious upbringing of their chil- dren. The Supreme Court has held that parents have a fundamental right under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to rear their children as they see fit.44 Furthermore, in Yoder, the Court suggested that religious freedom includes the ability to control the reli- gious training and education of one's child.45 This vision of strong pa- rental control over child religiosity is particularly compatible with the idea that when a child asserts a free exercise claim, it is really her par- ents' religious rights that are at stake. The parents' rights theory is also compatible - albeit somewhat indirectly - with cases that reinforce the state's parents patriae power over children. For example, in the I944 decision Prince v. Massachu- setts,46 the Supreme Court affirmed the conviction of a Jehovah's Wit- ness for violating state child labor laws by letting her young niece help her distribute religious literature on the street.47 As in Yoder, the child was not a party to the litigation, but Mrs. Prince asserted free exercise claims on behalf of her niece, Betty Simmons, as well as herself.48 In rejecting the appellant's claim, the Court recognized Betty's free exer- cise rights, but it held that the state had greater discretion to restrict minors' - as opposed to adults' - constitutional rights in order to protect children from harm.49 Whereas Yoder and its associated case law implies that children's free exercise rights are subsumed under their parents' more powerful interests, Prince suggests that although parents' rights do not always trump state interests, children still do not enjoy full rights under the Free Exercise Clause. But the other theories are not so easily dismissed. The children's rights approach has an affinity with the common judicial practice of asking children about their views in disputes between divorcing par- ents who disagree about questions of religious upbringing The ma- ture minor idea is compatible not only with Bellotti, but also with the assorted state statutes and state court decisions that reverse the pre- 44 See Troxel v.

The plaintiffs in Alabama and Coushatta Tribes v. Trustees of Big Sandy Independent School Dis- trict52 included a group of Native American students who had been punished for violating their school district's restriction on male stu- dents' hair length. The boys successfully argued that on free exer- cise,53 free speech,54 and procedural due process55 grounds, they were entitled to a preliminary injunction preventing school officials from en- forcing the hair regulation against Native American students.56 To a significant extent, the Big Sandy court treated children as full- fledged holders of religious rights. The court carefully evaluated the boys' testimony about their beliefs in the spiritual importance of wear- ing their hair long, noting with interest that the majority of the stu- dents' parents did not actively share their children's beliefs.57 Ulti- mately, the court concluded that the students' beliefs about the wearing of long hair warranted constitutional protection.8 However, the parents' rights vision is not entirely absent. The dis- trict court stressed that although the students' parents - most of whom were Christian - did not themselves believe in the spiritual significance of long hair, they fully supported and encouraged the boys in following Native American religious practices.59 Furthermore, the parents even prevailed on their own free exercise argument; the court held that the parent plaintiffs had stated a valid claim that the school regulation unconstitutionally burdened their right to direct their chil- dren's religious training.60 Considering that some of the parents in question testified that they were active Christians, rather than practi- tioners of Native American religion,6' this holding reveals that the court assigned substantial weight to the parents' support of their chil- dren's religious practice. 51 See Rhonda Gay Hartman, Adolescent Decisional Autonomy for Medical Care: Physician Perception and Practices, 8 U.

The court emphasized that the boys were part of a larger movement among young Native Americans to return to traditional customs and practices.62 The district court repeatedly referred to the powerful as- similative pressures that Native Americans of earlier generations faced, implying that like the Old Order Amish youth in Yoder, these students were the protectors of an endangered culture.63 The tribe to which the students belonged was a plaintiff in the case, and the court noted the tribe's interest as a group: "[Ilt is evident that the Tribe has an interest in the preservation of its Native American heritage, culture, and religion, and in encouraging its members, especially its young peo- ple, to observe and participate in its sacred ceremonies."64 However, it is also worth noting that the court limited the group rights dimension of its analysis. The court denied the tribe standing as parents patriae, explaining that in this case the tribe did not represent the interests of all of its members.65 The court also rejected a group definition of the students' beliefs: "[T]he fact that some members of the Tribe do not object to cutting their hair does not defeat the plaintiffs' claim. The court must consider the sincerity of the plaintiffs' own re- ligious beliefs, not anyone else's."66 Finally, the opinion in Big Sandy implicitly recognized an individual right to define one's own group identity: several of the student plaintiffs (and their parents) were bap- tized Christians, but they were nevertheless able to assert religious rights as Native Americans.67 No one of the theories suggested here fully explains why, in free ex- ercise cases, unlike in so many other contexts, the courts mostly treat children like adults. But the question remains, how should the courts address children's free exercise claims? Despite the willingness of courts like the one in Big Sandy to rely on multiple theories simulta- neously, in some circumstances, the particular approach selected can be outcome determinative. At a minimum, different theories of chil- dren's religious rights - if followed honestly - entail significantly dif- ferent analyses. The remainder of this Note suggests that recent psy- chology research about children's religious beliefs can usefully inform a choice among different approaches to children's free exercise rights. 62 See id. at I325. 63 See id. at I325, I326 n.2. 64 Id. at I327. 65 Id. 66 Id. at 1330. 67 See id. at I325-26, I330.</page><page sequence="11">2002] CHILDREN AS BELIEVERS 22I5 II. CHILDREN'S RELIGIOUS BELIEFS A. The Persistent Question of Religious Maturity At the heart of the debates about children's religious rights is an uncomfortable question: how seriously should we take children as reli- gious believers? Different approaches to children's religious rights link up68 to very different visions of children's religiosity. A children's rights approach suggests that children of all ages are capable of meaningful religious beliefs.69 As Lori Leff Mueller notes, a model that treats the religious rights of children as identical to those of adults "is most consistent with the view . . . that takes children to be mature creatures of con- science."70 Dissenting in Prince, Justice Murphy emphasized the sin- cerity of Betty Simmons's beliefs: "She testified that she was motivated by her love of the Lord and that He commanded her to distribute this literature; this was, she declared, her way of worshipping God."'" By contrast, children's beliefs are irrelevant in a parents' rights framework. Ms. Mueller explains that such an approach "ignores the question of whether and when a child has a separate religious identity to freely exercise, and simply relegates the youth to her parent's reli- gious control."72 The parents' rights theory meshes nicely with the idea that people do not develop significant religious beliefs until they are adults. In this vision, any beliefs that children might claim to have are qualitatively different from those of the adults around them, even if both the children and the adults profess the same faith. Similarly, limiting free exercise rights to a subset of "mature minors" implies that belief-based religious identity is a product of age; it differs from the parents' rights approach in that it suggests that religious maturity may be attained before age eighteen.73 68 It is important to note that this section does not argue that particular theories about chil- dren's religious rights necessarily assume the different ideas about child religiosity set forth here. 69 See, e.g., Gilbert A. Holmes, Student Religious Expression in School: Is It Religion or Speech, and Does It Matter, 49 U. MIAMI L.

To some extent, the analysis mirrors that of the parents' rights theory; because the dominant interest is that of the group, the child's individ- ual beliefs may be beside the point. However, inasmuch as belief is a central part of membership in a religious group, the group rights the- ory coheres with the notion that children are capable of meaningful belief - at least enough to be considered part of a particular group. The Big Sandy decision reflects this perspective: the district court evaluated the sincerity of the students' beliefs in the context of their membership in the Native American revival movement. Of course, debates about children's free exercise rights present questions about children's religious beliefs only to the extent that belief is a prerequisite for free exercise rights more generally. Although the belief requirement is less important than it used to be, it still persists in modern Free Exercise Clause jurisprudence. Before the Supreme Court's landmark i990 decision in Employ- ment Division v. Smith,74 a claimant could - theoretically, at least - obtain an exemption to even a neutral, nondiscriminatory law by dem- onstrating a sincerely held religious belief that was burdened by the state requirement.75 Courts confronted the explosive and constitution- ally hazardous tasks of evaluating plaintiffs' sincerity, trying to define "religion," and determining what constituted a burden on religious practice.76 The courts therefore took a largely deferential approach to litigants who claimed to be religiously motivated.77 However, the problem of assessing belief was unavoidable, and perhaps this was one of the factors prompting the Court's decision in Smith.78 Writing for a five-Justice majority, Justice Scalia announced that neutral laws of general applicability that happen to burden a reli- gious practice need not be justified by a compelling state interest; states have no constitutional obligation to grant religious objectors ex- emptions to nondiscriminatory laws.79 The Court held that a state could therefore deny unemployment benefits to two men who had been fired for using peyote as part of a Native American religious ritual.80 74 494 U.S. 872 (I990). 75 LAURENCE H.

The Free Exercise Clause still demands strict scrutiny of laws that are not neutral or of general application,8' but courts theoretically need not look past the question of government neutrality to evaluate individual claimants' beliefs. But considerations of belief, especially in cases concerning children, are not as irrelevant as one might initially think. Most significantly, the belief requirement survives Smith inasmuch as plaintiffs still seek exemptions on the basis of a combination of free exercise and other constitutional rights. In an effort to distinguish countervailing prece- dent, especially Yoder, the Smith Court sustained the compelling inter- est test for applying a neutral law of general applicability to religious conduct when claims involve "the Free Exercise Clause in conjunction with other constitutional protections."82 Such "hybrid" claims force courts to assess the sincerity and the religiosity of claimants' beliefs. Ira Lupu has noted that although some commentators have dis- missed the hybrid-rights exception as "specious and unpersuasive," a number of lower courts have relied on it.83 This strain of reasoning has been especially prominent in cases involving children. Not only do parents claim Yoder-style hybrids of free exercise and due process par- enting rights,84 but children assert hybrid free exercise/free speech rights. In Big Sandy, for example, the court - which clearly disliked the Smith decisions' - analyzed the boys' claims as hybrid rights.86 In these hybrid-rights cases, then, the plaintiffs' claims to free exer- cise protection hinge on their status as religious believers. When a child is the claimant, the court confronts some tricky questions. As explained above, different approaches to children's free exercise rights are compatible with different visions of children's religiosity. All of these overlapping theoretical problems can have real-world consequences. For one thing, it matters who gets to articulate the reli- gious interests at stake. Under a parents' rights approach, a court only needs to inquire into the nature of the parents' beliefs. There is no 81 See Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v.

However, as Justice Douglas argued three decades ago, if the courts consider themselves to be addressing the children's rights, they have to ask the children about their own be- liefs. If the children's beliefs happen to differ from those of their par- ents, this inquiry could prove outcome determinative."' Furthermore, in cases where the state is acting in its parents patriae capacity, the particular framework used to analyze the various parties' interests is important. For example, a minor may assert a hybrid free exercise/substantive due process bodily autonomy right to refuse medi- cal treatment. In such circumstances, a government agency may seek a court order authorizing the hospital to treat the child forcibly.88 A court that adopts a parents' rights approach will analyze the case as a conflict between the parents and the state, the latter being aligned with the child. But under a children's rights approach, the dispute is between the child and the state. A group rights analysis would pre- sumably frame the conflict as one between the group and the state.89 These different ways of framing the issue do not necessarily entail dif- ferent results. However, it seems plausible that a court that views the case as involving the override of a mature believer's deeply held reli- gious tenets might reach a different conclusion than would one that sees religious parents trying to martyr their child.90 It is worth noting that the issue of children's religiosity can also arise in a statutory context. In the years since Smith, Congress's sub- sequent attempt to overturn it by statute,91 and the Supreme Court's response in City of Boerne v. Flores,92 several states have enacted laws requiring that any state or local government action that substantially burdens the exercise of religion must be narrowly tailored to serve a 87 Professor Buss notably points out that under a children's rights approach, the state would risk violating a child's constitutional rights every time it resolved a parent's claim to control her child's religious upbringing.

Professor Buss therefore urges a mature minor approach to children's free exercise rights. See id. at 74-75. 88 See, e.g., Niebla by Niebla v. San Diego, No. 90-56302, I992 WL I40250, at *i (gth Cir.

For example, in Cheema v. Thompson,94 three Sikh children, in con- junction with their parents, claimed that their religious beliefs required them to wear ceremonial knives (kirpans) to school.93 They sought a preliminary injunction against the application of the school's weapons ban to them, on state RFRA grounds.96 The Ninth Circuit affirmed the lower court's grant of the injunction.97 However, the dissenting judge hinted that the children's age and maturity undermined their re- ligious claims. He pointedly noted that although Sikhs are permitted to use their kirpans only in "self-defense and the propagation of jus- tice,"98 the Cheema children had been seen playing with theirs.99 The judge cited with approval the lower court's finding that nothingig in the present record suggests that the instruction or advisement given to these children prior to their initiation as Khalsa Sikhs, or that their oath of religion, would divest them of the demeanor, maturity and judgment which equate with their childhood."100 Trying to figure out how the Free Exercise Clause should protect children raises the question of how seriously the courts should take children's professions of religious belief. Admittedly, this is a treacher- ous area. As Ms. Mueller has noted, "[flor the Court or legislature to presume a method of religious acquisition would present no less an in- fringement of the establishment clause than would government defini- tion of 'religion."'101 Moreover, different religions subscribe to differ- ent theories about when children are capable of faith. The courts cannot choose between them without sparking serious Establishment Clause problems. The closest that the Supreme Court has come to confronting this question is in its Establishment Clause jurisprudence, where it has completely failed to resolve it. Establishment Clause cases incorporate two entirely different conceptions of children's religious beliefs. At times, the Court has suggested that the problem with unconstitutional 93 Thomas C.

At other times, though, the Court has said that the worry is that school officials or peers will indoctrinate children with ideas about religion that differ from those of their parents.'03 From this angle, children's religious beliefs appear fragile and unformed, perhaps qualitatively different from those of adults. When trying to decide among different approaches to children's free exercise rights, the question of how seriously to take children as believers is a persistent one. In an effort to illuminate this difficult question, the next section presents recent findings by psychologists about children's religious beliefs. B. Children's Religious Development Infuriated by the Weisman Court's reliance on child-psychology re- search, a dissenting Justice Scalia snapped: "[I]nterior decorating is a rock-hard science compared to psychology practiced by amateurs."'104 Nonetheless, in considering minors' rights, the courts have not infre- quently referred to psychological research about child development.'05 As Professor Buss notes, it is vital for legal scholars to understand how children develop precisely because the law often justifies differential treatment of children on developmental grounds. 106 But a developmental inquiry is not without problems. Commenta- tors raise two salient objections. First, some argue that information about children's development is indeterminate.107 Developmental psy- chology has its own methodological weaknesses, and even the best studies offer limited conclusions.108 Second, some critics challenge the 102 See, e.g., Lee v. Weisman, 505 U.S. 577, 593 (I992) ("[F]or the dissenter of high school age, who has a reasonable perception that she is being forced by the State to pray in a manner her conscience will not allow, the injury is no less real.'); see also Santa Fe Indep.

Aguillard, 482 U.S. 578, 584 (i987) ("Families entrust public schools with the education of their children, but condition their trust on the understanding that the class- room will not purposely be used to advance religious views that may conflict with the private be- liefs of the student and his or her family.

For one thing, because re- searchers cannot immediately observe what subjects are thinking and feeling, their research inevitably relies on children's abilities to under- stand questions posed to them and to articulate answers to those ques- tions. As Carol Satterfield Tate has noted: "[T]o study religiousness, one must be able to conceptualize very abstract ideas in a way that lends itself to data collection as well as one that make sense to the par- ticipants, an especially difficult task when working with young chil- dren.""' Moreover, researchers run a substantial risk that their results will reflect children's increasing facility with language rather than any features of their religious development. Still, as Professor Buss points out, the imperfect answers of devel- opmental psychologists are an improvement on "lawmakers' gues- ses.")112 This section offers an overview of research about children's religious development. It does not aspire to provide a comprehensive survey; rather, it seeks to point legal scholars toward an important, yet oft-neglected, literature. Do children experience religion differently than do adults? Do they believe differently? These questions turn out to be extremely difficult to answer. Research suggests that many children do have personally meaningful spiritual lives. In his remarkable study of children's reli- gious and spiritual thinking, child psychiatrist Robert Coles inter- viewed over five hundred children, many on several occasions, all over the world and from various religious (and nonreligious) traditions.113 Over and over again, his subjects revealed an intense interest in and engagement with traditionally religious questions and concepts." 14 They often thought about those things in ways that likely differed from the adults around them,"5 but there is no denying that their be- liefs were frequently central to their lives. 109 Id. 110 Gardner, Scherer &amp; Tester, supra note I05, at 897-99. 111 Carol Satterfield Tate, Book Review, 5 INT'L J.

This cognitive-devel- opmental approach is rooted in the work of the Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget. Dr. Piaget articulated three stages of cognitive develop- ment. From ages two to seven, children are "intuitive," "pre- operational" thinkers; their thoughts are largely unsystematic and in- consistent. In the second, "concrete operations" stage, which spans ages seven to eleven, children learn to think more systematically about concrete situations. Finally, after age eleven, children develop the ca- pacity for "propositional thinking," which includes abstract and sym- bolic thought."16 Many scholars have drawn on Dr. Piaget's work in describing chil- dren's religious development. In an influential work, British re- searcher Ronald Goldman asked a group of mainly Christian children to interpret various biblical pictures and stories."17 He concluded that children progress through three major stages of religious thinking that correspond roughly to Dr. Piaget's stages of cognitive development: in- tuitive thinking, concrete thinking, and abstract thinking."18 For ex- ample, Dr. Goldman suggests that children first perceive Jesus Christ as a "good man," later as a "miracle worker," and ultimately as a "sav- ior.""19 Subsequent researchers have offered stage sequences to de- scribe other aspects of religious development, such as the understand- ing of prayer or faith development.'20 Recently, however, some researchers have challenged the standard developmental model of children's religious thinking. Rejecting the unidirectional focus of the traditional approach and its emphasis on the development of scientific rationality, they present a different theory of children's cognitive development. Karl Rosengren, Carl Johnson, and Paul Harris identify two major strands to this challenge. First, some scholars suggest that children learn to think about supernatural, magical, or religious phenomena against a background understanding of natural constraints. Other scholars hypothesize that rational and 116 See RONALD GOLDMAN, RELIGIOUS THINKING FROM CHILDHOOD TO ADOLES- CENCE I9-2 I (i964) (describing Dr. Piaget's three-tiered structure). 117 See id. at 36-43, 68-208. 118 Id. at 5i-62. Dr. Goldman also suggested two intermediate stages, intuitive-concrete and concrete-abstract. Id. Dr. Goldman's principal departure from Piaget is the point at which he pins the beginning of the abstract stage; he found that children begin thinking about religion ab- stractly at age thirteen or fourteen, whereas Piaget set the start of propositional thinking at age eleven.

Researchers have discovered that children's religious beliefs - from a cognitive perspective - may be much more similar to those of adults than stage theorists thought. Pascal Boyer has been one of the leading advocates of this position. In a recent article, Professor Boyer and Sheila Walker emphasize that religious concepts are based on counterintuitive assumptions - assumptions that violate ordinary un- derstandings about the way the world works.122 But those who hold religious beliefs accept them as reality.'23 Professors Boyer and Walker suggest that around age seven, children develop a mental "slot" for oc- currences that are both counterintuitive and real. They explain: "In this sense, it is plausible that at around age seven the child acquires a conceptual ability that makes his/her religious concepts much more similar to adults', that is, based on counterintuitive assumptions and clearly distinguished from fiction."124 It does not necessarily follow, however, that children's religious thinking is more "mature" than was previously thought. Professors Boyer and Walker note that the continuities between children's and adults' religious thinking might reveal not only that children think like adults, but also that perhaps "the adult's religious concepts are much more governed by early developed principles than adults themselves (or their religious teachers) would like to think."125 Indeed, an impor- tant critique of much research about religious development in general, and stage theory in particular, is that researchers have too often meas- ured children against an ideal of religious maturity, rather than a de- scription of adults' actual religious thinking.126 For example, stage theorists explain the development of children's God concepts as a set of discrete intervals, proceeding from anthropo- morphic to abstract. Dr. Piaget suggested that children experience 121 IMAGINING THE IMPOSSIBLE: MAGICAL, SCIENTIFIC, AND RELIGIOUS THINKING IN CHILDREN xiii-xiv (Karl S. Rosengren, Carl N. Johnson &amp; Paul L.

Professor Boyer has notably theorized that the acquisi- tion of religious concepts is constrained by preexisting, universal "cog- nitive structures" in the human brain.'30 Children do learn religion from the people around them, but their learning is not passive. Rather, children actively process the information they receive and draw inferences from it. 13' According to Professor Boyer, religion per- sists over time because religious concepts and their associated emotions are a particularly good fit with the "templates" in all human minds, and are therefore more likely to be transmitted between generations.132 E. Margaret Evans's study of creationist beliefs in children offers some empirical support for Professor Boyer's theory. She compared the distribution of creationist, spontaneous generationist, and evolu- tionist beliefs in two sets of elementary school children, one drawn from Christian fundamental communities and the. other from nonfun- damentalist communities.'33 Interestingly, she found that parents' be- liefs about creationism "underdetermine the beliefs of their children, at 127 See Justin L.

As they grow older, children acquire general cultural knowledge that lends clarity to their religious understand- ings,'38 and of course, religiously educated children learn about the tenets of their particular faiths.139 Are children's religious beliefs more malleable than adults'? No clear answer to this question has emerged. Innumerable studies have shown that parents exert a powerful influence on their children's thinking about religion.'40 What is unclear is the extent to which out- side forces influence adults' religious beliefs. In a longitudinal survey of eighty-four male college graduates, Jack D. Shand found that most of the subjects who were certain of their belief in God while in college maintained this belief throughout their lives.'41 For those whose be- liefs changed - in either direction - personal interactions with reli- gious persons and emotional responses to experiences concerning relig- ion seemed to be significant.'42 But there appears to be little, if any, research comparing the variability of religious beliefs across persons of different ages. 134 Evans, Beyond Scopes, supra note I33, at 325. 135 Id. at 324. 136 Id. at 305. 137 Id. at 327 (The causal model in which adult creationist beliefs are embedded is much more complex and coherent than that of young children's creationism."). 138 Boyer &amp; Walker, supra note 122, at I49-50. 139 See, e.g., Marie Bourdeau &amp; Darren M.

Implications For some, these findings may simply add more ammunition to the Smith approach to free exercise. As noted above,143 different religions have varying tenets about children's religious maturity, and a court that tries to select one particular perspective is stepping into a consti- tutional minefield. Although some will argue that psychological evi- dence like that presented here offers courts a neutral way out of this dilemma, it is equally plausible to argue that it only compounds the problem if courts must choose between social science and religion. Setting this concern aside, however, one can draw a few tentative conclusions about how this research might bear on debates about chil- dren's religious rights. The psychological evidence suggests that even relatively young children can have personally meaningful religious be- liefs that, from a cognitive perspective, do not differ dramatically from those of adults. Therefore, perhaps we should move cautiously before adopting a perspective -such as the parents' rights theory - that en- tirely disregards children as independent believers. There may still be good reasons to limit children's free exercise rights. The interest of family harmony may counsel against courts' ac- tively inquiring into children's religious beliefs every time their parents claim a right to direct their religious upbringing. Religious maturity may not go hand-in-hand with maturity in other areas; some children - the Cheema children, for example - may lack the capacities neces- sary to exercise even sincerely held religious beliefs. However, such policy arguments should not be confused with mistaken assumptions about children's supposed inability to form sophisticated religious be- liefs. And courts should be clear about their value judgments.144 Similarly, these findings add weight to the already strong argument that at least some minors should be presumed capable of making their own religiously motivated medical decisions. A number of develop- mental psychologists have found that minors fifteen and older are as competent as adults to make medical decisions.145 The research about children's religious development suggests that adolescents' religious claims are equally similar to those of adults. When a Jehovah's Wit- ness teenager freely refuses a blood transfusion for religious reasons, then, there are compelling reasons to respect her decision. Finally, this research presents a challenge to proponents of a group rights vision of free exercise rights. To the extent that group member- ship is contingent on belief, a child has the cognitive capacity to be as 143 See p. 22I9. 144 See Buss, supra note 36, at I282 (arguing that if parents' and children's free exercise inter- ests conflict, "it is incumbent upon the courts to at least own up to the choice they are making'). 145 See Hartman, supra note 5i, at 96.</page><page sequence="23">2002] CHILDREN AS BELIEVERS 2227 much a member of a religious group as an adult. However, children's religious beliefs do not always conform to the orthodoxy of those around them. This means that plaintiffs who assert a group rights ar- gument - as well as the court that affirms or denies it - must care- fully explain why a particular child should or should not be considered a member of the group. This will likely push the discussion toward a related body of psychological research, about the development of iden- tity and children's sense of religious affiliation.'46 It is not at all clear how these issues will ultimately play out, but as Professor Buss has ob- served, "[t]he value of the inquiry is not that it can simplify the analy- sis but rather than it can facilitate a more intelligent consideration of complexities."'47 III. CONCLUSION The issue of children's free exercise rights is exceptionally compli- cated and rife with emotion. Debates about religion are debates about ultimate truth, and adult believers necessarily want their children and those of their coreligionists - to have the freedom to embrace openly what they feel deeply is the truth. Yet children's claims to reli- gious belief, if taken seriously, also have the potential to be profoundly subversive. Secular courts in a religiously heterogeneous country are ill-equipped to deal with these matters. This Note has tried to offer some help. 146 See Buss, supra note 36, at I258-76. 147 Id. at I257.</page></plain_text>
