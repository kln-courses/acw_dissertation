<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE INDEBTEDNESS OF ISRAEL TO ITS NEIGHBORS' BY J. M. P. SMITH University of Chicago The Hebrews were, of course, closely related to many of their neigh- bors. They were members of the great Semitic family. This included Assyrians, Babylonians, Arameans, Moabites, Amorites, Syrians, and Hebrews. Their languages were all very closely related. The Moabite Stone, e.g., may be read with the greatest ease by any Hebrew scholar. There are many words in common between Hebrew and Assyrian. Not only so, but the Hebrews spent several years in Egypt, and at a later period they were transferred to Babylonia. After the Exile many of them took refuge in Egypt again, as is evidenced by the Assuan papyri. It would be very unreasonable to suppose that they had gained noth- ing by their residence in either of these countries. Another factor that added much to their store of information was the fact that their home for centuries was located in Palestine. Now Palestine has long been called the "bridge" connecting the Fertile Crescent with Egypt. There was always much intercourse between Egypt and Babylonia. Commerce between the east and the south- west had to pass over the Palestinian bridge. But travel in those days was not expedited by express trains, aeroplanes, telegrams, and tele- phones as it is today. The merchants, travelers, and armies had to transport themselves on foot, on horseback, or by camels. This meant that what now requires but a few hours then extended over days and weeks. Intercourse of the Hebrews with the many travelers over the Palestinian bridge was inevitable. So many new ideas regarding the world at large and regarding the God of that world were doubtless also absorbed by the Hebrew mind. Then also literature passed back and forth between the countries. I [With this number devoted to the honor of J. M. P. Smith's memory we are in our misfortune fortunate. Once more, probably for the last time in a Journal article, we are able to let our lamented colleague speak to the readers of this, peculiarly his own, Journal. The paper here printed was read before the Oxford Society for O. T. Study, in its meeting at Birmingham, England, July 12-14, 1932. It speaks to us with particular force in the gentle accents of maturity which in these later years we have learned to associate with the personality of our departed EDITOR.] 172</page><page sequence="2">THE INDEBTEDNESS OF ISRAEL TO ITS NEIGHBORS 173 In recent years we have found the Tell-el-Amarna letters in Egypt, in which Palestinian chiefs report to the Pharaoh and Egyptian officials regarding the state of affairs in their respective regions. We have also found the story of Ahikar and the Behistun inscription among the Aramaic papyri unearthed at Elephantine in Egypt. This sort of thing shows that there were no iron walls separating one nation from an- other; but that all doors and gates were wide open so that there was free access into each country for new ideas and customs. That being so, it is not unreasonable to expect to find traces in the Old Testament of foreign influences which have been taken over by the Hebrews and been incorporated into their Sacred Book. As a matter of fact, that expectation has been realized. The latest discovery of this sort has been the learning of the fact that a section of the wisdom of an Egyptian sage, named Amen-em-ope, has been incorporated in the Hebrew Book of Proverbs. The section of Proverbs which origi- nated in Egypt is Prov. 22:17-24:22. The date of the origin of the Egyptian proverbs is somewhat uncertain. The time fixed for them by scholars varies. For example, Amen-em-ope was placed in the 18th dynasty by E. A. Wallis Budge, i.e., between 1580 and 1350 B.c.; Erman and Lange, however, locate him under the 21st or 22nd dynasty, i.e., between 1090 and 745 B.c.; Llewellyn Griffith puts him somewhere between the 21st and the 26th dynasties, i.e., between 1090 and 663 B.c.; while Allan Gardiner would place him toward the end of the 20th dynasty, i.e., ca. 1090 B.c. In any case, the wisdom of Amen-em-ope is the original; it is not borrowed from the Hebrew, but the Hebrew has borrowed it. This is clear from the fact that Prov. 22:20 says "Yes, I have written for you these thirty sayings, Respect- ing counsel and knowledge." Amen-em-ope also says, "Look for thy- self upon these 30 chapters to enjoy them and to be instructed by them." Now where did this use of the figure 30 arise? In chapter 19 of the papyrus of Amen-em-ope thirty judges are mentioned, each of whom bases judgment upon a special sin in accordance with a certain special rule. Hence there are thirty of these rules. That accounts for the "thirty sayings" of Proverbs. One other example of identity of expression in the two documents may be listed. Amen-em-ope begins his discourse with these words, "Incline thine ears and hear my words and set thy heart thereon to understand them. It is good if thou set</page><page sequence="3">174 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SEMITIC LANGUAGES them in thy heart . . .. so they may be a 'stake upon thy tongue'." In Prov. 22:17 we read: Bend your ear, and hear the words of the wise, And apply your mind to know them,- For it is well that you should keep them within you, That you should fix them as a stake upon your lips. Another significant fact that should not be overlooked is that within the selection of Prov. 22:17-24:22 there are exactly thirty proverbs, just as there are thirty chapters in the papyrus of Amen-em-ope. Some of the proverbs in Prov. 22:17-24:22 are as long as some of the chap- ters in Amen-em-ope's work. When comparing Amen-em-ope with Prov. 22:17-24:22, it at once becomes apparent that the Hebrew borrower was very wise and exercised excellent judgment. He is careful to omit all references to the Egyptian gods and to adhere strictly to a monotheistic standpoint. Not only so, but he also sometimes transforms an obscure phrase or word into an idiom that will be intelligible to his Hebrew readers. In view of the practical identity of many of the maxims in Prov. 22:17-24:22, with those in the Wisdom of Amen-em-ope, it is more than probable that there was close relationship in general between Egyptian wisdom as a whole and Hebrew wisdom. Indeed, the French scholar Humbert2 has called attention already to the very close anal- ogies between these two fields in very many cases. It is scarcely possi- ble that these similarities in so many cases should be purely accidental. An interesting case of borrowing is to be found in the story of Joseph and Potiphar's wife. Egyptian mythology contains a parallel story, which is far older. The Egyptian tale goes back as far as 1200 B.C. This is a story of two brothers, the elder and the younger. The younger brother was intrusted with everything about his older brother's place. One day the two of them went out to the field to work. While they were there the older one sent his younger brother back to the house to get some seed-corn. When he arrived there he found his brother's wife dressing her hair. After a few minutes of conversation between them, she made the proposal to him that Potiphar's wife made to Joseph. Her brother-in-law, however, indignantly repudiated the suggestion, 2 Recherches sur les sources egyptiennes de la litt'rature sapientiale d'Israel (1929), chap. ii, pp. 17-74.</page><page sequence="4">THE INDEBTEDNESS OF ISRAEL TO ITS NEIGHBORS 175 saying to her, "Behold you are to me as a mother, your husband is to me as a father; for he who is older than I brought me up. What is this wickedness which you have said to me? Say it not to me again; for I will not tell it to any man; for I will not let it be uttered by the mouth of any man." He thereupon returned with his load of corn to his brother in the field; and they continued with their work until nightfall. Upon entering his house the older brother found his wife acting as though she were very ill. Upon inquiring of her what was the matter, she replied that his younger brother had made an indecent proposal to her and that when she had refused to yield to it, he had beaten her to stop her from reporting the matter to her husband. From that point on the story is full of mythological wonders. The Hebrew story is based upon exactly the same kind of episode; the attitudes of Joseph and the younger brother are the same; and the reaction of the wife is just like that of Potiphar's wife in the Hebrew tale. Since the Hebrews, at least a part of them, spent some time in Egypt, and since the episodes are so much alike, it is altogether prob- able that the Hebrews learned the story in Egypt and brought it with them into Palestine, where in course of time they re-wrote it, furnish- ing new characters for it and pruning it of all its old pagan, mythologi- cal growths. We must now turn our attention away from Egypt to the eastern side of the ancient Orient. Here dwelt the Babylonians, Assyrians, and Hittites. Contact with the Babylonians and Assyrians on the part of the Hebrews was extensive and, indeed, almost continuous. They were in Palestine long before the Hebrews arrived there. When the Hebrews did settle in Palestine, they found the law of the Babylonian king, Hammurabi, in full force there. They themselves knew prac- tically nothing about the manner of life followed by civilized peoples. They were untutored nomads from the desert. Some of them had been in Egypt, indeed, for a long time. But the generation that had known Egypt had died before Palestine was entered. Consequently, it was only the younger element that reached Palestine; and they had to learn Palestinian ways from the people of Palestine themselves. But the inhabitants of Palestine were living under the Hammurabi Code and could teach the newcomers only what they themselves knew. A comparison of the Covenant Code with the Code of Hammurabi</page><page sequence="5">176 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SEMITIC LANGUAGES shows that the latter was heavily drawn upon by the makers of the Covenant Code. C. H. W. Johns as long ago as A.D. 1912 said, "It has been calculated that out of 45, or possibly 55, judgments preserved in this old Hebrew law [i.e., the Covenant Code] 35 have points of con- tact with the Hammurabi Code, and quite half are parallel!'!" There are 282 laws in the Code of Hammurabi, but only 50 in the Covenant Code. It is therefore self-evident that the Hebrews did not take over the Code of Hammurabi in its entirety, but merely made selections from it of such laws as met their needs. Still further, it is clear that the Code of Hammurabi was legislating for a much more advanced and complex stage of civilization than was the Covenant Code. The stat- utes of the latter are much simpler than those of the former. The social order for which Hammurabi prepared his law was much more complex than that for which the Covenant Code was prepared. In the Baby- lonian Code at least three classes were recognized in society, viz., the noble, the freeman, and the slave. For each of these there was a dis- tinct standard of value and responsibility; while in the Covenant Code the only distinction made was between the slave and his owner. Fur- thermore, the provisions in the case of each law in Hammurabi's Code are much more detailed and elaborate and presuppose a much greater experience with the customs of an advanced social and economic order than is the case with the precepts of the Covenant Code. Those who wish to compare in detail the Covenant Code with the Code of Hammurabi may turn to the second chapter of my book on The Origin and History of Hebrew Law (1931), in which book will be found a new translation of the Code of Hammurabi by my late col- league, Dr. D. D. Luckenbill. A general comparison reveals the fact that the Covenant Code was in no sense a mere slavish copy of the Code of Hammurabi. This is evident from the fact that much of the material in the Babylonian Code does not appear at all in the Cove- nant Code. It is also true that some of the laws in the Covenant Code are not known in the Code of Hammurabi. In its present form the Covenant Code is in most of its regulations far ahead of the Code of Hammurabi, so far as religious and humanitarian qualities go. Ham- murabi in the prologue and epilogue to his Code prides himself upon * The Relations between the Laws of Babylonia and the Laws of the Hebrew People ("Schweich Lectures," 1912) (1914), p. 49.</page><page sequence="6">THE INDEBTEDNESS OF ISRAEL TO ITS NEIGHBORS 177 his philanthropic and religious deeds and attitudes, but none of these elements appears in the legislation of the code itself. Hammurabi urges such considerations upon his successors, and claims great religious and philanthropic qualities and attitudes for himself, which claims in all probability are unreal and imaginary. But the Covenant Code em- bodies both religion and philanthropy in its regulations; and urges their practice upon everybody. The Code of Hammurabi provides for the charging of high interest for loans, whereas the Covenant Code prohibits all interest; and this prohibition continued in force until the time of Herod the Great, when the Prosbol was introduced by Hillel, which interpretation of the law did away with the prohibition. In Hammurabi's Code a debtor might be reduced to slavery for three years; then he gets his freedom. In the Covenant Code such a debtor has to serve as a slave for six years, be- fore he becomes free. Several laws in the Covenant Code make provi- sion for the poor and needy; but this class is not recognized by the Code of Hammurabi. The differences between the two codes are too many to justify any view that the Hebrew Code was based upon the Code of Hammurabi. It is true that both codes are arranged in groups of five and ten laws. It is also a fact that the laws of the two Codes deal to a very great ex- tent with the same kinds of social and economic problems. In some cases also, the offenses and the penalties are essentially the same in the two codes. It is reasonable, therefore, to assume that the Hebrews got the idea of formulating a Code for themselves directly from the fact that they found a Babylonian code of laws in force among the Canaanites, in whose land they settled down. They showed great skill in re-writing a code of laws for themselves which took account of their progress in civilization and adapted itself to the needs and limitations of their race and time. It is quite unlikely that the Hebrews took no account whatsoever of the Code of Hammurabi which they found in force in Canaan. It is probable that the law providing for a term of six years' service on the part of a slave (Exod. 21:2-10) was a deliber- ate doubling of the three-year period fixed by the Babylonian law. In- deed, Deuteronomy (13:12-18) calls attention to this fact and tries to explain it. The law regarding brutal treatment of slaves (Exod. 21:20-21) is without a parallel in Hammurabi's Code, and so probably</page><page sequence="7">178 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SEMITIC LANGUAGES represents an effort to ameliorate the conditions laid down by that code. The older part of the Covenant Code is that fixing the judgments and the penalties (Exod. 20:23-22:20). The remainder of the Code (22:21-23:33) is more religious and more humane. The influence of the Code of Hammurabi is more apparent in this early section than in the later portion. But it is quite evident that the Hebrew lawmakers felt perfectly free to make such variations from Hammurabi's Code as they saw fit. But it must not be forgotten that the Code of Ham- murabi was, roughly speaking, a thousand years old when the Cove- nant Code was formulated; hence it may have undergone much change in that long period of time. Not only so, but conditions in Canaan were entirely different from those in Babylonia. Canaan was a hilly and, relatively speaking, a dry country. Babylonia was a flat, fertile country. So the economic and social status of the two countries was entirely different. Babylonia was rich, but Canaan was poor. There- fore in the very nature of the case, the legislation of the two countries was bound to differ at many points. Thus it would be unreasonable to expect to find the laws of the two lands closely similar. In the very nature of the case, the legislators must be allowed the liberty of adapt- ing their laws to the differing conditions for which they were intended. It is enough to give the Code of Hammurabi credit for having fur- nished the impetus for the Covenant Code and having provided the framework upon which that code was modeled. Where laws are prac- tically identical in the two codes, it may well be that there was some dependence of the Covenant Code upon the Code of Hammurabi. We now pass from the realm of law to the sphere of literature. The Jews were carried into exile in Babylonia at the time of the Exile. How long they stayed there is not definitely known; but the shortest period was forty years, while many of them were there a much longer time. A half-century yielded time enough for them to become ac- quainted with the literature of the Babylonians, especially since He- brew and the language of Babylonia were so closely related. The fact that the Hebrews spent the period of exile in Babylonia does not pre- vent the possibility of their having secured a familiarity with Baby- lonian ideas long before the Exile. The story of Creation in the P document (Gen. 1:1-2:3) is too radically different from all the Baby-</page><page sequence="8">THE INDEBTEDNESS OF ISRAEL TO ITS NEIGHBORS 179 lonian Creation stories and fragments of stories to permit anyone to posit the view that the Babylonian story furnished the priestly writer the basis for the story that he has given us in Genesis, chapter 1. The Babylonian story is grossly polytheistic and anthropomorphic; while the Hebrew story is, in general, splendidly monotheistic. Yet there are sufficient elements common to the two stories to make it more than probable to suppose that the priestly author was familiar with the Babylonian story, but deliberately re-wrote it so as to make it express his own monotheistic standpoint. The points common to the two stories are the following: The pre-Creation universe in both stories was a great waste of water; both stories posit the division of the watery waste by the creation of a firmament; both stories agree that there is a supercelestial ocean (Gen. 1:7); the word tPhom, which means "abyss," is the same word as the Babylonian Tiamat, the name of the goddess whose body is made to constitute the firmament and the sky; both stories place the origin of the heavens in the fourth stage of creation and the creation of man in the sixth, the plural form of the verb in Gen. 1:26, viz., "let us make," is apparently an unconscious reflection of the polytheistic tone of the Babylonian story; in Genesis, chapter 1, "a tempestuous wind was raging over the surface of the waters," while in the Babylonian story the "god Marduk equips himself for his struggle with Tiamat by enlisting "four great winds" as auxili- aries; and finally in both stories man's close relationship to the deity is brought out. In Genesis man is made "in the image of God" (Gen. 1:27), while in the Babylonian story man is made from the blood of the slain god, Kingu. In the older story of the Creation and Fall of Man (Gen. 2:4-3:24) we might expect to find more and closer points of contact with the Babylonian literature, but the contrary is a matter of fact. In one of the fragments of the Babylonian creation story we are told that there was a great stream which creates everything. This probably appears in J's story of creation, for in Gen. 2:10-14 we read of a river flowing out of Eden and spilling into four branches, two of which are the Tigris and Euphrates, the two great rivers of Babylonia and Assyria. Then there is also an "P in Gen. 2:6 which rose from the earth and watered all the face of the ground. This word "; almost certainly ought to be rendered "river," for the statement that it waters all the surface of the</page><page sequence="9">180 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SEMITIC LANGUAGES ground certainly fits a river much better than it does a "mist." Not only so, but the Babylonian word edu means "flood," "high tide," etc., and is much nearer to "river" than it is to "mist." The Garden of Eden in the J story (Gen. 2:8) is the same as the "garden of the gods" in the Babylonian story, and the word Eden is identical with the Babylonian word edinnu, which describes the plain in Mesopotamia. Thus it appears that the J story of the creation of man has some knowl- edge of the Babylonian traditions, but that the writer of the J story was in any way inspired by the Babylonian story or controlled by it is out of the question, since the content and ideas of the two stories are entirely different. Another source which strongly influenced Hebrew literature is the Babylonian story of the flood. It differs from the Hebrew story in many respects. The flood, for example, is but a local deluge, not uni- versal like the Hebrew flood. The gods also are numerous and they quarrel among themselves. But on the other hand there are so many points of contact between the two that it is unreasonable to try to ac- count for the similarities as accidental and fortuitous. In both stories man is warned beforehand by the gods that the flood is coming. He is told to build a ship and embark all kinds of life, animals, seeds of vegetation, etc., upon the ship. In both stories man takes his entire family on board with him and a full supply of nutrition for the pas- sengers. In both cases, likewise, the ship is coated outside and within with pitch. In both, man embarks; and the ship's door is closed, in the Babylonian story by man himself, but in the Hebrew story by Yah- weh. In both stories the flood is so deep that the water covers the mountains. The ship lands upon a mountain where the passengers finally disembark. The Babylonian story tells of the sending-out of a dove and a swallow from the ship to see if the waters had abated; both of which returned to the ship. Then finally a raven was sent out which did not return. In the Hebrew story only a dove and a raven were sent out for the same reason. In Hebrew and Babylonian stories alike man offers a sacrifice immediately upon disembarking. In both stories the gods smell the odor of the sacrifice and are pleased and placated; and they promise that there shall never be another such flood. In the light of so many similarities it is foolish to attempt to deny connection between the two stories. That the Babylonian story is the original of</page><page sequence="10">THE INDEBTEDNESS OF ISRAEL TO ITS NEIGHBORS 181 the two is clear from the fact that in its oldest form it goes back to the age of Hammurabi (ca. 2000 B.C.) or even farther, while the Hebrew story in the J document's section did not originate until somewhere about 850 B.C. and in the P section probably not until ca. 444 B.C. The J document's part in the story is contained in Gen. 6:5-8; 7:1-5, 7-10, 12, 16b, 17b, 22; 8:2b-3a; 6:12, 13b, 20-22; while the P narrative of the flood is represented by Gen. 6:9-22; 7:6,11, 13-16a, 17a, 18-21, 24; 8:1-2a, 3b-5, 13a, 14-19; 9:1-17. In these two sections of the Hebrew flood-story Babylonian influ- ence is to be seen, but the predominant element of that influence is evident in the later strand. This is quite natural since the Hebrews had spent at least a half-century in Babylonia during the Exile and thus had had abundant opportunity to refresh their memory as to Babylonian customs and traditions. Another institution that seems to have originated in Babylonia and to have been taken over by the Hebrews is the Sabbath. There has been much keen debate upon this question in recent years. Certainly the Hebrew Sabbath was an entirely different institution from the Babylonian original. It was reorganized and transformed in such a way as to make it become thoroughly Hebraic and to lose practically all its original Babylonian characteristics. Yet the name Sabbath is evidently a reproduction of the Babylonian Sabattum. This Sabattum was observed on the seventh, fourteenth, twenty-first, and twenty- eighth days of the intercalary month, the second Elul. The nineteenth day of the month was also included and seems to have been more strictly observed than any of the other four days. This day is ac- counted for by scholars by pointing out that it is the seventh Sabbath from the beginning of the preceding month. It is uncertain whether or not these Sabbaths were observed in every month of the year. These days upon which all kinds of work were prohibited on the part of the king and the physician were not called Sabattum, but the fifteenth day of the month was so called. This word Sabattum is equated with the word gamaru, which means "be complete" or "be full." Hence it is clear that the fifteenth day of the month was the day upon which the moon became "full." If, as some scholars hold, the Hebrew Sabbath was originally the day of the full moon, as in Babylonia, that fact would raise an interesting problem. The mountain Sinai was in the</page><page sequence="11">182 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SEMITIC LANGUAGES wilderness of Sin. Both of these names, Sin and Sinai, presuppose some relation to the god Sin. Sin was the Semitic moon-god. The Hebrews came to the wilderness of Sin on the fifteenth day of the second month after leaving Egypt. On the third new moon after leav- ing Egypt they arrived at Sinai. These data all seem to indicate some recognition of the moon-god in early Israel. But we cannot pursue that subject any farther now.4 In any case it seems reasonably clear that the Hebrews borrowed their institution of the Sabbath from their Semitic cousins in Babylonia. One more point of contact between the Hebrews and their Semitic neighbors must be considered. That is the divine name, Yahweh, it- self. It has long been known that the God Yahweh was recognized long before the revelation at Sinai. In Exod. 3:15 we read, "God said further to Moses, 'This is what you are to say to the Israelites: Yah- weh, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, has sent me to you. This is my name for all time, and this is my title for age after age.'" We know that the name Yahweh was used out- side of Israel some centuries before the birth of the Israelitish nation. Some tablets from the time of the 1st dynasty of Babylon (ca. 2000 B.c.) contained three forms of a single name, viz., Ya-a-ve-ilu, Ya-ve- ilu, and Ya-u-um-ilu; all three evidently mean "Yahweh is God." Likewise a tablet found by Sellin's excavations at Tell Tacannek con- tains the name Ahi-yami, which is the same as the Hebrew Ahijah. "Jah" may be an abbreviation of "Yahweh." This is dated all the way from 2000 to 1300 B.c. A much more convincing evidence of the presence of the name "Yahu" outside of Israel is found in the name of a king of Hamath, in North Syria, who was defeated by Sargon of Assyria toward the end of the eighth century B.C. This name appears in the form Ya-u-bidi. The significant fact is that the determinative for "God," viz., ilu, appears before the form Ya-u. Not only so, but a variant of this name appears in the form Ilu-bidi. This name in the form in which it is written makes certain the fact that the name Ya-u is that of a god. Of course it comes from a relatively late period, the eighth century B.C., but since the king in question was a Hittite and since the name Ya-u has been found outside of Israel already at a 4 The first writer to suggest a connection of Yahweh with Sin, the moon-god, was C. F. Burney, The Book of Judges, pp. 249-53.</page><page sequence="12">THE INDEBTEDNESS OF ISRAEL TO ITS NEIGHBORS 183 much earlier period, it is exceedingly improbable that this king's name was borrowed from the Hebrews. On the contrary, it would seem that the Hebrews obtained their god Yahweh from some one of their neigh- boring peoples. Where the name first appeared is as yet unknown. For though the tablets in which the name is first seen come from the 1st dynasty of Babylon, it is pretty generally recognized that this dynasty represented a movement of Beduins into Babylonia. Hence the definite designation of the clan or tribe is at present doubtful. Sayce, Hommel, and Burney5 agree that the Amorite immigrants into Babylonia, who founded the first dynasty there, must be given credit for the origin of the name Yahu. This would mean that the name was first used by some ancestors of the Hebrews themselves or of their close relatives. The thing common to all the cases so far cited is the fact that the Hebrews did not stop with borrowing from their neighbors. In every case they greatly improved upon borrowed matter. They eliminated all the pagan gods and pagan ideas and practices that originally formed part of the borrowed material and filled its place with good Hebraic ideas and customs. The polytheism of the old stories gave way to the Hebrew worship of Yahweh. The crude customs of early times were revised and brought up to date. The unethical principles embodied in some of these old stories were discarded and new moral ideals took their place. The Hebrews thus greatly enriched the stories of which they made use. Take the case of the God-idea, for example; the god Yahu was undoubtedly before his adoption by the Hebrews one of the many crude pagan deities of the Oriental world. In the hands of the He- brews, he grew steadily greater and greater, passing from the stage of polytheism, through monolatry, into monotheism. Along with this growth in the scope of his powers, there went side by side with it a corresponding growth in the character of the God-idea. Things that were taken as a matter of course at the beginning were steadily dropped, if too crude; if otherwise, they were gradually transformed, until the character of Yahweh came to be the ideal of all men. 5 See ibid., pp. 243 ff., where a complete statement of all the available data may be found.</page><page sequence="13">184 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SEMITIC LANGUAGES In the light of this experience, the Hebrews must be looked upon not as literary thieves but as benefactors of the human race. They had a splendid faculty for improving whatever bit of literature came into their hands. They were generous donors of their best ideas and ideals to the world at large. They stand out at the present time as the creators of the finest collection of religious literature in the world. We must remember that at the time when the Bible was written there was no such thing known as a copyright law. Whenever a writer issued a piece of literature it at once became public property. There was no embargo upon the use of it by the world at large. Hence the Hebrews in borrowing these pieces of literature were breaking no law; but they were making invaluable contributions to the world's literature. We might therefore change the title of this paper to read "The World's Indebtedness to the Jews."</page></plain_text>
