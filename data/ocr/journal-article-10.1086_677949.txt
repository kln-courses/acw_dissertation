      <p>The adoption of an environmental policy usually imposes costs on society, but it is expected to yield a social return in the form of a stream of benefits, for example, health benefits from less pollution. Those benefits, however, usually occur in the future and may be highly uncertain, so that (as with other private or public investments) the actual return is uncertain. This is especially true for environmental policies involving stock externalities, such as increases in greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations, the acidification of lakes and oceans, and the accumulation of toxic waste. All of these problems involve long time horizons and uncertain impacts. This paper examines the risk/return trade-off for environmental investments and the implications of that trade-off for policy design. To illustrate the basic idea, I utilize a very simple and stylized model of climate change, which involves a long time horizon and considerable uncertainty. However, the framework developed here could well be applied to other environmental (and nonenvironmental) policy problems, such as the management of toxic waste and the development and protection of water resources.<sup>1</sup> My use of climate change is done purely as an illustrative example.</p>
      <p>Consider a policy to reduce GHG accumulation, for example, a carbon tax. The policy would have some cost to society, but by reducing GHG emissions it would reduce the extent of warming by some uncertain amount and thus yield uncertain future benefits. The uncertainty arises because we have limited knowledge of the relationship between GHG concentrations and temperature, and between higher temperatures and GDP growth. A question then arises. To what extent is the social value of the policy (measured by society’s willingness to pay for it) driven by its expected benefits versus uncertainty over those benefits?</p>
      <p>The answer to this question can guide policy design. Alternative policies might have different impacts on the expected change in temperature over the next century versus the variance of that change. For example, rather than (or in addition to) GHG emissions abatement, money might be spent to improve our knowledge of how GHG emissions affect temperature and how changes in temperature affect economic output. A purely research-focused policy might do little or nothing to reduce expected future damages, but it might reduce the variance of those damages. Likewise, investments in adaptation to climate change (e.g., the development of hardier hybrid crops) could reduce the right tail of the distribution of future damages, reducing both the variance and expectation of damages.<sup>2</sup>
      </p>
      <p>There is value in reducing the expected damages from GHG emissions and in reducing the variance of those damages; at issue is the trade-off between the two. To what extent should policy be aimed at reducing the expectation versus the variance of damages?<sup>3</sup>
      </p>
      <p>The framework I use to address this question is “willingness to pay” (WTP). Consider a policy that would reduce expected future temperature increases and/or the variance of those increases. The WTP for the policy is the maximum percentage of current and future consumption that society would give up to achieve those reductions. This does not mean it would be possible to achieve these reductions given the revenues from this WTP; doing so may be more costly, or less costly. WTP relates only to the demand side of policy: it is society’s reservation price for the achievement of particular policy objectives.</p>
      <p>In Pindyck (2011b, 2012b), I calculated the WTP for GHG abatement policies that would limit future increases in temperature to some specified amount (e.g., 3°C), based on a probability distribution for the rate of warming under “business as usual” (BAU). Of course WTP depends on the probability distribution, and in particular on both the expected temperature increase under BAU and the variance of the increase. I calculated the trade-off between the expected value of a temperature increase versus its standard deviation under BAU as determinants of WTP. That trade-off is the marginal rate of substitution along an “iso-WTP curve,” that is, the locus of combinations of the expected value versus the standard deviation of the change in temperature under BAU such that the WTP is constant. The results showed that for a society that is risk averse, uncertainty over temperature change can indeed be a strong driver of WTP.</p>
      <p>In that earlier work, I took the policy objective—limiting the temperature increase to some amount—as given and simply examined the implications of the starting conditions, that is, the extent to which the WTP for the policy depends on the variance of the temperature increase. Here I turn to the design of policy by considering alternative objectives and, in particular, the trade-off between reducing the expected rate of increase in temperature versus reducing its variance. Thus I ask, What combinations of drift reduction and variance reduction yield the same WTP? Those combinations trace out a social indifference curve—combinations of changes in drift and variance that are welfare equivalent. This social indifference curve provides a framework for policy design in that any policy objectives on the curve have the same impact on welfare. To my knowledge, this paper is the first to address environmental policy design in the context of a trade-off between risk and return.</p>
      <p>Given this social indifference curve, what combination of risk and return should society aim for? If one could estimate the costs of drift reduction and variance reduction (no easy task), we could take this a step further and compare the cost of a particular combination of drift and variance reduction to the WTP for that combination, that is, whether the policy yields a positive social surplus. Finally, assuming the costs are weakly convex (as we would expect), we can determine the optimal risk-return trade-off for policy design.</p>
      <p>Why focus only on the variance of changes in an environmental variable (such as temperature) and not also on higher-order moments (such as skewness and kurtosis)? First, I want a model that is reasonably simple and easy to understand, both in terms of the process for the environmental variable and the utility function used to measure welfare. Second, I want to draw an analogy to the mean-variance risk-return trade-off facing investors in financial markets, an analogy that I believe provides insight and also creates a bridge between finance and environmental economics. Finally, expanding the social utility function so that it “values” higher-order moments requires ad hoc assumptions that are hard to justify.</p>
      <p>In the next section, I lay out a simple model of a stock externality in which an environmental variable evolves stochastically and affects the growth rate of consumption. Using a simple constant relative risk aversion (CRRA) social utility function, I show how the model can be used to calculate the WTP for policies to reduce expected damages and/or the variance of damages, and I show how one can find the optimal target mix. In section 2, as an illustrative exercise, I do a rough calibration of the model to information on global warming and its impact, and then show how the model can be used to address risk-return trade-offs in the design of policy. Section 3 concludes.</p>

         <title>Risk, Return, and Willingness to Pay</title>
         <p>To illustrate the idea of a risk-return policy trade-off, I assume that there is an environmental stock variable <italic>X<sub>t</sub>
            </italic> which is “bad,” in that it reduces the growth rate <italic>g<sub>t</sub>
            </italic> of GDP and consumption. Under BAU, <italic>X<sub>t</sub>
            </italic> follows an arithmetic Brownian motion (ABM) with drift and volatility <italic>α<sub>X</sub>
            </italic> and <italic>σ<sub>X</sub>

            </italic> and/or <italic>σ<sub>X</sub>
            </italic>, and thereby reduce the expectation and/or variance of future reductions in consumption that would otherwise result from the growth of <italic>X<sub>t</sub>
            </italic>. Welfare is measured using a CRRA utility function, discounted at rate <italic>δ</italic>. Thus welfare at time <italic>t</italic> is<disp-formula id="df1">

         <p>What about the environmental stock variable, <italic>X<sub>t</sub>
            </italic>? To put this in the context of a concrete example, I will assume that <italic>X<sub>t</sub>
            </italic> is the anthropomorphic increase in temperature from its current level.<sup>5</sup> The process for <italic>X<sub>t</sub>
            </italic> is<disp-formula id="df2">
               <inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="df2.tif"/>
            </disp-formula>where <italic>dz</italic> is the increment of a Weiner process, and <italic>X</italic>
            <sub>0</sub> = 0. Note that equation (2) is essentially a vehicle for describing the expectation and variance of the temperature change from <italic>t</italic> = 0 to any future point in time <italic>T</italic>. In particular, <inline-formula id="if8">
               <inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="if8.tif"/>

            </inline-formula>.</p>
         <p>The assumption that <italic>X<sub>t</sub>
            </italic> follows an arithmetic Brownian motion is made for analytical convenience. It implies that both <inline-formula id="if10">
               <inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="if10.tif"/>
            </inline-formula> and Var(<italic>X<sub>T</sub>
            </italic>) are unbounded as <italic>T</italic> grows, which one could argue is unrealistic. Of course I could have allowed <italic>X<sub>t</sub>
            </italic> to follow a more general and complex process, for example, a mean-reverting process or a process with reversion to a stochastic trend (which would bound <inline-formula id="if11">
               <inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="if11.tif"/>
            </inline-formula> and Var(<italic>X<sub>T</sub>
            </italic>) for any <italic>T</italic>). However this would greatly complicate matters and preclude an analytical solution of the model, without providing any additional economic insight. Also, I can obtain solutions for an arbitrarily large (but finite) value for <italic>T</italic>, for example, 300 or 400 years.</p>
         <p>The growth rate of consumption is given by a simple linear relationship:<sup>6</sup>
            <disp-formula id="df3">
               <inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="df3.tif"/>
            </disp-formula>where <italic>g</italic>
            <sub>0</sub> is the growth rate absent the stock variable, that is, when <italic>X<sub>t</sub>
            </italic> = 0. Thus <italic>g<sub>t</sub>
            </italic> also follows an ABM:<disp-formula id="df4">
               <inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="df4.tif"/>
            </disp-formula>Once again, I am keeping the model as simple as possible. For example, some environmental shocks (including accumulated nuclear waste, sulfur emissions, and global warming) are likely to affect both the growth rate and the level of consumption, particularly if consumption is measured in quality-adjusted terms. Likewise, we might expect the growth rate <italic>g<sub>t</sub>
            </italic> to be subject to both temporary and permanent shocks, as in the “long-run risk” model of Bansal and Yaron (2004), which has become widely used in the asset-pricing literature. The model could be generalized along these lines, but at the cost of complicating the analysis.</p>
         <p>Equation (3) implies that at any time <italic>s</italic>,<disp-formula id="df5">
               <inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="df5.tif"/>

            <p>Suppose that with some expenditure over time, society could reduce <italic>α<sub>X</sub>

            <p>While designing a policy that reduces <italic>α<sub>X</sub>
               </italic> might seem straightforward, how as a practical matter could a policy be designed to reduce <italic>σ<sub>X</sub>
               </italic>, that is, to reduce the variance of the stock variable <italic>T</italic> years from now? Investment in research is the most obvious example. As I discuss later in the context of climate change, research might provide better estimates of the rate of temperature increase and better estimates of the impact of higher temperatures. Likewise, research in marine biology and population ecology could reduce uncertainty over the future damages to fisheries from increasing levels of acidity in lakes and oceans. Investments in adaptation could also reduce uncertainty over future damages from environmental degradation. A (perhaps extreme) example is the development of geoengineering technologies that could limit or even reverse temperature increases.<sup>7</sup>

            <p>WTP is society’s reservation price for achieving the policy objective <inline-formula id="if22">

               </inline-formula>, but it is a reservation price for a particular type of policy and a particular form of pricing: at time <italic>t</italic> = 0 the policy is adopted (with no option to wait for more information), and the drift and volatility of <italic>X<sub>t</sub>
               </italic> are immediately changed to their new values. The payment flow starts at <italic>t</italic> = 0 and continues forever, that is, takes the form of a permanent reduction of consumption of <italic>w</italic> percent (yielding a permanent flow of revenue to pay for the policy objective). This is probably unrealistic. First, we would expect that changing <italic>α<sub>X</sub>
               </italic> and/or <italic>σ<sub>X</sub>
               </italic> would take time. Second, there is little reason for the flow cost of the policy to be a fixed percentage of GDP or consumption. Thus WTP might instead be defined as the willingness to give up a particular time-varying percentage of consumption in return for a gradual shift in <italic>α<sub>X</sub>

               </italic> and <italic>σ<sub>0</sub>
               </italic>, respectively. If we specify a target drift and volatility, <italic>α′</italic> and <italic>σ′</italic>, we can calculate the WTP for a policy to achieve this target. Suppose that WTP is <inline-formula id="if45">
                  <inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="if45.tif"/>
               </inline-formula>. We are interested, however, in the trade-off between drift reduction and variance reduction as targets of policy. That is, we want to know what combinations of drift reduction and variance reduction will yield the same <inline-formula id="if46">

               </italic> and <italic>σ<sub>0</sub>
               </italic>. We can compute the locus of such combinations and thereby obtain an “iso-WTP curve,” that is, combinations of <italic>α</italic> and <italic>σ</italic> which, starting at <italic>α<sub>0</sub>
               </italic> and <italic>σ<sub>0</sub>
               </italic>, all have the same WTP and thus are welfare equivalent.</p>
            <p>A hypothetical iso-WTP curve is illustrated in figure 1. Point <italic>A</italic> is the starting drift and volatility, and points <italic>B</italic> and <italic>C</italic> are two targets, both of which have the same WTP of <inline-formula id="if53">

Note that <italic>α</italic> increases as we move down the vertical axis, so the curve represents a social indifference curve between expected return (a lower value of <italic>α</italic>) and risk (a higher value of <italic>σ</italic>). It is thus analogous to the return-risk indifference curve of an investor choosing a portfolio of equities and a risk-free asset. The figure also shows another iso-WTP curve, labeled WTP = .05. It traces out combinations of <italic>α</italic> and <italic>σ</italic> that are lower and thus harder to attain. Moving from <italic>α<sub>0</sub>

            <p>If we knew the costs of reducing <italic>α</italic> and <italic>σ</italic>, we could plot an iso-cost line. If those costs were linear in the change in <italic>α</italic> and the change in <italic>σ</italic>, the iso-cost line would be a straight line, as drawn in figure 1. Its tangency with the iso-WTP curve <inline-formula id="if65">

               </inline-formula> at point <italic>B</italic> is the cost-minimizing target combination of <italic>α</italic> and <italic>σ</italic>. There are other target combinations of <italic>α</italic> and <italic>σ</italic> that have a WTP of .03, but they would be more costly to achieve. Thus, point <italic>B</italic> represents the optimal risk-return policy target consistent with a WTP of .03.</p>
            <p>Environmental policy design is usually (always?) based on expected benefits and costs. But figure 1 shows that a “mean-only” policy target is inefficient. An optimal policy target is likely to include a reduction in risk as well as a reduction in expected damages.</p>
            <p>In figure 1, moving from point <italic>A</italic> to point <italic>B</italic> has the same WTP = .03 as moving from point <italic>A</italic> to point <italic>C</italic>. We can also calculate the combination of starting values for <italic>α<sub>0</sub>

               </italic> that yield the same WTP = .03 when moving to point <italic>B</italic>. In the case of global warming, for example, doing so is useful because it allows us to determine combinations of temperature drift and volatility under BAU that have the same welfare implications. In other words, how important is the expected change in temperature (under BAU) relative to its variance as determinants of the demand for policy? This is essentially what I did in Pindyck (2012b), that is, I focused on combinations of starting values for <italic>α</italic> and <italic>σ</italic> rather than target values.</p>
            <p>This is illustrated in figure 2, which shows two iso-WTP curves. Curve 1 gives combinations of starting values <italic>α<sub>0</sub>

               </inline-formula>, as well as combinations of <italic>α</italic> and <italic>σ</italic> targets that have the same WTP. It is also useful to know the cost of moving from <inline-formula id="if102">

            <p>Given the costs of changing <italic>α</italic> and <italic>σ</italic>, one can plot an iso-cost line, which would be a straight line (as in fig. 1) if the costs were linear in the changes in <italic>α</italic> and <italic>σ</italic>.

         <title>Illustrative Example: Climate Change</title>
         <p>To show how this framework could be applied to policy design, I determine values of the parameters that are roughly consistent with recent studies of global warming and its impact. I then calculate iso-WTP curves and discuss their implications. The model, of course, is extremely simple, so this exercise should be viewed as no more than an illustrative example. In fact, I have argued elsewhere—see Pindyck (2013a)—that integrated assessment models (IAMs) are of little or no value as tools for policy analysis, and the model used here is too simple to even be considered a “stripped-down” version of an IAM. The model is intended to illustrate the basic concepts presented in this paper and not to evaluate any specific policy. However, this exercise does show that a “mean-only” policy target is likely to be inefficient.</p>

               <p>The 2007 IPCC report states that growing GHG emissions (i.e., under BAU) would likely lead to a doubling of the atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>-eq concentration relative to the preindustrial level by mid-century, which would “most likely” cause an increase in global mean temperature between 2.0°C and 4.5°C by 2100, with an expected value of 2.5°C to 3.0°C. The IPCC indicates that this range, derived from the results of 22 scientific studies it surveyed, represents a roughly 66%–90% confidence interval, that is, there is a 5%–17% probability of a temperature increase above 4.5°C. The IPCC’s summary of the 22 studies also suggests that there is a 5% probability that a doubling of the CO<sub>2</sub>-eq concentration would lead to a temperature increase of 7°C or more. For a 100-year horizon, I will use <inline-formula id="if125">
                     <inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="if125.tif"/>
                  </inline-formula> and a 5% probability of a temperature increase ≥7°C. The 5% point is 1.65 standard deviations above the mean (because eq. [2] implies that <italic>X<sub>t</sub>
                  </italic> is normally distributed), so one standard deviation is 4/1.65 = 2.42. Thus the drift and volatility of the process for temperature are <inline-formula id="if126">

                  </italic> = .04, and <italic>σ<sub>X</sub>

                     <inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="df22.tif"/>

               <p>This is an indirect estimate of <italic>γ</italic> and relies on models surveyed by the IPCC that largely posit, rather than estimate, a relationship between temperature and GDP. An alternative is to obtain <italic>γ</italic> from direct econometric estimates. Recent estimates include those of Dell, Jones, and Olken (2009, 2012) and Bansal and Ochoa (2011, 2012). The latter estimates are based on a more extensive data set (147 countries over 1950–2007) and allow for dynamic adjustment of GDP to changes in temperature. Bansal and Ochoa find that a 0.2°C increase in temperature leads to about a 0.2 percentage point reduction in the growth of real GDP. However, this impact number is transitory; GDP growth largely recovers after 10 years. In my model, the impact is permanent, so the Bansal-Ochoa number would imply a value of <italic>γ</italic> in equation (3) of around .001. This is four times as large as the value obtained from the IPCC, so I will use a value in the middle, namely, <italic>γ</italic> = .0005.</p>
               <p>Thus we have <italic>α<sub>X</sub>

                  </italic> = .242, and <italic>γ</italic> = .0005, so that <italic>α</italic> = <italic>α<sub>X</sub>γ</italic> = .000015 and <italic>σ</italic> = <italic>σ<sub>X</sub>γ</italic> = .00012.

                  <sub>2</sub>, so coming up with numbers requires extrapolation of the few cost studies that exist, along with some guesswork. I start with the Kyoto Protocol, designed to limit any increase in global mean temperature by the end of the century to roughly 3°C. The US Energy Information Administration (1998) estimated that compliance with the protocol would cost from 1%–3% of GDP annually. Estimates from country cost studies in IPCC (2007a, 2007b, 2007c) also put the cost of limiting the increase in temperature to 3°C at around 1%–3% of GDP. I take the mid-range of 2% of GDP and translate “limiting the increase in temperature to 3°C” to mean reducing the expected temperature increase from 3°C to 1.5°C with a standard error of about 1.5°C. This means cutting the drift <italic>α</italic> in half, that is, from .000015 to .0000075, so that <italic>c</italic>

These expenditures could arguably reduce uncertainty over future temperature change; they exclude public R&amp;D spending on renewable energy, new technologies, and electricity and fossil fuel production as well as (the very limited) R&amp;D spending directed at adaptation to climate change.<sup>11</sup> I will assume that a doubling of the annual $5 billion in expenditures to $10 billion could result in a halving of <italic>σ</italic>

            <p>The iso-WTP curves in figure 3 show the most society would pay (in terms of percentage of consumption sacrificed) to move from a starting point <inline-formula id="if187">

               </inline-formula> to an ending point on the curve. But they do not tell us anything about the cost of that movement. If the cost exceeds the WTP, the policy is economically infeasible; if the cost is less than the WTP, the policy has a positive social surplus. In addition, since all points on an iso-WTP curve are welfare equivalent, we might want to know which target point has the least cost. To address this I use the iso-cost lines implied by equation (18), with the calibrated values for <italic>c</italic>
               <sub>1</sub> and <italic>c</italic>
               <sub>2</sub>, that is,<disp-formula id="df24">

            <p>Figure 5 shows an iso-WTP curve that plots combinations of target values of <italic>α</italic> and <italic>σ</italic> that have a WTP of .02, given the starting point <inline-formula id="if190">

               </inline-formula>, which is shown as a small circle. Also shown is an iso-cost line that is tangent to the iso-WTP curve, that is, at the point where the slope of the iso-WTP curve is −<italic>c</italic>
               <sub>2</sub>/<italic>c</italic>
               <sub>1</sub>. (Remember that <italic>α</italic> is decreasing as we move up the vertical axis.) Thus, for this target, <inline-formula id="if192">
                  <inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="if192.tif"/>
               </inline-formula>, the cost of reaching the iso-WTP curve is minimized. In this example, that cost turns out to be about .020, that is, the same as the WTP. Thus the policy illustrated by figure 5 is just feasible; society would be paying its reservation price for the policy, so the social surplus would be zero. On the other hand, if we were to double <italic>c</italic>
               <sub>1</sub> and <italic>c</italic>
               <sub>2</sub>, the cost would double, making the policy economically infeasible. And if we were to halve <italic>c</italic>
               <sub>1</sub> and <italic>c</italic>
               <sub>2</sub>, the cost would drop to .010, so that the policy would have a social surplus of .02 − .01 = 1% of GDP.<fig id="fg5" position="float" fig-type="figure">

            <p>Given equation (19), the cost of any policy is a simple function of the changes in <italic>α</italic> and <italic>σ</italic>. But the WTP for changes in <italic>α</italic> and <italic>σ</italic> depends not only on the magnitudes of the changes but also on the parameters <italic>η</italic>, <italic>δ</italic>, and <italic>g</italic>
               <sub>0</sub>. For any given shift in <italic>α</italic> and <italic>σ</italic>, for example, a reduction in <italic>η</italic> will increase the WTP.<sup>12</sup> Equivalently, a lower value of <italic>η</italic> implies that for any fixed WTP, the required changes in <italic>α</italic> and <italic>σ</italic> will be smaller. This is illustrated by figure 6, which is the same as figure 5 except that <italic>η</italic> = 1.5 instead of 2. If <italic>η</italic> = 1.5 it takes much smaller reductions in <italic>α</italic> and <italic>σ</italic> to have a WTP of .02, and thus the cost of the policy is much smaller (.008 versus .020). In this case the policy has a positive social surplus.<fig id="fg6" position="float" fig-type="figure">

The first row shows the base case corresponding to figure 5, and the second row corresponds to figure 6 (with <italic>η</italic> reduced to 1.5 but the WTP fixed at .02). Increasing <italic>η</italic> to 3 implies that for any fixed target <inline-formula id="if211">

               </inline-formula>, the WTP will fall, so that obtaining a WTP of .02 requires a much larger shift in <inline-formula id="if212">

               </inline-formula> and thus a much higher cost (in this case .091, making the social surplus negative). As the fourth row shows, with <italic>η</italic> = 3 we can still obtain a positive social surplus, but only if the target <inline-formula id="if214">

               <sub>0</sub> has the same effect as reducing <italic>η</italic> (the initial deterministic consumption discount rate is <inline-formula id="if216">
                  <inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="if216.tif"/>
               </inline-formula>), so the target <inline-formula id="if217">

               </inline-formula> and the cost falls. Increasing <italic>δ</italic> has the same directional effect as increasing <italic>η</italic>, so with WTP fixed at .02, the cost increases. Finally, in the last row of the table, <italic>c</italic>
               <sub>2</sub>, the cost of reducing <italic>σ</italic> is doubled. This increases the total cost (but not by much), and causes the target <inline-formula id="if222">

            <title>Policy Design</title>
            <p>Taking this model at face value, we can infer the optimal mix of risk and return as policy targets. We can also determine if any pair of policy targets (whether or not an optimal mix) yields a positive social surplus, that is, costs less than the WTP. Finally, we can determine alternative target combinations that have the same WTP. In figure 5, for example, the iso-WTP curve corresponds to a WTP of .02, and given the starting point, the optimal target mix cuts both <italic>α</italic> and <italic>σ</italic> roughly in half. The cost of reaching this target is .02 as well, so the policy is just feasible. We could have instead chosen an alternative target mix that also has a WTP of .02 (i.e., a different point on the iso-WTP curve), but its cost would exceed .02.</p>
            <p>As figure 6 and table 1 show, the social surplus for any policy depends not only on the iso-WTP curve and cost parameters <italic>c</italic>
               <sub>1</sub> and <italic>c</italic>
               <sub>2</sub>, but also on <italic>δ</italic>, <italic>η</italic>, and <italic>g</italic>
               <sub>0</sub>. As discussed in Pindyck (2013a, 2013b), the dependence on <italic>δ</italic> and <italic>η</italic> has been a problem for climate policy. What are the “correct” values that should be used for policy evaluation? Economists disagree. The answer depends in part on whether these are behavioral parameters (i.e., reflecting the behavior of consumers, investors, and firms) or policy parameters (i.e., reflecting the objectives of policy makers). Either way, we have a wide range of reasonable values and thus a wide range of WTP estimates for any target mix. As a comparison of figures 5 and 6 show, a value of <italic>η</italic> of 1.5 versus 2.0 yields very different WTPs for any set of targets (or, as in the figures, very different targets for a fixed WTP). The approach to policy design outlined in this paper does not get around this problem. Instead it is best understood as a way of clarifying policy target trade-offs (risk versus return) conditional on values for <italic>η</italic>, and so forth.</p>

         <title>Concluding Remarks</title>
         <p>I have presented a simple framework by which one can estimate the extent to which the objective of policy should be a reduction in the expected future damages versus a reduction in the uncertainty over those damages. The framework is based on the computation of “iso-WTP curves” (social indifference curves) for combinations of risk and expected returns as policy objectives. Given cost estimates for reducing risk and increasing expected returns, one can compute the optimal risk-return policy mix and evaluate the policy’s social surplus.</p>
         <p>To illustrate this framework, I used a simple Brownian motion process for the stock variable and a CRRA utility function. This has the advantage of yielding simple expressions for expected future consumption and utility. However, the framework can be applied to alternative stochastic processes for the stock variable and alternative social preferences, although this will introduce additional complexity and numerical methods may be needed to obtain results. Likewise, one might use a more general consumption-based Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) framework in which the discount rate depends on the correlation of benefits (from reducing <italic>α</italic> and/or <italic>σ</italic>) with consumption.</p>
         <p>For my example of climate change, there is a consensus on the expected rate of temperature increase under BAU—about 3°C. There is considerable disagreement, however, over the nature and extent of uncertainty around that expected value. That disagreement relates to the choice of probability distribution that best applies to future temperatures (e.g., whether it is fat- or thin-tailed), and to the parameterization of any particular distribution.<sup>13</sup> I have used a simple (thin-tailed) normal distribution to describe temperature change, but one can incorporate alternative distributions (using alternative stochastic processes for <italic>X<sub>t</sub>
            </italic>). Thus, this framework can be used to study the implications of alternative characterizations of uncertainty for determining the targets of policy.</p>
         <p>It is an understatement to say that caveats are needed. First, costs of reducing <italic>α</italic> and <italic>σ</italic> are probably convex, not linear as in equation (18). But a linear cost function may be a reasonable first approximation, and in any case our ability to estimate these costs is limited. More troublesome is the assumption that whatever the cost, we can change <italic>α</italic> and <italic>σ</italic> instantly. One would expect that shifts in <italic>α</italic> and <italic>σ</italic> would occur gradually in response to ongoing expenditures on abatement and R&amp;D. Also, I calculated WTP under the restriction that the flows of costs are constant percentages of GDP. In fact, those costs might fall as a result of technological change making it cheaper to limit GHG emissions. And even if the costs do not fall, WTP might be calculated under the alternative assumption that costs increase or decrease over time as the policy becomes more or less stringent. The model can be modified to allow for gradual changes in <italic>α</italic> and <italic>σ</italic> and/or costs that are time varying (although both changes would be at the cost of complicating the numerical solution of the model).</p>
         <p>Even maintaining the simple assumptions used here (in which the changes in <italic>α</italic> and <italic>σ</italic> occur instantly and the flow cost is a constant percentage of GDP), the framework can be extended in a number of directions. For example, the timing of policy implementation can be made endogenous. Suppose a policy is imposed only when temperature reaches a critical threshold (e.g., 3°C). Given a cost for the policy, we could then determine the temperature threshold that maximizes net welfare.</p>
         <p>It is important to emphasize what this paper is not. It is not an analysis or evaluation of climate change policy along the lines of the US Interagency Working Group (2010, 2013), which tried to estimate the social cost of carbon (SCC). That study was based on the use of three integrated assessment models that are far more detailed and complex than the extremely simple model I presented here. Likewise, this paper tells us nothing about catastrophic risk, which I have argued elsewhere (Pindyck 2013a, 2013b) is the key to formulating climate change policy. On the other hand, this paper has shown that the SCC has two components that in principle could be decomposed—a component due to expected damages from an additional unit of carbon emissions and a component due to the increased uncertainty over damages that stems from an additional unit of carbon.</p>
