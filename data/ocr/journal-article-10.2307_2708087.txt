<plain_text><page sequence="1">SCEPTICS IN CICERO AND HUME BY JOHN VALDIMrR PRICE The attention lately focused on David Hume's Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion (1779) may well be what the author envisioned when he made certain, on his deathbed, that it would be published posthumously. If so, he should be satisfied with its successful reprints and the number of scholarly and critical articles devoted to it. Part of the fascination of the Dialogues lies in its three main characters: Philo, the sceptic; Cleanthes, the empirical theologian; and Demea, the orthodox believer. Since Philo is most closely identified with Hume, and since he is the most loquacious of of the speakers, it is no wonder that we are curious about his ideological origins. Many scholars, including Ernest Campbell Mossner,l Norman Kemp Smith,2 and Preserved Smith,3 agree, for different reasons, that Philo is Hume, and that his ideological genealogy is similar to Hume's. Cleanthes is thought to represent generally, on one hand, the scientific theism of Bishop Butler 4 and, on the other hand, the scientific theism of some of Newton's disciples, Colin Maclaurin and Dr. George Cheyne.5 Aside from the obvious similarity between Hume and Philo, we may inquire if Philo had any defi- nite literary or historical model. Hume, like most educated men of his day, enjoyed a classical education and knew the classical authors as schoolboys today know baseball and foot- ball players. Hence, we should not be surprised to learn that certain classi- cal authors had influenced his thinking and writing. In his published works and letters, he consistently alludes to classical authors, often quoting them- for the most part accurately-from memory. Not much study has been made of Hume's use of the ancients, although a helpful book could be written on the subject.6 Knowing Hume's familiarity with classical authors and his admiration for them, we might suspect that Philo's intellectual genealogy is eclectic, especially when we consider the diversity of arguments he puts forth. Instead of looking just inside Hume's philosophy to identify Philo, we could study outside influences on Hume's thinking. One of the ancients Hume greatly admired was Cicero, and the impact of Cicero's De Natura Deorum (45 B.C.) 7 upon the composition of Hume's Dialogues is apparent ' E. C.

They are only partial evidence of Hume's knowledge of classical authors.

PRICE in the similarity of the structure of the two works, as Norman Kemp Smith has suggested in his edition of the Dialogues. Hume specifically had his mind on De Natura Deorum when he was writing the conclusion of his Dia- logues, as a comparison of the separate conclusions will prove. Cicero, speak- ing in the first person, ends his work in this manner: "Here the conversation ended, and we parted, Velleius thinking Cotta's discourse to be the truer, while I felt that that of Balbus approximated more nearly to a semblance of the truth." 8 Taking into account the inherent differences between Latin and English, Hume's ending, with the youth Pamphilus, is almost identical: "Cleanthes and Philo pursued not this conversation much farther; and as nothing ever made greater impression on me, than all the reasonings of that day; so I confess, that, upon a serious review of the whole, I cannot but think, that Philo's principles are more probable than Demea's; but that those of Cleanthes approach still nearer to the truth." 9 It is this structural similarity which first engages our attention and leads us to additional in- quiry about the relationship between Hume and Cicero. In Hume's published writings, definite references to De Natura Deorum are unmistakeable, as in his essay, "Of the Rise and Progress of the Arts and Sciences," where Cicero is mentioned as a great genius and religious sceptic who introduces some of his friends disputing the nature of the gods and, as always, writes Hume, "has something decisive to say on the sub- ject." The reference to De Natura Deorum is obvious, for it is the one "dia- logue" of Cicero opening in the first person and relating an occasion when the topic of the "immortal gods" was under discussion among Gaius Cotta, a sceptic; Quintus Lucius Balbus, a Stoic; and Gaius Velleius, an Epi- curean. Other allusions to De Natura Deorum appear in Hume's published writings, and in his long essay, "The Natural History of Religion," one will find, at the close of Section XII, an extended reference to Cotta's ridicule of mythology in religion. To enumerate other references to De Natura Deo- rum in Hume's writings would be time-consuming, when our specific concern is to explore some of the parallels between Hume's sceptic, Philo, and Cicero's sceptic, Cotta. Although there are parallels between Cleanthes and Balbus, this paper will be limited to those between Philo and Cotta. The very choosing of the name "Philo" in Hume's Dialogues tells us something about his use of Cicero. In antiquity, Philo was the founder of the New Academy and a teacher of both Cicero and Cotta; from him they learned, as Velleius says, "to know nothing" (DND, 21; I., vii). Cotta's sceptical credentials, then, are a result of his study with the founder of the New Academy, Philo. Hume's choice of that name for his protagonist, along with some other formal similarities between Hume's work and Cicero's, is probably intended to correspond to the Philo of whom Cicero speaks. Both are sceptics, but Hume found much more in Cicero's Cotta than the source for a name for his protagonist. Some direct mentions of De Natura Deorum appear in the Dialogues, but they are not numerous. Philo never quotes Cotta directly, but he does quote Velleius, the Epicurean, giving Cicero as his source in a footnote: 8 Cicero, De Natura Deorum, tr. by H. Rackham (Cambridge, Mass., 1956), 383; III, xl.

They reply that it does not. That Hume would not quote Cotta directly is understandable, since that would make Philo nothing but a mouthpiece for Cotta. By using Vel- leius' words, Hume is able to criticize the cosmologies of the Platonists and Stoics in a manner that would have been acceptable to Cotta. But the scep- tical principles of Cicero and Cotta were very much on the mind of the author of the Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion. The only other extensive allusion to Cicero in Hume's composition ap- pears in Part II; one of Cotta's arguments is singled out to be used as an example (Dialogues, 149'; cf. DND, 59; I, xxii). Philo there relates the story of Simonides who had been asked by Hiero the question "What is the Being and Nature of God?" Simonides replied to this admittedly difficult question by postponing an answer indefinitely. Following Cotta's example, Phila asks Cleanthes whether he is to blame if the subject is too complex for complete solution by the mentality of man. But if the solution is complex beyond resolution, both Cotta and Philo do not, apparently, doubt the existence of a deity or deities. Cotta piously intones that "almost all men, and I myself no less than any other, believe that the gods exist, and this I do not chal- lenge" (DND, 61; I, xxii). As his ancestor was, so is Philo equally pious about the existence of God: "Where reasonable men treat these subjects, the question can never be concerning the being, but only the nature of the Deity. The former truth, as you well observe, is unquestionable and self- evident" (Dialogues, 142). Since both Cotta and Philo direct damaging criti- cism against various arguments for the existence of God, the pious profes- sions are ironic. Cotta, for example, first suggests that it is quite proper in a discussion of the nature of the gods to question their existence; after affirming that he does believe the gods exist (as in the above quotation), he immediately adds this important qualification: "At the same time I doubt the adequacy of the arguments which you adduce to prove it [i.e., the exist- ence of the gods]." Similarly, Philo's qualification of his acceptance of God's existence is a subtle attack on the argument from design; in his discourse, it appears two sentences later in this form: "But as all perfection is entirely relative, we ought never to imagine, that we comprehend the attributes of this divine Being, or to suppose, that his perfections have any analogy or likeness to the perfections of a human creature." Cotta admits his belief after Velleius' exposition of the Epicurean sys- tem and of the Epicurean's reasons for belief in the existence of the gods. Cotta does not think Velleius' reasons adequate and launches into a lengthy, 10Dialogues, 165-166: "For with what eyes of the mind could your Plato have beheld that workshop of such stupendous toil, in which he represents the world as having been put together and built by God? How was so vast an undertaking set about? What tools, what levers, what machines, what servants, were employed in so great a work? How came air, fire, water, and earth to obey and submit to the architect's will?" Quotations from the Dialogues will hereafter be cited in the text.</page><page sequence="4">100 JOHN V. PRICE critical analysis of them, leaving those reasons pretty much in pieces when he finishes. Philo implies that the arguments of the sceptic against true re- ligion cannot damage it, because it is stronger than the cavils of scepticism. Instead, Philo contends, it is important that the arguments used in support of the being and nature of God be consistent and logical. His subsequent dismantling of the arguments advanced by scientific theism and the argu- ment from design leaves little doubt as to his opinion of their validity. Since the existence of God is the central concern in both dialogues, it is not surprising that the anthropomorphic argument appears in both, only to be pulled apart. The rejection by Philo and Cotta of the anthropomorphic argument constitutes one of the most cohesive similarities between them. Cotta spends some time in speculation about the evidence that might be used to support an anthropomorphic conception of the Deity: On this topic [i.e., the nature of the gods] you are at no loss for arguments designed to prove that the gods have the form of men: first because our minds possess a preconceived notion of such a character that, when a man thinks of god, it is the human form that presents itself to him; secondly, because inasmuch as the divine nature surpasses all other things, the divine form must needs be the most beautiful, and no form is more beautiful than that of man. The third reason you advance is that no other shape is capable of being the abode of intelligence. . . . These notions moreover have been fostered by poets, painters and artificers, who found it difficult to represent living and active deities in the likeness of any other shape than that of man. ... Can we imagine any gods, I do not say as cross-eyed as Roscius, but with a slight cast? Can we picture any of them with a mole, a snub nose, protruding ears, prominent brows and too large a head-defects not un- known among us men-, or are they entirely free from personal blemishes? Suppose that we grant you that, are we also to say that they are all exactly alike? If not, there will be a degree of beauty among them, and therefore a god can fall short of supreme beauty. (DND, 73-79; I, xxvii-xxix) Cleanthes is also guilty in Hume's Dialogues of using the anthropomorphic argument and Philo several times chastises him for submitting to such a piece of illogic: But as all perfection is entirely relative, we ought never to imagine, that we comprehend the attributes of this divine Being, or to suppose, that his per- fections have any analogy or likeness to the perfections of a human crea- ture. . . . But farther, Cleanthes; men are mortal, and renew their species by generation; and this is common to all living creatures. The two great sexes of male and female, says Milton, animate the world. Why must this circumstance, so universal, so essential, be excluded from those numerous and limited Deities? Behold then the theogony of ancient times brought back upon us. And why not become a perfect anthropomorphite? Why not assert the Deity or Deities to be corporeal, and to have eyes, a nose, mouth, ears, &amp;c.? Epicurus maintained, that no man had ever seen reason but in a human figure; therefore the gods must have a human figure. And this argument, which is deservedly so much ridiculed by Cicero, becomes, according to you, solid and philosophical. (Dialogues, 142, 168) Philo's reference in the last part of the quotation to Cicero is most likely to De Natura Deorum, where the ridicule of the anthropomorphic argument</page><page sequence="5">SCEPTICS IN CICERO AND HUME 101 for the existence of God (or gods) is thoroughly effective. The analogy be- tween the two arguments-one from Cicero, the other from Hume-the similarity of the language even through a translation, and the direct allusion to Cicero make it improbable that Hume had anything else in mind but Cotta's arguments. Both Cotta and Philo argue the same point: that we form our conception of God, probably erroneously, from our subjective ex- perience, refining all the discrete impressions that make up a homo sapiens into their most perfect state, expecting that God will fit logically and natu- rally into this conception. Hume maintains that we hypostatize in the light of experience, that our experience is quite limited, and that we can there- fore never expect any of the qualities we find in men in our world to be refined to the greatest possible degree; that is, it is always possible to im- agine a greater degree of refinement of some particular quality than any degree of refinement we know. Although Cotta expends a great deal of effort in discrediting anthropo- morphism, he makes only one slight attack on the existence of the gods themselves; he contends that the anthropomorphic argument is illogical and consequently improbable. If that is not enough of an insult to the Epicurean Yelleius, he adds that the concept of anthropomorphism is not seriously held by Epicurus himself and that it is only false reasoning (i.e., reasoning which proceeds without the aid of logic) that leads to espousal of such a doctrine of anthropomorphism. Philo, too, speaking for Hume, would con- tend that false reasoning (or reasoning which infers a causal connection between two events when the connection is actually inferred by one's own mind) leads man to absurd observations about the nature and existence of God. Since Philo continually insists upon the logical fallacy of the argument from design, he might have taken his cue from this remark of Cotta: "And what of god himself? You have never seen him have you? Why then do you believe in his existence? On this principle we must sweep aside every- thing unusual of which history or science informs us. The next thing would be for inland races to refuse to believe in the existence of the sea" (DND, 85-87; I, xxi). Cotta continues by saying that if we had never met a certain type of animal in our experience, we would be apt to think a person crazy if he told us the animal existed. That suggestion verges on something Hume was to make explicit 1800 years later: But can you think, Cleanthes, that your usual phlegm and philosophy have been preserved in so wide a step as you have taken, when you compared to the universe houses, ships, furniture, machines; and from their similarity in some circumstances inferred a similarity in their causes? Thought, design, and intelligence, such as we discover in men and other animals, is no more than one of the springs and principles of the universe, as well as heat or cold, attraction or repulsion, and a hundred others, which fall daily under observation. It is an active cause, by which some particular parts of nature, we find, produce alterations on other parts. But can a conclusion, with any propriety, be transferred from parts to the whole? Does not the great dis- proportion bar all comparison and inference? From observing the growth of a hair, can we learn any thing concerning the generation of a man? Would the manner of a leaf's blowing, even though perfectly known, afford us any instruction concerning the vegetation of a tree? (Dialogues, 147) The form of the argument is, of course, different in each writer. But Philo's</page><page sequence="6">102 JOHN V. PRICE argument is the logical extension of Cotta's suggestion. Cotta suggests that evidence to prove the existence of a Deity is possibly available, and that we would not assert the non-existence of the Deity simply because we had not seen him no more than we would reject the existence of an elephant simply because we had not seen one. But Cotta's implication is that the sort of inference which leads us to conclude that an animal called "elephant" does in fact exist is not of the same type of inference that leads us to conclude, for vastly different reasons, that God exists. Philo has developed this view even further. It is fatuous, he argues, to generalize from our limited human experience to some definite, usually super-human, conclusion about a deity; we fail to take into account our lack of experience with divine obj ects. Nonetheless we should not commit the error in the other direction by main- taining that something does not exist simply because we have never met with it in our previous experience. We have been discussing the implications of Cotta's speeches, but we have probably inferred a meaning from those words that Cicero was not aware of or did not intend. This was done in order to show how Hume might possibly have developed in his Dialogues the ideas he found in Cicero. When we found in the Dialogues some definite allusions to and uses of De Natura Deorum, we were justified in looking for others and seeing what possible use Hume might have made of Cicero's sceptic in creating his own sceptic. In literature, when we see an analogy between Shakespeare's Julius Caesar and Sir Thomas North's Plutarch, we are encouraged to look for more. Even if the differences between Julius Caesar and Plutarch are great, we can still accept the latter as the source for the former. On this ground we can justify seeking other analogies between Cicero's Cotta and Hume's Philo; having found definite corollaries to begin with and knowing Hume's lifelong admi- ration for Cicero, we can ascertain the extent to which Cicero was present in Hume's mind during the composition of the Dialogues. The following argument of Philo may have as its seed some of the argu- ments of Cotta: But let us beware, lest we think, that our ideas any wise correspond to his perfections, or that his attributes have any resemblance to these qualities among men. He is infinitely superior to our limited view and comprehen- sion; and is more the object of worship in the temple, than of disputation in the schools. In reality, Cleanthes, continued he, there is no need of having recourse to that affected scepticism, so displeasing to you, in order to come at this determination. Our ideas reach no farther than our experience: We have no experience of divine attributes and operations: I need not conclude my syllogism: You can draw the inference yourself. (Dialogues, 142-143) Philo is not going to stray beyond the confines of experience in order to construct, a priori, some idea of divinity. Because we have no experience of divinity, he argues, it is impossible for us to gauge the extension of any divine attributes. Philo's compact argument is the probable development of some questions that Cotta addresses to Yelleius: About your deity therefore I want to know, first, where he dwells; secondly, what motive he has for moving in space, that is, if he ever does so move; thirdly, it being a special characteristic of animate beings to desire some</page><page sequence="7">SCEPTICS IN CICERO AND HUME 103 end that is appropriate to their nature, what is the thing that god desires; fourthly, upon what subject does he employ his mental activity and reason; and lastly, how is he happy, and how eternal. For whichever of these ques- tions you raise, you touch a tender spot. An argument based on such in- secure premisses can come to no valid conclusion. Your assertion was that the form of god is perceived by thought and not by the senses, that it has no solidity nor numerical persistence, and that our perception of it is such that it is seen owing to similarity and succession, a never-ceasing stream of similar forms arriving continually from the infinite number of atoms, and that thus it results that our mind, when its attention is fixed upon these forms, conceives the divine nature to be happy and eternal. Now in the name of the very gods about whom we are talking, what can possibly be the meaning of this? If the gods only appeal to the faculty of thought, and have no solidity or definite outline, what difference does it make whether we think of a god or of a hippocentaur? Such mental pictures are called by all other philosophers mere empty imaginations, but you say they are the arrival and entrance into our minds of certain images. (DND, 101-103; I, xxxvii-xxxviii) We would not argue that Hume's reading of this passage resulted in a philo- sophical catharsis that led him to write Philo's part in the Dialogues, but the passage does bear a marked similarity to Philo's arguments about God. Philo criticizes the tacit assumption of the empirical theologian Cleanthes that the Deity has experiences like those of humans and that consequently the universe reveals the design of a supreme mind in its organization and complexity. Quite obviously, from the same evidence, we could just as easily argue that we have experiences like the Deity and that consequently the universe reveals the design of our minds in its organization and complexity. Since Cleanthes and Philo have agreed that all knowledge must come from experience or from reasoning in the light of experience, Philo must remind him that our limited experience as human beings should not lead us to sup- pose that God has experiences of the same sort human beings do. It is fal- lacious, he argues, to think that because the universe bears some remote analogy to human experience, there must necessarily be some Supreme Being whose perfect mind is similar to the human mind. Cotta, in Cicero's dia- logue, also implies that it is futile to suppose that God's mind operates in a way similar to ours, and that the only reason we may suppose that He bears some analogy to human likenesses is that we can think only in terms of human experiences. In other words, it is presumptuous of humans to suppose that they must resemble God, when they have no experience of God. The impressions we have of the external world (to put Cotta's language into Hume's) are all derived from our experiences with the objects which the impressions represent. If, says Cotta, the being of God is apprehended by pure thought, and this apprehension is a synthetic one produced by the suc- cession of related forms in otur minds, then what would lead us to conclude that God had human form and that He thought and created in patterns similar to those of humans? It seems to me that Philo and Cotta are making essentially the same argument: that is, whether a necessary causal connec- tion can be found between the phenomena of the external world and the perfect mind. Both are asking what justifiable, logical process can possibly be used to infer a god or supremely creating mind from our impressions of sense-data in the external world. These two successive quotations from Hume and Cicero do not neces- sarily mean that Hume was simply re-writing Cotta's arguments for Philo.</page><page sequence="8">104 JOHN V. PRICE He naturally took something away from them, but he added much more, using Cotta as his theme but making the variations more interesting and important than the theme. And there are still other themes from Cotta which Philo uses. In different ways, they both disapprove of attributing human happiness and virtue to divine happiness and virtue. Having ques- tioned whether a benevolent God would create misery in the world, Philo has this to say: I will allow, that pain or misery in man is compatible with infinite power and goodness in the Deity, even in your [Cleanthes'] sense of these attri- butes: What are you advanced by all these concessions? A mere com- patibility is not sufficient. You must prove these pure, unmixed, and uncon- trollable attributes from these alone. A hopeful undertaking! Were the phenomena ever so pure and unmixed, yet being finite, they would be in- sufficient for that purpose. How much more, were they also so jarring and discordant? Here, Cleanthes, I find myself at ease in my argument. Here I triumph. Formerly, when we argued concerning the natural attributes of intelligence and design, I needed all my sceptical and metaphysical subtility to elude your grasp. In many views of the universe, and of its parts, particularly the latter, the beauty and fitness of final causes strike us with such irresistible force, that all objections appear (what I believe they really are) mere cavils and sophisms; nor can we then imagine how it was ever possible for us to repose any weight on them. But there is no view of human life, or of the condition of mankind, from which, without the greatest violence, we can infer the moral attributes, or learn that infinite benevolence, conjoined with infinite power and infinite wisdom, which we must discover by the eyes of faith alone. (Dialogues, 201-202) Cotta too argues that recognized virtues are incompatible with a divine nature, but that a deity without virtue is inconceivable: But what can we make of a god not endowed with any virtue? Well, are we to assign to god prudence, which consists in knowledge of things good, things evil, and things neither good nor evil? to a being who experiences and can experience nothing evil, what need is there of the power to choose between things good and evil? Or of reason, or of intelligence? these facul- ties we employ for the purpose of proceeding from the known to the ob- scure; but nothing can be obscure to god. Then justice, which assigns to each his own-what has this to do with the gods? justice, as you tell us, is the offspring of human society and of the commonwealth of man. And tem- perance consists in foregoing bodily pleasure; so if there is room for tem- perance in heaven, there is also room for pleasure. As for courage, how can god be conceived as brave? in enduring pain? or toil? or danger? to none of these is god liable. God then is neither rational nor possessed of the virtues: but such a god is inconceivable! (DND, 321-323; III, xv) To both sceptics, the irony of evil and chaos in a world supposedly ruled by a benevolent God is almost more than the mind can conceive. If we infer a benevolent God from the mixed and confused phenomena of the world, that would indeed be strange reasoning. Philo's position is partially a develop- ment of Cotta's, for he does admit it is possible to conceive misery in man compatible with infinite goodness in the Deity; but, like his archetype, he cannot validate the logic that jumps from the evidence of one to the conclu- sion of the other.</page><page sequence="9">SCEPTICS IN CICERO AND HUME 105 Sooner or later, in collecting examples of similarities between Cotta and Philo, we would reach the point of diminishing returns. Even all those simi- larities would not prove that Hume had necessarily used Cicero in writing his Dialogues, but they would strongly suggest that he had. While the par- ticular philosophical content of an argument may have changed over the course of 1800 years, the approach by Cicero to a certain argument might have been instructive to Hume. When Cotta accuses Epicurus of insisting on direct experience of anything before we can be satisfied that it exists, he creates a point of agreement between him and his latter-day counterpart: both sceptics believe that reasoning based on experience can lead to knowl- edge, without the necessity of having direct experience of everything in order to prove existence. This sort of reasoning is acceptable to Cotta in determining the existence of other planets, when he asks Velleius, Well, have you ever seen anything like the sun or the moon or the five [sic] planets? The sun, limiting his motion by the two extreme points of one orbit, completes his courses yearly. The moon, lit by the sun's rays, achieves this solar path in the space of a month. The five planets, holding the same orbit, but some nearer to and others farther from the earth, from the same starting-points complete the same distances in different periods of time. Now, Epicurus, have you ever seen anything like this? Well, then, let us deny the existence of the sun, moon, and planets, inasmuch as nothing can exist save that which we have touched or seen. (DND, 85; I, xxxi) Philo updates his reasoning with his knowledge of the Copernican system: Yes! cried Philo, interrupting [Cleanthes], we have other earths. Is not the moon another earth, which we see to turn round its centre? Is not Venus another earth, where we observe the same phenomenon? Are not the revolu- tions of the sun also a confirmation, from analogy, of the same theory? All the planets, are they not earths, which revolve about the sun? Are not the satellites moons, which move round Jupiter and Saturn, and along with these primary planets, round the sun? These analogies and resemblances, with others, which I have not mentioned, are the sole proofs of the Copernican system: And to you it belongs to consider, whether you have any analogies of the same kind to support your theory. (Dialogues, 150) While the factual material on which the arguments are based in the above accounts is different, the method is not. Each of our sceptics contends that the argument from design employs analogical reasoning unlike the analogi- cal reasoning establishing the existence of the sun, moon, and planets. To each, it is especially important that the opposition see the difference between the two forms of analogical reasoning, one valid, the other not. We strongly suspect that Hume "borrowed" this approach to the problems of reasoning by analogy from De Natura Deorurm, bringing it up-to-date with the knowl- edge supplied by Copernicus. At the beginning of this paper, we examined the almost identical endings of De Natura Deorum and the Dialogues. It is perhaps appropriate now to examine again the personal convictions of both sceptics about the immuta- bility of God and their devotion to religion. Addressing Balbus, who had exhorted Cotta to remember that he was both a Cotta and a pontiff, Cotta says, "This no doubt meant that I ought to uphold the beliefs about the immortal gods which have come down to us from our ancestors, and the rites</page><page sequence="10">106 JOHN V. PRICE and ceremonies and duties of religion. For my part I always shall uphold them and always have done so, and no eloquence of anybody, learned or unlearned, shall ever dislodge me from the belief as to the worship of the immortal gods which I have inherited from our forefathers" (DND, 289- 291; III, ii). After his slashing attack upon Epicurean and Stoic philosophy and upon the various teleological arguments adduced to prove the existence of the gods, Cotta now proclaims his piety, devotion, and true belief. As a result of the exuberant, if rhetorical, scepticism on his part, the reader is highly suspicious of his sincerity. In like manner, after Demea's departure in the Dialogues, Cleanthes and Philo begin discussing the feelings and attitudes one "ought" to have to- wards religion; and Philo explains his purpose in discussing natural religion: "You, in particular, Cleanthes, with whom I live in unreserved intimacy; you are sensible, that, notwithstanding the freedom of my conversation, and my love of singular arguments, no one has a deeper sense of religion im- pressed on his mind, or pays more profound adoration to the divine Being, as he discovers himself to reason, in the inexplicable contrivance and arti- fice of nature" (Dialogues, 214). Again, after his devastating attack on the argument from design and his careful qualifications of the sort of divine Being he would adore, it would seem that Philo's statement is ironic. Be that as it may, what we notice is the similarity between Cotta and Philo in their professions of belief. Both, for some reason, feel impelled to assure the pious that they are not destroying the citadel of religion and that they are just as religious as anyone. The approach and the method for handling this ostensible acquiescence to orthodoxy are the same in both Cicero and Hume. Neither makes any essential concessions; Cotta states his "belief" in histori- cal terms, and Philo makes his so subjective that it is as amorphous as ever. I think we can now see the extent to which Hume did model his sceptic, Philo, on Cicero's sceptic, Cotta. The formal similarities of the Dialogues and De Natura Deorum are enough to imply "borrowing" on Hume's part, and the representative quotations we have examined buttress that view. Many other examples-phrases, sentences, or just analogies-are common to Cotta and Philo, although each uses them in a different manner. Cotta is usually bluff, almost dogmatic in his scepticism; his favorite device is the rhetorical question. But he is imaginative, and his continual supply of possi- ble exceptions to the "rules" about divine behavior leaves the opposition breathless. Philo, too, shares this imaginative faculty and is continually posing concrete difficulties against the design argument. He is more skillful in his handling of them, however, and he is calmer in his approach than Cotta. Even so, both are quite satisfactory sceptics, and both successfully subdue the opposition. We should not conclude yet that the exclusive source for Philo's doctrine was Cotta. Whatever similarity there may be between them, the arguments derived from Cotta are wholly transformed by Hume and carefully stamped with his own brand of scepticism. But the structure and the method of his sceptic are almost assuredly animated, as distinct from dictated, by Cicero. It is a measure of Hume's success that he adapts Cotta to his own sceptic without being either imitative or sterile. Philo is a skillful blend of Cice- ronian structure and Humean philosophy.
