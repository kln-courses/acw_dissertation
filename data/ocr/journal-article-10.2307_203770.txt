Political History in the I98os Jacques Julliard Reflections on its Present and Future Political history measures the contribution of voluntary actions in the unfolding of history. Of course, not every voluntary act is polit- ical, but once a collective action takes on a concerted form, the political aspect is there. We have acquired the habit, since Sig- mund Freud, of considering psychic activities as an enormous iceberg, of which the visible, or conscious part, is only a super- ficial layer of the whole. In the same way, we normally regard history as a formidable monolithic block-a mountain subject to slow and powerful subterranean movements. At its peak, tiny characters dance and writhe in a shadow show, imagining them- selves to be the source of the profound movements at their feet. As long as decision making appears as an integrated social function, alongside such other spheres as production or contem- plation, then it is no longer self-evident that all history is political. On the contrary, political history is no more than one sphere among many, which should be studied for itself. History itself becomes more specialized and begins, under cover of an avalanche of facts, to dodge the question of the relative weight of each of these spheres in the making of history. As historians we are generally accustomed to an infrastructuralist view of history which sees in politics a simple epiphenomenon, largely deter- mined by a collection of economic and social conditions that cannot be modified by human will. Yet at the same time, as actors and as citizens, we act as if our intervention had a certain effect. A school of history that claims allegiance to Marxism has given us many examples of these inconsistencies. Furet, in his recent work, has convincingly shown how an overemphasis on the economic aspect of the causes of the French Revolution leads eventually, at the outbreak of revolution in 1789, to a naively Jacques Julliard is Director of Studies at l'Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales in Paris.

The conspiratorial view of revolutionary history is not the sole domain of such reactionary historians as Augustin de Barruel. It can also be the view of social historians who see in conservative governments the simple executive committee of the grande bourgeoisie, or even of economic historians who see in the arrangement of economic facts a plot to create a particular situation.1 We find the same difficulty in the position of a Marxist theoretician like Althusser, who, after advancing the view of the fundamental contradiction as that between productive forces and relations of production, still maintains that this contradiction can hold in reserve a revolutionary structure or an actual revolution. I do not reject the idea that so complex an event as a revolution is the result of an exceptional accumulation of diverse factors, all contributing to the same end. The point is rather than it is an admission of defeat for a basically infrastructuralist theory to take refuge in "overdetermination": in this way there would be one historical causality for everyday, and another for special occa- sions.2 The greatest difficulty in a Marxist or more generally causalist conception of the making of history, which keeps the political dimension in reserve as long as possible, is to go from cause to effect. By denying a specifically political explanation, the infra- structuralist historians condemn themselves to impotence when faced with new, decisive moments when the slow fermentations of the long term suddenly appear to burst, according to this scheme, like bubbles on the surface of history. To say that the revolutionary outbreak, for example, was precipitated by gradual movements in demography or the economy, does not explain either how or why the passage from the "lower" to the "higher" sphere was effected. These historians then resort to tautologies or trivialities: "unique situations," or "the convergence of circum- stances," or even the actions of great men.3 I Francois Furet, Penser la revolutionfranfaise (Paris, 1978), 26-27, 124-125. 2 Louis Althusser (trans.

We leap from the profit curve without transition to the exploits of heroes. Thrown out the door, politics sneaks back in by the window. And this is still politics in the most traditional sense, the politics that has been identified, not without reason, with narrative evenementiel history. This schizophrenia bases itself, one cannot help but wonder how, on "historical materialism." From this perspective we can perceive how the pioneers of the Annales school were able, without too much injustice, to condemn in one fell swoop those associated with positivist nar- rative history as it was practiced in France in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and those representative of a Marx- ist history, who floundered in the meandering revolutionary re- counting of events or in militant apologetics.4 In whatever way it is presented, the argument is essentially the same: political history is psychological, biographical, quali- tative, ideological, evenementiel, in a word, narrative. It is the expression of a naive consciousness, which regards painting as an effort to reproduce its model and which, in the same way, is persuaded that the past exists, buried somewhere underneath the dust or archives or the layers of experience; that it is only a question of rediscovering it, of resuscitating it as a whole. It would not occur to this naive consciousness that its historical object must be constructed and that, if this is not done, the historian con- demns himself to share all the errors of perspective and all the deforming passions of the original actors. If it is not to build something entirely new, then the famous "historical distance" is nothing other than the gradual impoverishment of information along the course of time.5 It is no longer possible to condemn in the same breath or regard with the same disdain types of history that are really different, under the pretext that it is customary to label them with the same term. This would not only be unjust, but also would leave in place an inhibition that too often relegates historical renovation to remain in the cellar. In truth, this movement has 4 I have summarized this argument in a contribution to Jacques Le Goff and Pierre Nora (eds.), Faire de l'histoire (Paris, I974), II, 228-250. 5 Lawrence Stone, "The Revival of Narrative: Reflections on a New Old History," Past &amp; Present, 85 (I979), 3-24.</page><page sequence="4">32 JACQUES JULLIARD reversed itself somewhat in recent years, but the renewal of po- litical and ideological history carries its own risk, that of taking the form of a backlash against infrastructuralist history, a dis- guised return to the most conventional types of history. For these reasons I make a distinction between the different types of political history. Within this category, one can distinguish four different areas: first, traditional narrative history, in which politics is dominant in the chronology of events; second, history where politics constitutes the principal explicative hypothesis; third, po- litical history as the sociology of power; and finally, political history over the long term, which emphasizes not events and mutations, but cultural characteristics and enduring traits. POLITICAL HISTORY AS NARRATIVE HISTORY can take two forms: either the narrow recounting of political events; or a broader narrative in which political history provides the connecting link. We have as an example l'Histoire du Parti Communiste Franfais by Fauvet, currently editor-in-chief of Le Monde, as well as a political scientist and one of the most respected exponents of contemporary French politics. The PCF is a political party, and it is not surprising that political questions are at the heart of this book. But these questions are the object of a narration in which events follow one another in rapid succession. The chapter head- ings are in themselves significant: "A Slow Gestation," "A Dif- ficult Birth," "A Troubled Childhood," and "Maturity," the third part of Volume I. This political monograph is presented, even in its vocabulary, as a biography.6 Behind every narrative history it is not difficult to discern, with more or less ease, the biographical model, which, along with its other advantages, has a well-defined homogeneous subject and a construction like those in fiction: a beginning, the development of the plot, and an end, or at least an epilogue. When we compare this work to Les Communistes FranCais by Kriegel, a historian and political scientist, we find no chronological narrative, but rather an analysis across time of the different "circles" that make up the French Communist Party. It is not that chronology is absent: it 6 Jacques Fauvet, with Alain Duhamel, I'Histoire du Parti Communiste Franfais (Paris, I965), 2v.</page><page sequence="5">POLITICAL HISTORY | 33 is what makes sense of her arguments concerning party member- ship and the succeeding generations of party militants. Party pol- itics is not absent either, but it is integrated into the organic growth of an institution, the PCF, that the author analyzes as a counter society. From the perspective of political narration, the history of the PCF becomes that of its elite and, first of all, of its first leader, Maurice Thorez.7 The biography of Thorez by Robrieux can, as much as Fau- vet's work, be considered a history of the PCF: the approach is the same, even if the value judgments are different. The rhythm is the same, not only because Thorez became so identified with the PCF that their stories overlap, but also because the narrative history of an institution like the PCF has been conceived as a biography.8 POLITICAL HISTORY AS A SYSTEM OF EXPLANATION can best be demonstrated in the case we have just evoked: Is it not appropriate to the fundamental nature of the object of inquiry to give pride of place to political narrative when examining a party? Further, when studying a centralized party run from the top down, is it not appropriate to emphasize the top group, and in so doing implicitly criticize its pretence that the party is really run by its base? The problem is how to express this "preference for the political" when, instead of an individual or a party, the object of study is a historic period in its entirety. Fauvet has written, under the title of La Quatrieme Republique (Paris, 1959), an almost en- tirely partliamentary history of the years I944-I958. This parlia- mentary recitation is considered the very stuff of the collective fate of France during this period simply on the basis of the central role that Parliament took at that time in the process of decision- or of indecision. This approach equates the history of a collectivity with the deliberate expressions of will of its elites. The presence of a representative regime with universal suffrage does permit one to conceive of the political history of the masses as the narration of the words and deeds of their elected representatives. Traditional ideological history is but a variant of this political history founded at the same time on psychology and will. It can 7 Annie Kriegel (trans. by E. P.

And yet, the Reformation quickly escaped the original intentions of Martin Luther; the USSR of Vladimir Ilich Lenin bore little resemblance to the ideas expressed shortly before the Oc- tober Revolution in The State and Revolution (New York, I919). This linear system of causality, which goes from first intentions to the act or which seeks to determine the intellectual responsi- bility of an act (Who wanted it?), sends us back to the biographical and anthropomorphic model described above. It pictures society as an organic whole endowed with a certain number of charac- teristics, among them will. Intellectual history can no more be reduced to this naive model than can political history.9 THE HISTORICAL SOCIOLOGY OF POWER In this approach, the historian owes much to neighboring disciplines, most notably to sociology. Veyne has seen in the writings of Weber "the most exemplary historical work of our century." I would add: the most exemplary work in political history. In Weber's work, which embraces the economic, religious, and social aspects with so much power, the political is not erased or reduced to a pale reflection of other forces, and the autonomy of the political is affirmed with particular vigor by the author of Politik als Beruf. The celebrated distinctions in Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft between the different forms of legitimate domination (traditional, charismatic, and ra- tional) are not merely "ideal types" which would derive from one another, but are also historic figures with all that that implies of risks, ambiguities, and defeats. One could imagine no more rad- ical a break with unbroken linear history. The political history of Weber, like all conceptual efforts, introduces three essential and related elements: discontinuity, typology, and comparison.10 One should not minimize the considerable contributions of the founders of the sociology of political organization such as 9 See on this point the reflections of Roger Chartier in "Histoire intellectuelle ou histoire socio-culturelle: les trajectoires francaises," unpub. ms. (Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales, Paris); William J.

With them, suspicion entered the study of democracy and political history was enriched by a new dimension: one could now measure the distance between words and deeds, latent and surface functions, and finally, sociology and ideology. Under the influence of sociology and political science, history has turned more and more to the underlying meaning of politics at the occasional expense of politics itself; the analysis of the structure of power, of its language, overshadows the study of its effects. In this sense, the way to study the politics of a government is not only to study its method of conducting public business and making decisions in matters of defense, economy, internal order, and culture, but also to study the strategies of ruling groups to win or conserve power. In a democratic country, the art of gov- erning can be summarized as a permanent arbitration between the desire to make the best-if not always the most popular-decision in terms of the interests of the country and the temptation to make the decision which will most favor the re-election of the leaders. POLITICAL HISTORY OVER THE LONG TERM No matter how strong the link between politics and events-to the point that, although not all events are political, one can hardly conceive of events with no political implications-it is still true that political beliefs take deeper root in the individual and collective consciousness, where they become connected to the religious, or at least to the general system of beliefs. The question of politics is part of the problem of the "third floor" of Agulhon. Indeed, should one speak at all of the third floor if one agrees with Ernest Labrousse, the great structural historian, who considers that the social lags behind the economic and the intellectual behind the social, or would it be more appropriate to speak of the first floor, or even the cellar? In reality, now that the infrastructuralist system has shown its im- potence, or at least its inadequacy, the idea of a linear causality where the economic, social, and intellectual aspects of history succeed one another in the manner of biblical geneaology has become less and less acceptable. For proof, we can look at politics as it is manifest not only in the very short term, but also over time. 1 II Maurice Agulhon, La Republique au village (Paris, 1970; 2nd. ed. I979).</page><page sequence="8">36 | JACQUES JULLIARD Using voting behavior as an example of the ambivalence of politics, we find, at first glance, that there is nothing more con- junctural, more prey to economic and other fluctuations of the moment, or to the caprice of public opinion, than voting. Further, it is in principle an example of "weak political behavior," to use the expression of Bertrand de Jouvenel, as opposed to "strong political behavior" such as popular movements or revolutions. But unlike popular movements and revolutions, voting still has the methodological advantage of being by nature quantifiable, with a long, continuous and relatively homogeneous source of data. Yet electoral behavior, where so many accidents and idio- syncrasies intervene, cannot be explained without recourse to the long term, combining the effects of public opinion and mental structures.12 At the end of Tableau politique de la France sous la Troisieme Republique (Paris, 1913), a pioneering work of electoral geography and sociology, Andre Siegfried, noting the relative weakness of the geo-social explanations advanced to account for the political behavior of voters, spoke of the "mystery of ethnic tempera- ments." This is, to be sure, a confession of failure and an open if not proud recourse to tautology. But beyond that, it is the admission by a rigorous, even positivist mind, that politics, in whatever way one approaches it, always escapes the limitations of a simple system of causality, and thus touches on the psychol- ogy of the unconscious and the geological strata, as it were, of individuals and social groups. In this sense, politics escapes the unsettled froth of the history of events and finds itself, paradox- ically, in the realm of the history of the immovable. It is remark- able that this political map of France is nearly unchanged since the beginning of universal suffrage. Many others have noted, since Goguel, the striking similarity between the distribution of votes obtained by the Democratic- Socialists in the legislative elections of 13 May, 1849 and that of votes in the referendum of 5 May, 1946 in favor of the new constitution. The similarity has endured to this day, if one com- I2 I say in principle, since elections can at times be the site of major political confron- tations. It has been said that the Czech Communists in February I948 unleashed the series of events now called the coup of Prague in order to avoid a defeat in the forthcoming elections predicted by the polls. Cf. Francois Fejt6, Le coup de Prague, 1948 (Paris, I976). We should therefore join Francois Goguel in distinguishing between "elections of appease- ment" and "elections of combat."</page><page sequence="9">POLITICAL HISTORY 37 pares the maps of these two elections to that of the votes obtained by Franqois Mitterrand in the second round of the presidential election of I9 May, I974. But we should not press this comparison too far. Besides, since these maps are drawn up at the level of departments, they may lead to error by concealing many local disputes. Nevertheless, the general outline of the Left-Right cleav- age remains; it appears to have resisted any change.13 In many respects these maps, which are those of the French Left for the past I30 years, constitute the inverse of the well known map of religious observance in rural France drawn up by Boulard, suggesting a strong correlation between religiosity and votes for the Right. This has been confirmed by the results of opinion surveys. In spite of the decline in church attendance over the past quarter century, religious observance has remained the strongest indicator of voting behavior, stronger in any case than any socio-professional indices one could construct.14 The temptation is great to see in politics a crystallization and in some sense a secularization of religion. But it is a temptation one must resist, if only because, in the urban environment, the usefulness of the religious variable has diminished along with religious observance itself. Furthermore, this variable is hardly everywhere what Labrousse has called "the least substitutable antecedent." In the end, its singular effectiveness in France is because, in the society of the nineteenth century, of which traces remain most visible in the countryside, the religious question was the primary conflict. Elections expressed and even reinforced it. Electoral competition, as its name implies, is a confrontation which derives strength from whatever it finds in society: profound trends, opinions, and aspirations which are in some way arranged and organized. The vote is a simple form of expression, reducing the multiplicity of conflicts to a single choice-the reds against the whites, Left against Right. One might ask whether, locally at 13 There are many works referring to this similarity: Goguel, Geographie des lections franfaises de 1870 a 1951 (Paris, I95); idem, La politique des partis sous la IVeme Ripublique (Paris, 1970; 4th ed.); Rene Remond, La vie politique en France depuis 1789 (Paris, 1965- 1969), 2 v.; Goguel and Alfred Grosser, La Politique en France, (Paris, 1970; 4th ed.); Friedric Bon, Les elections en France, (Paris, 1978). 14 Fernand Boulard, An Introduction to Religious Sociology (London, 9g60), 36. The same conclusions were reached by Guy Michelat and Michel Simon in Classe, religion et com- portement politique (Paris, 1977), a dual investigation by non-directive interviews and opinion surveys.</page><page sequence="10">38 | JACQUES JULLIARD least, particular electoral behavior in a particular place, which often outlives modifications in the religious or social context, does not depend also on other factors leading to oppositions or even conflicts. For example, there are geographical factors: opposition between town and country, mountain and plain or valley, bocage and open field, areas where circulation is easy and those where it is difficult, the coast and the inland; or administrative factors: the frontier effect created over time by more or less artificial divisions leading to different political consequences (a problem well known in post-colonial Africa), or the rivalry of two cities for regional hegemony. In the same manner, one could raise the question of the role of notables in elections, not as a specific factor so much as a more or less contingent support of particular positions the implications of which can be much more profound.15 The intention is not to exhaust the list of theoretically pos- sible determinants of electoral behavior, but rather to indicate those which may have at some moment given support to political bipolarity. It may even be that the confrontation itself creates this effect and not, as is generally believed, the reverse. The idea is to view suffrage as a universal symbolic language, a reduction of the conflicts across society. Thus the link established by historians between this political behavior and that problem, conflict, or mentality, may indeed be spurious, as is clearly shown by Agul- hon in his inquiry into the establishment of the republic in the countryside of the Var. His problem was to explain how a people, in less than half a century, could have gone from one end of the political spectrum to the other. The role of contingency in the choice of a political system is clearly described. In the space of half a century, peasant discontent is expressed now on the Right, now on the Left. A few hundred kilometers away, the contrast is still more striking, as has been brilliantly demonstrated by Bois in the case of the Sarthe.16 I5 Cf. the study, still in progress, initiated by Francois Furet and Jacques Ozouf, in which I took part, at the Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales, Paris, on the historical origins of the distribution of voting behavior in contemporary France. Alain Corbin, Archaisme et modernite en Limousin au XIXeme siecle, 1845-1880 (Paris, 1975), is not "far from thinking" that the town-country opposition "was the most important factor conditioning the political behavior of the Limousin population from 1845 to I880." One could draw similar conclusions from the study of Paul Bois on the Sarthe (see below, note i6). I6 Agulhon, La Republique au village; Bois, Paysans de l'ouest. Des structures economiques et sociales aux options politiques depuis l'epoque revolutionnaire (Paris, I960; abridged ed., Paris, I97I).</page><page sequence="11">POLITICAL HISTORY t 39 Compared with many of his predecessors, who on the whole limited themselves to describing the economic and social condi- tioning of political behavior, Agulhon, while taking this condi- tioning into account, has tried to establish the specifically political factors in political behavior: in the case of Var, the role of intel- lectual and bourgeois activists in inciting the popular classes on behalf of democracy. "The influence of the 'political' is then, in other terms, the influence of classes bearing the very features of national history." As Agulhon takes pains to point out, this ap- proach is not necessarily generalizable. But to our mind it has the great merit of tackling politics head on-for itself-and showing that with comparable social and economic structures, it is culture that makes the difference.17 But what is political culture? This question is of some mo- ment in France, where it has led to new historical projects and essays, and has even entered into political debate.18 The work of Bois, cited above, tries to show how a political tradition strongly identified with the Right, that of the west of France and in par- ticular the department of the Sarthe, goes back to an original event, the French Revolution. To the peasants hungry for land, the sale of the nationalized lands was a great disappointment, because for the most part it was the urban bourgeoisie that was able to purchase them. This basic frustration made the peasantry susceptible to the appeals of the counter-revolution and was the starting point for an uninterrupted chain of political attitudes and voting behavior from the nineteenth century to our time. Of course, the revolutionary trauma took place in a particular socio- economic context. In emphasizing a formative event, as Le Roy Ladurie put it: "the narrative-structural historian that is Paul Bois" has not overlooked traditional factors of conditioning. But he has shown how inside these "the fleeting event secreted a lasting mentality: the short term secreted the long term." 19 I7 Among Agulhon's predecessors are A. Armengaud, Les populations de l'Est acquitain au debut de l'epoque contemporaine (Paris, 1961); Georges Dupeux, Aspects de l'histoire sociale et politique du Loir et Cher, 1848-1914 (Paris, 1962); Philippe Vigier, la seconde Republique dans la region alpine, etude politique et sociale (Paris, 1963); to which one must add the studies of Corbin and Bois, already cited.

Normally, one considers the first as having ignited the second; the example of the Sarthe shows also that, on the contrary, a passing sociopolitical circumstance can give way to a durable and even fossilized political culture, to the extent that it has nothing more to do with the event that served as its inspi- ration. This formal causality does not always work in the same sense. In the neighboring Limousin studied by Corbin, the re- sentment of the town by the countryside, comparable in nature to that in the Sarthe but making its appearance during the Rev- olution of 1848, gave birth to a political culture of the extreme Left, not of the extreme Right. Another example of the formative role of an event and its later consequences leading to the foundation of a genuine political tradition, this time not only regional, but also national in scope, is the commentary of Furet on the theory ofJacobinism elaborated by Auguste Cochin, a forgotten and then rediscovered theoreti- cian of the French Revolution. In the end, even bearing in mind the advances in historical work on the French Revolution-and one thinks immediately of the work of Labrousse-what remains most mysterious in this great affair is not the short or long term conditions that set the Revolution in motion; is it the motion itself-its "torrent" as Furet puts it. The example of so many other Western nations suggests to us that the "profound causes" could have led to a roughly identical modern France without having taken the revolutionary path. But, where the French Rev- olution can be said to be irreplaceable is at the level of politics: here its work is indelible; French political society is steeped in it. One is almost tempted to say that political culture is what is left when all else has been tried.20 As Tocqueville said over and over again, there existed in France a "pre-Jacobinism" before the Revolution. In this sense, the Revolution was a continuation of the Ancien Regime by other means. That the tradition of the Ancien Regime was completely absorbed by the new political culture established after 1789, and that this monarchical conduct became an essential component of the new democratic ideal, justifies the prominence of the Revo- lution in French history. Of this analysis, I retain three elements which we have already encountered: first, the frequent occurrence 20 Furet, Penser la revolutionfranfaise (Paris, 1978).</page><page sequence="13">POLITICAL HISTORY | 41 of a formative event at the origin of a political tradition; second, the role of "circles of thought" in the elaboration ofJacobinism; last, and most important, the express wish not to reduce the political dimension to a crystallization, more or less superficial, and more or less parasitic, of the economic or the social dimen- sion. On the contrary we make the political dimension the very object of analysis: "In the end," writes Furet, "the Marxist Vul- gate of the history of the French Revolution turns the world upside down: It situates the revolutionary break at the level of the economic and social, when nothing resembles the society of Louis XVI so much as the society of Louis Philippe."21 In an attempt to define the possible meanings of political history and to describe its recent expressions, I have admittedly taken the easiest course. But the very object of this effort impels me to go beyond this exposition and to imagine, not what will be-pre- diction has never been a strong point of historians-but what could be political history in the years to come. To put the question differently, what is the relationship be- tween political and contemporary history and do they have some- thing particular in common? The re-examination of the issues and methods of history that took place in France under the aegis of Marc Bloch and Lucien Febvre of the Annales appears to have bypassed both political and contemporary history. At its incep- tion, however, Annales attached particular importance to the study of the contemporary world; Febvre even wished for a reverse history that would begin with the present day and go back in time. At the same time, the journal manifested a certain mistrust of political history.22 But contemporary history soon lost ground as well, falling into the same disregard as political history, and the new history skirted them both. This dismissal was hardly accidental since it is genuinely difficult, when studying the present day, to set aside the intentions and wills of actors. Is this because, without the distance of time, these intentions and wills are the only explanations at our disposal? Or is it, in a more serious vein, because they have acquired in the world of today an importance that they lacked in former times? 2I Alexis de Tocqueville, L'ancien regime et la revolution (Paris, I856); Furet, Penser la revolution, 41. 22 Cf. Andre Burguiere, "Histoire d'une histoire: la naissance des Annales," Annales, XXXIV (i979), I347-I359.</page><page sequence="14">42 I JACQUES JULLIARD Two hypotheses can now be presented: the first is the con- tinued increase of the number of actors implicated in political decision making; the second is the continued extension of the sphere of application of these decisions. The first hypothesis challenges historians to reflect on what they think about the democratic credo, which over the past thirty years has come to hold the allegiance of the majority of people: it is the masses, whether by regular and peaceable means, through the exercise of universal suffrage, or by sudden and violent means, who make history-and make it with greater and greater con- sciousness. "The history of a revolution," wrote Trotsky, "is for us first of all a history of the forcible entrance of the masses into the realm of rulership over their own destiny." The claim of universal suffrage is that it establishes the rule of popular sover- eignty. No one has ever claimed, not evenJean Jacques Rousseau, that popular sovereignty can rule over the physical world as it can over society; that it can eliminate the realm of necessity. But if the dogma of popular sovereignty is valid, then with the coming of universal suffrage the true social history has become political history.23 As proof a contrario, one need only remark that the destruc- tion of liberal and democratic society by totalitarianism, far from liquidating the dogma of the power of the masses, has on the contrary based itself on it. Most assuredly, the parody of democ- racy acted out by nearly all the tyrants on the surface of the earth is like the compliment that vice pays to virtue.24 But must historians become systematically neo-Machiavel- lian along the lines of Vilfredo Pareto, and see everywhere in the forms of democratic participation a mere camouflage of the power of elites? It is true that the first, the most illustrious, and the most influential of the neo-Machiavellians was Marx himself, in his denunciation of the illusions of political democracy. And yet, in Marxism, politics got its revenge in the end; the democratic skep- ticism changed in a flash into socialist idealism. What then is socialism if not the moment when the political is placed, to join Mao Tse Tung, at "the command post" of society, where the people's will becomes the true infrastructure of society? The es- sential point is that contemporary historians are obliged to give 23 Leon Trotsky, The Russian Revolution (New York, 1959), ix-x. 24 See the work of Hannah Arendt, The Origins of Totalitarianism (New York, I951), Pt. 3.</page><page sequence="15">POLITICAL HISTORY 43 pride of place, if only to unmask its illusions, to democratic decision making. The second hypothesis is closely linked to the first. Does not the increasing weight of science and technology in the modern world tend to increase, if only modestly, the role of the conscious and the voluntary in social life? Alongside the economy as some- thing endured by men, should not the student of contemporary history give greater weight to the attempts of governments and social institutions to master the economy-in other words, give due credit to strategies, in effect to policies? In the same way, we attempt today to master demographic change, to regulate it by influencing fertility and sterility, instead of leaving this regulation to the "natural" forces of famine, war, and epidemic. This action extends even into the realm of culture, which is now, alas, the object of a strategy-that is, a policy. For the moment, the results are still meager. In spite of the means of analysis, prediction, and intervention at our disposal, modern economies have been unable either to predict or to van- quish the crises that beseige them. The scales still tilt in the direction of necessity, not of will. In the demographic realm, not only do the great catastrophes of the past remain historical agents of the first order, but the demographers confess their inability to explain satisfactorily the changes in the attitudes and behavior of populations in life questions. However, we are now entering an era of "programmed so- cieties" in which collective political decisions weigh ever more heavily in the life of the individual. And should it not be consid- ered a turning point in the history of mankind and the coming of age of politics, itself the child of science and technology, that for the first time the greatest cataclysm threatening humanity is no longer natural, but the product of human will: the nuclear holo- caust? For the contemporary historian, above and beyond the tra- ditional approaches to politics (such as narrative accounts and critical sociologies of power), which there is no question of elim- inating, there are two particularly effective ways to make use of political studies to understand societies under scrutiny: to measure the weight of the past through the political cultures that issue from it; and to evaluate the weight of the future through the different implications of social programming. What is the relation of political history to change? Change</page><page sequence="16">44 | JACQUES JULLIARD can hardly be said to be popular today among historians; most prefer the study of continuities and structures, glancing only briefly at the conditions of passage from one state to another, from one system to another. For the man of action, however, the factors of change are the essential question. The detachment of today's historians from anything that could be a guide for action was perhaps the condition for the attainment by the discipline of scientific status, or was perhaps simply an escape from the prob- lems of today; but in any case this detachment is already well established. In closing the renowned, perhaps too well renowned book by Febvre on the religion of Francois Rabelais, one cannot help but wonder when and how atheism could have ever arisen in contemporary France, so much did the old mentalities keep everything under lock and key. And yet, mentalities change.25 The search for causality in history, or even more modestly, the revelation of structures and persistences, leads one to forget that there is always more to an event than its causes; that in history there is permanent innovation. At the risk of imagining the historical unfolding of events as the unending and inexorable development from an initial "big bang," one must admit that social history is in part a continuous creation. To say this is in no way to imply the negation of determinism, but only to reject the linear conception, in imitation of Newtonian physics, of historical evolution, in favor of a more analytical, or rather, cybernetic view of this evolution. The analysis of a maze of independent yet converging se- quences in an original fused whole, not reducible to the sum of its parts, is in modern society the task of political history, pre- cisely because political history takes into account the strategies of actors in the face of historical necessity. In modern societies, the inter-relations are sufficiently numerous to give birth to events, institutions, and even structures that are sufficiently complex for the word political to remain the only one capable of describing them. 25 Jacques Revel, "Histoire et science sociale: les paradigmes des Annales," Annales, XXXIV (1979), 1371: "The history dominant in the Annales is divorced from any analysis of social change."
