<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Yuan Buddhist Mural of the Paradise of Bhaisajyaguru ANNINGJING A MONUMENTAL BUDDHIST MURAL in The Metropolitan Museum of Art depicting the Paradise of Bhaisajyaguru (Figure 1) has long been mistaken as the Assembly of Sakyamuni.' Problems concerning its function, date, and stylistic position in the pictorial tradition of Chinese Bud- dhist art have not yet been solved. The present essay attempts to clarify these and some closely related is- sues, including the date of a Maitreya mural in To- ronto, the origin of Tejaprabha Buddha, and the school of Zhu HaoguA (see Glossary for the Chinese characters keyed to the superscript letters). The Metropolitan Museum's mural came from the eastern gable wall of the Main Hall of the Guangsheng Lower Monastery (Guangsheng XiasiB), one of the two compounds of a Buddhist monastery known as Guangsheng Sic, which is situated about fourteen and a half miles southeast of the county seat of Zhaocheng County in the Huo Mountains of southern Shanxi Province (Figure 2). The other compound is the Guangsheng Upper Monastery (Guangsheng ShangsiD). The two compounds are located about a mile apart, with the Upper Monas- tery on a hillside and the Lower Monastery at the foot of the hill.2 The Lower Monastery is constructed along a north-south axis, with a gate at the south end of the compound, a Front Hall in the middle, and the Main Hall at the northern end. The two halls are connected by a walkway and flanked by subsidiary buildings (Figure 3). The buildings-now protected by the state mainly for their architectural merit- were reconstructions of earlier buildings that were destroyed in a devastating earthquake, which struck the area in 1303.3 ? The Metropolitan Museum of Art 1991 Metropolitan Museum Journal 26 Guangsheng Si predates the Tang dynasty (618- 907). According to the Gazetteer of the Prefecture of Pingyang (Pingyang fuzhiE), the monastery was first built in A.D. 147.4 Another early gazetteer re- lates that the Upper Monastery (Guangsheng Shangsi) was rebuilt in 769,5 a date probably based on an inscription indicating the twenty-seventh day of the fifth month of that year. Recarved in 1064 on a stone stele now set in a wall of the Rear Hall in the Upper Monastery,6 the inscription says that the orig- inal name of the monastery was Ayu Wang (King Asoka). In 769 Emperor Daizong (r. 762-779) of the Tang dynasty granted it the name Guangsheng (Vast Triumph), which is still its name.7 Guangsheng Si had a close association with roy- alty. Not only was its name granted by Tang Daizong but, also during the Yuan dynasty (1271-1368), a portrait of Khubilai Khan (1215-94, the founder and the first emperor of the Yuan Dynasty) was hung in the monastery where ceremonies for the celebration of royal birthdays also took place. The monastery was also known for its Buddhist relics and an imperially bestowed Tripitaka (literally, Three Baskets, a comprehensive compilation of Buddhist writings).8 Little is known about the edi- tion of this Tripitaka, but about 4,700 out of 7,000 volumes of a valuable Jin (1115-1234) edition Tri- pitaka, probably a different set, have been preserved in the monastery.9 It was through the discovery of this Jin edition Tripitaka in 1933 that Guangsheng Si became well known to the outside world. By the early 1930s many scholars had visited the monastery, among whom were Laurence Sickman, Liang Sicheng, and Lin Huiyin.10 The last two investigated the monas- tery in 1933. They saw fragments of a mural on the eastern gable wall in the Main Hall of the Lower Monastery and learned that in 1927 the murals on The notes for this article begin on page 163. 147</page><page sequence="2">Figure i.

In their 1935 article Liang Sicheng and Lin Huiyin also mentioned the murals that they believed belonged originally to the Front Hall and had been sold be- fore 1927. These murals were eventually acquired by three museums in the United States: two entered the University Museum of the University of Penn- sylvania between 1926 and 1929; one was acquired by the Nelson-Atkins Art Gallery in Kansas City in 1932; and another was purchased by Arthur M. Sackler and later given to the Metropolitan in 1954.12 Aschwin Lippe has pointed out that the length of the murals in Philadelphia, presumably around 32 feet each in their original condition, was about the length of the gable wall of the Front Hall of the Lower Monastery, which is about 33 feet long, while the length of the murals in Kansas City and in the Metropolitan, each almost 50 feet long, is equal to the length of the gable wall of its Main Hall. Using these measurements as a basis, Lippe proposed rather convincingly that the Philadelphia set came from the Front Hall and the paintings in Kansas City and in the Metropolitan from the two gable walls in the Main Hall.'3 While he correctly identi- fied the subject of the mural in Kansas City as Teja- prabha, his identification of the subject of the Met- ropolitan Museum's mural as the Assembly of Sakyamuni deserves reconsideration. The Metropolitan Museum's mural is centered upon a triad of a Buddha and two major bodhisatt- vas (Figure 4). The Buddha is attended by four sec- ondary bodhisattvas: one on his upper right up- 148</page><page sequence="3">Figure 2. Map of Shanxi Province holding a moon disk, one on his upper left holding a sun disk, one on his lower right carrying a monk's staff (khakkhara), and one on his lower left bearing a bowl (pdtra). Each of the two major bodhisattvas is attended by a minor bodhisattva. Below the triad are four minor bodhisattvas: two making offerings to the Buddha and one offering to each of the two major bodhisattvas. Above the triad are two flying attendants (apsarasas) and six more miniature Bud- dhas. It is these six small Buddhas that Lippe took as the basis for his identification of the subject of the mural as the Assembly of Sakyamuni: "Together with the central figure they almost certainly repre- sent the Seven Buddhas of the Past: that is, the his- torical Buddha Sakyamuni and the six 'mortal' Bud- dhas that were supposed to have preceded him. The Figure 3. Plan of the Guangsheng Lower Monastery, Shanxi (after Zhongguo gudai jianzhu shi [Peking, 1984], fig. 144-1) assembly would then be the one of Sakyamuni." 14 Indeed, a group of six Buddhas may represent the six mortal Buddhas preceding Sakyamuni, but there are other possibilities. For example, they could also represent the six predecessors of Bhai- sajyaguru, the Buddha of medicine. According to the Saptatathagatapurvapranidhanavisesa sutra, a Bud- dhist text translated by Yi JingF (635-713), Bhai- sajyaguru is preceded by six Buddhas. Before they became fully enlightened Buddhas, they took a pre- scribed number of vows to help sentient beings. The vows culminated in the Twelve Great Vows of Bhai- sajyaguru.15 In Chinese Buddhist art, Bhai?ajya- guru and his six predecessors are frequently pre- sented together as a group. For instance, the seven medical Buddhas as a group appear in many caves at Dunhuang, including Caves 9, 99, 126, 155, and 149</page><page sequence="4">Figure 4. Drawing of Paradise of Bha4ajyaguru.

In the Museum's mural the six small Buddhas must be the predecessors of Bhai- sajyaguru, who can be positively identified by the presence of the other bodhisattvas and guardian generals pertaining to his paradise and by his hand gesture (mudra) and attribute. The Buddha sits on a lotus throne in the center (Figure 5). His right hand is raised at the level of the breast with the palm turned upward and the index and the thumb close to each other in a variant of dharmacakra mudrd, or teaching gesture. In paintings of Bhaisajyaguru from Dunhuang, if the Buddha's right hand is not holding a monk's staff, it usually displays the teaching gesture with the index and thumb forming a ring, while his left hand holds a bowl, a symbol of medicine (Figure 6). In the Met- ropolitan Museum's mural the three iconographical features of Bhaisajyaguru-the teaching gesture, the monk's staff, and the bowl-are present: his monk's staff is carried by the bodhisattva at his lower right and the bowl is held toward him by the bod- hisattva at his lower left. Bhaisajyaguru is believed to be a Buddha of sal- vation. The faithful turn to him for enlightenment as well as for the prevention of disasters and for the material things needed in this world. Through the Twelve Great Vows that he took as a bodhisattva he pledged that after he became a Buddha, he would do the following: (1) give bodily perfection of a Buddha to all the sentient beings; (2) enlighten all those who are still groping in the dark; (3) bring a life of plenty to every person; (4) convert those who do not practice Mahayana Buddhism (the "Great Vehicle," one of the three major Buddhist practices); (5) insure that all his students would follow instruc- tions and behave well; (6) cure those with bodily de- formities and mental disabilities; (7) relieve the des- titute and homeless when they hear his name; (8) insure that women who are unhappy with their sex may be reborn as men; (9) lead the fallen onto the correct path; (1o) free prisoners from death row; (11) give a feast to the desperate driven by hunger before their spiritual meals; and (12) colorfully garb the naked exposed to the elements and insects and provide amusement through dancers and musi- cians.16 The two most important bodhisattvas in the par- adise of Bhaisajyaguru are Siryaprabha, the Sun- light Bodhisattva, and Candraprabha, the Moon- light Bodhisattva.

In the Metropolitan Museum's mural the bodhisattva at the upper left of the Bud- dha, holding a sun disk with a red bird in the middle, is clearly Sfryaprabha. His counterpart at the upper right of the Buddha holding a moon disk is Candraprabha. According to the Bhaisajyaguru- purvapranidhdna sftra, the two possess the orthodox teaching of Bhaisajyaguru and occupy the highest positions among the countless bodhisattvas in this Buddha's paradise.17 In scenes of Bhaisajyaguru paradise, the two bodhisattvas usually form a triad with the Buddha. Since they are specific bodhisattvas rather than generalized figures, their counterparts below-that is, the two bodhisattvas who carry the monk's staff and the bowl for Bhaisajyaguru-might also not be generalized figures: the one with the bowl might be Bhaisajyaraja and the other with the monk's staff ^- ~~J' s . ,{.~~~~~~~~~j '.r^-&lt; J _ 'vSI - T r: _ *' s.- i _: &lt; H z - *- : -i Figurc (6.

Ming dynasty, after 1475. Philadelphia, University Museum, University of Pennsylvania (photo: University Museum) Bhaisajyasamudgata. It was believed that the two were brothers associated with medicine for the ben- efit of all sentient beings. According to the Bhaisajya- rajabhais4ajyasamudgati sutra, the two brothers became bodhisattvas because of the wonderful medicine of- fered to monks in their previous lives. Those who hear the names of the two would be freed from suf- fering and from the cycle of birth and rebirth (sam- sdra).18 Their association with Bhaisajyaguru is made clear in the text Foshuo guanding bachu guozui shengsi dedu jingc, in which they are mentioned as two of the Eight Great Bodhisattvas serving Bhai- sajyaguru.19 Another important feature of the Paradise of Bhaisajyaguru is the presence of the Twelve Guard- ian Generals who symbolize the Buddha's Twelve Great Vows. According to Bhaisajyagurupurvaprani- dhCna sutra, they pledge to protect those who dis- seminate Bhaisajyaguru's teaching and make offer- ings to the Buddha in order to free them from suffering and fulfill all their wishes.20 In the mural the Twelve Guardian Generals are depicted in two groups on either side. The twelve figures appear on one of the pair of murals from the gable walls in the Front Hall of the Guangsheng Lower Monastery, now in the Univer- sity Museum (Figure 8). Among them (four on the right side, seen only in fragments) the second from the right of the Buddha carries a monk's staff while the second from the left of the Buddha holds a bowl. The presence of the Twelve Guardian Gener- als and of the monk's staff paired with the bowl car- ried by two of them indicate that the Philadelphia mural also portrays the paradise of Bhai?ajyaguru. The subject is further clarified by the representa- tion of the central Buddha and the two major bod- hisattvas. Like the Bhaisajyaguru Buddha in the Metropolitan Museum's mural, the central Buddha's right hand is in a variant of the teaching gesture, while his left hand is placed on his left knee with the palm turned downward. Each of the two major bod- hisattvas has a disk on his head and these can be read as the sun disk and the moon disk, the attri- butes of Sfryaprabha and Candraprabha. Normally the two major bodhisattvas in a paradise of Bhaisajyaguru are Suryaprabha and Candra- 153</page><page sequence="8">Figure 9. Pedestal. Chinese, Tang dynasty, ca. A.D. 650.

In the Metro- politan's mural they are relegated to secondary po- sitions after two bodhisattvas, Avalokitesvara and Cintamanicakra, with the former on the Buddha's right. This part of the mural is particularly frag- mentary and has been heavily restored, so that it is difficult to identify the attribute in his right hand. But on his headdress, seven red miniature Buddhas in gestures of meditation (dhydna mudrd) are visible. In Chinese Buddhist art the color red and the med- itation gesture are characteristic of Amitabha, and a miniature Amitabha in the headdress of a bodhi- sattva indicates Avalokitesvara. The presence of Amitabha in the headdress of Avalokitesvara is also described in Buddhist scriptures such as the Amo- ghapdsadhdra ni sutra.21 What is unusual in the headdress is that there are seven images of Amitabha, a larger one above six smaller ones. This arrangement may refer to a spe- cial relationship between the Paradise of Bhaisajya- guru and that of Amitabha. In Chinese Buddhist art, the Paradise of Bhaisajyaguru, which is believed to be the Eastern Paradise, is usually paired with the Western Paradise of Amitabha. In Bhaisajyagugu texts the only paradise mentioned, other than that of Bhaisajyaguru, is the Paradise of Amitabha. Ac- cording to the Bhaisajyagurupurvapranidhdna sftra, anyone who wishes to be reborn in the Paradise of Amitabha can have his wish fulfilled if he hears the name of Bhaisajyaguru once in his lifetime. At the end of a person's life, eight great bodhisattvas, in- cluding Avalokitesvara, descend from heaven to guide him to the Paradise of Amitabha.22 There- fore, by putting faith in Bhaisajyaguru, one is also guaranteed access to the Paradise of Amitabha. In the Metropolitan's mural the larger figure of Ami- tabha on the top might suggest the link between the Paradise of Amitabha and that of Bhaisajyaguru, and the six smaller figures might allude to connec- tions between Amitabha and the six predecessors of Bhaisajyaguru at the top in the mural. It is notable that in the mural Avalokitesvara is combined with Bhaisajyaguru. Another example of such a combination is a Tang Buddhist pedestal with inscriptions in the University Museum, Philadel- phia. In the center of the right face of the pedestal is Bhaisajyaguru, who holds a bowl and is flanked by four identical images of Avalokitesvara (Fig- ure 9). The other major bodhisattva on the left of the Metropolitan Museum's Bhaisajyaguru also has a red Amitabha on his headdress; this suggests his as- sociation with Amitabha, while his other attributes 154</page><page sequence="9">identify him as Cintamanicakra, another form of Avalokitesvara. Cintamanicakra's popular forms often have mul- tiple arms, with each hand holding one attribute of- fering another way to salvation, as in the image of a six-armed Cintamanicakra (Figure io). In the Met- ropolitan's mural, however, Cintamanicakra is pre- sented in his less well-known two-arm form; his left hand holds a gem (mani) and his right hand per- forms a variant of a gift-bestowing gesture (varada mudrd). In a text on a Buddha known as Tejaprabha entitled Da sheng miao jixiang pusa shuo chuzaijiaoling falunH, Cintamanicakra is described as holding a round gem in his left hand and performing a gift- bestowing gesture with his right hand.23 The attrib- ute and gesture of the bodhisattva in the Museum's mural agree exactly with this textual description. The agreement cannot be a coincidence: on the wall opposite that of the Metropolitan Museum's mural there was a painted Assembly of Tejaprabha, which is now in the Nelson-Atkins Art Gallery. This un- usual combination was adopted not only in the Main Hall but also in the Front Hall. Traditionally, Bhaisajyaguru was not paired with Tejaprabha. In about ninety-six caves in Dunhuang which contain the paradise paintings of Bhaisajya- guru, ranging in date from the Sui dynasty (581- 618) to the Song dynasty (960-1279), there is not a single case in which the Paradise of Bhaisajyaguru is paired with the Assembly of Tejaprabha. Why was Bhaisajyaguru paired with Tejaprabha in the Lower Monastery murals? What is the religious signifi- cance of such an iconographical design? To solve these problems we need to know more about Teja- prabha, who has not yet been studied in any signif- icant depth. Tejaprabha is one of the most nebulous Buddhist figures, for he and his entourage are unrelated to the main body of the Buddhist pantheon. Alexan- der Soper defines the role of this iconographically complex Buddha as follows: "His prime function was to serve as a magical control against natural ab- errations and catastrophes of celestial origin."24 This function will become clear once his origin is clarified. A textual study of Buddhist treatises on astron- omy suggests that Tejaprabha had not yet evolved into an independent entity by the time of the Chi- nese Buddhist monk Ixing' (673-727), one of the most important early architects for the hierarchic system of celestial deities in Chinese Buddhism. The text Fantian huoluo jiuyaoJ attributed to Ixing Figure 1 . Tejaprabha Buddha and the Five Planets, from Dun- huang, Gansu. Tang dynasty, dated 897. Ink and colors on silk, 80.4 x 55.4 cm.

Rubbing (from Needham, Science and Civilization in China III, fig. 9o) 155</page><page sequence="10">Figure 13. Astronomical diagram of Beidou. Excavated at Mojuzi, Wuwei, Gansu. Han dynasty (from Wenwu, no. 12 [1972], p. 14) teaches the prevention of calamities by worshiping the Nine Luminaries (the Five Planets-Mercury, Venus, Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars-plus the Sun, Moon, and two Indian celestial deities, Ketu and Raru); here, Tejaprabha is not even mentioned. His significant absence and the description of the Nine Luminaries in human forms suggest that the con- cept of Tejaprabha did not even exist when the icon- ographical identities of the Nine Luminaries were more or less formed.25 Another text, Xiuyao iguiK, written by Ixing on the secret incantation (dharani) of the Nine Luminaries, presents the concept of Tejaprabha in embryonic form. In that text the expression "Tejaprabhabud- dhausnisa" (Chishengguang fodingL), or the Bud- dha Crown (that is, a turban as one of the thirty-two auspicious signs of a Buddha) of Tejaprabha, occurs as the name of a dao changM, or shrine for offerings to dispel catastrophes caused by the disarray of the Luminaries.26 In the text Foshuo chishengguang daweide xiaozaijix- iang tuoluoni jingN,27 translated into Chinese by the Chinese monk Bu Kong0 (705-774), Tejaprabha is still not yet mentioned as an independent Buddha. By the end of the ninth century, however, Teja- prabha emerged in visual art as a celestial Buddha with a stellar retinue of the Five Planets. In a Dun- huang painting dated 897 (Figure 11), the earliest of six known surviving Tejaprabha paintings,28 the Buddha is depicted as a celestial ruler sitting in a chariot in a royal procession followed by the Five Planets, which are easily recognizable because of their rather standard attributes: Mercury as a fe- male scribe with a brush in one hand and a sacred Buddhist text (sutra) in the other, Venus as a female musician with a pipa (a Chinese lute), Saturn as an ascetic with a bull, Jupiter as an official with offer- ings, and Mars as a warrior with weapons. In later paintings the retinue is expanded to include more planets, the Twenty-eight Constellations and other stellar deities. The figural representation and iconography of Tejaprabha is derived from that of the Chinese BeidouP, the constellation known in the West as the Great Bear or Big Dipper (Ursa Major). In China Beidou was regarded as the controller of stars in the heaven and of men on the earth. In establishing a celestial pantheon in Chinese Buddhism, which was necessary for Buddhists because of the cardinal im- portance of astronomy in religious, political, social, and economic life and in state affairs in ancient China, the Chinese Buddhist monk-astronomers first followed the Chinese celestial system and wor- shiped Beidou as a supreme celestial monarch. Later on, Beidou as the celestial monarch in the Buddhist context was simply replaced by the newly created Buddha Tejaprabha. In the Fantian huoluojiuyao, a passage entitled "the Daoist Immortal Ge Hong'sQ [284-364] method of worshiping Beidou" ("Ge Xiangong li beidou faR"), teaches that all human beings, from rulers down to ordinary people, are controlled by the seven stars of Beidou. In order to avoid calamities they should al- ways obey and worship Beidou.29 The inclusion of the Daoist teaching in the Buddhist treatise on the Nine Luminaries was obviously an effort to organize the Nine Luminaries into a more disciplined hier- archy under Beidou according to the Daoist belief. The Daoist worship of Beidou can be traced fur- ther back to the Han dynasty (206 B.C.-A.D. 220). The Han astronomer Zhang Hengs (78-139) de- scribed a celestial system with Beidou occupying the central position: In the star-studded sky there are seven moving plan- ets: the sun, the ancestor of the Yang principle; the moon, the ancestor of the Yin principle; and the Five Planets, the essence of the Five Elements. With their forms born on the earth and essence completed in the heaven, the stars, though arranged unevenly, fall into their own proper positions.... Among them, there are 156</page><page sequence="11">five most divine and important groups, consisting of thirty-five units. The group in the center is called Bei- dou. In each of the four directions there are seven con- stellations forming the Twenty-eight Constellations. The Sun and Moon traverse the sky to foretell each of the good and bad omens. The Five Planets travel to presage misfortunes or fortunes.30 In this celestial system Beidou presides in the cen- ter-he is a supreme monarch controlling the Seven Planets and the Twenty-eight Constellations and in- fluencing the fate of men. The great historian Sima QianT (b. 145 B.c.?), in the astronomical chapter "Tianguan shu"U of his Shijiv (The Historical Rec- ord), speaks of Beidou as an emperor riding in a chariot: "Beidou is an emperor riding in a chariot. He traverses around the center to inspect and con- trol the four sides. The separation of the Yin and Yang, the establishment of the four seasons, the eve- ning of the Five Elements, the changes of the sea- sons, and the formation of the laws all depend upon Beidou." 3 Sima Qian's description of Beidou gives us a clue to the identification of an important stellar image of the Han dynasty. In a rubbing from the Wu Family Shrine in Shandong, a celestial monarch seated in a chariot formed by the seven individual stars of Bei- dou is greeted by five other figures (Figure 12). The monarch in the chariot is no doubt the personifica- tion of the constellation Beidou and the five wor- shipers may be the Five Planets. Among them, the one on the right riding on a horse coming toward the Beidou is reminiscent of the images of Saturn in later Buddhist paintings. In the Dunhuang Teja- prabha painting of 897 (Figure 1 1) Saturn leads a bull in front of the chariot. In a handscroll "The Five Planets and Twenty-eight Constellations," now in the Osaka Municipal Museum, Saturn rides a bull. The bull of Saturn in these later Chinese Bud- dhist paintings is probably a reincarnation of the Han horse. In a Han astronomical diagram exca- vated in a tomb at Mojuzi, Wuwei, in Gansu Prov- ince, Beidou is depicted in the center of heavens surrounded by the constellations (Figure 13). The Han presentations of Beidou are exactly the same as later Buddhist mandalas or diagrams of Teja- prabha. In Jinshuw, the official history of the Jin dynasty (265-420), Beidou is described as an emperor and also an imperial chariot: "Beidou has the form of a human emperor because he is the master who gives orders. He is also an imperial chariot which symbol- izes movement."32 - . '~lt,,i.x x(r",r dl' ~.'r -'. ^ -?,,~ . . . - - . i-' - &lt;_i- ?' ,-. ...' -/''6' - "??. ~ " . '-* * '-" .

During a year, the handle of Bei- dou points to different directions. In ancient China the seasons were decided by the direction of Bei- dou's handle at dusk. When the handle pointed to 157 I</page><page sequence="12">the east, it was spring; to the south, summer; to the west, autumn; and to the north, winter. Joseph Needham has aptly said: "For an agricultural econ- omy, astronomical knowledge as regulator of the calendar was of prime importance. He who could give a calendar to the people would be their leader."33 In ancient China agricultural activities were tied to the movement of Beidou, which was perhaps one of the most important reasons why Bei- dou was regarded as the supreme celestial monarch. The traditional Chinese concept of Beidou as a supreme celestial ruler was also shared by Buddhist monks. In an anonymous Tang Buddhist treatise, Beidou is worshiped as a celestial ruler: Beidou is the essence of the Sun, Moon, and the Five Planets. He controls the Seven Luminaries, illuminates the eight directions, enlightens the gods in heaven and governs men on the earth. He judges what is good and what is evil, and determines misfortune and fortune. All the stars pay homage to him, and all the souls pros- trate in worship before him.34 This Buddhist statement disregards the highest au- thority of the "three jewels" (triratna) of Bud- dhism-the Buddha, the Buddhist "Law" (dharma), and "the clergy" (saigha). There is no fundamental Buddhist concern for retribution (karma) or the lib- eration from the cycle of birth and rebirth (samsara). Instead, emphasis is given to the supreme power of the ruler, moral judgment, and obedience by the ruled; these views touch upon traditional Chinese thought. The Chinese Beidou worshiped by the Chinese Buddhist monks was entirely different from the image of the Indian Beidou introduced later. In the treatise Beidou qixing niansong iguix, trans- lated by the Indian monk Vajrabodhi (669-741), the Indian Beidou is not a supreme ruler but a group of eight female deities.35 In Indian Tantric religious pantheons, females (unless they are the sakti, or energy, of major male deities) have rela- tively low positions. The eight females are neither "Buddha-mothers" (fomw) nor "female bodhisatt- vas" (mu pusaz), who have important roles in the Tan- tric Buddhist pantheon. Like the other planets, they have the potential to cause trouble. But if a secret Incantation (dhdrani) of the Eight Stars taught by Sakyamuni Buddha is chanted, the eight females will protect the faithful and fulfill their wishes. The Indian concept of Beidou was totally differ- ent from the traditional Chinese belief. The solu- tion to this discrepancy seems to have been the cre- ation of Tejaprabha to replace the Chinese Beidou as the supreme celestial ruler and the adaptation of the female images of the Indian Beidou as some of Tejaprabha's attendants. The evidence for the replacement of the Chinese Beidou by Tejaprabha can be found in Buddhist texts such as the Fantian huoluo jiuyao.36 The re- placement is also evident in Buddhist art. A twelfth- century Japanese copy of a Chinese stellar mandala with a Buddha sitting in the center surrounded by stellar deities is inscribed not as the Mandala of Te- japrabha but as the Mandala of Beidou of the Tang Dynasty (Figure 14). Among the stellar deities above the Buddha in the picture is a group of seven small figures representing the seven individual stars of Beidou. As humble attendants, these figures are ob- viously based on the group of females of the Indian Beidou. While it is not organized around them, nor devoted to them, the mandala is called "The Man- dala of Beidou of the Tang." The only reasonable explanation for this discrepancy between the name and the structure of the mandala is that the proto- type for such mandalas was originally presided over by the Chinese Beidou, hence the name. After Te- japrabha became identified with the Chinese Bei- dou, the two were functionally interchangeable. Therefore, there was no need to change the original name of the mandala. In the Dunhuang painting Tejaprabha sits in a chariot like the Chinese Beidou in the Han rubbing, where his chariot symbolizes the movement of the constellation. However, Tejaprabha in the chariot is totally out of context here. Texts on Tejaprabha never mention or suggest his movement or travel. To make sense out of the irrelevantly inherited at- tribute, the chariot in most later Tejaprabha pic- tures is reduced to a wheel, which in Buddhist art is always read as the dharmacakra, the Wheel of the Law. The chariot was thus turned into a Buddhist attribute placed in the hands of Tejaprabha, sym- bolizing his teachings on preventing social and nat- ural disasters. Tejaprabha's special function as celestial control- ler against disasters must be the most important rea- son for pairing him with Bhaisajyaguru in the Lower Monastery murals. When the monastery was rebuilt after the earthquake in 1309, priority had to be given to the prevention of similar destructive forces, whether of social or cosmic origins. When the Assembly of Tejaprabha was paired with the Paradise of Bhaisajyaguru, Tejaprabha was evoked to guard against social and natural disasters; Bhai- sajyaguru, whose power was tripled by the presence of the two saviors Avalokitesvara and Cintamani- 158</page><page sequence="13">Figure 15. Zhu Haogu workshop, Paradise of Maitreya, mural from Xinghua Monastery, Shanxi. Yuan dynasty, 1320? Toronto, Royal Ontario Museum (photo: Royal Ontario Museum) cakra, was called upon to provide the strongest pro- tection from harm. As a date for the mural from the Guangsheng Lower Monastery, Aschwin Lippe suggested the sec- ond quarter of the fourteenth century based on three dates Laurence Sickman found, not in the Guangsheng Lower Monastery but in the temple for Mingying Wang, which lies southwest of the Lower Monastery. The three inscriptions on the wall paint- ings in the temple give the dates 1316 and 1324, and a stele commemorating the reconstruction of the temple is dated 1319. A more important date found in the Main Hall by some Chinese archaeologists in the early 195os, however, has been overlooked by scholars. An inscription dated autumn 1309 is writ- ten on the ridge purlin. Based on this date and the styles of the building, sculptures, and the fragments of the murals remaining on top of both gable walls, these Chinese archaeologists believed that the Main Hall was rebuilt in 13o9.37 The 1319 stele in the temple for Mingying Wang describes the rebuilt Guangsheng Si as "most magnificent and beautiful." Thus, by this date, the Guangsheng Lower Monas- tery had fully recovered from the earthquake. Ac- cordingly, the mural from the Main Hall can be more precisely dated between 1309 and 1319. The new evidence for this date enables us to study the style of the Museum's mural on firmer ground. It clarifies to some extent the stylistic relationship between the murals from the Main Hall and some related murals from the same area. These include the murals from the Front Hall of the Guangsheng Lower Monastery, now in Philadelphia; a Maitreya mural in the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto (Figure 15), originally from the XinghuaAA Monas- tery, which was situated nine miles south of the county seat of Jishan and about forty miles south- west of Pingyang;38 and the mural in the leading Daoist monastery, that of the QuanzhenAB Sect YongleAC Palace. Of these, only the murals from two halls of the Yongle Palace are dated: the Sanqing Hall murals of 1325 and the Chungyang Hall mu- rals of 1358. When the dates of the other murals are known, the stylistic relationships between these mu- rals will be clear. This should reveal not only the de- velopment of the mural style in southern Shanxi but will also shed light on some of the murals' icono- graphical problems, most of which have so far been misunderstood. It is beyond the scope of this essay to deal with further iconographical problems, but a brief discussion of the dates of the other undated murals is necessary before the direct stylistic source of the Metropolitan Museum's mural can be traced. The murals from the Front Hall of the Guang- sheng Lower Monastery, now in Philadelphia, are generally accepted as being contemporaneous with 159</page><page sequence="14">the murals of the Main Hall. Their style, however, is different from that of the Museum's mural. In the Philadelphia Bhaisajyaguru mural, for example, the color scheme is similar to that of the New York mu- ral-red and green are the basic colors, but larger areas of the bodies and garments are defined by outlines against white ground, which give the mural a much higher key. The face of the Buddha is not as full as that of the Metropolitan Museum's Bud- dha, and the two major bodhisattvas are placed lower than the Buddha in the picture plane. They are in three-quarter view with their heads and bod- ies turned toward the Buddha, thus forming a pyramidal spatial relationship. But in the Metropol- itan's mural the Buddha and the two major bodhis- attvas sit in strict frontal positions, more or less at the same level. The difference in spatial structure reflects the different dates of the murals. When Guangsheng Si was studied in the early 1950S new evidence for dating was found in the Front Hall. An inscription quoted by the investiga- tors states that the reconstruction of the Front Hall was completed in the eleventh year of the Cheng- huaAD reign (1475) of the Ming dynasty.39 Since the Philadelphia murals are from the Front Hall, it now seems clear that they should be dated after 1475. The date of the Toronto mural, the Paradise of Maitreya, has been disputed since 1938. Its clarifi- cation is particularly important for the stylistic study of the Museum's mural. The Toronto mural is pre- sumably from the North Hall of the northern com- pound of the Xinghua Monastery.40 After the mural (now in Toronto) had been removed, Li Jizhi of Qinghua University visited the monastery in 1926 and found an inscription on a wall.41 The published inscription indicates that a mural was completed on the fourteenth day of the eighth month of the cycli- cal year wuxuAE of the Great Yuan State (1271- 1368). Since the Chinese dating system is based on a cycle of sixty years, each cyclical name reoccurs every sixty years. However, mention of an imperial reign period or dynasty often provides further in- formation, as is the case of this inscription, which includes the term the "Great Yuan State." During the Great Yuan State the wuxu year occurred twice: the first corresponded to 1298 and the second to 1358. In 1938 William White commissioned two stu- dents to investigate the Xinghua Monastery. The students sent back a reading of an inscription that mentions that Zhu Haogu, a "painter-in-atten- dance" (huihua daizhaoAF) from XianglingAG county, and his pupil Zhang BoyuanAH completed their painting on the fourteenth day of the eighth month of the "qingshen"A year of the Great Yuan State.42 Since there is no such cyclical year as qingshen among the cyclical names, White assumed that the students' mistranscription and the date-paragraph given by Li was "obviously the same inscription"; he pub- lished it incorrectly as 1238, a year that falls outside the span of the Yuan dynasty.43 This mistake was corrected in an article published in 1947 by Ludwig Bachhofer, who pointed out that the wuxu year of the Great Yuan State in the inscrip- tion read by Li could not be 1238, because the term "Great Yuan State" was not in use until 1271.44 He discussed four possible readings of the students' version of the date, all of which fall before 1321, and proposes the year gengshenAJ, which corre- sponds to 1320.45 In a recent article Nancy Steinhardt refutes Lud- wig Bachhofer's date and interprets Li's reading of the year wuxu as 1358.46 According to her argument, two inscriptions, dated to the wuxu year 1358, on the walls of the Chunyang Hall of the Yongle Palace contain the signatures of Zhu Haogu. She argues that since the name of Zhu Haogu also appears in the Xinghua Monastery, the wuxu year in the Xinghua Monastery reported by Li must be the sec- ond of the two wuxu years of the Yuan dynasty, cor- responding to 1358 rather than 1298, because it is impossible for Zhu to have been a master craftsman working in the Xinghua Monastery in 1298 and to have still been active in the Yongle Palace in 1358. The name Zhu Haogu in the inscriptions of the Yongle Palace was not the signature of Zhu. The name was used to modify the two characters "men tu"AK (disciples) in the inscriptions, meaning "the disciples of Zhu Haogu." Zhu did not paint on the walls of the Yongle Palace, nor did he leave his sig- nature. Instead, his disciples were responsible for the murals. The inscriptions, therefore, do not seem to support the argument that Zhu was active as late as 1358. On the contrary, they tend to prove that Zhu painted in an earlier period, a generation ahead of his pupils. This would push Zhu's active date back to the early years of the fourteenth cen- tury. If the inscriptions reported by Li and by White's students are indeed two readings of the same in- scription and if Li's cyclical year of wuxu is correct, Zhu should have painted in the Xinghua Monastery in the earlier wuxu year of 1298 instead of 1358. If he did paint in the Xinghua Monastery in 1298, however, it is doubtful that his paintings and in- scription could have survived the earthquake of 1303, which destroyed Guangsheng Si nearby. 16o</page><page sequence="15">Therefore, Bachhofer's suggestion that the students may have meant gengshen, corresponding to 1320, is reasonable and does not conflict with the historical situation of the earthquake. If Zhu worked a gen- eration ahead of his pupils who painted in 1358, 1320 seems to be an appropriate time. In any case, the inscriptions from the Xinghu Monastery and the Yongle Palace provide important and reliable information: "a famous painter, Zhu Haogu, painted in the Xinghua Monastery in the early decades of the fourteenth century; he was not an ordinary craftsman working individually but a leading master who had established his lineage through a painting school." The information gath- ered from the inscriptions can be supplemented by the brief entry for Zhu in the Shanxi tongzhiAL (the Gazetteer of Shanxi): "Zhu Haogu was a native of Xiangling. He was good at landscape and fig- ure painting. Zhu and his countrymen Zhang MaoqingAM and Chang YunruiAN were known as fa- mous painters. People who obtain their paintings treasure them as jades. They were called 'The Three Painters of Xiangling.'" 47 What is now crucial for a more tangible knowl- edge of Zhu is whether the Toronto mural from the Xinghua Monastery dates back to the early decades of the fourteenth century when Zhu was painting there. If the mural is indeed an early-fourteenth- century work, it was undoubtedly painted by Zhu. However, since the locations of the inscription and mural in the Xinghua Monastery are by no means certain, the probable date of 1320 in the inscription does not automatically apply to the mural. The in- scription is reliable only for Zhu's active date in the Xinghua Monastery; it is not necessarily the date of the mural-only the style of the mural speaks elo- quently for its date. Therefore, the style of the To- ronto mural has to be examined to see if it agrees with the period style of the early fourteenth century. A comparison with the Metropolitan's mural, which can be firmly dated to the second decade of the cen- tury, will confirm its early date. The figure style of the Buddha in the Metropolitan Museum's mural (Figure 5) and the Toronto mural (Figure 15) is sim- ilar. It is characterized by the large exposed protu- berance (usnisa) at the top of the head; high, curving eyebrows; archlike eye sockets; almond eyes; thick nose; double chins; a few lines on the neck and the chest; and exposed chest and upper part of the stomach. The garment is wrapped around the fig- ure's left shoulder and arm and the right shoulder, with the right arm bare. The draperies on the trou- sers are indicated by parallel lines at equal intervals. In the Toronto mural the two major bodhisattvas sit with the Buddha in strictly frontal positions in a row within the shallow pictorial space of a friezelike horizontal band similar to their counterparts in the Metropolitan Museum's mural. They form a sharp contrast with the major bodhisattvas in the Philadel- phia murals, which were painted after 1475 (Figure 8). Candraprabha on the Buddha's right in the Phil- adelphia Bhaisajyaguru mural, for example, is de- picted not only in three-quarter view but also in a foreshortened position, as if he were to be seen from a higher vantage point. The foreshortening of the figure and its lower placement in the picture plane create a sense of volume and the illusion of three-dimensional space. The four immediate at- tendants around the Buddha in Toronto's mural, like their counterparts in the Metropolitan's mural, are almost superimposed one over another, creating the shallow pictorial space typical of the early four- teenth century. The Toronto and Metropolitan murals share a similar composition. The central Buddha is sur- rounded by four secondary figures and flanked by the two major bodhisattvas. The other minor figures are arranged on the sides of the central triad. The emphasis of the composition is on hierarchical or- der. The Toronto mural shares some major decora- tive motifs with the Metropolitan's mural, such as the haloed flower before the throne. In Buddhist art, while figural style was highly derivative owing to the use of standard texts and sketchbooks, the non-iconographical elements were always flexible. The artists could reproduce the shapes of figures through the use of cartoons and other devices, but they could not reproduce a sense of volume, spatial relationships, and pictorial spaces. The Toronto mural is similar in these aspects to the New York mural, which clearly shares all the major features of early-fourteenth-century style, of which Zhu Haogu was a leading master. The affinity between the Toronto and New York murals also shows that the direct stylistic source of the latter is in the painting tradition of Zhu Haogu. Although no literary evidence has survived to doc- ument Zhu's connection with the Main Hall of the Guangsheng Si, stylistic evidence links the Mu- seum's mural with Zhu's school. Zhu's rendering of the figure of Buddha is de- rived from late Liao (907-1125) and Jin (1115- 1234) Buddhist art as exemplified by a wood-block print of Tejaprabha (Figure 16), discovered in 1974 in a pagoda in Shanxi.48 The stylistic features in the murals-the facial and body shapes, the garment, 161</page><page sequence="16">Figure 16. Tejaprabha Buddha and the Planets. Yingxian, Shanxi. Late Liao or Early Jin dynasties. Woodblock print with colors on paper, 120 x 45.9 cm (from Chinese Graphic Art Annual [1982-1983] p. 253) the drapery on the trousers, the shallow space around the Buddha with superimposed attendants, and the color scheme with red and green as the ma- jor hues-can all be found in the late Liao or early Jin prints. The Zhu Haogu school, though dominant in southern Shanxi area, had limited influence else- where. Outside southern Shanxi, a new court style initiated by the Nepalese artist AnigeAO (1245-1306) prevailed. During the Yuan dynasty, Tibetan Bud- dhism became the most important religion prac- ticed at the Yuan court, where the Tibetan monks brought with them the style of the Himalayas to meet the needs of Tibetan Buddhist practices. Pro- moted at the court and patronized by the Yuan rul- ers, the court style swept throughout China from Dadu (modern Beijing) in the east to Dunhuang in the west, and from Zhejiang in the south to Mon- golia in the north. In the Wutai Mountains in neigh- boring northern Shanxi, Anige was busy building court-style temples and stupas for Yuan emperors. As a high-ranking official in charge of Yuan court art, Anige patronized a Buddhist temple in the Wutai Mountains during the last years of his life, and his new style might have reached the Guang- sheng Lower Monastery. As mentioned earlier, the Guangsheng Si had a close relationship with the Yuan court and possessed a portrait of Khubilai Khan. It is known that the prototype for the formal portrait of Khubilai Khan was painted by Anige after Khubilai's death in 1294, and it is likely that Buddhist paintings executed in the court style trav- eled to the Guangsheng Si together with the por- trait. However, Zhu's style was not influenced by the court style. The difference between Zhu's style and the court style can be seen through a comparison of the Mu- seum's Bhaisajyaguru mural and a Yuan woodblock print of Bhaisajyaguru designed in the court style by the Chinese artist Chen ShengAP (Figure 17).49 The subject of the print is Sakyamuni's teaching of the Paradise of Bhaisajyaguru, with the presence of the seven medical Buddhas in the air above, Sfiry- aprabha holding a sun disk on Sakyamuni's left, Candraprabha bearing a moon disk on the Bud- dha's right, and the Twelve Generals on both sides in the foreground. These figures are completely reinterpreted in the new court style, a style that syn- thesizes traditional Chinese Buddhist art and con- temporary Nepalese Buddhist art, which had ab- sorbed the late Pala-Sena schools of Indian art during the eleventh and twelfth centuries in Bihar and Bengal regions. The difference between the fig- ure styles of the Buddhas in the two pictures is par- ticularly striking. In the print the Buddha is ren- dered with a youthful face, elegant torso, clinging garment, and more esoteric teaching gesture. The elaborate throne is clustered with exotic Indian mythological creatures: two rearing simhavyalas (lionlike creatures) stand on the heads of two ele- phants and support a beam on which perch two makaras (quasi-crocodilian creatures), whose tails are 162</page><page sequence="17">turned into elaborate floral motifs connected by two snakes that are being swallowed by Garuda (a bird- like creature) on the top. Even the floral motifs be- hind the torso of the Buddha are carefully designed to recapture the flavor of the Nepalese style. While the new court style was prevalent else- where, in the southern Shanxi area the old style of Liao and Jin Buddhist art still survived. The Met- ropolitan Museum's mural and the other murals from the same area are among the few surviving witnesses to this heritage. Although the Zhu Haogu school revitalized the Liao and Jin Buddhist art tra- dition during the Yuan and early Ming periods, it remained a local school and represented one of the last waves in the succession of the Liao-Jin Buddhist art tradition.

Huntington of Ohio State University for advice on the Buddhist icono- graphical problems and Alfreda Murck of the Met- ropolitan Museum's Department of Asian Art for her valuable suggestions.

To these three at least three more can now be added: the mate of the Met- ropolitan Museum's mural now in Kansas City, the mate of the Philadelphia Bhaisajyaguru mural now in Philadelphia, and a woodblock print of the late Liao dynasty or early Jin dynasty dis- covered in 1974 in a pagoda in Shanxi (see Figure 16). 29.

Beidou qixing humo miyao yigui, in TSD, no. 1306, vol. 2 1, pp. 424c-425a. 35. TSD, no. 1307, vol. 21, pp. 423c-424b. 36. In the Fantian huoluo jiuao attributed to Ixing, the domi- nant stellar ruler is Beidou preached by the Daoist Ge Hong. But in the Beidou gixing humuo faAQ, a treatise attributed to Ixing on the worship of Beidou for the prevention of disasters, Beidou no longer has the dominant position. Attached to the end of the text are two subtitles: the "Beidou fa"AR (the method of Beidou) and the "Chishengguang yao fa"AS (the important method of Teja- prabha). The first subtitle "Beidou fa" is no doubt the last three words of "Ge Xiangong li beidou fa" adopted in Fantian huoluo jiuyao. Here not only the words "Ge Xiangong li" (the Daoist Im- mortal Ge Hong's worship) but the whole text under this subtitle has been deleted. This deleted section originally might have been the same Daoist text adopted in Fantian huoluo jiuyao. Under the second title is an independent passage about Tejaprabhabud- dhausnisadhaani, the Incantation of the Buddha Crown of Tejprabha. This passage is actually a condensed version of the Foshuo Chishengguang daweide xiaozai jixiang tuoluonijing translated by Bu Kong. As noted above, in Ixing's Xiuyao Igui, Tejaprabha appears as the name of one of the shrines; Ixing obviously had no knowledge of the Tejaprabha text. The deletion of the Daoist method of worship of Beidou and the addition of the Tejaprabha text to the treatise devoted to Beidou had to be an effort by the followers of Vajrabodhi and his student Amoghavajra to purify the text attributed to Ixing. In any case, it indicates the replace- ment of Beidou by the new Buddha Tejaprabha. In the Da sheng miaoJixiang pusa shuo chuzai jiaolingfalun, the text describing the mandala of Tejaprabha, this process of replacement has been completed. Beidou in this text is reduced to a much lower posi- tion than the Luminaries. 37. Qi Yingtao et al., "Liangnian lai Shanxisheng," p. 66. 164</page><page sequence="19">38.
