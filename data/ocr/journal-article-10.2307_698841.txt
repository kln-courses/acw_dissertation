<plain_text><page sequence="1">ROMAN RELIGION. Phases in the Religion of Ancient Rome. By CYRIL BAILEY. (Sather Classical Lectures, Vol. X.) Pp. ix + 340. Oxford: Clarendon Press (London: Milford). Cloth, 15s. THIs book is in the tradition of W. Warde Fowler and has more than a little in common with his Religious Experience of the Roman People, to which indeed it makes constant reference. It does not attempt to bring forward new facts, but rather to evaluate familiar material, especially with a view to setting forth the contribution made by ancient Rome to the religious develop- ment of mankind, the possibilities which its religion contained and the degree to which they developed or were frustrated, the foreign influences and the reasons for their introduction, and the extent to which Roman feeling survived the end of Roman power and of the ancient forms of cult. Wisely, after an introduction which sketches the residuum of purely magical elements in Roman cult and says eminently sensible and moderate things about the relation of magic to religion, the author goes on to give a good deal of space to the beliefs implied in the prac- tices he describes. Chapters II and IV treat respectively of animistic belief and anthropomorphism, while III and V handle the worship of the vaguer numina and the state cult of the gods from the earliest nouensides to full-blown emperor-worship. Having drawn at- tention to the unsatisfying nature of all this for the developed religious con- sciousness as it existed in the Graeco- Roman world, he continues with two more chapters, VI, on the oriental cults, appealing to 'emotion and mysticism,' and VII, on Epicurean and Stoic philosophy. A final chapter tells the story of the mixture of' syncretism and superstition' which marks the last phase before the final triumph of Chris- tianity. That no originality can be claimed for this is clear, nor was it the author's intention to be original. What he does is so to handle his subject as to put it in the most adequate light for a modern reader rather interested than erudite, in fact for an audience of cultured non- specialists such as no doubt listened to and profited by the lectures when de- livered in California. But a specialist may well linger over the remarks on the Lares, for example, which are perhaps the best and most convincing statement of the case against the theory that they are ghosts (p. 102 sqq.). The treatment of Caesar-worship is good throughout, and not least in the remark (p. 143) that 'had there not been other forces at work, the Rome of the Empire might well have lost all hold on religion as anything else than the exaltation of the Roman State.' A very good point is made when he insists (p. 173 and else- where) on the part played in the intro- duction of foreign cults by the desire of the people to have some personal share, other than merely looking on, in wor- ship. That the treatment of Epi- cureanism is good and shows profound study of the spirit, not merely the facts, of that philosophy, particularly as set forth by Lucretius, goes without saying. It is however unfortunate that the material on which Mr. Bailey works was not brought up to date, at all events to the extent of taking notice of the latest researches, however pro- foundly he may disagree with their results. The notes at the end of the book make incidental mention of a work published in 1931, Professor Gordon Laing's Survival of Roman Religion. That being so, one is suprised to find, on p. 39, the old Miillerian view of the</page><page sequence="2">22 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW mundus with the lapis manalis as its cover, and the additional statement that it was a 'round pit on the Pala- tine' when Weinstock'srefutation of this ingenious construction appeared in 1930 (R6m. Mitt. xlv, III sqq.) and the article Mundus in Platner-Ashby in 1929. That the name of Saturnus is 'certainly connected with the root of serere ' (p. 55) is not a statement that can be made with confidence since the ap- pearance of a number of discussions, the latest of which (Altheim, Griechische Gdtter im alten Rom, p. 8) appeared in 1930. In speaking of Quirinus (p. 69), Kretschmer's etymology should be men- tioned; neither the di indigetes nor luturna (pp. 115, 119) ought to have been spoken of with no hint of Altheim's views concerning them, either in text or notes. The explanation of macte esto on p. 84 needs a little revision, to avoid assuming a rare construction confined to Imperial poetry for early Republican or pre-Republican Latin. There has been much work done on the great Paris magical papyrus since Dieterich pub- lished Eine Mithrasliturgie, therefore at least the note to p. 249 should mention that his theory is scarcely to be taken seriously and that Preisendanz' collec- tion now contains the latest text. There can be, and is, despite p. 155, very serious doubt that flamnen (masc.) has anything to do with flare, and, I should say, still more that immunis in Hor. C. iii, 23, 17 means 'pure,' or mox ever 'soon' (pp. 77, 81). When a second edition is called for, as it should be, it is to be hoped that these little defects will have been got rid of, together with a few small slips on points of non-controversial detail and one rather glaring misprint, a wrong running title on p. 247.
