<plain_text><page sequence="1">FLUID WORLDS 329 David Field Fluid Worlds: Lem's Solartis and Nabokov's Ada Stanislaw Lem and Vladimir Nabokov, having spent much of their professional lives studying science as well as writing novels, both acknowl- edge that science and art share important features: without its imaginative component, science would lose the driving force of creative observation and theory, and without a subtle and precise sense of external reality, art would become abstract, detached, and even insane. Lem's and Nabokov's great works, Solaris and Ada, explore the implications of the fluid boundaries between science and art-in a larger sense, between imagination and reality. Both books show that theoretical issues concerning the nature of knowledge have an abiding influence on their characters' lives because the extremes that can distort science and art can also prevent characters from sharing love. And the same sense of dynamic, tension-filled balance that raises art and science to the highest levels of human achievement also allows characters to deal with the fluid world and find love. Lem and Nabokov write out of a deep awareness of the findings of mod- ern science, which is sensitive to the many ways that imagination influences all observations. Even the hardest of sciences has emphasized the role that imagination plays in the barest examination of external nature. According to Werner Heisenberg (p. 446), "the atomic physicist has had to resign himself to the fact that his science is but a link in the infinite chain of man's argument with nature and that it cannot simply speak of 'nature in itself."' Stephen Jay Gould echoes Heisenberg when he claims that "facts do not 'speak for them- selves"' and goes on to say that science is human, imaginative, "not a mech- anized, robotlike accumulation of objective information" (Gould: 161-62). Scientists do not merely study a world exterior to themselves; they imagina- tively participate in the investigation, creatively exploring the farthest reaches of the universe and penetrating the most minute sub-atomic particles. We cannot know nature as a fully separate entity because it exists only insofar as the human imagination can interpret it: we are, in fact, a part of all that we see. The imaginative component of science means that nature-in a fundamental sense-remains unknowable because aspects of the human observer's personality affect whatever that observer examines. If Feyerabend and other contemporary students of science are correct, scientists' cultural and social biases determine, to a large extent, what they see. Nature becomes a projection of scientists' conscious and unconscious minds. The result is a paradox: our imaginations simultaneously connect us to the universe and</page><page sequence="2">330 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 13 (1986) isolate us from that universe. We are a part of all that we know, but that very connection limits our ability to know anything but ourselves. Nabokov and Lem, both dedicated students of modem science, agree that science cannot discover iron-clad truths that endure forever as immuta- ble laws. Nabokov expresses the fluid nature of truth in "Ultima Thule," a chapter from an unfinished novel, where one of his characters questions the permanence of scientific theories: When a hypothesis enters a scientist's mind, he checks it by calculation and experiment, that is, by the mimicry and the pantomime of truth. Its plausi- bility infects others, and the hypothesis is accepted as the true explanation for the given phenomenon, until someone finds its faults. I believe the whole of science consists of such exiled or retired ideas: and yet at one time each of them boasted high rank; now only a name or a pension is left. (A Russian Beauty and Other Stories, p. 169) Lem also acknowledges the highly imaginative nature of science, recognizing that the drastic modification of scientific theories can make yes- terday's magical fantasy the established belief of today: "From the viewpoint of 19th-century physics, the 'flavors' of elementary particles or the 'magical number' of atomic physics or qualities such as 'strangeness,' etc. are sheer fantasy" (see above, p. 245). Lem sees science merging into fiction as it interprets "facts" at the edges of theoretical boundaries where theories can no longer explain those facts. Furthermore, the influence of imagination on all description is a matter that he takes up in "Metafantasia," where he recog- nizes that "Language, the instrument of description, is also the creator of what it describes" (p. 62). Nabokov's own work as a lepidopterist led him to ever greater skepti- cism about the possibility of scientific Truth. "Reality," he says, "is a very subjective affair": "you can get nearer and nearer, so to speak, to reality; but you can never get near enough because reality is an infinite succession of steps, levels of perception, false bottoms, and hence unquenchable, unattainable." A specialist can penetrate deeply into the "reality" of a natural object, but that specialist can never attain perfect knowledge: "You can know more and more about one thing but you can never know everything about one thing: it's hopeless. So that we live surrounded by more or less ghostly objects" (Strong Opinions, p. 1 8). Science thus resembles poetry because both involve imaginative crea- tions and deal with elusive and dynamic reality. Nabokov, as a dedicated lep- idopterist, avidly followed scientific debates-even if he remained skeptical of certain ideas in the mainstream of scientific theory-and he repeatedly emphasized the point of tangency between poetry (in the largest sense) and science. In his classes at Cornell, for example, he reversed the traditional way of seeing a dichotomy between art and science when he referred to "the passion of the scientist and the precision of the artist" (Wetzsteon: 242). Lem also recognizes the importance of science for his art and even gives promi- nence to the science in his fiction: "If you were to exclude from my books everything they owe to the application of concepts of biological evolution, there would be little left" ("The Profession of Science Fiction," p. 45).</page><page sequence="3">FLUID WORLDS 331 Science has a great deal in common with literary art, and several famous scientists have joined Nabokov and Lem in recognizing the convergence of poetry and science. According to Peter Medawar, for instance, All advances of scientific understanding, at every level, begin with a specu- lative adventure, an imaginative preconception of what might be true-a preconception that always, and necessarily, goes a little way (sometimes a long way) beyond anything which we have logical or factual authority to believe in. It is the invention of a possible world, or of a tiny fraction of that world. (Medawar: 46; emphasis in original) Edward 0. Wilson, writing in Biophilia, makes a similar point: "Scientific innovation sometimes sounds like poetry, and I would claim that it is, at least in the early stages." He goes on to add that "[t]he two vocations draw from the same subconscious wellsprings and depend upon similar primal stories and images.... [T]he essence of art, no less than of science, is synechdoche" (pp. 62-63). We should hardly be surprised, then, that science has had an important influence on contemporary literature. Katherine Hayles has documented this effect in her detailed account of the contemporary "revolution in world view" which has transformed literature and other fields in the 20th century. Accord- ing to Hayles, the characteristic metaphors of "a dance, a network, a field" recur in most efforts to explain the new world-view: "the phrases imply a reality that has no detachable parts, indeed no enduring, unchanging parts at all" and, "[a]s the 'dance' metaphor implies, its harmonious rhythmic pat- terns of motion include the observer as an integral participant." This contem- porary view of nature is distinguished by "its fluid, dynamic nature, the inclusion of the observer, the absence of detachable parts, and the mutuality of component interactions" (Hayles: 15). In postmodern literature, fluidity and incest stand as central images for this simultaneous interconnectedness of all things and the self-referential nature of the quest for knowledge. A fluid world is one whose boundaries constantly shift-we cannot determine precisely where one object ends and the next begins, and this fluidity connects all human observers to each other and the natural world. A corollary image is that of incest, which associates the fluid interconnections of this world-view with the attempt to find love. But incest can represent a distortion, a pushing to extremes of the power of imagination because incestuous love can turn into narcissistic self- absorption. The more perfect the union-the more the incestuous lovers resemble each other-the more closely the lovers approach solipsism: they become mirror images of themselves. But incest need not represent narcis- sism, for it can portray the incestuous connections between science and art, the interpenetrations of reality and imagination-in short, the problematical nature of the imagination in modern science. Yet that problematical nature of imagination is not the whole story; for science-and, according to Nabokov and Lem, art-must also conform to a "reality" principle, even if reality needs quotation marks. Nabokov says that "[a] creative writer must... possess the inborn capacity not only of recombining but of re-creating the given world." To accomplish this task,</page><page sequence="4">332 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 13 (1986) "the artist should know the given world." Unless the artist is also a careful observer of the natural world, her or his imagination may lose its tether to reality: "Imagination without knowledge leads no farther than the back yard of primitive art, the child's scrawl on the fence, and the crank's message in the market place" (Strong Opinions, p. 32). Lem agrees, claiming that "an encyclopedic knowledge of science is as necessary for the sf writer as the exhaustive knowledge of living conditions his heroes must experience (up to and including the retail prices of specific goods) is for the author of a realistic novel" ("The Profession of Science," p. 45). For Nabokov and Lem, the ideal art combines imagination with careful scrutiny of reality. Nabokov asks, "Does there not exist a high ridge where the mountainside of 'scientific' knowledge joins the opposite slope of 'artis- tic' imagination?" (Strong Opinions, p. 330). Lem expresses a similar idea when he says, "you would be quite mistaken if you believed, for example, that the classical fairy tale has only its autonomous inner meanings and no relationship with the real world. If the real world did not exist fairy tales would have no meaning" (Microworlds, pp. 32-33). Scientists also call attention to the importance of the real world even when they discuss the poetic aspects of science. After the scientist has imagi- natively created a theory, according to Medawar, the conjecture is then exposed to criticism to find out whether or not that imagined world is anything like the real one. Scientific reasoning is therefore at all levels an interaction between two episodes of thought-a dialogue between two voices, the one imaginative and the other critical; a dialogue, as I have put it, between the possible and the actual, between pro- posal and disposal, conjecture and criticism, between what might be true and what is in fact the case. (Medawar: 46) Edward 0. Wilson says much the same thing (p. 67): "Through the repeated alternation between flights of the imagination and the accretion of hard data, a mutual agreement of the workings of the world is written, in the form of natural law." In short, the scientist imaginatively spins elegant theories which hold a chaotic collection of disparate facts together in a cosmic web. But the scientist then applies rigorous and repeatable tests to those theories to hold them accountable to observable phenomena-the "actual," the "hard data" that comprise the "facts" of the world. Poetry also depends on observable phenomena because the poet- according to Nabokov and Lem-creates a web of words by focussing on details, concrete images that will activate the reader's brain cells. Lem says that "[l]iterary games...are played with 'natural language' which always has meanings oriented toward real objects" (Microworlds, p. 32). The poet's precise images, taken from the observable world, will work in a unique way only if readers share elements of that world-otherwise, the poet and reader will remain forever isolated in solipsistic and parallel universes. Science depends upon the imagination, but poetry depends upon a shared world of "reality," even if that complex concept must always have quotation marks around it.</page><page sequence="5">FLUID WORLDS 333 Although both Lem and Nabokov deal with the problems of imaginative interconnectedness and isolation in their interviews and essays, their novels Solaris and Ada represent their most explicit treatment of these themes because both books take place on imaginary planets composed primarily of mysterious fluids, and both books present love affairs in which the lovers seem somehow simultaneously separate and connected, part of each other and isolated from each other. Lem's fluid world, the planet Solaris, is "a sort of gigantic entity, a fluid cell, unique and monstrous," consisting of an ocean that Kris Kelvin, the narrator, tells us "was essentially a test of ourselves, of the limitations of human knowledge" (2:30). The ocean itself tests human knowledge because it reacts to outside phenomena: it seems capable of changing the planet's orbit to avoid ultimately getting engulfed by one of its two suns (2:22), and it reacts to all attempts to discover its reality by "remodelling" the "specially designed electronic apparatus" used to study it. It also "modifie[s] certain elements in the submerged instruments, as a result of which the normal dis- charge frequency was completely disrupted and the recording instruments registered a profusion of signals-fragmentary indications of some outland- ish activity, which in fact defeated all attempts at analysis" (2:27). We can see how any interpretation of this complex, fluid, and seemingly sentient ocean must be tentative, incomplete, and inaccurate. The entire planet seems like a gigantic metaphor to represent Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle. Furthermore, because we get all our information through Kelvin, we cannot "know" "the truth" about Solaris; indeed, Kelvin presents so many differing theories that we could probably gather several generations of experts and be no nearer the so-called "truth." In Nabokov's Ada, the action also takes place on another planet- Antiterra-but since the narrators and all the main actors are Antiterrans, we get our information from an alien perspective. Van and Ada Veen, suppos- edly cousins but in fact brother and sister, are the main characters and princi- pal narrators of Ada, telling the story of Antiterra, a sibling planet to Terra, a distorted version of our Earth, where water takes on an even more important role than here. On Antiterra, electricity is banned so that hydraulic power must replace it: Antiterrans communicate with "dorophones," the "dor" a corruption of "hydro" (I, 42:309). As Van recognizes, "Furnished space, l'espace meuble' (known to us only as furnished and full even if its contents be 'absence of substance'-which seats the mind, too) is mostly watery so far as this globe is concerned" (III, 7:504). Van also associates water with intellectual endeavors explicitly when he acknowledges that Ada "at any time, if she picked up a book, would at once get engrossed in whatever text she happened to slip into 'from the book's brink' with the natural movement of a water creature put back into its brook" (I, 33:208). Sometimes that intellectual fluidity contains terror or threats. Van remembers his feelings when composing his early books and recounts that, "[a]fter work I battled against the might of the mind-set: the stream of com- position, the force of the phrase demanding to be formed could not be stopped for hours of darkness and discomfort..." (II, 4:360). Van thus regards writing as a fluid endeavor, and "the stream of composition" empha-</page><page sequence="6">334 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 13 (1986) sizes the flow of his ideas onto the page, the fluid connection between his ideas and their verbal expression. "When some result had been achieved," Van tried to avoid thinking of Ada because "that would mean drowning in a cataract of worse wakefulness"-indeed the fluid connection of his life with Ada's means that her image casts him into a waterfall, at once a source of energy and wakeful alertness but also chaos and terror. When Van and Ada's half sister, Lucette, commits suicide by diving from a luxury liner into the "black, foam-veined, complicated waters" (III, 5:495), she enters the com- plexity of that world of interconnections and fluidity. The phrase "foam- veined" associates the seas with the waters inside us, that complex fluid world "which seats the mind." But there is a further and even deeper complexity to the fluidity of Antiterra and the life of the mind. On Antiterra, the only ones to infer the existence of Terran life are the insane: normal, reasonable Antiterrans "rejected Terra as a fad or a fantom, and deranged minds (ready to plunge into any abyss) accepted it in support and token of their own irrationality" (I, 3:18). Sane, rational Antiterrans hold their imaginations in such control that they cannot consider the reality of Terra, yet from our perspective as Terran readers we know that it does exist: we see a vivid proof of the limitations of a rationality that refuses to use the power of imagination to intuit other worlds. Van's aunt Aqua (as her name indicates) represents fluidity and illustrates both the insanity and the insight of a powerful imagination. If the ocean of Solaris shows how fluidity can take the forms of its observers' imaginings, the water on Antiterra fulfills the same role for Aqua: She developed a morbid sensitivity to the language of tap water-which ech- oes sometimes (much as the bloodstream does predormitarily) a fragment of human speech lingering in one's ears while one washes one's hands after cocktails with strangers.... Soon, however, the rhythmically perfect, but ver- bally rather blurred volubility of faucets began to acquire too much pertinent sense. The purity of the running water's enunciation grew in proportion to the nuisance it made of itself. (I, 3:23) Soon "man-made objects" begin to send her messages: she thinks that "clothes hangers were really the shoulders of decapitated Tellurians" and believes that "the folds of a blanket she had kicked off her bed looked back at her mournfully with a stye on one drooping eyelid and dreary reproof in the limp twist of a livid lip" (I, 3:24). In short, Aqua is insane: she sees faces in the random placement of items in her room, and she hears messages in the random dripping of water. She projects aspects of her own personality-especially her greatest loves and fears-onto the external world, and cannot tell where her own imagination ends and the world begins. As we will see, her insanity also resembles the efforts of -the scientists on Solaris to discover if the fluid world contains meaning. In their case, they actually project human meaning onto the non- human world; they thus see the ocean that they are trying to understand in their-anthropomorphic-terms and not in Solaris's. If Aqua resembles the self-deceiving scientists, her perceptions seem paradoxically validated because her very insanity allows her to infer the</page><page sequence="7">FLUID WORLDS 335 existence of Terra, another world which we Terran readers know. Aqua envisages "a future America of alabaster buildings one hundred stories high, resembling a beautiful furniture store crammed with tall white-washed ward- robes and shorter fridges." But this America is more than a fancy department store; she also sees "giant flying sharks with lateral eyes taking barely one night to carry pilgrims through black ether across an entire continent from dark to shining sea." And she hears "magic-music boxes talking and singing, drowning the terror of thought..." (I, 3:21). The entire world of Terra, in her vision, seems under water as airplanes become sharks flying through the air and music becomes water drowning thought. In addition, she imagines how electricity, "[t]he unmentionable magnetic power denounced by evil law- makers" on Antiterra "was used on Terra as freely as water and air." As Terrans, we can recognize how her imagination both sees and distorts our so-called reality: she sees images, metaphors for our reality, and these figures of speech catch the spirit of our planet because Aqua emphasizes the watery images of another fluid world. On Solaris, the analogue to Aqua is the scientist explorer Berton, who sees strange phenomena after a colleague, Fechner, is lost over-or in-the mysterious ocean. After Berton returns from his mission searching for Fechner, a panel of level-headed scientists questions him. One aspect of his report to the panel indicates that the ocean figuratively represents the way that the imagination functions. Just as human observers send out imaginative tendrils to the farthest reaches of the universe, so the ocean sends out mate- rial tentacles to the world above it. Berton says, I could see distinctly to a depth of several yards. I saw a sort of yellow sludge which was sprouting vertical filaments. When these filaments emerged above the surface, they had a glassy sheen. Then they began to exude foam-they frothed-until the foam solidified; it was like a very thick treacle. These glutinous filaments merged and became intertwined. (6:88) Berton thus presents a parable about the way that we interpret the world, sending out our imaginative filaments, intertwining them with what seems to be external reality but turns out to be only another projection of our own personalities. The scientists on the panel remain alert to Berton's possible distortions; Berton, however, guilelessly goes on to relate the most remarkable thing that he saw, "a pale almost white object floating on the surface." At first he thinks that it is Fechner's flying suit because "it looked vaguely human in form." As he brings the aircraft closer, he recognizes that "the shape, the body, was moving; sometimes it seemed to be standing upright in the trough of the waves." He descends to the ocean and observes, "The body-yes, it was a human body, not an atmosphere suit-the body was moving" (6:90). Berton soon sees the shape as that of a child, but he also recognizes that he isn't seeing a normal child: "this child was extraordinarily large. Enormous, in fact. Stretched out horizontally, its body rose twelve feet above the surface of the ocean, I swear." Berton notices the baby's strange, mechanical move- ments and tells the examining panel: "It was as though someone else was responsible for the gestures" (6:91).</page><page sequence="8">336 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 13 (1986) The panelists discount Berton's testimony for this sighting as being unreliable: in effect, they liken him to Aqua projecting anthropomorphic ideas onto the liquid forms of the ocean. The board's skepticism about the value of imagination prevents them from seeing that the figures are real and hampers their ability to develop new theories about the nature of the ocean. They try to be polite and soften the blow by saying, "It was a symptom of poisoning," to which Berton replies, "It wasn't an hallucination. An halluci- nation is created by one's own brain, wouldn't you say?" (6:93). He refuses to give up his conviction of the sea's forms as external reality: "my brain couldn't have created what I saw. I'll never believe that. My brain wouldn't have been capable of it" (6:94). Berton therefore rejects the notion that he has looked at the fluid world and imposed his own pattern on it; what he saw was real-he doesn't recognize that the figures could simultaneously be real and imaginative projections. The board rejects his testimony after "due consideration," reaching the conclusion that "Berton's report is symptomatic of hallucinations caused by atmospheric poisoning, consequent upon inflammation of the associative zone of the cerebral cortex, and that Berton's account bears no, or at any rate no appreciable, relation to reality" (6:94). Notice the similarities with Aqua's vision: to rational, detached and level-headed observers, both Aqua and Berton seem crazy: Aqua is permanently insane, Berton is temporarily rend- ered insane by the presumed poisoning, and both seem to look out at the world and see projections of their own imaginations; yet both supply what should be important information for science. Berton, in a comic response, asks "what does 'no appreciable relation' mean? In what proportion is reality appreciable or not?" Comic or not, this turns out to be a good question; for as Kelvin, Snow, Sartorius, and we ourselves learn, Solaris is capable of throwing up images from the memories of scientists. The one dissenting member of the panel, Dr Messenger, comes up with what seems wildly irrational at the time but turns out to be the most likely hypothesis: I imagine that what Berton saw was one of the phases of a kind of 'Opera- tion Man' which this viscous monster was engaged in. The source of all the various forms observed by Berton is Fechner-or rather, Fechner's brain, subjected to an unimaginable 'psychic dissection' for the purposes of a sort of re-creation, and experimental reconstruction, based on impressions (undoubtedly the most durable ones) engraved on his memory. (6:97) If Messenger's hypothesis is correct, then Berton can see more than the sane, detached observers can. Any scientific understanding of Solaris must begin with observations, even if those observations seem fanciful, so the panelists' rationality leads them to reject essential information. Here Lem also develops the idea that however tentative any notion of "reality" might be, there are hypotheses which more nearly approximate nature's truths than others. Messenger comes closer to understanding Solaris than either the panelists or Berton when he takes Berton's information and interprets it. Because he develops a hypothesis that explains how the ocean or Solaris (since "the ocean" and "Solaris" are co-extensive) may work, his</page><page sequence="9">FLUID WORLDS 337 hypothesis is more satisfying than either the panel's empty rationality or Berton's raw data. And Kelvin's perspective-however tentative, particular, and warped that perspective might be-confirms Messenger's hypothesis. Snow and Sar- torius agree with his understanding of what is going on-there is an inde- pendent confirmation, apparently outside Kelvin's own mind. According to Snow's and Sartorius' theories, the sentient ocean can delve into the scien- tists' unconscious minds and precipitate out their deepest loves and fears. The concrete forms of these memories are called Phi creatures, and they haunt the scientists. Sartorius tells Kelvin: I put it to you as follows: what are the Phi creatures? They are not autono- mous individuals, nor copies of actual persons. They are merely projections materializing from our brains, based on a given individual.... The origin of the materialization lies in the most durable imprints of our memory, those which are especially well-defined, but no single imprint can be completely isolated, and in the course of the reproduction, fragments of related imprints are absorbed. Thus the new arrival sometimes reveals a more extensive knowledge than that of the individual of whom it is a copy. (7:112) If Sartorius is right, if Kelvin in fact sees the creature Rheya, who is a concrete form of his memory, if the other Phi creatures exist, then Berton could well have seen a precipitation of Fechner's memory, or of his own memory. And that is the key, the revelation that comes to explorers of Solaris. Because the sentient ocean can probe the probers' brains and find there deep memories that they have forgotten, hidden from themselves, or ignored, the ocean reveals that, however carefully they try to study the uni- verse, the scientists cannot hope to understand the outside world unless they first understand what is inside their own minds. The rational scientists thus face a problem opposite to that of Aqua, whose unconscious bursts forth in spectacular visions. Though cut off from external reality, Aqua is closer to the perception of another, deeper, kind of reality than the rationalists are. Yet that other kind of reality seems less a matter of judging what the sentient ocean is "really" like or figuring out the exact location of streets on Terra's Manhattan than of probing the human heart. Van and Ada are less concerned with Terra as "another world" than with "the Real World in us and beyond us" (I, 3:20). In the worlds of Ada and Solaris, a deep reality lies within the characters, and unless they can know that reality, they cut them- selves off from any reality beyond. As Kelvin says, "Man has gone out to explore other worlds and other civilizations without having explored his own labyrinth of dark passages and secret chambers, and without finding what lies behind doorways that he himself has sealed" (10:165). Kelvin's "labyrinth of dark passages and secret chambers" involves another person who is simultaneously part of himself and different, for he confronts a replica of his former lover, Rheya, who committed suicide when he couldn't provide her with the solace she needed. Kelvin thinks he under- stands the artificial nature of the replicant who looks and acts like Rheya, and he even destroys her first manifestation. Since he knows that she is not the "real" Rheya, he can eliminate this artificial creature without qualms. But</page><page sequence="10">338 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 13 (1986) when she returns, he forgets her artificial nature because the impact of her tangible presence overwhelms his intellect. He falls more and more in love with the image of his former lover. This presence of a concrete form of his memory serves as another para- ble for the interpretation of reality that we have been discussing. Kelvin's love for the phi-creature Rheya is metaphorically incestuous because she is a version of what is in Kelvin's mind; she is not separate from him. As he tries to embrace someone outside of himself, he is merely embracing an aspect of his own mind. The boundaries distinguishing "inside" and "outside" break down: what was inside becomes outside, yet what is outside seems a part of the mind's interior. Rheya is, with the sentient ocean's help, a precipitate of Kelvin's imagination. As he reaches out-most desperately-to embrace someone outside himself, he finds himself most alone. Yet Kelvin recognizes the deep emotional reality of his feelings for Rheya's reincarnation, saying "My body recognized her body; my body desired her, my body was attracted towards hers beyond reason, beyond thought, beyond fear" (5:67). Obviously, there are times when Kelvin merely wants to keep Rheya near him to stall for time, to think about how he should act. Nevertheless, he also changes during the course of the action and comes to recognize that: If an elephant is not a giant microbe, the ocean is not a giant brain. Obvi- ously there can be various approaches, and the consequence of one of them is that you are here, now, with me. And I am trying my hardest to make you realize that I love you. Just your being here cancels out the twelve years of my life that went into the study of Solaris, and I want to keep you. (9:153) When Snow tells Kelvin of a technique that can eliminate the Phi creatures, Kelvin replies, "I love this girl." Snow asks, "Her memory, you mean?" "No," Kelvin answers, "herself" (10:161). Kelvin loves the imaginative pre- cipitate of Rheya as if she were real. Because this Rheya is merely Kelvin's projection, however, their love is doomed to an incestuous solipsism: this Rheya is not a separate person but Kelvin's imaginative version of a separate person. Kelvin can hope, at most, to recognize better what lies within his imagination: he can never have the "real" Rheya again. Her origin deep in Kelvin's conscious and unconscious imagination means that the phi-creature Rheya is, in part, a precipitate of Kelvin's dream- life. Dreams, a key feature of the mental world, provide another way for Kelvin to probe his mind's depths and reach normally inaccessible areas of his imagination. Furthermore, given the problematical nature of external reality in Solaris and Ada, dream-life in those works frequently merges with "real" life. Sometimes the characters have grave difficulties telling whether they are awake or dreaming, so that dream life seems much more vivid and real than their so-called "real" life. For example, Kelvin, because he first meets Rheya as he awakens, is sure that he sees her in his dream, that he is really still asleep. When he "reo- pened [his] eyes with the impression of having dozed off for only a few minutes," he sees Rheya: "My first thought was reassuring: I was dreaming and I was aware that I was dreaming" (5:60). Seeing her disturbs him</page><page sequence="11">FLUID WORLDS 339 because her presence reminds him of his guilt-he feels responsible for her suicide ten years before, when he left her despite her threats to kill herself. He wants her appearance to remain limited to the dream world, where she can be safely contained. Nevertheless, he continues to talk with Rheya and doesn't wake up. As he recognizes that the dream has the consistency and tangibility of real life, he tells himself that "I should have to endure this dream to the bitter end" (5:62). Finally, he punctures the inside of his thigh with a sharp object, feels intense pain and watches his blood drip to the floor: "I no longer told myself: 'it's a dream.' I had ceased to believe that. Now I was thinking: 'I must be ready to defend myself"' (5:65). He must defend himself from the bitter memories, the pain that he associates with Rheya. He can no longer confine those memories to his unconscious so that they will only emerge when he is asleep-when he is, in a sense, anesthetized to prevent his remembering the anguish when he awakens. This scene sets up the problem that Kelvin must face. He at first reas- sures himself that he is merely dreaming and believes that his worst fears exist only in his mind. He puts himself at ease with the belief that he can wake up to a comforting reality where his guilt is no longer tangible. Yet he wakes up into a world where his dreams are tangible, where the sentient ocean precipitates out his worst guilt as the physical embodiment of Rheya. He wakes into a nightmare, yet that nightmare also represents the fulfillment of his deepest wishes because it reincamates Rheya. In a sense, then, the "reality" of life on Solaris is a dream. There is nevertheless a deep truth in Rheya's existence as a person because-as we have seen-she embodies a truth for Kelvin, and he grows to understand that the dream-life which spawned her is a means to the deepest reality: "when I wake up," Kelvin says, "I have the impression that I have just left a state of true perception" (12:187). That boundary between reality and dream breaks down because Kelvin's imagination becomes the most genuine thing he knows even as it invades the landscape: "reality" becomes so charged that only a dream can see what is really there. Kelvin's dream-life connects him to the universe because, when dreaming, Kelvin feels himself "dispersed in all directions" (12:188)-as his imagination figuratively invades the landscape. Yet the landscape on Solaris also invades him: he has "visionless dreams" in which "I felt myself being slowly and minutely explored, although no instrument or hand touched me." The feeling intensifies to the point where "I felt myself being invaded through and through, I crumbled, disintegrated, and only emptiness remained" (12:188). The world on Solaris is so interconnected that all boundaries between the inner and outer world become fluid, yet Kelvin is sunk in deep solitude. Kelvin has another dream which is parallel to his first sight of Rheya's reincarnation. He hears Gibarian, who asks, "Oh, you think you're dreaming about me? As you did with Rheya?" (9:141). Kelvin thinks he understands what's happening and says, "You are not Gibarian," to which the disembod- ied voice responds, "No? then who am I? A dream?" Kelvin answers, "No, you are only a puppet. But you don't realize who you are." The voice once</page><page sequence="12">340 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 13 (1986) again responds with a question: "And how do you know who you are?" (9:142). Gibarian's insight seems accurate when Kelvin thinks he wakes up from his nightmare yet continues to hear the voice droning on, telling him that "any attempt to understand the motivation of these occurrences is blocked by our own anthropomorphism" (9:142). And then Kelvin recog- nizes that he has waked into another dream. Now, however, he acknowl- edges to Rheya that Gibarian "can be alive in a dream." Gibarian's genuine insight is that the Solarists' anthropomorphism pre- vents them from understanding Solaris because they merely project their own personalities onto the protean sea. Nevertheless, the truth of that message comes from Kelvin's own mind-his projection of his thoughts onto Gibarian. The irony thus cuts two ways: Kelvin confuses the dream with reality but then recognizes the reality of the dream. Dreams also converge with reality in Ada, and since Nabokov says in an interview that the novel is "set in a dream America" (Strong Opinions, p. 116), the reality of Antiterra may be as much a dream as the reality of Solaris. Van acknowledges the connection between dreams and art when he recounts his "vocational dreams." In one of those, for example, he envisions himself going to give a reading: "The sight of the traffic and the people blocking my way" exasperates him until he realizes that "all I had to do was to strike out the phrase 'crowded street' in my manuscript" (II, 4:360). If Ada, in a sense, represents a dream America, then there is a possibility that Van is dreaming the action of the book he is narrating. His attempts to recap- ture what he calls "the dream-like, dream-rephrased, legend-distorted past" (I, 39:280) recreate the reality of that past for him and his reader. If, therefore, he crosses out "crowded street" in the manuscript, the street is no longer crowded because the only remaining reality of the dream past exists in the manuscript. The life of his dream thus becomes the reality of the book, and the life of the book becomes a dream. The fluid boundary between dream and reality resembles the incestuous meeting point of science and art, the interpenetrations of imagination and reality, and these abstract philosophical matters impinge dramatically on the characters' lives. Van, Ada, and Kelvin learn that unless there can be a sense of shared reality, unless there can be a sense of individual integrity and the possibility of recognizing others' existences as separate from one's own, there can be no possibility of shared love. Whenever imagination engulfs reality, the intensity of passion and the sense of freedom may increase, but the sharing of passion becomes more difficult. And that is what happens in the world of Solaris: the Solarists cannot go beyond their own perspective, so that each remains locked within him or herself. If too much imagination prevents love, a lack of imagination also makes shared love impossible. As we have seen, the rational panelists interrogating Berton cannot imagine the complexity of the sentient ocean or hope to under- stand a world so different from their own. In a similar way, the rational Antiterrans cannot imagine the existence or nature of Terra without the power of imagination. Irrationality makes possible the vision of a transcend- ent world where love and art can flourish. For Nabokov, then, irrationality not only allows us to intuit worlds beyond our own; it also enables us to rec-</page><page sequence="13">FLUID WORLDS 341 ognize "other states of being where art (curiosity, tenderness, kindness, ecstasy) is the norm" ("On A Book Entitled Lolita," p. 317). Nabokov told his students that "the irrational belief in the goodness of man" can become "something much more than the wobbly basis of idealistic philosophies" and can represent "a solid and iridescent truth" so that "goodness becomes a cen- tral and tangible part of one's world" ("The Art of Literature and Commonsense," p. 373). Despite the threat that imagination will become distorted, diseased, and solipsistic when it cannot distinguish self from non- self, it can also represent the human ability to know goodness and find love. In the world of Ada, moreover, the main characters possess the imagina- tive strength to believe in a world where love is the norm, and there is just enough deflection of imaginative power to enable the characters to see differences, to recognize the integrity of others. Van and Ada can thus know love: they are closely related but not the same. Van is a scientist of the inte- rior, a psychiatrist obsessed with insane imaginations. Ada is a natural scien- tist, obsessed with careful scrutiny of the outside world. Van looks inside; Ada looks outside. They are similar but complementary. Physically, they have features that are mirror images: their birthmarks are directly opposite (I, 35:218), as are their "gold-capped upper premolars" (IV, 1:556). Yet intel- lectually and emotionally, Van and Ada are not mirror images of each other because their differences are important and real. They are separate and different, but they must come together to create the balance between reality and imagination that creates meaningful science, art, and love. The closest Van and Ada can approach this physical unity is through sexual intercourse, and sex therefore becomes an unquenchable need for them: It would not be sufficient to say that in his love-making with Ada he discov- ered the pain, the ogon', the agony of supreme "reality." Reality, better say, lost the quotes it wore like claws-in a world where independent and origi- nal minds must cling to things or pull things apart in order to ward off mad- ness or death (which is the master madness). For one spasm or two he was safe. The new naked reality needed no tentacles or anchor; it lasted a moment, but could be repeated as often as he and she were physically able to make love. (I, 35:219-20) They thus become like the "two children, a brother and a sister, who did it so often that they finally died in each other's limbs, and could not be separated-it just stretched and stretched, and snapped back in place every time the perplexed parents let go" (II, 5:384). Their love goes beyond sex, moreover, for they become closest at the end of the book when they are too old to repeat their sexual acrobatics. Fear- ing that one of them will die before the other, they anticipate this "horror" by claiming that their characters should merge before the book's end: "the hero and heroine should get so close to each other by the time the horror begins, so organically close, that they overlap, intergrade, interache, and even if Vaniada's end is described in the epilogue we, writers and readers, should be unable to make out (myopic, myopic) who exactly survives, Dava or Vada, Anda or Vanda" (V, 6:584; emphasis in original).</page><page sequence="14">342 SCiENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 13 (1986) That final. union is artistic, for they are the joint narrators of Ada. Neither one of them achieved marked artistic success during their separations-Van describes his sense of the inadequate nature of his books and the failure of Ada's acting career. Sexually, their union makes them whole, but intellectu- ally and artistically it results in their apotheosis since they create the book, die into it, and live forever in its pages: "One can even surmise that if our time-racked, flat-lying couple ever intended to die they would die, as it were, into the finished book, into Eden or Hades, into the prose of the book or the poetry of its blurb" (V, 6:587; emphasis in original). Their union stands for a larger synthesis, the coming together of science and art. Their father recognizes "how passionately, how incandescently, how incestuously-c'est le mot-art and science meet in an insect, in a thrush,. in a thistle of that ducal bosquet" (II, 10:436). Ada, while playing anagrams with a friend, rearranges letters to associate "insect," "scient," "incest," and "nicest" (I, 13:85). "Insect" represents the principle of scrutiny of the natural world (Ada collects and intensively studies insects); "scient" represents the power of human imagination which orders the world of insects ("Dr Entsic was scient in insects," says Ada), and incest can be the nicest point of bal- ance between the human imagination and the natural world. But once the scales of knowledge tip towards either a purely rational realism or an all-engulfing transcendental worship of imagination, love-or even a sense of community-becomes impossible. Science, art, and love all depend upon a balance between imagination and a sense of reality. Lem finds that study of the external world is doomed to failure and frustration unless the students of that world know themselves. The last frontier, according to Lem, lies not on Solaris but in the human imagination. Nabokov, too, rejects the notion that the frontiers of knowledge lie outside us, but he remains aggres- sively less interested in the human unconscious. Nabokov, through his char- acters Van and Ada, calls for a point of balance that recognizes a certain integrity in the outside world but, at the same time, acknowledges and rejoices in the power of the imagination to behold and even transcend that world. For Lem, love is not possible unless we know ourselves. For Nabokov, we cannot know ourselves unless we love, and we cannot love unless we know the world. WORKS CITED Federman, Raymond.

Les mondes liquides: Solaris de Lem et Ada ou l'ardeur de Nabokov.-Stanislaw Lem et Vladimir Nabokov ont montre un intere't constant pour la science aussi bien que pour l'art. Ils affirment l'importance que l'imagination a pour la connaissance: selon Lem, la science de demain peut sembler de la fantaisie aujourd'hui et Nabokov admet que la perception du re'el exige l'imagination creatrice. Le role de l' imagination dans toute perception signifie que les frontieures entre l'observateur et ce qui est observe' ne sont pas stables car l'imagination de l'observateur fait le lien entre lui et la nature. Ainsi, les frontieres entre l'observateur et la nature deviennentfluides et lafluidite se transforme en metaphore importante en rapport avec I' essence de toute perception. Le danger d'une telleforce fluide imaginative est de sombrer dans la folie car le re'el apparait tellement liquide, que l'imagination des personnages peut transformer toute realite en un miroir auto- reflechissant. Ainsi, en se rapprochant du mondefluide, ils s'isolent de plus en plus de ce me?me monde et des autres. L'oeuvre principale de Lem, Solaris et celle de Nabokov, Ada ou I'ardeur traitent de mondes liquides: la planete Solaris avec son oce'an sensible et le monde domine' par l'eau d'Antiterra. L'ocean de Solaris peut s'immiscer dans les pensees les plus profondes de ses observateurs et restituer ces pense'es en formes etranges ou bien en copies conformes a' leurs souvenirs; sur Antiterra, I'eau est la source principale d'e'nergie et de communication. Cependant, ces mondes liquides comportent un danger. A mesure que les habitants de Solaris e'tudient leur planete, ils deviennent de plus en plus hypnotises par les doubles de leurs propres imagina- tions produits par l' ocean et ils ne contemplent que la re'fIection de leur esprit. Ils ne peuvent s'empecher d'investir la plane'te fluide d'anthropomorphisme, de prendre contact avec elle et de rendre la communication encore plus difficile entre eux. De la meme faon, sur Antiterra, les personnages qui ont l'imagination alerte composent le reel fluide a leur propre image. Lem et Nabokov se rapprochent des scientifiques quand ils maintiennent l'importance d'un principe de re'alite' sur lequel on s'accorde afin d'atteindre un monde de communication valable. Lem soutient que la connaissance de faits</page><page sequence="16">344 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 13 (1986) scientifiques est essentielle d sa fiction et Nabokov pretend que l'imagination sans la connaissance ne peut que produire de l'art primitif. Solaris et Ada ou l'ardeur presentent des mondes cohe'rents oui certaines hypothe'ses coincident presque avec le reel, aussi restreint que ce principe peut paraitre. Neanmoins, les personnages raisonnables de ces deux romans semblent sains au detriment de la possibilite' d'interpre'ter ce qu'ils voient et d'anticiper l'existence de mondes e'trangers. Les personnages peuvent commencer d comprendre la nature ou a decouvrir l'amour uniquement quand ils parviennent a' un equilibre entre certains principes du re'el partage's et la possibilite imaginative de deduire que d'autres mondes existent. Lem et Nabokov se retrouvent dans leur conviction que la science, I'art et I'amour se basent sur un e'quilibre entre l' imagination et le sentiment du re'el. (DF) Abstract.-Stanislaw Lem and Vladimir Nabokov, having shown a lifelong interest in science as well as art, both recognize the importance of imagination for knowl- edge: according to Lem, tomorrow's science can seem like fantasy today, and Nabokov acknowledges that the perception of all reality requires creative imagina- tion. The role of imagination in all perception means that the boundaries between the observer and the observed are not fixed because the observer's imagination connects him or her to the natural world. The boundaries between observer and nature thus become fluid, and fluidity becomes an important metaphor for the nature of all per- ception. The risk of such fluid imaginative strength is insanity because as reality seems most fluid, the characters' imaginations can transform all reality into a self- reflecting mirror. Thus the more they are connected to the fluid world, the more they become isolated from that world and each other. Lem's and Nabokov's major works, Solaris and Ada, both deal with fluid worlds-the sentient ocean of the planet Solaris, and the water-dominated world of the planet Antiterra. Solaris's ocean can penetrate the inmost thoughts of its observ- ers and precipitate them out in strange formations or exact replicas of its observers' memories, and water serves as the chief source of power and communications on Antiterra. However, there is danger in these fluid worlds. The more intensively they study Solaris, the more the Solarists become mesmerized by the ocean's replicants of their own imaginations and see mere reflections of their own minds. They cannot escape anthropomorphizing the fluid planet, preventing contact with it, and making communication with each other more difficult. In a similar way, those characters with the most vivid imaginations on Antiterra find themselves remaking reality in their own images. Lem and Nabokov join with scientists in recognizing the importance of some agreed-upon reality principle to make possible a sane world of communication. Lem emphasizes that a knowledge of scientific facts is vital to his fiction, and Nabokov claims that imagination without knowledge can only produce primitive art. In Solaris and Ada, we see worlds consistent on their own terms, worlds where certain hypotheses more nearly coincide with reality-however qualified that concept might be. Nevertheless, the rational characters in both novels seem sane at the cost of a crippling inability to interpret what they see and to intuit the nature of foreign worlds. Only when the characters can achieve a tension-filled balance between cer- tain shared principles of reality and the imaginative capacity to infer the existence of other worlds can they begin to understand nature or discover love. Lem and Nabokov thus join in their conviction that science, art, and love all depend upon a balance between imagination and a sense of reality. (DF)</page></plain_text>
