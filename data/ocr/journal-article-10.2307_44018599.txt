<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Function of Metaphor in Eisensteines "October" Marie-Claire Ropars-Wuilleumier trans. Sister Mary Christopher Baseheart This article originally appeared in Literature, No. 11 (October, 1973), 109-27, and has been translated and published here with the permission of the author. The process of localizing metaphor does not proceed without some uncer- tainty, which can often depend on its metaphorical use, but which, more profound- ly, brings into question the very stability and autonomy of its reason for being. Signs of this hesitation are seen even in its conception on the theoretical level. If substitution of signifiers (by itself) is not sufficient to encompass it, substitution does characterize the trope in its gererality ; also such substitution must rest on analogy, which - establishes the metaphor it its opposition to metonymy, in which substitu- tion springs from continguity. But this schema, linguistically founded, is often confusing: doing away with metonymy in the corpus of the figures entails, as Gerard Genette* has shown, the reduction of the trope to metaphor alone, the specific definition of which disappears at the same time. Forgetting this specificity of origin opens the way to other functions. It is in this way that Lacan, speaking of metaphor, defines it only by substitution, as if this operation would not likewise recover metonymy, which- itself is characterized in the same way by connec- tion from this he derives the different qualifications he assigns to each of the two figures-" the structure of superimposition of the signifiers in which metaphor takes "its place" and "the change of signification that metonymy demonstrates."* So trans- ferred, the opposition then plays on the level of meaning: with metaphor, or condensation, the bar of the signifier is cleared when metonymy, or displacement, extends the horizon of the signified infinitely, and perpetuates, by the lack, the movement of desire. We might be surprised to see him establish in metaphor the place of poetic activity: if the Saussurean bar is cleared, do we not return in this case to the unity of the sign, then to a signification whose linguistic fullness and referential aim seems strange to the autarchy of poetical language? In reality, clearing the bar does not interrupt, for Lacan, the play of difference and the return of one signifying chain to another; defined by a perpetual translation-rising in a signifying chain caused by a signifier which has come from another chain^-the metaphor establishes here its bases on a movement of métonymie order, opening, even in the intrusion of the discourse of the other, the space of a new lack. Hie linking thus realized between the two figures recovers, in spite of the initial diver 10</page><page sequence="2">sion, the one Jakobson establishes, when, after having compared metaphor to the operation of selection, and metonymy to that combination, he defines the poetic function by the projection of the principle of equivalence (basically metaphorical or metonymical) of the axis of selection on that of combination.® Separated in their foundation, metaphor and metonymy are joined at the level of function. It is an analagous meeting that Gerard Genette discovers when he analyzes the necessary coexistence of the two figures as revealed in the Recherche , and concludes in favor of the métonymie foundation, in the Proustian order, of all metaphoric activity.® The linking of metaphor and metonymy then does not depend on their confusion on the linguistic plane, but on their fusion in the poetic order. This is especially so as the distinction between the two figures rests on a referential base: the ideas of analogy and con tin gui ty refer to the space of the representation as space that is supposedly real, in the interior of which objects are defined by their contours and their placement , or clearly they refer to the conceptual experience, to which, more broadly the idea of resemblance can appeal. It is, moreover, the same substitution of a natural order which rhetorical delimitation of the figures ultimately involves: to think that one term is "substituted for" another, is this not to infer the pervious existence of the appropriated term whose recognition can only intervene by reference to a commonly accepted norm? By taking into account the norm, the for would end by by erasing the substituted- and the textual reality of the figure would end up by disappearing for the benefit of a signification to which it would only bring an excess or ornamentation. But, erasing the image, which thus awaits the metaphor, is impossible in the comparison, which, however, is assimilat- ed to it; with the comparison, the movement of the substitution is maintained, and the transfer is revealed in its genesis; there is no longer a "substituted for"; there is only a "like," explicit or not, thus two registers of speech: the compared not being absent, it is not necessary to restore it, and the presence of the comparing only operates better because of it. Doubtless it is not an accident that most operations given the name of metaphor by Proust are in reality comparisons, the main point of the work of the Recherche seeking precisely to move again in time to where the superimposition of space and time is achieved. The reconstitution of the movement and the coexistence of the two terms assures here the literalness, and the link, indissoluble, according to Giraudoux, of the metaphor and the metamorphosis. By restoring the route, the comparison stresses the métonymie movement, which gives metaphor its poetic efficacy. If there is no metaphor without metonymy, then their opposition is the basis for their definition; but it is also the case that a common functioning assures the recognition of them; and finally their reciprocal absorption, in which the whole idea of figure disappears, delineates the space of a text based on the sole reality of its writing The analysis of Eisenstein^ October , considered in its filmic textuality, will confirm this last proposition. Long considered obscure, October was so at first in the name of excessive metaphor. In fact, a critical tradition sets up an opposition between the true figure in cinema-the figure which has its source in concrete reality carried through a se- quence-- and the false figure whicn, because it remains independent of the dramatic action, is considered arbitrary, therefore unacceptable. Jean Mitry thus affirms that in cinema every metaphor is only (that is, can only be) a particular form of meto- nymy--in this case, syncedoche, the best example of which are the eyeglasses of Doctor Smimov, the doctor of Potemkin., who was thrown into the sea by the rebellious sailors;7 on the contrary, the statues of Napoleon, which come in October to designate the ambition of Kerensky or the counter-revolution attempted by Kornilov, have nothing in common with the diegetic context of the Revolution 11</page><page sequence="3">treated by Eisenstein; they demonstrate, instead, the impossibility of the filmic metaphor.® Let us note immediately the surprising character of a reasoning which sees in one piece of evidence the proof of a deficiency. Our discussion does not always deal with the logic of this affirmation, but very much with its implications. Here the debate is no longer about Dure rhetoric; the occultation of October 9 rests on a normative postulate assigning to cinema a law of realistic essence, even more restrain- ing than the referential principles which regulate the trope in the literary order: for the principle of contiguity is here the only requirement, because it is the only thing that does not disturb the illusion of a real and continuous space, which is antece- dent to the discourse of the film and which the discourse would be satisfied to organize, drawing its material from it: also every figure which is not found to be generated by the immediate spatial environment is, indeed, rejected. It becomes necessary, therefore, to question ourselves not only concerning the functioning of these metaphors but concerning the function which they perform within the discourse of revolutionary exaltation. Rhetoric and ideology go together; the clarification of their rapport will permit us to measure the incidences, in poetical terms, of a film which wanted to be, and was on many points, of an experimental order. The existence of cinematic metaphors has been explicitly upheld by Jakob- son, who given as an example the dissolves of Chaplin's films and contrasts méto- nymie montage of various points of view developed up to that time on the model of Griffith. This comment is interjected incidentally in "Two Types of Aphasia," which dates from 1956 but in an article published in 1933,* * Jakobson settled the debate of the "cinema- thing" and the " cinema-sign,'' noting that if the real world 'constitutes the privileged material of film, the discourse transforms these things into signs by the two constitutive operations of metonymy-part for the whole 12~and metaphor; his analysis rests on the work of Russian formalists and particularly on the studies of Tynianov, with whom Eisenstein maintained close connections. The example Jakobson chooses to illustrate metaphor designates a compari- son, the two terms of which know an equal presence. And indeed the metaphors of October depend on this type, of which the film offers an unusual application: the substitution of a porcelain dog for a man stretched out in an armchair, harps and balilaikas for a chattering Menchevik, or the tail of a peacock for Kerensky strutting before the door of the Czar, is executed in a cross-cutting montage, which not only assures the representation of the two terms, but which especially achieves thé fusion of them by a repetitive movement, constitutive, in fact, of the metaphoric operation: each of the two terms intervenes in several sudden appearances-distrib- uted in the course of the sequence or several times outside it; and it is the more or less intense frequency of the cross-cutting at the same time as the eventual trans- formation of the diverse manifestations which determines the degree of rooting and the discursive force of the comparison. The dog will be represented two or three times more, but thę Napoleons, which occupy a whole sequence overflow into other parts of the film, thus establishing among several fragments the weaving of an identical metaphoric texture. Whatever may be the power of irradiation, a common point joins the operations: they rise at first from the work of the montage, before having effect on the images, properly speaking. Moreover, when Eisenstein, some twenty years later, again takes up the theoretical considerations of his method in October, it is always at the level of montage and not of representation that he defines the trope, reproaching even Dovshenko or Griffith for using isolatęd meta- phors, which, perceived in themselves and in long shot, will be dependent on realistic space their passing intervention in the midst of another space will 12</page><page sequence="4">produce in this case an effect of intrusion and not of fusion. To choose, on the other hand, a close-up shot, and not a long shot, allows the image to be cut away from all reference to a real space; this abstraction once achieved, the repetitive force, released by the cross-cutting montage of the fragments so abstracted and of the first, elements tobe transformed, assures the perceptive successs of the substitu- tion. Commenting on this principle, the Soviet linguist Ivan ov 14 notes that the montage develops a common syntactic structure which, while joining two terms semantically different in an alternate* repetition, constructs a line of equivalence between them. But it would be fitting to note also that in this perspective a méto- nymie operation, or more exactly a syncedochic operation, precedes the metaphor ic substitution : to take close ups is precisely to choose within a spatialized whole a fragment which is contiguous to it by inclusion. However, the partial appropriation here does not tend at all to suggest the part for the whole, and then to use the part to return to the complete space; on the contrary, it is a matter of blocking all reference to this real space, in order to guarantee the fusion, abstracted, of the two rejsteis to be joined. The métonymie operation here is turned from its goal for a meta- pnoric use. As for superimposition, properly so-called, since montage alone can assure it, it could in no case be limited to two isolated representations; the crossing is first, even if it were repetitive and not progressive, and a movement, méto- nymie, determines the metaphoric substitution. A double reference to metonymy provides the basis, in principle, for the realization of the Eisensteinian metaphor. The operation always remains of a metaphoric order, since it depends on a rapport of formal similarity: so in the sequence of the "democrat at the doors of the Czar," the tail of the peacock, unfolding in a fan, little by little takes the place of the door which opens then closes, while earlier, for the face of one of Kerensky's "valets" encouraging him to cross the threshold, the head of the bird with a similar gesture had been substituted; hesitating before the threshold, Kerensky puts an arm behind his back and places a hand m his coat, thus striking a Napoleonic pose; a sequence later, it is sufficient for him to cross both arms on his chest, while ascending another stairway, in order for a statue of Napoleon to appear which corresponds to the new pose thus repre- sented. The downfall of Kerensky, at the time of the attack of Kornilov, will be expressed metaphorically by the shattering of the* statue, the montage of which will cut the head, hands, and arms apart. Now, at the door of the Czar, at the moment of the crucial hesitation, an analogous montage had cut apart the rear-view silhouette of Kerensky. Generating the Napoleonic comparison implies previous treatment of the reality to be transformed: it is this treatment, and not reality in itself, which creates the appearance of an image, whose radiation will spread over a whole section of the film, since the attack of Kornilov and of the Cossacks is represented in its turn in another statue of Napoleon, this time on horseback ; thus divided by internal disconnections, the metaphor ends up by functioning in com- plete autonomy: the confrontation of Kornilov and Kerensky will be represented by the strugge of the two figures, having become the only reality, and caught in an alternating montage whose movement this time organizes the confrontation and not the fusion, to their respective destruction, which permits the return to a realist representation. Although dominant, this way of generating metaphor is not the only process in the course of October to guarantee the production of metaphors. If the peacock or the Napoleons spring from purely discursive necessity, the marble dog, shown posed on a table, doubtless belongs to the room where the Provisional Government passively awaits the outcome of the attack led by the Bolsheviks; although meta- phoric in its essence, since the dog strikingly resembles one of the governors, it can 13</page><page sequence="5">then depend on a métonymie origin based on spatial contiguity. Let us remember that the order of the montage inverts the meaning of this relation: the dog appears in a close-up after a close-up of a face, which seems to have evoked it; on the other hand, no shot frames the man and the dog together. As for the harps, which ac- company the Menshevik proposals, they have their source in a place other than that of Smolny, where these speeches are given; at the Winter Palace, where the Pro- visional Government sits, one of its members has idly traced with his hand the design of a harp on a glass door, in a movement several times repeated, at short intervals, by the montage; still earlier, Kerensky, a few minutes before his flight, makes the gesture of plucking the strings of a lyre. The repeated figure of this type of object, some sequences later, does not rest on a spatial contiguity: there is no direct proximity of Smolny to the Winter Palace; in turn, there is a textual linking which succeeds in joining these two places only by the repetition, though changed, of a common figure. And that is really the meaning of such a rapproachement which at once reveals surreptitiously the complicity of the Menshevik and the Provisional Government and keeps open the concurrence and the possible confusion of the two spaces-- that of the Congress and that of the Palace- the second of which, at the end of the film wilî be usurped by the first, since the Bolsheviks will over come Congress and will determine the taking of the Palace. The figure of the harps and its transfer from one place to another manifest the ideological invasion of Smolny by the Palace; the dramaturgic reverse of this invasion will accompany the submission of the Palace to Smolny, then symbolically, its reduction to the méto- nymie order. Of such a reduction, which is only represented here, there exist more literal manifestations. When a government officer, having surprised a guard outside his post, appeals to his mother as a symbol of duty, the apparition of a statue of Rodin entitled "the first steps" (and representing a woman who guides the steps of her child) seems to comment metaphorically on these admonitions; but the follow- ing shot, showing the woman's death battalion drilling, reveals in the field, by the retreat of the soldier firing the gun, the presence of this statue, which belongs to the space of the Winter Palace, where the troops of Kerensky are assembled. Meta- phorically generated and in a relation to the word we will have to return to, the statue is therefore metonymically reproduced, although in a place different from the Palace. More significant still, an analogous phenomenon changes the function of the cross and medals, used symbolically in the course of the film in order to repre- sent* and denounce the concept of fatherland, but revealed existentially at its end when after the siege of the Palace one of the assailants discovers in the royal apartments^ some chests filled with insignia, the inheritance of a formerly con- quered czarist regime which in mocking contiguity are next to bidets and holy images. If, then, the generating metaphor in October goes through the diversion of metonymy, it is only a stage, the final phase of which intervenes in a métonymie return to metaphor: becoming diegetic, the latter receives its assignment to a real space, and in this way can be appropriate d-could this be for the purpose of affirm- ing the rejection of all property, as when the stolen spoons are thrown back into a ditch or when the casks the people coveted are pierced with the butt-end of muskets as the cellars are being invaded? But it is symptomatic that the discovery of this real space rises from a conquest-as is shown also by the totality of the composition, which keeps the storming of the Palace until the end. This is certainly in the order of history, since the film ends with its capture, but it is also in the order of representation which up to this point is in fragments, but at the end, is brought together: the first long shot of the Palace, taken in high angle like a distant echo of the shot which preceded the firing on Nevsky Perspective, appears only 14</page><page sequence="6">before the attack ; and this has at first the rhythm of a subterranean infiltration, allowing already known fragments of the Palace to be linked together even while remaining abstracted from all topological localization. The diegetic realization of a historic space then supposes that there has been established previously a discursive space, against which, but also through which it will be constituted: so objects are metaphors of the Palace before being metonymies of it. The métonymie reduction does not affect them all: certain ones will remain suspended indefinitely, such as the peacock and the Napoleons. They always intervene with the accumulation of things- plates or lead soldiers- which symbolically define the Palace at the time of its first appearance; rather than being contained in it, they contribute with the same right as the others to outline its form. In its genesis, therefore, the Winter Palace rises from textual space, which gives meaning rather than represents the contours of it: it is the object which constructs the space, not the space which contains the object; the place is subsequent to the signs which compose it and which will allow it at the end to be destroyed. Grasping the real involves passing through its textual elaboration- this is what was proved by the function of the metaphor; on this is based the general movement of the Eisensteinian inquiry, which finds the elimination of realism-and of its ideological burden-in the return to a reality conceived as a product not as a given: the product of a history, but also, and first, the product of a discourse. And if metonymy of place, in October , ends by outweighing the metaphoric work, it is the metonymy of the text, and it alone, which throughout the film assures the rise and the circulation of the metaphors: contiguity exists in the space of the film before being realized in a localizable space; the anaphoric movement precedes and determines all representation of reality. From the constant relation which metaphor maintains with metonymy in the principle which regulates its elaboration (diversion of metonymy), as in the law which confers on it its function within the film (the return to metonymy), it would be tempting to end up with a struggle of the two figures, which would give to the struggle of the classes its textual allocation. The world of objects, which the meta- phor draws from, is really divided into two camps, objects of decorations or statues coming to substitute for the bourgeoisie whose appurtenances of class they symbo- lize, while objects of service-typewriters, tools, or banners*®- accompany the people; also regular lines display the presentation of these objects: it is in rows that the Palace stored glasses and decanters, also in rows that Smolny exhibits arms and tanks. Now the nature of the substitution varies precisely according to the class represented: the bourgeoisie depends on the metaphor, while the proletariat escapes it. If the bicycle wheels represent the rallying of the cyclists to the Revolution, it is here a matter of an instrumental linking of a synecdochic order; the hair of a young girl, some copies of Pravda floating on the water, are substitutes for the Nevsky massacre: but they are parts of it before being figures of it; and the passage from one to the other represents exactly, at the same time of the massacre, the displace- ment of a métonymie representation of the people (the dead girl or the dead standard bearer) to a symbolic representation, and ideological representation, which always depends on a synecdochic rather than a metaphoric impulse. On the other hand, the contamination of the bourgeois power and its structure operates most often in a relation of similarity, excluding all initial reference to a primary conti- guity. From the beginning of the film, the proletariat possesses a real place-if only that of its massacre on Nevsky Perspective ; the problem is for it to gain access through the mastery of its objects to its symbolic representative, the signs of its power. The bourgeoisie has no place which is its own: it produces its own decor until it is destroyed because it is merely representative. Kerensky always remains metaphoric, except at the moment of his flight, when Lenin intervenes chiefly in a 15</page><page sequence="7">metonymy of the place which supports him or even represents him-the space of a meeting, between a clock and a flag, of a Congress, or of a hut , which in its secrecy substitutes for him; if he becomes a metaphor, when his face is substituted for a cannon which launches the attack on the Palace, it is at the moment when Kerensky is only represented, metonymically, by a flag of the car in which he is fleeing. As fascinating as it may appear, such a schema does not recover all the figures of the film; especially it does not account for a second type of metaphor which, far from being grasped through the real, strengthens the role which such metaphors play in the grasping of the real. If the metaphoric transposition conceptually designates the bourgeoisie and its absence from a real place, it equally permits restoring to the real the functioning of certain concepts produced or utilized by the same bourgeoisie, and whose denial it constructs at the same time as it constructs its transcription: in the conceptual sequences, the metaphor semantically rejects the very things it designates; and far from representing it symbolically, the metaphor intervenes to signal the difference which separates every symbol-in this case the concept-- from the representation from which it springs. It is with the sequence called "Polonaise of the Gods" that Eisenstein had pushed farthest his research into the discursive power of montage and its role in the elaboration of a cine-discourse independent of visual denotation. Ten years later reflecting on the experience he described its genesis in the context of the film and the theoretical perspectives which he believed could be drawn from it:*^ initially it was a matter of developing a critique against dogmatism, whether it was of ideolo- gical or religious origin; the concept of divinity was to serve as a basis for the refuta- tion. But the difficulties encountered in the filmic realization of his thesis and his reflection on the solution chosen would lead him to see in this sequence a model for the filming of abstract concepts, realized without any recourse to a dramaturgic mediation. In this perspective, the sequence only systematized the elimination of realistic preliminaries, already singularly subverted by the work of the metaphors; it became then the image reduced, but emphasized by a complete filmic experience which was directed toward proving the possibility of one day filming Le Capital : October does not recount the Revolution; it analyses its meaning; this discourse does not pretend to represent the events, but rather to reconstitute their driving principle-" the Bolshevik strategy. We will put aside for a moment the relation of the sequence to the rest of the film: it originates in the counter-revolutionary attack led by Kornilov "in the name of God and of Country," as the subtitle states; by being broken up internally, this subtitle generates the filmic development of each of the concepts, which will then be reassembled and mixed into a single montage. We will pause particularly on the treatment of the concept of divinity in order to examine what mode of func- tioning assures the linking of the images to the idea, and which perspectives it opens on the nature of filmic writing proposed by Eisenstein. Only this digression will permit a return to a general evaluation of the law of the metaphors and their role in the meaning of October. That the rapport, here, may be of a metaphoric order is implied by the confrontation of the verbal and the non-verbal; the God concept is proposed in its abstract generality by the subtitle, whose visual character does not efface the linguistic support; its later reconstruction in aseries of figurative shots fixes the law of the images evoked by resemblance to the idea from which they get their support: the different representations of the divinity which will intervene in the sequence presupposes a relation of similarity, not only among them, but also with the con- cept which it treats; they function as metaphors of God: God is like cupolas, a Christ, .a Buddha, etc. The images that follow act as a metaphorical illustration of the 16</page><page sequence="8">idea. The problem is complicated each time by the duality of the discourse: it is not only a matter of building the concept, demonstrating the discursive power of the cinema, but also and especially of deconstructing it, thus proving the dialectic impact unique to such a discourse. In this second perspective, the series of divine figurations will not only aspire to reassemble all the figures of God, but also to establish among them a critical principle of transformation. Taking into considera- tion the last terms become then a determinant: part of the concept in its uni ve r- alizing abstraction, the sequence must lead to its most impoverishing reduction-in this instance a gil yak idol comparable, according to Eisenstein, to a block of wood: "God is like a block of wood," that is what the general movement of the discourse will say. It is, then, a double metaphoric relation which the discourse will have to establish. Hie fundamental question which Eisenstein encounters concerns precisely the filmic translation of a double sign-equality of all the images of the concept, but also equality among the images, realized in such a manner that it admits the law of change and permits in due time the difference to be measured, consequently the inequality between the final image and the initial concept. The complexity of this double movement, of contradictory suggestion, obviously is incompatible with the conceptual transactions resulting from a symbolism limited to the figurative con- tent of the representation; on the contrary, its realization calls for a prior interven- tion of the montage which will have to establish among these representations a network of similarities capable of bearing by itself the whole of the thesis. It is through the building of an associative chain that Eisenstein resolves the problem, while multiplying and dialecting the structure of the montage, carried out in the elaboration of the other metaphors. The section in question includes 32 shots, a descriptive summary of which you will find below: the three initial shots presenting the subtitles, the 29 other shots revealing différait images of objects corresponding to the generating subtitle. A double system of opposition, by fragmentation, and of unity, by repetition, intro- duces to the whole of the section a principle of contradictory development Directly referring to the cue idea of divinity, the visual representations distin- guish a triple dislocation. Dislocation first in the nature of the objects represented, one part of which belongs to architecture (cupolas) and the other to sculpture (statues). But this first classification undergoes a new internal division, several types of cupolas and several types of statues intervening in the course of the sequence. It is not just one representation that is seized in turn by the fragmentation, but the same object appears several times, either in a consecutive series in which variation is achieved by the scale of the shot, or in similar repetitions effected at variable intervals. Let us note immediately that the self-same work of deconstruction regulates the succession of the three subtitles, 21 since the first proposes the generality of a double concept (God and Country), and the last two take only one of the concepts while displaying its formulation on two planes. But the fullness that the phenomenon attains in the uniquely figurative part allows the consequences of this last kind of deconstruction to be measured much better: it is that, it inscribes, in reverse, a repetitive form of suggestion, rhythmic as well as visual. The opposi- tion introduced in the diverse representation will assure, then, through perceptive differences, the possibility of a transformation; it will generate with the same force, through a cross-cutting montage, based on repetition, the unity of a common syntactic body in the interior of which changes become necessary: the principle of equivalence among the different representations is achieved in this way, all the more since the formal linking will facilitate the sliding of one to the other. More- over, the recourse to a force of opposition generates by counterthrust the unitary structure capable of causing the unique theme (which it was all the while treating) 17</page><page sequence="9">w «1 CL. £ O ü Q Oh' O 8 B - - H - © S 5 a Ä s Ä ft a ~ è- «¡ e¿ « Ä ~ ? e¿ 1 "S 'S « H- -s «¡ 2 * « £ =- a i S * «8 1 I .§ « 8 &amp; .a -s ~ -s J2 * =- d i * 2 ? ? 5 r .a » •§ -s ~ ~ « -s ¡ i - 5 i -a •§ I 1 ?

Through this contradictory system, different representations are taken into the same whole, and the concept is built; the whole locates the differ- ence in the meaning of a transformation, and the concept is deconstructed. Hie first half of the sequence (shots 4 to 18) reassembles anthropomorphic images of divinity, while the second half brings in zoomorphic figurations, masks, and idols. But the purely anthropomorphic part is dominated by the principle of opposition between statuary and architecture, since it is in this series only that cupolas intervene, where they play a structuring role, marked by the number as well as by the brevity of their appearances, 22 which distinguishes them clearly from the statues. In fact, opening the series (shot 4), they appear four times: three times they are the same cupolas of a baroque style (shots 4, 6-7. 9-10); the fourth time (shots 13-15) a mosque of simplified lines. Furthermore, their frequency of occur- ence accelerates not so much by the shortening of the intervals as by the lengthen- ing of the series: the first representation, a long shot of four cupolas, remains isolated; the following two shots introduce binary series constituted alternately by the deconstruction of the long shots (the four cupolas angled to the left, then two of the cupolas angled to the right in shots 6 and 7, which are very short; the same series is repeated in shots 9 and 10, but only one of the cupolas framed closer and remaining a little longer); finally the last representation, which introduces a differ ent cupola (shots 13-15), links them to the preceding ones by the conclusion.it brings them on the rhythmic plane: the cupola, this time, is taken in a ternary series, in which the altern ation--cupola angled to the left (very brief)/ cupola angled to the right (very brief)-ends on a shot of a front view of the cupola (of longer duration). Shot 15 in this way recovers the framing and duration of the initial shot (4), but it is no longer a question of the same style of cupola, and there is just a single cupola. One and the same theme--"cupolas"-has thus undergone an internal explosion; through its repetition, it introduces at the same time a visual transfor- mation and a rhythmic structuring, itself based on a system of opposition, the effects of which the shots of statues achieve-statues with which the cupolas alter- nate. The first three intervening shots of cupolas frame the isolated, but repeated, representation of Christ in glory with arms raised (shots 5 and 8), in an equally baroque style, the radiation of which because of its similarity links up with that of the "Petersbourgeoisie" cupolas with their radiating lines. The two themes are opposed therefore in their figurative content, even while being substituted for one another through formal resemblance. Hie brief reappearance of Christ, after the first binary series of cupolas and with a simple variation of framing, assures a better fusion of the two opposing themes, so much the more because it is followed by the second binary series: twice the same Christ, alternating twice with the same binary series of cupolas. But following the second series is not the baroque Christ expected for a third time but a Hindu god, culturally opposed to the Christ; if it resembles him formally, it is an exacerbation of its baroque radiation, the force of which becomes more aggressive. Each time the substitution is made according to a princi- ple of equivalence guaranteed by the rhythmic repetition of the same cupolas, which twice have introduced the same Christ, and under the guise of similarity they make way for the introduction for the third time of another divinity. ^ In contrast to the Christ, the Hindu god intervenes in two consecutive shots, framed in the manner of shot 11 in full figure, therefore a little farther away than in shot 12: the variation of framing is the same as for the Christ, the frequency of appearance increases only through contamination with the binary series of cupolas. But it is at this moment that the cupolas change, passing to the round form and to the ternary series in order to generate finally the last divine image of this part, that of a Buddha with round lines: here again, the substitution of the statue for the 25</page><page sequence="17">cupola depends upon a formal linking; but at the same time, the rhythmic contam- ination develops, since the Buddha has three consecutive appearances of unequal duration (shots 16 to 18), the first two offering only partial views (the face, the hands resting on his legs), and the last a complete and more distant view of the seated statue. The morphological and cultural fields of the divine representations has thus undergone a total transformation, from the radiant Christ to the round Buddha The cultural break occurs with the Hindu god, which each time remains, through its morphology, linked visually to the Christ; the morphological break explodes with the Buddha, which always belongs to a cultural domain close to that of Vishnu. The three representations of the divinity are caught up in a common syntactic structure, based on rhythmic progression in the repetition: two separated representations of the Christ (one long, one short), two consecutive representations of the Hindu god (one long, one medium), three consecutive representations of the Buddha (one medium, one short, one longer). In this movement, which links them and re- assembles them, they obey the one established by the cupolas, the structural organization of which, extended through the whole section, has allowed the effects of the break to be erased even in their own figuration. It is with the change of the cupolas that the plastic modification begins which leads from a radiating morpho- logy to a round morphology; but the syntactic frame in the heart of which this change occurs constitutes the unity of the old and the new cupolas: this it links, under this theme "cupolas," morphological and cultural differences, the equiva- lence of which will be projected through syntactic contamination onto the different representations of the divinity, being associated themselves by formal linking?, either to one of the series of cupolas or to the other. The transformation of the cupolas passing unperceived by reason of the brevity of their rhythm, will carry in its wake the transformation of the statues, which is, however, more conspicuous. It is the force of attraction of this rhythmic tissue which effects, in the second part, the integration of the zoomorphic representations. They appear for the first time in shot 19, in the form of a lion's head, whose grimacing countenance alone offers visual rapport with the pointed radiation preceding it; but the opposi- tion-human figures/ animal figures- which shot 20, an adipose Buddhist divinity, emphasizes, is indeed developed in the system of formed oppositions of the first part, since the succession of two divinities (animal and human) takes up again, while exacerbating it, the play of the pointed and the round, which is going to affect the following three shots (21-23) combining a head with a birďs beak (both human and animal, but predominantly pointed), a square head more like an animal's and a human face (a Japanese masque) entirely round. So the synthesis of the two types of representations tends to operate through a plastic distribution of the opposition, in which it will be noted also that the point, while becoming square, tends to approach the round; but the fusion of the opposi tes, already more realizable in a opposition of forms than in an opposition of content, is on the other hand upheld by the action of the syntactic system of the first part: if the variations in duration diminish, 24 but with a distinct tendency toward acceleration at the end, shots 19 and 20 on the other hand pick up again the movement of the near (in a close-up shot) and of the far (in a medium shot), while shots 21-23 develop in extreme close-up the ternary series right/left/ front (view). This rhythmic system had been imposed on similar or analogous representations; formerly disassociated from any figurative line, this system is applied to representations of a very different nature, on which it projects its unifying force. It emphasizes the degradation of the traits which run through the fragment, the purpose of which is to lead to the mask (shot 23), that is, to figuration totally separated from the idea of resemblance; still anthropomorphic in shot 23, the mask loses, in shot 24, every human shape: it is 26</page><page sequence="18">the wood and the paint which become perceptible. The linking of two shots again operates under the auspices of a plastic opposition between round and square, the fusion of which is favored once more by the repetition of shot 23 in 25; then we await, according to the rhythmic system of alternation, the repetition of shot 24 in 26; but it is another mask, African and more abstract, indeed reducible to three superimposed circles, which intervenes and is imposed upon three shots in the rhythm right/left/ front which the cupolas had developed, for which it seems to be substituted in the equivalence of two objects (which are no longer imitations). And indeed it is an object, and no longer a statue or a mask which shot 29 offe», an object scarcely identifiable (a funeral um? head of a fetish?) but in which the theme of the round has become that of the hollow, which the pierced circle of eyes in shot 28 attracts. The last three shots then return to a human figuration, from now on considered derisory: these are fetishes- different yet joined once more in a ternary rhythm- of which shot 30 shows the dangling planks which serve as hands,25 of which shot 31 joins two other examples in filli figure, and of which shot 32 allows only a new face of round wood to remain with lineaments that are scarcely outlined. Through the chain of divine representations thus constituted, the concept of God has received the totality of possible incarnations, in all forms, all configura- tions, and all cultures, from Europe to Asia, from the North Pole to Africa None of these images alone symbolizes the divinity; a structure of equivalence joining them * to each other, it is their assembly and their confrontation which makes the concept circulate without being assignable to an isolated representation. But the accumu- lating circulation at the same time registers a work of reduction which leads from the baroque suggestion of movement to its objectification in a piece of an idol (the only object of the sequence that moves ),2^ or from the anthropomorphic radiation of mystical inspiration to the prominent placement of material effacing almost every lineament It is certain that the reduction schema so described puts into question also the cultural a prion's on which it rests: in what perspective can we consider that the passage from the "Petersbourgeois" baroque to the primitiveness of a fetish manifests a degradation of the concept? Can the Gilyak idol truly represent the lowest degree of incarnation, or is it not in fact a question of a higher form of abstraction? In Eisenstein's view, the question is not posed in these terms: it is not the historical root of these symbols which he considers here, it is only the possibility of confronting formally different configurations, of making the concrete presence of the materiality appear behind the ineffable halo. Moreover, let us note that the ambiguity of the development necessarily conveys the contradiction of the double movement on which the sequence is built: since it is a question of building and destroying a concept at the same time, the final phase of the journey will inevitably reflect the duality of this exigency, offering a representation which is at once closest to the material and most capable of abstraction. The contradictory nature of the movement is more important here than the signification, which its mode of realization carries. It is in projecting a principle of opposition into the heart of a single theme, as we have seen, that Eisenstein assures both the constitution of the theme and the questioning of it: inserting "the dialec- tic conflict in the development of an idea,"2? he submits this idea to a force of contradiction which allows the unity and the disintegration to be elaborated at the same time. It is the metaphoric character of the chain which guarantees the unity : all the representations resemble one another, as they resemble the concept; but, in reality, the resemblance is produced by the montage more than it is determined by the representation: the syntactic organization assembles the imagss whose linking is achieved as much in the difference as in the plastic analogy ; and the idea of similar- ity is abstracted to the highest point since it joins elements as formally dissimilar as 27</page><page sequence="19">a Christ and an idol. Hie assembling plays on the nearness which their insertion in a common structure establishes among different representations, in which the frame- work of alternating repetitions allows the introduction of changes as equivalent substitutions, based on contiguity. The repetitive syntax lends a métonymie base to a metaphoric effect: the similarity of the elements is created by their contiguity: the resemblance is only an illusion, only the syntactic linking is real. We see the semantic consequences of such a function: far from being images of the concept, the representations are only fragments; they are objects whose accumulation and juxtaposition in real space, as yet prehistorical, have ended up by producing the concept. But the sequence reverses the movement of this supposed route: if, according to Eisenstein, every concept springs historically from a condensation of concrete images, ^8 it is not the work of elaboration which is restored here; on the contrary, it is the decomposition of such images. This is not only a matter of producing the concept, it is above all a matter of taking it back to its origins, that is, to the components which have permitted its production: the final block of wood is only the content of the containing God; just as the first figurative shot (that of the cupola) in its profusion joined the round and the square, the one and the many, the oblique and the straight, the other shots of cupolas set up fragmentation and isolation. What, therefore, this sequence effects is a reverse «of the metaphoric law; these are no longer images which are metaphors of the concept, it is the concept which rejoins a metaphoric origin, under the pressure of images which have become objects and no longer symbols: each object is only a synecdochic fragment of an idea whose generalizing abstraction develops from the metaphor. Or, in other words, it is the concept which resembles the images, not the images which resemble the concept: this accumulation of metaphors of God really says "God is only a metaphor." For a double similarity links the subtitle to the images: one goes from the characteristic to the figure- realizing by filmic means the construction of the concept; but the other, more constitutive because engaging the whole meaning of the mon- tage, restores what is represented-in this case, the concept--to the characteristic, that is, to the concrete. In reducing the concept to the original figure, Eisenstein proposes the return to the figure as to a reality contradicted by the extensive use which is made of the concept If the concept is returned to the metaphor, this metaphoric relegation assures the grasp of the real. Though a model, the sequence of the gods is not the only witness to this realizing function of the metaphor. In the invocation of the mother, already cited above, the statue intervenes as an ironic and reducing figure of an abstract idea which it returns to the concrete. The interminable rise of Kerensky, indefinitely ascending the same stairs with his retinue, while the subtitles shell out the echelons which he climbs in the hierarchy of functions, constitutes a literal representation, and a devaluating one, with a cliche whose force is directed toward effacing its metaphoric character. These three examples, even though they have different titles, establish the same type of relation between the concept and its figure: it is a question each time of substituting the material image for the abstract idea. The abstraction of October can thus be situated in its true place. Hie concrete reduction in no way implies a realistic representation ; on the contrary, this is why the sequence of the gods is a valuable example-the objects are signs of the real without being rooted in any reality whatsoever- all referential space, except cultural space, being excluded from this section. In this respect, their function apparently differs from the first type of metaphor examined, in which the play of substitution seemed to impose on reality a symbolic transformation-whose dis- cursive development also had to lead to reduction through insertions in the diegesis. The difference is really minor; what it involves is only a different relation of metaphor to metonymy: in conceptual passages, like the sequence of the gods, the 28</page><page sequence="20">metaphor intervenes as a product of metonymy; while, when it plays through resemblance to reality and not to the idea, it is the reverse which is produced. Outside this difference, a constant remains: the overlapping of the two figures, and the breaking up, which results from it, of every stable figure. For, the same work of montage is operative in the two kinds of examples, with the very same function disclosing the meaning instead of representing it- this disclosure being able to act in opposite directions, whether it is a matter of taking the idea back to its real origin, or, on the contrary, whether reality must be referred to the signification which locates it and lays itself open to it Doubtlessly, this explains that a common theme assembles all the objects to a metaphoric import, that these metaphors come to signify the bourgeoisie or to turn against it the concepts it employs. No symbolic law is in essence^ assigned to them: it is from the montage, from their position, that they receive their function. Circulating in the film, they constitute the textual material, drawn from the decor of St Petersburg, but assuring in complete autono- my, outside of all referential aim, the basis of a discourse in which the figure takes effect only through rapport with the text and not with the context Many examples of this circulation have already been pointed out. The sequence of the gods doe6 not escape it either, since a sequence later the two fetishes will join the two Napoleons generated previously with Kornilov and Kerensky, and repeated in the "fatheriand" section of the sequence: projected beyond this sequence on to the episode of savage conflict which marks the defeat of Kornilov and by corol- lary of Kerensky, the fetishes and Napoleon come to impress the traces of their preceding function in a more realistic sequence, the outcome of which marks the defeat of the two concepts. But once introduced in this sequence, the objects are no longer defined in terms of metaphor or metonymy; they inject their figura- tive origins into the realistic parts on which they confer a law of writing through the metonymy of the text itself: this episode of savage conflict, thus strengthened by recollections of previous sequences-the insignia "god and fatherland" and the tracts prepared at Smolny- appears then as the dialectic result of these sequences, which carry in it the mark of the ecriture; the nature of the montage elsewhere confirms this-using cross-cutting and dislocation in the so-called "documentary" sections as much as in those labeled "metaphoric." At this degree of overlapping, reality and figure are no longer distinguishable, no more than metaphor and meto- nymy. We could also trace this fusion through the analysis of sections in the domi- nant diegetic; we would see that their repetitive nature-and their distribution within the repetition in the whole of the film- tends toward analogous results, but by inverted route: the frequent reappearance of the uprising, of the statue which was torn down at the beginning, or of Kerensky's car in flight end up by designating these representations as images of themselves, outside the whole substitutive operation. Metonymies of an event, they become metaphor through their montage. And when a Sphinx's head intervenes twice, during the closing of the bridges, before the fall of the dead horse, the nature of this intrusion is not directly defin- able : is it metonymy, through contiguity of the surrounding town which suddenly reappears? But also isn't it metaphor, through analogy with the suspense which precedes the fall? The sphinx does not precisely say. It is taken into the montage which brings together the bridge, the dead horse and a young girl's hair in an equal presence (which is not representative), and the meaning of which depends only upon their relationship. Produced by montage, the Eisensteinian figures therefore find in montage the source of their effacement-effacement of the figures in the reality of the text. The property of this montage is to submit the analogical representation to a work of construction, and to propose the real as the result of a search and not as a given: it is in the production of meaning that we grasp the world, not in the reproduction 29</page><page sequence="21">of its appearances; to representation as a figurative imitation of reality, Eisenstein therefore opposes the image**® as an abstract element produced through montage in a perfect independence with regard to the elements represented. Hie disappearance of the figure goes equally with the denial of the con figuration- understood as the direct adherence of the meaning to the representation. The nature of this montage and of the discontinuous confrontations which it effects in the series of cross-cuts finds its point of ideological anchorage in its reference to the dialectic: taken up in a system of fragmentations, oppositions, assemblages, the representations generate a signification which is the product and not the sum of them. 3* The ideology of October develops first from a writing which carries the testing of this proposition to its limits; its revolutionary character does not hold to the story of the Revolution-which it does not tell--but to the injection into the revolutionary discourse of a productive force traced upon the theoretical motive power of the event: if the film stops at the edge of an essentially realistic representation, the fact is that the discourse of the film conveys first a reflection on the real and the impossibility of grasping it without in the first place constructing the concrete signification with the abstracted image. The exigency is two-fold: to take cinematographic material~and its illusory reality-back to the state of raw material; to recover these fragments freed in an ensemble which re- composes the contradictory image of reality and its significative orientation. The movement of the writing then retraces in its constitutive dynamics that of a dialec- tic which constitutes the story. Organized on a syntactic basis, it is the montage, and not the representa- tion, which takes over the semantic function. We could find many premises for this displacement in the research of the Russian formalists: the substitution of the syntactic for the lexic as a definition of poetry or the substitution of structure for the material as a definition of prose.3 ^ Between the principle of dynamic correla- tion which T^vnianov establishes as the basis of literary work or even cinemato- graphic work33 and the system of dialectic conflict tested by Eisenstein in the sequence of the gods, there is always a difference, the consequences of which can be measured on the linguistic plane. Tynianov's proposition concerns the total significance of the work; it does not engage the law of the sign; and if Jakobson puts into question the immediate bivalence of it, it is in the order of poetry, whose function is to indicate the absence of identity between the signs and the objects, 3^ through a change of relations between the signifier and the signified, between the sign and the concept3 5--a proposition from which he inferred in 1933 that language is only one of the possible semantic systems. Eisensteines experiment, on the other hand, through the exigency of conflictual realization to which it responds, results in pulverizing the sign at the moment when it undertakes to give to cinema, through specific means, a signifying power analogous to that of language.3® The power of the sequence of the gods is not only connected to the fact that it assigns an imagis- tic origin to ideas of meaning, enrolling in the Nietzschean school of the "white mythology"3^ and of a metaphysical illusion to be destroyed; it is also connected to its altering the very path of the concept, so that the sequence effects a linguistic as well as an ideological decondensation: the exhaustion of the idea, by unchaining the metaphors, induces the scattering of the sign which supports it; but the con- struction of the meaning, through its principle of fragmentation and of repetition, grasps the metaphors revealed in the necessity of a métonymie articulation: the sequence functions then as a signifying chain, in which discontinuous and repetitive relations of representation, cut away from their referents, generate the abstract image of a single yet splintered signification.3® To cascades of signi fiers linked by montage corresponds the single signified, God-whose critical pulverization they effect through the écriture itself, which constructs them but not the signified. 30</page><page sequence="22">Reflecting on this work of decondensation, which constitutes the great discovery of October , Eisenstein oscillates between several interpretations, seeing in it sometimes a return to the prelogical mode of language^ and sometimes the attraction of a Joyce an formu la. ^ But what he tries to define in historical terms, while remaining often the prisoner of Levy-Bruhlian anthropology/* 1 recovers its fecundity on the linguistic plane : it is less a before and after of the sign which appears here than a signifying system, where the meaning, circulating everywhere, is in no assignable place except in the montage, which produces it and, moreover, does so contradictorily. Hie universalizing of such a method of montage, affirmed rather than demonstrated by Eisenstein, prefigures a principle of general semiotics at work in the Lacanian reading of Freud as well as in the double system of signification which Benveniste discovers in language, where the mode of significance generated by the discourse accompanies and, in a certain manner, suspends the mode of signifi- cance carried by the sign.^2 The question of meaning is at play precisely in the articulation of these two modes, which, although in an analogical manner, coexist equally in the cinema Eisenstein proposes a form of resolution of these: in the discontinouus flow of images, shot through with tensions, leaps, and breaks, it is the general functioning of the disposition which assigns to each fragment its func- tion, determinable only in its connection to the whole; and if the effacing of the figure derives from its generalization, this last, in its turn, recovers in the sign its distinctive law: none of the representations signify the reality whose appearance it imitates. Constituted in the effacing of the denotation as in the symbolization, the signification derives from the semantic of the ecriture , in which the negation of the sign as a symbol renders a meaning to be constructed in the very process of its production.

Nevertheless, we could notice, in the whole of the second part, the weakened projection of the short/long opposition used in the first part; thus shots 19-24 (the longer dominating) are in opposition to shots 25-27(shorter), while shots 28-29 return to the longer system and shots 30-32 to the shorter system. we interpret shot 29 as the head of a fetish, shot 30 in this case shows the feet and hands which appear to be of the same style as the object in shot 29. 26With the exception, always, of the smoke of the incense which rises in shot 16, whose movement goes counter to that of the plank in shot 31. 27cf. "Perspectives," op . cit., p. 29. 2®That Eisenstein refers to an outdated hypothesis on the origins of language is not important Our purpose is not to examine the historical value of his sources, but to evaluate the consequences which a thesis (utilized in this way) carries for a practice and theory of creation. 29ft is through the statues that the symbolics of the objects and their possible division into two classes is manifestly broken, since they intervene to designate a bourgeois* appurtenance (the decor of the Palace) and at the same time to act as a critic of it, not only in the metaphoric sequences, but also in the so-called diegetic parts: differences emphasized between the defenders of the Palace and the statues which they stand near^-the women's battalion drills beside Rodin's Spring and the student officers march past at the foot of a giant statue on which the Red Guard has climbed (all levels of which it occupies) and prepares for the attack on the Palace: the rapport-men-statues-is now reversed. ^Up to this point we have employed these two terms interchangeably, But in "Montage 1938," in which Eisenstein states his position on his theory, "representation," that is cinematographic material, is opposed to the "image" produced by the montage, which constitutes the sensible equivalent of the concept. Cf. Reflexions d'un cinéaste , Ed. du Progres, Moscou, 1958, p. 78 ff. 31cf. "Montage 1938," op. cit. The statement is taken from a 1929 article, published in the postscript to a book of Nicholas Kaufman on Japanese cinema: cf. "Hors Cadre," Cahiers du Cinema , no. 215, p. 21. 3^Cf. the balancing which Boris Eikhenbaum proposes in 1925 in "La theorie de la méthode formelle" ( Théorie de la littérature , Seuil, 1965, pp. 51-60). 33</page><page sequence="25">33"The unity of the work is not a symmetrical and closed entity, but a dynamic integral which has its own development; its elements are not linked by a sign of equality and accretion, but by a dynamic sign of correlation and integra- tion" ("La notion de construction," 1923, in Theorie de la littérature , op. cit., p. 117). Tynianov has applied this principle to the analysis of montage: "Montage is not the linking of images, it is the differential succession of images, and it is pre- cisely for this reason that images which have a point of correlation between them can follow each other. This correlation can have a bearing not only on the fable but also to a much greater degree on the style."

In the critique addressed to this ideogram- matic conception of cinema, it has been sufficiently noted that it always refers to hieroglyphics which are paired and not isolated. In this perspective, it is the com- bination of representations which produce the sign, and not each representation which is established-symbolically : the cinematographic sign, according to Eisen- stein, exists only abstractly and as a result of an ensemble of concrete givens. 3^See the analysis of it which Derrida gives in an article with the same title, Poe tique, no. 5, pp. 45-52. He sets up the subordination of the syntactic to the semantic as an invariant trait of the concept, and finds in the syntactic resistance one of the ways of the self-destruction of the metaphor, "which always carries its death within itself." It is in this direction which Eisensteinian montage precisely works. 38The image of the chain seems to underlie the comment which Eisenstein makes with regard to an Indian miniature representing Vishnu being carried on an elephant formed by interweaving bodies of virgins. In it he sees the metaphoric representation of the concept of royal transport , realized in a single fragmented image. This text, which dates from 1937 (Oeuvres choisies , Ł II, Moscou, 1964, pp. 353-354) is cited by Ivanov in an article devoted to a poem by Khlebnikov, "On me porte â dos d' elephant," also inspired by this miniature, et Tel Quel , no. 35, pp. 11-12. 39"Le mai voltairien," op. cit., p. 53. 40Ibid., p. 55. 4 ^Tz ve tan Todorov has always shown the implicit projection of a modern theory of symbolics in the ideas of Lévy-Bruhl on primitive language: cf. "Introduc- tion a la symbolique," Poetique, no. 11 pp. 304-307. It is from this theory of symbolics that Eisenstein proceeds, but in order to challenge precisely the fixation on it. 4^e.
