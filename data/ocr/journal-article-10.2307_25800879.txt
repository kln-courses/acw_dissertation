Once its characteristics and ten dencies are documented, it adopts new characteristics, new tenden cies. A researcher observes through a microscope that the eldrit pro pels itself by means of long, translucent flagella. The researcher writes: 26</page><page sequence="2">Seth Fried Flagella, translucent, means of locomotion But as soon as he returns his attention to the eldrit, he finds that it now propels itself by means of a slight undulation of its belly. The flagella, now bright orange, are being used to expel waste. The researcher makes a note of this and then finds that the eldrit in ques tion is suddenly stationary. Its flagella have disappeared altogether. It will most likely be surprising to you that the scientific commu nity has no idea how the eldrit is able to accomplish such dramatic mutations. However, keep in mind that the mechanics of an ant walk ing along the vein of a leaf is enough to make all the technological advancements of the last three centuries look like the output of an eighth grade woodshop: wobbling tables, misspelled signs, precarious rocking horses unevenly stained. Human achievement and under standing are constantly being dwarfed by the complexity of the natu ral world. So how do scientists address this question of the eldrit's ability to alter itself? We step around it, nodding politely as we pass. As a scien tist, it is often the only acceptable method to ignore an impossible question, which, if history serves, will most likely be answered on accident by someone setting out to answer something else. Rather, most research regarding the eldrit is concerned not with how it changes itself, but why. Because if one accepts the assertion that the first priority of all living organisms is self-preservation, then one must conclude that the eldrit's very existence serves as an argu ment that there is something caustic in being identified, in having the boundaries of one's physical and behavioral make-up established. In fact, this seems almost intuitive. Once characteristics of a crea ture are fixed, it is given a role to fill as a result of those characteristics. Through the act of being itself, a creature becomes either the one forced to attach itself as a parasite to a lower intestine, where it will depend on that organ for the most foul sustenance imaginable, or else it becomes the one whose lower intestine is thus infested. Certainly, neither position could be said to inspire envy. But because each crea ture allows itself to be itself, both positions are unavoidable. The evolutionary adaptations that creatures undergo in order to alleviate their circumstances are?at best?only half-solutions 27</page><page sequence="3">The Kenyon Review and?at worst?further provocations of hardship. The haunch muscles that aid the antelope in its flight from predators are also an excellent source of protein. The bear s massive strength also betrays its equally massive capacity to starve to death. But while other creatures change themselves in response to the environmental pressures that affect their various roles, the eldrit seems to change in order to shun the notion that it has a role to fill in the first place. Furthermore, the eldrit does not depend on a Punnett square in order to carry out these changes. Instead, it changes instantly. So in the exact moment that one creature is just beginning to realize, after hundreds of thousands of years of genetic alterations, that an elongated snout is not nearly as useful as perhaps its ancestors had supposed?the eldrit is growing two dozen snouts per minute, stretching them out farther and farther. Just as quickly, the eldrit allows its snouts to fall off and desiccate. Though, before we regard the eldrit's position as being totally advantageous, it should also be mentioned that, on account of its compulsive tendency to change, the eldrit misses out on one of the most pleasing aspects of being a creature, which is, simply put, being a creature. Among all living things, there is a certain joy in being recogniz able as oneself. Even those of us whose bodies are a constant source of apprehension and awkwardness take comfort in seeing our faces in the mirror at the end of the day. As young scientists, you are all no doubt very unattractive. Yet, there is something reassuring in know ing that you have taken a shape, however unfortunate. It is something that is utterly yours, and no matter how miserable you might look while standing in your underwear or how ill at ease you might be in a bathing suit, when you are being honest with yourself, you enjoy your shape; you take solace in it. Think: when people feel dejected and for lorn, they often hold their own heads in their hands. Why do they do this, if not to take consolation in the fact that they have a definite form, that they are in the possession of something entirely their own. This notion that all creatures possess inalienable qualities, which represent an incorruptible sense of self, exists on an evolutionary scale as well. Just look at the transformation of dinosaurs into birds. The dinosaur might not mind diminishing in size or growing wings, but to stop laying eggs? To begin shaping its skeleton differently or its 28</page><page sequence="4">Seth Fried heart? To give up the beautifully vacant eyes of a reptile? The savage waggle of its neck? Unthinkable. That is why researchers are now attempting to determine if, in all the eldrit's responses to the observa tions directed at it, there are any qualities that refuse to change and are quintessentially itself. A common approach is to have a live video feed of an eldrit's magnified image broadcast onto a large monitor where it is then viewed by a room filled with observers, all of whom stare intently at the image and direct as many observations at it as possible. The manic and prolonged ripple of changes that this exercise produces in the eldrit is recorded for posterity and then viewed repeatedly by research ers attempting to establish some sort of constant in the eldrit. The hope is that if a great enough number of observations is directed at a single eldrit for a long enough period of time, the creature will even tually become overwhelmed and begin to falter, inadvertently reveal ing its secret consistencies. No such breakthrough has occurred. As the number of observations directed at an eldrit increase, so does the eldrits ambiguity. On a monitor in an observation room, an eldrit takes on a series of indescribable shapes, splits itself in two, reabsorbs itself, becomes bright pink. It trembles slightly, and then explodes. It reassembles itself. Explodes. Reassembles itself. Explodes. One must admit that even the meekest creature ends up seeming bold in comparison. Consider the gazelle. There is an unmistakable bravery in its implicit admission that, through being a gazelle, it is a gazelle. And even though one can hardly look at its long, delicate neck without immediately thinking of the powerful jaws that will inevita bly snap it in two, the gazelle does not shirk its post. It manages to take responsibility for what it is, while the eldrit can only change unconditionally, a slave to its wild, untouchable freedom. The Kessel The lifespan of an average kessel is four one-hundred-millionths of a second. To put this figure into perspective: If you were to fire a .30 caliber rifle at an opposing target fifty feet away, 462,963 generations of kessel would pass by the time the bullet reached the target. If you were to hold a handkerchief six inches from your nose and sneeze 29</page><page sequence="5">The Kenyon Review into it, 8,522,727 generations of kessel would pass in the time it took for the mucus to reach the handkerchief. But numbers do little to convey the extreme brevity of a kessel's life. Rather, imagine a new born infant flashing from its mother's womb like a lightning bolt and arriving in the doctor's arms as a full-grown skeleton already crum bling to dust. Naturally, observing the kessel is rather difficult. Its death follows its birth so closely that it is impossible to distinguish one process from the other. In fact, the three major acts of a living creature (birth, pro creation, and death) are so compressed in time that the kessel seems to accomplish all three by means of a single exertion. Even the experienced observer, aided by recent technological developments in high-speed photography, will find it impossible to differentiate the characteristics of a dying kessel from one that's just been born or a sexually mature kessel from one not yet fully devel oped, because it is all these things at once. In the kessel, each stage of life informs the other simultaneously. Though strange, this quality of simultaneity should not be con sidered altogether remote from human experience. Who has not occasionally seen death as a weary nod toward birth and vice versa? Who has not occasionally recognized the link between sex and death? Young lovers, as they embrace, are often already able to sense the coming of a private apocalypse in the thumping of their lovers' hearts. Ailing men and women, as they lie on their deathbeds, are often said to feel as if they are being slowly undressed, as if they are expecting a release, which, as it first approaches, is at once frightening, painful, and secretly exhilarating. Throughout the ages, human beings have viewed the transition from birth to sexual maturity to death as a necessary progression. The notion that these things are distinct from one another, that they form a grand narrative, is a social construction that many people have internalized as an indisputable fact. So it is understandable that the existence of the kessel happens to make many people uncomfortable. What kind of parents would want to be told that their newborn child is an aspect of death? Or, worse, that their child has sexual implica tions beyond the gentle copulation that produced it. The manner in which the kessel's existence informs our own can be incredibly disheartening. Its cells begin to form and break down at 30</page><page sequence="6">Seth Fried the same time, and so, when successfully recorded and played back on video streams slowed to infinitesimal proportions, these cells produce a tesseractic movement, folding down into themselves continuously without altering their shape. This motion would be hypnotic if it weren't so brief. Even with the video slowed, the cells disappear in an instant. This sight is, in a word, depressing. It is so abrupt and sense less that it makes the sight of a suicide jumping off a bridge festive in comparison. The amount of time it takes for the suicide to hit the water ends up seeming generous, more than any one person could deserve. It makes us?who are fond of saying to one another under various circumstances that life is, in fact, too short?seem like the worst sort of gluttons. On the other hand, the smallness and brevity of a kessel's exis tence begins to remind one of how small and brief our existence is on a universal scale. Stars die. Galaxies collide. And everything in the universe that is human, the sum of all our ambitions, histories, fears, achievements, and failures exists on the head of a needle. In consideration of the kessel, human nature seems to be open to two conflicting criticisms. The first is that we see our average lifespan as being insufficient, despite the fact that the time afforded to a still born seems decadent when compared to the life of a kessel, and despite the fact that we still find time enough to be bored and to wish for time to move faster. While the second criticism is that we see our average lifespan as sufficient and that the actions contained therein are significant. We flatter ourselves with the assumption that anything of importance can be accomplished in our seventy to eighty years when the earth has been around for billions of years and has been known to change dominant species as if they were hats. Our pity for the kessel is revealed as naive in that, if you judge a kessel's existence by the amount of time that elapses in the human world and judge a human's existence by the amount of time that elapses in the universe, then we disappear from our surroundings even faster than the kessel disappears from its own. This is particularly disconcerting because, though at odds, both arguments seem valid. And so, along with the already grim content of these criticisms, comes the hurtful reminder that human beings are riddled with absurdities and contradictions even with respect to something as simple as our faults.</page><page sequence="7">The Kenyon Review The whole issue of the kessel as it relates to our existence is ulti mately filled with so much unmitigated glumness that many consider it to be an inappropriate topic for polite conversation. Details regard ing the kessel are among the type of cold-hearted facts that are inevi tably mentioned at parties by angry young men, who wish to impress upon anyone who seems to be having more fun than themselves that the world is, in fact, little more than a brutal joke. Most researchers who specialize in the kessel end up adopting this air of arrogance and scorn. They are typically unkempt, wild-looking. Their faces are rav aged by distrust, and they are always ready with a discouraging remark. It makes sense that researchers who watch that sad footage again and again?the kessel fluttering briefly and then vanishing?would eventually give in to despair. Further, it makes sense that those who are confronted on a daily basis by those criticisms of our nature men tioned above would eventually begin to despise our nature. But based on their studies of the kessel, these people are ready to conclude that everything we hold dear is futile and amounts to nothing. However, the fact remains that such a view of the kessel and of human nature is incomplete. For example, the kessel mates for life. At first, this might seem unimpressive, owing to the fact that life for a kessel is a brisk four one hundred-millionths of a second. But because it is sexually mature even before it is born, the average kessel spends a greater percentage of its lifetime with its mate than any other creature on earth, a rela tionship which is strictly monogamous and, again more than any other creature on earth, most resembles our understanding of roman tic love. Granted, some researchers argue that it maintains one mate because it simply does not have the time to take on another. Dr. Richard Koch?unkempt and wild-looking, Koch is a preeminent figure among the kessel specialists mentioned briefly above?is a strong proponent of this theory. In a recent study, Koch examined the mating practices of the kessel, focusing on the kessel's speed and urgency in an attempt to establish its promiscuity. But Koch's own study contains evidence to the contrary. Buried in indexes and supplemental figures are instances of kessel who chose somewhat older mates, outlived them, and then spent the rest of their 32</page><page sequence="8">Seth Fried short lives in mourning. In fact, this is rather common. A kessel that is two one-hundred-billionths of a second old might select a mate that is one one-hundred-millionths of a second old. When the latter dies, the former does not seek a replacement but spends the rest of its life in solitude. There are also instances of kessel, which, seeking an ideal mate, have waited in absolute celibacy a staggering three one hundred-millionths of a second. These instances of self-imposed isolation are remarkable, espe cially when one considers the fact that the kessel tends to crave desper ately the company of its own kind. Experiments have been conducted in which a single specimen has been separated from a larger group by a tenth of a millimeter. These experiments show that the lone kessel will spend its entire life moving back toward its fellows despite the fact that a tenth of a millimeter?for a creature, which, in addition to being so small and short-lived, is not particularly fast?is like the dis tance between two stars. In some primal fashion, the kessel must understand that that is an impossible distance. And yet, it persists. So, yes, it's true: the universe is massive, whereas we are small and quickly fading. But things are never as hopeless as people like Koch would have you believe. There are still opportunities for happiness for those willing to accept existence for what it is. Even a creature like the kessel seems to understand the transformative capabilities of some thing as simple as affection. It fixates on companionship in what seems like deliberate ignorance of the fact that it is surrounded by larger and larger worlds. When it finally finds its mate, the kessel exhausts its life in that purest intimacy, without a care, as its one moment goes rushing past. The Principles of Observation In the same way that it is difficult to think of a distant planet as being an actual place?as real as the ground beneath your feet?it is often difficult to think of most animalcula as being actual creatures. Like a planet viewed through a telescope, one tends to recognize an animal culum viewed through a microscope not as a thing, but as an image of a thing. Though both instruments manipulate reality in only the most rudimentary fashion, bringing objects closer or making them larger, we still understand that what we are seeing is a deception. Our minds 33</page><page sequence="9">The Kenyon Review take in what is seen by means of those instruments with the same reflexive disbelief with which we have learned to greet the computer generated monsters in the summer blockbuster, the map of Texas behind the meteorologist, the digitally altered photograph in a maga zine of JFK drinking a Pepsi. At this point in history, a healthy sense of skepticism with respect to images is increasingly necessary. Otherwise, every single soap com mercial would break our hearts. Every advertisement featuring a beautiful woman lying on a white-sanded beach in the ecstasy of whatever product would corrupt us not only with a desire for that product but also with the belief that our life is pale and undesirable, something that needs desperately to be fixed. And so we lean on our skepticism as if for balance. We roll our eyes at that woman on the beach. We hold at arm's length all the deliberately phony images of the every day, the pervasiveness of which so harasses us that we are no longer able to differentiate false images from true ones. Likewise, when students first observe the characteristics of an animalculum through a microscope, it is as if they are only taking note of the ridiculous assurances in yet another commercial or pars ing a news broadcast for its biases and inconsistencies. Even those few students who do feel a connection with their subject [SEE DAWSON] will readily admit to the limitations and frustrations that are involved in dedicating oneself to what is, for all practical purposes, little more than a moving picture. However, before you allow this skepticism to taint your research, keep in mind that your own vision manipulates reality more than any microscope ever could. Far less distortion takes place between the objective lens and eye piece of a microscope than takes place in your own mind when you stare at your feet in the bath. This is by no means an exaggeration: your mind interprets the retinal input of your feet soaking in the tub by means of a complex system of inference, using its accumulated knowledge of how far away from your eyes your feet tend to be, of where the source of light in your bathroom tends to come from, of how light tends to move through soapy water. In short, your mind cross-checks all the combinations that could create this retinal input against the input's given context, so that what you expe rience as the image of your own feet has less to do with the reality of your feet at that moment than it does with your brain's efforts to pro vide you with an image that makes sense. 34</page><page sequence="10">Seth Fried So if the era in which you live has made you skeptical with respect to manipulated images, then you must accept that this skepticism applies to the visual world as a whole, and that there is no real differ ence between a computer-animated dinosaur and your own hand held out in front of your face. After embracing this, you have two options: 1.) You can reject everything and regard the world as a baseless fiction, or 2.) You can take the information that your senses give you, albeit incomplete and interpretive, and attempt to derive from it rules and principles. You can accept the fact that science is an operation of faith, and that in order to participate in it you must first reject the fear that a false image could make you foolish. The Halifite Before the discovery of the halifite, the scientific community was in agreement that an emotion was a response to a state of being. In the same way that the concept of time is used to keep track of objects moving through space, it was believed that the purpose of emotion was to help individuals keep track of themselves as they moved from one state of being to another. Just as it is easier to delineate one's phys ical existence by means of the artificial units of hours, minutes, and seconds?quantities which are significant only because they have been widely agreed upon?our prehalifite understanding of emotion maintained that quantities such as happiness and sadness were like wise only artificial, convenient points of reference. This view of emotion as a mechanical response to the progress of our fortunes seems immediately naive to those of us who experience emotions on a daily basis. Contemporary readers, such as yourselves, will have difficulty understanding how the prehalifite view was ever taken seriously. However, before you condemn those who came before you for their ignorance, keep in mind that without the insights afforded to us by the halifite, the prehalifite view would still be unas sailable fact. From the water cycle to the validity of bivalent protein substructs, everything seems like common sense once it has been established. The halifite tends to be found on the bodies of large mammals. Subsisting on dead skin cells, it goes generally unnoticed. It is oval in 35</page><page sequence="11">The Kenyon Review shape with a pale-blue outer cuticle. It most resembles and is often mistaken for an exceptionally small variety of dust mite. However, in addition to its size, the halifite is distinguished by its uncanny ability to emote. One does not have to observe a halfite for long before it begins to exhibit behavior that is altogether singular and which, to the uniniti ated, might seem delightful. A halifite stands upright on the tip of an eyelash while happily doing a sort of soft-shoe routine. Another hali fite is on its knees, beating its chest and pulling melodramatically at its antennae. These exhibitions of emotion tend to be entertaining to lay observers in the same perverse and universal way that it is often considered funny to see a farm animal dressed in women's clothing or a dog smoking a pipe. Halifitic expressions of emotion contain ele ments of the same mad-cap anthropomorphism which is the ruling principle of Saturday morning cartoons and children's books. For this reason, much like the ridiculous-looking frilled-neck lizard and the overtly adorable panda cub, images of halifite have become a staple for the covers of elementary school science textbooks in their bela bored attempts to convince children that science can be fun. But presenting the halifite's behavior to students in this way dras tically undermines its importance. It is also extremely disrespectful to the inner experience of such a sensitive creature. Not pictured on the cover of those textbooks are all the halifite that, overwhelmed by their own emotional experience, have hanged themselves to death from a host's earlobe or deliberately bashed their own heads open on a patch of dry skin. When studying the halifite, keep in mind that there is no difference between its joys and your joys, between its sorrows and your sorrows. If you perceive a difference, what is it? That the halifite is small? That it does not have language or a higher intellect? Don't be a snob. Feeling is feeling. Also, remember that it is only on account of the halifite's inner experience that we are beginning to better under stand our own. In this respect, the halifite initially seems to confirm the idea that emotion is a direct response to a state of being. That is, the halifite seems to use its emotions as a way of processing external stimuli in a way that adheres to common sense. Pleasant stimuli correspond to happiness, unpleasant stimuli to sadness. 36</page><page sequence="12">Seth Fried Example: An adult, female halifite returns to her nest to find that her eggs have been destroyed by a competitor. The halifite probes the ruined eggs with her antennae and shows obvious signs of mourning. However, when the observer increases the level of magnifica tion, the emotion exhibited by the halifite in question suddenly changes. In response to the demise of her eggs, the halifite is now expressing a guarded sense of relief, as if she has been freed from a tremendous burden. When the level of magnification is increased again, the halifite is consumed with guilt. As the magnification is increased again, the halifite is convulsing in a kind of laughter, which is unmistakably at her own expense. As the magnification is increased again, the halifite is bowing her head toward the destroyed eggs in the grips of some bizarre and reverent joy. As the magnifica tion is increased yet again, the halfite's expression is frozen in a mask of grotesque horror. With every incremental adjustment to the level of magnification, the observer will discover a new, discernible emotion in the halifite. The emotion being expressed at the lowest level of magnification?in this case, mourning?is actually a composite of all the emotions being expressed at the greater levels of magnification. Far from a being pure, clear-cut phenomenon, the halifite shows us that a single observable emotion is really only the most obvious facet of the com plex interplay between all possible emotions. On account of this insight, many inner-events which would have been regarded as insane under the prehalifite view are now under stood to be perfectly natural. In an unexpected moment, the widow laughs into the casket. The businessman grieves over his profits. The assassin swoons for the king. Our emotions never wholly reflect our state of being, because we are experiencing every possible emotion at all times, just in varying proportions. So it is when we are sad that our happiness most surprises us. It is when we are pleased that our sad ness most perplexes us. It is when we are prepared to slit the king s throat that our love for him is the most startling. But if emotion is not a direct response to our state of being, then what function does it serve? This question that the prehalifite view perceived as being so crucial is, of course, ridiculous. It neglects the fact that the universe is a hairy, tangled mess filled with purposeless 37</page><page sequence="13">The Kenyon Review digressions, of which our entire emotional framework is most likely just one among the uncountable. At any rate, be wary of those who would attempt to judge things solely by their function. The world is not an implement. We must begin to approach the idea that, perhaps, emotion exists for emotion's sake, and that what makes our inner-events so intense and manifestly difficult to understand is that the end toward which all emotion is moving is unknown even to its own components. And if this uncertainty troubles you or leaves you feeling depressed, then examine your feelings carefully and take note of the fact that you are also thrilled by it. The Kirklin All kirklin currently occupy a space no larger than an acorn. This arrangement should be impossible, as there are currently ninety-five trillion kirklin in existence, and each is roughly the size of a grain of rice. The compression of their entire species into such a small space is an incredible feat, and, in terms of understanding it, the scientific community is at a loss. In 1988, a physicist at Yale by the name of Dr. Josephine Klemp attempted to duplicate the kirklin's compression using two hundred thousand popsicle sticks in a pressurized chamber. The resulting explosion killed the thirty-eight graduate students who had been working under Klemp and destroyed the better part of Yale's historic Abbot Building where the study was located. Klemp was not in the lab when the explosion occurred and went on to publish a somewhat controversial paper based on the data she collected regarding the force with which the popsicle sticks had blown through the skulls of her former assistants. While many found the paper to be in poor taste, the fact is that by extrapolating that data and applying it to the kirklin, Klemp was the first to raise the question of the potential force that might be implicit in the kirklin's compression. Klemp pointed out that because the level of compression achieved in her study was only a fraction of that which exists within the kirklin population cluster, the explosion that occurred in her study was only a fraction of what would result if the cluster were to suffer a similar instability. In short, Klemp raised the fear that a kirklinic explosion 38</page><page sequence="14">Seth Fried would cause our entire planet to share a fate similar to that of Yale's Abbot Building. However, over the years, many experts have argued against this view. Prominent physicist Dr. Quentin Butler describes Klemp's explosion theory as foolishness. According to Butler, the notion that Klemp's compression of popsicle sticks is any way analogous to the current state of the kirklin is unfounded. Butler contends that given the extreme density of the kirklin cluster, the creatures are far more likely to implode, creating a giant black hole that would consume our solar system and go on to gnaw away at the surrounding universe. Others maintain that Butler's view is no more realistic than Klemp's. Dr. Alfonzo Delgado, former director of the Conklin Institute, derides both views as pseudo-scientific. He claims it is far more likely that instability in the kirklin cluster would spark a chain reaction, in which the kirklin would cause everything that came in contact with it to become similarly compressed. Dr. Marie Cabot Berger, at the Trevor Laboratories, describes a theory in which the kirklin might corrupt the vacuum of space, causing the entire uni verse to disappear at the speed of light. While opinion varies greatly as to how it would happen, all experts seem to be unanimous in the assumption that the kirklin is on the brink of ending the world. The popular press has seized on this anxi ety, and every two weeks there is a new theory being put forth in which the kirklin will destroy life as we know it. And while some theo ries are more difficult to disprove than others, it is important to remember in each case that because what is being feared is without precedent, there can ultimately be no real evidence to support it. What is being expressed in these conjectures is simply the natural human fear of catastrophe, the perennial concern that the sky will fall, that the earth will open up, that all the aspects of the universe that we cannot control will finally come to bear. These fears are ancient, and science has simply put new words to them, given them a new, com pressed shape. The Role of Creativity in Science If a stranger were to approach you with a box of crayons and ask you to draw a clown, how would you respond? Would you pluck out a 39</page><page sequence="15">The Kenyon Review crayon at random and draw a stick figure, adding only a few wholesale gestures meant to indicate in the laziest, most basic way possible that what you have drawn is a clown?large circular feet, the hurried scribble of a fright wig? Or, worse, would you scorn the exercise alto gether? Would you roll your eyes, as if to suggest that drawing a clown is beneath you, that your very inability to perform such a task stands as proof that you have dedicated yourself to far worthier, far more challenging pursuits? If either of these reactions seems plausible to you or correct, then you are not a scientist. Nor is it likely that you will ever become one. However, if, despite the fact that you are not a gifted artist, you try to draw a clown with enthusiasm, if you ask the stranger with his box of crayons to be patient while you carefully determine which colors you will use, if you approach the absurd names of the cray ons?Antique Brass, Aztec Gold, Electric Lime, Jazzberry Jam, Smokey Topaz?not as examples of obscene cutesiness but as units of a true and exhaustive taxonomy, signifying fundamental compo nents of expression which will need to be deliberately selected and arranged so as to achieve the perfect image of CLOWN, if you manage to come up with a handful of creative flourishes?the distinctive head of a seltzer bottle, a bright pair of button suspenders, a certain, waggish look on the clown's face?which, despite your aforemen tioned lack of artistic talent, not only evoke the viewer's concept of CLOWN but enrich that concept?then you are most definitely a sci entist. Congratulations. To pursue a career in science, the level of reflexive creativity described above must be the foundation of your personality. The rea son for this is that science does not take place in the physical world but in the framework of your mind. Example: You are watching a combination of chemicals sputter and foam in a dish. As you do so, you are confronted with a mental image of a floating placard upon which is written the formula for the chemical reaction that is just now taking place in the dish. This for mula is either written in the penmanship of a long-forgotten teacher as it was first glimpsed on a chalkboard years ago or else simply in the indescribable scrawl of your own thoughts. Whatever the case, it is this placard, containing that formula, which helps you to distinguish the sputtering taking place in that dish from all other sputterings. 40</page><page sequence="16">Seth Fried What's more, all the sensory details attached to this chemical reaction?the bright white foam, the sound of a gentle crackling, the pinched, acrid smell?are not taking place in the physical world, which cannot see or hear or smell. All these things are taking place in your mind. So the act of observing the contents of this dish involves interplay between at least two abstractions: 1.) The floating placard and 2.) Your mind's interpretation of the physical world. It is for this reason that science depends on creativity, because grasping the relationship between abstractions is essentially a creative act. Such mental dexterity depends on the same imaginative leaps of faith as art, the same lightning-strike intuition, the same ability to draw connections between dissonant quantities. "That's all well and good," one might say, "but do you mean to suggest from this that when approached by a strange man and asked to draw a clown, I must automatically submit myself to his whim?" Yes! You must! It is not enough that scientists be creative only when it suits them. Unlike the artist, whose creativity is narrow and self interested, a scientist's creativity must be all-consuming. Childlike tasks must be immediately appealing, because the way in which a sci entist approaches the world must be the result of a sense of wonder that is intrinsically childlike. When you take a young boy to the zoo, he wants to know every thing. Looking at the gorilla, he asks you what kind of things the gorilla eats. But before you can answer, he asks you who is responsible for feeding the gorilla. What's more, he asks you if that person has a family, and, if so, where do they live. The boy wants to know if there are any children his age in this family and where do they go to school. Also, he asks, who made the gorilla's cage? How did the people who made the cage know that it would be able to withstand a gorilla? Does the gorilla like it here? Why am I a little boy and not a gorilla? When you inevitably lose your patience with the boy and tell him to stop asking you these questions that you perceive to be pointless, the silence that follows will be loaded and urgent as he does his best to hold back his unyielding necessity to look at the world and ask how and for what reason. Likewise, a scientist must confront the world with questions hanging off questions hanging off questions. 4i</page><page sequence="17">The Kenyon Review Now, draw a clown: The Ernoth The social order that exists between all ernoths is incredibly complex. There are countless parallel and overlapping hierarchies within which ernoths are all constantly gaining or losing power. Because they are all more or less the same, when an ernoth elevates its status it is through sheer confidence. Likewise, it can only diminish in status on account of its own anxiety and doubt. This confidence level does not depend on its temperament but simply on its position within its given hierar chy. The ernoths in the lower echelons are all convinced that they belong at the top, whereas the elite ernoths are nagged by fears that they secretly belong at the bottom. It is for this reason that an ernoth never holds a position in a hierarchy for long, as its current posi tion?whether in power or out?is always a source of anxiety. The only thing that changes is in what direction that anxiety is compelling it to strive. The Lasar Bloodshed between species is constant and essential. Without it, pred ators would starve for want of food, and prey would collapse under the weight of their ever-expanding populations. However, violence within a single species is comparatively rare. When it occurs, it is typically restrained and ritualized. For instance, a rattlesnake does not make use of its deadly poison when fighting another rattlesnake. Instead, it will wrestle with its opponent in a predetermined ceremony, in which each snake harmlessly attempts to pin the other to the ground. 42</page><page sequence="18">Seth Fried So while rattlesnakes will not hesitate to kill an unsuspecting child or a curious dog, when it comes to one rattlesnake pitted against another, the two will typically choose to settle the thing like gentlemen. The same is true when two elk deliberately clap antlers or when two elephants lock tusks or when an African saplid emp ties its ink pouch onto a rock adjacent to a competing saplid's egg mound. Unrestrained conflict between animals of the same species is not unheard of, but, through the logic of natural selection, it is far from being the rule. In addition to the fact that it is a costly expenditure of energy, the risk of being seriously injured is as real for the attacker as it is for the animal being attacked. If such conflict can be avoided, most creatures do just that. However, a notable exception to this is the lasar. A stout, round little creature, it will attempt to kill any other lasar it comes into con tact with by ramming into it repeatedly. Since the other lasar will con duct itself in the exact same way, the probability of any lasar surviving one of these contests is roughly the same as a coin toss. Existence, for the lasar, is little more than a succession of purposeless murders end ing inevitably in its own. The ritualized fighting of other creatures is typically attached to disputes over territory, resources, and sexual dominance, whereas the all-out conflict that exists between lasar is attached to none of these. Therefore, the lasar is thought to be the only creature on earth other than man capable of governing itself by means of an ideology?by which it is simply meant that its behavior has somehow been elevated above common sense. There is no way to determine the content of the lasar's ideology, as ideologies, in general, have no content. They are only indications of a failure to incorporate oneself into the natural world. That the lasar insists on killing other lasar is merely an example of this kind of fail ure. Unsurprisingly, it is an endangered species. This is seemingly of its own accord, and the fact that there might one day be no more lasar to speak of seems less the result of its shortsightedness than of what ever vague promise it perceives in its own vicious and unstoppable cruelty. 43</page><page sequence="19">The Kenyon Review The Fear of Error There is no greater boon to a young scientist than a healthy fear of error. If you double- and triple-check your measurements, if you anx iously reexamine your calculations, it is because you believe that your research is important. In turn, people who claim to be fearless are only saying that they do not consider anything they do to be impor tant. Such people are doomed to wander the earth like ghosts, listless and vacant. After all, fear is a natural consequence of hope. The rea son that fearful people are ultimately the best scientists is that they are all secretly filled with the hope that their research will answer some fundamental question. They nurture in themselves the desire for their work to produce some tremendous breakthrough, for their efforts to unlock singlehandedly the next wing of human history. With this ambition comes the inevitable fear that their work could possibly be meaningless, that their lives up to that point have been histories of unflinching error. The Paglum The paglum is compelled to imitate whatever creature is closest to it. If you place one in a specimen dish next to a kyrnsite, an animalcu lum known to propel itself by the awkward groping of its crablike claws, the paglum?though clawless?will begin moving its slender, delicate legs in a manner which evokes perfectly the clumsy, disorga nized scramble of the kyrnsite. If you place that same paglum next to a feltspire, a tight little ball of a creature known for its tendency to zip quickly from one place to the next, the paglum will gently curl its body in on itself in order to appear similarly compact. And though it is not as fast as the feltspire, it will stretch its antennae in the direction opposite to the one in which it is moving, as if, propelling itself at incredible speeds, its antennae are being blown back. During these imitations, the paglum does not alter its physical appearance radically. In fact, what is so remarkable is how subtly it is able to depict its fellow creatures. The paglum singles out defining movements, unconscious gestures. It is this sense of nuance in the paglum's mimicry that distinguishes its behavior from other crea tures known to engage in similar behavior. Unlike the stick-bug or the 44</page><page sequence="20">Seth Fried chameleon, it is not the goal of the paglum to disguise itself. And while its impressions are uncanny, no one would ever mistake it for anything other than a paglum. It is because its performances are never wholly convincing that they are so compelling to watch. An impressionist in a nightclub does not transform completely into the impressionee. Such an act would be more startling than entertaining. Rather, the impressionist arranges his or her own features in a way that cleverly characterizes something essential about the impressionee. What is remarkable about this feat is that the features being used to evoke the impressionee are recogniz able at all times as belonging to the impressionist. The personality of the paglum, like that of a good impressionist, remains present even as it takes on the characteristics of another creature. The paglum seems to understand that what is pleasing about an impression is not what is included, but what is deliberately left out. In other words, an impression reveals to us how much of reality can be discarded with reality still being successfully expressed. In the end, an impression is not a depiction of reality, but a seeing-through, a shutting-out of everything that is not essential. In this sense, seeing the paglum do a spot-on imitation of a klempate or a feltspire is rather freeing. As if you were in a nightclub, watching some desperate, ugly little man in a powder-blue tuxedo flawlessly impersonate a mat inee idol, you will experience a sense of exhilaration as you observe the paglum. Your first instinct will be to applaud. The Adornus Because there is only one adornus in existence, studying it is ulti mately pointless. Without the benefit of observing more than one specimen, there is no way to determine whether it is acting in a way that is natural to its kind or in a way that is specific to this adornus in particular. Certainly, it is a vibrant little creature and there is a great deal of behavior to describe, but why bother? The only thing of value that can be said is that the adornus is unique in the purest sense of the word. By way of comparison, what we praise as uniqueness and indi viduality among human beings is, upon serious consideration, only an improvisation that exists within set parameters. And while it is 45</page><page sequence="21">The Kenyon Review possible for our improvisations to be wonderfully rich and complex, our capacity to be dissimilar from one another has definite limits. What's more, in order for a person to be recognized as being an individual, that person has to have a great deal in common with the group that he or she is attempting to be distinguished from. This may seem counterintuitive, but consider the words hot and cold in relation to one another. Both are adjectives referring to extreme temperatures. The reason that we recognize these words as being opposite of one another is that except for one distinction their meaning is identical. Likewise, in order for a person to stand out as an individual that per son must first adhere to an untold number of social conventions. If anyone were to be purely unique, that person's existence would no longer make sense to us. That is why studying the adornus is useless. If there is no context to judge its behavior against, no conventions for it to adhere to or reject, then it is impossible for anything it does to have meaning. The Perigite The large green rings that circle the earth are still a relatively new development, but it is already difficult to imagine the sky without them. Those two broad rings that intersect one another like the gim bals of a gyroscope are now as commonplace a sight overhead as the flight of birds. Already forgotten is the widespread anxiety that occurred when those rings first appeared?a strange, claustrophobic feeling as the once wide-open sky was suddenly imposed upon by those immense swaths of green. The initial sense the rings provoked was that the living world was being hemmed in. Now, of course, we know the exact opposite to be true. Unlike the rings of cosmic dust that circle the gas giants of our solar system, the earth's newly formed rings are comprised entirely of small creatures called perigites. These are the first organisms known to migrate successfully outside of the earth's atmosphere. So while the impression one first had was of the living world being closed off, it is now understood that these large bands are a sign that life has begun to expand out into the universe. The common reaction to this fact was excitement. It was, after all, a triumph for the race of the living. The perigite had learned to thrive 46</page><page sequence="22">Seth Fried in a new medium just as our animal predecessors had risen up out of the sea and learned to live on dry land. Life, it was generally agreed, was marching forward, was preparing itself to populate the universe with its creative might. However, within this celebratory mood, it was difficult to deny the simultaneous realization that, in this next glorious stage of life, mankind was being left behind. As earth's dominant species, we had up until that point assumed that life's potential for progress rested on our shoulders. But once the nature of the perigite was understood, it became quite clear that this potential rested elsewhere. Just as we tend to look back with pity and condescension on all the creatures that are still bound to the ocean, we as a people began to understand that the next stage of life would look back in the same way on us, still bound to this floating palace of dirt. That is why, though the sight of those rings is quite common, many still tend to regard them curiously. Naturally, as a species, our thoughts are conflicted. On one hand, we feel usurped and irrelevant. Excluded, and jealous. Yet, we also cannot help but maintain that first touch of pride we experienced upon learning of life's great journey out into the universe. Despite ourselves, we regard those far-off rings affectionately. We wish them well. 47</page></plain_text>
