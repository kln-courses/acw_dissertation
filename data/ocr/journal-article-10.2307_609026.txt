<plain_text><page sequence="1">Some Prosodic Aspects of Retroflexion and Aspiration in Sanskrit By W. S. ALLEN U NDER the traditional titles of Assimilation and Dissimilation, we are presented with two linguistic phenomena apparently involving a principle similar to that which is known in physical science as " action at a distance "- regularly in the latter case, occasionally in the former (under special titles, such as " dilation ", " Fernassimilation "). The classical example of this type of assimilation is provided by the Sanskrit " cerebralization " (nati) of n,1 with reference to which the term " action a distance " has, in fact, been used.2 In connection with the physical principle, it may be of interest to recall Newton's words:- "It is inconceivable that inanimate brute matter should, without the mediation of something else which is not material, operate upon and affect other matter without mutual contact." Speech-sound, of course, is not " brute matter ", and it would be a dangerous and unnecessary principle to submit linguistics to physical criteria, but Newton's uneasiness may at least serve to lead us to a reconsideration of similar postulates of our own science. Amongst these the conception of an articulation A at one point in the temporal dimension 3 exercising a form of " gravitational influence" upon an articulation B at a distant point would appear to be one that is only tolerable faute de mieux. The whole principle of assimilation in descriptive linguistics has already been assailed more than once, on the ground that the implied change is only metaphorical, having reference to a hypothetical " basic " form 4 derived from the consideration of other contexts or of earlier stages of the language,5 and leading to such definitions as " the extension of an element of articulation out- side its proper sphere ".6 However, whilst fully agreeing that we cannot accept the imputation of improper behaviour to any element of utterance, I shall not call upon the support of this general argument in the present discussion, which considers only how, in two particular instances, we may best eliminate the unrealistic postulate of distant influence: such conceptions are especially common in the description of ancient languages, and the two examples here chosen are both from Sanskrit. For assimilation I shall discuss the case already mentioned, and for dissimilation the Sanskrit half of " Grassmann's Law ", 1 Cf. Brugmann, Grundriss, i, ? 973; Grammont, Traite de Phonetique3, p. 251, both of which give this example pride of place. 2 Bloch, L'Indo-Aryen, p. 56; cf.

Soc., 1948. The law which states the conditions for n &gt; n after r, r, r, s --one of the more imposing " Rules of Internal Sandhi "-is only too well-known; as stated in the Pratisakhyas 2 and by Panini,3 and as perpetuated in our European grammars, it is that (within a word):- (, r, r, s, in spite of intervening vowels, gutturals (including h), labials (including v), y and Anusvara, change n to n if followed by vowels, n, m, y, v." 4 The complexity of this rule is considerably reduced by a " physiological explanation " such as that of Whitney,5 namely that " in the marked proclivity of the language toward lingual utterance " the retroflex tongue-position assumed for r, r, r, 6 is maintained until a following n (&gt; n) :- "unless the proclivity is satisfied by the utterance of a lingual mute, or the organ is thrown out of adjustment by the utterance of an element which causes it to assume a different posture ". This physiological statement (which, incidentally, is implied by one at least of the ancient Indian treatises 7) also provides us with a link between the active and the passive members of the assimilation, namely a tongue-position, a " point d'articulation ", thus satisfying the Newtonian demand for a mediating factor: as a descriptive statement, however, we shall see that it still has grave shortcomings. If retroflexion is now abstracted as a prosody it may be stated that the presence of the prosody of retroflexion is marked in the traditional linear transcription by a series of special letters (t, th, d, dh, n, s) ; so that, symbolizing the prosody by R 8 (and eliminating the special "retroflex" letters), we R R find R orthographically represented by patha-, u d by upanisad, etc. patha- r upanisad is denoted simply by rtu- and tra by mdtra-, etc., since r, r, r invariably ortu- m 'tra- correlate with the R-prosody. Sanskrit spelling, in spite of the syllabic basis of the system of writing is, in American terminology, largely "phonemic "-that is to say, if a modern "phonemicist " set out to produce an orthography for Sanskrit, the resulting 1 The " dot-and-dash " system of transliteration (n for ir, etc.), though highly undesirable in phonetic discussion, is here retained as being in general use by Sanskritists. 2 RV., v. 42 and 56; A V., iii. 75; Tait., xiii. 6; Vdj., iii. 83 and 94. 3 VIII. iv. 1 ff. 4 Macdonell, Sanskrit Grammar, ? 65.

The result is that in some degree we are enabled to see the extent of the linear projection of the prosody; thus R R is-ta- is represented by ista-, suggesting i:a- ; is-ta- ista- R R tad dayate " t taddayate, taddayate; R R tan , dim g "tdndzmbhdn - 7 tan dimbhan ' , ", tandimbhan. The orthography suggests that this extension is particularly wide in the special case considered, namely where the marker is r, r, r, s,3 i.e. other than a stop, and is followed by phonological n, the natyaksara par excellence,4 under the conditions already stated, e.g.: 1 As may be seen in part from Professor M. B. Emeneau's " The Nasal Phonemes of Sanskrit ", Language, xxii, 1946, pp. 86 if., with the findings of which I am in agreement; cf. also A. H. Fry, "A Phonemic Interpretation of Visarga," Language, xvii, 1941, pp. 194 ff. 2 Cf. J. Vachek, Acta Linguistica v, p. 92 f. 3 Skt. s is in many cases the reflex of IE *s by a process or processes marked at an early period not only by r, r, but also by i, u, k, and it might be objected that in examples such as nisanna- the marker is thus not s but i. There are, however, good reasons for rejecting this argument: the following facts are relevant:- (a) From the physiological point of view it is difficult to conceive why a process of retro- flexion should be associated with the diverse units i, u, k. (b) Parallel processes, with identical markers, are attested in Iranian and Slavonic. (c) The reflex of (b) is not, as in Skt., s (J), but Av. s (J), O.C.S. ch (x). From (b) it follows that the beginnings of the process(es) are to be put back at least to the Indo-Iranian period. A possible interpretation of (a) + (c) is that the reflex of IE *s at this period varied according to the various markers (? iq, UXw, rg, kx)-cf. also Morgenstierne, " The Language of the Ashkun Kafirs," Norsk Tidsskr. f. Sprogvidenskap, ii, 1929, p. 199 f., Entwhistle, TPS., 1944, p. 33 f. The reasons for the ultimate " phonemic divorce " of these variants from s, and their convergence to Skt. s, Av. s, O.C.S. ch (as also the development *kt &gt; Skt. st, Av. st) are probably to be sought in the total phonological systems of the respective languages. Thus, by the time of our attested Skt., the units i, u, k, could no longer be treated as markers of a process: in sequences of the type is, etc., s, not i, was now the marker (viz. of the prosody of retroflexion), and we may therefore, in the present problem, treat it as parallel to r. Where a process *i + s ~&gt;is, etc., appears to be active in the attested language (e.g. in new composition) it is to be explained as the result of " structural pressure " from inherited forms, intensified by the canonization of an observed phenomenon to the status of a Sandhi Law; its lack of physiological justification is at least hinted at by anomalous forms such as avastambh-, pratistambh-, and the sandhi agnis te, beside Vedic agnis te, etc. 4 As shown by its development in Middle Indian (cf.

Rrabhyamana-, ,, drabhya-mana-, " " " Jrabhyamn na-. But if we remember that the rules of Sandhi are really rules for Sanskrit spelling, we shall not expect to find that the orthography tells us the whole story. We may suspect, for instance, that in pdtha- the retroflexion was present also in the vowel preceding the th,1 and might be considered as potentially present even in the initial bilabial stop; so that such a word could in fact be used to give a " word-palatogram " 2 in which the retroflex " wipe ", though actually produced during the phonation of the retroflex stop, would represent a process of the whole word, the remaining articulations being palatographically non-interfering. But since it had not been found necessary to have a symbol for a', etc., in the syllabary (in phonemic parlance, since a' was an allophone, not a phoneme),3 this is not represented; thus the extension of the prosody is, in fact, only partially marked by spellings such as ista-, nisanna-, etc. This is indeed a minor phonetic imprecision, but in the case of sequences such as brahmd, where the physiological explanation would lead us to expect (probably with justification) R R something in the nature of , , or even i I the orthography is very brahmd, brahmd, far from specifying the phonetic or the prosodic state of affairs. We have therefore to recognize that in its representation of non-phonematic features the orthography is misleading, its tendency to be over-specific resulting in an erratic and hence unreliable precision. And since it is only in the interests of this orthography that the sandhi rules are operative,4 any statement which confines itself to explaining those rules adds nothing to the description of the lan- guage as spoken. We may therefore be forgiven for losing a little of the awe which is traditionally accorded to the Sanskrit system of spelling, and in envisaging the possibility of new methods of statement in any phonological reconsideration of the language: for such linguistic purposes the representations (considering only R R R R R the R-prosody) puspam, nisanna-, drabhyamdna-, iksaka-, prakalpana- hav the following advantages over nisanna-, etc.:- 1 Cf. the pronunciation of Hindi path, where distinct retroflexion is heard in the vowel. 2 On word-palatograms and their uses see J. R. Firth, " Word-palatograms and Articulation," BSOAS., xii, 1948, pp. 857 ff. 3 Cf. also Daniel Jones' distinction between assimilation and " similitude " (Outline, ? 835 if.). 4 In view of the still vexed problem as to the date of the earliest writing of Sanskrit, and hence its relationship to the more ancient grammatical and phonetic treatises, it may be advisable to interpret " orthography " in a wider sense than is usual, i.e. as extending, if such a thing is possible, to a system of phonemic " oral spelling " antedating the use of any script. 942</page><page sequence="5">SOME PROSODIC ASPECTS OF RETROFLEXION AND ASPIRATION IN SANSKRIT 943 (i) They do not specify, with wholly doubtful fidelity, the linear extension of R, but leave this to study at the proper phonetic level 1 (e.g. the fact that an ZR example such as was utilizable for word-palatography would indicate puspoam the potential extension of the prosody over the whole word-in contrast with, e.g. kalana) By generalization from such study rules could be stated for * prakalpana-). this extension: e.g. considering r, s, etc., as the focal points of the prosody, and symbolizing a preceding palatographically interfering articulation by T, the maximum possible extension of the prosody in the one direction is R T on the other side of the focus the prosody similarly extends .. .... r.. R only as far as the first interfering articulation 2 It is, however, (. . r ... T..). a basic phonological principle that units occurring at one position in a word are not to be identified with units in other positions : hence, in the case we are con- sidering, post-focal articulations need not be expected to conform to pre-focal articulations which, for typographical convenience we happen to write with the same letter 3; it need not therefore occasion any surprise when our phonetic investigations show that an apical nasal in pre-focal position is realized as an interfering (dental) articulation, but that in post-focal position it has a retroflex realization which thus continues the extension of the prosody-hence forms of R R the type i. i (nisanna-), . i (nibarhana-), etc. nisanna- nibarhana- (ii) The above approach, whilst retaining the ancient and still valuable con- ception of interfering and non-interfering articulations, no longer gives rise to the unsatisfactory postulate of " action at a distance "; r, etc., no longer change n to n, but when, by phonetic analysis, R is projected on to the linear plane, both r and a following apical nasal are amongst the articulations found to fall within its extension. 1 In the case of an ancient language such an examination must, of course, be largely hypo- thetical, and in part based on the very orthographic data which we are rejecting; however, there is no reason why, having stood on these phonemic stepping-stones whilst building our prosodic bridge, we should any longer tolerate their obstruction of the stream. 2 The fact that y appears as a non-interfering articulation is not unexpected. Intervocalic y in Skt. is in many cases to be treated simply as a prosodic marker of syllable-junction-e.g. in dhiya, etc., and probably in many instances of the type ddyaka- &lt; *dd-aka- (cf. Wackernagel ? 187; note also the alternation of y with v, another typical prosodic marker, at all stages of Indo-Aryan); as such, it is likely to have involved less constriction than a phonematic y (cf. the " laghuprayatnatara " y of Jaina Pkt., or of Hindustani aya, etc. As for post-consonantal position, we may remember the frequent alternations of y and i under the conditions of " Sievers' Law ", and the wider extension of the vocalic realization in Vedic Skt., as attested by metrical requirements (-bhyas to be realized as -bhi-as, etc.). The weak articulation of y is moreover supported for non-initial position in general by the ancient treatises (cf. Varma, op. cit., pp. 126 ff.). 3 The operation of "Verner's Law " is a ca,e in point. Cf. ako Twaddell, Gn lefining the Phoneme, p. 49.</page><page sequence="6">W. S. ALLEN- The example of dissimilation requires less full discussion, as much of the ground has already been prepared. The statement of the Sanskrit rule, as given by Macdonnell (? 55), is that:- " If gh, dh, bh, or h are at the end of a (radical) syllable beginning with g, d, b, and lose their aspiration as final or otherwise, the initial consonants are aspirated by way of compensation." The customary explanation is then given that:- " This is an historical survival of the original initial aspiration, which was lost (both in Greek and Sanskrit) by the operation of the later euphonic law that prohibited a syllable beginning and ending with an aspirate. Hence when the final aspirate disappeared the initial returned." This historical digression also provides an explanation for a rule of reduplication in Sanskrit, viz. (? 129. 1):- " Aspirated letters are represented by the corresponding unaspirated." Of these statements, the first (descriptive) involves the concept of aspiration being lost by one consonant and " thrown back " upon one preceding it; the second statement (historical) envisages the aspiration of the first consonant being held in a state of suspended animation against the occasion when a following aspirate shall disappear and so permit its return to life; and the " euphonic law " characterized by the process of reduplication presents us with the usual conception of dissimilation at a distance, namely the aspiration of one consonant refusing to tolerate the coexistence of another. The "physiological explanations " of the phenomenon are not convincing, and psychological apologiae even less so.1 The prosodic treatment rather simplifies the statement, and dispenses with the half-mystic, half-anthropomorphic imagery; it notes simply that the aspiration is a prosody of the potential radical syllable.2 As such, it requires to be marked once only (in spelling and, in Sanskrit, also in utterance); generally marked by the special (aspirated) form of the second consonant, it becomes necessary to mark it elsewhere if, for reasons connected with interfering junction- prosodies, the second cannot carry it3-in Western Hindustani we may observe a prosody of aspiration realized as a breathiness of the vowel, e.g. in the word traditionally spelt bohwt, suggesting a structure CVCVC, but in fact standing for bawt (CVVC) with prosodic aspiration (b wt).4 This approach to the present problem, though recent, is not new. It has 1 Cf. Grammont, op. cit., pp. 269 ff.; R. G. Kent, "Assimilation and Dissimilation," Language, xii, 1936, pp. 245 ff. 2 The addition of " potential " is necessary to cover reduplicated forms, such as babhuva, where although the bh, in fact, belongs to the second syllable, babh- is potentially a radical syllable (like labh-, dabh-, etc.)-cf. the attested secondary root dadh- from da-dhd-ti. The non-application of the rule in other cases may be illustrated by such a form as abhi-dhd-bhii. 3 E.g. budh-: bhot-syati. The aspiration may vanish from the syllable altogether if the dominant junction-prosody is such as to involve the transfer of the syllable-prosody to another syllable, as in the case of " Bartholomae's Law " (*budh-ta- &gt; buddha-, etc.). Variations such as dhug-dhvam beside dug-dhi present a difficulty of interpretation. 4 Indicated as bawht in Harley's Colloquial Hindustani; cf. also Hoenigswald, " Declension and Nasalization in Hindustani " (JAOS., 68), p. 143 f., n. 15. 944</page><page sequence="7">SOME PROSODIC ASPECTS OF RETROFLEXION AND ASPIRATION IN SANSKRIT 945 been used to advantage for a variety of modern languages by members of the Department of Phonetics and Linguistics in the School of Oriental and African Studies, in London1; the prosodies abstracted by these treatments have included not only aspiration but also, e.g. yotization, labiovelarization, rhota- cization, affrication, friction, and voice. So far as concerns aspiration, it is also implied by Zellig Harris in his article "Simultaneous Components in Phonology ",2 where, considering the Greek parallel of the present case, he suggests that we might write 7re+vKa, etc., in some such way as /'pepuka/, the ' indicating what we should call the prosody of aspiration; by such a repre- sentation, as he points out, the reduplicative rre- (not be-) is entirely what we should expect. In this article I have tried to show that, in dealing with an ancient language, revered for its orthography but notorious for the complexities of its sandhi- laws, some rationalization, if not simplification, of the latter may be effected by discarding some of our reverence for the former; and that by this approach we avoid the necessity for postulating mysterious gravitational forces whereby one sound influences another. It is perhaps not too much to say that in a large majority of cases the conceptions of assimilation and dissimilation are not only unnecessary but also involve us in the sort of statements that no science can tolerate: in historical and prehistorical linguistics, many examples of so-called "metathesis " are also probably best reduced to prosodic statement.3 The prosodic treatment does not answer problems of phonetic " action at a distance "; rather like the theory of relativity, it adds a new dimension to the framework within which phenomena are studied and described, and within this framework these problems are found no longer to exist. In conclusion, I shall briefly consider an issue connected with our first subject (the " cerebralization of n ") which is raised by a notoriously trouble- some set of examples. I refer to the type of word which may conveniently be exemplified by the form parinirvinna-. By the general laws of sandhi, we should expect *parinirvinnfa- (cf. parinivis-), whereas, in fact, to use the traditional terminology, the second r, which has an assimilating influence on the following *n (&gt; n), has a dissimilating influence on the preceding *n (&gt; n) where this 1 E.g.

Skt. snana- &gt; Pkt. nh.na-, etc., IE *ismeros &gt; Gk. ueppos. Note also the Alexandrian prosodic writing of p- (i.e. H) for the Greek sound which was the reflex of inter alia IE *sr- (e.g. pUco): the Gk. D- is transcribed in Latin as rh- (e.g. rhetor), in Armenian as hr- (hretor); Tsaconian ginda &lt; Lac. pi'88a, suggests a realization as breathed r- (cf. Sturtevant, Pron. of Gk. and Lat.2, ? 67b). The phonematic s in such cases has been replaced by prosodic breathing, just as the pre-IE phonematic " laryngeal " units are replaced by various prosodies in the attested languages: e.g. length in Gk. .ritOpci &lt; *-dheq1-, aspiration in Skt. tisthati &lt; *-sta2e-, voice in Skt. pibati &lt; *pip23eti, hiatus (a prosody of syllabic junction) in Gk. 0ivos &lt; *dhuq2os (cf. Ovio's, Hitt. tuhhwis).</page><page sequence="8">946 SOME PROSODIC ASPECTS OF RETROFLEXION AND ASPIRATION IN SANSKRIT stands immediately before the r or separated only by a vowel.' As Whitney remarks (Gr. ? 181b) on observing certain similar cases of s for expected *s (e.g. sarsrdna- for *sarsrdna-) 2 : " The dissimilating influence of a following r, as compared with the invariable assimilating influence of a preceding r, is peculiar and problematical." The traditional method of statement is here nothing less than ridiculous, and the prosodic approach provides a statement that is linguistically more R R acceptable. In a word of the type par a the two " retroflexion-foci" r rparmnirvnna- (.. r .... r ..) indicate two R-prosodies; if the duality thus set up is to be preserved, i.e. if the indicated prosodic structure R-R is not to be reduced in realization to R, there must be an interruption between the two foci: in the cases considered the potential means of such interruption is provided by the intervening apical nasal, which is consequently given its dental realization, i.e. R R r-. . i. Or we may express the process in slightly different terms by parminrvinna- considering our earlier statement regarding "pre-focal" apical nasals, viz. that they regularly have a palatographically interfering realization (so that in, R R e.g. nibarhana- the maximum linear extension of the R-prosody is I); nibarhana- we may then say that in parinirvinna- the R-R duality is preserved by treating the intervening nasal as related to the second R-prosody rather than the first. On the basis of this method of statement it might be argued that the inter- rupting nasal articulation then bears to the two R-prosodies much the same relationship as a prosodic syllable-marker (such as y in Hindustani aya) bears to the two syllables; and hence that as the syllable-marker belongs to a different dimension from that of the linear syllables, so the " prosody-separator" must belong to yet another dimension outside that of the R-prosodies them- selves.3 We need not be afraid to admit such a possibility: rather should we be prepared to add to our analytical framework just as many dimensions as the material demands. Varro was perhaps not so very far wrong when he stated, some two thousand years ago, that "speech must be recognized as having three dimensions ", of which only one (" longitudo ") is represented on the time- track (" tempore ac syllabis metimur ").4 1 The same peculiarity is shown, as we might expect, by forms such as pranasta- beside pranzasati, or parinistha- for *parinisthd-, the " dissimilating influence " here extending also to the form prananiksyati for *pra.naitksyati. 2 With a partial parallel in Av. ayzrdaayeiti for expected *ayz-. 3 The relevant features of the parallelism may be diagrammatically illustrated as follows: 2nd order prosody of junction: n st order posodiesf of junction: y of process: R R Syllabic structure: V V Phonematic structure: a - a parinirvinna- 4 Ed.
