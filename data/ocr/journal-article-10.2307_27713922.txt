<plain_text><page sequence="1">FORM AND MATTER IN PARADISE LOST, BOOK III Allan Gilbert, Duke University, and Rutgers University, Newark I. MILTON AND ROMANTIC POETRY . . . my Celestial Patroness . . . inspires Easie my unpremeditated Verse: Since first this Subject for Heroic Song Pleas'd me long choosing, and beginning late; Not sedulous by Nature to indite Warrs, hitherto the onely Argument Heroic deem'd, chief mais trie to dissect With long and tedious havoc fabl'd Knights In Battels feign'd; the better fortitude Of Patience and Heroic Martyrdom Unsung; or to describe Races and Games, Or tilting Furniture, emblazon'd Shields, Impreses quaint, Caparisons and Steeds; Bases and tinsel Trappings, gorgious Knights At Joust and Torneament; then marshal'd Feast Serv'd up in Hall with Sewers, and Seneshals; The skill of Artifice or Office mean, Not that which justly gives Heroic name To Person or to Poem. (P-L., IX, 21-41).1 We need not press the autobiographical quality of these lines. The dramatic speaker is not so much Milton as the Biblical poet gen erally, who performs "the office of a pulpit" as much as does the clergyman. The literal Milton did not reject the "vain, amatorious" romances of the chivalric poets. In his youth he read them with de light, as he says in the Apology for Smectymnuus. Nor was this de light merely youthful. Ariosto is all but named in Paradise Lost, III, 459, and that poem owes much to his Orlando. Even in Paradise Re gained Milton pays tribute to Arthurian story: . . . Ladies of th' H es per ides, that seem'd Fairer than feign'd of old, or fabl'd since Of Fairy Damsels met in Forest wide By Knights of Logres, or of Lyones, Lancelot or Pelleas, or Pellenore. (P-R-, II, 357~6i) 1 Milton's poems are quoted throughout from Complete Poetical Works, Reproduced in Photographic Facsimile, ed. Harris Francis Fletcher (Urbana, 1943), 4 vols. 651</page><page sequence="2">652 Milton Studies in Honor of H. F. Fletcher In the same poem he remembers Boiardo's Orlando Innamorato: Such forces met not, nor so wide a camp, When Agrican with all his Northern powers Besieg'd Albracca, as Romances tell; The City of Gallaphrone, from thence to win The fairest of her Sex Angelica His daughter, sought by many Pro west Knights, Both Paynim, and the Peers of Charlemane. (P.R., III, 337-43) Such passages come from one who delighted in the romances of chiv alry to the end of his days. When the youthful Milton attempted heroic verse he turned to Christ as Most perfect Heroe, try'd in heaviest plight Of labours huge and hard. ("The Passion," 11. 13-14) In "The Passion" he praises Vida's Christiad, a Biblical epic. But a long Christian poem is not primary in his early life. When in Epita phium Damonis he imagines himself the ideal poet in search of an epic subject, he turns to King Arthur. When in The Reason of Church-Government he revealed his hopes less poetically, an epic theme is to be found in "our own ancient stories," Arthur or King Alfred in the role of Odysseus, as in the notes of poetical subjects in the Cam bridge manuscript. For the long epic his models are Homer, Virgil, and Tasso. So wars, the theme or "Argument Heroic deem'd," would have been the theme of any poem then written. For tragedy he does not specify subjects; we may assume such as he noted in the Cambridge manuscript, both Biblical and political, of which we have in developed form only Samson Agonistes. Did he ever write anything in furtherance of the plan for a long epic outlined in The Reason of Church-Government? Not even an asser tion that he did has survived. Yet military passages more than are warranted by the disclaimer at the beginning of Book IX appear in both Paradises. As Addison said, the war in Heaven in Paradise Lost, VI, is Homeric; it also owes something to the Italian romantic epics. The muster roll of Satan's host in Hell has often been referred to sources in the military epics, from the Iliad to the Gerusalemme Liberata. Paradise Regained too presents the muster of the Parthian host illustrated with the gorgeous comparison from an epic of war and love, the Orlando Innamorato, quoted above. So well are these passages suited to their present contexts that they can hardly have been rescued</page><page sequence="3">Form and Matter in "Paradise Lost," Book III 653 from one of Milton's own manuscripts of a conventional epic, though their spirit avows the author's long-continued and fascinated pre occupation with epic and romance. However exaggerated the Biblical or reflective poet's position in the lines initially quoted in this study, something autobiographical still inheres in them. They represent a poet attempting the military epic and not succeeding, then finding that Biblical verse flowed easily from his pen, though such ease is rather a poetic figure than a literal statement. It shows, however, a poet happy in finding the right thing to do. Thus we can easily believe that for years Milton clung to his theme of Alfred or Arthur, treated in Virgilian fashion, and that for years his efforts did not satisfy him. Meanwhile he considered what he could do in tragedy, noting subjects and making outlines in the Cambridge manuscript and writ ing Samson Agonistes. These outlines witness to Milton's interest in the subject of Paradise Lost. According to Edward Phillips, part at least of a tragedy on the subject was written. Then Milton, as it ap pears, changed his plans. Abandoning the military and romantic epic, he turned to the Biblical epic, following in part his outline for a trag edy on the loss of Paradise and using and adapting whatever tragic verses he had written on the theme. Since the tragedy was confined to the Garden of Eden, scenes in Hell, Heaven, and Chaos had to be composed (I; II; X, 235 ff.; Ill, 56 ff.; etc.). Other parts were much expanded. Book VII was planned as a choric song in the tragedy, requiring perhaps a hundred lines; the war in Heaven?a book and a half long in the epic?was also planned as a choric song. Much of Books XI and XII become angelic narrative instead of a masque of allegorical figures in a nonclassical tragedy. Thus the drama of Para dise Lost, whether or not complete, gave way to an epic of perhaps thrice its contemplated length. If twice as long as Samson Agonistes, which is limited to classical proportions, the tragedy would have extended to 3500 lines, or one-third the length of the present epic. As has often been remarked, the Satan of the later part of Paradise Lost, so far as he is derived from Milton's dramatic plan, is not the Satan of Books I and II, but is diminished in physical proportions and mental scope. Great size appears in his defiance of Gabriel and his return to Hell; in the first "his stature reacht the Skie" (IV, 988) and in the second he sat on a throne apparently as huge as earlier (I, 793; II, 1; X, 445), though the word monstrous (X, 514) does not always indicate size; perhaps after what had preceded on the smaller Satan,</page><page sequence="4">654 Milton Studies in Honor of H. F. Fletcher Milton preferred not to be specific on magnitude. The Satan of a tragedy influenced by the stage could not much exceed human pro portions, but stature exaggerating anything possessed by giants of earlier epics is necessary to fit the colossal exploit of Satan in crossing the desert of Chaos, to appear as in some sense a heroic rival of the Almighty. Thus in shifting Paradise Lost from drama to epic Milton still retained much of the romantic and military spirit that he apparently rejected at the beginning of Book IX. At first the long theological passage in Book III appears opposed to the nature of epic. At least epic magnitude makes reasonable long passages impossible in drama. In the Furioso, Ariosto could pause to give the history of the French invasions of Italy by describing the pictures decorating a hall (Canto XXXIII). By including in his Morgante (XXV, 136-61, 232-44) passages on Christian doctrine, Pulci furnished Milton precedent for theology in a poem primarily active rather than resembling Lucretius' De rerum natura. II. MILTON AS THEOLOGIAN For using theology Milton was well equipped. In the introduction to his De Doctrina Christiana he tells of assiduous study begun in his youth and continued throughout his life, with all the aids of scholar ship and with attention to the necessary languages. We may recall that until "church-outed by the prelates" he intended to enter the Church. His nephew Edward Phillips says that he and Milton's other pupils read the Pentateuch in Hebrew, made "a good entrance into the Targum or Chaldee paraphrase," and came "to understand several chapters of St. Matthew in the Syriac Testament." Still fur ther the pupil reports: The Sunday work was for the most part the reading each day a chapter of the Greek Testament and hearing his learned exposition upon the same. . . . The next work after this was the writing from his own dictation some part, from time to time, of a tractate which he thought fit to collect from the ablest of divines who had written of that subject: Amesius, Wollebius, etc., viz. A Perfect System of Divinity. The two similar works by Ames and Wollebius are among the shorter systems of divinity referred to in the introduction to De Doctrina Christiana. When after years of labor that work was in some sense complete, it seemed to its author "a powerful aid," "a treasure house," his "best and most valuable possession." As becomes the cherished life work of an active intelligence, the treatise never was beyond revision.</page><page sequence="5">Form and Matter in "Paradise Lost," Book III 655 The manuscript seems gradually to have become so corrected and interlined as to require copying before it could be given to a printer. If we believe Phillips, it was at first little unlike the similar works by Ames and Wollebius. As time went on, Milton drew farther and farther away from them. When Milton's work is compared with theirs, their outline is apparent, but the content of the sections is different. In the De Doctrina itself and in his other writings Milton mentions so many other theologians and commentators on Scripture that his reading must be thought considerable. His actual knowledge fre quently is hidden. For example, passages in the De Doctrina evidently intended to overthrow parts of Calvin's Institutes make no mention of that work; indeed he who does not know Calvin must remain ignorant of De Doctrina Christiana. III. MILTON'S "GREAT ARGUMENT," THE FALL Perhaps not until he was about fifty years old did Milton, "long choosing," determine his epic subject. At any rate he abandoned the epic on Arthur or Alfred, though retaining much of the action and more of the spirit of both classical and romantic epics, the Homeric poems, the Aeneid, Orlando Furioso, Gerusalemme Liberata. His tragedy of Paradise Lost offered its "great Argument" or theme, the Fall of Adam and Eve. To the seventeenth century that story was less personal and of wider significance than at present. Like the temp tation of Job as Gregory the Great presented it in his Moralia, it personified the age-long conflict of light and darkness. More than that, it decided man's fate; had our first parents successfully resisted Satan, man's future happiness would have been assured. It was, part ly for that reason, one of the best known of Biblical narratives. Thus to a seventeenth-century poet seeking to free himself from Ariosto's theme of knights in combat it could hardly be surpassed. It went far toward furnishing the "moral equivalent of war." If less evidently pertinent in our day, it illustrates how we must study to prepare for artistic appreciation that came easily and directly to Milton's first readers. The argument of the Fall in Genesis 3 is presented as a nar rative. Thus Milton's That to the highth of this great Argument I may assert Eternal Providence, And justifie the wayes of God to men (I, 24-26) may be simply interpreted : That so far as my story permits I may ex press my belief that God rules the world and that his government is just. Milton knew that without story there could be no epic; he also</page><page sequence="6">656 Milton Studies in Honor of H. F. Fletcher knew that the possibilities of story limited his opportunity to present ideas, however willing he might be that his method, like Dante's, should be "digressive." Hence the "highth" of his argument is the utmost that his story allows. In his day his subject or argument was able to bear great weight. Much theology, especially the Calvinistic theology that so influenced Milton, whether accepting or rejecting, may almost be summed up in the Apostle Paul's words: "As in Adam all die, so in Christ shall all be made alive" (I Cor. 15: 22). No narrative in Scripture, not even in the Gospels, was more important for the theologian than the account of the Fall in Genesis 3. Here were found expressed man's weakness on earth and his need for redemption. Here was the root of the world's evil and suffering. To the first three chapters of Genesis one of Mil ton's favorite commentators, David Paraeus, devoted almost a hundred folio pages of finely printed exegesis. If we are to suppose that a poet can be most poetical on what most interests him and has most occupied his mind for years, and also harmonizes with the thought and feeling of his age, Milton, a life-long student of theology and an ob server of man as a moral being, could choose no more suitable argu ment than the story of man's Fall?the most familiar of stories in a Biblical age and fundamental to prevailing belief. IV. PARADISE LOST, BOOK III, EXAMINED The chief overt statement of theological belief stands in Paradise Lost, III, 92-343, a passage of 251 lines, little enough in a poem of 10,565 lines. Long experience with epics had taught Milton that their chief components are action, dramatic dialogue, and description. To dramatic action he adapts the theology of Book III. Let us examine the passage. What is its setting? At the end of Book II the revengeful Satan, escaped from Hell, has been described as flying through Chaos toward the World, where he hopes to thwart God by destroying man. Early in Book III the narrative is resumed. The Almighty Father, enthroned in Heaven, looks down upon the Garden of Eden, where he sees Adam and Eve Reaping immortal fruits of joy and love, Uninterrupted joy, unrivald love. (Ill, 67-68) He then surveys Chaos and Satan there Coasting the wall of Heav'n on this side Night</page><page sequence="7">Form and Matter in "Paradise Lost," Book III 657 In the dun Air sublime, and ready now To stoop . . . On the bare outside of this World. (Ill, 70-74) In an independence that for the time seems freedom, Satan is moving toward the Earth, where he is to achieve success in his immediate object, victory over mankind. But in Milton's theology Satan does not win an ultimate victory; he merely carries out heavenly intention, even when securing the appearance of success. However clearly Mil ton sees the evil of the world, he is certain of the triumph of good, be lieving that there is justice in God's ways, inscrutable and baffling to man though they are. This conviction Milton strives to translate into epic action. Hence the dramatic situation of Satan confidently mov ing on to his exploit, not realizing that even before he sees his victims, the Almighty, fully aware, is making complete preparations for his de feat. The scene in Heaven in which Father and Son look down on Satan is thus placed for the sake of dramatic effect. The reader has in his mind's eye that as the two speak they observe Satan as he passes through Chaos and alights on the world's outside shell. Quite ignorant of such anticipation, the Adversary moves toward his goal, the dwelling of man, with purpose to assay If him by force he can destroy, or worse, By some false guile pervert; and shall pervert. (Ill, 90-92) So the Father asserts. He then explains the situation according to Miltonic theology. Man will fall, yet the fault is his own, for God created him free, with power to resist all Satan's wiles. In such free dom there is the possibility of defeat, for man is not under compul sion to maintain the happiness with which he originally was dowered. Thus man, the free agent, ordains his own fall; yet since he was de ceived he shall find mercy. The Son answers, praising the Father for his mercy, for if man should be irrevocably lost Satan would return to Hell successful; the Almighty's purpose in creating man would have failed. Thus both his goodness and his power would properly be questioned. Assenting, the Father explains that grace is offered to all men and that repentance will bring forgiveness. Yet since man has sinned, justice demands punishment, the punishment of death. Man must die unless some other will pay his forfeit by dying for him. Who in Heaven will do so?</page><page sequence="8">658 Milton Studies in Honor of H. F. Fletcher The Son offers himself as man's substitute. On him Death shall wreak his rage, and mankind shall be freed from danger and shall at last enter Heaven with the Redeemer. This offer the Father accepts as redeeming such men as repent. It shall be brought about through the Incarnation of the Son, who finally shall reign as universal king. Even within the 251 lines of the passage not all the space is given to theology in the narrow sense. There is a brief poem on the Harrowing of Hell and the Ascension (III, 246-56) and one on the Last Judgment and the end of the world (III, 323-38). Throughout the passage the energy and movement of the language are fitted to the divine par ticipants. Something of this effect of vitality comes from evident means, such as the omission of conjunctions, pronouns, and modal verbs. Modifying phrases are set at some distance from the words they modify. Inversions appear, as Dye hee or Justice must; (III, 210) on mans behalf Patron or Intercessor none appeerd. (Ill, 218-19) Generally the thought proceeds by short statements; the periodic sentence when it occurs is short, and there is an abundance of brief assertions. But though such indications?as Longinus knew?are worth observing, there is no formula for poetic energy; its springs are deep within the poet's mind. Further contributing to this artistic force is a development of repetition of sound serving also to emphasize the important theological ideas of the section. Properly to show this, the entirety must be read aloud, for the separate speeches both move as units and are related as parts of the whole. Some short passages are here offered, though in isolation they suggest excessive emphasis by repeated sound. I made him just and right, Sufficient to have stood, though free to fall. Such I created all th'Ethereal Powers And Spirits, both them who stood and them who fell;2 Freely they stood who stood, and fell who fell. (Ill, 98-102) if I foreknew, Foreknowledge had no influence on their fall,3 Which had no less prov'd certain unforeknown. (Ill, 117-19) 21 change the normal reading, faild, to fell, to me obviously correct, though with no textual support. Ci. fell at the end of 1. 129; Fate (113, 120); Decree, decreed (115, 116, 126). 3 In the same way I correct fault to fall. Cf. 11. 95, 99, 128, ending in fall.</page><page sequence="9">Form and Matter in "Paradise Lost," Book III 659 I will . . . soft'n stonie hearts To pray, repent, and bring obedience due. To Prayer, repentance, and obedience due, Though but endevord with sincere intent, Mine ear shall not be slow, mine eye not shut. (Ill, 188-93) Behold mee then, mee for him, life for life I offer, on mee let thine anger fall; Account mee man. (Ill, 236-38) ... I shall rise Victorious, and subdue My vanquisher, spoild of his van ted spoile; Death his deaths wound shall then receive. (Ill, 250-52) In addition to these and others there are more remote echoes, as free and its derivatives from line 99 to line 128; die, death, dead in lines 209-59, resumed in lines 295-99. Thus the poetical ornament of the passage is internal, derived from the words expressing its ideas and from the rhetoric; there are no extended similes and metaphors, no names from Greek myth or Biblical history. Perhaps no passage in Milton is verbally more highly developed; in other words, no passage more depends for its effect on reading aloud. V. DIVINITIES AS EPIC CHARACTERS In this scene in the heavenly court the Almighty and the Son are anthropomorphic, even though Milton protests against anthropo patheia as a figure invented by the grammarians to excuse poetical fables about Jove (De Doctrina Christiana, Bk. I, ch. 2). Little else than human conduct is possible when divine beings become actors in epic poetry, as appears in the Homeric epics. Indeed part of Homer's humanization of the gods may result from epic demands rather than from the loss of faith in the Homeric age often given as a reason for the ungodly behavior of divinities. The creator and sustainer of the universe can hardly use human speech without suffering humaniza tion; for such a creator the only poetry is the hymn of praise. The monotheism of the Old Testament, which Milton took over, suffers such danger. To identify the Lord God who walked in the Garden of Eden in the cool of the day after man's fall (Gen. 3:8) with the creator of Genesis 1 is not easy. Since the theologians of Milton's era, depend ing on the Bible, could not wholly reconcile the humanized and the creating and sustaining divinity, Milton the epic poet can hardly be expected to do so. Of the difficulty Milton was not unaware. When Raphael is about</page><page sequence="10">66o Milton Studies in Honor of H. F. Fletcher to describe to Adam the war in Heaven, he says dramatically what can also be a warning to the reader: what surmounts the reach Of human sense, I shall delineate so, By lik'ning spiritual to corporal forms, As may express them best ... (V, 571-74) In the Christian Doctrine, where Milton strove for scientific expression, the Biblical literalist unites with the artist whose instinct tells him that abstract expression cannot be long continued in effective poetry. Milton writes: It is safest for us to conceive that God is just what he shows himself to be in the sacred writings and that he is as he there describes himself. Even though we concede that God is always described and pictured not as he is but as we can understand him, nevertheless we ought to form such an idea of him as he wishes us to hold when he adapts himself to our minds. ... If God usually assigns to himself human limbs and appearance, why should we be afraid of assigning to him what he assigns to himself? (De Doctrina Christiana, Bk. I, ch. 2) Yet in the same chapter Milton attributes to God infinity, omnipres ence, omnipotence, etc. So in adaptation to man's experience and to the possibilities of art, the God of Paradise Lost conducts himself as an earthly ruler. The Son is a prudent courtier, beginning with deference his speech to the monarch (III, 144) and then endeavoring to per suade him not to go too far in his punishment of disloyal man. Satan should not be allowed any reality of triumph. From such policy, the Son warns the Father, it would follow that So should thy goodness and thy greatness both Be questiond and blaspheam'd without defence. (Ill, 165-66) This is less extreme than Charlemagne's argument in his prayer to the Christian God, who should give the French victory if he does not expect general defection to pagan worship (Orlando Furioso, XIV, 70). It is more nearly in the tone of Milton's remark that Calvinists make God the author of sin (De Doctrina Christiana, Bk. I, ch. 3; True Religion, p. 6). The Almighty answers like a wise ruler. Even his lyrical speech on the Last Judgment (III, 323-38) is that of a mortal poet, such as Cynewulf in his Christ, rather than a creator. Milton does what he can to erase the mundane effect of the dialogue between Father and Son by an angelic hymn to the Creator?a lyric inserted in the epic and yet echoing De Doctrina Christiana, Bk. I, ch. 2 :</page><page sequence="11">Form and Matter in "Paradise Lost," Book III 661 Omnipotent, Immutable, Immortal, Infinite, Eternal King; thee Author of all being, Fountain of Light, thy self invisible Amidst the glorious brightness where thou sit'st Thron'd inaccessible . . . (Ill, 372-77) Yet still the total epic effect is?as it should be?that of a debate on royal policy or ragione di stato, placed where its dramatic effect is greatest, negating Satan's attempt at seduction before he even sees his intended victims in their happy garden. VI. POETICAL THEOLOGY In his poetical use of theology Milton gave it little trace of his in dividual unorthodoxy. Addison, in his paper on Book III of Paradise Lost, commended the excellence of Milton's statement of the central truths of Christian belief; John Wesley produced an edition of Paradise Lost with apparent acceptation of its theology. Both these men lived before the revelation of Milton's heterodoxy on the dis covery of his long-lost De Doctrina Christiana in 1824. That until then he had been thought a pillar of orthodoxy affirms the excellent camouflage of strange doctrine in Paradise Lost. Even after the revela tion of the poet's rejection of the Trinity in his treatise, Sister Miriam Joseph has affirmed that his poem is suitable reading for the intelli gent devout.4 In other words, Milton dealt primarily with the ele ments of Christian doctrine obvious to all "fit" readers in his time. His touches on the unorthodox are covered by the flow of his verse and by Biblical language. For example, in a passage that forms part of the frame for the doctrinal explication of Book III the Son is celebrated by the angelic hosts as of all Creation first, Begotten Son, Divine Similitude, In whose conspicuous count'nance, without cloud Made visible, th'Almighty Father shines, Whom else no Creature can behold; on thee Impresst the effulgence of his Glorie abides, Transfus'd on thee his ample Spirit rests. (Ill, 383-89) The passage suggests De Doctrina Christiana, Bk. I, chs. 5, 7 (Co lumbia ed., xiv, 182, 190; xv, 8), where Milton explains the Son as subsequent to the Father and created by him. In the poetry un orthodox possibilities are masked by the use of Colossians 1:15, 4 Laval Th?ologique et Philosophique, vin (1952), 243 f?.</page><page sequence="12">662 Milton Studies in Honor of H. F. Fletcher where the Son is the "firstborn of every creature," and of Revelation 3:14: "the beginning of the creation of God." By the orthodox reader all Scriptural echo in the poetry is necessarily interpreted as orthodox, yet in his treatise Milton gives anti-Trinitarian interpretation to these passages. Without De Doctrina Christiana, then, Paradise Lost appears to present through its Scriptural language generally ac ceptable doctrine. If poetry, it is the poetry of Milton's age generally, not the expression of his personal belief. As an absolute and irresponsible ruler, Milton's God has not found favor with such men as Shelley, just as the Calvinistic God has generally fallen out of favor in the present century. For example, a Methodist hero, Borden P. Bowne, protested against the "rectoral" theory of God such as Calvinists and other theologians held. No one need insist that this tyrannical God, however inclined to some ap plication of mercy, is attractive in theology or in Paradise Lost. What Shelley and Bowne wished was a kindly God, conforming to their notion of ethics, who made existence agreeable to mankind. That is, they wished a world in which man could live an uninterruptedly pleasant life, the Utopia of reformers of various eras, including the present. But however we may respect the reformer in his desire to benefit the human race, his imaginary perfect world is not the real one; in fact it results from his reaction against a world far from per fect. The Almighty of seventeenth-century theology, appearing in Paradise Lost, results from observation of the world as it is, not a place pleasantly adapted to man but one where he has a hard time and where he attains salvation, if he does so, by effort and with fear and trembling. As the expression of his age Milton's God could hardly be a pleasant one. Hence if poetry presents the spirit of its time, a benevolent and tolerant God?however satisfactory to romantic de sires?could not in the sixteen hundreds be poetical. That a reader may not like Milton's God is thus entirely apart from that God's poetical quality. Does criticism require that lago, Macbeth, Cleo patra, or Shylock be such as we would gladly number among our personal friends? Milton's God is subject to such a test only if Para dise Lost becomes a mere versified Christian Doctrine or literal state ment of belief. God as a poetic character is not in the first instance an object for ethical judgment. Something is here demanded of the reader. He must not be so affected by the theology, whether accepted or rejected, as to dissolve in darkness its instrumental function in the poem, as dramatically</page><page sequence="13">Form and Matter in "Paradise Lost," Book III 663 thwarting Satan's plans. Secondarily, too, the passage has poetical quality as an ideal view of man theologizing, loving systems, asking for a clearly explained universe, formulating schemes that will take uncertainty out of the world. Neither primarily or secondarily is the reader's rational acceptance of the system poetically demanded. Indeed the opportunity to see the whole as poetical is even enhanced in an untheological age; we can look with charity on the unpoetical view that caused the Catholic Alexander Pope in a Protestant England to speak of Milton's God as a "school divine" or professor of theology. For an untheological modern to be so prosaic is less pardonable, though he needs historical preparation to condition him for such unwonted epic material. On Milton's use in his epic of the theology so important to him as a man, the all-inclusive question is: Has he made theology poetic? This question the individual reader had best answer for himself, but only after he has considered the doctrinal verses in the whole move ment of the epic. Poetically the theological exposition is the strategy of dealing with Satan the invader. If on reading Book III along with the rest of the epic, reading it aloud, an individual decides in either way, his judgment may stand for himself, until again he approaches Paradise Lost. At least there is no reason to suppose that Milton would have written more poetically if he had chosen an earthly king, Arthur or Alfred. Spenser's decision to deal with Holiness and other virtues suggests his judgment that Tasso was the last of the epic poets of war and love. The theology of Book III is important to the critic now as it was to the poet as he composed, but it is important in the same way as is the military or romantic theme handled by Virgil or Ariosto. As Charlemagne in Orlando Furioso prepares to thwart the attack of the Saracens on Paris, so the Almighty of Paradise Lost plans to ruin Satan's expedition. If Milton's was an age in which theology had imaginative force, if he had more of the craftsman's power over such lore than over any other, that was the material for him, the matter to which he could best give the form demanded by art. In and for itself the modified thought of Calvin and many pred ecessors is neither better nor worse than any other poetic theme labored by the human spirit and accepted by many readers.</page></plain_text>
