<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Cluny Capital of the Three-Headed Bird CAROL S. PENDERGAST University of Lowell Abstract A lost capital from Cluny, documented in a sketch by F. van Riesamburgh in 1814, depicts a half-naked warrior with shield, helmet and hair skirt. The warrior confronts a three-headed bird to defend a cringing human victim. The capital belongs to a series of Burgundian sculptures of the same theme, most of which also include a siren. Several aspects of the iconography pose methodological and interpretive problems. The figures appear to be paired haphazardly; to be transformed, sometimes radically; and one or more may be omitted. On this basis, scholars dismiss the imagery as either confused or only meaningful in a general way, or focus only on the warrior and siren. But the persistent juxtaposition of the protagonists in portal or sanctuary settings suggests they operated as a unit. Based on St. Jerome's Vulgate text of Isaiah 13:21- 22, the Physiologus pairs the siren with the onocen- taur, half-man and half-goat. The armed figure in our series conforms in part to this type. Exegesis on both creatures identifies them with carnality and hypocrisy. However, the evil attributes of the onocentaur coexist here with those indicating his role as the hero who wars against a monstrous fowl. The familiar device of battle adds a complementary motif. Although no exact paral- lel for the three-headed bird is known to me, heroes battling dragon-like fiends proliferate in Romanesque art. The partial nudity, the helmet and shield of the warrior, and the presence of siren and victim raise the possibility that a reference to Ulysses defending his men against Scylla was intended. This multi-cephalous monster also held connotations of Lust. It is suggested here that the sculptures of this group exhibit an overlay of pictorial and exegetical themes which voice a warn- ing against the lust of the flesh and false doctrines, topical concerns in Romanesque Burgundy. Among the sketches made by Fabien van Riesamburgh in 1814, which depict lost sculptures of Cluny III, one records an engaged capital with an unusual subject. It shows a bearded, half-naked male warrior, wearing a short skirt and a conical helmet over his long hair, and carrying a shield (Fig. 1).'1 The figure straddles one angle of the capital, and his right arm, thrust back, must have held a weapon. He strides forward to meet his opponent: a large, scaley, web-footed, three-headed bird. One of the bird's heads confronts the warrior; the second curves back to the unseen lateral face; and the third attacks a small cringing human figure sketched between the two oppo- nents. Although we have no information regarding the original location of this capital, we can infer that it was .V MV- ............................. FIGURE 1. Fabien van Riesamburgh, sketchbook, foL 28r.

Tossi). in situ when drawn along with the other capitals sketched by van Riesamburgh, such as those noted in the apse of Cluny III.2 The interest of this lost work lies in the fact that it belongs to a group of Burgundian capitals and corbels which illustrate the same enigmatic theme. Most of the representations in the set are well-known.3 Others are introduced here for the first time.4 These associated repre- sentations provide a context for interpreting the lost Cluny capital. Several aspects of the iconography of this group pose methodological and interpretive problems. In the expanded series, a siren consistently accompanies the warrior, bird, and naked human figure. These elements appear to be paired haphazardly, and to undergo transformations of gender and genus. In addition, one or another of the figures may be omitted in a given monument.

Capital of west portal Battle with Three-Headed Bird (photo: author). On the western portal at Montceau-l'Etoile, a hel- meted, web-footed, armed warrior in a skirt of fur or hair faces a winged anthropomorphic demon. The creature's splayed feet and wings relate it to the bird of the series.5 Siren and cringing figure are absent. Three closely grouped pilaster capitals at the entrance to the south apse at Autun originally divided the theme. A capital on the south wall depicts the armed figure stalking a siren. The warrior, in a girdle of fur, displays one clawed and one cloven foot. Originally facing this scene on the southeast crossing capital, now in the Salle Capitulaire, was a naked figure mounted on a fabulous single-headed bird, threatening it with a sword. The three-headed bird appears alone on the western capital of this same pier.6 On the west portal at Perrecy-les-Forges, a con- spicuously male, faun-like creature with splayed feet threatens the monstrous fowl with his slingshot. The human victim, clutching his head, stands behind the bird (Figs. 2, 3). Across the doorway, a double fishtailed siren and a figure of Terra face this scene. At V6zelay, on a capital from the main portal, the armed figure is female. She "MIT RM . ....... . . . . . . . . . . . .

The bird, with noticeable webbed feet here, turns away from her and menaces a siren. A short distance away, on a capital of the Incarnation portal, a male siren brandishes a sword and a viol towards a huddled naked figure, hands held to his head.8 A group of related images occurs in abbreviated form in sculptures of the Donjon workshop, in the southwest Brionnais and Allier.9 All the carvings in this group elimi- nate the warrior and inflate the role of the small cringing figure. With open-mouthed scream, and hands covering his ears, his terror fixes either on the siren or the three- headed bird. Two closely spaced corbels on the south side of the church at Anzy-le-Duc, and two facing capitals in the tower bay at Saint-Etienne of M61ay juxtapose him to the siren. He appears with the bird on an apse capital at Saint-L6ger-sur-Vouzance (Fig. 5).10 In the capitals and corbels of this theme, the mixed pairings paradoxically emphasize the close links among all the protagonists. In addition, despite persistent changes in the figure of the warrior, certain salient features remain 32</page><page sequence="3">A FIGURE 4. Vizelay. Capital of center doorway of west portal. Battle with Three-Headed Bird; Siren (photo: author). constant. Moreover, within each monument, the motifs are located on the same or closely situated capitals in portal or sanctuary settings where they could have been seen together. They would have operated as a unit within the larger context of the surrounding images, and would have taken on additional layers of meaning at each site from their visual context. The iconographic scheme itself must have had a discernible significance important enough, comprehensible enough, and flexible enough to justify its repeated use throughout Burgundy.1" The question of prototype within the series remains to be examined in another forum because it involves important issues of chronology. It is possible to state here, however, that the variants at Cluny, Perrecy, and Vezelay are closely related, while those at Autun, Montceau and in the Donjon shop have a greater number of variables.12 This study attempts to unravel the literary and visual associations in these sculptures, and to suggest how these merge to convey a single theme. Although not indicated in the van Riesamburgh sketch (Fig. 1), the siren must have appeared on or near the Cluny capital of the three-headed bird.13 Her presence, sometimes in several forms, on all the other capitals and corbels of this series argues for this presumption.

FIGURE 5. Saint-L~ger-sur- Vouzance. Apse capital Three-Headed Bird and Screaming Man (photo: author). Middle Ages provide the key to unravelling the enigma of these images. Her key role further supports the hypothesis of her inclusion at Cluny. From the time of Homer, sirens were considered creatures of great beauty,14 whose seductive music cast a fatal spell over mortals.15 In the XIIth book of the Odyssey, Circe warns Ulysses to plug his sailors' ears with wax, and bind himself to the mast of his ship so that he might listen to the sirens' song without following them to his death.16 Ancient authors characterized the sirens' na- ture as a dichotomy of beauty and evil, and compared their music both to the divine harmony of the Spheres and to the strains of Hades.17 Their allure is dual as well: sirens offer carnal pleasure and earthly wisdom. Their erotic aspect became emphasized in the Hellenistic period. Early Christians attributed to them the dangers of pagan knowl- edge,8 and later centuries associated them with the lure of heretical views.19 To the fourth-century Church, sirens represented lax morality and worldly pleasures; Ambrose equates them with the lust of the world and sexual tempta- tion.20 During the Carolingian era a direct association of siren with women amplified this characterization.21 In the monastic world of the eleventh and twelfth centuries she was a timely symbol.22 An important channel for siren iconography in the Middle Ages was the Physiologus/ Bestiary tradition whose basic text derived from secular and ecclesiastical com- mentators and writers of natural history.23 The Physiologus usually pairs the siren with an onocentaur, a hairy creature of antique origin, probably with reference to the siren in Scripture.24 In the Vulgate translation of Isaiah 13:21-22, siren and "hairy ones" (pilosi) raise the specter of the desolation of Babylon and the judgment of licentiousness: 33</page><page sequence="4">Irv FIGURE 6. Le Mas-d'Agenais. Nave capital. Figure Battling Griffon (photo: F. Terpak). But wild beasts shall rest there, and their houses shall be filled with serpents; and ostriches shall dwell there, and the hairy ones shall dance there. And owls shall answer one another there, in the houses thereof, and sirens in the temples of pleasure.25 Like the siren, onocentaurs are also composite crea- tures. Usually represented as a man/horse, in the manner of antique centaurs, they encompass a wider literary and pictorial type. Their actual description is of a creature with an upper part like a man, and a lower part "exceed- ingly wild," or "like an ass."26 In significance and represen- tation these creatures probably derive from fauns or satyrs, companions of Bacchus. They appear throughout medieval art, clad in a hair skirt, with cloven goat-like feet, tail and horns; in antique depictions, often with prominent phal- luses, such as in our series at Perrecy.27 Onocentaurs parallel the siren's double evil nature; they represented las- civiousness,28 and hypocrisy to the medieval world.29 In the Physiologus, the onocentaur hunts the siren with bow and arrow, spear, or other weapon.30 Hamann is most likely correct when he suggests that the cloven/claw- footed hunter stalking the siren on the Autun capital of our group is an onocentaur and conforms to the Physio- logus type.31 Certain characteristics of the armed figure, male and female, throughout the Burgundian series sup- port this identification. Nevertheless, there are significant deviations from the Physiologus format of the onocentaur in the renditions of Cluny, Vezelay and Perrecy. By con- sistently intruding the three-headed bird and cringing figure into the arrangement, and by casting the onocentaur as ilk, FIGURE 7. Agen, Saint-Caprais. Capital from chapter house. Ulysses and Sirens (photo: F. Terpak). warrior, with shield and helmet, pitted against the bird, the Burgundian capitals introduce new layers of meaning consistent with the theme of Luxuria suggested by the siren and onocentaur. In the attempt to decipher the complexities of this iconography, the three-headed bird is a pivotal and problem- atic element. No other representations of this type of creature are known to me. Two-headed birds do occur, usually in a heraldic format.32 The Burgundian fowl differs from most of these in its posture of attack, and in the emphasis on the multiple appendages as elements of evil. Nor does the bird correspond precisely to other three- or multi-headed monsters from Hydra to Chimera, although these creatures were frequently sources for a host of hybrids in the Middle Ages.33 Dragons, in particular, were prone to inventive interpretation; they are commonly repre- sented as winged, scaly, and with one or several heads. In the context of multiple references to Luxuria, and in view of the text of Isaiah which pairs siren and hairy creature in an evocation of Babylon, it is possible that some associa- tion was intended between the three-headed bird and the Beast of Babylon, incarnation of Lust.34 To the medieval observer, familiar with the fluid repre- sentations of demonic creatures, a menacing, tricephalic, 34</page><page sequence="5">Ilk 4,: ON FIGURE 8. Roman floor mosaic. Scylla with Rudder Attacking Sailors. 2nd century A.D. (after B. Andreae, Odysseus: Archaeologie des europaiii- schen Menschenbildes (Frankfort, 1982), n.p.). crested and web-footed bird would have been a suitable evil presence adjacent to the siren. Ancient associations between sirens and birds as demonic agents of death attributed to both the powers of prophecy.35 Siren and bird were fre- quently juxtaposed on Roman funerary monuments, and continued to be linked into the eleventh and twelfth centuries." Occasionally birds were depicted with musical instruments as harbingers of evil in a way that recalls siren imagery.37 Furthermore, birds had erotic connotations that also parallel the siren.38 Nelli discusses the relationship between bird songs and medieval customs of prenuptial love.39 Clearly, whatever other connotations of evil reside in the Burgundian three-headed fowl, the medieval observer would have discerned a close parallel between this bird as a symbol of the fatal lure of erotic love and the adjacent sirens. At the heart of the Burgundian series is the motif of battle as it involves the onocentaur and bird at Cluny, Perrecy and Vezelay. By arming the onocentaur with shield, weapon and helmet, and by confronting him/her with an embodiment of lust, the Burgundian capitals transform the satyr. His evil nature here becomes partly assimilated to the image of the hero.40 The device of battle would have raised associations ranging from mythological "ink FIGURE 9. Corvey. Tribune of Westwerk. Fresco: Ulysses Battling Scylla, ca. 885 (after Corvey, Miinster, Kunst und Kultur im Weserraum 800-1600 (Corvey, 1967), B. Korzus, I, opp. 61). scenes such as Hercules and the Hydra or the Stymphalian Birds,41 to Christianized versions of St. George and the dragon, warring angels, or Psychomachia scenes of Virtues and Vices.42 Such scenes easily entered the repertoire of fabulous creatures; warriors battling griffons, dragons, or multiheaded beasts are a staple of Romanesque art.43 These combats occasionally occur in the vicinity of a siren. In the church at Le Mas-d'Agenais, a nave capital of a figure fighting a griffon, similar in format to the combat in our series, appears near an illustration of a siren (Fig. 6).44 More specifically, the persistent juxtaposition of hero, monster, siren and human victim on our capitals may refer to sequential episodes in the Odyssey: Ulysses' confronta- tion with the sirens, and his battle with the sea monster Scylla.45 Ulysses was a familiar figure to the medieval 46 audience.46 Taken up by Christian apologists, he became a paradigm of Christian virtue. Exposed to worldly tempta- tions, represented by the sirens, he escapes perdition by binding himself to the mast, symbol of the cross.47 In this vein, the classicizing figure of Ulysses bound to the mast,48 or juxtaposed to the siren, survived into the Middle Ages, as on a capital from the chapter house at Saint-Caprais, Agen, where he appears half-naked, shield and weapon in hand (Fig. 7).49 He also retains the characteristic conical helmet by which he is often identifiable in antique represen- tations, and which may explain the hat and shield of the Burgundian examples.5o Although less frequently depicted than other beasts, Scylla also entered medieval monster lore. Difficult to identify even in classical illustrations because of its variable characteristics, Scylla appears sometimes with female torso, fishtail, and barking dogs at her waist (Fig. 8); with multiple monstrous heads; or with a rearing swan-like 35</page><page sequence="6">04r FIGURE 10. Remagen (Rhine). Courtyard gate voussoirs. Scylla/ Saw-Fish; Siren (after H. Blankenburg, Heilige und Damonische Tiere [Cologne, 1975], fig. 35). neck.51 These inconsistencies persisted into the Middle Ages, and favored contamination with other fantastic creatures, particularly with the siren.52 Scylla may have entered the Bestiary tradition as the Serra, or saw-fish, a hybrid bird/fish who attacks sailors.53 Overt parallels between Scylla and the siren were drawn in exegetical literature. Both creatures embody Lust and the lure of heresies, seducing with musical voices.54 It is likely that in the Burgundian representations, the gesture of the victim who holds his hands to his head in relation to the siren or bird shuts out their seductive tones.55 Pictorial juxtapositions of the episodes of Ulysses with the siren and Scylla were common in antiquity and appear occasionally in the Middle Ages. A poorly pre- served fresco in the tribune of the westwork of Corvey, consecrated in 885, depicts Ulysses with buckler and lance attacking Scylla, who has a human figure tucked under one arm (Fig. 9). It has been suggested that a lost com- panion scene of Ulysses with the sirens decorated the other wall.56 The Carolingian example bears comparison with the Burgundian group: both illustrate the semi-naked armed warrior battling a multiheaded beast to protect a helpless victim. While the Carolingian and Burgundian examples share a quasi-narrative flavor like their antique counterparts, most Romanesque illustrations of siren/ Scylla combinations favor an emblematic juxtaposition. The twelfth-century courtyard gate in Remagen includes siren and Scylla (saw-fish) in voussoirs along with Bestiary motifs (Fig. 10)." The appearance of a classicizing format in the Bur- gundian series is consistent with the well-documented interest in antique formulas in Burgundian Romanesque art.58 It may be that the mythological flavor which char- acterizes the Burgundian group derives from a Carolingian intermediary. Nevertheless, the Burgundian capitals are entirely Romanesque in their cast of characters and morali- zing typologies. What we seem to have, then, in the Burgundian rep- resentations of the three-headed bird, particularly at Cluny, Perrecy-les-Forges, and Vezelay, is an overlay of pictorial and exegetical themes.59 Elements from the Physiologus are expanded upon and inventively altered by amalgamation with a mythological heroic battle to which they relate on an exegetical level.60 Neither the Bestiary forms nor the refer- ences to Ulysses iconography emerge intact. Nevertheless, the monastic or clerical audience, and perhaps even the sophisticated lay visitor would have recognized the visual cues and cross-references.6" Siren, "hairy one," multiheaded monstrous fowl, and cringing soul merge as separate but compatible types to convey a single powerful diatribe against the lust of the flesh with warnings against false doctrines. In an age and region where clerical and monastic celibacy had become a major issue of Benedictine reform,62 these capitals would have recalled the warning of St. Jerome to virgins, in his much quoted Adversus Jovini- anum, to shut their ears against the siren-song of worldly pleasures and, like Ulysses, wage war against temptation, lest the church become, like Babylon, a place of harlots, given over to the desecration of sirens, satyrs and dragons.63 In the apse of Cluny, such a theme would have been an appropriate pendant to illustrations of the monastic vocation, against a backdrop of the battle between Virtues and Vices, and in keeping with the interest in music in its spiritual and worldly capacities.64 NOTES 1.

Salet, 179, suggests the V6zelay capital of siren and cringing figure is a distant echo of the Ulysses episode. 46. See M. Scherer, The Legends of Troy in Art and Literature (New York, 1963); W. B. Stanford, The Quest for Ulysses (London, 1974); A. Vandersall, "Homeric Myth in Early Medieval England: The Lid of the Franks Casket," Studies in Iconography, I (1975), 7-31. 47.

Romanesque examples are found on a capital from the west walk of the Moissac cloister, cf. M. Vidal, Quercy roman (La Pierre-qui- Vire, 1960), 47-49, pl. 36; at the entrance to the north apse of Sauve-Majeure. Cf. H. Couzy, "Les ch^piteaux de La Sauve- Majeure," Bmon, CXXVI (1968), 345-72, fig. 3. 49. I am indebted to F. Terpak for bringing this and other images of sirens and grotesques to my attention. F. Terpak, "The Roman- esque Architecture and Sculpture of Saint-Caprais in Agen" (Dis- sertation, Yale, New Haven, 1982); and idem "The Role of the Sainte-Eutrope Workshop in the Romanesque Campaign of Saint- Caprais in Agen," Gesta, XXV (1986), 185-96. 50.

Die Taten und Leiden des Heldes in Antiker Kunst und Literatur (Darmstadt, 1983); O. Touchefeu-Meynier, "Thbmes odyssiens dans l'art antique" (Dis- sertation, University of Paris, Paris, 1968). 51.

Mitteilungen des deutschen archaeo- logischen Instituts, Rom. Abt., VII (1980), 29-56. 52. Vieillard-Troiekouroff, "Siranes-poissons," 61-82, discusses the con- flation of siren and Scylla. For an octopus form of Scylla, see V. Mann, "Mythological Subjects on Northern French Tablemen," Gesta, XX/ 1 (1981), fig. 5; H. Schrade, "Draussen vor der Tur. Dimonen und Monstrendarstellungen an Romanischen Portalen," Stimmen der Zeit, CLXIX (1961-62), 415, identifies a multiheaded beast on the upper lintel of Beaulieu as Scylla. Familiarity with the dog-like aspect of Scylla persisted in the Middle Ages; see Vieillard- Troiekouroff, "Sirenes-poissons," 79. 53. G. Druce, "The Legend of the Serra or Saw-Fish," Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of London, 2nd ser., XXXI (1919), 28; McCulloch, Bestiaries, 164-65, cites a variant: a web-footed bird with a cock's head. 54. Virgil, Aeneid, VI, 286, places a siren near a centaur and Scylla; Isidore of Seville, Etymologiae, XI, III, 30 (Migne, PL, LXXXII, 423). In texts which formed the basis of many later medieval writings on chastity and heresy, St. Jerome cites Ulysses, sirens, Scylla and onocentaurs on several occasions: Contra Vigilance (Migne, PL, XXIII, 339A; XXIV, 159C); Contra Ruf., III, 22 (Migne, PL, XXIII, 473B). For other texts see P. Antin, Recueil sur St. Jerome, V, "Les sirenes et Ulysses dans l'oeuvre de St. Jerome," Collection Latomus, XCV (Brussels, 1968), 59-70. 55. Touchefeu-Meynier, "Sirene-poisson," 452-59, cites a Roman lamp from Canterbury which shows Ulysses at the mast and a sailor holding his ears. Jerome emphasized willing deafness, like that of Ulysses, to resist heresy: In Mic., I, 6, LXX (Migne, PL, XXV, 1158C); In Osee, IX, 10 (Migne, PL, XXV, 897A). 56. H.

Trask (Princeton, 1953), 11-13, suggests that "multi-layeredness" is a basic element of Romanesque visual and verbal epic art. G. R. Evans, The Language and Logic of the Bible: The Earlier Middle Ages (Cambridge, 1984), 5, discusses the medi- eval insistence on multiple meanings. 60. St. Augustine, De Doctrina Christiana, I, ii, 2 shows how interpre- tation can be aided by elements that have a likeness ("similitudo") in a literal or metaphorical manner. Cf. Evans, Language, 104. 61. On visual cues, see Seidel, Songs of Glory, 51-52. 62. H. C. Lea, History of Sacerdotal Celibacy in the Christian Church, I (New York, 1907); H. E. J.
