<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE EVOLUTION OF THINKING R. J. PUMPHREY ALTHOUGH this title may seem pretentious and to some, perhaps, even irrelevant, I do not think that Darwin would have been shocked by it. He wrote the prolegomena for a treatise on the subject in 1872 and he would, I think, rather have been shocked that the road he indicated had not been further explored. For here Darwin failed in his en- counter with prejudice, a failure which he owed at least as much to his well-meaning friends as to his enemies. 'Man is an animal' said Darwin in effect. 'Certainly', said the friends, who had made it their task to put Darwinism across, 'Man is the reasoning animal, the self-conscious animal, the talking animal, the constructor of railways and ethics, the inventor of law and conscience and differential equations, the highest animal, the animal with free will.' Such comfortable words smoothed the passage of the evolutionary hypothesis, for it was seen that it had no personal application. The man in the street might have inherited his kidneys from his ancestors, but his mind at least was wholly his own. Rousseau was right in his opinion that man was born free. The shackles in which he was subsequently observed to be entangled were an unfortunate accident. Theoretically he was still safely in his Cartesian observatory, divinely privileged to observe the universe and all the other animals from outside. The wall which Descartes had erected between man and the animals was still there and apparently as solid as ever. But, in case it had been shaken by Dar- winism, steps were taken to buttress it. Anthropomorphism was raised to the status of a heresy. The intelligence of animals was debunked by a number of striking public trials, such as those of the Elberfeld horses and Clever Hans. The canon of Lloyd Morgan was ruthlessly applied, and doubters were effectually silenced by the simple expedient of denying credence to any account of animal behaviour which could not be reproduced at will in the laboratory. These measures were effective and the wall remained stable until it was breached by treachery from within. For although Freud may never have heard of Lloyd Morgan and perhaps regarded the Cartesian wall with indifference, yet, in effect, 1 Paper read to the Philosophy of Science Group, 2Izth January I953. 315</page><page sequence="2">R. J. PUMPHREY he used the canon of the one to blow a hole in the other. The canon runs as follows : ' In no case may we interpret an action as the outcome of the exercise of a higher psychical faculty if it can be interpreted as the exercise of one which stands lower in the psychical scale.' This, if its meaning is not too closely scrutinised, seems to be a meritorious application of Occam's razor. But, in fact, it was simply used to cut the connection between man, intuitively aware of his own intelligence, and animals which, since they could not be questioned directly, could be said in any given circumstances to be simulating intelligent behaviour instinctively. It was held self-evident that instinct was 'lower in the psychical scale' than intelligence. Intelli- gence, nowhere defined, seems to have been tacitly accepted as the capacity to think out the implications of action beforehand. Freud's important contribution was to wreck these implicit assumptions by pointing out the very peculiar r61e of reason in human activities. For, in most cases where human behaviour seemed to an external observer to simulate intelligence (and to the subject himself to be intelligent), analysis showed it to be due either to habit or to an unconscious choice of alternatives for which a rational basis was found subsequently. The function of reason was shown to be the post-facto justification of the unconscious choice. Man must be able to satisfy himself as well as his neighbours that he has behaved himself in accord- ance with the rules in an environment which is also governed by the rules. I use 'rules' here in the widest possible sense as the basis of expectation-that night succeeds day, that creatures behave according to their kind, that a fire warms, that mother will rescue one if one is lost or in difficulties. If the basis of expectation is shattered or radically altered, two results are possible. Reason may keep pace and alter the rules so as to maintain a system of belief consistent with itself. This may be called the rationalisation of the failure of expectation. Or alternatively, reason may fail to deal with the situation, in which case the result is a feeling of inferiority or the kind of psychic trauma called neurosis or hysteria. Since neurosis is so clearly linked in man with inadequacy of that process of conscious reasoning which we call in common speech thinking, it seems to me profoundly significant that neurotic symptoms are so readily provoked in mammals, and probably also in birds and even insects, and that by methods which can be subsumed under the general heading of removal of landmarks. These may be actual landmarks, indicating to the subject that the familiar environment 316</page><page sequence="3">THE EVOLUTION OF THINKING persists in its familiar relations, or they may be metaphorical landmarks -the rules of expectation governing familiar changes in the environ- ment. The distinction is not absolute, and the effects of removal are similar. Changes of actual landmarks which make the animal feel lost, like Blake's little boy; substitution of punishment for reward after the solution of a problem which the subject has learnt to solve correctly; alteration of the conditions of an accustomed problem, so that a correct solution becomes impossible or purely chance : all these are standard methods which produce fairly standard results, though individual idiosyncrasy is marked as in the human case. It is important to realise that it is not the setting of an insoluble problem in itself which is an efficient cause of neurosis. It is essential first to create the ex- pectancy that the problem can be solved. It is not the total obliteration of landmarks which is effective but their displacement, so that familiar guides, on which reliance has been learnt, prove to be misleading. It is necessary to breach the animal's confidence in the rules, to reduce him to literal or metaphorical bewilderment. The symptoms are much as might be expected if the analogy with human behaviour is exact. Mild cases exhibit active appetitive or exploratory behaviour clearly directed towards re-establishing familiar- ity and creating new rules of expectancy, followed, if these efforts are unsuccessful, by passive waiting 'until this tyranny be overpassed'. Severe cases exhibit stereotyped postures and acts, which are not meaningfully related to the prevailing environmental circumstances and which persist long after the cause is removed. In such cases, learned accomplishments are generally lost, and even feeding and mating may be adversely affected. Freud attributed a secondary unconscious purpose to the apparently purposeless manifestations of neurosis and hysteria-that of attracting notice and enforcing aid and solicitude. If he was right, this appears to be the only notable difference between the animal and human conditions. Even this may not be a real difference, for much of the behaviour of the neurotic animal may plausibly be interpreted as a return to 'infancy '-an attempt in the Freudian sense to reproduce the conditions in which mother will come to its aid. I have suggested that reasoning or thinking is always related retrospectively to the solution or non-solution of a problem in the light of accepted rules and a consequent state of expectancy. It does not, of course, follow that because it is retrospective that it is therefore epiphenomenal and ineffective; for all problems have something in 317</page><page sequence="4">R. J. PUMPHREY common and most real problems have much in common. Conse- quently, retrospective thinking about a choice already made may be, and, in general, probably will be, effective in contributing to the next choice. To my mind the evidence is decisive that animals think in the way that we do, and that both in animals and ourselves, thinking depends absolutely on the ability to accept experience in the form of rules, by which expectation is usually fulfilled. It is very easy within limits for us to impose new rules on an animal by the methods of conditioning and Dressur, but I think it is profoundly mistaken to suppose that the process by which the animal assimilates them is usually wholly auto- matic and passive. Even Pavlov realised that what he (or his trans- lators) rather oddly called the 'curiosity reflex' is prepotent. An animal transferred to a new environment has to satisfy himself of the new rules which are appropriate. The process by which he does it is partly assimilative but partly creative. He explores, but he also erects signposts. And not until he has re-established familiarity does his behaviour approach normal. The length and elaboration of this process in the rat is only now beginning to be recognised. An under- standing of it explains some of the anomalies in the many experimental investigations ofmaze-running in rats, but it also, I think, throws doubt on the validity of many of the published conclusions. It is sometimes asserted that man has a conscience and animals have not. I am using the word in its common speech sense and in this sense the assertion seems to me plainly false. A cat, normally fed on the kitchen floor, if it is clouted for taking food off the table, becomes for a time nervous about taking food anywhere in the kitchen. It has a bad conscience. An Airedale, which on neutral territory would bite a smaller dog in half, will fly in panic from a Pekinese if he meets the latter on his own ground, which is strange to the Airedale. In this case the Airedale has a bad conscience and the Pekinese a good one. Quite evidently a 'bad conscience' describes the state of discovering that the accepted rules have let one down or that one has entered a region where they are no longer self-consistent. It appears to be exactly equivalent to a feeling of inferiority or inadequacy consequent on the non-fulfilment of expectation-of stepping, so to speak, on a stair which is not there. I turn now from the conscience question, which deserves a much more careful analysis than I have time for, to counting, another aspect of thinking, and one which man has been inclined to regard as his own 318</page><page sequence="5">THE EVOLUTION OF THINKING prerogative, in flat defiance of the evidence. Kronecker's dictum: 'God made the integers; all else is the work of man', seems to have perpetuated a belief that counting starts with a knowledge of the integers, and even Otto Kahler, who recently demonstrated in the laboratory that birds can count when suitably motivated, a fact long known empirically to wild-fowlers-even K6hler suggests that the process of counting by birds differs radically from the human operation. On the other hand, Piaget's work on the ontogeny of counting by children seems to imply that it depends on something much more fundamental than the integers. A child of four, who has not yet learnt to count by numbers, and who is shown a set of eggs and a set of egg-cups, has no difficulty in withdrawing an egg for every egg-cup until one or both of the sets is empty. This counting by one-to-one correspondence seems to be primitive. In a sense it is a special case of a use of correspondence, which must surely be common to all animals capable of sensory experience in more than one mode, since without it, it would not be possible to associate an appearance with the corresponding smells, sounds and so on. The small boy counting egg-cups with eggs is not limited by the size of the sets, but he is limited in two ways, which seems to be significant : first, by the functional relation between egg and egg-cup. An apple or a match-box among the egg-cups is ignored even when the set of eggs has been emptied. He is counting egg-cups by means of eggs. He is not ticking off all discrete objects which are accessible. Secondly, there is the temporal limitation. The sets must be simul- taneously present. He cannot tick off eggs today against egg-cups seen yesterday, though he may be able to say 'more ' or' less ' if the size of the sets is substantially disparate and not too great. To return now to the birds. Kahler, using pigeons, parrots, jackdaws and ravens, succeeded in establishing a one-to-one corre- spondence in the minds of the birds between the number of objects displayed to them in an arbitrary spatial arrangement and the number of discrete acts of swallowing pieces of food which was permissible at one sitting.' The correspondence was effective up to 5 or 6 for pigeons and up to 7 or 8 for ravens and parrots. It is an asymmetrical 1 It was suggested in the discussion that K6hler's observations are explicable in terms of eidetic imagery. If this means that an eidos is associated with the fiveness of five objects irrespective of their size, shape and spatial arrangement, it seems to be an explanation of the more simple in terms of the more difficult. If not, it does not appear to be an explanation at all. Y 319</page><page sequence="6">R. J. PUMPHREY type of correspondence between sets of different kind, which has not, so far as I am aware, attracted the intensive interest of either psycholo- gists or logicians, though it would seem to be of fundamental importance. The asymmetry may be exemplified by reference to human experience. Suppose a man is asked to remove an egg from a set of eggs every time he hears a gong stroke. Provided the strokes do not succeed each other too rapidly, there is no difficulty and no limit except physical exhaustion. The whole pattern can be regarded as a one-to- one correspondence between commands and the execution of com- mands. All this is well known to be within the competence of many mammals, birds, reptiles and fish, though the similarity is often disguised by language, students of animal behaviour being prone to use the terms, sign-stimulus in lieu of command, release in lieu of execution, habituation or exhaustion ofaction-specific energy in lieu of inattentiveness or loss of interest. Suppose, however, that a man is asked to strike a gong once for every egg in a set of eggs. It is immediately obvious that the task is impossible of accurate performance in the general case except by subterfuges, but it is important to see exactly why and to investigate the nature of the possible subterfuges. The set of gong strokes is a temporal set or series such that the ordinal number of the last member and the cardinal number of the set are equal. On the other hand, the set of eggs in a circumscribed region, say, on a table, has no ordinal numbers and it would seem impossible in principle to determine its cardinal number (if the latter is more than one) except by seriation, that is by taking the members of the set one after the other in time. It follows that the cardinal number of two sets A and B can be compared if, and only if, the members of both sets can be taken one at a time and paired off more or less simultaneously, that is by making both sets into corresponding temporal sets. Obviously by introducing a third temporal set, the set of integers, C, and by means of an adequate extension of memory, the condition of' more or less simultaneously ' can be relaxed for the comparison AB since it can be executed by making the comparison AC now and the comparison BC in a week's time. But the condition still holds individually for the comparisons AC and BC. What meaning must we assign to more or less simultaneously if the comparison with the integer set is excluded ? Evidently in the case considered the man may without difficulty take an egg from the set, walk across the room to strike a gong and repeat this cycle indefinitely. 320</page><page sequence="7">THE EVOLUTION OF THINKING Memory, both in man and animals, easily bridges the gap between a command and its execution unless more commands occur in the gap. But suppose the man takes eggs from the set n at a time and subsequently walks across to strike the gong n times, is there an upper limit for n above which inaccuracy becomes probable ? An experimental answer should be attainable, but it is practically difficult to interpret if the subject is accustomed to counting by integers. Since, however, we have seen that counting by integers and counting by gong strokes are fundamentally similar processes, the following experiment is relevant. A random arrangement of objects in a circumscribed field is exposed to the subject's view for a period too short for him to count them. He is subsequently asked how many objects were exposed. It is found, provided that the objects are similar, and, by reason of size and contrast, sufficiently prominent, the answer is generally correct if the number of objects is not more than five or six. It follows necessarily that the operation of seriation can be performed upon the mental image or memory trace of the set of objects which has been exposed.1 If we admit what seems to be self-evident, that the opera- tion of counting is basically the same whether the comparison set is the set of integers or the set of gong strokes or the set of acts of swallowing peas, then the experiment just described-also due to Kahler-closely simulates his experiments with birds. It is perhaps of some interest that man's performance is about as good as a pigeon's but not as good as a raven's or a parrot's. The raven's performance is the more remark- able in that he can get the right answer even if the members of the set of object-signals are grossly dissimilar, and this ability to single out denumerability as the only property of the members of the set which is relevant to the situation seems to indicate a considerable facility for abstraction. The peculiar usefulness of the set of integers lies in their being assigned proper names which determine uniquely their order and the place of each in the series. In most systems these names are arbitrary up to ten and then repeat with a systematic difference so that the name of any number, however large, can be constructed by simple rules. There seems to be some philological evidence for believing that one 1J. S. Huxley drew attention in the discussion to the 'intention movements' used occasionally by jackdaws in checking, i.e. recounting the number of acts of swallowing without repeating them. This appears to fit exactly with the interpre- tation here adopted, and to show that seriation of the memory trace actually occurs in birds. 321</page><page sequence="8">R. J. PUMPHREY and two antedate the rest of the series, and there are, I believe, tribes which have only the three numerical adjectives, one, two and many. It seems a plausible guess that both counting by named integers and a system for constructing the names of large numbers originated in the first pastoral society at the point where it was becoming inconvenient to give a proper name to each individual member of a flock. A shepherd ticking offhis flock as it came through a gap : Agatha, Mary, Susan, Jane, would be quick to realise that, if the total tally of names and sheep were equal, it did not matter for this purpose whether each sheep got its right name, and that a fixed order of names was easier to remember and later to transfer to a different set of sheep. Simultane- ous ticking with fingers could introduce a periodicity of ten ; and the addition of determinatives indicating the decade and century seems a relatively trivial addition to the main invention. The suggestion that the names of the integers are buried names of sheep may not be true in any exact historical sense, and it is very unlikely that it could be proved to be true; but it seems to me very probable that it is a true parable. If I have laboured this business of counting to the point of tedium, it is for two reasons. In the first place, it brings out what is apparently an unexpected similarity in the working of the minds of birds and men, where most people have for a hundred years been concerned to demonstrate expected differences. It is a further breach in the Cartesian wall. In the second place, the ability to perceive and retain the perception of a one-to-one correspondence between members of dissimilar sets, even when the correspondence is blurred by a lack of temporal coin- cidence, is the basis not only of numeration but of speech. The correspondence between things or acts and their names, by which the thing suggests the name and the name suggests the thing, is strictly one-to-one. The arithmetic of words is Diophantine, and fractions of words have no more use than fractions of egg-cups. Evidently this is not the only type of correspondence. The correspondence between sensory impressions in different modes, to which I have already referred, is quite obviously a correspondence of continua. The appearance and the sound and the smell of running water have no definite spatial and temporal boundaries. Sensory impressions in general are no more denumerable than the elements of an Irish stew. The ability to recognise, as significant, denumerable elements in the Gestalt is quite possibly a consequence of the possession of eyes and ears of high 322</page><page sequence="9">THE EVOLUTION OF THINKING resolving power. We share these with most birds, but I hazard the guess that it may prove difficult to repeat Ki6hler's experiment with mammals other than primates and perhaps squirrels. It seems appropriate at this point to emphasise two relevant facts. I think it is fair to call them facts, though the paucity of our knowledge is so extreme, that there is inevitably an element of conjecture. So far as we know, the languages, or the communication systems of non-human animals, are based mainly on the correspondences of continua. Their symbols or sign-stimuli are not, in their employment, particulate like words, but are capable of infinitesimal gradation of meaning within their field of reference. The correspondence between symbol and meaning is approximate, and the approximation can, in theory at least, be made as close as is desired. This is evidently true of the system by which a bee, returned from foraging, indicates to her fellows the co-ordinates of a source of nectar. It appears to be true generally, so far as our very scrappy knowledge goes, of the employ- ment of visual and aural symbols by all classes of vertebrates and some invertebrates. It would seem prima facie that it is of necessity true of odorous symbols, whose importance for most mammals is hardly questionable, however trivial a part odours play in our own lives. It is true of the human language of gesture (excluding arbitrary sign languages). The direction of an object can be indicated by pointing to any desired accuracy. Any degree of indifference can be signified by raising the shoulders to any desired height within anatomically determined limits. In this type of language the number of symbols and of the fields within which they are significant is necessarily very limited, but each symbol within its field is capable of an infinity of related shades of meaning. In a 'purely' verbal language, on the other hand, although the number of symbols is theoretically infinite, there is a one-to-one relation between each symbol and a corresponding meaning or group of meanings, and it is consequently impossible in principle by their use to approach indefinitely close to accuracy in the transmission of information. This defect of particulate systems crops up in other connections, in cybernetics and in quantum theory. A case of some interest is the transmission of messages in sensory nerves, where it is easily shown that as a consequence of the particulate nature of the message, which consists of discrete and equivalent impulses separated by variable intervals, the parameters of a stimulus can be transmitted only with indefinite accuracy in an indefinitely long time. The information received at the central end is necessarily both inaccurate 323</page><page sequence="10">R. J. PUMPHREY and out-of-date, and its possible accuracy is inversely related to its possible immediacy. Similarly it may be said of any purely verbal statement that it is either too short to be accurate or too long to be useful, but here the limitation is practical. If it is true in theory that indefinite accuracy of verbal statement could be attained by an in- definite increase in the length of the statement and in the number of different words used, it is nevertheless also true in fact that the average man can only deal with a vocabulary of a few thousand words and of these a very large proportion are used so infrequently that their ambiguity is large. Spoken human languages are, of course, not purely verbal systems. The particulate words are associated with intonation which is capable of continuous variation and so of infinitesimal gradation of meaning, and are often supplemented by gesture of which the same is true. Such a balance of two systems of communication might be expected to compensate for the defects of either and to some extent it does. But its usefulness is limited by the impossibility of transcribing anything but the purely verbal component. The inventions of writing and printing have dragged the balance down on the verbal side. It remains to be seen whether radio and television will restore it, but I suspect it is too late. Five thousand years is a long start. It seems worth while, therefore, to glance briefly at the way in which the defects inherent in purely verbal systems have been evaded or overcome. It is a field in which I make no claim to be expert or even to be informed above the average, but certain general propositions seem worth stating if only for the purposes of argument. The problem facing the users of a verbal language in a changing environment is to invent new words and to enlarge or change the meaning of old ones without introducing more than a minimal amount of ambiguity. It is, I think, obvious that definition is no solution. Definition, as Lytton Strachey pointed out in connection with the Thirty-nine Articles, is only effective and, indeed, only possible when there is already agreement among users about the meaning of the term to be defined. Definition is the crystallisation of an accepted meaning; it is not the road to it. I hazard the conjecture that new words and new meanings (not only those which are onomatopoeic) invariably arise by analogy. The process involves an operation, or sequence of operations, which may be explicit or implicit and is equivalent to saying : X (the unknown) is like A, is like B, is like C, etc., where A, B, C, are terms of accepted 324</page><page sequence="11">THE EVOLUTION OF THINKING meaning. The Kingdom of Heaven is like a grain of mustard seed, is like a lamp hidden under a bushel, is like the eye of a needle, is like a man that is an householder. The emergence of new meaning is evidently dependent on the co-operation of speaker and auditor, writer and reader: 'They that have ears to hear let them hear'. Anyone who attempts like Humpty Dumpty to be the master of words and to inflict new meaning on his readers condemns himself to perpetual misunderstanding. I have taken a case where the analogy is explicit, but a cursory hunt through an etymological dictionary discloses how very few of the terms of, say, physics, are arbitrary, and how many derive by more or less extended analogies from roots which are connected with personal and intimate acts and entities and which are therefore presumably very old : distance from 'standing away from', interval from the space between two hedges, mass from a lump of dough and ultimately from the act of kneading, time from stretching. All such terms can be truly regarded as buried parables or metaphors or analogies, and I do not think it is too far-fetched to trace a resemblance between the correspondences by which the meaning of words is extended and the correspondences by which things are counted; or to maintain that analogy is a proper description of the process by which such correspondences are detected in both cases. I now venture on even more dangerous ground. I assert the proposition that the behaviour of animals and men expresses a funda- mental conflict which I should be willing to call dialectical if I was sufficiently sure of what is meant by that word. The conflict is between the tendency to abide by the rules of expectancy and the tendency to increase the region in which the rules can be applied. Each venture into new territory involves the risk of the unexpected and the consequent necessity of a new synthesis of the rules. Each failure to venture preserves the rules at the expense of freedom. This is perhaps platitudinous in its application to man. I merely point out here that it appears to apply with equal exactness to the territorial adventures of a dog or a robin and to the most exacting intellectual adventures of mankind. I also assert the proposition that the distinction between instinctive and intelligent actions is misleading, and that the creation of a hierarchy of psychic faculties in which intelligence is placed above instinct is artificial and false. Instinct is the inherited framework within which behaviour is possible; intelligence is the degree of freedom within that framework. Again, so far as man is concerned this may seem a 325</page><page sequence="12">R. J. PUMPHREY platitude. None of us would, I presume, admit that his sex-life was wholly instinctive, but surely none would claim that it was wholly rational. I merely point out here that the stereotypy of instinctive actions by animals is largely the result of the tendency of human observers to abstraction and selective description. It is convenient for classificatory purposes to regard all horses as equal, but no user of horses makes the mistake of supposing it to be true. And no accurate observer of behaviour believes that a similarity of instinctive actions sufficient for group classification implies identity. It is indeed obvious that some kinds of instinctive actions appear more hidebound than others; it is true that for some species of animals the whole inherited framework is stricter and the degree of freedom less than for others. This corresponds to the rather old-fashioned distinction between animals which are adapted to their environment and those which are adaptable. But there is no animal which is not in some degree adapted and none which has wholly lost adaptability. There is no absolute distinction between the bound and the free. There are only different degrees of freedom. As I have tried to show, human speech is a product of a conflict which at once enlarges the field of possible action and restricts action by the necessity of compliance with rules on which intelligibility depends. Intellectual progress depends on tampering with the rules so tactfully that ambiguity is minimal. But some ambiguity there must be. No experimenting with the rules means stagnation. Too vigorous an attack results in unintelligibility. And, as in the case of so-called instinctive acts, the framework of rules is common to a group, but the tampering is individual and unique. This is I think a point of real importance. I suspect it accounts for the one-sided treatment which animal behaviour has received. Re- spect for the controlled experiment and the statistically significant result has concentrated attention on the rules to the exclusion of the exceptions. Masses of statistics about the mean Wistar rat are avail- able. Their validity is in any case dubious because, as Haldane and Spurway have pointed out, the Wistar rat is not normal, but, if it were, it would still not be the mean rat but the exceptionally talented and adventurous and adaptable rat, the leader and trail-blazer who is in- teresting. And to him, statistics about the mean rat are about as relevant as an I.Q. examination of the population of this country at the accession of William and Mary would have been to an estimate of Isaac Newton. There is some relevance but not much. Newton was undoubtedly 326</page><page sequence="13">THE EVOLUTION OF THINKING bound by the intellectual climate of his time, but it was his marginal freedom which was important and significant. The concept of the mean rat has its uses; but to mistake an actuarial convenience for the reality is a fantasy of the same kind as may tempt us to make a deal with the average Russian, or to imitate the American Way of Life.
