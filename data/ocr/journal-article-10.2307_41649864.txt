<plain_text><page sequence="1">GRÉGOIRE ESPESSET Criminalized Abnormality, Moral Etiology, and Redemptive Suffering in the Secondary Strata of the Taipingjing An earlier paper ( Scripture of mine of devoted Great Peace to ) writing dealt mostly and orality with material in the Taiping from ( Scripture of Great Peace ) dealt mostly with material from the major textual stratum, or layer, of the text generally called "A" by sinologists.1 It focused on the origin of knowledge and the emergence of an orthodoxy as a historical phenomenon (at an epistemological level) comparable to the political principle of centralized, unified power, a process in which writing played a major role. But ways of writing also play a great part in two minor textual strata or layers of the Taiping jing, generally referred to as B- and C-text. Stratum В has been charac- terized as presenting a "Heavenly Lord" (tianjun^Wi), a "Major god" (i dashen AW) and "Divine Men" ( shenren #A), who introduce various bureaucratic procedures of the unseen world to which men submit af- ter their death. A recurrent procedure is the permanent recording of human deeds on administrative documents by zealous divine officials of this Heavenly bureaucracy so as to determine each individual's pos- sible eligibility for a celestial office following death.2 Stratum В com- The author is indebted to Donald Harper, John Lagerwey, and Michael J.

The best bibliography on TPJ studies appears in Chen Ligui РЖШШ ed., Liang Han zhuzi yanjiu lunzhu mulu I9I2~I996 (Taibei: Hanxue. yanjiu zhongxin, 1998), pp. 391-407 (205 items, no. 5227-431); and Chen Ligui, ed., Liang Han zhuzi yanjiu lunzhu mulu iggy-2001 (Taibei: Hanxue yanjiu zhongxin, 2003), pp. 194-202 (98 items, no. 2421-518). The "stratigraphy" of the TPJ was first analyzed by Xiong Deji "Taipingjing de zuozhe he sixiang ji qi yu Huangjin he Tianshidao de guanxi" Lishi yanjiu 4 (1962), pp. 8-15. Subsequent attempts were based more or less on his sec- tioning of the material into three forms: the first (called "A" by Western sinologists) is entitled "questions and answers the second, "prose or "C"; and the third, "dialogue fíIŽfit," or "B." According to Xiong, forms 2 and 3 are closely related. Chapters of dubious nature - including the four juan written in meta-script (the still non-deciphered "doubled characters ШЗС" and three juan , consisting of pictures probably of late origin - are not clas- sified in Xiong's three-fold scheme. 2 This important aspect of writing in TPJ also reflects the development of the civil admin- istration during the first centuries of imperial China.

Takahashi Tadahiko's careful study of B-material, a stratum that he does not call "dialogue fígSfft," as Xiong Deji did, has led him to divide it into two substrata: a "conversational form #gSi§," which in- cludes only passages of purely dialogue style, and a "lecturing form ШШШ" made up of the remaining non-dialogue parts.3 According to Takahashi, these two substrata contain the oldest parts of the extant Taiping jing material, but his line of argument is far from convincing and the issue remains open to discussion.4 Following Hachiya Kunio, who included in his stratigraphy quotations of the Taiping jing collected by Wang Ming in his critical edition, Jens 0stergârd Petersen has ar- gued that textual elements from the later, abridged edition of the text, the Taiping jing chao Ж2?!!# [Transcription of the Scripture of Great Peace ) which happen to be similar in style and themes to B- or C-material, should also be included in these strata. For example, a long fragment in juan 9 should be included in stratum B.5 The version of Taiping jing included in the Zhengtong daozang аЕШ bureaucratie céleste: Recherches sur l'économie et la société de la Chine traditionnelle (Paris: Gallimard, 1968), pp. 13-67. 3 See Takahashi Tadahiko "Taiheikyõ no shisõ kõzõ" Tõyõ bunka kenkyüjo kiyõ 95 (1984), pp. 296-97. Except for the division of Im- material into two substrata, and minor shifts from one stratum to another, Takahashi's classi- fication into three forms is derived from Hachiya Kunio "Taiheikyõ ni okeru genji bunsho, kyõ, shü, tsüno shisõ" Tõyõ bunka kenkyüjo kiyõ 92 (1983), pp. 36-38, which itself is derived from Xiong's pioneering stratigraphy. In a further study, Takahashi isolated and described the content of 36 fragments from chapters correspond- ing to both substrata; see Takahashi, "Taiheikyõ no kaiwatai no seikaku ni tsuite" Tõyõ bunka kenkyüjo kiyõ 105 (1988), pp. 243-75. Benjamin Penny, "A System of Fate Calculation in Taiping Jing" Papers on Far Eastern History 41 (1990), p. 6, n. 7, and Barbara Hendrischke, "The Concept of Inherited Evil in the Taiping Jing" East Asian History 2 (1991), pp. 4-5, have criticized Takahashi's distinction of these substrata as unnec- essary, first because both are actually entwined in the sam e juan, chapters and pages - some- times even in the same lines, and secondly because their strong similarity suggests a common source. Chap. 179, for example, is made out of four consecutive paragraphs of varying size, all of which open with the particle wei Ш, and in which discursive and dialogue forms alternate; see Wang Ming ЕЕВД, ed., Taiping jing hejiao (Beijing: Zhonghua Shuju, i960; 1979; hereafter cited as TPJHJ ), pp. 524-43.

The numerical sequences of both juan and chapters are incomplete. In addition, the Dunhuang ifcfê manuscript catalogued as Stein 4226 (MS S. 4226) in the British Library provides the full table of contents (but unfortunately not the text itself) of a sixth-century Taiping jing in which the incomplete structure of the Zfiengtong daozang we rsion fits al- most perfectly. The Dunhuang table of contents indicates a total of 170 juan, and these are grouped into ten sections each having seventeen juan.6 The chapters on which the present study will focus come from juan 110, hi, 112, and 114 of the extant Taiping jing (that printed in Zfrengtong daozang, just mentioned). Moreover, the four juan appear in section 7 ( geng bu j9tn[5) of the table of contents as seen in MS S. 4226. The twenty-four chapters that they contain are mostly characterized as B-material by modern sinologists. But, considering the affinities between both secondary strata, from a thematic and linguistic point of view, I refer to them by the generic term of "non-A" in this paper. Following Hachiya and Petersen, I also quote passages of Taiping jing chao that may be characterized as "non-A" material, notably from juan 9, which is supposedly a résumé of the lost section 9 ( ren bu zEnß) of the Taiping jing. Although a general consensus on the terminology of the Taiping jing strata seems to prevail, the definition of a stratum still depends mostly on its rhetorical form (that is, dialogue or non dialogue, prose or verse) and on the personae involved - with perhaps the exception of Petersen, whose definitions sometimes lack supportive evidence and thus remain cryptic.7 However, both criteria arguably have their own limitations. To begin with the rhetorical form, it is indeed far from be- ing as homogeneous and clear-cut as one may infer from Xiong Deji's three-fold stratigraphy. 6 One may find TPJ in the Daozang as identified via Kristofer Schipper, ed., Concordance du Tao-tsang: Titres des ouvrages (Paris: EFEO, 1975; hereafter, CTT ), no. iioi,y. 35-119. The contents of S. 4226 were first published by Yoshioka Yoshitoyo ^[SJiiil in "Tonkõ bon Taiheikyõ ni tsuite" ^ T, Tõyõ bunka kenkyûjo kiyõ 22 (1961), pp. 1-103; rev. edn., Dõkyõ to Bukkyõ ШШЬШШ (Tokyo: Kokusho kankõkai, 1970) 2, pp. 9-1 14. It shows that TPJ in the ZJiengtong daozang (hereafter, ZD) partly preserved five out of ten sections of the 6th-c. scripture and that TPJC contains abstracts of four out of the five missing sections. The last section and its abstract are both lost. (See also my "Le MS Stein 4226 Taiping bu juan di er dans l'histoire du Taoïsme médiéval," forthcoming.) 7 Petersen, "Taiping Jing and Clepsydra Reform," has adopted Takahashi's distinction of two substrata. He characterizes them, respectively, as "relating the recommendation by a dashen to the tianjun of a person eligible for office in the celestial bureaucracy" (Takahashi's "conversa- tional form") and, somewhat abruptly, as "describing the economic and religious administra- tion of hunger refugees in the Huai River delta" (Takahashi's "lecturing form"). 3</page><page sequence="4">GRÉGOIRE ESPESSET Chapter io6 (sect. 5 , j. 70) provides a good example of the limi- tations of any purely stylistic characterization of the content of the Taiping jing. In this chapter, generally regarded as belonging to the A- text, the dialogue elements actually boil down to the mere indication of the opening question by a disciple (properly formulated as: "A Real Man asks respectfully it Allf«!") and the occurrence of " shan zai Unife" ("Good indeed!"), used to separate the question from its answer - whose speaker remains unnamed.8 Strikingly, the rest of this four-page chapter is entirely discursive and, furthermore, never mentions the Heavenly Master [tianshi^W) assumed to characterize the majority of A-stratum dialogues. Besides, the abridged and edited content of the Taiping jing chao throughout exemplifies how literary elements formerly of A-style dialogue form may be rewritten into non-A dialogue, by means of such tricks as altering the mentions of the alternating speakers and deleting the most colloquial interjections, or even into plain monologue (dis- cursive) text, by deleting all interjections and mentions of speakers and turning what were formerly questions between interlocutors into silent objections raised by the orator himself in the course of his solitary re- flection. As for the various personae involved, comparing chapters of the Taiping jing , passages of the Taiping jing chao , and the numerous Taiping jing quotations from other sources conveniently inserted by Wang Ming in his critical edition shows that, at least from a strictly functional point of view, the Divine Man and Real Men staged in some dialogues may be interpreted as rhetoric substitutes for the Heavenly Master and his disciples specific to A-material. In such conditions, the best way to deal with the extant Great Peace corpus would be to focus on the doctrines and beliefs expressed in the so-called strata (not to mention dubious "substrata") rather than take their eventual rhetoric form at face value.9 In this respect, the present study will appropriately show that, while discussing themes seemingly typical to non-A material, A-mate- rial often proves fully relevant. Now to summarize the characteristics of the content of A-stratum: a master delivers lessons to a group of dis- ciples, tackling various issues relating mostly to cosmology and episte- « TPJHJ, p. 276. 9 For a further analysis of the dialogue form, see Barbara Hendrischke, "The Dialogues be- tween Master and Disciples in the Scripture on Great Peace ( Taiping jing)" in Lee Cheuk Yin ^ and Chan Man Sing eds., A Daoist Florilegium: A Festschrift Dedicated to Profes- sor Liu Ts'un-yan on His Eighty -fifth Birthday (Hong Kong: The Commercial Press Ltd., 2002), pp. 185-234. Despite valuable remarks on the definition of A- and B-text dialogue forms and the difficulty in firmly circumscribing the corresponding strata, the rhetoric form rather than the content remains the prevailing criterion throughout Hendrischke's paper. 4</page><page sequence="5">SECONDARY STRATA OF TAIPING JING mology, plus, in some instances, to sociopolitical concerns (generally dealt with from a symbolic point of view). As a result, sociologically and historically contextualizing elements pertaining to this stratum remain highly problematic, and the reader is given the impression of wandering over a blurred landscape as random themes dictate. Even the toponymy and chronology at times referred to have been standard- ized (for example, a generic Southern Mountain, nanshan ШЦ4), if not fully conceptualized (the successive reigns, through three ages, of Three Augusts, Five Emperors, Three Kings, and Five Hegemons).10 Hence this part of the text may be defined as a treatise on universal order to be restored, and watchfully maintained, by means of a strict adequacy of all possible phenomena to cosmic laws, provided that all beings - first and foremost the earthly ruler of mankind - comply with these revealed laws. Though the Taipingjing non-A-material analyzed in the present study undeniably shares a general worldview with A-stratum, I believe that this material emerged against a specific social, historical, and ideological background, and I am convinced that, whichever stra- tum it conventionally belongs to, it forms a consistent piece. My view is that what we grasp from this background echoes the earliest Taoist communities and seems reminiscent of some of the features of their parish life. Concomitantly, this study will also supplement our knowl- edge of Chinese beliefs regarding life after death, Taoist bureaucratic views of the unseen world, and the relationship between the religious and medical spheres.11 10 See n. 77, below. 11 On various Han and early-Six Dynasties beliefs regarding "life after death," the beyond, and related matters, see Poo Mu-chou, "Ideas concerning Death and Burial in Pre-Han and Han China," AM 3d ser. 3.2 (1990), pp. 25-62; Poo Mu-chou ZJiuixun yiji zhifu, ZJhongguo gudai de xinyang shijie (Taibei: Yunchen wenhua, 1995), pp. 195-227; Ursula- Angelika Cedzich, "Ghosts and Demons, Law and Order: Grave Quell- ing Texts and Early Taoist Liturgy," Taoist Resources 4.2 (1993), pp. 23-35; Michael Loewe, Chinese Ideas of Life and Death: Faith, Myth and Reason in the Han Period (202 B.C. -A.D. 220) (London: George Allen &amp; Unwin, 1982), pp. 25-37; Anna Seidel, "Tokens of Immortality in Han Graves," Numen 29 (1982), pp. 79-122; idem, "Geleitbrief an die Unterwelt: Jenseitsvor- stellungen in den Graburkunden der Späteren Han Zeit," in Gert Naundorf, Karl-Heinz Pohl, and Hans-Hermann Schmidt, eds., Religion und Philosophie in Ostasien: Festschrift für Hans Steininger zum 65.

Several excerpts to be quoted in this paper provide a general view of the bureaucratic and anthropomorphic nature of the unseen world.12 For instance, a passage from Taiping jing chao,13 which describes the circulation of documents up and down the administrative hierarchy, depicts the transmission of the Heavenly Lord's decrees to a Major god, then to a director of agriculture ( sinong who instructs the subordinates in each administrative circumscription. Subordinates have to report to the director of agriculture. Should they fail to do so on time, the director of agriculture would report to the Major god who, in turn, would report to the Heavenly Lord himself.14 It is worth noting that in this passage no explicit distinction is drawn between the divine and human spheres, and the decrees of Heaven apparently reach down to the regions ( zhou ), commanderies {jun), and states {guo) of the world of Man (but we should not forget that in the Chinese mind, which was not conditioned by the Platonic legacy, such an absolute distinction was - and still is - not necessary). Such textual elements enable us to reconstruct the bureaucratic hierarchy of the divine instances that rule the celestial world under the supreme authority of the Heavenly Lord, of whom chapter 180 (sect. 7,/ hi) says that he is prescient (yu zhiM Ä1) and spontaneously knows all the secret matters "in Heaven, under Earth, and in the realm of Man."15 This omniscient, divine monarch, Han Religion In Funeral Texts Found In Tombs," in Akizuki Kan'ei ed., Dõkyõ to shükyö bunka (Tokyo: Hirakawa shuppansha, 1987), pp. 678-714; and idem, "Early Taoist Ritual," CEA 4 (1988), pp. 199-204.

Then the text states abruptly that above the "nine sovereigns AM," who remain unexplained, are "nine lords A§," who are "relatives of," or "close to Щ," the Most High.

Thus the divine monarch occupies the astronomical center of Heaven just like the emperor of men embodies the symbolic cen- ter of the world. See also n. 23, below. 17 In TPJ the use of the word "tian ("Heaven") and the compound " tianjun " ("Heav- enly Lord") clearly follows specific concerns. For instance, though it may occasionally be said to have feelings, Heaven, unlike the Heavenly Lord, is generally not staged as a talking char- acter. On the other hand, the Heavenly Lord, unlike Heaven which is epistemologically in- separable from Earth, has no such cosmological counterpart. Yet what both instances refer to may at times partially overlap, especially as regards moral aspects. 18 In chap. 182 (sect. 7 , у . in; p. 555 of Wang's edition), an isolated occurrence provid- ing no decisive information; in chap. 192 (p. 594), where the taishang zhi jun informs parents and relatives of men of incomparable filial piety # of their conduct; in chap. 193 (p. 594 and 595; see text below); and in chap. 198 (p. 610), where taishang zhi jun is said to be kept in- formed of any evil deed, even minor. ш See TPJHJy p. 555, n. 26. For the sake of completeness, it should be added that the au- thor of the abstracted text has also standardized as " tianjun " (TPJC 5, p. ia; 6, p. 3a) two isolated occurrences of the compound tiangong ("Heavenly Duke," or "the Honorable Heaven") in TPJ A-text, both put into the master's mouth; see chaps. 105 (sect. 5 ,j. 69) and 129 (sect. 6,7. 88), TPJHJ, pp. 262; 263, n. 1; 334; 335, n. 1. Donald Harper has encountered the graph tiangong ("Heaven Sire" in his own translation) in epigraphic material of the ist-c. ad; "Contracts with the Spirit World in Han Common Religion: The Xuning Prayer and Sac- rifice Documents of A.D. 79," CEA 14 (2004), pp. 236-37, n. 28. Harper further emphasizes the similarity of the "structure and function of the spirit world" in both sources (p. 266) and wonders about the possible identity of tiangong in both sources, and of the divine entities re- ferred to as tiangong and tianjun (pp. 257-59). 20 Throughout A-material, taishang has an adjectival function and belongs to the common words whereas in the other two strata it may be interpreted as a variant or equivalent of Heav- en ( tian ), perhaps with stronger religious and hierarchical implications. It should also be re- membered that Taishangis one of the three hypostasis of Laozi in early Heavenly Master Taoism (Tianshi dao ^ЁШШ), the central one, with Wushang on the left and Xuanlao ^ on the right. In TPJ ' the former compound still belongs to the common words (adjectival, i.e. "highest" or "supreme") while the latter does not appear. 7</page><page sequence="8">GRÉGOIRE ESPESSET Taiping jing, qin admits both readings, often in a compound, but the present, isolated occurrence does not allow us to choose definitely be- tween one or the other.) Each one of them has his own affairs to take care of, and all other gods obey them respectfully. Minor gods may not know the designs of the nine sovereigns, to say nothing of ordinary men.

Ordinary people cannot perceive the gods (but) gods recognize each other spontaneously. (Gods) are entirely made of pneuma ( qi JR), how could there be places where they cannot go?

Max Kaltenmark, "The Ideology of the T'ai-p'ing ching ," in Holmes Welch and Anna Seidel, eds., Facets of Taoism: Essays in Chinese Religion (New Haven: Yale U.P., 1979), pp. 36-37, has argued that the Heavenly Lord "appears to be identical with the spirit of the heart ... which is present in the interior of the human body." In my opinion, the passage he refers to does not contain any such statement. 27 See chaps. 187 ( TPJHJ ' p. 572) and 195 (TPJHJ, p. 600). So it is the "director of fate" (siming) who dwells within a man's heart, not the "director of agriculture" ( sinong ), as wrongly assumed in Kaltenmark, "The Ideology of the T'ai-p'ing ching," p. 37. 28 See Taiping jing shengjun mizhi (undated; ZD, fase. 755; CTT 1102), 6a (appearing in TPJHJ, p. 742).

This hierarchy basically distinguishes between major ( dashen ) and minor gods ( xiaoshen 7JNffi) - or elsewhere, rather than this well-known, binary classification, a typically Taipingjing-style, three-fold scale, including "medium gods" [zhongshen ФИ).33 Dashen , in some special instances, explicitly refers 30 Possibly reminiscent of such evocations of the Tao as in the opening sentence of Huainan Zi io, a work edited by Liu An (ca. 180-122 вс): "Tao is supremely high and su- premely profound . . .

As such he is not permitted the slightest pri- vacy, otherwise the Heavenly Lord would demote him, nor does he dare to abandon himself to laziness.34 The following passage of Tai- ping jing chao , which I assume to correspond to the title of chapter 290 (sect. 9, j. 146) in Dunhuang MS S. 42 26, 35 tells us more about that celestial worthy: The High Sovereign, the most venerable of divine beings, calls himself Duke of accumulated pneuma SIR^LŽa.36 He is also called Major god ( dashen ). He stands permanently to the Heavenly Lord's left and presides over the management of the writing of documents of the Hall of Brightness (mingtang^ñlÉL) ,37 Further in the same passage, this Heavenly Lord's right hand man who stands on his left (in accordance with Chinese logic) is said to be "the supreme commander of all divinities," a kind of chief executive- officer "in charge of all gods, each with his own department p|V'38 We learn from chapter 180 that the Major god has "assistants" [fuxiangWÏÏS) - an office said to be similar to that of "State minister" (gongqingi aIP) in human society - of mortal origin, men of great saintliness and virtue who have ascended to Heaven and act as trustworthy managers of the documents transferred to the Hall of Brightness,39 and from chapter xiaoshen " (TPJC 9, p. 13a; TPJHJ ' p. 711) to express the hierarchy of divine officials attend- ing the audience of Heaven 34 See Daoyao lingqi shengui pinjing (ZD, fase. 875; CTT 1201), pp. ib-га (TPJHJ, p. 737)- 35 Weiqi dashen sheng shang mingtang wenshu (col. 249). 36 The expression "accumulated pneuma" refers to both the subtle corporeality of these dematerialized beings and their dietary habits.

All these divine bureaucrats are expected to embody the public realm of idealized human civil service - total devotion to and identification with their duty - and no doubt the same attitude is expected from the Emperor's subjects here below.

For instance, chapter 199 describes its postal net- work in the following way, obviously drawing inspiration from actual regulations presiding over imperial mail: Postal relay stations {(Hlf46 in Heaven have their own registers with instructions ( buling ). Those who ought not to stop (at postal relay stations), let them not stop.

There are high and low officials, and it is not permitted to claim a high position by force or deceit for the purpose of claiming a long stop. Postal relay station clerks47 always take orders from the Heavenly Lord, and whenever (divine officials) pass through postal relay stations, they submit their name and the administrative position they come under. Concealed fraud is not possible.48 From Han first-hand official records (in which postal relay stations are referred to as zhuanshe , as in our text, above), it is possible to infer some of the analogous rules that presided over the proper handling of imperial documents in the Han empire, as well as some of the penalties provided for in case of late or inaccurate delivery.49 Such archeologi- 45 Notably to Taiyi (also written or name of a star close to the "Left Piv- ot," Zuoshu ŽiflM (a Dra), and which may have been regarded as polar (if then observable) around 2500 ВС.

Perhaps more interesting for our main concern is the following occurrence from a typi- cal A-stratum dialogue on longevity in chap. 41 (sect. 3 ,j. 35), in which the master allusively tells one of the disciples: "the director of fate will modify your records" (TPJHJ, p. 34).

From chapter 182 (sect. 7 , y. hi), we grasp that this bureau receives orders directly from the Heavenly Lord himself.73 Finally, the specific administrative handling of human deeds is certainly dealt with by two mirror-organs, the Bureau of Be- nevolence (Shancao ířW) and the Bureau of Malevolence (Ecao SW), jointly referred to in chapter 182 (a single occurrence each).74 These bureaus bring us to the sanction of Man's conduct by celestial authori- ties and its eventual consequences.

Turning to A-text chapter 211 (sect. 7 , j. 118), for instance, we read that to delight in killing, hunting and fishing (acts contrary to the Heavenly Tao and benevolence) constitutes an offense.81 Dialogue-style (but not strictly Taiping jing A-material) chapter 108 (sect. 5, j. 71) mentions, as another example of proscription, "to keep the mouth closed so that (gods of the body) will not disperse."82 We owe to 75 TPJHJ ' p. 613; reading nengtt for nai Jb , a common usage throughout TPJ. 76 Disciples often admit to a fear that their answers or questions will infringe ( Ш , also Щ) the taboos of the master; see chaps. 53 (TPJHJ, p. 78), 60 (TPJHJ, p. 104), 61 (TPJHJ, pp. 112; 124), 62 (sect. 3,7. 46; TPJHJ, p. 129), and 209 (sect. 7,7. 118; TPJHJ, p. 668). This is why they want to learn "what the gods of Heaven and Earth constantly regard as great taboos" (chap. 61 ; TPJHJ, p. 112). Further on in the same chapter, the master tells them that it is Heaven who makes them ask their questions, because Heaven "fears that, among ignorant people, offending (fan) the taboos of Heaven and Earth may never stop" (TPJHJ, p. 125), preventing the advent of Great Peace itself. (See also chap. 211; TPJHJ, p. 672.) Among several other defects, men of later generations are said "to have no taboo," chap. 103 (sect. 4 ,j. 6); TPJHJ, p. 245. Ac- cording to chap. 127, old people who are getting close to the end of their life do not have ta- boos any more (TPJHJ, p. 327), and chap. 154 blames ignoramuses for not following the Tao or respecting any taboos, thus offending Heaven and Earth (TPJHJ, p. 434). 77 "High antiquity" was a prestigious, archetypal embodiment of superior moral qualities. In TPJ, history goes through three declining ages (sangu H"Ě"): a golden age of High Antiq- uity ( shanggu ); Middle Antiquity (zhonggu ФтЁГ), an age of decline; and Low Antiquity (xiagu "Ftì"), an age of disorder. Some passages of the text suggest that Low Antiquity is the peri- od contemporaneous with the author(s) of TPJ, or with the master from A-material chapters. Combined with the four declining governmental principles of Sovereignty j||, Emperorship Kingship 3Í, and Hegemony Щ, the sangu scheme also serves the purpose of duodecimal taxonomy, e.g. in chap. 103 (sect. 4 ,j. 66). 78 TPJHJ, pp. 525; 528; 529; 537.

This colorful crowd, which lumps together nonconformists, freethinkers, potential delinquents, and criminals, also circumscribes by default the narrow path of normality leading to social acceptance, on the side of which watchful mentors, keepers of orthodoxy, are on the lookout for any trespassers. The ethical creation of normality takes shape on the vague borders of social alienation and legal sanction, in early imperial China as elsewhere.84 Concerning Earth proscriptions, the extant chapter 61 (sect. 3 ,j. 45) (also A-stratum) may have inherited fragments of five chapters of juan 1 54 from non-extant section 10 (gui bu 5tã|S), as indicated on MS S. 4226, 85 for its content strikingly matches four of their titles precisely: 1.

As we have seen, special gods produce memoranda to report men's evil deeds, the names of the culprits are entered on divine registers and the Heav- enly Lord, being informed, will reduce the life span of culprits accord- ingly, possibly down to death. This is why the wise men who respect the proscriptions should bring out such written documents and get the common people to know them, warning them that not following their content will prevent them from fulfilling their life mandate and that their "records of evil deeds SIS" will accumulate day after day and seldom decrease - hence the necessary lethal consequences of the in- fringement [fan ) of the admonitions revealed by such documents.94 In chapter 108, the death penalty Wtffc is explicitly promised those who infringe prohibitions ШЕШ95 HUMAN LIFE SPAN AND THE REGISTRATION OF MORTALS The clinching argument of the authors of the laiping jing is simply that of the death threat coming from above. Indeed, if life is a recurring theme throughout the text, so is its fragility. We read, for instance, that though "the mandate of longevity is impermanent,"96 some individuals "do not value their mandate (of life) and believe that once dead, it is possible to live again" (chapter 195),97 while, indeed, "natural longevity is hard to get and, once lost, it cannot be restored" (chapter 17 9). 98 You only live once. On that major concern, we are offered, in chapter 188, the following unparalleled allegory - possibly a later reflection of early Chinese cosmological concepts of "cosmic trees":99 190 ( TPJHJ ' p. 582), and 212, where the master urges the disciples "to bring out these pro- scriptions from Heaven above and not to conceal (them)" (TPJHJ, p. 668).

When the end of one's mandate (of life) is getting near, his or her tree is half alive; when the mandate is exhausted, the tree withers and its leaves fall, and the official in charge fells it.103 Under such conditions, no wonder that one of the disciples concludes a lesson (in A-material chapter 178 [sect. 7,/ 109]) by declaring, to the satisfaction of the master, that he will "never dare to infringe (fan ) any proscription."104 The effective duration of the life span depends on moral conduct, as chapter 203 explains: "good deeds Ш attract life and evil deeds S bring precocious death," and this is why "the texts of benevolent men should be shown to the living so as to have them understand longevity and what provokes the auspicious and the inaus- ±[&gt;&lt;] »105 ]sjot only will the benevolent fulfill their "mandate of picious years" while the malevolent suffer life span abridgment, but "repeated malevolence will bring disaster upon the unborn" (that is, descendants) who "will be ill-fated and will not bring their count (on which, see be- low) to its end" - that is, will die an untimely death.106 This pertains 100 Chap. 181 also alludes to "the soil of Heaven and "the soil of Earth itìi," which grow their own plants and produce their own worthy individuals ( TPJHJ ' p. 547; a passage to emend after Yu, ed., Taiping jing zhengdu , p. 405).

These records are fed by the reports emanating from gods sent by Heaven, gathered to be collated (jujiao ) on a yearly, daily, and monthly basis. A certain number of years is then deducted from each individu- al's life span allotment accordingly.108 But the computation of human life duration, its variations and, ultimately, its inevitable exhaustion, is performed by means of "registers of fate tipfÜ," "records of fate ррЛ," or "account books 8SX."109 As a basic unit for measuring human life span allotment, officials of the divine administration use the "count K," also called "longevity count ЖВ," or "heavenly count ^;К," initially granted to each mortal by Heaven. This numerical datum, which is subject to computation,110 corresponds to the actual duration (perhaps in years) of one's life span, and the termination of life when one's count comes to its end is, as pictured in chapter 131 (sect. 6,/ 90), as ineluctable as the sun setting at the end of the day after having risen at dawn.111 Once one's count has been exhausted and physical death has occurred, 107 On the theory of chengfu , see Kamitsuka Yoshiko "Taiheikyõ no shõfu to tai- hei no riron ni tsuite" Nagoya daigaku kyõyõbu kiyõ А-32 (1988), pp. 41-75; rpt. idem, Rikuchõ Dõkyõ shisõ no kenkyü ь (Tokyo: Sõbunsha, 1999), pp. 301-37; Hendrischke, "Inherited Evil," pp. 8-29; Xing Yitian ТШШШ, "Taiping jing dui shan'e baoying de zai kending, chengfu shuo" Guowen tiandi 87.8-3 (1992), pp. 12-16; Liu Zhaorui ЦЦВр ïrfij, "Chengfu shuo yuanqi lun" ЖШШШШШ, Shijie zongjiao yanjiu ъ 62.4 (1995), pp. 100-7; Lin Huisheng "Chengfu yu lunhui, baoying lilun jianli de kaosuo" ТрСЙИ in Gong Pengcheng ililfM, ed., Haixia liang'an Daojiao wenhua xueshu yantaohui lunwen (Taibei: Taiwan xuesheng ШШ ípífe, 1996), pp. 263-93; and Strickmann, Chinese Magical Medicine , pp. 39-44.

All these "specialists" are incompetent as regards illness provoked by one's misconduct because one's name records ^ Щ are out of their reach.116 However, in some cases, the shortening of life span may be directly inflicted by oneself on one's body, seemingly without regard for the count.

The third juan of the Six Dynasties or early-Tang demonography Nüqing guilii deals with the lifespan penalties incurred for be- having improperly and offending the "proscriptions of the statutes of the Tao хЁЙНР: ã." Twenty-two "precepts of benevolence ШШ" spoken by a Heavenly Master detail, with many repetitions, the number of count units Heaven will delete (спи) or subtract (duo), amounting from 13 units (Precept 2) to 30,000 (Precept 19), the arithmetical average pen- alty exceeding 2,500 units (but the value of one unit remains unspeci- fied).120 In Precept 9, for instance, aimed at those who roam through the country to engage in sexual orgies, provoking perverse disorder which prevents the removal of calamities, deadly calamities hitting seven generations of descendants are added to an already severe deletion of 13,000 count-units.121 118 Baopu zi neipian 6, pp. 5a-b.

It has per- petuated for centuries this belief in the otherworldly accounting of the human life span, in terms similar to those of the passage of Baopu zi just quoted.122 In its opening sentence the ineluctability of the retribu- tion for deeds is compared with "the shadow following the body "123 an analogy that is more than mere euphemism, considering the everlasting presence of divine warders inside every human body.124 Hopefully, and contrary to both the Baopu zi and Nüqing guilii which do not mention that possibility, we read at several places in Tai- ping jing that one's count may be "increased iff"."125 Taiping jing chao shows how this is done: "every human life gets such a heavenly count that obeys constant laws, but, as many men cannot bring their count to its end (that is, their death occurs in an untimely manner), an incal- culable quantity of unused heavenly counts piles up. This is why men of benevolence get their count increased: all (such men's counts) are increased by this 'residual count йК.'"126 A similar statement is to be found in another fragment of Taiping jing chao , which obviously cor- responds to the title of chapter 231 (sect. 8,/ 130) in S. 4226, 127 and adds that such a "residual count" of "one year per count (-unit)" is set aside in Heaven to be granted to the benevolent who behave just like the orator's text instructs them to.128 This is certainly what chapter 195 alludes to when it states that one's records of fate may be altered 122 On Taishang ganying pian , see Cynthia J.

But the accounting of life span is not the single purpose of the documents kept by divine officialdom in the Taiping jing. On the one hand, we learn from a passage of dialogue towards the end of chap- ter 182, between the Heavenly Lord and the Major god, that ordinary people ( suren ) are originally not recorded but, providing they blame themselves for their mistakes ЁИ and show superior benevolence, they may be noticed by divine instances and gain their place in Heav- en's registers.132 This statement partly matches chapter 213 (sect. 7 , j. 119), which, after having discussed the three moral qualities - which are also cosmic principles - of Tao, Virtue ( de Ш), and humaneness (renin),133 goes on to state that the three kinds of people who embody these qualities - corresponding to Yang, Yin and central harmony re- spectively - are entered on registers (luji) while those who do not be- have like them are not, but then says no more on this topic.134 And in chapter 184, which deals with a special class of men whose family and personal names are already registered before their birth, we read that mortals who have been entered on registers (luji) will experience di- vine ascension.135 On the other hand, chapter 181 informs the reader that each time a child is born, there is a " sihou " Щ Ш nearby (perhaps an "official in charge of observations") who enters the event in a regis- 129 Quoted in n. 70, above. mo TPJHJ, p. 625.

In chapter 179, this binary alternative is expressed in the fol- lowing way: "the benevolent shall ascend _h, the malevolent shall suffer penal laws ff'J."147 This is, of course, the well-known, classical binary opposition between reward and punishment in Chinese law, both being commonly regarded as "response," or "retribution Йг."148 140 See chaps. 155 (sect. 6,7. 97): siji (TPJHJ, p. 436); 180: siji zhi wen (TPJHJ, p. 546), sheng luji éËJffcÛ ( ŤPJHJ ' p. 546); 182: shengji fà Щ ( TPJHJ ' p. 556); 183: shouji Ш Щ (TPJHJ, p. 558), shengji ( TPJHJ, ; p. 559); and 196: shengji ( TPJHJ.

They would learn from chapter 202 (sect. 7 , y. 114) that when numerous reports on their misconduct reach the Hall of Brightness to be collated, their names are entered in registers; officers W]Hf are informed about the burden of their transgressions and, in turn, inform the officials of Great Yin ( taiyini Sc ft).168 These officials then summon the culprits' ancestors, interrogate 166 Reading $0 for £P, as suggested by Yang Jilin F#, ed., Taiping jing jinzhu jinyi (Shijiazhuang: Hebei renmin chubanshe, 2002), p. 1398. 167 TPJHJ, pp. 612-13. 168 "Officials of Great Yin:" the text, first, has simply " taiyin " but the administrative con- text is implicit, as the next sentence shows: " taiyin ¿hi It" "officials of Great Yin" 33</page><page sequence="34">GRÉGOIRE ESPESSET Щ and lambast Ш them by way of punishment,169 and order them to return If home to curse their descendants for trying to escape from that burden. If their misconduct does not cease, disease Й will eventually be sent to the moral deviants.170 Elsewhere, in chapter 186 (sect. 7 , j. 112), they would read that "when men's transgressions pile up, officials of Great Yin issue accusations All transgressions, heavy or slight, are recorded in accordance with the laws and, without men knowing of it, numerous records [luji) and gods circulate between the Hall of Brightness of Great Yang and the heads of departments."171 Then "the divine departments of Heaven pronounce death (sentences) and the years of life of the culprits decrease until the annihilation of their life span," that is, physical death.172 Put in a more physiological way, in chapter 188, they would be told that after all the "observers" in the "residences #^5" (that is, gods in men's bodies) have checked the transgressions of people and submitted their periodical reports, the Judicial Bureau of Great Yin (Dayin facao W) calculates the burden which has been accumulated by each individual and de- ducts years from each man's account accordingly.173 In all instances, the evildoers are doomed to a lethal outcome, whether the accounting of life span is alluded to or not. Classically, Great Yin is symbolically associated with Earth, the North, winter, the agent Water, the moon, and death, as opposed to the vital force of Yang associated with Heaven, the South, summer, the agent Fire, and the sun.

Whatever Yin pneuma enhances is inevitably in the Department of Death."180 Though the present study focuses on non-A-material from Taiping jing , we should consider as well A-material chapter 52 (sect. 3,/ 40), which also deals with morals and the afterlife. We learn from the mas- ter's own lips that when the newly deceased reach the subterranean realm of the dead, they are interrogated (ч! on their lifetime deeds and experience,181 in order to have their "name records" ( mingji ) fixed ac- cording to their lifetime deeds, and to be punished on this basis.182 In a similar fashion, non-A chapter 179 warns mortals who persist in misbehaving that they will soon see the Gate of Ghosts JÄP*!.183 Then Earth spirits ШЩ will interrogate (wen) them, in order to check the correctness of their conduct records. If their answers and their records differ, severe ghosts will inflict punishment on them repeatedly until they admit Ш their wrongs.184 Their names will then be transmitted to the Bureau of Fate (Mingcao) for a final verification and, their life al- lotment coming to exhaustion, they will "enter earth Adt." Then their misdemeanors will transfer to their descendants ШШ~РШ.185 The chtho- nian gods responsible for this judicial interrogation belong to a specific administrative organ called the Office of the Soil (Tufu ihJfï). Chapter 181 (sect. 7 , jè in), in which, as we have seen, human fate is deter- mined in accordance with calendrical computations (see above), links "men born from the Earth" (ordinary mortals) with this Office of the Soil.186 Back to chapter 188, we learn that once the Judicial Bureau of Great Yin has calculated the chengfu and reduced each man's account accordingly (as quoted above), one's account comes to exhaustion.

One's ethereal spirits (here ffiž!®, "essential hun") will then be imprisoned ЩЩ and interrogated (wen) for information on their host's lifetime deeds. Should their state- ments differ, they would be beaten by way of punishment (liiezhi flr/n) - just like one's ancestors, in an excerpt quoted earlier - and suffer a great deal.188 Chapter 194 (sect. 7,7. 114) promises malevolent people themselves such a fate: after an untimely death they will be beaten (liiezhi) underground and reprimanded for their deeds, and will endure hardship for the pain they inflicted, without enjoying a single moment of happiness.189 Thus were metaphorically interpreted the decomposi- tion of the corpse after burying and assumed to be painful the fate of the perverted when the time for judgment has come. We have already met the Yellow Springs in A-material, in the context of proscriptions relating to the Earth. The Yellow Springs also appear in the cosmological context of the opposing cycles of blossom- ing and decline of penal laws fflj and virtue Ш described in chapter 60 (sect. 3 , y. 44): "on the eleventh month, ' dade ' уМШ (that is, virtue as a cosmic principle) dwells under earth, 4 de ' Ш (individualized Virtue) is indoors, and the living beings, complying with virtue, enter below the Yellow Springs."190 But in non-A text, where this damp and dull place is specifically associated with the malevolent, the Yellow Springs be- come a penal institution for postmortem confinement, an afterlife jail for mortals convicted of offending conduct who have been sentenced to death. Chapter 106 (generally classified as A-material though of dubious dialogue form, as we have seen) opposes the mandate of life of the benevolent, which is subordinated to Heaven, to the mandate of life of the malevolent, which is subordinated to Earth,191 and adds that the malevolent will eventually "return (gui) to the Yellow Springs below."192 Chapter 185, in an analogous, binary formula, contrasts the 187 TPJHJ [ p. 579.

To begin with A-material (chapter 51 [sect. 3,/ 35]), not only is a disciple congratulated by the master for correctly answering that the way to distinguish between right and wrong is to check whether the effectiveness of an action allows the removal {jiechu ) of any contracted disease207 - another case of "response" or "retribution" - but, fur- thermore (chapter 212 [sect. 7,/ 119]), the questions of the disciples to the master are specifically aimed at substituting for the words of Saints ( shengren ÛÀ) created by Heaven who failed in their mission to have its maladies removed (jiechu) 20S In chapter 154 (sect. 6,/ 97), the catechism of the master will cancel out (jiechu) the lasting social disorder, wrath of Heaven, and distress of the Emperor caused by the perversion of those who oppose "the true Tao and mysterious Virtue ÂM'IBfê."209 As for the specific pneuma responsible for the ruler's dis- tress, it may be dispelled {jiechu ), according to chapter 206 (sect. 7,/ 116), and the state of Great Peace attained subsequently, by musical performance and singing in accordance with the cosmic principles.210 Chapter 127 (sect. 6,/ 86) states that one may even remove {chu) the maladies of Heaven by meditating on Heaven and, by meditating on a prince of Virtue, dispel ( chujie ) calamities and appease the princely person.211 Similar occurrences are to be found in Taiping jing chao.212 By way of contrast, in non-A-material, where jiechu never appears, the occurrences of chujie relate twice to the dispelling of "inherited bur- den" (chengfu)' once, to the removal of minor transgressions; and once, 205 On allotropy cases (AB/BA-pattern disyllabic compounds) in TPJ ' see Huangjianning "Taiping jing zhong de tongsu yixu ci" Sichuan shifan daxue xuebao 28.1 (2001), pp. 62-66. 206 Forke, Lun-Hêng 1, pp. 535, 537. 207 TPJHJ, p. 7i. 208 tpjhj, p. 675. 209 tpjhj, p. 434. 210 TPJHJ, p. 635. 211 TPJHJ, p. 314. 212 TPJC 4, p. gb: one of the numerous aims of the much-needed renewal of cosmic order is to dispel {jiechu ) the disasters provoked by the resentment of Heaven and Earth, have the distress of the Emperor terminated, people loving each other, and each one of the ten thou- sand beings back in its place [TPJHJ, p. 216; from a non-dialogue fragment); TPJC 8, p. 13a: 40</page><page sequence="41">SECONDARY STRATA OF TAIPING JING to the removal of human suffering.213 They attest to the possibility of permanent remission. Undoubtedly, the most effective way to forgiveness is "to reflect on (one's) transgressions Щзй" in order "to blame oneself §м" and "to feel remorse for (one's) transgressions" (ISàã, or ÉlfS, literally "self-re- morse"), an idea expressed throughout our material by various com- pounds combining these characters, sometimes into full sentences such as "to reflect on (one's) transgressions and to blame oneself or "to blame oneself and to feel remorse for (one's) transgressions Ě ЖШЙ!," or again "to blame oneself for the burden of (one's) transgres- sions ЁмЗЙА."214 Sparse occurrences of "to confess transgressions M ài," "to knock the ground with the forehead ФШ," and "to beat, or slap, oneself Êlíf" remind us of the practices of early Heavenly Mas- ter Taoism.215 As a useful support for completing successfully this moral introspection, one may use "reiterated admonitions" as well as "the texts in Heaven above."216 The theme of repentance is central, but not peculiar, to chapter 182, precisely entitled: "The life span of men of benevolence and humaneness who blame themselves (for their transgressions) is at the Bureau of Longevity."217 Thanks to repentance, Heaven has instructed the master to produce his text with the intention of "removing (jiechu) the maladies of Heaven and Earth, Yin and Yang, the Emperor, the people and the ten thou- sand beings," i.e. all cosmic and social dysfunction ( TPJHJ ' p. 694). 213 See chaps. 179 (TPJHJ, pp. 536; 551; 552) and 192 ( TPJHJ ' p. 591).

It is worth specifying for the attention of those who may feel interested that the beneficiary of the Heavenly Lord's indulgence is said to have been repenting "round the clock, for several years."222 Heaven undoubtedly likes mortals to confess their transgressions ( shouguo ; see, for instance, chapter 196). 223 But chapter 195 warns us that, should the statements made by the one's hun spir- its while interrogated underground differ from the facts recorded in Heaven, this persistently deceptive attitude would prevent the faults of the deceased from being remitted Ä, even if a full confession of trans- gressions ( shouguo ) eventually occurs.224 But, if a primary requisite for sincere, fruitful repentance is time, fear 7S certainly constitutes its psychological root.

MORALIZED COSMOLOGY AND IMPOSED DISEASE My earlier analysis of the epistemological content of the Taiping jing pointed out the central position occupied by writing in A-material, which stages a Heavenly Master urging the compilation of a compen- dium of orthodox knowledge while advertising the revelations bestowed upon him by Heaven.229 But, in non-A Taiping jing material, writing is not emphasized as the ideal vehicle of Truth - nor is there any master dealing with some compendium to be edited by a conclave of enlight- ened men, submitted to the Throne, then distributed to men all over the world. Now writing, as purely administrative documents unattain- able by mortals, rather embodies the restless recording, reporting, and archiving of human deeds by omniscient divine officials of the unseen world, unbeknown to men. From Taiping jing A- to non-A-material, in terms of Western philosophy, the reader witnesses a complete shift of focus from the sphere of epistemology to that of morals. Both views, of course, are far from being incompatible. For instance, they both per- tain to religious belief, and Taoist communities will needfully draw on 225 See chaps. 179 for tears ( TPJHJ p. 528) and fear ( TPJHJ ' p. 529), 180 for tears (TPJHJ, p. 546), 182 for tears and fear of death (TPJHJ, pp. 551; 556), and 198 for fear of the burden of transgressions not being removed but reported by gods ( TPJHJ ' p. 610). 226 TPJHJ, p. 591. 227 TPJHJ,?. 62I. 228 Chap. 66 from A-material (TPJHJ, p. 160).

Remarkably, despite centuries of Buddho-Taoist mutual influ- ences in the Chinese mainland, Taoist rituals in present-day Taiwan still perpetuate this early belief in a bureaucratic otherworld and in the contractual nature of the bonds that link mortals to it - subterranean judges dealing with the matters brought to their court; otherworldly treasurers cashing in the repayment of debts incurred by mortals; filling in, by the officiating priest and his assistants, of numerous administra- tive forms, some of which are to be delivered to the nether world by a mounted emissary whose journey is theatrically performed - rituals which follow procedures modeled on the protocol of the early imperial court.230 7 aiping jing chao documents this contractual nature of the re- lationship between men and gods: men of High Antiquity were bound to numerous gods by contracts and the Heavenly Lord himself, before issuing his written orders, has to consult his own contracts so as to clarify the documents submitted to him.231 Then, no wonder that a legalistic term like "to interrogate ЩЩ" or "to ask in examination,"232 occurs several times in Taiping jing - whether in this-worldly or other- worldly context: interrogation of the deceased by subterranean book- keepers; interrogation of bodily entities on their host's behavior; and heavenly interrogation of "perverse, or heterodox, gods invoked by so-called religious specialists who use them to get hold of the wealth of credulous sick people.233 In my former analysis of the triadic scheme which pervades most of Taiping jing (and Taiping jing chao ) A-stratum, I pointed out the ab- sence of moral value in the cosmologica! threefold pattern of Yang/ 230 See John Lagerwey, Taoist Ritual in Chinese Society and History (New York: Macmillan Publishing Co., 1987), pp. 49-237, and Patrice Fava's documentary video on funerary ritu- als; Patrice Fava, author, director and producer, "Les dieux de la Chine: Le livre des morts," 16-mm video film, CNRS AV (SERDDAV), 1977.

In this strongly moralistic worldview, good deeds and evil deeds now draw a clear line between innocence and guilt, and human post- mortem fate is ultimately decided by judges of the bureaucratic unseen world. But the benevolent who are awarded ascension to Heaven and allowed to mingle with its divine inhabitants are still subject to constant watch, like all the other gods. A passage of the résumé provided by Taiping jing chao where chapters 56-64 of Taiping jing are now missing alludes to their fearing faults being entered in surveillance records.235 In chapter 187 (sect. 7,/ 112), those guilty of negligence incur "a per- sonal punishment in the world of Man" (on Earth): to sell vegetables on the market of the capital, decked out in an ugly, despicable exterior, a degrading task lasting for forty, thirty, or ten years according to the gravity of the fault, before being reinstated as a divine emissary.236 Or elsewhere (chapter 198), for failing to report in time the existence of men of merit: to sell medicinal drugs and to heal disease for ten years in the capital Luoyang, but without being allowed to receive much money from the sick, and when the punishment is over, to return and stratum chap. 46 (sect. 3 , y . 36; TPJHJ ' p. 51).

Yet, in several instances, A material shows a clear preference for Yang, and not only by contrast with Yin: the threefold pattern itself, when interpreted as a temporal, "cosmogonical" process, turns radically into a descending logic of dispersal and decline in which only Yang/Heaven (phase 1) retains original, unaltered perfection, while Yin/Earth (phase 2) and Central Harmony/Man (phase 3) sink deeper and deeper into a general and irreparable corruption. This alternative triadic ideology paves the way for the idea of a necessary reversion to the origin, to the One, and for its latent totalitarian repercussions: one Truth, one single knowledge (orthodoxy), one single ruler (the Emperor). As long as Yin and Yang partake of a general cosmological worldview, however, they share the same legitimacy, albeit in a somewhat Manichaean way. 235 TPJHJ ' p. 212.

Now among Heaven and Earth, and Yin and Yang, everything has lost its place, and disease and harm are inflicted on the ten thousand beings.241 This portrayal of cosmic disorder and its specific pathological conse- quences does not take into account external or internal incidental patho- genic factors. An etiology deep-rooted in symbolism and universal in the fullest sense of the word, it does not, as such, take into account any localized distinctive characteristics, neither does it give any specific cure, but we may assume that only the restoration of cosmic harmony and equilibrium will guarantee total recovery. By contrast, sickness, as one of the facets of localized human suf- fering, loses its cosmological impact in the moralized worldview of non-A-material. While the master explained, in A-text chapter 136 (sect. 6, j. 92), how disease may be expelled by ingesting glyphs writ- ten with ink the color of cinnabar fl* ("doubled characters or Ш ШЙ!?"),242 sickness now remains incurable (as far as ordinary doctors and heterodox religious practitioneers invoking false gods of illness are concerned). Moreover, associated with lifetime abridgement, ill- ness is now to be regarded as the necessary penalty for men's misbe- havior, imposed by superhuman bureaucratic forces as a response to the ignorance of, or deliberate disregard for, the specific applications of cosmic principles mentioned above: breach of soil proscriptions, improper offerings to the ancestors, absence of filial piety, blatant ma- levolence. To complete this moral and legalist cause-and-effect scheme of conviction/illness and remission/healing, divine punishment may involve an active and desinterested contribution to the healing of other people in the world of man, as we have just seen - a world reportedly ravaged by repeated epidemics throughout the second century and till the end of the Han.243 240 I.e., punishments are imposed in the wrong time (see n. 148, above). 241 TPJC 2, p. i2a-b (TPJHJ, p. 23).

Significantly, in A-material, people who lack self-responsibility wrongly blame the Em- peror for their misfortune,248 rather than Heaven, or unseen entities such as ghosts, in non-A-material.

This individualization of human responsibility shows through in such passages as the following excerpt from chapter 179, in which the repetition of shen Л' (one's person, the individual) and zi Ě (oneself) emphasizes the importance of individual realization: (Inasmuch as your) life mandate depends closely on your person, why beat your breast and invoke Heaven?

Reflect on these words repeatedly, and do not resent ghosts (gui) and gods (shen).249 Thus we may interpret this moralization and individualization of guilt in non-A-material of the Taiping jing as closely following a general, wider phenomenon - the moralization of cosmology.250 If the penal emphasis of law is a well-established feature of Chinese culture and history,251 the penal emphasis of some Chinese religious ideologies, to my knowledge, has never been pointed out. It is no ac- cident that, in modern Chinese usage, the word zuiren UÀ designates both a criminal and a sinner, and fanzui ШШ designates sin as much as (legal) offense. In this regard, the Taiping jing offers perhaps one of the earliest explicit testimonies of the moral penalization of human behavior, outside of the Judeo-Christian world yet, in many ways, re- markably similar to its guilt complex or morbid taste for redemptive self-induced suffering through mortification. Further, the semiological definition by the authors of non-A-material of a series of human moral types - or rather, as modern legislators have put it, "psychological profiles" - which logically end up superseding the technical definition of guidelines for proper moral conduct and the objective application 249 TPJHJ, p. 5*7- 250 Also noticed, in other Han sources, by Aihe Wang, Cosmology and Political Culture in Early China (Cambridge: Cambridge U.P., 2000), pp. 129-72. 251 As noted in Bodde and Morris, Law in Imperial China , e.g., pp. 3-4, 28. 49</page><page sequence="50">GRÉGOIRE ESPESSET of relevant penalties to convicted offenders, strikingly matches Fou- caulťs formula of a " homo criminalist 252 Once again, morality and the state agree on the control and standardization of individuals and their mind, for, in such a logic of intentions, each individual in a disciplined society is a potential delinquent or criminal, and each soul belongs to a potential sinner.
