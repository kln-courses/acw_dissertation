Harley 2253 f. 71 v SUMMARY. - This article intends to show that miles, a hapax legomenon in 1. 20 of the Middle English lyric "Lenten ys come . . has up to now been interpreted wrongly, viz. as the plural of the Welsh noun mil 'animal'. Welsh words are, however, extremely rare in Middle English and were only adopted into the language where special terms are concerned. Moreover, there is no reason - metrical, semantic or artistic - why the poet should not have used the current word for 'animals' (bestes or de(o)res). Apart from this, the poem is not free from scribal errors. The most acceptable of the several conjectures for 1. 20 seems to be the following: "males murgep huere makes". Lines 19-22 of the lyric as traditionally punctuated hardly express any sense. A full stop at the end of 1. 20 would link 1. 19 to 1. 20 and 1. 21 to 1. 22, which renders the whole passage better understandable and more poetic. "Lenten y s come wip loue to toune . . 1 is justly considered by medievalists to be one of the finest and most complex lyrics in Middle English. Line 20 of this poem2 contains miles, a hapax legomenon , which has puzzled generations of editors as well as critics and which is now generally accepted3 to be derived from the Welsh noun mil4 meaning 'animal'. This assumption must, however, be rejected on various grounds. Discussing a single word in a poem involves, at the same time, contextual problems. So line 20, as printed in G. L. Brook's edition, together with the accompanying verses runs as follows: Wowes pis wilde drakes; miles murgep huere makes, ase strem pat strikep stille. Mody menep, so dop mo; (19-22) (Wild drakes make love; Animals (?) cheer their mates, like a stream that flows slowly. The brave man laments, so do others;) All editors agree on the crucial points as far as the punctuation of this passage is concerned. There is, however, no unanimity as to whether the first words of the four ver- ses begin with capital or small letters, a question which in line 19 (Wowes) and 21 (ase) can- not be decided with sufficient certainty5, whereas lines 20 and 22 differ from the two other 1 C.

Harley 2253 355 verses solely in that the scribe here prefers a specially shaped m -, which is, of course, no convincing proof for a capital letter. As a clear tendency towards capitalization at the be- ginning of the lines is not recognizable on f. 71v of MS. Harley 2253, 1 propose small initial letters for the first words throughout the whole poem. One cannot draw any conclusions from the initial letters of the lines as to possible syntactical divisions in our text. Most edi- tors were obviously misled in this regard. If one takes for granted that miles 'animals' was originally intended by the anonymous author to stand in this context, and assumes that the punctuation suggested is correct, line 21 of the passage cited above would only make sense if interpreted as an isolated utterance. For it would be extremely difficult to show any real connection between the image of ani- mals mating and making merry (19, 20) and that of a stream slowly flowing (21), all the more since line 21 is meant as a metaphorical comparison with line 20. The two verses scarcely display any intrinsic relations to each other, unless criteria valid for modern poetry are applied in judging the passage, a method which, of course, would be wholly inappropriate to the assessment of medieval poems. Let us now examine miles more closely. Welsh loan words are very rarely encountered in Middle English literature6, and if so, they are by no means confined to texts written in the dialect of the West, in which our poem is presumably composed7. Those few words re- present, moreover, special terms8, so that their adoption into Middle English seems entire- ly understandable. This is equally true for the two other Welsh words which occur in the Harley Lyrics9. In view of these facts, mil would be a highly unusual exception. Following the text as quoted above, it is hard to see why the poet should not have chosen one of the current Middle English expressions for 'animals', such as bestes or de(o)res. The latter is actually to be found in line 29 of our poem, and the unknown author would ap- parently not have felt this as an awkward repetition, since recurrence of sound and thought makes for the special charm of this Harley Lyric in particular. The use of either one of the words indicated would not even disturb the alliterative pattern of line 20, because about two thirds of the verses in the whole poem have only twofold alliteration, a device to which murgep and makes (20) do conform. Furthermore, 4 'Lenten ys come ..." is not a poem whose main concern it is to play upon foreign words or to offer the reader a jumble of linguistic curiosities, as is sometimes evi- 6 A thorough study of the influence of Welsh culture on Middle English language and literature is still an urgent desideratum. 7 Cf.

Thus miles hardly fulfils any essential function within the poem. On the whole, much speaks in favour of the argument that miles is a corruption. Scribal errors are not uncommon in our poem, a fact which is witnessed by lines 1 1 (wynne) and 22 (dop). It is also true that the various lyrics of the manuscript are not original texts, but are likely to have been copied several times, often by incompetent scribes. What the poet real- ly meant by miles we will probably never know. Venturing a textual conjecture we have, on the face of it, several possibilities. But one can scarcely interpret miles as Middle English mules or myles (from Old French mule 'mule'). The reason for it is that the written letter / never stands for /y:/ in MS. Harley 2253 10, a statement which is borne out by the well-known dialect-feature that Old English lyl or /y :/ is preserved in the West Midlands and the South- West far into the fourteenth century as y or u 1 ' Neither would the plural of the noun mele (from Old English mœle 'cup, bowl')12 instead of miles provide a satisfactory solution: meles murgep huere makes "cups gladden their partners" (i. e. those who drink from them). This sounds very much like a verse taken from a Skaldic poem with makes as a bold heiti for 'drinkers', but would be far too affected and artificial in our context. The suggestion which J.R.R. Tolkien put forward tentatively about fifty years ago13 is not convincing, either, though his conjecture is at least linguistically correct. But he has to go to great lengths in order to put things to rights. He offers miles as meles , the 3rd person plural present tense of melen 'to speak' 14, and has therefore to change murgep into murge , since the former can, in these circumstances, no longer be understood as a verb, but must be regarded as an adverb, i.e. murge 'merrily'15. Nevertheless, murgen , mirien transitively used (= 'to gladden, to cheer someone') is recorded in Middle English literature16. Conse- 10 Cf. K.

Bosworth-Toller, pp. 658 and 627, Hall-Meritt, p. 225. 15 melen and murge are often combined in texts of the West Midlands to form an ordinary phrase. See e.g. 1. 37 of the Harley Lyric "Mosti ryden by Rybbesdale. . ." (Brook, ed., op. cit., p. 38). 16 According to OED (vol. VI, M, p. 363, s.v. merry) and to the editors of MED, whom I wish to thank for their kind information, murien, mirien occurring in this usage is to be met with in another two cases: Maximion, 1 . 206 (Bö- dekker, op. cit., p. 251), i.e. in the same manuscript, and The Pride of Life, 1. 296 (Non-Cycle Plays and Fragments, ed. N. Davis, EETS,SS, 1, 1970, p. 97). The transitive construction is also possible with the cognate Middle English verb mir(h)pen 'to gladden, to give mirth' (e.g. in Pearl, ed. E.V. Gordon, Oxford, 1953, 1. 862), derived from the Old English noun myrhp. Old English ãmyrgan 'to delight, to cheer someone' (Bosworth-Toller, p. 37, Hall-Me- ritt, p. 19) is recorded in Middle English as amirien in one case only (cf. MED).</page><page sequence="4">4 Miles' : a Crux in MS. Harley 2253 357 quently, Tolkien believes that -p17 of murgep is a corrupt remnant of wip, obviously be- cause melen takes this preposition when followed by an indirect object18. He therefore ad- vocates these lines: wowes pis wilde drakes, miles murge [wij) huere makes (19-20) (wild drakes make love, and speak merrily with their mates) To all intents and purposes, this entails too much innovation in a single verse - which makes Tolkien's emendation highly questionable. The most plausible solution, to my mind, is to replace miles by males, the plural of the Middle English noun male 'male'19, a word which is well documented in Middle English literature20 and which makes excellent sense in our context. As a matter of fact, males in- stead of miles necessitates only a very slight alteration of verse 20. The first two lines of the revised form of our passage would then be: wowes pis wilde drakes, nuiles murgep huere makes. (19-20) (wild drakes make love, males cheer their mates.) Needless to say, the number of syllables in line 20 remains the same and the latter still ac- cords fully with the metrical structure of the other verses. Besides, the two lines are well matched, in that line 20 represents a graphic generalization of line 19, both verses together depicting a light-heartedly anthropomorphic situation. In this new version I would like to insist on putting a full stop after makes (20). For it is only now that the reader is able to comprehend line 21 in its real context: ase strem pat strikep stille, mody menep, so dop mo. (21-22) (like the stream that flows slowly the brave man quietly laments; so do others.) Here verse 21 is seen illustrating verse 22, not 20; the latter would make little sense. Thus the two lines are brought into close connection with each other. The tertium comparationis common to the concepts expressed in 21 and 22 is the lack of vigour and joy described by the poet in these verses. The image of the river flowing slowly and that of the man complaining sadly about his fate form a consistent and integrated whole. In addition, both 17 The verbal ending - (e) p refers, in this poem, to either the singular or the plural of the 3rd person present tense indicative. 18 The examples from The 4 Gest Hystoriale' of the Destruction of Troy (eds. A. Pantin and D. Donaldson, EETS, OS, 39 &amp; 56, 1869 &amp; 1874), 1. 515, 2021, 9252 provide pertinent illustration of this. 19 Derived from the Old French noun mas(c)le (cf. A.J. Greimas, Dictionnaire de l'ancien français jusqu'au mi- lieu du XIVe siècle , Paris, 1972, p. 398). 20 Conspicuous examples are cited in OED, vol. VI, M, p. 79, s.v. male and in MED. If one accepts that MS. Har- ley 2253 was written about 1340 (cf. Ker, op. cit., pp. XXI ff.), then this instance of males is one of the earliest.</page><page sequence="5">358 HEINZ BERGNER lines contrast happily with the preceding verses, which exhibit all the splendour and energy of nature. Over and above this, they make the two subsequent lines ichot ycham on of ļx), for loue pat likes ille. (23-24) (I know I am one of those who are miserable with love.) appear an effective as well as impressive conclusion to the stanza. Lines 19-24 of "Lenten ys come wif&gt; loue to toune. . should therefore run: wowes pis wilde drakes, males murgep huere makes, ase strem pat strikep stille, mody menep, so dop mo. In its old form this passage was linguistically doubtful and poetically unconvincing. The new version has the advantage of being free from inaccuracies in the language, of dis- playing no structural discrepancies, and of fitting in well with the rhythm of the poem as a whole.
