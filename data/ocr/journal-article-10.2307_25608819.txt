<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Buddha's house KAZIK. ASHRAF The Buddha's house is an enigma. Even though there is no clear, single image of the house, and Buddhist traditions do not describe it with any precision or unanimity, the shadow of the house exerts a tremendous influence on pragmatic, didactic, and symbolic deliberations of the various tenets of Buddhism. If the Buddha's house acquires a larger-than-life status, it is not because of the house itself but because of the stature of the dweller of the house, the Buddha. The purpose of this essay is to draw the outline of that house.1 Why should one be interested in the Buddha's house other than the reason that the house belonged to a world-moving teacher? If Buddhism and its various practices are ascetical in nature, dwelling is a key locus in that tradition.2 If an architectural exegesis is sought in that ascetical culture, it must begin with the house of the Buddha. The Buddha's house appears in manifold ways within the Buddhist traditions, depending on the various schools that emerged since the First Council held immediately after the passing away of the Buddha, and the various accounts and concepts of the Buddha that developed soon after.3 The conversations in the traditions are not so much about the literal architecture of the house as much as employing the architectural structure for a deliberation on asceticism, on describing, explaining, and encoding the dimensions of renunciation. This is the principal reason for an elementary structure like the Buddha's house to emerge with a kind of paradigmatic value. Joseph Rykwert, in establishing the significance of "Adam's house," writes how the image of a clearly imaginary house becomes the locus of a compelling religious, sociological, and philosophical imagination.4 The aim of the production of such a paradigm is the reform of society that is envisioned in a kind of "purer" architecture, which society somehow would follow as a model.5 It seems many cultures assign reified properties to a certain architectural image that will propel the lives of people, forming expectations broader than prosaic architecture. The Buddha's house becomes a significant site for reflecting on the scope and limits of renunciation, on its existential, ritual, and aporetic dimensions. After all, the Buddha?Gautama Sakyamuni?was an arch ascetic whose life practice and teaching were about the critical relinquishment of "home," and the various reformations thereafter. Within Buddhist traditions, the house appears diversely, from practical considerations to didactic, metaphorical and symbolic treatments. There are descriptions, in both literary forms and visual representations, of the house where the Buddha 1. I am in pursuit of a house that does not exist per se. No single literary, archaeological, anthropological, or epigraphic account?the tools of reconstruction?can fully build this house. By the "Buddha's house," I am referring to the wide range of architectural references made in the context of Buddha's habitation, from purely pragmatic ones to those that play more than domiciliary roles in the Buddhist cosmos. The sources of this architectural image are literary descriptions and commentaries, pictorial and three-dimensional representations, and ritual texts. The house starts to appear through a hermeneutical treatment of the materials, and for me that also includes the so-called secondary literature, that is, comments and essays written in our times, for I consider that many of the essays significantly hinted at the plan of the house, so to speak, but none attempted to erect it in toto. I am aware of the discrepancies in the account of Buddhist past where often literary accounts do not match with archaeological or epigraphic ones, as Gregory Schopen demonstrates in his essays in Bones, Stones and Buddhist Monks (Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press, 1997), on the one hand, and where sometimes epigraphic accounts are held to be unreliable, as commented on by Maurizio Taddei, "Recent Archaeological Research in Gandhara: The New Evidence," in Candharan Buddhism, ed. Pia Branacaccio and Kurt Behrendt (Vancouver: University of British Columbia Press, 2006), on the other. I cannot quite participate in that debate as I am not writing with Buddhistic scholarship but as a historian of (architectural) ideas adopting, I am admitting, certain latitude. 2. While it might appear that the Buddha might have distanced himself from asceticism at the moment of his awakening by adopting the so-called "middle-path," he was actually rejecting the extreme forms of practices prevalent among various ascetic creeds at that time. The Buddhist monastic tradition can still be described as a combination of renunciatory and ascetic practices. 3. The term "Buddha" has acquired multiple meanings in conjunction with the emergence of various sects, schools, and traditions; the principal traditions that have continued are the Theravada and Mahayana. While the notion of the Buddha is not limited to the historical figure of Gautama Sakyamuni as it took on a universal aspect in most conceptualizations, the proliferation of the idea is still predicated upon the known life story of Gautama. In elaborating the idea of the Buddha from a historically specific Buddha (Gautama) to nonspecific Buddhas, texts in all schools adopt various methods whereby legends and fables surround even the historical figure. 4.

The house also appears in various fabulous narratives, as we shall see, where it acquires an extraordinary dimension in itself, from being a repository of something miraculous to signifying the invisible. However, in Buddhist ascetical thinking, the final encounter of renunciation takes place within the frame of the human body, which is visualized, in many Buddhist narratives, as a dwelling, thus bringing an intimacy to two aspects of existence: building and body. The house is homologized with the ascetic's body so that a metaphysical or mystical understanding of the suprahuman figure is embodied in the architecture. All these ideas emerged from the facts around the life of the historical Buddha and the regard accorded to him then and after as the "perfected ascetic," or as he was described, the mahasamana (arch-ascetic), or mahapuru$a (superman).6 The architecture of the house Jetavana is a special place in the life of the historical Buddha, Gautama Siddharta (543-483 B.C.). The place was a garden retreat outside the city of SravastT (still an extant city in present-day Uttar Pradesh in northern India). In around the sixth century B.C., when the Buddha was roaming the Gangetic plain, going from one city to another with his ardent project of transforming oneself, he would station himself in a secluded area inside or just outside the city. The area could be a garden (arama) as part of the estate of a wealthy person, an established retreat, or part of a forested site. During his visits to SravastT, he stayed at Jetavana for a total of over twenty five years. The site of Jetavana fares very significantly in Buddhist art and hagiography, where it is depicted with Figure 1. Depiction of the gandhakutis in Jetavana, bas-relief on a balustrade in the Bharhut stupa (third century B.C.). After A. Foucher, L'art Greco-bouddhique du Gandhara (Paris: Leroux, 1905), fig. 240. what are known to be dwellings especially constructed for the Buddha (fig. 1).7 We can assume that prior to the dwellings in the Jetavana, the Buddha had experienced various architectural spaces. When the Buddha was about twenty nine years old and known as Siddharta, a prince in the northern kingdom of Kapilavastu (in modern Nepal), he abandoned his palatial home and left in the dead of the night for his now celebrated quest and its culmination under a tree in Gaya (present-day Bodhgaya in Bihar). The story has been told and retold, and primarily focuses on the Buddha's teachings and exemplary life combining self abnegation, ascetical discipline and contemplation, and finally a self-transformative illumination about the course of life (a phenomenon that came to be characterized as "enlightenment"). But what remains rather elusive is how the Buddha lived and carried on his day-to-day routines, first, in 7. One reason for Jetavana's prominence in visual and literary narratives is the well-known story of its building by the merchant Anathapindika, especially the laying of gold pieces on the ground as the price of the place. The narrative is found in many Buddhist texts, including the Vinayas. 6. In the history and tradition of ascetic practice, the full development of the idealized ascetic figure occurs around the sixth fifth century b.c. within the particular socioeconomic context and theological-religious background, where the Buddha represents one "perfected ascetic," preceded by an extensive tradition of wanderers, renouncers, and ascetics. In defining the "perfected ascetic," the hermit or the ascetic of that momentous period is considered the most idealized human figure in Indian imagination. In the view of Louis Dumont, that figure is the true individual, the person standing outside or against the world; see Louis Dumont, "World Renunciation in Indian Religions," in Contributions to Indian Sociology 4 (1960). To Mircea Eliade, he is the one who is considered to define and challenge the limits of civilization and consequently reveal the domain beyond the ordinary and the mundane. He is also the one who articulates an individuated path for the transformation of the self, which is nothing less than gaining "immortality" and "freedom." See Mircea Eliade, Yoga: Freedom and Immortality (Princeton: Bollingen Press, 1958), pp. xx, 118.</page><page sequence="3">Ashraf: The Buddha's house 227 Figure 2.

It would be important to know how the great teacher and practitioner of renunciation dealt with the mundane but necessary aspects of dwelling after the moment of enlightenment. The Buddha, in an ideological move, may have repudiated the normative house as the prime symbol of domestic and social ensnarement (samsara), but he did require and acquire some sort of dwelling even in his life as a great teacher. We know only spottily about the actual residence of the Buddha (the Jetavana structures being a case), of the various huts or pavilion like structures he might have used in the gardens of cities that he visited in his itinerant life. Images start appearing in Buddhist literature and iconography from around the third and second centuries b.c, a few centuries after the Buddha's own time. The earliest dwelling of Siddharta, in his life of wandering in the forest in the pre-enlightenment phase, may be regarded as an elemental shelter. Buddhist texts written a few centuries after his death describe such an elemental condition variously as being under a tree, sitting on a cushion of grass, or being in a cave.8 8. The description is ascribed to the Buddha in the "Maha Assapura Sutta" (39.12), in the Rali Theravada text The Majjhima Nikaya. Such primitive conditions were part and parcel of the renunciatory lifestyles of various hermits and ascetics in India that go back to Vedic times (fig. 2).9The ascetical movements of Buddhism and Jainism in the sixth century B.C. considered those conditions in a more formalized and organized manner that also came to constitute or define the ideology of renunciation. In any case, the tree fares prominently in the early Buddhist universe. Next to the cave, the tree is the archetypal site of ascetic practice despite their marked phenomenological differences. It was actually the tree at Gaya that became the critical site and "structure" associated both in actuality and metaphorically (and soon metaphysically) with the climactic moment of nirvana or "awakening."10 It is not surprising that the tree became the prevalent sanctioned "dwelling" in Buddhist monastic literature, and soon a multivalent motif in the representation, explanation, and elaboration 9. See comments on various kinds of arboreal structures such as kutl (plain hut of the peasant or forest recluse), pannasala (leaf hut), nalagara (reed hut), in Ananda K. Coomaraswamy, "Early Indian Architecture" (1930-1931), in Essays in Early Indian Architecture, reprinted and edited with an introduction by Michael W. Meister (New Delhi: Oxford University Press, 1992), pp. 105-108. 10. While it is beyond the scope of this essay to even briefly discuss the psychological, philosophical, or religious issues of nirvana, I am simply describing it as a climactic moment, the telos in the ascetic-meditative practice of Buddhism.</page><page sequence="4">228 RES 53/54 SPRING/AUTUMN 2008 of the Buddha's "abode." Although the reified tree is a widespread and ancient phenomenon, it became an emblem par excellence within Buddhist symbolism and its ascetic practices. The tree is simultaneously the site of enlightenment, and an emblem of Buddhist metaphysics (such as the "Cosmic Tree" and the "Tree of Wisdom").11 It is both an abode and a temple: The tree is both a symbol of the actual site of Buddha's enlightenment, and therefore an actual spatial location, and of the more abstract notion of yogic enlightenment. This is best exemplified architecturally by the creation of the hypaethral temples, the bodhigharas.u The bodhighara, coming a little later after the Buddha but certainly imbued with pre-Buddhist significance, is basically a sacred tree associated with the Buddha around which is constructed an elaborate structure for carrying out rituals.13 The tree, as the Indologist Heinrich Zimmer remarks, is very much like a hut.14 The tree and the cave are not only naturalistic conditions of dwelling, as distinct from a constructed artifact, but are also archaic sources of a vast metaphysical and mythological imagination. In the ascetic realm, there is reciprocal significance among the tree, the cave, and the hut when approaching the architecture of the ascetic. Some of that significance comes from an earlier source such as the yaksa imagery, which has substantially influenced the build-up of the image of the hermit under a tree. The yaksa is an archaic tree or water spirit, the veneration of which was present as a devotional cult in almost all villages, a practice that predates Buddhism in India but was apparently co-opted into the Buddhist worldview.15 In any case, the abode of the yaksa is an important feature: It is a tree, most often located in a forest. The yaksa and the tree are, however, virtually interchangeable;16 specific trees are abodes of the yaksa beings that often develop into a locus of venerable activities, creating a ritual ensemble of tree, altar, seat, and enclosure17 that would come to be known as a cetiya or caitya. It is this ensemble that informs the site of the Buddha's enlightenment to such an extent that the village girl Sujata mistakes the contemplative Siddharta for a yaksa.19 There is a conflation here between the property of a dwelling (bhavanam, as the yak$a abode was known) and an honorific locus (caitya). In both Buddhist and Jaina narratives, the yaksa caityas are used as resorts, or halting places (temporary abodes), for itinerant monks.20 Stories abound about the Buddha taking brief residence under a yaksa tree and resting on its altar slab or seat.21 All this means is that living under a tree came to be reified in a special way in Buddhist ascetic thought.22 The Vinayas22, a compendium of rules put together for the monks, and supposedly passed down from the Buddha, announces: "In the matter of housing, the sramana's life is based on dwelling at the foot of a tree. Thus you must endeavor to live all your life. Cells, houses, mansions, and huts are extras."24 The Buddha, on occasion, encouraged living under trees and in caves, giving at the same time its efficacy for ascetic purpose.25 At around 400 ce, the prolific commentator Buddhaghosa writes 11. Eliade notes, like others before him: "The Cosmic Tree is at the center of the world; it unites the three cosmic regions, for it sends its roots down into the underworld, and its top touches the sky."

Of the thirteen practices, one is the "tree-root dweller's practice." This conforms to the Vinaya suggestion of "depending on the root of a tree as an abode," where the ascetic begins his renunciatory practice by declaring: "I refuse a roof." The root of a tree is clearly a dwelling recommended by the Buddha because it is "valueless, easy to get, and blameless."28 Buddhaghosa lists the following benefits for living at the root of a tree: (1) the perception of impermanence is aroused through seeing the continual alteration of young leaves; (2) avarice of abodes and love of (building) work are absent; (3) one dwells in the company of deities; and (4) lives in conformity with (the principles of) fewness of wishes.29 There is also the post-enlightenment wandering of the Buddha when he would travel, always with a retinue of followers, from city to city, teaching and discoursing. On such journeys, he would generally reside in a forested site near a city, or a large garden such as at Jetavana. Sometimes the garden, often belonging to a wealthy patron sympathetic to the Buddha's teachings, would be dedicated for the sole use of the Buddha, whence the site transformed from a pleasure-garden to a retreat (arama) for hallowed, meditative purposes.30 The large site would also be a residence for the group of people accompanying the Buddha, including fellow elders and fresh initiates. These were not yet the regularized monastic establishments that happened soon afterward and remain the evidence of Buddhist architecture today. The huts at Jetavana are the most significant constructions made for the Buddha. The huts depicted in both the reliefs in Bharhut and SancT (both from around the third century B.C.) are shown as refined construction of thatch and possibly wattle and daub walls. The relief from Bharhut shows two huts, one a square or circular hut, and another an oblong, vaulted structure (fig. 1). An elaborate caitya doorway with wooden end-beams forms the entry for both. The caitya frames several arched motifs with decorative patterns, and the latter could be some kind of lattice-work to let air and light in. The roof, adorned with pinnacles, is well-formed with an elegant curved shape in a section that follows the contour of the caitya arch. Such an architectural profile is recalled in full scale as either a gateway or compressed building volume at the front of the Lomas Rsi cave that was carved out by the AjTvika ascetics not too far from Gaya, at about 260 b.c. (fig. 3). It is not clear yet whether the hut dedicated for the Buddha in the Jetavana relief is an actual representation of a structure the Buddha lived in, a simple adaptation from common dwellings of that time, or, more likely, a stylized convention for important buildings (the Bharhut and Sand reliefs were produced about two hundred years after the time of the Buddha). Early representations of residential architecture of that time, as in the art of Gandhara and sites like Bharhhut, do show some with resemblances to the huts at Jetavana. What is significant is that the profile of the Jetavana huts depicted in the Bharhut and SancT reliefs takes on a codified character making it possibly a mark of the Buddha. Among the few examples that may be cited, the most striking one is the image of a hut within a 6o&lt;jf/7/g/7ara-ensemble from a medallion from Mathura (fig. 4).31 Another is a statue from a site in Gandhara of what is known as a female donor with a votive object that seems to be a cross-section of a "triple-arched building" bearing close resemblance to the profile of Jetavana hut.32 A fragment of a statue from Gandhara shows compressed scenes of Buddha at the fire-temple in Uruvilva. A structure on the right, possibly the fire-temple, depicts the Buddha inside, and the same structure on the left with the "tri-lobed arch" opening shows an empty space (fig. 5).33 In the period of Buddhist art, from perhaps the time of the Buddha to the second century b.ce, the Buddha was not represented directly, and was conveyed in the so-called aniconic manner through visual marks of which the more established ones included footprints, the wheel of teaching, the bodhi-tree, or the stupa. In the repertoire of signs or marks of the aniconic Buddha, I would provisionally like to include the hut-motif, 26. Visudhhimagga is a comprehensive manual written by the fifth-century Theravadin commentator and scholar Buddhaghosa. Buddhaghosa, Visuddhimagga: The Path of Purification, trans. Bhikkhu Nyanamoli (Colombo: A. Semage, 1964). 27. The "dhutanga" practice is distinct from the general cenobitic practice of the monks. The dhutanga covers a stricter and individualized ascetic mode, something that may be practiced by individuals in remote places, in distinction to the collective and public practice in the monastery.

The hut-motif is certainly not as widespread as the established repertoire, yet there are many examples that have been overlooked by scholars studying aniconic representations.34 In the case of the structures at Jetavana, the identifying "mark" of a hut as the Buddha's dwelling is not only visual but also olfactory. The structures there were called gandhakuti, meaning fragrant or perfumed hut, and that term gandhakuti came to refer to the abode of the Buddha in other ways. It is through the gandhakuti that the space of the Buddha's habitation has been reified in early Buddhist circles. Gandhakuti, the house of fragrance The gandhakuti was always considered a very special "place of the Buddha," a structure prepared for him either during or after his life. While the building of the gandhakuti at Jetavana seems to be most known, it was not unique to that site alone. It was part of the importance accorded to the accommodation of the Buddha whenever he arrived at some city with his retinue.35 Figure 4. A bodhighara is depicted with a tiered structure usually representing a harmika, with an additional caitya arched hut at the lower level, from a balustrade from Mathura (Sunga period). After J. Ph. Vogel, La Sculpture de Mathura (Paris: Ars Asiatica and G. Van Oest, 1930), plate XIV. Fragrant architecture was particularly highlighted in early Buddhist tradition. In Jetavana itself, there were structures other than the gandhakuti that were also described as being fragrant buildings: kosambakuti, also meaning a fragrant hut, was one of them,36 and candanamala, the sandalwood pavilion, was one of the several dwellings that were created for the Buddha in 34. Dietrich Seckel discusses the broad range of marks of the aniconic Buddha, where only a "cupola pavilion" (from Nagarjunikonda) is mentioned. See Seckel (note 22), pp. 35-36. 35. The gandhakuti is mentioned in numerous Jatakas and other Buddhist texts such as Pali commentary literature and Sanskrit avadanas. T. W. Rhys Davids and other scholars of the Pali school think that the gandhakuti was a specific building in a particular monastery, referring especially to the one at Jetavana, while Eugene Burnouf, Monier Monier-Williams, and H. C. Norman hold the opinion that the gandhakuti was not specific to a single monastery but referred to a house for the Buddha wherever he went. See discussion by H. C. Norman, "Gandhakuti?The Buddha's Private Abode," in Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal (vol. IV, 1908), pp. 1-5; John G. Strong, "Gandhakuti: The Perfumed Chamber of the Buddha," in History of Religions (vol. 16, 1977), pp. 390-406; and Gregory Schopen, "Buddha as an Owner of Property and Resident in Medieval Indian Monasteries," in his Bones, Stones (see note 1), pp. 258-289. Schopen, citing epigraphic evidence, observes that the gandhakuti referred to both the specific structure at SravastT and also various other monastic sites where a particular space was designated as a gandhakuti (pp. 268-269). Some texts mention the building of gandhakuti for Buddhas other than Gautama; such, for example, as Buddhaghosa's commentary on the Dhammapada and the Anguttara Nikaya. 36. B. Barua and K. S. Sinha, Barhut Inscriptions (Calcutta: University of Calcutta 1926), p. 60. The term is found in inscriptions in Barhut, and the authors think that the term refers to a "perfumed cottage" and not to the place name Kausambi. The term is a Pali counterpart to the Skt. kausumbha, meaning sweet-scented, or literally bearing the perfume of the kusumbha flower.</page><page sequence="7">Ashraf: The Buddha's house 231 Figure 5. The Buddha at the fire-temple at Uruvilva in a scene where the temple is shown twice, once with the Buddha inside and again without him, from Takht-i-Bahai, Gandhara.

The gandhakuti was then not only the private dwelling place of the Buddha, but also "the repository of floral offerings which gave its sweet perfume and its Pali name."39 The fifth-century ce text Dhammapada Atthakatha, in one instance, describes the gandhakuti as having pillars, three great windows, gem-set roofing tiles, a golden bowl on the roof, and pinnacles of coral.40 Coomaraswamy thinks that the golden bowl is located inside the roof and is some kind of device for sprinkling perfume on the Buddha seated within, and it is this that gave the name gandhakuti.41 The Dhammapada, an important text of the Buddha's sayings compiled after his death, mentions the nature of flower and fragrance, and the sage being like a bee. The tropical climatic setting is certainly a factor here. The role of smell as signifier came about because of the greater abundance of plants with fragrant flowers and the house's more porous relationship to the outside.42 When the hut becomes a site for devotional offerings by laypeople, the gandhakuti assumes more the status of what John Strong calls a "cultic abode" than a pragmatic house of the ascetic. A cultic characterization implies that the house was oriented more for the devotional activity of the broader community of monks and laypeople, where the association of flowers with the hut came to be an honorific trope for the Buddha.43 Flowers were often treated in a much more architectural way in connection to spaces for the Buddha. In this sense, two types of gandhakutis are identifiable (fig. 6). The main type is the constructed hut that was very likely functionally lived in by the Buddha.44 The second type is a flowery pavilion that is not a space of inhabitation but a "new space" that either shelters the Buddha ceremonially or invokes his presence during his absence. It is highly likely that these flowery pavilions were erected as temporary structures wherever the Buddha went for visits and were used to frame the platform from where he spoke and taught, and also, most likely, meditated (fig. 7). In any case, both types?the functional hut and the flowery pavilion?shared the fragrant aspect of the Buddha's presence and both came to be reified as such. The flowers in the fragrant hut were given as simple offerings but were also used to create a bower or pavilion of flowers around the Buddha, delineating 37.

There were also other fragrant huts with different names, and possibly with different characterizations. There was another hut at Jetavana for the residence of the Buddha that was called kosambakuti, also meaning a perfumed hut. See Norman (note 35). 40. Coomaraswamy (see note 9), p. 110. 41. Ibid. 42.

Its image is depicted in a number of sculptures that show the Buddha under a form of arboreal, floral, or garland-decked canopy.45 This is also corroborated in certain texts. There is a striking image in the Dhammapada Atthakatha in which a gardener, after meeting the Buddha, offers him flowers (fig. 8).46The gardener first threw a handful of flowers over the Buddha that remained suspended over his head like a canopy. The next handful that was thrown created a curtain on the Buddha's right side, eventually Figure 7. The Buddha at his first sermon under a tree canopy, from Loriyan-Tangai, Gandhara. After A. Foucher, L'art Greco bouddhique du Gandhara (Paris: Leroux, 1905), fig. 220. creating a curtain wall all around him. The flowery pavilion accompanies the Buddha as a sort of mobile gandhakuti wherever he moves until he reaches the actual fragrant hut, and once he goes inside the hut, the flowers suddenly fall off all around him.47 Even if this be a fabulous story, it describes the creation of an architectural space through floral means. John S. Strong calls it "creating a new space" around the Buddha,48 a space that also may be seen as coterminous with the body of the arch-ascetic. It is because of this correspondence between the body and the space delineated around it that the reverential followers could visualize a scenario of a mobile floral canopy as the Buddha moved around. Once that correspondence?between body and pavilion?emerges, it is natural to come up with moments when a flowery space is created to represent or commemorate a missing Buddha, who may either be in a distant place when alive, or after his passing may no longer be bodily available. The effect in either case is to "make a space in which the absent Buddha can be present here and now."49 45. A number of Gandhara sculptures show the Buddha under such a canopy, where the fragrant moment is further amplified by the presence of spiritual or human figures offering to or strewing flowers at the Buddha. There is one image in which a standing Buddha is seen under a suspended floral canopy with monks and worshippers around him, while a devotee on his left is seen tossing flowers at him. The image is part of a larger composition in relief, divided from the upper half by what appears to be some kind of arboreal or vegetal gateway or pavilion. See plate 188 in Ingholt (note 32). 46.

Strong notes that the theme of a floral pavilion and thus the motif of a "new space" occurs repeatedly throughout avadana literature.

I have already mentioned how fragrance becomes a cue for invoking absent bodies such that a powerful meaning is assigned to smell rather than to visual signals. There is an interesting passage in an Avadana text50 where the protagonist Purna suggests to a group of merchants that they build a sweet-smelling pavilion to invoke the Buddha, when apparently the Buddha is far away and the merchants have never seen him. As Purna recommends: "[U]se this [sandalwood] to build a circular pavilion (mandalamala) for the Teacher and then you shall see him/'51 Purna actually donates to the building of an elaborate structure made out of sandalwood called the candanamala (the sandalwood pavilion) with the intention of inviting the Buddha there. After the pavilion was completed, the avadana narrates: Purna climbed onto the roof of [the pavilion], that place of refuge, and stood facing the Jeta[vana] grove [where the Buddha was staying at that time in SravastT]. He knelt down, strewed flowers, waved incense. . . . Then, through the spiritual power of the Buddhas and the divine power of the gods, the flowers fashioned themselves into an airborne pavilion and were transported to the Jeta Grove. . . .52 In elaborating the idea of "new" space, John S. Strong gives examples of floral offerings, such as those of later and present times in front of the statue of the Buddha in Buddhist image halls, and of the established practice of "sweeping the gandhakuti'/' What this effects ritual ly is the construction in the image hall itself of a floral perfumed chamber in which the presence of the Buddha can be realized here and now, even though he is in Nirvana. The Buddha, of course, is to a certain extent "present" already in his image. Presumably the gift of the devotee and the spirit in which it is arranged create a new psycho-physical environment which brings that presence out even more.53 Such symbolic gandhakutis of later times in the form of floral offerings and flowery structures created 50. Tatelman (see note 37), p. 183. For note on avadana, see ff. 48. 51. Ibid. 52. Ibid., pp. 67-68. 53. It seems that the practice of "sweeping the gandhakuti/' as if preparing a space for the arrival of the Buddha, was initiated by Anathapindika just after the death of the Buddha, which becomes one more aspect of the identity of the Buddha and his space. See Strong (note 35).</page><page sequence="10">234 RES 53/54 SPRING/AUTUMN 2008 a "new" space in order to invoke an absent figure. One could describe these symbolic gandhakuti as mimetic, surrogate, or associative spaces?that is, they evoke in one form or another the original, living space of the Buddha's dwelling. So from a place prepared as an abode for the living Buddha, the gandhakuti in its various later forms came to be "a special place in which the Buddha's presence could be recaptured" for and by the devotees.54 From a special dwelling place, the significance of the gandhakuti quickly ramified symbolically especially after the passing away of the Buddha. The most important representational aspect of the gandhakuti is the identification of the architectural structure with its dweller, whereby the flowery "new space" becomes coterminous with the figure of the Buddha. In further ramification of the gandhakuti, it is spoken of as a glorious house or as a large and elaborate temple,55 sometimes with an extraordinary quality. This is understandable in the context of devotional tradition whereby the gandhakuti is seen as the residence of a supra-human being. The Purnavadana, mentioned earlier, describes the scene of the Buddha's inhabiting the gandhakuti in the following fabulous terms: Meanwhile, [in Jetavana outside SravastT], the Lord washed his feet, entered his personal cell, sat on the specially appointed seat, assumed an upright posture, and established himself in full mindfulness. As soon as the Lord, with fixed determination of mind, set foot in his perfumed chamber (gandhakuti), the earth shook in six different ways: the great earth stirred, quivered and quaked; it shook, trembled and shuddered. . . . The nadir rose up, the zenith sank down. The zenith rose up, the nadir sank down. . . . Then, from his body the Lord radiated an effulgent stream of golden light. . . .56 The Buddha's house becomes the basis for morphological configurations of later structures and campuses when Buddhism becomes an organized religion. Originally, in the Buddha's lifetime, the residential gandhakuti was understandably located in the middle of a retreat surrounded by huts of other elders and monks and various monastic facilities. This is perhaps the protomonastic configuration for the later elaborate monasteries built after the death of the Buddha, where the central position in the campus was taken up by a temple-stupa bearing the designation of a gandhakuti. It is highly possible, as Coomaraswamy observes, that after the death of the Buddha, the residential gandhakuti became the first shrine or temple.57 Gregory Schopen, in analyzing epigraphic evidence, notes about certain tenth-century monasteries that the idea of gandhakuti was continued by designating and maintaining a space as a gandhakuti where the Buddha was thought to have been "a current resident and an abiding presence."58 Some of these practices were facilitated by the already-established idea of the homology of the Buddha and the gandhakuti described above. In brief, the essence of the gandhakuti was quickly magnified and expanded in both literature and architecture to characterize Buddhist temples, a morphological development that proceeded from the dwelling to a shrine. The body of the building When the Brahmanical text Bhagavata Purana talks of two habitations of humanity?the house and the body?it ascribes for architecture a role far wider than plain functionality.59 A homology between builder/ dweller (the sacrificer) and the built-object (altar) is an ancient theme in India.60 Rykwert, in his analogy of body 54.

The house is also an ideogram of the paradisal plan, in the center of which the human establishes himself.61 The analogy of the body and building also invokes a third element, the cosmos, uniting all three in a schema: the larger universe, the microcosm of the body, and the building as a mediational mesocosm. As Coomaraswamy writes: "The human frame, the constructed temple, and the universe being analogical equivalents, the parts of the temple correspond to those of the human body no less to those of the universe itself."62 The correspondence between the human figure and an architectural body is a trope present abundantly in phenomenal, mystical, or metaphysical terms in many cultural productions. The relationship between the ascetic dweller and his dwelling is a particular category in the discourse of body and building. At an immediate level, the ascetic establishes a spatial association with his elemental structure or space. With the Buddha, the relationship takes on multiple significances. An associative relationship between building and body is witnessed in the Buddha's house of fragrance where the presence of one signals the other. This is possible because the house belongs to the dweller in a sort of spatial intimacy. The intimacy is metrical, phenomenal, and figural. The "Pratimoksa,"63 part of the Vinaya canons that represents a list of rules for Buddhist monastic living, states that: "When a monk himself is begging to have a hut built which has no donor, being intended for himself, it should be made [according to measure]. This is the measure: twelve spans of the Sugafa-span;64 in width, seven spans inside/'65 The sugafa-measure represents an idealized physical dimension of the Buddha's body. The "Pratimok$a" rules not only prescribed sugafa-measure for the hut of the monk, but also for his robe, couch, rug, etc.; any deviation from that measure resulted in an offense. The actual measure of the sugata dimension has not been without controversy, because different texts suggest different measures for the Buddha, often making it absurdly high. However, a reasonable estimation of the dimensions of the Buddha makes the sugata span 25 cm., such that "applied to the various rules, this would give us a hut 3 x 1.75 meters?small, but adequate. . . . "66The dimension corresponds very well with the well-known ten-square-feet hut of the thirteenth-century Japanese writer Kamo-no-Chomei in his Hdjdki that further recalls the dimension of the magical house of the Mahayana figure VimalakTrti.67 The house of fragrance establishes an identity between the ascetic and his dwelling in that the two coexist in the same space, with one able to substitute for the other. An intimacy, and thus an interchangeability, between body and building is generated by the fact that the dweller is the only occupant of the space that is unmediated by others (figs. 9, 10). The intimacy is established by the dimensional property of the space, which does not seem to be an ensemble of places creating a topography of here and there. The space could be seen as the projection of the body, like a garment, which, in its closest proximity as a layer, sheathes or envelops the body. A dimensional proximity is crucial for strengthening the intimacy and for the space to be associative of the dweller.

The "Pratimoksa," or the Pali "Patimokkha," represents a list of confessional rules and degrees of punishment for Buddhist monastic living.

This primal intimacy is the basis for a fundamental anthropological exchange between a dweller and his dwelling. It is fundamental because we are considering a single subject, not immediately obligated to the exigency of the family, the next level of normative socialized association. I am not proposing the correspondence as a mystical unity of some sort, but as a vivid illustration of an ontological intertwining of corporeality and spatiality, where each can still articulate the other. It is in this sense that dwelling, along with clothing, becomes the critical zone of intimacy between the ascetic and the world.68 Figure 10. The preaching Buddha on an inverted-lotus throne inside a ca/fya-arch with his usnlsa almost touching the arch, from Gandhara. After Harold Ingholt, Gandharan Art in Pakistan (New York: Pantheon Books, 1957), plate 258. The digambara ascetics among the Jainas are described as sky-clad, since they go about fully naked and consider the wide space as their garment such that the zone of intimacy is totally unmediated. It is this ontological intimacy that forms the basis of a heightened symbolic articulation of the ascetic figure through architectural means. One recurrent motif in Buddhist representational art is the framing of a Buddha figure by a caitya arch (fig. 11). There are sculptures of the Buddha, mostly from the Gandhara region from around the third to first centuries b.c, where a seated Buddha figure is placed within an architectural frame with the frame's shape following closely the contour of 68. Lodging and clothing, along with food and medicine, are considered the nissayas, the four essential elements by which the monks (bhikkhus) negotiate the world. The nissayas are described in the VTnayapjtakas as part of the monastic codes, something that constitutes resources for sustenance. Literally, the nissayas are something on which "anything depends"?that is, the necessities of life upon which the life of a Buddhist monk depended. See The Pali-English Dictionary, ed. T. W.

After Harold Ingholt, Gandharan Art in Pakistan (New York: Rantheon Books, 1957), plate 127. the Buddha's body. There are a number of versions of this frame, from a somewhat rectilinear configuration to a simple pointed arch or a particular form that looks like a "tri-lobed arch."69 The latter is the shape of the so called caitya fagade that characterizes the architectural physiognomy of many Buddhist works of architecture, including the gandhakuti at Jetavana depicted on the Bharhut relief.70 In Gandhara art, besides being used to sheath the figure of the seated Buddha, the arches frame significant icons or even pictorial narratives from various Buddhistic themes. In any case, it appears that the shape of the seated figure "fits" perfectly the contour of the arch, the lower segment enclosing the splayed legs of the seated ascetic, and the upper segment bulging out to sheath the head and the upper body. The caitya arch, contoured by the figure of the seated ascetic as it were, appears in various forms in cultic practices, often without the literal representation of the Buddha. The intimacy suggested by the framing device also indicates a paradox when considering the house of an arch-ascetic as the Buddha. Although the framing device does not lead immediately to an understanding of the hut/house, it nonetheless suggests an elementary architectural system that corresponds to the profile of a hut. Among the framing devices, images show either an orthogonal frame where the topmost horizontal lintel is deformed or distended (fig. 12) or an arched shape where the central "peak" makes room for the intercepting head of the Buddha (or, in some pieces, other important figures). One possible interpretation of the "distended lintel" is that it seems on the verge of being deformed by the potent and suprahuman ascetic who can no longer be contained within the sheltering structure. As much as the sheltering space is a necessity, the framing is finally challenged by the greater reality of an "enlightened," larger-than-life figure (see fig. 15). This is the paradox that may have haunted Buddhist artists: How to in-frame (shelter) an arch-ascetic, a superman, who no longer can be contained within it? The "distended lintel" is particularly illustrative of the inherent paradoxical nature of asceticism. Without a textual explanation it would be convenient to describe it as a conventional decorative device, but it would be an oversight not to remark, even in a speculative 69.

The trapezoidal frame initially performs as some kind of shelter that demarcates a special zone for sacral objects or images. But, in its distended condition, the framing represents or visualizes the aporetic nature of the super-ascetic?the "perfected" one who has gained enlightenment, as someone of this world yet who can no longer be contained within it. The distended architectural frame serves a dual purpose that negotiates the ascetic paradox: It signifies the world and at the same time a transcendence from it. The representation is then simultaneously of a shelter superceded by a superman. The lintel, like the ushnfsha, is thus a sign of the excessive nature of the enlightened human being, of his breaking forth. Harmika: The zero point With the passing away of the Buddha, new symbolic and representational imperatives arose in Buddhist traditions (some of which had started in his own time). The stupa as a commemorative structure is one of the most important edifices of early Buddhism, a building practice that began immediately after Buddha's passing away (fig. 13).71 On top of most Buddhist stupas is a cubical structure known as the harmika whose significance, although not fully deciphered, makes it the most polysemic and enigmatic object in Buddhist architecture. In fact, the harmika and the stupa form a highly charged symbolic ensemble in Buddhism. The harmika is a distinctive feature of the Buddhist stupa: It adorns the apex of stupas, in most cases, as a cubical structure through which arises a vertical post (ya$ti) with a series of parasols. The form of the harmika varies from a simple enclosure (without the post-parasol ensemble) to a fully enclosed "box," to an unequivocal depiction of a dwelling. There are instances of smaller votive stupas where the harmika is clearly an architectonic structure, depicted sometimes as a hut-like piece,72 and even as Figure 12. The Buddha in a trapezoidal frame ("distended lintel"), along with other Buddha and Mahayana figures in pavilion-like structures, from a stele from Gandhara. After A. Foucher, L'art Greco-bouddhique du Gandhara (Paris: Leroux, 1905), fig. 77. an elaborate multistoried mansion.73 One of the votive stupas at Bhaja is remarkable in that two of the levels in the multileveled stupa show what I have described as the chaitya arch (fig. 14). It is plausible that this representation was derived from conventional houses of that time and then conveyed in a stylized way. But the chaitya arch is also a motif that has been used for the gandhakuti in various representations of Jetavana offering a possible link to the Buddha's house. If the harmika is also the Buddha's house, what kind of a house is this? 73. The stupas at Sand, Bharhut, and AmravatT show the harmika in the form of a simple enclosure of vedika railings. There are more elaborate harmikas, as in certain stupas in interior caitya halls, votive stupas, and stupas represented in relief art. The one in Bhaja (date unknown) mentioned here is by far the most elaborate, showing a mansion of sorts with details like the ca/fya-arch windows. 71. Although there was a tradition of making funerary mounds before the time of the Buddha, it was after his passing away that the construction of stupas as hemispherical relics or funerary mounds gained momentum within Buddhism. 72. In the seventh-century Ashrafpur Bronze Chaitya (found in present-day Bangladesh), the Buddha is actually seen sitting in a hut.

Foucher, L'art Creco-bouddhique du Gandhara (Paris: Leroux, 1905), fig. 71. While the literal meaning of the term harmika is a "little dwelling,"74 there is no unanimity as to what extent the harmika may be regarded as a dwelling, or what it signifies in the elaborate symbolical scheme of the stupa, even when some harmikas depict the profile of a Jetavana gandhakuti. The harmika refers not so much to a pragmatic residence but to a notional dwelling of the Buddha, something that may be seen as a final halting place in conceptualizing the ascetical itinerary. Among the various connotations of the harmika, it has been considered as a tomb, coffin, or sarcophagus?all perhaps referring to the pre-Buddhist practice of creating a mound or some kind of edifice over the remains of a special person. It is because of invoking the symbolism of the dwelling of "death" that the harmika might be described as the final or last abode.75 Dhatugarbha, or womb chamber, is a term that was applied to the harmika before it was used for the stupa where a funerary idea and an abode become conflated.76 The notion of the dwelling of "death" is further supported by considering the harmika as a kutagara, the initiation hut, or a house where one dies in order to be reborn.77 A funerary purpose enters here not in the sense of a literal death but rather of one who dies only to be "born" as a transformed self. The ascetic finality of receiving "enlightenment" or gaining "awakening" is interpreted as the penultimate transformation of the meditative ascetic, also understood as a climactic dying to this world. This dual meaning of attaining awakening and dying to the world is poignantly carried by the term samadhi. Samadhi is the yogic term for the last stage for meditational practice; it is also the tomb of a holy person.78 The locational relationship of the harmika in the geography of the stupa provides a more contextual understanding of this penultimate condition.79 H. Sarkar, 74. Harmya in Sanskrit is a dwelling {Atharva Veda), "a beautiful palace/' see Coomaraswamy (note 70), p. 80. The Divyadana describes the harmika simply as "a little structure on the stupa," noted by H. Sarkar, Studies in Early Buddhist Architecture of India (Delhi: Munshilal Manoharlal, 1966), p. 12. Sarkar also echoes the words of Buddhaghosa by comparing the harmika to the kutagara, a sort of a sky-room or lookout space on the top level of a multiterraced building. 75. J. Przyluski identifies the harmika as continuing the practice of Brahmanic square tombs; it may be noted that it was only the hermit who was given a befitting burial. See Przyluski, "The Harmika and the Origin of Buddhist Stupas/' The Indian Historical Quarterly XI (June 1935), pp. 199-210. James Fergusson's opinion was that the harmika is the location of a physical relic of an arahant, either as coffin or in vessel; see John Irwin, "The Axial Symbolism of the Early Stupa: An Exegesis," in The Stupa, ed. Anna Dallapiccola (Wisebaden: Franz SteinerVerlag, 1980). 76. A. Snodgrass, The Symbolism of the Stupa (Ithaca, N.Y.: SEAP, 1985), p. 254. Snodgrass cites the work of Anagarika Govinda, Stella Kramrisch, and James Fergusson. Snodgrass especially comments on the correspondence between the harmika and the amalaka on the Hindu temple and the common theme of the Cosmic Egg. 77. The Mahayana text Lalita Vistara (possibly from the third century), ch. 7, mentions that the pavilion occupied by the Bodhisattva while in his mother's womb is called a kutagara. See Coomaraswamy (note 70), pp. 86-87. But Coomaraswamy goes on to note that kutagara may ultimately suggest an "honorable building" or simply "a house with a finial (or finials)." Coomaraswamy discusses the kutagara as a room at the top of something and as "soaring," in "Early Indian Architecture: III. Palaces," (see note 9), pp. 43-44. Symbolically, the kutagara refers to the structure of metamorphosis, where one enters, dies to this world, and is born anew. 78. Eliade (see note 6), p. 77. 79. In that sense, the harmika is like the amalaka, the fluted melon-shaped object, placed as a coping stone on the peak of North Indian Hindu temples.

After James Fergusson, History of Indian and Eastern Architecture (London: John Murray, 1910), p. 137. echoing the words of the thirteenth-century commentator Buddhaghosa, compares the harmika to the literal meaning of kutagara, a sort of a sky-room or lookout space in a multiterraced building, or simply described, a piece within a larger ensemble that is located at the apex.80 Raul Mus takes that image up in more symbolic terms by seeing it as a "hut on a mountain top," where the stupa signifies a world-mountain.81 To Stella Kramrisch, the image of a structure on the mountain top refers to the "high temple," and such a locational structure marks the point of a potent transition. Kramrisch describes the "high temple" as representing "the zenithal pole of realization where this world ends and that world begins," and, by doing so, marks "the point limit of the manifest and the unmanifest, the Bindu."82 The harmika is also likened to a caitya-vrksa at the top of the world-mountain, whereupon the harmika -yasti ensemble becomes analogous to the "world tree" and the "cosmic axis,"83 and by doing so demarcates a sacred space (bodhimanrJa).64 The harmika is also interpreted as a crucial mark where the stupa is understood as an embodiment of the structure of ascetic meditation, wherein the harmika represents a very particular moment in the rising planes of yogic or ascetic consciousness.85 The meditational symbolism is rendered in corporeal terms in certain Nepalese stupa where the harmika is decorated with painted human eyes, "thus suggesting a human figure in the posture of meditation hidden in the stupa: the crossed legs in the base, the body up to the shoulders in the hemisphere, the head in the harmika."8b The significance of the stupa, with its apex as a transformative and dynamic marker, is amplified through further analogy with the idealized body of the Buddha, especially in iconic representations. In mapping ascetic physiology, Kramrisch identifies the ushnfsha, the cranial protuberance that purportedly occurs at the climax of ascetic meditation, as the "zero point of Nirvana." The ushnfsha signifies both the limit and rupture of the anthropomorphic figure and represents all that is "non representable" in the physiological experience of the engaged ascetic (fig. 15). In other words, it is an excess. Kamrisch notes: "At the zero-point, there can be no identity of any extent. Still, if this is to be conveyed by the image, a symbol, a no-thing may do it: the Usnisa."87 Similarly, Ananda Coomaraswamy interprets the harmika as the liminality of understanding, the very edge of production, proliferation, and expression that makes up our cognitive, experiential, and normative world. Coomaraswamy remarks about the stupa that "All that is mortal [is] contained within, and all that is amalaka, is that of an egg, bringing up association with the sun (the sun being Brahma in Vedic symbolism), who was born from a Cosmic Egg.

As Roth notes in tune with other commentators, the harmika signifies the Eightfold Rath in "Stupa-laksana," and marks the constituent of enlightenment known as "born on the fourth ground of meditation/' which results in not returning to this existence. See Roth (note 30), p. 194. This is based on a broader application of the identification of the stupa with the body of the Buddha as mentioned in the Lalitavistara. 86.

Van Oest, 1930), plate XXVI. immortal exceed[s] the structure/'88 Clearly, the harmika visibly marks that tenuous point, the threshold of embodiment and its excess. In this symbolically charged scenario, the innocuous little dwelling presents a vibrant polysemy: The harmika is both an image and structure of "awakening," a locus of the final transformation of the ascetic. The awakening corresponds to a critical initiation that in certain ascetic interpretation is akin to dying and being born anew. The phenomenon is emblematized when the harmika is placed in its critical spatial location either in the geography of the stupa, or analogically, as ushnfsha, in the physiognomy of the iconic Buddha. Both conditions point to the harmika as a heightened moment, as nirvana embodied, and as paradoxical as this may seem, as an embodiment that cannot be realized visually. In other words, the harmika is the last vestige of embodiment or incorporation, or as Kramrisch describes the ushnfsha, the harmika is the "zero point."89 Despite the profusion of symbols, the harmika refers to something close at hand: a finality. The harmika as the house of enlightenment is the final dwelling which is metaphorically constructed on the body of the stupa, or analogized on the figure of the Buddha that can still be envisioned as part of the ascetic journey. It is the image of the last vestige of things that binds one corporeally and cognitively to the world; it is, in fact, the last thing. The harmika is a glimpse of the "last" hut before the unspeakable nothingness. The last hut The rafters are shattered, the ridge-pole is destroyed, and the house-builder will no longer be able to erect the house again. ?The Dhammapada90 If a sense of finality is conveyed by the harmika, it appears in a much more cataclysmic manner in the language employed to account for the penultimate experience of the ascetic: enlightenment. The most literal and volatile imagery of the end of architecture may be found in a statement attributed to the Buddha when he reached an ascetic climax at the end of his arduous meditation. The description from the Dhammapada is compelling evidence of the conflation of body and building (fig. 16). In many ascetic narratives, the body is a hut whose existing lineaments and ligaments must be shattered before the enlightened life can begin.91 The shattering of the roof-rafters (v/Vafa chado) is the most cataclysmic expression in visualizing the transformative termination of the ascetic practice.92 88. Coomaraswamy, "Symbolism of the Dome" (see note 60), p. 437. 89. S. Kramrisch, "Emblems of the Universal Being," Journal ofthe Indian Society of Oriental Art III (1935). 90. Dhammapada, verse 154. 91. On numerous occasions, yogic ascesis itself is spoken of in architectural terms. The Milindapanha mentions that the five skilled mental states?the five cardinal virtues?are moral habit, faith, energy, mindfulness, and concentration, the last being the chief among them. "As in a house with a ridge-pole all the rafters go to the ridge-pole, lean towards it and join it, and the ridge-pole is pointed to as their chief, even so all those mental states that are skilled have concentration' {samadhi) as the chief, they lean, tend, and incline towards concentration." Similarly, the Majjhima-Nikaya mentions: "Just as the roof plate of a domed mansion is the peak that ties together and holds together, just so the sheltering roof of the skilful habits (is the peak that ties together and holds together) the six states of consciousness." (Majjhima-Nikaya 1.322-3, cited by Snodgrass [see note 76], p. 281.) It is this architectural analogy that will facilitate the equation of the attainment of final "awakening" with the dramatic shattering of the roof-plate or ridge-pole. 92. Various parables echo this theme, as when the Buddha uses the story of breaking the shell to enter a transformed life, a "second birth, described in the Suttavibanga, and discussed by Raul Mus, "La</page><page sequence="18">242 RES 53/54 SPRING/AUTUMN 2008 Figure 16.

The damaged quality of the archaeological piece may serendipitously represent the "shattering of the last building." The concept of "awakening" is undoubtedly the goal of Indie ascetic labor, including Buddhism.93 Even though "awakening" is a precise climactic moment, it is preceded by a sequence of renunciatory rites (samnyas), and disciplined labor (ascesis, srama). The sequence is both sociological and physiological. The sociological sequence represents the literal renunciation of society and family and the injtiation into the ascetic mode. The physiological sequence represents a psychophysiological transformation that begins with corporeal exertions (ascesis) toward a both subtle and cataclysmic transformation of the normative body.94 The finality of awakening is conceived of in volatile terms. And when that moment is to be represented, either in literary, iconographic, or architectural form, there is a challenge in expressing that peculiarly ineffable moment. The nirvanic moment, articulated as freedom from the so-called fetters of the world, precipitates an architectural destruction, where the body of the aspirant ascetic uses the hut as a trope, and the moment as a climactic and dramatic shattering of the rafters. The villain in the larger ascetic narrative is gaha95 the house in its most immediate sense of being in the world, socially, familially, and phenomenally. It is the primordial means of rootedness, and one of the principal foundations and causes for craving, be it biological or societal. It is craving, in one form or another, that generates the cycle of activities sheltered in a dwelling? birth, life, death. The Buddha identified the presence of being in this world with being in a dwelling?that is, being within a confined, enclosed, and defined space as gaha.96 No doubt, a whole world of sociological, political, familial, and ritual dimensions are implicated in that sense of being in a gaha. While the Buddha needs a real house for his dwelling, ideationally he is saying that the moment of enlightenment means that the need for dwelling is over?that is, social dwelling as a condensation of suffering, impermanence, and desire. From then on the relationship to the pragmatic dwelling is one of detachment. From the Buddha's perspective, the hut/ notion de temps reversible dans la mythologique bouddhique/' extracts in I'Annuaire de I'Ecole Pratique des hautes Etudes (1938), p. 13; and Mircea Eliade, Images and Symbols: Studies in Religious Symbolism (New York: Sheed and Ward, 1961; paperback 1969), pp. 77-78. 93. The English term "awakening" along with "liberation," "enlightenment," "transparency," or "emptiness," falls in the cluster of terms suggestive of the ascetic goal. The Buddhist concept is expounded through two Sanskrit terms: "nirvana" and "sunfiyata. There are different explanations within Buddhism itself, but it can be said that a principal difference with other ascetic ideologies is that the Buddhist achievement is a completely human endeavor and devoid of any supernatural or divine component and metaphysical import. 94. See Julius Evola on "the phenomenology of liberation/' in The Doctrine ofAwakening (London: Luzac Press, 1951), pp. 191-202. 95. The Pali term gaha (Sanskrit griha, Prkarit ghara) in its root meaning refers to girdling and encirclement, as a means of defining territory and at the same time marking the edge, which protects the central area. Griha is house, habitation, home in Vedic texts, and forms various compound words. Geha is a corrupted form of griha, still meaning house, dwelling, habitation in later texts, including the Mahabharata. Etymology suggests a possible link between gaha and ghere, to surround, to bound. Sir Monier Monier-Williams, A Sanskrit English Dictionary (Oxford: The Clarendon Press, 1899). 96. The Majjhima Nikaya I, 241. The Buddha describes that state of being as a confinement: ". . . [it] occurred to me that life in the home is cramped and dirty, while the life gone forth into homelessness is wide open; it is difficult to live a spiritual life completely perfect and pure in all its parts while cabined inside."</page><page sequence="19">Ashraf: The Buddha's house 243 house is not something to be adored; it is regarded as the last vestige of attachment. When the Buddha employs the hut as a metaphor for ascetic liberation, it is only a metaphor; there are no real equivalents to it. The volatile, destructive imagery of vivata-chado is one of resurrective death, of dying to this world, and being born again in order to create another "man," a body more purified and superior.97 97. Mircea Eliade, "Cosmical Homology and Yoga/' Journal of the Indian Society of Oriental Art 5 (1937), pp. 188-203. Eliade writes: "It is known that the characteristic of yoga practices, and chiefly of Patanjali's Yoga, is to create another 'man/ more purified, more unitary, who in his turn is being destroyed and replaced by another one, a superior one. ..."</page></plain_text>
