<plain_text><page sequence="1">Allan, Nina. Madness, Death and Disease in the Fiction of Vladimir Nabokov. Birmingham Slavonic Monographs, no. 23. University of Birmingham Press, Birmingham, 1994. 89 pp. Notes. Appendices. Bibliography. Price unknown. THIS brief monograph undertakes to shift the (assertedly excessive) attention from Nabokov the arcane stylist to the handful of key themes that define the wuvre as a whole. Although the bibliography cites works as recent as I 99 I, one cannot but wonder when this study was written since thematic studies of Nabokov's work have dominated the field since the early eighties. Even odder is the statement that 'Nabokov does not concern himself with the existence or otherwise of any hereafter' (p. 6o). Nabokov himself, his wife, and many critics have pointed to the centrality of this theme in his work. Although Allan lists</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 7 I 3 some of these critical writings in her rather slender bibliography, she seems not to have grasped the import of the 'hereafter' for her topic. This is unfortunate since her subject matter madness, death, and disease in Nabokov's fiction - assumes its meaning chiefly within the context of this master theme rather than in the more localized contexts she offers. Still more unfortunate is that she is apparently unaware of Christopher Hullen's book Der Tod im Werk Vladimir Nabokovs 'Terra Incognita' (Munich, I 990) which covers much of the same material and places it within the larger framework. Allan's choice of key themes is eminently reasonable: madness, death, and disease. She opens her rather schematic survey with a table ticking off the incidence of each phenomenon in Nabokov's novels. The three chapters define their key terms, divide the theme into subcategories, and then chronologically catalogue incidences through the novels, ending in a brief summation of their meaning. Allan begins her study with 'madness'. After taking due note of the difficulty of defining madness, she proposes 'the state arrived at by one who [. ..] is unable to retain equilibrium within the bounds set out by society, and who [. . .] is led to perform acts which could be said to be abnormal, damaging to self or others, starkly contrary to their usual mode of behaviour, or even illegal' (p. 3). One can only point out that by such a generous definition most fictional protagonists are mad. The 'mad', says Allan, fall into four categories. The first consists of 'True madmen' those who inhabit their own fantasy world and try to impose it upon 'reality'. These include such characters as Despair's Hermann, Pale Fire's Kinbote, Humbert Humbert, and Cincinnatus's jailors and executioner in Invitation to a Beheading. The category is valid but some of the assignments are suspect. Allan takes the position that Cincinnatus's jailors are mad and that Cincinnatus is a prisoner in the world of their collective fantasy. There is simply no reason to assume these characters are mad. They are the creatures of someone else's fancy, perhaps that of Cincinnatus or of an 'otherworldly' hidden authorial figure. The characters in the author's second category are 'not ... actually mad as such' (p. 14), but possess a 'hyperconscious' temperament much like that of Dostoevskii's 'Underground Man'. Here Allan groups Luzhin, Smurov (of The Eye), Pale Fire's poetJohn Shade, Ada's Aqua, and Vadim, protagonist of Look at the Harlequins! To see the pathetically obtuse (apart from chess) Luzhin as a variant of the 'Underground Man' type is an extraordinary stretch of the imagination. Smurov (admittedly a sensitive soul) and Vadim (arrogant beyond belief) both have created fantasy worlds that they unsuccessfully try to impose upon others, that is, they belong to the first rather than second category of madmen. Aqua Veen is quite mad and John Shade is perhaps the sanest man in Nabokov's fiction. The only plausible example of the 'hyperconscious' category is the hero of the early short story 'Terror', which Allan approvingly cites. Although the character has been seen by some as Dostoevskian, the link is rather with the Tolstoian theme of 'vastation': compare with his 'Memoirs of a Madman'. A third category includes characters who are pushed over the edge by extraordinary stress, while a fourth includes those suffering from 'clinical madness'. The latter, we are told, play merely a structural or plot role but lack thematic meaning.</page><page sequence="3">714 THE SLAVONIC REVIEW Examples of the former include lung, Queen, Knave's Franz, and Albinus from Laughter in the Dark. Here again one can only remark that these protagonists are not mad in any meaningful sense. They are simply foolish victims of sexual passion. Allan concludes from her examination of Nabokov's 'madmen' that he is illustrating 'the "borderline" nature of madness and the always uncertain distance between "benign" instability which gives its bearer, in compensation for the accompanying angst and anguish, the necessary insight for artistic creation or visionary genius, and a "malignant" lunacy which warps perception into delusion and makes of its victim an instrument of self-torture and a menace to others' (p. 33). I would suggest something rather different. Since all of Nabokov's madmen play plot roles, the only thematically significant type of madness is that in which the protagonist (often a first-person narrator) seeks to impose his own fantasy world upon that of the other characters or is a creature in the fantasy world of an 'anthropomorphic deity'. Murder, suicide, and natural death are the subcategories in Chapter Two. Nabokov's killers are, for the most part, 'false or flawed artists, and their commission of murder is their actual and symbolic failure of creativity' (p. 45). This summary observation, quoted from Ellen Pifer, is, I think, generally true. But problems again arise in Allan's assignments of characters to the category. To call the would-be murderer, Franz, an artist of any sort is bizarre. Perhaps the most egregious misassignment is from Pale Fire. Kinbote is the 'failed artist', of course, but he is not the killer. Allan attempts to work around this by proposing that 'Kinbote is spiritually responsible for the death of Shade the poet-king' (p. 43; see also p. 54). Suicide in Nabokov's work, we are told, results either from an excess of 'spiritual, intellectual or emotional perception' or the 'inability to live with this heightened consciousness and/or convert it into art' (p. 55). Such a description seems rather rarefied as an explanation of Hazel Shade's suicide. As Allan herself points out, the reason is decidedly homelier. The final category, 'natural death', is dismissed as serving only a plot role rather than having thematic meaning. Surely the natural death of Alexander Chernyshevsky in 7he Gift and Fyodor Godunov-Cherdyntsev's meditation on it (all unmentioned by Allan) are one of Nabokov's most significant treatments of the topic. Disease, subject of the third and last chapter in Allan's treatment, falls into two categories: heart ailments and, rather apologetically, sexual 'perversion' that is subdivided into homosexuality, paedophilia, and incest. The book contains an unfortunate number of simple factual errors about Nabokov's novels. To list a few representative examples: the table on page 2 listing 'instances of Madness, Death [...] in Nabokov's Novels' wrongly indicates there is a murder in Pnin, but neglects to record Pnin's mysterious heart ailment; Bend Sinister's tyrant Paduk is stated to be 'posing as a [... .] mad peasant' whereas the pose is that of a vagabond (p. 8); Despair's Hermann is described as a chocolate salesman whereas he is the owner of a chocolate factory (p. 5); Olga Krug's death is (mis)-attributed to cancer (p. 57), and so on. More disturbing are some of the odd readings of the novels such as the above cited case of holding Kinbote responsible for Shade's murder. Such assertions call for close argument rather than being tossed off in passing.</page><page sequence="4">REVIEWS 7I5 Nina Allan's monograph provides a convenient collation of three important Nabokovian themes. While the author recites the examples of each theme, her level of discussion remains superficial since she fails to place her thematic triad into any significant interpretative context. Madness, death, and disease are all 'liminal' states that Nabokov used over and over to hint at the existence of adjacent worlds. University of California at Santa Barbara D.
