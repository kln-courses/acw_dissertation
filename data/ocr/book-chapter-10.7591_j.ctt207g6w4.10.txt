<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> C H A P T E R  7 Chaos and Poststructuralism At  the same time that new concepts of chaos and randomness are b. changing the way scientists think about informational systems,  they are also affecting the way literary critics write about texts. The  major impetus for this revision has come from poststructuralism,  especially deconstruction. Paul de Man, for example, sees decon- struction as warning us that “nothing, whether deed, word, thought  or text, ever happens in relation, positive or negative, to anything  that precedes, follows or exists elsewhere, but only as a random  event whose power . . .  is due to the randomness of its occurrence”  (1979a: 69). As the text is opened to an infinitude of readings and as  meaning becomes indeterminate or disappears altogether, chaos ap- parently reigns supreme. In this extreme form, deconstruction seems  to have gone beyond the premises that make science possible. Yet Geoffrey Hartman (1976), confronted with the “tangled, con- taminated, displaced, deceptive” text of Derrida’s G/as, speculates  that deconstruction is opposed to more traditional, humanistic read- ings because it is more scientific. “The result for our time [of decon- struction in general and Glas in particular] may be a factional split  between simplifying types of reading that call themselves humanistic  and indefinitizing kinds that call themselves scientific,” Hartman  writes (p. 183). He is correct, perhaps in a sense he did not intend,  in linking deconstruction’s “indefinitizing” strategies with science. I 75 </page> <page sequence="2"> i j é  The Figure in the Carpet Deconstruction shares with chaos theory the desire to breach the  boundaries of classical systems by opening them to a new kind of  analysis in which information is created rather than conserved. De- lighting in the increased complexity that results from this “scien- tific” process, both discourses invert traditional priorities: chaos is  deemed to be more fecund than order, uncertainty is privileged  above predictability, and fragmentation is seen as the reality that  arbitrary definitions of closure would deny. In this chapter I draw parallels between poststructuralist philoso- phy and scientific attitudes toward chaos, then discuss particular in- terpretive strategies employed by Jacques Derrida, Roland Barthes,  and Michel Serres. In these analyses poststructuralism is my subject,  not my method. Whereas poststructuralist analyses commonly oper- ate upon texts to open within them fissures, discrepancies, and in- versions, my analyses operate upon poststructuralist texts to show  that they share with modern science assumptions and methodologies  that can hardly be explained without the assumption that both are  part of a common episteme. My approach is constructive rather than  deconstructive. It seeks to delineate an ecology of ideas, to see sim- ilarities between scientific and literary theories as interrelated propo- sitions that appear in separate discourses concurrently because they  are responses compatible with the cultural environment.1 This ap- proach prevails especially in the section that takes Derrida and non- linear dynamics as its focus. An ecological approach is not, however, able to explain the very  real differences between scientific models and critical theory. To elu- cidate how different evaluations can emerge from similar premises, I  turn to an economic model. Information theory and poststructural- ism concur in assigning a positive value to chaos. But where scien- tists see chaos as the source of order, poststructuralists appropriate  it to subvert order. Thus the scientific response appears fundamen- tally conservative, whereas the poststructuralist stance styles itself  radical. When institutional practices within the two disciplines are  taken into account, however, both responses appear equally conser- vative, serving to perpetuate rather than challenge the economic in- 'The term “ecology of ideas” alludes to Gregory Bateson’s Steps to an Ecology o f   Mind  (San Francisco: Chandler, 1972).

Representative texts discussed in  this section are Barthes’s S/Z  and Shannon and Weaver’s Mathe- matical Theory o f  Communication. The final section explores the synthesis of science and literature in  the work of Michel Serres. A key concept for him is equivocation,  the term that Shannon used to describe what is added to or sub- tracted from information as it passes through a noisy channel.  Equivocation’s inherent ambiguity— does noise add to information  or subtract from it?— is present on a deep level in Serres’s project.  Demonstrating a strong proclivity toward order at the same time  that it celebrates disorder, his work simultaneously tries to liberate  noise at specific sites and to suppress it in global theories. The multi- ple levels at which these equivocations work within his discourse  suggest that a theorist who locates himself at the crossroads of disci- plines is able to maintain this position because he employs linguistic  and conceptual structures capable of mediating between different  disciplinary economies. Throughout the three sections, I am concerned with rifts as well as  convergences, differences, and similarities. Yet the final impulse is to  show that both scientific and literary discourses are being dis- tinctively shaped by a réévaluation of chaos. It is this vision that  defines the contemporary episteme and differentiates it from the  modernist era. Ecology As is well known, deconstruction grew out of developments in  linguistics, particularly the Saussurean distinction between the signi- fier and the signified.2 As long as this distinction is accepted as valid,  we remain in the realm of semiotics rather than deconstruction. As  Saussure recognized, however, the signified is a concept rather than  an object. It is a small step to consider the signified as another signi- fier in turn; this step carries us out of semiotics into deconstruction.  For if the signified is another signifier, then its signified is also a 2For an overview see Jonathan Culler, Ferdinand de Saussure (New York: Penguin,  1977) and The Pursuit o f  Signs: Semiotics, Literature, Deconstruction  (Ithaca: Cor- nell University Press, 1981). </page> <page sequence="4"> i j 8 The Figure in the Carpet signifier, and we are caught in an endless chain of signifiers whose  meanings, if they can be said to exist, are indeterminate. Saussure initiated semiotics by proposing that the proper study for  linguistics was la langue rather than la parole, the system of lan- guage rather than words, and by showing that relations within la  langue could be specified only as a series of differences. The analo- gous movement within science came with Shannon’s theory of infor- mation. Saussure’s theory separated sign from referent; Shannon’s  theory separated information from meaning. In Shannon’s equa- tions, the informational probability of an element can be calculated  only with reference to the ensemble from which it is drawn, that is,  not absolutely but through a series of differences.3 This move allows  the information content of a message to be quantified regardless o f   its context or meaning. The inward-turning structures of Saussurean  linguistics and information theory are not arbitrary theoretical  choices. In the absence of external reference, these theories could be  defined only internally. (I explore the cultural implications of these  isomorphic strategies in chapter 10, arguing that they both reflect  and reinscribe the postmodern condition.) With deconstruction, the deeper implications of defining language  and texts through their internal relations became explicit. Derrida’s  O f Grammatology (1967; English translation 1976) announced the  birth of this deconstructive “monstrosity” (1976: 5). Until now,  Derrida says, Western thought has persisted in believing in a Logos  capable of revealing immediate truth. Speech is privileged because it  is the embodiment of Logos, the word that is also presence. Writing,  by contrast, is belated, a fall from presence into absence, the signifier  of a signifier, inferior because twice mediated. These assumptions  are inverted in O f Grammatology, which proclaims the beginning of  a “grammatological” epoch in which writing is privileged over  speech. At the center of grammatology is Derrida’s redefinition of writing.  In the grammatological view, writing (“écriture”) is not merely writ- ten marks but any signifying practice that endures through time and  functions to divide the world into self and other. This view of writ- Tor a clear explanation of how difference enters into Shannon’s theory, see N or- man Abramson, Information Theory and Coding  (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1963),  pp. 1 -4 4 . </page> <page sequence="5"> Chaos and Poststructuralism 179 ing was apparently inspired by Freud’s short essay “The Mystic  Writing Pad,” in which he likened the psyche to the child’s toy that  in this country is known as a magic slate.4 The conscious mind,  Freud suggested, is like the transculent sheet on which the child  marks with a pointed stick. The marks are visible because the sheet  is momentarily pressed into a wax base underneath. When the sheet  is raised, the marks disappear. But they have not entirely vanished;  their impressions linger in the wax base. The earliest experiences of  childhood, Freud argued, are like the marks on the sheet, disappear- ing from the conscious mind as the child matures. But they leave  traces in the deeper strata of the psyche, just as the marks leave  traces in the wax. For Derrida, writing includes not only marks on  the page but these deeper traces within the psyche. Residing at a  deeper level than words can reach, the Derridean trace remains inac- cessible to direct verbalization. It is “always already” present, the  elusive and ineffable difference from which all subsequent inscrip- tion derives. In this sense writing, as the mark of difference, not only  precedes speech but actually brings it into being. By making the trace inaccessible and indeed unknowable, Derrida  opens writing to radical indeterminacy. In contrast to speech, writ- ing operates according not just to Saussurean difference but to Der- ridean “différence,” a neologism that in French combines “to differ”  with “to defer” (Derrida, 1968). The “always already” formula im- plies that there is no origin, that the very idea of origin is an illusion.  Différance acknowledges a before and after— that is, a constituting  difference— but defers indefinitely the moment when this split oc- curred. No matter how far back we go into signification, we never  come upon the originary difference that could act as ground for the,  chain of signifiers. After writing O f Grammatology, Derrida moved on to other met- aphors to uncover fissures within Western metaphysics— the phar-  makon, the postcard, the hymen— presumably to avoid having his  project reify into a methodology that could become a metaphysics in  turn. Although there are suggestive parallels with the new paradigms 4My discussion of the trace is conjectural, as it is important to Derrida not to  define it. Derrida discusses Freud’s essay and its implications for deconstruction in  “Freud and the Scene of Writing,” in Writing and Difference, trans. Alan Bass, pp.  1 96 -2 31  (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1978). </page> <page sequence="6"> i8o The Figure in the Carpet in much of this later work as well, the resonances are perhaps strong- est in the early work in O f Grammatology, which also corresponds  most closely in time to the first wave of important discoveries in  chaos theory. I therefore will concentrate on this work, recognizing  that it is only one phase of Derrida’s continuing development of  deconstructive methodologies. That there is a methodology at work is a disputed claim, for posit- ing a method is a first step toward establishing an orthodoxy that  could quickly defeat the intent to unravel and undermine. Derrida  himself is extremely canny about recognizing and avoiding this dan- ger; even as early as O f Grammatology, he warned that his readings  were too “exorbitant” and “excessive” to fit into any standard  methodology (1976: 157-164). Nevertheless, one can scarcely fail to  notice that deconstructive analyses tend to follow a predictable pat- tern, especially in the hands of disciples less adroit than Derrida in  avoiding the dangers of reification. The method appears in paradig- matic form in O f Grammatology. First a received duality (speech/  writing) is destabilized by inversion; then the existence of a third  term (the trace) is revealed whose nature is undecidable because by  definition it falls outside the realm of discourse. The validity of the  speech/writing duality is thereby drawn into question, but no new  dialectic emerges to take its place because the emergence of a dialec- tic would depend upon being able to decide what the trace is. In the  grammatological approach, the original concepts do not entirely dis- appear but are put under erasure (“sous rature”). Seen and not seen,  absent and yet present, they function as reminders that the old  meanings are gone and as remainders that keep new ones from for- ming. Thus Derrida does not intend simply to replace one set of  priorities with another. Rather he attempts to undermine the very  process by which meaning is constituted. The vertigo characteristic of deconstruction appears when we real- ize that texts are always already open to infinite dissemination. Far  from being ordered sets of words bounded by book covers, they are  reservoirs of chaos. Derrida initiates us into this moment in O f   Grammatology through his concept of iteration. Any word, he ar- gues, acquires a slightly different meaning each time it appears in a  new context. Moreover, the boundary between text and context is  not fixed. Infinite contexts invade and permeate the text, regardless </page> <page sequence="7"> Chaos and Poststructuralism 181 of chronology or authorial intention. Hamlet, for example, influ- ences our reading of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead; but  Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead also influences our reading  of Hamlet. The permeation of any text by an indefinite and poten- tially infinite number of other texts implies that meaning is always  already indeterminate. Because all texts are necessarily constructed  through iteration (that is, through the incremental repetition of  words in slightly displaced contexts), indeterminacy inheres in wri- ting’s very essence.5 We can see iteration at work in the dense, highly repetitive anal- ysis of Rousseau that occupies the last half of the Grammatology.  Rousseau is well suited to Derrida’s deconstructive project because  his thought is expressed through a series of hierarchical dualities:  nature/culture, animal/human, speech/writing. For Rousseau, the  first term of each of these dualities is privileged. The second term is  belated, contaminated, a fall from the “pure” first term. His an- nounced aim is to correct modern decadence by returning to the  originary first term, rejecting culture for nature, writing for speech,  and so forth. Through a rigorous reading of Rousseau’s texts, Derrida shows  that this attempt at purification is fundamentally misguided because  the idea of origin is an illusion. The demonstration concentrates on  the “supplément,” a word that Rousseau uses in the Confessions as  a euphemism for masturbation. Sex is natural, good, healthy; but  tormented by fear of women and venereal disease, Rousseau contin- ually finds it necessary to resort to the supplement. Derrida shows  that a similar dialectic emerges with each set of Rousseau’s dualities  (1976: 141—164). Rousseau denounces writing but does so by writ- ing texts; he embraces nature but finds that its deficiencies require  the education he advocates in Emile, and so forth. To supplement  something implies that the original is already full and self-sufficient, 5For a discussion of iteration, see Derrida, O f  Grammatology  (1976), pp. 1 5 7 -   162. The concept of iterability also plays a prominent role in “Signature Event Con- text” (1977b) and in Derrida’s subsequent deconstruction of John Searle’s “Reply”  to “Signature Event Context” in “Limited Inc abc . . . ” (1977a). A fuller analysis of  how iteration enters into the Derrida-Searle exchange is given in N. Katherine  Hayles, “Disciplinarity and the University: What It Keeps Us from Seeing,” in The  Nature o f  the University, ed. Peter Shane (Iowa City: University of Iowa Press, forth- coming). </page> <page sequence="8"> i8 z  The Figure in the Carpet in contrast to the supplementary material, which comes after and is  superfluous. Yet in each case the first term— “nature,” for exam- ple— is “naturally” deficient, so that the supplement is indispens-  ible. In what sense then is the supplement more “unnatural” than  nature? Through this implicit contradiction, Derrida shows that the  supplement is in fact what allows the privileged term to be constitu- ted. The originary precedence of the privileged term is revealed as an  illusion, a myth or longing for origin rather than an origin as such. According to Derrida, every text will have a concept that func- tions as the supplement does in Rousseau. The supplement (or its  analogue) is, Derrida argues, a kind of fold in the text whose inde- terminacy is revealed through repetition.6 In his view such a fold is  necessarily present, because there must always be some means by  which the text can constitute the differences that enable it to postu- late meaning. The fold can be thought of as a way to create the  illusion of origin. Once it is in place, all subsequent differences are  declared to derive from the originary difference marked by the fold.  When the text is “unfolded,” this stratagem is revealed and the regu- lated exchanges between the alleged origin and subsequent differ- ences that enable the text to operate will appear. It is precisely this “unfolding” that iteration accomplishes. In Der- rida’s hands, repeating Rousseau’s language with incremental differ- ences becomes a way to unfold and make visible the inherent contra- dictions upon which the text’s dialectic is based. This iterative  procedure produces the undecidables that radically destabilize mean- ing. “It [is] certainly a production,” Derrida writes, “because I do  not simply repeat what Rousseau thought of [the supplement]. The  concept of the supplement is a sort of blind spot in Rousseau’s text.  . . . [The production of undecidables] is contained in the transforma- tion of the language [that the text] designates, in the regulated ex- changes between Rousseau and history. We know that these ex- changes only take place by way of the language and the text” (1976:  163—164). The goal of iteration is thus to make visible the lack of  ground for the alleged originary difference, thus rendering all subse- quent distinctions indeterminate. '’Derrida speaks of a “certain deconstruction which is also a traced path”  (1976:162). </page> <page sequence="9"> Chaos and Poststructuralism 183 Derrida’s deconstructive methodology is strikingly similar to the  mathematical techniques of chaos theory. Recall that Feigenbaum  attributed the universal element in chaotic systems to the fact that  they were generated from iterative functions (1980: 4—27). Fie  showed that for certain functions, individual differences in the equa- tions are overwhelmed as iteration proceeds, so that even though the  systems become chaotic, they do so in predictable or regulated ways.  Derrida claims that his iterative methodology is similarly regulated,  in the sense that its production of undecidables is not a capricious  exercise but a rigorous exposition of the text’s inherent indeter-  minacies. For both Derrida and Feigenbaum, iterative methodology is  closely tied in with the concept of the fold. Feigenbaum showed that  systems that make orderly transitions to chaos always have folds in  their iterative paths (p. 9). Within the complex regions created by  these folds, orbits wander in unpredictable ways. Where does this  unpredictability come from? Since the iterative formulae and com- puter algorithms are perfectly deterministic, it could come only from  the initial conditions. Iteration produces chaos because it magnifies  and brings into view these initial uncertainties. Similarly, Derrida  attributes textual indeterminacy to the inherent inability of linguistic  systems to create an origin. In Derrida, “always already” marks the  absence of an origin, just as inability to specify initial conditions  with infinite accuracy does for Feigenbaum. Thus nonlinear dy- namics and deconstruction share not just a general attitude toward  chaos, but specific methodologies and assumptions. There are, of course, also significant differences between them.  Feigenbaum works with mathematical formulae that are capable of  exact definition; Derrida is concerned with language, which is noto- riously resistant to formalization. One measure of these differences  is disagreement among deconstructionists and scientists on how ex- tensive chaos is. For Derrida, textual chaos is always already in  Rousseau and in every other text. Scientists, by contrast, acknowl- edge that ordered, predictable systems do exist, although they are  not nearly so widespread as classical science had supposed. Feigen- baum, for example, takes for granted that only certain classes of  iterative functions become chaotic. Moreover, he acknowledges that  until very recently, virtually all scientific knowledge derived from the </page> <page sequence="10"> 184 The Figure in the Carpet study of ordered systems (pp. 14-15). Whereas O f Grammatology  forecasts an apocalyptic break with logocentrism (a position that  Derrida was to modify and complicate in later work), scientists are  likely to think of their work as a continuation of what has gone  before. To a deconstructionist, a “recuperator” is beyond salvation;  for most scientists recuperation is not even an issue, because they see  their work as enhancing rather than discrediting traditional scientific  paradigms. Gregory Chaitin is typical in his view that algorithmic  complexity theory merely supplements classical probability theory  rather than supplants it (1975: 48). To the Derrida writing in O f   Grammatology such a statement would itself invite deconstruction,  for if the theory is supplemental it cannot be necessary, but since it is  necessary, it cannot be supplemental. . . . These differences are  symptomatic of the different values the two camps place on chaos.  For deconstructionists, chaos repudiates order; for scientists, chaos  makes order possible. These differences notwithstanding, Derridean deconstruction and  nonlinear dynamics are strikingly parallel in a number of ways. They  agree that bounded, deterministic systems can nevertheless be chao- tic; they both employ iteration and emphasize folds; and they concur  that originary or initial conditions cannot be specified exactly. Given  Derrida’s antipathy toward science (for him “objective” is a pejora- tive term), it is unlikely that his ideas are substantially indebted to  scientific sources. It is equally difficult to believe that Feigenbaum,  Ford, or Shaw has been influenced by Derrida. How to account for  the similarities? The two theories appear isomorphic not because they are derived  from a common source or because they influenced each other, but  because their central ideas form an interconnected network, each  part of which leads to every other part. Feigenbaum worked on iter- ative functions in part because advances in computer technology  made it easy to see how they performed over time. He was led to the  idea of an unreliable origin not because he was interested in the  questions of origin as such, but because it was the only place chaos  could have entered the system. For Derrida, working in a field domi- nated by Hegel, Nietzsche, and Heidegger, the question of origin  was highly charged. Once he postulated a lack of originary ground,  iteration was an appropriate methodology because it has the effect </page> <page sequence="11"> Chaos and Poststructuralism 185 of magnifying latent uncertainties. Thus Derrida and Feigenbaum  entered the network at different points and for different reasons. But  because chaos, iteration, and an unreliable origin form an intercon- nected system of ideas, the correlative concepts were brought into  play once the implications of the original premise were explored.  Deconstruction and nonlinear dynamics appear isomorphic, then,  because the concepts with which they are concerned form an ecology  of ideas. A theoretical model for conceptual ecologies has been proposed  by Stanislaw Lem (1981), who suggests that they can be modeled as  closed topological spaces. Within a given topology, only certain  forms are possible. Others are prohibited by the overall spatial con- formation.7 Not every possible form will be realized; particularities  of history and personality determine which actually appear and  which are repressed. All forms that are realized, however, are linked  to each other through the common attributes that define the space. Lem concedes that so many variables are at work within contem- porary culture that it can never be rigorously modeled as a topologi- cal space. Topological models have, however, been successfully used  in biology to predict (or, more accurately, to retrodict) what ap- pendages will appear for a given environment and set of genomes.  These programs are limited to retrodiction rather than prediction,  for in a highly complex system it is not possible to predict exactly  how the system will evolve because there are too many cusps where  minute fluctuations cause wide variations in future behavior.8 Once  one knows what has happened, however, it is possible to show that  the realized forms are consistent with the system’s topology. I con- jecture that this is the case for nonlinear dynamics and deconstruc- tion. They were not inevitable developments, but they were among  the possible shapes that could evolve within postmodern culture.  They are similar because they share in the constraints that define the  overall topology. 7For an explanation of topology, see Bert Mendelson, Introduction to Topology   (Boston: Allyn &amp; Bacon, 1962). 8Catastrophe theory comes to very similar conclusions. See René Thom, Structural  Stability and Morphogenesis: An Outline o f  a General Theory o f  Models, trans. D.  H. Fowler (Reading: W. A. Benjamin, 1975). F °r discussions of catastrophe theory  in relation to biology and linguistics, see René Thom, Modèles mathématiques de la  morphogenèse (Paris: Union Général d’Editions, 1975). </page> <page sequence="12"> 186 The Figure in the Carpet An advantage of the topological model is that it leaves room for  other kinds of explanation. It designates which shapes are possible,  but it does not say which will actually appear, or how their actualiz- ations are affected by such factors as disciplinary traditions and indi- vidual desires. To understand why deconstruction and the science of  chaos value disorder differently even though they model it in con- ceptually similar ways, we will need to consider what happens when  ideas are expressed within the boundaries of specific disciplines and  articulated through specific voices. Why, for example, does decon- struction want to break with the past, whereas nonlinear dynamics  wants to emphasize historical continuity? How do isomorphic con- cepts change when they are expressed in the tropes and linguistic  registers peculiar to an individual theorist? To explore these and  other questions, we turn from ecology to economy and equivoca- tion. Economy Warren Weaver remarks that Shannon’s theory of information is  powerful because of its economy of explanation (Shannon and  Weaver, 1949: 114—115). Implicit in the comment is the assumption  that the best theory is that which can explain the most diverse phe- nomena with the fewest principles. The tendency in science is to  simplify, to reduce the many to the few— millions of chemicals  to some hundred elements, for example, then a hundred elements to  three atomic particles. When the atomic triad proliferated into hun- dreds of subatomic particles with the advent of high-energy physics,  the scientific community was disturbed; economy had been violated.  An intensive search was undertaken for a grand unified field theory.9  When its outlines began to emerge, its power was understood to  reside in its ability to reduce an unruly mob to an elegantly simple  number again, the four forces that govern the organization of mat- ter. Shannon’s theory of information falls squarely within this scien- tific tradition. His theorems are powerful in the sense that they re- duce many different kinds of message signals to a few limit cases. The passion for economical expression seems to have been a per- 9An overview of grand unified field theory can be found in Davies, 1984. </page> <page sequence="13"> Chaos and Poststructuralism i8 y sonal as well as a professional aesthetic for Shannon. Colleagues  recall him as a brilliant theorist who could not bear to relinquish his  ideas for publication until they were expressed in the most economi- cal form imaginable. In an anecdote recounted in Grammatical Man  (Campbell, 1982), Edward Moore recalls that Shannon “would let a  piece of work sit for five years, thinking it needed to be improved,  wondering if he had made the right choice of variable in this or that  equation. Then, while he was still contemplating improvements,  someone else would come out with a similar result that was correct,  but so lacking in formal elegance that Shannon would have been  ashamed to have done such a shoddy job.” In contrast to Shannon’s dedication to economy is Roland Bar- thes’s exuberant expansiveness in S/Z. S/Z has a certain structuralist  orientation in its impluse to classify and categorize Balzac’s story  Sarrasine in accordance with five discrete linguistic codes. Signifi- cantly, however, it uses these codes not to reduce but to expand  Balzac’s text. Thus it is even more poststructuralist, sharing with  deconstruction the desire to increase message ambiguity as much as  possible— for example, through split writing, dense syntax, elusive  wordplay, and elliptical style. Barthes’s project is ideological as well  as aesthetic, for like Derrida he regards “correctness” as an illusion  perpetrated by centrist philosophy to control texts, language, and  power structures within society. In this respect information theory  and S/Z could scarcely be more different. At first glance, it appears that the political stances implied by  these different aesthetics are easily defined. Shannon’s theory is con- servative because it seeks to wrest order out of chaos, preserve mes- sage from noise, and guard correctness from contamination by error.  S/Z  is radical because it seeks to liberate noise from message, release  chaos from order, and overturn the hegemony of received interpreta- tions. But because these theories do not act in isolation— because  they are embedded within the economic infrastructures of their disci- plines— their actual effects are more difficult to assess. I shall argue  that when disciplinary contexts are taken into account, both theories  are conservative, serving to perpetuate rather than challenge the tra- ditions from which they come. First, however, it is necessary to look  more closely at the transformations Barthes effects with Balzac’s  short story Sarrasine as he re-presents it in S/Z. The radical stance that differentiates S/Z from information theory </page> <page sequence="14"> i88  The Figure in the Carpet is apparent throughout Barthes’s text. Declaring that he is not inter- ested in what Sarrasine means, Barthes distinguishes five codes at  work within his “tutor text” and identifies them with so many  “voices” speaking Sarrasine. He refuses to arrange them hier- archically in search of a total meaning. Moreover, he points out that  even within one code disparate connotations are often at work, as if  two voices were speaking at once over the same channel. These  “equivocations,” as Barthes calls them, are to be encouraged: In relation to an ideally pure message (as in mathematics), the division  of reception constitutes a “noise,” it makes communication obscure,  fallacious, hazardous: uncertain. Yet this noise, this uncertainty are  emitted by the discourse with a view toward communication: they are  given to the reader so that he may feed on them: what the reader  reads is a countercommunication. [Barthes, 1974: 145] Barthes concludes that “literatures are in fact arts of ‘noise’” and  declares that this “defect in communication” is “what the reader  consumes.” The equivocation in Barthes’s own text comes into focus with the  word “consumes.” With his assertion that literature is noise, he situ- ates his project in opposition to the information theory from which  he takes his terms. “Consumes” is a pivotal word because it recalls  the capitalistic context of Shannon’s career. Working at Bell Labora- tories, Shannon was necessarily concerned with commercial applica- tions of his work. He devoted considerable attention to how to get a  message through correctly (Shannon and Weaver, 1949: 3-93). As  we saw in chapter 2, Shannon defined any deviation from the in- tended message as the equivocation. One of his most important the- orems demonstrates that it is possible to reduce the equivocation to  zero if the code is chosen correctly. The equivocation that Shannon wants to eliminate, Barthes offers  up for consumption. Moreover, he claims that the reader will find  this extra information more delectable than the original message.  The persistent use of oral imagery in Barthes’s text creates a new  context for consumption, associating it with gourmandizing rather  than capitalism. In effect, Barthes replaces the commercial orienta- tion that sees correctness as an important value with a sensuality  that finds its most exquisite satisfaction in deviant orality. </page> <page sequence="15"> Chaos and Poststructuralism 189 Within his discipline, however, Barthes’s attitudes are not deviant;  they merely express mainstream beliefs in a risqué fashion. For the  economy of explanation that scientists regard with respect has long  been viewed with suspicion in literary circles. Some critical meth- odologies have attempted a scientific economy of explanation— ar- chetypal criticism and structuralism, for example— but they are the  exceptions rather than the rule. In general the literary community  favors convoluted explanations that expand the few to the many  rather than economical explanations that reduce the many to the  few. The phenomenon can, I believe, be understood in terms of the  economic infrastructure of the discipline. Before poststructuralism, literary criticism was confined to an ac- cepted corpus of literary texts for its subject material. This body of  texts remained essentially constant for decades, except for the influx  provided by living writers; meanwhile, the academic literary estab- lishment increased enormously.10 Even when the influx of new  writers is taken into account, the domain of critical theory has been  extremely restricted in comparison with the scientific domain, where  advances in technology and instrumentation continually open new  areas for research. Who among us has not known the fear of arriv- ing too late, when the texts have all been used up? Perhaps the  Bloomian concept of belatedness is not so much analysis as projec- tion, for even more than literature, literary criticism has operated  according to an economy of scarcity. Too many critics, too few  texts. Poststructuralism, especially deconstruction, overcomes this scar- city by showing how each text can be made into an infinite number  of texts. Moreover, it actually converts scarcity to excess by pro- claiming that theory’s proper subject is not only literature but theory  itself.11 In this sense, S/Z represents less the cusp between structural- ism and poststructuralism than a harbinger and consort of decon- 1(,This argument neglects, for simplicity, the movement to open literary study to  noncanonical works. As this trend can also be understood as a response to disciplin- ary economy, it would not change the essence of the argument, although it would  render it more complex.

Hart- man, “Crossing Over: Literary Commentary as Literature,” Comparative Literature  28 (Summer 1976): 2 5 7 - 2 7 6. </page> <page sequence="16"> ipo  The Figure in the Carpet struction. By opening the text to dissemination and by blurring the  distinction between “primary” and “secondary” works, deconstruc- tion converts a closed system operating according to a scarcity econ- omy into an open system based on autocatalysis. The more theory  that is written, the more texts there are for theory to write about,  because theory itself produces the texts that the next generation of  theory will consume. As we saw in chapter 4, physical systems that  are autocatalyzing can spontaneously reorganize themselves at a  higher level of complexity (Nicolis and Prigogine, 1977). Theorists,  unlike molecules, are conscious of the systemic organization they  help to build. The analogy is useful, however, because it suggests  that increased complexity arises not merely because of a decision by  an individual theorist but because the systemic economy demands it.  Thus the increasing number of theoretical texts in literary criticism,  as well as their tendency to organize themselves in increasingly com- plex ways, can be understood as responses to the discipline’s sys- temic economy. At this point the reader may object that my explanation is “scien- tific,” in the pejorative sense of reducing complex phenomena to  simplistic generalizations, when it relates deconstruction’s popularity  to its economic function within the discipline rather than to its intel- lectual and conceptual power. I do not dispute that deconstruction is  powerful. I would point out, however, that what it means for a the- ory to be powerful varies from discipline to discipline. We cannot  properly evaluate the claim for deconstruction’s power without first  inquiring into the disciplinary economy that gives meaning to this  term. Such an inquiry demonstrates that the aesthetics of decon- struction and information theory are consistent with their respective  disciplinary economies. Moreover, their contrasting views of what  counts as message and as noise are also consistent with these econ- omies. It is no accident, then, that conceptually isomorphic theories take  on different values when they are embedded in disciplinary matrices.  Meaning is always dependent on context, and different disciplinary  economies create significantly different contexts. These contexts are  reinscribed in Shannon’s and Barthes’s diverging views of equivoca- tion. They agree that all messages are mediated. However, Shannon  sees this as a regrettable fact of life, while Barthes envisions it as </page> <page sequence="17"> Chaos and Poststructuralism i y i opportunity for repeated penetrations of the original text. They con- cur that noise is inevitable. But Shannon wants to minimize noise,  Barthes to maximize it. Similarly, Shannon regards redundancy as a  necessary evil, whereas Barthes sees it as an erotic pleasure that  swells a compact text into a gargantuan commentary. A discipline is not, then, only an abstract field of inquiry. It im- plies a specific workplace and set of institutional affliliations, and  these in turn imply community norms that invest concepts with  values. Shannon was an electrical engineer who worked for the  world’s largest information conglomerate. At AT&amp;T, room in the  channel translated directly into more expense for the company.  Shannon’s dedication to economy was reinforced by the multina- tional corporation that gave him a paycheck, as well as by the scien- tific community that gave him recognition. Consequently, he was  not interested in just any economical explanation. He looked for one  that would allow language itself to be more compressed. He did  pioneering work on how to eliminate redundancy through proper  coding (Shannon, 1951). His credo was compatible with the com- mercial economy within which he worked, as well as with the disci- plinary economy that informed his aesthetic sensibility. Reduce and  simplify, shorten and compress. Barthes’s approach is the opposite. Not only does he convert Bal- zac’s 13000-word short story into a 75000-word analysis; he also  implies that there is no valid way to compress this expansive inter- pretation. He defines the five codes in an appendix, for example,  indicating that in compressed form they are peripheral to his enter- prise rather than its concentrated essence. This ideology of excess is  not, of course, unconnected to his economic situation. He writes as a  critic within a literary establishment, where fame, money, and power  come from generating new words from old texts. The more texts are  opened to accommodate his words and others, the more the commu- nity in which he works will reward him. The different values Barthes and Shannon assign to equivocation  can now be brought into clearer focus. Recall that Shannon defined  equivocation as information that the message sender did not intend.  From a commercial point of view this information is superfluous,  since the company transmitting the message is unlikely to be reim- bursed for it. Consequently, Shannon assumed that the equivocation </page> <page sequence="18"> i$2  The Figure in the Carpet should be subtracted from the received message to get the original  text back again. Barthes naturally disagrees, for if a text’s meaning  were limited to what the writer intended, the possibilities for literary  criticism would be drastically curtailed. Since the canonized author  is not paying for the message transmission, his intentions have no  economic value. On the contrary, it is the consumers of Barthes’s  critical text who matter, and it is in their interest to see message  noise increased, for then they are reassured that new and different  books can be produced from the same canonized texts. Barthes  therefore advocates that the equivocation should be added to the  message rather than subtracted from it. When Barthes contrasts rereading with consumption, he makes  this difference in orientation explicit. Rereading, an operation contrary to the commercial and ideological  habits of our society, which would have us “throw away” the story  once it has been consumed (or “devoured”), so that we can then move  on to another story, buy another book, and which is tolerated only in  certain marginal categories of readers (children, old people, and pro- fessors), rereading is here suggested at the outset, for it alone saves the  text from repetition (those who fail to reread are obliged to read the  same story everwhere). . . . Rereading is no longer consumption, but  play. [1974: 15-16] The emphasis on play is thus Barthes’s answer to Shannon’s ideol- ogy of use. If texts are useful, then they can be used up. Only when  they are infinitely equivocal, forever supplementing their original  message with noise supplied by the reader, are they saved from the  capitalistic economy that would consign them to obsolescence. But wait. The situation cannot be this simple. Surely there must be  room within disciplinary economies for moves that run counter to  the mainstream or that deflect it in a different direction. Otherwise  disciplines would be much more homogeneous than we know they  are, and they would be static over time, which we know they are  not. I turn now to discuss a countermove within information theory  which foreshadowed the shift to chaos theory. I also interrogate Bar- thes’s reading more closely, seeing in it a complex strategy having as  much to do with his individual desires as with the disciplinary econ- omy within which these desires are inscribed. </page> <page sequence="19"> Chaos and Poststructuralism 193 If Barthes had read Weaver’s essay in The Mathematical Theory  o f  Communication, he would have found the opposition sounding  very much like him. Like Barthes, Weaver is a commentator. His  essay originally appeared as an article in Scientific American and  was intended to interpret Shannon’s theory for a general scientific  audience. Like Barthes, Weaver cannot resist expanding his role as  commentator. He therefore speculates on how information theory  might be extended beyond the strict engineering interpretation that  Shannon gave it to include questions of semantics and behavior. As  he leaves behind the terminology of use for the language of desire,  his perspective undergoes a significant change. He suggests that into  Shannon’s diagram one might insert a box for “semantic noise,”  responsible for “perturbations or distortions of meaning which are  not intended by the source but which inescapably affect the destina- tion.” This sounds conventional enough; however, he then goes on  to say that “it is also possible to think of an adjustment of original  message so that the sum of message meaning plus semantic noise is  equal to the desired total message meaning for the destination”  (Shannon and Weaver, 1949: 116). Thus the “desired meaning”  goes from being what the sender intended to whatever comes out at  the end after semantic noise has been included. With this shift Weaver comes very close to Barthes’s position. S/Z  is designed to increase semantic noise as much as possible, both in  the interpretations it brings to bear on Balzac and in the extensive  commentary it physically inserts between Balzac’s message units.  When Weaver suggests that desired meanings could result from the  addition of semantic noise, his formulation is in sympathy with Bar- thes’s project to increase noise as much as possible. Is it a coinci- dence that a commentator should envision information not intended  by the sender as being also desirable, perhaps even more desirable  than the authorized message? However we wish to read Weaver’s  flirtation with equivocation, it is clear that here, in a text bound  together with Shannon’s original articles and read widely through- out the discipline, is a voice expressing views at odds with the disci- plinary economy. Thus individual desire is also a factor affecting the  way theories are interpreted. For Barthes, desire and economy are mutually reinforcing. Yet </page> <page sequence="20"> 1^4 The Figure in the Carpet economic motives that have their bases in disciplinary infrastruc- tures may still be shaped in distinct ways by individual desire. To see  how this works in S/Z, consider how Barthes chooses to decode his  “tutor text.” He writes as if the codes he distinguishes are preexis- tent in the culture, in the text, or in both together. As Shannon could  tell him, this is not true. Codes are a matter of choice. They may be  chosen well or ill, but they are always chosen, not inherent in the  message. The code that carries the most interpretive weight in Barthes’s  reading is what he calls the “Hermeneutic Code,” the “Voice of  Truth.” This code traces Sarrasine’s simultaneous pursuit and eva- sion of the truth that Barthes situates at the center of Balzac’s tale:  that Zambinella, the singer with whom Sarrasine has fallen violently  in love, is not a woman but a castrated man. Barthes’s decoding  suggests that the exchanges in Balzac’s story proceed according to an  economy of castration. In his reading, all the characters are located  in relation to the phallus— whether they want one, pretend to have  one, or want to take one away from someone else. Moreover, castra- tion is presented as being highly contagious, so that by the end of  the story virtually every character is presented as having caught it,  even those who never had a penis to begin with. Barthes thus reads  the story as a superstructure erected on the economic base of the  phallus. A very different way to read the story is implicit in Barbara John- son’s critique of Barthes’s interpretation (Johnson, 1980). She points  out that Barthes supplies the word “castration” ; Balzac’s text never  uses it. “Castration is what the story must, but cannot, say. But  what Barthes does in his reading is to label those textual blanks  ‘taboo on the word castrato.’ He fills in the textual blanks with a  name. He erects castration into the meaning of the text, its ultimate  signified” (p. 11). In contrast to Barthes’s focus on castration, John- son’s reading puts narcissism at the center of Balzac’s story. In her  view, Sarrasine’s transgression consists not in coming into contact  with the highly contagious disease of castration but in preferring an  essentially male fantasy of what a woman is— a man without a  penis— to the radical otherness of woman herself. Johnson’s reading makes clear that Barthes’s decoding of Balzac’s </page> <page sequence="21"> Chaos and Poststructuralism i&lt;?j text is not merely a neutral report on what is there but a strategy to  gain control of the text’s meaning. Disclaiming any desire to control  the text, to silence or neglect any of its multivalent voices, Barthes  nevertheless centers it on a void for which he then supplies the  name. Moreover, his claim that it is what has been added to Balzac’s  text that most satisfies desire resembles Sarrasine’s narcissism. Delet- ing from Sarrasine’s actions the egotism of which he too is guilty,  Barthes gets the pleasure of a narcissistic correspondence between  his interpretive strategy and Sarrasine’s character, while at the same  time interpreting both so as to conceal this common feature. Barthes cagily avoids the question why he choses Sarrasine as his  “tutor text,” but Sarrasine is ideal for his purposes despite its realis- tic texture, for it has an absent center in the missing phallus. Because  this center is already empty, Barthes’s strategy of filling it as he de- sires can be hidden from notice. Using the same strategy, Barthes  attributes to information a centrality and to his “noise” a mar-  ginality that imply he does not share in the will toward mastery he  attributes to information theory. But when noise occupies center  stage— as it surely does in S/Z— this constituting difference between  information and noise ceases to operate.12 When the center is  empty— or has been emptied by discourse that claims to be margi- nal— there is no meaningful distinction between margin and center  in terms of the power they exercise. Thus Barthes’s reading of Balzac  cannot be understood solely through its reinforcement by a disciplin- ary economy. Also important are individual desires and agendas. Like ecology, then, economy is an incomplete explanation. Ecol- ogy limits what can be but does not determine what is; economy  influences what will be heard and attended to but does not ade- quately explain why a message is presented in a particular way in a  given text. Since equivocation has emerged as a pivotal term, it obvi- ously signals an intersection of some importance. In the work of  Michel Serres, equivocation appears in highly fissured and self-re- l2The more general point is that deconstruction depends upon a rhetoric of mar-  ginality, which can be effective only when it is in a minority position. To the extent  that deconstruction has become an accepted ideology within literary studies (if not,  indeed, a majority position among publishing scholars), it is in the same position as  Barthes in S/Z. </page> <page sequence="22"> i y 6  The Figure in the Carpet flexive form, marking a site where the divergences and complicities  among ecological constraints, economic infrastructures, and individ- ual desires come strongly into play. Equivocation Of the literary theorists discussed in this chapter, Michel Serres is  by far the most knowledgeable about the science of chaos. It is cen- tral to his project; there is scarcely a chapter of his extensive writing  unconcerned with its implications. He uses it, however, in two dif- ferent ways. In the first, the new paradigms provide him with an  implicit vantage point from which to reassess classical concepts.  Such a standpoint is necessary, he implies, because we still operate  largely within the boundaries of classical thought. Frequently he  chooses as sites for this reassessment moments when the classical  paradigms were forged, such as the origin of geometry or the formu- lation of an ideal Platonic object. By showing what was excluded at  these originary moments, he reveals the complicities that classical  constructions share. In the other mode, Serres attempts to extend the new paradigms  to universal theories. Perhaps the best known is parasitism (The  Parasite, 1982b). Playing on the three senses (in French) of the para- site— noise in a communication channel, an unwelcome guest, and  an organism that feeds off its host— he uses its equivocal connota- tions to create a general theory of exchange. In my view the theory is  not successful, for reasons I will indicate shortly. But I find it inter- esting that such a theory was attempted at all. Why would the theor- ist who warns us that “the global does not necessarily produce a  local equivalent, and the local itself contains a law that does not  always and everywhere reproduce the global” (1980: 75) want to  create a global theory? The problem is not peculiar to Serres. As we shall see in chapter 8,  it engages many contemporary theorists. I believe that it arises be- cause the more intense the theorist’s commitment is to the ideology  of the local, the more he feels compelled to strengthen it by making  it universally valid. This compulsion leads to a paradoxical attempt  to extrapolate a general theory from paradigms that imply there are </page> <page sequence="23"> Chaos and Poststructuralism J97 no general theories. In its paradoxical impulses as well as its subject  matter, Serres’s project is prototypical of attempts to extend chaos  theory to a general theory of culture. Out of its strong internal ten- sions— one might almost say out of its turbulence— equivocation  emerges as a central concept. As different voices compete within the  channel of Serres’s writing, equivocation serves both as the keystone  for his theory of communication and as a metaphor for the conflict- ing impulses inherent in his interdisciplinary approach. Serres’s commitment to local knowledge is apparent in his essay  “Platonic Dialogue” (1982a: 65-70). He points out that writing is  inherently global, because it is “first and foremost a drawing, an  ideogram, or a conventional graph” (p. 65), that is, a mark recog- nized as a form independent of its particular manifestation. Experi- enced readers are so accustomed to screening variations in letter for- mations from consciousness that they are only subliminally aware of  them. But children learning to read frequently notice and comment  upon the difference between a printed and a handwritten a, or be- tween f  s with curved and straight bottoms. To the adult reader, the  child’s focus on these variations is misguided; yet these “cacogra-  phies” (1982a: 66), as Serres calls them, are all that ever exist. In  learning to suppress local variations, Serres implies, we also blind  ourselves to the richly various actualities of the material world. No less than writing, speech also depends upon suppressing the  actual in favor of the ideal. Regional dialects, mispronunciations,  stuttering, and slurring are routinely processed not as the sounds  they actually are but as the idealized forms they represent. Thus “the  first effort to make communication in a dialogue successful is iso- morphic with the effort to render a form independent o f  its empiri- cal realization” (p. 69). Through this demonstration, Serres opens a  passage between the Platonic dialogues and the development of  mathematics. What a Greek geometer meant by a circle, for exam- ple, was not the wavering form drawn in the sand but the abstrac- tion toward which the mark was an imperfect gesture. Why, Serres  asks, does mathematical discourse even today use the consensual  “we” in demonstrations and proofs (p. 68)? Because mathematics is  assumed to operate in a realm purged of all accidental, transitory  features— that is, a space free of noise. Hence the Q.E.D.: “the dia- lectical method of the dialogue has its origins in the same regions as </page> <page sequence="24"> i&lt;?8 The Figure in the Carpet mathematical method, which, moreover, is also said to be dialecti- cal” (p. 69). The argument’s thrust up to this point is to show how  thoroughly the suppression of noise has been incorporated into the  foundations of modern thought. From this demonstration Serres attempts to develop a general the- ory of communication. A dialogue, he asserts, “is a sort of game  played by two interlocutors considered as united against the phe- nomena of interference and confusion. . . . These interlocutors are in  no way opposed. . . they battle together against noise. . . .  To hold a  dialogue is to suppose a third man and seek to exclude him ” (pp.  66—67). Although it is not clear why noise should be identified with  a “third m an,” Serres apparently arrives at it by analogy with the  excluded middle of binary logic. Just as classical mathematics devel- oped by excluding a third possibility between true and false, so dia- logues (and dialectics) evolved by excluding a “third man” who  threatens to disrupt communication. In privileging the “third m an,” Serres ostensibly proposes to de- construct the traditional hierarchy of information and noise by in- verting it and then revealing the existence of a hitherto unrecognized  third term. This deconstructive thrust, however, gives way to the  synthetic impulse to make the parasite into a universal concept in its  own right. As Serres moves from reinscribing local knowledge to a  synthetic theory of noise, conflation is the order of the day. In The  Parasite, the “third m an” becomes a general operator that applies  indiscriminately to La Fontaine’s fables, thermodynamically irrevers- ible systems, communication channels, and economic exchanges.  Such wide-ranging application is possible only because of meta- phoric slippage in the half-numerical, half-anthropomorphic “third  man.” The “third m an” can act as an operator in human exchange  because it anthropomorphizes noise; it can explain why systems be- come more complex because it goes by the same name as the formal  term that appears in information theory. With such equivocal definitions, it is scarcely surprising that vir- tually any exchange can be explained in terms of the parasite. But  what does such a theory tell us? Whatever else it intimates, the the- ory works (if it works) only by assimilating obvious differences into  apparent similarities. And yet the explicit intention in creating it was </page> <page sequence="25"> Chaos and Poststructuralism 199 to liberate the noise of empirical differences from the oppression of  idealized similarities. Given this paradox, it is instructive to see how Serres treats the  suppression of difference when other people do it. In “Mathematics  and Philosophy: What Thales Saw . . .” (1982a: 84—97), Serres takes  as his historical site Thales’s discovery that he could determine the  height of a pyramid by measuring its shadow. He imagines Thales  standing in the Eygptian desert before one pyramid; two others  loom in the distance, the same and yet somehow different. The  mathematical concept of similarity, Serres suggests, is already en- coded into the scene. Thales stands “in the domain of implicit  knowledge” (p. 89); all he need do is make it explicit. Yet the move- ment from implicit to explicit knowledge is not inconsequential. It  requires that the shadow be negated in its particularity and rendered  as the mark of an idealized form. Thus at the birth of geometry, the  “shadow of opinion, of empiricism, of objects” is sacrificed to “the  sun of knowledge and of sameness” (p. 90). The components of the scene, Serres notes, are the same as those  in Plato’s allegory of the cave: sun and shadow, explicit and implicit  knowledge, idealized form and empirical fuzziness. No less than the  allegory of the cave, the origin of geometry establishes “the scene of  representation . . . for Western thought for the next millennium” (p.  92). Only when this “immense historical cycle had finally come to  an end” (p. 93) could non-Euclidean geometry and Cantor’s “mon- strous” sets enter the space of knowledge as legitimate subjects for  inquiry. According to Serres, the shift is characterized by the dis- placement of a linear, chronological aesthetic based on a vision of  time passing always at the same pace and measured in the same  units by an aesthetic that focuses on spatial deformations and local  turbulences.13 This line of thought suggests that spatial metaphors will be central  to an understanding of the rhetorical moves that allow Serres to  celebrate difference in his inscriptive mode while simultaneously 'T he influence of Mandelbrot is clear here. I suspect, however, that Serres may  not really understand the mathematics, for fractal geometry has not renounced glob- alization by any means (a point discussed in chap. 8). </page> <page sequence="26"> 200  The Figure in the Carpet suppressing it in his general theory. Generally speaking, space for  Serres is identified with difference, whereas time connotes sameness.  In Feux et signaux de brume  (1975) he writes, “Time [is] the most  immediate and simplest esthetic projection of ordered structure.  W ith time, the esthetic is in order and those in political power are  quite pleased. Spaces are repressed because they are possibly, better  yet, certainly, disorderly. Reason, the political powers that be, prefer  order rather than disorder, time rather than space, history rather  than multiplicities” (p. 164). W hat metaphors does Serres use to lib- erate space from the “political powers that be” ? M ore precisely,  w hat metaphors allow him to negotiate between the drive tow ard  synthesis in his own writing and the authorized voice that locates  this impulse in external political authority? One is the image of the passage, the journey negotiated with diffi- culty between narrow  straits. In Hermes V  (1980) Serres appropri- ates this geographical terrain as a central m etaphor for his project,  especially for the passages of his writing: No, the real is not cut up into regular patterns, it is sporadic. . . .  I am  looking for the passage among these complicated cuttings. I believe, I  see that the state of things consists of islands sown in archipelagoes  on the noisy, poorly understood disorder of the sea. . . . Passages  exist, I know, I have drawn some of them in certain works using  certain operators. . . . But I cannot generalize, obstructions are mani- fest, and counterexamples abound. [1980: 23—24] The mediating potential of this image is made clear in Serres’s dis- cussion of space in classical Greece (1982a: 39—53). “The Greek  cities were dispersed, reciprocally closed insularities . . .  in which  every man worthy of the name . . . was inside, while on the exterior  of this political space animals, barbarians with growling languages,  circulated in a chaotic multiplicity of sociopolitical spaces” (p. 51).  In this world, when connections are lost or passages not completed,  no one “can speak any longer, and we have the irrational or  the unspeakable— the incommunicable, to be very precise” (p. 50).  The Greeks dedicated themselves to  rationality, Serres implies, be- cause universality was a hard-w on accomplishment in their dis- persed space. W hen one must fight to establish connections, one </page> <page sequence="27"> Chaos and Poststructuralism z o i does not worry about the tyranny of globalizing theories or univer- sal forms. In contrast to the “sporadic” space of ancient Greece is the global  village Serres inhabits, spanned by supersonic transport and bound  by instantaneous satellite communication. Why does he assume this  space is “in tatters” ? Because the assumption is one of the rhetorical  gestures that allow him to reconcile his globalizing impulses with his  commitment to local knowledge. “Therefore I assume there are fluc- tuating tatters,” he writes in a statement only apparently at odds  with his attempt to build universal theories (1980: 23). In fact, the  assertion is what enables the theories to be advanced, for it is only  when space is inherently and irrecoverably “tattered” that these the- ories are distinct from the repression of difference which the powers  that be practice. For Serres to assume that his space is dispersed is as  audacious as for the Greeks to assume that their space was contin- uous— and as necessary. These divided impulses— the desire to proclaim space dispersed  and the effort to assimilate difference into similarity— join in the  image of the spiral. It is an appropriate image, for in its upward  thrust it expresses the yearning for difference; then difference is as- similated into similarity when the trajectory conforms to a circular  pattern; yet difference asserts itself again as the spiral continues up- ward, ad infinitum. Serres’s essays are characteristically structured  as spirals, coming around again and again to the same point dis- placed along an axis. For example, in “The Apparition of Hermes:  Dom Juan” (1982a: 3—14), the same operators are recycled through  slightly displaced locales in Molière’s play. “The demonstration be- gins again” (p. 5), he writes as he considers the first act; “the same  demonstration begins again” (p. 8), he repeats a few pages later;  once more, the “demonstration begins again” (p. 13), until he finally  arrives at patterns so pervasive that he can proclaim them to be  “universal” (p. 11). The classical text that Serres identifies as closest to his world view  is Lucretius’s De rerum natura. It is, he argues, structured like a  spiral (1982a: 98—124). Moreover, it envisions the universe as a spi- ral. “Space and time are thrown here and there. There is no circle.  But stochastically, turbulences appear in space and time. And the </page> <page sequence="28"> 202 The Figure in the Carpet whole text creates turbulence . . . the creative science of change and  of circumstance is substituted for the physics of the fall, and of rig- orous trains of events. Neither a straight line nor a circle: a spiral”  (p. 99; emphasis added). The ideology of the local, never entirely  absent in Serres’s writing, is explicit in this essay. Had Lucretius’s  vision of the clinamen prevailed, the world might be dedicated to  chaos rather than order, Venus rather than Mars, love rather than  death. “The order of reasons is repetitive, and the train of thought  that comes from it, infinitely iterative, is but a science of death. . . .  Stable, unchanging, redundant, it recopies the same writing in the  same atoms-letters. . . . Everything falls to zero, a complete lack of  information, the nothingness of knowledge, nonexistence.” But  when the Lucretian clinamen enters the picture, it “cures the plague,  breaks the chain of violence, interrupts the reign of the same, invents  the new reason and the new law . . . gives birth to nature as it really  is” (p. 100). As we saw in chapter 4, turbulence cannot be ade- quately modeled through any simple form. Certainly it cannot be  modeled as a spiral, which is far too orderly and predictable to ex- press its extreme complexity. Serres does not so much express turbu- lence, then, as tame it when he envisions the world as a spiral. The  strategy suggests that he may be more ambivalent about disorder  than his rhetoric indicates. This ambivalence is writ large in the contrast between the retro- spective and globalizing modes in Serres’s writing. Returning to sites  where global theories were formed, he reinscribes the local knowl- edge they suppressed; but looking at the world locally, he cannot  resist organizing scattered sites into global theories. I conjecture that  Serres, despite his professed commitment to the local, keeps driving  toward the universal because he cannot help feeling what virtually  all scientists and very few poststructuralists do: the power of scien- tific explanations. His writing does not merely discuss literature and  science. Informed both by the expanding economy of poststructual-  ism and by the contracting aesthetic of science, it is literature-and-  science. Taking equivocation as its central topos, it is also itself  deeply equivocal, for the different voices of literature and science are  both trying to occupy the same channel at the same time. In “Lucretius: Science and Religion” (1982a: 98-124), Serres </page> <page sequence="29"> Chaos and Poststructuralism zo$ tackles the problem of his divided loyalties head on. Science, he ac- knowledges, is universal: “Two and two make four; heavy bodies  fall, according to the law of gravity; entropy increases in a closed  system, regardless of the latitude and whatever the ruling class.”  How can this universality be reconciled with a proposition he be- lieves just as strongly, that “science is conditioned by postulates or  by decisions that are generally social, cultural, or historical in na- ture?” How, in other words, can science be “conditioned but uncon- ditional? No one has escaped this dilemma,” Serres admits, certainly  not himself (p. 106). He comes close to resolving the paradox when  he argues that the truth content of science is a necessary but not  sufficient condition to determine the final form of a scientific para- digm. Reality imposes constraints that cause some hypotheses to be  verifiable, others not. But it does not determine which theories are  actually realized or how they will be expressed. These things depend  on cultural and historical conditions peculiar to the moment. With  this lucid insight, Serres has what he needs to open the narrow  straits of his passages into easily traversed terrain. But he does not use it. Instead, the equivocation characteristic of  his writing becomes more intense as it comes closer to potential res- olution. Consider the sentence that contains the essential insight. It  demonstrates in microcosm how intrinsic equivocation is to Serres’s  rhetoric. Musing on how science can be at once local and global, he  writes, “In this case and a thousand like it, you can always proceed  from the product to its conditions, but never from the conditions to  the product” (p. 106). The generalizing impulse is apparent in “al- ways” and “never” ; yet these words are preceded by the equivocal  phrase “in this case and a thousand like it,” which envisions the  global as a mass of localized points, not as a true universal. Equivo- cation is also apparent in the sense of the sentence, which could be  paraphrased as “universals apply, but not always.” To see whether  they apply in a specific case, one has to consider the direction one  travels. If one goes backward through time, one can “always” uni- versalize; if forward, “never.” Into which category does this state- ment fall? Since it spans both directions, it must be both true and  untrue, local and universal, as its rhetoric signals. In other words,  the sentence contains an undecidable proposition. At least since </page> <page sequence="30"> 104 The Figure in the Carpet Russell and Whitehead, we have known how to analyze propositions  of this kind. The sentence is undecidable because it is paradoxical,  and it is paradoxical because it is self-referential.14 To identify the paradox, however, is not to resolve it. The state- ment is unavoidably self-referential, because Serres’s entire project is  caught between going backward in time when he reinscribes differ- ence in classical paradigms and going forward in time as he strives  to create a universal theory of local difference. This divided tempo- ral impulse reflects his divided loyalties toward literature and sci- ence. To speak unequivocally would imply choosing one of these  polarities over the other; and this he cannot do without vacating the  site he has chosen for his project. Thus when he addresses the prob- lem of divided loyalties directly, the prose characteristically becomes  more infolded, for only so can the tensions that define the project’s  site remain intact. Nowhere are these tensions more apparent than in “The Origin  of Language: Biology, Information Theory, and Thermodynamics”  (1982a: 71-83). In this essay Serres tries to expand informational  equivocation into a general theory of language. After reviewing the  second law of thermodynamics, he points out that fighting against  entropie decay is the openness of all living systems— their ability to  take in sunlight, food, information. Since this flow sustains life, he  proposes that we regard ourselves not as stable bodies through  which constantly changing streams of matter and energy flow but as  stable flows encased within constantly changing bodies. Consider an  ocean wave: although the water appears to flow, a typical water  molecule moves only a few feet during its entire lifetime. The shores,  by contrast, are eroding every day. In an elegant reformulation of  Heraclitus, Serres writes, “One always swims in the same river, one  never sits down on the same bank” (p. 74).15 This part of the essay is l4Serres’s views on this matter are very similar to those of Lem, who also positions  himself at an interstice between literature and science. It is no accident that Lem, like  Serres, sometimes opts for a transcendent viewpoint rather than a self-reflexive loop.  His topological model, for example, must of necessity be one of the shapes possible  within postmodern culture. But Lem does not inquire into the conditions of possi- bility that authorize his topological model of culture, preferring to posit it as a tran- scendent concept rather than as a model that models itself. l5Serres may not be quite correct here. It is true that waves in an ocean serve to  transfer energy rather than matter, but I rather think that water molecules in rivers </page> <page sequence="31"> Chaos and Poststructuralism 205 in the retrospective mode, an attempt to insert into traditional para- digms the empirical differences they suppress. Having allowed the voice of difference to speak, Serres then  moves to assimilate it into a general theory of language. His inspira- tion is the article by Henri Atlan (1974) cited in chapter 2, in which  Atlan shows that the value of the equivocation in Shannon’s equa- tions depends upon where the observer is positioned in relation to  the message. If the observer knows what the “correct” message is—  that is, if she is positioned at the message source— the equivocation  will appear as unwanted noise that should be subtracted from the  message’s original information. If the observer is positioned outside  the system, however, she is in a position to notice the effect of the  equivocation on the system as a whole. She thus can see instances in  which the equivocation causes the system to reorganize itself at a  higher level of complexity. In these instances, Atlan argues, the  equivocation should be given a positive sign, for it has in effect be- come information. It is not hard to see why this argument would  appeal to Serres (to say nothing of Barthes, who would find it deli- ciously redundant). Serres correctly sees in Atlan’s article scientific  validation for his view of noise as a positive force. However, he continues to a conclusion found in none of his scien- tific sources. He apparently arrived at it by conflating Atlan’s article  with François Jacob’s speculation (1976) that biological organisms  are structured in interlocking levels of integration, like so many Rus- sian dolls stacked inside one another. If organisms are structured in  hierarchical levels, Serres reasons, then one can conclude that the  value of the equivocation changes with each level, so that each  higher level functions as a “rectifier of noise” for the level beneath  (1982a: 78). If this were so, noise at a lower level would always be  transformed into information at the next higher level, and organisms  would be unified only because they are fragmented— an implication  Serres expands into the paradoxical conclusion that language itself  originates in noise. At this point, his divergence from his scientific sources is clear. do  move. Otherwise, as a colleague pointed out, why would mountain streams run  dry? </page> <page sequence="32"> zo6  The Figure in the Carpet There is no scientific evidence that noise is rectified from level to  level within human beings. Nor do these theories say that noise nec- essarily becomes useful information. Whether noise will have a posi- tive or negative effect on systemic organization depends on the sta- bility of the system, the kind of feedback loops at work, the amount  and kind of noise injected, and when the injection occurs (Atlan,  1974; Jacob, 1973; Nicolis and Prigogine, 1977). Serres’s claim that  the rectification of noise “is valid for all levels” and is a universal  “law of the series” is simply not true. For Serres, however, this conclusion is merely the springboard for  further speculation. He links equivocation with the Freudian uncon- scious, reasoning that if noise can be either positive or negative, then  one can say that “in one case, it covers up; in the other, it ex- presses.” Thus he concludes that the “entire symbolic function is  embedded in this process, the entire strategy of free assocication,  Freudian slips, jokes and puns” (p. 80). As he diverges further from  fact, his rhetoric becomes more insistent that his theory is scientific.  “These matters are straightforward” (p. 78), he claims, alleging that  “we can speak about [a layered unconscious] by using a discourse  which ultimately can be expressed in mathematical terms” (p. 79).  To whom does the “we” in this sentence refer? Not to the sources  Serres cites— Henri Atlan, François Jacob, and Claude Shannon, for  example— or to any other scientist of whom I am aware. If we think about what is happening at this point in Serres’s argu- ment, we can see that he is trying to make the rectification of noise  into a principle that applies equally to language, human psychology,  the universe, everything. The irony is that in transforming equivoca- tion in this way Serres has made it univocal, for it leads always to  increasing order. Thus “rectified,” equivocation is at least as capable  of suppressing difference as any of the Platonic concepts Serres ad- dresses. Projecting this no-longer-equivocal equivocation onto an  imagined scientific “we,” he dreams that it can fuse the deep  shadows of the unconscious with the clear sun of mathematical  equations, just as he dreams that his own discourse is at one with all  other discourses, from Plato to Freud to Shannon. Of course these  dreams are not realities. But they nevertheless represent a culminat- ing vision, as the heightened language signals, for at last the noise of </page> <page sequence="33"> Chaos and Poststructuralism 207 difference has been made to speak the language of unity. Serres  imagines that through his theory we will finally understand the  “packages of chance” that come “crashing at our feet, like the surf  at the edge of the beach, in the forms of eros and death” (p. 80). It is  from this aporia that his theory of the parasite emerges, traversing a  path that can be negotiated only in the equivocal language of  dreams.16 In one sense Serres is a man ahead of his time, for he understands  that the réévaluation of chaos within contemporary paradigms is a  cultural shift of the first importance. It signals not just a new scien- tific or literary theory but a shift in the ground of representation  itself. However, the passage between wacky theorizing and brilliant  insight in his writing is so narrow that it is sometimes hard to say on  which side it falls. It seems most uncontrolled when it takes itself as  subject, that is, when it operates upon the equivocation that is its  abiding subject and underlying dynamic. Then the strain of self-reflexivity, which I noted earlier as an un- dertone, is exaggerated until the prose is caught in the recursive  loops typical of positive feedback, oscillating more and more wildly  between the polarities that define its dialectic, insisting all the while  that this oscillation is really unity. Self-referential paradoxes are, of  course, the stuff of which deconstructive analyses and postmodern  literature are made. Within the context of Serres’s writing, however,  they have the effect of conflating the distinct voices of literature and  science into a cacography of confused claims. This transformation of  equivocation into cacography signals failure, for Serres’s project de- pends upon speaking both the claims of science to represent the  world and the admission of language that it can represent only itself. 16At the end of The Parasite, Serres makes the significant gesture of rejecting the  ocean-born Venus for the ocean itself. The gesture marks a new phase in Serres’s  development, in which he increasingly abandons all forms of order to crawl down   the “manholes” or “bubbles” in the foam to commune with aboriginal chaos. These  aspects of Serres’s more recent work are discussed by Eric White in “Negentropy,  Noise, and Emancipatory Thought” and by Maria Assad in “Michel Serres: In  Search of a Tropography,” both in Chaos and Order: Complex Dynamics in Litera- ture and Science, ed.
