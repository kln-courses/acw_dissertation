<plain_text><page sequence="1">FACTS AND COMMENTS road to enable such authority to determine the likelihood of the highway destroying historical objects. If it should appear that the proposed road construction will result in the destruction of the historical objects and it is determined by the appropriate authority that such objects cannot reasonably be removed or otherwise pre- served, consideration should be given to possible alternate locations of the highway. b. If, during the course of construction, historical objects are encountered, the appropriate authority should be notified immedi- ately and steps taken to excavate and preserve the objects if practic- able, or if preservation is impracticable, to permit the appropriate authority to obtain and record data relative thereto. c. Agreements may be entered into with the appropriate author- ity to pay from Federal highway funds the reasonable costs of salvage work. Extra work orders may be issued to the contractors in this connection, provided the specifications have not required the contractor to cover such work in his unit bid prices. Extra work orders may also be issued in cases within the meaning of "subsurface or latent conditions" or "unknown physical conditions" where such terms are used in the standard contract. Payment for salvage work will be limited to that performed within the roadway prism and any location designated by the Government as a source of material. If a contractor's operations are delayed because of salvage work such contractor would be entitled to an appropriate extension of the contract time. If practicable, the operations should be rescheduled to avoid the section until the removal of the arit- facts or the gathering of historical data has been accomplished by the appropriate authority. 5. Limitation of Expenditures. Cost of exploratory salvage work prior to the start of construction shall be borne by the appro- priate authority. Costs of excavation of historical objects or record- ation of data therefrom, whether performed prior to or during con- struction, may be paid from Federal highway funds. Excavation costs may include costs of protecting and preservation during re- moval at the site but shall not include the expense of shipping historical objects from the site. 6. Federal-Aid Construction. To the extent approved as neces- sary by the State highway department, Federal-Aid funds may be used to reimburse the States on the usual pro rata basis for the cost of salvage work on Federal-Aid projects performed within the genral limitations set forth in paragraphs 4 and 5. C. D. CURTISS Commissioner of Public Roads THE OKLAHOMA ARCHAEOLOGICAL SALVAGE PROJECT The stimulus for the development of the Oklahoma Archaeological Salvage Project came from 3 sources: The LJ.S. Bureau of Public Roads Policy and Procedure Mem- orandum, No. 20-7; the New Mexico Highway Salvage Program; and the Society for American Archaeology's Committee on Highway Salvage Archaeology. Like all programs it was the result of several stages of growth in which a number of individuals participated. At the January, 1956, University of Illinois Archaeo- logical Conference, attended by representatives of institu- tions working in that state, most of the discussion cen- tered about the implications of the then pending Federal Highways Act. The Urbana group later circularized insti- tutions within the central states, among them the Uni- versity of Oklahoma, concerning the results of these discussions and urged recipients of the conference report to secure support for this legislation. The Oklahoma Anthropological Society, through its president Sherman Lawton, followed this suggestion by pointing out the need for this legislation to all the Oklahoma congres- sional representatives. With the passage of the Highways Bill on June 29th and the formation of the S.A.A. Com- mittee on Highway Salvage Archaeology, John C. Mc.- Gregor, who had been appointed regional representative for the central states, again circularized institutions in this area with details of the legislation, its implications for participating states, and a summary of salvage procedures as worked out by Fred Wendorf in New Mexico. Shortly thereafter S. F. Borhegyi, who had recently come to the University of Oklahoma Museum from New Mexico, together with Sherman Lawton, president of the Oklahoma Anthropological Society, contacted the Okla- homa State Highway Department and a memorandum was issued to all department heads and division engineers requesting that if archaeological material was encoun- tered during construction the University Museum be contacted within 24 hours so that salvage operations could be undertaken. In September, 1956, upon his return from a year's sab- batical leave abroad Robert E. Bell, archaeologist in the Department of Anthropology, realized that, under the Oklahoma state antiquity law, which designated the Department of Anthropology as the sole licensing agency for archaeological exploration and excavation, implemen- tation of any highway salvage program would fall within the jurisdiction of the department. An interim program was arranged by Bell with university administrative offi- cials, so that a full time archaeologist could be employed for salvage archaeology. Approval for this program was obtained from the Regents of the University of Oklahoma and the project began October 15 with the appointment of the writer. Officials of the State Highway Department at Okla- homa City were again contacted early in November. These talks with the Chief Engineer, G. H. Bittle, and other department heads, who might be connected with the salvage operation, attempted to establish the type of information needed for archaeological reconnaissance and the methods for obtaining it. It was decided that the Salvage Project should be put on the mailing list of the Highway Department's Weekly Report of Survey Opera- tions. This report lists road surveys currently being con- ducted, their location by county and highway number, the name of the nearest community, the approximate total mileage, and the percentage of the survey complete as of the date of the report. It was felt at this time that the survey report would provide a basis for highway pro- ject elimination when the data in the weekly report was compared with the archaeological survey maps which had been developed in the Anthropology Department over a period of years. It was also suggested that aerial mosaic blueprints of these surveyed areas would give further aid during the actual archaeological survey of the selected projects. The Salvage Project would also be provided with the regular monthly reports showing the construc- tion status on all highway projects as well as a set of county maps and, if necessary, the monthly notice of awards and contract lettings. 79</page><page sequence="2">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY However, in attempting to work from these data it soon became apparent that the weekly survey report failed to show certain data essential to the efficient opera- tion of the salvage project. For instance, it was not pos- sible to determine which of the many right-of-way surveys were federal-aid projects, nor was the type of construc- tion indicated. Obviously, if these 2 facts were known, many grading, resurfacing, or minor drainage projects could be immediately eliminated from the archaeological reconnaisance. In fact, many of the surveys listed are provisional and final approval is not always obtained. It soon became apparent during this initial trial period that the main problem, from the archaeological standpoint, was the difficulty of evaluating and selecting intelligently from among the numerous state highway construction projects. In the meantime the District Engineer of the Bureau of Public Roads, E. H. Swick, was contacted. During conversations with him, it was suggested that since all projects involving federal funds channeled through his office, it would be more effective for his office to coordi- nate the data necessary from the State Highway Depart- ment, the federal government, and private contractors. The inclusion of this latter group was especially welcome as many contractors are involved and more than one firm might be employed for a given stretch of road. It was also decided to concentrate on highway projects approved by the Bureau of Public Roads during the initial stages of the salvage project. Only after this backlog was elimi- nated would proposed surveys be included. Nor would secondary county federal-aid roads be considered at this time as they are usually section-line roads involving grading or resurfacing with little relocation of the right- of-way. Following this agreement an initial survey was se- lected, a 4 mile stretch of interstate highway near the Kansas border. Since this contract was to be let within a few weeks, it could be regarded as a pilot project and any "bugs" which might appear could be eliminated from the salvage procedure. Unfortunately the right-of- way ran along high ground at a considerable distance from the main drainages and appeared to be an unlikely site location. So it proved. Nevertheless some experience was gained from the preliminary road survey. The construction involved a 300-foot right-of-way across 3 section-line roads which separated a series of cultivated and uncultivated fields. Despite the use of an aerial mosaic blueprint considerable difficulty was en- countered in following the right-of-way. This difficulty resulted from the plowing up of some stakes and others being lost in the grass of the uncultivated fields. Since the actual plotting of a site under such circumstances might involve revisiting the location and the consequent hundreds of miles of driving, it was decided that where possible the archaeological survey should immediately follow the final, rather than the preliminary, survey of the contracting engineers. Of course, in many cases this will be impossible because of time schedules. Neverthe- less, where feasible it will save time, not only in the establishment of precise locations of sites in reference to marked center stakes but it will eliminate time lost by efforts to keep properly oriented. The next 2 highway surveys were selected again on the basis of letting priority and involved stretches of roadway which had been finally surveyed and staked out at 50-foot intervals on the state standard 120-foot right-of-way. The state highway plan and profile maps make it possible to accurately locate any site found at this stage. To date none has been located although several areas of possible occupation have been noted. These suspect areas were marked on the survey map which accompanies the report of the completed survey submitted to the District Engi- neer's office. The latter will then ask the state's resident engineer to notify the Bureau office when the sections in question will come under construction. Some such pro- cedure is necessary since' a small contractor will often give priority to certain sections of road, these priorities being influenced by traffic, drainage, terrain, and special difficulties encountered. Therefore, it is not possible to designate these sections before construction begins. Like- wise, it is possible that borrow pits for road material may be shifted during construction. In these cases the Salvage Project must depend upon the office of the Bureau of Public Roads for information. And in the excavation stage there are a number of details of procedure which will have to be worked out as the project develops. Recently the Bureau of Public Roads has compiled copies of the program sheets representing all state high- ways which are to be constructed involving federal funds and those projects for which plans are in the Bureau's office have been indicated. These involve 20 projects and some 90 miles of highway. There are an additional 26 proposed projects on file for later investigation. Of these 40 miles are primary roads pending final approval by the Bureau of Public Roads and 85 miles are secondary roads not yet advanced to construction. This is a total of 190 miles of federal aid roads to be surveyed or eliminated. It is hoped that once this backlog of previous program- ming has been surveyed it will be possible to keep archae- ological reconnaissance up with the 200 to 300 miles of federal-aid highways which are constructed annually in Oklahoma. Thus far 4 projects and some 20 miles of roadway have been surveyed. It might not be amiss here to mention salvage opera- tions which have been or are being undertaken in fields other than highway salvage. The Oklahoma Archaeologi- cal Salvage Project, while primarily concerned with high- way salvage, does not exclude other projects if an emer- gency arises. During the first few months of the project's operation and pending the development of highway sal- vage procedures one pipeline salvage operation was con- ducted and negotiations undertaken with the Department of the Navy, the National Park Service, and several cor- porations. The first operation was the excavation of an Indian cemetery on the eastern outskirts of Oklahoma City from which 16 burials and some Spiro-type artifacts were re- moved. The finds were reported by the alert operator of a mechanical ditcher laying pipe for an oil company 80 [ XXIII, 1, 1957</page><page sequence="3">FACTS AND COMMENTS near the North Canadian River. Suffice it to say that this information could not have been recovered because of teaching committments by other members of the Anthro- pology Department had not someone been available dur- ing the academic year for salvage archaeology. A second salvage operation was brought to our atten- tion by the membership of the Oklahoma Anthropologi- cal Society at Muskogee, Oklahoma, which is some 160 miles east of Oklahoma City near the Arkansas border. Here a recent industrial drive has brought several eastern firms into the area to build plants along the Arkansas River. Preliminary surveys on both properties in question showed sites which might be related in some way to the Hughes Mound nearby which had been previously exca- vated by the W.P.A. Negotiations were begun with both companies for excavation permits and, if possible, for financial support. Unfortunately, by the time the various officials in one of the companies had been contacted, plant construction was under way and investigation showed that the old village site had been scooped up by earth movers in leveling the plant site. In the other case it developed that the company was leasing the property from a government agency which was the actual owner. Several months of communication were required to obtain permission to excavate these sites prior to con- struction. The National Park Service was in this case able to support limited archaeological salvage work on the federal lands. Both of these cases demonstrate that sufficient time, at least several months, must be allowed for negotiations with large corporations or the federal government where salvage operations are contemplated, especially if jurisdiction is not in the state. These experiences in highway salvage archaeology are presented not as models, but as examples of some of the initial problems involved in establishing a salvage pro- gram under the Federal Highways Act in one state. Dur- ing the Central States Archaeological Conference at Urbana, Illinois, in October, 1956, it was pointed out that every state differs in highway programming procedures, since different political institutions control the highway and archaeological aspects and there are various areas of responsibility for the preservation of state antiquities. Consequently, it seems unlikely that a single nation-wide procedure can eventuate for highway salvage archae- ology. In fact, there appears to be some doubt as to whether in all states the pattern of highway location will coincide sufficiently with the prehistoric settlment pat- terns to justify a salvage program of the preceding type. To date it would seem that the effectiveness of the ar- chaeological salvage programs under the Federal High- ways Act will depend upon 3 factors: (1) centralization of the state's archaeological resources and responsibility for those resources in one institution and/or individual (this of course does not preclude delegation of that authority); (2) channeling federal highway programming and construction data for the salvage archaeologist through the local office of the Bureau of Public Roads; and (3) cooperation of the general type and to the extent which exists between the salvage archaeologist and the State Highway Department and the Bureau of Public Roads in Oklahoma. It will probably take some time to establish the worth of an archaeological highway salvage program in any given state. For while surface surveys may not at first develop much evidence, as in Oklahoma, later construc- tion may reveal subsurface evidence. The time between these first surveys and the construction date may be several years. The next 2 or 3 years will therefore be the test period for the nation-wide salvage program. JAMES B. SHAEFFER University of Oklahoma Norman, Okla. March, 1957 UNFIRED CLAY OBJECTS FROM WATERFALL RUIN, NORTHEASTERN ARIZONA Waterfall Ruin (N.A. 2676), a cave ruin in the Chin- lee Valley about 12 miles south of Poncho House, has been briefly described by Guernsey (1931: 32-6) and was the subject of further excavation by Peabody Museum parties led by Oliver La Farge in 1924 and by the senior author in 1933. A number of modeled clay objects ob- tained in 1933 are of interest as tending to bridge the gap between the Basketmaker III clay complex and certain later manifestations. The earliest structures at the site are Basketmaker III. The main occupation, characterized by continuous building and rebuilding, was in Pueblo I to early Pueblo II, the pottery being predominantly Dead- man's Black-on-red and Kana-a Gray and Black-on-white, with some Black Mesa Black-on-white and all-over corru- gated ware. Although a few later sherds occur and the stratification in which clay objects were encountered was in large part much disturbed, it is unlikely that any of them are later than the 10th century. Basketmaker III Figurines. Two small anthropomorphic figurines (not illustrated) were associated with the earli- est structures and can be confidently assigned to Basket- maker III on typological grounds. One is represented by the head and upper portion of the shoulder region, while the other is a female figurine complete except for the head. Both bear typical Basketmaker III punctate decora- tion. Babes and Cradles. The babe-in-cradle, Figure 1 a, came from fill in a storage bin which also contained Kana-a Black-on-white and sherds of all-over corrugated ware. The flat cradle, 31/8 by 5/8 by -36 inches, has a hood composed of a flat strip of clay protruding at right angles from the upper rim of the cradle to a height of /V inch. The lower ends of the hood curve in and serve to hold in place the readily removable babe, a flat, spatulate piece of clay 1-l6 inch in length. There is no indication that the babe was bonded or tied to the cradle. Lacking even the crude nose ridge characteristic of later examples in the area, the babe would hardly be recognizable as anthropomorphic if it had not been found with the cradle. Other similar specimens include 2 babes (1 81</page></plain_text>
