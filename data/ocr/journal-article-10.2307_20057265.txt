<plain_text><page sequence="1">Women, Subjectivity, and the Rhetoric of Anti-Humanism in Feminist Film Theory Deborah Knight Feminist film theory has a history, one that is intertwined with the history of what we might call non-feminist or a-feminist film theory (and literary theory, cultural theory, political theory, criti cal theory, psychoanalytic theory, to name a few). Feminist film theory, like other theories, has a history because it is a practice, undertaken for specifiable reasons by individuals and collectives in particular institu tional as well as intellectual contexts, employing recognizable rhetorical strategies and routines.1 The objectives that motivate feminist theory can be expressed quite directly, as Toril Moi has done in her Sexual/Textual Politics: "The principal objective of feminist criticism has always been political: it seeks to expose, not to perpetuate, patriarchal practices."21 will leave aside this statement's apparent ahistoricism (uhas always been). What I want to emphasize is the element of practice involved, the idea that there are particular goals that motivate feminist theory and criti cism, and that in the main these are self-consciously acknowledged goals?goals shared by and recognized by those who engage in this sort of theoretical and critical activity, goals which are, as Moi remarks, political What feminist theory and feminist film theory have long recognized is their asymmetrical relationship to the sorts of theory and film theory that do not adopt the modifier feminist. The use of the modifier feminist signals the self-consciously political commitment to theory as practice. The problem, if it is a problem, is that there is theory, and then there is the work that is conducted by feminist critics and theorists. Conceived of in terms of asymmetry, theory (without the modifier) might be taken to be the privileged, central term, and feminist theory the disadvantaged, decentered term?the term which depends, for its definition, on the former. Indeed, feminist theory would in this sense be asymmetrically dependent upon theory, since the interventions of feminist theory are, in general, interventions in the language of, interventions within the broader critical frameworks of, theory. This asymmetry between theory and feminist theory might be seen to mimic or reproduce the sociological and political construction of the relationship between women and New Literary History, 1995, 26: 39-56</page><page sequence="2">40 NEW LITERARY HISTORY patriarchy, women in but marginalized by patriarchy, since the presuppo sition from which feminist theory works?and which Moi makes per fectly clear?is that women are comparatively disadvantaged in and by a patriarchal culture. Women's position in patriarchy is asymmetrical and dependent, on this view. But where the point of feminist intervention is to change the sexual, textual, and political structures that marginalize and disadvantage women as individuals and as groups, there is a potential paradox in our using, in our having to use, a theory that is so closely tied, so genealogically connected to, the very theory that seems to speak and authorize the marginalization that is being contested. Some of feminist film theory's longest-standing directive ideas have emerged from the effort to negotiate a position for women within theory, or at least to make a space for the theorizing of women?and this in two senses. There has been the need to make space for the theorizing of images or representations of women, as well as for the theorizing of women as subjects and spectators. There has also been the need to make space for the theorizing undertaken by and conducted by feminists for the sorts of reasons suggested above. The former involves theory "proper," while the latter concerns the space of theoretical and critical praxis. The examination of the representation of women in cinema, the idea that "woman" is a sign, the question whether there is such a thing as women's desire, or a feminine language, or a subject-position for women as cinema spectators?these and other topics in the history of feminist film theory have tended to emerge as responses to theory, or to conceptualizations of desire, language, spectatorship, subjectivity, and signification which are seen to be patriarchal, phallocentric, and/or phallocratie. The recognition of the need to address and to redress the asymmetry and the dependence on some prior unmodified version of theory has been a motivating factor in these and related investigations by feminist theorists. But the institutional, academic, intellectual, conceptual, and genea logical connections between theory and feminist film theory have caused the latter to inherit, sometimes quite uncritically, assumptions that arguably should have been seen to be problematic in the former, and to give those assumptions an even greater authority than they had origi nally by transposing them into a feminist context. Feminist film theory contributes to the normalization of sets of ideas which, I want to suggest, are themselves part of the problem that feminist film theory should be and could be addressing. By perpetuating sets of ideas that are normal ized in theory, from which feminist film theory has taken them, and by redeploying them in its own work, feminist film theory inadvertently risks finding itself in a situation where by its own efforts it has</page><page sequence="3">ANTI-HUMANISM IN FEMINIST FILM THEORY 41 legitimated and sustained theoretical models and concepts that perpetu ate the asymmetry which is at issue. My objective is to examine the interrelations of certain concepts that are central to theory and to feminist film theory. The particular problem I address here is the problem?or at least the alleged problem?of women as subjects, the problem of women and subjectivity. I will not be engaged in an examination of the investment by feminist film theory in a psychoanalytic explanatory paradigm, whether Lacanian or Freudian. Much work has already been done in that area. My project, is, neverthe less, an explicitly theoretical one. Like Joan Copjec, who wrote this in an issue of Camera Obscura devoted to the topic of the female spectator (the "spectatrix"), I "believfe] that concepts, like films, can only be under stood through a knowledge of their history."8 Theory is, it would seem to me, knowledge of the history of the use of key concepts. At the conclusion of this article I will suggest that this conception of theory dissolves the problem of asymmetrical dependence. The alleged problem of female subjectivity is one I want to propose as a paradigmatic example of how a belief in theoretical asymmetry perpetuates, by means of theoretical practice, problems that theory exists to resolve, and can resolve. To do this, I want to situate my discussion in a broader context. I want to look at a whole conceptual framework that feminist film theory, and indeed feminist theory gener ally, has appropriated from theory. The conceptual framework I have in mind is anti-humanism. I want to begin by discussing anti-humanism because it will help us to see how to go about resolving, or possibly even dissolving, the "problem" of women and subjectivity. Anti-humanism is part of theory s rejection of a group of values associated with a particular conception of agency and meaning?the values of (or the values attributed to) an allegedly outdated humanism. The anti-humanist paradigm has its acknowledged roots in the work of Nietzsche, Freud, and Marx, and it is possible to trace its influence, especially in France, through the philosophical, literary, and political writings of Koj?ve and Bataille, some camps of phenomenology and existentialism, and of course in the more recent?and unquestionably more immediately influential?work of Lacan, Barthes, Derrida, Fou cault, and others. The critical movements called poststructuralism and deconstruction are closely linked to anti-humanism. Anti-humanism enters feminist film theory and feminist theory in general through the portal of poststructuralism. Rosalind Krauss, for example, defends the general project of poststructuralism in her paper, "Using Language to Do Business as Usual," when she speaks in support</page><page sequence="4">42 NEW LITERARY HISTORY of the "radical decentering of the human subject" which poststructuralism offered as its diagnosis of, and antidote to the (allegedly) dominant conceptions of agency and meaning from at least Descartes to the present. The positive valuation of the "radically decentered subject" is part of Krauss's defence of anti-humanism against humanism.4 Krauss accounts for the move from humanism to anti-humanism by noting that "the basis for [the] massive disciplinary shift [associated with structuralism and later with poststructuralism was] the decision that the unit of social meaning?the sign?would henceforth be the object of study, the goal of which would be to understand the operations of the sign both within the larger structures that generate the rules through which meaning is constructed and, at a microlevel of analysis, within the system of a sign's production through the material logic of the relations between signifiers" (VT 79-80). The object of study would no longer be anthropomorphic: it would not be the person, the subject, the individual, the family, the collective, the nation. Rather, the object of study would be signs and rule-governed systems that generate meanings and produce social and political effects. Language and other semiotic systems would be the central objects of analysis; and agents would be displaced (agents would be shown to have been always already displaced) as effects of those semiotic systems. Little wonder, then, that feminist theory, in its adoption of poststructuralism, took the short but obvious step to select "woman" as sign and signifier, and thus undertook the examination of the operations of this sign which is and is not woman, or which, in scare quotes, is "woman." Poststructuralist theory turned woman into a sign (turned woman into "woman"), susceptible to semiological analysis, and as a sign, "woman" was treated as having a "language-relative status."5 "Woman" named no sort of referent; it was a signifier, whose meaning (or meaning-effect) was said to be produced discursively. Mary Ann Doane and Teresa de Lauretis, among others, have argued that "woman" exists (as Doane has written) "nowhere but as an effect of discourse," that "woman" is (as de Lauretis has it) a "fictional construct, a distillate from diverse but congruent discourses dominant in Western culture."6 Semiology made signs central and began to conceptualize subjectivity in terms of?and as?the effect of signs; feminist semiology made "woman" a sign, and proceeded to investigate her marginality as subject. The move from sign to subject is one shared by theory and by feminist film theory, as the title of chapter 1 of Kaja Silverman's The Subject of Semiotics makes clear ("From Sign to Subject, A Short History"); what to make of "woman" as sign or as subject is one challenge for feminist theory.7 Krauss's summation of the poststructuralist project is a farniliar one. Krauss's proactive stance vis-?-vis anti-humanism?what we might call her pro-anti-humanism?connects her enthusiastic acceptance of the</page><page sequence="5">ANTI-HUMANISM IN FEMINIST FILM THEORY 43 much publicized decentering of the subject which is the hallmark of anti-humanist thought to a repudiation, rejection, or refusal of the subject of humanism. Anti-humanists like Krauss claim the humanist subject is a concatenation of much that is seen, by them, to be politically and morally repugnant. When feminist theory goes anti-humanist, it is little wonder that it devotes a great deal of critical attention to the humanist subject, because anti-humanist feminist theory wants to distin guish its view of subjectivity from this unpalatable humanist subjectivity. It is also little wonder that anti-humanist feminist theory characterizes the humanist subject as male (masculine, phallic, and so forth). What are the characteristics of the humanist subject that the anti humanists reject so strongly? For Krauss, humanism is equated to "the idea of an autonomous subject, an agent who is in control of his meanings, his intentions, his representations, his desires; a moral subject, a voluntaristic subject, a subject inaugurated in relation to his desire for freedom" (VT80). And Krauss is scarcely alone as a feminist anti-humanist in characterizing the humanist subject in terms of its masculine gender, its autonomy, its control over meanings, desires, intentions, and volitions. Comparable descriptions fairly jump off the pages of feminist theory. Here, for instance, is Toril Moi describing the subject of "traditional humanism" in the vocabulary of anti-humanist feminist theorists Irigaray and Cixous. The humanist subject at the center of patriarchal ideology, Moi contends, is a "seamlessly unified self ... a phallic self, constructed on the model of the self-contained, powerful phallus. Gloriously autonomous, it banishes from itself all conflict, contradiction and ambiguity." Moi goes on to insist that, "In this humanist ideology the self is the sole author of history and of the literary text: the humanist creator is potent, phallic and male?God in relation to his world, the author in relation to his text" (STPS). I will, as I have indicated, have more to say about subjectivity, and thus about this extraordinary opposition between the humanist and the anti humanist subject. But what wants emphasizing before I go on is the group of ideas that circulate around each term of this opposition between humanism and anti-humanism. Humanism is the negative term of this pair, and anti-humanism the positive term. On some views, the humanist is seen to be Anglo-American (Krauss, for one, thinks so), while the anti-humanist is French (where "Anglo-American" and "French" are intended to designate "the intellectual tradition" within which the critic works [STP xiv].) This Anglo-American/French split holds for theory as well as for feminist theory, where the anti-humanists par excellence include Lacan, Barthes, Foucault, and Derrida, and the feminist anti-humanists par excellence are generally grouped together as contributors to the New French Feminism(s) (though they haven't exactly been "new" for some time).</page><page sequence="6">44 NEW LITERARY HISTORY If the terms "Anglo-American" and "French" name intellectual tradi tions, then how are these traditions characterized? Oddly, one of the criticisms raised by the anti-humanists against the humanists is that humanists are said to be traditional; anti-humanists tend to represent themselves as being anti-traditional This paradoxical way of putting things is conveniently silent about the tradition of thought that leads from Nietzsche, Freud, and Heidegger to Lacan, Barthes, Foucault, and Derrida. The force of the criticism seems to have to do with the humanists's defence of the tradition within which he or she works, as well as its values. Again there is a convenient silence, for the anti-humanist introduces a new set of values to be defended while in the process of critiquing the humanist's. The tradition that the anti-humanist opposes is the humanist's tradition, thus deflecting some attention from the process by which an anti-humanist tradition is constructed. A thumbnail sketch of the humanist and the anti-humanist would suggest a dramatic and diametric opposition. The sketch of the human ist is a caricature produced by the anti-humanist critique of humanism, and even the anti-humanist occasionally reaches the point of self caricature. It is no part of my intention to caricature the opposition; what interests me is how the opposition between humanist and anti humanist caricatures itself. The humanist, when not simply described as an empiricist, is said to work from sociological motivations, while the anti-humanist is seen to be a psychoanalytically inclined textualist. The work of the humanist is criticized for being ahistorical, or for assuming values which, the anti humanist argues, the humanist treats as universal or ahistorical. Just as often, the humanist is said to be caught up in purveying metanarratives, including historical ones. The anti-humanist undertakes to write history differently and to show how it is possible to move past metanarratives, including historical metanarratives conceived as coherent, linear, and ideological stories that show how the present has been produced, as it were, inevitably, from a sequence of events from the past that could have led nowhere else but here, to our present. The humanist is thought to prefer realist representational practices, coherent character psychology, linear-causal plot structures; the humanist is said to prefer fictions that mimetically reproduce or mirror the conditions of the social world. The anti-humanist is a modernist (and a postmodernist, and more recently, a postcolonialist), valuing antimimetic and/or avant-garde representa tions, fragmentary or divided or alienated or ex-centric characters, and plots that depart from the linear-causal in various ways (openendedness, plot incidents connected by chance rather than by causal logic, multiple layers, self-consciousness about their status as literary or fictional, and so on). In criticism, the standard opposition is between New Criticism and</page><page sequence="7">ANTI-HUMANISM IN FEMINIST FILM THEORY 45 Brecht, though Luk?cs and Auerbach occasionally get lumped in with the realists and therefore with the Anglo-American traditionalists. And, predictably, the humanist is seen to be ethnocentric, heterosexist, and imperialist, while the anti-humanist is aware of differences of ethnicity, sexuality, class, and power. The more general humanist/anti-humanist opposition can be seen at work in feminist theory and criticism. A recent article by Sandra M. Gilbert and Susan Gubar, entitled "The Mirror and the Vamp: Reflec tions on Feminist Criticism" (an article dedicated to M. H. Abrams), traces the "split" between Anglo-American, sociologically driven, "mir ror" criticism and French textually driven "vamp" criticism while at tempting to show that the split in this case is not one of absolute opposition but rather allows for a "paradoxical union of opposites."8 Gilbert and Gubar's story of mirror and vamp criticism is tremendously interesting in the way it shows the humanist/anti-humanist opposition at work in feminist criticism. Gilbert and Gubar's desire to reunite the two extremes is political: it stems from the objective to preserve the political consequences of feminist critical practice. How Gilbert and Gubar overcome or move beyond the opposition between mirror critics and vamp critics will suggest how to overcome or move beyond the anti humanism/humanism opposition in general. Two significant points emerge from their paper. One is that the keywords used to distinguish between mirror critics and vamp critics are tremendously important in the perpetuation of an apparently unrelent ing polarity between the two positions?though I must emphasize the wonderful self-consciousness about language that Gilbert and Gubar demonstrate as they describe the two groups. Mirror critics are seen to be both "decorous and rational," as well as "more law-abiding" than their vamp sisters (157). Mirror critics work within a conceptual framework and institutional structure "signified by such words as author,' 'history,' 'canon,' 'genre,' 'nationality,' 'class,' and 'race'" (147). Moreover, the mirror critic believes that "the meaning of meaning, while it may be complex, multiple, or even contradictory, is and must be decipherable" (147). If it were not decipherable, then the mirror critic's project would no longer be a practical, political one. The vamp critic, on the other hand, "acts out the desire for apocalyptic revolution against law and order" (157), she is "hortatory and visionary, elaborating Utopian imaginings of the future rather than documenting analyses of a dystopic past. Frankly ex-centric, she works outside established structures, refus ing to accept what she sees as the hegemonic categories represented by the words 'author,' 'history,' 'canon,' 'genre,' 'nationality,' 'class,' and 'race.' For her, the meaning of meaning is 'always already' fictive and any attempt to decipher the boundless indeterminacy of language</page><page sequence="8">46 NEW LITERARY HISTORY necessarily replicates and is complicitous with patriarchal modes of control" (153). These descriptions are intentionally playfully but splendidly accurate. We see that notions such as "rationality" and "law" are negatively valued by the vamps, whose chosen positive terms are a cluster including "desire" and "indeterminacy" and "ex-centricity." And this investigation of how operative keywords are deployed leads to the second important point in Gilbert and Gubar's article, a point which is just as pertinent with respect to anti-humanists in general as it is with respect to the vamps. It is that vamp critics, like many of their anti-humanist forebears (I am thinking of Bataille and Barthes here), are in the technical sense latter-day Romantics. Romantic themes?such as the tension between reason and desire, between social order and nature, between the repressive capabilities of law and language on the one hand and the spontaneity of intuition and the immediacy of response and feeling on the other?reappear in vamp criticism and in anti-humanist criticism. Gilbert and Gubar note that the anti-humanists' historical antecedents include Coleridge and Wordsworth, and I would add that Blake's poetry already employed ideas that later came to be recast as the Lacanian Imaginary and Symbolic. So the vamp critic, the one who claims to have cut ties with "the tradition" and with "authorship," should after all be located in "a tradition of authors but [moreover] in a tradition of authorial authority based on the assertive subjectivity of the speaking subject" (155)?the very thing that anti-humanists and vamps represent themselves as rejecting. What we should recognize is that while vamps, like anti-humanists in general, may say that their speech is nothing but the free play of signifiers, reflection on the history of their critical and theoretical practice?including its acknowledged and its unacknowl edged genealogies?suggests that authority and authorship are just as certainly present here as they were in the humanist tradition. And though authority and authorship are conceived differently by the anti humanists than by the humanists (or so they would claim), in both cases subjectivity is central. What should be clear from Gilbert and Gubar's argument is that vamp criticism, like anti-humanist criticism, is a style, with its own history and its own authorizing texts, authors, and critical tropes. The extremes of the opposition between humanist and anti-humanist which I sketched above should suggest that there is something the matter with the way the whole problem has been conceptualized. In the case of feminist criticism, Gilbert and Gubar want to effect a reunion to preserve the political impetus of the feminist project; in the more general case, I argue for an abandonment of the opposition. It seems improbable that</page><page sequence="9">ANTI-HUMANISM IN FEMINIST FILM THEORY 47 the only positions available are either the old, unfashionable humanist position or the new and more recently fashionable radically decentered anti-humanist position. And this is a problem that must be confronted by feminist theory and by feminist film theory, because if the general terms of the debate are badly formulated, then conclusions drawn from them will be skewed as well. As the debate stands, it would seem that you are either with us or you are against us. If you are with us, then you will reject any notion of a unified, coherent, intentional subject. If you argue for a unified, coherent, intentional subject, then you are against us. The humanist/anti-humanist problematic is one of the general theo retical and rhetorical frameworks within which the question of women's subjectivity has arisen in feminist film theoretical writings since at least the publication of Laura Mulvey's "Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cin ema" in 1975.9 The humanist/anti-humanist framework trades on a series of remarkably overblown, virtually caricatured, binary opposi tions. Taking a cue from Nietzsche, Derrida has argued10 that binary oppositions impute positive and negative values to their two terms, and has also shown how a sequence of binary oppositions comes together to describe a conceptual field in such a way that all the positively valued terms support one another, as, similarly, do all the negatively valued terms.11 As Derrida recognizes, the importance of this recognition lies in the initial hope that a simple inversion of the oppositional terms may have positive political consequences, or positive results for theory, at least positive heuristic results for criticism and analysis. This initial hope explains the state of affairs I have described, in which the formerly positive term, humanism, has been overturned and replaced by the formerly negative term, anti-humanism. But we should not consider this reversal anything like a Nietzschean revaluing of all values, since the evaluative principle itself, built straight into the binarisms which struc ture the debate, has not been challenged, and so the inevitable conclusions inevitably follow: one set of terms, formerly the terms associated with humanism, now the terms associated with anti-human ism, are held up as correct, progressive, politically efficacious, or what have you. The problem of the binary structure itself is thus never addressed, and so theorists, and feminist theorists adopting this frame work, adopt a conceptual field that is already constructed, where particular cases are already prejudged. As Stephen Heath remarked years ago about psychoanalytically informed feminist film theory, one of the problems was the tendency to come back with the same old images, re-presented under a more politically progressive descriptive vocabu lary.12 This risk has not abated for those who remain within the either/ or logic of the humanist/anti-humanist opposition.</page><page sequence="10">48 NEW LITERARY HISTORY At this point, I want to return to the questions of subjectivity and of female subjectivity. Let us recall how the humanist/anti-humanist oppo sition characterized the subject. The humanist subject, on most descrip tions, is said to have many of the following attributes: it is singular, rational, unified, centered, autonomous, self-willed, homogeneous, moral, powerful, and, predictably, phallic. This subject, we are told, speaks univocally because he is in full possession of his meanings, intentions, and desires. In the literature he is often described as a Cartesian subject He is, thus, subject in some strong sense of the term, and in virtue of his self-willing autonomy refuses ambiguity, contradiction, doubt. The anti-humanist subject manifests characteristics that are opposed to those which we find attributed to the humanist subject. Perhaps most familiar is the idea that the anti-humanist subject is an anti-Cartesian or a post-Cartesian subject, though as Allan Casebier remarks, since the Cartesian conception of subjectivity "has been regarded as unsatisfactory . . . from the seventeenth century to the present ... to make the observation about having gone beyond Descartes seems unnecessary to mention" (FP 99). Yet it is regularly mentioned. Kaja Silverman, for one, mentions it, and in so doing provides a marvelous example of the humanist/anti-humanist opposition I have been describing. In The Subject of Semiotics, Silverman "refutes" Descartes, the paradigm human ist, with Foucault, the paradigm anti-humanist. She goes on to describe the Cartesian subject as one which has (mistakenly, on Silverman's poststructuralist account?or perhaps even delusionally) discovered itself as "a stable point of authorial origin" (SS 129). Silverman's remark connecting the originary authority of the phallic subject and authorship of course echoes Toril Moi's observations, quoted above, associating humanist, phallic subjectivity with the act of creation of both art and history. Now it is one thing to map a view of the humanist subject onto other views about artistic production and historiography. Obviously feminist theorists will be inclined to remark upon the marginalization of women as producers of art and subjects of historiographie writing and will furthermore be inclined to want to show how this is tied to a patriarchal culture in which a certain model of subjectivity predominates?a model which excludes or decenters women. But it is quite another thing, it seems to me, to want to argue that this view of subjectivity is anything other than a model, a metaphor, a symptomatic sketch of tendencies and possible attributes. Indeed, the humanist, phallic subject is a concatenation of terms brought together because they are now seen to be the source and cause of the power imbalance of a society defined as patriarchal (ethnocentric, heterosexist, and so on). But this scarcely means that the debate has produced a view of subjectivity, or artistic</page><page sequence="11">ANTI-HUMANISM IN FEMINIST FILM THEORY 49 production, or historiographie representation (or for that matter artistic representation) that is anything but the consequence of the terms, valued positively and negatively, that were already deployed across the analytical framework in familiar binary oppositions. From the perspec tive of the anti-humanist framework, any suggestion that the subject may after all be unified, coherent, and in some kind of privileged relation ship to his or her meanings, desires, and intentions is to have missed the point?is to be arguing for the side that on anti-humanist terms has already been shown to be oppressively false or, in a word, humanist. So on the face of it, to want to argue for a conception of agency and subjectivity that is not radically decentered from itself would seem to be something of a scandal. It would, I suggest, be doubly a scandal to be a feminist theorist wanting to argue for such a conception of agency and subjectivity. The old asymmetry again. To do this would appear to involve nothing other than to be working, as Krauss damningly puts it, "in the service of the old humanist subject, with all his meanings and intentions carefully intact" (VT80; my emphasis). Now my objective is not to work in the service of this phallic subject?who may well never have existed except as the by-product of anti-humanist theory. Yet I do want to argue for a subject which is unified, coherent, and intentional, not only because I think this view is the right one, but because I think it goes a long way to dissolving the otherwise tremendously troubling idea that women aren 't subjects, or worse, that women are only subjects by virtue of speaking or looking from the phallic position. The kind of unity, coherence, and intentionality in question is what needs elaboration. In order to advance an argument for a unified, coherent, and intentional subject, it is necessary to step out of the humanist/anti-humanist frame work, to get free from the reductive binary logic of that opposition. I should perhaps confess that I am bothered by feminist film theory's contention that there is a problem about woman as subject, about woman as sign. One of the reasons that female subjectivity has been in question is as a consequence of the remarkable centrality accorded to the psychoanalytic (and especially Lacanian) dimension of poststruc turalist thought. Feminist theorists' dissatisfaction with the implications of having to theorize their own subjectivity in terms of the phallus as dominant metaphor and as symbol of lack, desire, and power has been explored in detail in the literature. Certainly in the study of the cinema, one cannot go far without bumping into references to Mulvey, but it is equally apparent that psychoanalytically influenced feminist film theory has recently been engaged in a critical reassessment of the main arguments set forth in "Visual Pleasure"?and Mulvey herself is a participant in this reassessment. The privilege given to Lacanian psycho analysis in poststructuralist film theory generally, and therefore, almost</page><page sequence="12">50 NEW LITERARY HISTORY inevitably, in poststructuralist feminist film theory, has two primary causes: one, that so many of the concepts and so much of the vocabulary found in Lacan were also in use in Barthes, Derrida, Kristeva?these concepts became normalized because they were, for that period of theoretical work, ubiquitous. The second cause is the nature of cin ematic representation as primarily visual, as involving a relationship which privileges sight. The semiological side of poststructuralism gave theorists the idea that the represented woman is a sign, and that the actual woman spectator is an effect of her engagement (both psychoana lytic and semiological engagement) with that image or sign. The favored way of theorizing this relationship was in terms of the difficulty or the impossibility of there being a subject-position for women spectators. If on the psychoanalytic view the imaged woman is the object of the male gaze, then what becomes of the female spectator as subject? As Linda Nochlin, citing Mulvey, observes about the (at least superficially) paral lel case of the female nude: "there are two choices open to the woman spectator: either to take up the position of the male or to accept the position of male-created seductive passivity and the questionable plea sure of masochism?lack of power to the nth degree."13 Again, two unacceptable choices, both asymmetrically dependent upon a prior term that is, inevitably, phallic. Which is why one line of feminist thought has courted the criticism of being "humanist" or "essentialist" (neither criticism being accurate, in fact) by wanting to propose that neither the humanist nor the anti-humanist conception of subjectivity will do, neither is defensible, neither squares with our experiences as filmmakers, writers, critics, teachers, spectators?our experiences as women. What some feminist film theorists, and feminist theorists generally, have realized over the last fifteen years, by testing our theoretical explanations against our experiences and our self-conscious ness as gendered persons in specific sociohistorical contexts, within particular economic and institutional structures, is that both humanist and anti-humanist models of the subject are artifacts of theory?artifacts of a particular period in the history of film theory, artifacts of a particular conjunction of interests and talents, artifacts of a critical framework and descriptive vocabulary that is available for investigation and reassessment. Nor, I think, can the anti-humanist defend the "radically decentered subject" by appealing to a principled distinction that can be drawn between the theoretical and the empirical, between the "subject" of theory and the "empirical" subject. The idea that the "sign" of woman is discourse-relative, a view we have already considered, is an attempt to make just such a distinction. On this view, actual women (and actual women's experiences) are something other to, unrelated to, "woman"</page><page sequence="13">ANTI-HUMANISM IN FEMINIST FILM THEORY 51 conceived as sign, and indeed inexplicable in terms of "woman" as sign. This idea threatens to produce the vertiginous conclusion that actual women are the other's other?another case of asymmetrical depen dence carried to extremes. It just will not do to say that "experience" is not a category that can be appealed to to test the theory of "woman" as sign. Anti-humanist theory is as fundamentally committed to agency and to subjectivity as humanist theory is, since any theorizing worth the effort to undertake has as its objective to explain and interpret agents and their relations to each other and the world. It simply wouldn't be worth doing if subjects were necessarily and inevitably fragmentary, discourse-relative, incoherent, and subjected to external authority (? la Althusser's conception of ideology) or internal psychic mechanisms. What sort of theory of the subject, then, am I proposing? Let me sketch here what I have argued for at greater length elsewhere.14 Neither "agency" nor "subjectivity" is an ontological category. These terms do not name some fixed entity in the world in the strong sense demanded by an ontology. Rather, "agency" and "subjectivity" are conceptual categories, categories we use to think about and talk about ourselves and each other. As conceptual categories, agency and subjectivity are con stituent terms within a much broader intentional framework. To speak of anything or anyone as either an agent or a subject, intention is relevant?and doubly so: we must attribute intentionality to the indi vidual we treat as an agent or subject, and by that very attribution we relate ourselves to that agent by intentional means, through the idiom of intentional description and explanation. Which means, and this is the first point I want to make, that to be an agent or a subject is already to exist in an intersubjective space, a space mapped out through its relations between subjects. Intersubjectivity precedes subjectivity. Understanding and interpretation are activities which define subjects. This makes subjects language users, users of symbol systems, though there is no requirement that they share a single natural language. This means, contrary to a view that still appears in the literature?a view which holds that communication precedes interpretation?that it is not the coded, rule-governed nature of a shared natural (or artificial) language by means of which "messages" or "contents" are "passed" from one agent to another. The idea that the code dominates both encoder and decoder is no part of my scenario. Just the reverse, since we can understand others even when they misspeak, when they utter malaprop isms, and when they speak metaphorically or ironically rather than literally. So the second point is that subjectivity and interpretation are interdependent. Which of course supports point one, since our most familiar experiences of interpretation involve others.</page><page sequence="14">52 NEW LITERARY HISTORY For all that theories of subjectivity since Freud have underscored that subjects are much less unified than was thought in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, it is nevertheless the case that we must acknowl edge the special kind of unity that subjects possess. It is a much less totalizing sort of unity than imagined by the oft-refuted Descartes. But it is not merely an Imaginary unity in the Lacanian sense of something radically cut off from the Real and yet prior to entry into the Symbolic. The sort of unity I am describing here involves the subject's ability to treat herself as well as those whom she would interpret as subjects persisting across time as well as existing at one time. Interpretation is radically temporal in nature. It is also radically dependent upon context?or, we could say, it is radically historical. It is moreover guided, as Heidegger and Gadamer have argued, by our interests and by our expectations, by our prejudices and by our position in the world.15 The sort of unity that subjects have and must have is not a unity of absolute integration and self-consistency. It is not the unity Toril Moi derisively attributes to the humanist subject?a unity that excludes contradiction and inconsistency. The sort of unity I am describing is not totalizing; it is holistic. Which is my third point: insofar as subjects are interpreters, they possess a particular kind of holistic unity. The sort of holistic unity involved, I would argue, takes the form of narrative. The fundamental objective of narrative?as opposed to de scription, rhetoric, or argument?is to account for continuity and change over time. The function of description is to say what a given state of affairs is (or is like) at some point; the function of rhetoric is to persuade one either to agree or to act in a particular way; the function of argument is to reveal the (formal or informal) logical connection between propositions and their conclusion, or between propositions and some particular action (this being the difference between the syllogism and the practical syllogism). The function of narrative is fundamentally organizational By organizing actions or events in relation to one another, narrative functions to make change intelligible, to make sense of change. The form of narrative explains the relationships between actions or events, and the explanation provided by narrative means proceeds with a view to the significance of the whole. The whole is presupposed by, but at the same time produced by, narrative means. Narrative holism is as central to the production of, say, histories as it is to the production of self-histories, to the production of fictional stories as it is to accounts of the actions of actual (that is, nonfictional) agents. The sort of holistic unity that is in question here is not one which represses, ignores, or overlooks contradictions?quite the reverse. And this is my fourth point: the sort of interpretation which is the hallmark of subjectivity takes the form of narrative, and to be an interpreter is to be</page><page sequence="15">ANTI-HUMANISM IN FEMINIST FILM THEORY 53 engaged in the practice of making sense by narrative means of oneself, others, the world we share, and the artifacts we have produced. The final point I want to raise about my account of subjectivity is that it is pragmatic in the technical sense of that term. As Charles Morris defined it, pragmatism is the study of "the relationship between signs and their interpreters."16 The centrality of interpreters?and thus of subjects?is crucial to pragmatics for several reasons. Perhaps the most important is that subjects do things with signs. What any string of signs might be said to mean "in itself" is a different matter from what a subject uses that string of signs to mean. A pragmatic view of subjectivity then does not see the subject as somehow the ideologically constituted effect of sign systems. Nor does a pragmatic view of subjectivity see the subject as an omnipotent controller and manipulator of the signs it uses (or the language it speaks). What is at issue is the relationship between interpreters and language, interpreters and other agents, interpreters and artifacts. A pragmatic view of subjectivity sees subjects as produced in and through their relationships with others, in and through their use of language, their actions, their production of and interpretation of artifacts. So on a pragmatic view, the interpretation of any subject must answer to the context in which that subject speaks or acts as well as to the intentions that led to the action or utterance (where the intention is not taken to be synonymous with the "meaning" of the action or utterance in question). My fifth point, then, is that the meaning of a subject's actions or utterances cannot be separated either from her intentions or from the context in which the action or utterance occurred. What these five key points concerning subjectivity and intersubjectivity, interpretation, holism, the narrative form of explanation and the pragmatic stance toward subjects jointly point to is a conception of the subject which is consistent with much writing by feminist theorists who are not in the grip of the humanism/anti-humanism opposition. Women as social subjects, as gendered subjects, may well be unsurprised by the argument that subjectivity depends upon intersubjectivity, that interpre tation is at the root of our social activities, that subjectivity is neither absolute and monolithic and univocal nor arbitrary and fragmentary and irreducibly polysemous. Women, including the women students I have taught, and in particular feminists and feminist theorists, are in no doubt that we are agents, that we act and act for reasons, that we are intentional, and yet that our actions are directed and restricted, ap proved or censured, by a complex sociopolitical structure in which gender is, as de Lauretis has suggested, a technology. The theory of the subject that I am advancing is very similar in spirit to that described by Patricia Waugh.17 Waugh points, as I have, to the opposition between humanism and anti-humanism in recent theory. But</page><page sequence="16">54 NEW LITERARY HISTORY Waugh goes on to remark that feminists have in the main realized that the anti-humanist refutation of a unified, centered subject leaves women in the aporeitic position of having, for theoretical reasons, to give up whatever hope we may have had for something like self-consciousness, control of our Uves, autonomy, and the ability to engage in political activity?and all in the name of a theory which has consistently seen women as other. To accept the move from humanism to anti-humanism? for women?would be tantamount to going from being Man's other to being the effect of discursive practices, to being Language's other? which is just to be, as I have suggested, the others other. On this construal, males used to be (or used to take themselves to be) subjects, but now recognize (or at least theorists recognize) that they are not; while females never were subjects, and can never be, if the humanist subject is only ideological. What is wanted, as Waugh underscores, is a different, nonoppositional conception of the subject. This is Waugh: Insights gained as feminism passed through a necessary stage of pursuing unity have produced an alternative conception of the subject as constructed through relationship, rather than postmodernism/post-structuralism's anti-humanist rejec tion of the subject. In many ways postmodernists have developed the modernist aesthetic of impersonality along the lines of Lacanian alienation, Derridean assault on presence and origin, and an Althusserian refusal of agency and determination as located in the individual. Much contemporary feminist fictional writing [and, as Annette Kuhn anticipated, contemporary feminist filmmaking18] has accommodated humanist beliefs in individual agency and the necessity and possibility of self-reflection and historical continuity as the basis of personal identity. It has modified the traditional forms of such beliefs, however, in order to emphasize the provisionality and positionality of identity, the historical and social construction of gender, and the discursive production of knowledge and power. What many of these texts suggest is that it is possible to experience oneself as a strong and coherent agent in the world, at the same time as understanding the extent to which identity and gender are socially constructed and represented. (FF 13) To conclude, then, I have been arguing that the alleged problem of women's subjectivity is an artifact of a particular moment in film theory and in feminist film theory, a moment characterized by institutional, genealogical, and rhetorical (or conceptual) forces which sustained the idea that there was a problem in the first place with subjectivity, and thus a problem with women's subjectivity. We might see a parallel in the omnipresent announcements of one sort of "crisis" or another?the alleged crisis of the humanities being just one of the recent examples. The very articulation of a crisis sustains the idea that there is a crisis, and sustains the investigation of the problem in strongly oppositional, crisis</page><page sequence="17">ANTI-HUMANISM IN FEMINIST FILM THEORY 55 sustaining terms. If, as I have been suggesting, the problem of women's subjectivity is another example of crisis-thought, if the problem of women's subjectivity is the product of the crisis-sustaining opposition between humanism and anti-humanism, then the abandonment of the rhetoric of that argument goes some way to dissolving the "problem" of woman's subjectivity. And if the view I offer of subjectivity is accepted, then we are no longer faced with an opposition between "woman" as sign and woman as social agent, a view which at its most reductive sees subjectivity as a byproduct of discursive systems. With this unproductive distinction gone, the idea that critical study is either theory-driven or object-driven goes as well. Where we wind up, I suggest, is where we were before, but with a different conception of what we are doing here. Theory, and therefore film theory, and feminist film theory, must be thought about in terms of its history as a practice. Theory is self reflexive, and the practice of theory should involve a self-conscious understanding of the concepts we use in explanation and interpreta tion. To "do" theory is not just to apply theoretical concepts to artifacts, but to reflect upon the sorts of explanations that we produce, and the circumstances of their production. For one who accepts this view, the problem of the asymmetrical dependence of feminist film theory on theory dissolves, since we cannot "do" feminist film theory without at the same time "doing" and re-doing theory.19 Queen's University notes 1 David Bordwell offers a diagnosis of these institutionalized strategies and routines in his recent Making Meaning: Inference and Rhetoric in the Interpretation of Cinema (Cambridge, Mass., 1989), see in particular ch. 2, "Routines and Practices," pp. 19-42. 2 Toril Moi, Sexual/Textual Politics (London, 1985), p. xiv; hereafter cited in text as STP. 3 Joan Copjec, "Individual Response," Camera Obscura, 20, no. 1 (1990), 121-27. 4 Rosalind Krauss, "Using Language to Do Business as Usual," Visual Theory: Painting and Interpretation, ed.
