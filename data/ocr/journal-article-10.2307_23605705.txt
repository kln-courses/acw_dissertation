<plain_text><page sequence="1">Abraham Joshua Heschel (1907-1972): Theologian and Scholar Ab. iRAHAM joshua HESCHEL died on December 23, 1972, just five days after he had handed the completed manuscript of his last book to his publisher. When his first major work in English appeared in 1951, his name was practically unknown outside the circle of professional Jewish scholars. Reinhold Niebuhr's prediction that he would soon become "a commanding and authoritative voice not only in the Jewish community but in the religious life of America" sounded more like a pious wish than a realistic expectation. Two decades later Heschel had emerged as the outstanding Jewish thinker of his generation, a major spiritual force in contemporary America and a recognized spokesman for Judaism among theologians and informed laymen. At memorial services held all over the American continent, in Israel and South Africa, Orthodox, Reform, and Conservative Jews, Hasidim, Protestant Bible scholars, Catholic theologians, and Israeli diplomats all paid tribute to a man whose interpretation of Jewish faith had touched their lives. In the words of the Protestant theologian John C. Bennett, Heschel "belonged to the whole American religious community," and although "he was profoundly Jewish he was yet a religious inspiration to Christians and to many searching people beyond the familiar religious boundaries." His Life Heschel was the joint product of the traditional, self-contained universe of the Eastern European Jewish piety in which he grew up and the secular world of modern scholarship and philosophy into which his search for knowledge led him later. He was born in Warsaw on January 11, 1907, to Rabbi "Moishele" Mordecai, the Peltzovizner rebbe, and Reisel (Perlow) Heschel. Among his paternal ancestors he counted Rabbi Dov Ber of Mezeritch, "the Great Maggid"; Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel, the Apter rebbe, and Rabbi Israel of Rizhyn. On his mother's side, he was descended from Rabbi Levi Isaac of Berditchev and Rabbi Pinhas of Koretz. Growing up in the self-contained world of hasidic piety and learning, he devoted his early years to the study of rabbinical literature, and at the age of ten he not only was at home in the Talmud, but had also been introduced to the world of Jewish mysticism, the Kabbalah. Among his teachers was the well-known talmudic scholar Rabbi Menahem Zemba of Praha. In later life Heschel attributed his abiding dedication to Judaism not just to 533</page><page sequence="2">534 / AMERICAN JEWISH YEAR BOOK, 1973 the thorough exposure to traditional studies in his youth, but also to the effect of a life lived among people who "were sure that everything hinted at something transcendent," where the presence of God was a daily experience and the sanctification of life a daily task. His book, The Earth Is the Lord's: The Inner World of the Jew in Eastern Europe (1950), is an attempt to evoke the memory and the values of this world which was so soon to be annihilated in the Nazi holocaust. Eager to acquire a modern education, Heschel enrolled at the secular Yiddish "Realgymnasium" in Vilna, where he graduated in July 1927. During his stay in Vilna he developed literary interests, joined a students' literary club, and became a cofounder of the "Yung Vilne" movement of writers and poets. In the fall of 1927 he moved to Berlin where he enrolled at the Hochschule fiir die Wissenschaft des Judentums and the university. Although he developed an interest in subjects ranging from the history of art to psychology, his university studies were mainly concentrated in the fields of Semitics and philosophy. In February 1933 Berlin University awarded him the doctoral degree for his dissertation on prophetic consciousness (Die Prophétie). The Hochschule appointed him a lecturer after his ordination in 1934. In 1937 Martin Buber chose Heschel to be his successor at the Central Organization for Jewish Adult Education and the Jüdisches Lehrhaus in Frankfurt am Main. Having been deported in October 1938, together with the rest of Polish Jews then resident in Germany, he taught for eight months at the Institute for Jewish Studies in Warsaw. A call to join the faculty of the Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati, received in April 1939, enabled him to leave Poland before the Nazis overran that country. In July 1939 Heschel reached England, where he founded the Institute for Jewish Learning in London. In 1940 he arrived in the United States, to serve as an Associate Professor of Philosophy and Rabbinics at the Hebrew Union College for five years. In 1945 he joined the faculty of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America in New York, where he subsequently held the title of Professor of Jewish Ethics and Mysticism. It was here that Heschel taught until the time of his death and where he influenced a generation of rabbis and educators in the Conservative movement. Besides being a scholar, Heschel became a sought-after lecturer throughout America. He also held visiting professorships at a number of universities, and in 1965-1966 became the first Jewish theologian to be appointed the Henry Emerson Fosdick Visiting Professor at Union Theological Seminary in New York. Social and Religious Concerns Heschel's involvement in the civil-rights movement led to a friendship with Martin Luther King, Jr., and his opposition to the war in Vietnam led him to</page><page sequence="3">ABRAHAM JOSHUA HESCHEL / 535 take an active role as cochairman of Clergy and Laity Concerned About Vietnam. On September 4, 1963, Heschel addressed a convocation of the Rabbinical Assembly at the Jewish Theological Seminary. At the urging of his close friend, Rabbi Wolfe Kelman, he utilized this platform to call the attention of his audience of over two hundred rabbis to the plight of the Russian Jews. His passionate plea for massive public action received wide publicity in the press and led to the subsequent formation of the American Conference on Soviet Jewry Heschel's first major involvement in the world of public affairs occurred when he took an active part in the delicate negotiations between Jewish groups and the Catholic Church before and during Vatican Council II. In 1960, when Pope John XXIII planned to convene an Ecumenical Council, the American Jewish Committee established communications with the Vatican to set out the facts of Jewish-Christian relationships and to recommend plans for eliminating antisemitism from the Church's teachings. They maintained contact with Augustin Cardinal Bea, who headed the Secretariat for Christian Unity, and submitted two memoranda to his office. Other Jewish organizations also entered the arena, and in 1961-1962 the leaders of B'nai B'rith and the World Jewish Congress submitted to the Church authorities memoranda dealing with the problem of antisemitism and Jewish-Christian relationships as social problems. The American Jewish Committee, however, convinced that since the Church's attitude toward Jews was inextricably connected with basic questions of theology, decided to make use of the services of a qualified theological scholar who would be able to speak to the Church authorities in terms of their own religious concerns. Thus, at the initiative of Rabbi Marc H. Tanenbaum, national director of interreligious affairs at the American Jewish Committee, Heschel traveled to Rome in December 1961 and met with Cardinal Bea. This led to a friendship between the two men who spoke the same language in more than one way: Cardinal Bea, the Jesuit Bible scholar and theologian, and Heschel, the Berlin-trained theologian and author of Die Prophétie, conducted their conversations in German and shared a deep appreciation for the message of Israel's prophets. The Bavarian-born Cardinal, in his confrontation with the Jewish scholar from Poland, was acutely aware of the part anti-Jewish teachings had played in making possible the murder of European Jewry by Nazi Germany. Bea asked Heschel to submit suggestions for the Ecumenical Council to improve Catholic-Jewish relations. Heschel's memorandum, prepared in cooperation with the American Jewish Committee, made three important recommendations. It urged the Council "to reject and condemn those who assert that the Jews as a people are responsible for the crucifixion. . . ."It suggested that the Council "acknowledge the integrity and permanent preciousness of Jews and Judaism" so that the Jews be accepted as Jews. This</page><page sequence="4">536 / AMERICAN JEWISH YEAR BOOK, 1973 meant that the Church would reconsider its missionary attitude and refrain from regarding Jews primarily as potential converts. And finally, it called for programs "to eliminate abuses and derogatory stereotypes" by promoting scholarly cooperation and the creation of church agencies to combat religious prejudice. In March 1963, on a visit to the United States, Cardinal Bea met Rabbi Tanenbaum and Dr. Heschel at the chancery of Richard Cardinal Cushing, Archbishop of Boston, and told them confidentially that he had been asked by Pope John to share with them the information that the Pope was exploring the establishment of formal diplomatic relations between the Holy See and the State of Israel. The Pope wanted to learn what the possible effect of this action would be, and both Heschel and Tanenbaum strongly encouraged this course of action. On March 31, 1963, Cardinal Bea addressed a meeting of Jewish leaders, who included Orthodox, Conservative, and Reform rabbis, under the chairmanship of Dr. Heschel. On September 3, 1964, a year and three months after the death of Pope John, a watered-down version of the original statement on the Jews—it reintroduced the hope for their ultimate conversion—appeared in the press. Heschel immediately issued a public statement in which he said: "As I have repeatedly stated to leading personalities of the Vatican, I am ready to go to Auschwitz any time, if faced with the alternative of conversion or death." On September 14, 1964, on the opening day of the Council's third session, Heschel, accompanied by Zachariah Shuster of the American Jewish Committee, was received in a special audience by Pope Paul VI and pleaded for a strengthened declaration. Although the final Council statement on the Jews, proclaimed by the Pope on October 28, 1965, was a compromise document which did not fulfill Heschel's original expectations, he nevertheless felt that it was a landmark in Jewish-Catholic relations and opened the path for a new era of better understanding and mutual respect. This view was echoed in a letter which Cardinal Bea addressed to Heschel on February 8, 1966: I am glad about the opinion you expressed about our Conciliar decree concerning the Jews. Certainly not everything is as perfect as one might have wished; but as the old German proverb says: "The better is the enemy of the good." We are satisfied that something good has been accomplished and hope that it will be the basis for a trustful, fraternal cooperation, especially in those areas which we both have in common. His Work Although Heschel was a teacher, lecturer, and a man active on behalf of causes he considered important, he devoted most of his waking hours to study</page><page sequence="5">ABRAHAM JOSHUA HESCHEL / 537 and writing. His published work has established his reputation as a scholar and thinker, and it constitutes his enduring heritage to future generations.* In an age of extreme specialization, when "scholarship" frequently means that one knows more and more about less and less, the range of his achievements is truly amazing. His books and monographs deal with biblical prophecy, medieval philosophy, the lives of Maimonides and Abravanel, Jewish mysticism and ancient rabbinic theology, East European Jewry and the Sabbath, prayer and symbolism, the State of Israel, applied religious ethics, the history of Hasidism, and the nature of man. But this variety of subjects does not bespeak mere eclecticism. Heschel's work can perhaps best be understood as an attempt to achieve a synthesis between the two different worlds in which he lived before he came to America. He experienced the clash between the claims of ancestral piety and the demands of modern secularism with full force: I came with great hunger to the University of Berlin to study philosophy. I looked for a system of thought, for the depth of the spirit, for the meaning of existence. Erudite and profound scholars gave courses in logic, epistemology, esthetics, ethics, and metaphysics. Yet in spite of the intellectual power and honesty which I was privileged to witness, I became increasingly aware of the gulf that separated my views from those held at the university. To them, religion was a feeling. God was an idea, a postulate of reason. They granted Him the status of being a logical possibility. But to assume that He had existence would have been a crime against epistemology. The result of this confrontation was Heschel's attempt to examine the classical documents of Judaism anew in order to discover their relevance for contemporary man. In this enterprise he made use of the conceptual tools of academic philosophy, especially the techniques of phenomenology. But he was careful to refrain from forcing upon biblical thought categories derived from Greek metaphysics and neo-Kantian philosophy, which in his opinion distorted the meaning of the biblical message. In his dissertation he developed a novel conceptual framework that became the nucleus of his later philosophy of Judaism. Heschel saw the task of the religious philosopher neither as the construction *For a bibliography of Heschel's writings up to 1965 see Fritz A.

The first substitutes philosophy for religion; the second tends to replace it with the psychology of religion. Heschel's own writings attempt to penetrate and illumine the reality underlying religion, the living and dynamic relationship between God and man, through the objective, yet sympathetic, understanding of the documents of Israel's tradition and of the life and experience of the pious Jew. There are three starting points of contemplation about God; three trails that lead to Him. The first is the way of sensing the presence of God in the world, in things; the second is the way of sensing His presence in the Bible; the third is the way of sensing His presence in sacred deeds. . . . These three ways correspond in our tradition to the main aspects of religious existence: worship, learning, and action. Although he brought to this task the tools of philosophy, he pointed out repeatedly that no amount of rational analysis alone can ever exhaust the richness and fullness of this reality. He therefore emphasized that reason itself discloses its own limits and that the ineffable quality of the divine cannot be reduced without remainder to any scheme of conceptual categories: "We apprehend more than we can comprehend." Heschel's lifework can thus be seen as consisting of two parallel strands: his studies and interpretations of the classical sources of Judaism and his endeavor to offer to our generation an authentic theology, resulting from the application of the insights gained from these classical sources to contemporary problems and perplexities. Thus he started out with his book on prophecy, Die Prophétie (the basis of his expanded work in English, The Prophets), in which he presented a phenomenology of prophetic conscious ness in the Bible, and followed it with his interpretation of Maimonides' life and thought, Maimonides: Eine Biographie, where the confrontation of scholastic Aristotelianism with rabbinic Judaism is examined. Articles on medieval philosophy, Kabbalah, and Hasidism continued this enterprise. Since 1962 two volumes of a major study (in Hebrew) of two great trends in talmudic thought concerning the nature of the Torah and revelation have appeared under the title, Torah min ha-shamayim ba-ispaqlaryah shel ha-dorot, with a third volume in manuscript. The two-volume Yiddish study of the thought of Rabbi Menahem Mendel of Kotzk, completed in 1972, appeared a few months after the author's death. Philosophy of Judaism The results of some of these and similar researches are utilized in the formation of Heschel's original philosophy of Judaism, which has found its chief expression in two books: Man Is Not Alone: A Philosophy of Religion</page><page sequence="7">ABRAHAM JOSHUA HESCHEL / 539 (1951) and its successor volume, God in Search of Man: A Philosophy of Judaism (1955). Religion is there defined as an answer to man's ultimate questions. Since modern man is largely alienated from the reality that informs genuine religion, Heschel is not content to present the traditional answers but tries above all to recover the significant existential questions to which Judaism offers answers. This leads to a theology which, by going below the surface phenomena of modern doubt and rootlessness, tries to confront the reader with the living God of the Bible. In expounding the various approaches that lead one to an awareness of God's reality, he repeatedly stresses that we cannot prove the existence of God: In the depth of human thinking we all presuppose some ultimate reality which on the level of discursive thinking is crystallized into the concept of a power, a principle, or a structure. This, then, is the order in our thinking and existence: the ultimate or God comes first and our reasoning about Him second. God to the religiously sensitive man is an "ontological presupposition" rather than the conclusion of a logical statement. Heschel describes three ways in which man can come to an awareness of God. The first is by going, through wonder, beyond the mere givenness of the facts to awareness of the grandeur and mystery of reality. Such wonder can take different forms: as curiosity it can become the starting point of science, which looks beyond given facts to the laws they exemplify; as radical amazement it can point beyond fact to the ground and power that stand behind all fact and perceptions of fact. To the Biblical man, the sublime is but a form in which the presence of God strikes forth. This evocative approach yields a panentheistic outlook: through created things man reaches an awareness of God, who is within but also beyond all finite existence. In the second way, man reaches an awareness of God by delving into the recesses of his own being, thus realizing that he is not an independent and self-sufficient entity, but part of something greater and more encompassing than his individual ego. The fallacy of assuming that the self is a discrete isolated subject which can find God as another isolated object of cognition is shattered once the awareness is gained that the conscious self is itself the expression of something never fully expressed and that life and time are not our property but a trust. This second way tends to a quasi-mystical world view. But it stops short of the danger of mystical absorption and annihilation in the Godhead by its articulation of God as the subject of all reality and man as the object whose dignity and worth are founded in his very consciousness of being the goal of</page><page sequence="8">540 / AMERICAN JEWISH YEAR BOOK, 1973 divine concern and expectation. In principle any moment of life and any experience can be regarded by the sensitive believer as such divine address and summons. But in fact this awareness is felt only rarely in a clear and unambiguous manner. In the third way, man becomes aware of the voice of God. The "holy dimension" of harkening to the voice and acting responsively and responsibly characterizes the biblical view of man as the recipient of divine revelation. It is in facing the transcendent God and His demands that one becomes a moral agent. The dichotomy of faith and works was never a real issue in Judaism since the two are not inimical but inherently complementary. By doing the mitzvot the Jew enters the holy dimension of God's challenge and guidance, and by obediently responding to the divine demand he experiences himself as the object of God's address and concern, thus gaining faith in the Author of the Law by responding to His voice. The God of the Bible Heschel's emphasis that faith is not so much assent to a proposition as an attitude of the whole person, an engagement and attachment to God's demands, is not only important for his understanding of the significance of halakhah ("law") but is also crucial for his interpretation of God as personal concern and for his critique of the main trends of philosophical theology that have tried to assimilate the living God of the Bible to impersonal categories of Greek ontology or modern process philosophy. While the medieval tendency was in the direction of describing God as Being Itself, the modern inclination has been to raise the concept of God from the level of crude anthropomorphism by describing the Deity as the power that makes for goodness, the underlying structure or nisus of the universe, the moral dimension of reality, etc. This, however, is not only detrimental to religious life, but also in conflict with the biblical and rabbinical outlook. Heschel tries to do justice to the experience of the living God who stands in a dynamic relationship to man and who is influenced and affected by human actions. Hence he stresses the divine concern of the personal God as the most essential category for an adequate Jewish theology. If God is merely a thing among things, even though the most powerful one, He is not truly God. If He is a general principle of power, then He is an abstraction lacking religious availability. Therefore Heschel develops his doctrine of the divine pathos. The God of pathos, described in analogy to the human personality, is never exhausted in any of His particular manifestations. God cares for and is interested in all His creatures. Indeed, creation as a religious concept points at the divine care and concern for that which is to receive the gift of existence by the divine fiat. The doctrine that God shares in the joys and sufferings of His children and that their actions make a difference</page><page sequence="9">ABRAHAM JOSHUA HESCHEL / 541 to Him is the prerequisite for relationship between creator and creature. As the rabbinic phrase puts it, "man is the partner of the Holy One, blessed be He," and what we do here and now is of cosmic importance. By doing the mitzvot—ceremonial as well as ethical—and thus cooperating in the building of the Kingdom here on earth, man finds his true vocation and develops his true humanity. Far from being a preordained process reducible to a scientific formula, life becomes a drama in which the unexpected, the novel, and the unique can always happen again. The universe is not closed; the horizon is always kept open to new incursions of divine challenges and freely given human responses. The idea of the divine pathos must not be confused with the apparently similar view of paganism. While pagan gods were also personal, they acted in unpredictable, capricious, and selfish ways. Judaism, however, teaches that there is no dichotomy between a personal living God and the universal canons of ethics. "God's pathos is ethos." To say that God is personal may, of course, be courting the danger of anthropomorphism. But to speak of Him as mechanical or abstract compounds the danger, since it makes Him subhuman rather than superhuman. To affirm that God is always the subject and never the mere object of religious experience and thought guards only partially against this error. Although His essence is incomprehensible and He is known only by His acts and expressions, human language must take the risk of referring to Him as a person: the closest analogue to the prophetic encounter with the Deity is the encounter that takes place between human persons: The Bible speaks in the language of man. It deals with the problems of man, and its terms are borrowed from the vocabulary of the people. It has not coined many words, but it has given new meaning to borrowed words. The prophets had to use anthropomorphic language in order to convey His non-anthropomorphic Being. The greatest challenge to the Biblical language was now to reconcile in words the awareness of God's transcendence with His overwhelming livingness and concern. The Task of Man The assertion that God shares in the mystery of personality must not be misunderstood as an attempt to reduce Him to human scale. On the contrary, it indicates that man's ability to act with compassion, sympathy, and concern is the sign that he was created in the imago Dei, and that man's true fulfillment is found in imitatio Dei. Man leads the good life not only by following general rules as codified in the Bible and in tradition, although these rules are an indispensable part for the business of living. He must, in addition, respond individually and spontaneously to the demands of God in each new and concrete situation. This is the reason why scholars and saints are never done</page><page sequence="10">542 / AMERICAN JEWISH YEAR BOOK, 1973 with the task of determining the divine intention for changing times and circumstances throughout Jewish history. The tension of fixed pattern, qeva', and inner spontaneity, kawwanah, is a pervasive trait of Jewish life. Though never completely solved by an individual, its resolution is an ideal toward which every Jew should strive: joy and discipline; regularity and spontaneity. The doctrine that actions teach and that religion cannot be acquired merely by cognitive endeavor has led Heschel to the view that Judaism requires the "leap of action" rather than the Kierkegaardian "leap of faith." Judaism demands the willingness to learn by doing, by participating actively in performing God's will, to appreciate and to be enriched by an experience that touches the whole of man and goes beyond the mere analysis and reinterpretation of what we already knew beforehand. In doing, we go beyond ourselves; we surpass ourselves and become co-workers in the task of redemption. It would be a mistake to take this, as some critics have done, as an abdication of reason and advocacy of religious observance as a substitute for intelligent and critical examination of one's religious heritage. The leap of action is no more a denial of reason than the advice to gain an appreciation and understanding of music by not merely studying its theory but also by listening to and, if possible, performing great works of music. "Depth Theology" All this is clearly presented in Heschel's writings. But whoever wants truly to come to grips with his basic outlook must read him searchingly. Beneath the peshat, the plain sense, he must delve into the "depth theology." The key to Heschel's thought is found in the concept of personal concern. The Ultimate is not Being but concern, or "directed attention." Few of Heschel's readers are aware that he has propounded a truly revolutionary doctrine, challenging the whole venerable tradition of Jewish and Christian metaphysical theology from Philo, Maimonides, and Thomas Aquinas to Hermann Cohen, Etienne Gilson, and Paul Tillich. He proclaimed that the Greek category of "being" and eternally frozen perfection is inadequate to Judaism and must be replaced by a new set of categories derived from biblical thinking. Aristotle's Unmoved Mover must give way to the Bible's Most Moved Mover, the God of pathos and transitive concern, who stands in a dynamic and reciprocal relationship to his creation. "Being through creation," through the divine act of freedom, expresses in symbolic form that reality is not a self-sufficient, fixed, mechanical order. It is a process in which responsible man freely reacts to the challenges of his life and in which surprise, novelty, and unexpected creative possibilities always exist. Through sympathy, compassion, and sensitivity to the divine concern man can overcome his egocentric predicament and can fulfill his true potential. The denial of fixed being and substance as the ultimate building block of the</page><page sequence="11">ABRAHAM JOSHUA HESCHEL / 543 universe opens new possibilities, not only for religious thought but also for philosophy. The parallel to modern physics, which sees reality as a field of forces rather than a collection of moving billiard balls, is obvious. Future researchers would be well advised to probe the connections and parallels between Heschel's biblical philosophy and process philosophers (e.g., Whitehead and Bergson) and existentialists (e.g., Heidegger, Jaspers, and Marcel). In ethics the idea of concern helps to explain the ideal of care for the fellow creature; in the theory of knowledge it helps to overcome the paralysis of the cognizing subject locked in the magic circle of Kant's epistemology. In exploring basic human attitudes, it enables us to overcome routine dullness and alienation by reminding us that man is the being who always is beyond himself, in ek-stasis, transcending his loneliness and isolation in knowledge, action, art, and worship. Space and time take on a new meaning in Heschel: things are merely frozen processes; life itself is a process gathering the past into itself, reaching out into the future. Reality is not like a stone sculpture, but like a symphony. The Sabbath is to Judaism an edifice in time, a cathedral of the spirit. Beyond Tragedy One may be tempted to think that Heschel's lifework and philosophy constitute a harmonious, well-planned whole; that he has fashioned a grand synthesis of Judaism for our age. But this impression, plausible as it may seem, is deceptive. His thought bears witness to a deep awareness of the tragic, fragmented character of reality. Although inspired by the ideal 'alma de-yihuda, the world of unification, he knew that we still live in the 'alma de-peruda, the world of separation. His thought abounds in polar concepts and the fields of forces created by them: qeva' and kawwanah, mystery and meaning, God's self-disclosure and His hiding His face, faith and reason, grandeur et misère de l'homme. Heschel often used the language of paradox, not because he denigrated logic and reason, but because reality is too complex and subtle to be caught in uni vocal concepts. He was not a simple person, and his religious thought is not a simplistic philosophy. He felt the claims of natural and of crisis theology, of sacramentalism and of utopianism. Everywhere we walk is holy ground; but everywhere we go, truth is buried and horror lurks. Heschel told the midrash of how Abraham arrived at the certainty that there is a God who is concerned with the world. Abraham may be compared to a man who, traveling from place to place, saw "birah doleqet," a palace all ablaze. "Is it possible that there is no one who cares for the palace?" he wondered—until the owner of the palace looked on him and said: "I am the owner of the palace!" Similarly, Abraham, our father, wondered: "Is it conceivable that the world is without a guide?" The Holy One, blessed be</page><page sequence="12">544 I AMERICAN JEWISH YEAR BOOK, 1973 He, looked out and said: "I am the guide, the sovereign of the world." (Genesis Rabbah 39, 1). The Hebrew word "doleqet" can mean "illuminated" and it can mean "in flames." We come to the awareness of God through the glory and beauty of the world, the "palace full of light," and we also come to Him when, seeing the world in flames, we ask: "Is there no One who cares and guides?" But beyond crisis and the absurdity of evil, Heschel taught us to see goodness and meaning. Significantly, the work he finished a few days before his death dealt with the Ba'al Shem Tov and Rabbi Mendel of Kotzk. The first saw the divine in everything and celebrated in ecstasy the joyous feeling of "let atar panuy minneh"—no place is empty of God. The second faced with radical honesty the absurdity, horror, and tragedy of existence. Fully aware of the tension, Heschel taught us not to deny the mystery but to have faith in an ultimate meaning beyond it. With the Bratzlaver rebbe he asserted defiantly: "Despair does not exist!" In prayer and celebration the tasks of the religious thinker and the poet merge. In praising God we restore our health. We learn to appreciate the privilege and glory of existence and attain a taste of messianic fulfillment. Fritz A. Rothschild</page></plain_text>
