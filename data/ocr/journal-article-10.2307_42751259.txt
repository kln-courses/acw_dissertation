<plain_text><page sequence="1">Cognitive Science and the Natural Knowledge of God Abstract Rather than being in inherent conflict with religion or operating on planes that do not intersect, the cognitive science of religion (CSR) can be used to renovate a religious understanding of the world. CSR allows one to reshape the perspectives of Aquinas and Calvin on the natural knowledge of God. The Christian tradition affirms that all human beings have available to them some knowledge of God. This claim has empiri- cal import and thus invites scientific investigation and clarification. A CSR-inspired lens allows one's theological reflections to move from paradigms that focus on the cognitive reach of a domain-general power of human thought to a paradigm focused on different ways of relating to another person. The case study of the natural knowledge of God pre- sented here models a productive way of relating CSR and religious perspectives from within a faith tradition. In discussing the import of the cognitive science of religion (CSR), it is easy to gravitate to such topics as whether CSR 'explains religion away' or undercuts the grounds for religious belief. When the discussion evolves in this manner, the role of the religious person easily becomes one that is highly defensive in nature. It should be uncontroversial that one can use material in CSR as part of an overarching argument that is critical of religion. It should be only slightly less uncontroversial that using CSR in this way is itself worthy of some critical attention (cf. Schloss and Murray 2009; Visala 2011; Van Slyke 2011). Whether employing the tools of cog- nitive science is inimical to religion, however, depends not just on how readily one can use it to try to undercut religious belief but also partly on whether there is any other way to use insights garnered from CSR. The exception to the dialectic of attack and defense that surrounds the CSR literature is Kelly Clark and Justin Barrett's exploration of "Cognitive Science and the Natural Knowledge of God" by Adam Green, The Monist, vol. 96, no. 3, pp. 399-419.

Clark and Barrett, in effect, ask whether something posited in reformed theology can be mapped onto the terrain of CSR. In this essay, I want to explore the prospects for the opposite sort of move. I want to ask whether CSR can be a resource for doing theology. Can we take insights in CSR and map them onto a theological domain in a way that lends insight specifically from the perspective of someone operating inside a faith tradition? To this end, I will focus on Christian theology and the notion of the natural knowledge of God. I argue that CSR helps one develop a theological understanding of the natural knowledge of God in terms of different kinds of social cognition. This position con- trasts markedly with the reliance of thinkers as diverse as Aquinas and Calvin on explicating the natural knowledge of God in terms of the virtues or vices of whatever domain-general power of thought makes philosophy possible. To the extent that the essay succeeds in making progress in the theological domain, I take this to be evidence via case study for the con- clusion that bringing the cognitive sciences to bear on religious matters need not militate against religion. 1. Social Cognition and the Cognitive Science of Religion In examining the extranatural elements of religions cross-culturally, a common feature comes to the fore. Religions tend to concern themselves with what are called "minimally counterintuitive agents" (Boyer and Ramble 2001; Boyer 2001, 51-91; Gregory and Barrett 2009). Minimally counterintuitive agents are entities that adhere to most of our intuitive expectations about agents with a small number of exceptions. The small number of exceptions are of such a kind as to make these agents impor- tant and, therefore, attention grabbing. They know more, can do more, and may be less detectable than normal agents. Because minimally counterin- tuitive agents only have a limited number of ways in which they deviate from our usual conception of agency, they are also easy to remember and to communicate to others. Though there is, at first sight, not much that gods, ancestors, witches, living mountains, and angels have in common, they are all counterintuitive agents and tend to be conceived in ways that place them on a continuum with other, more familiar agents. Even Bud-</page><page sequence="3">COGNITIVE SCIENCE AND KNOWLEDGE OF GOD 401 dhism, as it is practiced on the ground, tends to be very much concerned with how one relates to special agents (Sloan 2004, 68-84). The preoccupation of religion with agents is good news for a cogni- tive approach to studying religion because there is much that we know about social cognition. One of the things we know is that prowess with social cognition need not be tied to the sort of abstract, regimented style of thinking employed in philosophy. High-functioning persons with autism and persons with Asperger's syndrome, for instance, can be very adept with thinking in terms of systems and yet be profoundly impaired when it comes to social cognition. In fact, a prominent theory of autism holds that the autistic condition is one of having a strong disposition towards systemizing to the neglect of empathy (Baron-Cohen 2003). Moreover, when complex problems can be tackled in the social domain, this is not necessarily because abstract, pseudophilosophical reasoning has found a way to impose itself in the social domain. On the contrary, when it comes to solving puzzles of logic or probability, there is some evi- dence that we are naturally bad at these problems unless they are posed in social terms (cf. Cosmides [1989] and discussion of this material in McCauley [2011, 55-57]). Our brains typically become specialized for social information in a way that is rarely if ever achieved for other kinds of thinking (for overviews of the relevant developmental literature, cf. Reddy [2008]; Hobson [2004]). The idea within Christian theology that there is a natural knowledge of God intersects with the empirical findings of CSR in a fairly straight- forward manner. The natural knowledge of God is supposed to be that knowledge of the divine that is available to all persons without the need for special revelation. If CSR finds a cross-cultural pattern in how the supernatural is conceived, one ought to ask whether this pattern tracks what the natural knowledge of God is supposed to consist in, and, if CSR posits that some specialized cognitive systems deal with religious phe- nomena, one ought to consider what it would be for the natural knowledge of God to be underwritten by such cognitive architecture. Using CSR in this way is rendered the more germane to theological enquiry by the ten- dency in figures as diverse as Aquinas and Calvin to develop the notion of the natural knowledge of God by reference to either the virtues or the vices of philosophical reason. Consequently, it is worth our while to gain an overview of what kind of cognition CSR invokes in its explanations of</page><page sequence="4">402 ADAM GREEN religion with which we can then reexamine the positions of Aquinas and Calvin and the role of philosophy in their respective accounts. The most basic form of social cognition that must be present for us to traffic in social information concerns detecting the presence of agents. Without the ability to parse the world in terms of agency, other forms of social cognition would be of little help. Psychological evidence shows that it is easy for patterns of stimuli to cause one to react as if an agent is present even if the stimuli comes in forms that do not correspond in any straightforward way to a typical animal body (cf. the classic study of Heider and Simmel [1944]). The ease with which one comes to suspect the presence of agency comports well with evolutionary considerations. One can readily imagine that a bias towards false positives in agency detection would help one avoid predators and detect prey. It is better to be a little paranoid than to be lunch. Early efforts in CSR to revive the anthropomorphic theory of religion seized on such findings to suggest that conceptions of extranatural agents are buttressed by or even have their origins in a kind of hyperactive agency detection device or HADD (cf. Guthrie [1993]; the term is coined in Barrett [2000]). It is not for nothing, a proponent of such a theory would argue, that depictions of the gods across cultures tend to be depic- tions of beings that are very much like us and the other creatures with which we interact. The gods are like us only more formidable. There should be a strong biological imperative in favor of keeping track of pow- erful agents that can either destroy or protect one, and CSR sees an affinity between that biological imperative and the religious impulse. It would be a mistake, however, to limit one's attention to putative experiences of extranatural agents. The social mind has more tools at its disposal, and religious experiences, at least those of a mystical grade, are comparatively rare. More common is the tendency to find order in the world that suggests to one that there must be an agent that has done the ordering. Children evidence a strong disposition towards teleology (Kelemen 2004). They appear to find it very natural to divide the world into artifacts, which humans make, and everything else, which they pred- icate to the creative work of extranatural agency. In a child's mind, even the pointiness of a rock is a candidate for something that has been endowed with a specific purpose. This tendency does not necessarily dis- appear in adulthood (Keleman and Rosset 2009). In fact, Helen De Cruz</page><page sequence="5">COGNITIVE SCIENCE AND KNOWLEDGE OF GOD 403 and Johan De Smedt have argued that the same bias toward teleological thinking that children evidence makes its presence known in the perennial appeal of both cosmological arguments and arguments from design for God's existence (De Smedt and De Cruz 2011; De Cruz and De Smedt 2010). This disposition of the human mind involves social cognition in that a human is not merely disposed to view items in the world as having a purpose but as having been given a purpose, i.e., by some kind of creator or designer. The tendency to see purpose in the world is not restricted to the design of things, however, but also extends to explanations of why things happen. If one's ontology includes agents that are able to do things that normal agents can't, then one will often have to ask whether the events in one's world could have been caused intentionally. Whether something good or bad happens to someone, one has to ask whether it could have come about due to the intentions of an extranatural agent. Such social rea- soning is common enough amongst human agents. If one's coworker gets a promotion instead of oneself, one will at least entertain what the reasons of one's employer could have been and whether those reasons could have included some ill will towards oneself. If one's ontology includes power- ful and hard to detect agents, one will be drawn to ask what they may be doing in one's environment and why. Scott Atran posits that religious thinking makes use of a predator-protector-prey schema (Atran 2002, 51-79). One tries to identify not only what extranatural agents there are but whether these agents are protectors or predators and whether there is anything one can do to stay on the good side of these agents. One might also think of the relevant background being a version of the social dominance hierarchy one finds in primate groups as well as in other social animals (Wilkins 2012). The socially dominant individual can impose his will on any conflict in the 'pack' and, ultimately, the socially dominant individual has a motive for keeping relative peace in his pack. In this sense, so long as one does not see oneself or the dominant individ- ual as being miscast in the dominance hierarchy, one can expect one's pragmatic interests to coincide in fruitful ways with those of the dominant individual. One might, of course, want to enhance or fortify one's position in the hierarchy, but that's consistent with the dominant individual playing a pivotal role in securing whatever measure of wellbeing one currently enjoys. Given the dynamics of a dominance hierarchy, one would expect</page><page sequence="6">404 ADAM GREEN the class of actions that provokes an assertive response on the part of the dominant individual to include those actions that challenge his position of privilege in the pack. The predator-protector-prey schema and the general background of the social dominance hierarchy provide one with a tempting story for why it is that the gods might be mixed up with a group's moral norms. Cross- culturally, the social mind and the moral mind appear to overlap substantially. This is especially true in the case of extranatural agents, and, as we will see, the natural knowledge of God in Christian theology is sup- posed to have some moral import. The gods may or may not be the source of the moral code. Divine command ethics does not appear to be an eth- nological imperative, but the gods are in some way or another bound up with policing moral codes from culture to culture (cf. Barrett 2004, 45-55). Furthermore, an important part of the moral code of different cul- tures is how one behaves towards the gods and their sacred spaces. If the moral norms are enforced in a social hierarchy and partly serve the func- tion of stabilizing that hierarchy, then one would expect an entity occupying the slot of the socially dominant individual to have a special moral role in the life of the community. Consequently, when events occur that either harm or benefit a person, a religious person has to ask whether the gods or other extranatural agents may be involved and involved qua moral agents. The social mind, after all, does not merely track the pres- ence and doings of agents as a neutral observer but as someone with particular interests embedded in a relational and normative context, and the gods are good candidates for being dominant individuals, if not preda- tors if things go very wrong for oneself.1 Not all religious systems endorse extranatural agents that are only minimally counterintuitive, and it is certainly true that many religions have teachings that militate against the pragmatic, self-interested version of religion that one gets through a CSR lens. CSR does not ignore the existence of very counterintuitive or non-agential conceptions of the supernatural. Instead, CSR claims that deviations from the pragmatic, agential form of religion are unnatural and, therefore, harder to sustain. One of the interesting findings in CSR is what is called "theological incor- rectness" (Sloan 2004) or more dramatically "the tragedy of the theologian" (Boyer 2001, 283). Just as the nature of the social mind helps</page><page sequence="7">COGNITIVE SCIENCE AND KNOWLEDGE OF GOD 405 to predict what elements a religion may have, it also helps predict the ways in which popular religion tends to deviate from formal teaching and instruction as well as the way one's unreflective religious behavior may be in tension with one's considered theological beliefs.2 For example, a study by Justin Barrett and Frank Keil appears to show that, with minimal prompting, one will encode a story about God in a way that deviates from official teachings in the direction of natural agency (Barrett and Keil 1996; see also Barrett 1998). For instance, a subject might recall a story as if God can only do one thing at a time or is located at one place at a time, even though the story itself does not explic- itly put things in a theologically incorrect way. An experimenter can generate this effect even if the subject has read a theologically correct doctrinal statement before doing the memory task. Although we can learn more complex concepts, especially with the help of literacy and institutionalized religious instruction, it doesn't take much for us to revert to minimally counterintuitive concepts. We find it natural to conceptualize the gods as superknowing, superpoweriul, and morally interested. It takes special cognitive support, however, to master the concept of the trinity or to grapple with traits such as those that are peculiar to the classical conception of God in the Platonic or Aristotelian traditions. Even when we come to understand these more involved con- ceptions of the divine, we will not necessarily employ them in everyday religious reasoning. Popular religion and religions cross-culturally show a pull towards a pragmatically relevant superagent or a set of such agents. The question for Christian theology is how a pragmatically relevant super- agent could relate to the traditional notion that there is a knowledge of God had by all persons independent of any special revelation. 2. Aquinas and Calvin on the Natural Knowledge of God In the Christian theological tradition, there is a long history of affirm- ing that some knowledge of God is possessed by all human beings. Such knowledge, however, is supposed to be limited or corrupted in a way that makes room for revelation to have a special role. The touchstone for this doctrine is the first chapter of Paul's letter to the Romans, which claims both that God's "invisible attributes are clearly seen" in general but that humans' "foolish hearts were darkened." Thus, there is supposed to be</page><page sequence="8">406 ADAM GREEN something positive and something negative to say about the capacity of human beings to gain knowledge of God without special divine help. The- ologians have explicated the positive and negative aspects of this natural knowledge in different ways. Thomas Aquinas and John Calvin stand out, in particular, as fountainheads of two very different ways of thinking about the natural knowledge of God and of accounting for the positive and negative aspects of this knowledge. Despite their differences, we will find that something they have in common is in tension with the claim of CSR that religious cognition is subserved by social cognition and not a domain-general power of abstract thought. Interestingly, both Aquinas and Calvin look to philosophy as an example that allows one to explicate what the positive and negative aspects of the natural knowledge of God are. For Aquinas, philosophy helps us to understand what can be said in favor of the natural knowledge of God in general, and, for Calvin, philosophy is an excellent example of what gets in the way of and corrupts the natural knowledge of God in general, namely the vanity of human reason operating under its own power. Aquinas affirms that the contemplative use of reason, such as that exemplified in philosophy, reaches some truths about God but that revela- tion is required to go farther. The Greek philosophical tradition in particular provides an accurate but limited picture of God for Aquinas. In response to the question whether sacred doctrine is the same as wisdom, Aquinas replies that sacred doctrine is above human wisdom, and he clar- ifies the relationship: But sacred doctrine essentially treats of God viewed as the highest cause - not only so far as He can be known through creatures just as philosophers knew Him - "That which is known of God is manifest in them" (Romans 1:19) - but also as far as He is known to Himself alone and revealed to others. (Aquinas ST, la, Ql, A6) Aquinas claims that the philosophers do know something about God, what reason can lay hold of by itself, and this use of reason that philoso- phy exemplifies is identified with what the Apostle Paul has in mind in Romans 1. Consider also what Aquinas says later when discussing the vice of curiosity and distinguishing this vice from philosophy. The study of philosophy is in itself lawful and commendable, on account of the truth which the philosophers acquired through God revealing it to them, as stated in Romans 1:19. (ST lib, Q 167, Al, ad3)</page><page sequence="9">COGNITIVE SCIENCE AND KNOWLEDGE OF GOD 407 Once again then, Aquinas associates the truths that philosophy can reach about God with Romans 1. The claim is not necessarily that only philosophers can have such knowledge. In his commentary on the book of Romans, Aquinas claims that what is at issue in Romans 1 is "what can be known about God by men through reason" (Lect 6, set 114, pg 63). Thus, one must suppose that philosophy is associated with Romans 1 in the Summa because it is being identified with the skillful employment of human reason. Qualifying the importance of philosophy to the natural knowledge of God by relating it to human reason in general does not make such knowledge available to all human persons. Aquinas is clear that part of the need for revelation resides in the inaccessibility of knowledge of God obtained using reason alone. It was necessary for man's salvation that there should be a knowledge revealed by God besides philosophical science built up by human reason. Firstly, indeed, because man is directed to God, as to an end that surpasses the grasp of his reason. . . . Even as regards those truths about God which human reason could have discovered, it was necessary that man should be taught by a divine revelation; because the truth about God such as reason could discover, would only be known by a few, and that after a long time, and with the admixture of many errors. (ST la, Ql, Al) Aquinas does affirm that there is some innate sense of God's exis- tence that is universal, but he associates it with the universal desire for happiness à la Aristotle. To know that God exists in a general and confused way is implanted in us by nature, inasmuch as God is man's beatitude. For man naturally desires hap- piness, and what is naturally desired by man must be naturally known to him. This, however, is not to know absolutely that God exists; just as to know that someone is approaching is not the same as to know that Peter is approach- ing, even though it is Peter who is approaching; for many there are who imagine that man's perfect good which is happiness, consists in riches, and others in pleasures, and others in something else. (ST la, Q2, Al, adi) God is, in fact, that in which humans can find happiness, so, in desir- ing happiness, humans desire God. This is a far cry from an awareness of God as either an extranatural agent or an unmoved mover, however, and it looks like the natural knowledge of God with real cognitive bite, for Aquinas, is gotten through the philosophical use of reason.3 Contemplat- ing the unmoved mover involves greater insight into God's nature than dreaming about riches and pleasures.</page><page sequence="10">408 ADAM GREEN Aquinas, then, has a notion of the natural knowledge of God that associates this knowledge with that capacity of human reason that is used to do philosophy. The truths available through natural knowledge are those captured by the Greek philosophical tradition. Aquinas's account is clearly in some tension with the claim of CSR that religious cognition is a species of social cognition and that social cognition lacks the abstract, domain-general character that one should suppose Aquinas had in mind. John Calvin, one might think, has an account of the natural knowledge of God more consonant with the findings of CSR. Calvin would likely take as his point of departure Aquinas's dim view of the pre-reflective human awareness of God and Aquinas's affir- mation of the circumscribed accuracy of human reason. For Calvin, the innate sense of the divine is what gives us a good, if limited, picture of the divine, and it is a human being's use of reason that is the poor instrument for discerning the divine nature. The use of human reason one sees in phi- losophy is not the pathway to natural knowledge of God, according to Calvin, but rather the example par excellence of why we fall short of even that degree of natural knowledge that should be available to us. For Calvin, God outfits everyone with the wherewithal to know that there is a God, especially in the evident craftsmanship of creation. The problem, however, is a kind of blindness or willed stupidity that occludes one's instinctual knowledge of the existence and moral relevance of a creator. In the Institutes, Calvin singles out the philosophers as the group that best illustrates the blindness of the human mind in their failed attempts to grapple with heavenly mysteries. Bright, however, as is the manifestation which God gives both of himself and his immortal kingdom in the mirror of his works, so great is our stupidity, so dull are we in regard to these manifestations, that we derive no benefit from them. . . . Even when under the guidance and direction of [divine works in the natural world], we immediately fly off to carnal dreams and depraved fictions, and so by our vanity corrupt heavenly truth. This far, indeed, we differ from each other, in that every one appropriates to himself some pecu- liar error; but we are all alike in this, that we substitute monstrous fictions for the one living and true God - a disease not confined to obtuse and vulgar minds, but affecting the noblest, and those who, in other respects, are singu- larly acute. How lavishly in this respect have the whole body of philosophers betrayed their stupidity and want of sense ? To say nothing of the others whose absurdities are of a still grosser description, how completely does</page><page sequence="11">COGNITIVE SCIENCE AND KNOWLEDGE OF GOD 409 Plato, the soberest and most religious of them all, lose himself in his round globe? What must be the case with the rest , when the leaders , who ought to have set them an example, commit such blunders, and labour under such hal- lucinations ? (Calvin, Institutes , bk I, ch. 5, 65-66; italics added) Like water gushing forth from a large and copious spring, immense crowds of gods have issued from the human mind, every man giving himself full license, and devising some peculiar form of divinity, to meet his own views. ... I say nothing of the rude and illiterate vulgar; but among the philosophers who attempted, by reason and learning, to pierce the heavens, what shame- ful disagreement! The higher any one was endued with genius, and the more he was polished by science and art, the more spurious was the colouring which he gave to his opinions. All these, however, if examined more closely, will be found to be vain show. (Ibid, 66) For Calvin, philosophy is the example of a human being's best attempt to know God on her own, using her own natural resources. Unlike Aquinas who affirms the goodness and accuracy of philosophy within a circumscribed domain, Calvin sees the works of the philosophers as indicative of human vanity and the squandering of mankind's natural endowment.4 After laying out the shortcomings of the philosophers, Calvin begins the very next section as follows. Hence we must hold, that whosoever adulterates pure religion (and this must be the case with all who cling to their own views), makes a departure from the one God. No doubt, they will allege that they have a different intention; but it is of little consequence what they intend or persuade themselves to believe, since the Holy Spirit pronounces all to be apostates, who, in the blindness of their minds, substitute demons in the place of God. (Ibid, 67) Calvin, then, is very far from Aquinas 's comparatively rosy view of philo- sophical contemplation.5 6 Though insufficient to give a fully nuanced view of the natural knowledge of God in the rich worldviews of either author, I take the fore- going to establish that both Aquinas and Calvin use the notions of philosophy and the philosopher as important tools in thinking about the natural knowledge of God. For both thinkers, philosophy is the example par excellence of the best that human reason can aspire to in grappling with theological truths without special divine aid. For Aquinas, philoso- phy is associated with the truths to which unaided human reason can attain, and, for Calvin, the best that unaided human reason can do, as wit- nessed to by the work of the philosophers, is empty idolatry.</page><page sequence="12">410 ADAM GREEN That both Aquinas and Calvin would take philosophy and the philosopher as such prominent interlocutors should be unsurprising given that, historically, Christian theology is built in dialogue with the Greek philosophical tradition. What the cognitive science of religion suggests, however, is that taking philosophy as one's sparring partner in developing an account of the natural knowledge of God runs the risk of mischarac- terizing the religious impulse that all human beings are supposed to share. Simply put, most religions and most religious people across history do not develop their picture of the world in interaction with an established philo- sophical tradition. In the next section, I will draw attention to the way in which the insights of CSR allow one to critique and reshape the accounts inherited from Aquinas and Calvin. A CSR-infused correction to these perspectives on the natural knowledge of God allows one to make a helpful paradigm shift from a focus on the extent of one's cognitive reach to a focus on different ways of relating to another person. 3. Transposing the Distinction into a Social Key From a CSR-perspective, philosophy and theology are rare cultural achievements. Philosophy and theology as cultural phenomena are likely dependent on literacy and on sufficient prosperity to allow for the culti- vation of expertise in the construction of abstract systems of ideas. The religious impulse of human beings is much more ancient and more wide- spread. Furthermore, from a CSR perspective, religion is thoroughly enmeshed with the social mind being engaged in a pragmatic mode. Though doctrines and practices can be built on the foundations of natural religion and this superstructure of orthodoxy can circumscribe or even contradict natural religion, doing so will require a great deal of cultural scaffolding. To borrow terminology from Robert McCauley (McCauley 201 1), religious cognition that is inherently both social and pragmatic will be "maturationally natural" and any deviation from this type of religious cognition will at best depend on a kind of "practiced naturalness." It is odd, then, to associate either the natural knowledge of God or the vices that occlude this knowledge with as rare a human achievement as philosophical reasoning. The gods of most religions do not bear much similarity to the classical conception of God developed in the Platonic and Aristotelian traditions that Aquinas likely had in mind. If one were to create an average conception of the divine from the diverse extranatural</page><page sequence="13">COGNITIVE SCIENCE AND KNOWLEDGE OF GOD 4 1 1 beings in which human beings have believed, the result would not be an atemporal, simple unmoved mover but one or more superpowerful, super- knowing agents that are in some way or another concerned with our practical affairs. To understand what truths about God human beings may be innately disposed to grasp, it would be more productive to ask how this latter conception aligns with God as one takes him to be revealed in one's tradition rather than how the God of the philosophers measures up to one's tradition. One could maintain with Aquinas that the philosophical route is one way of using natural resources to acquire knowledge about God, but, even so, it will be a little-travelled route compared to the one that utilizes the social mind. Similarly, there is something untoward about affirming that philo- sophical reasoning is a good example of how and why natural means fall short when it comes to knowing God. One could grant Calvin his analy- sis of the shortcomings of the philosophers without coming away with an explanation of why it is that the natural knowledge of God that all people are supposed to have is limited or occluded. Most people have not had the privilege of studying philosophy or indulging in protracted reflection about divine realities. From a CSR perspective, the average person does not spend much time trying to "pierce the heavens" with reason and thus whatever problems beset the average individual are not likely to be the problems that attend such an enterprise. The average person across history has been concerned with very con- crete and pragmatic problems like whether the harvest will be spoilt, whether a disease will be fatal, what is going to happen when he dies, and whether there is any protection available for him from the greed and malice of others beyond his own vigilance and strength. Vanity could be humankind's big obstacle to natural knowledge of God. If so, however, it has to manifest itself in a very different way than it does in philosophy to have the sort of scope that Calvin means it to have, and identifying the way in which philosophers may fall short does not give us a ready means of discerning how vanity is supposed to be manifesting itself in the very different concerns of the average person. From a CSR perspective, one should expect that whatever natural religion gets right and whatever problems it has should both have to do with the social mind. Social cognition is not accomplished by a purely domain-general power of thought. It is specialized and can diverge from</page><page sequence="14">412 ADAM GREEN the sort of competencies that are at the fore when doing philosophy. Given that what religions tend to have in common in their official representations and in the deviations from orthodoxy within those religions both implicate the social mind, one should look there for insight. One can make a beginning by returning to the biblical source text for much of the Christian tradition's reflection on the natural knowledge of God, paying attention to what aspects catch one's attention in the light of CSR. The first chapter of Paul's letter to the Romans says the following. For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men . . . because what may be known of God is manifest in them .... For since the creation of the world His invisible attributes are clearly seen . . . even His eternal power and Godhead, so that they are without excuse, because, although they knew God, they did not glorify Him as God, nor were thankful, but became futile in their thoughts, and their foolish hearts were darkened. Professing to be wise, they became fools, and changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image made like corrupt- ible man and birds and four-footed animals and creeping things. (Romans 1:18-22; NASB) With the state of play in the cognitive science of religion in mind, there are at least five things that stand out in this passage. First, the passage is universal in application. What's being said is not supposed to apply to only a subset of humankind and thus should not be dependent on any unique features of a culture. Second, there is an emphasis on an awareness of what is not visible, which hooks in nicely with CSR's emphasis on tracking the possible presence of hard to detect agents and the effects they leave behind. Third and perhaps more instructively, the traits singled out as repre- senting the content of what human beings are aware of is God's power and God's having a position of rank and authority. It is instructive that, right after noting that people are aware of God's power and Godhead, the passage proceeds to unpack moral implications of this knowledge. This is suggestive of Atran's predator-protector-prey schema and Wilkins's emphasis on the social dominance hierarchy. God is being depicted as at least a powerful agent who bears some social role vis-à-vis human beings that should elicit respect and appreciation, and, as laid out in the previous section, it is not hard to imagine how thinking in terms of protection and social dominance could take on a moral tenor.</page><page sequence="15">COGNITIVE SCIENCE AND KNOWLEDGE OF GOD 41 3 Fourth, the moral failure that is diagnosed is one of ingratitude and a failure to honor God as God. Both vices and their matched virtues are essentially social. The failure is not due to having a higher opinion of one's unaided powers of reason than is warranted so much as it is a kind of slight against an agent that rightly outranks one and has acted as one's benefactor. From a CSR perspective, what is interesting about the vices chosen is that they can be readily made sense of in terms of navigating a social dominance hierarchy with a protector/benefactor at the top, and, within that schema, it only makes sense that the reaction of the socially dominant individual will correspond to what the passage opens with, wrath. Even someone who is only aware of God's power and position of authority should be in a position to be unsurprised by such a reaction given the social dynamics. Fifth, there is an expectation that the awareness of the invisible Christian God will be mixed up with thoughts of various kinds of crea- tures, including creatures like us. Thus, there is supposed to be something right and something wrong about the representations of the divine we form, and what's wrong is supposed to be a tendency to import creaturely characteristics as a direct consequence of failing to relate to God with the appropriate social emotions. The passage conveys an expectation of anthropomorphism and 'zoo-morphism'. Tracking the existence of an invisible benefactor standing behind the order in one's world is supposed to be right, and thinking of this benefactor in humanlike and animal-like terms is where things are supposed to be going wrong. There is a great deal of resonance, then, between the picture of reli- gion one gets in the cognitive science of religion and the principle source text in the Christian tradition for thinking about the natural knowledge of God. Reading the passage through a CSR lens also suggests a way of thinking about the positive and negative aspects of natural knowledge of God different from that of Aquinas and Calvin. When what one has in mind is a domain-general power of thought, it is tempting to think that the essential difference between natural knowledge of God and revelation consists in cognitive reach. On Aquinas 's picture, human reason can reach certain lower-shelf truths about God, but only a metaphysically bigger entity can hand down other, more lofty truths. On Calvin's picture, truths about God's nature are out of the reach of human reason in general, and trying to get at them through reason is an act of hubris borne of misun-</page><page sequence="16">414 ADAM GREEN derstanding just how small one is in the grand scheme of things. Keeping the social mind at the fore allows one to shift from a paradigm centered on cog- nitive reach to one focused on different ways of relating to another person. Social cognition can be engaged in an instrumental mode or in what one could call a relational mode. Taking up social cognition in an instru- mental mode involves pursuing one's private ends in a social environment. Social cognition in a relational mode, in contrast, takes as its end the facilitation of some relational state between oneself and another. Human infants exhibit shared attention in both modes from very early. When they develop pointing behavior, for instance, between nine and twelve months of age, some of it is intended to direct its caregiver toward an object that it wants, but one also sees pointing in the service of sharing an experience of an object (the difference between imperative and declarative pointing is noted at least as early as 1975 [Bates, Camaioni, and Volterra 1975]). In contrast, there is a debate over whether other pri- mates do anything like what human infants do when infants point for the sake of sharing. As Michael Tomasello notes, comparing the pointing behavior of apes with that of human infants, "apes do not produce, either for humans or for other apes, points that serve functions other than the imperative/requestive function" (Tomasello, Carpenter, and Liszkowski 2007, 717). Among creatures that do sometimes point, pointing in order to share is the more rare and distinctively human phenomenon, and pointing in an instrumental mode is the more basic and phylogenetically wide- spread behavior. I want to suggest that, from a 'faith-seeking-understanding' perspec- tive, a way to make sense of the natural knowledge of God is as follows. Human beings have the wherewithal to sense that there is at least one invisible, superpowerful agent who accounts for the order in one's envi- ronment and is a morally interested benefactor. Instead of taking up relational attitudes like gratitude or joy towards this agent or class of agents, however, human beings tend to take up social cognition vis-à-vis invisible agency in an instrumental mode. Whether the interests of the gods and human beings will correspond becomes an open question if one is concerned with one's own private, pragmatic ends instead of relationship with the gods for its own sake. One must divert one's attention to cultivating the involvement of the gods in bringing about ends that the gods might not otherwise share and to pro-</page><page sequence="17">COGNITIVE SCIENCE AND KNOWLEDGE OF GOD 4 1 5 tecting oneself from others manipulating the gods at one's expense. In so doing, thinking about the gods becomes even more similar to the way one thinks about any other powerful agent as one co-opts background infor- mation and schemata from other instances of practical reasoning involving powerful agents. Although background information and schemata can inform social cognition in a direct relational mode, this mode puts less of a premium on prediction and control and more of an emphasis on an open- ness to receiving whatever the other agent wants to convey. This trend toward instrumental social cognition is at odds with relat- ing well to the deity that Christianity posits, who has no needs, no partisanship, and a perpetual desire for relationship with human beings for its own sake. From the perspective of the insider in the Christian tradition, "man's chief end is to glorify God and to enjoy Him forever" as the West- minster catechism famously says, and there is something inherently ludicrous about trying to manipulate the God the tradition endorses. After all, as work within CSR points out, puzzles arise for the notion of peti- tionary prayer precisely because of how odd it is to think that one could engage in activity that would make the Christian God do good things that He would otherwise not do (cf. Boudry and De Smedt 2011). To engage one's mind vis-à-vis the Christian God in an instrumental mode, then, is to betray a deep lack of understanding about the nature of God and the secure and beneficial relationship one could have with him. Thus, it should be unsurprising that a tendency to diverge from a relational to an instrumental mode of social cognition would have negative epistemic repercussions in this case. We can say, then, that, through a CSR-inspired lens, the positive thing to be said about the natural knowledge of God is that it tracks impor- tant features of the divine such that it puts one in a position to recognize the relevance of certain relational responses, namely, those that are due to a socially dominant benefactor and protector. The negative thing to say is that human beings have a tendency to foreground our private, pragmatic interests and, in so doing, to move from a relational mode of social cog- nition vis-à-vis the divine to an instrumental one. In so doing, human beings have a tendency to import schemata that correspond to other earthly creatures and are ill-fitting in the case of God. We, in effect, move from treating God like a benefactor to be honored to treating him like a potential tyrant to be feared and manipulated.</page><page sequence="18">416 ADAM GREEN Thinking of matters with this relational frame allows one to affirm that the old way of thinking about things evidenced by Aquinas and Calvin is partially correct. There are facts one is likely to discover in an intimate relationship that one is not likely to be able to discover from the outside. Relationship should come with better opportunities for observa- tion or to be told things one would otherwise not be able to know. Moreover, whether it be finitude or vain self-reliance, one can take up Aquinas and Calvin's favored explanations of the limits of natural knowl- edge of God into this social framework. A CSR-inspired relational gloss on the natural knowledge of God coheres well with elements of the wider systems of both Aquinas and Calvin. Aquinas, for instance, identifies the telos of humankind as being supernatural (ST Ha, Q5, A3), of consisting in being related to the source of goodness in the beatific vision (ST Supp, Q92, Al). The human condi- tion is one of disorder in the soul (ST IIa, Q82, Al). Lesser, nonrelational goods are prioritized at the expense of greater, relational goods. Moreover, on Aquinas 's view, genuine human virtues are infused. Rather than virtue being something that inheres in the individual taken on her own, human virtues for Aquinas are relational properties in which God stands as one of the relata (ST IIa, Q62, A 1-2). Given this general pattern in Aquinas 's thought, it would make sense that a natural state that operated outside of a relationship with the divine would be limited in ways that would disap- pear once genuine relationship was introduced. The relational account of the natural knowledge of God given here fits neatly into this general pattern of perfection being a matter of proper relatedness.7 In book one of the Institutes, Calvin specifies that the natural knowl- edge of God is restricted in scope. I am not now referring to that species of knowledge by which men, in them- selves lost and under curse, apprehend God as a Redeemer in Christ the Mediator. I speak only of that simple and primitive knowledge, to which the mere course of nature would have conducted us, had Adam stood upright. . . . Since, then, the Lord first appears . . . simply as a Creator, and afterwards as a Redeemer in Christ, - a twofold knowledge of him hence arises. (Bk I, ch. 2,47) Calvin specifies that the natural knowledge of God, even unspoilt, can only get us some of the truths about God that human beings can appre- hend. Others require a certain sort of relationship with the divine, that</page><page sequence="19">COGNITIVE SCIENCE AND KNOWLEDGE OF GOD 417 made possible through the redeeming work of Christ. Thus, Calvin too has in his work a commitment to the idea that the sort of relationship one has with the divine correlates with what facts one is able to know about God. Natural knowledge is more indirect, having largely to do with being able to tell that there is a creator, while revelation furnishes a way of knowing God that is more inherently relational. Thus, the account given here could cohere with Calvin's duplex cognitio Dei. In conclusion, I take the foregoing discussion to show via case study that, rather than being inherently inimical to religion, the cognitive science of religion can actually be used as a tool when doing theology from within the perspective of a faith tradition. It can, in effect, help to clarify religious doctrine from the inside. I have not shown, of course, that this is the only or best use of the cognitive science of religion, and I have not treated the subject matter within that growing field in anything approaching an exhaustive manner. It could be that some parts of CSR are more inherently antireligious than those canvassed here. I take it, however, that, to the extent that my case study is successful, it helps to show that there are multiple uses to which one might put the content in this field, some of which may even enhance a religious understanding of the world.8 Adam Green Azusa Pacific University Notes 1 . Although he might have some quibbles with the prominence given to social cogni- tion in this summary of the field, the pragmatic dimension of religion and its social reasoning comes across especially powerfully in Sorensen (2007). For Sorensen, magic and rituals are primary and the social dimension of religion is secondary to the attempt to control the world through magic. 2. The discussion of "theological correctness," "theological incorrectness," and related terms can be concerned with the relationships within a person or between the laity and authorities in a religion. Conceptually, it is easy to see that these two divisions could vary independently of one another. For example, there could be a perfectly integrated indi- vidual who endorsed her own, more intuitive version of the doctrines advocated by her religious authorities, or someone could recognize no religious authority while having an internal division between one's unreflective and reflective theological commitments. I thank Justin Barrett for drawing my attention to this point.</page><page sequence="20">418 ADAM GREEN 3. Stephen Chanderbhan has pointed out to me that there are places in the Summa Contra Gentiles where Aquinas may give arguments from natural reason to the conclusion that the divine has certain social characteristics, though these arguments are not explicitly related to the natural knowledge of God so far as I am aware. 4. It is worth noting that Calvin is much more complementary of the philosophers when he is discussing things other than their attempts to comprehend the divine nature (cf. bk 2, ch. 2, 226-27). 5. It should be noted, though, that Calvin can be interpreted as having a place in his system for the use of philosophical reason in the contemplation of God, so long as it is done as a means of edifying those who already believe (cf. Sudduth 1995). 6. Calvin's commentary on Romans echoes the same thoughts present in these pas- sages from the Institutes. See, for example, Calvin (1849, 48, 50-51). 7. See Pinsent (201 1) for an interesting relational account of Aquinas's ethics. 8.
