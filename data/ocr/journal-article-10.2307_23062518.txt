<plain_text><page sequence="1">21 MYSTICISM AND APOCALYPTIC IN EZEKIEL's EXAGOGE*' HOWARD JACOBSON As part of his attempt to demonstrate the widespread exist ence of a mystical Judaism in antiquity, Erwin Goodenough turned his attention to Moses1 dream in Ezekiel's Exagoge. Here is the text, followed by Goodenough1s remarks: ΜΩΣΗΣ 68 e&lt;6o&gt;g' όρους κατ' άκρα Σιν&lt;αί&gt;ου θρόνον μέγαν τιν* εΓναι μέχρι 'ς ούρανοϋ πτύχας, έν τφ καθησθαι φωτα γενναϊόν τίνα διάδημ' έχοντα καΐ μέγα σκηπτρον χερί 72 εύωνύμψ μάλιστα, δεξιά δέ μοι ένευσε, κάγώ πρόσθεν έστάθην θρόνου. σκηπτρον δέ μοι πάρδωκε και είς θρόνον μέγαν εΓπεν καθησθαι· βασιλικόν δ' δδωκέ μοι 76 διάδημα και αυτός έκ θρόνων χωρίζεται. έγώ δ' έσεϊδον γην άπασαν έγκυκλον καί δνερθε γαίας καί έξύπερθεν ούρανοϋ, και, μοί τι πλήθος άστέρων πρός γούνατα 80 δπιπτ', εγώ δέ πάντας ήριθμησάμην, κάμοϋ παρηγεν ώς παρεμβολή βροτων. είτ' έμφοβηθείς έξανίσταμ' έ£ δπνου.

The throne... is exactly the divine throne we have met in the Orphic fragment. We have not left the Orphic atmosphere at all... As he counted (the stars) he awoke. Here is unmistakably the divine kingship of Moses set forth, a kingship not only over men but over the entire cosmos. He is in the place of God!... The conception of God has come directly from Orphic sources, and the idea is, as Cerfaux has pointed out, the astral mystery of Egypt. Moses' nature is taken up to associate itself with the nature of the stars. Here then is a picture of a "mystic Moses" which splendidly supports Goodenough's general theory. Unfortunately,</page><page sequence="2">Howard Jacobson 273 Goodenough's description is not consistent with Ezekiel's text. His starting point is an Orphic hymn in which inter alia God is described as sitting on a throne of gold on high 2) with his feet resting upon the earth. The solitary simi larity between the two texts is the presence of "God" sitting on a throne on high, a picture thoroughly familiar from the Bible. Neither the golden character of the throne nor even the notion of God using the earth as a footstool (cf. Isa. 66:1) is present in Ezekiel. Indeed, the latter's descrip tion of God on his throne is as straightforwardly simple as could be. As for Moses' kingship over the entire cosmos, the astral mystery and Moses' association with the nature of the stars, all this is quite foreign to the tone and tenor of the text. On the matter of the "kingship of the cosmos" Goodenough is patently reading Philo into Ezekiel (cf. Moses 1.155ff). That Moses beholds the cosmos does not mean he is made master of it."^ Indeed, Raguel's interpretation of the dream makes not the slightest allusion to such a possibility. Further, Ezekiel distinctly limits the obeisance to a xt TiAfidos daripcov, which does not seem equivalent to "all the stars" nor does he mention the sun and moon. In what sense Moses is associated with the nature of the stars is hard to see, as is the presence of the astral mystery. Is this Orphic and astral or is it a recollection of Joseph's dream wherein stars prostrate themselves before the youth (Gen. 37:9)? It is in general worth noting that most of the Bib lical narrative retold in Ezekiel is also present in Philo, but all the mysticism of the Philonic accounts is lacking in the Exagoge. Indeed, if one compares Ezekiel's dream to other dreams in Jewish literature of the second commonwealth and also to "ascension" scenes (for Moses' vision here belongs to that genre too),^' we may come to conclusions quite different from Goodenough's. We begin with I Enoch 13.7ff.5' Enoch falls asleep and a dream-vision comes to him. In it the stars, clouds and other celestial phenomena carry him heavenward where he beholds splendid and marvelous things: a wall of crystal, tongues of</page><page sequence="3">274 Illinois Classical Studies, VI.2 fire, a crystal house, Cherubim, a house of fire. At this point in the narrative (14.18) the relevance to Ezekiel be comes clearer. I quote verses 18-25.^' And I looked and saw therein a lofty throne; its appearance was as hoarfrost, its circuit was as a shining sun and the voices of cherubim. And from underneath the great throne came streams of flaming fire so that it was impossible to look there on. And the Great Glory sat thereon and His raiment shone more brightly than the sun and was whiter than any snow. None of the angels could enter and behold the face of the Honoured and Glorious One and no flesh could behold Him. A flaming fire was round about Him, and a great fire stood before Him, and none of those who were around Him could draw nigh Him: ten thousand times ten thousand were before Him, but He stood in no need of counsel. And the holiness of the holy ones, who were nigh to Him, did not leave by night nor depart from Him. And until then I had had a veil on my face, and I was trembling: then the Lord called me with His own mouth and spake to me: "Come hither, Enoch, and hear My holy word." And he made me rise up and approach the door: but I turned my face downwards. Here is the lofty throne with God upon it, here too the in vitation to the mortal being to approach the divinity. Yet, the atmosphere, the tone, the very conception is totally different. In Enoch we are in a world of thoroughly super natural phenomena replete with the panoply of mysticism. There is nothing in the description that has a counterpart in the earthly sphere, nothing that is susceptible of recog nition by the human mind. In contrast, Ezekiel's account is almost all replica of the earthly scene. Even the one excep tion, Moses' vision of the cosmos, does not greatly differ from a description of the view from a mountain-top. Its stark simplicity and its closeness to reality can also be appreciated by a comparison with later parts of Enoch's vi sions. Thus, at 33.2-4, Enoch too sees and counts the stars. But how different is the account: I saw the ends of the earth whereon the heaven rests, and the portals of the heaven were open. And I saw how the stars of the heaven come forth, and I counted the portals out of which they proceed, and wrote down all their outlets; of each indi vidual star by itself, according to their number, their names, their connexions, their positions, their times and their months, as the holy angel Uriel who was with me showed me. He showed all things to me and wrote them down for me: also their names he wrote for me, and their laws and their companies. Even this is but a pale reflection of the depiction of the heavenly luminaries at chapters 72-82, a spectacularly</page><page sequence="4">Howard Jacobson 275 elaborate recounting of Enoch's visions of the sun, the moon, the wind, the stars, etc., with a lengthy description of the stars at 82.10ff. So too the vision of chapter 71, another translation of Enoch to heaven, is replete with sons of God, flakes of fire, faces like snow, revelations of all the secrets, crystal structures, Seraphim, Cherubim, Ophanim, throne of glory, millions of angels, the Head of Days and the Son of Man. Lastly, Enoch's dream at chapter 85 where, like Moses, he sees stars falling from the heaven. These prove to be the fallen angels7' In Moses' dream the stars, though in a sense personified, are never anything but stars. If this is of any import, then it may suggest that Ezekiel's account, rather than representing the astral mystery, is polemic against the deification or angelization of the stars. And if any gener alization at this point is in order in light of the compari son with I Enooh, it is the following: Ezekiel's version of the ascension-type vision is a demythologization of the Enoch-type. Many of the elements are held in common, but in Ezekiel they are, so to speak, naturalized. What makes his treatment significant and noteworthy, however, is not merely that it is in principle so different from I Enooh, but that the conceptions present in Enoch were common and widespread, even if not always set forth in so extreme a fashion as in Enooh. The culmination, of course, comes later, in such works like Midraeh Ketappuach where Moses himself turns into fire on his ascent8' and 3 Enooh and other works of the developed Mer kabah mysticism. But Enochian elements are not that unusual even earlier. Thus, descriptions of heavenly ascents in Pesiqta Rdbbati 20 and Apoo. Abr. 15ff depict the translation g) in terms of thrones of fire, angelologies and the like. On the other hand, there are accounts which are closer to Ezekiel. A passage in the Testament of Levi, while more extravagant than Ezekiel in some respects, is even barer in others. Thus, Levi (2.5ff; 5.Iff) falls asleep and sees himself on a high mountain (precisely as in the Exagoge). The heavens open and he enters, which takes the ascension beyond the point Ezekiel is willing to go, at least in such explicit terms. Later, Levi beholds God on his throne of glory and God speaks</page><page sequence="5">276 Illinois Classical Studies, VI.2 to him.10' At Gen. Rab. 44.12 we are told no more than that God elevated Abraham above the heavens, showed him the stars below and asked him to attempt to count them (similarly LAB 18.5). What is of special import ance here is that we have a conflict that centers around differing atti tudes to certain Biblical texts. Visions or descriptions of God are common in the Bible, ranging from the sparsest delineation to highly elaborate ones. Notable among the latter are the visions of Isaiah, Ezekiel and Daniel. In these, which portray God on his throne accompanied by all manner of heavenly beings, fire, etc. (Isa. 6; Ezek. 1; Dan. 7), lie the seeds of the Enoch-type vision and of the Merkabah mysticism. On the other hand there are simple assertions like that of Amos (9:1), "I saw the Lord standing by the altar and He said". Or the slightly more elaborate one at I Kings 22:19, "I saw the Lord seated on His throne, with all the host of heaven in attendance." One wonders whether I Kings 19:llff is a rejection of the elaborate descriptions of God's presence. Straightforward allusions to God on His throne also occur (e.g., Ps. 47:9). I think it fair to say that, whereas I Enoch took the path of the prophet Ezekiel which was leading toward Merkabah mysticism, the tragedian Eze kiel rejected it in favor of the attitude which de-emphasized the mystical and apocalyptic aspects of the vision of God, which, so to speak, allowed it purely anthropomorphic expression and would not go further, tSetv Y&amp;P 5iHv xf|V &amp;ui"lxa.VOV as Ezekiel later writes (101).11' It is probable that the heavenly ascension theme in Jewish literature has its roots and beginnings in the Biblical ac count of the revelation on Sinai, whether or not this event is strictly speaking an ascension. For though the text sim ply tells of Moses' climbing of Mount Sinai and his receiving there of the Law from God, there are enough vague suggestions in the narrative that probably well served later writers in their establishment of this theme. Moses, Aaron and the elders are said to see God and some sort of splendid vision under God's feet (Exod. 24:9). After Moses ascends the moun tain, it is covered by a cloud. Six days later God's glory settles on the mountain-top and Moses enters the cloud. The vision of God, the ascent, the entry into the cloud with God's presence are all the seeds of the later heavenly ascension 12) motif. But for Ezekiel this episode (Exod. 24:9-18) is not merely the parent of the genre but the direct impetus</page><page sequence="6">Howard Jacobson 277 for his own work. Totally different though the substance may be, we can scarcely doubt that in describing an ascent by Moses on a mountain culminating in a confrontation with God Ezekiel was directly influenced by the Biblical epi sode.13' We possess a number of texts which recount a heavenly ascension by Moses, for instance, Pesiqta Rabbati 20, Genesis Rabbati pp. 136-7 (Albeck) , Ma'yan Hokhnah (Jellinek 1.58-61), 2 Baruch 59.3, 3 Enoch, the Samaritan Death of Moses, Petirat Mosheh (lerushalayim shel Ma'alah: Jellinek 6. xxii-xxiii) . Other sources imply such an ascension, including Philo QE 2.44, the title of the work Assumption of Moses and perhaps Josephus 14) at AJ 3.137. Some treat Moses' ascension at the time of the giving of the Law, others the ascension granted him be fore his death. What is crucial is that all speak of a real ascension, not a visionary one. None reports his ascension as a dream. Had he wanted, Ezekiel too could have easily represented the ascension as real by simply changing a few words at the beginning and end of Moses1 account and having him describe the event as an actual occurrence. In other words, Ezekiel deliberately chose to portray the "ascension" as an imaginary event. How strongly he felt the importance of this may be illustrated by one fact. As far as I know, nowhere else in ancient Jewish literature is Moses said to have had a significant dream. In the Bible, in Rab binic literature and in apocryphal texts such dreams are commonplace. Joseph, the patriarchs, Daniel, Nebukhadnezzar, Miriam (LAB 9.10) and many others dream. But never Moses. The reason is not hard to find: "If there be a prophet among you, I the Lord will make myself known to him in a vision and will speak to him in a dream. My servant Moses is not so. He is faithful in all my house. With him I will speak mouth to mouth, openly, and not in dark speeches; and the similitude of the Lord he will behold" (Numbers 12:6-8). In spite of this explicit declaration in the Bible, Ezekiel felt compelled to turn Moses' ascension into a dream. Is this not then a conscious rejection on Ezekiel's part of the legend that Moses actually ascended to heaven, beheld God, perhaps</page><page sequence="7">278 Illinois Classical Studies, VI. 2 sat on the heavenly throne, etc.? We know that later on some Rabbis had the same qualms. R. Akiva was unwilling to grant that the divine cloud had descended on and covered Moses, lest it lend a superhuman aura to Moses' being. Josephus' account of Moses' death appears to express the same sort of fear with regard to legends of ascension sur rounding Moses' death. There was a midrashic theme that (on his ascension) God revealed to Moses 11 (inV nn cas"? nn ηρη"7 nn nn ni'nV vny nrn Π'Π» nn(a striking echo of Moses' dream and Raguel's interpretation)17' or, as S Enoch puts it, D'iinnn 'nn D'ai'Vy 'ni (48c4) and D'ji'Vy nj'n (48d8) , "ION or elsewhere i"7 'ii'Va nunm n^ynau nn "73. All this revelation and knowledge is now made no more than the sub stance of a dream. Another midrashic passage appears, like Ezekiel, to be aware of the tradition that Moses received this special revelation from God, but also rejects it. Exodus Rabbah 3.1 says that had Moses not turned his head away God 19) might have taught him nm π&gt;π0 πμ non^ nm n'jyn'? nn fi7 π *7 Tny» . How Ezekiel further incorporates, yet modifies, the traditional material is fascinating. For the other texts distinguish between the mystical knowledge of "above and below" and that of "past and future." Ezekiel, by virtue of the symbolic nature of the dream, can have Moses see (in the dream) what is above and what is below and then have it inter 20) preted temporally, as knowledge of past and future, thus granting Moses the gift of prophecy but denying him knowledge 2i \ of the divine mysteries of the universe. One more point in this regard. Commentators routinely understand the 22) dream to portray Moses' presentation before God on His divine throne. Precisely because this is widely assumed, one welcomes Gutman's reser 23) vations and indeed his rejection of this view (43-5). He points out that the being on the throne is called φως (70), a word which indis putably means "man," not "God" (though it is used sometimes of "heroes"). Consequently, Gutman argues that the man should be identified as Enoch who, as Gutman shows, was at times in Jewish tradition portrayed as God's 24) agent who leads Moses to heaven. Well taken as this is, one still has reservations. Most important, had Ezekiel wanted his audience to under</page><page sequence="8">Howard Jacobson 279 stand that this figure was Enoch-Metatron, he would have said so - or at least in some way made it clearer than it is. One can rest assured that no audience would have recognized Enoch in this scene without being so informed. Further, when Gutman not merely rejects the possibility that God is meant here, but also refuses to admit the presence of a "divine being" he seems to go too far. Nor need he. For Enoch-Metatron himself is virtually a divine sort of being. The setting of the dream with mountain-top reaching into the heavens, the vision of above and below, the presence of the stars doing obeisance - all this renders it hard to believe that that audience would not have taken this as a divine setting, if not necessarily an epiphany. In addition, it is common tradition, both in Greek and Jewish texts, that a divine personage appears in human form, especially in dreams and 25) visions. Here in particular one suspects that the significance and force of the dream and its interpretation may depend on the divine nature of the figure on the throne. Thus, on the one hand divine, on the other φώς. Ezekiel meant this figure to be divine, yet represents him as a man because he was deliberately rejecting the traditions which granted Moses physical contact with God, which allowed God to be seen and de scribed in His "divine" form. Once again Ezekiel takes the bare anthro pomorphic route. What Ezekiel describes is simply a φώς, yet this φώς is in some sense divine, most probably a surrogate for the Deity Himself. Mysticism has also been detected in a second scene of the Exagoge, that of the burning bush. At verse 99 God reveals to Moses the divine nature of the speaker, 6 6' έκ βάτου σοι 2 c \ θείος έκλάμπευ λόγος. Kuiper ' has argued that θείος λόγος here is the specialized and significant term that is familiar from Philo, namely the notion of a personification or hypo statization of God, an intermediary between God and the 27\ 28) world. ; Wieneke rejected this view, but it has been taken up with a vengeance by recent scholars, most notably by Goodenough in his attempt to establish Ezekiel as a fore Ο Q \ runner of Philo. Moses "met the Divine Logos." "The fire in the bush is the Divine Logos shining out upon him." In Goodenough's footsteps, Meeks goes so far as to use Ezekiel's account to support his interpretation that Philo's Moses sees the Logos of God at the bush, believing this confirmed by Ezekiel's θειος λόγος.30'</page><page sequence="9">280 Illinois Classical Studies, VI.2 Probably the single most cogent argument on behalf of the Goodenough view is that of Kuiper's, that the Biblical narra tive on which Ezekiel is based reports ώφθη 6t αύτψ Αγγελος κυρίου έν φλογί τιυρώς εκ τοϋ βάτου (Exod. 3:2). Thus, when Ezekiel writes ό 6' έκ βάτου σοι θείος έκλάμπει λόγος it appears that he is merely substituting one designation for another, but each is meant to represent some kind of inter mediary between man and God who represents God. Thus, as Goodenough would write, the Divine Logos. But I think this point not so cogent as it appears on first glance. Ezekiel may have wanted to avoid the revelation of an άγγελος because of the potential problem it might have raised for the pagans in the audience and for the difficulty it would have created in the staging, since, as angels are routinely visible in Scripture, he would have felt compelled to represent this being on stage (this is not a problem at verse 159). Further, Ezekiel may have eliminated the angel here because he did not want to become entangled in the apparent contradiction in the Biblical text, for no sooner does the Bible tell us that an angel appeared to Moses from the bush (3:2) than it reports that God Himself spoke to Moses from the bush (3:4). By ignoring the angel Ezekiel avoided getting involved in some such apparent internal contradiction. Further, there are compelling - if not decisive - considerations which suggest that the evidence is entirely too flimsy to justify jumping to so serious and significant a conclusion as Goodenough's. In the first place, we must remember that there is no reason to believe that the phrase θειος λόγος (or λόγος τοϋ θεοϋ) existed with the Philonia sense some 100 years or more before Philo. The case for such a conclusion rests solely 31) on this sentence in Ezekiel. On the other hand, the phrase θείος λόγος readily lends itself to other meanings. Even in Philo it occurs with other senses. Thus, he writes that the road which is the true philosophy is called θεοϋ £&gt;ημα καΐ λόγος (Post. Cain. 102); also, that when Genesis 26:5 describes Abraham as heeding the instructions of God this is θείος λόγος enjoining us what to do and what not to do (Migr. Abr. 130). At Sorrtn. 1.190 ό θείος λόγος seems virtually to mean</page><page sequence="10">Howard Jacobson 281 "the text of scripture." Thus, not even for Philo himself does θείος λόγος have a solitary and restricted meaning. Moreover, while θείος λόγος does not occur in either the Septuagint or the New Testament, the phrase λόγος τοϋ θεοϋ occasionally is found. In the latter it is the revelation or the message of God, as at John 10:35. The Septuagint uses λόγος θεοϋ interchangeably with λόγος κυρίου, φωνή κυρίου and especially £&gt;ήμα κυρίου as translation of "the word ( in) 32) of God." The fact is that λόγος is used in classical Greek of "divine utterance.In post-Biblical Hebrew texts in and -nm become key words for God's prophecy and revelation and have nought to do with Stoic, Neoplatonic or Philonic Logos, no more than do the terms mn'n anc* ii3'3i&gt; of God. When Targum Neofiti translates Exod. 3:4 with n'"7 mp ■m iPinn this is the routine Targumic paraphrase-translation for "God." There is then nothing unnatural in assuming that Ezekiel's θειος λόγος means plainly and directly "the word of God." Indeed, Philo's own narrative of the bush-scene does not refer to any "Philonic" θειος λόγος, though it is plausible that such may be alluded to. He describes the appearance of a μορφή τις... περικαλλεστάτη in the midst of the flame, a θεο ειδέστατον άγαλμα and observes that one might suppose this to have been είκών τοΰ δντος (Moses 1.66). He is content to leave it as an άγγελος. Since, however, he does refer to the pres ence as είκών τοϋ δντος we must note that at Fuga 100 he states that λόγος θειος is είκών υπάρχων θεοϋ (cf. too Spea. Leg. 1.81). So Philo may indeed have held in mind the possibility that the divine being who appeared in the bush was the θειος λόγος, though he does not explicitly say so. Yet, even this is not certain for Philo and much less so for Ezekiel. More than once Philo states or implies that the θειος λόγος is not sus ceptible of material representation or perception. Thus, he explains (Fuga 100) that the θειος λόγος is not portrayed in the sanctuary (είς δρατήν ουκ ήλθεν ίδέαν) because it is not similar to sense-objects. At Quis Heres 119 the θειος λόγος is Ο g \ said to be Αόρατος. ' This would seem hard to reconcile with 3 7) a μορφή τις... περικαλλεστάτη... άγαλμα. But the difficulty</page><page sequence="11">282 Illinois Classical Studies, VI.2 of such a view is compounded in Ezekiel, for while Philo ignores the Biblical element here of Moses' looking upon God, Ezekiel emphasizes it to a point far beyond the text of the scriptural narrative, an emphasis that is built around con trast: 6 5' έκ βάτου σοι θείος έκλάμπει λόγος. θάρσησον, ω παΐ , καί. λόγων άκου' έμων· ίδεϊν γάρ δψιν τήν έμήν άμήχανον θνητόν γεγώτα, των λόγων 6' 6£εστί σοι. έμων άκούειν, των εκατ' έλήλυθα. (99-103) First, he makes it crystal-clear that it is God and no surrogate, no intermediary, who is speaking here. Then he stresses that Moses may only hear words, but may not see. Moses is permitted audition, but not sight. That is to say, whatever we take έκλάμπει λόγος to signify, it is not pro ductive of an act of sight - nothing divine is being seen here. Moses is granted only hearing. What then should we make of έκλάμπει? For Goodenough and those who share his opinion, the notion of a "shining forth" suits their image 38) of a Philonic mysticism here. ' Wieneke's brief remarks and parallels on this point may in themselves suffice to al leviate all doubts and remove all questions. He accurately observes that (έκ)λάμπω is used in standard Greek writers of sound as well as of sight, and notes passages in Sophocles, Polybius and the following phrase in Aeschylus (PV 21), 39) φωνήν... δψει. Thus, έκλάμπει λόγος in the sense, "the voice-speech-word rings out" is in no way bizzare or defec tive Greek. έκλάμπει λόγος is then a more vivid and graphic version of what Josephus expresses by φωνήν τοΟ πυρός άφέντος 40) (AJ 2.267). The verb έκλάμπει, as Gutman has noted (50), is also suitable because of the context of the burning bush.^^ It is worth adding that this scene is filled with λόγος / λέγειν words referring to speech (100, 102, 104, 109, 113, 114, 117, 120). More remains to be said. As far as I know, there is no example (not even in Philo) of a -λά]1Τΐω verb coupled with the Divine Logos. In a passage which seems to be referring to the episode of the burning bush Philo writes (Migr. Abr. 76) :</page><page sequence="12">Howard Jacobson 283 τό αληθείας φέγγος ήρ£ατο ό θεός ένα στράπτευν αύτψ διά. των έπιστήμης καΐ σοφίας αύτης αθανάτων λόγων which may suggest that God sent forth in a flash the λόγοι which he spoke to Moses at the bush, a view consonant with Philo's sense of the 42) words of God as concrete and physical manifestations. Thus, even though the sense would be peculiar to Philo and his philosophy, we might have to say that even for him the words of God, but not the Divine Logos, would flash out to Moses. If however one assumes, on the basis of Her. 203-5 (cf. Siraoh 24:4), that the guide in the cloud-pillar (.Moses 1.166) is indeed the Logos, then έκλάμτιουσα φέγγος suggests a Logos at once invisible yet capable of radiating light. What is of particular interest in the Exagoge passage is the association of a verb of primarily visual significance with the voice or speech of God in an event intimately tied to the Exodus. For this connection or motif is found both in Philo and in Rabbinic tradition. Its foundation, to be sure, is the Bible itself. We read that at the revelation at Sinai n"7lj7il iin D'JO nyn "731 (Exod. 20:18). The Septuagint translates, έώρα τήν φωνήν. This peculiarity of expression is seized upon by both the Rabbis and Philo for significant 43) explication. One Midrash reads: JIN ΠΙΝ-ΐν 103N "Ή Π1?!}/!» Λ ill 32 .mVipn nx int ...ρ "m* Vipn In more sophisticated fashion Philo observes on three occa 44 ) sions the import of this phrase, e.g., at Moses 2.213: έθέσπισεν... δ θεός διά φωνίϊς - τό παραδοξότατον - όρατης ή... όφθαλμούς ώτων έπήγειρε μδλλον. It seems not unreason able to assume that the oddity of expression in the Biblical text produced a widespread and well known interpretation along the lines indicated in Philo and the Midrash which would have been familiar to the Jewish educated. If so, we can argue that Ezekiel made deliberate use of an acceptable, if a bit unusual, Greek idiom because he saw that it corres 45) ponded to traditional Jewish exegesis. In sum, one cannot finally exclude the possibility that Ezekiel may be describing a kind of Philonic invisible Logos that radiates light. But on balance it seems a quite</page><page sequence="13">284 Illinois Classical Studies, VI.2 unnecessary hypothesis and one feels justified in rejecting . ι . . 46) this view. In the Bible God calls out to Moses, declaring that the spot is holy and announcing Himself as the God of the patri archs. At which point Moses turns away so as not to look at God (Exod. 3:5-6). Ezekiel has much elaborated this simple account: God tells Moses to heed his words, for he may not 47) see God, but only hear his speech (100-103). One senses here Ezekiel addressing his pagan audience who might have wondered why the divinity does not step forward in full splendour and speak, as sometimes happens in Greek drama. To be sure, there are places in Greek drama where the gods are described as unseen, e.g., Athena at Soph. Ajax 14ff is άποπτος, but this simply means that Odysseus at the moment 48) cannot see her. Ion is fearful of seeing the goddess at what is evidently (in his mind) an improper time, but in fact she does appear (Ion 1549-52). Perhaps most striking is Hippolytus 84-6 where Hippolytus declares: μόνψ γάρ έστυ τοϋτ' έμοί γέρας βροτών σοΙ καΐ ξύνει,μι. καί λόγους αμείβομαι, κλύων μέν αύδήν, δμμα δ' ούχ όρων τό σόν. Whatever this means, it surely does not carry with it a no tion of the invisibility of deity; witness the appearance of Aphrodite in the prologue. This is not, however, to deny that some sort of concept of invisibility of deity was held by certain sophisticated or mystically oriented Greeks. Consider the Orphic fragment cited earlier (Kern no. 245) and perhaps the analogy used by Socrates at Xen. Mem. 4.3.13-14. Ezekiel has introduced here Scriptural material not found in the immediately relevant Biblical episode. He is relying on Exod. 33:18ff where Moses asks to see God's glory and the latter responds, Ού δυνήση ίδείν μου τό πρόσωπον ού γά,ρ μή ίδη άνθρωπος τό πρόσωπόν μου καΐ ζήσεται. This clearly cor responds to verses 101-2 of the Exagoge. We should also observe, though I am unsure as to what, if any, inferences ought to be made, that Philo, in an interesting allegorical interpretation of the bush-scene at Fug a 161ff, jumps directly from Moses' desire to approach the bush and God's rejection of this possibility to the answer that God gives Moses in the</page><page sequence="14">Howard Jacobson 285 passage at Exod. 33, the precise line of development that we meet in Ezekiel. We must become briefly involved here in the question of the "seeability" of God in Jewish tradition. It is well known that ultimately the Jewish view of an unsee able and inimitable God became familiar - indeed notorious - to non-Jews. Tacitus' scorn on this count is a prime example {Hist. 5). But to trace the development - if development there be - of this concept is difficult. The Bible itself is filled with passages that render the question vexed: From a passage like that in Exod. 33, which - let it be noted - does not say that God is unseeable but that no man can see him and live, to numerous passages wherein in one degree or another it seems that someone does in fact see God. For instance, in the commission episode at Isa. 6:Iff the prophet says that he has seen God. At Exod. 24;10 a group of Isra elites is said to see God. In other places the non-perceptibility of God seems im paired or logically impossible due to the graphic and physi cal description of Him, e.g., Isa. 29:2ff, 63:lff, Ps. 18:9ff. Indeed, this is a tendency that does not entirely disappear. It is found occasionally in Midrashic literature, as in the tradition that Isaac, on the altar and about to be sacrificed, 49) looked up and saw God. ' But when Goodenough asserts that the invisibility of God is a concept of the New Testament, but not of "normative Judaism" before that time, he is on rather shaky ground.It is true, as Goodenough states, that the notion that a direct vision of God is fatal is not the same thing as God's being αόρατος (as at Col. 1:15, I Tim. 1:17, Heb. 11:27), but then neither is άόρατος inexorably the equivalent of "invisible." "Unseen" and "invisible" are not necessarily one and the same. When Josephus calls the sanctuary (BJ 1.152) and a town (BJ 3.160) αόραχοε, he only means that (up to a particular moment) each had not been seen. In Aristobulos1 Jewish-Orphic text (Kern no. 247) God is not seen but it is hard to determine whether this is because he cannot be or simply is not. It is interesting to note that the original Orphic text declares that God is wrapped in a cloud and so not seen, while the Jewish version says that man is in a cloud and so does not see Him. But the section</page><page sequence="15">286 Illinois Classical Studies, VI.2 concludes by saying that no man could see God eC μή μουνογενής τις άπορρώξ φύλου άνωθεν Χαλδαίων, which in fact seems a reference to Abraham (Moses?) . When the Septuagint revises the Hebrew original so as to remove a direct vision of God (as at Exod. 24:10), it is not possible to ascertain whether this was done to avoid a vision of God without ensuing death or rather to avoid a vision of God as being impossible. When pseudepigraphic works occa sionally make reference to the "unseen God", we are too often unable to determine exactly what this means in a given text, when the text dates from and what chance there is of Chris tian interpolation. Thus, Test. Abr. A 16 mentions δ αόρατος πατήρ and δ άόρατος θεός and Or. Sib. 3.9ffcalls God αόρατος δρώμενος αύτδς απαντα... τίς γάρ θνητός έών κατιδεϊν δύναται θεδν δσσοις, (note too the very similar text at fg. 1.8ff). 52) The same phrase occurs in Rabbinic writings; iima N^l nxn. On the other hand, Test. Zeb. 9.8 records that at the end of time δψεσθε αύτδν [i.e. God] έν 'Ιερουσαλήμ. The combination of the conceptual ambiguity of these texts and the virtual absence of Hebrew and Aramaic Rabbinic texts which can unquestionably be dated to the pre-Christian era leads us inevitably to Philo who is famous for his repeated use of a Hebrew etymology which takes to mean "seeing God", whether based on nm U'K or on something else.^' Israel is, as Philo often puts it, the people that sees God.^' Now for Philo, as he makes abundantly clear, Israel's seeing God has nothing to do with material, visual perception, but is rather a kind of intellectual and spiritual apprehen sion of God."'6' God is not such that he can be visually, physically comprehended. From the brief lines in Ezekiel, it seems that he may represent fundamentally the same opinion as Philo, if not on so subtle and sophisticated a level, that 57 \ God is not susceptible of visual cognition. It is άμή χανον. This is the very term that Philo uses on two occa sions when treating the idea of "seeing God," once indeed in the context of the revelation at the burning bush: έπιδεικνυ μένου έαυτδν τοις γλιχομένοις ίδεϊν, ούχ οιός έστιν - άμήχα νον γάρ, έπ,εΐ καΐ Μωυσής άπέστρεψε τδ πρόσωπον εύλαβεϊτο</page><page sequence="16">Howard Jacobson 287 γά,ρ κατεμβλέψαι ένώπιον του θεοϋ~, ά,λλ' ώς ένεχώρει γενητήν φύσιν τη άπερινοήτψ δυνάμει προσβαλεϊν. (Fuga 141. Cf. Praem. et Poen. 44.) It may then be that this passage in the Exagoge represents our earliest extant evidence for the Jew cox ish doctrine of the "invisibility" of God. APPENDIX: MOSES' THRONE In an interesting article Holladay has recently suggested that the seemingly disconnected facets of the dream and interpretation, namely the royal character of the throne as against the prophetic aspect can be reconciled by realizing that the throne is not the kingly throne, but 59) the mantic one. For this reason the total emphasis of dream and in terpretation is on the future role of Moses as seer. Ezekiel deliberate ly draws Moses in the guise of Apollo so that "Moses replaces Apollo as the spokesman for God; accordingly, the whole of mankind is to seek the divine will not from the oracle of Apollo at Delphi, but from the law of God given to Moses at Sinai." (452) Attractive as this is, it is not likely and the arguments brought in its support are sometimes flawed. Holladay writes, "The dominant image of Raguel's interpretation (lines 20-26) is Moses the prophet" (448). This is false. Only two lines here are relevant, 89 and 86, the former of which clearly speaks of the mantic art, while the latter has nothing to do with it. Holladay offers fuzzy objections, arguing from the absence of βασι λεύε IV terminology and the "somewhat surprising formulation καΐ αύτός βραβεύσεις καΐ καθηγήση βροτων;" (449). But nothing is surprising here. Both βραβεύω and καθηγέομαι are perfectly apt terms for the leader (ruler) of a people. βραβεύς can be a military leader (as at Aesch. Persae 302) or a "judge, arbitrator" or "one who sees that 60) . rules, resolutions and verdicts are carried out, a routine function in antiquity of rulers.^' In the Exagoge itself Raguel is described explicitly as ruler and judge (62-4). καθηγέομαι too is a perfectly suitable word for a ruler, but may have particular relevance to Moses who will "lead" his people out of Egypt. Thus, Raguel's interpretation of the dream is equally divided between Moses the leader and Moses the seer. Further, Holladay skirts the difficulty involved in μέγαν τίν' έξαναστήσείς θρόνον. While it may be possible for a man to set up his own royal power (throne), it seems much less likely for someone to</page><page sequence="17">288 Illinois Classical Studies, VI.2 set up his own mantic status. As Holladay himself notes, it is Zeus who sets Apollo on his mantic throne. Even more problematic is the identification Holladay makes between the Apolline mantic throne and the U^YCtC 0p6vOQ here. First, there is no "mantic throne," but rather the mere tripod upon which the Pythia sat. dp6voe in a mantic context and connected to Apollo would readily be understood as the mantic tripod, but without the context it is doubt ful whether it could be so recognized. Further, how the Apolline tripod could be described as a u^YCXQ &lt;0pcSvOQ &gt; seems hard to fathom. In general, the Greeks would not have associated a throne with Apollo, but with Zeus. This is not to deny that Apollo could be given a throne (cf. Paus. 3.18.9ff), but since Holladay's argument is based on the spectator's act of association, we must admit that the audience would have been quite unlikely to see the throne as a reflection of Apollo and the mantic art. Of equal difficulty for Holladay's thesis is the transmission of crown (PaoiAlHcSv, no less) and sceptre in Moses' dream. This suits a king much more readily than a seer and is what Thucydides calls TOU axi"|TlTpOU Txapd.600LQ (1.9).^' Why then is Raguel's interpretation so skimpy on the "royal" side and perhaps more heavily weighted in the man tic area, when the opposite seems true in the dream itself? The answer is patent. The royal aspect of the dream is straightforward and simple and requires no elaborate interpretation. The mantic aspect is not so clearcut and demands more detailed attention. Two final points on the broad implications that Holladay sees here. First, the identification of Moses with Apollo (or the replacement of the latter by the former). Ezekiel would have had no inclination to make such an identification nor would he have felt it useful or suitable vis a-vis his pagan audience. Moses is a human being and no more. This is true both in the Bible and in the Exagoge. Apollo is, of course, a god. Thus, besides Ezekiel's own feelings on the matter, his audience would probably have neither understood nor appreciated such an "identification." Finally, when Holladay speaks of Ezekiel's replacing the Delphic pro nouncements with the law given at Sinai, let us remember that all evid ence suggests that the Exagoge did not include the revelation at Sinai nor could he have expected the pagan audience to make a mental leap from the mere mention of Sinai (if such there even is, which is doubtful) to the giving of the law at Sinai without some explicit indication of such in the play. Let us also remember that in the scene of the burning bush</page><page sequence="18">Howard Jacobson 289 (at Sinai in the Bible. Ezekiel mentions no name in our fragments) Ezekiel leaves out God's prophecy that the Israelites on leaving Egypt would come to that place to worship (.Exod. 3:12). It is true, as Holla day has well noted, that the language of Moses' seerhood at 89 δψε l τά 63) τ' δντα τά τε τχρδ τοϋ τά θ' ύστερον is that of the Greek mantic, but this is merely one additional example of how freely Ezekiel floats between the Jewish and Greek traditions, for while the idiom is indeed Greek, the conception involved is, as illustrated above, solidly in the Jewish tradition.

Goodenough, By Light Light: The Mystic Gospel of Hellenistic Judaism (New Haven 1935) 290. In all this he is elaborating the briefer exposition of L. Cerfaux who speaks of Moses' initiation into the astral mysteries and his participation in the power and knowledge of God. The dream, in Cerfaux' view, is nothing but the theophany of the burning bush in a different guise. See Recueil Lucien Cerfaux vol. 1 (Gembloux 1954) 85-88 (originally published at Museon 37 (1924) 54-8). Even earlier F. Momigliano, Nuova Rassegna 1 (1893) 313 had seen the influence of "filo sofia cabalistica" here. The Cerfaux-Goodenough view has followers. J. A. Sanders, Discoveries in the Judaean Desert of Jordan IV (Oxford 1965) 62, writes of the scene in the Exagoge, "the Orphic god appears to Moses in a dream." This is repeated uncritically from Sanders by R. Meyer in Josephus-Studien, ed. O. Betz (Gottingen 1974) 296. A.-M. Denis, Introduction aux PseudSpigraphes Grecs d'Ancien Testament (Leiden 1970) 274 has Moses receiving "la science meme de Dieu, principalement celle des astres," a sort of initiation into the astral liturgy. It is hard to see how one can get this, either directly or indirectly, from Ezekiel's text. Astral and mystical elements are much more readily seen in Joseph and Asenath. See H. C. Kee, SBL 1976 Seminar Papers (Missoula 1976) 184-6. For Philo's account of Moses1 initiation into the great mysteries, see LA 3.100ff. It bears little or no similarity to the description in Ezekiel. 2) See Kern fragments 245 and 247. 3) No more than Scipio's wonderful vision of the stars and cosmos makes him master of the universe (Cic.

Wertheimer, Batei Midra shot (Jerusalem 1968^) 1.277, sect. 2. 9) Cf. 2 Enoch 20.3ff. Apoc. Abr. 18ff has some striking similarities, including the mountain, throne, panorama of great expanses, the stars, the vision of past and future. But for all the similarities in points of detail, the complexity and elaborateness of the lengthy description in Apoc. Abr. make it quite distinct from Ezekiel's dream. 10) w. A. Meeks, The Prophet-King (Leiden 1967 = NT Supp. v. 14) no tices parallels to the dream's content in Daniel, Test. Levi and 2 Enoch (148) but does not remark the even more significant differences (not to mention the differences between the Enoch, Daniel and Test. Levi passages themselves). 11) If Ezekiel's account of Moses' dream is consciously anti-apoca lyptic, this would lend support to a date from the second half of the second century B.C. since it was only the middle of that century that saw the beginning of the flowering of apocalyptic literature. 12) Compare how Philo exploits this scene for his own mystical pur poses (Moses 1.158-9; Post 14). 13) The "non-mystical" character of Ezekiel's description may be ap preciated by contrasting it to Philo's observation that Moses' ascent at Exod. 24 is his divinization (QE 2.40). 14) See too Targ.

Gaster, The Asatir (London 1927) 303 remarks that in the Sama ritan story of the death of Moses (Ibid. 319) the description of Moses lifted up and beholding "the whole world, as it were, under his feet, is strongly reminiscent of the wonderful vision of the Hellenist poet Eze kiel." In truth, it is not and may shed more light by its contrast to Ezekiel. I note with puzzlement that J. D. Purvis (in Studies in the Testament of Moses, ed. G. W. E. Nickelsburg, Jr (Cambridge Mass. 1973) 98 n. 10) makes the same observation as Gaster when speaking of the episode in Memar Marqah. But as he himself notes, indeed with reference to Gaster's edition of the "Death of Moses", the latter is basically an abridgement of Memar Marqah 5.2-3. Yet, he gives no indication he is merely repeating Gaster's old view. 21) One might object that since in the Exagoge Moses is at this point of the play not yet God's prophet, there could not be a direct encounter between him and God, certainly not a genuine ascension with the revela tion of the mysteries of the universe. But Ezekiel could have deferred the ascension and revelation till later in the play and thereby given Moses a real ascension, while presenting here a mere omen to forecast Moses' later role as king and seer. That he did not do so but rather cast it all as a dream suggests he had an ulterior motive. 22) Thus, B. Snell, Szenen aus griechischen Dramen (Berlin 1971) 179 writes, "ein edler Mann (d.h. Gott)." Meeks (supra n. 10) 148, "Can be no other than God himself." 23) Cf. too M. Hadas, Hellenistic Culture (New York 1959) 99, "a royal personage." 24) But Gutman's association of Enoch with Mount Sinai on the basis of Jub. 4:25-6 is not admissable. 25) This goes back to the three "men" (angels) who appear to Abraham in Genesis 18. The following passages in pseudepigraphic texts refer to divine agents as men, 2 Enoch 1, Joseph and Asenath 14.4ff, Apoc. Abr. 10. 26) K. Kuiper, Mnemosyne n.s. 28 (1900) 251 and at much greater length RSA 8 (1904) 79-87. 27) Cf. D. A. Schlatter, Geschichte Israels von Alexander dem Grossen bis Hadrian (Stuttgart 1925^) 215, who argued that Ezekiel's SetoQ A.6yOQ was a reflection of popular Stoic beliefs. 28) G. B. Girardi, Di un Dramma Greco-Giudaico nell'Eth Alessandrina (Venice 1902) 11 had already argued against the view that the phrase proved that Ezekiel was either Christian or from the Christian era. He concluded that XdyOQ here meant "speech." 29) Supra n. 1, 290f. 30) Supra n. 10, 156f. 31) There is no reason to believe that \6yOQ Seuos in the Orphic text 245K and in its Aristobulean version 247K means anything other than "the word of God." At any rate, the difficulties in dating these texts and sorting out the layers of interpolation are enormous. For a thorough discussion of these problems, see N. Walter, Der Thoraausleger Aristobu los (Berlin 1964) 202-261. Goodenough's treatment of these texts in By Light Light totally ignores all the critical questions of dating, strata of interpolation, etc. Walter seems not to know either Goodenough's</page><page sequence="21">292 Illinois Classical Studies, VI.2 discussion or Gutman's lengthy study of Aristobulos in his Beginnings vol. I (Jerusalem 1958) 186-220. The text at Eus. PE 667a-668b may pro vide evidence that Aristobulos identified Wisdom/Light with the Logos, but it is not sufficiently clear. 32) On pfftja, see E.

Lieberman, Greek in Jewish Palestine (New York 1942) 165-7. 35) The matter is of course further complicated by the question of the audience for whom Philo intended this work. 36) In the phrase ets 6fe A6yov detov 0A£l|ia£ at Orph. 245. Kern eiQ... PX^iJjaQ is to be taken, I imagine, in the sense "attend to" "have regard for." A&lt;5yos deiOQ presumably means simply "word of God." 37) One must however remember that Philo was capable of describing the Logos in material terms. Thus, it has spatial extension at Plant. 9. At Cher. 30 A6yos is hot and fiery (cf. voug at Fuga 134). Thus, we should be wary of demanding from Philo strict consistency of language here. 38) He might perhaps have cited Quis Heres 264, cpcos x6 deuov em. . But cf.

The "parallels" that he brings with reference to the Logos, the plague and the conflict between Jewish and Egyptian wisdom simply have nothing to do with the bush-scene in the Exagoge. Nor do they seem to be relevant to anything else in the play. 46) It is instructive to observe that A. F. Dahne, Gesohiahtliahe Darstellung der judisch-alexandrinischen Religions-Philosophie vol. 2 (Halle 1834), has a brief discussion of Ezekiel's religious thought (200, n. 157) which clearly indicates that it never occurred to him - nor would he have tolerated the view - that Ezekiel was here delving into the Philonic mysteries of the Logos. 47) For auditory divine revelations one may compare Apoo.
