<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Sabbath of the Land in the Holiness Legislation: Combining Priestly and Non-Priestly Perspectives JEFFREY STACKERT The University of Chicago Chicago, IL 60637 Amid otherwise differing details, one of the most consistent characteristics of the biblical Sabbath is its human-centeredness, a feature potentially obscured by the prominence of the Sabbath's inauguration at the close of the Priestly creation account. Genesis 2:1-3 describes the deity's cessation after six days of creation, thereby establishing, at least canonically, a precedent for understanding Sabbath across the biblical text. This view is epitomized in the Decalogue (Exod 20:11) and in the Priestly Sabbath law (Exod 31:17), where the deity's cessation from creation is the essence of and explicit motivation for Israelite Sabbath observance. However, there is no indication in the Priestly source that the Israelite deity ever observes Sabbath cessation apart from the day that follows the creative burst in Genesis 1 . Moreover, the establishment of the Sabbath at creation originates in the Priestly mind and is not normative across the biblical canon or even the Torah sources. What is virtually uniform, though, in the various biblical presentations of the Sabbath is its basic application to human activity. The numerous biblical pro- hibitions against work on the Sabbath day are directed toward humans, and even the animal rest occasionally highlighted in Sabbath rules (Exod 20:10; 23:12; Deut 5: 14) is secondary to and controlled by humans and their own labor cessation. Such consistency in the envisioned legal agent of the Sabbath command - even among other varying legal details - makes the deviation from this norm in Leviticus 25-26 (and its reflex in 2 Chr 36:21) particularly remarkable. I am grateful to Baruch J. Schwartz, Tzvi Abusch, and Anne K. Knafl for their critical com- ments on earlier versions of this essay. Any errors, of course, are my own. 239</page><page sequence="2">240 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY | 73,2011 In Leviticus 25, H reorients Sabbath with regard to both temporal domain and legal agent: what is received and conventionally understood as a seventh -day, human ritual is employed to introduce a seventh-&gt;&gt;e«r, /««¿/-executed institution.1 H then applies this reappropriation of Sabbath ideology further in its rationale for Israelite punishment and rehabilitation in Leviticus 26. This diversion from Sab- bath ideology elsewhere in the Hebrew Bible prompts the question, What motivates and resources such a religio-legal innovation in H? In this article, I argue that the Holiness Legislation's extension of the Sabbath to the seventh year and to the land results from its attempt to meld perspectives from both its Priestly and non-Priestly sources, even as H transforms all of these source materials according to its own ideological goals. Specifically, H engages P's notion of Sabbath alongside the seventh-year and Sabbath laws of CC and D. H then filters each of these sources through the lens of its distinctive notions of the relationships among Israel, its deity, and the land. The result is an entirely new model of Sabbath that reflects and applies H's larger personified animation and idealization of the land as holy servant of the Israelite god. Beyond my particular concentration on land Sabbath, I aim in this study to contribute to a larger understanding of H's hermeneutical stance. As demonstrated here, H moves beyond lemmatic citation and revision to extensions and reformu- lations of the underlying ideological conceptualizations of its sources. The result is a profound originality that nonetheless founds and legitimates itself in the tra- ditions of its forebears. I. The Sabbath in the Torah Sources As Baruch J. Schwartz has recently demonstrated, the four literary sources of the Torah share a common notion of divinely sanctioned Sabbath, even as each source also conceptualizes this practice and especially its origin distinctively. What is particularly significant for the present discussion is the Priestly conception of the Sabbath, of which Schwartz aptly highlights several key features:2 1 . As is the case in the respective presentations of the other Torah sources (J, E, D), P's Sabbath likely originates as a response to and rationalization 1 The abbreviations employed in this essay are as follows: CC: Covenant Collection/"Code," referring to Exod 20:23-23:19, which I view as an integral and original part of the pentateuchal Elohistic (E) source; P: more traditionally referring to the entirety of the Priestly material in the Pentateuch, including H, but here referring only to the non-H portions of the Priestly source; H: Holiness Legislation, referring especially to Leviticus 1 7-27 but also to other Priestly material out- side of Leviticus; D: Deuteronomy. 2 Baruch J.

P perceives the Sabbath as a temporal sanctum reserved for the deity. 3. P's Sabbath is established at creation by divine fiat. 4. As the special people singled out for worship of Yhwh, the Israelites are enjoined to refrain from desecrating the Sabbath, which is an integral part of their worship. Though established at creation, Sabbath observance begins only at Sinai, when Israel first learns of the Sabbath and is com- manded to keep it (Exod 31 : 12-173; 35:1-2). The purpose of the Sabbath in P stands in notable contrast to its purpose in the other Torah sources. For our current discussion, we may leave aside J, for there is no indication that H knows or interacts with J's Sabbath at all. The Sabbath laws in E and D, by contrast, are particularly important for understanding land Sabbath in H. In both E (Exod 23:12) and D (Deut 5:12-15), humanitarian concerns serve as primary motivations for Sabbath adherence.4 In its observance, the servile classes, including beasts of labor, are allowed to rest. As implied already in the brief description above, there is no corresponding humanitarian purpose or ration- ale for the Priestly Sabbath (Gen 2:1-3; Exod 31:12-17; 35:1-3). The single potential exception to this claim derives from Exod 31:17, which states that Yhwh ceased on the seventh day "and refreshed himself' (ttfsn). This example, however, is problematic on several fronts. First, it refers to the deity's seventh-day cessation from creation, not human Sabbath observance. It thus does not clearly set a precedent for understanding human Sabbath observance in P or H. Second, this verb - as well as the larger concept that it expresses - is otherwise unattested in pentateuchal Priestly literature, a point that raises the question of whether it is authentically P or H. The exceptional quality of ttfDn is especially acute in light of the intentional reference here to the seventh day of P's creation (Gen 2:1-3), which gives no indication of divine refreshment. Indeed, Gen 2:2 employs nearly the same formulation as Exod 31:17 ("and he ceased on the seventh 3 Though I view Exod 31:12-17 as a composite of P and H, in this article I am simply con- trasting it with the non-Priestly Torah sources. H's view of human Sabbath observance is fully con- sonant with that of P. 4 The Sabbath rationale in Exod 20:9-1 1, though embedded in the otherwise Elohistic Deca- logue, originates from the pen of the pentateuchal redactor (who is not the author of P or H; on the latter point, see Jeffrey Stackert, "The Holiness Legislation and Its Pentateuchal Sources: Revision, Supplementation, and Replacement," in The Strata of the Priestly Writings: Contemporary Debate and Future Directions [ed. Sarah Shectman and Joel S. Baden; ATANT 95; Zurich: Theologischer Verlag Zürich, 2009] 173-90). As Schwartz observes ("Sabbath," 8), Exod 20:9-11 cannot come from P, for it does not adjoin the preceding and succeeding P material. Moreover, it disagrees with P's conceptions of both the deity and the Sabbath. These verses were composed by the redactor on the basis of Exod 23:12 (pace Olyan, "Exodus 31:12-17," 208-9).</page><page sequence="4">242 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY | 73,2011 day'7/"but on the seventh day he ceased") without the attendant verb ItfDl Finally, the only other occurrence of the verb 093 in the context of the Sabbath is in Exod 23: 12, where the Sabbath is for rest and refreshment. In light of these problems, it seems best to attribute Eton in Exod 3 1 : 1 7 to the pentateuchal compiler, who by interpolating this verb seeks to harmonize the differing notions of Sabbath in the Torah sources. This instance of redactional har- monization is similar to the case of Exod 20:9-1 1 : in each case, the redactor drew from Exod 23:12 to inform other Sabbath-focused texts. One might counter that the melding of Priestly and non-Priestly elements in Exod 31:17 could be the work of H and not the pentateuchal redactor, and, in my view, there is a combination of P and H in Exod 3 1 : 12-1 7. 5 Yet H never elsewhere indicates that rest and refresh- ment are essential characteristics of seventh-day Sabbath. It therefore seems unlikely that the addition of here should be attributed to H.6 II. The Sabbath of the Land A. Literary Revision in the Land Sabbath Rule of the Holiness Legislation I have argued elsewhere that H is both a revision of and a completion of P, its intellectual and literary font.7 It integrates components of non-Priestly Torah leg- 5 In my view, this unit can be divided between P and H as follows: P: vv. 12-13aa, 15 (minus unp firatf), 16-17 (minus worn); H: vv. 13aß-14 and the words tfňp firing in v. 15. tfWI in v. 17 is redactional, and it is possible that v. 14bß (beginning with "O) is also secondary. See also Olyan, "Exodus 31:12-17," and the literature cited there; note, however, that Olyan attributes v. 17 as a whole to P, not H. 6 The LXX also objects to the plain meaning of ttfWI in this verse, albeit for different reasons. That is, the LXX at times exhibits a tendency to soften anthropomorphic portrayals of the deity (see, e.g., Jan Joosten, "To See God: Conflicting Exegetical Tendencies in the Septuagint," in Die Septuaginta - Texte, Kontexte, Lebenswelten: Internationale Fachtagung veranstaltet von Septua- ginta Deutsch (LXX.D). Wuppertal 20.-23. Juli 2006 [ed. Martin Karrer and Wolfgang Kraus; WUNT 219; Tübingen: Mohr Siebeck, 2008] 287-99; note also the recent caution of Leonard Greenspoon, "Hebrew into Greek: Interpretation In, By, and Of the Septuagint," in A History of Biblical Interpretation, vol. 1, The Ancient Period [ed. Alan J. Hauser and Duane F. Watson; Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2003] 80-113, esp. 95-96). It is this inclination that characterizes the LXX's translation of $Dn as KcrréTiauaev ("he ceased"; cf. Gen 2:2 and Exod 31:18, where the same verb is used to translate Hebrew rQttf and ^D). The possibility that the LXX is working from a different Vorlage is effectively ruled out in light of Aquila's preservation of a literal translation: àvé'1/uxev ("he was refreshed"). For further discussion, see John William Wevers, Notes on the Greek Text of Exodus (SBLSCS 30; Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1990) 515. Note, however, that Wevers's suggested translation, "and on the seventh day he rested and left off (the creation work)," misconstrues the meaning of rQ$ (and, contextually, its Greek counterpart, rraueiv), which here rightly means "to cease," not "to rest." 7 Jeffrey Stackert, Rewriting the Torah: Literary Revision in Deuteronomy and the Holiness Legislation (FAT 52; Tübingen: Mohr Siebeck, 2007). For similar conclusions, see, e.g., Baruch J. Schwartz, The Holiness Legislation: Studies in the Priestly Code (in Hebrew; Jerusalem: Magnes,</page><page sequence="5">THE SABBATH OF THE LAND 243 islation in order to create an updated and expanded "super-law" whose purpose is to replace all of its legal forebears (P, CC, D). In this revisioning process, H regu- larly champions a mediating legislative position that both incorporates and com- promises elements of its various source materials, even as it innovates beyond them. It is as part of this larger project that the Holiness author's application of Sabbath obligation to the land in Leviticus 25-26 may be understood. According to Lev 25:2-7, the land is to cease from its activity every seventh year as a "Sabbath of the Lord." These verses clarify exactly what such a cessation entails: while the Israelite farmer may sow and harvest in the six years prior to the Sabbath year, no corresponding planting or reaping is permitted in the seventh year. Rather, the Israelite farmer may gather the aftergrowth and volunteers of the Sabbath year for himself and his household, and the animals of the land may like- wise eat what grows without active cultivation. It should be noted, however, that, at least in the case of Israelite farmers and their households, no such need to gather in the seventh year should ever arise, for H promises - with characteristic Utopian flair - that the sixth-year harvest will be a bumper crop lasting until the ninth year (Lev 25:20-22). Immediately noteworthy in this land Sabbath law is the fact that H's enjoinder against seventh-year labor does not apply to Israelite persons. They are instead expressly permitted to walk their fields and vineyards to gather for food whatever grows during the Sabbath year. By contrast, the land must observe a total cessation (firDttf rQttf) from its customary "vocation." Its productive qualities, as displayed during the six non-sabbatical years of regular cultivation, are conceptualized as labor, and although a pragmatic nod is made to the realia of horticulture through a recognition of inevitable seventh-year aftergrowth, the land is clearly personified in this text. It is an agent fully capable of refraining from its conventional work in observance of the Sabbath year.8 This seventh-year law in Lev 25:2-7, though certainly innovative, is not a whole-cloth invention of H. Rather, it draws from and reorients ideas and specific language from CC, D, and P, even as its final product diverges from each of these sources. The literary parallels between Lev 25:2-7 and Exod 23:10-11 are well known and need not be rehearsed here in detail.9 These ties, which in some cases 1999) 17-24; Christophe Nihan, From Priestly Torah to Pentateuch: A Study in the Composition of the Book of Leviticus (FAT 2/25; Tübingen: Mohr Siebeck, 2007) 546, 549; and, tentatively, Jean- Louis Ska, Introduction to Reading the Pentateuch (trans. Pascale Dominique; Winona Lake, IN: Eisenbrauns, 2006) 151-52. 8 The notion of a personified land is not unique to H in biblical literature. See, e.g., Jer 12: 1 1 ; Hos 1:2; Job 31:38.

They also explain many of the distinctive emphases of the H law. For example, though often read otherwise, Exod 23: 10-1 1 does not command land fallowing. These verses actually require the planting and harvesting of the land in the seventh year and the donation of the seventh-year yield to the poor. Moreover, the accounting of years in CC is not standardized but instead applies to fields individually.10 In Exodus 23, therefore, there is no cessation from cultivation, nor is a seventh-year practice observed for all fields simultaneously. In other words, despite the tendency among scholars and others to refer to its seventh year as such, CC knows of no sabbatical year. In its revision of Exod 23:10-11, H seems to comprehend well that CC requires such seventh-year planting and harvesting and that its convention for counting years yields no universal seventh-year practice. Though its incorporation of Sabbath ideology might be viewed as sufficient, H also inserts additional lan- guage to clarify its alternative perspective. For example, Lev 25:4b categorically forbids sowing and pruning - activities implicitly required by Exod 23:11. The same concern for disambiguating its position on seventh-year cessation seems to motivate the inclusion of Lev 25:5a, which emphasizes that it is the aftergrowth (rPÖO) and the unpruned vine (TTJ) that may be exploited for food, not regularly planted and harvested produce. Likewise, the permission for all to glean in the seventh year (vv. 6-7), the accounting of jubilee years according to the seven-year sabbatical cycle (v. 8), and the promise of the sixth-year bumper crop (vv. 20-22) confirm the standardization of the seventh year in H and thus its variation from CC.11 Though it is less overt, the influence of Deuteronomy 15 is also recognizable in Lev 25:2-7. In addition to the parallel sequential combination of seventh-year and slavery laws in each of these chapters, the otherwise unattested term ļirD rQW ("a year of complete cessation") in Lev 25:5 seems to reflect the technical desig- AB 3, 3A, 3B; New York: Doubleday, 1991-2001) 3:2154-55; Stackert, Rewriting, 115-28; John Sietze Bergsma, The Jubilee from Leviticus to Qumran: A History of Interpretation (VTSup 115; Leiden/Boston: Brill, 2007) 48-50. Note that Bergsma, who is generally conservative in his identi- fication of direct literary dependence, nevertheless admits the dependence of Leviticus 25 upon CC. Curiously, he claims (p. 40) that the only sources for Leviticus 25 are Exod 21:1-11 and 23:10. It seems unlikely, however, that Leviticus 25 borrows from Exod 21:1, even as it is quite likely that Leviticus 25 responds to Exod 23: 1 1 and perhaps even v. 12 (points that Bergsma later endorses in his exegetical treatments of Exod 23: 10-1 1 [p. 49]). 10 See Stackert, Rewriting, 129-41; note also the discussion there concerning the problematic claim that Leviticus 25 reflects the concerns of land fallowing (p. 138 n. 65). 11 Such standardization of counting is evident also in H's reconceptualization of Sukkot. According to Lev 23:34, Sukkot begins on the fifteenth of the seventh month. By contrast, Exod 23: 16 and Deut 16: 13 offer a variable dating of this festival in relation to the actual autumn harvest (Exod 23:16: "At the end of the year, when you gather your produce from the field"; Deut 16:13: "When you have gathered from your threshing floor and wine vat").</page><page sequence="7">THE SABBATH OF THE LAND 245 nation Hütten rflttf V2VÎ7] TOW ("the seventh year, the year of the release") in Deut 15:9. Likewise, the emphatic repetition of the root TQttf in Lev 25:2-7 (7x) mirrors the peculiar repetition of the root in Deut 15:1-11 (6x). The list of beneficiaries in Lev 25:6-7 also shows evidence of creative borrowing from both Exod 23:11 and Deut 15:17-18, as do the shifts in the grammatical number of H's narrative address in this pericope.12 B. Reconceptualization and Amalgamation of Sabbath Ideology in H Even more significant for our present discussion than the literary ties among CC, D, and H are the larger conceptualizations of Sabbath that inform Lev 25:2-7. To be sure, H innovates significantly beyond P by introducing a seventh-year land Sabbath. Yet H's insistence on Sabbath for the land, and the attendant personifica- tion that such cessation entails, reflects and maintains the basic theory and under- lying rationale for Sabbath in P. The Sabbath - both day and year - is holy time and is thus reserved for the deity. As noted above, P requires all Israelites to observe the Sabbath day, which means that they must refrain from desecrating it with conventional activity. In P's animating myth, the Israelites must do so because they are set apart for special service to Yhwh. H builds on P's notion of Sabbath by designating its observance as a key component of Israelite holiness (Lev 19:3, 30) - a holiness that is achieved through obedience to the commandments.13 Such an extension of holiness to laypersons is wholly unconsidered in P.14 This association between Sabbath obser- vance and lay holiness also imparts to Sabbath observance a positive/performative element that is quite innovative in contrast to P's Sabbath, for P's Sabbath is char- acterized negatively (i.e., not working). H's introduction of lay holiness into penta- teuchal Priestly thought also accords well with its explicit claim that the Israelites are owned by the deity (Lev 25:42, 55), a characteristic that makes them eligible for sanctity.15 12 For a more detailed treatment of correspondences between Lev 25:2-7 and the seventh-year laws in CC and D, see Stackert, Rewriting, 1 15-27. 13 The prominence of the Sabbath command within the schema of lay holiness in H is signaled by the repetition of this command at the opening and close of Leviticus 19 (vv. 3, 30). 14 See, e.g., Israel Knohl, The Sanctuary of Silence: The Priestly Torah and the Holiness School (trans. Jackie Feldman and Peretz Rodman; Minneapolis: Fortress, 1995) 180-92; Baruch J. Schwartz, "Israel's Holiness: The Torah Traditions," in Purity and Holiness: The Heritage of Leviti- cus (ed.

It also suggests an extension of holiness to the land as Sabbath observer.16 In other words, this extension is not simply an expansion of the geographical borders of the deity's dwelling place (cf. Num 35:34), as has sometimes been suggested. 1 7 Although H does maintain and expand on P's notion of the sanctuary's holiness,18 it also emphasizes the active agency of the land as a key factor in its holiness. This agency and its implications for the land's sanctity are exemplified in the land Sabbath rule. Apart from land Sabbath, perhaps the most vivid example of the land's agency in H is in Lev 18:24-30 (cf. 20:22). These verses claim that the land "vomited out" (frOp) the sinful Canaanites, who preceded the Israelites in the land and defiled it. According to v. 25, the land took such drastic measures because Yhwh called it to account for the iniquity performed within its boundaries: rratîT riN pxn xpm rmy ìpdki I called it [viz., the land] to account for its iniquity, and the land vomited out its inhab- itants. The land, both in its imagined ability to spew forth its inhabitants and in its respon- sibility before the deity for the iniquities performed on it, is presented as an ideal- ized Israelite - a model agent of Yhwh - and not merely a sacred space.19 As an active subject of the deity like the Israelites themselves, the land must avoid the 16 H never explicitly states that the land itself is holy or is required to observe divine com- mands for the sake of its holiness. Nevertheless, the claims that the land is the dwelling place of the deity (Num 35:34) and subject to divine rules, as discussed here, suggest that a nascent sense of the land's (potential) holiness exists in H. 17 See, e.g., Jan Joosten, People and Land in the Holiness Code: An Exegetieal Study of the Ideational Framework of the Law in Leviticus 17-26 (VTSup 67; Leiden: Brill, 1996) 181-83; Wright, "Holiness in Leviticus and Beyond," 355-58. The parallel between sanctuary and land is highlighted especially through a comparison of the language of divine habitation in each (sanctuary: Exod 25:8; 29:45-46; 40:35; Num 5:3; land: Num 35:34). The land, however, never displaces the sanctuary. Thus, Habel's claim that the land is Yhwh's sanctuary (or even his "extended sanctuary") is an overstatement ( Land Is Mine, 110, 114). 18 See Jacob Milgrom, "Israel's Sanctuary: The Priestly 'Picture of Dorian Gray,"' RB 83 (1976) 390-99. 19 Baruch J. Schwartz ("Reexamining the Fate of the 'Canaanites' in the Torah Traditions," in Sefer Moshe: The Moshe Weinfeld Jubilee Volume. Studies in the Bible and the Ancient Near East, Qumran, and Post-Biblical Judaism [ed. Chaim Cohen, Avi Hurwitz, and Shalom M. Paul; Winona Lake, IN: Eisenbrauns, 2004] 151-70, here 165-66) downplays the animation and agency of the land in this text, preferring instead to see them as metaphors for the land's agricultural ruin and thus contrastive with the characterization of the land as "flowing with milk and honey" (Lev 20:24). I would instead emphasize the presentation of the expulsion of the land's inhabitants as Yhwh's action (Lev 1 8:24; 20:23) accomplished through his agent, the personified land (Lev 1 8:25, 28; 20:22).</page><page sequence="9">THE SABBATH OF THE LAND 247 "abominations" that the Israelites must avoid.20 That Leviticus 25 makes a claim of divine ownership of the land (v. 23) analogous to its claim of ownership of the Israelite people underscores the parallel position of people and land in this regard.21 In fact, though its (implied) holiness remains an underdeveloped idea, the land's sanctity in H seems on the whole to be more similar to H's notion of Israelite lay holiness than to the holiness of the sanctuary complex, which originates in P.22 The land's holiness is an achieved sanctity, not one imbued through anointing like that of the sanctuary, priests, and other sacred objects (cf. Exod 28:41; 30:26-30; 40:9-15; Lev 8:10-12).23 The consideration of the land's failure to observe its Sabbath in Lev 26:34-35, 42-43 also reflects this view: mum TN arrrrN pan onxi ratP w ^ rrnratf m pxn nmn tn nm&lt; ů ìò ntrâ m rattfn rawn w ^ rrnnntf m nmm pxn mmtin ninnivi Then the land will repay its Sabbath years throughout the days of desolation. When you are in the land of your enemies, then the land will cease and repay its Sabbath 20 For discussion of Israelite avoidance of abominations (rrnyin), see Jonathan Klawans, Impurity and Sin in Ancient Judaism (Oxford/New York: Oxford University Press, 2000) 21-42. Klawans here discusses the nature of moral impurity, which differs from ritual impurity in several ways, including its effect on the Israelite who commits the sin that generates the moral impurity and on the land. Unlike ritual impurity, which affects the sanctuary and can be cleansed ritually, moral impurity is not subject to ritual purging. In this way, then, the land and lay Israelites are anal- ogous and can be distinguished from the sanctuary. 2 1 As Joosten notes (People and Land, 1 7 1 -72, 1 8 1 -84), though the immediate concern of Lev 25:23 is rationalizing the jubilee economic laws, the assertion of divine possession of the land is a fundamental theological tenet in H. Its applicability thus extends beyond the immediate context of jubilee. 22 The only explicit rule that the land is required to follow according to H is the seventh-year Sabbath. As noted already, however, Yhwh also calls the land to account for the iniquity committed within it by humans. Such limited treatment and lack of definition suggest that the land's agency and responsibility to the deity remain undeveloped ideas in H. There is a sense, however, in which the commands of Lev 19:2 and 19: 18 are implicitly applied to the land as well as to Israelite laypersons. 23 On the nature of holiness in P and H, see, e.g., Schwartz, "Israel's Holiness," 52-59; idem, Holiness Legislation, 250-66; Wright, "Holiness in Leviticus and Beyond," 351-64; Eyal Regev, "Priestly Dynamic Holiness and Deuteronomic Static Holiness," VT 5 1 (2001) 243-61 . It should be noted, however, that Regev overstates the difference between Priestly (i.e., H) and Deuteronomic lay holiness, for in the case of Deuteronomy, the Israelites' holy status still requires them to observe the commandments, as does H. For an elucidation of these issues, see Schwartz, "Israel's Holiness," 58-59. H's extension of holiness to the land may be related to or even derive from its extension of holiness to Israelite laypersons. In P, the only persons who are holy are the priests, and the priests occupy the holy sanctuary complex. When H extends holiness to Israelite laypersons, a logical next step is to extend the geographical range of holiness to include the space occupied by the (holy) Israelite laity. The correlation in mode of sanctification between priests and sanctuary (anointing with oil) and laypersons and land (adherence to divine commands) supports this view.</page><page sequence="10">248 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY | 73,2011 years.

The land will be abandoned of them so that it may repay its Sabbath years when desolate of them, and they shall repay their iniquity because they spurned my rules and my statutes they abhorred, (vv. 42-43) In these verses, the land's Sabbath negligence is presented according to the prin- ciple of Lev 18:28 and 20:22: the Israelites have prevented the land from observing its seventh-year cessation, and it responds by turning against its inhabitants in favor of Yhwh's rules. Though Lev 26:32-33 envisions Yhwh desolating the land and scattering the Israelites among the nations (rather than the land vomiting its inhab- itants), vv. 34-35 present the ensuing period of desolation as an opportunity for the land's repayment/fulfillment (''SI) of neglected Sabbath years.24 This require- ment of accountability for the land is analogous to the land's liability in Lev 1 8:25. It also mirrors the peoples' accountability to the deity as a prerequisite for recon- ciliation. Leviticus 26:41, 43 requires the Israelites to repay the debt of their trans- gressions, after which the deity will remember the covenant with their ancestors (vv. 42, 44-45). Similarly, the land's repayment of its neglected Sabbath years elic- its the divine memory on its behalf (vv. 42-43). Though parallel and even inter- related, these reconciliations between God and the Israelites, on the one hand, and God and the land, on the other, are presented as distinct processes. In addition, by turning against its Israelite inhabitants in response to the divine command, the per- sonified land enforces a distinction among Yhwh's subjects that shares certain characteristics with both the Deuteronomic requirement to banish evil from the midst of Israel (Deut 13:6; 17:7, 12; 19:19; 21:21; 22:21-22, 24; 24:7) and the Priestly kārēt ("cutting off') penalty. Indeed, Lev 18:29 explicitly characterizes the land's expulsion of the people from its midst as kārēt.15 The motivation and rationale for land Sabbath, however, are not limited to reverence toward the deity. H also introduces in its seventh-year legislation human- 24 For a discussion of the Priestly use of "^"l, see Gary A.

Such humani- tarianism stands at the heart of Sabbath observance in CC and D and is also the fundamental concern of the seventh-year laws in CC and D from which H borrows. As noted briefly above, both Exod 23:12 and Deut 5:12-14 offer a rationale for observing Sabbath that focuses explicitly on extending compassion toward the servile classes and less privileged in Israel. Deuteronomy 5:15 even offers an addi- tional motivating reminder to the Israelites: because they once suffered under the forced labor of Egypt, they should practice a Sabbath that extends to their servants and beasts of labor. Likewise, both Exod 23:10-11 and Deut 15:1-18 emphasize provisioning the poor and servile classes. In the CC law, the poor are to receive the seventh-year harvest. In the D laws, those indebted are to enjoy a release from all claims in the seventh year (Deut 15:2), while slaves are to receive a generous endowment upon their manumission (Deut 15:14). In its land Sabbath law, H imports these humanitarian concerns from the seventh-year laws of CC and D and combines them with the Sabbath conceptions of P, CC, and D. Leviticus 25:6-7 highlights the humanitarianism of land Sabbath: ■ptihrĎi Trotai inôfcòi tùiìò niï pxn n mm nriKinn rrnn ļn*a twk rrtf?! inam1?! "py d nan The (produce of the) Sabbath of the land will be yours as food. For you, your male ser- vant, your female servant, your resident laborer - those dwelling under your authority - and for your animals and the wild animals in your land shall all of its produce be to eat. According to v. 6, the extended household of the landowner may enjoy the seventh- year aftergrowth, including slaves and aliens under the landholder's authority.26 Verse 7 widens the scope of this privilege by including domesticated animals as well as "the wild animals in your land" ("pTÍO "IttfN HT!). Provisioning such un- domesticated animals in particular reflects the humanitarian concern of Exod 23: 1 1 (and, in part, its specific language: mton DTI, "the wild animals of the field"), while the inclusion of both human laborers and animals corresponds to the concern of the Sabbath legislation in E and D. The objection might be raised that humanitarianism is not the rationale for land Sabbath in H. It is instead a response to the implicit question of what food will be available in the seventh year if a year-long agricultural cessation is observed simultaneously throughout the land. To be sure, the question of seventh-year eating interests the Holiness author. Leviticus 25:20-22, with its response to an anticipated 26 Ephraim A.

Yet it is precisely the promise of a bumper crop subsequent to the land Sabbath law that suggests that the human- itarianism of Lev 25:6-7 is not a tangent or afterthought but instead a basic com- ponent of the law itself. Indeed, if their concern is equivalent, the bumper crop invalidates the gleaning provisions in vv. 6-7 as a legitimate food source in the seventh year. This means that vv. 6-7 are best understood as a true charitable impulse. As such, they are a noteworthy departure from conventional Priestly Sabbath ideology and are best viewed as an external element integrated by H into a new amalgama- tion of ideas. Such a conclusion is supported also by a consideration of the bene- ficiary of land Sabbath humanitarianism and Sabbath humanitarianism in CC and D. In CC and D, humans and animals both cease from their labors and receive the charitable benefits of such rest. In H, by contrast, while the land ceases from its labor, it is still humans and animals - and not the land - who enjoy the benefits of such cessation. As has long been recognized, the contiguity of the seventh-year law (Exod 23:10-11) and the Sabbath law (Exod 23:12) in CC provides ample opportunity for the intermingling of "sevens" in the H land Sabbath rule. Sabbath ideology, with its attendant humanitarian concern in CC, is thus applied to the seventh year, which itself is a locus of benevolent concern in H's sources.27 As suggested already, such humanitarianism accords well with the notion of an attained holiness for the land that parallels lay Israelite holiness, for H adds to P several ethical/humanitarian commands whose observance alongside its ritual rules is the basis for lay holiness (cf. Leviticus 19). III. Conclusion To sum up, the seventh-year agricultural law in H is more than a revision of the corresponding seventh-year laws in CC and D. By introducing the concept of Sabbath, H extends, in terms of both temporal domain and legal agent, the scope and application of a religious idea that it inherits most directly from P. In so doing, it amalgamates P's notion of Sabbath with those of its non-Priestly sources. Yet the resultant law in H is not a clumsy parroting of its forebears. It instead moves substantially beyond any of them, pointing to a notion of animated geographical holiness that, though still nascent in the text, overlaps in significant ways with H's vision of lay holiness. 27 See, among others, Stackert, Rewriting, 1 18-20; Bergsma, Jubilee, 49; Nihan, From Priestly Torah to Pentateuch, 525.</page></plain_text>
