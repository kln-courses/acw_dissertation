<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS Had she reported more fully upon the tension and disturbance which these traits caused in the individual subjects it would perhaps be possible to hazard an ex- planation for her interesting discovery that ascendance is less modifiable than submission. At present it is not clear whether ascendant subjects are merely more satisfied with themselves, or whether in an interview they are unable to yield to the counsellor and to accept her suggestions, or whether ascendance is the more "normal" phase of personality and when once developed resists modification. Harvard University GORDON W. ALLPORT Reflex Activity of the Spinal Cord. By R. S. CREED, D. DENNY-BROWN, J. C. ECCLES, E. G. T. LIDDELL, and C. S. SHERRINGTON. Oxford, The Clarendon Press, 1932. Pp. viii, 183. Using the individual "motor unit" as the functional element of reflex response, the authors have been able to obtain accurate descriptions of reflex "time rela- tions" and "reflex quantities of effect" as expressed in both mechanical and elec- trical changes. This motor unit consists of the axone of a nerve cell together with all the muscle-fibers which its many branches innervate. It makes possible a quantita- tive statement of the changes occurring in such conditions as fractionation, con- vergence, and occlusion which have proved extremely useful in accounting for such characteristics as facilitation and inhibition. The book is not an account of the numerous investigations on reflexes of its authors. Rather it represents a complete summary, with a critical discussion, of all the important experimental work of the past thirty years. As indicated in the title, the book deals only with reflex responses manifest in preparations in which the intact central nervous system does not extend further headward than the corpora quadrigemina. The general object is to give a concise account of the mechanism of reflex behavior as found in the mammalian cord. Discussion of such topics as the "biological significance" of reflexes or reflexes as "items in animal behavior or conduct" have been purposely omitted. Such discussion would have materially increased the value of the book for psychologists. However, those espousing the principle of the conditioned response, or supporting the view that the complex acts in behavior are traceable to a synthesis of more elementary reflex units, will find the book extremely helpful in unraveling the physiological processes involved in supposedly simple reflex activity. The first two chapters present the characteristics of the reflex arc and the prop- erties of the spinal grey matter. In chapter three, the flexor reflex is used in describing such phenomena as the latent period, reflex tetanus, fractionation, con- vergence, occlusion, summation, refractory period, synaptic delay and after dis- charge. The next chapter deals with the stretch reflex and includes studies on the tension curve, the tendon jerk, action currents, lengthening and shortening re- actions, and the action of red and white muscles. In a discussion of the crossed and ipselateral extension reflexes such factors as de-afferentation, blending, re- bound, tetanic and single shock stimulation and latent successive induction are considered. Chapter six gives a very complete account of the phenomena observed in central inhibition. It contains accurate descriptions of the changes occurring in the central excitatory state and the central inhibitory state. A discussion of re- flex coordination is given in the last chapter. It includes such topics as concealed 780</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS reflexes, types of rebound, quantitative adjustment of reflex contraction, reciprocal innervation, speed of movement, etc. In concluding remarks the authors present a general principle which seems to emerge from their analysis of simple reflexes. It is that "the quantity of contraction presents itself as the resultant commonly of two interacting antagonistic central processes, excitation and inhibition." There are two appendices, a very complete bibliography of 209 references, and an index. University of California C. W. BROWN A Field Study of the Chimpanzee: Observations of Chimpanzee Behavior and Environment in Western French Guinea. By 'HENRY W. NISSEN. Foreword by Robert M. Yerkes. Comparative Psychology Monographs, 8, 1931, (no. 1). Pp. vi, 122, 41 pl. This account of chimpanzees in their natural habitat, the first study of its kind to be made by a psychobiologist, should prove almost as valuable to psychologists generally as to those interested primarily in animal behavior. Of necessity de- scriptive in emphasis, and admittedly an informational survey, the monograph nev- ertheless challenges many existing interpretations of anthropoid learning and social organization. It would appear, for example, that adaptation to the Umwege situ- ation is not as detached from previous experience as is assumed by those who postulate the concept of insight. The author, happily for his readers, has presented quotations from original notes and summaries of observations under the following broad but logically de- termined categories: social organization and physical appearance; nomadism, loco- motion, and activity distribution; nests and nesting; food and feeding; and so- cial behavior. Under the last mentioned category are included discussions of group leadership, play responses, contacts with other animals, reactions of chimpanzees to human behavior, and discussions of sound production and communication. Sup- plementing these observations and summaries, the reader will find interpretations which carry weight because they give resumes of the facts available and because they enjoy freedom from dogmatic assertion and anthropomorphic bias. Since the investigator has recognized frankly the limitations of his study, he qualifies as the best critic. Undoubtedly future field studies will profit from this pioneer research and will in turn modify certain of its hypotheses. Be that as it may, for the present Nissen has presented to his colleagues an excellent account of the chimpanzee in non-laboratory situations. University of Minnesota CHARLES BIRD Psychiatry and Mental Health. By JOHN RATHBONE OLIVER. New York, Charles Scribner's Sons, 1932. Pp. 330. The substance of this book was presented in the Hale Lectures in 1932 at the Western Theological Seminary with the purpose of orienting religious and social workers to the nature and peculiarities of abnormal people. The author has succeeded in producing a readable book, which may prove valuable to workers lacking psychiatric preparation. The appeal of the book as a whole is limited by the religious presuppositions of the author. The cases appended to each chapter are clearly illustrative and not typical. The bibliography is surprisingly inadequate so far as psychiatry is concerned. Trinity College ROBT. B. W. HUTT 781</page></plain_text>
