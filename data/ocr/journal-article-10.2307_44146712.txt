<plain_text><page sequence="1">'PORTABLE* IMAGES (BUDDHIST) FROM GANDHARA Sarita Khettry Gandhara was the ancient name of a region which included Pushkaiavati (Charsada in the Peshawar district) and some times also Takshasila (Shah-Dheri in Rawalpindi district) of Pakistan. The region was thus situated on both sides on the Sindhu or the Indus and included parts of Peshawar and Rawalpindi districts. Besides Gandhara proper, the term in its broader sense, comprised several neighbouring regions, particularly the Swat and other river valleys to the north, the region around the city of Taxila to the east, and Eastern Afghanistan (culturally it was a part of Indian subcontinent).1 Towards the close of the 1 51 century B.C. an eclectic school of art developed with certain typical characteristics in Gandhara. This art form was commonly known as the Gandhara School. The technique employed was unquestionably borrowed from Hellenistic standards, as modified by such trends as Iranian, Scythian, etc. but the themes depicted were Indian, almost exclusively Buddhist. This school of art was chiefly notable in providing the earliest representation of the Buddha in anthropomorphic form. In the system of early Buddhism there was no image of the Buddha to which worship was offered by any Buddhist. Buddha did not believe in icon or image worship. Therefore, in early Buddhist art of India he was never represented in human form. His presence was marked by the symbols such as Bodhi-tree or the wheel of the law, by his footprints or bis umbrella and by an empty throne. These aniconic forms are well represented in the Buddhist art of India from the 2nd century B.C. to 1st century B.C. at Bharhut, Sanchi and Bodh-Gaya.2 The epigraphic and numismatic data3 suggest that in about 1st century A.D. or during the time of Kanishka (129-155 A.D.) the Buddha image was evolved in the region concerned. In addition to the images of the Buddha we get also icons of the Boddhisattvas. These images which were both standing and seated found mainly in the Buddhist monasteries at Taxila, Takht- i-Bahi in the Yusufzai country, Sahr-i-Bahlol, Shah-ji-Dheri, Manikiala, Jamalgarhi, Uddiyana (in the Swat valley), Bala Hissar at the junction of the Swat and Kabul rivers, Charsada, Palatu and Ghaz Dheri, Jalalabad, Hadda and Bamiyan in Afghanistan. These were donated by royal persons or were the gift of wealthy persons. The function of these images was mainly devotional. These images belonged from the 2nd century A.D. to the 6th century A.D.</page><page sequence="2">Ancient India 205 An important development in the area of Buddhist imagery was the use of personal veneration icons of the Buddha and Bodhisattvas in the monasteries from the 3rd century onwards. This is attested by the account of Xuanzang and I-tsing who came to India in the 7th and 8th century A.D. respectively. Both of them noted that music and singing accompanied the performance of worship of the Buddha. According to I-tsing, the monks of India had in their cells, in a window or niche, an image of the Buddha which they treated with respect and veneration. Each morning they bathed it and offered flowers and incense to the icon. At midday, they presented part of their meal to it.4 It is in this connection that we can refer to a small group of brass standing Buddha figures which is at present in the collection of Metropolitan Museum of Art. One such brass image of the Buddha is reported to have been found at the Gandharan site of Sahri-Bahlol.5 (Fig.l Sahri-Bahlol, Pakistan, Gandhara, brass, height 1 1 V2 in., Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, courtsey: Kurt A. Behrendt). The image can be assigned to c. late 6th century A.D. Here Buddha is shown in abhaya mudra and his head and body are enclosed in a separately attached, combined halo (one that surrounds both head and body). The second brass image6 (Fig. 2. Pakistan or Afghanistan, brass, height WA in., Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, courtsey: Kurt A. Behrendt) is similar to the previous one. Only in this instance the base has survived. Again the radiate halo encircles the Buddha's head and body. This combined halo is embellished with an elaborate floral pattern enclosed by a border of pearls. The image belonged to c. late 6th century A.D. The third figure of the standing Buddha7 (Fig. 3. Pakistan or Afghanistan, brass, height 13 in., Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, courtesy: Kurt A. Behrendt) comes from the region of Pakistan or Afghanistan and belonged to the same period. Originally it had a halo. The style of these three brass images had a strong affiliation with 6th century Buddhas of Gupta period from Eastern India8 (Fig. 4. Probably from Bihar, bronze, Height 1 8Î4 in. Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, courtesy: Kurt A. Behrendt). In these images the subtle contours of the Buddha's enlightened body are stressed rather than emphasis being placed on covering robes, as is the case with earlier Gandharan Buddhas. The third brass image of the Buddha is more closely related to the Gupta figure in style than the other two brass sculptures in the Metropolitan Museum. All these images were portable figures and easily moved from one place to another. There is no doubt that these were the personal possessions of monks and were carried around by them. The significance of these portable images lies in the fact that they were the ideal vehicle of transmission of artistic style as evident from the above images. They also throw some light on the dynamics of the cultural</page><page sequence="3">206 I HC: Proceedings , 72nd Session, 2011 exchange between Gandhara and the adjoining regions of Afghanistan and Central Asia on the one hand and north and eastern India on the other. In this connection we can also refer to another kind of portable image which are called hinged 'pocket' shrines by Kurt A. Behrendt. The production of these images in the region of Gandhara is an important development from the point of view of Buddhist iconography as well as religion. A number of such portable images are in the collection of Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. One such fragmentary portable image is discovered from the region of Gandhara (Pakistan) which displays the first sermon of the Buddha (Fig. 5. Gandhara (Pakistan), schist, height, 29/)6 in. (6.5 cm), Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, courtesy: Kurt A. Behrendt). Here Buddha is seated in meditation and displaying dharmacakra mudra , with two monks to the right. The left side is broken away. A portable figure (Fig. 6. Ali Masjid, Afghanistan, schist, height, 8.5 cm, courtesy: W. Zwalf) of same composition is found from the Buddhist site of Ali Masjid, on the Khyber Pass leading to Afghanistan. It represents the first sermon of the Buddha in a more stylized way than the earlier Gandharan image. Below the preaching Buddha, a wheel is shown on a pedestal flanked by deers. Two monks are shown seated on either side (the traditional number is five in the Buddhist text). We can also refer to a small schist image (Fig. 7. Gandhara (Pakistan), schist, height, 6 in. (15.2 cm), Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, courtesy: Kurt A. Behrendt) which comprises two halves. Each of these panels represents the significant event of the life of the Buddha. The event in the upper half is easily recognized as the first sermon of the Buddha because the Buddha is shown w'^h a wheel in front of him and five monks are present. Above the monks are a number of figures surrounding the Buddha, presumably the gods coming to hear him preach? The lower half shows the Buddha looking and gesturing to a tree on his left while some figures look on. This scene cannot be satisfactorily identified.9 The interesting point is that on the right side of the image hinge attachment is visible. The image is a broken one. Only one half of this hinged portable image survives. It may be presumed that a matching section would be there to complete the image. Another important portable image (Fig. 8. Gandhara (Pakistan), schist, height 4V¿ in., Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, courtesy: Kurt A. Behrendt) is three-sided wedge-shaped which comes from Gandhara (Pakistan). Opening the original small image, which would have been circular when closed, would have revealed four wings in order to make it a complete image. Holes on the edges of the piece,</page><page sequence="4">Ancient India 207 possibly for hinges, support this interpretation. At the top of one interior face is Sakyamuni's conception, and at the top of the other is a scene that is difficult to identify. The two interior middle halves illustrate the story of Devadatta's killing the elephant and the wrestling competition that Sakyamuni undertook to show himself worthy of marriage. On the bottom are representations of a fasting Buddha and the first sermon. However, on the exterior face is an image of a standing Bodhisattva Maitreya in the middle half, with a seated Buddha above him and a damaged scene below. Here, one may add to these images a section of another portable image (Fig. 9 Gandhara (Pakistan), schist, height 37/1ć&gt; in Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, courtesy: Kurt A. Behrendt) which represents the birth of Sakyamuni and his miraculous first steps in the top half, and his death (parinirvana ) in the lower half. The exterior of the image is more enigmatic. It shows a squatting man reaching back to support a wicker basket. His hair is held in place by a headband decorated with pearls, and he wears heavy Kushan-type boots. He supports a child, now headless, on his shoulder.10 A close examination of the above images leads us to several observations: There were two types of portable images- 1) those made up of brass and 2) those made up of schist. These were small images of varied sizes ranging from 29/ļ6 in. to 13 in. As mentioned above the first images were the personal possessions of monks for veneration while the second one was used by the lay followers, travellers and merchants moving along the Silk Road. This is evident from the fact that a part of portable image is found at the Central Asian site of Khotan. This image is very similar to Gandharan portable image. The exterior part is embellished with a headless figure, hand on chin and seated on a stool above his brahmin's water pot. He may be identified with an ascetic who predicted the newborn Buddha's destiny. While on the interior we find the scenes of the Buddha's enlightenment and first sermon (Fig. 10. Khotan, Central Asia, schist, height, 8.5 cm, 7th century A.D. courtesy: W. Zwalf). In this connection we can refer to a part of small triptych image made up of wood from the region of Mingoi, near Karashahr in Central Asia (Fig. 1 1 . Mingoi, near Karashahr, Central Asia, wood, height, 28.2 cm., 5th-6th century A.D. courtesy: W. Zwalf)- The middle part of the hinged triptych image shows one of the legends of Sakyamuni's previous lives, when as a young Brahmin student knelt before Buddha Dipamkara spreading his hair beneath his feet and vowed to become a Buddha himself.11 Yet another portable image made of ivory and dating to the 7th century A.D. was nlade in India but found in the Yulin cave in Gansu, China.12 The discovery of such portable images</page><page sequence="5">208 IHC: Proceedings, 72nd Session, 2011 from places situated along the Silk Road trading routes confirms that these images were moving great distances through the mediation of merchants, travelers, and lay followers and probably also monks. The manufacturing area was undoubtedly the region of Gandhara. The interesting point is that the iconography of the second type of portable images differs from that seen in monastic image shrines and surviving monastic personal devotional images. The monastic images of Buddhas in Gandhara are mainly life size standing and seated icons showing different mudras for instance abhaya , dhyana and dharmachakra . The Buddha has a plain halo, a small urna on his forehead, and wavy hair that covers his ushnisha (cranial protuberance associated with his enlightenment). Both his shoulders are covered with the robe. The feet of the Buddha are hidden by the end piece of the robe. The hem of the robe is gathered in the left hand. The face is oval in appearance. In addition to the images of the Buddha we get also icons of the Bodhisattva in the territory concerned. The word Bodhisattva occurs for the first time in the Pali Nikayas.13It was applied to 'a being who is in the process of obtaining but has not yet obtained Buddhahood,' such as Gautama or Siddhartha before his attainment of nirvana. Accordingly, in the narrative reliefs the Bodhisattva Sakyamuni is depicted as living in a palace and wearing the jewelry, turban, and garments of a prince. Gandharan narrative reliefs showing Sakyamuni's life in the palace and his departure from it are more numerous than those from any other portion of the Buddha's biography, implying the importance of this subject to the worshippers. Devotional images of the Bodhisattva Sakyamuni's are the iconic version of this moment: when he broke free from material attachments to the world. In the Abhiniskramana sutra , Sakyamuni, considering leaving the palace, says, 'It is only the fool who is deceived by the outward show of beauty; for where is the beauty when the decorations of the person are taken away, the jewels removed, the gaudy dress laid aside, the flowers and chaplets withered and dead? The wise man, seeing the vanity of all such fictitious charms, regards them as a dream, a mirage, and a phantasy.'14 Devotional icons of Sakyamuni as a Bodhisattva thus appear to refer to life's transient nature and to the need to break free from attachment to material things. Such images present Sakyamuni as the ultimate prince, and he is depicted in his full glory prior to the act of renunciation. In Mahayana Buddhism, Bodhisattvas were led by compassion, they vowed to take upon themselves the sorrows of all living beings to bring them enlightment and to ensure their salvation. They are perfect embodiments of detachment, knowledge and virtue. One such Boddhisattva was Avalokitesvara. Icon of Avalokitesvara is shown</page><page sequence="6">Ancient India 209 standing on a pedestal. He is wearing a turban. In his right hand he holds the lotus with the stem and his left hands is resting on the waist.15 The other Bodhisattva often is depicted among the early devotional images as Maitreya, the last in the line of historical Buddhas, who, it is believed, will be reborn in the future. A large number of images of Bodhisattva Maitreya are discovered from the region of Gandhara. In these images Maitreya is generally represented as standing on a pedestal adorned with rich ornaments. In his left hand, he is holding a water vessel (the kamandalu' the cognizance by which he is identified in Gandharan art, while his left hand is shown in abhayamudra. He wears a jatamukuta. Urna is clearly marked between the eyebrows. Feet are webbed and he is wearing sandals. However, the iconography of the second type of portable images is narrative in nature. As mentioned above, this type of images represented the important events of the life of the Buddha. In Mahayana Buddhism, enlightenment and teaching were considered the most important aspects of the Buddha's life, and so are Sakyamuni's later life and death ( parinirvana ). It is important to note here that even in the Brahmanical context we get evidence of hinged portable images. One such image is from Kashmir dated to 5th-6th century A.D. (Fig. 1 1 . Kashmir, India, chlorite, height. 3 in. Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, courtesy: Kurt A. Behrendt). This image is similar in style and configuration as the hinged to portable images (Fig. 5) mentioned above from Gandhara. Thus, it can be said that a gradual change was taking place in Gandharan Buddhism. Probably during the 5th-6th century A.D. there was a gradual decline in patronage to Buddhist sacred areas in Gandhara and this led to the production of devotional personal and narrative hinged portable images by the Buddhist community.
