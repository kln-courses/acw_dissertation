<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> ARISTOTELIAN ETHICS AND  BIOPHILIA ARISTOTELIS SANTAS Biophilia is a concept that has been much utilized as a foundation for an  environmental or “land” ethic. E.O. Wilson characterizes it as a genetic  disposition that links human survival to valuing living systems. J. Baird  Callicott argues that human sentiments are naturally directed to all liv- ing systems and beings and this sentiment has evolutionary value. This  author contends that if biophilia is to be a viable foundation for such an  ethic, it must be conceived more abstractly and broadly as an intercon- necting feature of biotic systems. The foundation for such a conception  can be found in Aristotle’s ethics, wherein his discussion of friendship,  philia, can provide a theory of interspecies obligation. Although Aris- totle’s focus in the Nicomachean Ethics is human relations, he makes  it clear that this sentiment can be felt towards other living beings. This  paper develops a broader conception of philia that includes interspecies  relationships and then reconceives the modern concept of biophilia as a  form of interspecies philia. It goes on to argue, using Aristotle’s theory of  obligation as reciprocity within friendship, that such a re-conception of  biophilia might provide another approach to founding an environmental  ethic on a theory of sentiment.  (H)uman history did not begin eight or ten thousand years ago with  the invention of agriculture and villages. It began hundreds of thou- sands or millions of years ago with the origin of the genus Homo.  For more than 99 percent of human history people lived in hunt- er-gatherer bands totally and intimately involved with other organ- isms.

They would catch minnows with nets we had fashioned  out of materials we had available to us and carry them home to keep in  their aquarium. One day they managed to catch a young large-mouth  bass and decided to keep it in the tank. This experiment became quite a  proposition, as this wild fish could not subsist on fish flakes or pellets,  and needed live prey on a regular basis. So there were many trips to the  creek, and many minnows to be caught and brought back to the tank.  Eventually, the fish was released back into the creek and that was the  end of the experiment. In the time that we had kept this fish, however, a  curious thing had happened. On one of the trips to catch minnows, my  children had managed to capture a large crawfish and had been curious  to see how this animal would interact with the bass. At first, predictably,  the two were antagonistic to one another, but well-matched by virtue of  their comparable sizes. As the days passed though, they became used to  one another; and not only did they stop the antagonisms, they seemed  to form a bond. It was as if the confinement of their shared environment  precipitated a relationship that had always been possible, but needed spe- cial circumstances to bring it about. We had observed an “interspecies”  friendship, an apparent fondness of one living thing for another wherein  a line is crossed between differing species. I have characterized this example of interspecies (cross-species) re- lationships as a form of friendship. Jennifer S. Holland’s recent book,  Unlikely Friendships: 47 Remarkable Stories from the Animal Kingdom,  describes numerous other such cases. She writes: Less common than a human-pet connection...is a bond between  members of two different nonhuman species... The phenomenon is  most often reported in captive animals, in part because we simply  catch them in the act more often. But it’s also because, notes biol- ogist and primate specialist Barbara King of the College of William  and Mary, that’s where constraints are relaxed, where animals aren’t  fighting for their basic needs—which allows their emotional energy  to flow elsewhere. Of course, there are cases of cross-species bonds  in the wild, as well. “Most important,” King says, “we know animals,  under whatever circumstances, have that capacity.” (Holland 2011, x) Holland, knowing full well that this characterization of these relation- 96 ETHICS &amp; THE ENVIRONMENT, 19(1) 2014 </page> <page sequence="3"> ships as friendship runs the risk of inappropriately anthropomorphizing  these cases, continues:  Not all scientists are comfortable using a term like friendship when  referring to nurturing or protective animal relations. For many years,  “animals were to be described as machines, and students of animal  behavior were to develop a terminology devoid of human connota- tions,” wrote primatologist Frans de Waal in The Age of Empathy. He  himself has been criticized for attributing human traits to animals by  biologists who believe “anthropomorphic anecdotes have no place in  science.” Even those less averse to associating people-based ideas with  nonpeople say we don’t know how much awareness exists between  “friends” regarding their behavior. But behaviorists argue that declar- ing that there is none at all leans too far the other way. The famed  primatologist Jane Goodall, who has described her own relationship  with wild chimpanzees, said in a recent interview with me for Na- tional Geographic, “You cannot share your life in any meaningful  way with an animal and not realize they have different personalities.  Are their capabilities and emotions similar to ours? Absolutely.” (Hol- land 2011, x–xi) This controversy over what feelings we can attribute to non-human ani- mals is ongoing, and will not be my focus here. My reason for discussing  such cases is to motivate a deeper discussion of biophilia, commonly un- derstood as a love of life. This phenomenon is of great import in contem- porary environmental philosophy and has been used by theorists as a sort  of naturalistic foundation for an environmental or land ethic.  The term ‘biophilia’ was first used by Erich Fromm in The Anatomy of  Human Destructiveness. There he “described biophilia as ‘the passionate  love of life and of all that is alive.’ The term was later used by American  biologist Edward O. Wilson in his work Biophilia (1984), which proposed  that the tendency of humans to focus on and to affiliate with nature and  other life-forms has, in part, a genetic basis....” (Rogers 2013 ) Both us- ages focus on human awareness and attitude; and both see biophilia as  a generalized human love for living things or systems. While I think that  such a usage has merit, there are other levels to explore, especially when  one considers the history of the Greek term ‘philia’ on which the concept  relies. It is my contention that the above described “friendships” between  members of different species are important cases in biophilia, and that the  ARISTOTELIS SANTAS ARISTOTELIAN ETHICS AND BIOPHILIA 97 </page> <page sequence="4"> discussion of biophilia to date has been missing an adequate discussion  of this phenomenon. To undertake such a discussion, I shall explain the  early use of the term ‘philia’ and its role in Greek ethical theory, drawing  heavily from Aristotle’s ethical philosophy, show its applicability to inter- species friendships, and then outline its relevance and import for contem- porary environmental theory. ARISTOTLE ON FRIENDSHIP AND THE MEANING OF PHILIA Aristotle’s ethics is generally treated in cursory manner and selected  readings typically exclude his discussion of friendship. His theory is char- acterized as ‘virtue ethics’ and his famous discussion of moral virtue as  moderation dominates most discussions of his work. However much  merit there is to the idea of virtuous action as effecting a “Golden Mean”  in conduct, such a picture of his view provides only a glimpse of his theo- ry—a fuller account of his moral philosophy might prove useful. First of all, the term ‘virtue ethics’ can be misleading for linguistic  reasons. The English ‘virtue’ is a translation of arete ̄, which has a broader  and often different meaning than what we today call ‘virtue.’ Translator  Martin Ostwald’s glossary entry on arete ̄ provides some insights, which I  quote here at length: arete ̄ (αρετή): Of fundamental importance in all Greek ethical sys- tems. This term, which is the noun corresponding to the adjectives  agathos, ‘good,’ aristos, ‘best,’ originally denoted the excellence of a  brave or noble warrior....The full history of the term would involve a  history of Greek moral ideas, but it is important to realize that arete ̄  was eventually generalized to denote the functional excellence of any  person, animal, or thing. For example, the arete ̄ of a shoemaker is the  quality that makes him produce good shoes; in a horse race, it is the  quality which will make the horse run to victory.... It is against this  background that any Greek discussion of the arete ̄ of man as man  has to be seen: his aretai or ‘virtues’ are those qualities which make  him function well in relation to his fellow men, that is, the qualities  which make him play his part in human society well. This means  that the overtone of divine sanction of human morality, which is the  cornerstone of any Judaeo-Christian system of ethics, is absent from  the Greek.... The English translation ‘virtue’ is too narrow, though  often inescapable, and we use, accordingly, excellence, goodness,  virtue, or a combination of these, depending on the context. (Aris- totle 1962, 303–34)  98 ETHICS &amp; THE ENVIRONMENT, 19(1) 2014 </page> <page sequence="5"> On the basis of this conception of virtue I like to characterize Aristot- le’s ethics as an excellence-ethics, which includes three main areas of focus: 1. Excellence in Character Development (“moral virtue”) 2. Excellence in Intellectual Development (theoretical and  practical wisdom—sophia and phrone ̄sis) 3. Excellence in Human Relations (virtuous “friendships”) Notice that I interpret his approach as under the general umbrella of  arete ̄, ‘excellence.’ This move allows one to include the friendship discus- sion as in keeping with the overall argument of his theory, which charac- terizes the good life (eudemonia) as “an activity of the soul in accordance  with excellence or virtue.” (Aristotle 1962, 17) The first area indicated  above, as we have mentioned, is well treated in any discussion of Aris- totle’s ethics and will not be my focus here. Such is the case also with his  treatment of the second item, intellectual virtue, or, wisdom. His distinc- tion of the latter between sophia and phrone ̄sis is also an important and  well-known move in the development of moral theory, but will not be a  focus here either. What I shall develop presently is the third item on our  list, excellence in our relations, philia. Before beginning Aristotle’s discussion of friendship, it might be  worth looking at the history of the term itself. According to the Great  Dictionary of the Entire Greek Language (Demotic, Katareusa, Middle  Ages, Modern, Ancient),1 the term is used in ancient times to characterize  everything from relations between lovers, to that of nations, to the rela- tions between gods and men or those of children and parents. I reproduce  the entry in part here: Herodotus, 7.170—friendship between nations Plato, Symposium, 8, 15—“pure friendship (or love) is the character  of the soul” Plato, Symposium, 188c—“friendship is part of love and affection  between families” Plato, Symposium, 188d—“friendship brings Athens great power; ha- tred brings disastrous fate.” Plato, Republic, 581A—“It is profitable for one to hold pleasure and  friendship with someone else” Isocrates 6.11—“forsaken friendship will cause detriment” Isocrates, Epistles, 7.13—“renewing our former friendship and  hospitality” ARISTOTELIS SANTAS ARISTOTELIAN ETHICS AND BIOPHILIA 99 </page> <page sequence="6"> Isocrates 88D—“mortals judge each other by their friendship” Thucydides, 1, 91—“our friendship depends on the fact that love— friendships—exist between gods and men” Xenophon, Anabasis, 1—“treaties are a sign of trust and friendship” Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics, 2, 7, a3—“attraction, strong desire,  intercourse, carnal desire, eros” (Dimitrakou 1964) In keeping with the diversity of usage of the term, Ostwald, at the  beginning of Aristotle’s treatment of the topic in Book VIII, notes at length  the meaning of this term and its significance: The human relation of ‘friendship’ forms the subject of this book and  the next. As we shall see, the connotations of philia are considera- bly wider than those of ‘friendship.’ Philia is best summed up in the  Greek proverb: κοινά τά τών φίλων, “friends have in common what  they have.” It designates the relationship between a person and any  other person(s) or being that person regards as peculiarly his own  and to which he has a peculiar attachment. For example, in Homer  the adjective φίλος, “dear,” is frequently used as a person’s heart or  mind, and also used to describe the relation to one’s wife and chil- dren. In neither sense would we speak of friendship in English. But of  course, as in English, the term also expresses (from Hesiod on) the re- lationship to a person to which one feels especially attached, i.e., to a  ‘friend.’ On the other side of the scale, philia constitutes the bond that  holds the members of any association together, regardless of whether  the association is the family, the state, a club, a business partnership,  or even the business relation between buyer and seller. Here again,  we would not use the term ‘friendship’ in English, but the expressions  such as ‘harmony’ or ‘good will.’ But for the Greek, it is the bond that gives people something ‘in  common’ that counts in philia, and it is for that reason, and especially  for its importance in social and political matters, that a discussion of  it is given more space than is given to any other problem in the Nic.  Eth. (Ostwald 1962, 214) Such a background of usage serves as a good introduction to Aristot- le’s analysis, as he undertakes to reign in the broad concept and distinguish  between types of friendship. He provides a threefold distinction between  the types of items we find worthy of affection, which is his explanation for  sources of attraction that binds us together. They are: 100 ETHICS &amp; THE ENVIRONMENT, 19(1) 2014 </page> <page sequence="7"> 1. Friendships Based on Usefulness (Benefit) 2. Friendships Based on Pleasure (Pleasantness) 3. Friendships Based Virtue (Excellence) The first form of friendship, that of usefulness, is the least “perfect” form  of friendship for Aristotle, although nonetheless very important. It ac- counts for all “profitable” forms of relationships, be they business part- nerships, strategic alliances or treaties, buyers engaging with sellers, or  neighbors looking out for each other’s houses or children. It is important  to note here that there is friendliness in these relations, and therefore an  emotional connection, albeit a weak one. We can characterize these rela- tionships as quid pro quo arrangements facilitated by good will, although  the friendliness will only last as long as the usefulness. The latter point is  why Aristotle deems such a friendship as “imperfect,” since the affection is  not for the person but for what he or she brings to the bargain. When the  bargain runs thin and the other party ceases to be useful, there is simply  no reason to continue the association. Affection quickly becomes indiffer- ence, or worse yet, hostility. The second form of friendship, a relationship based on pleasure, is  also imperfect in Aristotle’s analysis, but also an important part of human  life. This form of relationship exists between any two individuals or enti- ties that seek and enjoy each other’s company because they find it pleas- ant to be around. One can include here not only sexual attraction, but  partners in amusements (from spectator sports to drinking, to gaming of  any sort), or simply friends who make each other laugh. The bond here  is clearly emotional and stronger than what one finds with useful friends.  Moreover, it is clear here that the good feeling one seeks from the relation- ship only exists when the given partner is present, that is to say, the feeling  is not a detachable good. For this reason, interestingly, Aristotle holds this  form of friendship in higher esteem than one based on usefulness. Nev- ertheless, Aristotle, identifying permanence and stability as key criteria  for determining the best kind of relationship, suggests that this type of  attraction is ultimately imperfect. When the thrill is gone, or the fun runs  out, the company will inevitably part. Perfect friendship, for Aristotle, is manifest in a relationship based  on excellence—virtue. There are a number of reasons. First, these rela- tionships are stable. When one is attracted to another because of qualities  ARISTOTELIS SANTAS ARISTOTELIAN ETHICS AND BIOPHILIA 101 </page> <page sequence="8"> esteemed as admirable, the attraction does not come and go with small  changes in circumstance. Second, since the source of the attraction is ad- miration, what is deemed lovable is not a detachable good or fleetingly  pleasant quality, but the person’s character. That is, the attraction is for  the person, not simply for what that person brings. Thirdly, because the  attraction is for a person one deems as admirable and good, a motivation  exists for each party to give their partner affections, goods, and pleasure  for no other reason than the fact that such goods are deserved. There is no  bargain, in other words, and there is never a gift given or affection paid  with an expectation of some material return. We can see in this descrip- tion of virtuous friendship that it seems to incorporate the other two types  of relationships, though the motivation changes. This latter description points to the fact that human relationships are  complex. A little reflection on the nature of our relations shows us that it  is rare for both parties of a given friendship to be motivated by the same  affections and desires. Most relationships are of a mixed sort: one party  may be motivated by benefit, while the other is motivated by pleasure.  One might seek out someone’s company by virtue of respect and admira- tion, while the other seeks something else. Often these differing motiva- tions are unclear or mistaken, which leads to complaints, disagreements  and unhappy dissolution of relations. Aristotle comments: Surely, there is nothing strange about breaking friendships based on  what is useful or pleasant when the partners no longer have the qual- ities of being useful or pleasant.... But there is reason for complaint,  if a person loves another for being useful or pleasant but pretended to  love him for his character... (D)ifferences between friends arise most  frequently when they are not friends in the sense they think they are.  (Aristotle 1962, 250) In addition to this complicating factor of mixed relationships, Aris- totle also discusses the phenomenon of relationships between unequals  (Aristotle 1962, 227–28). Here he discusses the connection between in- ferior and superior and the relationships he saw as such. In his world  there were differing classes of people with different levels of status, and  they did possess philia between them, but the difference in status limited  them in the level to which the relationship could go. Many if not all of  these cases, such as, for instance, the deference of a slave to a master, or  of an inferior social class to a higher, we no longer accept as legitimate.  102 ETHICS &amp; THE ENVIRONMENT, 19(1) 2014 </page> <page sequence="9"> Others, like that of woman and man, we no longer see as an unequal form  of relation. He argues, for instance, that men and women can never be  virtuous friends (though there can be useful and pleasant affections mutu- ally between them), since they cannot be equal in virtue. The woman can  respect the man, but the man cannot fully reciprocate the feeling. Such a  view is obviously dated.2 What is interesting about his analysis, however,  is that he observed something accurate about such relations: where there  is unequal power between entities, no virtuous friendship can exist.3 The  respect and admiration can only go in one direction in such cases—this  will be important for us later. In developing his theory of obligation based on friendship, Aristotle  considers the nature of the relationship in question. Relationships based  on usefulness are the ones in which obligation is the easiest to determine.  Since the relation is motivated by material benefit, the obligations arise  out of a simple quid pro quo. We owe what is of equal benefit to what has  been given. Though this may be tricky at times in detail,4 the basic princi- ple is clear. In relations based on pleasure, on the other hand, obligation is  harder to measure, if not inappropriate. One enjoys someone’s company  and this enjoyment binds us together. There is no quid pro quo here, no  debt that has not been paid. The pleasure is inherently something experi- enced together. Aristotle writes: (C)omplaints (do not) occur very much in friendships based on pleas- ure. For the desire of both partners is fulfilled at the same time if  they enjoy spending time together. In fact a man would impress us as  ridiculous if he complained that he did not find his friend delightful,  since he is free not to spend his days with him. (Aristotle 1962, 24) In discussing friendships based on virtue, Aristotle notes that obligation is  again difficult to measure. There are material benefits involved in such a  relationship to be sure, but as we have said, the motivation to the giving of  any benefit is not expectation of some return, but a desire to give to that  person we deem admirable and deserving of good things. (W)hen people are friends on the basis of virtue or excellence, they are  eager to do good to one another, since that is a mark of excellence as  well as friendship.... If a person gives more than he receives, he will  have no complaints against his friend, since he accomplishes what  he has set out to do: for each one desires &lt;to give as well as receive&gt;  what is good. (Aristotle 1962, 240) ARISTOTELIS SANTAS ARISTOTELIAN ETHICS AND BIOPHILIA 103 </page> <page sequence="10"> This initial sketch of obligation is followed by a more complicated dis- cussion of obligations between “mixed friends” and “unequal friends.”  As one may surmise, mixed relations can be a source of much complaint,  especially if one’s motives for a given relationships are not clear. Aristot- le’s discussion here is interesting and insightful, but most of this discus- sion will not be my focus here. The obligation between unequal friends,  however, is very relevant for our purposes, but I will wait to develop the  analysis in the next section of this paper.  Such is Aristotle’s discussion of philia in brief. Before returning to a  discussion of biophilia as it pertains to interspecies relationships, I pause  to note that others before me have invoked Aristotle in the ongoing debate  over biophilia, moral sentiment, and the meta-ethical foundations of the  land ethic. Ernest Partridge, in discussing the biophilia hypothesis as it  pertains to J. Baird Callicott’s5 use of Aldo Leopold6 and David Hume,7  writes: Biophilia suggests that a fundamental genetic basis may exist for this  sentiment of love and respect for the land... These biophilic consider- ations suggest an environmental ethic that may be more Aristotelian  than Humean in that the “goodness” of being in tune with nature  (i.e., living in a surrounding that we evolved from and preserving the  conditions of our evolution) is a goodness interpreted as a consistency  with human nature and fulfillment. Furthermore, it is an ethic that  endorses the actualization of human potential because it suggests that  we are most likely to flourish in a natural environment, just as an  acorn can manifest its potential “oakness” in a biome that is condu- cive to the flourishing of oak trees. Thus we can accomplish our full- est potential in the Aristotelian sense—have the best kinds of lives—if  those lives can develop in an environment that is genetically natural  to us, which is to say an environment to which we are “attuned.” This,  I think, is an essential claim of biophilia that Aristotle might recognize  and, apprised of the facts, even endorse. (Partridge 2002, 32)  Here Partridge invokes Aristotle’s metaphysics to account for the sen- timent of biophilia. In the same volume, Eugene Hargrove, while rejecting  Aristotelian metaphysics,8 suggests that Aristotelian ethics could serve as  a suitable basis for this moral sentiment, which is to serve as a theoretical  underpinning for Callicott’s version of Leopold’s land ethic: Callicott must rely on passages in “The Land Ethic,” where Leopold  refers to “our intellectual emphasis, loyalties, affections, and convic- 104 ETHICS &amp; THE ENVIRONMENT, 19(1) 2014 </page> <page sequence="11"> tions,” and “love, respect, and admiration for land, and high regard  for its value.” There are... problems here... Whereas love, respect, loy- alties, affections, convictions, and so on can be tied to Hume’s notion  of moral sentiments, they could also be associated with Aristotelian  virtues, connecting Leopold’s views with my environmental ethics as  well. In both cases we have connections to biology—Darwin’s biology  and Aristotle’s biology, respectively. For example, the circles of moral  considerability from self to family to citizens is equally present in  Aristotelian philosophy and Darwinian-dependent philosophy. (Har- grove 2002, 141)  Here Hargrove is employing Aristotelian virtue ethics as an alternative  basis for a land ethic. While I agree with Hargrove’s analysis, what I am  suggesting is that a full treatment of his ethics must include a discussion of  friendship, not only because it will help articulate the nature and range of  other relations to other beings and systems, but also provide a framework  for understanding obligations arising out of biotic interrelations. FRIENDSHIP, BIOPHILIA AND ENVIRONMENTAL ETHICS I opened with an example of an interspecies relationship I had ob- served in a family aquarium. Years later, our family experienced another  example of this phenomenon between a cat and dog. The dog had adopted  us, as it were, when one day it appeared at our home and would not leave.  You might say she was a pet, but it was not an ordinary sort of human-pet  relation. She was obviously a stray, seemingly very intelligent and street  smart, and she in some sense “chose” us. She refused to be confined by  a leash or an enclosure (there were leash laws we had tried to obey), but  she would never leave our company for very long. She would come and  go as she pleased, and the dog catchers never seemed to find her. There  were many remarkable things one might say about this animal friend,  but it was her relationship to a feral kitten that amazed me the most. The  kitten had been collected by the animal pound and was to be euthanized,  but my spouse and children had rescued her in a search for a pet. She was  a beautiful kitten, but she was quite unaffectionate and generally hostile  to human touch. I myself could not understand how she made it home  to us. But there she was. One could not hold her or confine her in any  way. She would not go into a house without a measure of coercion, even  on the coldest days of winter; and it was always an awful affair to get  her anywhere she was not going under her own volition. Then something  ARISTOTELIS SANTAS ARISTOTELIAN ETHICS AND BIOPHILIA 105 </page> <page sequence="12"> happened. One day we noticed the kitten suckling on the dog. The dog  had not had puppies and therefore could offer no milk, so it appeared that  she was offering instead emotional comfort. As time passed and the kitten  matured into a cat, the two had become inseparable. They spent their  days together, they slept together (and not simply on cold nights when the  need for warmth could easily account for their behavior); and they even  hunted together. Yet with all that socialization learned and affection given  from the dog, this cat never really shared such feelings with the human  members of the family—not until, that is, the dog had died. When the dog  passed away the cat’s countenance changed. She seemed despondent, as  if she were grieving. She began to seek our company and made it known  she wanted touch and affection—she started acting more like the cats we  had known. Of course we cannot know for sure what she was feeling, but  she did change her behavior and disposition towards us with the passing  of her friend. One might say, given the foregoing analysis, that the dog and the kit- ten had initially a friendship based on usefulness—at least from the stand- point of the kitten, which evolved into one based on pleasure. One might  even surmise that there came to be some form of admiration or respect,  though this would be difficult to establish. In the relationship between the  kitten and the members of our family, you could say the relationship was  not one of friendship at all initially, though there was good will on the  part of at least some of us towards her. Later, there was usefulness, and  then after the dog passed away one could say we had a relationship based  on pleasure. In my earlier example about the bass and the crawfish in the  aquarium, there was a similar pattern. There was first antagonism, then  friendship based on usefulness (as there was need to cease hostilities in  such a confined space), then an apparent relationship of pleasure. Given these apparent parallels, and using Aristotle’s model, one might  identify three kinds of interspecies friendships: 1. Symbiotic9 (Benefit): two or more individuals or groups  from differing species associating and or cooperating in a  mutually beneficial manner 2. Hedonistic10 (Pleasure): two or more individuals or groups  from differing species associating in a mutual exchange (i.e.,  sharing) of affection 3. Kalondistic11 (Excellence): two or more individuals or  106 ETHICS &amp; THE ENVIRONMENT, 19(1) 2014 </page> <page sequence="13"> groups from differing species associating by virtue of per- ceived qualities of admirability Symbiotic relationships, also known as mutualism, can be observed in  all systems of living interactions. Whether or not one characterizes eco- systems as “biotic communities” with “stability and integrity,” there is  coexistence that is not simply competitive. (Schrader-Frechette 2002, 87– 90) In many cases there is an interdependency without which continued  existence would be difficult if not impossible. This is true of individuals,  but, more poignantly of entire species as well. Aristotle himself observed  such friendly relationships in the non-human world. In the Nicomachean  Ethics he writes: “(I)t seems that nature implants friendship in a parent  for its offspring and in offspring for its parent, not only among men, but  also among birds and most animals” (Aristotle 1962, 215). Elsewhere, in  History of Animals, he discusses relations between different species: The snake is at war with the weasel and the pig; with the weasel  when they are both at home, for they live on the same food; with  the pig for preying on her kind. The merlin is at war with the fox; it  strikes and claws it, and, as it has crooked talons, it kills the animal’s  young. The raven and the fox are good friends, for the raven is at en- mity with the merlin; and so when the merlin assails the fox the raven  comes and helps the animal.  In regard to wild creatures, some sets are at enmity with other  sets at all times and under all circumstances; others, as in the case of  man and man, at special times and under incidental circumstances.  The ass and the acanthis are enemies; for the bird lives on thistles,  and the ass browses on thistles when they are young and tender.... The  crow and the heron are friends, as also are the sedge-bird and lark,  the laedus and the celeus or green woodpecker; the woodpecker lives  on the banks of rivers and beside brakes, the laedus lives on rocks  and bills, and is greatly attached to its nesting-place. The piphinx, the  harpe, and the kite are friends; as are the fox and the snake, for both  burrow underground; so also are the blackbird and the turtle-dove.... Thus we see that in the case of the creatures above mentioned  their mutual friendship ... is due to the food they feed on and the life  they lead. (Aristotle 2013, IX, 1, emphases added)  Modern scientists, of course, will shy away from characterizing these  relations as enmities and friendships; but it is interesting to see that Aris- totle has contextualized these relationships in a way that shows continuity  with human behavior. Although there is no need to develop a full modern  ARISTOTELIS SANTAS ARISTOTELIAN ETHICS AND BIOPHILIA 107 </page> <page sequence="14"> description of this phenomenon here, I would like to emphasize that these  biotic interrelationships are part of a larger scheme of connectivity that  includes all living beings, especially as they exist in close proximity. Hedonistic relationships, especially interesting between members of  differing species, have also been widely observed, although its import has  not been fully appreciated. Humans certainly gain pleasure from their  pets and domesticated animals; and it often appears as though the feeling  is mutual. Determining the exact nature of such relationships can often  be difficult, not only because of the difficulty of determining the psycho- logical state of the non-human animal, but also because of the nature of  a relationship which is most frequently one of master and slave.12 More  interesting, perhaps, for my analysis, is the phenomenon of hedonistic  “interspecies friendship” between members of two different non-human  animals. Holland cites many such examples in the aforementioned vol- ume.13 The significance of such cases is that they seem to establish a larger  pattern of connection between species and demonstrate a capacity for  affection for a radical other that lies latent within many or most (if not  all) sentient beings. These relationships, which have been observed both in  artificial confinement and in the wild, provide a wider conception of what  J.S. Mill called “fellow feeling” (Mill 1988, 26–33) that could serve as a  rudimentary natural basis for “moral sentiment.” Kalondistic relationships, my interspecies analogue to Aristotle’s “vir- tuous friendships,” are the most difficult to characterize. The psychologi- cal qualities of admiration and respect are difficult if not impossible and  inappropriate to attribute to non-rational animals. I suspect, however,  that such qualities may exist in animals such as dogs, horses, and other  “higher” vertebrates. They are likely to exist in higher primates and ce- taceans. But even if we are somehow projecting such qualities onto our  animal brethren, I still maintain that such feelings of respect are part of an  evolving pattern of consciousness that did not emerge ex nihilo from the  human brain in a separate act of creation. In any case, these are relation- ships that seem to transcend specific benefits or hedonistic impulses. In  such relationships, one or both parties may reap no particular benefit or  pleasurable moment, yet provide something for another for no apparent  reason or anticipated reciprocity. In Aristotle’s view of these relations as  they exist between humans, the primary motivation for any such affec- tions is a desire to give, not to receive, and simply being in the company of  the other is enough to bring happiness. One might call this phenomenon  108 ETHICS &amp; THE ENVIRONMENT, 19(1) 2014 </page> <page sequence="15"> of affection a kalondistic feeling, or sentiment, whether or not it is feeling  that is (or can be) reciprocated. This “kalondistic” feeling and motivation is perhaps what Fromm  and Wilson had in mind in their characterization of biophilia, and what  is the basis for what Arne Naess termed “deep ecology.” Such an impulse  may have a genetic basis, as Wilson has hypothesized. If so, one could  argue that this impulse is likely to have emerged from a more general  feature of human sociality. One might maintain further, as does George  Herbert Mead, that sociality is an implicit feature of any being in an in- ter-acting relation to some other.14 One might even suggest, with Mead,  that the basis for such a feature inheres in all living things inasmuch as all  living things respond to their environment. This would account for why  there are affections and philia (friendships of all sorts) across species, even  when they are not reciprocated. It may also account for the phenomenon  of fondness felt by humans for abstract entities like ecosystems such as  forests and meadows, or for distant cultures and eras, for that matter. In  these latter cases there is certainly no reciprocity of affection, although  one might suggest that justice is done. We now come to the question of obligation. How does the forego- ing analysis address the question of our moral relationship to nature?  Traditional approaches to environmental meta-ethics have centered on  establishing that non-human entities are due the moral considerability we  ascribe to humans. This concept turns on the concept of intrinsic value15  and whether and how non-human entities can have value that is inde- pendent of human utility and concern. Two main theorists in this line of  thought, following the deontological and utilitarian traditions, have been  Tom Regan and Peter Singer. Both theorists use the criterion of sentience  (as opposed to rationality) as a criterion of moral considerability, and  contend that all sentient beings are due consideration in our moral deci- sion-making. Regan argues that sentient individuals have intrinsic value  and therefore have individual rights similar to those of humans (Regan  2000, 65–73). Singer’s analysis is utilitarian rather than rights-based, so  he does not speak of absolute rights of individual animals; but he main- tains that we must weigh the feelings of all other sentient beings affected  by our actions. (Singer 2000, 51–64) J. Baird Callicott criticizes both of  these theories as inadequate to the task of developing a uniquely envi- ronmental or “land” ethic, characterizing both views as mere extensions  of anthropocentric ethical systems. He maintains that these theories can- ARISTOTELIS SANTAS ARISTOTELIAN ETHICS AND BIOPHILIA 109 </page> <page sequence="16"> not address the value of entities such as ecosystems, or the value of the  land itself, since these cannot be said to be sentient in any scientific sense.  These theories, in short, cannot therefore account for the intrinsic value of  nature (Callicott 1986, 381–424). Callicott’s challenge has generated an  immense amount of debate in environmental ethics; and his own theory— which is an attempt to combine the evolutionary theory of Darwin, the  naturalistic moral philosophy of Hume, and the imperatives of American  naturalist Aldo Leopold—has been the center of much attention and con- troversy (Donner 2002, 99–205).16 Callicott’s theory of obligation employs the theory of moral senti- ments in the philosophy of David Hume. Hume, like Aristotle before him  and J.S. Mill after, had argued that humans have a natural affinity for one  another, and morality is possible only because of this affinity. He further  maintained that such a feature of human psychology was eminently use- ful, and that one can reduce all of the virtues recognized in antiquity to  traits that nature finds favorable to the continuation of the species. The  problem with this description, however, for the purposes of moral philos- ophy, is how one might move from the ‘is’ of description, to the ‘ought’ of  obligation.17 Moral theory, at least since Kant, has been reluctant to draw  normative conclusions from descriptive science. Yet the prescriptions of  modern environmentalism rely heavily on descriptive ecology. One might  say that this controversy is at the core of the contemporary debate over  the foundations of an environmental ethic. Without trying to settle this  debate here, what I hope to add to this analysis is the idea that the bi- ophilic propensity and sentiment, in all its manifestations, if described  in terms of Aristotle’s analysis of friendship, can also be considered as a  theory of obligation along Aristotelian lines. Following our previous analysis, we can outline a theory of obligation  for Symbiotic, Hedonistic and Kalondistic interspecies relationships, or  “friendships,” if you will. Symbiotic relationships, you might recall, are  those in which there are mutual exchanges of benefit. So as one entity  derives some benefit from the other, there arises an obligation to give back  in proportion to what has been received. Although the details, especially  in larger and more complex relations, may be difficult, the idea appears  to be quite simple. Obligation emerges18 in a context of interaction and  interconnection.19 One can also see here, I think, that where there is not  reciprocity, there is an inevitable dissolution of the friendly association.  110 ETHICS &amp; THE ENVIRONMENT, 19(1) 2014 </page> <page sequence="17"> With that comes a loss of benefit. In the case of individuals, the conse- quence of disparity (or dysparity) can be observed within a fraction of  a lifespan of the individuals involved. In the case of waning reciprocity  among symbiotic species, the consequences are part of an often slowly  developing evolutionary process that can only be observed over long pe- riods of time, sometimes only through a study of epochs. There are many  examples to cite here with respect to human relations to other species.  Our relationship to honeybees comes to mind. For centuries or millen- nia we have coexisted and cooperated with them, procuring their honey  while providing them with shelter. But, as is the case with many kinds  of relations, we have taken them for granted in their role as pollinators  of our flowering plants. Our agricultural practices have threatened and/ or driven them away from many places where we need them, and their  disappearance has begun to reacquaint us with their utility. Aristotle had  suggested that the trick to maintaining good useful relationships was to  make explicit our contributions and expectations in such relations (Aris- totle 1962, 241–42). The same may be said of our relation to other living  things and our ecosystems. As we become more and more clear on what  we are receiving, it becomes more and more clear what we owe in return. Hedonistic relationships, on the other hand, when they are under- taken mutually, do not create obligation; but the mutuality caveat here  is crucial. When one party gains pleasure in the company of another that  receives a detachable material benefit and not a shared affection, the rela- tionship can become complicated. What might begin as a friendly associ- ation can evolve into one of power and domination. Prostitution among  humans is an obvious example, but one can also consider the human prac- tice of feeding songbird, which might begin with setting up feeders in  one’s yard and end up with caged birds inside the home. As long as this  mutuality condition obtains, however, and the motivation of each party  is pleasurable company, these relationships are ones that come and go  with little effort or difficulty. This phenomenon seems to be no different  for interspecies relationships as it is for the pleasure-based human rela- tions with which we are all familiar. Holland’s examples bear witness to  this, as the bulk of the relationships she describes dissolve as quickly as  they begin. There is a temporary union, perhaps initiated by necessity or  benefit, and perpetuated by momentary pleasure, but unlikely to continue  without further benefit or evolution of disposition.  ARISTOTELIS SANTAS ARISTOTELIAN ETHICS AND BIOPHILIA 111 </page> <page sequence="18"> The latter point brings us to the Kalondistic level of interspecies rela- tionships, in which obligation seems moot. When the connection between  equals with mutual dispositions of admiration, questions of obligation do  not arise so long as the involved parties maintain this disposition. On the  other hand, it is not the case that there exists no reciprocity among such  parties, only that the reciprocal exchange happens naturally as a matter of  course. One might describe this course of exchange as a self-perpetuating  cycle of “stability and integrity.” Again the caveat of mutuality is crucial,  and in the kalondistic case particularly so, inasmuch as the dispositions of  admiration and respect cannot be ascribed as easily, if at all, to many of  the objects of admiration and respect. Reciprocity, in such cases, seems to  break down—and it would appear that such cases comprise a vast major- ity of these interspecies relations. The difficulty lies in the fact that objects  of admiration may be non-sentient, and hence it makes no sense to speak  of any reciprocity of affection or admiration; yet it seems to me that this  doesn’t matter. If one sentient being admires a non-sentient entity, it will  offer to it what it feels it has received. The object of admiration cannot  disappoint the admirer, if the latter understands what the object is. One  might say the obligation felt by the admirer is self-wrought, in the same  way a Kantian might say one who follows duty for its own sake because  pure duty is autonomous (Kant 1980, 49–50).  The second caveat of equality in kalondistic relationships is also cru- cial, as it is for mixed relationships among and between differing species.  When I discussed Aristotle’s treatment of unequal relationships between  humans in the earlier analysis, I mentioned that although his view is  clearly dated and largely mistaken, there was an insight there worth not- ing. He argues that women and men could never be virtuous friends,  and that neither could free men and slaves, since they are not equals,  and a relationship based on respect must be one of mutuality. So, in dis- cussing obligations between such parties, as is the case in the relations  between parent and child, the inferior must pay some combination of  benefit, pleasure and respect, while the superior provide only benefit or  pleasure. I noted, following Mill, that this insight about power can be  turned into an argument for political equality, on the assumption that  the disparity in power is contextual, if not artificial, and not natural.  Such an analysis might provide a framework for considering the issue at  hand—that is, how one might discuss obligation with respect to relation- 112 ETHICS &amp; THE ENVIRONMENT, 19(1) 2014 </page> <page sequence="19"> ships of power between radical others. Some such cases are as familiar  as they are problematic. They include for instance the enslavement of  domesticated animals in a factory-farming system of agriculture, and the  often unnecessary testing of animals in science and industry. These are  the relationships theorists and activists like Regan and Singer have done  well to point out. Others are more subtle and less obviously problematic,  if at all. Shall we consider all human-pet relationships or all forms of do- mestication as ones of slavery? These are important and heavily debated  questions; but the arguments are well worn in the environmental ethics  literature, so I will not dwell on them here. Interesting to me are the cases  in which the human has the smaller share of power, and the superior  entity shows restraint. Holland shares the example of a photographer/ diver and a leopard seal in which the latter, perfectly capable of killing  the photographer, after showing him that capability, offers instead to feed  him (Holland 2011, 135–37). This case shows a capacity for care that  is devoid of the obsequious placations one might attribute to animals  entirely at our mercy. I am fond of the story of Pelorus Jack, a porpoise off the coast of New  Zealand in the late 19th and early 20th centuries famous for having repeat- edly and for many years guided sailors through the perilous waters of  Cook Strait. The story is even more interesting in the present context inas- much as Pelorus Jack, as legend has it, elected to stop guiding one particu- lar boat after one of its passengers fired a shot at him. The ship in question  apparently ended up wrecked, while others continued to be guided safely  through the area. One might surmise that such a case is kalondistic, that  there may be here something analogous to Aristotle’s virtuous friendship.  One might suggest, that is, that this is not a relationship of inequality, but  one of equals in which one member elects to help the other without regard  for what might be offered in return;20 but I think that this case might also  demonstrate that inequality is in fact context-bound, and never simply  a matter of the fixed hierarchies or natural kinds posited by traditional  philosophy. Being superior with respect to one quality does not amount to  superiority in every other. We can further add that any given superiority  existing at a given time is only temporary and not a static state of affairs.  Abilities are as diverse as our needs. Power waxes and wanes. This is most  evidently true for humans today as we face the ecological consequences  of our loss of restraint. The more capable we become of eradicating entire  ARISTOTELIS SANTAS ARISTOTELIAN ETHICS AND BIOPHILIA 113 </page> <page sequence="20"> species, the more dependencies we discover that we possess, as our posi- tion of power becomes ever more precarious. CONCLUSIONS: TOWARDS A NEW CONCEPTION OF  BIOPHILIA E.O. Wilson conceived of biophilia as a human love for all forms of  life. He hoped to establish that this phenomenon was a genetic basis for a  new environmental ethic grounded in natural science. He wrote: It is time to invent moral reasoning of a new and more powerful kind,  to look to the very roots of motivation and understand why, in what  circumstances and on which occasions, we cherish and protect life.  The elements from which a deep conservation ethic might be con- structed include the impulses and biased forms of learning loosely  classified as biophilia. Ranging from the awe of the serpent to the ide- alization of the savannah and the hunter’s mystique, and undoubtedly  including others yet to be explored, they are poles toward which the  developing mind most comfortably moves. And as the mind moves,  picking its way through the vast number of choices made during a  lifetime, it grows into a form true to its long, unique evolutionary  history. (Wilson 1984, 138–39) This endeavor to establish a “deep conservation ethic” on a genetically  encoded human bias or sentiment which he calls biophilia has its focus on  human motivation and agency.  In contrast to Wilson, what I have hoped to establish is that human  love for living things, what he calls biophilia, is part of a larger phenom- enon of affection that the Greeks called philia, and that this capacity is  part of a larger context of biotic interconnection. I have argued that an  Aristotelian framework utilizing his analysis of philia, coupled with what  we now understand about ecosystems and biotic interconnection, can en- hance our modern conception of biophilia. To summarize, I have argued  that:  a. All living things have the capacity for peaceful coexistence  (symbiotic philia);  b. All sentient living things have the capacity for affectionate  attachment with others within and beyond their species (he- donistic philia); and  c. Many sentient beings seem to have the capacity for affec- 114 ETHICS &amp; THE ENVIRONMENT, 19(1) 2014 </page> <page sequence="21"> tion based on respect, admiration, or some rudimentary an- alogue of this feeling (kalondistic philia). Furthermore, with respect to obligation, whereas the previous approaches  centering on the question of values in nature have focused on individual  entities (members of a species, species themselves, or ecosystems) having  or conceiving these values, my approach has its focus on the web of rela- tionships among biota, the existence of affectionate attachments and an  ever-present potential for such, and the obligations that may arise among  biota under conditions of proximity and interaction. In summary, there  are three levels of interaction that produce the conditions of obligation: 1. Interactions of mutual benefit and interdependency create  conditions that necessitate a reciprocity without which the  relationship cannot persist, and may threaten the existence  of any of the involved parties (obligations of benefit); 2. Interactions of mutual affection create conditions of natural  reciprocity that exist without need of obligation (reciproc- ity of pleasure) 3. Interactions of admiration and respect create conditions  of self-motivated reciprocity in which giving and receiving  persist in a state of stability and integrity without obliga- tion—as long as the motivation for the interaction contin- ues to be motivated by respect (reciprocity of virtue) In closing, I’d like to return to my earlier characterization of Aristo- telian ethics as an excellence-based ethic, where virtue (arête) is conceived  as excellence in functionality in a web of social relationships. Near the end  of his analysis of friendship, Aristotle reminds us that a friend is another  self, (Aristotle 1962, 266) and that our own happiness and well-being can  only exist in concert with others. In his view, there were always and at all  levels relationships in concord or discord. We could speak of individual  persons, two or three people in association, species or nation states in the  same way. There is harmonious cooperation—between parts of a psyche,  or individuals, or groups—and there is disputation and war, all depend- ent on the presence or absence of parity and balance. This conception of  nested interconnections accounts for why he did not think that egoism  was a significant problem for ethical theory, although, even in his time, it  was a huge problem in ethical conduct. There is good egoism and bad ego- ARISTOTELIS SANTAS ARISTOTELIAN ETHICS AND BIOPHILIA 115 </page> <page sequence="22"> ism. Whether it is good or bad is a function of whether the self has been  enlarged enough to see its connection to a larger web of social life21 (Aris- totle 1962, 260–63). What I have suggested in addition to this analysis is  that this feature of sociality is part of a larger phenomenon of connection  between all living things. We can feel connected to other humans because  we are living things, and all sentient beings can feel connected to each  other and to their homes.22 Because of this, even enmity and competition  can be transformed, under the right circumstances, into peaceful coex- istence, and even affectionate attachment. Even biophobia,23 which also  appears to have some genetic basis, can be contextualized and mitigated  where appropriate.24 Holmes Rolston III, in his critique of Wilson, argues that his approach  to biophilia, which tries to ground the concept in a selfish individual by  virtue of “selfish genes,” has significant drawbacks (Rolston 1993, 381– 414). The problem here is age-old, and has been with us since the advent  of modernism and its attendant individualism: how does one generate an  ethic out of selfish feelings? Rolston comments: Wilson is finding it difficult to get biophilia out of selfish genes. That  is because a single gene is really, so to speak, only a fragment of bi- ophilia, a bit of life information...there is no self there to be selfish  about (Rolston 1993, 413). Rolston sees that a self is more than an isolated atomistic individual, com- prised of other such randomly assembled micro-individual genetic cod- ings. He wonders why someone who feels such profound love to all living  things need retreat to such reductionism, as if assembling the whole from  its parts will fully explain the dynamic interrelations. He concludes: There is no need for a person with such an admirable love of life to  retreat into a killjoy explanation of his love. Why not rise to a joyous  explanation?.... The planet loves life and so do we. This is the evolu- tionary epic, and we are this love of life become conscious of itself.  (Rolston 1993, 413) Perhaps we have returned to the ancient Greek cosmology that saw  Love (philia) as Empedocles’ law of attraction—the binding force which  brings all things together (Kaufman 1968, 35–37). I am reminded of Pla- to’s Symposium, where Aristophanes tells the story of our four-legged  human ancestors, who, because their power threatened the natural order  116 ETHICS &amp; THE ENVIRONMENT, 19(1) 2014 </page> <page sequence="23"> of things, were cut in half so that they may find humility (Kaufman 1968,  136–39). Today it seems we have more power than ever, yet our position  on the planet seems more precarious than ever—and we are missing more  than the other half of our human nature. We have been detached, through  our own efforts, from our evolutionary history, and we are now, seem- ingly, in the twilight of our reign over the Earth. Environmental scientists  and philosophers like Leopold, Wilson, Naess, Rolston, and Callicott have  been trying to show us a way back to another missing part of us—a func- tional connection to nature. Biophilia is a name for such a feeling, but it  is also part of a larger system of connectivity that we share with all living  things. NOTES  1 This dictionary is the Greek language equivalent of the Oxford English Dic- tionary. I am grateful to both Constantine Santas and Lily C. Vuong, who  were kind enough to translate the entries for me into English.  2 Apparently there is at least one thing Aristotle did not learn from his teacher.   3 More than two thousand years later, John Stuart Mill will turn this argument  on its head and make it into a reason for woman’s emancipation. (1988a,  98–103)  4 Aristotle spends a good deal of time here discussing complaints between  friends; and it is in this context that the discussion of obligation seems to  arise.  5 Callicott’s view is well summarized in his essay “The Search for an Environ- mental Ethic” (1986, 381–424).  6 See Aldo Leopold, “The Land Ethic,” in A Sand County Almanac (1976,  237–64).  7 David Hume’s theory of morals and their foundation in sentiment can be  found in his Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals (2005), and in the  third book of A Treatise of Human Nature. (1983, Bk. III )  8 Hargrove rejects Aristotle’s metaphysics because he rejects the enterprise of  metaphysics itself, though he sees ontology as an important enterprise. See his  “Environmental Ethics without Metaphysics” (2002, 135–49).  9 I am following here what I understand as the common biological use of the  term.  10 I use the term ‘hedonistic’ here with some reservation, given the modern col- loquial usage, but I prefer to side with history here and choose to ignore the  contemporary and perhaps temporary kidnapping of the concept.  11 I suggest the term ‘kalondistic’ owing to the Greek kalón (τò καλόν), meaning  ‘beauty’ or ‘goodness.’ ARISTOTELIS SANTAS ARISTOTELIAN ETHICS AND BIOPHILIA 117 </page> <page sequence="24">  12 See above and below for a discussion of friendships between unequals. See  also Paul Shepard, “On Animal Friends,” for a critique of pet-friend develop- ment as substitute for exposure to wild animals (1993, 275–300).  13 Almost all of Holland’s examples are in this category; and this is by design.  See her explanation in her Introduction (Holland 2011, x–xii).  14 Mead discusses this ability as a generalized sort of “taking the attitude of the  other” in The Philosophy of the Act (Mead, 1938) A complete discussion of  this feature of the human mind is in Mind, Self and Society from the stand- point of a social behaviorist (Mead 1934).   15 I have argued elsewhere that (1) value is an emergent property of natural sys- tems in which relations of connectivity arise, and (2) that intrinsic value is a  feature of ecosystems whereby the phenomenon of multifunctionality occurs  within complex relations of interconnectivity. See “The Environmental Value  in G.H. Mead’s Cosmology” (Santas 1996, 73–83) and “A Pragmatic Theory  of Intrinsic Value.” (Santas 2002, 93–104) My approach here, though com- patible with those analyses, is independent of these considerations, so I will  not repeat the arguments here.   16 For a concise treatment of the debate see Wendy Donner, “Callicott on Intrin- sic Value and Moral Standing in Environmental Ethics” (2002, 99–105).  17 It is even a bit ironic that Callicott invokes Hume here, given that the gulf  between ‘ought’ and ‘is’ has been dubbed as “Hume’s Law.”  18 I use the term here mindful of Mead’s discussion of emergent properties.  (Mead 1938, 615–6)  19 In pre-Socratic cosmology, this principle was equivalent to cause and effect.  Whether benefit or harm, one is due what one has dished out. It is the law of  nature, whether we see it in the cycle of seasons, or in the cycles of revenge  the Orestia.   20 Contrast this action to that of a porpoise in a water park, doing tricks for fish.  21 In this same vein, Rolston invokes Naess’ deep ecology to shed light on the  question of the self winning or losing with respect to the environment. He  too, following Naess, opts for the enlarged self and “self-realization” as at  least “moving in the right direction.” See Holmes Rolston, “Winning and Los- ing in Environmental Ethics” (1994, 224).  22 One might employ the word ‘care’ here instead of ‘connected,’ as Holmes Rol- ston does in “Care on Earth: Generating Informed Concern” (2010, 204–45).  Rolston’s analysis tries to show how caring (attraction, “pacting”), broadly  conceived, can be shown to be a part of the Earth’s evolutionary history.  23 Biophobia is juxtaposed biophilia and is defined most generally as an aver- sion to nature and other living things. See David W. Orr, “Love It or Lose It:  The Coming Biophilia Revolution” (1993, 413–40). Orr conceives biopho- bia here as culturally fostered and perpetuated throughout the modern era.  Natural scientists on the other hand conceive of it as at least partly genetic  118 ETHICS &amp; THE ENVIRONMENT, 19(1) 2014 </page> <page sequence="25"> predisposition to acquire negative associations and persistent fears of certain  natural objects (notably, spiders and snakes). For a review of the literature on  the genetic basis of Biophobia see Roger S. Urlich, “Biophilia, Biophobia, and  Natural Landscapes” (1993, 76-86).  24 I say ‘where appropriate’ because instinctive fears and aversions can obvi- ously have evolutionary value. The problem arises only where these are over- generalized. Respectful aversion of water moccasins while canoeing is one  thing; killing a red rat snake for being in your barn is another.
