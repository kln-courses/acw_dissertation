<plain_text><page sequence="1">The God of the Gawain-Poet LAWRENCE M. CLOPPER Indiana University In characterizing the God of the Gawain-poet, I intend to respond to those critics who have found that God to be cantankerous, annoy- ing, and overly human, particularly in Cleanness and Patience.l Spe- cifically, I want to contest the idea that the poet anthropomorphizes the deity to such an extent that he gives him a number of common human failings. Such readings arise from a dual misunderstanding: first, of the care with which the poet uses epithets for the divine, and second, of his larger purpose in using these as he does. It is not the poet qua poet who anthropomorphizes the deity but, rather, char- acters in the poems or, sometimes, the narrator. My argument will be that the poet accepts the distinction of the moderni between God's potentia absoluta and his potentia ordinata-indeed, he makes this a subject of some of his poems-and that his use of this distinction allows readers to "misread" the poems, much as Jonah misreads God's action with regard to himself. The poet builds in this misinterpret- ability, I argue, in order to demonstrate that those who imagine God to be an irrational and arbitrary being suffer from a profound mis- conception of the absoluteness and otherness of God at the same time that they fail to recognize God's merciful covenantal relation- ship with mankind.2 Before proceeding further, however, I want to make quite clear my understanding of the poet's relationship to the discussion of God's two powers. I do not wish to suggest that the poet is trying to translate into poetry the distinction between the two powers so that 1. See W. A.

If God were entirely open to the operations of reason, then man could ultimately achieve what was denied him in the garden of Eden; he would become like God, having full knowl- edge of the deity and his works. Nevertheless, the proposition that God's potentia ordinata exists within his potentia absoluta is useful be- cause it suggests a deity both known and Other and implies that the knowledge of such a deity can enlarge faith if one does not probe the limits of the relationship too deeply. Indeed, it could be argued that it was not even necessary that the poet believe the proposition to be either a true or an accurate description of God's powers. It is the idea's utility, its capacity to suggest mystery and to awe, that was most important to him. Some of the most common names for the deity-God and Lord- might not seem very revealing indicators of the Gawain-poet's char- acterization of God, yet the frequency with which these names occur in each of the poems and, perhaps more important, how they are modified, can prove quite informative. Cleanness pictures God as an autocratic ruler who is both courtly and seemly; the words that mod- ify "God" are "worthy," "athel," "comly and clene," "gaynly," and "god- lych." Some of the modifiers are traditional biblical ones like "great" and "high"; another, "maynful," has both courtly and theological con- notations, "gracious" and "mighty, powerful." From these adjectives, one gets a sense of God as an aristocratic and powerful lord. But we can go further by noting that the Gawain-poet uses "Fader" only twelve times in his entire corpus, and nine of those instances occur in Cleanness.4 Indeed, since Cleanness is made up mostly of Old Testa- 3. Both Larry Eldredge and William J. Courtenay have shown that the distinction was used less (and used with less subtlety) in the second half of the fourteenth century. See Larry Eldredge, "The Concept of God's Absolute Power at Oxford in the Later Fourteenth Century," in By Things Seen: Reference and Recognition in Medieval Thought, ed. David L. Jeffreys (Ottawa, 1979), pp. 211-26; and William J. Courtenay, Capacity and Volition: A History of the Distinction of Absolute and Ordained Power (Ber- gamo, 1990). 4.

Clopper o The God of the "Gawain"-Poet ment stories, we might expect the names throughout the text to de- scribe God the Father or the deity in his essence, and this is the case, except for the passage in which the narrator speaks of Christ's "cour- tesye." The Father and Christ are both presented as courtly nobles, but the Father tends to be "athel" and "worthy," whereas Christ is "courteous" and "kyrious." The word sets distinguish the older, dis- tant Father or Lord from the younger "courtier," the present Christ. Although recast here in aristocratic terms, the distinction is theo- logically traditional: the Father's appropriated attributes are might, power, lordship, and righteousness; the Son's are wisdom, sapience, and mercy. Given his incarnation, Christ is also more clearly acces- sible than the Father. We can see something of the orientation of each of the four poems by looking at unique verbal occurrences within them. Pearl, perhaps not surprisingly, is the only poem to refer to Christ as the Lamb; however, it is also the only one to use "Jesu" (except for one reference in Sir Gawain, line 774). It is not surprising that the Maiden refers to her Lamb as "Juelle," but Pearl is the only poem to use "Lemman" to refer to Christ.5 There are four other unique names in Pearl: "Fasor," "Cheuetayn," "Resoun," and "Almighty," all seeming to recall the Father rather than the Son.6 In another variation, Patience uses "Wy3e" and "Renk" to name God, but these are both Jonah's epi- thets, whereas in Cleanness, they are the narrator's. By contrast, there are only two instances in which "lede" is used: in Cleanness, line 1093, with regard to Christ, where it would be an appropriate reference to his humanity, and in Patience, line 281, when Jonah uses it inappropri- ately to refer to God and thereby diminishes God's omnipotence. "Saviour," rather surprisingly, appears only four times in the corpus: three times it translates the Vulgate Deus in the sixth beatitude (in Cleanness and Patience), and Abraham uses it after the scene under the oaks at Mamre, perhaps in order to sustain that scene's fusion of Old and New Testament teaching. My purpose in listing these examples is not to suggest that the Gawain-poet's divine vocabulary is rich-it certainly is-but that it is particular; it is deployed with considerable consciousness of appro- priate usage and connotation in the context of each narrative. Ac- cordingly, if we analyze the variety of names for the deity both across 5. Pearl also uses "Gyltlez," and, if the emendation at line 690 is correct, it is the only poem of the four to employ "Koyntise," which I take to be wisdom or sapience, the attribute of the second person. 6.

Although God's generosity is suggested in Cleanness by his making of covenants with mankind, some readers find disconcerting the dom- inant portrayal of God as an irrational and wrathful being.7 A. C. Spearing faults the poet for dissipating the power and mystery of God. W. A. Davenport consistently characterizes God in these poems as irrational, unprovoked, emotional, and unmotivated, even though he acknowledges that God grows in moral stature as we move through the various episodes.8 Malcolm Andrew and Ronald Waldron seem generally to concur when they say that the poet's humanizing of God "is very much at odds with the tradition of medieval Christian com- mentators, who took care to preserve the mysterious and unknow- able quality of God's ways."9 Spearing's and Davenport's New Critical readings, and even that of Andrew and Waldron, represent modern responses to this "alterior" text rather than responses that the mod- erni might have had. Indeed, David Wallace has objected to Andrew and Waldron's interpretation on the grounds that the humanizing of God makes him more mysterious and unpredictable-a better reading, it seems to me.'0 Before pursuing Wallace's point, however, I want to stress the fact that God is "humanized" in much of the book of Genesis: he "plants" a garden in Eden (Gen. 2:6); he walks in the garden in the cool of the day (Gen. 3:8); when he sees the wickedness of man, he is "sorry" and "grieves in his heart" that he made mankind and decides to destroy them because he is "sorry" he made them (Gen. 6:6-7). God speaks directly with Noah and appears to Abraham as a Lord and as Three Angels. When he and Abraham bargain over Sodom and Gomorrah, God says he has heard the outcry from Sodom and will go down to see if it is true (Gen. 18:20-21), which suggests that he is neither omnipresent nor omniscient.

Clopper o The God of the "Gawain "-Poet characterization of Jehovah as a God of vengeance and righteousness, could easily result in the overly "humanized" portrayal of God in the Gawain-poet's Old Testament narratives. Indeed, a literalist reading of these narratives requires an anthro- pomorphic representation of the God of the Old Testament. The narrator of Cleanness opens the poem with the observation that "pe Wy3 pat wro3t alle hinges" is "wonder wroth" with the filthy who present themselves to God's sight (line 5). When God considers destroying the world, the narrator says he is like a man sorrowing within himself: "As wy3e wo hym withinne, werp to Hymseluen" (line 284).1n Indeed, the vocabulary used to name the deity throughout Cleanness helps construct a "wy3e" who is an autocratic ruler and patriarch: he is Father, Creator, Lord, King, and Sovereign.l2 This vocabulary helps to establish the Old Testament aura of the text. More particularly, the poet merges the locution "Dry3tyn"-an English equivalent for the God of the Genesis narratives-with the narrator's other names for God in order to emphasize his father- hood, sovereignty, and righteousness. We are told that "Dry3tyn" drove Satan to the abyss (line 214), that he forbade the eating of the fruit of the tree (line 243), and that Noah lives in fear of "Dry3tyn" (line 295). The narrator calls God "Drysten" when God speaks to Noah (line 344), whereas Noah uses "Lord" in direct ad- dress. The narrator also describes Lot's looking at the plains that he owned and that are said to be like the paradise "Dry3tyn" planted (line 1007, echoing Gen. 2:8); the narrator argues that if one wishes to deal "drwrye" with "Dry3tyn" one must conform oneself to Christ (line 1065), phraseology that suggests Christ's role as intermediary between man and the Father; the narrator says that "Dry3tyn" is 11. It is also perhaps significant that the three angels who appear to Abraham are called "Wy3es" (line 606). 12. For 'Father', see Cleanness, lines 542, 681, 729, 919, 1051, 1175, 1229, 1722, 1726. 'Creator' is used only in Cleanness, lines 191, 394, 917 (also unique is "Worcher of pis worlde" [line 1501]). 'Lord' occurs in all four texts, but Cleanness is distinctive in using "that Lorde pbat pe lyft made" (lines 212, 1493) or variants (lines 5, 510-11, 1528; this is unique except for the debated usage in Sir Gawain, line 1256); moreover, 'Lord' is of- ten modified in Cleanness, rarely so in the other poems, and creates an image of a "Sire" who is "Souerayn." For 'King', see lines 17, 50, 393, 546, and 1628; the "Kyng of nature" at line 1087 is the only one to refer to Christ. 'Souerayn' occurs fifteen times in the corpus, of which thirteen are in Cleanness (lines 93, 178, 210, 552, 557, 780, 1152, 1225, 1289, 1313, 1454, 1643, 1670) and one in Patience (line 429). Of the thirteen, eleven occurrences are names of God, one is the name of the king in the parable, and one is an adjective modifying 'Lord'. In every instance the term is used by the narrator, not one of the characters. 5</page><page sequence="6">MODERN PHILOLOGY offended by the soiling of sacred dishes and vessels that were in- tended for use in the temple where the "'solefast Dry3tyn" expounds his speeches spiritually to the prophets (lines 1146 and 1491). In all of these passages one gets a sense of "Dry3tyn" as the Creator, the Father, the Judge, the Lord of Righteousness. But can it not be argued that, in creating such an anthropomor- phic picture of the deity, Cleanness engages in a misconstruction of God? I believe such an argument can indeed be made, but doing so is complicated by the fact that the poet is also giving a literalist reading of his Old Testament texts. There are, then, two perspectives in Cleanness that must be considered: the creation of a poem that echoes Old Testament texts; and the significance to be attached to the anthropomorphic God these texts offer us. When the poet ad- heres closely to his biblical sources, he lends great authority to his thesis that God will treat man's "vnkyndenesse" with strict justice. But it does not follow that the poet is implying that God is as irrational as those he punishes. Rather, the "humanized" God of Cleanness rep- resents the way men perceive and understand the deity, as opposed to the way he actually is. This perspective challenges-or perhaps adds to-Wallace's view that the "humanizing" of God makes him more mysterious and unpredictable. I would like to reformulate the position in order to stress that, in the poet's view, the way mankind knows God is not ultimately descriptive of what God is. I believe the poet's descriptions of God as aristocratic ruler are in- tended to portray God as he has chosen to reveal himself to man in biblical texts and the texts dependent on them. God could have cho- sen to reveal himself in any number of ways, but he elected-through the parable used at the beginning of Cleanness, for example-to make himself known in terms that worldly men could understand. Moreover, Cleanness presents itself as a kind of history of the effects of such revelation on mankind. In the early portions of the narrative we see God constrain his absolute freedom by making a series of covenants with the faithful few. This is an evolving relationship: such covenants make God better known, more human; at the same time, as God reveals himself in human terms, he distances his true nature- and literal presence-from mankind. After he destroys the world by flood, he assures Noah that he will never do so again; after reveal- ing his triune nature to Abraham under the oak at Mamre, he prom- ises to provide the patriarch with a son and makes a covenant to protect his line; he is even willing to negotiate with Abraham as they walk toward Sodom because Abraham is a faithful and obedient man (although in his bartering Abraham does not strike one as par- 6</page><page sequence="7">Lawrence M. Clopper o The God of the "Gawain"-Poet ticularly humble). But as history unfolds, God presents himself less and less in the world in his own person. He does not appear to Lot but rather sends angelic emissaries. In the Babylonian narrative, only a part of him-his hand-is present, and his vengeance is carried out indirectly, by means of Balshazzar's enemies. As we move through this chronological sequence of Old Testament narratives in which God distances his person, we also see him gradu- ally diminish the degree of devastation visited on mankind. Whereas he destroyed all of humankind in the Flood, he tells Abraham he is willing to spare Sodom if only a few are found to be unfilthy. God's anger toward the human race narrows to focus on Sodom even though the destruction of the city seems more absolute and long- lived than that of the flood. However we may understand the nar- rative of Christ's "courtesye" to fit in the larger structure of the poem, it is clear that this is the Christ of a New Covenant assuring mercy and forgiveness to all who repent, although the ensuing narrative suggests that God the Father's righteousness will still be visited on those who wallow in their sins, lapping their wine like dogs and stain- ing the vessels of the Holy God with their lustful caresses. Yet God's vengeance at the conclusion is powerfully focused on the individual sleeping Belshazzar. For all this humanizing of the deity in the poem, there are also suggestions of God's otherness that reveal the defects in men's ten- dency to anthropomorphize. This doubleness-God's decision to re- veal himself as he does and man's inability to conceive of him other than in worldly terms-is a consequence of God's exercise of his potentia ordinata. Although the deity freely chooses to limit himself, making himself known only within the narrow confines of the ways he chooses to interact with humanity, his otherness is suggested by his apparently arbitrary dealing out of vengeance on both the just and the unjust because of the sins of the unjust and in the limited way that mankind's vocabulary can attempt to express the actions of the deity. For example, when the poet emphasizes God's anger or the way his mood changes from benevolence to wrath, the attribu- tion of emotion and changeability to the deity suggests qualities that simply cannot be said to exist in God, since change of any sort would imply imperfection rather than Unity, Reason, Esse. Under these circumstances, the poet makes an extremely risky move when he sympathetically portrays the majority of the people destroyed in the Flood, since our gaze is turned for a moment from the justified destruction of the world to those humans who are about to be drowned. 7</page><page sequence="8">MODERN PHILOLOGY And alle His [God's] pyte departed fro peple pat He hated.

(Lines 396-402) The risk involved in this passage is that the reader may identify with the victims and consequently see God as unconcerned with moral responsibility. Are all these people filthy? Or are they destroyed, as it would seem, because of the filth of others? Ultimately, the anthropomorphic description of the deity as an ar- bitrary tyrant indicates the inadequacy of human perception and its system of signs. Further, even though God limits himself within the ordinata, he remains inscrutable; he chooses not to destroy his crea- tion, voluntarily agrees to limit his vengeance to those who are sin- ful, and freely offers redemption to those who make themselves clean-but why "fylpe" should be more obnoxious than the betrayal of "trawpe" remains fundamentally unknowable. 13 Of all the poems in the manuscript, Cleanness illustrates most clearly God's covenantal relationship with mankind, the manifesta- tion of his potentia ordinata. But the potential ordinata always operates within God's potentia absoluta; the one is not opposed to the other. The vocabulary in Patience offers the strongest case for the poet's abiding concern with the relationship between God's two powers. To establish this point, I want first to note the differences between the narrator's and Jonah's epithets for God; then I will place the narrator's vocabulary within the distinction between God's potentia absoluta and his potentia ordinata and within the discourse on the relation of God's foreknowledge to future contingents. These two areas are related, since God's foreknowledge must be absolute if God is to be God, yet he has determined (ordained) not to act in certain ways so that men may have freedom of will. Jonah does not recognize these distinctions, thinking instead that God is absolutely tyrannical and arbitrary; however, the narrator through his own 13. Having said that the reason for God's rage at acts against "kynde" is inscrutable, I would like tentatively to add that the poet might be trying to suggest that acts against "kynde" are acts against the "God-ness" in man and that it is the violation of esse that makes them stink more in the nostrils of God than "untrawpe." See Jonathan A. Glenn, "Dislocation of Kyndein the Middle English Cleanness," Chaucer Review 18 (1983): 77-91. 8</page><page sequence="9">Lawrence M. Clopper o The God of the "Gawain"-Poet specialized vocabulary presents the events so as to acknowledge God's absoluteness at the same time that he insists on God's mercy in ac- cordance with the relationship God voluntarily established with man- kind (demonstrated in this case by his allowing Jonah to act freely and forgiving the Ninevites when they repent, even though he has sent Jonah to say that God intends to destroy them). The narrator's epithets suggest that he understands God to be an omnipotent, omniscient, "other" being, whereas the ones Jonah is made to utter suggest that, to the reluctant prophet, the deity is this-worldly. 14 Although they share some names for the deity-Lord, God, Sire, Prince-the narrator alone uses "Fader," "Hy3e Heuen- Kyng," "Souerayn," "Welder of Wit," "Wyrde," and "Dry3tyn."15 Jonah alone uses "Lede," "Man," "Renk," and "Wy3e."'6 The vocabulary sug- gests that Jonah imagines God to be a local lord whose power only extends over a limited area and who, while he can command indi- viduals, at times ignores or overlooks them because a single man is insignificant among such multitudes. The only time that Jonah ad- dresses God as the Maker-as opposed to the man ("Wy3") "pat al pe world planted" (line 111)-is when he is embittered and intends to be insulting (line 482). Although the "Wy3 pat al be world planted" is an echo of Genesis, Jonah's phrasing-God the Farmer-seems considerably more worldly than that in Genesis. By contrast, the narrator imagines the deity to be the heavenly king without limits on power-including without limits on what ap- pears to be self-contradiction (e.g., God's intention to destroy Nin- eveh and his decision to spare it). He does not imagine God as a fully 14. This brief discussion of names derives from my essay "Patience: Meditations on a Whale and a Woodbine," Mediaevalia 14 (1991): 171. My reading modifies Spearing's otherwise persuasive analysis. 15. Patience, lines 91, 337 (Fader); 129 (Hy3e Heuen Kyng); 257 (Souerayn); 429 (Welder of Wit); 247 (Wyrde); and 110, 214, 294, 371, 445 (Dry3tyn). The poet's use of "Dry3tyn" in the other poems is consistent with Patience. Cleanness uses "Dry3ten" eigh- teen times, Patience and Sir Gawain five times each, and Pearl twice. Of these thirty instances, "Dry3ten" is used only by the narrators except for two uses in Pearl (by the Maiden), two in Sir Gawain (by Gawain), and one in Cleanness (by Daniel). Further- more, in twelve instances "Dry3ten" is not part of the alliterative pattern; instead it has the fourth accent and appears as the last word in the line. These instances indicate that the poet chose "Dry3ten" rather than some other epithet for "God," which in turn reassures us that the poet did not intrude the term into his poem merely for the purposes of alliteration. "Dry3ten" normally serves as a name to suggest God in his potentia absoluta. The poet reserves its usage to refer to the God of the Old Testament (especially as Creator and as prone to wrath) and God as Other. 16. Patience, lines 281 (Lede); 320 (Man); 323 (Renk); and 111, 206 (Wy3e). 9</page><page sequence="10">MODERN PHILOLOGY anthropomorphic being, for he does not have him appear before Jonah and speak to him; rather, God's speeches are represented as sounds or voices in the ear: "Goddes glam to hym glod" (line 63), "a wynde of Goddez worde efte be wy3e bruxlez" (line 345), the "soun of oure Souerayn pen swey in his ere" (line 429), and "oure Lorde to pe lede laused a speche" (line 489). More important is the fact that the narrator alone introduces Old English epithets ("Wyrde," "Dry3tyn") into the poem to suggest God's ultimate otherness and un- knowability. Consequently, God is not represented as being present in the world, although his power and mercy are inarguably immanent and evident. He causes events to occur through intermediaries-the winds, the seas, the whale, and even Jonah-and the poet goes to some trouble to detail the way in which God calls the winds to create the storm (lines 129-44), which suggests that God works chiefly by means of the natural laws he has ordained. In the woodbine scene, the narrator's "Dry3tyn" is the God of Job who speaks from the whirlwind, who created Leviathan, and who set the four corners of the world. God insistently calls Jonah "renk" for presuming to ques- tion his order and implies that he acts according to an inscrutable inner logic that he asserts to be just and merciful (lines 522-23). I do not mean to suggest that these two vocabularies represent in themselves God's potentia absoluta (the narrator's view) and his potentia ordinata (Jonah's view), for Jonah's references to God reveal his very limited understanding of God's nature. On the one hand, his lan- guage reflects a common misconstruction of God's nature-imagin- ing him to be manlike-and, on the other, it reveals man's incapacity to imagine God's absoluteness correctly. Nevertheless, the two po- tentiae exist in the poem in the very problem posed by God's com- mand to Jonah to tell the Ninevites that God intends to destroy them when, in fact, they will eventually be converted and saved. It would appear that the prophecy was false and that God, therefore, had lied to Jonah or was merely toying with his reluctant prophet. Patience, as a consequence, is a poetic analogue to the theological problem of the relation between God's foreknowledge and man's freedom of will, a problem that the distinction between God's two potentiae was partly intended to resolve. Jonah becomes angry because he feels that God has made him into a false prophet. If God has indeed deceived Jonah, then this would suggest that God is not wholly good. But such a conclusion cannot be true; it follows that either God cannot deceive-which would appear to be a false statement, since this would limit God's will and power- or else that the "deception" is not a deception or not evil. William of 10</page><page sequence="11">Lawrence M. Clopper o The God of the "Gawain"-Poet Ockham had reasoned that in order to retain God's omnipotence and future contingents, it is necessary to allow the possibility that God can deceive, since, according to his potentia absoluta, he can do any- thing he wills; however, Ockham denied that God deceives, since for God to will evil would be an internal contradiction. Therefore, any "deception" God wills must necessarily be good. 17 This is the situation in the poem. When, contrary to Jonah's ex- pectation, the Ninevites are converted rather than destroyed, he claims that God has deceived him. However, according to Ockham's theory, he ought to have known that all of God's statements about the future are known to God infallibly yet are also contingent (capable of being either true or false). These two statements appear to be con- tradictory, but both are matters of faith: the first asserts God's omni- science; the second asserts man's freedom, since if all statements made by God were necessarily true, then man's actions would be predetermined and his will annihilated. Can a prophecy not be neces- sarily true if it is the word of God? Are all prophecies potentially deceptions? Not at all, Ockham says; citing the case of Jonah, he characterizes prophecies as disguised conditionals: "[Unless they re- pent,] the Ninevites will be destroyed."'l8 God knows whether the Ninevites will repent and be saved or not repent and be destroyed, but his statement to Jonah remains contingent since, until the time of their destruction, they have the choice to exercise their will to repent. If they did not do so, then their actions would be prede- termined. We may conclude that Jonah is like one of those poor fourteenth-century university students who could never quite un- derstand the vexed question of future contingents. Or perhaps his is the figure of Bradwardine faced with the abstruse logic of the New Pelagians. But is not Jonah forced to go to Nineveh, and, if he is, is not God culpable in rendering Jonah a figure of ridicule and falsehood? Not at all, for we are shown that Jonah intends to go to Tarsus rather than 17. Ockham distinguishes between man's will, which acts against God's precepts when it deceives someone, and God's will, which cannot act against his own pre- cepts. Hence, whatever God wills is precept, even if it is "deception." See A. Edidin and C. Normore, "Ockham on Prophecy," International Journal for Philosophy of Religion 13 (1982): 186-87. 18.

He chooses to exercise his free will not to obey God's com- mand. While it is true that God "coerces" Jonah by raising the storm, he also sends the whale to save Jonah. Thus God offers Jonah another chance to accept his mission, which he does when, in the whale's belly, he submits his will to God's. The image of God guiding the whale through the waters with Jonah in its belly is the perfect illustration-though unknown to Jonah-of how God's potentia or- dinata operates within his potentia absoluta. One could regard the whale's swallowing and harboring of Jonah as an act contrary to the laws of nature and thus a violation of the ordinata by a deity who is free to act even against the laws he has assigned the world. Yet the narrator tells us that God cups the whale's body and directs it through the waters as a sign that he has chosen to intervene mercifully in the world. God does not force Jonah to make the right choice; while moving providentially toward Nineveh, Jonah operates freely within the universe, the whale, designed for him by God as a playground in which Jonah can exercise his freedom of will. The poet does not limit himself to making these distinctions solely through the use of different sets of epithets for the deity; in Pearl he suggests the distinction through language fields (the Dreamer's vs. the Maiden's) and visual effects (the geographical position of the two in relation to the stream). The Dreamer uses an artificial, ornate vocabulary derived from love poetry and romance to allude to his "perle," his "rose," his "jewel." The Maiden uses a similar vocabulary to refer to her beloved, the two systems together suggesting a continuity between the worldly language of love and the divine (hence the appropriateness of the Clopingel [Jean de Meun] reference in Clean- ness, which suggests an analogy between the natural human desire for God and that of a lover for his lady [lines 1057-68]). However, whereas the Dreamer's vocabulary and reference systems are figura- tive, the Pearl-Maiden's turn out to be literal.19 Her naming of the "Lamb," which we initially read as figurative and prophetic, is literal- Christ is a Lamb. Similarly, her allusions to him as a "jewel" turn out to be literal insofar as his fleece is pearl and his horns gold. The disjunction in the language systems reveals a substantial difference- that is, a difference of substance-between the Dreamer's inadequate articulations of the deity and the celestial economy over against the Maiden's simple representation of the deity. At one point in the theological debate this disjunction comes to center on the word "wyrde." The Dreamer makes the assumption that 19.

Clopper o The God of the "Gawain"-Poet the Maiden has come to the marvelous land as a result of fate, where- upon the Maiden rejects the human impulse to equate God with simple foreordination. Trapped in the ornate language of romance, the Dreamer says, Pensyf, payred, I am forpayned, And pou in a lyf of lykyng lyste, In paradys erde, of stryf vnstrayned. What Wyrde hatz hyder myjuel vayned, And don me in pys del and gret daunger? (Lines 246-50) The Maiden rebukes him; she is not there because of fate: pou hatz called py Wyrde a pef, Fat o3t of no3t hatz made pe cler; Fou blamez pe bote of py meschef; Pou art no kynde jueler. (Lines 273-76) The Dreamer occupies a romance world in which things happen or seem to occur according to "chaunce"-and so his use of "Wyrde" ought not to be capitalized-but the Maiden knows that what ap- pears to be "chaunce" to earth dwellers is actually providence, so she can move easily to the equation of "Wyrde" with God the Fa- ther, who "o3t of no3t" has made all things, and with Christ, who is the "bote" of the Dreamer's misfortunes. The exchange reveals the Dreamer's very limited comprehension of how causes operate in the universe, and the Maiden's "translation" points to the absolute- ness of the Creator's power and the covenant he made with man- kind in sending Christ. The worlds of the Maiden and the Dreamer are utterly different, and the river between them marks the barrier between the two. Given the disjunction, the only knowledge the Dreamer can have of the deity is that which God chooses to signify within the created order; consequently, Pearl describes a kind of progression toward knowl- edge of the deity by means of a system of analogies: the garden and the marvelous land in which the Dreamer awakens, for example. However, the river, which bounds the Maiden's anagogic and apoca- lyptic language, signals a dislocation so vast that certain questions can neither be raised nor answered. The imagination can pursue God to a revelation that God is Other without finally comprehending the nature of his otherness. The geographical placement of the major figures-the Maiden and the Dreamer with the gulf of the river between-constitutes a 13</page><page sequence="14">MODERN PHILOLOGY visual representation of the Ockhamist position. That position, as evidenced by the reduction of the questions in book 1 of William's commentary on the Sentences, states that the only things one can know about God are those that God willingly reveals to man. In his potentia absoluta God is utterly other; consequently, the Dreamer can only discourse in terms that are laden with worldly significance. He speaks an artificial language of love and wishes to reduce the celestial economy to the limits of a worldly one; his words are embedded in the material and sensual. The Maiden counters with a theological dis- course that moves through a series of rational demonstrations until she asserts that "Resoun, of ry3t. . . con not raue" (line 665); at this point she dismisses human ratiocination in order to advance a lit- eralist catena of biblical prophecy and gospel history from the "Book of Truth." As she moves through this typological discourse toward the anagogic revelation of the Lamb, neither the Dreamer nor the reader understands these texts in quite the literalist manner that she presents them. This disjunction is a sign that the Dreamer can no more comprehend the otherness of the Lamb than he can cross the river that separates him from the Maiden. This topographical analogy to Ockham's position means that one can have some comprehension of the deity through the creation, one of the "books" in which he makes himself known. Indeed, the observation of the beauties of creation-the garden-encourages an attempt at establishing a con- tinuity-more of an inkling-between creation and the deity. But Ockham rejects, as David Hume did later, a logic that would lead from local particulars or individuals to knowledge of God's esse. The river stands between, and all one can know is what has been posited in creation or made known through God's biblical revelation, both of which should encourage hope and love in a properly oriented will. When one turns to Sir Gawain with the discourses on the divine from the earlier poems in mind, one is struck by the barrenness of man's relationship to the deity in this romance. Because the divine epithets are bare, without modification, they do not convey much of a characterization of God; rather, he is an abstract or distant, un- known figure. Epithets frequently appear in oaths merely as part of the social discourse; for example, of the only three instances in which "Lord" is used to refer to the deity, two are in oaths (lines 1055, 2185), and in the third Sir Gawain commends himself to the Lord (line 753). Similarly, over half of the instances of 'God' appear in oaths (ten of twenty-three instances) or commendations.20 None of 20. Oaths at lines 965, 1110, 1245, 1498, 1822, 2073, 2122, 2123, 2205, and 2250; commendations at lines 1535, 1776, and 2429. 14</page><page sequence="15">Lawrence M Clopper o The God of the "Gawain"-Poet the twenty-three occurrences of "God" is modified. In Sir Gawain, in contrast to Cleanness, the aristocratic vocabulary refers to the lords of Arthur's and Bercilak's courts. Indeed, they seem to have co-opted the language used for the deity elsewhere in the corpus. They are the ones who are "luflych," "leue," and "fre," and it is the lord of the castle who is called "lorde of the lede." This appropriation of divine epithets renders all the more equivocal the Lady's compliment to Gawain during the first bedroom scene: Bot hit ar ladyes inno3e pat leuer were nowpe Haf pe, hende, in hor holde, as I pe habbe here, To daly with derely your daynte wordez Keuer hem comfort and colen her carez, Pen much of pe garysoun oper golde pat pay hauen. Bot I louue pat ilk Lorde pat pe lyfte haldez I haf hit holly in my honde pat al desyres, Pur3e grace. (Lines 1251-58) Editors and scholars seem to concur that "Lorde" in line 1256 refers to God; thus they read the line, "Except [for the fact that] I love that same Lord who upholds the heavens, I, through grace, have wholly in my hand that [one whom] all desire."21 However, the manuscript, which does not capitalize "lorde," allows a displaced and misplaced reading of both the Lady's human relationship and the one she owes to God: "But Ilove that same lord that the left hand holds. / Ihave it wholly in my hand that everyone desires / Through grace." The Lady says there are many other ladies who would love to be in her position because she possesses the one who can comfort them and cool all their cares. The barely disguised eroticism comes to focus on the lord she has in her hands, and the appropriation of divine reference is clinched by the bob: she has received her lord in her hands through grace. Gawain has become the "transubstantiated" host of her "sacrament." Because of the spareness of the referential vocabulary, the Chris- tianity in Sir Gawain seems largely conventional and social. Bertilak, his Lady, and Morgan dutifully go to mass each morning. Everyone at 21. J. R. R. Tolkien and E. V. Gordon translate "lyfte" here as "heavens" in contra- distinction to the other occurrences of "lyfte," which they gloss as "left hand" (Tolkien and Gordon, eds., Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, 2d ed., rev. ed. Norman Davis [Ox- ford, 1966]). Andrew and Waldron capitalize "lorde," indicating that they read the half-line as "the Lord who possesses (or upholds) the heavens." Charles Moorman cross-references lines 2441-42, where the reading clearly is to the Lord ("wy3e") who "vpholdez pe heuen" (The Works of the "Gawain"-Poet [Jackson, Miss., 1977]). 15</page><page sequence="16">MODERN PHILOLOGY the court observes feast and fast days with appropriate ritual. Sir Gawain is a good Christian knight. He meditates on the five wounds of Christ and the five joys of Mary; he avoids sin and does good deeds. But this is the Christianity of his community, a belief safely nurtured in a privileged atmosphere, a belief so socially conceived that God is clothed in less resplendent epithets than Arthur, Gawain's lord. God is curiously absent from Sir Gawain; he is absconditus. But God can be "hidden" in several senses: the vocabulary we have just sur- veyed suggests that, to the participants in the drama, God is distant, perhaps largely absent. But he may also be in hiding in the sense that we saw in Cleanness: the more that God allows himself to be known through the ordinata, the less present he is in propria persona to the faithful. Assuming that God is in this game at all, he is a hidden protagonist. Is the Green Knight a mask for the deity, his agent, or a free operator? Spearing has noted that Sir Gawain differs from the first three poems in the manuscript insofar as they show confronta- tions between mortals and the deity or his agents. The Green Knight is certainly not a deity, although he may be supernatural. But can we say that he is not an instrument of God? Can we say, for instance, that he is a demon acting under the direction of the malignant Morgan le Fay? Or that he is God's instrument acting through the agency of demonic powers, much as the Yeoman in Chaucer's Friar's Tale confesses he does when he is allowed to persecute someone in order to bring him to salvation? The enigma is further complicated by the Green Knight's explication of the causes of the game. First he says that he sent his wife to tempt Gawain in his bedroom, thereby assert- ing responsibility for manipulating that whole adventure. But then he says that Morgan, the great goddess, changed his shape in order to "assay"-an equivocal word-the "surquidre" of Arthur's court and frighten Gwenevere to death. Who is running this elaborate game? Is the Green Knight operating on his own within some larger strategy? Or should the events be read as a series of causal relations-the Lady tempts Sir Gawain at the behest of Bertilak, who at the behest and through the power of Morgan becomes the Green Knight to test the honor of Arthur's court in the person of Sir Gawain? But from such a perspective the series of causes peters out into the dimness of ante- cedent causes and murky motivations. Is there a cause behind Mor- gan? Is the motivation malevolent at any point in the series, or is it good, or largely indifferent? Sir Gawain draws us into a most equivo- cal world, rather more like the world we live in, one more enigmatic and impenetrable than those of the Pearl-Maiden, the readers of Cleanness, and Jonah. 16</page><page sequence="17">Lawrence M. Clopper o The God of the "Gawain "-Poet Gawain, it seems clear, does not adequately understand the causes of his "aventure." Like the Dreamer in Pearl, he accepts the assump- tions of romance and believes himself to live in a world governed by "chaunce" or "wyrde." There is a feeling in the poem that from the moment Gawain accepts the Green Knight's challenge, events are unidirectional and fated. As Gawain puts it when he sets off: "Quat schuld I wonde? / Of Destines derf and dere / What may mon do bot fonde?" (lines 563-65). As he lies drowsily abed on the third morn- ing, we are told that he thinks about how "Destine schulde pat day dele hym his wyrde" (line 1752), and we wonder whether "Destine" is a disguised name for providence or a more narrow one for fate (although the editorial capitalization suggests the former). When the guide offers to remain silent should Gawain wish to leave by another way, Gawain insists he will go to the chapel, "for chaunce pat may falle," and talk with the Knight no matter whether it results in "wele oper wo, as pe Wyrde lykez / Hit hafe." Even though Gawain knows that the Green Knight is a "sturn knape," he also knows that "Dry3tyn" can well "schape / His seruantez for to saue" (lines 2132-39). There is a strong sense of fatalism in the passage: God is "Wyrde," events will happen according to "chaunce," "Drystyn" will "schape" the outcome. Thus, Gawain suggests that an event in the future-his beheading-is predetermined, or controlled by fate. However, the beheading is ac- tually a future contingent, since it will either occur or not occur, and, as we discover at the end of the three blows, it would have occurred if Gawain had not chosen to act properly in coming to the chapel. The reader sitting outside this arena can see that Sir Gawain con- structs an image of a free man in a providential world.22 The very existence in the poem of patterns, cycles within cycles, and repeti- tions suggests to the reader some larger order, some ordering prin- ciple, that is not apparent to Gawain, caught up as he is in a web of causes. The arrival of the Green Knight seems a matter of happen- stance, arbitrary and without cause. But as we observe the action, we see that Gawain's options, although narrowed by the Green Knight's intrusion and Gawain's own courtesy, are not at any point entirely dictated by external forces. The Gawain-poet portrays Arthur's court as a world both free and joyous in its freedom, constrained only by its nobility. Gawain does not have to accept the challenge of the Green Knight; he does so out of courtesy and love for his lord. Nor 22.

He chooses to seek out the Green Knight because he is Gawain the Good; he arms himself in those virtues that a knight requires. He does not have to resist the amorous advances of the lady; he does so with considerable skill, out of concern for his obligations to the lord and his own virtue, while avoiding any insult to the lady. Gawain could have taken the guide's advice and ridden away, but he chooses to go on to the Green Chapel, where, although he flinches once, he bides the final "bite" and is released from his obligation. More than any other romance hero that comes to mind, Gawain is beset by choices almost continuously; he chooses and chooses rightly, except in the one instance when, having learned the magical powers of the girdle, he takes it as "Hit were a juel for pe joparde pat hym iugged were" (line 1856). Gawain is a free man exercising his free will; his "punishment" at the Green Chapel is a precise measurement of the smallness of his fault. Sir Gawain and the Green Knight provides a powerful image of how man's free will is not annihilated by God's providence or his potentia absoluta. Had the poem been constructed so that the hero was merely the object of God's (or some godlike creature's) ridicule, we would have had a diabolically perverse Galahad legend in which the hero fails to find the grail. But the poet's saving grace is to make his ro- mance a comedy, thereby suggesting that Gawain is not a fated victim but one who despite being caught in the trammels of an enigma will be led providentially home if he freely chooses to follow the right path. The God of the Gawain-poet beckons and casts out. He draws to him the Dreamer of Pearl and the guests in the parable of Cleanness only to throw the Dreamer back into the garden and the soiled guest into the fire. He calls Jonah to condemn the Ninevites in order ulti- mately to offer forgiveness to them and exile to Jonah. He presents himself mysteriously through terrifying agents so that Gawain might learn the freedom of his will and the awesome consequences of that liberty. Throughout these poems the river flowing from the throne of God remains between-and the only face of God that man can know is that which, through his ordinata, God chooses to turn toward mankind, and that anthropomorphic one that man constructs in his own image in the face of God's potentia absoluta. 18</page></plain_text>
