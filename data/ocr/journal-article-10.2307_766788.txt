<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Polygonal Ring with Signs of the Zodiac JEFFREY C. ANDERSON The George Washington University production as engraved gems were no longer available through a flourishing trade. For the most part, the shape of such rings continued antique practice; the hoop might be a heavy wire fastened to the bezel or one that flared to a wide shoulder and bezel. But there emerged during the Late Antique and Early Christian periods the type of ring represented by the superb example with signs of the zodiac in the collection of Mrs. Douglas Bennet, Washington, D.C. (Fig. 1).4 This type is characterized by its polygonal hoop sometimes, although by no means always, fitted with a metal bezel, and by its impracticality for impressing a device.5 The Bennet ring itself consists of a gold hoop whose exterior is cut in twelve faces, each with one of the twelve signs of the zodiac. The hoop measures 6 mm. in height and 20 mm. in diameter. Although the faces are quite small, the engraver has often taken full advantage of the available space; the illustrations published here show the Twins, Cancer, the Lion, Virgo as a winged figure with halo (Fig. 1, above) and Libra as a figure with balance, the Scorpion, Sagittarius and Capricorn.6 The polygonal ring appears to have been quite popular over a long period of time and throughout a wide geographical area. The earliest dated example is from the third century, it is the gold and niello ring in the Museo Civico, Brescia, with a crowned figure in a quadriga, which is said to have been found with coins dating from around 225.7 A rare example with polygonal hoop and engraved gem, now in the National Museum at Stip (Yugoslavia), was found with a hoard of coins dating from 527 to 585.8 Two examples are dated in the seventh century: one, with a coin of Constans II forming the bezel, can be placed within the years 641-6;9 the other, which was discovered in Syracuse near the site of a bath associated with the death of Constans (641-68), can be placed only generally within the second and third quarters of the century.10 The latest example to which a date can be assigned is the ninth-century gold ring with cross monogram in niello at Dumbarton Oaks which is said to have been found with coins of the Emperor Michael II (820-9).1 1 The language of the inscriptions on such rings is both Greek and Latin, the examples in the former somewhat outnumbering those in the latter, and the findspots and places of purchase range through- out the Mediterranean region and Europe. Four examples are said to have come from Egypt,1 2 four from Smyrna,1 3 FIGURE 1. Gold polygonal ring with signs of the Zodiac. Collection of Mrs. Douglas Bennett, Washington, D. C. In antiquity, the shape of finger rings, whether set with an engraved gem or made entirely of metal with intaglio device on a flat bezel, was determined by their primary func- tion in setting seals on documents, letters, household con- tainers and even rooms. 1 The practical need for the seal ring was recognized even by the Christian Father Clement of Alexandria (c. 150- 206-11) in an often quoted passage regarding the subjects of such gems appropriate for Chris- tians.2 It seems, though, that by the fourth century the craft of gem carving was on the decline,3 and- while earlier, Greco-Roman stones may have continued in use during the Early Christian and Byzantine periods- by the sixth century all-metal rings had come to dominate the field of jewelry 39 GESTA XVIII/1 @ Ne International Center of Medieval Art 1979</page><page sequence="2">three from Tartus (Syria),1 4 two from Asia Minor in general1 5 and one from Trebizond specifically,l 6 and finally one each from Mt. Carmel,l7 Istanbull8 and Bargala (Yugoslavia).l9 The West is represented by one ring said to have been found in France,20 three from Italy-one each from Rome,21 Brescia22 and Syracuse23-and a rather large number, eleven in all, discovered in Germany.24 Although it is not dependent upon finds from modern, controlled excavations, the lnformation cited provides a picture of the dates and area of distribution perhaps also, in a general sense, of the widespread production-of such jewelry. A more precise date for the Bennet zodiac ring depends upon the style ln which the figures are executed. The subtle modulations of depth and use of fine incisions to denote de- tails show that the figures were never inlaid. This observation is signifWlcant for many of the polygonal rings, including the early example in Brescia, use a contrasting filler like niello, enamel or cut stones, which shifts the emphasis of the design from the figures' plastic values to their outlines. In technique and execution, the zodiac ring recalls, in addition to engraved gems, other metal rings, like a marriage ring at Dumbarton Oaks.25 The manner of execution in these two may be con- trasted with that of several other engraved metal nngs, such as a polygonal example in the British Museum26 with the enthroned Christ depicted on the bezel or two other marriage rings, a second at Dumbarton Oaks27 and one in the Canel- lopoulos Collection, Athens.2 8 In the case of the latter group, the figures are less worked in a modeling technique than they are engraved in a linear style. The curve of the lines renders the outline of the forms and the flow of the drapery. Inas- much as this technique creates essentially a two-dimensional pattern, it is related to that of the numerous examples in which filler materials are used.2 8 a The allusively rich-indeed protean-nature of the zodiac signs permits various interpretations of the ring's imagery; but the possibilities are narrowed when one con- siders particular characteristics of the polygonal rings as a group. For example, roughly one third of the polygonal rings bear inscriptions as their only decoration. The range of epigraphical formulae is rather restncted, particularly when examples made for specific occasions are excluded (viz., tokens of affection, marriage rings, ones bearing the owner's name and ones of an official nature). What remains are a hand- ful of formulae that are often found in other contexts. Four related formulae are: N. vivas;2 9 N. vivas in Cristo;30 zesais N.;31 and multis annis.32 All attest to the common hope for life or, as is made explicit in the last exam- ple, long life. The first two are also found in sepulchral in- scriptions expressing the hope that the deceased lives on.33 The possibility that the rings with such inscriptions may have been placed on the fingers of the dead seems unlikely since none of the rings is reported to have come from a burial, and the zesais formula occurs on other everyday objects like drinking vessels with the more common pie zesais or simply zesais,34 the shout which, according to Dio Cassius, was '4so familiar at drinking-bouts."3 5 Some of these vessels were used in memorial banquets, but others surely not. Re- lated to the hope for life is the wish for good health, hygieia N., which likewise occurs on the polygonal rings36 and on other objects of everyday life. Small pitchers are known from the pre-Christian era inscribed with the name "Hy- gieia,"37 the personification of health (who appears alone or with her father, Asclepius, on the engraved gems of several finger rings).3 8 The inscription on a Byzantine wedding medallion-"From God: harmony, grace, heaIth"39-dem- onstrates how Hygieia was returned to a less vital abstrac- tion under Christian auspices, although the inscription on a Byzantine amulet-"Protect me, O health"-suggests a lingering belief in the ancient being.4 Â° The words sphragis Solomon, "Seal of Solomon," on one of the rings41 are a certain example of a simple formula with prophylactic power. The complete formula, like "Seal of Solomon, protect the wearer from all evil," along with an image occurs on the so-called Gnostic amulets;42 the engraver of the ring has reduced the longer invocation to only the powerful key words. Similarly, the phos-zoe that occurs within a cruciform bezel on one of the polygonal rings43 may also have been prophylactic or apotropaic in nature.4 3 a A1- though perhaps trivial in comparison with the apotropaic in- scriptions, the words ep'agathoi, meaning roughly "good luck," are common on the polygonal rings and appear on memorial inscriptions as well.44 Two last inscriptions on the rings are the invocatory formulae Kyrie boethei N. and Theo- tokos boethei N. which call directly upon the Lord or the Virgin for help; these forms are extremely common in Byzantine inscriptions.4 5 Occasionally, the image of a polygonal ring is clearly prophylactic, as is the case of the silver ring with octagonal hoop and engraved bezel with Medusa's head in the Menil Foundation Collection, Houston.46 This design, very close to that of a ring in the British Museum, is found earlier on ancient gems and as late as the twelfth-century on a Slavic medallion with the image of the Virgin and Child on the reverse.4 7 The purpose of the Medusa head in warding off the evil glance is certain. In addition, the Christian use of tradi- tional formulae like vivas or hygieia raises the possibility of certain apotropaic images having undergone a similar trans- formation. On the Gnostic amulets, on which the "Seal of Solomon" inscription is found, a rider is a popular image;48 the pose of the horseman remains stable, although the types of fallen enemy beneath the horse's hooves varies. The mor- phological and thematic relationships between this image and that of Christ's entry into Jerusalem may explain why the latter appears on a number of finger rings.49 That rings could be simple charms or apotropaia is hardly a late superstition, such powers are occasionally attributed to Greco-Roman rings with engraved gems.50 What is significant, however, is that this function of the ring is no longer secondary to that of 40</page><page sequence="3">sealing device- few of the rings cited could have been used to make a legible or lasting impression, let alone a pleasing one. In fact, the Elgures are often filled and the inscriptions engraved so as to be read directly off the face of the ring. Within this context, the polygonal hoop, which became popular at the time of the rise of inscriptions and the decline of the sealing function, must be questioned for significance. Some power must have been thought to have attended the shape of these often octagonal rings; although the Bennet ring, for obvious reasons, is dodecagonal, a few words might be said about the eight-sided examples. A sixth-century physician, Alexander of Tralles, prescribed the making of a ring for the cure of cholic to proceed as follows: "Take an iron ring and cut the hoop into eight faces and inscribe them, 'Flee, flee . . .' ''S l In his discussion of the symbolism of the form of the baptistry, Underwood cites a passage in Augustine's City of God in which the Father considers world history in terms of seven days with the eighth day being an "etemal day, consecrated by the resurrection of Christ, and prefiguring the etemal repose not only of the spirit, but also of the body.''S2 The hopes for health, protection, life and eternal life presented by the images, inscriptions and shapes of the polygonal rings provide an historically limited field for the inquiry into the zodiac ring's significance for its wearer; several patterns in the representation of the zodiac, however, remain to be examined briefly. If one takes as the logical point of departure the use of the symbols on Roman engraved gems, and if one insists that the parallels contain the entire cycle of twelve, not just single symbols or incomplete groups, certain observations are pos- sible. The signs appear-as in the case, for example, of the amethyst in the British Museum illustrated by G. Richters3 _ within the twelve compartments of a two-dimensionally repre- sented band running around the edge of the stone. Always, the band acts as a frame for some central image; often, this is a Slgure of Helios. On some examples, the band frames the busts of other gods who on occasion subsume aspects of the sun god's nature: Jupiter, Serapis or Apollo,s4 to name three. In these cases, the zodiac perhaps also functions as a meta- phorical attribute, by standing for the heavens, it implies the cosmos; for this reason, the purpose of the zodiac on the British Museum amethyst is similar compositionally and iconographically to that surrounding Jupiter on a stone relief in the Villa Albani, Rome.s S Therefore, while a tradition of zodiacal ring decoration can be said to have existed in imperial Rome, and on personal objects where the image of a tutelary deity may have served as an apotropaion, the zodiac itself is only of secondary importance as an attribute. It is not surprising that the signs come to figure in im- perial iconography. By the second century, the zodiac appears on coins of Faustina the Elder,s 6 and the importance of the cult of the sun, interpenetrated by that of the emperor, especially in the third century,5 7 contributes to the popularity of the zodiac in its roles as attribute of the ruler of the cosmos and in imperial apotheosis.58 What this survey has not yet produced, however, is a private commission that uses the signs in a manner consonant with the significance of the rings; the emperors, though, certainly paved the way for such uses There survive several Late Antique sarcophagi, like those in the Campo Santo, Pisa, and Dumbarton Oaks,59 that show the combination of two, familiar compositions: the imago clipeus born by mythological figures or personifica- tions and the enframing band. In this context the primary significance is topographical, as denoting the abode of the souls This belief was widespread in the East; it was also known in the West, as is indicated by Cicero's Dream of Scipio, which is known to have been of continuing importance in some circles for it is commented upon by the late fourth-, early fifth-century author Macrobius.60 Since the clipeate portrait often appears on sarcophagi born by victories, nereids or tritons to signify the journey of the soul to its place of rest, the topographical implications in this context are as- sured. In the examples in the Campo Santo and at Dumbarton Oaks the clipeus is supported by Seasons, but a similar mean- ing seems implied. A secondary significance may well represent the most common understanding of the zodiacal band. It may denote a state of perpetual existence after death. The list of works in this vein can be lengthened; consider, for example, the funerary relief at Igel with the apotheosis of Heracles.6l For the temporal significance of the zodiac, a more demon- strative source is a non-funerary one, the fourth-century silver plate from Parabiago now in the Castello Sforzesco, Milan.6 2 Framed by the zodiacal band, toward the right side of the composition, is the figure of Aion, he who holds "the key of generation,"63 the personification of eternity. A link can be drawn with the import of inscriptions like vivas or zesais on the rings, for the zodiacal signs embody a concept of life and time that may easily be used in a sepulchral context. In addition, the images of the signs, like some of the inscriptions mentioned, have a positive or active function. Throughout antiquity, the zodiac was thought to have exer- cised in its own right influence over various natural phenom- ena, including control over man's fate in general, and over various parts of the body in particular.64 The zodiacal band, therefore, is not only, as in the attribute of Aion, a symbol of eternal time, but also represents those powers that in- fluence health and events, man's time. The representation of the band on the Parabiago plate is obviously different in form from those examples on the sarcophagi or Roman rings cited. It is shown illusionistically, as an object which may be touched or grasped, as Aion gently does. The con- cept informing so palpable a representation of the zodiac also finds expression in literature. The fifth-century poet Nonnos speaks of " . . . circling Time (Aion), rolling the four- season year . . . o65 as if it were a wheel like the one repre- sented in the Byzantine Octateuchs where the Seasons and illusionistic band are united as if in representation of these very words.66 So immediate a sense of the abstract must be understood as requisite for the manufacture of an object 41</page><page sequence="4">like the zodiac ring. It also underscores the separate nature of the symbols that allowed the imagery potency. It is, no doubt, this common belief in the power of the zodiac that lies at the root of the objections to its use raised by the Christian Fathers. Augustine, for example objects not only to superstitious belief in the pagan gods in general, but specifWlcally to the "sacriligious" and "heretical" belief in the power of the zodiac.67 This antagonism culminates the ban of the signs recorded in the tenth canon of the Council of Braga in 563.68 The testimony of the polygonal shape ofthe ring, the inscriptions on similar rings, the use of the zodiac NC 1.

Its form and imagery gave assurance, whether vague or precise, of health and long life. This vital link with pagan symbology was soon to be interrupted. In the seventh century, rings with feast scenes from the life of Christ themselves polygonal in shape and decorated with seasonal motifs suggestive of the eternal rolling of time, in- herit the role so elegantly fsllled by the zodiac ring.

While the words "light" and "life" enjoy a connection with one of Christ's utterances (8.12: I am the light of the world; he who follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life), they achieve a particularly emblematic quality when in- scribed, sharing a common omega, within the arms of that potent symbol of victory, the cross. 44.

The significance of these two broadly defined styles becomes apparent when they are compared with the styles of works of another small-scale medium, book painting. A number of illum- inated manuscripts of the fifth and sixth centuries show, in addi- tion to linear detailing, the use of areas of shadow to model form; this is true of miniatures in the fifth-century Vatican Virgil and ones in the sixth-century Vienna Genesis (J. De Witt, Die Miniaturen des Vergilius Vaticvnus, Amsterdam, 195 9 and H. Gerstinger, Die Wiener Genesis, Vienna, 1931). In both of these manuscripts, wide, soft shadows are painted around the edges of both drapery and the figures' limbs to create the illusion of light striking a curved surface. The second half of the sixth century, though, sees the emergence of a more energetic, linear style of painting. Although some traces of this style may appear in the Vienna Genesis and the two related New Testament manuscripts, the Sinope Gospels and the Rossano Gospels, it is best seen in the so-called Syriac Bible of Paris, dated to the second half of the sixth century on the basis of its close relationship with the Rabula Gospels of 586 (A. Grabar, Les peintures de l'evangelivire de Sinope, Paris, 1948; A. Munoz, n codice purpureo di Rossano, Rome, 1907; H. Omont, "Peintures de l'Ancien Testament dans un manuscrit syriaque du VIIe siecle," Fondation Eugene Piot; Monumen ts et Memoires 16 ( 1909): 85-98, pls. v-ix; C. Cecchelli, G. Furlani, M. Salmi, The Rabbulv Gospels, Olten and Lausanne, 1959). In the scene of Moses before Pharoah, fol. 8 of the Syriac Bible, one notes the sweeping lines that envelop the figures on the diagonal, endowing them with a particularly energetic presence (Omont, "Peintures," pl. V, 1). This linear style which first ap- pears in Syriac painting has its counterpart in metalwork. The treatment of the figures of Moses on the bronze cross at St. Catherine's on Mt. Sanai, which K. Weitzmann and I. Sevcenko date to the sixth century, arises out of an awareness of this style; it is not without significance that the cross has been attributed to a Syriac or Palestinian craftsman ("The Moses Cross at Sinai," Dumbarton Oaks Papers, XVII, 1963, 385-98, on possible origin: 393). Its engraver simplified the style to just a few lines of great facility to indicate the movement of drapery, the outline of form. In objects of small scale, like the finger rings with images only a few millimeters high, or ones with little value as objets d'art, like the lead pilgrims' flasks, the figures appear as a mass of parallel or concentric lines (A. Grabar, Les vmpoules de Terre Svinte, Paris, 1958). Occasionally, as in the case of the magnificent "Strzygowski medallion" at Dumbarton Oaks, effects that are quite arresting may be achieved with this manner in metalwork; this medallion, on the basis of its possibly commemorating the baptism of Theodosius, has been dated to around 5 84 (Ross, D.O. Cat.: 2, item 36). The fact that the zodiac ring so clearly does not belong to this stylistic trend suggests that it was pro- duced sometime before the second half of the sixth century. A reasonable conjecture, I believe, would be that the zodiac ring dates somewhere in the fourth or fifth, perhaps early sixth, century. 29. Dalton, B.M.
