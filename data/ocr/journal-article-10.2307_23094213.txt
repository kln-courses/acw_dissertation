<plain_text><page sequence="1">190 Book Reviews The Eternal Present: A Contribution on Constancy and Change by S. Giedion. New York: Pantheon Books (Bollingen Series), 1962. Pp. xxi + 588; 520 plates. |12.50. This handsome book is an " eye-opener " in the field of prehistoric art. Is it merely an accident, that the eye-symbol, like a small hieroglyphic, refers to the excellent reproductions on the margin of the text? Anyway it is an original and practical way to connect the word with the image. The illustrations are taken, respectively designed by the most competent experts, and given a fresh and more reliable " in-sight" into material still very difficult of access. The excellent photographs are the work of two Swiss: Hugo P. Herdeg and, after his death, of Achille Weiler. The schematic drawings were executed by Barbara Boehrs of the Zurich School of Design after the method of Karl Schmidt. Instead of the continuous lines, which destroy the relief or intaglio character of the " cave-pictures," they come nearer the character of the originals by using a series of fine dots. As an example of the skillful handling of the camera one might refer to the color photo of the " Venus of Laussel" (pi. XX), taken in a revealing side view, which for the first time does justice to its imposing character (despite a relatively small size) leading " optically " to its governing magic fertility function. The typography and design of the book are the work of the internationally renowned Herbert Bayer of Aspen, who had cooperated with the author before. But excellence and novelty in the presentation of the visual material provide only the necessary conditions for the success in writing this book, which probably is the first one which truly deals with prehistoric finds, petroglyphs, " cave paintings " and sculpture as art exclusively by attempting to penetrate into their meaning. " The species or race of the artists, the material they used, their tools and technology . . . the time span in which they worked "—all those facts and considerations which a recent reviewer (G. S. Ackermann of Harvard University in the New York Review, February 21, 1963) missed in Giedion's book, are therefore hardly considered, since questions of anthropology, ethnology tech nology and chronology remain on purpose outside the aim of the writer who concentrates on problems of aesthetics and symbolism. But one might argue, as the writer of the criticism just quoted in parts does, that without going into these questions the whole remains too much in the nebulous realm of speculation and "German pomposities" (Ackermann). )• lrst ot all there is nothing wrong with speculation in the field of prehistoric archaeology though prehistoric man certainly cannot talk back. Attempts to make " dead stone speak " by drawing parallels to neolithic and ethonological (modern primitive) even to 20th century art are legitimate since the ca. 25,000 years which separate the late palaeolithic period from us are an insignificant span of time considering that man has been an intelligent tool-maker for about half a million years. So called " magic thinking" applied for instance to Cromagnon man, respectively to their " sorcerers," who in all probability were also the chief artists, is not " pre-logical" like that of small children and of the seriously insane. Cause and effect relationship was certainly known to palaeolithic man as to modern primitives or they could not have been successful hunters. But this relationship was in ritual-magic practice and connected image making intentionally held in abeyance as it is done by us today in superstitious situations. Thus, one can very well believe in a constancy of the human mind throughout the last</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 191 25,000 years. If one grants that, the parallels drawn by Giedion of prehistoric to modern avant garde art and vice versa are not only legitimate but most revealing. The author had certainly this reciprocity in mind when he gave to his book the title: The Eternal Present. His intentions are further indicated by one of the mottos prefacing the book (p. vii) taken from Ezra Pound's The Spirit of Romance: " All ages are contemporaneous." It is true, the title " internal Jfresent" means specifically that there is no sense of time or sequence in " cave art." It is the result of the investigations carried on in the last chapter of the book (Part VI): " The Space Conception of Pre history but the very same title transgresses these specific findings, and means that we are the living past, especially when we create as artists. in ms lecture "" Constancy, Change and Architecture " (First Gropius Lecture, 1961, Harvard University, a summary of the whole two volume work, published as pamphlet by Harvard University Press), Giedion points out that his convic tion that art, however early, cannot exist without a conception of space breaks " rather radically with the prevailing opinion that in prehistory the single form is simply set off against chaos." Against the dominating belief that prehistoric artist had no conception of space, he puts his opinion that he had " no sense of time or sequence," that there is " no frame or axis and no up or down." mis reviewer sees in a limitation ot the book—according to Professor Acker mann—namely that the author stays away from any established chronology and sequence of evolution (from awkward to sophisticated), one of its greatest virtues, because such sequences, still smacking of the application of 19th century biology and the progress from lower to higher, have become utterly dubious when applied to prehistoric art. Another most important finding of Giedion is the fact that the art of pre historic man and its interpretation establishes the " animal's superiority over man." " That man's change from a zoomorphic attitude towards the world (in the late Palaeolithicum) to an anthropomorphic attitude constitutes the most profound revolution in his destiny," as Giedion puts it in the Gropius lecture, has not been stated before with so much clarity and courage. Though in many respects novel and daring, the book is based not only on autopsy on the spot (that is in the caves, museums and private collections) but also on the mastery of the vast international literature on the subject in half a dozen languages. It is impossible to mention within the frame of a review the specific conclusions drawn from such rich material, which is growing richer every year and upsetting previous findings, datings, interpretations. Only a brief summation of what the author attempted might be given by using Giedion's organization in the titles of chapters and their subdivisions. Part I deals generally with the symbol as the centre of " Art as a Fundamental Experience." Part II proceeds to the " Means of Expression in Primeval Art" and is subdivided in, a) Abstraction, b) Transparency, c) Simultaneity, d) Move ment—discussing phenomena which it shares with modern art. These two parts establish principles which are exemplified in Parts III to VI. Part III is probably the most original contribution of the author, the " heart of the matter." Called " Symbolization," it is organized into, 1) Hands, 2) Circular Forms, 3) Fertility, 4) Great Symbols. Part IV established the superiority of " The Sacred Animal." Part V explains</page><page sequence="3">192 Book Reviews the " Human Figure " in its magic—ritualistic aspect. Part VI concludes the book with the " Space Conception," as mentioned before. That Giedion s manner of writing, his insight into the problems of prehistoric art, are more rewarding than in most specialistic writing on the subject, is the result of the union of careful scholarship with art enthusiasm. The friend of many of the leading artists of our time such as Leger, Max Ernst, Giacometti, and a collector of their works, the husband of one of the finest writers on modern art, Carola Giedion-Welcker, he sees prehistoric art with the eyes of a partisan of the contemporary scene of long and respected standing. He can therefore interpret such phenomena as abstraction, transparency, simultaneity, which con temporary art has so significantly revealed to us, also in the art of prehistoric man. This ability to see the art of the past with eyes of the present and on the other hand the art of the present through the long-distance glasses of historical experi ence, gives " eternal" meaning to the art of both past and present. This manner of " combined seeing" had earlier made Giedion's first book published in this country, Space, Time and Architecture (Harvard University Press, 1941), such a sensational success. As stated in the preface of the book here under review, it is merely the first volume of a greater work consisting of two volumes (interrelated but indepen dent) which has its unifying idea in the dual aspect of constancy and change. A careful summary of the two volumes was given by Giedion in the before mentioned First Gropius Lecture. From it we learn that the author will return to his legitimate home base, architecture, in the second volume, something which might make the specialists in this country feel more comfortable and well disposed towards the man, who approaching his seventies " astonished " his col leagues by " entering and commanding an entirely new field " (Ackermann). i nis reviewer thinks ot this descent into the caves as necessary and quite logical for the vigorous Swiss scholar who since 1938 has regularly taught and lectured in the U. S. A., exerting a great influence. ms aeep understanding ot " Meaning," without which mere facts are dead, his preoccupation with symbolism are the necessary prerequisites which enable him to deal in the second volume of the work with the over-ground symbolism of Old Oriental architecture and sculpture (chiefly Egypt and Mesopotamia), where symbolism of space and form is the key to understanding, growing like the seedling from the womb of darkness. i nis reviewer looks rorward to the completion of the monumental work with keenest anticipation.
