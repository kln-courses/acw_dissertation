<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE NATURE OF NATURAL HISTORY. By Marston Bates. Charles Scribner's Sons, N.Y., 1950: viii + 309. $3.50.-Marston Bates has turned from his eight years of directorship of the jungle yellow fever laboratory in southern Colombia, at the Amazonian base of the main range of the Andes, to a wholly new field, the emerging science of human ecology. The nature of natural history is a kind of rapid review of the knowledge and :insights gained in Dr. Bates' more strictly scientific career, presumably in the belief and hope that the biological approach to human problems may fruitfully link the social sciences to the supposedly "more scientific" natural sciences. The publishers designate the book as "A study in the approach of science to the living world of which we form a part." This is ecology, a term mainly rejected in the book in favor of "natural history." Ecology is in fact a fairly old term for one of the major sub-sciences of biology including all of the older observational natural history. The new term seems to be more essential than Dr. Bates allows, for it connotes a turning away from the anthropomorphic and often emotional observations, accumulated since Aristotle under the heading of natural history, to a more critical and objective point of view of essentially the same material. The review of the sciences on which Dr. Bates' natural history (and our ecology) is based runs rapidly and competently through fourteen chapters, covering the topics of nomenclature and classification; paleontology; reproduction, sex, heredity, and embryology; the environment in which organisms live; partnership, cooperation, and parasitism; be- havior of individuals and of populations; biogeography; and adaptation and evolution. The purpose of this summary then emerges in the final chapters, which examine the rela- tions of natural history to the human economy, the nature of its practitioners, and "Tactics, Strategy, and Goal." It is evident that science does need to "take stock," to consolidate its gains and to synthesize its divergent special fields. Only then can one take a longer view and take thought about the old problems and the new ones that appear with the synthesis. Dr. Bates wishes, in fact, to break down the artificial barriers between science and philosophy. He does not make the point, as I should, that the pursuit of pure science is an expression of higher ("emergent") qualities of the human spirit, and that such pursuit requires no more "economic" justification than does the composition or the interpretation of music, and is as little amenable to explanation. He distinguishes somewhat more sharply than I should, and indeed than I have,1 between the naturalist and the nature-lover. It is especially grati- fying to find in his account of the method of science adequate appreciation of observation as well as of experimentation and critique. The only discernible human goal is seen in survival, the survival of the individual and of our species, and presumably of the family and of more complex groups within the human species. This leads him to stress conservation. Finally, he hopes that scientific thought in general and ecological thought in particular may have a valid goal in the search for insights and understanding; this coincides with what I mean by pure science as an end and as a value-in-itself. An excellent annotated reading list forms an appendix, by way of documentation, and as a happy alternative to footnotes or detailed references scattered through the text.- KARL P.
