<plain_text><page sequence="1">OPTIMALISM AND AXIOLOGICAL METAPHYSICS NICHOLAS RESCHER I W HAT IS PERHAPS THE BIGGEST METAPHYSICAL QUESTION of them all was put on the agenda of philosophy by G. W. Leibniz: "Why is there anything at all?" This question is not only difficult to answer but poses difficulties in its very conception. After all, it is?or should be?clear that such questions as "Why is there anything at all?" and "Why are things in general as they actually are?" and "Why are the laws of na ture as they are?" cannot be answered within the standard causal framework. For causal explanations need inputs: they are essentially transformational rather than formational pure and simple. And so, if we persist in posing the sorts of global questions at issue, we cannot hope to resolve them in orthodox causal terms. For when we ask about everything there are no issue-external materials at our disposal for giving a noncircular explanation. Does this mean that such ques tions are improper and should not be raised at all?that even to in quire into the existence of the entire universe is somehow illegiti mate? Not necessarily. For it could be replied that the question does have a perfectly good answer, but one that is not given in the orthodox causal terms that apply to other issues of smaller scale. A more radical strategy is thus called for if rejectionism is to be avoided. And such a strategy exists. But before turning in this direction, let us consider more closely of a rejectionism which holds that it is just a mistake to ask for a causal explanation of existence per se; the question should be aban doned as improper?as not representing a legitimate issue. The lines of thought at issue here hold that in the light of closer scrutiny the ex planatory problem vanishes as meaningless.

Copyright ? 2000 by The Review of Metaphysics</page><page sequence="2">808 NICHOLAS RESCHER Such a dismissal of the problem as illegitimate is generally based on the idea that the question at issue involves an illicit presupposition because it looks for answers of the form "Z is the (or an) explanation for the existence of things." Committed to this response schema, the question presupposes the thesis "There actually is a ground for the ex istence of things?existence in general is the sort of thing that has an explanation." This presumption, we are told, is false on grounds of deep general principle inherent in the logical nature of the case. Consider the following suggestion along these Unes made by C. G. Hempel: Why is there anything at all, rather than nothing? .. . But what kind of an answer could be appropriate? What seems to be wanted is an ex planatory account which does not assume the existence of something or other. But such an account, I would submit, is a logical impossibility. For generally, the question "Why is it the case that AT is answered by "Because B is the case."... [A]n answer to our riddle which made no as sumptions about the existence of anything cannot possibly provide ade quate grounds. . . . The riddle has been constructed in a manner that makes an answer logically impossible.1 However, this seemingly plausible Une of argumentation has shortcomings. The most serious of these is that it fails to distinguish appropriately between the existence of things on the one hand and the obtaining of facts on the other,2 and supplementarily also between specifically substantival facts regarding existing things, and nonsub stantival facts regarding states of affairs that are bound to particular things. (Unlike saying the that sun is hot, saying that the day is hot does not ascribe that heat to an object of some sort.) We are confronted here with a principle of hypostatization to the effect that the reason for anything must ultimately always inhere in the properties of things. At this point we come to a prejudice as deep rooted as any in Western philosophy: the idea that things can only originate from things, that nothing can come from nothing (ex nihilo nihilfit) in the sense that no thing can emerge from an amorphously thingless condition.3 Now, this somewhat ambitious principle is per fectly unproblematic when construed as saying that if the existence of 1 Carl G. Hempel, "Science Unlimited," The Annals of the Japan Associ ation for Philosophy of Science 14 (1973): 200. 2 Note too that the question of the existence of facts is a horse of a very different color from that of the existence of things. There being no things is undoubtedly a possible situation, there being no facts is not (since if the situ ation were realized, this would itself constitute a fact).</page><page sequence="3">OPTIMALISM AND AXIOLOGICAL METAPHYSICS 809 something real has a correct explanation at all, then this explanation must pivot on something that is really and truly so. Clearly, we cannot explain one fact without invoking other facts to do the explaining. But the principle becomes highly problematic when construed in the man ner of the precept that things must come from things, that substances must inevitably be invoked to explain the existence of substances. For we then become committed to the thesis that everything in nature has an efficient cause in some other natural thing that is its causal source, its reason for being. This stance is implicit in Hempel's argument. And it is expUcit in much of the philosophical tradition. Hume, for one, insists that there is no feasible way in which an existential conclusion can be obtained from nonexistential premises.4 The principle is also supported by phi losophers of a very different ilk on the other side of the channel?in cluding Leibniz himself, who writes: The sufficient reason [of contingent existence] . . . must be outside this series of contingent things, and must reside in a substance which is the cause of this series.5 Such a view amounts to a thesis of genetic homogeneity which says (on analogy with the old but now rather obsolete principle that Ufe must come from Ufe) that things must come from things, or stuff must come from stuff, or substance must come from substance. What, after all, could be more plausible than the precept that only real (existing) causes can have real (existing) effects? But despite its historic stature, this principle has its problems. It presupposes that there must be a type-homogeneity between cause and effect on the Unes of the ancient Greek principle that Uke must 3 Aristotle taught that every change must emanate from a mover, that is, a substance whose machinations provide the cause of change. This commit ment to causal reification is at work in much of the history of Western thought. That its pervasiveness is manifest at virtually every juncture is clear from William Lane Craig's interesting study of The Cosmological Argument from Plato to Leibniz (London: Macmillan, 1980). 4 David Hume, Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion, ed. N. K. Smith (London: Longmans, Green, 1922), 189. 5 G. W. Leibniz, "Principles of Nature and of Grace," section 8. Compare St. Thomas: "Of necessity, herefore, anything in process of change is being changed by something else"; Summa Theologiae I, q. 2, a. 3. The idea that only substances can produce changes goes back to Thomas's master, Aristo tle. In Plato and the Presocratics, the causal efficacy of principles is recog nized (for example, the love and strife of Empedocles).</page><page sequence="4">810 NICHOLAS RESCHER come from like. This highly dubious principle of genetic homogeneity has taken hard knocks in the course of modern science. Matter can come from energy, and Uving organisms from complexes of inorganic molecules. If the principle fails with matter and life, need it hold for substance as such? The claim that it does so would need a very co gent defense, and none has been forthcoming to date. Is it indeed true that only things can engender things? Why need a ground of change always inhere in a thing rather than in a nonsub stantival condition of things in general? Must substance inevitably arise from substance? Even to state such a principle is in effect to chaUenge its credentials. What is to say that substance cannot emerge from pure process? Why must the explanation of facts rest in the operation of things? To be sure, fact-explanations must have in puts (all explanations must). Facts must root in facts. But why thing existential ones? A highly problematic bit of metaphysics is involved here. Dogmas about explanatory homogeneity aside, there is no dis cernible reason why an existential fact cannot be grounded in nonex istential ones, and why the existence of substantial things cannot be explained on the basis of some nonsubstantival circumstance or prin ciple whose operations can constrain existence in something of the way in which equations can constrain nonzero solutions. Once we give up the principle of genetic homogeneity and abandon the idea that existing things must originate in existing things, we remove the key prop of the idea that asking for an explanation of things in general is a logically inappropriate demand. The footing of the rejectionist ap proach is gravely undermined. There are also further routes to rejectionism. One of them turns on the doctrine of Kant's antinomy that it is iUegitimate to try to ac count for the phenomenal universe as a whole (the entire Erschei nungswelt). Explanation on this view is inherently partitive: phenom ena can only be accounted for in terms of other particular phenomena, so that it is in principle improper to ask for an account of phenomena as a whole. The very idea of an explanatory science of nature as a whole is iUegitimate. Yet this view is deeply problematic. To aU intents and purposes, science strives to explain the age of the universe as a whole, its structure, its volume, its laws, its composi tion, and so forth. Why not then its existence as weU. The decree that explanatory discussion is by nature necessarily partial and incapable of dealing with the whole lacks plausib?ity. It seems a mere device for sidestepping embarrassingly difficult questions.</page><page sequence="5">OPTIMALISM AND AXIOLOGICAL METAPHYSICS 811 In the end, it must be acknowledged that rejectionism is not a par ticularly appealing doctrine. For its alternatives have the significant merit of retaining for rational inquiry and investigation a question that would otherwise be abandoned. After all, the question of the reason why behind existence is surely important. If there is any possibi?ty of getting an adequate answer?by hook or by crook?it seems reason able that we would very much like to have it. There is nothing pa tently meaningless or clearly improper about this riddle of existence. And it does not seem to rest in any obvious way on any particularly problematic presupposition?apart from the epistemicaUy optimistic yet methodologicaUy inevitable idea that there are always reasons why things are as they are (the principle of sufficient reason). To dis miss the question as improper or ?legitimate is fruitless; try as we wiU to put it away, it comes back to haunt us.6 II Optimalism and Evaluative Metaphysics. From its ear?est days, metaphysics was also taken to include axiology, the evaluative and normative assessment of the things that exist. Already with Aris totle the aim of the enterprise was not just to describe or characterize, but to grade (appraise, rank) matters in point of their inherent value. Such metaphysical evaluation has two cardinal features: (1) it is genu ine evaluation that involves some authentic concept of greater or lesser value and (2) the mode of value involved is sui generis and thus not ethical, aesthetic, utiUtarian, and so forth. Accordingly, it evalu ates types of things or conditions of things existing in nature (not acts or artifacts) with a view to their intrinsic merit (not simply their value for man or anything else). The very possibUity of this axiological en terprise accordingly rests on the acceptance of distinctly metaphysical values?as opposed to ethical (right/wrong) or aesthetic (beautiful/ ugly) or practical (useful/unuseful) ones. The paternity of evaluative metaphysics in phUosophical practice can unhesitatingly be laid at Plato's door, but as a conscious and 6 For criticisms of ways of avoiding the question "Why is there some thing rather than nothing?" see chapter 3 of WiUiam Rowe, The Cosmological Argument (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1975).

Y.: Anchor Books, 1967), especially Paul Edwards's "The Cosmological Argument."</page><page sequence="6">812 NICHOLAS RESCHER deUberate philosophical method it can be ascribed to Aristotle. In the Physics and the De Anima we find him at work not merely at classify ing the kinds of things there are in the world, but in ranking and grad ing them in terms of relative evaluations. Above aU, his preoccupa tion in the Metaphysics with the ranking schematism of prior/ posterior?for which see especiaUy chapter 11 of book 5, and chapter 8 of book 9?is indicative of Aristotle's far-reaching concern with the evaluative dimension of metaphysical inquiry. It was thus a sound in sight into the thought framework of the great Stagirite that led the anti-AristoteUan writers of the Renaissance, and later preeminently Descartes and Spinoza, to attack the Platonic/Aristotelian conception of the embodiment of value in nature and the modern logical positivist opponents of metaphysics to attach the stigma of Ulegitimacy to aU evaluative disciplines. Nevertheless, despite such attacks, evaluative metaphysics has continued as an ongoing part of the Western philo sophical tradition as continued by such thinkers as Leibniz, Kant, He gel, and Whitehead, all of whom envision wiU systems where some things have greater value than others. A prime example of this methodological approach in recent phi losophy is G. E. Moore's Principia Ethica.7 For Moore taught that the realm of ethical values is not self-contained but rather roots in a manifold of metaphysical values. His celebrated method of absolute isolation invites us to make comparative evaluations of two hypothet ical worlds supposed to be alike in aU relevant respects except that in one of them some factor is exhibited which is lacking in the other. Thus Moore argues for the intrinsic value of natural beauty (that is, its value even apart from human contemplation) by the argument: [A hypothetical] beautiful world would be better stiU, if there were hu man beings in it to contemplate and enjoy its beauty. But that admission makes nothing against my point. If it be once admitted that the beautiful world in itself is better than the ugly, then it follows, that however many beings may enjoy it, and however much better their enjoyment may be than it is itself, yet its mere existence adds something to the goodness of the whole: it is not only a means to our end, but also itself a part thereof.8 To espouse the project of evaluative metaphysics is thus to give Moore the right as against Henry Sidgwick's thesis that "If we con 7 G. E. Moore, Principia Ethica (Cambridge: University of Cambridge Press, 1903). See in particular sections 50, 55, 57, and 112-13. 8 Ibid., section 50.</page><page sequence="7">OPTIMALISM AND AXIOLOGICAL METAPHYSICS 813 sider carefully such permanent results as are commonly judged to be good, other than quaUties of human beings, we find nothing that, on reflection, appears to possess this quality of goodness out of relation to human existence, or at least to some [presumably animal] con sciousness or feeling."9 (There is of course the trivial fact that if we do the considering, we do the evaluating. The point to be borne in mind is that this need not be done from a humanly parochial, let alone an idio syncraticaUy personal, and subjective standpoint.) Sidgwick to the contrary notwithstanding, man is neither the measure nor necessarily even the measurer of all things in the evaluative domain. Moore was weU aware of the sa?ent difference which, despite some kinship, obtains between standard ethics on the one hand and evaluative metaphysics on the other, recognizing the sui generis char acter of the latter enterprise: By combining the results of Ethics as to what would be good or bad, with the conclusions of metaphysics, as to what kinds of things there are in the Universe, we get a means of answering the question whether the Universe is, on the whole, good or bad, and how good or bad, com pared with what it might be: a sort of question which has in fact been much discussed by many philosophers.10 Such an axiological position does not (as with Sidgwick) see meta physical evaluation as rooted in ethics but insists on the very reverse relationship. For if "Maximize value!" is indeed a metaphysically grounded maxim of impersonal rationaUty and ethical conduct is, by its very nature, of greater value than its contraries, then ethics wiU ul timately be predicated upon evaluative metaphysics. In the present discussion, however, it wiU not be ethics that con cerns us but ontology, and the present deliberations wiU focus on ex ploring the role of value in the explanation of existence. The govern ing idea is to consider the prospect of giving a Leibnizian answer to that Leibnizian question, contemplating the prospect that things ex ist?and exist as they do?because that is for the best. Can such an optimaUsm be developed in a way that is at aU plausible? 9 Henry Sidgwick, Methods of Ethics (London: Macmillan, 1874), bk. 1, chapter 9, section 4. 10 G. E.

Accustomed as we are to explanations in the mode of efficient causa?ty, the idea of an axiological explanation of existence on the basis of an evalua tive optimalism has a somewhat strange and unfamiliar air about it. Let us consider more closely how it is supposed to work. The approach rests on adopting what might be caUed an axioge netic optimaUty principle to the effect that value represents a decisive advantage in regard to realization in that in the virtual competition for existence among alternatives it is the comparatively best that is bound to prevail.11 Accordingly, whenever there is a plurality of alter native possibiUties competing for realization in point of truth or of ex istence, the (or an) optimal possibiUty wins out. (An alternative is op timal when no better alternative exists, although equal ones might.) The result is that things exist, and exist as they do, because this is for the (metaphysically) best. It may be a complicated matter to appraise from a metaphysical/ ontological standpoint that condition X is better (that is, inherently more meritorious) than condition Y. But, so optimalism maintains, once this evaluative hurdle is overcome, the question "Why should it be that X rather than Y exists?" is automaticaUy settled by this very fact via the ramifications of optimaUty. In sum, a law of optimaUty prevails; value (of a suitable?as yet unspecified?sort) enjoys an ex istential impetus so that it lies in the nature of things that (one of) the best of available alternatives is realized.12 But why should it be that optimaUsm obtains? Why should what is for the best exist? What sort of plausible argument can be given on this position's behalf? The answer to these questions lies in the very nature of the principle itself. It is self-substantiating, insofar as it in volves seeing that it is automaticaUy for the best that the best alterna tive should exist rather than an inferior rival. But this is just one of its assets;13 it also offers significant systemic advantages. For of the vari 11 The prime spokesman for this line of thought within the Western philosophical tradition was G. W. Leibniz. A present-day exponent is John Leslie. See section 7 of this essay. See also the present author's The Riddle of Existence (Lanham, Md.: University Press of America, 1984). 12 To make this work out, the value of a disjunction alternative has to be fixed at the value of its optimal member, lest the disjunctive bundling of a good alternative with inferior rivals so operate as to eliminate it from compe tition.</page><page sequence="9">OPTIMALISM AND AXIOLOGICAL METAPHYSICS 815 ous plausible existential principles, it transpires?in the end?that it is optimalism that offers the most attractive option. The principle being, as it were, self-explanatory, it transpires that to ask for a different sort of explanation would be inappropriate. We must expect that any ultimate principle should explain itself and can not, in the very nature of things, admit of an external explanation in terms of something altogether different. The impetus to realization in herent in authentic value lies in the very nature of value itself. A ratio nal person would not favor the inferior alternative; and there is no rea son to think that a rational rea?ty would do so either. To be sure, one could ask, "But why should it be that reality is ra tional?" This is a problematic way of proceeding, however. For to ask this question is to ask for a reason. It is already to presume or presup pose the rationahty of things, taking the stance that what is so is and must be so for a reason. Once one poses the question "But why should it be that nature has the feature F?" it is already too late to raise the is sue of nature's rationahty. In advancing that question the matter at is sue has already been tacitly conceded. Anyone who troubles to ask for a reason why nature should have a certain feature is thereby pro ceeding within a framework of thought where nature's rationality? the amenabiUty of its features to rational explanation?is already pre sumed. Yet what is to be the status of a law of optimaUty to the effect that "whatever possibihty is for the best is ipso facto the possib?ity that is actualized." It is certainly not a logico-conceptuaUy necessary truth; from the angle of theoretical logic it has to be seen as a contingent fact?albeit one not about nature as such, but rather one about the manifold of real possibihty that underlies it. Insofar as it is necessary at aU it obtains as a matter of ontological rather than logico-concep tual necessity, while the realm of possib?ity as a whole is presumably constituted by considerations of logico-metaphysical necessity alone.14 But the division of this realm into real versus merely specula 13 Other principles can also be self-substantiating, seeing that, for exam ple, the principle of pessimism (that the worst of possible alternatives is real ized) also has this feature. 14 The operative perspective envisions a threefold order of necessity/ possibility: the logico-conceptual, the ontological or proto-physical, and the physical. It accordingly resists the positivistic tendency of the times to dis miss or ignore that second, intermediate order of considerations. This is only to be expected since people nowadays see this intermediate realm as pre dicted in value considerations, a theme that is anathema to present-day sci entism.</page><page sequence="10">816 NICHOLAS RESCHER tive possibi?ties can hinge on contingent considerations: there can be logicaUy contingent laws of possib?ity even as there are logicaUy con tingent laws of nature (that is, of reality). The point might be raised: "But if it is contingent then surely it must itself rest on some further explanation." Granted. It itself presumably has an explanation, see ing that one can and should maintain the Leibnizian principle of suffi cient reason to the effect that for every contingent fact there is a rea son why it is so rather than otherwise. But there is no decisive reason why that explanation has to be deeper and different?that is, no deci sive reason why the prospect of self-explanation has to be excluded at this fundamental level.15 After all, we cannot go on putting the ex planatory elephant on the back of the tortoise on the back of the aUi gator ad infinitum: as Aristotle already saw, the explanatory regress has to stop somewhere at a final theory?one that is Uterally self-ex planatory. What better candidate could there be than the law of opti maUty itself, with the result that the division between real and merely theoretical possib?ities is as it is (that is, value based) because that it self is for the best?the principle being, as it were, self-explanatory?16 To ask for a different sort of explanation would be inappropriate. We must expect that any ultimate principle must explain itself and can not, in the very nature of things, admit of an external explanation in terms of something altogether different. The impetus to reaUzation inherent in authentic value lies in the very nature of value itself. A ra tional person would not favor the inferior alternative; and a rational reaUty cannot do so either. To be sure, the law's operation here presupposes some value pa rameters, invoking certain physicaUy relevant features (symmetry, economy, or the like) as merit-manifesting factors. The optimization at issue is?and should be?geared to a scien?ficaUy reputable theory 15 After all, there is no reason of logico-theoretical principle why propo sitions cannot be self-certifying. Nothing vicious need be involved in self substantiation. Think of "Some statements are true" or "This statement stakes a particular rather than universal claim." 16 The reasoning at issue proceeds as follows: (1) The prevailing world order is the best that can be actualized?that is, the best that it is possible to realize; (2) The best possible order exists because that is for the best; (3) Therefore: The prevailing world order exists. What is self-explanatory here is not the existence of the world (whose explanation after all proceeds from this entire account). It is, rather, the principle of optimaUty reflected in the second premise that is self-explanatory?the fact that the best possible order exists. For this fact is part and parcel of the optimal order whose obtaining it validates.</page><page sequence="11">OPTIMALISM AND AXIOLOGICAL METAPHYSICS 817 of some suitable kind, coordinate with a complex of physica?y rele vant factors of a suitable kind. After aU, many a possible world wiU maximize a value of some sort (confusion and nastiness included). It is its (presumed) gearing to a positive value that is plausibly identifi able as physically relevant?contingently identifiable as such subject to scientific inquiry?that estabUshes optimalism as a reasonable proposition and ultimately prevents the thesis "optimaUsm obtains be cause that is for the best" from decUning into vacuity. Ontological optimalism is closely related to optimism. The opti mist holds that whatever exists is for the best, wh?e the optimaUst maintains the converse that whatever is for the best exists. But at least when we are dealing with exclusive and exhaustive alternatives the two theses converge. For if one of the alternatives A, Ah . . ., An must be the case, then if what is rea?zed is for the best it foUows auto matically that the best is realized. Optima?sm has many theoretical advantages. Here is just one of them. It is conceivable, one might contend, that the existence of the world (that is, of a world) is a necessary fact while nevertheless its na ture (that is, of which world is contingent). This would mean that sep arate and potentiaUy different answers would have to be provided for the questions "Why is there anything at aU?" and "Why is the character of existence as it is?why is it that this particular world exists?" How ever, an axiogenetic approach enjoys the advantage of rational econ omy in that it proceeds uniformly here. It provides a single rationale for both answers?namely that "this is for the best." It accordingly also enjoys the significant merit of providing for the rational economy of explanatory principles. However, a threatening difficulty seems to arise in the form of a possibihty range that is evaluatively topless?that is, which does not have some alternatives that are optimal in the sense of not being bet tered by any other. In such a range each alternative is surpassed by yet another that is better. As such, on optimalistic principles it would transpire that there are no real possibiUties at all. Within such a range there is no optimum and thus no possib?ity of actuaUzation. Here op tima?sm must take the buU by the horns. Insofar as situations can be imagined which?Uke that of a topless infinite alternative spectrum? could raise difficulties for the theory, it could and should simply be seen as part and parcel of optima?sm to assert that such situations cannot actually arise: that a reality that is benign aU the way through is thereby such as to exclude such a problematic situation. As</page><page sequence="12">818 NICHOLAS RESCHER optima?sm sees it, the very fact that toplessness conflicts with opti malism excludes it from the range of real possibiUties. But what if there is a plura?ty of features contributing to perfec tion, so interrelated that more of the one demands less of the other? Here it would result that nothing is straightforwardly best. This may be so, but matters need not be straightforward. In such cases one can?and should?resort to a function of combination that allows for the interaction of those different value parameters. For example, with two operative value-making factors, say cheapness (that is, in verse acquisition cost) and durab?ity in the case of a 100 watt Ught bulb, one w?l use the ratio, cost of purchase divided by hours of us ab?ity, as a measure of merit. This ratio makes possible the reduction of the multifactor case to the situation of a single compound and com plex factor so that optimization is once again possible. That this re duction is possible is guaranteed by optimalism itself; it is part and parcel of the best possible order of things that optimalism should be operable within it. Yet is such a theory of axiological ontogenesis not defeated by the objection: If it were the case that value explains existence, then why is not the world altogether perfect in every regard? The answer lies in the inherent complexity of value. An object that is of any value at aU is subject to a complex of values. For it is the fundamental fact of axiology that every evaluation-admitting object has a plura?ty of evaluative features. Consider an automob?e. Its pa rameters of merit clearly include such factors as speed, reUab?ity, re pair infrequency, safety, operating economy, aesthetic appearance, road-handling abiUty. In actual practice such features are interre lated, and it is unavoidable that they trade off against one another: more of A means less of B. It would be ridiculous to have a supersafe car with a maximum speed of two m?es per hour. It would be ridicu lous to have a car that is inexpensive to operate but spends three fourths of the time in a repair shop. In any multicriterial setting, absolute perfection is simply an im possib?ity. Perfection?maximum rea?zation of every value dimen sion aU at once?is simply unrealizable because of the interaction of parameters: in designing a car you cannot maximize both safety and economy of operation. Analogously the world is not absolutely per fect?perfect in every respect?because this sort of absolute perfec tion is in principle impossible to rea?ze. Of course it makes no sense to ask for the impossible. Accordingly, the objection "If value is the</page><page sequence="13">OPTIMALISM AND AXIOLOGICAL METAPHYSICS 819 key to existence, the world would be perfect" collapses. All that wiU follow on axiogenetic principles is that the world will exempUfy an op timal interactive balance of the relevant natural factors. An optimally rea?zable best need not be perfect in the naive sense of that term which unrea?sticaUy demands maxima?ty in every relevant respect. Leibniz had the right approach here: optima?sm does not maintain that the world is absolutely perfect but just that it be the best that is possible?that it outranks the avaUable alternatives. It is an inherently inevitable feature of the nature of things?an mevitable fact of life?that value reaUzation is always a matter of bal ance, of trade-offs, of compromise. The reality of it is that value fac tors always compete in matters of reaUzation. A concurrent maximum in every dimension is simply unavoidable in this (or indeed any other reaUsticaUy conceivable) world. All that one can ever reasonably ask for is an auspicious combination of values. Nevertheless how can sensible people possibly embrace the con ception that the inherently best alternative is thereby automatically the actual (true) one? Does not the world's all too evident imperfec tion stand decisively in the way here? The matter is not all that simple, however, for the issue is going to pivot on the question of what "inherently best" means. If it means best from that angle of your desires, or of my interests, or even of the ad vantage of homo sapiens in general, then clearly the thesis loses its strong appeal. For such plausibiUty it is necessary that "best" be con strued as looking to the condition of existence as a whole rather than one particular privileged individual or group. OptimaUty in this con text is clearly not going to be a matter of the affective welfare or stan dard of living of some particular sector of existence; it is going to have to be a metaphysical good of some synoptic and rather abstract sort that looks to the condition of the whole. Accordingly the objection "Is not optimalism simply too PoUyarma-ish to be plausible?" can be met effectively. The optima?st need not simply shut his eyes to the world's aU too evident parochially considered imperfections. For what the optima?st can and should do is insist that because of the in tricate inherent interrelationships among value parameters, an imper fection in this or that respect must be taken in stride because they have to be there for an optimal overall combination of value to be real ized. There is, in fact, a point of view from which optimaUsm is a posi tion that is not so much optimistic as deeply pessimistic. This view holds that even the best of possible arrangements is bound to exhibit</page><page sequence="14">820 NICHOLAS RESCHER very real imperfections from the angle of narrowly parochial concerns or interests. As regards the sort of value that indeed is at issue, this is something that w?l aU be dealt with in some detail below. IV The Problem of How Value Can Have Explanatory Efficacy: Overlooking Some Objections. A seeming obstacle to optima?sm looms in the question "But how can value possibly exert a causally productive influence?" The answer to this good question is that it does not. What value conditions do is not to create anything (that is, productively engender its realization). Their modus operandi is not causal but modal: their role is to block or preclude certain theoreti caUy conceivable possibiUties from realizabiUty. They serve an en tirely restrictive function and only manage to preclude certain theo retical possib?ities from quaUfying as ontological (potentially achievable) possibiUties. At this stage we contemplate a tripartite hi erarchy of (increasingly substantive) possibiUties: logical, ontological, and physical, subject to the control of logic, of axiology, and of phys ics, respectively. It is thus at the middle level of ontological possib?i ties that axiology does its work. The operative impetus of optimaUty does not express itself by way of causaUty in the realm of the real but rather by way of a determination in the realm of the genuinely possi ble?that is, of the metaphysically rather than logically possible. This metaphysical possib?ity should be seen as constraining the most fun damental laws of physics, the most basic of which would emerge as invariant with respect to those metaphysical possibiUties. The overaU story that must be narrated here runs as foUows: na ture?physical reality as we have it?represents the actualization of certain possib?ities. But underlying this existential condition of af fairs is the operation of a prior sub- or metaphysical principle, opera tive within the wider domain of logical possib?ity, and dividing this domain into disjoint sectors of real and purely theoretical possibihty. To put it very figuratively, logical possibiUties are involved in a virtual struggle for existence in which the axiologicaUy best win out so as to become real possib?ities. SpecificaUy, even when there are (mutually exclusive) alternatives that are possible in theory, none w?l be a real or ontological possib?ity for reaUzation as actual or as true if some other alternative is superior to it. The ava?abiUty of a better alterna</page><page sequence="15">OPTIMALISM AND AXIOLOGICAL METAPHYSICS 821 tive disqualifies its inferiors from qua?fying as ontologicaUy ava? able?as real?that is, metaphysical?possib?ities. Thus, whenever there is a uniquely best alternative, this alternative is ipso facto real ized as actual or true. Optima?sm is certainly a teleological theory; it holds that nature's modus operandi manifests a tropism toward a certain end or telos to wit optimization. The upshot represents a doctrine of final causes in Aristotle's sense; but this axiology is emphaticaUy not a causal theory in the nowadays standard sense of efficient causation. It does not? and does not need to?regard value as a somehow efficient cause, a productive agency. On the contrary?value is not productive at aU, but merely eliminative in so functioning as to block the way to avail abiUty of inferior productions. It does not drive causal processes but only canalizes or delimits them by ruUng certain theoretical (or logi cal) possib?ities outside the realm of real possib?ity. Consider an analogy. The EngUsh language allows double letters in its words, but not triple letters, but that does not mean that the double S of "pussy" causes that letter foUowing the double S to be something different from S. It merely imposes a structural constraint of possib?ity. The lawful principle at issue explains the factual situation without any in vocation of causality, and we see that an explanation via inherent con straints on possib?ity is not a causal explanation at all. At this point a skeptical reader wiU doubtless ask, "Given a spec trum of possib?ity with a structure such as (1) (2) (3), what would be the difference between an elimination that excludes the A of actua?ty from compartment (3) and thereby impels it to the two left-most com partments numbered (1) and (2), and a magnetic attraction that that causes A to move toward the left and thereby out of compartment (3)? Is the effect not the same either way?" This point is well taken?as far as it goes. However, it overlooks something important. The fact is that an attractive force requires and involves a causal agency of some sort. Possibihty exclusions, on the other hand, can simply root in the general modus operandi of things without any refer ence to causal agency. Consider an analogy. Suppose that a society exhibits a suicide rate of 1.2 per 100 per annum during a certain era of its existence. No positive force is at work in constraining it to meet its quota of suicides?no identifiable cause engenders this aggregate re sult. WhUe it is literaUy impossible to have a suicideless year, this lies in the nature of things generaUy and not in the potency of some</page><page sequence="16">822 NICHOLAS RESCHER suicide-impe?ing power or force. This result is not produced by some ad hoc force or agency or power?it is simply a feature of how things work in this context. Again, more than 5 percent of the letters on the first page of tomorrow's Times newspaper w?l be E's. Yet no force or power compels this effect. Wh?e it is literaUy impossible for no E's to occur, and the nature of the situation precludes this prospect, there is no force of attraction to constrain the presence of E's. It is inevitable that there will be more E's than Z's but this result is not the product of any power or force but resides simply and solely in the modus oper andi of the language. With the explanation of why physical objects and events exist we must indeed invoke causes and effects. But laws of nature them selves do not exist as causal products?they just obtain. Now when laws obtain, there is, no doubt, a reason for their obtaining (an axio logical reason, as we ourselves see it), but this reason can presumably be provided by an explanatory principle that need not carry us into the order of efficient causality through the motivations of an agent. To insist upon asking how values are able to function causaUy in law realization is simply to adopt an inappropriate model for the pro cesses involved. Value explanation just is not causal: values do not function in the order of efficient causa?ty at aU, and so the law of op timaUty yields those results not via the mysterious attractive power of optimal possib?ities but because suboptimal possib?ities are ex cluded through a displacement by their superior rivals which simply preempts their place in possib?ity space. Axiogenetic theory has it that even as the presence of Ught displaces darkness, so does the ava?abi?ty of better alternatives preclude the very possibihty of any inferior so-caUed alternatives requiring the intervention of a produc tive agent or agency. As such, in essence this line of reply concedes that value does not engender existence in the mode of efficient causation and that it would indeed be rather mysterious if values were asked to play a causal role in regard to laws. But this is to be seen as irrelevant. The real point is that wh?e value does not efficiently cause existence it nevertheless explains it, precisely because causal explanation is not the only sort of explanation there is. As such the fact that axiology does not provide such an explanation is not an occasion for appropri ate complaint. It does not stop value explanations from being expla nations. They present perfectly good answers to "Why is something or-other so?" type questions. It is just that in relation to laws, values</page><page sequence="17">OPTIMALISM AND AXIOLOGICAL METAPHYSICS 823 play only an explanatory role through possib?ity elimination and not a causaUy productive role through actual creation. This is no defect be cause a productive process is simply not caUed for. Thus, wh?e axiological explanations fa? to address a question for which design explanations have an answer?namely the causal ques tion "How do values operate productively so as to bring particular laws to actua?zation?"?this reflects no demerit. For this question is simply inappropriate in the axiological setting. Values do not operate in the causal order at aU. They function only?and quite ineffi ciently?as constraints within the manifold of possib?ity. The issue of a specifically causal efficacy simply does not arise with axiological ex planation. What we have here, then, is not the operation of some rather mys terious force or agency but the preclusion (or rarefaction) of certain (theoretical) possibiUties owing to the operation of natural law: a combination of the space of possibihty from a wider range of hypo thetical possibihty to a narrow range of possibiUties under the aegis of lawful principles?and the optimaUty principle in the present case. (Here "direct" preempts the prospect of a deeper explanation in terms of further principles relating to the operation of the powers or forces of some agent or agency.) The point is that the regress of explanatory principles must have a stop and that it is here?with axiology?that we reach a natural terminus by way of self-explanation. The long and short of it is that axio-ontology can be autonomous and nomicaUy self sufficient: it does not need to be seen as based in the operative power of some productive force or power or agency. If such an axiogenetic explanation is to work, then since there is only one real world the manifold of real possibiUties must ultimately be reduced to one. That is, a series of successively operable value considerations must reduce the manifold of theoretical possibiUties more and more restrictively until at last, as with the Uttle Indians of the story, there remains but a single one. And that one is, in a very real sense, necessitated: it is, so to speak, constrained by value. Does this necessitation bespeak a Spinozistic determinism? WiU it engender a block universe where every deta? is deterministicaUy ne cessitated? By no means. The necessitation at issue relates to the why of the universe and not to its what. It is not only conceivable but presumably actual that the best possible world whose existence is ax iologicaUy necessitated by value considerations is one which in its in ternal mode of functioning provides for the contingencies of chance</page><page sequence="18">824 NICHOLAS RESCHER and free agency. The necessitation at issue here must emphaticaUy not be construed as a matter of occurrence determinism as this is standardly construed in metaphysical dehberations. V The Value Efficacy Objection and the Theological Aspect. But what of the theological dimension? Optima?sm must come to terms with the complaint "Values are inherently anthropomorphic: it is only through constituting the motives of agents that they can possibly ob tain explanatory efficacy. Only by serving as some dehberate agent's motivational repertoire can a value come into effective operation." This Une of thought leads to the disjunction: The axiological explana tion of nature's laws with reference to values is not really self-suffi cient. Without recourse to the productive agency of a creator God, the question of how values secure their functional efficacy remains unresolved. For how can values in and of themselves ever acquire their modus operandi in the determination of laws? Only design ex planations can offer us an answer here: Values are brought to bear on the world through the divine w?l which governs the productive agency of God. This objection demands an answer to the question of how values can possibly figure in the reaUzation of things save through the media tion of the purposes of a creatively active being?a finite agent with mundane things, and with the universe as a whole, who else but God. We may characterize this as a theisticaUy based value efficacy objec tion. It clearly poses a chaUenge with which an axiological theory of explanation must come to terms. Such a view of value explanation is nothing new?it has existed in embargo since Plato's day thanks to his conception of demiurge. The basic idea is that the only way in which values can be brought to bear in the explanation of phenomena is through the mediation of a creative agent. Accordingly, thinkers from classical antiquity onward have defended (or attacked) the principle that explaining the pres ence of order in nature?the fact that the world is a cosmos requires postulating a creative inteUigence as its cause. That nature manifests and exemplifies such cognitive values as order, harmony, and unifor mity was thus explained by regarding these as marks of purpose. On this basis, the mainstream of Western thought regarding axiological</page><page sequence="19">OPTIMALISM AND AXIOLOGICAL METAPHYSICS 825 explanation has taken the line that there is a supernatural agent (God, demiurge, or cosmic spirit) and that values obtain their explanatory bearing by influencing the state of mind which governs his creative en deavors. This essentially purposive approach characterizes the tradi tional argument from design, which explains the creation with refer ence to a creator (as its ratio essend?) and infers the existence of this creator from the orderly structure of created nature (as his ratio cog noscendi).17 The sequential explanatory shde from design to value to purpose to inteUigence was historicaUy seen as inexorable. As such, the idea of a recourse to an explanatory principle that is geared to val ues without any such mediation represents a radical departure. The guiding conception of the present dehberations?that value is the nat ural place to sever this chain?reflects a break with a longstanding tradition. However, the justification of this break lies in observing the im portant distinction between values and purposes. Granted, a purpose must be somebody's purpose?it must have some intelhgent agent as its owner-operator. It lies in the very nature of the concept that pur poses cannot exist in splendid isolation; they must, in the final analy sis, belong to some agent or other. For purposes as such, to be is to be adopted. Purposive explanations operate in terms of why conscious agent do things, and not in terms of why impersonal conditions obtain. A value, however, can be altogether impersonal. To say that something is a value is not to say that anybody actuaUy values it. A person can certainly hold a certain value dear but if it indeed is a value, then its status as such is no more dependent on its actuaUy be ing valued than the symmetry of a landscape depends on its actually being discerned. Values admit of being prized, but that does not mean that they actuaUy are, any more than a task's being difficult means that anyone actuaUy attempts it. To be of value is to deserve to be valued, but that of course need not actuaUy happen: the value of things can be underestimated or overestimated or totaUy overlooked. Neither the items that have value nor the facts of their being of value depend on apprehending minds for their reaUty. This holds in particular for 17 For a useful collection of relevant texts see Donald R. Burrill, The Cos mological Arguments: A Spectrum of Opinion (Garden City, N.Y.: Anchor Books, 1967). Two interesting recent accounts of the issues and their histori cal ramifications are WiUiam L. Rowe, The Cosmological Argument (Prince ton: Princeton University Press, 1975), and Wi?iam L. Craig, The Cosmologi cal Argument From Plato to Leibniz (London: Macmillan, 1980).</page><page sequence="20">826 NICHOLAS RESCHER ontological values like economy, simp?city, regularity, uniformity, and so forth, that figure in the axiological explanation of laws. The being of values does not consist in their being perceived?not any more than does the being of most other sorts of things. When someone adopts a certain value, fostering or promoting that value can of course become one of his purposes. "Promoting friendship among the members" can function exactly as "getting elected president of the club" in regard to being someone's purpose. But values as such (simplicity, for example) are not purposes any more than offices ("being president") are?though, of course, their promotion or more ample reaUzation may weU function as some body's purpose. The crucial point is that the being a value does not necessarily entail being adopted by someone, any more than the being a truth necessarily enta?s being endorsed by someone. Just here is where the shift from purpose to value explanation is decisively advantageous. A purpose must be somebody's purpose, and if something has a purpose at aU then it must be the case that it serves somebody's purpose. In this regard purpose is different from value insofar as for value, less baggage is required. While people in deed can value things, something can be of value?can have value? without being valued by anybody?not even God. (To be sure it must be valuable for something or other but it need not be valued by some body; in principle clean air can be valuable for mammals without be ing valued by any of them.) In general, then, we need not embed values in purposes; axiologi cal explanation can stand on its own feet. Axiological existence-ex planation can thus proceed entirely outside the purposive order. In taking the axiological route, one is not saying that the reaUzation of value is reaUty's purpose. We need not personify nature to account for its features. To say that nature embodies value is a very far cry from saying that the reaUzation of value is one of its purposes. That reality operates in a certain manner?that its modus operandi follows certain laws or principles?is in general an entirely impersonal thesis. The values involved in axiological explanation need not be some body's values. No element of personification, no reference to any one's aims or purposes, need be involved in axiological explanation. Purpose, on the other hand, necessarily requires a purposer?it must be somebody's purpose. In this regard, value stands with order rather than with purpose. Order-seeking in nature does not presuppose an orderer, nor value-seeking a valuer. The maintenance of enhance</page><page sequence="21">OPTIMALISM AND AXIOLOGICAL METAPHYSICS 827 ment of a value can be a matter of b?nd operation of impersonal forces or factors. Given that it is values rather than purposes that function in axio logical explanation, these explanations can be entirely impersonal. Values here function directly rather than via the mediation of agents. Values, in sum, can affect the constitution of reaUty directly through serving as possib?ity constraints rather than mediately through the aims and objectives of agents. And so, from the angle of explanation, a final causality of value has substantial advantages over a final causa?ty of purpose. To be sure, both represent modes of final rather than efficient causation, since in both cases we deal with tendencies toward the reaUzation of some prespecifiable condition of things. But these two forms of tele ology are altogether distinct. The former explains regularities in terms of their conduciveness to some purposive agent's aims and ob jectives ("he never mixes business with pleasure"). The latter ex plains them through an in-principle universal force that exerts an op erative value-impetus such as efficiency or economy. Accordingly, an axiological ontogenesis can be a matter of nomological constraint based on values, and not a matter of efficient causality at aU?it is a causa?ty in name only. In this respect, the present axiological approach differs decisively from that of Leibniz. He answered the question "Why is it that the value-optimizing world should be the one that actuaUy exists?" with reference to the w?l of a God who chooses to adopt value optimiza tion as a creative principle. Leibniz was committed to an idea that it is necessary to account for the obtaining of a principle in terms of the operation of an existing entity (specifically the agency of an intelhgent being?namely God). Instead, our axiological approach sees the ex planatory bearing of a principle of value as direct, without mediation through the agency of a substantial being (however extraordinary) as final and fundamental.18 On grounds of explanatory economy, at least, 18 Our metaphysical invocation of a principle of value is akin to A. C. Ew ing's theological app?cation of similar ideas in an interesting article in which he propounds the argument that God's existence is to be accounted for axio logicaQy: that he exists "because it was supremely good that God should ex ist"; A. C. Ewing, "Two 'Proofs' of God's Existence," Religious Studies 1 (1961): 35. This approach has the substantial merit of avoiding Leibniz's tac tic of grounding the efficacy of value in a preexisting deity by contemplating the prospect that value is so fundamental that the deify itself can be ac counted for in its terms.</page><page sequence="22">828 NICHOLAS RESCHER purpose is thus something that we would be weU advised to do with out if we can actually manage to do so. Altogether different explanatory processes are thus at issue in axiological and in purposive explanation, and the ontological require ments of the former are a great deal more modest than those of the latter. To hold that nature operates so as to minimize or maximize this or that evaluative factor does not commit us to presupposing a purposive agency as working in or behind nature. The rationale of value can be self-contained; it can stay clear of any involvement with matters of causality, agency, and purpose. VI Divorcing Axiological Explanation from the Argument from Design: Cosmic Value Without a Cosmic Valuer. Since it is values rather than purposes that function in axiological explanation, these explanations can be entirely impersonal. We need not commit the pa thetic faUacy in personalizing matters here. In metaphysics, values can function directly rather than via the mediation of agents. The idea is simply that the system in question is value-tropic (as it were) in that it inherently tends to realize certain value-endowed conditions, such as maintaining stab?ity, achieving symmetry, prolonging longevity, operating efficiently, and so forth. Of course, the system that com ports itself in this way need not overtly hold such a value?Uke a physical system that pursues the path of least resistance, it may weU be the sort of thing for which the conscious adoption of values is sim ply not possible. To reemphasize: when its modus operandi estab lishes commitment to a certain value, nature need not seek value any more than water need seek its own level. Value can enter into an ex planation simply by way of characterizing a tendentious, quasi-teUc feature of its modus operandi, and thus is something very different from a purpose or aim that requires actual adoption. For a claim to end-directed transactions in the world ("Nature abhors a vacuum") is without any presuppositions or impUcations with regard to a purpo sively operating mind. A system can be goal directed through its in herent natural programming (for example, hehotropism or homeosta sis) without any admixture of purpose even as a conservation of energy principle need not be held on the basis of nature's seeking to conserve energy. In sum the values at issue are impersonal and natu</page><page sequence="23">OPTIMALISM AND AXIOLOGICAL METAPHYSICS 829 ral in relating to the physical and metaphysical status of potential exis tents. For there is no good reason why a axiology could not take the form of a value naturalism?and very good reason why it should do so. In adopting the axiological turn with regard to explanation, we need not (and should not) take the step of supposing that a mind within or behind nature acts as the source of value. We need not im plement the principle of axiology by way of personification. Indeed to do so would be self-defeating, since we ideaUy want to explain exist ence in a way that is self-sustaining (self-contained, ultimate). Thus, confronted with the challenge "What if one is skeptical about theism? Would one then not have to reject optima?sm?" the op tima?st replies: "Not at aU." Optimalism does not require theism? one need not caU upon God to institute optimalism. As we have seen, the doctrine is perfectly self supportive: it obtains on its own basis, be cause that is for the best.19 And here indeed Ues one of the prime rea sons for taking axiological explanation seriously: it enables us to avert the temptations and difficulties of theological explanation. To be sure, why nature so operates as to implement the value V w?l require some explanation. Yet as we have seen, the prospect of self-invoking explanations is ava?able here. For example, nature fos ters economy (simphcity, harmony, and so forth) because that is the most economical of things for it to do. Or again, why do its laws exist as they do? Because that is for the axiological best in optimizing the systemic operations that obtain. Why does what is for the best obtain? Just exactly because that itself is for the best. The explanation of the operation of laws is axiological (value-referential). The explanation of the obtaining of values is self-referential?that is, is also axiological. The possib?ity of providing an explanation on its own basis?a reflex ive explanation that is literaUy a self-explanation?is now before us. Value is, or can be, regress-stopping: it can be final by way of being self-explanatory in a manner purpose cannot be. To reach outside the value domain itself to equip value with a pur posive explanation that is theological in nature is unnecessary and counterproductive?it compUcates rather than simplifies the explana tory process inasmuch as we then cannot avoid the question "Why does the putative creator adopt this purpose?" The response to this 19 Indeed an overenthusiastic optima?st could take the line that theism hinges on optimalism rather than the reverse because: "God's own existence issues from optimalism: he exists because that is for the best."</page><page sequence="24">830 NICHOLAS RESCHER question must take the form that he deems (and of course, since it is God that is at issue, rightly deems) to be of value. And this response at once carries us back to axiology. Recourse to divine purpose merely adds a complex epicycle once the question of the rational va lidity of this purpose arises. We now have a two-factor explanation of creator plus value, where in principle a one-factor explanation in terms of value as such can accompUsh the explanatory task. FoUowing the guidelines of Kant's Critique of Teleological Judg ment, Archbishop Temple writes: The chain of causes is not self-explanatory_There is in fact only one principle which is self-explanatory; it is Purpose. When in tracing any causal nexus we read the activity of a wiU fulfUling a Purpose with which we ourselves sympathize, we are in fact satisfied.20 But this is very problematic because purpose clearly does not stand at the end of the explanatory line. A rational agent's purpose always has a rationale: the that of purpose leaves open the question why. It is al together appropriate to inquire why an agent A adopts a particular purpose P: the question of the rationale for that purpose cannot be avoided. The good archbishop is simply wrong to think of purpose as an explanatory ultimate. However much we may sympathize with someone's purposes, they w?l still remain items on the explanatory agenda. If you are famished, then however thoroughly I may under stand your plight, your purpose of getting food stiU needs (and is ca pable of receiving) an explanation?immediately in terms of hunger satisfaction, and ultimately in terms of the value of pain avoidance. The operation of a rationahy adopted purpose must itself always root in a value of some sort: well-being in the present case. The explana tion is doubtless eminently simple and straightforward, but its being obvious is something quite different from its being superfluous. The cardinal difference between the present axiological ap proach and the traditional theological argumentation from design thus turns on keeping values apart from divine intentions and pur poses. To say that rea?ty is subject to an evaluative principle is em phatically not to personify nature or to persona?ze the productive forces that serve to explain it. There is enormous confusion in the ph?osophical tradition on this point. Early on, Anaximander of M?e tus and other Presocratic nature philosophers were prepared to do 20 WU?am Temple, Contemporary British Philosophy, First Series, ed. J. H. Muirhead (London: AUen &amp; Unwin, 1925), 418.</page><page sequence="25">OPTIMALISM AND AXIOLOGICAL METAPHYSICS 831 without the idea that cosmic order requires an orderer. But Plato and especiaUy Christian Neoplatonism entrenched this idea in Western phUosophy almost beyond recaU. Yet this stance is eminently ques tionable. For one simply need not locate the source of value in a per sonal creator, a divine mind or spirit that is an agent whose creative actions are animated by a desire for the good. Hume, Kant, and the countless post-Darwinian anti-teleologists to the contrary notwith standing, the conception that order requires an orderer st?l continues to be deeply entrenched. Yet this temptation must be resisted?order no more requires an orderer or value a valuer than temperature de mands a heat-sensitively sentient being. Value itself is taken to consti tute a determinative force, capable on its own footing of providing a principle of explication without the mediation of a personal agent for whom it serves as a determining motive. In the 19th century, W?Uam Whewell wrote: The examination of the material world brings before us a number of things and relations of things which suggest to most minds the beliefs of a creating and presiding Intelligence.21 Many theorists from Leibniz to Einstein have held exactly this same view.22 But the history of science?where God has been asked to do less and less explanatory work over the course of time?is such as to make it reasonable to contemplate and account for design without re course to a designer. The axiology at issue should thus be seen as a natura?stic one. The values at issue are to encompass factors Uke stab?ity, symmetry, continuity, complexity, order, and even a dynamic impetus to the de velopment of higher forms possessed of more sophisticated capab?i ties?perhaps even a sort of Hegelian impetus toward the evolution ary emergence of a creature possessed of an inteUigence able to comprehend and appreciate the universe itself, creating a conscious reduphcation model of the universe in the realm of thought through the artifice of inteUigence. So in any event these values are mundane and nontranscendental and the axiology at issue is an altogether natu ralistic one that can be posited on the basis of the world's observable features. After aU, it is plausible to take the natura?stic line that in 21 Wil?am Whewe?, Astronomy and General Physics Considered with Reference to Natural Theology (London: H. G. Bohn, 1852), 1. 22 See Lewis S. Feuer, "Noumenalism and Einstein's Argument for the Existence of God," Inquiry 26 (1981): 251-85.</page><page sequence="26">832 NICHOLAS RESCHER reasoning from the character of nature we should remain in the natu ral realm. Whatever values we may find to inhere in the operations of nature are stiU something natural?there is nothing supranatural (let alone supernatural) about it. A universe that functions under the ae gis of value no more requires an underlying valuer than a universe that exhibits lawful order necessarily requires a lawgiver or a universe that has a start in time (such as a big bang) necessarily requires a creator. The value at issue can be entirely natural, reflecting an inherent as pect of the modus operandi of nature. Vaiue-tropism requires the sup port of an inteUigence no more than a principle of conservation or a principle of least action does. Our axiarchic theory is thus without theological demands or imp?cations?and this is aU to the good, for that nature is the product of the operations of a designing intelhgence is not something we can learn convincingly merely from a study of the workings of nature itself. Accordingly, axiology need not be tied to reUgion as this enter prise is usuaUy understood.23 It may be tempting for us anthropomor phizing humans to ground nature's elegant laws in the mathemati cized planning of an originative intelhgence, but the merit of an axiological approach shows that this temptation can?and should? be resisted. From the days of Laplace and Darwin onward, it has be come increasingly clear that design in nature does not entail a de signer of nature, a purposing inteUigence behind nature, a creator god. The axiological explanation of nature and its laws circumvents the cosmological argument rather than engendering some version of it. To be sure, axiological explanation is not incompatible with the ism?on the contrary, it is thoroughly congenial to it. (A benign Cre ator would certainly create a duly optimal world.) But a theory of ax iological ontogenesis certainly does not require a further recourse to the theological domain. What is at issue here is not an odium theo logicum?an aversion to theological considerations as such. It is 23 To be sure, some idealists envision a religion in which God plays so smaU a roll that even the present theory can count as "religious." J. M. E. McTaggart, for example, defined religion as "an emotion resting on a connec tion of a harmony between ourselves and the universe at large"; J. M. E. McTaggart, Some Dogmas of Religion (London: E. Arnold, 1906), 3. But, of course, since we humans are ourselves an evolved part of nature, some de gree of affective harmony is pretty weU inevitable in a way that need not have much of religion about it on any ordinary understanding of the matter.</page><page sequence="27">OPTIMALISM AND AXIOLOGICAL METAPHYSICS 833 rather the idea of the medieval dictum non in philosophia resurrence est ad deum?that we should not ask God to puU our philosophical chestnuts out of the fire. Questions Uke "Why is there anything at aU?" are philosophical questions and they ought ideally to be answered by phUosophical means. On the other hand, it must be stressed that axiological explana tion is altogether congenial to theism?even though it does not require it. After aU it is only to be expected that if the world is created by a God of a sort that the tradition encourages us to accept, then the world that such a God creates should be one in which values play a role. Thus it would seem that theism requires axiological explanation distinctly more than axiological explanation requires theism. But what of the epistemic dimension? What sort of evidence speaks for axiogenesis? What sorts of grounds are there for claiming that what is for the best actuaUy exists? In general we verify abstract theses by monitoring the acceptabil ity of their concrete consequences. There is no reason not to apply this general principle in the present case as weU. Of course it aU de pends?specifically, on the standard of merit or value that we employ. Clearly if the standard is one of such specifically human-advantage value as comfort, peace of mind, security of existence, or the like, then this claim becomes very problematic and questionable. But if the values at issue are less blatantly anthropomorphic and more meta physical?if they look to such factors as nomic order under the aegis of natural laws congenial to the progressive development of life and inteUigence?then matters appear in a less problematic light. Axio genesis has to be seen as a confirmable thesis whose evidentiation hinges on the systematizing of our knowledge of nature's ways. The crux would now be a framework of natural law engendering a course of progressive development whose successive phases of cosmic, bio logical, and rational evolution provide for the emergence of intelligent Ufe forms able not only to understand nature under the aegis of sci ence but also to appreciate it under the aegis of reUgion. What is piv otal here is thus not just a lawful order in nature but a lawful order able to provide an effective pathway akin to a scientific understanding and an aesthetic appreciation. Yet these are matters that have to emerge from inquiry. PhUosophical dehberations can do no more than show that the theory is ava?able as a plausible prospect that has cer tain theoretical advantages over its alternatives. Its acceptabUity wiU ultimately hinge on the progress of science itself.</page><page sequence="28">834 NICHOLAS RESCHER VII As already noted, the axio-ontological position set out here is clearly indebted to the teachings of G. W. Leibniz. More recently, a kindred position has been defended by the Canadian philosopher John Leslie.24 There are, however, substantial differences between LesUe's approach and that of the present discussion. LesUe's position is predicated on the idea that the values at issue are specificaUy ethical values, so that for him "the world's existence and make-up" are products of "a directly active ethical necessity" with the result that "ethical requirements are creatively powerful."25 On this basis, Les?e contemplates a productive agent or agency which, wh?e not necessarily identifiable with God, is nevertheless a being whose creative action is thereby appraisable in the category of right/wrong. As Les?e sees it, ethicaUy guided dutiful agency is the crux, and reality is the creation of a power or agency, subject to the impulse of ethical considerations. He has Uttle alternative to this, since to be productively effective ethical considerations must be the link between producer and product. No such anthropomorphism invades the present axiological ac count. It sees the real as emerging from a modus operandi inherently natural to the manifold of possib?ity itself. That is to say it sees this manifold as subject to value oriented principles of operation that serve to condense a plura?ty of possibiUties down to a unique alterna tive, so that among a multitude of logical possibiUties only a single real (or physical) possib?ity remains, which is actualized in virtue of this very fact. The world thus exists of necessity; however, the neces sity in question is not logical but rather metaphysical or axiological in nature. The aspect of productive agency which is crucial to Leslie's deontological ontogenesis?as it was to that of Leibniz?is altogether absent from the present axiological ontogenesis. The values contemplated in the present discussion are ontologi cal rather than ethical values?that is, values that he in the spectrum 24 He initially expounded it in a paper entitled "The Theory that the World Exists Because It Should," American Philosophical Quarterly 7 (1970): 286-98, and subsequently developed it more fully in his book Value and Eccistence (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1979). See also his paper "The World's Necessary Existence," International Journal for Philosophy of Reli gion 18 (1980): 207-23, and his book Universes (New York: Routledge, 1996). 25 John Leslie, "The Theory that the World Exists Because It Should," 268.</page><page sequence="29">OPTIMALISM AND AXIOLOGICAL METAPHYSICS 835 of good/bad rather than in that of right/wrong.26 Accordingly, the present position prescinds from the requirement of a productive-cre ative-active agency or power, instead viewing the effect of value not in terms of productive exigency but rather in terms of exclusion. Its op erative principle is not the magnetic attraction that a consideration of the good exerts upon a creative agent, but the eliminative impetus within in the range of real possibiUties. Leslie's axiological ontology pivots on the idea that ethics some how requires existence. The present theory moves in the reverse di rection to stipulate that existence does (and axiologically must) have a nature that paves the way to ethics: to the evolutionary emergence of a creature capable of recognizing its duties in relation to the fur therance of the good. Thus, as in big bang cosmology, the universe of cosmic evolution begins with physics and gives rise to biology?let alone anthropology and psychology?only late in the game. On its tell ing it transpires that ontological values are basic in ontogenesis. They are aporetic from the very first, wh?e specifically ethical values emerge on the world stage only in due course with the evolution and emergence of inteUigent agents.
