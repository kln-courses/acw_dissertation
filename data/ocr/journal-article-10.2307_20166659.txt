<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Nootka "Wild Man" masquerade and the Forest Spirit tradition of the southern Northwest Coast DAVID W. PENNEY The Nootka, a Wakashan-speaking people who live on the stormy West Coast of Vancouver Island, produced finely crafted and expressive masks for their dances and ceremonies, much like many of the other tribes of the Northwest Coast. Nootka masks look unique stylistically, yet compare closely with those of their neighbors; they reflect local concerns and values, yet relate to traditions of thought common to much of the southern part of this region. To investigate their significance, in terms of their plastic form and ideological content, demands a consideration of both what is without and what is within. My purpose here is to examine a particularly important theme in Nootka mask art and attempt to place it within the context of southern Northwest Coast mask art as a whole. Before our era of modern communication and transport, the Nootka universe consisted of the inhabitable coast delimited by two opposite natural realms, the ocean and the forest interior. To this ocean hunting people, the sea was familiar, reassuring, and the source of livelihood. The forest, on the other hand, situated between the social world of the village and the mountain home of spirits, was the privileged domain of supernatural experience (Drucker 1951:151). This attitude toward the forest is most thoroughly expressed in the Tlokwalle ritual, the Nootka variant of the Winter Ceremonial. The scenario, much oversimplified, runs as follows: Spirit wolves, who live inside the base of a mountain, descend upon the village and kidnap the young men. They are carried off into the forest and the village must rally to recapture them. Once returned, the supernatural intensity of their experience has rendered the young men hysterical and charged with spirit power. Tlokwalle society members thereupon "cure" the stricken young men and return them to society. The sequence of events, carefully contrived by the sponsor of the ceremony, parallels shamanic inspiration and toatli acquisition experiences (toatli means "ceremonial prerogatives"). In each case, an encounter with a spirit leads to a supernatural experience in the forest that results in a transfer of power (see Drucker 1951:163, 166, 181-201). The forest functions as the common ground between human and spirit, a zone where the mythic and social worlds overlap. Certain Nootka spirit concepts personify this quality of the forest rather explicitly. The Nootka believed that the forest was inhabited or frequented by several types of anthropomorphic spirit beings. Some had particular importance as shaman familiars, others little reality beyond the folktale. But certain forest spirits actively participate in religious ceremony. Their personalities, movements, gestures, appearance, and powers are caught and made real in the palpable substance of sculpture, dance, pantomime, and song. These are the "wild men." The term addresses several spirit identities in fact, all expressed in masquerade within the context of the Tlokwalle ceremonial. Most Nootka subdivisions, and the related Makah, presented a "wild-man" or forest-spirit masquerade during the Tlokwalle ceremonial. In some of these ceremonies, the forest spirit ran with the spirit wolf packs when the novices were kidnapped. But more often, forest-spirit masks appeared among the "imitative dances," a series of dances presented by the sponsor of the ceremony and performed by those designated by him. Imitative dances took place after the novices returned to the village, during the period of their cure. The sponsor owned rights to particular imitative dances through inheritance from either his mother's or father's lineages. Very often the sponsor had a great number to choose from. Ultimately, the most important imitative dances (toatli) derived from the supernatural experience of an ancestor, his encounter with the imitated spirit. Other dances might have been improvised on the spot, or inspired by dreams. Forest-spirit dances of various types were among the most valued imitative dances (see Drucker 1951: 396-416; Sapir and Swadesh 1955; 89-125; Curtis 1916:84-96). Anthropomorphic forest spirits of the Tlokwalle ritual were divided into two basic types, although they had a number of different names. The first was a supernatural being who lived in the mountains but frequented the forest; his encounters with men were dangerous, but resulted in a transfer of spirit power. The second was formerly a human being who became wild while lost in the woods and suffering from exposure. Important differences existed between these two types. The "former humans," called puqmis (Sapir and Swadesh 1955:252) were thoroughly malevolent beings who lived in the forest. They strived to increase their numbers by drawing men astray in the woods with mysterious hoots or flickering lights glimpsed between</page><page sequence="2">96 RES 1 SPRING 81 Figure 1.

A puqmis could be captured, with difficulty, returned to the village, and cured (Sapir and Swadesh 1939:70). They were less "supernatural beings" and more "ghosts," the empty shells of men who had lost their social and spiritual souls. They became monsters with ugly appearance and harmful intentions. They could offer no spirit power. As a Tlokwalle prerogative, the puqmis dance was not a high-status performance and could be danced by anyone who had learned the proper steps (Ernst 1952:71). The "cedar bark ogre" called Almeqho, among other names, firmly belongs to the spirit world (Sapir and Swadesh 1939:103). Encounters with man were infrequent and dreaded, although the experience resulted in a transfer of spirit power. The right to pre sent the Almeqho masquerade derived from such a meeting in the sponsor's ancestral past (Sapir and Swadesh 1939:103). During the ceremony, Almeqho skulked up and down the beach in front of the village; he did not enter the dance house (Sapir and Swadesh 1955:103). If he tried, the people sang, "back out! back out Almeqho!" (Boas 1897:634). He rampaged about the village destroying property. To look him full in the face meant death. (Sapir and Swadesh 1955:103). Eventually, when the correct songs were sung and rituals performed, Almeqho returned to his home deep in the mountains. In contrast to puqmis, the Almeqho performance was considered dangerous and, consequently, its dance was highly esteemed as a demonstration of the sponsor's power and status (Ernst 1952:71). The concepts of puqmis and Almeqho complemented one another. The puqmis was a human who partially entered the supernatural world?by way of the forest. Almeqho was a supernatural who offered some of his power to the human world?again by way of the forest. Neither could cross permanently and successfully from one realm to the other. Almeqho entered the village periphery, but not the dance house, and eventually returned to his mountain home. The puqmis remained in the forest, never achieved full status as a supernatural, but eventually might be brought back and cured in the dance house. The human, when entering the forest, was aware of two possible consequences: that he would encounter a supernatural being, and, if he was spiritually prepared, he would return to the village strengthened with supernatural power?or that he would behave carelessly, be led astray by a puqmis, and lose his human identity. The appearance of these complementary forms in the Tlokwalle ceremonial clearly expressed Nootkan attitudes about human relations with the spirit world and the role of the forest as an intermediary zone for potential interaction, either harmful or beneficial, between man and the supernatural. Although in general terms this paradigm of Nootka cosmological thinking holds true for much of the West Coast, close examination of detail within the perspective of the individual village or regional subdivision reveals a great number of permutations. The terms Almeqho and puqmis, used here for conve nience to label notions, might change from one regional context to another. Attributes of either class of beings might not have been as clearly articulated in some other regions as the above-described model forms, which occur in the Alberni area. Some local expressions of the forest spirit took an intermediate stance between these two kinds. Finally, and most important for the discussion here, the masks created to impersonate forest spirits accepted a great range of variability, and each variation had its own set of ideological associations. These complexities, however, form some interesting patterns, especially when considered within the context of the greater, southern Northwest Coast. Almeqho, the cedar bark ogre, mentioned as a Tlokwalle prerogative of the Central Nootka Clayoquat and Alberni Canal groups, was visualized with an extraordinarily distinctive and powerful mask form. One of the finest masks of this type is an undocumented piece at the Brooklyn Museum (fig. 1). The mask depicts a long, humanoid face with a high, angled brow, recessed eyes, a hooked nose, and a protruding, cylindrical mouth. On the cheeks, crescentic markings carved in relief sweep away from the nose on either side of the face. All of these features are generally consistent with other masks of this type from the Central Nootka. White markings range around the perimeter as a kind of framing band, highlight some of the cheek crescents, and lighten the interior of the mouth and the underside of the nose. Other masks of this type suggest the significance of white markings. A similar mask at the National Museum of Natural History (fig. 2) and another at the Field Museum of Natural History are painted entirely white. Informants explained that this was so because the spirit had a white face (Sapir and Swadesh 1955:103). Masks identified as Qwabukwath, the stylistically similar Almeqho analog among the Makah, have white facial painting as well</page><page sequence="4">98 RES 1 SPRING 81 Figure 2. Mask, collected by James G. Swan at Barclay Sound, c.1880; Smithsonian Institution 30209 (Penney photo). Ref: Dall 1882:115, figures 33,34. (fig. 10). The Clayoquat, according to Curtis (1916:92), called their forest-spirit masquerade haiyahlin, the "white forest spirit." White facial painting characterized Almeqho and his immediate analogs as well as this formal category of masks. The faces of Central Nootkan Almeqho masks are narrow, as a whole, and sharply angled along the vertical meridian. The result emphasizes the profile over the full face. Informants explained again that to look Almeqho square in the face meant death: the masks reflect the need to look at him from the side. The frontal view is dangerous becaue powerful medicine runs from either side of the nose (Sapir and Swadesh 1955:103). The cheek crescents running from the nose might very well represent this medicine. Several features of white-faced Almeqho masks of the Nootka compare in significant ways to certain masks of the neighboring Southern Kwakiutl. The mask as a whole, with its deep-set eyes and cylindrical mouth, immediately suggests the Southern Kwakiutl Ts'onoqoa mask (fig. 4). Although Almeqho and Ts'onoqoa are both powerful and fearsome forest spirits and would appear to be quite similar, there are important differences between them. Ts'onoqoa is female, Almeqho male; she is a cannibal, he the "destroyer"; her dance is slow and somnambulate, his frantically active; her face is wide, flat, with full frontal emphasis, his is narrow, angled, and stresses the profile. She is black, he is white (see Boas 1897:479 for Ts'onoqoa). The characterizing behavior of Almeqho as the "destroyer" of property, on the other hand, corresponds to the ceremonial action of another Southern Kwakiutl masquerade, the Fool Dancer, nuhlmal. Nuhlmal are forest spirits of a sort; they are said to dwell on an island floating in a lake far in the interior (Boas 1897:468). The nuhlmal mask includes cheek markings Figure 3.

Kwakiutl mask, "Ts'onoqoa, the Cannibal Woman," history unknown; Courtesy of The Brooklyn Museum 05.276. similar to Almeqho's crescents (fig. 3), and these represent mucus that runs habitually from the nuhlmal's nose. Mucus is the substance of the nuhlmal's power; he throws it at those he wishes to inspire (Boas 1966:183). Ameqho's "medicine" also runs from his nose, although to see it in its entirety?both sides at once?is too dangerous for man. This brings up the question of their relative status. The Southern Kwakiutl nuhlmal is a beginner's dance, the initial dance society membership for ranking young children (Curtis 1915:159). Almeqho, on the other hand, is a prestigious and mature presentation. White-faced, cheek-marked Almeqho masks appear to be confined to the Central Nootka, mainly the Clayoquat. Three masks collected late in the eight eenth century (figs. 5 and 6), probably from the Moachat of Nootka Sound, a Northern Nootka group, suggest the ancestry of the white-mask type, but lead more directly to another branch of the family. These masks, two collected during Cook's voyages and another collected by the Spanish explorer Malaspina (G?nther 1972:224, Kaeppler 1978:259, Feder 1977:48), have deep-set eyes and the circular mouths of the white masks, but their color is graphite black. Instead of being tightly drawn against the sides of the face, the cheeks swell into large, smooth bloated jowls. They lack the angular narrowness of the white masks. This frontal orientation and their black color bring these masks in closer relation with the Kwakiutl Ts'onoqoa, except that her cheeks are sunken and concave. Bloated cheeks remain the dominant feature of nineteenth- and twentieth-centqry masks from the southern West Coast, especially the Ucluelet and Alberni groups, and appear sporadically elsewhere (figs. 7 and 8). Qwabukwath dancers of the Makah, to the south, resemble the Nootka Almeqho in both appearance and behavior. Swan provided a particularly vivid description of their entrance into the dance house (Swan 1870:71): Another party then came in, composed of men with frightful masks, bearskins on their backs and heads all covered with down. They had clubs in their hands, and as they danced around a big fire blazing in the center of the Figure 5. Mask, collected by Capt. James Cook at Nootka Sound, 1778; Berne Historical Museum, Ethnography Depart ment A1-13. Ref: G?nther 1972, figure 50.</page><page sequence="6">100 RES 1 SPRING 81 lodge, they struck wildly with them, caring little whom or what they hit. Differences with Almeqho lie in the fact that Qwabukwath may enter the dance house and appear in a group, unlike the solitary Almeqho (Sapir 1911:26). They also carry clubs like the Kwakiutl nuhlmal, the Fool Dancer (Boas 1897:468). Some Qwabukwath masks, however, compare quite closely with those types already reviewed (fig. 10). They have the distinctive cylindrical mouth, recessed eyes, angled brow, even some white facial painting, but no cheek markings nor appreciable bulge. Qwabukwath then offers yet another stylistic variant on the theme of the cylindrical-mouth, forest-spirit mask. Cylindrical-mouth masks of the Nootka, Southern Kwakiutl, and Makah are all associated with a single referent: an anthropomorphic forest spirit with significant power. However, certain plastic attributes, ideological associations, and characterizing modes of behavior vary with surprising regularity. There is general agreement about the function, overall concept, and configuration of the mask, but some elements become transformed from one interpretation to another. The differences between these variants seem to be geographically specific. One may be tempted to explain this with the familiar idea that local art styles prevail over extensively diffused concepts. Local art traditions certainly have a bearing on the range of variation, but other agents of the problem need exploring. Most provocative is the contrast between the white-faced Almeqho and the Ts'onoqoa of the Kwakiutl. Each one of these mask forms, and even their performance characterization, seems to be defined, reciprocally, by what another is not. Strong analogies to the Kwakiutl nuhlmal are also perplexing. Arbitrary stylistic elaboration does not account for such a complex and rather systematic interplay of attributes. As will be shown presently, there are several other components of this configuration to be considered. Let us turn to the "other Wildman," as it was called by Ernst (1952:16), the puqmis, the functional complement of Almeqho. The puqmis dance frequently accompanies Almeqho in Tlokwalle performances, although often there is no mask (Ernst 1952:70; Sapir and Swadesh 1955:252). Where puqmis masks are evidenced, however, they seem to fall into the white face category. Edward S. Curtis described a Moachat imitative dance called Hohosmnimuts that he mistakenly assumed to be a representation of the spirit of echoes. Approximately forty dancers, wearing masks with "long, cylindrical mouths," stormed the village Figure 6. Mask, collected by Alejendro Malaspina at Nootka Sound, 1791; Museo de America, Madrid 3309. Ref: Feder 1977:48, figure 12. and dragged the visitors out into the woods. Thereupon they proceeded to befuddle them with hoots and shouts until the visitors were thoroughly lost (Curtis 1916:86). This clearly corresponds to the characterization of puqmis, although under a different name. A "cylindrical-mouth mask" would seem to resemble the type just discussed. Museum collections unfortunately do not adequately resolve the question. I have encountered no mask documented as puqmis. The best candidate for this identification, however, is a little-known but striking piece collected by James G. Swan from the Makah at Neah Bay (fig. 9). An old tag labels the piece as a "ghost." Some literature has inaccurately identified white Almeqho masks as "corpses" or "death's heads" due to the desiccated appearance of the features (DalI 1882:115; and subsequently Wardwell 1964, no. 22), but here "ghost" may refer to the ghost of an individual lost in the woods, a puqmis. The masks share several features of the Central Nootkan white-faced masks, having white skin, sunken, disk-shaped eyes, and some understated markings on the cheeks. Unlike the white</page><page sequence="7">Penney: The Nootka "Wild Man" masquerade and the Forest Spirit tradition 101 Figure 7. Mask, collected by George T.

According to informants, the face of puqmis is also white due to the effects of exposure; dancers without masks would apply white facial paint (Drucker 1951:153; Ernst 1952:70). Makah carvings of the supernatural forest spirit, Qwabukwath, look far more forceful and aggressive, and lack cheek markings, although they similarly include white face paint in some instances. Within the context of the Makah, cheek markings apparently are not associated with the forest spirit's "medicine," as they are among the Central groups. Expressive contrasts, if not plastic ones, may help differentiate puqmis from the supernatural forest spirit. Aggression contrasted with timidity, forcefulness opposed to withdrawal, even large compared to small, all characterize the differences between Almeqho/Qwabukwath and puqmis conceptualizations. Perhaps the masks' features reflect these personality attributes as well. The term puqmis can be equated with bookwus, the name for the Kwakiutl forest spirit, the "man of the ground" or wild man (Mochon 1966:72). Bookwus are not ghosts, but anthropomorphic beings without significant powers who live in the woods. Their lack of spirit power, their home in the forest and not the mountains, the fact that they appear as part of the Kwakiutl dluwulaxa, or lesser ceremonial, and that their performance is not especially prestigious, all compare with puqmis, save that bookwus are believed to be a nonhuman race, not transformed men. The Northern Kwakiutl call bookwus "cockle hunters" because they frequent the beaches in search of food. During a performance of this dance, the masquerader pantomimed their characteristic behavior when he dug in the dance-house floor with large, wooden claws (Olson 1954:248). Similarly, the Nootka puqmis is supposed to have long fingernails "like icicles" (Drucker 1951:153). Figure 9. Mask, collected by James G. Swan at Neah Bay (Makah), prior to 1868; Smithsonian Institution 4119 (Penney photo). Ref: Swan 1869:69, figure 36; Dall 1882:116, figure 35.</page><page sequence="9">Penney: The Nootka "Wild Man" masquerade and the Forest Spirit tradition 103 The face of bookwus is represented by a unique type of Kwakiutl mask. His special attributes include short, animal ears, a long, hooked nose, and clenched teeth. Like the Nootkan Almeqho, the bookwus mask requires a topknot and often suggestions of cheek markings echo the line of the snarling upper lip (fig. 11). In at least one example a Kwakiutl bookwus mask closely approximates the Central Nootkan, white-faced Almeqho type (fig. 12). Bookwus then, as a foreign analog of the forest-spirit concept, bears formal and functional resemblances to both Almeqho and puqmis, even though it is equated with neither. Although cylindrical-mouth masks appear firmly as sociated with the Nootka forest-spirit conceptualiza tions, masks with entirely different sets of features repre sent the same or parallel ideas. One of the most familiar of Nootka mask types depicts a red-faced spirit. A red forest spirit corresponds to the anthropomorphic, supernatural beings called tcinyath, who have red skins, long, stringy black hair, "sharp" features, and run in packs (Drucker 1951:394). Masked impersonations of tcinyath appeared as imitative dances among several of the Northern and Central groups and ran with spirit wolf packs among the Moachat and Alberni groups at least (Drucker 1951:393; Sapir and Swadesh 1939:143). Ubiquitous red forest-spirit masks in mu seum collections, in varying styles, suggest that the theme was widespread. They often appeared in pairs, unlike the solitary Almeqho. The masks (fig. 13), al though made fierce by the unkempt hair and snaring mouth, look markedly more humanlike than do white forest-spirit masks. Their anthropomorphic appearance seems to reflect an ambivalent status as supernaturals. Encounters with tcinyath did not result in a transfer of spirit power, but merely posed the threat of physical danger due to their proclivity to club or stab people with their staffs and spears, and entitled one to present their masquerade. This lack of spirit power seems to de note an intermediary status for the spirit, somewhere between the complementary polarities of puqmis and Almeqho. Not all red forest-spirit masks sit comfortably with this modest role, however. A large red-faced mask, nearly twice life-size, includes all the usual red-spirit features, such as shaggy hair and grimacing expression, but the remarkable forcefulness and the specific emphasis of its sculptural traits demand reconsideraton of its identity (fig. 14). Like white forest-spirit masks, the face is narrowed, sharply angled, stressing the profile. This suggets Almeqho, the spirit who must be seen from the aside. The nose of the mask thrusts forward as the ; %*&amp;- /. ? ? .- JBl .- %..,'-*. " . -a .^BS^wSBESIi ' ^* * JET ^^^^^^H v'-s5?? -?y Figure 10.

Although collected by Swan, the mask has no documented provenance, but the style suggets an origin among the Southern Nootka groups, such as the Nitinat or Alberni. The mask appears to blend attributes that are stated separately further north, among the Central Nootka, and probably reflects a mixture of concepts as well. The white and red mask forms serve as Nootkan conceptual modes, but the categories are not inviolate. Interestingly enough, the red-faced mask forms of the Nootka relate to those of the Kwakiutl bookwus, the cockle hunter or wild man (fig. 11). The fiercesome, toothy snarl, stringy hair, and especially the large, hooked nose of the Swan piece all compare with the standard bookwus features, except that none of the Nootka masks have animal ears. Tcinyath, the relatively powerless forest dwellers, also approximate the status and situation of bookwus: their functional categories seem quite similar.</page><page sequence="10">3</page><page sequence="11">Penney: The Nootka "Wild Man" masquerade and the Forest Spirit tradition 105 Yet another formulation of the Nootkan forest spirit takes the form of a black, humanoid mask with a new set of features and associations. The style seems linked to the Quileute expression of the forest spirit as visualized in several masks extant in museum collections (fig. 15). The Quileute are a Chemakum speaking neighbor of the Makah to the south. The primary features of their masks include a large, angled brow, short nose, small, deep-set eyes, broad, padded cheeks, and a parted mouth. Their color is deep black with no facial painting. In classic examples, the masks look distinctly ape-like. The masks appear in the Quileute version of the Makah Tlokwalle ceremonial known generically as "black tomanawus" (tomanawus in Chinook jargon means "guardian spirit"). The dominant color of the ceremony is black as expressed in the black face paint of initiated society members and the black face and skin of the presiding spirit (Frachtenberg 1921:329). Although more Nootka-ized versions of the Quileute ceremonial included spirit wolves, good evidence indicates that the society members impersonating initiatory spirits wore these round, anthropomorphic masks (Pettit 1950:15). Due to sketchiness in the enthnographies of this area, it is not clear what the Quileute masks were supposed to represent, although within the context of the Tlokwalle ceremonial they functioned much the same as forest-spirit masks of the Nootka and Makah. The orientation of Salish Winter Ceremonials, even when based on Nootka or Kwakiutl models, emphasized personal guardian spirits over the inherited rights to chiefly prerogatives. Ronald Olson provided several details about an extremely common Quinault guardian spirit called skuku'm?so common that most old people were reputed to have had a relationship with one. Skuku'm were "devils of the forest" who lived in the high hills and mountains. Informants described them as "long, black and tall, with a human face" (Olson 1936:146). Since they lived in the mountains, but were encountered in the woods, they parallel the Nootka Almeqho, the "white forest spirit." Comparable reporting to Olson's on the Quinault is not available for Figure 11. Kwakiutl mask, "wild man," collected by Charles F. Newcombe; Provincial Museum of B. C, Victoria. Ref: Harner and Elsasser 1965:18. Figure 13. Nootka mask, ex-Fred Harvey collection, ace. 1918; Courtesy of Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation, N.Y. 8/1644. - Figure 12.

Ref: Feder 1971, figure 182. i '</page><page sequence="12">106 RES 1 SPRING 81 the Quileute or neighboring Salish groups, so there is no telling how widespread is this concept. The human features, deep black color, and forest-spirit association of the Quileute masks, however, appear to reflect just this kind of local interpretation of the forest-spirit form. The Quileute masks compare stylistically with certain Makah interpretations of Qwabukwath (fig. 16), and even an occasional humanoid mask from the Central or Northern Nootka. The jet black color, drooping, parted mouth, and padded cheeks agree with the Quileute conception of their forest spirit very well. Black Nootka and Makah masks also mix attributes and adopt a number of different forms which again suggest the flexibility of color symbolism and formal interpretation. One is especially reminded of the black circular-mouth masks collected late in the eighteenth century, with their bloated cheeks (figs. 5, 6). Figure 14. Mask, collected by James G. Swan at Nutka (sic), c.1880; Smithsonian Institution 30210 (Penney photo). Ref: Dall:117, figure 22. White, red, and black, these colors signify three primary conceptual modes for the plastic realization of the forest spirit's face. White, red, and black forest spirits of the Nootka appear under a variety of names and display a number of analogous and antithetical relationships between themselves and with similar concepts of their neighbors. What is to account for this range of diversity? A bewildering array of spirit identities from the Nootka and their neighbors has been evoked, their mask forms, ideological associations, and ceremonial behavior compared and contrasted. The result is a patchwork of relationships and differences, a constellation of identities with innumerable cross references. The focus has been the Nootka forest spirit, but it is now clear that the Nootka conceptualizations function as part of a much larger picture, a tradition of anthropomorphic forest-spirit masquerades with significance throughout the southern Northwest Coast. The linkages between these various expressions of the forest spirit, Nootka, Kwakiutl, and Quileute, do not seem to be the product of simple borrowing. The individual spirit identities appear far too developed and internally conherent for one to be dependent on another. All are uniquely adjusted to the local situation of mythic belief and ceremonial pattern. If this inquiry had taken the point of view of the Southern Kwakiutl, Ts'onoqoa, nuhlmal, and bookwus might be expected to display complementary functions and values that reflect specifically Kwakiutl concerns, just as Almeqho and puqmis as concepts help describe the Nootkan environment as cosmos. But even cross culturally, all of the forest-spirit concepts seem to more or less fulfill complementary roles; their relationships and differences do not appear to be arbitrary. This is especially true of the relationships between white Almeqho and black Ts'onoqoa. Their formal and functional reversals, described earlier, imply structural relationships not unlike those explored by Claude Levi Strauss. His book La Voie des Masques (1975) dealt with oppositional relationships between Ts'onoqoa and Coast Salish Xwaexwae masks, and demonstrated that his method for the analysis of mythology could be applied successfully to ritual sculpture. His book neglected, however, to deal substantially with Ts'onoqoa analogs among the Nootka and Salish, as described here. As with the case of Ts'onoqoa and Xwaexwae, Ts'onoqoa and Almeqho display certain formal and functional reversals, but these oppositions seem only partial and relatively weak. The overall</page><page sequence="13">Penney: The Nootka "Wild Man" masquerade and the Forest Spirit tradition 107 concepts expressed in the two masquerades remain almost as close, as the sum of substituted terms defines their differences. This is not surprising, considering that these masquerades were selected for study just because of their forest-spirit associations. What is surprising is that within this set there are indications of the emergence of structural contrasts reminiscent of those Levi-Strauss noted between the far more polarized concepts of Ts'onoqoa and Xwaexwae. Lesser or weaker reversals are also visible among other members of the forest-spirit set: the bulging cheeks of the black, Alberni Almeqho as contrasted with the concave cheeks of the similarly black Ts'onoqoa; the intermediary position of red as a color value between black and white, which parallels the intermediary functional status of tcinyath, the red forest spirit; the nonhuman/former human dichotomy of the Kwakiutl and Nootka cognates puqmis and bookwus; the black and white polarization of the Nootka Almeqho and Quileute skuku'm. It is apparent that oppositional and serial transformations of plastic form, myth, ritual, and ideology may occur in a wide range of qualitative and quantitative degrees, with reversals more or less pronounced depending on the distance between the related and compared notions. The interconnectedness between the different members of the forest-spirit masquerade tradition and their partially evidenced complementarity, both within a particular cultural framework and cross-culturally, seem to imply that all the forest-spirit expressions are but variations of some core concept. All of them represent the idea of a frightening, semi-human being encountered in the woods. Beyond this, they are specialized: some have powerful noses, some have misshapen mouths; they are black, white, or red; they offer power or lead men astray; they destroy, maim, kill, or devour. It has been shown that some of the spirit identities, harboring a combination of these special attributes, reveal structural relationships with the specializations of others, in widely different degrees. Such scaled distribution of implicated, complementary identities makes plausible the hypothesis that structural contrasts evolved gradually. The ethnographic record can be read as pointing to a historical and sociological process in which structural oppositions would become progressively sharper over time. In other words, the variants of the forest-spirit masquerade tradition grew apart through the development of more and more terms of contrast. On several occasions Levi-Strauss posited that structural relationships resulted from the transmission of a term, or a set of terms, across ethnographic boundaries (Levi-Strauss 1968, 1969, 1971), thus drawing together the processes of transmission and transformation. He did not, however, speculate in any detail about the historical or processual mechanisms that would effect these changes, and he only descriptively commented on the seemingly ubiquitous and countless intermediary steps between any polarized expressions, as there seem to be in our case. On the Northwest Coast, the transmission of mask forms may very well be the agent for their gradual change and elaboration. The historical movement of dance prerogatives between Nootkan subdivisions and out to their neighbors appears to have occurred much more swiftly than structural change. Masking rights were passed from one group to another through Figure 15.

Individual groups may have married with only a limited number of neighbors, but the Nootka as a whole constituted a chain of affinal relationships, undoubtedly with links to the Kwakiutl to the north and the Coast Salish to the south and east. Affinal ties provided the framework by and through which mask forms were transmitted. Masking prerogatives were personal possessions, related to similar prerogatives of rivals and neighbors, but still considered unique. Perhaps for this reason the owner may have wished to stress how his prerogative differed from the related ones of others. In the stressing of the differences, ever so slight, between a masquerade concept and its neighbor's analog, the process of structural oppositions may have been set in motion only to find full realization through many such redefinitions: over the generations and through geographic space, these would result in new forms, adjusted to the local context, but forever linked to the original configurations and to each intermediate step of their development. These linkages comprise structural relationships and would explain the patterned cross-referencing of the various forest-spirit expressions. What has been described is a cultural system of slight disequilibrium, where concepts never rest, where innovation never ceases, and where change persists as an inherent and inexorable necessity.
