<plain_text><page sequence="1">Greg Garrard Nature Cures? or How to Police Analogies of Personal and Ecological Health At the 2009 ASLE conference in Victoria, I was asked if there were any tropes I would consider adding to those analyzed in Ecocriticism (Routledge 2004; 2011 2nd ed.): pollution, wilderness, apocalypse, and so on. I couldn't think of a decent answer at the time, but since then I've realized that there is an ubiquitous, vitally important master metaphor that suffuses discourses of the environment, which is of interest in that it forms a rhetorical bridge between the individual human subject and the ecological web or, as Timothy Morton would have it, "mesh" in which we live ensnared. From assessments of indi- vidual ecosystems to representations of the whole Earth, the meta- phor of health provides us with a readily understood, emotive way to comprehend matters of stunning complexity such as climate change, biodiversity, and ecological resilience. Since, moreover, life writing is so often about illness and death- au topathography as Thomas Couser puts it- health provides a superficially uncomplicated way to link the destiny of the writing subject and her personal relations to that of the environment besieged by modernity. As ecocriticism itself has long been moved by the autobiographical impulse, giving rise to nar- rative scholarship , it makes sense that health has also featured there strongly, and in an appropriately critical and self-conscious fashion. This study examines three very different examples of environmental autopathography.

So, for instance, to Frederick Clements, the "climax ecosystem" was considered the homeostatic end-point of a predictable process of eco- logical succession, but his theory foundered on the difficulty of iden- tifying stable climax ecosystems at any geographical or temporal scale. As Daniel Botkin says of classical ecology: "Although environ- mentalism seemed to be a radical movement, the ideas on which it was based represented a resurgence of pre-scientific myths about nature blended with early-twentieth-century studies that provided short-term and static images of nature undisturbed" (42-43). In prac- tice, such ecological "health" seemed an elusive ideal; in studies of the uninhabited Isle Royale in Lake Superior, Botkin says, vegetation was in a process of continual change, with no apparent end-point of unchanging stability. He concludes that "nature undisturbed is not constant in form, structure or proportion, but changes at every scale of time and space" (62). In a more recent assessment, John Kricher has argued that "The balance of nature paradigm is of little value within evolution and ecology. It has never been clearly defined and is basically misleading. But the balance of nature is esthetically satisfy- ing, a fact that is largely responsible for its continued vigor through the ages" (23). But it is more than merely an attractive idea: the balance of nature seems to vindicate the morality of environmental- ism. Thus, environmental philosopher Holmes Rolston III enthusiasti- cally espouses a sophisticated version of the naturalistic fallacy David Hume rejected: What is ethically puzzling and exciting is that an ought is not so much derived from an is as discovered simulta- neously with it. As we progress from descriptions of fauna and flora, of cycles and pyramids, of autotrophs co-ordinated with heterotrophs, of stability and dyna- mism, on to intricacy, planetary opulence and interde- pendence, to unity and harmony with oppositions in counterpoint and synthesis, organisms evolved within and satisfactorily fitting their communities, arriving at length at beauty and goodness, it is difficult to say where the natural facts leave off and where the natural values appear. For some at least, the sharp is/ought dichotomy is gone; the values seem to be there as soon</page><page sequence="3">496 isle as the facts are fully in, and both alike properties of the system. (145) Now that the encounter of ecocriticism with the antinaturalizing ten- dencies of queer theory is well underway, though, the natural facts are liable to look as if they were elicited by the values of the very subject he pictures climbing from quotidian natural history to the sublimity of art, not fortuitously discovered alongside them. Even if the allergy of cultural theory to naturalistic ethics were treated somehow, the unavailability of a simple model of healthy ecological balance would in any case render it moot. Homeostatic conceptions of both environmental and human health have proven less defensible than the idea of oscillations within certain parameters, which allows for dynamism and continual change- what one might call a "homeorhetic" approach. Perhaps the best example of environmental homeorhesis,2 where the metaphor of health has been deployed from the outset, is highlighted by the ecolo- gist and philosopher Sahotra Sarkar: "The analogy between conserva- tion biology and medicine is deep and generally recognized" ("Defining 'Biodiversity'" 2). Yet the analogy suggests, if anything, how challenging it is likely to be to define "health," since biodiver- sity, besides the riot of interpretations that pursues the word, is noto- riously difficult to measure with an unambiguous metric. Ecosystemic health, in the sense of biodiversity, can mean genetic diversity, species diversity (which can mean numerical species count, or character variety- and can be measured according to three differ- ent spatial systems), taxonic diversity, or ecosystemic variety. Some of these measures are likely to align with each other; others conflict. Because, as Sarkar observes, "conservation biology is a goal-oriented enterprise that embraces a social goal, namely, the protection of habi- tats and species, the concept of biodiversity has a normative compo- nent besides a purely scientific or descriptive one" ("Norms" 627-28). In that respect, it is just the same as personal health: it involves a degree of more or less submerged normativity, which at once helps give it moral and emotional force and renders it vulnerable to skepti- cal critique. For David Takacs, the imbrication of biological observa- tions and normative judgments is neither avoidable nor especially unwelcome: "The complexity of biodiversity does not only mirror the natural world it supposedly represents; it is that plus the complexity of human interactions with the natural world, the inextricable skein of our values and its value, of our inability to separate our concept of a thing from the thing itself. Don't know what biodiversity is? You can't" (341). For similar reasons, while we are all too aware when our</page><page sequence="4">Narratives of Personal and Ecological Health 497 health deserts us, we can't know, positively, what it is, since it is like- wise an entanglement of physiological fact and cultural value. And in the case of both ecological and personal health, the values involved are not considered ideologically innocent- a point to which I will return. Metaphors and analogies are not only inevitable but necessary parts of environmental rhetoric, and should perhaps be assessed for their moral efficacy rather than their accuracy, coherence, or concep- tual purity. However, the risk is that, as Dana Phillips says, "Any sci- entific hypothesis that conceals an analogy tends to devolve into a metaphor and wind up as a myth," which is what may have happened to the popular idea of biodiversity as a synecdoche for ecological health (58; cf. 76). So my choice of three texts on the metaphoric rela- tion between personal and ecological health casts it quite deliberately in a shifting, uncertain light: Nature Cure, by Britain's best-known nature writer Richard Mabey, for its reactionary ingenuousness; an essay by Catriona Sandilands, "Eco Homo: Queering the Ecological Body Politic," for its generative skepticism; and Sandra Steingraber's Living Downstream , for its remarkable combination of scientific and emotional intensity. My concern is that ecocriticism may be at some- thing of a crisis point, if that is not too melodramatic a way to put it. Not because of institutionalization and professionalization, nor because of the incursion of Theory, but because the growing nature- skepticism of the field, which in some respects represents increased sci- entific and philosophical sophistication, risks subverting its ethical and pedagogical raison d'etre. I enact this quandary by first critiquing Mabey's cheerfully naturalizing metaphors and then, conversely, the potentially enervating subversiveness of Sandilands's attack on what she calls environmental gouernmentality, a discourse of bodily and ecological health that she considers oppressive. I go on to test Sandilands's theory against Steingraber's energetic environmentalist reassertion of the very contrast of purity and pollution queer ecology invites us to query. Nature Cure Much as ecologists measure biodiversity by nominating "indica- tor" or "keystone" species, nature writers too tend to have a totemie species that simultaneously estimates ecological health for them and varies in loose correlation with their own psychological or physical health. The difference is that, while ecological indicator species tend to be chosen partly for cultural and political reasons, the fluctuations in their populations can at least be shown observationally to correlate</page><page sequence="5">498 isle with other measures of ecosystemic health, whereas the totemie species is chosen, observed, and treasured according to a much more ancient and elemental logic: what we might call the doctrine of corre- spondences. For Richard Mabey, it is the fate of the hirondelles- the martins and the swallow, and the swift that appears similar to them but is not closely related- that is an emotional barometer for him as he plunges into a deep, sustained, and largely unprovoked period of depression. As the plummeting mood first begins to take hold, he rescues a fledgling swift, marveling at the thought that it will remain on the wing for two years before touching solid ground again, but long before that time is up, he himself has lost touch with the earth still more profoundly: "While they were en fÃªte [over England] I was lying on my bed with my face away from the window, not really caring if I saw them again or not. In a strange and ironic turn-about, I had become the incomprehensible creature adrift in some insubstan- tial medium, out of kilter with the rest of creation. It didn't occur to me at the time, but maybe that is the way our whole species is moving" (3-4). Not to care about the health of hirondelles, and the health of the world that sustains them, is a symptom of his self-abandonment; his dreadful and deepening human isolation is coextensive with his disconnection from the intercontinental aerial ecosystems the swifts traverse, and of course it symbolizes, too, the broader human alienation his writing sets out to reverse. For Mabey, it is not only that specific metaphors evoke and rein- force our ecological embeddedness. Metaphoricity itself also has meaning: "It is as if in using the facility of language, the thing we believe most separates us from nature, we are constantly pulled back to its, and our, origins. In that sense all natural metaphors are minia- ture creation myths, allusions to how things came to be, and a confir- mation of the unity of life" (20). We speak of our own health and that of the environment naturally, he thinks, because the conditions for both are in some fundamental sense the same.3 However, his depres- sion at first puzzles his doctrine of correspondences, in that it seems so biologically pointless compared with other diseases: "It seems to have no connection with the biological business of living at all. And what it did to me was unearthly, in that it negated, cut dead, all the things in which I most believed: the importance of sensual engage- ment with the world, the link between feeling and intelligence, the inseparability of nature and culture" (50). But later he is able to account for it by analogy with the hedgehog curled into a ball, the barn owl fainting under stress- what Oliver Sacks calls "vegetative retreat." Says Mabey, "It's an entirely sensible response by any crea- ture to a threat that stumps it, a kind of ur-depression" (55). Its most</page><page sequence="6">Narratives of Personal and Ecological Health 499 catastrophic effect, for him, is that, as he literally loses the will to live, he stops writing. Thereafter, the story that he says and thinks he goes on to tell about it is much the same as those surveyed by Mark Allister in Refiguring the Book of Sorrow : "absorption into other worlds [than the purely human], and the subsequent writing about it, helps the writer move through mourning, renewed and ready for a differ- ent life" (13). He is treated conventionally with antidepressants and with psy- chotherapy, but they seem not to work. Yet if the title of the book sug- gests that it is nature that cures him, that too is not quite right insofar as the story he tells coheres imperfectly with his authorial commen- tary on it. What is cause and what is effect is impossible to disentan- gle in any case- even, or especially, one's own case- but the key "interventions," as health professionals would say, seem to be psychi- atric care, the loyalty of friends, and falling in love. He concludes: "My friends, the sea, the hard work, that symbolically comforting beech [under which he starts to write again], and above all [his new girlfriend] Poppy's care, had broken the grip of my illness. But it was regaining that imaginative relationship with the world beyond that was my 'nature cure'" (64). Yet according to his own narration, it is a cure that seems follow and mark his recovery, rather than preceding and stimulating it. The reason for this odd disjunction may be that Mabey prefers the evidence of his intuitive doctrine of correspondence to the mere mechanical causation he associates with scientific evidence (and, by extension, psychotropic drugs), consistently contrasting the coopera- tive geniality and creativity he feels he shares with the natural world with the reductive "naming of parts and simplistic models of cause and effect" (173) he imagines scientists are hampered by. Not, of course, that he spurns biologists' understanding of personal and eco- logical health altogether- he takes advantage of the antidepressant pills and other medical interventions, and cites the evidence of biolo- gists at times- but portrays himself, by dint of his larger sympathies, as party to deeper insights than they, with their professional agnosti- cism and commitment to systematic investigation. Take the fen ecosystem as an example. Darwinism is founded, Mabey thinks, on the idea of a struggle for existence (memorably dis- missed by Nietzsche as the result of "breathing the foul air of English overcrowding"), a principle taken to a still more upsetting extreme with "selfish-gene theory," but that is not at all what he sees when he looks- and we really mean looks , nothing more- at a thriving fen, where no single species predominates. Instead of a vicious botanical war of all against all, Mabey represents it more as an English village</page><page sequence="7">500 ISLE fÃªte, with different types rubbing along side-by-side enjoying each others' eccentricities. Rather than some master race emerging (the logical consequence of "crude Darwinism," he supposes), "The natural long-term tendency of any ecosystem is to become progres- sively more plural, complex, sociable" (185). Indeed, he wonders whether some of the plants might not make the soil chemistry more congenial for their neighbors- the meadowsweet, perhaps, since it secretes salicin that, reformulated as aspirin, has proven of great benefit to people. An interesting speculation, to be sure, but does it , in fact? Mabey provides no answer, of course, as that would take a sub- stantial research project- tedious "cause and effect" stuff- not just standing and looking. In fact, John Kricher's The Balance of Nature shows that Mabey's holistier-than-thou4 wishful thinking had already been disproven by ecologists studying plant associations in the middle of the twentieth century, at which time Clements's defense of the balance of nature, epitomized by "climax ecosystems," was opposed by individualistic ecologists such as Henry Gleason and Robert Whittaker. For Clements, plants formed real "supra-organismic" communities, in which populations of given species were determined by rules of asso- ciation and competition. Gleason and Whittaker, however, demon- strated that community composition depended on "physiological tolerances in relation to the local conditions as well as stochastic factors pertaining to such life cycle characteristics as dispersal" (71). When Whittaker plotted species abundances against particular "gra- dients," such as soil pH or moisture, the bell curves for each of them varied independently of the others. As Kricher observes, "There were no patterns that suggested clear segregation between assemblages of species, as would be the case if competitors excluded one another or if groups of species were coevolved to remain together" (72). Unless British fen ecosystems operate according to quite different ecological principles, Mabey's jolly botanical community is merely fictional. So here's the rub: if the health metaphor in general seems, on close inspection, worryingly fissile and full of undisclosed normativ- ity, the version employed in Nature Cure depends upon a doctrine of correspondence that is literally medieval (probably primeval). For example, Mabey first rejects, rightly, the critique of taxonomie nota- tion that sees it, in John Fowles's memorable metaphor, as a "pane of dirty glass" between the observer and the observed (148), but then goes on to suggest that Linnaean taxonomy is "no more true or 'natural' than . . . vernacular dumpings" (150) that distinguish tall and short plants, say, or edible from nonedib.le ones, or ones with and without supposed medicinal effects. Where taxonomy divides</page><page sequence="8">Narratives of Personal and Ecological Health 501 and rules, he thinks, natural metaphoricity expresses a deeper truth: "At its heart is the idea of analogy, the ecological, if 'un-scientific/ belief that the different layers of life are not only connected, but in some way physical reflections- metaphors, if you like- of each other. Exterior likenesses are clues to inner processes and likely resonances" (175-76). Leaving aside the bemusing idea that something could be "ecological" and "un-scientific" at the same time, Mabey's claim is utterly untrue. For instance, whereas popular taxonomy identifies Old and New World vultures as pretty much the same sort of thing thanks to their striking visual and behavioral similarities, cladistic analysis based on "careful examination of anatomy, morphology and biochemistry" and, more recently, backed up by studies of mitochon- drial DNA, shows that "vultures must represent a phylogenetically in-homogenous . . . group, whose shared characteristics are based on convergence" (Wink 868). The scrawny neck and ferocious digestive tract of Old and New World vultures are analogous, not homologous characteristics, and it would be insulting to suggest this hard-won insight is "no more true" than popular intuitions. Moreover, Mabey's mental health may well depend upon the return of the hirondelles from their migration each year- as a lover of martins I can identify with that- but their survival is unlikely to depend upon his. A final example: one of the loveliest plants to grace an English spring is "lungwort," so-called because its spotted leaves made it look like a diseased lung. It therefore seemed a promising medicine for chest problems, a hope reflected too in its Latin name pulmonaria . The trouble is that it doesn't work . Aside from a trivial visual correspond- ence, there is no relationship whatsoever between spots on leaves and spots on lungs. Analogy turns to metaphor turns to myth- only in Mabey's case, the myth is the meaning of analogy itself. Of course, human health is in myriad ways dependent upon eco- logical health (and sometimes perhaps even vice versa, though it's hard to see how). But, like the biochemical interaction, competitive or cozy, of the roots of fen plants, you will never know just by looking and imagining. Science is at once the brilliant efflorescence of the normal human propensity to find patterns in nature, and an organ- ized admission- in the very systematic impersonality and caution Mabey dismisses- that we are, to put it politely, prone to error when we do so. Indeed, there is a great deal of psychological research that has demonstrated both the astonishing capabilities and the embar- rassing cognitive biases and lacunae of our species. If "material ecoc- riticism" is to be more than a mere pleonasm, comparable to "fast Honda Fireblade," the qualifier needs to recall that, far from conven- iently aligning with our discursive constructs (conservative or</page><page sequence="9">502 ISLE radical), ecology is something we are constituted to be likely to be wrong about most of the time? As for Mabey, Phillips's stricture applies all too precisely to him: "Most contemporary nature writing ... is too selfish , by which I mean that it is too preoccupied with the self as the formative and essential element of experience, and overly concerned with the self, not as an ethically responsible entity and a citizen of the world, but as the locus for what passes for spiritual life in a secular culture" (195). The evidence of Nature Cure indicates how hard it is for life writing to be, at the same time, valuably and significantly ecological. "Eco Homo" Life writing, embedded in narrative scholarship, can lend itself equally to radically Â¿/naturalistic projects. Drawing, like Timothy Luke's Ecocritique, upon Michel Foucault's analysis of disciplinary "biopower," Catriona Sandilands's essay "Eco Homo: Queering the Ecological Body Politic" develops a powerful critique of the way that the knowledge regimes of "environmental governmentality" organize the lives- and bodies- of citizens. Guiltily interrogating ourselves for our environmental sins, sensing the panoptic gaze of ecological surveillance on our backs when we board a plane or fail to recycle a bottle, we internalize the disciplines required of us by planetary health: "Entangled in . . . webs of disciplinary and pastoral power . . . the ecologically docile body of modern environmentalism reduces, reuses, and recycles as acts of personal, not only planetary, salvation" (20). Sandilands argues that, far from constituting the challenge to the dominant order that environmentalists hope it is, environmental gov- ernmentality "signals little more than a slightly greener shade of cap- italist accumulation" (19). The long shadow of Marxist revolutionary thought, in which every kind of reform is depicted as mere window- dressing designed to erode the appetite for real change, falls over claims of this kind. But according to Sandilands, the discourse of ecological health affects more than just peripheral behaviors; it mandates, too, a powerfully coercive (and pleasurable) set of bodily regimes of purification: . . . this ecological subject finds particular pleasure in the cultivation of a particular kind of disciplined body, specifically, a "natural" body striving to be "free" of the corrupting toxins that increasingly plague the world. In this process, the subject willingly and happily submits</page><page sequence="10">Narratives of Personal and Ecological Health 503 to an increasingly abstract and rarefied understanding of environmental degradation, an increasingly codified discourse of environmental health, and an increasingly intricate and intrusive code of ecological behaviors. (21) Insofar as personal health and its ecological analogue mutually con- stitute and reinforce each other, what Sandilands calls "skin vigi- lance" polices the body's worryingly porous boundaries. An apparently ecocentric experience of the world is more accurately seen as paranoia- "pollution hysteria," as Sandilands rather surprisingly calls it- about maintaining the body's ideal bounded purity. Similarly, Timothy Morton also argues in The Ecological Thought that environmentalist! is too concerned to maintain boundaries: Environmental rhetoric is . . . sunny, straightforward, ableist, holistic, hearty, and "healthy." Where does that leave negativity, introversion, femininity, writing, medi- ation, ambiguity, darkness, irony, fragmentation, and sickness? Are these simply nonecological categories? Must we accept the injunction to turn on, tune in, go outdoors, and breathe Nature? ... If the ecological thought is as big as I think it is, it must include dark- ness as well as light, negativity as well as positivity. (The Ecological Thought 16) To return to Mabey, what is "Nature" that it can be called upon to cure his despair- as if it suffered none of its own? I'm reminded of Werner Herzog's Encounters at the End of the Earth , his antiwildlife documentary film, in which he states at the outset that his "questions about nature" are "different" from the norm, and goes on to prove it by asking a baffled penguin expert: "Is there such as thing as insanity among penguins?" Or to put it at its most challenging: Sandilands and Morton prompt us to ask what exactly is wrong with pollution , a word that comes freighted with a history of disciplining sexual as well as environmental deviance? For Sandilands, "environmental governmentality [is] a particular technology of abjection, a discourse organizing, both symbolically and somatically, myriad practices of ingestion and excretion, desire and revulsion. It is an irrevocably social process, linking a desire for internal corporeal order with the expulsion of disorderly and terrifying substances, disorderly and ter- rifying bodies" (31). If queers risk polluting the body politic with nonreproductive sexuality and wayward bodies, then perhaps pollu- tion itself is a radically "queer" challenge to the partially concealed normativity of ecological and personal health. Morton wishes to</page><page sequence="11">504 ISLE persuade us that "while we campaign to make our world "cleaner" and less toxic, less harmful to sentient beings, our philosophical adventure should in some ways be quite the reverse. We should be finding ways to stick around with the sticky mess that we're in and that we are, making thinking dirtier, identifying with ugliness" (Ecology without Nature 188). It is far from clear, however, that one could orchestrate such a "campaign" whilst simultaneously enjoying the "adventure," especially if the latter required sealing off in pro- phylactic scare quotes the very idea of "cleanliness" the environmen- tal activism hoped to promote. Or to put it another way, how much of the intellectual adventure can the campaign afford to admit? We have arrived at a quandary that seems the negative image of Mabey's nature cure. Let us admit, for now, that Sandilands is right that "the idea of queers as abject-toxins still lurks in environmental discourse" (27), although the evidence for that proposition is extremely limited. Let us suppose the analysis of the disciplinary regimes of environmental power-knowledge is accurate too (though we might reasonably ask how far it really extends into even the Western middle classes) and agree not to question the monomania about power the analysis inherits from Foucault- to the exclusion of preoccupations of social primates like love, spite, solidarity, and other aspects of "groupishness."6 Admitting all these, where does the queer analysis leave environmental criticism, bereft of its most power- fully normative discourse: of health , that for which we fear most deeply and personally? Morton hopes to make the world "less harmful to sentient beings," but what is "harm" without "health"? Sandilands admits the need, anyway, for environmental governmen- tality, although she hopes to bring it "within reach" of democratic negotiation rather than remaining opaquely self-evident or scientifi- cally mandated. But then she also challenges the heteronormative bias of estrogenic "pollution hysteria," which claims to find evidence of endocrine disruption in the increased prevalence of intersexed and feminized organisms, from amphibians and fish through to St. Lawrence dolphins.7 It depends, she says, upon the absolute naturalness of bodily dimorphism, even in species that harbor a wide range of characteristics within members of the same sex. If male organisms are starting to become "feminized," it must be a very bad thing for nature (some environmentalists have been heard arguing that the greater visibility of the human transgender community must be the result of pollution too). (27)</page><page sequence="12">Narratives of Personal and Ecological Health 505 While it is true that, in some species, intersexed individuals seem to be quite normal, rather than evidence of pathogenic pollution, in others, including humans, "bodily dimorphism" is natural .8 Moreover, if the powerful and unwavering desire some humans have to change gender (or, as seems more likely, to fulfill anatomically a gender identity one already, mentally and therefore neurologically, has) is to some degree biochemical in origin, it would not be oppres- sive to hypothesize that estrogenic pollution might be increasing it. On the contrary, considering the psychological and physiological toll of gender reassignment, it would be oppressive not to confront and seek to eliminate a possible cause of gender dysmorphia. The desire to destigmatize disabled, intersexed, and "queer" bodies is absolutely laudable, but the key is surely to try and break the link between discourses of pollution and social abjection, not to use dismay at the latter to condemn campaigns against the former. Efforts to ban industrial pollutants like methylmercury (cause of Minamata disease) and dangerous drugs such as thalidomide require what Sandilands condemns as "skin vigilance" and "pollution hyste- ria," and there seems no reason to suppose that success would further stigmatize people who were disabled or deformed by those pollutants. Strong empirical evidence that the discourses of queer cor- poreality and pollution are more loosely articulated than Sandilands supposes is that increased regulation of toxic chemicals and improved legal protection for disabled people have proceeded together in Western countries, not in opposition to one another. Material ecocriti- cism will need to attend to such mismatches between what discursive analysis might lead one to predict and what actually happens in the political sphere. Living Downstream Like Mabey, Steingraber weaves an emotive narrative of disease into her reflections on environmental health. Unlike Mabey, her scien- tific precision is impeccable, and so the analogy she pursues in her "Personal Investigation of Cancer and the Environment" is corre- spondingly secure. For example, she conveys the inherent complex- ities of cancer epidemiology by developing a sustained analogy with her work as an ecologist. At first, looking at cancer registries, she finds it difficult to see the wood for the trees: each data point is a suf- fering woman like herself. But then the scientist's eye takes over, seeking patterns and questioning trends. Where Mabey seems deter- mined to give priority to his own perceptions, Steingraber is well aware, from her studies of forest composition, of the risks and biases</page><page sequence="13">506 ISLE that beset the individual environmental encounter. For instance, she admits: "I tended to overestimate the presence of rare plants because my delight at discovering them was more memorable than my efforts to note the prevalence of their common neighbors" (38). Cancer diag- noses are subject to similar distortions, especially over long periods of time with changing clinical protocols and technologies. The simile developed here mutually reinforces our understanding of both the source of the metaphor (forest ecology) and its target (cancer epi- demiology), informing our sense of their possibilities and limits. The central interest of Living Downstream is cancer in humans, and so the possible impact of synthetic chemicals on the wider environ- ment is seldom mentioned. However, a pivotal section of the book develops an analogy similar to the one Mabey proposes between himself and the hirondelles. The totem animal in this case, though, is an individual beluga whale in the St. Lawrence River, which was found to share with Steingraber a specific type of bladder cancer: transitional cell carcinoma. The scientific material on the contamina- tion and disease afflicting many of the whales in this waterway alter- nates sections at this point with her narrative of first having, and being treated for, cancer as a young woman (133-39). Whereas Mabey's is a poetic analogy- harmlessly evocative until saddled with a narrative weight it is too fragile to bear- Steingraber's is simultane- ously symbolic and obdurately material. Conservationist Leone Pippard is cited using the belugas to stand in synecdochically for a world of bodies vulnerable to toxicity ("Do you think you are somehow immune . . .?" [139]), but also as a telling riposte to the pernicious minimization of environmental factors in cancer etiology in favor of questions of individual lifestyle: "Tell me, does the St. Lawrence beluga drink too much alcohol and does the St. Lawrence beluga smoke too much and does the St Lawrence beluga have a bad diet ... is that why the beluga whales are ill?" (139). At the same time, the analogy between the sick whales and the author is kept largely unstated, gaining authority from that very restraint. The idiom of the personal testimony is quite different from that of the scientific reportage, and Steingraber refuses to try to mix them. Instead, like an accomplished novelist or clever advertiser, she leaves the white space between disparate elements to be filled with the reader's own inferences. Steingraber's book would also seem to be a perfect test case for the challenge to environmental governmentality from "queer ecology," which celebrates transgression and rupture in keeping with its intellectual heritage. The rhetorical structure of Living Downstream is complex, resisting simplifying summary, but there is no doubt that</page><page sequence="14">Narratives of Personal and Ecological Health 507 a key trope is that of "trespass": a typical comment is her exhortation to readers to "resolve, collectively, to divorce our economy from its current dependencies on toxic chemicals known to trespass inside our bodies" (xxi). At one point, the somewhat xenophobic implica- tions of her metaphor become startlingly explicit: "Like undocu- mented aliens, these chemicals may have been swept in from other countries, even other hemispheres" (173), although this is an isolated comment. Ultimately, Steingraber's concern is to define contamina- tion as " toxic trespass- the involuntary use of one's body as a recep- tacle for someone else's chemicals" (279, italics original). The body violated by carcinogenic chemicals- the author's own, and that of every other sufferer and potential sufferer- exists throughout in implicit contrast with "a 'natural' body striving to be 'free' of the cor- rupting toxins that increasingly plague the world" (21), to borrow Sandilands's terms against their original skeptical intent. Steingraber seems determined to defend the very "natural" body that Sandilands represents as a fictive construct produced by disciplinary biopower, just as she argues passionately for the "cleaner" environment that Morton's analysis suggests is philosophically naÃ¯ve. Furthermore, Steingraber's intertwined scientific reportage and personal narrative combines what Sandilands's critique would call a powerful "desire for internal corporeal order" with a metaphorics that links "the expulsion of disorderly and terrifying substances, dis- orderly and terrifying bodies" (31): the warning of an "ever- expanding mosh pit of toxic chemicals" (103) is more amusing than alarming, though it follows soon after a metaphor of proliferation that recalls Malthusian anxieties about rapidly reproducing and unruly human bodies: "The rapid birthrate of petrochemicals began in 1945 and soon swamped the ability of government to oversee their production, use, and disposal. By 1976, 60,000 synthetic chemicals were in commercial use. How many of these were carcinogens? No one knew" (101-02). The analogy is clearly inexact: petrochemicals do not reproduce themselves, and so their "birthrate" is arithmetic, not geometric. Nevertheless, the metaphor powerfully conveys the idea of growth that, like human populations, risks "swamping" the institutions designed to manage it. The chemicals assume a creepily Gothic anthropomorphic agency, a trope, inherited from Rachel Carson's Silent Spring , that is a regular part of what Lawrence Buell calls "toxic discourse" (35-54). A similar figurative infrastructure is evident when Steingraber draws attention to the estrogenic chemicals discussed above, which easily "sabotage" the cellular systems intended respond to the natural hormone: "As a security detail . . . the estrogen receptor is</page><page sequence="15">508 ISLE notoriously gullible and will bind with an impressive number of chemicals, shuttling these hormone imposters along into the nucleus. Apparently, not much of a disguise is required to gain entry into the inner sanctum of the nucleus via the estrogen receptor. The password has not been changed in eons" (158). Precisely because Steingraber's trespass metaphor is so overt, the source and target syntactically linked but lexically distinct, it is inoffensive. Who could imagine she is handing immigration officials or nightclub bouncers carte blanche to rough up potential "imposters"? Where Sandilands criticizes the assumption of dimorphic gender norms in the ecology of endocrine imitators, Steingraber finds a certain tragic irony in the same story: the petrochemical "population bomb" went off after World War II, and was enabled by it in numer- ous ways, and yet "Many of the hypermasculine weapons of con- quest and progress are, biologically speaking, emasculating" (113). The trade names of pesticides, in particular, bristle with almost comical machismo, including "Arsenal, Assert, Bicep, Brawl, Bullet, Burndown, Chopper, Dagger, Firestorm, Prowl, and Shotgun" (155), but may, in some cases, have "the power to derange the male testicle if exposures occur at key moments in development" (113). It is hardly the only such contradiction given that alcohol is constantly marketed in sexualized terms somewhat at odds with its physiological effects, but it is a painfully sharp one. Queer theorists tempted to make merry with the heteronormative assumptions behind Steingraber's lament for the "ransacking of manhood" by estrogenic chemicals would presumably be stopped short by the unquestionably patholog- ical physical consequences: "undescended testicles, lowered sperm counts, and testicular cancer" (113). Living Downstream might appear to be an excellent example of what Sandilands chastises as pollution hysteria, but in truth the situa- tion is not quite that simple. Steingraber undoubtedly seeks to defend bodily boundaries against incursion, and contrasts the com- promised health of bodies and land after World War II with the rela- tively pure counterparts that existed prior to it. Furthermore, not only are toxic chemicals represented as foreign invaders, but a medical verdict of "cancer" is read explicitly as a performative utterance that exiles the patient from their "homeland," health: Like a jury's verdict or an adoption decree, a cancer diagnosis is an authoritative pronouncement, one with the power to change your identity. It sends you into an unfamiliar country where all the rules of human conduct are alien. In this new territory, you disrobe in</page><page sequence="16">Narratives of Personal and Ecological Health 509 front of strangers who are allowed to touch you. You submit to bodily invasions. You agree to the removal of body parts. You agree to be poisoned. You have become a cancer patient. (35) Once made to cross this frontier, the patient becomes the subject of an incomprehensibly cruel authority, in whose domain all familiar decorum is suspended; a stark contrast with the queer celebration of transgression and the "other." Yet the disciplines Steingraber advo- cates differ crucially from those critiqued by Sandilands, for the former ramify outward from individual cancer sufferers to inform, if possible, institutional regulation rather than, as in the classic Foucauldian model, being injunctions of diffuse biopolitical author- ities introjected by docile ecological subjects. There is, in fact, nothing docile about cancer patients in Steingraber's account: like Carson, they become experts and activists even unto death. While Sandilands might be suspicious of the rhetoric of purity and contamination Steingraber deploys, she would undoubtedly applaud her determina- tion not to content herself and her readers with rituals of forlorn purification and imagined personal safety, but to force her way "upstream" toward the sources of pollution, which are often also the loci of immense social and political power. Critique and Beyond Unsparing critique of concepts and rhetorics, without which one cannot, at the same time, speak or think, is perhaps a decent short- hand summary of deconstruction. If so, all serious ecocriticism would be deconstructive. On the other hand, I'm haunted by the question Scott Slovic kept asking of an essay I wrote criticizing place-based ecocritical pedagogy: What would you do? One way to view the con- structive role for ecocriticism as a form of cultural politics is to envis- age it subjecting the rhetorical and theoretical "tools" used by environmentalists to "proof" with a view to improving them, but, as I can testify, the destruction-testing phase is always more exciting and impressive than the constructive one. As a result, we risk leaving no tools in the box. Why does Sandilands level her critique not, for the most part, at the defiantly unsustainable discourses of modern consumerism, but instead, like Morton, at environmental rhetoric ? Why have so many postcolonial critics attacked the conservationist policies of environ- mental NGOs? Why are ecofeminists seemingly more concerned about the rhetoric of "population control" than the effects of</page><page sequence="17">510 ISLE burgeoning human populations on biodiversity and global climate? Why do I question the analogy of personal and ecological health in environmentalist texts rather than, say, the cheerful accumulation of Air Miles by the international haute bourgeoisie- among them aca- demics? When, in short, did ecocriticism come to focus so much on criticizing environmentalism? Perhaps it has to do with the habits of reflexive critique developed by cultural critics in the last 40 years; perhaps it is that we debate, as I do with Sandilands, with those whose work confronts and intrigues us. Taking on the greenwashing of BP (even pre-Gulf oil spill) might seem at once impossibly quixotic and too laughably easy. It need not be immobilizing in practice- I suspect the theoretical differences amongst us are far greater than the ethical ones- but it may have serious pedagogical consequences. I'm reminded of the student who finished my course several years ago and said, "I used to be an environmentalist, but now I'm just con- fused." Is that an indictment? I genuinely don't know. Are we confi- dent queer theory could provide a normative framework as emotive and accessible as "health"? I doubt it. The most energetically defended front lines in North American cultural politics lie between Catriona Sandilands and Steve Milloy, climate skeptic, Fox News pundit and scion of the antienvironmentalist "think-tank" the Cato Institute, and yet both promote "citizen science" in the face of cul- tures of expertise, both reject "Malthusian" analyses of population growth, and both reject what they call "pollution hysteria" (Milloy) - albeit for radically different reasons.9 I can redeem this mischievous comparison only by admitting that Sandilands models a possible response to this quandary in the very essay criticized here, not in the corrosively skeptical analysis of envi- ronmental biopolitics taken by itself, but in its chiasmic relationship to the life writing with which it is interwoven. I have to confess here a personal allergy (perhaps acquired here in England) to life writing and narrative scholarship, a discomfort with the confessional mode that seems, mutatis mutandis , almost inseparable from autobiography in any form. Its characteristic intimacies and occasional indignities make my toes curl; I prefer my painful identifications to remain fic- tional. What "Eco Homo" gives us, though, is a beautifully restrained account of the author's initiation into Japanese Butoh dance amidst its engagement with Foucault, Butler, and Kristeva: Wednesday, June 19: Every day this week, we have been experimenting with "applying" various images at different places in our bodies. This process is a vital part of Butoh ; dances emerge from an embodied interaction between received</page><page sequence="18">Narratives of Personal and Ecological Health 511 image and lived memory. Apparently ; founder Tatsumi Hijikata "would take as many as a thousand images from nature, including elemental forms such as wind and rain, which he would have to remember, then he would apply them throughout [his] body Your fingers plant flowers in a garden over your head. Your joints are blown apart by the wind. Your feet are worms. Someone is taking your heart out of your chest. There are cranes flying in your shoulders. (28, italics in original) The practice, as she explains it, is at once an instance of strenuous bodily discipline and a profoundly imaginative challenge to our assumptions of our boundaries and parameters. The delicate sketches from her life refrain from emotional or moral coerciveness, providing an enriching counterpoint to her theoretical deconstruction of the dis- course of health. They coincide, finally, in a lyrical excursus on the philosophy of skin: Skin is ... a metaphor of queer liminality, a body of abjection. . . . Skin is not static; it is a physical process of layering by which the body pushes outward into space, only to flake off in a lifelong Hansel and Gretei trail of one's presence in the world. Skin thickens and thins depending on its involvement in particular embodied rituals of living and working and aging. . . . Skin cracks, erupts, sags, tears, scabs, heals, festers, peels, calluses; skin is lubricated, lifted, painted, cut, sewn, burned, moved around, bitten, tattooed, eaten. Skin is a dangerously receptive place of contact and transmission, but it is also part of consciousness and agency. . . . Skin thus claims the integral body and its abject at the same time. (33) Her eco-politics would therefore include a "transgressive element/' according to which the half-submerged normative commitments and entanglements of personal and ecological health are exposed to queer critique, but might also provoke a converse "committed desire to re-habituate, re-familiarize, and re-materialize the body in relation to others." Acknowledging the multivalence of skin, Sandilands asks: "How to practice a body-on-the-skin in a way that does not aim to coherence and closure, nor to infinite fluidity, but to an active, sensual and contextual semi-permeability?" The question implies a</page><page sequence="19">512 ISLE necessary, if always provisional, synthesis of the naturalizing and deconstructive projects of ecocriticism. We need not accept the inherent hostility and incompatibility of "nature-endorsing" and "nature-sceptical" positions in the environ- mental debate, as analyzed in Kate Soper's classic What Is Nature? In part this is because, as Soper observes, "It is one thing to challenge various cultural representations of nature, another to represent nature as if it were a convention of culture, and there are many in the Green Movement who reject this conventionalist approach while readily subscribing to critiques of the ideological naturalization of social and sexual relations" (4-5). Likewise, it does not seem impossible that we might be able to depathologize and destigmatize queer bodies without having to (rhetorically) detoxify pollution. Material ecocriticism, which attempts to render the relationship with the biological sciences more secure and functional, will make the mystico-phenomenological I-Spy of a Richard Mabey seem quaintly old-fashioned and redundant. It will also be distinct from the type of discursive analysis associated with queer ecology and environmental justice because it will evaluate the tropes active in environmental discourse for their philosophical coherence and empir- ical accuracy, rather than their political propriety first and foremost. Whether the analogy of personal and ecological health discussed here conduces to environmental politics or the emancipation of oppressed human groups depends upon how precisely it is framed and deployed in specific texts. Steingraber's rhetoric of carcinogenic pollution and toxic trespass, for instance, meets the first criterion without significantly harming the second. By contrast, Sandilands's critique of "pollution hysteria" seems liable to be toxic to environ- mentalism itself whilst being of rather indirect benefit to LGBT people. Certainly, the ideal for the ecocritic will be when both objec- tives can be met simultaneously, but we must prioritize the interests of Earth Others. After all, if environmental critics don't enact an eco- centric bias, who will? Notes 1. A much shorter draft version of this paper was published as part of the proceedings from a conference in Mainz, Germany: Ecology and Life Writing, ed. Alfred Hornung and Zhao Baisheng (Heidelberg: Winter, 2011). 2. James Lovelock's Gaia is essentially a homeorhetic entity. Gaia: The Practical Science of Planetary Medicine explicitly and consistently presents itself as "one of those home medical encyclopedias" that will help the reader "better to understand the Earth in health and disease," (18) with chapters on</page><page sequence="20">Narratives of Personal and Ecological Health 513 Anatomy and Physiology. Within this construct, humans are seen "in some ways like a pathogenic microorganism" (153). Lovelock's book is excluded from the present study because the author's own body is not drawn into the analogy. 3. Metaphors are generative in literary language because the relationships they conjure are surprising, and yet conceptual metaphors- ones like "good is up/bad is down" or "knowledge is light"- do seem to be founded in phys- ical facts, such as our species" bipedalism and diurnal habits. They are, in that sense, at once nondeterministic and nonarbitrary. However, there seems no compelling reason to assume the authenticity of a naturalizing metaphor over any other kind. Had Mabey thought "I'm not firing on all cylinders today," would he have proposed an occult connection between human minds and car engines? 4. This wonderfully useful phrase is used in Richard Dawkins's The Extended Phenotype. 5. In this sense, material ecocriticism ought to be critical of so-called "intersectional analysis," which insists on the alignment of egalitarian social relationships and harmonious or sustainable ecological ones. See my review of "Ecocriticism" in The Year's Work in Critical and Cultural Theory 2011 (Vol. 18), pp. 46-50 and 53-55. 6. "Groupishness" is Matt Ridley s handy term (1996) for social behavior in between the extremes of selfishness and altruism. 7. For more detailed discussion of this point, in the context of a critique of "queer ecocriticism," see my "How Queer Is Green?" Configurations Winter 2010 (Vol. 18, nos. 1-2): 73-96. 8. According to Joan Roughgarden, populations of bighorn sheep, for instance, may include a large proportion of "effeminate" males (138). If there were a corresponding proportion in the human species and our primate cousins, we would not consider intersexual morphology in people pathological. 9. As Frederick Buell shows, the American antienvironmentalist right has adopted the rhetoric of nature's impurity with alacrity: "In sneering at envi- ronmentalism and celebrating a chemically modified nature, Ames's hypothe- sis [of natural carcinogenicity] asserted exactly what conservatives had argued in other areas: nature-lovers' notions of the pure and pristine were delusions" (loc. 2664). In relation to human sexuality, though, they remain obsessively committed to a heteronormative "nature." Works Cited Allister, Mark. Refiguring the Map of Sorrow: Nature Writing and Autobiography.
