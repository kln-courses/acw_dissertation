<plain_text><page sequence="1">BIRDS &amp; MEN: American Birds in Science, Art, Literature, and Conser- vation,1800-1900. By Robert Henry Walker. Cambridge: Harvard University Press. 1955. 230 PP. $5.75. The nineteenth century saw the first great interest in and development of geology, chemistry, ichthyology, and other sciences. This advance in- cluded the learning of new and unsuspected facts about the animal world, and of birds in particular. It is the story of man's discovery of birdlore that Mr. Walker sets out to recount, and for the period of Wilson to Burroughs he does this with literary effectiveness. The relative merits of those whose names have stood the test of two or more generations come within his critical scrutiny, and their final literary and scientific worth is properly assessed. Modern writers, however, like modern men in general, are sometimes victims of the patterns they set. And this is true of the work in hand. Despite the attempt to make the century limit appear logical, it has no</page><page sequence="2">396 American Literature more validity than any other artificial measurement imposed from without. It is true that the nineteenth century afforded the bulk of well-known naturalists, but a more logical beginning could have been made with the decade of Bartram and Crevecceur, and in this way the awkward flash- back to these and other figures in the Thoreau chapter would have been avoided. The work might more reasonably have terminated with World War I, when the work of Burroughs, Muir, and Roosevelt really came to an end. Fortunately, in the conservation section the story is carried down through 1914, when the victory over the plume-hunters was won. But to object further to the exclusion of twentieth-century material would be to carp at the author for not writing an entirely different book. And there was reason for eschewing the twentieth century, for the host of bird painters, including Forbush, Horsfall, Menaboni, Peterson, and others, and the printing of dozens of Nature Almanacs would certainly have rudely elbowed the earlier offerings. The story the book tells is a simplified one, perhaps oversimplified. It starts with the literary ornithologists, Wilson and Audubon, relates the work of the great ninetenth-century naturists, Thoreau and Emerson, and continues with the writings of such late-century enthusiasts as Bradford Torrey, Frank Bolles, John Muir, and John Burroughs. Because the bloom was taken off the ninetenth century by the earlier enthusiastic work of Foerster and Tracy and Smallwood, Walker has intensified his own critical sense-equally hard on pure rhapsody and mere informality of approach-and his tone becomes one of judgment rather than apprecia- tion. Even so it is gratifying that the story of birdmen worthies of the Victorian period has been so readably presented. Audubon's greatness in his encompassing vision and in his bird art is carefully and fairly set forth (George Ord notwithstanding). Thoreau, though appearing fragmentarily as a bird student, is handled in a challenging way. John Burroughs emerges as he was in life, the student of outdoor life, with whatever of Darwinism and anthropomorphism he chanced to incor- porate. But his last phase, that of Bergsonism, lies outside the scope of the narrative. While the title of this work would lead us to expect an equal devotion to all the announced fields, the study is obviously more concerned with literary figures than purely scientific ones, though even in the field of fine writing H. W. Higginson and Wilson Flagg are only sketchily intro- duced. Among the scientists Thomas Nuttall is neglected and that fine ornithologist Elliot Coues is scarcely treated with the fairness he deserves. While limitations are being considered, I question the statement that</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews 397 the materials of Thoreau's journal (four volumes) are "too diverse and inconclusive to serve the purposes of the . . . study." Moreover, in the poetry chapter the author has sedulously followed Burroughs's list of American bird poems. Though birds come into proper focus in the praise of the great nature elegies of Walt Whitman, still somewhere in the book such poems as Wilde's "To the Mocking-Bird," Dana's "The Little Beach Bird," Alsop's "Verses to the Shearwater," Simms's "The Slain Eagle" should have come under scrutiny. No one will quarrel with the author for omitting minor figures like Henry Pickering and John C. Brainard, but, though it may be critically sound and certainly self-assuring to dismiss forgotten versifiers of bird life, Americans do from time to time encounter minor pieces of this order and a volume devoted to bird- lore should not so abruptly have dismissed them, even on high critical grounds. This volume leaves one a little regretful that for all the fullness of entries on Wilson, Audubon, and Whitman the treatment of so many literary figures had to be cursory. The work does not aim at evoking the mood of writers nor attempt to suggest their full range. Rather than presenting a full analysis of bird-writers, Walker has sought to appraise major workers in the field and the place of their labors in the cultural and economic life of the nation. Through the whole account there is a core of hard-headed common sense about man's disturbance of the balance of nature and the destruction of natural creatures. To all readers the section on Boys, Pot-hunters, and Women will be extremely interesting, especially for those who do not already know the sad story of vanity, destruction, and profit which marked the decline of bird populations in the late nineteenth century. Walker's account, though definitely noncrusading in nature, will still help rouse present-day readers to the realization that the cause of conservation is not yet won. University of Toledo. G.
