<plain_text><page sequence="1">MILTON BIRNBAUM Aldous Huxley's Quest for Values: A Study in Religious Syncretism Given the nature of spiders, webs are inevitable. And given the nature of human beings, so are religions. Spiders can't help making flytraps, and men can't help making symbols. That's what the human brain is there for - to turn the chaos of given experience into a set of fairly manageable symbols. Sometimes the symbols correspond fairly closely to some of the aspects of the external reality behind our experience; then you· have science and common sense. Sometimes, on the contrary, the symbols have almost no connection with external reality; then you have paranoia and delirium. More often there's a mixture, part realistic and part fantastic; that's religion. Good religion or bad religion - it depends on the blending of the cocktail. Aldous Huxley, Island (New York, 1962), p. 208. •jMLDous Huxley's first comments on religion indicate that he began as a /i' sardonic skeptic. In one of his earliest novels, for example, we find one of the characters comment on God as follows : Ί am that I am .... But I have with me ... a physiologue, a pedagogue and a priapagogue; for I leave out of account mere artists and journalists whose titles do not end with the magic syllable. And finally . . . plain Dog, which being interpreted kabalistically backwards signifies God. All at your service.1 In Jesting Pilate, published in 1926, he writes that it may be true that "reli- gion is a device employed by the Life Force for the promotion of its evolu- tionary designs. But they would be justified in adding that religion is also a device employed by the Devil for the dissemination of idiocy, intolerance, and servile abjection."2 In his essay "One and Many," found in Do What You Will, published in 1929, he declares himself "officially an agnostic." He develops the theory that God is simply a projection of the human personality: "... men 169</page><page sequence="2">170 + COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES make Gods in their own likeness. To talk about religion except in terms of human psychology is an irrelevance."3 He ridicules the anthropomorphic con- ception of God because it reflects the weaknesses and aspirations of the society in which a particular God is worshipped. Using himself as an example, he writes that when he is enjoying good health and when the weather is propi- tious, then he can well believe that "God's in his heaven and all's right with the world." "On other occasions, skies and destiny being inclement, I am no less immediately certain of the malignant impersonality of an uncaring uni- verse."4 In a poem he wrote in 1925 called "Philosophy," he says that it is difficult to hear what God is saying because "God stutters." He would prefer to believe in the sanctity of what he calls the "Human Personality" than in the "myth" of God. "We do at least know something of Human Personality, whereas of God we know nothing and, knowing nothing, are at liberty to invent as freely as we like."5 The reason that people believe in this "theological game" is that they find it much more psychologically satisfying to conform to habit than to be subjected to the discomfort of rebellious skepticism. The vacuum created by Huxley's rejection of an anthropomorphic concep- tion of religion was filled in the 1920's by his espousal of the Lawrentian doctrine of the instinctive life. Man should not favor what is felt to be a false spirituality but should live passionately and instinctively. In Point Counter Point Mark Rampion (who is supposed to represent D. H. Lawrence) speaks of the three diseases plaguing mankind: "Jesus' and Newton's and Henry Ford's disease." All three "diseases" could be eliminated, both Lawrence and Huxley felt, by the rejection of science, technology, and traditional Christianity. In Do What You Will, published the same year as Point Counter Point, Huxley makes the same points. He writes that the world is faced with three dangers: (1) monotheism and the menace of the "super-humanist" ideal; (2) "the worship of success and efficiency"; (3) "the machine." Monotheism and the "super-humanist" ideal constitute a danger because they are not based on any foundation in reality and thus do not allow the living of the fully instinctive life. "The worship of success and efficiency constitutes another menace to our world. What our ancestors sacrificed on the altars of Spirituality, we sacrificed on those of the Bitch Goddess and Taylorism."6 "The machine" is a menace because it robs man of his creativity and makes him merely a passively effi- cient robot. These three menaces have killed people's instinctive love of the fully integrated life, and "the result is that they lose their sense of values, their taste and judgment become corrupted, and they have an irresistible ten- dency to love the lowest when they see it."7 When we analyze Huxley's comments on Judaism and Christianity, we can readily appreciate why the Nazi propagandists used some of his statements in their attacks on Western democracies.8 In 1929, for example, he made the following attack on Jews: Their mission, in a word, was to infect the rest of humanity with a belief which . . . prevented them from having any art, any philosophy, any political life, any breadth or diversity of vision, any progress. We may be pardoned for wishing that the Jews had remained, not forty, but four thousand years in their repulsive wilderness.·</page><page sequence="3">ALDOUS HUXLEY'S QUEST FOR VALUES + 171 Similarly, in Along the Road he sympathizes with those who have to work "eight hours a day in an office for the greater enrichment of the Jews." In Antic Hay &amp; stranger whom Gumbril meets on the train complains: "Hideous red cities pullulating with Jews, sir. Pullulating with prosperous Jews. Am I right in being indignant, sir?"10 He blames the monotheistic religion of the Jews for the emphasis given by other peoples to wealth and materialism, for the sentimentality current in music, and for the inculcation of other false values in our civilization. It should be pointed out, however, that this blatant anti-Semitism disappeared after the advent of Hitler. In his later books Huxley deprecates the savagery of the Nazis; in one of his novels, After Many a Summer, one of the minor characters is a sympathetic Jew who falls victim to the ruthless business cunning of Jo Stoyte, a non-Jew. The kind of misfired generalization which characterizes his attack on the Jews also characterizes his castigation of what, at different times, he calls "Christianity," "Puritanism," "Calvinism," and "organized religion." His ob- jections to "Christianity" are several: First of all, he attacks the cruel persecu- tions of the more fanatical Christians. Although in the following excerpt he is singling out the Puritans, he makes similar attacks on other Christian groups in many of his other works as well: The puritan was free to range the world, blighting and persecuting as he went, free to make life poisonous, not only for himself, but for all who came near him. The puritan was and is a social danger, a public and private nuisance of the most odious kind. Baudelaire was a puritan inside out. Instead of asceticism and respectability he practised debauchery. The means he used were the opposite of those employed by the puritans; but his motives and theirs, the ends that he and they achieved, were the same. He hated life as much as they did, and was as successful in destroying it11 The cruelty which Huxley finds so distasteful in the Puritans is like the cruelty which he discovers among the Catholics in the centuries during the Inquisition· "In medieval and early modern Christendom the situation of sorcerers and their clients was almost precisely analogous to that of Jews under Hitler, capitalists under Stalin, Communists and fellow travelers in the United States . . . ."" In The Devils of Loudun he describes the brutality of the Roman Catholic hierarchy towards one of their own priests who refused to admit that he was inhabited by a devil. Their cruelty did not stem from their alleged hatred of heresy alone; it arose, according to Huxley, because their entire religion was motivated by hatred: Ecclesiastical history exhibits a hierarchy of hatreds, descending by orderly degrees from the Church's official and ecumenical hatred of heretics and infidels to the particular hatreds of Order for Order, school for school, province for province and theologian for theologian.18 In addition to attacking the extreme cruelty of both the Puritans and the Catholics, Huxley also blames them for making people believe that this world is but a gloomy interlude between earthly pain and celestial euphoria. "Chris- tianity has always found a certain difficulty in fitting the unfatigued, healthy and energetic person into its philosophical scheme."14 If perchance Christianity</page><page sequence="4">172 + COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES does come upon a person who says that he is quite happy for the moment, then it reminds him that this state of well-being is but illusory and certainly temporary; every silver lining is but hiding an imminent cloudburst. The Greeks, Huxley avers, were far wiser in being realistically pessimistic and in using this pessimism to justify their epicurean and instinctive way of life. Huxley here seems either to be unaware of or else ignorant of the fact that the same society which gave rise to the Epicureans also gave rise to the Stoics. There are other features which Huxley attacks in Christianity. He seems to take unusual delight in pointing out that often the priests themselves did not practice the austerity which they so unctuously preached. Thus, in The Devils of Loudun he points out that essentially there were two Urbain Gran- diers: Grandier the sensualist and Grandier the sermonizing priest. He de- scribes how between Grandier's weekly debaucheries he was preparing ser- mons filled with "What eloquence, what choice and profound learning, what subtle, but eminently sound theology!"15 When Grandier hears the discom- forting news from one of his female parishioners that he is the father of her unborn child, Huxley describes his hypocritical reaction as follows: Shifting his hand from the bosom to the bowed head and changing his tone, without any transition, from the bawdy to the clerical, the parson told her that she must learn to bear her cross with Christian resignation. Then, remembering the visit he had promised to pay to poor Mme. de Brou, who had a cancer of the womb and needed all the spiritual consolation he could give her, he took his leave.16 In his essay "Variations of a Philosopher," published in Themes and Varia- tions, Huxley analyzes the term shepherd to demonstrate how like sheep people never stop to consider that "a shepherd is 'not in business for his health,' still less for the health of his sheep." If a shepherd takes good care of his flock, it is only to fatten them for the eventual slaughter. People should con- sider the meaning of the term shepherd before they proceed to talk sentimentally about their pastors: Applied to most of the States and Churches of the last two or three thousand years, this pastoral metaphor is seen to be exceedingly apt - so apt, indeed, that one wonders why the civil and ecclesiastical herders of men should ever have allowed it to gain currency. From the point of view of the individual lambs, rams and ewes there is, of course, no such thing as a good shepherd; their problem is to find means whereby they may enjoy the benefits of a well-ordered social life without being exposed to the shearings, milkings, geldings and butcheries which have always been associated with the pastoral office.17 There are still other serious faults that Huxley has found with "most of the States and Churches of the last two or three thousand years." He complains that "Compared with that of the Taoists and Far Eastern Buddhists," the Christian attitude towards Nature has been curiously insensitive and often downright domineering and violent."18 Encouraged by "an unfortunate re- mark in Genesis," Christians have treated animals as things to be exploited for their own benefits. Furthermore, Huxley is very bitter against the church because it has not offered any kind of opposition to the waging of wars.</page><page sequence="5">ALDOÜS HUXLEY'S QUEST FOR VALUES + 173 In Ape and Essence, where his bitterness has perhaps reached its most intense pitch, he writes: The brass bands give place to the most glutinous of Wurlitzers, "Land of Hope and Glory" to 'Onward, Christian Soldiers." Followed by his very Reverend Dean and Chapter, the Right Reverend, the Baboon-Bishop of the Bronx advances majestic, his crozier in his jeweled paw, to pronounce benediction upon the two Field Marshalissimos and their patriotic proceedings.19 If we look at the ministers in Huxley's novels, we find that they are all satirically drawn. In Crome Yellow we have the Reverend Bodinham, who is much disturbed because his prediction of the coming of the Lord ("He'll sneak around like a thief) has not been realized. In Antic Hay we have the Reverend Pelvey, whose ineffectiveness as a preacher is satirically demonstrated: while the Reverend Pelvey is preaching, one of the audience to whom his religious message is directed is thinking of "trousers with pneumatic seats." In Eyeless in Gaza Mr. Thursley, a minister, is successful in his sermons and in the publication of his articles in the Guardian, but he becomes uncontrollably angry when his wife fails to fill up his inkwell. In Time Must Have a Stop Huxley pictures the minister-father of Mrs. Thwale as a completely futile man: while the minister is trying to reform the world, he does not realize that his daughter is becoming bitterly opposed to religion; ironically enough, it is the minister's daughter who worships material comfort and commits adultery.20 Of all the Christian faiths, he seems to have the greatest respect for Catholi- cism and the greatest admiration for Quakerism and those early Christians in whom he found mystic strains. The Quakers he admires for their opposition to war and for their contributions in alleviating some of the world's ecological problems. As for his attitude towards Catholicism, he writes: Catholicism is probably the most realistic of all Western religions. Its practice is based on a profound knowledge of human nature in all its varieties and gradations. From the fetish-worshipper to the metaphysician, from the tired business man to the mystic, from the sentimentalist and the sensualist to the intellectual, every type of human being can find in Catholicism the spiritual nourishment which he or she requires. For the sociable, unspiritual man Catholi- cism is duly sociable and unspiritual. For the solitary and the spiritual it provides a hermitage and the most exquisite, the profoundest models of religious medita- tion; it gives the silence of monasteries and the bareness of the Carthusian church, it offers the devotional introspection of À Kempis and St. Theresa, the subtleties of Pascal and Newman, the poetry of Crashaw and St John of the Cross and a hundred others. The only people for whom it does not cater are those possessed by that rare, dangerous, and uneasy passion, the passion for liberty.21 Presumably it is Huxley's "passion for liberty" which constitutes one of the reasons for his objection to Catholicism. But there are other reasons. I have already spoken of his attacks on "Christianity" because of its failure to oppose wars and its encouragement of materialistic success even to the extent of treating animals as mere property; Huxley does not exculpate Catholicism from his generalized attack on "Christianity." He also objects to Catholicism (at least to Catholicism as it is practiced in England) because it stresses the ritual at the expense of the more meaningful "mental prayer." In Eyeless in</page><page sequence="6">174 ♦ COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES Gaza we note the following extract from the diary of Anthony Beavis: "For English Catholics, sacraments are the psychological equivalents of tractors in Russia."22 It is not the ritual in only Catholicism to which he objects; he seems to find little value in the ritual of any religion. In Eyeless in Gaza he describes a funeral in which he satirizes the significance of the accompanying ritual. After describing the playing of the organ, the "little procession of surplices," the flowers, the singing and the intoning of the funeral prayer, he points out the ineffectiveness of all this ritual on Anthony Beavis: "But Anthony hardly heard, because he could think of nothing except those germs that were still there in spite of the smell of the flowers, and of the spittle that kept flowing into his mouth .... "28 Similarly, in Ape and Essence he describes the pro- cession in honor of Belial and refers to "the collective imbecility" which is one of the products of ceremonial religion. Having found little cause for admiration in both Judaism and Christianity, Huxley turned to the East to find the answer to his religious quest.24 It should be emphasized at this point that Huxley's apparent rejection of the Judeo- Christian tradition did not mean his denial of either the worth of religion or of the existence of God. As early as 1926 we find him writing: "The fact that men have had stupid and obviously incorrect ideas about God does not justify us in trying to eliminate God from out of the universe. Men have had stupid and incorrect ideas on almost every subject that can be thought about."25 Whenever Huxley found elements of mysticism, as he did in the Book of Ecclesiastes; in the writings of such mystic Christians as St. Augustine, St. Bernard of Clairvaux, Meister Eckhart, Walter Hilton, William Law, St. François de Sales, Thomas Traherne, and others; and in the Sufi books of Islam, he accepted their teachings of contemplation, renunciation of worldly preoccupation, and the practice of love. It is, therefore, not so much religion itself that he was rejecting but what he felt was the perversion of the religious essence. Mysticism is not an easy concept to define. As Huxley himself wrote, there are elements of mysticism common to nearly all religions. Inasmuch as he embraced not the mysticism of any particular religion (although he leaned more towards Buddhism than to any other) but rather mysticism itself as a kind of philosophical concept, perhaps the definition given by Evelyn Under- hill, two of whose books he includes in the bibliography in The Perennial Philosophy, most clearly explains mysticism in the sense in which Huxley uses it: "I ... understand it to be the expression of the innate tendency of the human spirit towards complete harmony with the transcendental order; what- ever be the theological formula under which that order is understood";26 it is significant that the one book of Huxley's entirely devoted to a survey of mysti- cism as it has appeared in all religions in all ages is called The Perennial Phi- losophy, not The Perennial Religion. Huxley himself declares both his incom- petence and his lack of desire to note the differences among the various modes of mysticism as manifested in the different religions. He says, for example, "I am not competent, nor is this the place to discuss the doctrinal differences</page><page sequence="7">ALDOUS HUXLEY'S QUEST FOR VALUES + 175 between Buddhism and Hinduism.'*27 Although The Perennial Philosophy is his only book devoted entirely to a critical interpretation of selections from mystical writings, his comments on this subject go back much further. Huxley's first comments on mysticism were hostile. In 1929, for example, he was writing: "... the mystics are never tired of affirming that their direct perceptions of unity are intenser, of finer quality and intrinsically more con- vincing, more self-evident, than their direct perceptions of diversity. But they can only speak for themselves. Other people's direct intuitions of diverse 'appearances' may be just as intensely self-evident as their intuition of unique 'reality.' "28 But in another essay of the book from which the previous quota- tion was taken, he admits that "It is also true that, in certain circumstances, we can actually feel, as a direct intuition, the existence of the all-comprehending unity, can intimately realize in a single flash of insight the illusoriness of the quotidian world of distinctions and relations."29 Even in his earlier novels we detect some elements of mysticism - the urge for a contemplative life, the dis- trust of the life of action. Thus, in Those Barren Leaves Calamy (who, at the end of the book, retires to the hills to start a life of pure contemplation) says: "The mind must be open, unperturbed, empty of irrelevant things, quiet. There's no room for thoughts in a half-shut, cluttered mind."80 Later in the book he comes out even more strongly for the contemplative life: No, it's not fools who turn mystics. It takes a certain amount of intelligence and imagination to realize the extra-ordinary queerness and mysteriousness of the world in which we live. The fools, the innumerable fools, take it all for granted, skate about cheerfully on the surface and never think of inquiring what's under- neath. They're content with appearances, such as your Harrow Road or Café de la Rotonde, call them realities and proceed to abuse any one who takes an interest in what lies underneath these superficial symbols, as a romantic imbecile.81 It should not be assumed that Huxley completely believed in mysticism back in the 1920's; but even when he denies the claim of the mystics that they achieve a unity with God, he qualifies this denial by writing that "that does not in any way detract from the value of mysticism as a way to perfect health."82 Similarly, in Brave New World, published in 1932, he is more against the tendency of the world to drift into a technological "utopia" than he is for mysticism; but in this book, also, we detect unmistakable signs of his eventual conversion to mysticism; thus, as Mustapha Mond is signing the papers ban- ning a work on "A New Theory of Biology," one of the reasons for his pro- scription of the book is that people might begin to think that "the goal was somewhere beyond, somewhere outside the present human sphere; that the purpose of life was not maintenance of well-being, but some intensification and refining of consciousness, some enlargement of knowledge."88 Eyeless in Gaza, published in 1936, contains Huxley's first complete endorse- ment of mysticism. In it he outlines the details of his mysticism which he was to elaborate in his subsequent works. It is in this book that he first advocates the achievement of a union with God. Evil is that which separates man from man; manifestations of evil, such as hatred, greed, and lust, should be avoided. Good is that which unites; love, compassion, and understanding are demon-</page><page sequence="8">176 + COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES strations of unity. Huxley admits that this unity is difficult to achieve, but man should at least attempt to achieve it through meditation and inner serenity. Through the attainment of this inner peace, he will be better able to withstand the external evil which is the condition of the world. From the notebook of Anthony Beavis we take the following expression of Huxley's mysticism at this time: Empirical facts: One. We are all capable of love for other human beings. Two. We impose limitations on that love. Three. We can transcend all these limitations- if we choose to. (It is a matter of observation that anyone who so desires can overcome personal dislike, class feeling, national hatred, colour prejudice. Not easy; but it can be done, if we have the will and know how to carry out our good intentions.) Four. Love expressing itself in good treatment breeds love. Hate expressing itself in bad treatment breeds hate. In the light of these facts, it's obvious what inter-personal, inter-class and inter- national policies should be. But, again, knowledge cuts little ice. We all know; we almost all fail to do. It is a question, as usual, of the best methods of imple- menting intentions. Among other things, peace propaganda must be a set of instructions in the art of modifying character.84 In Ends and Means Huxley repeats some of the thoughts concerning mysti- cism which he expressed in Eyeless in Gaza, but he adds some new features. Thus, he again writes that "Meditation ... is the technique of mysticism."35 But he emphasizes in this book the necessity of intuition in attaining this detachment from the world of animality. He again stresses the importance of will power in helping the individual to achieve the intuitive experience which will bring him into the mystical state: "What we perceive and understand depends upon what we are; and what we are depends partly on circumstances, partly, and more profoundly, on the nature of the efforts we have made to realize our ideal and the nature of the ideal we have tried to realize."36 Since the will is so important in achieving the mystical experience, Huxley particu- larly urges the reader to remember Irving Babbitt's statement that meditation produces a "super-rational concentration of will." Huxley concedes that all of us have animal instincts which cannot be ignored, but he does not want us to devote our entire attention to the satisfaction of these instincts. "Goodness is the method by which we divert our attention from this singularly wearisome topic of our animality and our individual separateness."37 This loss of pre- occupation with bodily needs may cause some physical suffering, but it is more than adequately compensated by the knowledge and the inner serenity which accompany the mystical experience. The non-attachment of mysticism is infinitely preferable to the attachment of the individual to the pursuit of the life of meaningless action. In his next novel, After Many a Summer, Huxley further elaborates his theories of mysticism. His espousal of the life of self-transcendence is thus expressed in the answer which Mr. Propter gives to Pete's question as to what good is and where it is to be found:</page><page sequence="9">ALDOUS HUXLEY'S QUEST FOR VALUES + 177 On the level below the human and on the level above. On the animal level and on the level . . . well, you can take your choice of names: the level of eternity; the level, if you don't object, of God; the level of the spirit - only that happens to be about the most ambiguous word in the language. On the lower level, good exists as the proper functioning of the organism in accordance with the laws of its own being. On the higher level, it exists in the form of a knowledge of the world without desire or aversion; it exists as the experience of eternity, as the transcendence of personality, the extension of consciousness beyond the limits imposed by the ego. Strictly human activities are the activities that prevent the manifestations of good on the other two levels .... Direcdy or indirecdy, most of our physical ailments and disabilities are due to worry and craving. We worry and crave ourselves into high blood pressure, heart disease, tuberculosis, peptic ulcer, low resistance to infection, neurasthenia, sexual aberrations, insanity, suicide. Not to mention all the rest88 In addition to craving liberation from the fetters of the ego, Mr. Propter wants liberation from time, which he describes as "a pretty bothersome thing." Furthermore, the cultivation of virtues is not sufficient; it must be the cultiva- tion of the right virtues - specifically, understanding and compassion. The possession of the other virtues is no guarantee of virtuous conduct: "Indeed, you can't be really bad unless you do have most of the virtues. Look at Milton's Satan for example. Brave, strong, generous, loyal, prudent, temperate, self- sacrificing."89 But because Milton's Satan lacked the qualities of understanding and compassion, he could not be a virtuous leader. In Grey Eminence, published in 1941, Huxley gives two additional suggestions to those who would embrace mysticism: First, the good achieved by a practice of mysticism "is a product of the ethical and spiritual artistry of individuals; it cannot be mass-produced."40 Secondly, people should beware of "only false, ersatz mysticisms - the nature-mysticism of Wordsworth; the sublimated sexual mysticism of Whitman; the nationality-mysticisms of all the patriotic poets and philosophers of every race and culture, from Fichte at the beginning of the period [the nineteenth century] to Kipling and Barrés at the end."41 The only valid manifestation of mysticism is the intuitive knowledge and love of God. It is in The Perennial Philosophy that Huxley gives the fullest expression to his espousal of mysticism. Technically, it is an anthology of selections from the utterances of many of the religious writers from previous centuries who have espoused mysticism or what he calls the "Perennial Philosophy": "This book ... is an anthology of the Perennial Philosophy; but, though an anthol- ogy, it contans [sic] but few extracts from the writings of professional men of letters and, though illustrating a philosophy, hardly anything from the pro- fessional philosophers."42 Only those who have made themselves "loving, pure in heart, and poor in spirit" are capable of apprehending the nature of this perennial philosophy, which, he says, "is primarily concerned with the one, divine Reality substantial to the manifold world of things and lives and minds."43 The book is divided into twenty-seven chapters dealing with various aspects of human and divine experience. The importance of the book, how- ever, lies not in the selection of excerpts from the writings of others (excellent though they may be) but rather in the ample comments which Huxley makes on these excerpts. His views can be summarized as follows: Every phase of</page><page sequence="10">178 + COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES human activity must be judged in terms of its hindering or facilitating the achievement of the ultimate purpose of life: "In all the historic formulations of the Perennial Philosophy it is axiomatic that the end of human life is con- templation, or the direct and intuitive awareness of God."44 That society is good which does not emphasize technological advances but makes possible and desirable the pursuit of contemplation. The love which is released by the exercise of this intuitive contemplation will cure many of the evils which are plaguing mankind. Thus, this love will lead to the treating of Nature kindly: the earth's resources will no longer be ravaged by people motivated only by self-interest. Similarly, this love will restore man's creativity in work so that he will no longer be a slave to the machine. This love will also make it impossible for political rulers to oppress their peoples. Above all, it will release the in- dividual from bondage to selfhood and from the fetters of time and sensual demands. The liberation from these fetters will even rid us of the ailments of "most of the degenerative diseases": our heart, kidneys, pancreas, intestines, and arteries are now subject to deterioration because we do not live in harmony with "the divine Nature of Things." Self-denial will not only bring us into union with the essence of the Godhead, but will, in so doing, relieve us of all our physical pain. Man should not be troubled by such problems as the origin of this Divine Ground or the seeming injustice of seeing evil people prosperous and good people impoverished. God is because He is: "Only when the individual also 'simply is,' by reason of his union through love-knowledge with the Ground, can there be any question of complete and eternal liberation."45 As for the seeming injustice of the "bad" man enjoying prosperity and the "good" man afflicted with poverty, Huxley offers the following explanation: "The bad man in prosperity may, all unknown to himself, be darkened and corroded with inward rust, while the good man under afflictions may be in the rewarding process of spiritual growth."46 Until the Perennial Philosophy is adopted and recognized as "the highest factor common to all the world religions," until the worshippers of every religion renounce their egocentric, time-based, and false idolatries, then "no amount of political planning, no economic blue-prints however ingeniously drawn, can prevent the recrudescence of war and revolution."47 What is the way to achieve this ideal state? To answer this question, Huxley recommends Buddha's "Eight-fold Path": Complete deliverance is conditional on the following: first, Right Belief in the all too obvious truth that the cause of pain and evil is craving for separative, egocentred existence, with its corollary that there can be no deliverance from evil, whether personal or collective, except by getting rid of such craving and the obsession of %" "me," "mine"; second, Right Will, the will to deliver oneself and others; third, Right Speech, directed by compassion and charity towards all sentient beings; fourth, Right Action, with the aim of creating and maintaining peace and good will; fifth, Right Means of Livelihood, or the choice only of such professions as are not harmful, in their exercise, to any human being or, if possible, any living creature; sixth, Right Effort towards Self-control; seventh, Right Attention or Recollectedness, to be practised in all the circumstances of life, so that we may never do evil by mere thoughtlessness, because "we know not</page><page sequence="11">ALDOÜS HUXLEY'S QUEST FOR VALUES + 179 what we do"; and, eighth, Right Contemplation, the unitivc knowledge of the Ground, to which rccollectedness and the ethical self-naughting prescribed in the first six branches of the Path give access. Such then are the means which it is within the power of the human being to employ in order to achieve man's final end and be "saved."48 Huxley is not excessively optimistic that these prescriptions will be followed by most people. "But then no saint or founder of a religion, no exponent of the Perennial Philosophy, has ever been optimistic."49 It would seem that Huxley's search for the "ideal" religion would end in the place where religion began- in the East. Huxley's insatiable intellectual thirst, however, refused to be permanently quenched. It should be remem- bered that Huxley was the grandson of Thomas Henry Huxley, the scientist, and the grandnephew of Matthew Arnold. Huxley's soul was always the battle- ground between the challenging barks of "Darwin's bulldog" (Thomas Henry Huxley's sobriquet) and the melancholy promptings for withdrawal of his maternal granduncle. The urgings for self-transcendence gave way to a con- tinued scientific probing. And so in his essay entitled "The Double Crisis," published in Themes and Variations in 1950, Huxley again calls upon techno- logical science to help solve the world's problems. It is somewhat difficult to reconcile the advocacy of self-mortification found in The Perennial Philosophy with the advice given in the following excerpt: Man cannot live by bread alone; but still less can he live exclusively by idealism. To talk about the Rights of Man and the Four Freedoms in connection, for example, with India is merely a cruel joke. In a country where two thirds of the people succumb to the consequences of malnutrition before they reach the age of thirty, but where, nonetheless, the population increases by fifty millions every decade, most men possess neither rights nor any kind of freedom. The "giant misery of the world" is only aggravated by mass violence and cannot be mitigated by inspirational twaddle. Misery will yield only to an intelligent attack upon the causes of misery.50 In the last ten years of his life, Huxley continued to turn to science both to help solve the world's problems of feeding its excessive population and settling its economic difficulties and to provide the means to increase his own aesthetic and religious perceptions. All the books published in the last decade of his life - The Doors of Perception, Heaven and Hell, Tomorrow and To- morrow and Tomorrow, Brave New World Revisited, Island, and finally, Literature and Science- mâîcate Huxley's return to his first love- science. He himself experimented with several drugs- mescalin, LSD (lysergic acid di- ethylamide), etc.- to help increase his aesthetic and spiritual awareness. Hux- ley's intention was to utilize science to facilitate the achievement of a beatific union with the Godhead, but one wonders whether in his metaphysical edifice, the temple did not become the waiting room to the laboratory. In his last published novel, Island (1962), Huxley no longer offers man the choice he offered him in Brave New World (1932) - the meaningless diver- sions of a mechanized Utopia or the almost equally barren existence of the primitive. In his last Utopia Huxley attempts to make the best of both worlds. He had always realized - his attacks on the Judeo-Christian tradition notwith-</page><page sequence="12">i8o + COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES standing- that "The ethical doctrines taught in the Tao Te Ching, by Gotama Buddha and his followers of the Lesser and above all the Greater Vehicle, in the Sermon on the Mount and by the best of the Christian saints, are not dis- similar."51 What Huxley actually wanted was a kind of fusion of the mystical contributions of the East with the technological improvements of the West. What had happened, unfortunately, was that East and West had borrowed not the best but the worst features of each other's cultures; in Ape and Essence he comments on how Belial "persuaded each side to take only the worst the other had to offer. So the East takes Western nationalism, Western armaments, Western movies and Western Marxism; the West takes Eastern despotism, Eastern superstitions and Eastern indifference to individual life. In a word, He [Belial] saw to it that mankind should make the worst of both worlds."52 In Island Huxley found the perfect solution: "Our recipe is rather different: Take twenty sexually satisfied couples and their offsprings; add science, intuition and humor in equal quantities; steep in Tantrik Bud- dhism and simmer indefinitely in an open pan in the open air over a brisk flame of affection."53 The marriage of science and religion does not seem to work very well in his fictional island of Pala, for at the end of the book the greedy and the vulgar are about to smash the mofeha-induced beatitudes of the fortunate ones. The insects at the end of the book are still vulgarly copulating -to the background music of Bach's "Fourth Brandenburg Concerto"- and the female insect still devours the male after the sexual consummation. It is quite true that Will Farnaby, the central character, has learned Karuma (Compas- sion) and has achieved an inner strength to help him withstand the inevitable onrush of idiocy, materialism, and war. But one wonders whether this inner illumination is the result of wisdom and free will or of the /wa^Ãtf-medicine, "the reality revealer, the truth-and-beauty pill." Curiously enough, mo'sha, as the Indian scholar S. Nagarajan relates,54 means "freedom for evermore." A freedom induced by a mushroom-produced drug seems hardly different from the euphoria resulting from the taking of soma in Brave New World. Essentially, then, Huxley's religious quest was a paradoxically tortuous one. He began by mocking and rejecting the Judeo-Christian tradition (though accepting its occasional manifestations of mysticism), flirted temporarily with the Lawrentian doctrine of instinctive living and "blood consciousness," changed to contemplative investigation, turned to the East for further illumina- tion, and died in the West trying to balance in an uneasy syncretism the Caliban of Western science with the Ariel of Buddhist mysticism. One specu- lates whether it was a consummation devoutly to be wished. The religious syncretism turned out to be a synthetic product; his metaphysical quest ended with a pharmacological solution.

In his books of essays he also mini- mizes the effectiveness of churchmen when they attempt to practice their "Christian ideals": "In the lounge, waiting for the coffee, we got into conversation with the clergyman. Or rather, he got into conversation with us. He felt it his duty, I suppose, as a Christian, as a temporary chaplain in the Anglican diocese of Southern Europe, to welcome the newcomers, to put them at their case. 'Beautiful evening,' he said, in his too richly cultured voice. (But I loved him for his trousers.) 'Beautiful,' we agreed, and that the place was charming. 'Staying long?' he asked. We looked at one another, then round the crowded hall, then again at one another. I shook my head. 'Tomorrow,' I said, 'we have to make a very early start.* " Do What You Will, pp. 111-112 ("Paradise"). 21. Proper Studies (London, 1927), pp. 186-187 ("The Essence of Religion.' ). 22.

In "In a Tunisian Oasis," published in The Olive Tree in 1937 he writes that "Too much insistence on the fatalism inherent in their [Arabs'] religion has reduced them to the condition of static lethargy and supine incuriousness in which they now find themselves." He blames the Arabs' religion for the fact that "half their babies die, and that, politically, they are not their own masters." This "static lethargy and supine incuriousness" which he attributes to the Mohammedanism religion sounds rather incongruous when juxtaposed with the comment he made about Mohammedanism some eight years later in The Perennial Philosophy (p. 158): "And in Mohammedanism we find a system which incorporates strongly somatotonic elements. Hence Islam's black record of holy wars and persecutions - a record comparable to that of later Christi- anity, after that religion had so far compromised with unregenerate somatotonia as to call its ecclesiastical organization 'the Church Militant.'

Christopher Isherwood, who espouses the Vedanta type of mysticism, writes: " . . .Vedanta also teaches the practice of mysticism; it claims, that is to say, that man may directly know and be united with his eternal Nature, the Atman, through meditation and spiritual discipline, without the aid of any church or delegated minister." This quotation is taken from pp. xii-xiii of the Introduction of Vedanta for Modern Man (New York, 1951), a collection of various writings on Vedanta, edited by Isherwood. To this anthology Huxley contributed several essays. To Huxley mysticism is one of the two branches of spirituality: "Spirituality is - asceticism and mysticism, the mortification of the self and ultimate Reality." See his "Readings in Mysticism," Vedanta for the Western World, ed. Christopher Isherwood (Hollywood, 1945)1 pp. 376-382. It should be noted, however, that Huxley elsewhere speaks out against the "mortifi- cation of the self." 27. The Perennial Philosophy, p. 9. 28. Do What You Will, p. 38 ("One and Many"). 29.
